SPAIN'S BOASTED NAVY
MADE UP OF SHIPS THAT
ARE WORTHLESS IN WAR
She Could Send No Fleet That Could Stand for a
Moment Against the Strong Fighting
Machines of the United States.
BOSTON, Mass., March 19.â A
naval officer of high, rank to-day re
ceived the following important dis
closures of the fatal and heretofore
unknown weaknesses of nearly all of
Spain's warships, written by the un
compromising Spanish writer, Don |
R. Guerrero. The battleship Pelayo j
is one of the best of its class. Its i
artillery can pierce the strongest ar
mors, but it has one great defeat. Its
capacity for coal does not allow it to
teaks cm enough for" k trfp rof over
3000 miles. Going to Cuba, the Pe
layo must either stop at some foreign ]
port to renew its coal supply or car
ry along with her another ship with
a cargo of coal.
. . The cruisers Almirante Oquendo,
1 1 Infanta Maria Teresa and Vizcaya
are not entirely protected. The j
cruiser Alfonso XIII is absolutely j
unprotected. Its hull can be perfor- j
ated by guns of small caliber and i
it is therefore useless .against, battle- j
ships in a naval contest. The cruisers !
Alfonso XII and Reina Cristina are I
also unprotected. They can make
thirteen miles an hour but not over i
4000 miles without renewing their
coal supplies.
The cruisers Conde de Venadito, i
Marques de la Ensanada, Isla de Lv- i
zon, Infanta Isabel, Don Juan de
Austria and Don Antonio de TJlloa,
are absolutely unprotected and make
only from 13 to 14 miles an hour.
None of them would be of service in
case of a naval battle. They would
be serviceable only in minor capaci
ties, because they must keep away
from the enemy's strong armored and
modern warships; and on account of
their slowness they cannot be em- '<
ployed as cruisers between better }
ships of a navy or from a navy to a
Spanish port.
The torpedo boats Galicia, Marquis
de Molins, Martin Alonzo Pinzon,
Vincente Yanez Pinzon and Neuva
Espana are of eighteen knots' speed
and have other good qualities, but j
are available only when it is possi
ble to surprise a battleship or
cruiser. .. [
The other warships now in Cuban
waters are mostly small gunboats i
and are useless la naval warfare. It !
is difficult to say whether the battle- j
ship Carlos V is worth anything, |
but she was built by the ship build- i
ing firm of Vega Murguia of Cadiz, I
which constructed the gunboat Fili- j
pinas, now officially declared to be j
worthless.
The torpedo gunboats Marques d* \
la Victoria, Dona Maria de Molina i
and Don Alvaro de Bazan were built
by the house of Gilotero 'of Ferrol,
which constructed the gunboats Per
la, Bubi and Diamante, now declared
to be deficient, and also the torpedo ,
gunboats Galicia, Neuva Espana, the
Molins and the Pinzon which, ac- !
cording to contract, ought to have a !
speed of twenty knots, though they j
show only eighteen. We say noth- 1
ing about other warships in Spain's '
naval list, because it is a well known : t
fact that they are of no use what- '
ever. 1

MR. ROOSEVELT DEALS A BLOW
TO THE NEW YORK YELLOW JOURNAL
NEW YORK, March 19.â Assistant Secretary Roosevelt dealt a hard
blow to yellow journalism to-day, says the Herald's Washington cor
respondent. One of the papers of this type has been publishing: with
some frequency since the commencement of the emergency prepara
tions by the Navy Department alleged authorized interviews with this
and the other officials, the majority of which they have not cared to
dignify by denial. Mr. Roosevelt was credited with making a number
of astounding statements this morning,, including pr^ ho for the paper
quoting him, and he at once denied that he had made remarks of the
character attributed to him.
The correspondent of the Journal here, learning of the action of
the Assistant Secretary, -wrote him, asking that he make no denial of
the story. This is Mr. Roosevelt's reply:
"I do not contemplate denying the story. I have already
denied It in the most unequivocal terms. The statement in
to-day's Journal was an absolute falsehood. I told your
reporter not once, but aÂ£ain and again, as he was persist
ent, that I would not give him an interview of any kind. His
conduct was infamous, and you yourselves should have
known that no such interview as that could possibly have
come from me if for no other reason than that I have never
given a certificate of character to the Journal. In your
final paragraph you say that you trust you will not have to
change your opinion of me. I can imagine nothing which
would be of less consequence to me."

i that Ihe Puritan will leave soon for

I DIVERS MAKE AN
IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.
Compartment of the Maine in Which
Wet Gun Cotton Was Stored
Found Unexploded.

KEY WEST, Fla., March 19.â 1t is
reported to-day that divers yesterday
made an important discovery in the
wreck of the Maine, locating the com
partment in' which wet gun cotton waa
stowed forward and finding the con
tents unexploded. This, if true, refutes
the Spanish claim that the initial ex
plosion came from this compartment,
and may be of sufficient importance to
warrant the return of the court to Ha
vana.
The sudden departure of the battle
ships Texas and Massachusetts is com
mented upon. It is believed here that
the latter will be placed in the dry dock
immediately upon arrival, as the ves
sel's keel is very foul. Plans by which
the turrets of the Texas can be made
far more efficient have been sent to the
Navy Department, and these improve
ments, which may net require longer
than a week's time to execute, will
doubtless be commenced immediately
upon her arrival. The fault in the
present arrangement of the turrets is
that there is only one position in which
a gun can be loaded. If a gun is fired
in any position except directly abeam,
the turret must be revolved to that
position before it can be reloaded. The
plan is to alter the gear so that the
gun can be loaded in any position in
which it is trained. The officers say
this will vastly increase the fighting
efficiency of the ship.

ARMAMENT OF
THE MAYFLOWER.
The Yacht Purchased by the Navy
Department to Be Put in Fight
ing Trim.
WASHINGTON, March 19.â The arm
ament of the Mayflower, purchased by
the Navy Department during the pres
ent week, is still under consideration
by the naval officers. Captain O'Noil.
the chief of the Ordnance Bureau, is
expecting daily a recommendation on
the subject by the commandant of the
New York navy-yard. The yacht
now carries several rapid-flre guns and
the probability is they will be sup
plemented by a few others of 4, 5 and
6 inch caliber of the same character.
Several torpedo tubes may be .Itted in
the vessel, although it is said she ;s
rather slow for torpedo service. The
two Brazilian vessels recently pur
chased by the Government, it is said,
will be taken to New York.

black letters' "Mueran los , Yankees,"

a naval station, "while Philadelphia and
Wilmington are defenseless. ; '; .

The Ejercito shows that Spain has
not been idle in the matter of ga/.^.-r
ing information, as it Is able to de
scribe at length all the defenses near
New York from Bandy Hook and T-o:;g
Island Sound to Fort Hamilton, g'ving
the number, size and strength <>f the
guns. It is declared that any modfin
fleet could easily take New York, hence
the fleet could be drawn from Cuba
by simply making a demonstration
against New York. The monitors are
described as antiquated and useless
against good ships of the preseat day.
Hampton Roads is not considered of
gr-at strength.

KEY WEST, March 19.â The report of the Court of Inquiry is now on

the Olivette at 10 o'clock to-night.
KEY WEST, Fla., March 20. â The report of the Maine Board of Inquiry was sent to President McKlnley
last night. In the conclusions of the report, it is alleged, the statement is made that the explosion was due to a
torpedo, but the Board makes no direct accusation. While Spain is not directly accused of instigating the great
crime this conclusion makes that nation responsible.
NEW YORK, March 10 â
"The Herald's Washington cor
respondent sends the following:
For the first time since the
Maine disaster President Mc-
Kinley to-day heard the story of
the blowing up of the ship from
the lips of survivors. The three
officers who called upon him
gave him much light on the
calamity itself and little on the
cause.
What they were able to tell him. how
ever, does not materially change the
situation. It convinced him that the
explosion was external and that there
might be great difficulty in fixinsr the
guilt or responsibility. So the Presi
dent, not any wiser than before so far
as the vital question goes,, is waiting,
while preparations in the army and navy
are rushing ahead just as though it was
the worst that was expected instead of
the best.
He will probably have to 'wait until
Tuesday. He does not now expect the
report of the court of inquiry until that
time. The country will have to wait a
day or two longer. How weary wait
ing has become is shown by the faces
of the Cabinet members, who are sick of
guessing and want to face an actual con
dition.
The President's desire to have the
help of Congress in all steps to be
taken on the Cuban question in a meas
ure brings a new element into the prob
lem. For instance, may Congress be
counted upon to act with the President
on the Maine matter as well as on the
Cuban question?
Here may be complications, as may
be seen from a statement made to me
to-day by a high administration author
ity. This official pointed out that it
might be impossible to connect the
Spanish nation with the explosion un
less it was shown that the man who

PANDO NOT A CAPTIVE,
BUT SPAIN HAS TROUBLE
BREWING IN PORTO RICO.
NEW YORK, March 19. â Some little excitement was caused here
to-day for a few moments by the circulation of an idle story to the
effect that General Pando, fhe second in command of the Spanish
forces in Cuba, had been captured by the Cubans, under Calixta
Garcia. Later in the day it developed that the tale was certainly
without foundation, and it is believed now it had its origin in this
city.
A more serious matter are the stories of threatened uprising that
come from Porto Rico.
In sv'-te of official and other dental*, it is believed serious troubles
for Spain in that island are imminent, and it is asserted, though the
report cannyt be verified at present, that the Spanish cruiser Viz
caya, when she leaves Havana, will go to Porto Rico, in order to
strengthen the hands of the Government officials there.
fired the supposed mine or exploded the
supposed torpedo was acting under gov
ernmental sanction. This, then, would
be an act of war. but in order to claim
indemnity the United States might have
to show specific neglect on the part of
the Spanish Government. In that con
nection he quoted an interview with
E. J. Phelps, printed on Friday, which
shows how carefully the Cabinet is
watching the newspapers.
This is an administration view. What
Congress might think is another matter.
The idea that was running through the
mind of the official who was talking was
that Spain might have good ground to
deny our demand and seek to arbitrate.
But here Congress steps in again. The
view entertained by the leaders in Con
gress on arbitrating a question like this
is emphatic. They brush it aside as not
to be entertained ior an instant.
The view of the administration official
which I have touched on is not con
clusive. No one knows, not even
President McKinley, what the adminis
tration will do or try to do until the
court of inquiry reports. The President
continues unswerving in his belief that
our course on the Cuban question will
be shaped largely by the destruction of
the Maine. That will hasten matters.
It may bring them to a quick climax.
The administration is mightily inter
ested in the Spanish Minister's state
ment published in the Herald the other
day that Spain would not necessarily re
gard the recognition of the indepen
dence of the Cuban insurgents by the
United States as an act of war.
But in this matter of recognizing the
independence of the Cubans Congress
enters into the game again. There con
tinues in the House of Representatives
the same opposition to that step. Some
of the men who lead there insist there
is no republic to recognize. Where is
their capital? Where is their Govern
ment sitting? What is tangible there
yet but a scattered fighting force?
These are questions they ask.
a. The views given to the Herald â¦
+. to-day show that many men in +
+ Congress hold that if we are to â¦
+ meddle with Cuba at all we must +
f actually intervene. Intervention *
â¢f means war. There is high Span- *
â¢â¦â  ish authority for that.
The arrival of the survivors of the
Maine and their extended conferences
with President McKinley and Secretary
Long furnished one of the most inter
esting features in to-day's developments
on the Soanish situation. Three officers
of. the Maine. Lieutenant George W.
Holman, Lieutenant George B. Blow
and Lieutenant Callatin of the Marine
Corps, accompanied by Botswain Lar
kins, came on unexpectedly from Key-
West. It was said their visit was purely
voluntary on their part, as they are
on waiting orders 'and are free to go
where they please. Their iona confer
ence at the Navy Department and later
at the White House led to much con
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
BOTH GOVERNMENTS
BUYING SUPPLIES
NEW YORK, March 19.â The
National Provisioner, the organ
of the provision and meat indus
tries, to-day says editorially:
The United States Navy Depart
ment has been a liberal buyer
of family beef in New York this
week, taking over 1000 barrels
and it is in the market for other
quantities. There is no question
that some large buying orders
have been placed upon the New
York market for provisions this
week from the Spanish Govern
ment. Common rumor here
places the purchasing thus far
at fully 600,000 pounds of dry
salted bacon.
jecture, it being asserted that Lieutenant
Blow brought with him the report of
the court of inquiry, or at least the gen
eral conclusions reached by that court.
It can be stated positively, however,
from an authoritative source, that the
officers did not bring with them the re
port, either as a whole or its general
conclusion. It can be said with equal
positiveness and authoritatively that
they do not know what the action of the
court of inquiry is, and therefore aro
not in a position to convey any informa
tion to the President or the Secre
tary of the Navy on that point Their
talks are confined entirely to graphic
narratives of their experiences on tha
night of the explosion.
Another interesting arrival of the day
was Constructor Hoover, the technical
expert sent to Havana to identify the
twisted plates in the Maine wreckage
with a view to learning whether the
explosion was of internal or external
origin. Mr. Hoover also maintained
silence concerning the wreck. He made
no report to the Secretary of the Navy,
as he was sent to Havana to learn facts
and then embody them in testimony be
fore the Naval Court of Inquiry.
When the report of the court of in
quiry has been received and made pub
lic the self-control and conservatism
which both the executive and legisla
tive branches of the Government have
displayed in dealing with the Maine dis
aster will be subjected to the supreme
test. v
Representative Maguire of California
stated the case very forcibly to-day
when he said: . "If the report of the
court of inquiry is what we all antici
pate, if it shows that the ship was de
troyed by an external aarency but does
not connect the Spanish Government
with that agency in any way, it will pre

fairs to the recognition of Mndcpen
dence, for the additional reason that
this investigation does not convince
them that the insurgents have standing
which would justify the United States
in recognizing them and admitting them
to the family of nations.
Other members of these committees
take the opposite view and favor the
recognition oi independence, but the
trend of opinion among leaders of most
influence is rather that the United States
may be forced to intervene in some way
to stop the war, and that there will be no
real government of Cuba unless, as a
result of such intervention, it shall be
established by the arms of the United
States.
Any action that Congress may take
on this subject will depend largely upon
the character of the information which
is furnished by the President, who is ex
pected, at no distant date, to lay before
both houses all the consular reports
which he has received from Consul-
General Lee and other American Con
suls in Cuba.
On this matter, as well as in regard to
the settlement of the Maine affair, con
servatives in Congress, while, willing to
share all responsibility with the Presi

tive. There is no denying, however,
that there is a strong element in Con
gress which, it carried away by popular
clamor, might break over . all restraint
and insist on an immediate settlement
by driving Spain out of Cuba.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
BLATHER OF
SPAIN'S PRESS
Styles the United States
as an Immense Float
ing Maine.
El Globo Attributes the Disaster
to Bad Storage and Lack
.Discipline.
And the Heraldo Smiles at "Seeing
tlu Yankees Begin <t War
like Display."
Special Dlapatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 19.â Madrid advices
of Wednesday say the Government or
i:.in, El (Hobo, assumes a much bolder
and loftier tone than lately. It com
pares the United States to "an immense
Maine; floating between the Atlantic
and the Pacific, some of whose crew
having lost their heads are seeking to
force Open the magazine in order to
blow it up." President McKinley, as
the commander, is represented as "do
ing his beet to restore to reason his un
ruly crew."
El Globo attributes the loss of the
Maine to "bad storage of her enormous
quantity of explosives, arising either
from too hasty preparations for war or
from want of . proper discipline on
board." El Globo remarks in paren
theses, that the "agents were entirely
internal," adding: "But there may be
external agencies that will bring about
the national downfall to which the
Union is directly heading."
Quoting some paragraphs from the
Correspondence slaying that war
would affect other nations besides
Spain, El Globo remarks: "To this
we may add that the "declarations at
t dinned to, the Kaiserâ Emperor Wil
liam of declarations which
were sought to be denied, are now
confirmed afresh in such an authentic
manner that all doubt has vanished on
the subject. We mention this declara
tion Of the Kaiser's, not that we placi
the hope of our safety in his, or any
foreign aid, but in order to complete
the picture we ought at the present
time to have of the dispositions of the
European Chancellors respecting this
event. Spain has shown that. she can
prepare herself in silence and with
greater efficiency than her adversary,
but apart from that attitude of Spain
there undoubtedly exists external
agents who may exert most dismal in
fluence, once it is set in motion. We
estimate as worse than a defeat a
European coalition against the United
States."
The paper referred to then enumer
ates the possible evils It foresees for
the United States, and closes with the
following reflections:
"Into this evil plight the cupidity of
I few has placed the nation, which lieu
peacefully anchored between the At
lantic and the Pacific, and which tc
day finds Itself In the dilemma of hav
ing to retire to find herself in much
worse a position than Spain, which in
truth is greater in spirit than in
iiy."
Th* Heraldo (Independent) is in an
equally happy mood. While admitting
it is Pinong the first to point out Span
ish defects, it confesses "it can only
unite at seeing the Yankees devoting
themselves to the difficult task of try
ing to frighten us by a war-like di?
p- >y"
continuing, the Heraldo compares the
attitude of the United States :o that
of a "boulevarde swaggerer who Haunts
his dollars to attract the attention of
a tine lady passing by," adding that
in. "lute a woman of good breed- m
ing, confident In herself, will continue
In her course, brave and alon-?, and
will pay no attention to foreign ros

Minneapolis, Minn. Appleyard was be

Tho young woman visited friends at Che

Qahan. Ho spent money freely for car
riage rides, boating and excursions, and
Boon Appleyard's sweetheart forgot her
vows. Her visit was prolonged until one
dny she found she would become a moth
er. She returned home, begged Appleyard
to release her, and told him the truth.
The young man said : .
"I love yÂ«Â»u madly; you must be my
wife."
They were married at once and the
bride became a mother in a Chicago hos
pital. Appleyard visited Gaban at Che
boygan, representing himself as tho
wronged girfa brother, aad cleverly drew
out the admission o.r.n Qahan loved the
girl and wanted to marry her. Then, with
out a Word of winning, Appleyard shot

KALAMAZOO, Mich., March 19.â D.
Donbleyker. a Kalamazoo man, In a re
cent visit to Amsterdam, went into a lit
tle barber shop in a narrow street and in
a pile of rubbish On the floor he found a
picture, covered with dirt. The barber
sold it to Denbleykor for 40 florins (sl6).
He took it to Ryk's Museum in Amster
dam, one of the finest art galleries in the
world. The museum wanted to buy the
picture, but Denbleyker did not want to #
sell then. Arriving in New York he took
the picture to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art. This museum also wanted to buy
the picture and several art dealers
wanted it. He finally sold the picture for
It was then discovered that the canvas
was from the brush of Gabriel Metzu. one
of the greatest genre painters of the
world, who flourished early In the seven
teenth century, ranking with artists of
such fame as Gerard Douw. The present
owner of the picture is a wealthy col
lector of New York, who values his prize
at $10,000, though it is not for sale at any
price.
It is considered remarkable that the
curator of Kyk's Museum, Amsterdam,
to whom the picture wag first shown, did
not recognize it and secure it. DeuMey-,
ker thinks he did. but. in his desire to get
it as cheaply as possible and not count

ANXIOUS FOR
IN ALLIANCE
Sincerity of the British
for an Kntente With
Uncle Sam.
It Is Argued That a Compact of
Anglo-Saxons Would Pre
serve Peace of the World.
England Willing to Regard This
Country in the Light of a Friend
and Brother.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, March 19.â The remarkable
unanimity of the approval of both
classes and masses of the mere sugges
tion of an Anglo-American alliance
compels belief in the sincerity of the
desire of the British public for an en
tente with the United States. The fact
that most of the cable dispatches from
America have proclaimed that the sug
gestion has been seriously discussed is
heartily welcomed here, and is regard
ed as extremely important and gratify
ing, as evidencing a friendiy spirit.
"There are," as a diplomatist put It,
"inyjiiring hopes that the dift'erertce of
the past will be buried, and that the
Anglo-Saxons, in the near future, will
j be found issuing identical notes to all
i opposed to their common interests."
The diplomat continued: "It is not
any stretch of the imagination to say
that such a union has been longed for
; by the best men in Great Britain many
i years, not only because of the genuine
wish for closer bonds of friendship, but
because it is a known fact that all the
statesmen of Europe realize that a
close alliance between America and
Oreat Britain would constitute, not
, only the surest guarantee of the peace
of the world, but would afford proof
that the reign of law and individual
liberty is to bo extended for the benefit
of mankind, in spite of the efforts to
extinguish it made by reactionary rul
ers and governments."
The weekly newspapers pay con
siderable attention to the subject. The
Speaker says: "it is Impossible for
the statesmen of either country to
rind a nobler object to which to devote
their energies and their lives. What
ever the actual relations in which the
Governments of London and Washing
ton regard the matter, the American
people may be assured that if they
wish for an agreement the people cf
Great Britain also wish for one. We
do not wish to ask the Americans to
tight our battles, just as -we feel con
vinced that they are too proud to de-
Firo that we should fight theirs^ But
what we do wish and what wj> men
on both sides must earnestly desire Is
t that each nation shall feel that it has
in the other h friend and a brother on
whose sympathy it can rely in time
of need."
The Spectator, noting the good feel
i ing expressed in the United States,
says: "It does not follow from any de
sire to court the old country because it
may be useful, but is due to the report
ed coalition on the continent against
England." Continuing, the Spectator
â¢ remarks: 'The danger, or supposed
1 danger, of the British awoke race feel-
Ing with a rush, and the difficulty with
Spain only served to increase the latent
sentiment essential to the unityexisting
among Anglo-Saxons. The possibility
that the Spanish quarrel might bring
them face to face with a continental
coalition made the Americans realize
that our race is not beloved on the con
tinent and that we may some day have
to make a common cause. Americans
â  are quite right in assuming that they
will have the supoprt of the Britishers
should a continental alliance attempt to
oppress them. If our people once real
ize the condition of Cuba half of Eng
land would be calling the Americans
hard names because they have not In
tervened earlier to stop the horrors per
petrated at their very doors."
The curious mixture of pacific assur
: ances and announcements of active
preparations for war which are coming
from the United States keeps the pro
phets but, the opinion is
gaining frrr.ur.il that the outlook is Im
proving and that war will finally be
averted by a Spanish retreat under
some more or leÃÃ specious excuse and
I c MUtant to recognize the claims of
the United States, for. in spite of stor- â 
lea to tho contrary, Spain is well aware
that it is useless to build hopes of sym
pathy from the European powers.
â¢ Commenting on the attitude of Presi
dent Mc-Kinley. the Saturday Review
s.:>^ it is a suggestive commentary on
government by the people that the
means of preventing what the
President calls an unholy war has been
for the Government to "face popular
clamor in an attitude of indifference
BU< b as might be expected of Russia."
Reading between the lines of the re
assuiing cable messages, the pessimis-
Spectator thinks nothing has hap
: to Improve the situation, and
says: 'While the President is sincere
ly "anxious- to avoid war. doubtless his
destre will be strengthened by the ad
vioes of the navy and army depart

CHOOSING NAMES
FOR ADDITIONS
TO THE NAVY
Secretary Long Will F^echristen the
fJroazonas, Styling the Cruiser
New Orleans, in Honor of
Louisiana's Chief City.
NEW YORK, March 19.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Secretary Long has determined to rechristen the new American cruiser
Amazonas the New Orleans, in honor of the principal city of Louisi
ana. This determination was reached by the Secretary only after ne
had given a most careful consideration to the claims of various cities
throughout the Union, which had, through their representatives In
Congress, requested that their names be placed on the bows of one ol
the new cruisers purchased in England.
Senator Platt and Representative Southwick of New York had urged
the Secretary to name the Amazonas Albany; Representative Ma
honey that she be called Buffalo; Representative Bull of Rhode Island
that she be christened Providence, an Arkansas Representative Pres
cott; and other members of Congress that she be named as they re
quested. .In view of the fact that the State of New York contains
two citiesâ New York and Rrooklynâ which are represented in the navy
by ships bearing their names, the Secretary thought it only proper that
6ome State which had no representative ship in the service should
be recognized, and he, therefore, has selected New Orleans.
Express authority to change the name of the Amazonas is given
Secretary Long by section 1538 of the Revised Statutes, which specifies
that the Secretary of the Navy may change the names of any vessels
purchased for the navy by authority of law. The choice of names
for the Amazonas and her sister ship, Abrueall, is restricted by law
to principal cities. No determination has been reached by the Sec
retary as to the name to be given the Abrueall or Mayflower. The
Abreuall will not be completed before December 1, according to advices
received at the department from Lieutenant Colwell, the naval attache,
who purchased the vessels for the United States, and there is conse
quently no hurry as to the selection of her name. It is believed, how
ever, that Prescott stands an excellent chance of being honored by the
Secretary calling the new cruiser after it. So far as the Mayflower is
concerned. It is proposed by the Secretary to confer with the Presi
dent during the coming week and a name will be selected. It Is pos
sible that the name of some naval man of prominence in the history
of the country may be selected.

FAVANA (via Key West), March 19.
MilitEtX} operations have been sus
pended by General Pando in the east
of Cuba, and he is seeking a confer
ence with General Gomez, General
Garcia and the Cuban President and
other prominent Cubans.
Several thousand insurgents have
gathered on the east and west sides of
the Juscaro-Moron trocha, in the prov
ince of Puerto Principe, which is much
weakened by the withdrawal of troops
by General Pando.
It is believed this conference is the

?he !sland P Havana officials believe
that the offer will be accepted and that
war will be ended.
The insurgent authorities ana tne
best posted merchants and bankers
believe, on the contrary, that the fail
ure of the conference means the death
blow of autonomy, while it is prob
able lhat a large force of insurgents
will break through the trochas and will
raid the country up to Havana.
NEW YORK, March 19.â At the of
fices of the Cuban Junta in this city
there was great rejoicing when the
foregoing dispatch was translated.
T. Estrada Palma read the bulletin
very carefully and said: "Of course,
we don't doubt that the Spaniards
have suspended operations in Cuba and
that General Pando is seeking a con
ference with the Cuban leaders. Pando
has been trying to do the same ever
since he arrived in Cuba. So far he
has not succeeded, and we are con
fident he will not."
"The gathering of large Cuban forces
near the Jucaro-Moron trocha is proba
bly for their passage through it in order
to invade the western provinces, as
was announced in the Associated Press
cablegrams a few days ago. There
will be no conference between the Cu
ban leaders and Pando or any other
Spanish representative.
"The belief of the Havana officials
that the Spanish propositions will be
accepted is preposterous. The latter
portion of the dispatch speaks for it
self. The Cubans will not admit of any
solution of the war unless it be based
on the absolute independence of Cuba."

The evil that Weyler did lives after him

Justly attributed nine-tenths of all

States.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
CHINA'S OFFER
TO THE CZAR
Willing to Lease Talien-
Wan, but Not Port
Arthur.
Negotiations Have Now Been
Transferred to St.
Petersburg.
The Rebellion Against the Manchu
Dynasty Spraading Along the
Yang-tae-Kiang.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
PEKING, March 19.â The recent In
activity of the Russians at Peking is
explained by the fact that the negotia
tions have again been transferred to St.
Petersburg, owing to the difficulties en
countered here. The coincidence of the
French demands presented on the eve
o-f the negotiation of the Chinese loan
in London is commented upon, and it is
asserted that France and Russia are
trying their best to wreck the loan.
Upon the occasion of the last visit of
the French Embaesador to the Chinese
Foreign Office, the Chinese refused to
accede to the French proposals, and the
Embassador said that when he next
visited the Foreign Office he would pre-
sent stronger arguments and would
even threaten active operations from
Tongking and the forcible seizure of a
coaling station.
The general opinion here is that it
is impossible to disregard the persist
ent rumors circulating in well informed
circles that Russia has abandoned her
attempts to lease Port Arthur, but has
not ceased her negotiations regarding
Talien-Wan.
China, it is said, has offered to lease
to Russia Talien-Wan and to allow the
proposed railway from Petura to
Kwang Chun Tv, Munkden and Port
Arthur to be constructed provided
Port Arthur remains in China's hands.
It was rumored yesterday that the
Chinese Government is increasing the
Port Arthur garrison by 300 men and is
also sending troops to Tallu and Shan-
Kwan.
The interview which was to have
been had yesterday by M. Doboie, the
French Charge d'Affalres, with the
authorities was postponed, owing to
the sacrifices in the Temple of the Sun.
China, it Is asserted, proposes to yield
only to the demands relative to the
province of Kwang Si.
LONDON, March 19.â A special dis
patch from Shanghai, received here to
day, says a conspiracy with the object
of bringing about a rebellion, has been
started by Chinese officials of various
ranke in the Chang Sha province of
Hunan.
It is said to have spread to all the
provinces bordering on the Yang-tse-
Kiang. and fears are expressed that it
may prove to be the most formidable
since the Taiping rebellion. It is pro
fessedly a patriotic movement to over
throw the Manchu dynasty and save
the central provinces from European
control. But it is suspected that the
plot emanated from the Mandarines,
who are alarmed at the prospect of a
diversion of part of their pickings to
pay the interest on tUe new loan.
The Pekin authorities are cognizant
of the movement, but, distrusting the
loyalty of the provincial troops, they
are helpless.
The conspirators are said to have ap
proached British subjects with induce
ments to join in the rebellion and they
have also offered large sums of money
for arms. _______________

NEW YORK, March 1<Â». -A City of
Mexico special to the Herald says:
Colonel Prospero Morales and suite,
accompanied by a rich Spaniard named
Llerendi and a medical corps of
six physicians, headed by Dr. Tre
vino of this city, sailed to-day on a
chartered steamship from Vera Cruz
to Coatzacoalcos, and will go thence
via the Tehuantepee Railway toSallna
Cr-aiz, and by steamship to San Benito.
l"nere, with a body of men, they will
cross the Guatemala frontier to revive
the revolution. A large force of men
is waiting on the Salvadoran frontier
to penetrate into Guatemala as soon as
they hear of the rising in the north.
A large Spanish house here is the
financial backer of the rebels on the
promise that the head of the firm shall
be given the treasury portfolio in the
Cabinet.

Dame has yearly given a medal known
as Laetare medal, because bestowed on
Laetare Sunday, to a layman chosen as
standing foremost among the workers

cation and religion.

of solid gold decorated with wreaths
and words of praise, together with the
names of the donor and the recipient.

following:
John Gilmary Shea, historian; Pat
rick Keeley, architect; Eliza Allen Star,
artist and author; General John New
ton, soldVr and scientist; T. V. Hickey,
editor; Mrs. Anna H. Dorsey, author;

diana, in recognition of his faithful
services in behalf of religion, morality,
education and law, and in recognition
of his personal worth as a man, a
citizen and a public official.

Americana, and Insurgents Again
Grow Bold-
Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, March 19.â Further proof
of the understanding existing between
Spain and Austria is furnished by the
fact that the patriotic committee has
presented a seat for the performance
at the Tacon Theater to the commander
of the Austrian schoo-lship Dona. Sev
enty-five ceritens was paid for the seat,
the fund being raised for the purchase
of a warship being swelled that much.
With the seat goes an address reciting
the close relations existing between the
Austrian -and Spanish thrones, being
connected by blood ties.
The efforts of American philanthro
pists particularly those connected with
the Red Cross, to relieve suffering in
Cuba are viewed with some suspicion,
their disinterestedness being doubted in
many quarters. La Lucha, \n an edi
"oriaJ this afternoon, says: While in
Cuba our politicians are nightly amus
ine themselves with endeavors to serve
their country, and in the mother coun
try politicians kill time with their own
ambUions, our neighbors in America
demote their time to philanthropy ef
forts to ameliorate suffering in Cuba,
lelvtng their own sufferers to their own
device! by means of large public and
have taken
place in each of the six provinces. The
Sost important conflict tdok place
March 16 in Santa Clara. The insur
gents under Bermudez, lost ten k cd.
and the Spanish lost two privates killed,
one officer and five privates wounded.
The next day the rebels were engaged
at Polo Morte and Puchano for two
hour? losing fifteen men. The rebels
retreated. The Spanish lost Captain
\llende and three privates and five oth
ers were severely wounded. General
HerndeY de Velasco is concentrating
trSps in Pinar del Rio. where he will
immediately begin active operations.
OKLAHOMA BANDITS
ROB A CONGREGATION.
GUTHRIE, Okla.. March 19.â Four
masked men rode into the little town
of Paney, Woods County, last evening,
and finding practically the entire pop
ulation attending revival services at
the Methodist church, proceeded to hold
up the congregation. The minister
was praying when the robbers ap
peared at the door, and they waited for
him to conclude before they stated
their mission. Then came the order.
"Hands up," which was promptly
obeyed by every person In the house.
While two of the bandits covered tne
victims with revolvers the other two
"took up a collection," not sparing
even the preacher, from whom they
got $3 or $4. The few nickels and
dimes that had been taken no by the
deacons at the previous collection were
also taken.
After gathering in all the money and
watches in the church two of the rob
bers visited the stores of the town and
took all the money in sight, while the
other two herded the townspeople in
the church. All four then rode south
into the hills. A posse is in pursuit,
but with small hopes of overtaking
them.

Asserts That thÂ« Anglo - Saxon In
America Is a Myrth, and AlludÂ«s

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 19.â A lively con
troversy has been taking place between
Michael Davitt and the Daily Chroni
cle by Mr. Davitt's attack on the sug
gested alliance between the United
States and Great Britain. The Chroni
cle which, up to the present, has been
the most friendly paper toward the
Irish, rebuked Mr. Davitt in its Issue
of yesterday for his cable message to
a New York newspaper saying it will
"ill serve the Irish cause." and declar
ing that It is absolutely untrue that the
English ruling classes are in sympathy
with Spain and hostile to America.
Mr. Davitt retorts with a letter which
will be published on Monday, buttress
ing his statement that the ruling class
are hostile to America. He quotes the
â¢'organs- of the aristocracy" during the
Venezuelan dispute and inquires how
they can be reconciled with "the pres
ent hypocritical professions of friend
ship toward the republic?"
Continuing, Mr. Davitt asserts the right
of Irishmen to voice independent views
of Great Britain's foreign policy "In
spite of the wishes of the English
friends of home rule." and asserts that
t&e Anglo-Saxon in America is a
myth, and makes the statement that
Irishmen, Germans, Frenchmen, Dutch
men and Norwegians constitute three
fourths of the Americans of to-day, and
that the children of these races "will
not permit their Government to form
an alliance with that power which is
distrusted by every civilized people, an
alliance which would seriously impair
the unique moral influence she exer
cises among all nations owing to her
pacific and non-aggressive Internation
al policy."

NAI'A. March IS. The evtdÂ«Â«nce for
and aglnsi Qsorsjs dark is ail In and
the defendant's Ufo. now rests only on
!::.â  it tomey*S words.
The defense was s surprise, not be
oanae of Its character, but because at
its practical aboonoo. There was node
fense When tho prosecution dosed the
defense waived an opening statement,
and when defendant's witnesses were
(.illi-il .ill they Oame to say was that
George Clark held s fair reputation In
the town of St. Helena, but the wit
nesses did not know <â¢>? the defendant's
tlons With his sister in law.
That -was all, and all of this Mr. Bell
admitted. He was not trying Clark's
character, he said, and he would ad
mit that witnesses could bo found to
say it was good. Three witnesses were
all the defense could put on, and the
testimony of two more was admitted
by iho District Attorney; With that the
defense rested.
For tWO hours Mr. Hell spoke of his
rase, * it was .1 clear and carefully
worded argument, drawing home point
after point until the shadow of the gal*
lows lay on the court room and the de
fendant clutched the chair in front of
him and tried not to hoar what was be
ing said. Mr. Bell made no denunciation
of the prisoner. He stuck to hi* cose
and the testimony he had introduced.
There was no need for denunciation;
the case as Bell presentÂ© j it was de
nunciation enough, for it followed the
man from the time the murderous im
pulse came to his mind until ho lay in
jail for the murder of his brother. Step
by stop the District Attorney went on
through the fabric of lies the murderer
had built around bis crime, and false
hood by falsehood he tore the structure
apart and drove home the proof, of
guilt. '^r ; :
Mr. Hogan answered him. and con-
Fumed the remainder of the time un
til adjournment. He spoke principally
i>f the presumption of innocence and
the requirement that Clark must be
proved guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt before there could be a convic
tion.
amenta will be resumed on Mon
day, and the ease will bo to the Jury
Monday afternoon.
Mrs. Daisy Daks was called first in
the morning to tell how she had heard
some one rattHns some tins in the
kitchen, and, peeping through the key
hole, she thought she saw George
Clark.
Mr. Osbourn waa called out of order
bj the .lefense to teetlfj llark'a
character, which, he said, \\;Â»s good.
The defense called .1. H. Steves, a
hardware merchant of St. Helena. He
had known the defendant about six
years, and believed his reputation was
good; but he had never heard the pris
oner's reputation discussed, nor did he
know, prior to the murder, George
Clark's relation* with his brother's I
wife.
Rev. James Mitchell, who has resided
In St. Helena since lv; r:'. testified that
the prisoner's reputation was, on the
whole, good. M. C IfacDonald, a
wheelwright, who has lived in St. He
lena for sixteen years, aid he had nev
er board anything against the reputa
tion of the defendant
This closed the case for the defense.
It had not lasted a half hour.

Bpcctal IMnpatch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN JOSE. March 19. â How machine
politics arc manipulated in star-cham
ber proceedings by the "gang" is being
Strikingly illustrated at this juncture.
It has been persistently asserted by
every one familiar with tho methods
of the ringSters that every independent
candidate who tiled his petition and
intends to run In opposition to the
nominees of the New Charter Club was
cither a creature of the bosses or would
be used by the latter as a catspnw.
Events of the past few days Â«re fully
justifying that sweeping charge.
In the Mercury, the organ of the
"gang," there appeared an editorial
this morning in which occurred the fol
lowing:
"A meeting was held yesterday at
which were present nearly all the per
sona who have been named as Inde
pendent candidates to bo voted for at
the coming city election. The meeting
was at the instance of the business
men and taxpayers, who are anxious
that the affairs of the municipality at
this Important crisis shall be placed in
the hands of competent and honest
men, who will administer them Impar
tially and without regard to party pol
itics or ring connections."
Continuing, this editorial. Assaulting
English grammar and further mutilat
ing the truth, said:
"The result of the meeting, no far as
results were obtained, were eminently
satisfactory. The ticket no far as
agreed upon Is as follows: For City
Clerk, J. w. Cook; for City Treasure^
J. x. Swing; for members of the Ap
pointing Boardâ Rush MoComas, Henry
Booksin ST., A. G. Bennett, Paul P.
Austin, Milton Campbell, Al Col, Frank
Stock, Elmer Chase, F. K. Spencer. J.
K. Secord, John Lellier, F. D. Hartman,
C. D. Wright and 11. J. Pikes,"
Here were sixteen men named as
having been selected at ft meeting
called "at the Instance of the business
men and taxpayers," at which there
"were present nearly an the persons who
have been named as Independent candi
dates."
A stran.ce thing: In connection with
this meeting, vaguely described in tho
editorial columns of the "ruhr" oriran,
was that there .was no report of it in
the local columns of the paper. Ani
mated by the deaire to give the. people
of San Jose the details of so Important
an affair as this meeting appeared to
have been, the correspondent of Tho
Call made a personal canvass of the
candidates named In the Mercury edi
torial, nearly all of whom wore. Bald
to have been present at the- inept
The facts and circumstances Bought for
were those usually given in buna rule
reports of bona tide meetings. An effort
was made to learn who had called the
meeting, who had been invited to at
tend it, how the call had boon Issued,
who wore present, where it WM held,
who presided and what was done.
Only three men could be found in the
city who had attended the alleged
meeting, and each of these differed
from the two others as to the day on
which the meeting "called by the busi
ness men and taxpayers" had been
hold. It was further ascertained thai
ten at least of the sixteen named in
the Mercury editorial were not present
at the "meeting," that four had abso
lutely no knowledge of the "mooting"
having been called, and no one could
tell who had called the "meeting,"
Nobody could be found who could or
would give a straightforward account
Of the "meeting." Some interesting
short stories were obtained, however,
In the course- of the interviews had with
some- of the men who had been In
dorsed at the "meeting:"
Frank Stock was not at the "meet-
Ing;" He had been asked to be pres
ent, but would not give the name of the
gentleman Who extended him the In
vitation.
j. N. Ewlng was not there, and he
had not had notice of any meeting.
J. w. Cook told th.- same story.
Rash McComas was at the "meet
ing;." Ho said that Paul P. Austin
presided a.nd that it was held in the
offlce of C. D. Wright, either on
Wednesday or Thursday. This was all
that ho could be induced to tell. lie
referred the interviewer to Paul P.
Austin for further particulars.
Wright said that he was present at
the "mooting" only part of the time,
and was not there when the slate was
made up as announced in the Mercury.
He declared that the "meeting** was
held yesterday (Friday) 'afternoon.' Re
said that he did not know who had
called it. His clerk had told him that
his ofiftei* was wanted, and he had sim
ply consented to the use of his office.
To his recollection neither Lefller. Se
cord r.or Fikes were present.
F. V Spencer was too sick to be pres
ent.- . â  -4 : .:l'''-:*vÂ£>
-Milton Campbell was not there, and
had no notice of any meetlnjr.
Al Col's story was a repetition of
Campbell's.
A. G. Bennett \ms there, but declined
to say anything about the "meet
except that it was held Thursday. So
far as he could remember Hartmaa was
not present.
Accepting In irood faith the ctate
ments of McComas. 1 Wright and Ben
nett, In spite. of some Rlarinj? dSscrep
andes therein, there were four men
present at this "meeting;,*' called "at
the Instance of the business mea and
the taxpayers" and nt which w<?re
present, aecordiair- to the Mercury,
"nearly all the persons who haw beec
nar.Â«ni as independent candidates to
be voted for at . the cob - cltj^ Â»iov
tlon." There are some who are wU'ingr
to wajrer that Ren and ; Maekens>Â«Â» can
tell â¢ more about this pntherjtsjr Than '
any of the men who claim to have been
present.
It Is this ticket, belnjr nam^J inflnia
peculiar irÂ».nr.er. - that the Mercurs*
says "*WOI receive the hcartv support
of every, voter who deslr*s to eliminate
persoaal politics froni the "administra

provisions of thÂ«Â» new charter put into
practical effect."

County.
Some Sections Report Little
Injury From tho Cold
Wave.
In One OrohÂ«rd, However, Nlnety
flva Per Cent of the Apricot
Buds Were Nipped.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, March 19.â tem
perature In this county appears to be
very irregular and streaked. For in
stance, in one part of the county this
morning: there was scarcely any frost,
while In another section the frost was
the heaviest of the season. In the
vicinity of Woodland, in some orchards
the damage was very serious, but in
others it was slight.
j In one orchard and vineyard of 160
acres just south of Woodland the dam
age is not very serious. At Capay there
was but little frost this morning 1 ; and
no 'further damages are reported. The
frost at Knights Landing was quite
heavy, and much damage resulted. At
Winters the frost was very light.
The opinion now is that the first re
ports of damages were exaggerated.
Nevertheless the apricot and almond
crops are seriously Injured. From the
Yolo Orchard the most discouraging re
ports come. The frost this morning
was the heaviest of the season, and
the temperature was lower than it has
been at any time this month. Both
Mr. Kells, the superintendent, and E.
J. DePue, one of the proprietors, are
of the opinion that 95 per cent of the
apricot buds and 75 per cent of the al
mond buds are dead. The loss Is prob
ably between $40,000 and $50,000.
The prune crop is apparently unin
jured. There has been some damage
to the peach crop, but no approximate
estimate can yet be made. A thousand
stationary fires were kept burning last
night, and five steamers, with a capac
ity of evaporating 100 gallons each per
hour, were kept In operation; neverthe
less, the damage was of a most seri
ous character. â

WANTED IN

Dr. William E. Forrest of
Los Angeles Ar
rested.
Accused of Having Robbed a
Gothamite of a Sum
of Money.
Expresses Confidence in His Ability
to Prove the Charge 11l-
Founded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 19.â Dr. "Wil
liam E. Forrest, well known in social
and business circles here and in Pasa
dena, is in a world of trouble. Dr. For- !
rest has been arrested on a telegraphic
order from New York City, charging
him with grand larceny. The telegram
Is signed by Captain McC'lusky, head
of the detective force of the metropolis.
The arrest of Forrest was made imme
diately after the receipt of the tele
gram, and he is well known, and de
tectives at once took him into custody, j
The telegram from New York states ;
that there is a warrant issued charging i
Dr. Forrest with stealing $2500 from
Alexander McAlfee of 50 Broadway,
that city.
An effort â was made to-day to cause
Dr. Forrest's release on a writ of ha
beas corpus. The proceedings were
taken before Judge Van Dyke, but the
writ was denied on the ground that it
would not be to the best ends of Jus
tice. This evening the Chief of Police
received another telegram from the
New York police department. Instruct
ing him to hold Forrest, as an officer
would start at once with the proper
requisition papers to bring him back
to New York State.
Full details cannot be obtained as to
the alleged offense with which Forrest
is charged, but it is given out in a gen
eral way that he is concerned in a stock
speculation which invi/lved a shortage
of $50,000.
Dr. Forrest came to this city some
years ago. He bore the best of creden
tials, and was admitted in the most
exclusive society circles. He was a
widower, and it was understood that
he was very wealthy. He married a
well-known Pasadena lady, formerly
Mtefl Katherlne Klmball. He pur
chased a handsome residence on Twen
ty-seventh street, in the very "ffwell
est" part of the city, and has been
since residing there with his wife. Un
til now there has not been the slightest
breath of BWSpldon that there was any
thing wrong with Dr. Forrest, and his
arrest comes as a great surprise to all,
and more particularly to his wife.
Further than stating that he will be
able \o honorably extricate himself
from nig present difficulty, Dr. Forrest
declines to talk.

THE FIGHT FOR HOME RULE
J. J. ClÂ«ncy, M. P., Writes an Interest
ing Review of thÂ« Struggle of
Statesmen in the Cause.
By J. J. CLANCY.
DUBLIN, March 6.â 1 have no doubt
that to many persons, but especially
to Irishmen on the American side of
the Atlantic, the name of Standish
O'Grady is very well known. He is a
country gentleman of the County of
Cork, a Protestant, and a Unionist,
who has distinguished himself in the
field of Irish history and Irish ro
mance, and is otherwise a man of
culture and refinement. Hitherto he
has not mixed much in politics, but,
If a little book of his which has just
appeared from the press and bears the
title of "All Ireland" be any guide to
his future, he is certain to be heard of
sooner or later as a leader of Irish
public opinion. What has stirred up
Mr. O'Grady is the movement for the
redress of the financial wrongs of Ire
land, and the brochure referred to
deals with that subject. But 1% is not
with the dry though vitally import
ant details of the financial question
that Mr. O'Grady troubles himself. He
;.- i nncerned with the movement in its
political effects on the Irish nation
itnJ makes it the text for an impas
sioned appeal for national unity. For
ionist he certainly writes in a re
markable strain. No Nationalist couid
write more strongly of English oppres
sion and mlsgovernment. Many of his
statements on that subject have a
flavor of the patriotism of the Irish
party, who won a free Parliament
for Ireland in 1752. â¢ One of the two
maxims on which his book is based
is that "England never yields to jus
tice, but always does to force." The
other maxim is that "Ireland united
is Ireland irresistible." On this latter
PQint he is a thoroughgoing disciple of
Parnell. The theory of the great Irish
leader was that the two great parties
m JPnglsLml have no principle or pur
pose except to get into office or keep
there; that they are both a conglom
eration of opportunity, governed en
tirely by motives of expediency; and
that they can be bought and sold or
B( at on errands by a bold and deter
mined Irish party with a national pur
in view. Hence he looked not to
English parties for success, but to his
own countrymen united in a common
< ause.
This is precisely the way in which
Mr. O'Grady also looks at things, and,
therefore, he counsels all Irishmen to
!>and themselves together on an issue
on which they can all unite without
sacrifice of principleâ the first issue of
the kind in his opinion which has arisen
for a hundred years. It is impossible
to exaggerate the fervor of his appeal,
especially that portion of it which is
addressed to his own class. It remains
to be seen what response will be made
t>> it. But that Mr. O'Grady means
to stick to his views is clear, and as
he has just purchased a newspaper â
a respectable Conservative journal, the
Kilkenny Moderator â he will have
plenty of opportunity to develop his
views. Unless lam greatly mistaken
he will, as I hava said, be heard of
again.
The destruction of#the Maine and
the possibilities of war resulting in con
sequence between the United States
and Spain are exciting intense interest
in Ireland. The conviction is pretty
general here that the explosion was
an outrage, and the hope is freely in
dulged that not only will reparation
be enforced but that the American
people will take this opportunity of
liberating Cuba.
It is not an exaggeration to say that
in any war undertaken by the republic
the sympathies of Ireland would go un
hesitatingly and whole-heartedly with
the starry flag. But to crush old-world
tyranny and root it utterly out of the
new world is an object that commends
itself specially to the Irish heart.
When the Independent, the organ of
the Independent Nationalist party, ex
pressed the other day the opinion that,
if the republic called on this occasion
for the help of its Irish citizens, they
'would in tens of thousands leap into
the very Tan of the army of libera
tion," it unquestionably gave expres
sion to genuine Irish feeling. Nor can
there be any doubt that, if war results,
there will be plenty of excitement here,
too, the more especially if England
takes, as it is so apt to do, the anti-
American view. Indeed, it will be a
very lively year in Ireland if the '98
celebrations should be accompanied by
pro-American and anti-Spanish demon
strations, and if the Irish-Americans
who are expected here a few months
hence in thousands should take part in
both.
An event which, for the last couple
of weeks, has excited intense feeling
not only in Dublin, but throughout Ire
land, will come off at next Monday's
m<-.-ting of the Dublin corporation. The
office of City Marshal is vacant and
one of the candidates is Mr. John How
ard Parnell, M. D., brother of the great
Irish leader. The fact that Mr. Par
nel! in compelled by stress of circnm
stances to seek such a post has itself
created a painful sensation, and it cer- I
tainly. dr.es no credit to Ireland. No
member of the Parnell family ought to
be left by the country in a position of
pecuniary embarrassment. Some time
ago, indeed, a movement was set on
foot for the benefit of the family and
for the purpose of preserving for it. the
ancestral home in Avondale; but from
one cause or another it was not suc
cessful.
The distracted state of Irish parties
prevented a successful issue, and now
Mr. Parnell, as I have said, is obliged
to seek an office in the gift of the cqr
poration of Dublin. As I write it seems
doubtful whether or not he is looking
for it in vain. If the members of the
corporation were voting openly instead
of by ballot there could be no doubt of
the result. Public opinion would "be too
etrong for almost any man among
them. But they vote by ballot in the

making of appointments, and though
three-fourths of the entire body pro
fess to be Parnellites in politics, it is
feared that personal and private in
stead of national and public considera
tions will weigh with as many of them
as will suffice to carry a candidate who
has no public claims whatever on any
public body. However, we shall see.
An interesting action at law will be
tried Wednesday in one of the Chan
cery Courts. For some years before the
split in the Irish ranks Patrick O'Brien,
who is now member for the city of Kil
kenny and is one of John Redmonds
most active folllowers, was member, tor
the north division of the County of
Monaghan. Ever since he has been in
politicsâ and that is now a good many
yearsâ he has been a bold and deter
mined Irish Nationalist, always in the
thick of every fight and never shirking
the consequences. As a matter of fact,
he has been in jail for his political opin
ions seven or eight times during the
last twelve years, sometimes enduring
the plank bed and prison fare for six
months at a time. For this reason he
was a great tavorite in Monaghan, as
THE SA^T FKAISTCISCO CALL, STJKDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
he is now with all parties In the House
of Commons, and toward the close of
the year 1889 his then constituents
made up for him, as he was a poor man.
a small sum of money in recognition of
his services.
This money was about to be present
edâand in fact, all preparations had
been made for the presentationâ when
one of his periodical imprisonments
took place and the ceremony had to be
postponed. Soon after the Parnell
crisis supervened. The Monaghan peo
j pie to a man took Parnell's side.
: They held meeting after meeting, at
! which the strongest resolutions were
1 passed in support of Parnell's lead
ership. Mr. O'Brien was in jail
i and could not speak, but it soon leaked
out that he was what was called a
rampant Parnellite. The Monaghan
people, however, like so many others,
changed their minds in the course of a
i few weeks, and required their repre
sentative to change with them.
But they mistook their man who,
] when he emerged from his six months'
! imprisonment, at once threw himself
heart and soul into the Parnellite cam
i paign. The consequence was that the
money collected for him was never
given to nim, the ground being that he
had broken his pledge "to sit, act and
vote with the majority of the Irish
party." After six years he has com
menced a suit to recover it, and it is
this action which is to be tried on
Wednesday next by the Vice-Chancellor.
It will, I imagine, excite a good deal
of interest and so will the result.
The present Government has not up
to the present resorted to coercion in
the management of Irish affairs, but,
as a counterblast (I suppose) to his
local government proposals, Mr. Gerald
Balfour has this week, by condoning
and indeed approving of a gross police
outrage in Mayo, indicated pretty clear
ly that at any moment we may have a
return to that exploded and senseless
policy. The facts of the case are very
simple. There is a movement at pres
ent in the neighborhood of Westport in
the county referred to against the
"grabbing" of grass farmsâ a local ris
ing, in other words, against the policy
of keeping large and fruitful tracts of
land for sheep and cattle while thou
sands of human beings are huddled to
gether on little patches which scarcely
afford potatoes enough for six months
of the year.
Recently a man named Duffy
"grabbed" one of these grass farms,
and the consequence was that he be
came an object of public detestation,
which ultimately resulted in some
manifestations for which several peo
ple were prosecuted. A few days ago
the grabber appeared at the prosecu
tion, and, of course, there was a crowd
to meet him, which groaned him vigor
ously, and at which he fired a revolver
shot in return. Instead of arresting
Duffy, the police proceeded to baton
the crowd, which, but for the groaning,
was perftectly peaceable; and when Mr.
Balfour was called on to explain this
police outrage in the House of Com
mons last night he defended and
praised the police outright, while act
ually admitting that the facts were as
stated.
This is a pretty development of his
policy of "killing home rule with kind
ness." It is, indeed, intelligible if his
object be to provoke a renewal of dis
turbance in Ireland. Otherwise it Is
both unintelligible and stupid; and. if
it should be followed by similar dis
turbances, Mr. Balfour may rest as
sured that he will have plenty of trou
ble on his hands before long.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
RIVERSIDE, March 19.â The Sheriff's
office Is In receipt of a communication
from a resident of El Cajon, In San Diego
County, which would seem to settle the
identity of the man whose body was found
on the river bottom near this c:*y last
December. He is said to be Bernardi
Cota, a miner, who has worked in the
mines at Julian, in that county, and also
on ranches around El Cajon.
Cota left El Cajon about the Ist of last
December for the Klondike, and since
his departure has not been heard from.
When he left he had Quite a sum of
money in his possession, and his friends,
who have been led to identify him by a
â¢photograph and descriptive circular sent
out by the Sheriff a few weeks ago, are
of the opinion he was followed by some
one in that vicinity who knew of his be
ing possessed of funds.
The officers here are of the opinion that
the mystery has been cleared. As the
body was found on the Bth of December,
the dates seem to agree.
Cota was an Italian and the dead man
found bore the appearance of being of
that nationality.

THE WOMfIN AND THE CATS.
THERE is an Eastern publication at hand with
an illustration of the peculiar form of brutality
to which devotion to fashion has driven one
woman. This woman happens* to be a Countess.
That she happens also to be a monstrosity in no man
ner interferes with her right to set the styles and ex
cite the envy of others.
The illustration shows her clad in a cape adorned
with the heads of fifty cats, slain for the purpose of
thus bedecking her in a manner at once barbaric and
beastly. It is not too much to say that any one of
these cats while living was of more value to the world
than the lady herself. At least they could catch mice,
and mice steal cheese, while the limit of her usefulness
seems to have been expressed in contriving a novel
scheme whereby to demonstrate herself a heartless
cieaturc so weak of mind that only gallantry restrains
the natural impulse to call her a fool.
It would serve this freak rightly if the wraiths of
her victims were to howl every' night throughout the
apartments where she keeps their heads among the
other treasures of her wardrobe. They should haunt
her dreams, and when at last she shall be summoned
to another world there ought to be fringing the out
most shore of the same a row r of grinning phantom
cats each displaying the ghost of a set of teeth.
But Judge Campbell is not blameless. He declared
the domestic cat to be a wild animal, and "by this time
his decision could have been cabled to Europe. Sure
enough the cat is being treated with no more con
sideration than the marten or the mink.
WHERE WOMEN GAMBLE.
Y^ ISS MICHELSON'S description in The Call
/ \ on Friday morning of scenes in four notorious
* poolrooms '"where women gamble" was at
once a news item, a literary picture of one of the
dramatic phases of life in this city and a sermon for
the community at' large. The news was not wholly i
novel, but in the aggregate it was startling; the pic- j
ture was as vivid as a Rembrandt masterpiece with its s
lights and shadows brought out by the contrast be- j
tween the women themselves and the places to which j
they had been brought by the mad spirit of gambling,
and the sermon was what San Francisco shall make
of it.
This is not the first time the authorities and the
good people of the city have been informed that pool
rooms in which women gamble on the races are run
more or less openly. Over and over again in the
course of its long crusade against poolrooms The
Call has published that fact as an evidence of the ex
tent to which the pernicious effects of this illicit and
nefarious trade have pervaded the community. This
time, however, we have given the evil a fuller and
more forcible exposure than ever before, and even
those who are most careless of public and private
morality so long as it does not affect them personally
can hardly remain indifferent any longer to this
blighting curse that falls upon all classes â men and
women, youth and age â alike.
In the poolrooms where women gamble there are
women of all kinds. Miss Michelson says: "There
isn't a type missing. There are women of 70 and girls
of 17. There are women in sealskins and shabby,
poverty-stricken women; women wno are spending
money earned most shamefully and women who have
scrubbed and washed and swept and drudged in other
people's houses for their pittance. There are repre
sentatives from all grades of society. There are re
fined, sweet voices and also those strident accents that
are not out of place in such surroundings. There are
well-educated women there, and those whose sen
tences are fluent only when they are expressing them
selves in the jargon of the racetrack."
All these types of women are marked by the sign
characteristic of those on whose weakness or
viciousness the professional gambler lives. The evi
dence of a spirit of greed, of a desire for some gain
they have not earned is on the faces of them all. Rich
or poor, young or old, refined or coarse, they have a
common bond between them in that mad longing to
get something for nothing which makes them the
willing victims of the poolseller, the easy prey of any
smart rascal that offers them a chance to bet.
It is useless to reason with these unhappy creatures.
To get a chance to gamble they will go anywhere,
visit any sort of a place, congregate in any kind of a
den. Moreover, as a general rule it is only a ques
tion of time when they will resort to any sort of prac
tice to obtain money to gamble with. Each in her
way will exert an influence upon the women around
her. and particularly upon those younger than her
self. A thousand reasons, therefore, call for the im
mediate suppression of the poolrooms. The offense
is monstrous. The punishment should be as swift and
as severe as justice has it in her power to give.
ITonore Lame has gone to the trouble to swear to
his story concerning Weyler, but it gains little
strength from this circumstance. Something more
than "a hope to die" affidavit would be needed to
place any statement fathered by Honore firmly on a
pedestal of truth.
THE ANNEXATION RESOLUTION.
IT should be noted that the annexation resolution
offered by the Senate Committee contains none of
the reservations that were boasted as prime features
of the treaty. There is no abrogation of existing
treaties between Hawaii and other countries. Even
the shadowy restriction of the immigration of Asiatic
coolies to Hawaii has disappeared. The resolution
simply extends the sovereignty of the United fflfcites
to the islands.
The Hawaiian treaties under which coolie contract
labor now fills the islands are left in force. When
sovereignty is exchanged without restriction it car
ries over from the abrogated to the acquired juris
diction all of its treaties, contracts and
obligations. When the sovereignty of France expired
in the empire and was transferred to the republic no
treaty fell by the wayside in the exchange. The new
sovereignty acquired them all, with their obligations
and burdens.
So we take Hawaii, under the joint resolution, for
better or for worse, debts, treaties, contract labor and
all, and make it a part of our territory, to be gov
erned under an undisclosed system, which may either
set up inequality of law between that and the rest
of our domain or may extend to the rest of the coun
try the labor system and other things now unknown
to us which inhere in "the peculiar conditions" of
that country.
Will the annexation press tell us what has become
of the boasted restrictions, reservations and safe
guards of the treaty, without which they were but re
cently admitting that annexation would not be de
sirable?
This whole matter must be stripped now of its dis
guise and pretense. The debate must be in the open.
The inquiry into the constitutionality of the joint
resolution must be complete. As appears now it
cannot be vindicated out of the text or spirit of the
constitution. As this republic exists on a written con
stitution, which grants to it all of the powers and
authority it may exercise, that constitution is to be
the test of our right to exercise sovereignty in j
Hawaii. Suppose that by this joint resolution we as
sume such sovereignty and a test 'is made, as it will
be. by the refusal of a citizen to acknowledge our
authority de jure in the islands. Such test must go to
the Supreme Court for decision. That bench must
decide whether the constitution has been followed in
annexation. Does any one believe that it will find
warrant for this proposition in the constitution? It
so, where? The burden of proof is on the annexa
tionists. They have so debauched logic in their ar
guments that they have trained themselves for de- '
bnuchery of the written law. Why don't they pro- I
ceed? From the standpoint of the fundamental law
we cannot take Hawaii because it is "a paradise of
the Pacific," nor because we are strong enough to take
it any way. nor because it is a round in the ladder of
manifest destiny. This Government has no power,
no destiny, no right, outside of its constitution. A
thing may be desirable, or expedient, or ambitious,
but we derive no right from any of these reasons.
Our sole derivation is from the constitution. Is it
possible that Benton and Clay. Thurman and Ed
munds, jnd all the great lawyers and expounders of
the constitution have been wrong in their declara
tion that Congress may only admit new States, while
new territory may be annexed only by treaty?
NEWS FROM TME YUKON.
BY far the most comprehensive and most detailed
account of affairs on the Yukon and the condi
tion of the miners and other adventurers there
which has been received since the winter set in is that
which has just come from our special correspondent,
Sam \Y. Wall. His report covers the whole of
the vast region along the river from Dawson to Fort
Yukon, and gives information not only of the district
generally, but of the individual men and women who
are, wintering at the various camps or posts from
Dawson down to the Fort.
This information was not gathered at second hand.
Mr. Wall, in whom journalistic enterprise is an in
stinct and the search for news an aspiration akin to
that which prompts the man of science to dare all
dangers and take all risks for the sake of discovering
truth, started from Dawson in the middle of the
Arctic winter to make the journey to Fort Yukon for
the purpose of finding out the condition of the people
there and making it known through The Call to their
friends in all parts of the Union.
This dangerous task so willingly undertaken marks
the difference between the true newsgatherer and the
mere faker. It would have been much safer and
more comfortable for Mr. Wall to have remained at
Dawson all winter wrapped in warm furs. It would
have been easier to write rumors of the lower river
and construct fakes than to go down the frozen
stream and find the truth. He chose the hazard, the
difficulty, the discomfort and the danger for the sake
of learning the truth, and the result of his efforts is
that The Call has been able to carry to many anxious
hearts news of their loved ones from whom they have
not heard for months.
Mr. Wall reports, with notes of what they are
doing as far as he could obtain the information, the
names of all persons registered at Fort Yukon* at
Rampart City or Minook, at Circle City and at
Woodworth. These names fill more than two closely
printed columns of The Call. They constitute the
great bulk of those who were caught on the way to
Dawson by the freezing of the river or who went
down to the Fort to escape the danger of famine at
Dawson when it became known there would be a
scarcity of food at that place if all remained there.
This journey in midwinter to Fort Yukon is the
second notable feat accomplished by Mr. Wall along
the Yukon. The first was when he made his way up
the stream in the fall to earn' to the people at Daw
son the news that the water in the river was low and
that the expected steamers would not be able to bring
full cargoes of food to Dawson. That journey en
rbled him to give warning to the Dawson people in
time for many of them to get away and thus averted
the threatened famine. The" second feat accomplished
by the journey down the river 13 hardly less useful
since it gives reliable news of the snowbound adven
turers to their friends at home.
At the time The Call dispatched Mr. Wall to the
Klondike it announced that it would be represented
in the geld fields by a* newspaper man and not a
f.iker or a mere word monger. The promise of The
Call to its readers has been more than fulfilled. It is
represented along the Yukon by one of the heroes of
journalism, and as a consequence its reports are
worth more to the general public than those of any
other prper, and to the friends and relatives of the
men- and women who made the rush last fall they "are
inv.iluible.
If Miles thinks San Francisco a Gibraltar it -is plain
the common impression concerning Gibraltar is based
on error. The belief that that place would be difficult
to assault and easy to hold had become almost
general. /
The value of the confession department of a news
paper would be a good theme for discussion at some
college of journalism.
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
CONTEMPT OF THE FAKER.
THE action of Judge Cook in sending Attorney
Mclntosh to jail for contempt of court and in
commending his case and that^of his "confes
sion" confederate, Edgar B. Haymond, to the Bar
Association for further consideration will be hailed
with satisfaction by all respectable people. There is
no doubt that Mclntosh and Haymond should be dis
barred. Centainly men who trifle with the adminis
tration of the law, as it has been proved that they
trifled with it in the Hoff case, are unfit to practice
law. The Bar Association owes the duty to itself and
the people of the State of giving the charges against
these young men full consideration and of commenc
ing disbarment proceedings if they shall be found
guilty of unprofessional conduct.
Judge Cook's opinion â which, by the way, is a
model of logical and vigorous English â discovers a
strong grasp upon the law and facts of the Mclntosh
case. We do not know whether the doctrine of inter
ference which he so clearly illustrates can be made
legally to apply to all the parties who attempted to
traffic in the "confession" of Hoff. but that it ought
to apply there is no question. The evidence in the
Mclntosh case shows that the reporters and editors
of the Mission street faker negotiated in good faith
for Hoff's "confession." There is little doubt that had
they not been checkmated by the murderer himself,
or had the price asked not been too high,
they would have closed for the document and pre
sented it to their readers.
Had the publication taken place, according to
Judge Cook, all the editors, reporters and printers of
the yellow sheet would have been guilty of contempt.
To send them to jail it only would have been neces
sary to establish that any juror, or person drawn for
a juror, had read the "confession." Why, then, were
not the efforts of the yellow sheet to procure a "con
fession" an interference with the proceedings of the
court? Had the confession expert of the paper not
encouraged Mclntosh to believe that Hoff's state
ment of his guilt was a merchantable commodity that
individual would not have committed the contempt
for which he has been jailed. In other words, Mc
lntosh interfered with the cause of justice at the in
stigation of the yellow journal's confession depart
ment. Why are not the conductors of that depart
ment just as guilty of contempt as their fool scape
goat. Mclntosh?
Judge Cook has the reputation of being an able
and conscientious lawyer. He is known to possess
courage and determination of a high order. There is
nothing of the trimmer or demagogue in his com
position. He is just the man to establish the pre
cedent in this city that when yello-.v journalism de
serts faking and begins to seriously interfere with the
administration of justice its devotees must be locked
up. We are confident that the Mission street faker is
morally guilty of interfering with the course of jus
tice in the Hoff case. Mclntosh would never have
offered a "confession" for sale had he not thought
the sheet presented him with a markrt. But can the
faker be proved legally guilty? This is a question
we are compelled to leave to Judge Cook's decision.
LOQ3L GOVERNMENT IN IRELAND.
> HE CALL published yesterday from its special
correspondent, J. J. Gancy, M. P., a review of
the measure proposed by the British Ministry
for reforming local government in Ireland, accom
panied by a forecast of the probable effects of the bill
upon political parties in Ireland anil upon the general
affairs of the people whose local interests will be af
fected by it.
Mr. Clancy, as a member of Parliament represent
ing an Irish constituency and a strong advocate of
home rule, is well fitted to speak on this subject with
authority. His words express something more than
a mere personal opinion. What he says may be fairly
regarded as the prevailing opinion of Irish leaders on
the subject, and for that reason his letter to The Call
is of the highest value to all who wish an intelligent
understanding of the proposed legislation for Ire
land at this session of Parliament and the attitude of
the Irish leaders toward it.
Mr. Clancy regards the measure proposed as a vast
improvement on the existing system of local govern
ment. At the present time county affairs in Ireland
are administered by bodies which, as Mr. Clancy
says, are almost wholly unrepresentative. The Bal
four bill will give to Ireland a system of county gov
ernment similar to that which prevails now in Eng
land and Scotland, and which will .enable the majority
of the people for the first time to elect their own
county councilmen.
The effect of this will be something like a political
revolution, for according to Mr. Clancy the result
must be in all parts of the land outside of Ulster, and
in all but two or three counties even in that province,
to exclude from the councils the so-called loyal
minority. This does not mean that none of the for
mer administrators will be elected, for it is the judg
ment of our correspondent that if they submit them
selves for election as business men of experience in
local control they may elect some of their party and
retain considerable power in local affairs, but they
can never hope for a monopoly of it any longer.
The new measure, while remedying some of the
evils of British rule in Ireland, will not close the ac
count by any means. With the Salisbury Ministry in
office nothing can be expected for home rule at this
session of Parliament, but that great issue still domi
nates the Irish situation. In every general election it
comes to the front, and in all Parliamentary contests
in Ireland it is the crucial test to which the con
stituencies submit all candidates who appear before
them. This struggle in Ireland has been perennially
interesting to Americans, and The Call can with jus
tice congratulate its readers on being able to furnish
them a record of the progress of the movement at
this juncture from a correspondent so gifted and so
eminent as Mr. Clancy.
There h reason to regret that one of the lawyers
who did so much to prevent the punishment of the
most celebrated murderer California has had in re
cent years has appeared in the Flannelly case. His
presence there will be taken as an indication that
justice is likely to stumble over a lot of ridiculous
but impeding technicalities before finally dropping
Flannelly.
It may have been noted that the European powers
now engaged in making monstrous demands upon
China have refrained from asking the United States
as to the propriety of doing so. However, they find
time to pause long enough in their schemes to loot
to tell the United States how Spain ought to be
treated.
An evening paper presents som: statements which
it labels in large type, "True Facts." It is with no de
sire to be captious we make the suggestion that a
fact possessing the element of veracity gains much of
its real character and value from this circumstance.
Spanish papers at Havana are saying mean things
about the people of this country, but they cannot be
blamed for it. It must have been noticed that the
papers of the United States are not projecting floral
tributes in the direction of the Spanish press.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
By. HENRY JAMES.
A gentleman who writes for the San
Jose News gently corrects me for ob
jecting to the action of an Oakland
Judge in having discharged a man
guilty of wife beating, because the vic
tim of the beating had asked it. But
I find upon reading his article that we
agreed remarkably well. His idea is
that wife beaters deserve severe pun
ishment. He wants them haled to
the whipping post. Where we differ
is as to the adequate penalty. I would
have them haled to the nearest lamp
post and hanged.

The case of Colonel Finegan of San
Rafael is of peculiar Interest as show
ing how a man with money can make
a monkey of the dignity of the law.
Finegan claims to be a pauper. He
asserts that he is unable to pay his
divorced wife the alimony she /de
mands and the courts uphold him in
his absurd position. Finegan has
plenty of money to supply himself with
the luxuries of life. That he is a
pauper nobody believes, least of all
himself. It seems to me that even if
the ex-wife cannot have her dues there
ought to be some way of sending Fine
gan back to Jail.

It is a rare pleasure to be able to
agree with the Evening Post, and I
avail myself of the opportunity. Its
position as to the lnutility of send
ing missionaries to China is unassail
able. If missionaries abroad have ever
done any good I have failed to hear
of it. For them to go to China and
try to tell the people there what is a
suitable form of religion for them has
always seemed to me a distinct im
pertinence. While they occasionally
have trouble, the marvel is that they
do not have more. They deserve to
be led to the border and firmly kicked
in the direction of home. Millions of
dollars are wasted in trying to "save
the souls" of the Chinese before we
have any good evidence that the Chi
nese have souls, or that the quality of
soul they may have is worth saving.
Certainly the Chinese Christian as
known in this country is a fraud, us
ing his piety as a cloak, and as an ex
cuse for making love to some suscepti
ble teacher, who perhaps marries him
and goes into the business of rearing
half-breeds. I do not believe that
since the dawn of Christianity a sin?
gle Chinese was ever won over to it,
and I do not believe it of the slight
est importance that any should be. 1
say this with the greatest respect for
the opinions of those who differ from
me. They have the same right to their
opinions I have to mine.
Perhaps It -will not be amiss to say a
pleasant word about Attorneys Mcln
tosh and Haymond. If ever there ap
peared again.;t the local horizon two
fellows more frankly knaves than thesÂ«
I chanced to miss the sight. It seems
that they were engaged to defend
against the charge of murder a man
known as Hoff. This is only a part
of his name, but it may serve to iden
tify him. They entered Into a scheme
for Belling a "confession" of their
client, and peddled it assiduously de-
Spite the averments of their client that
tie had nothing to confess. Aside from
the intrinsic villainy of the scheme
must be considered the reflection it
constituted upon the law they ara
sworn to uphold. Their idea seems
to have been to sell the man's declar
ation of guilt and devote the proceeds
to lining their pockets, and incidentally
to proving the prisoner an innocent
liar. If their course watt not an in
sult to the public, and particularly to
the court, there is no such thing as
an insult. If It was not an attempted
swindle, then the man who sells a gold
brick made of brass is an angel of
guilelessness. Think of taking- the
money derived from a confession of
guilt and using part of it to establish
the fact that the confession was falsa,
or that being true, the statutes were
powerless to punish the culprit. My
congratulations to the gentlemanly
scoundrels; not that they deserve con
gratulations particularly, but note must
be taken of the fact that at least one
of them is still out of jail.
It is necessary for me as part of the
daily routine to ride in the Jackson
street car, leaving the foot of Powell
street a little after 6 in the evening
About one time in ten it is my blessed
privilege to occupy a seat. The other
nine times I go swaying over the hills
while hanging on to a strap, wishing
cordially that the management of the
road could be hanged to something
which withheld the privilege of teaching
the ground. The only reason more cars
are not provided is stinginess, abetted
by the natural gallantry of men. There
are few men who can ride in a seat con
scious that in the same car, and per
haps emitting reproachful glances,
there are ladies maintaining with diffi
culty a footing on the constantly
changing slant of the floor. So the man
gets up, tips his hat, and perhaps his
courtesy is ac* nowledged. Now, I be
lieve tha* to surrender a seat is wrong,
excepting of course in the case of old
people and invalids. As a matter of
fact a woman is just as able to stand
as a man. The impulse not to permit
her to do so is working a hardship on
the community. A man will say on his
bobbing legs for a mile and never
grumble, but let him learn that his wife
or daughter has had similar experience
and there will be no end to his indig
nation, while the Indignation of the
woman will be an actual rage. The les
son is plain. The only way to get more
cars is to allow the feminine patrons to
take equal chances with the masculine.
Then there will be a storm of wrath
breaking about the head of Vining, and
perhaps the impact will be sufficient to
beat an idea into it, with the result that
in time the needed cars will be provided.
Meanwhile let every lady who fails to
scure a sea console herself wth the
thought that the men are acting like
swine, not because they wish to, but be
cause of a high and holy principle.
Having pondered over the matter for
several days, I am still of the opinion
that the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company ' as no more right to the
|5 deposit exacted from customers than
a footpad has to the purse he takes at
the pistol's point. Also that the morals
actuating the two processes of .rob
bery are on the same plane, ihe latter
point might be termed irrelevant, but
readers may have noticed that the for
mer is to be tested in court. Every day
somebody relates to me a tale of fraud
committed by this concer- with its
army of trained meters. Not long ago
a friend rented a furnished -ouse. the
.owner having already the $5 on deposit.
It did not seem necessary either to
landlady or tenant to explain this
change to the gas reople, the circum
stances being, with an apparent show
of reason, deemed none of their busi
ness. When my friend paid his first
month's bill the company discovered
that there was a new occupant at the
number and at once demanded another
$5. The landlady told them that her $5
could remain to represent the house;
but this did not satisfy them. They
still clamored for the double security,
saying that if it was not forthcoming
the gas would be shut off. Three days
later they sent a man up to shut off the
gas, and my friend then paid the $5.
This is what the company is pleased to
term a "voluntary" contribution. I am
pleased to ten., it an example of imper
tinence, imposition and theft, and I
have as much right as the company to
be pleased. Yet after the transaction
noted the landlady had much trouble to
get back her original $5, having to visit
the office several times, and this when
the office was awi.y down in Tar Flat,
not easy to reach nor attractive to see.
All this leaves out of consideration the
reckless charges made for gas never
consumed, the wretched quality of the
light, the deadly character of the
suicide-promoting fluid, and the boor
ishness with which every complaint,
however just, is invariably met.
The present law against opium smok
ing ia worse than none. Under ita
puerile restrictions the police are help
less, for if they take any action the
courts at once nullify It and make the
efforts of the officers appear ridiculous.
It would be a better plan to wipe out
the law and encourage the dope fiends
to smoke their shriveled carcasses off
the earth which their presence now in
a measure robs of joy.
While the affair Is none of my busi
ness, I cannot help feeling sorry that
two doctors should have sued the es
tate of a rich man for a sum over $23,
000. As representatives of a profession
useful, necessary and generally honor
able, their action constitutes a grave
reflection upon the craft. It appears
from the complaint that they were in
attendance upon the man just one
month, at the end of which period he
died. What may have been the rela
tionship between their ministrations
and his taking off does not particularly
matter. It may be taken for granted
that he had the benefit of the highest
skill; that in the absence of the care
he received he would not have been
permitted to linger so long as thirty
days, and yet I do not believe the doc
tors earned any such amount as "$23,000
or that they think they did. If, hav
ing been called to treat a rich man
stricken with malady they had brought
him back from the gates of death the
element of gratitude would have en
tered into the settlement, and had he
chosen to write them a check for $50,000
apiece, there would have been no cause
for complaint. But I contend that med
ical services, covering but one month,
and then terminated by death, could
not possibly have any such value as
the doctors have chosen to place upon
them. They coula not have had this
value If the doctors had abandoned all
their other practice and devoted them
selves exclusively to the patient. When
one has taken to the bed of pain from
which he is never to arise the boon of
dragging out to thirty days an exist
ence that might have terminated in
less does, not seem to me to be.con
siderable. It assuredly is not worth
such a fortune as many worthy and in
dustrious men toll vainly for during an
entire lifetime.
An Oakland correspondent, evidently
sharing the disesteem it has been my
duty to express toward the Board of
Education, sends me a clipping from
The Outlook, a New York publication of
standing and dignity. Such is the savor
of decay thrown off lay this precious
board that it has been detected as far
away as the Atlantic seaboard. Prob
ably there is not another body any
where, supposed to be devoted to the
Interests of education and so utterly
neglecting them; supposed to be on a
lofty plane, yet so reeking with the
overflow of an internal rot. That the
board is a nuisance and disgrace, that
the good in it is powerless against the
evil, that some of its members deserve
to be in the penitentiary, there is no
question. Some who are not vicious are
actually and painfully ignorant, with
not the slightest conception of what
their duties are, the slightest desire to
find out or the slightest ability to per
form them. The Outlook passes by the
Waller and the Ragan with their en
vironments of scandal and takes up the
Drucker, whom it regards as a queer
specimen, whose openly avowed prac
tices should be classified as criminal.
"It keeps us busy looking after our j
friends," Drucker had said when dis- ,
cussing the matter of appointments. I
"Each director appoints his own friends
and relatives," continued this modern
exponent of educational methods, ap
parently without a thought or care that
by the words he 'was confessing him
self one of a band of shameless knaves.
School directors have no right to have
"friends" such as must be provided for

Perhaps the confession department
of the Examiner will retire from bus
iness now that it has been brought
into the glare of judicial publicity and
made everybody connected with it con
tribute to the grins of an appreciative
people. In the first place the "con
fessions" wrested by hypnotism and
cajolery from the unwilling bosoms of
the wicked possess neither interest nor
value. This was shown first in the
case of Clarke, the St. Helena freak
who killed his brother, and under the
promises of a chronic confessor, who
goes about loaded with crocodile tears
and a thumb-worn Bible, told all about
it Clarke was fairly dying to take
the world into his confidence. He want
|ed to make 5 a clean breast of it to
whoever happened along, and would
have done so voluntarily, but the con
fessor.^ndihisi bribes were there and
their .^Aesence i did nothing but vitiate
the statement of Clarke. In the Be
lew instance similar measures were
used, but nothing exacted which had
n'ot^beeh]ip'rinted several days before
llnWÃKtt, obtained under circum-
I stancei^which lent it value as evi
dence. The Hoff matter is the latest.
This has brought the members of two
professions into ridicure and disrepute.
The idea of springing a Bible on a
creature like Hoff and of offering him
: $10,000 for a confession is an absurdity.
! Nothing Hoff could possibly tell would
be worth this sum or any other. That
such an offer was made is a demon
stration that it was made in bad faith
so far as payment was. concerned. The
ludicrous side of it all is too manifest
to be ignored. An attorney dickering
with a journalist in the hope of selling
to him ' a hand-made confession, but
meanwhile carefully guarding against
the possibility, of being drugged by the
Journalist, is something to go thunder

BUSH-STREET BOULEVARD.
To the Editor of The Call: The Bush,
street boulevard .burlesque is again exclt
; ing the risibilities of those people who
i have given any thought at all to the mat
ter. That the scheme could be seriously
considered by any one is farcicalâ Bush
I street is so dearth of all natural advan

! way. It is so narrow it wouiu admit of
neither good walks, shade trees or a
good roadway. The grade in some places
is altogether too steep for bitumen. Bush
street is a short street, passes no places
of interest, no public buildings, and has
jno fine residences; there are no quod

I nowhere and ends likewise, unless a
i short cut to a cemetery be the great de
! siderium.
It should be quite enough to condemn

'â â  boulevard fantasy. How ridiculous would
â  this San Francisco boulevard appear in
comparison with the boulevards of other
' large cities! me street, for the most

intended for traffic on the Yukon River. One of the steam schooners is be

remote from the scenes of activity. The
policy of preparation adopted by the Gov
ernment embraces, however, the protec
tion of this harbor. It wouid not do to
expose the Union Iron Works, where the
battle-ship Wisconsin is in course of con
struction, or allow the important naval
station at Mare Island to become exposeu
to the raids of an enemy.
The Oregon sailed for Callao at high
water yesterday morning. The superb
battle-ship passed out the Golden Gate
shortly after 8 o'clock and Hireeted her
course south. There will be no effort to
break the record for speed in ships of her
class, but she may shorten the allotted
time of sixteen days to Callao from San
Francisco.
There is no longer a doubt that the offi
cers of the engineer corps of the Pacific
division are at work in arranging lor ef
fective use the vast quantity of torpedo
material stored at Goat Inland station.
One reason that the engineers have for
withholding information on the subject is
the fear that a knowledge of preparation
tn resist attack may cause alarm in the
community. The army people have queer
notions about the timidity of the civilian
class and the dangers that may result
from excitement over war preparations.
Recently there has been a great demand
for electricians. Many men who possess
but slight knowledge of electricity have
found remunerative employment at Mare

demand for expert electrician* is very*
great at the present time.

is ready for the ordnance.
General Shatter, in his laiU annual re
port to the adjutant-general <>f the
army, says that, in view of the progress
of the fortification work at Lime Point
and the turning over to the department
commander of the armament now in
place it has been necessary to establish
a battery of artillery there for the care
and preservation of the guns. This bat
tery should be pkieed in barracks, and
he "recommended that two unoccupied
barracks from the Presidio be moved to
Lime Point. It was expected that long
before this the troops stationed tnere
would be fairly comfortably housed in
the two frame structures that had
sheltered soldiers at the Presidio for
many years past. When, however, the
fortification board, of which Colonel
John I. Rodgers was president, visited
the Pacific Coast and submitted its re
port to the Secretary of War, recqm
mpnding that permanent and good build
ings be constructed at the different
coast defense points, it was seÂ«-n that
the question of removing old barracks
from the Presidio to Lime Point rould
not be considered, and the matter of re
moval was dropped.
The War Department intends to ap
propriate a sufficient sum of the $2.000/'OO
allotted by the Secretary of War for the
construction of barracks at coast forts.
to build two double brick barracks at
Lime Point similar to the new brick
barracks recently erected at the Pre-

Bidio. These two barracks will comfort
ably accommodate four batteries of ar
tillery. Besides the barracks it will be
necessary to erect officers' quarters and
other buildings that are necessary at a
post, such as quartermaster and com
missary storehouses, guardhouse, bak
ery, stables, etc. It is expected that this
work will be hurried to completion, and
that this important defense point will
be properly paxrisoned. At present Bat
tery L, Third Artillery, Captain William
K. Birkhimer commanding, is stationed
at Lime Point. The other officers sta
tioned there are Second Lieutenant Rob
ert S. Abernethy and Captain Euclid B.
Frick, assistant surgeon United States

Captain Joseph M. Califf's Light Bat

Miley of General Shafter's staff, who
were detailed to select a good range,

The settlers promised to supply the army
with many necessary articles free of cost.
and manifested a deep interest in the
proposed target praticc. The light bat
teries will march to the range and prob
ably go through Pacheco Pass to the San
Joaquin Valley.
Infantry soldiers of the armyâ officers
and enlisted men who walk and fightâ are
pleased over the prospect that the bill
to reorganize the army will be passed at
this session of Congress. The artillery
and cavalry are organized on the three
battalion plan, and the same regulation,
they hold, should apply to the infantry.
The plan was recommended by Generals
â¢ Irant, Sherman, Sheriuan and Schofield,
and is now advocated by General Miles
and every other progressive military man
in the service. At department headquar
ters in this city and at the Presidio the
intelligence from Washington is gratify
ing.
The army of the United States now
consists of seven regiments of artillery.
ten regiments of cavalry and twenty-five
regiments of infantry. The entire force,
including the two new regiments of ar
tillery, does not exceed in number 27,000
men.
The reorganization of each infantry
regiment into three battalions of four
companies each wil require for each regi
ment two more majors, two captains, two
first lieutenants, and two second lieu
tenants This adds 200 officers to the ex
isting number, but the infantry becomes
so organized that the force of menâ
1200 to a regiment on a peace footingâ
may be increased to a regimental strength
of. 2400 on a war footing, without further
increasing the number of officers. Under
the new system the infantry strength
could be expanded to 60.000 troops without
any addition to the number of regimental
officers. Army officers figure that the
country has almost doubled in population
since there has heen any increase to
speak of in the standing army.

How the Pacific Coast's Commerce

The following letter received from
Minister Barrett, at Slam, throws out
many valuable suggestions to mer
chants who are desirous of bettering
the trade conditions of the Pacific
Coast. Mr. Barrett has been In Asia
for many years, and has made a care
ful study of the trade conditions. His
prophecy Is that if the proper attention
were paid to the trade of the far East
the Pacific Coast would rival the At
lantic in wealth and population. What
Western Europe is to the Atlantic,
Eastern Asia may soon become to the
Pacific. His letter is as follows:
UNITED STATES LEGATION
BANGKOK, Siam, Feb. 1. IS9B.
To the Editor of the San Fran
olpco Call, U. S. A.â Sir: In the
interest aroused by the Klondike
grold discoveries and the agitation
to develop closer commercial rela
tions between San Francisco and
Alaska, I trust that the exporters,
manufacturers and business men of
San Francisco and the Pacific Coast
are not going to neglect the magnifi
cent opportunity that awaits their
best efforts in the Far East.
My attention has been called to one
of your recent editorials, in which
you discussed the importance of our
trade -with Asia, but it seems to me
that you do not state the case as
strongly as it permits. The subject
is well worthy of repeated emphasis
in your columns, and all of us who
have studied this trans-Pacific field
hope and pray that not only The
Call, but the other papers on the Pa
cific Coast, w.. use their influence
for the advancement of American in
terests In the Far East.
The Klondike is undoubtedly de
serving: of thorough exploitation, and
the enterprise of San Francisco mer
chants is to be highly commended,
but there are in the Pacific and the
Far East markets whose present
value to the Pacific Coast far ex
ceeds those of Alaska, and whose fu
ture development assures a perma
nent commerce that can bring as
splendid prizes to San Francisco as
the Atlantic and Europe have brought
to New Yorkâ provided only the op
portunity is not neglected until it is
too late.
I say to you, and through you to
the people of the Pacific Coast, that
there is on this great coast line from
Vladivostok and Yokohama to Bang
kok and Singapore, winding inandout
for over 5000 miles, indented with nu
merous deep harbors, upon which are
located mighty commercial entrepots,
and peopled with 300,000.000 of souls,
whose one purpose in life is to buy
and sell, an unequaled and un
rivaled opportunity for the develop
ment of American trade and influ
ence. In 1897 the foreign commerce
of Japan, Eastern Siberia, China,
Korea, Cochin-China. Siam. Straits
Settlements, Formosa, Philippines
and Java amounted to over $&H).0O0,
000 in gold. This year it will prob
ably reach $700,000,000. and yet these
transactions are all taking place in
lands and seas directly across the
Pacific from California, Oregon and
Washington, and nearer by some
thousands of miles to the latter than
to the countries of Europe.
Few people In the United States
and even in San Francisco have a
fair idea of the greatness of the Far
East, the number of its large cities
and their enormous trade exchange,
the number of ships required to carry
the exports and imports, and the per
fection and organization of trade
systems which prevail in these trans-
Pacific commercial capitals. San
Francisco, Portland, Seaftle and Ta
coma cannot scenes of ac
tivity in their harbors ..iat will com
pare favorably with those of Singa
pore, Hongkong, Shanghai and Kobe.
If any one supposes that, because
these latter cities are located in Asia,
they are purely Oriental and Asiatic
in 'the conduct of commerce and
trade, they are laboring under great
error.
Again, were they to travel up and
down this coast visiting Vladivostok,
Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe, Tientsin,
Hankow, Shanghai, Hongkong. Can
ton, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore,
Manila and Batavia they would be
keenly surprised at the extent and
influence of foreign interests, the fine
appearance of the foreign sections,
with well-built business and private
houses, clubs and hotels, and with
opportunities for the pleasures as well
ay the hard work of life, the progress
that is everywhere being made, the
pmwtn in population and trade and
the spirit of ac-vity that prevails on
all Hides.
The value of the field Is best attest
ed by the unrelaxed efforts of Euro
pean Governments, of European firms
and of European steamship lines to
advance their respective interests
from Singapore to Siam.
In conclusion, I say to the export
ers, manufacturers, merchants and
other parties who are concerned in me
extension of our trade and influence
In the Pacific that this market Is posi
tively worthy of their tireless ex
ploitation; that it not only now is
showing its value by increased ship
ments and by many additions to the
trans-Pacific fleet, but will in the fu
ture bring rewards of unprecedented
extent, and that after many years of
careful study of trade and political
conditions in the Far East, during
which time I have discussed the sit
uation with the heads of nearly
all the great business houses and
with the leading statesmen of
the different lands, I am prepared to
prove that a specific and amp.c op
portunity awaits the Pacific Coast of
the United States to share properly
in the commerce and trade of Eastern
Asia. In numerous reports to the De
partment of State, as well as in let
ters to chambers of commerce and
American firms. I have discussed these
markets in detail and pointed out
what are the best lines of develop
ment. The scope of this letter will not
permit extended quotation therefrom.
If San Francisco will organize and
conduct a Pacific and Asiatic com
mercial museum*, on lines similar to
those of the Philadelphia museums, a
great step will have been taken, but
there are scores of other ways which,
in the meantime, San Francisco can
follow to Increase its trade exchange
with trans-Pacific ports. I am, sir
yours truly, JOHN BARRETT.

HATRED OF
THE FRENCH
FOR GERMANS
Illustrated by an In
cident on the
Frontier.
Customs Officials Have
an Encounter on the
Boundary Line.
Interest. Seems to Be Slowly
Dying Out in the Dreyfus
Affair.
ZOLA'S APPEAL PENDING.
Rumors That Major Esterhazy, De
spite Protection, Will Be Made to
Figure In a New Light.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, March 19.â An incident, the
importance of which need not be ex
aggerated, caused some excitement on
the eastern frontier. A captain of
German customs ventured to pass the
boundary line and was seized by some
French women, thrown down and
struck. Other German officials came
to their fellow countryman's assistance
with loaded guns, and threatened to
fire on the French if their prisoner was
not released. The latter then escaped,
but the incident was reported to the
t, who ordered an inquiry to as
certain whether the imputed violation
of territory by German officers was
t and whether intentional or not.
Nothing will come of it, but the inci
dent illustrates the mental excitement
prevailing in certain districts where
French and Germans are continually in
contact.
In circles where the Dreyfus affair,
which luckily no longer figures in the
daily balance sheet, is discussed, they
whisper that an incident which will
place Major Esterhazy in a different
position in spite of the protection
hitherto given him will turn up short
ly. On the other hand, what seems to
indicate little hope of revision of the
Dreyfus trial, is a letter from the Min
ister of Colonies to Mme. Dreyfus, who
asks to share her husband's captivity.
3~er letter was dignitied and touching
and most of the papers published it
without comment. One or two ex
pressed the hope that her request
â would be granted and be considered as
an end of the sad affair, it having
reached a point where sentiments of
humanity are admissible. The Minister
for Colonies, under the circumstances,
could hardly have replied in the af
firmative, as the Government is de
termined to avoid everything that could
furnish fresh elements to discussion that
has been too long and has excited
and divided all parties. For the same
reason the date of the decision of the
Court of Cassation on Emile Zola's ap
peal is deferred. They talk now of
its being postponed to next month.
I must mention a touching outburst
of charity among Parisians at the
news that the favorite actress of the
Palace Royal Company, Alice Lavigne,
who has been struck blind. Her sight
was long weak and affected by the
footlights. Now she is forever plunged
into darkness. With that spontaneous
generosity peculiar to the dramatic
profession all the artists in Paris, Mme.
Rejant at the head, have organized a
benefit, where box seats cost 1000
francs, and which will bring a large
sum.
, Antonius Aurellus, King of Arau
cania, has died at Marseilles. A French
man by birth, he became an American

Kounani, â which some recipients still
wear. Driven away by his subjects
he came to France and led a precarious
life, but the French explorer, M. L#e
Baux, relates that he found among the
Indians in Araueania vestiges of mon
archical European ceremonials. Aure
lius may perhaps have solaced his dis
appointments by the thought that he

The meeting was for the purpose of mak

WASHINGTON, March 19.â Mrs. I
Frances Hodgson Burnett, the well
' known author of "Little Lord Fauntle- j
! roy," "A Lady of Quality," "His Grace \
of Oamonde," and other books which '
have gained wide circulation, to-day in- j
! stituted divorce proceedings in the Su- :
! preme Court of the District of Colum- !
j bia against her husband. Dr. Swan M. ;
Burnett. The grounds upon which a
! decree is asked is desertion and failure \
to support. The charge, to a large ex- j
tent, is purely technical. For about
three years Mrs. Burnett and her hus
band have lived apart, and none of ;
their intimate friends were surprised >
to-day to learn that steps had been i
taken to secure a legal separation.
The circumstances which led up tc !
j and caused action to be taken to se- I
I cure a divorce cover a considerable ;
period of years. During her early ca
reer it is said that Dr. Burnett was |
very proud of his wife's ability, and |
the first years of their married life !
were happy. Two children were born â j
! Lionel, who died several years ago, !
j and Vivian, who is now 21 years oM. !
â¢ and a student at Harvard. According j
! to an impression which generally piv- ;
\ vails, he was the boy character upon
which Mrs. Burnett founded her story
i of "Little Lord Fauntleroy."
Intimate friends of both Dr. and Mrs.
Burnett had known for a long time of j
, their strained relations and they only |
remained as husband and wife for the
sake of their child, and until he should
become of age and able*to care for him
self. All during the time that he was ;
' in the High School in this city, there i
! was domestic discord. Husband and |
wife were rarely ever seen together, j
and conducted themselves toward one !
I another only as acquaintances. Mrs.
1 Burnett is a woman of pleasing ap
i pearance and much personal magnet- |
| ism. While her husband is of less than I
I ordinary stature and is a cripple, it la
i said, too, that while a man of some j
i means, an oculist enjoying a large
I practice and a writer on scientific sub
: Jects, he nevertheless grew jealous of
I his wife's reputation, which exceeded
; his, as did also her fortune from her
I books.
While their son was preparing to go
: to college and Mrs. Burnett was on her
way hcrme from Europe, two years ago
last fall, Dr. Burnett moved from their
residence, in Massachusetts avenue, and
took a house in Farragut Square.
[ This, it is said, is the desertion charged
in the suit for divorce. Friends, know
ing that their differences could never
; be reconciled, have frequently advised
I that a divorce be secured.
It is the understanding that the pro
ceedings are with the mutual consent
of Dr. Burnett and Mrs. Burnett, and
! looked upon more as a business matter.
| Dr. Burnett will not discuss the case,
| but his friends say that he will not file
I a cross bill or take any steps to pre
i vent Mrs. Burnett from securing a de
i cree. She is at present in England,
'â  having sailed from New York about
! ten days ago, in company with a wom
an friend.
The papers were made out and signed
by Mrs. Burnett some time before she
left Washington, and immediately
upon her arrival in England she in
structed her attorney to file the bill,
as she did not wish to have the em
barrassment of having the proceed
ings begun while she was here. Her
friends say that her recent book, "A
Lady of Quality," not long ago, fol
lowed by "His Grace of Osmonde,"
was a financial success, and she is
likely to travel abroad for some time
and secure material for another novel.
Gladstone's Condition Worse.
LONDON, March 19.â The Pall Mall
Gazette says Gladstone's general con
dition is appreciably worse. It adds: "It

J facial pains, neuralgia or the presence

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, March 19.â The strained
relations between the Prince Regent
of Bavaria and the Emperor were
strikingly illustrated by the former's
invitation asking his Majesty to at
tend the unveiling of a bust of Em
peror William I in the "Walhall at Ra
tisbon, although it was known to
everybody that the Emperor had ar
ranged to unveil the same day three
statues in honor of his ancestors on
the Sieges Allee. The Regent's invita
tion was evidently intentionally sent
so late that it was impossible to
change the plans. The Emperor re
plied to the slight characteristically
by deputizing Prince Frederick Henry,
the youngest and least* important of
the Prussian princes, to attend the
ceremony at Ratisbon in his behalf.
In court circles, it is said. Emperor
William still most unpleasantly re
members his reception at Nuremberg
last summer, when the people shouted
insulting epithets at him.
It is believed in parliamentary cir
cles that an important resolution will
be introduced in the Diet by the
Agrarian leaders, Yon Mendel and
Ring, asking for a uniform and rigor
ous inspection of meats at frontier
stations and urging the Government
to exert influence to secure a similar
decree from the Bundesrath.
If it be passed the measure will be a
hit at all foreign meats, and the United
States Consuls fear it may be construed
unfairly and seriously injure American
imports. The sugar manufacturers of
the Rhine, at a special meeting just
held, have requested the Government
to inform them definitely whether the
proposed conference on the sugar
bounty question is to meet at Brussels.
There is widespread complaint at the
delay and uncertainty. The belief that
the conference would meet in February
had largely, affected sales and pur
chases, and its failure to meet would
have a disastrous effect on prices.
The first large auction of American
horses took place in Berlin this week.
All the prominent sporting men attend
ed, including Prince Carl Hugo yon
Hohenlohe, the Prince of Thurn and
Taxis and Baron yon Furstenberg. The
bidding was lively, and 300 horses were
sold in eighty minutes. Drivers and
riders averaged from 700 to 800 marks.
The Agrarian press is indignant, and
the Kreuz Zeitung expressed the hope
that the Government would take steps
to prevent "cheap American horses
from injuring domestic horse breed
ing. f <
The mission of Cardinal Kopp, Bish
op of Breslau, to Rome, is much com
mented upon. Advices from Rome in
dicate that it has been a failure, the
Pope deciding to continue to recognize
French protectorate of the Catholic
missions in China. France has been
actively opposing Cardinal Kopp.
A remarkable change in party poli
tics is believed to be imminent. It in
sures the adoption of the most impor
tant measures pending in the Reichs
tag and Diet, while it furnishes the
voters with definite issues for the com
ing campaign. The main issue will be
the commercial treaties, now pending,
which are largely in favor of indus
trial interests and detrimental to agri
cultural interest. They formerly met
with the Emperor's approval, and
brought honors to General yon Caprivi,
the former Chancellor, their framer.
The new treaties, according to the Gov
ernment, promise to be more favorable
to- agriculturists.
The Agrarian election manifesto just
issued is signed by the leaders of the
different conservative factions, and by
part of the National Liberal and Cen
trist parties, the new amalgamation
thus comprising about half the pres
ent representation in the Reichstag
and over half the Diet.
In opposition to this combination, all
the liberal and radical factions have
hooted these issues and they will be
supported by the socialists in uphold
ing the many lines of the political
treaties. The campaign has been
opened throughout Germany. The
commercial convention, sitting this
week in Berlin, representing all the
chambers of commerce and large in
dustrial firms of the country, unani

DYEA, Alaska, March 14 (by steam
ship Queen to Seattle, March 19).âMa
jor Duval, who came up the frozen trail
I from Dawson a few days ago, brings
I news of a unique and important na
ture. Old-timers on the Yukon and the
late comers who have been in the coun
j try long enough to become familiar
I with the general conditions, and also
I the representatives of the Alaska Com
mercial Company a:i<l the North Amer
ican Trading and Transportation Com
i pany are fearfully apprehensive of the
; conditions that will prevail at Dawson
j and on the Yukon next winter as a re
! suit of the rapidly increasing popula
j tion of the region. How all the incom
; ing thousands are going to be fed is
| the worrying question. Notwithstand
| ing the amount of provisions that was
] taken in last year by the commercial
i companies and individuals, the recent
; food shortage and starvation scare re
sulted. A hundred men are going in
; this year to one last year.
Even if the statÂ»- of water in the Yu
j kon is at its best and permits two or
three round trips bj the many steam
ships from St. Michael, sufficient food
j cannot be taken in. But the stats of
I water in the Yukon is a very uncertain
j quantity.
It is so problematical that only one
trip is as likely to be made as two or
three. The last season's experience
demonstrated this. Hundreds, empty- j
handed, will Flip through the Canadian ;
i police lines on the river beyond the
Cbilkoot and "White passes, despite the
utmost vigilance. The latest finds at i
Walsh and Lake creeks have well nigh j
crazed the floating population at Dyea J
and Skaguay.
Being thoroughly aware of these con
ditions, the hading men of Dawscrn are
considering the question of holding the
i whole output of gold in Dawson this
: spring when the water runs and the
I clean-ups are made from the mines, and
allowing noi a dollar more than is ac
| tually necessary for business purposes
1 to go out. This is what Major Duval
I says. They feel that if millions of dol
; lars' worth of nuggets and dust are
brought out on the first steamers from
St. Michael to Seattle and San Fran
i cisco next June the effect will be to so
j electrify the people of the country that
! they will flock into Dawson in much
: greater numbers than at present, and
I that even a possible war with Spain
cannot distract the attention of the
people from ground where gold is dug
out by the shovelful. The present rate
of the exodus to the Klondike, from
1000 to 2000 people a week being dumped
into Dyea, Skaguay and F<n-t Wrangel,
; already makes the food question a very
; serious one. Before the open season
I closes people with large outfits, owing
j to the congestion on the trails, will drop
most of their freight and go- on to Daw
son with what they con get in, just
I as they did last season.
The matter of allowing no gold to be
| shipped out of Dawson, or, if sent at
all, to ship it secretly under another
name, is being seriously considered in
Dawson. Some action along this line
may, from information available at the
coast gateways at this time, be looked
for. Consequently the public may not
be surprised or disappointed if the Ex
celsior and other first ships from St.
Michael next June do not bring out any
visible or announced quantity of gold.
Perhaps a search in the coal bunkers
might discover a few sacks, tfle con
tents of which will be heavy and yel
low.
Every man who has come out of the
Klondike during the last six weeks, with
whom I have talked, has said that if
the present rush to the Yukon country
runs on apace there will be unparalleled
suffering, starvation and death there
as sure as ice forms in the Arctic cir
cle. It is estimated by the latest out
comers over the 600 miles of frosty
traJl that the spring clean-up of gold
from Bonanza, El Dorado, Hunker, Do
minion and the other tributaries of the
Klondike will amount to between $7,
000,000 and $10,000,000

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 19.
There was a hot time in the House
this afternoon during the consideration
of the postofflce appropriation bill.
There were heated colloquies between
Loud of California, chairman of the
committee, and Representative Bland
of Missouri, and again between Loud
and Castle. Later in the day Barlow
of California took a hand in the pro
ceedings, and denounced Jerry Simp
son, a brother Populist, for voting sub
sidies to railroads.
Last night, just before the close of
the session, Chairman Loud excited the
ire of Bland and the Democratic side by
proposing to cut short the vote on the
Item for railroad mail transportation.
Bland Intimated that Loud was show-
{ Ta st night, just before the close of
session. Chairman Loud excited the
f Bland and the Democratic side by
osing to cut short the vote on the
for railroad mail transportation,
id intimated that Loud was show
ing favoritism to railroads, and de
nounced the appropriation of $30,500,000
as being wildly extravagant, and that
the increase of $1,700,000 over the ap
propriation of last year was unwar
ranted. â¢ â â â â¢: '.
Loud did not have sufficient time to
! reply to Bland yesterday afternoon, as
; the session was near its close, but this
j morning shortly after the House met he
i arose in his place, and vigorously de
i nounced the Missourian. Loud averred
: that he cared not for the criticisms of
the press when such criticism was un-
I just, nor did he care for utterances
: made by gentlemen on the floor when
they did not bear the imprint of truth.
"Some time ago," he said, "a com
mittee came down here from Brooklyn
'to urge a measure pending before
' Congress. They returned to their
I homes and declared that I had char
' acterized them as 'a pack of damned
; asses,' but this was not the truth lit
â  erally. Damned asses is not one of my
phrases. A great press association
; telegraphed broadcast over this coun
; try that my domineering manner in
I refusing amendments offered had de
| feated.the Loud postal bill. That as
! soclation is now enjoying the court
| esies of this House and its representa

floor, but yet the reporter of the Bung
town Bladder, with 100 circulation,
| would have better sense than to inti

! by petty prejudice when it comes to
' casting their votes on great appropria
\ tions. The gentleman from Missouri
i said that I was opposing any reduc

j roads for mail transportation. .My
position upon this question is well
: known, for I have repeatedly said that
I the pay of railroads for such service
i should be reduced. I have never yet
j seen the time when I could not afford

I comes I hope to God that I may sink
i down to perdition where dishonest
I men properly belong. The gentleman
from Missouri, as every member upon
! that side of the House knows, has
simply been playing to that part of the
; gallery which in a theater is known as
the 'nigger heaven.' When I was a
j boy the gentleman from Missouri was
j a member of Congress and our people
| believed him to be a great, good, hon
; orable and honest man. We hardly
jingled anything else in our pockets
j but Bland dollars. The great trouble

long. They decay mentally and physi
cally."'
Bland in reply said that no one on
the floor would impugn Loud's hon
esty of purpose, but might criticize
his management of the bill.
At another stage of the discussion
Loud became engaged in a colloquy
with his colleague from California, Cas
tle, who had been arguing in favor of
a reduction, of this appropriation for
mail transportation. Castle proposed
that the amount be reduced from thirty
millions to three millions eight hundred
thousand, claiming that this would be
equivalent to 1 cent per pound on 380,
000,000 pounds. Loud turned upon his
California colleague and in tones of
deep disgust said:
"If I had a 10-year-old boy, Mr.
Chairman, who was as ignorant of
facts and got his figures so confused,
or so inaccurate us my associate from
California, I would be tempted to drown
him for a damned fool." (Great laugh
ter.)
Loud explained that the Postofflce
Committee in fixing the amount to be
paid railroads acted on the estimates
submitted by the Postofflce Department
and that it was incumbent upon Con
gress to provide the department with
the amount requested for railroad mail
transportation.
After further debate the House
passed the postoffice appropriation bill,
which has been under consideration
since Wednesday. The main points
of attack to-day were the appropria
tions of $30,000,000 for railway transpor
tation of mails and $171,000 for special
facilities between New York and New
Orleans, and $25,000 for special facilities
from Kansas City to Newton, Kans.
These items annually attract more or
less of a contest. This year the op
position seemed to be less intense. All
efforts to reduce the appropriation for
railroad transportation signally failed,
and the vote on the Southern mail sub
sidy was 77 to 98 against striking out.
By Jieat parliamentary maneuvering
the opponents of the subsidy were pre
vented from getting a direct vote on a
motion to recommit with instructions.
BOY ROBBERS
COME TO GRIEF
Twelve Lads Had Erected
Huts With Modern Elec
trical Appliances.
Material for Their Dime Novel Ar
rangements Secured by Raids
on Dwellings.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, March 19.â A gang of twelve
boy robbers belonging to the best families
in Wallaston, a fashionable suburb, was
arrested to-day. Back in the woods the
boys had erected several small huts In
regular dime novel style, and there had
stored thetr plunder. The little shanties
were connected with wires and bells, and
the boys had a regular electric outfit in
running order. It is alleged the boys ab
stracted the signal boxes of the New
York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad
at Wallaston. The unoccupied houses
owned by Nathan Nickerson and Henry
Fenno at Wallaston and Henry G. Fay
and the John Holden estate at Wallaston
Park were entered and the electric bells
and connections stolen. They also broke
into the clubhouse of the Wallaston Golf
Club at Norfolk Downs and golf sticks
and balls were stolen from the lockers.
They were recovered a few days after the
burglary by Officer Connolly in a cluvert
near the Wallaston depot.
The ages range from 8 to 13 years.
This embryo Jesse James gang had built
a number of huts in the thickets of the
lowlands of Wallaston, where they had
hiddden their plunder. They had utilized
the electrical appliances stolen from the
houses mentioned to connect the huts for
electrical communication. The members
of the youthful gang belong to very good
families, and the injured parties are dis
inclined to prosecute the offenders. For
this reason the police refuse to divulge
the names of the boys.
Farmers May Yet Hope.
WOODLAND, March 19.â One of the
oldest and most experienced farmers In the
State has not lost hope on account of the
lack of rain. He says this season re
minds him of the spring of 1860. At this
time of the month the rainfall was as
deficient as it is now. But on the 22<1
of March it began to rain and continued
at intervals until the last of April. On
the sth day of April Putah Creek over
ran its banks. The hay crop was spoiled
that year, but the wheat crop was one
of the best ever harvested in the county.

NEW YORK, March 19.â The interna
tional chess match between Great Brit
ain and the United States begun yes
terday was won by the Britishers by
Ito 4% games. Last year the Amer
is were defeated by their British,
onents by exactly the same figures,
le in the first match, played two
rs ago, the Americans were victori
by 4'_. to 3% sanies. Following are
details of the play on all the boards:
llsbury played a queen's gambit
inst Jilackburn, who declined to acÂ°
i the gambit pawn. Later Fillsbury
mged to establish a passed pawn on
king's tight, which seemed to be a
v advantage. However, the advan-
Beemed not strong enough to win,
although Pillsbury sacrificed his pawn to
get an attack, and he was finally obliged
to accept a draw.
Showaltcr, against Burn, also played a
queen's gambit, declined and was mas
terly throughout, his brilliant sacrifice
being a piece of work which gave tha
Kentuckian the victory.
The Bostonian, â¢ Harry, selected a
queen's gambit opening against Caro.
Although it looked at a time as if tha
latter had the better position, Barry, by
a very ingenious and clever play, brought
about the defeat of his celebrated ad
v. rsary.
I very interesting game was played on
fourth board between Atkins and
mes. The New Jersey champion se
ed a French defense and gave Atklna
option To make a brilliant sacrifice
a. piece. Then, however, Hymes cama
to the occasion by most wonderful de
sive tactics and secured a draw,
ot too much praise can be bestowed
upon Hodges, who conducted a Ruy Lope*
against Bi-llingham. The Staten Islander
excelled both in aggressive and defensiva
movements and by sheer hard work ha
administered defeat to his rival.
Delmar was out of form in his contest.
His French defense against the Scottish
, champion. Mills, was weakly played. Th<j
latter secured the exchange and left Del
; mar in a hopeless position, when he re
signed.
A long drawn out game resulted be
tween Baird and Locock. This was an
I even contest throughout. From the be
! ginning to the end neither side was able
to claim any distinctive advantage at any
stage of the game, and so a draw was the
only legitimate result.
Young, who conducted a French de
| fense against Jackson; Robinson, who
! played a queen's pawn opening against
'< Jacobs, and Galbreath, who had to con
wit h a queen's pawn opening of
; Trenchard, were outmatched. They were
a on their merits, and the least said
! about it the better.
LONDON, March 19.â The closing
hour of play in the International cable
chess match was watched with the
greatest interest, and the result was
greeted with the heartiest cheers. Slr
George Newnes, president of the Brit
ish Chess Club, said:
"It was a most deligtitful match and
passed off without a hitch of any kind,
just as might be expected between such
sportaman-llke opponents. The next
time I will give a cup twice the size."
Though the match is considered won,
the games between Pillsbury and
Blackburn and Locock and Baird at-"-*
! tracted the greatest attention. Black- [
1 burn said:
"The last ten hours of my game has
been a draw, of course. Pillsbury rac
rificed his game in the interest of the
match. Had the matter gone to Lask
er, he could not have decided except in
favor of a draw."
Other experts are of the opinion that
had the game been flmsned Pill-jburv
would have won. The Locock-Baird
game was considered a draw, with Lo
| cock in the better position.THEY FAVOUR

San Rafael Ladies Are
Knthusiastic Over the
Carnival.
The Committee Hard at Work
Enlisting the Support of
Tow nspeople".
Will Probably Be Held in May Owing
to the Backwardness of the
Flower Gardens.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, March 19.â Bright
and early this morning the ladies cm
whom has been placed the duty of can
vassing the town for an expression of
sentiment on the holding of a rose car
nival in May, were out among their
neighbors and acquaintances, discuss
ing features and attractions, as well as
the best time for holding the fete, for
it was only necessary to mention "rose
carnival" for the recipient of a call to
enter upon details, as though there
could be no question as to its success.
A general invitation has been extend
ed to the ladies of San Rafael to at
tend the meeting of the committee on
Monday afternoon, at which time the
project will be definitely decided upon.
â While it is evident that not a single
voice will be raised against it, the la
dies want assurance of the active co
operation Of everybody, and this they
are determined to have before they
proceed any further. To-day there is
not a member of the committee who
has the slightest doubt that this assur
ance will be given.
Mrs. A. W. Foster this morning noti
fied those ladies of the committee who
were absent from last night's meeting
of the action taken by the citizens and
the responsibility resting upon them,
and during the day consulted with sev
eral of the members.
"Many ladies living in San Rafael,"
said Mrs. Foster, "who have visited
similar festivals in other places in past
years have returned filled with the
idea of holding a flower show at home,
and without exception they have ex
pressed the sentiment that there is no
place in California better adapted for
eueh an affair than San Rafael. No
where do roses bloom in greater pro
fusion or are the varieties more va
ried than here, yet many places not
nearly so favored as we are give most
creditable displays each year. Some of
them even find it necessary to make
heavy drafts upon the gardens of San
Kai'uel to complete their attractions,
while we would have more than enough
flowers right at home to fill the re
quirements of the most elaborate dis
play.
"I think one reason why San Rafael
has been so backward in entertain- |
ments of this character is because of
our proximity to San Francisco.-, ' Â±,i lt
l\nj* been much, easier to run over to !
the city for our amusements than to j
prepare them ourselves, as those liv
ing farther away must do. If we had
to depend upon our own exertions for j
amusement we would have established (
flower fetes long ago.
'â¢Since the subject has been agitated \
I have talked to many ladies about it â 
and am gratified to say that I have only i
met one who raised the slightest objec- j
tion. That lady favored the plan, but j
was apprehensive that there was not |
enough time to prepare for it and sug- ;
gested that it might be well to postpone ;
it until next year. I told ncr that next \
year would see us in exactly the same j
position we are in now. If we ever j
did anything we would have to make a j
beginning, and we could do that as well
this year as next."
Regarding the suggestion emanating
from the Ten Thousand Club that the j
carnival be held daring the latter part j
of April, the ladies believe that owing
to the late season it is too early and j
that a week or two later would be much j
better. Mrs. Foster said she had in- i
spected her rose bushes to-day and j
found them very backward, and unless
we had warm weather from this time
on the blossoms would not be in their
full glory by that time. She thought it
would be much better to hold it during
the first week in May, when the gar
dens would surely be burdened with
their treasures. This opinion was
shared by several other members of the
committee.
Mrs. L. A. Lancel has been busy all
day enlisting supporters of the carni
val and Is satisfied that Monday's
meeting will result in a decision to pro
ceed with the plan. In this she is fully
indorsed by Mrs. and Miss Elliott, Mes
dames Dreypolcher, Christiansen,
Whittemore, Ham, Butler, G. H. Fos
ter and Harrison. The other member
of the committee. Mrs. R. H. Warfleld,
is enthusiastic over the fete, and has
given her promise of stanch support.
But to name the ladies who have also
done this would be to publish the social
directory of San Rafael.
Ward McAllister, the leader of the
Hunt Club, has promised to do all in
his power to assist" the affair, and will
arrange for a cavalcade of aids, com
posed of members of the club, both
ladles and gentlemen, mounted on their
thoroughbred hunters, for the big pa-

TACOMA, March 19.â The Northern
Pacific steamship Victoria arrived this
afternoon, bringing Hongkong advices

An encounter recently took place at
Vanhai, in Tonquin, between a gang of
pirates and the inhabitants of that

fense, but as they were surprised and
poorly armed they soon retreated, leav
ing the pirates in control. They made
one brave dash, and succeeded in res
cuing a number of the town's most
prominent citizens, whom the pirates
had captured and intended to hold for
ransom. Four lives were lost and a
large number wounded. A mandarin
of the district was killed while leading
the villagers against their assailants.
A sensation has been created at
Shanghai by proof that native detect
ives there are in the habit of torturing
their prisoners to obtain confessions,
and thereby demonstrate their prowess.
Recently some priso-ners submitted to
being burned with hot irons before they
would confess to having stolen a miss
ing launch, of which theft they were
innocent. On being released they made
an exposure of the detectives' methods,
resulting in the arrest of five of the
sleuths, three of whom have been sen
tenced to from two to three years' im
prisonment.
A serious explosion occurred in the
coal mines at Kebao, China. Fourteen
native miners were killed and a large
number injured. Several members of
a European mining staff were in an
other jpoz'tion of the mine, but escaped.
Thomas Gay of the American ship
Luzon has been found guilty of arson
in the first degree at Shanghai and
sentenced to two years' imprisonment
with hard labor by Consul-General
Goodnow. He attempted to fire his
own ship.
Peking dispatches printed in the late
Japanese papers state that the Chi
nese Government, backed by Russia, is
preparing to use part of the money Just
raised in England in paying off the
balance of the Japanese war indemnity.
China will then demand that Japan va
cate Weihaiwei. It is doubtful if Ja
pan will consent to leave at this junc
ture. If she does it is expected Eng
land will succeed her in occupying Wei
haiwei. Singly or together they in
tend to keep a footing on the northern
<'hinp.se mainland so long as Russia
occupies Port Arthur. Russia is ac
credited with making nine out of every
ten points in the political chess game
now being played at Peking. It is
Russia in reality that wants the Ja
panese and English out of Northern
China.
The Chinese Minister in America is
reported to have some time ago sent a
dispatch to the Viceroy of Canton, ask
ing that the exporting of rice to Amer
ica be allowed, because most of the
Chinese in this country are Canton
people and are in the habit of eating
rice. The Viceroy isÂ» willing that the
rice shall be exported under the cir
cumstances named; but native chari
table associations oppose it for the rea
son that the rice crop in that section
is very short and they fear their con
tributions will be lessened if the rice
supply is diminished.
Last month the people of Shik Loong, '
a suburb of Canton, rose up and de
stroyed a rice ship which persisted in
exporting rice to foreign countries. Its
proprietors had stored a large quan
tity for export and refused to offer it
for sale when the townspeople so de
manded. A food riot ensued, in which
he killed one of the villagers. The pop
ulace then broke in, carried away
every pound of rice and destroyed
everything the proprietor owned. Dur
ing the struggle two men were tram
pled to death.
All Canton was greatly frightened
on February 18 by black clouds which
rolled over the city from the ocean.
The people believed the tailless dragon
was coming to do evil, and scores of
small boats sought places of safety.
Gongs and drums were beaten by the
people on land and guns fired from
the gunboats in the hope of scaring
the dragon away. That night the
clouds passed away and the people
experienced great joy.
The inhabitants of Shantung prov
ince are still wrought up against for
eigners, particularly missionaries. The
Governor of the province is kept in
hot water to restrain them, knowing
his own head will pay the penalty of
any violence. He asked the Canton
Government for 1000 picked soldiers,
which were hurried forward last
month. The black flag general has
hired 5000 soldiers to re-enfojce the
garrisons in the various forts of Tiger
Pass.
The Sultan of Johore, while hunting,
attempted to extract a cartridge from
his gun. The charge exploded, blow
ing the brass butt of the shell deeply
into his left cheek. He stood the in
tense pain heroically for hours before
reaching medical attendance. He may
lose the sight of his left eye.
Vladivostok advices state that the
Siberian railroad has been completed
from the coast to Khabarovsk, several
hundred miles inland.
The total losses by the recent grreat
fire at Manilla reached $2,000,000, wit*
$700,000 insurance.

THE SENATOR
Another Steel Steamer
for the Juneau-Dyea-
Skaguay Trade.
Successful Trial Trip of Kim
ball & Company's New
Steamer Dirigo.
Departure of the Oregon for Callao,
Where Her Final Orders Will
Be Received.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Compa-
I nys new steamer Senator was launched
I from the Union Iron Works yesterday.
i She was named after the old side
j wheel steamer Senator, and Miss Ella
F. Goodall did the christening. The
â¢ yld Senator formerly belonged to Good
: all, Perkins & Co., but when she had
I outlived her usefulness the paddle bux
| es and wheels and engines were taken
out, and she was bark rigged. From
! here she was sailed to Auckland, New
I Zealand, where she was turned into a
I coal hulk, and is still doing duty as
i such.
The launching took place at 9:10 a.
j m. in the presence of a big crowd of
: people. Several tug boats and the oom-
I pany's steamer Pomona, with a large
party of invited guests aboard, were
j present. Among those on the Pomona
I were Captain Charles Goodall and Ed
| win Goodall, Mrs. Charles Webb How
j ard, Mrs. Le Grande Canon Tibblts, H.
i J. Knowles, H. H. Adams and party,
K. G. Brown and party, William Ma
gee and family, General and Harry
HaughfTi, Mr. and Mrs. W. Gwin, Wil
'â¢ liam H. Fisher and family, John L..
I Howard, Mr. and Mrs. Davis of Ross
j Valley, Charles K. Field and a host of
i others. After the launch the Pomona
â  returned to Broadway wharf to land
| those who had business to attrnd to.
Captain Debney then took her around
j the bay on an excursion, and showed
I the company's guests all the eights.
When completed the Senator will
j take the Australia's place on the Dyea
j Skaguay run, the latter vessel return
! ing to the Honolulu trade. The steam
j er Curacoa, which is now being over
i hauled, will take the Orizaba's place in
the Mexican trade, and the Orizaba
'. will probably be placed on the south-
I crn route. Chief Engineer Robinson of
i the Pomona will go as chief of the
Senator. He superintended the fitting
out of the Pomona after she was
launched from the Union Iron Works,
and now he will do the same duty for
I the Senator. First Assistant Engineer
I Dolan of the Pomona, will go out as
chief. The Senator is 280 feet long, 38
feet broad, 21 feet deep and 2200 tons
gross burden. She is expected to be a
thirteen-knot ship, and will have ac
commodations for 110 cabin and 300
i steerage passengers.
A sidewheel steamer for the Yukon
â  River trade is being built at North
i Beach for G. Cashmore of Oakland. Hhe
will be 175 feet long, 36 feet broad and
I 9 feet high from her keel to the top of
the deckhouse. She will only draw a
foot of water. The steamer is to be
ready in twn months, and Captain
Walter Childs will take her to St. Mi
chael, where she will load f < r Dawsun
City.
Mrs. Eugenia Schuller was removed
from the Harbor Receiving Hospital
to St. Mary's Hospital yesterday. She
â  bore the moving well, and the doctors
I now say that if blood poisoning does
! not set in she will recover.
Lightship No. 70 will have her trial
i trip to-morrow morning. Major Davis
I of the lighthouse engineers and Captain
Davies and Chief Engineer Black of the
lighthouse tender Madrono will g-o out
on the vessel, and Captain A. T. Lowell
will be in command. Lightship No. 70
will go to her anchorage April 9.
The barkentine Fremont came out of
retirement In Oakland Creek yesterday
and went on the drydock for an over
| hauling. She will leave for Alaska
early in April and will be the flrstof the
codfishing fleet to get away.
The French steamer La Madeleine!
from New Whatcom for Guayaquil with
; lumber, stopped off this port for in
structions yesterday. Some provisions
and the captain's sailing orders wore
sent out by the tug Sea King and then
the steamer proceeded on her way,
J. S. Kimball & Co.'s new steamer
Dirigo had her trial trip on the bay
y, pterday. She proved to be fast and a
splendid sea boat. She leaves for Dyea,
Skaguay and Copper River with about
100 miners to-morrow, but will call at
Seattle on the way to take aboard
about 200 more. Every berth by the
Dirigo was taken some weeks ago, but
there was some delay in getting her
ready, so the gold hunters drew down
their deposits and took passage by the
Humboldt.
The battle-Shi-^ Oregon got away for
Callao yesterday. As she passed down
the bay all the tugs and ferry steamers
saluted and many of the sailing ve^ysels
dipped their flairs. The big warship
looked very deep in the water as she
parsed along the front. She has itiOO
tons of coal aboard, and also 400 tons
of ammunition, besides all the stores
for a long cruise. She will go from here
to Callao and there her final orders will
be given.
KNIGHTS AT PLAY.
First Annual Entertainment and
Ball of the "Infernal Order of

The members of the "Infernal Order of
the Kings of Purgatory" gave their first
annual entertainment and ball at Odd
Fellows' Hall last night. The novelty of
the entertainment with the expectation of

observing something out of the usual
channel of fun brought out as large a
crowd as could conveniently cram itself
into the large hall.
The Council <>f Dignitaries consisted of:
Lucifer George M. Hermance; Sublimo
King of Kings, George W. Monteith; Most
High King of Spades, A. L. Wells; Most
High King of Hearts. M. A. Samuels;
Most High King of Clubs, Ray Hard;

11. C. Hlncken, 11. Strieker; attendant,
H. Robinson. Stage director, George- M.
Hermance.
These officials occupied positions on the
stage, robed in ancient costumes of days
long gone by. The farce opened with a
burlesque In which such prominent citi
zens as ('. I. Huutlngton, "Blinker" Mur
phy, C. C. O'DonneU, Sam Rainey, Long
John Wllkins. l>r. Rottanzi and His Whis
kers Judge Campbell were proposed for
membership. Several objections were of
feree! against their admission and they
went by the board until the name of Dr.
Rottanzi was r< ached, when quite a dis
cussion was had on his availability. It
was finally agreed that the doctor was
not eligible for the degrees conferred In
purgatory, but w.is a lit candidate for
the higher degree of that conferred in
Bhebl; lie wns passed on his merits.
The Initiation of two candidates was full
of humor, especially the s nd degree.
in which Dante's Inferno was but a mild
picture nf the lavish consumption of sui
phur which was burned in cleaning the
two candidates of their crimes prepara
tory to their being- admitted to fellow
ship with the kings of the middle region.
The spectacular and lurid 8taÂ«Â« effects
were representative enough to give a vivid
picture of what preachers in early days
presented to their flocks In order to keep
them on the straight road to the good
place above.
After the stage pcenery and the bur
lesque lnitlatii â  bad been gone through
with, the hall was cleared of the seats
;md dancing became the order of the
night.
GUN PLAKT FOB, BENICIA.
Local Commercial Bodies Will Likely
Petition for One There.
The annual election of the Manufactur
ers' and Producers* Association will be
held on next "Wednesday. The' nominat
ing committee, consists of F. L.
Brown, L. R. Mead and A. Sbarboro, is
busy at work trying to find suitable mate
rial for the next board of directors. It is
believed that while some of the present
board will be retained there will be a
number of new faces at the next regular
meeting. President i\>rr announces that
he will not again assume the duties of
the position he has held so satisfactorily
to tho association for the past year. Ho
has been obliged to give much time to the
affairs of that body which he feels
should bo given to hi.-> private business.
Before ho steps down and out Mr. Kerr
will present to the directors a matter
which he thinks should receive their at
tention.
He wishes tho association to make an
effort to secure the co-operation of all
the commercial bodies of this city and
State in a petition to Congress and the
authorities at Washington to have ee
tablished at Benicia a gun assembling
plant. In 1890 a Congressional commis
sion came to this coast, and after looking
around for some time recommended that
such a plant be located there. Such a
plant would furnish employment to
a le.rge â  number of workmen who
would be engaged nearly the year
round in finishing and putting together
the castings and parts of the largo guns
for the army and navy. In speaking of
his wishes Mr. Kerr Bald: "There is no
better place in the West for such a
plant. The Government is now making
appropriations for just such purposes,
and it is only fair that this State should
be recognized, as we have all the facili
ties necessary. There is ample ground
there for testing the big guns when com
plete. And further, the vessels for which
they were intended could load the same
without trouble, for there is not a vessel
in our navy but- what couH lie alongside
of the wharf at Benicia. Then again, the
Government barracks are close to the
Mare Island Navy Yard, and are also on
the railroad. Now that these matters are
receiving the attention of the Govern
ment officials I think that the business
men and the entire public should unite in
a demand for the establishment of such
a plant at Benicia,"
LEES CALLS ON GUNST.
The Chief Wants the Commissioner
to Act at Once.
The fact that remale gamblers have
been startled for the reason that their
haunts have been made public and that
the Mayor advises that visitors of pool
rooms should be arrested, Is the cause
of many rather peculiar feelings In va
rious departments of the heads of po
lice and police commissioners.
As was stated by Commissioner
Gunst, the poolrooms should be closed
up at once and without fail, and the
police should doÂ» the work, but Chief
Lees says Gunst is not doing the work,
as he understands the situation, but if
he is, ho should act, and act at once
and in a decided manner or else allow
the police themselves to do the work In
a suitable manner.
In all probability Lees and Gunst see
a chance to help themselves out of the
wealth of their sarcastic vocabularies,
and without doubt the chance will not
be neglected by either party. Last
evening Chief Lees detailed two officers
to visit and watch the various female
poolrooms, and they have been ordered,
in obeyance to the Mayor's Ideas, to
ask and obtain the names of all vis
itors to any one of the various places
known to be In existence. A poolroom
war may result in more interesting
Chief and Commissioner disagreements.
LOOKS LIKE FOUL PLAY.
J. F. Gaddls, a man about 30 years old,
waa taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital from the Golden Eagle Hotel last
night in an unconscious condition. His
face was badly lacerated and examination
showed that his skull was fractured.
Gaddis came to the city from Ba.den
about a week ago in company with Wil
liam Wallace. Friday night he went out.
and was last seen emerging from a saloon
in an Intoxicated condition with .an un
known woman. Yesterday morning he
returned to the hotel and complained of
a severe headache. Later he became un
conscious and was removed to the hos
pital. His recovery is not expected, and
now he came by his injuries is a mystery.
INTERCLASS
FIELD MEET

School Compete for
Honors.
The Seniors Come First, Mlddlers
Second and Juniors
Third.
The students of the Lowell High
School sported on the Olympic Club
track and field yesterday afternoon in
the regular interclass field day. It was
a day of record-breaJdng and cold win
try winds, which froze the athletes to
the bone and sent the chills up and
down the backs of the few spectators
who had the hardihood to sit out the
entire show. Noise there was in plenty,
and between the interclass yells and
the leathern-throated enthusiasm, an
intense form of Juvenile excitement was
sustained.
The senior class won the day, and
the middlers came In a second. In just
graduation the juniors finished at the
tall end. The order of events was as

WILL ERECT A THEATEB.
An Opera House Is Projected for San
Francisco by a New Syndicate.
When a sufficient number of stock
holders can be secured to subscribe for
I stock in the new theatrical company
which will be shortly inaugurated in this
city for the purpose of erecting an opera
house on the corner of Eddy and Jones
Streets, opposite the old Republican Wig
wam, active work will be begun.
A number of capitalists of San Fran
cisco are interested in the venture, among
the most prominent of whom are James
L>. Phelan, who bought the property on
Eddy and Jones streets expressly for the
purpose of the erection of a theater, and
; Mr. Bouvier, recently connected with the
Al Hayman n.anagement of the Bald
win.
The. idea is to erect a theater where
' accommodations would be sufficiently ex
: tensive to warrant bringing to this coast
hitr first-class operatic attractions. The
! building will not be devoted exclusively
to theatrical purposes, but will be pro
vided with halls, meeting-rooms of all
kind* and assembly-rooms large enough
I for convpntion purposes.
Advances made on furniture and p'nnos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission.

WILL PREACH
A MISSION
Good Work of Paulists to
Spread to St. Paul's
Parish.
Fathers Younan and Wyman
of St. Mary's Will Conduct
the Services.
General Notes Concerning the Catho
lio Churches Throughout
thÂ« Ctiy.
A mission under the auspices of
Fathers Wymar and Younan of the
Paulist Community will be held at St.
Paul's Church, commencing with the
10:30 o'clock mass this morning and
continuing for two weeks. The serv
ices during the first week will be de
voted to the instruction of women,
while those of the last will be reserved
exclusively for men.
During the absence of Father You
nan from St. Mary's Church on Cali
fornia street, where he recently con
ducted one of the most successful mis
sions ever held in this city, the class of
inquiry which was established in the
lower chapel of the church immediately
after the mission for the instruction of
non-Catholics will be conducted by
Father Francis Dougherty. The serv- i
ices, as usual, will be held every Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday evening,
and will be devoted to the further in
struction of unbelievers in Catholicism.
Father Dougherty has stated that he
will be pleased to answer any question
that non-Catholics may be in doubt
about at these meetings or may choose
to ask. Doctrinal and theological dog
mas will be discussed and expounded,
and a definition of the different parts
and meaning of the mass will b% ex
plained.
For the short time the class has been
in progress the attendance has been
unusually large and much interest has
been manifested in all the subjects that
have as yet been introduced and con
sidered.
Father Younan, to whose efforts the
mission at St. Mary's Church was
mainly due, will deliver a series of
evening sermons during passion week.
A lecture on the subject of India will
also be delivered by the missionary be
fore he leaves for the East. It will be
given at Native Sons' Hall on April 19,
immediately after Easter Sunday. The
lecture will be illustrated with stere
opticon views, which will depict all
phases of Indian life, religion and an
cient customs, and considering the fact
that Father Younan has been a traveler
in India, and while there was a close
student of the people and their various
traits, the lecture will be both instruct
ive and interesting.
At St. Ignatius' Church to-day the
feast of St. Joseph patron of the uni
versal church will be celebrated with
special solemnity. There will be a
solemn high mass at 9 o'clock, and in
the evening rosary and solemn benedic
tion.
Immediately after the 9 o'clock mass
at the French Church to-day a meet
ing of the Sanctuary Society will be
held in the assembly hall, in the rear
of the church proper. As yet this so
ciety is governed by a temporary board
of officers, but it is hoped that in a few
weeks a permanent organization may
be effected.
A convention of the Catholic Truth
Society will be held to-morrow and
Tuesday evenings at Metropolitan Hall.
The services will be under the immedi
ate direction of Father Yorke.
At Washington Square Hall next
Tuesday evening a "rally" by the St.
Francis branch of the League of the
Cross will be held for the purpose of
competing for the silver medal, which
will entitle the winner to enter the con
test for the gold medal which Arch
bishop Riordan will award at the grand
annual rally for the best essay on the
subject of temperance.
The Italian Church which Is in pro
cess of construction at Ocean View is
nearing completion and will be dedi
cated on next Easter Sunday.
Much interest has been manifested In
the Lenten exercises of the Calvarian
Society, which are held every Sunday
afternoon at St. Man's Cathedral. The
society has issued and distributed a
book containing the order of ceremony
and the object of the weekly devotion.
It is anticipated that the Sacred
Heart Church, another Catholic edifice
now in process of erection at Oak and
Fillmore streets, will be completed by
the Ist of next September.
B'NE B'RITH.
The thirty-fourth anniversary of the
institution of Monteflore Lodge will be
celebrated by a frrand ball next Wednes
dttv evening- in B. B. Hall. The affair is
strictly invitational.

NOW REJOICE
A Victory for The Call
Against Poolrooms for
> Women.
Chief of Police Lees Issues an Or
der to Make Arrests and Sec
retary Kane Takes a Hand.
stimulated into tardy action by The Call's exposure of the
fart that in this city several poolroom* hare been run wholly
on tlie patronage olMomen, tlie police department has taken
Mep* to abate the evil. It is a victory for The Call that the re.
spectable element of the community will applaud heartily.!*
â victory "which mean* that a cancerous growth on the morals o*
the community w ill lÂ»e pared away and a fruitful source of cor
ruption to w ires and mothers of a weak tendency destroyed, to
say nothing of the good done to children in the way of remov
ing vicious examples.
The exposure of this crying evil was made last Thursday,
and even now public opinion on the subject has risen to such
a pitch that the police department has considered it unwise
to delay action any longer in trying to mitigate the evil. Pro.
to*!* have been made not only through the medium of The
Call, but individually and personally. The result is now seen.
Chief of Police L.ees sent an order to
Captain Wittman yesterday to detail
two men at each of the poolrooms pat
ronized by women, with instructions to
Becure the names of all the women who
visited the places, and if they were seen
there mare than once to arrest them
as habitues of the place and book them
on a charge of vagrancy.
Captain Wittman accordingly detailed
Bergeant Martin to take a squad of men
with the object of carrying out the
Chief's instructions. The captain ac
companied the sergeant and his squad,
and personally saw that two police of
ficers were stationed at the entrance to
each of the poolrooms. A curious crowd
followed the officers, and it became so
large that it took all the efforts of the
officers to drive them away.
The first place visited was a lodging
house "ii Stockton street, above Mar
ket. Then other places were visited,
mostly common lodging houses of
questionable repute on Market. Mason,
Powell and Stockton streets. On Ellis
street there were eight of these houses,
and the last one visited was the "< 'Id
Sausalito," on Elllis, between Mason
and Powell.
After all the men had been assigned
to their respective places Captain Witt
man said: "We could make no arrests
of the poolsellers because we could not
get them to sell us any tickets. They
â¢will sell to women only, but we will
Btop this business, though it should
take all the men in my division. Any
woman, no matter who she may be,
who makes it a habit to frequent these
places will be arrested for vagrancy.
The husbands and brothers of these
women ought to- look after them. We
ehall see if a few arrests for vagrancy
will not have the effect of calling the
attention of the men to the fact that
their wives and sisters are, possibly
unknown to them, going to places
where they ought not to go. A man
who has a woman relative arrested for
vagrancy is net likely to relish it, but
It seems the only way to close up these
resorts."
If this plan of the police fails, there
is another person who will try an en
tirely different method of procedure in
endeavoring to destroy the evil. It is
Frank J. Kane, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Vice. Secretary
Kane has became keenly interested in
the proceedings, and If he can find that
any women who frequent the poolrooma
have charge of minor children he will
apply to the Superior Court for letters
of guardianship and remove the chil
dren on the ground that the mother is
an unfit and improper person to have
their custody. He said yesterday:
"When I read the article in The Call
about women frequenting these pool
rooms it suggested to me the advisa
bility of making an investigation of the
environments of the children of these
women. Ac there were no names men
tioned, and, of course, the reporter
â would be unlikely to know who they
â¢were, I thought I would bide my time
and wait developments.
"I did not know such pitfalls for mar
ried women, and, as The Call states,
minor girls, existed in the city until I
read it in that paper, and I have been
debating in my mind to-day whether a
man could obtain admittance into these
places. I would like to see personally
â who were there, and especially if any
minor girls frequented the place. I
don't see why the law can be violated
by women and not by men. It seems
true that the police should be able to
break up this poolroom gambling in the
case of both sexes.
"The practice is more demoralizing
In the case of women than of men, as
outside of the demimonde class, which
frequent the resorts, there are a great
many women with families, and I have

been informed that women go down
for a few hours and go to these pool
rooms, while their families suppose
they are shopping, or are at the the
aters.
"I have not looked into the law any
and cannot speak as clearly as I would
like. I have had complaints made of
boys frequenting the pool rooms, but
investigation has shown the reports in
this instance to have been exagger
ated.
"I purpose to investigate, and if I
find that the children of women fre
quenting the pool rooms are neglected
by their mothers' inattention, I shall
make an effort to remove the children
from their custody upon the grounds
that they are not fit and proper per
sons, for the reason that they are
gamblers and the associates of women
uf ill repute. There was a case which
came to my notice a. week ago of a
mother and three daughters living on
Turk street. One of the daughters is
16 years of age, and is known to have
visited one of the pool .rooms within a
block of her home with a woman who
bears an unsavory reputation, and
when I questioned her about it she ad
mitted visiting the place, but saw no
harm In it, as she did not participate
in the gambling.
"I have information from another
source that she has been a capper for
this poolroom. I admonished her about
visiting those places! and she promised
not to do so again, but unfortunately
her mother is a woman of loose habits,
and I fear that the advice will be heed
ed only for the time. I told her if she
persisted in going to such places, she
being still a minor girl, I would appeal
to the Superior Court for letters of
guardianship, and remove her perma
nently from her mother's care."
Here is what some of the representa
tive ladies of the community have to
say about the evil which seems now in
a fair way to be abolished through the
fight made by The Call:
MME. LOUISE- A. SORBIERâ When I
read in The Call of women engaging In
pool room gambling I was simply horri
fied. It Is bad enough for men, but in
women it is so deplorable that if there
is any way at all of suppressing the evil
it should be done. I have heard of women
going to horse races and betting, but
that is a small offense when compared
with this. Everybody should take a hand
to stop it, and the police should stretch
a point to do their duty, moral if not
legal. The CaJl is doing an immense good
by revealing the presence of such a con
cern, and should be supported by a united
effort on the part of all respectable peo-
P IIRS. ADDIE L. BALLOU-This is a
most corrupt city. It is impossible to rear
children here In the way they should be
reared. In my opinion this gambling by
women is most disgraceful, and I think
it the stern duty of the municipal au
thorities to devise some way of putting an
immediate stop to so demoralizing a prac
tice. I believe there are constant re%-ela
tions being made regarding our city,
State and National Government making
it imperative that wives and mothers
should have something to say with regard
to the affairs of civil life. Women have
a great many foibles, but when it
comes to affairs like this, in which
women themselves take a hand In the
furtherance of debauching and demoral
izing Influences, their moral support
woiild be a most potent factor for good.
It might be argued from the fact' that
women patronize these pool rooms that
in preventing these corrupt practices they
would do no better than men, but it is a
fact proved by experience that where men
and women work together they do so to
their mutual advantage and welfare.
-MRS. JULIA SCHLKSSIN'GERâ I think
the practice of gambling on horseracing
and prize-fighting by men is most derog
atory to the well being of a community.
But when it comes io women indulging
in so degrading a nraetlce it is certainly
time to call a halt. As long as honor
remains to womankind there is some hope
for children, but when both fathers and
mothers lose respect for themselves, then
the hope we have for the rising genera
tion looks pretty frail. It seems that the
police ought to be able to stop these de
moralizing practices in some way or
other. If there is no law covering the
offense Â»ow, the Supervisors ought to
frame one without loss of time.
Mrs. John Puttee said: "This is the
most disgraceful thing I ever heard
of. In fact, it is contemptible in the
extreme. The idea that such a place
is allowed to run is more than I can
even believe. It should be condemned
in every way and work should not
cease night or day until the men who
are running such disgraceful and harm
ful resorts were driven out of busi
ness. It is bad enough for the men
to gamble as they do, but when the
women start it is time something was
done. Such places are the ruination
of young girls, a menace to all and a
disgrace to the city. It was a revela
tion to me, but it is hard to tell what
may be expected where law is as slack
as it has been shown to be in this city.
I will do all in my power to help sup
press the evil and I hope nothing will
be left undone which may tend to put
a stop to what may result in the sep
aration and misery of many families."
"Such a state of affairs as The Call
says exists should* certainly be
stopped," said Mrs. Louis Sloss, when
speaking of The Call's expose of the
pool rooms for women. "I not only
think that it is a terrible thing, but I
also think it is wicked. To think of
women going there and spending mon
ey that does not rightfully belong to
them is frightful. How can one help
but support a paper in its crusade
against an evil of this sort? I most
heartily indorse it in every move it
will make in order to prevent this state
of affairs going on. I think that the
paper has opened the eyes of many
who never dreamed of women leading
this sort of life."

THE BOSTONIANS NEXT PRIMA DONNA
HELEN BERTRAM, Who Will Join Her Old Comnanu,
Taking the Place of Alice Nielsen,
Miss Helen Bertram is to be the prima donna of the Bostonians for the
coming season. There have been many suppositions who waa to take the
place of Alice Nielsen, who is to take out a company of her own next sea-
Bon, and at last "the cat is out of the bag."
Miss Bertram was the prima donna t/f the Bostonians the last time they
were to this coast, some three years ago, at which time she made quite a hit.
Previous to that she was with the William Buss Opera Company, and ap
peared in the musical comedy entitled "Miss Helyett."
After leaving the Bostonians she went to London, where, contrary to
the rule, she made a great success. She is now in that city, and will come
to the United States as soon as her season closes over there.
She is a striking beauty of the brunette type, and has a voice of won
derful sweetness. She makes a splendid appearance on the stage, and en
acts the roles allotted to her conscientiously and artistically.
Who will take Eugene Cowles' place as basso is still a matter of specu
lation, but there have been strong hints thrown out that it will be William
Macdonald, who recently joined them as Mr. Cowles' understudy.
Mr. Macdonald was formerly a blacksmith in Redwood City, and he was
"discovered" by the Bostonians just a short time before th^ir departure
frum this city- The people of Redwood City gave Macdonald a reception
on the eve of his departure, and presented him with a diamond .stud. The
gentleman is said to have a voice of much depth and volume. He is a very
handsome young man, and a brilliant future has been predicted for him.
DR. POTTER ON
HIS MUSCLE
Trustees of the Home for
Inebriates to Be
Sued.
The Ex-Superintendent Want 3
to Recover Back Salary
Due Him.
Complaint to BÂ© Filed With the Attor
noy-OenerÂ«l Regarding the
Jewell Trust.
Prior to and since March 1, when Dr.
S. O. L. Potter resigned his position as
superintendent of the Home of Inebri
ates, he has been unsuccessfully en
deavoring' to obtain from the Board of
Trustees a settlement of his claim for
$1700 back salary due him. He has
now instructed his attorney, Gavin Mc-
Nab, to commence suit against the
board for payment of the amount.
When the claim was laid before the
board at its last meeting Dr. Potter
states that the vote stood three for and
three against, and it would have been
passed if it had not been for the oppo
sition of ex-Judge Sawyer, the legal
adviser of the board.
Besides commencing this suit. Dr.
Potter intends to file a complaint with
the Attorney General of the State
against the Board of Trustees in con
nection with the trust fund of $20,000
which his predecessor, Dr. Jewell, be
fore his death gave to the board, bo
that the interest on the money could
be applied toward the care of noor in
ebriates In the home. About six
months ago, while the negotiations
with the Board of Supervisors for the
transference of the home to the city
were pending the trustees handed over
the $20,000 to Mrs. Jewell, the widow
of the late doctor. Dr. Potter contends
that this action of the trustees was il
legal, as the trust money could not be
returned without an order of court and
he holds that the trustees are person
ally responsible to the citizens for the
amount.
In speaking of the matter yesterday
Dr. Potter said: "I protested at the
time against returning the money to
the widow without the consent of the
court, but I was overruled by Judge
Sawyer. I was Dr. Jewell's physician
at the time he transferred the $20,000 to
the trustees, the interest to be used
for the care of po.or inebriates, and it
was through my advice that he did so.
The trustees have since then â at least
up to the time the $20,000 was trans
ferred to the widow â been using the in
terest for the care of poor inebriates,
and I contend that they hid no right,
without the consent of the court, to
part with the money, as it was a trust
for the benefit of the citizens.
"Why, City Attorney Creswell gavfi
his opinion that the trustees could not
even transfer the home property to the
city without an order of court, because
it was held in trust, being the property
of the people, and I see no difference
between that and money given in trust
for the benflt of the people.
"I have been led to understand that
the opposition to paying my claim for
back salary is due to the stand I have
taken in regard to this trust money, but
I mean to see it through and also re
cover the money due me. My attorney
will file the papers in the suit just as
soon as he has time and then I will
take steps to bring the other matter to
the attention of the Attorney- General.
"In an interview with Judge Sawyer,
published in the Examiner last month,
he accuses me of arrogance. My arro
gance consisted in taking exception to
his advice on legal points, and the re
sult always proved that i was right and
he was wrong. He referred to some
thing occurring that changed his opin
ion of me and he led people to infer
that it was something I should be
ashamed of, but it waa simply my claim
for back salary and my protest against
the return of the trust money."
CANADIAN PACIFIC TRADE.
Western Commercial Bodies Demand
Their Rights at Washington.
The Sacramento Chamber of Commerce
is following fast on the steps taken by the
San Francisco chamber In the matter of
the unjust governmental regulations
which are throwing the trade of this
country to the Canadian railroad and di
verting the same from the roads of the
United States. The attitude of the Sac
ramento body is shown by the following
extract from a letter' sent to' the local
body In which co-operation is asked and
promised, and which reads as follows:
Whereas, By reason of the aid given by
the Canadian Government to the Can
adian Pacific Railway it has great advan
tages over the purely American railways
and is enabled to deprive them of a. large
part of the carrying trade, which of right
be.longs to them; and whereas, the
amount of business thus diverted . from
the American roads annually is estimated
at about $50,000,000, which sum should be
saved to the people of the United States,
as it would give employment to our own
people; and whereas, the commercial in
terests of Canada are being built up at
the expense of the United States; there
fore be it
Resolved, By the Sacramento Chamber
of Commerce that our representatives in
Congress be urgently requested to favor
such legislation as will protect American
commerce and give to American labor and
American capital ample protection against
unfair foreign competition.
FOR THE USE OF VETERANS.
Members of the G. A. R. to Have 9

flags and other relics that the veterans
cherish will he displayed In a room ad

Auditor Broderick brought the matter
up, stating that he 'had been spoken to
about It and that he favored allowing
the veterans any privilege that could le
gally be granted by the commission. Mr.
Broderick was su p ported by Commis

adjoining his quarters was vacant and

PLEAD FOR
HILL'S LIFE
A Petition Sent to the Gov
ernor Asking for
Clemency.
W. W. Foote Claims That the
Murderer Was Insane
at the Time.
Crazed by the Startling Announce
ment of the Illegitimacy of
His Child.
The fate of Benjamin A. Hill, now
under sentence of death for the crime'
of uxoricide, committed some months
ago in Oakland, will be decided by
Governor Budd next Tuesday. The ap
peal of W. W. Foote, who has persist
ently fought the case in the interest of
Hiil, and who succeeded six months ago
in grasping the murderer from the gal
lows on the night before the day set
for his hanging, on a writ of habeas
corpus, will be considered by the chief
executive and a final decision rendered,
either setting aside the Judgment of
death, which is to be carried into ef
fect April 6, or commuting it to life Im
prisonment.
It appears from the evidence ad
duced that there are a number of ex
tenuating circumstances to be allowed
for the crime for which Hill is now
convicted.
Attorney Foote, in speaking of the
principal arguments that will be ad
vanced when the case comes up for
hearing, set forth the following facts
as the basis of the defense:
"We will endeavor to prove," said th*
attoreny. "that Hill, when he com
mitted the crime for which he is to
suffer death, was in the heat of pas
sion and despair caused by the start
ling announcement of his wife that thÂ«
child whom she had given birth to
and which he always thought was his
legitimate offspring and the infant she
was shortly to bring into the world
were not his children. He became en
raged, and acting under the impulse
of the moment, which was one of rage,
disappointment and despair, he took
the life of the woman, and with it that
of the unborn child.
"When he was brought up for trial
and the circumstances of the case
were placed in the hands of the Jurors,
eight of whom are now pleading for
his life, for consideration he was ad-
Judged guilty of the crime charged and
sentenced to death on the scaffold for
the expiation of it.
"It was at this juncture In the case
that I decided, at the request of a num
ber of friends of Hill and prominent
men and women all over the State, to
take up the case and endeavor to have
the sentence of death commuted to that
of imprisonment, as the man in my im
pression was not in his right mind at
the time, but was crazed by the an
nouncement that his children were il
legitimate and not his.
"About six months ago," he con
tinued, "I applied to the Governor for a
pardon, but being ill at the time my
petition fell into the hands of Lieuten
ant Governor Jeter, who was acting
chief executive in the absence of Budd.
"Jeter went over the arguments of
the case and refused to grant a com
mutation of the original sentence of
death; but his refusal to ac. in the mat
ter wiil have no bearing in the present
petition, as he has advised Budd not to
act on his judgment in the cass, but
consider the arguments for himself and
pass judgment on them according to
his own discretion."
Foote claims he is receiving absolute
ly no remuneration for his services and
that he is defraying the expense of car
rying on the defense from the lucre In
his own purse.
"I think the man Is deserving of len
iency," he said, "^id h^ing of this opin
ion I intend to fight the case in behalf
of my client to the end, whatever that
may be."
The following are a few r â¢ the names
of prominent men that have been af
fixed to the petition for clemency:
George W. Baker, F. W. Mowry, Judge
Carroll Cook, Stephen White, Judge
Oster of San Bernardino County and
George La Monte.
Foote claims he has a letter In his
possession which was written by a sis
ter of the murdered woman on behalf
of the man who was resposible for her
death.
Making a Technical Defense.
Judge Cook yesterday listened to argu
ments on the motion made to dismiss the
indictment against School Director Wal
ler, who was recently indicted by the
ADVERTISEMENTS.
A PECULIAR FACT.
Thousands of People Have Dyspepsia in Its
Worst Form and Do Not Know It.
A weak stomach is the cause of
about nine-tenths of all disease, yet in
most cases the wrong thing Is treated
and the true cause overlooked.
This is because a weak digestion pro-
duces symptoms resembling nearly
every disease, because it weakens and
disturbs the action of every nerve and
organ in the body; poor digestion
causes heart trouble, kidney troubles,
lung weakness and especially nervous
breakdown or nervous prostration; the
nerves cannot stand the wear and tear
unless generously fed by well digested,
wholesome food.
Keep the digestion good and no one
need fear the approach of disease.
Mrs. M. H. Lee of Rochester, N. V.,
writes: For the sake of suffering hu-
manity I want to say that from a child
I had a very, weak stomach, threw up
my food very often after eating, and
after a few years' nervous dyspepsia
resulted, and for more than twenty
years I have suffered inexpressibly.
I tried many physicians and adver-
tised remedies, with only temporary re-
lief for nervous dyspepsia, and not u^
til I commenced taking Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets last September, six
months ago, have 1 been free from suf-
fering, caused by the condition of my
nerves and stomach; in short, chronic
nervous dyspepsia.
I have recommended Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets to many of my friends,
and now I want in a public way to say
they are the safest, pleasantest and I
believe surest cure for stomach and
nerve troubles. I write my honest
opinion, and I will gladly answer any
letter of inquiry at any time and feel
that I am, in my small way, helping on
a good cause.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is not a
patent medicine, but they contain only
the fruit salts, digestive acids and
peptones necessary to help the weak
stomach to promptly and thoroughly
digest food.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at 50 cents for full-sized pack-
age, and any one suffering from ner-
vous dyspepsia, sour stomach, head-
aches, acidity, gases, belching, etc..
will find them not only a quick relief
but a" radical cure.
Send to Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich,,
for little book describing cause and
cure of stomach troubles, giving symp-
toms and treatment of the various
forma of indigestion.
fimnrl Jury The defense Interposed a
d G eTurrer! n on the ground that if Waller
was guilty of any crime it would not
amount to more than a misdemeanor,
while the indictment charges felony.
After listening to the argument of coun
sel. Judge Cook gave both sides one
week's time in whicji to file their briefs,
citing the law bearing on the case.
OPIUM SMOKING.
Extent to Which the Drug Is Used
Shown by the Enormous Duty
Collected.
The Surveyor of the Port has been fig
uring on the duties being received for
opium Imported from China into this port.
He has found that during the year IS9.
there were received as duties on lai yuen
(opium for smoking purposes) $728,403 85.
From January 1. 1898, and up to and in
cluding yesterday there were paid as du
ties on the same article $146,340. There are
In the bonded warehouse 20,315 pounds of
lai yuen on which the duty at $6 per pound
is $121,890.
It is expected that the Belglc, due^here
next Tuesday, will bring between $300,000
and $400,000 worth of opium.
This drug is distributed from San Fran
cisco all over the United States. The fact
that it is of the kind used only for smok
ing shows the great extent to which a
vicious and demoralizing habit is prac
ticed, not only among the Chinese, but
among Americans.
Opium used for medicine and for the
manufacture of morphine, laudanum and
paregoric is imported into the United
States from Turkey, and is known com
mercially as Turkish opium. It comes to
California via New York by rail.
Starving in Squalor.
Secretary Dimpfel of the Eureka So
ciety for the Protection of Children has
taken from their parents the children of
Charles and Maggie Patterson. From in
formation received by him it was evident
that the little ones, who are seven and
two and a half years of age, were being
sadly neglected by their mother. The
latter is said to be given to drink and
the father is none too particular, al
though he provides fairly well for the
household. The money goes for liquor
and the children are compelled to go
hungry much of the time in consequence.
"When the secretary found the children
they had not had anything to eat for at
least twenty-four hours. Their surround
ings were filthy in the extreme. Colonel
Dlmnfel has applied for letters of guard
ianship over the children.

how toTfind out.
Fill a bottle or common glass with
your water and let it stand twenty-four
hours: a sediment or settling indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys;
if it stains your linen it is evidence of
kidney trouble; too frequent desire to
pass it or pain in the back is also con-
vincing proof that the kidneys and
bladder are out of order.
WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy,
fulfills every wish' in relieving pain in
the back, kidneys, liver, bladder and
every part of the urinary passages. It
corrects inability to hold water and
scalding pains in passing it, or bad
effects following use of liquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to get up
many times during the night. The mild
and the extraordinary effect of Swamp-
Root is soon realized. It stands the
highest for its wonderful cures of the
most distressing cases. If you need a
medicine you should have the best. Sold
by druggists; price fifty cents and one
dollar. You may have a sample bottle
and pamphlet both sent free by mail
upon receipt of thrr#' two-cent stamps
to cover cost of postage on the bottle.
Mention San Francisco Sunday Call, and
send your address to Dr. Kilmer & Co.,
Binghamton. N. T. The proprietors of
this paper guarantee the genuineness ot
this offer." '

Considering that yesterday was
anything but a pleasant day for out
door sports, the gathering at the Union
coursing park was surprisingly large.
The coursing commenced as usual in
the forenoon and finished in good sea

opportunity to reach their respective

The man who shipped the "game will

Hares Were Fast at
the Ingleside Grounds
Yesterday.
The Talent Came Out Ahead,
With One or Two Start
ling Exceptions.
It Is Thought There Will Be Heavy
Betting on the Ties
To-Day.
A large Saturday crowd visited the
Ingleside coursing grounds yesterday to
witness the run down in the stake of
fered to various owners of good hounds.
The sport throughout the day was ex
ceedingly good and without doubt the
betting will be, heavy to-day on the final
results. The hares were in splendid con
dition and many of them made their es
cape. Very few short-enders carried
away the money. Little Dell, in the last
course , and Sylvanus, in the first,
rather bothered the talent.
It is not a surprise that Dr. Van
Hummel's hounds are coming to the
front, as they have been taken and
placed in good hands. For a few
weeks they did not show up as well as
expected, but according to the ideas of
many dog followers the doctor will have
some stake winners before the season
is over. Van Cloie is showing up re
markably well, and as Chit Chat is
going against the best of them it is no
wonder that the knowing ones are
waiting for a good thing in the way of
Van Hummel's hounds. "Wait until
they are acclimated," he said, "and
there will be some fun."
The strongest play of the day was on
Henry Springs Dawn, and the way the
course ended it was a 30 to 1 shot, al
though the best odds given did not ex
ceed 5 to 1. Sweet Music did not ap
pear in the course with Silkwood, and
in consequence Forget ran a bye with
the entered hound and was beaten in
an easy fashion. Kingston nearly
proved a surprise to the talent, as a no
go was run with Mohawk, who is
known to be exceedingly speedy, but in
the second slip Mohawk gained all the
points. The run down to-^ay will with
out doubt prove interesting from all
standpoints.
Grace looked at it this way:
In the run down W. C. Glasson's Syl
vanua beat J. J. Edmonds' Foreet; H.
Hanrahan's Mercury beat H. H. Devine's
Forget-Me-Not;V\V. Ryan's Soprano beat
Batt & Frank's Count of Monte Cristo;

Benicia Boy; M. Michallk's Fire Ball beat

TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
Doubles at the California Courts
Yesterday Afternoon.
The gentlemen's double tournament at
the California Tennis Club yesterday did
not draw as many entries as was antici
pated. But what it lacked in number
was made up by the single match of the
two teams which will contest on the
courts of Placer County next week. For
the first time since preparations have j
begun for the Penryn tournament Brad-
Bhaw and Bob Whitney were pitted
against â¢ George Whitney and Walter
Magee.
George "Whitney and Magee started out
to play fast bail. By clever smashing
on the part of Magee and accurate plac
ing on the part of Whitney the first set
was won by their combined excellence of
play. In this set Bob Whitney had not j
let himself loose. The score was 6â4.6 â 4.
Robert N. Whitney and Bradshaw cap- j
tured the second set by the same score,
after some very stubbornly fought points
and changes from deuce to vantage and
back again. The third set was somewhat !
of a gift to Bob Whitney and Bradshaw,
both of whom played excellent ball
throughout the set. The score was 6â3.
The complete score was 4â6,4 â 6, 6â4,6 â 4, 6â3.6 â 3.
The other matches were not so inter
esting and were of i.n inferior order.
Davis and* Hooper beat Walters and
Stauf, 7â5. 3â6, Câ 3. Code and McGavin
,b< â at Hooper and Davis, &â l, oâ6, 6â4.6 â 4.
Pieher, Stanford's representative tennis
player, was on the courts yesterday, and
he undertook to discuss matters in ac
tion with Ralph Bliven. Pieher had things
his own way, defeating Bliven 6â3, 6â2,
6â3.
The tournament will continue to-day.

Another Will Broken.
The contest over the will of the late
Captain William Brown was concluded
in Judge Coffey's court yesterday by the
Jury returning a verdict in favor of the
contestants. Brown left an estate valued
at $20,000, and having cut off some of his
nearest relative* with nominal amounts,
they decided to make a contest. The jury
by the verdict returned were of the
opinion ...at Brown had not only been un
duly Influenced, but that he was of un
sound mind at the time he drew the will.

POTTER'S FIELD
HIS LAST REST
Hermit Luce's Life Was In

Dollars.
The Policy-Holder, a. Capitalist, Re
fuses to Pay for Burial of
the Remains.
Deputy Coroner Hallett, having learned
that Henry W. I-use, a capitalist whose
residence is at 18 Kssex street, held a
$2000 policy of insurance upon the life of
Franklin Luce, the hf-rmit who died last
Friday on the Blue r.tim tract, made in
quir'- of Mr. Luse yesterday as to wheth
er he intended to defray the expenses of
the burial of the deceased, or whether
the city would be saddled with the bur
den of burying him In the potter's iield.
The capitalist replied that he would not
pay out a dollar for the burial of the
body of the man by whose death he was
to come into possession of $2000. When
asked his reasons for this strange course,
Mr. I, use said that he h<il advanced more
than the amount of the policy to the de
ceased in his life time, and that he did
not feel justified in sending any more
good mone-" after bad money.
The deceased was â¬0 years old. and had
his life insured in 18S3 in Friendship
Lodge Knights of Honor, in this city.
He afterwai transt'env<l the policy to
Capitalist Luse, who 1? said to be not

CHOYNSKI HAS
BLOOD POISON
His Left Arm and Right
Shoulder Are Inoc
ulated.
The Poison Has Also Caused
an Affection of the
Heart.
The Doctors Say That Joe Will Have
to Rest for a Long
' r Time.
Racked with pain and tormented by
a dread illness, Joe Choynski is now
waiting with much anxiety for the next
few days to pass. He is suffering from
blood poisoning, and, though his physi
cians think there is no immediate dan
ger, his illness is a serious one.
The cause is not positively known, but
it is believed to have been due to in
oculation from a sore on the arm of,
George Green, with whom Choynski
sparred while the former was training
for his fight with Ryan. However he
came by it, it is certain that Joe is now
in great physical agony, and that the
poison has coursed through his veins
' for some time. The trouble has brought
with it attendant affections, and Joe's
heart is now in pretty bad shape. Dur
ing the last few days he suffered from
severe palpitations. His physician, Dr.
Gallwey, also finds an enlargement of
the cardiac organ.
About a week before the Ryan-Green
fight, while boxing with Green, Choyn
ski tore a patch of skin off his left
arm just above the elbow. They boxed
for some time after the accident,
clinching, wrestling and righting at
close quarters. George Green was at
tbis time afflicted with a crop of boils,
and it is thought that Choynski's open
skin wound came in contact with
Green's boils, and the result was blood
poisoning.
Joe noticed the scratch on his arm
and its evident unwillingness to heal
some time prior to the Sharkey battle.
At times his left arm would grow stiff,
and massage was necessary to lubricate
it for rapid use in bag punching. It
did not pain him then, but it was a
source of annoyance. Last Monday
the left arm grew stiff, and on Tuesday
night, in the presence of Ed Graney,
Choynski stripped to show his bosom
friend the sore on his arm. Then for
the first time Joe noticed a long black
stripe on the inside of the left upper
arm. Joe began to work his arm in.
ami out, when suddenly he straight
ened up and fainted dead away. Gra
ney did not lose a moment, but tele
phoned for Dr. Gallwey, who has been
in attendance ever since.
Not only is the left arm swollen, but
the right shoulder is in the same
condition. Poultices were applied to
the sore places and the puss drawn to
the surface. It was necessary to lance
the arm and shoulder last night.
It will be some time before Joe Cho
ynski steps into the ring again. The
affection of the heart will demand a
long: rest, and the roots of the poison
will have to be eradicated before Cho
ynski can do anything physically vio
lent. His physician thinks it a miracle,
that he could have fought at all with
his heart in such a condition.
HIT HER ON THE NOSE.
Serious Charge Made Against Police
Officer Colen.
Annie Watson, a woman who has been
Â«rrested several times for vagrancy,
made a serious charge in Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday morning against
Policeman Colon.
Colen had her up for vagrancy again,
and she testified that he had been hound
ing her for years. After he arrested her
on the last occasion she ran away from
him while he was ringing up the patrol
wagon, and after he caught her again he
struck her on the nose with such force
as to make It bleed, and made use of
strong language at the same time. His
antipathy to her was because she would
not give him more 50 cent pieces.
Colen dented striking the woman, and
said that her nose was bleeding when he
arrested her. He also denied getting any
money from her.
The Judge continued the case for a
week, and will Investigate the charges
brought against the policeman.

HOW MUCH RENT DO YOU PAY?
How long have you been paying it ?
And what have you to show for It?
$20â $30â $40 goes out the first of every month
and never a cent comes back. The landlord
prospers and his bank account swells. He finds
nouse-building and house-renting a very pay-
Ing business. Now, why shouldn't you do the
same?
Why shouldn't you be your own landlord?
Why not do as hundreds of other people have
done^ those happy, prosperous houpeholders
in the Heyman Tract have done? It's easy â
Just as easy as paying rent, anil a good deal
more profitable. You pay a certain sum each
month, and when your payments have amount-
ed to the value of the property it is yours.
While you are making these payments you can
imagine they are rents you are paying and
you'll find them the most profitable rents you
ever paid. You can see these elegant Heyman
Tract homes by taking the Misslon-st. cars,
transferring to Twenty-second L and riding
to Hoffman aye.. when. JAMES COTTER will
show you around. JACOB HEYMAN, 11 Mont-
gomery st., will give you any Information you
may desire.

as it does, an unobstructed view of the Golden

' ity as being indispensable in the construction
of such a building.
The said hospital building to be erected on
the lot of land selected and approved by the
Board of Health described as follows:
Commencing at the most southeasterly cor-
ner of a tract of land known as and desig-

The attractiveness of the card drew
the largest crowd of the semi-monthly
meeting to Oakland track yesterday.
Then, too, the weather was warm and
summery, which seemed to thaw out
the cold feeling existing among many
racegoers during the early portion of
the meeting. The card was an espe
cially good one, two stakes, the Flying,
for two-year-old fillies, and the Pacific
Union, for all ages, being set for deci
sion. It was the latter event In which
the greater amount of Interest was
centered. The distance was one mile
and a furlong, and all looked to see a
battle royal between the crack three
year-old Traverser and the great mare,
Fleur de Lis, and what a surprise
awaited them, for the rank outsider,
Linstock, made a show of his field.
The conditions called for 106 pounds
on Traverser and 115 on the mare, and
in the opening betting each opened up
at 6 to 5. The odds against Fleur de
Lis lengthened to 5 to 2, when her par
tisans began to unloosen and the books
cut to twos. Traverser closed a 3 to 2
choice. Senator Bland, with 114 in the
saddle, was next in demand at 6 to 1,
with 6 chalked against the Corrigan
entry, Won't Dance, and 12 offered
about Linstock, with his light impost
of 88 po-unds and Clawson to do the pi
loting. He was thought to be lacking
in class, however, and went begging for
friends. There was absolutely no part
of the journey when the latter gelding
did not have the race up his sleeve. As
expected, Traverser went out at a ter
rific clip, with Fleur de Lis close up,
"Skeets" Martin evidently not intend
ing that the favorite should lose him.
The six furlongs were rattled off in
l:l3^i, the mile in 1:39%, with both of
the two leaders beginning to falter.
Once headed for the wire, Dick Claw
son gave Linstock his head, and the
son of Logic romped in the easiest sort
of a winner, three lengths ahead of
Won't Dance, in 1:53 flat. Senator
Bland also passed the tiring choices, se
curing the short end of the prize.
Traverser stopped to nothing after go
ing a mile and a sixteenth, but Fleur
de Lis hung on with remarkable game
ness.
It was a squally afternoon for the
favorites, Dr. Marks and Chappie be
ing the only ones to bring home the
coin. Nearly all of the winners, with
the exception of Linstock, were accord
ed good support, and the books did not
salt away any great amount of coin.
Clawson carried away the riding hon
ors, piloting two past the post in front.
The talent were nearly turned upside
down over the result of the Flying
stake at four furlongs, for fillies. Mag
dalenas, which had already taken two
stakes in the past and was supposed
to possess stake quality, was plugged
for a "moral" at the short price of 4 to
5. The Burns & Waterhouse pair, Win
ifred and Humidity, had third call in
the betting. Ed Corrigan thought
Winifred, with Sloan in the saddle, had
a chance second to none, and she was
second choice at post time. It was
tipped about that Sevens, the entry of
Nick Hall, had stepped a half in 48M:
seconds, and the long-shot division got
aboard, getting 15 to 1. The start was
only a fair one. The favorite broke
from behind, but quickly showed out
in front, chased by the Baldwin filly,
Reina de Cuba. The clip was a killing
one and when the stretch was reached
MeXichols, with the leg up on Sevens
next the rail, assumed the lead. The
latter became a trifle rattled as the
wire was neared, but managed to keep
his mount in the lead, gaining the ver
dict by a head from the fast-coming

discard a pair of kings In preference to a
pair of sevens. If Sevens catches as many

CITY VERSUS
THE INTERIOR
The Old-Time Struggle
Has Again Broken
Out. 0
Candidates Have Outlined a
Complete County Ticket
Already.
The Fay Territory Plans to Leave
the Interior Out of Its
Combine.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. March 19.
Until the settlement of the water-front
question and the location of large indus
tries along the estuary, the chief voca
tion in Alameda County will continue to
be politics. As the situation develops it
becomes more and more clear that there
will be a little friction between the city
and the outside districts. In a Republi
can convention the city vote is about
equal to that of the townships, and the
city has got away with most of the of
iices because of an alliance with either
Alameda or Berkeley or both. "She up
per country has always rebelled, but to
no effect, and everything has remained
around the bay, and even then the city
dtMegates have regretted that geographi
cal conditions alone forced the electing
of one Supervisor from Washington and
Murray townships. Oakland grabbed the
other four.
Now there is the usual feeling between
city and country, and even now It is
clear that the interior will have to do
conic active organizing if it is to avoid
K'-ttlng left in the cold at the conven
tion. Of course the Assembly Districts
cannot be invaded by the city candi
dates, but. outside of this, some com
binations have been made that almost
presage a complete ticket.
After being Under Sheriff for twenty -
two years, through administrations of all
shades of politics, Will S. Harlow has
given out that he would like to be boss
for one term. He has often been "men
tioned" in the past, but now he says he is
in earnest. Oscar Rogers, Chief of Police
of Alameda, is also a candidate and has
done a lot of preliminary work, but he Is
somewhat handicapped owing to the en
ergy of Joe Barber, Tax Collector, who
lias already organized a Republican club
in the Encinal town named after himself.
This leaves no doubt about there being at
least one candidate from Alameda, and
with having already a Superior Judge,
Oakland may decide that Alameda must
not be too ambitious. Rogers, however, is
not likely to let any one dictate to him.
There are occasional whisperings that
Assessor H. P. Dalton may be a candi
date for L. C. Morehouse's seat on the
State Board of Equalization. These sug
gestlona are Insincere and seem to be ex
3'loited for the purpose of creating uncer
tainty regarding his position. It is all fol
ly, for Dalton has already declared that
he will seek to succeed himself, and this
should be conclusive.
In the disposal of the other offices Oak
land and Berkeley appear to have already
led upon those who shall fill them.
In sizing up the gubernatorial situation
t -night the Tribune says:
imeda County naturally comes first
snd would doubtless have things pretty
ich her own way if she would only
B on one candidate and make a unit
-rht for him. The way things are
: here now, though, is forbidding for
â iccoss of either Davis or Pardee,
and if they go into convention under the
nt conditions it will be impossible
for either of them to secure the nomina-
However, there is a feeling abroad
that they â will find some manner of set
tling their differences sooner or later, and
if they do â well, it will be the Alameda

HE ELOPED
WITH HIS WIFE
Mrs. Fannie Gilchrist Has
Left Her Father's
Home.
Originally Eloped and Was
Married on Christmas
Eve.
Left Her Husband for Seme Months
and Again Flees to Join
Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 19.
The little town of Clayton, across the
county line, has furnished a real elope
ment. It is that of a young husband
and wife who were being kept apart.
The final act in this Contra Costa ro
mance is the sequel to the other elope
ments that occurred about three months
ago.
On Christmas eve Roy Frazer Gilchrist !
and Miss Fannie Rhine, the daughter of
a rancher, were married in this city. The J
bride was supposed to be visiting her sis
ter, and after a few days' honeymoon j
she returned home and remained with her
parents, not telling them of what she had
done. A little later, Miss Fannies sister â¢
Hilda planned an elopement and was
secretly married in San Francisco. Then j
ih<' story of Loth elopements was made
public.
Even after acquainting her parents with
the fact that she was married, Mrs. Fan
nie Gilchrist was persuaded to stay at i
home. She gave out that she was tired j
of matrimony ajid succeeded in creating i
an impression that her brief married ltfe
had caused her to regard the venture as a
failure. This continued until last Thurs
day.
On that day the train that arrives at
Clayton at 7 o'clock in the evening |
brought Mr. Gilchrist from Oakland. By I
an arrangement, evidently preconcerted, I
the young wife left her parents' home at j
the same hour. A vehicle was procured, I
and the young husband did the Lochinvar
act toward Martinez.
As soon as the girl was missed there
was a hunt; bui -j.r. and Mrs. Gilchrist
had obtained a good start and could not
be overtaken. Even if her parents had I
caught the fleeing husband and wife, they !
could have done nothing. Mr. Gilchrist j
has caused it to be Known that he and his
wife are in a camfortable riew home, Dut
he does not intend to invite a possible i
abduction by letting everybody know !
where it is located. Now both daughters I
are living with their husbands, and the i
Rhine ranch is desolate.

BERKELEY'S NEW PAPEB.
Striking Printers Publish the First
Number of the Daily Press.
BERKELEY, March 19.â "The Berkeley
Daily Press," an evening paper published
by the "locked-out printers of Berkeley,"
made its first appearance this evening.
Charles L. Andrews is editor, C. F.
Guenther business manager, and Ben
jamin Hamilton the assistant business
manager .of the new paper, which, it
announces, is edited and printed entirely
by the locked-out printers. The strikers,
iri the salutatory editorial of their paper,
say: "We are 'here to stay' â so long as
legitimate business methods will justify
our doing so. If we cannot make both j
ends meet, we shall not act like the dog
In the mangerâ we will step out of the
field, leaving, it to some one who may be
able to profit by the experience of his ;
predecessors."
A third walk-out of printers occurred
in the Gazette printing office to-day. Last

taken the places of the strikers, walked
out. Seven more non-union men followed
them to-day. Business Manager Louis i

ing that the strike was off â that a con- '
ference had been held with the Oakland
Typographical Union, and that the difÃ
eolty had been adjusted.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
OPPOSES A TUG
BOAT WEDDING
Mrs. Church Applies to
the Courts for a Legal
Separation.
Her Boy and Angie Foster Ran
Away From High
School.
After the Elopement They Went to
the Islands, but Could Not
Live on Love.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 19.
The marriage of two children on a
tugboat outside the heads is to be le
gally annulled.
About a year ago Albert T. Church
and Angie Foster, two students of the
Oakland High School, who believed they
were deeply in love, went outside the
Golden Gate and were supposed to be
married. Mrs. S. J. Church, the groom's
mother, has filed an action, in which she
states that her son, who was but 16
years of age, evaded the jurisdiction of
the courts, and purports to have been
married on the high seas. She asserts
that the so-called marriage was not sol
emnized by either a Justice of the Peace
or any other competent official, and that
no license was issued for the marriage.
He did not procure his mother's con
sent, and she asks that the alleged mar
riage be declared null and void and that
her son "may be dealt with according
to law"â whatever that may mean.
After the marriage the young people
went to Honolulu, and young Church
tried to work to support himself and
wife. He took what , little money he
possessed with him, but it soon gave
out, and the children found that the
island was not a desirable place for ro
mantic youngsters.
They remained in Honolulu for several
months, and when starvation faced them
they were sent money to come back to
Oakland. For a time they kept in the
background, and their parents provided
for them.
The young wife is now sto^-^e with
her parents, and the boy-husband, not
yet 17, is at a boarding school outside of
this city, and every effort is made to
keep the children apart. The fact that
Church wot not of age will of course se
cure the annulment of the marriage. The
lad's mother is his guardian, and she as
serts that at present he has no means of
subsistence except that which she gives
him. The boy is not opposed to the action
of his mother, and if he were it would
benefit him nothing, as only with her con
sent could he fight the suit.
It Is stated that the young folks are as
much in love with each other as ever,
and that should the marriage be annulled
they will remarry as Boon as they are of
legal age.

MOVE TOMPKINS SCHOOL.
New Location Secured on Castro
Street, North of Seventh.
OAKLAND, March 19.â Arrangements
have practically been made for the ex
change of the Tompkins school site for a
lot of equal area upon Castro street,
north of the Seventh street railroad
tracks. The Lincoln, Cole and Lafayette
schools are overcrowded, and the Board
of Education has taken this opportunity
to secure desirable property in order that
the building could be moved, if the crowd
ed condition continues next term.
The Tompklns School has never served
its purpose. Being: so near to the marsh,
â with such poor surroundings, pupils have
avoided It, Parents have found excuses
to have their children transferred to one
of the other schools In the district, and
there has almost always been room for
200 or more pupils. During the past two
years It has been conducted under the
direct supervision of the head of the de
partment of pedagogy of the State Uni
versity. A change of location would
mean that the 200 additional pupils could
be taught without any additional cost,
as a full complement of teachers are al
ways employed there.
The move could be made at an expense
not to exceed $5000, it is believed. It would
be necessary to cut the building In three
parts to move it and then reunite them.
The consent of the City Council is neces
sary before this can be done, but it is
believed that they will willingly accept
the plans of the board.
Guarded by Policemen.
OAKLAND, March 19.â Officers Dow
ney and Halm have been detailed to
watch Joseph H. Moffett at the Receiving
Hospital during the nights to make sure
that he does not escape. This was done
at the suggestion of Drs. R. T. Stratton
and J. I* Milton, who are attending the
injured man. They claim that he is

NO BELIEF FOR McINTOSH.
His Habeas Corpus Case in the
Supreme Court a Failure.
Attorney B. W. Mclntosh is in the
same predicament a* the parrot that had
been talking too much. He is stripped
of his dignity and will have to stand the
punishment for monkeying with Judge
Carroll Cook in the matter of trying to
sell an alleged bogus confession of his
client, Albert Hoff, who is now on trial
for murder. Judge Cook on Friday
fined the attorney $000 and sentenced him
to five days' Imprisonment for peddling
the so-called confession of his client to
the editor /fend a reporter of an ochre
colored paper given to sensationalism.
In this he acted in bad Tfaith with his
client and interfered with the course of
justice so far as the court was con
cerned, and he went to jail for it.
Yesterday Mclntosh made an attempt
to secure his liberty from the Broadway
bastile by suing out a writ of habeas
corpus in the Supreme Court, but there
ho was no more successful* than in the
lower court. He was represented by
Attorneys Black and Hill, while the
lower court and the people were repre
sented by Deputy District Attorney Hos
mer and ex-Judge Murphy. The peti
tioner claimed that the lower court had
no jurisdiction of the alleged contempt,
and that the action of contempt was
without the hearing of the court, and
that It had no bearing on the outcome
of the case. Attorney Black argued,
conceding that Mclntosh did lie to the
reporter and did tell him that he had
Hoff' s written confession, when as a
fact there was none made, that could
not be construed as a contempt of court,
especially when the conversation com
plained of was at night, on the street
and without the presence of the court.
The further contention was made that
the proceedings were irregular in that
there waa no title given to the proceed
ings of contempt, and that the state
ment in the affidavit of the reporter
was not sufficient to show Judicial
knowledge of the contempt.
The contention opposing the petition
was that the affidavit of the reporter
showed that McTntosh attempted to ex
tort money from a newspaper by offer
ing to sell what he did not possess, if
no confession was made, and if one was
made, he was the principal in an at
tempt to disturb the course of the court
at the time of the trial of Hoff. In
either case he was guilty of contempt
Attorney Murphy argued that the peti
tioner was not guilty of carelessness in
talking to a reporter as he did, nor was
it negligence. He was guilty of a crime
and deserving of punishment. The Su
preme Court Justices also thought so,
for they dismissed the writ and ordered
the disgraced lawyer into the custody
of the Sheriff. *
CHARGED WITH BURGLARY.
John Hart Accused of Looting a

HORSE RACING
Special Committee Votes
for Forty-Eight Days
Only.
Pacific Jockey Club May Re<

to Emeryville.
A Number of Supervisors Known
to Be in Favor of the
Order.
If an ordinance that will be recomi
mended at to-morrow's session of the
Board of Supervisors is adopted racing
in San Francisco wil' close for the
present at least, and those who desire
to witness or wager on the running of
the bangtails will have to journey to
Oakland to witness the sport.
The special committee to which was
referred Supervisor Clinton's order re
stricting racing to forty-eight days in
each year and abolishing such institu
tions as ladies' days met yesterday,
those present being Supervisors Clinton
and Kivers.
Supervisor Smith, who is against re
stricting racing, wa^ ..iavoidably ab
sent.
Supervisor Rivers stated that as long
as his own order entirely ohibiting
racing had failed to pass he was in
favor of Supervisor Clinton's substi
tute. He thought that racing as now
conducted â on a pool-selling basisâ wai
prejudicial to the be interests of the
community and should be restricted if
it could not be altogether abolished.
Supervisor Clinton supported his
measure in a similar v !: stating that
he had heard that *" - nrofits of the
Ingleside track during the past year
had reached the enormous sum of 5400,
000 and that such an expenditure could
not help but be a drain on the finances
of the city, particularly as the book
makers were also making immense
sums from their onerations.
By the votes of the two Supervisors
present it was decided to recommend
the Clinton order for passage at to
morrow's meeting. A number of votes
among them, that of Supervisor Shee
han, have been pledged to its support.
The proposed ordinance is as follows:
Order No. â , determining and restrict
ing the time in which poolselling. book
making or betting on races or other con
tests between horses on racetracks may
be conducted.
Whereas, the practice of horse racing
as formerly carried on in this city and
county was intended to and did en;ourage
the breeding of fast horses, and such
emulation so engendered was of some
material benefit to the State; and
Whereas, While the same reason is
given for the continuance of race meet
ings, it now appears and the results
show that the great success of thesu
trials of speed of different horses is be
cause of the interest taken by the young
and old of both sexes in the purchase oi
pools and in the making of bets and
wagers; and
Whereas, The fact appears that, not
satisfied with the attendance of the
male and female patrons that ordinarily
attend such meetings, the managers or
proprietors of the racetrack, in order to
enlist the interest of and secure tho
patronage of women, have what is
called a "ladies' day, on which occa
sion ladles have free admission; and
Whereas, The evil results engendered
by the hope of gain on racetracks are
apparent in the disruption of homes, the
dissipation of savings, recklessness as
to moral and social relations and ulti
mately to crime and ruin; and
Whereas, It is incumbent upon this
board to restrict at least the time in
which such practices may be carried on.
as a means of protection to those per
sons, young or old, who are unable to
exercise control over their dispositions
to acquire money by the hazard, excite
ment and allurements held out; there-
The people of the city and county of
San Francisco do ordain as follows:
Section 1. The selling of pools, or
bookmaking or making bets or wagers
wherein money or other articles of value
are staked or placed on races or other
contests between horses within a ra.ee
track in this city and county is hereby
restricted to and for a period of forty
eight days in any one year.
Section 2. No person or persons,
manager, proprietor or corporation
owning or controlling any racetrack
shall allow free admission or any reduc
tion of the usual fee charged for ad
mission to the said racetrack, on any
day on which pools are sold, or books
or wagerrf are made wherein money or
other articles of value are staked on
races or other contests between horses
within said racetrack or elsewhere.
Section 3. Any person violating any
of he provisions of this order shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and
upon conviction thereof shall be pun
ished by a fine of not more than $500 or
by Imprisonment of not more than six
months, or by both such fine and impris
onment.
Should the measure pass, as its sup
porters anticipate, the Ingleside man
agement will remove to Oakland, as it
is understood that the California Joc
key Club has tendered its track to the
Pacific Club. This will make contin
uous racing at Emeryville until the
season closes.

BIG PROFITS
ON A SMALL
CONTRACT
The steam - Heating Work for the New
Ferry Depot Proves to Be a
Bonanza.
Peculiar Acts That Met With the Approval of
Commissioner Colnon and Architect
Swain.
The accessible records relating to the
acts of the members of the Board of
Harbor Commissioners In connection
with the construction of the ferry build-
Ing are complete. They fail to show
the motives that actuated the Commis
sioners in ordering' changes that result
ed in much gain to the contractors and
a proportionate loss to the State.
Such as they are, however, the rec
ords establish one important fact. They
show that not one of the dozens of con
tractors were allowed to go away empty
handed when a request was made for
some change that meant the acquisi
tion of many unearned dollars by the
petitioner. Architect Swain always
recommended and Commissioner Col
non always approved. Their unity of
ideas was only equaled by the accord
with which the recipients of their favor
repeated their raids on the public
purse.
As it was with the stone, iron and
wood contracts, so it was with that
contract for installing the steam-heat
ing plant in the big building. The
Board of Harbor Commissioners and
Architect Swain have given their offi
cial sanction to numerous changes not
contemplated by the original plans and
specifications, and in every instance the
State was the loser by the operation.
As the work now stands, the building
is fitted with a steam-heating plant
â wholly inadequate to the purpose for
â¢which it was intended, ajid this in the
face of the fact that everything needed
or desired was called for by the plans
and specifications under which the con
tract was let.
When bids on the steam-heating ap
paratus were called for the general
opinion was held by members of com
peting firms that the specifications for
this work were prepared by the rep
resentative of the firm that secured the
contract. This alone was considered
to be a great advantage to that firm
in bidding.
The specifications, when prepared,
â were so written as to mislead intend
ing competitors, and were an elabor
ately worded description of the com
plete apparatus. Bidders were instruct
ed to bid on the Installing of the pip
ing pystpm, it being stated that at a
later date bids would be asked for the
work of putting in the boilers and also
for furnishing and setting the radia
tors.
It was found, when the bids were
opened, that the variation In the
prices named was considerable, they
ranging from $5200 to $9700. W. W.
Montague & Co. secured the contract
at the lower figure, which at the time
was considered by the other bidders
to be a ridiculous sum for the work
called for by the specifications. In '.his
casp, as in others, there appears to
have been a wide difference between
what was promised and what was per
formed. So striking: is this difference
thot there seems to be good grounds
for the conclusion that it is due either
to the ignorance, neglect or collusion
of those in authority.
In this instance it does not require
the services of an expert on steam
heating to detect the lack of adher
ence to the terms of the specifications.
A few of the most glaring cases will
be sufficient to show the full character
of the completed work.
The clause In the specifications relat
ing to the system of piping reads as
follows:
The system of piping will be known
as the low pressure, single pipe sys
tem, except for the ground floor, which
will be double pipe, the returns being
one size smaller than the now on the
two-pipe system. â¢ â¢ * The main
steam supply pipe will be eight inches,
from the boiler to the main building,
and there divide into two 6-lnch pipes
running right and left to main supply
branches, these mains to be reduced
proportionately as radiator risers are
taken off them. â¢ â¢ â¦ Sizes of bleed
ers and return pipes to receiving tank to
be of ample size to thoroughly and
quickly relieve flow pipes from water,
bo that the system at all times will be
thoroughly drained and freed from con
densation. â¢ â¢ â¢ Each radiator air
valve will be connected with a %-inch
drip pipe to run and empty into waste
pipe where directed.
A careful examination of
ihiÂ» work Â»howM that the **two
|>ipe" NTNifin for the entire
ground floor has been omitted,
thuM leaving: out about half of
the work contracted for.
The air pipes are consplcucua
by their absence.
The clause in the specifications re
garding the covering of pipes reads as
follows:
All pipes and fittings throughout are
to be covered with magnesia sectional

connection with this contract is shown
in the trenches made for the reception
of the return pipes. The specifications
read as follows:
Trenches are to be cut by this con*
tractor (heating contractor) in the
foundation concrete for his returnpipeÂ«,
neatly finished up with the best Port
land cement and covered with heavy
cast-iron, ribbed, covering plates, set
in flush with finished floor.
These trenches, instead of being cut
large enough to provide of the pipe
with pipe covering cm it, and graded
toward the receiving tank, have been
cut barely large enough in width to re
ceive the pipe, and of a uniform depth
just sufficient to allow for a thin cov
ering over the trenches. The ribbed
cast-iron covers have been omitted al
together.
A rough estimate of the amount saved
to the contractor by three of the omis
sions enumerated is as follows:
I'ipe covering: $1,000
Cutting; trenches 1,2ft0
Cast-iron covers 1,180
Total saving; $3,430
The above estimates are based on the
supposition that the work should have
been done according to the original
specifications as interpreted by theother
bidders. These estimates do not in
clude all of the omissions. The amount
saved by leaving out the two pipe sys
tem on the ground floor and some other
minor omissions should be added. It
would then appear that the contractor
drew out of the State treasury quite a
large sum of money for a small
amount of work.
As before stated, the Board of Har
bor Commissioners let the work on the
heating apparatus in three separate
contracts, the contract for the radi
ators and also for the boilers being let
quite recently. W. W. Montague & Co.
secured the contract for furnishing and
setting- the radiators without competi
tion for the sum of $2927.
The specifications give a list of 105
radiators, aggregating 6500 square feet.
Radiators can be purchased in the open
market In small lots for 30 cents per
square foot, while the radiator valves
would probably not average more than
$2 each. The best automatic air valves
on the market do not cost more than $1
each. These are retail prices. At these
rates the cost of doing the work would
be:
6500 square feet at 30 cents $1930
105 valves at $2 210
105 air valves at $1 105
Setting at 50 cents each 52
Painting radiators at $1 103
Total cost $2422
The contract price for doing the work
was $2927. If $2422 is accepted as the
cost of the work at retail prices, then
the contractor will make a profit of
$505, a very neat return on a contract
of $2950, when it is considered that he
has already made a retailer's profit on
the material used.
BBITISH SAILORS WIN.
Exciting Game of Football at the
Presidio â Victors Entertained.
A very interesting and exciting game
of association football was played yester
day afternoon on the Presidio grounds be
tween the soldiers and a team of sailors
from the British steamship Moana, that
arrived from Australia on the 9th inst.
The soldiers had the wind in their favor
the first half, but failed to score against
their opponents, although the ball on sev
eral occasions was near the sailors' goal.
Once or twice the soldiers' goal was
threatened, but the sailors were unable to
force the ball between the posts. After
an intermission of ten minutes both teams
lined up on the field for the second half,
the sailors having the wind in their favor.
Each team got down to steady work, and
it' was not long before Private Steele
kicked a goal for the soldiers. The game
from this time on was hotly contested on
both sides and soon after McCormlck for
the sailors kicked a goal and made a tie.
The sailor boys were not content with
this, but shortly after rushed the ball to
the soldiers' side and Sailor Williamson
added another goal to the credit of the
British seamen. The final score was 2 to
1 in favor of the sailors. Mr. Hunter,
third officer of the Moana, refereed the
game. After the game the victors were
royally entertained by the soldiers at the
canteen and post restaurant. A return
game will be played a week from next
Saturday.
Following are the names of the players:
Presidio team â Goal, Rawlins; backs,
Dimmick and Keilty; half-backs, Murray,
Brown and O'Merry; forwards, Robinson,
Steele, Smith, Ratchford, Moffitt and
Broderick.
Team from British steamer Moanaâ
Goal, McArthur; backs, McDonald and
Williamson; half-backs, Cowie, Devlin
and Weatherall; forwards, McCormick,
Campbell, Martin, Mclntosh and Gillespie.
DlmmJck, Steele and Robinson for the
soldiers and McCormick and Mclntosh
for the sailors did excellent team work.

THE SA^ FRAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
LONG OVERDUE KLONDIKERS.
The N, G, Thurston, Laden With Gold-Hunters From
the Eastern States, Is Behind Time,
MRS. N. BOWLES, ONE OF THE PARTY.
The fifteen gold hunters who arrived from New Haven, Conn., yester
day on the schooner Thomas F. Negus were much disappointed when
they learned that the schooner Nellie G. Thurston from New York, with
another party of Klondikers aboard, had not reached port before them. The
schooners were for two days at anchor together in Playa Parda cove,
Straits of Magellan, and both sailed at the same time for Fan Franciscff. The
Negus, however, put into Valparaiso, but the Thurston came straight on
and should have been here some time ago, according to F. O. Gross of the
former schooner.
The Nellie G. Thurston has nineteen men and one woman aboard. The
latter is a widow named Mrs. Nellie Bowles. She has with her a most
elaborate outfit, including a Winchester- rifle, a revolver and bowie knife,
and plenty of money. In rainy or stormy weather she dressed in oilskins
and long rubber boots and helped the men about the deck- In the cabin
she appeared dressed in the height of fashion and made everybody aboard
toe the mark. At Montevideo she stayed at the Pyramid Hotel, while the
Negus was in port, and gave a banquet to her fellow passengers. The next
day she refused to continue the Journey and declared she was going to pay
$750 to reach San Francisco by the overland route. The schooner was de
layed twenty-four hours and she finally made up her mind to come on.
They were not a very happy family during the first part of the voyage,
and Harry Waters, one of the largest stockholders in th> j venture, left thf
schooner at Montevideo with the intention of going bark to New York and
then coming to San Francisco overland. When the Thurston was in the
Straits of Magellan life aboard was very harmonious.
"I am afraid something has happened to the Nellie G. Thurston," said
F. O. Gross of the Thomas F. Negus yesterday. "She should have reach
ed San Francisco before us, as we stopped several days at Valparaiso. I
Joined the Negus at Montevideo and was in that port when the Thurston
arrived. Rhe had aboard twenty gold hunters, among whom were several
professional men and a young fellow named Miles, t';e son of a millionaire
brewer of New York, and Mrs. Bowles. The latter is a handsome woman
about 30 years of age, and must have had the gold f^ver real bad in order
to start out alone to hunt for riches. The Thurston's sleeping quarters were
in the hold, and a separate cabin was partitioned fff for the lady. Th<Â»
banquet given by her at the Pyramid Hotel was intended for a farewell
sort of affair, but she changed h^r mind and I saw her sail away with the
rest of them a few days later.
"When the Negus arrived I at once Joined her and we started after the
Thurston. At Punta Arenas, C. Adams, one of our party, left the schooner
and went by steamer to Valparaiso, where he rejoined us. He wanted a.
break in the monotony and he got it, as every day he was in Valparaiso
he was expecting the soldiers of Argentina to cross the mountains and at
tack the town. As soon as the parses through the mountains are clear of
snow I think a war between Ar o vnt;na and Chile will break out.
"We caught up with the Nellie (j. Tnurston in the Straits of Magellan
and spent two days in company in Playa Parda cove. It was a beautiful
spot and a mountain stream gave us a chance to replenish our water tanks.
Mrs. Bowles showed that she was a good shot by bringing down a deer and
supplying us all with fresh meat. The Thomas F. Negus and the Nellie G.
Thurston left Playa Parda cove In company and we passed out into the Pa
cific ahead of them. When eighty miles off shore it blew a hurricane and
we had a terrible time of it. After passing Cape Pillar we did not see the
Thurston again. I hope she gets In soon, as I have a number of very dear
friends on her."
Captain J. A. McClure Is in command of the Negus, and he and his
company are bound for Copper River. They will be joined by sixteen others
who are coming out overland, and as soon as all have arrived a start for
Alaska will be made. The schooner sailed from New Haven, Conn., on
November 3 last, and has been 136 days on the voyage. Soon after leav
ing port her water tanks burst and she had to put into the Cape Verde Is
lands to repair them. On December 20 she put Into Montevideo, and on
January 20 she was in Valparaiso. The Nellie G. Thurston is now out 159
days from New York, but as she is not as fast a boat as the Negus the
chances are that she will put in an appearance In a few days.
TOOK TIME BY
THE FORELOCK
German Democrats Have Al
ready Inaugurated the
Campaign of '98.
An Oration by Max. Popper and a
"Hit" in Singing by Miss Connell.
Delegations Present.
The German Democrats are nothing if
not on time, in politics at least. They
fired the first grun of the campaign of
'98 last evening, the occasion being that
of an inauguration, entertainment and ball
held at Turn Verein Hall, 323 Turk street.
The "ceremonies" were under the auspices
of the German Democratic Central Club,
with Max Popper, the Iroquois brave, as
chief medicine man. A fair-sized crowd
was present and cheered heartily as
shortly prior to the opening of the pro
gramme delegations from the Democratic
Central Club and the Laguna Club
marched in with banners waving and
badges conspicuously in evidence. The
hall was arrayed in holiday attire and
the stage decorated with flowers. At the
back of the stage was placed a large por
trait of William Jennings Bryan, bear
ing the insignia of the Laguna Club.
After aji overture by the orchestra Max
Popper was introduced by Dr. Thiele, the
chairman. The speaker prefaced his re
marks with the statement that it is a
characteristic of the German race to take
time by the forelock. He spoke of the
prominent part taken by German-Ameri
cans In previous campaigns, and stated
his belief that- their influence had always
been thrown on the side of good govern
"Organizatlon at this time," he said,
"is peculiarly necessary. This city need 3
to be freed from corrupt rule and boss
control, and the sooner we go to work to
do it the better."
The feature of the evening's entertain
ment which -seemed to take most with
the audience was a contralto solo by Miss
Lillian B. Connell, accompanied by her
vocai teacher. Professor J. Greven. This
young lady, who is said to be preparing
to make her debut on the stage, possesses
a voice of rare sweetness and strength,
and was encored several time. A soprano
solo b> Miss Lillie Roeder was aJso well
received, as was a duet by both the sing
ers. Other features were recitations by
He.nry Maret and Dr. Thiele, musical
oddities by A. O. Eppler, and a three
riuiiid boxing contest between Max Fen
ner and an "Unknown."
After the literary and musical features
were finished dancing began and was kept
up until a late hour. Rudolph Luders
officiated as floor manager. The commit
tee of arrangements was composed of Dr.
E. Thiele (chairman), August Uhlen
brock, Rudolph Luders, F. Canaris, Henry
Kuhn and Anton Kolligs.
WENT THE PACE THAT EHLS.
Believing That He Had Seen the
World George Curry Took
Carbolic Acid.
George M. Curry, formerly employed by
the California Casket Company, commit
ted suicide at his room, 142 Fourteenth
street, yesterday afternoon by swallowing
carbolic acid.
The following note, addressed to the
Coroner, was left by the man: "I have
went the pace that kills for the past
year, and have come to the conclusion
that there is nothing more to be seen in
this world. Please notify my mother,
who resides at 1915 Howard street, and
oblige. GEORGE M. CURRY."
The mother was notified of the death of
her son, and took possession of the note
before the arrival of Deputy Coroner
J. G. Tyrrell, but later she sent it to the
Coroner's office. It is said that there had
been trouble between the young man and
his mother and that a couple of weeks
ago she had forbidden him the house.

SEATTLE
OVERRUN
WITH CROOKS
Thieves Holding High
Carnival in the
Queen City.
Why Schwartz, the Dia
mond King, "Was Not
Brought Back.
Determined Effort of a Superior
Judge to Prevent His
Extradition.
STATEMENT OF WREN.
Loud in His Denunciation of the
Shabby Treatment Ac
corded Him.
Detective Wren, who went to Seattle
to bring back Joseph Schwartz, the
diamond king, for robbing Wolfsohn &
Levingston, jewelers, of $1250, is loud
in his denunciation of the apparent at
tempt of the Washington authorities to
prevent the clever thief from being
made to answer for his crime.
Shortly after it was announced that
the San Francisco authorities would
bring Schwartz back Gorvernor Rogers
of Washington, assisted by Superior
Judge Jacobs, it is claimed, determined
to save the prisoner the humiliation of
being tried for the offense charged
against him. On the arrival of Detec
tive Wren in Seattle he was informed
by a friend that Schwartz had consid
erable money and was using it to save
being brought back to this city. Wren
interviewed Judge Jacobs, and was told
by him that sufficient evidence had not
been produced to show that Schwartz
was guilty of the crime cMbrged.
Realizing that Jacobs Intended to
prevent the extradition of the diamond
king. Wren went to Olympia where he
consulted Governor Rogers. The lat
ter at first paid little attention to him
and in a rather abrupt manner told him
that the extradition of Schwartz de
pended solely on the evidence produced
by the police of this city. Wren tried
to explain to him that Schwartz was a
noted thief and was badly wanted for
robbing a number of jewelers. The fol
lowing day the case came up in Judge
Jacobs' court, and after Wren had
shown the papers, which were signed
by Governor Budd and the District At
torney, he informed the court that
Schwartz was a professional diamond
thief and was badly wanted in this city.
Jacobs, who seemed determined: to pre
vent the extradition of Schwartz, re
marked that the policeman had no
right to arrest him, and that if he had
been in his place he would have killed
him. He then dismissed the case
against the prisoner.
As he left the courtroom the diamond
king sarcastically remarked to the de
tective that he was "too old a bird to
be caught."
Angered at what he terms the evi
dent attempt of Jacobs to save
Schwartz being: punished for his crime.
Wren in disgust boarded the first
train for this city, arriving here last
Friday morning.
To a reporter last night Wren said:
"I knew that Schwartz would make a
desperate fight to prevent his extra
dition and I was amply prepared for
any emergency. As I was leaving the
train I was accosted by a friend who
was thoroughly familiar with the
methods of the Seattle police. He told
me that Schwartz was spending money
and that, in his opinion, he would not
be taken back. Suspecting something
wrong I made ar investigation with
the result that I found that he had
used considerable money in prevent
ing his extradition. . After I had in
terviewed Governor Rogers I became
convinced that I would not be allowed
to bring Schwartz back. I went into
Judge Jacobs' court prepared to make
sufficient showing, but at the same
time I realized that I was up against
it. After a farcical trial Jacobs at
once released Schwartz, notwithstand
ing that I produced papers for his
extradition, which were signed by Gov
ernor Budd and District Attorney
Barnes. During my stay in Seattle
I saw a number of clever thieves who
were plying their vocation apparently
without fear of detection. I was told
by a reliable authority that the town
was overrun with crooks of all descrip
tions. It is possible that the success
ful attempt to prevent the extradition
of Schwartz was due to the fact that
he liberally distributed his money in
the proper channels."
As soon as new papers are prepared
Wren will again go to Seattle in the
hope of locating his man. Schwartz,
who was indicted by the Grand Jury
last Saturday afternoon, it is be
lieved has already left Seattle, know
ing that the police of this city are de
termined to prosecute him for robbing
Wcllschn Levingston.

BRODERICK WILL
BE ENJOINED
A Friendly Suit to Head Off a
Threatened Deficiency in,
the Treasury.
Phelan Says That Somo of the County
Clerk's Appointments Are Not
Legal-
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors decided on Friday to go
to the courts to ascertain how the
threatened deficit in the city finances
can be avoided. Auditor Broderick and
Mayor Phelan were present before the
committee, each anxious to show that
he had done his share in checking reck
less expenditures. The fight turned on
the County Clerk's office, -which the
Mayor has picked out as a mark .for his
attacks. Supervisor Haskins wanted to
know whether or not the Auditor could
refuse to sign any bill that was sent to
him, and Mayor Phelan hastened to re
ply that he thought the Auditor's pow
ers extended that far.
City and County Attorney Creswell de
clined to express an opinion on the Aud
itor's powers, stating that it would be
necessary to look into the law before
expressing any opinion. Then Mayor
Phelan- turned his guns on the County
Clerk and asked the Auditor whether he
would refuse to sign demands from the
County Clerk's office so that he might be
mandamused and the merits of the mat
ter ascertained.
Auditor Broderick replied that he
would not undertake to do anything of
the kind, as he did not know so far as
the law was concerned whether there
were any illegal appointees in the Coun
ty Clerk's office, and if there were any
he had no means of ascertaining which
were outside the law. It was finally de
cided to make a test case and employ an
attorney to bring suit to enjoin the Aud
itor from signing a certain demand, and
by this means throw the whole matter
into the courts.
Fell Under a Wagon.
Michael Kearse, a teamster, residing
at 185 Harriet street, fell under the
wheels of a wagon he was driving near
the Spring Valley Water Works last
evening. The wagon was loaded with
over four tons of various articles, and
Kearse sustained a severe contusion of
the right foot, which may result In am
putation. The injured man was taken to
the City and County Hospital for treat

ON a blustering day in March,
1874, a man traveling- along the
county road in Sherwood Val
ley, Mendocino County, came to
the Strong Inn and stopped for
refreshments. The man was
acquainted with the place and
he recognized instantly that something
was wrong. He pushed open the door
and found everything in disorder.
There were signs that Mrs. Strong had
been preparing to retire for the night,
but nowhere could bo found any
trace of Mrs. Strong herself. The
watch dog, too, vac X' i very
thing about the plac-t- betokened that
some crime had been committed.
"1 HAD HARDLY PASSED THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE WHEN THE SHARP CLICK! CLICK! OF A WINCHESTER AND THE ORDER,
'HANDS UP!' BROUGHT ME TO A STANDSTILL."
On the traveler reporting these things
to the nearest village the citizens gath
ered at the Strong ranch and a. thor
ough search was made to discover
some clew that would throw light on
the matter. It was known that very
bitter feeling existed between Mrs.
Strong and her rich neighbors, Geiger
and Alexander, because Mrs. Strong
would not sell them her land. Several
of the mounted men left to question
and watch Geiger and Alexander,
while the rest of the party continued
the search for the missing Mrs. Strong.
For several days the search was con
tinued without any direct result. Pub
lic excitement grew the while and the
suspicion against Geiger and Alex
ander grew stronger. ; An armed com
mittee was appointed by. the citizens
to watch them and prevent them leav

Yosemite Valley After a Disappearance of 25 Years.
JUST twenty-five years ago this month a lone woman was murdered in
Mendocino County by a rich rancher. The crime was the outcome of a
land fight. D. H. Geiger was suspected of having killed her. He was
in danger of being lynched when the law officers smuggled him into the
j iil of another county. In due time he was tried and sentenced to life
in S n Quentin.
At the time he boasted that he was "worth a million" and would never
suffer punishment.
On the evening of the day on which the Supreme Court .ffirmeJ the
judgment Geiger succeeded in gettinz out of jail, and on the outskirts of the
town ne dropped out of the world's sight Search as they might the offkers
were never able to find a single trace of him. A price was set upon his head
and for twenty-five years that was the end of Geiger.
Now comes the strangest Dart of the strange story.
ently saw the body of a horse. The
horse, like the dog, had been shot to
h. The mysterious trail the track
er was following ended beside the dead
horse.
The Indian knew now that the wil
derness was about to disclose themys
tery connected with the (load dog, the
dead horse and to reveal the strange
purpose that had led unknown per
sons into this wild and brush-covered
spot among the mountains.
Through a near-by canyon flowed a
creek. Instinct led the Indian to
scrutinize the banks of the creek. A
little way off he saw a pile of stones
close to the edge of the creek, lie
went forward wondering more and
more, and stood beside the stones.
At once he perceived that the stones
had been piled there only a little while
before-. It was evident that unknown
persons) had buried something under
neath those stones.
T!n> Indian looked about him and
thought a bit.
As his gaze moved over the scene
his eye was caught by some object
moving In the icy stream, something
white that moved constantly up and
down, up and down, where the stream
brawled its loudest over its stony
bed.
Several of the stones had fallen from
about the pile, and that white some
thing had been laid bare by the run
ning stream.
The Indian stepped nearer, and,
bending down, saw a human foot en
tirely naked and a human ankle. The
water gave the foot constant motion;

as if the dead person who slept under
the stones were struggling vainly and
impotently to get away from this hor
rible cairn.
The foot was that of a woman.
The Indian, trembling with his hor
rible discovery, ran back to Sherwood
Valley and told what he had seen. A
posse of armed men quickly organ
ized and followed the Indian back to
the secret grave. They reached the
cairn, uncovered the body and found
all that remained of Catherine Strong.
The discovery of the body started
anew the threads of vengeance and
lynch law, and when the names of D.
H. Geiger and James Alexander were
used strong oaths followed. Several
of the most headstrong broke away
from the group and spurred back to
Sherwood Valley, carrying the story
that Catherine Strong had been taken
from her bed at night and foully shot
to death.
The regular officers of the law real
ized it was time for quick action.
Geiger and Alexander were arrested
at once and lodged In jail, where the
mob could not get at them so readily.
* Â» *
Geiger and Alexander were partners
In the sheep and cattle business. The
Strongs occupied a quarter section of
land, which cut into one of the Geiger
and Alexander sheep ranges. The sheep
ran upon the land of the Strongs and
the Strong dog, in driving them off,
bit some of the sheep. There were the
usual quarrels.
Geiger and Alexander did their best
to get the Strongs to sell their land,
Several months ago E. M. Bailey, a Berkeley resident, was camping
in the Sierras on the Yosemite reservation. He had known Geiger in the
old days. One day Bailey was out looking for the horses and ran across
a queer looking cave. Filled with curbsitv he started to explore it, but
he had no sooner passed the entrance than the sharp dick! click! of a
Winchester brought him to a halt.
"Hulloa, Geiger," said Bailey, and the two men fell to talking of old
times.
That is the first time that Geiger has been recognized in the last
twenty-five years, though he claims to have visited San Francisco and the
surrounding towns very frequently in that time.
Bailey left Geiger in the secret cave in the Sierras and soon afterward
returned home.
but they steadfastly refused. During
this warfare Strong was accused of
killing some of the Geiger and Alex
ander stock, and was sent to jail. After
this, as was testified later on, Geiger
told H. T. Hatch that strong would
never be able to get the new trial he

was seeking. "Mrs. Strong," added
Geiger with a show of bitter feeling,
"uu.i;lit to be where Strong is!"
With her husband in jail Mrs. Strong
was left alone to fight her own battle
against her wealthy and powerful
neighbors. She kept a little inn, at
which there were occasional guests, as
the house was on the main road. There
was no question that she was brave
and obstinate. She flung back just
as taunting remarks as were made by
Geiger and Alexander.
As the time for Strong's release and
return home drew nearer the Jeud be
came more bitter.
"I do not think that it would be any
more harm to kill her," said Alexan-
der to W. T. Blair, alluding to Mrs.
Strong, "than it would be ,to kill a
dog!" Â«
This remark was remembered when
Mrs. Strong's body was % discovered:
burled under the stones far from her
home.
Had not Deputy Sheriff Joe Stanley,
â¢who served, the warrants on Geigor
and Alexander, played a sharp trick
there undoubtedly would have been a
lynching. With his prisoners he elud
ed the pursuing parties and landed
them In jail. The two prisoners deemdÃ
their refuge so dangerous that they
urged their lawyers to use every effort
to have them transferred to the So
noma County Jail.
It is a part of the interesting history
of the case that Constable Hughes, now
living in Ukiah, had received from
Mrs. Strong some time before the mur
der a letter asking protection from
both Geiger and Alexander.
Barclay Henley was employed by
the Supervisors nf Mendocino County
to specially prosecute the defendants.
Geiger, after his arrest, made the
boast, "I have a million dollars back of
me, I'm all right."
He was the only one convicted. He
was defended by a great combination
of legal talentâ Judge Terry. W. W.
Pendergast, Judge Lamar and Judge
MeGarvey. Their united ability could
not save him.
Alexander, his partner, was acquitted.
Geiger was found guilty of murder in
the first degree and was sentenced to
imprisonment during his natural life.
The trial took place at Santa Rosa.
An appeal from the decision was
promptly made to the Supreme Court.
In May, ISTS, the judgment was af
firmed.
True to his boast, the judgment did
not hold Geiger. The decision of the
cour^: was made in Sacramento about
4 o'clock by Mr. Justice Crockett. At
7 o'clock Geiger had his affairs and
plans so arranged that he walked out
the Santa Rosa jail without opposition.
So cleverly was the plan handled that
no one suspected his escape till T. B.
Reese, ex-County Clerk of Modoc, then
a law student, reported to the author
ities that he had just seen Geiger on
the outskirts of town. He was the last
man who saw the condemned mur
derer.
That was In May, ISTo, and from tha%)
day, although the officers of the law
have hunted high and low for Geiger,
nothing has been seen of him till last
September, when K. M. Bailey, who
was an officer of the court during the
trial, ran plump into him in a dark
cave in Fresno County.
Mr. Bailey lives in Berkeley. He was
a boy and resided in Mendocino County
at the time Mrs. Strong was murdered.
He frequently saw Geiger and Alex
ander and knew then very well. Mr.
Bailey is the man who has furnished the
facts for the second chapter in Geiger's
remarkable historyâ that part that
followed the time when he disappeared
as completely as though swept from
the surface of the earth.
Bailey says that Geiger is living with
another escaped convict in a nicely
fitted up mountain cave, that they have
excellent provisions and clothes, to
gether with books, guns and everything
their tastes in luxuries call for; that
Gelger not only visits San Francisco
sometimes, but that he was in the office
of Captain Lees when the latter was
chief of the detective department.
"On the 17th of last September." said
Mr. Bailey, in relating the remarkable
meeting he had with Geiger, "I was
alone in camp at Registration Flat, in
the Yosemite Reservation. An old man,
gray but robust, came down to where
I was sitting before the campflre. Some
thing about him seemed familiar. I
have a good memory for faces and
gradually my memory worked back
through the past till finally I had him â
it was Gelger â but T kept my conclu
Â»ion to myself. I looked at him until
I was positive of my identification.
Then I began to wonder what had
brought the old man to that spot.
"He remained about the camp some
time, but went away before the other
men in our party returned.
"I had noticed that he had a com
rade. This second man tried his best
to watch us and to remain out of sight
behind the trunk of a fallen tree some
distance from the camp. Evident!-/ he
thought that I had not caught a

"A few days after this visit our
party crossed the river and went into

them. I took my bearings from a high
peak some distance from the camp. I
had gone some distance through a
canyon, the walls of' which were of

REMARKABLE "GRAFFITO" OF THE CRUCIFIXION JUST DISCOVERED.
Said to Be the Work, of a
Roman Soldier Who Was
on Calvary at the Time.
PROFESSOR ORAZIO MARUCCHI, who for ten years past has
made a special study of the "graffito," has just discovered a
wonderful picture of this style of drawing in the Palace of
Tiberius, on the Palatine Hill, In Rome.
The subject of the picture is the "Crucifixion," and Profes-
Bor Marucehi. after carefully weighing all the details connected with
the picture, is of the linn belief that it was drawn by a person who wit
nessed the scene.
There are three crosses. When the "graffito" was first discovered
the central cross could hardly be discerned, but by careful treatment
of tÂ»e walls it has been brought out much stronger, as has the figure
of Christ with the word "Crestus" abovfe Â»t-
The inscription is in Latin, and when translated reads: Christ,
having' been beaten with rods, was hanged upon the cross according
to the secret customs."
* OT since the discovery of the
tit "I, (! gia" containing some unpub-
J\J I&hed sayings of Christ has any-
I \ thing been found which compares
in Interest to the student of
I Christian archaeology with the
illeged discovery In the Palace of
Tiberius, on the Palatine Hill, in Rome,
of a "graffito'; representing the Cruci
fixion, which occurred during the reign
of Tiberius.
A "graffito, " it may be said, is a pic
ture or Inscription scratched on the
wall. Making graffiti was a habit to
which the Romans were very much ad
dicted, and owing to it we have been
fortunate in obtaining much informa
tion which we could not have obtained
in any other way.
A distinguished archaeologist, Profes
sor Orazicr Marucehi, the director of
the Egyptian Museum off the Vatican,
has devoted himself for many years to
the study of epigraphy, and now he has
brought himself into great prominence
owing t>> his discovery of the graffito
referred to.
The picture is scratched on the level
of the ground close by the angle of one
of the passages which lie under the
structures adjoining the bridge of Cali
gula, in the immediate neighborhood of
the Clivus Victoriae. The building is
really a gallery made by Caligula to
connect the palace with the Forum.
One reason that even the archaeolo
gist has great difficulty in making out
the topography of the Palatine is that
it is covered with a vast series of sub
structures which supported the palaces
and which afforded rooms and passage
ways for the servants, slaves, and es
pecially the soldiers. At any moment
a large force of soldiers could be con
centrated at any point of danger. It is
conjectured that the graffito is the work
of a Christian slave or soldier who had
witnessed the crucifixion.
It is not surprising that the soldiers
for diversion used to scratch lines and
drawings on the rough plaster of the
wall. The "graffito" of the crucifixion
Is very crude, as is so often the case in
sketches uf this kind.
It is believed that the picture was
drawn by a soldier who took a more or
less active part in the crucifixion of
Mount Calvary.
The figures are about fifteen centi
meters high. At the right and left are
crosses, and soldiers mount ladders
placed against them. Each person in
the great tragedy is duly inscribed
with his name, and "Filetus" was un
doubtedly intended for Pontius Pilate.
The inscription of twelve or fifteen
lines begins with the word "Crestus,"
which is already known as a rough
form of the name of Christ. There is

MADE PUBLIC.
considerable doubt as to the meaning
of the rest of the inscription.
* M. Marucehi deciphers part of *
* it: "Crestus, virgis caesus de- *
* cretus mori, super palum vivus *
* fixus est," which is to say: *
* "Christ, after having been *
* beaten with rods, having been *
* condemned to die, has been at- *
* tached living to the cross." *
Various interpretations have been
made of other parts of it, some of the
lines being love verses. It was, how
ever, customary to add to or subtract
from such inscriptions; so this objec
tion of archaeologists does not militate
against the theory that the picture
really represents the Crucifixion.
Some contend that Professor Mar
ucehi is mistaken, and that the scene
represents a ropewalk, but what ob
ject would Roman soldiers have in por
traying a ropewalk, and how does this
do away with "Crestus" and Filetus?
M. Marucchi makes a great point in
showing that behind the central figure
there seems to have been a
third cross, for it is still pos
sible to distinguish a third ladder
running up the same height as the
others and also a third rope hanging
downward like the rest. Other profes
sors say that the "graffito" represents
the preparations for a battle. All
doubts will probably be set at rest
when Professor Marucchi publishes a
pamphlet upon " the subject. This
pamphlet is in preparation.
This is the second "graffito" of great
note that Professor Marucchi claims to
have discovered in the ten years he has
been studying the "graffiti" in the pal
ace of Tiberius. The other "graffito"
was also a picture of the Crucifixion,
in which Christ appeared with an ani
mal's ears on his head. After long and
hard study Professor Marucchi came to
the conclusion that the picture of
Christ was originally drawn by a
Christian soldier and that afterward,
in a spirit of ridicule, some pagan had
attached the drawing of the ears of an
animal to the figure's head. The in
scription under the figure had appa
rently likewise been altered in a spirit
of derision.
A copy of the new "graffito" has been
made by Professor Marucchi and pre
sented to the Pope.
The "graffito" is carefully protected
by a grating, and it is probable that
the study of it may bring some new
details to light, but at the present time
the evidence points to its being an early
representation of the Crucifixion.

STRANGE EXPERIMENTS WITH OUR NERVES.
IT may preatly surprise many per
sons to learn of the fact that
everybody has a blind spot in each
eye. Not only this, but every
person has a great number of
blank or nerveless spots on the
skin in which there is little or no feel
ing or sensation. These facts have
been developed by certain experiments
carried on in Cornell University.
The experimenting professors say
that when you look at a great paint
ing or a play, or a newspaper, or any
thing that comes within the limits of
ordinary vision, you do not see it all
at once. There is a point directly op
posite your individual blind spot which
is invisible to you. It is so in the
best of eyes. The lower animals are
in the same condition.
As to the blank spots on the skin
the professors say that you could be
touched with a hot iron on one of these
places and not feel any pain. Stran
ger still, these spots are scattered all
over the body. They are small in
size, but they are to be found on the
hands, arms, face, chest, legs and feet,
and, in fact, everywhere on the hu
man frame. In order to find them out
and if possible make a map of a man's
blank skin spots, the professors in
Cornell applied scalding water to the
subject's skin. In places the warm
water was too painful to be borne; in
others, it could not be felt at all.
Blind spots are caused by the optic
nerve itself. That which gives to the
eyeball its most vital principle at this
particular point detracts from it.
After all, we really see with the brain.
The eye is merely a camera in which
what we look at is photographed on
the retina, or sensitive plate, at the
back. Now, the optic nerve enters
through the retina, and its very en
trance causes a break in the smooth,
reflecting surface of the retina. It is
of a stringy nature, but the so-oalled
string is by no means round. There
fore it enters the retina by way of
what would be an irregularly shaped
hole. This is the blind spot. The
nerve interferes with perfect sight to
the extent of an irregularly shaped spot
in the retina. This spot, when en
larged through the very natural pro
cess of looking at a white wall a few
feet away, appears, when outlined in
black, very much like a splotch of
ink about as large as a quarter of a
dollar. The shape of the blind spot in
different persons varies, just as does
the size of their heads.
In the laboratory of psychology in
Cornell College there is a map of the
blind spot of the eyes of Professor
Tichenor. It was procured In a very
curious yet very simple manner. On a
blank sheet of paper several feet
square there were drawn eighty mer
idians or lines, extending In a vertical
curve from top to bottom. The sheet
of paper represented an enlarged dia
gram of the retina of the eye. The
subject whose blind spot was to be
found was asked to look straight at
the paper on the wall. A round piece
of black paper one inch in diame*ter
was now produced and was moved
very slowly up and down the merid
ians or curved lines on the wall. By
moving up one line and down the next
and thus going from line to line the
spot of black was sure in the end to
have passed every part of the design
on the wall. While it was being
moved along one of the lines the pro
fessor suddenly cried out:
"Oh, I cannot see it now!"
Then as it proceeded a little further
on he said: "There, now I see it
again!"
Blank or dead spots in the skin are
not so hard to find. They exist all
over the body. When you touch any
thing, or when some hot substance
comes in contact with the skin, you
instantly feel it, because its bulk, in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred,
covers not only many dead spots
on the skin but equally as many sen
sitive spots. You are in the habit of
supposing that every part of the skin
is susceptible to pain induced by heat
or cold, and therefore you imagine
that every portion of the part touched
is in pain. But if heat or cold can be
conveyed to the skin through some
delicate point of contact it will be
found that in the aggregate some very
extended patches of skin are verita
bly dead.
In Cornell College there is a dia
gram of an ordinary man's thigh, on
which are shown spaces which are in
sensible to heat, cold or pain. In some
places there are almost no sensations
of temperature. Against these places
you might almost lay a hot iron, and
it wcmld have but little effect. You
might prick other spots with a sharp
needle, and, unless you penetrated too
deeply, it would not be felt. Some of
the instruments are sharply pointed af
fairs, heated with boiling water. They
travel forward and backward over the
skin, touching every minute part of it
in succession, and reproducing, by
means of a pantagraph-like instrument,
as the sensations of the subject indi
cate, a complete diagram of the dead
spaces on his skin.
In line with these experiments on
dead spaces one of the biggest things
Cornell has done has been to prove that
â¢we have not, after all, a varied sense
of touch. That is, if any part of the
body is touched we do not became
aware of it by any sense of acute feel
ing in that part, but by the mental
picture of the proceeding which we in
stantly form. In other words, the sense
of touch in normal persons is entirely
I dominated by Fight. Suppose you are I
â¢ tc-uched while in the dark; how do you j
' know where you are touched? Cornell j
professors assert, and say they have :
proved, that in the majority of cases j
it is from the picture coming in the
mind, and not by the touch at all. Aft
er all, we have a better idea of the
appearance of our bodies than we, per
haps, credit ourselves with having. If I
yc-u had not a very accurate sense of j
the appearance of your body, it is a j
question whether or not you would j
know exactly where any part of it is
touched on occasion. The sense of
touch is evanescent at best, and un
less you formed a mental picture at
once you would not be able to locate
the sensation two minutes afterward.
The point can easily be proved by
blindfolding the eyes and touching the
hand with the end of an ordinary pen
holder. Having done so, try to find the
place where you were touched wfthout
looking at it. It will be f-^und almost
impossible to do it, and the hand being
only a few inches wide, even the frac
tion of an inch difference in locating
the correct spot would count much in
favor of the theory. In a blind man the
state of affairs is still more compli
cated. If stricken with blindness he
would have a memory picture of the
appearance of his body, but if born
blind he could not have any visual
map; therefore we may have the cu
rious operation of the building up of
a touch picture. The blind man, by va
rious means aside from sight, has pre
conceived ideas of the general shapes
and appearances of his head, arms,
legs, thorax, abdomen and other parts
of his body. Hence when he is touched
this introspective picture immediately
looms up in his mind, and he knows
that it is his knee, foot, hand or other
part of his body which has been
touched.
In one of the big dark rooms in Cor
nell there is a curious piece of appa
ratus used in connection with these ex
periments in touch. It is a chair, the
back, seat and footrest of which can be
straightened out so as to form a reclin
ing chair, or when perefectly flat a
table. It is operated on a pivot so that
the whole affair can be spun like a top.
The man to be experimented upon is
asked to sit in it. Then the gas is
turned off and the walls of the room
are so constructed that not one ray of
light can reveal his surroundings.
Without acquainting him with the fact
that any change is to be made the
chair is moved into various positions.
He is made to sit, to recline and to lie
down successively, and as the changes
are made he is asked to st *c precisely
the position of his body. The mistakes
which some of the subjects have made
have proved conclusively that when in
total darkness we have very different
sensations from what we have when in
the light of day.
Strange things are done with this
chair in this dark room. Men are
placed In it and are whirled around
until they are dizzy. Then, when they
least expect it, platinum wires heated
to brilliant whiteness are made to
glow by means of an electric current.
The subject is required quickly to
point cut the spot at which the wire is
glowing. But this, strange to say, is
not always possible after the whirling
of the chair.

cents â to go to war with the United
States, and fifteen hundred million pe
setas to maintain the war six months.
No one can predict the cost with more
than approximate accuracy. No' closer
guess, very likely, can be made than
the foregoing.
General Hawley, declining to express
an opinion, nevertheless mentioned the
i experience which the last war gave in
the measure of cost of war, and many
other military authorities base their
ideas on the practical experience which
that conflict afforded to our own peo
ple. It was a lesson not only in the
assembling of men and supplies, but m
the best methods to be followed in rais
ing great sums of money for emergen
cies.
When President Lincoln called on
Congress for 400.000 men. he also asked
for $400.000 ; 000. This was at the rate
.if $1000 for every man called into serv
ice. His message to Congress stated
that the sum asked was "less than one
tweaty-third part of the money yaiue
owned by men who seemed ready to de
vote their whole." This gives another
ntage â one-twenty-third â as a ba-
I calculating what amount of ths;
m of a country should be sum
. to aid in its defense.
Secretary Chase, then at the head of
the Treasury, estimated $320,000,000 as
the sum required to begin/the war. This
proved to be .short of the requirements.
The army appropriation bill passed by
the extra session of Congress after the
firing on Suniter carried $207,000,000. The
navy appropriation bill carried $56,000,
000. These estimates and appropriations
were made, it must be remembered,
with no conception of what the wax
was to be, and with an idea that at
most it would close within six months.
The first estimates of war are usually
under rather than over what the cost
proves to be.
In a war with Spain the conflict
would be essentially different from that
I between the North and South, in that
Spain and the UnitedfStates would be
fighting across an ocean instead of
hand to hand in one country.
This would make it essentially a na
val warfare au.i a war on commerce,
and to that extent the elements of cost
would be different from land warfare.
But with both countries having long
lines of coast to protect, with Cuba as
fellows that eat up from $200 to $700 worth every shot.
One broadsid > from the battleship Oregon, with ev
ery gun belching fire and shell, would cost at least
$10,000.
That would simply pay for the ammunition used
for the moment. Figure on the destruction of prop
erty made by such a broadside, and the figures run up
mere rapidly.
A battle between these two giants of the sea would
quickly destroy at least $5,000,000 worth of property.
All this in one hour. p]ach ship cost the same. The
destruction of either would mean a loss of $3,670,000.
It is probable that the other would be damaged half
its value, or $1,835,000. Thc-se two incidents of a naval
a field of land conflict, the element of
providing for the cost of land warfare
would be hardly less than that of the
marine struggle. Prudence would also
dictate that the scale of preparation
would take into account the possibility,
even probability, of Spain's forming al
liances with European powers by which
her fighting strength on land and sea
would be largely augmented.
With these considerations existing,
the cost of going to war with Spain at
this time could not be estimated far be
low the cost when the first crash of
arms came in 1861.
As to Spain's first cost in going to war
with the United States, it must be
borne in mind that Spain is now prac
tically on a war footing, and has been
since the Cuban struggle became seri
ous. The war footing of Spain is 183,
972 men, and this footing has been
reached, if not exceeded, in Cuba alone.
The forces there have fluctuated, but
the official figures a year ago gave 121,
136 men In Cuba. Adding the reserve
force in Spain and those in the Philip
pines and Puerto Rico, the total is
fully up to the war footing of Spain.
The same is true of Spain's navy,
which is and has been on a war foot
ing. Doubtless a war footing of Spain
capable of dealing with Cuba would
have to be very materially enlarged in
dealing with the United States, but at
least it would serve as a nucleus â it
would save that extraordinary cost of
a first start. Up to this time, how
ever, Spain has known no need of a
war footing beyond that above given,
which, in detail, is as follows:
Infantry 133,000 1 Staff 11,140
Cavalry 17,1661 Hospital Corps. 453
Artillery Il'.io;
Engineers 11,027 j Total 183,972
While this is the war footing of
Spain, yet provision has been made by
which, in an extraordinary emergency,
1.083,575 men could be put in the field.
This vast number, in a country having
but 17,000,000 population, is phenom
enal in the annals of warfare. It is not
conjectural, however, but is based on
careful estimates made by Spain as to
her utmost resources in case of need.
Spain's first cost of war with the
United States has been estimated at
1,000,000,000 pesetas. The basis for the
estimate- is the cost of the Cuban con
flict to the present time. The war
budget for 1895-96 was 140.000,000 pese
tas regular and 40,000,000 pesetas extra
ordinary. This has been mounting up
ever since, until the cost of the war up
to this time is estimated at 5280.000,000,
or $85,000,000 a year. "With the increases
requisite for a conflict with the United
States, the cost would be more than
double that of holding Cuba, and, by a
most conservative estimate, the total
of 1,000,000,000 pesetas, or $200,000,000,
was made by one well fitted for an in
telligent view of the subject.
During the first stage of war a large
element of cost to be defrayed by the
United States would be found in the
necessity to provide 200,000 men with
new rifles, at a cost of $17 to $20. In
round figures this item is $4,000,000. An
other detail in reaching the total esti
mate for six months was the cost of
uniforms, two suits at $8 each being al
lowed. This, for 200,000 men, would be
about $3,500,000. In the item of ammu
nition, the estimate contemplated 500

rounds for each man in six months.
Five dollars would about cover the
cost of 500 rounds, which, for 200,000
men, would be about $1,000,000.
With the modern use of machine
guns every company of infantry would
doubtless have a gun of this character.
They cost about $1000 each, making an
other item of about $2,000,000. These
details of equipment are almost infi
nite, and with a force of 200,000 the
cost in every instance runs into the
millions. Aside from the first cost
there is the cost of transporting vast
Bupplies of food and clothing after
they have been purchased.
There are few war vessels which
could be purchased. The first cost of
such vessels cannot be placed in an
estimate. Bat it is clear that this lack
of purchasable ships would keep down
the possible first cost for Spain and
for the United States alike. Both coun
tries must fight with such vessels as
they possess, augmenting their navies
by the use of their merchant marine.
The arming of merchant ships would
be a costly operation, for they would
be drawn from their regular service,
and the Government would have to pay
liberally for their use. At such times
"war profits" are expected and exact
ed, and there would be no recourse
from it. And aside from the first cost
to the Government of taking these
merchant ships from the coasting
trade, the trans-Atlantic, the trans
pacific, the West Tndian and the South
American trade, there would be the
second cost of mounting guns and giv
ing them such armament as would fit
them for war service.
The financing of the Civil War was a
stupendous operation, as may be
judged from the fact that to-day the
Government is slowly paying off the
bonds floated at that time, and is main
taining an issue of $346,000,000 green
backs issued on the faith of the Gov
ernment to tide over the demand for
funds.
ALWAYS DflfiQEÃ
ON_VARSHIPS.
THE recent disaster to the United
States battle-ship Maine, wheth
er by accident or design, has set
the naval officers and men to
â "talking of the dangers on war
ships, even in times of peace.
There are any number of instances
averted by quick thinking and acting
and in times of peace such a deed is
one of the ways of winning promotion.
Danger lurks everywhere on a mod
ern ship of war and very often the
most careful naval officer or seaman
finds himself on the very brink of a
disaster and only by quick thinking and
lightning action on the r>art of some
one is the danger removed and an ac
cident averted that would land the*
sailor and many of his shipmates. If
not his whole ship's company, in the
next world.
Every time a torpedo-boat goes out,
even for practice, every man on board
battle would mean a total destruction of $5,505,000.
In one hour each of the big suns would be dis
charged about twenty times. That Is the average num
ber. Each time the aixtcen big rifles of the Oregon
were discharged it would cost the Government $12,000.
In the course of sixty minutes they would belch forth
$2,0,000 worth of shc-t and shell. Fo tr of her guns cost
$000 each every time they are discharged; four of them
$1000 each; eight of them $700 each.
Besides these she carries two Gatling guns. Their
capacity is 1200 shots a minute. To operate each gun
$300 worth of cartridges must br> provided every min
ute. It is not probable that they would be fired for
more than fifteen minutes, but even that brief time
takes his life in his hands, and on all
the battle-ships and cruisers the maga
zine with its store of explosives is < ver
a source of danger. There are any
number of warrant officers in the
United States navy who to-day owe
their uniform, stars and bars to rapid
judgment and bravery in the face of
such impending danger.
The peculiar construction of the tor
pedo-boat prevents much of the ma
chinery from being covered and out of
danger. Below decks everything moves
with lightning like celerity. Poke your
finger at a wheel or ornament that
seems to be stationary, and you will
be minus a finger, possibly a hand. For
the innocent looking ornament will
probably prove to be a wheel, revolv
ing so rapidly as to be apparently with
out motion. Safety is sacrificed Cor
the sake of saving space, for the tor
pedo-boat must be as compact as pos
sible. The great danger is when the
boat is submerged, for the most trif
ling accident may result disastrously to
every one on board. It is less than
six months ago that while a boat was
submerged a commonplace, ordinary
every-day stop cock became disar
ranged, and before the boat could be
brought to the surface, or this slight
accident repaired, six men were scalded
to death from the escaping steam.
One of the first of the steel ships of
the new navy had not been in commis
sion three months when the level head
edness of an apprentice boy saved her
from an accident that might have been
quite as disastrous to the big ship as
the recent one to the Maine. The aft
magazine was being repaired and the
gun division of the crew were engaged
in taking out fixed ammunition, cans
of powder and eruncotton and cleaning
and red lining the bilges. This was at
a time before the ship had been
equipped with electricity, and the men
used closed lanterns to illuminate the
m&gazine. Of course the lanterns had
been carefully inspected by an officer
before the hatch of the magazine was
lifted, and all wore apparently in good
order. The chief gunner's mate, under
the direction of a division officer, was
superintending the movements of the
men.
Something wont wrong, and in his
excitement he leaned over the hatch,
calling out orders to the men in the pit
of the magazine. In his excitement he
carelessly knocked the lantern he car
ried against the side of the hatch. The
spring that held the lamp within the
lantern gave way and it fell lighted
into the magazine and struck on the
top 1 of a big can of powder that was
hooked and ready to be hoisted to the
deck.
Fortunately the. lamp struck full on
its bottom and remained in that posi
tion. The two men in the pit had gone
away aft. for another can of po.wder,
and their backs being turned they did
not see the lighted lamp. The men
at the top of the hatch were horror
stricken, but the alert apprentice boy
was wide awake and enual to the emer
gency. He shinned down the tackle
and was not slow in the going, either.
He grabbed the lamp, the flame of
which had already begun to heat the
can metal, and shouted up the hatch,
"Pull me and the can up to the main
deck, you fellows."
He extinguished the lamp with his
would mean an expense of $4500 for each gun, or $DOOO
for both.
That would bring the total expense of an hour's en
gagement up to $249,000, or $4150 a minute, c-r a little
more than $69 a second.
To operate the Pelayo would cost a trifle of 130,00-0
less than this total. She carries seventeen big guns.
A single discharge of all of them would cost $10,050.
One Of her guns costs $650 to shoo-t; twelve of them
$500 each; two of them $800 each; two of them $&Q0
each. Upsides these she carries four Gatling guns
with the same capacity of those of the Indiana, and
operated at the same cost. To fire them fifteen min
utes would cost $18,000.
finders and grabbed the rope with his
right hand, and the can of powder
with his left, and the men at the hatch
opening had him on the main deck in
a jiffy. The can of powder was smok
ing hot where the lamp had rested. The
apprentice boy still clung to tlv heated
can and scooting up the poop ladder
With it threw it overboard. He after
ward got his sword for his bravery on
that day.
( >ne of the chief sources of danger
on all battle-ships and cruisers as well
is that of spontaneous combustion in
the coal bunkers. In all men-of-war
the coal bunkers are provided
with an automatic apparatus that gives
the alarm when the temperature of the
hunker arises above a certain figure.
The bunkers are all numbered and the
apparatus in each acts independently
and if the temperature of bunker No.
1, for instance, rises beyond the set
mark the alarm is given by the means
of a ringing registering machine placed
just outside the skipper's cabin.
There is always a marine orderly for
the commanding officer, and he is sta
tioned just outside the cabin door and
it is part of his business to keep his
eye on the fire alarm. The marine or
derly at once informs the commanding
officer that there is something wrong
in one of the bunkers. Then the ship's
bugler sounds fire quarters, and all
hands take their position in the fire
stations. Steam is turned into the
bunker reported to be on fire and the
fire thus put out. The coal bunkers
must necessarily be located in close
proximity to the boiler, and it is sur
prising what a predilection coal has
for taking fire when subject to heat
and not exposed to a current of fresh
cooling air. There is hardly a man
of-war that has not had at least a
dozen or more cases of fire in the bunk
ers, but it is only in one or two in
stances that these little affairs are ever
heard of 4n print.
As the coal bunkers are dark as
midnight tha? must be lighted in or
der that the coal passers may see to
get out the coal. On all the modern
ships of war each bunker is provided
with a couple of standing electric
lights, but in coaling the ships and
when on rough voyages the glass cas
ings around these lights are often
smashed, and then the coal passers must
use lanterns, in the use of which they
become careless.
A few years ago a fire alarm on one
of the big cruisers off a Pacific sta
tion gave the signal that there was a
fire, in bunker No. 8. As the chief en
gineer had not yet given orders for
the opening of this bunker he at once
concluded that it was a case of spon
ta:ieous N combustion. Within a minute
the firemen were playing streams of
water into the bunker, where the
arose a yell: **What the bloomin' devil
are youse flat-foot paint scrubb^s
a-trying to do â drown me and choke
me to death, ye blasted ?" And the
rest was simply a torrent of jolly Roger
talk.
The voice came from a coal passer
who, without the authority of the
chief engineer, had opened No. 8, be
cause it was handy to the fireroom. He
had taken an open light into the bun
ker and set it down on a lump of coal
directly underneath the fire-alarm ap
paratus. In a few minutes the ap
paratus was heated sufficiently to make

The total cost of the engagement to the Pelayo
would be $219,000â an average of $3650 a minute, or $60
a second, with a few pennies to spare.
Therefore, supposing that one ship would be wholly
wrecked and the other badly disabled, the total cost of
this one battle between our Government and that of
Spain, counting 3K8.000 worth of ammunition, would
be dangerously near ?6,000,000.
If the Oregon were destroyed the fight would cost
the United States $3,919,000. If she were only disabled
we would escape with a loss of $2,084,000.
The destruction of the Pelayo would mean a loss to
Spain of $3,889,000. If she were only disabled the ex
pense to the Spaniards would be $2,054,000.
its automatic report on deck. For the
next ten days that coal passer spent
his time thinking over the affairs of
this life while in the brig in double
Irons.
Scarcely a week passes in which
some man or another on a man
of-war does not get more or less seri
ously hurt. There are open hatches
for him to step into, all sorts of obsta
cles to tumble over, and he has unlim
ited opportunities to smash his toes or
fingers in mechanical appliances. There
are live electric wires for him to handle
and a thousand and one other lurking
dangers of which the merchantman .
sailor never knows or dreams. On
the cruisers that carry sail fc-r steady
ing purposes' 1"Â»<? may be slapped on the
side of the head by a loose snapping
halyard or he may, and often doss, take
a bad tumble to the deck below from a
suddenly slacking ridge rope..' Down in
the fire room among the "black gang,"
as they are known, a fireman is always
thoughtlessly picking up an almc-st red
hoi slice bar or devils claws at the
wrong end, or he carelessly handles a
valve and gets a jet of hot steam in
his eyes, and again he is forever finding
all sorts of hidden objects carelessly
left in his way for him to stumble over
in the darkness.
One of the narrowest escapes from a
magazine explosion occurred only re
cently en one of the big cruisers at
tached to the Atlantic Station." One of
the men of the "black gang" was clean
ing his section of the- after engine room*
bilges one morning. His particular
section of the bilges was adjacent to
the ship's magazine, which was
separated from the engine room by
steel partitions. Bilges are cleaned
with waste saturated with turpentine.
This particular bilge cleaner was tc-o
lazy to fill one of the small turpentine
cans provided for the purpose. He
dragged a five-gallon can of turpentine
to his section and began work.
One of the strictest rules on a man
of-war is the one prohibiting smoking
in the engine roc-m, but there was nev
er a rule or law yet made which man
was not tempted to break. The bilge
cleaner had fairly got under way with
his work when he took out his pipe: and
lit it, carelessly throwing the match in
the bilge. The lighted match s*et fire to
the turpentine saturated waste, and the
bilge cleaner in his excitement upset
the five-gallon can of turpentine, and in
Si second the biige was converted into
a roaring mass of (lame that played di
rectly against the steel bulkhead sepa
rating the engine rcom from the maga
zine.
The cleaner shouted and ran for his
life.
The second-class fireman was the
only other man in the after engine
room at the time this happened. He
made a jump for the bilge covers that
had been removed by his careless
mate and thrust them over the bilges,
getting a number of severe burns while
doing it. Then he opened one of the
' intakes from the sea and let the water
directly into the bilge that was in
flames. By the time the fire quarters
was founded and the men on deck got
to their stations below the second-class
fireman, with his hair and eyebrows
all burned off and the skin peeling
from his face and hands, was throwing
bucketful after bucketful of the in
coming water against the steel bulk
head which was already so hot that it
sent back clouds of steam. He won his
promotion by this deed and the damage
he did by flooding the engine room was
nothing compared to what would have
happened had the flames played on
that bulkhefcd a few minutes longer.

EUROPE IS
RE-ARMING
IN July, 1807, the German Emperor
called together his military attaches
at a formal breakfast. After eating
and presumably drinking his Impe-
rial Majesty, with one of his sud
den bursts of frankness under such cir
cumstances, told his officers that it was
no use keeping it a secret any longer;
the German army had had its artillery
changed without anything being known
about it.
How well the secret was kept may
be understood from the fact that Krupp
employs" 16,000 workmen and that sev
eral powers try to spend large sums
in Germany to obtain military and
naval intelligence.
That happened which might have
been expected upon the Emperor's pos
sibly indiscreet avowal. The French
military attache of the Berlin Em
bassy at once took train for Paris,
and found "his Government prepared. to
deal promptly with the question.
Only the cost had prevented the
French war office from making the
change before. The reason for this
hesitation will be grasped when it is
stated that the extra expenditure in
volved within a very brief period ex
ceeds $50,000,000. The secret has been
kept by the French nearly as well as
the Germans kept theirs, but it Is
i:<>w known to several European gov
ernments.
The weapon : now in course of manu

REASON ST. GAUDENS
HAS LEFT AMERICA
Will Reside in Paris Because of
Too Much Politics in Sculp
ture Awards Here.
LMOST simultaneously with
A the announcement that M. Car-
IJ| olus Duran will next season join
| 1 the winter colony of French por
m trait painters who have of late
* years been adding both to their
reputation and their fortune in this
city, comes the news that Mr. St.
Gaudens, the distinguished American
Bculptor, has decided to take up his
residence abroad.
When Mr. St. Gaudens went abroad
not long ago it was supposed that he
Intended to stay only a few months.
But now his studio In New Yrrrk has
been stripped of nearly everything, it
is to rent, and his belongings have been
shipped to Paris. Mr. St. Gaudens is
building a residence and studio in Flor
ence, and will divide his time between
that city and Paris.
In taking up his residence abroad Mr.
Ft. Gaudens is only following the ex
ample of other American artists, like
Edwin A. Abbey, Frank B. Millet and
Mr. Sargent, who find the foreign art
atmosphere more congenial and stimu
lating than that of America. Certain
conditions prevail here which cannot
fail to be rasping to a sensitive artist
like Mr. St. Gaudens.
Among these may be mentioned the
fact that the award of public monu
ments is often the result of political
wire pulling rather than of artistic mer
it. While Mr. St. Gaudens may not
have suffered individually from this, it
â¢was nevertheless a cause o-f indirect
annoyance to him. He also chafed un
der the criticism which was passed up
on him for placing the nude figure of
a man in the World's Fair award med
al which he designed. Attempts to hur
ry him in his work also greatly an
noyed him. An instance of this which
became public was the effort of Â«Mrs.
John A. Logan to persuade him to has
ten work on the statue of her hus
band.
Augustus St. Gaudens' departure will
create a distinct personal void in art
circles here. He is not only the fore
most American sculptor, but is recog
nized, even in foreign art circles, as c-ne
of the leading sculptors of modern
times. Such a man could not fail to
have a distinct personality, and while
somewljat reserved in manner, espe
cially when any discussion of his own
york was under way. he was never
theless a figure both in art and social
circles here. He was very fond of mu
sic, and he and Mrs. St. Gaudens were
frequently seen in boxes at the opera
and at concerts and private musicales.
One of Mr. St. Gaudens' most Inti
mate friends In New York la Mr. Stan
ford' White. In regard to the reasons
actuating Mr. St. Gaudens in going
abroad Mr. White said:
"Mr. Gaudens felt the absolute ne
cessity of breathing again the art at
mosphere of Europe, lie has been so
busy during the last ten years that I
do not think he has been able to make
more than one trip abroad during that
time, and then he remained but a few
weeks. Now Influences in sculpture
have sprung up abroad sinct; Mr. St.
Gaudens has lived there â in fact, it
may be said that an entirely new school
of sculpture has arisen in France â and
he naturally wants to be on the spot
where every artist is immediately sen
sitive to all new conditions.
"There is no question that art for
art's sake flourishes abroad more than
it does here and that the art atmos
phere over there is far more stimulat
ing than here. There is such a thing
as art life in Europe, a getting togeth r
of artists with common ideals, which
results in mutual inspiration. The pub
lic, too, takes art more seriously, and
MUSEUM FREAKS
IN THEIR HOME LIFE
THE museum freak is no longer
what he or she used to be as a
"money maker." Freaks have
sunk so low In public favor in
this country, which once went
wild over a "What Is It?" that
profitable "dickers" with museum man
agers are now matters of extreme diffi
culty.
What has become of our old favor
ites? Are they dead, or have they gone
out of the business? An old museum
lecturer told me the other day that the
rage for human phenomena had sub
sided; that for years the supply had far
exceeded the demand. Consequently,
he argued, the scale of salaries had so
declined that the phenomena had either
died from lack of care which their
money making possibilities had form
erly provided them, like Sprague," the
"living skeleton," who. died in poverty
in Chicago; married and retired to pri
vate life in disgust, like Malcolm, the
"armless wonder," who took a mate
"out of the profession," and is now
raising vegetables Â«,nd a family in the
environs of St. Louis; or migrated to
Europe, where their services are in
great demand, like Annie Jones, the
bearded lady, who, tradition has it, is
the daughter of a wealthy Westerner
and the wife of a gymnast.
Europe seems to have taken kindly to
the phenomena, pays them "enormous
salaries," and will soon have depleted
the American market to the point of
panic. As it is one can't till an order
for a tattooed lady off-hand. And what
is to be expected when across the water
the human billiard ball, the Coxmtess
Le Blanc, draws $100 per week; the
"fat woman" $150; the elastic man as
mtich as ?200, and the "two-headed
boy" $500? Surely, a general exodus.
While the "poetical orator's" theory
as to the present scarcity of freaks may
be correct, his statement of the pe
cuniary offers that tempt them to Eu
rope, and the offers they refuse for
their appearance at homo, is to betaken
with a pinch of salt. Although in the
palmy days of the side show, years ago,
certain unfortunatesâ the Toeel twins,
for example â were paid as much as
$300 per week for their appearance, of
late years a laborer's wage Is greedily
accepted by the men and women who
are billed as "secured at an enormous
expense."
The proprietor of a side show recently
offered, for a small commission, to pro
cure an outfit of freaks for $50 per
week, exclusive of expenses. It was
learned upon careful inquiry that the
appearance of a fat woman could be
secured for $12 per week, a living skel
eton for $15, a bearded lady for $15, a
tattooed lady for $8, a Circassian beau
ty for $6, an Albino for $5, a pair of
armless wonders for $25, a fire eater
altogether the situation of affairs is
more agreeable and more helpful to an
artist's self-development than the situ
ation here.

other Lincoln statue for Chicago, some

which he has been commissioned.

It must be understood, however, that
a fine wardrobe, the ability to do a
""turn," a "sensation," and other pow
ers, possessions and qualities add con
siderably to the earning power of a
freak. A "sensation," it is said, is par
ticularly valuable.
Extraordinary monstrosities, such as
two headed boys, three legged men and
dog faced men, have no stated market
price. They "draw" well, and are
paid accordingly, when they first ap
pear, but they lose in money-making
power in exact proportion as their fa
miliarity to the public increases. Tho
passing of ;i ft'\v years reduces them to
such an extent that they are content
with a salary just .sufficient to support
themselves and managers.
Nevertheless, it is claimed that the
Tocci twins were paid $500 per week for
a four weeks' engagement in New
York, the double-headed nightingale
S6OO and the ossified man $100.
"Giants," said the poetical orator,
"come high," and it is believed that
they doâ in a senseâ but it is hardly to
be believed that the German giant,
Herr Hague, was paid $600 per week
on his first appearance here, when a
oncc-celebratfd giant, whose name the
writer has forgotten, is selling tooth
wash through the small towns of the
State, and confesses to a "mighty
skimpy" living.
Museum freaks in New York are re
quired to be in their places at 9 o'clock
in the morning each day of the week
and to remain there until 10 o'clock at
night, with short intervals for dinner
and supper. They are subject to many
petty rules, which differ with each es
tablishment, and for infringements of
which small penalties are exacted.
Their "appearances" â they are al
ways "on exhibition" â number as many
as ' the performances, occasionally as
many as nine in a single day.
The Ã¼biquitous "lecturer," with a
prefatory. "And now, ladies and gentle
men, direct your Attention to the hu
man" waves his hand. The freak
rises and smiles, while the lecturer, in
grandiloquent phrase and with many a
pleasantry, if he be able to turn them â
and therein lies his own value in the
sight of the proprietor â recommends
him to the careful Inspection of the
"audience," always concluding with,
"The lady (or gentleman) -will be
pleased to converse with as many as
may desire."
Meanwhile the freaks read yellow
covered love stories; busy themselves
with their "work," or gape and muse,
looking bored and ill. Few minutes'
conversations with "any one who may
desire" are eagerly welcomed, for they
afford a little relief to the monotony
and offer the chance of the sale of a
photograph or "story of my life." More

from his more arduous labors, and I
presume he will occasionally turn aside
to execute sculpture of this kind."
What Mr. White says about Mr. St.
Gaudens' method of work is borne out
by the fact that his most famous
monument, the Shaw memorial in Bos
ton, was not completed until twelve
years after he received the commis
sion for it. It was erected in memory
of Robert Gould Shaw, colonel of the
first regiment of colored troops which
Massachusetts sent to the front, and
who was killed in the famous assault
on Fort Wagner. By a curious coinci
dence it was finished on October 10,1896,
the anniversary of Shaw's birth.
Yet, while Mr. St. Gaudens was oc
cupied so long in completing this work,
he also executed during these twelve
years much of the sculpture which has
given him his international reputation.
The Shaw memorial, which he was
'â¢thinking ' out" during these many
years, is in the shape of a huge
bronze mural tablet, 14 feet wide and
11 feet high from the base line to the
center of the arch which forms Its top.
While his idea for the memorial always
consisted of an equestrial figure of Col-
ST. GAUDENS AT WORK.
onel Shaw, with coir red troops in the
background, he nevertheless made a
change in the scheme at-t time when
the memorial was aimost finished. De
stroying everything he had done, he
began the work all over again. He
considered that he had not brought out
Hit figures in high enough relief, and
as now finished and in place the relief
is so high that the figures are almo.st
"in the round," and the strength of tho
design is preserved whether you obtain
a front or side view of it.
Mr. St. Gaudens' career is again proof
that art is democratic, for so far as
known there was nothing in his ancea

off his war paint and loosens his hair,
so reducing himself suddenly to civi
lization; the monstrosities who are un
able to help themselves are prepared to
meet the night air by their parasitic
managers â one and all hurry away to
their living places or to their amuse
ments.
The friends of the museum freak,
properly so called, are limited strictly
to the members of his profession. How
ever ignorant of the worth of his ab
normality he may have been when
"discovered" and first exhibited, he
goon gathers a high appreciation of it
â indeed, no one has a higher â and bs
comes supercilious to a degree in his
treatment of those of the public with
whom necessity forces him into con
tact. A more potent influence, how
ever, is his realization of the fact that
people to whom his stock in trade ap
peals will not pay to see that which,
with patience, they can see for noth
ing. Thus he cannot afford to cheapen
himself by pursuing companionship,
pleasure or even health, if need be that
he pass frequently through the open
streets. He spends his time at the
theater and at home, concealing his
identity as best he can f while going
quickly to and fro.
In former years so carefully were the
freaks guarded from free exposure to
the public gaze that living rooms were
provided for them in tho museums. So
accommodated, they rarely passed
through the door from the first day
of their engagement to the last. While,
with the decline of public interest, these
queer places have been, for tho most
part, closed, there is still one to be
seen in New York.
It is situated in the topmost story
of the museum building, and ap
proached by a narrow, broken stair.
Designed as a spacious curio hall, it has
been partitioned off into a dozen or
more straitened sleeping rooms, fur

permit. The partitions #re unpainted

now in Europe), and such data as "Jan.

which have been added, in other hands,
remarks complimentary and the re

was from the south of France and his
mother was a native of Dublin, where
Mr. St. Gaudens himself was born, in
184 S. But he was only six months old
when his parents came to this coun
try. For many years the elder St.
Gaudens had a small shoe store in
Fourth avenue, near the National
Academy of Design. Part of the Ly
ceum Theater now occupies its site.
When he was 13 years old St. Gaudens

the same time he began studying draw

a pupil at the Cooper Union and then
for two years at the National Academy
of Design. In 1567 he entered the
sculpture studio of Jouffroy in Paris,
He remained there three years and af

native, was exhibited in plaster at the
Paris Solon. The novel merits of the
work were appreciated at once and re-
ceived the highest praise from the
French critics. The work made a de
cided impression when it was unveiled
i:i this city, and from that time on
Mr. St. Gaudens has been acknowl
edged one of the leading sculptors of
the day.

HER THIRTY YEARS`
EXPERIENCE IN TROUSERS
Dr. Mary Walker Tells of Some
of the Amusing Adventures
She Has Had.
|~ WAS talking the other day with
I Dr. Mary Walker, the only woman
I in the United States who wears
J^ trousers and doesn't wish she were
a man. That is her boast, and &he
has made an international reputa
tion by pursuing her fad.
There is really nothing mannish
about Dr. Mary except her clothes, and
in wearing them she is L -nd to have
her own way, which is distinctly a fem
inine trait. She is a diminutive crea
ture, with the thinnest of treble voices,
sharp features, abbreviated hair just
turning to gray, and spectacles. Her
ordinary dress is a plain black suit of
broadcloth, with frock coat and a silk
hat. For street wear in the winter
she has a heavy brown overcoat with
velvet collar and a cape, and at all
times she carries a stout cane with a
silver head fully as large as her fist:
If she wore skirts she would look very
like a little old maid. As it is, with
her erect carriage, trim figure and
sprightly walk she seems like a boy
dressed a little beyond his years.
She has been wearing trousers for
thirty years and longer. Nobody knows
exactly how long, for this is a point
on which the doctor resolutely closes
her mouth.
"This is a free country," she said,
"and as I was not responsible for be
ing a woman, I failed to see the reason
why I should be compelled to endure
the discomforts of -skirts for a life
time simply because I didn't happen to
be born a man."
When Dr. Mary was in the army she
was an acting assistant surgeon with
the rark of first lieutenant, and she
dressed the same as the other officers.
She wore trousers at that time, with a
stripe of gold lace down the side of the
leg; a felt hat, with gold cords, and an
officer's overcoat. Her coat was not
like that which she has since adopted,
but was shaped like a blouse, cut
loosely about the neck.
"When I had on my overcoat,
though," she said proudly, "I looked
every inch the man, and I am s,ure I
acted it for I vas the only woman
holding a commission in the army of
the United States, and I am the only
woman who has been grante . a medal
by Congress for active military duty."
As she said this the little doctor point
ed to the bronze medal fastened with
a big black-headed pin and a red.
white and blue ribbon to the lapel of
her coat. On the back of the medal
was engraved the legend: "Presented
by the Congress of the United States
to Mary E. Walker, A. A. Surgeon, U.
S. Army."
"Do I ever have unkind things said
to me?" she said, echoing back my
question. "Yes, of course; by ill-bred
people.
"The othor day at the White House
reception I met Mr. Wu, the Chinese
Minister, who was there with his wife.
When I was introduced the Minister
asked me why I wore pants. I saw the
question was suggested by the natural
inquisitiveness of the Asiatic, and I
replied *â  the same vein, "Why do you
wear sKirts?
" 'Because it is the custom of my
country to wear them,' .he replied.
'Well, 1 said I, 'I wear pants because
this is a free country and people are
not hampered with customs.* Then he
said: "They say you are a doctor. If I
was sick I would not send for you; but
if my wife was sick I should.' I told
him I should be glad to attend his wife

every three years, it is said, every freak
in the world sees New York. The fa

through that district lying on the east
side below Fourteenth street for a few

may be found in most of them; boom
few, however, make a great pretense at

"I have been taken for a Catholic

Mary. "More than once people have
sworn to mo that I was- Father So and
So. and they wouldn't listen to a denial.
Once at the White House a man hailed
me as Brother Brown of his church in
Atlanta, and when I told him he Â«
mistaken I couldn't get him to believe
me. Sometimes the mistakes hai,e
been very funny. Young girls have
tried to flirt with me and I have been
simply shocked by the brazen effront
ery of some women whom I have met
while traveling. One of them actually
asked: me how often I shaved. She
thought I was a bc-y, and wouldn t taKa
my word to the contrary.
"Some women. delight in asking ma
why I don't dress like them. I al

and I really don't see why I can't hava

ple asking me questions about them. I
tell such women that if they will send
me their gowns I will wear them, I
take very good care not to say. how I
will wear them, and as they never send
me any I am saved the trouble of ex
plaining. Orfe lady promised to send,
me a skirt and asked me if I would
wear it as she wore hers. I told her I
would put it on over my trousers and
then hold it up as she did so as not to
interfere with my walking. She was
angry and left me. I suppose she gave
me up as a hopeless case."

the ones who are copying after me.
"I don't pretend to be a dude, ana I
don't care very much about following
the latest styles. I don't care whether
my trousers are cut on the American
or the Persian or -the Russian pattern.
All I ask is that they look well and fit
comfortably. Â«_ _ .
"I really don't know," she added, in
answer to a question, "how many pairs
of pantaloons I wear out in the course
of a year. Not a great many, though.
It depends on the quality of the goods,
and that depends, in turn, on the
pocketbook, so, you see, it is a variable
quantity. In the practice of medi
cine, of course, one doesn't have to
wear out one's clothes very rapidly,
and, besides, I think I am careful of
my clothing. Somebody asked me once
whether I made my own clothes. Of
course I don't. I have too many other
things to do."

Or\e of Jhern Measures Exactly Jhree Inches, ar\d
tke Proud OWrxer Is Galled tke "Lily of Qold"
by JHer Admiring Country Wo rr\er\.
TO have small feet is the aim of
every fair Celestial maiden. Their
eyes may not be as almond shaped
as they would wish them to be,
their faces not round. enough, their
nails may be too short, but if their
feet are tiny, then all other troubles
count as nothing with them. To be the
proud and happy possessor of a minute,
distorted pair of feet is a thing of joy
and beauty forever, according to the
Chinese standard of the beautiful.
Nor is it easy to have feet sufficiently
tiny to satisfy the cravings of the aris
tocratic Chinese maidens. Feet that
appear ridiculously small and unman
ageable as t*heir possessors â  toddle in
and out the busy thoroughfares are
"heap big" in the eyes of the half dozen
Chinese women who have feet small
enough to satisfy the most fastidious
mandarin.
Among all the Chinese women who
help to make this city picturesque there
are but six with really small â that
is, their feet are called small by even
the rigid Chinese standard. These six
women were eagerly snatched up as
wives by the most prominent members
of the rich and powerful Six Companies
the moment they landed in San Fran
cisco.
In fact, they were brought here for
that purpose, and in the matrimonial
contracts it was distinctly stated that
their price would not be paid unless
they were women with "Lilies of Gold,"
for it is by that poetical name that the
Chinese women with surpassingly
small feet are known.
The length of the feet of these six
women . varies from 33 1/*1 /* to 44 I,*.1 ,*. inches.
The wife of Mr. Sing, powerful in the
Six Companies, has the smallest foot of
them all. Her shoe from toe tip to heel
line measures exactly 3% inches.
Down in Chinatown when Mrs. Sing
appears on the street in her gorgeous
robes, supported on either side by a
servant, the women and children crowd
the doors and windows to see "The Lily
of Gold" pass. Even with the help of
her women attendants, Mrs. Sing sways
to and fro in a perilous manner when
she attempts to walk on the street.
In her own house she moves about
from room to room by balancing her
self with her arms. If, however, it is
necessary to go through several rooms
she does not depend on her arms alone,
but carries a parasol with which she
steadies herself.
Mr. Ping is very proud of his wife's
feet. In his rather fluent English, he
recounted at length that there are but
six "lilies of gold." in the city, lingering
always on the fact that his wife is the
rarest and best of the "lilies of gold."
Mrs. Sins, who does not understand a
word of English, plied the gold threads
in and out in the new pair of shoes she
was making for herself. She intuitive
ly knew that her feet were the subject
of conversation, and persistently hid
them. If for a moment she forgot and
let them peep forth from beneath her
trousers, the instant she noticed they
were being observed she coyly covered
them with her fan and slid them back.
"A Chinese lady does not tike to show
her feet." said Mr. Sing. "She does not

"How is it. " was asked, "that so few
â¢ cr<Tnwe wnmfn have small feet- like
your wife's, when they all bind them

"Oh, my wife is of verra fine familyâ
verra fine family." was the . reply.
"Only the ladies in the very best fami
lies of China understand how to prop
erly bind the feet to make them small.
The mother does it herself and she
teaches her children how to.do.it so
that when they marry they can do it to
their daughters. They keep the method
a strict fajnily secret among themselves
and the Common people never under
stand how to do it."
"You see her feet?" pointing to one
of the waiting women belonging to his
wife. "Look how bis: her feet are. yet
they were bound when she was a child,
but her mother was of the common peo
ple, and she did not understand how it
was done. As I said the proper method
is a great family secret."

The binding process is said to exert
a markedly depressing influence upon
the emotional character of the women
who are subjected -to the extremely
painful process. Compared to Mrs.
Sing, stolid and expressionless, the at
tendant seemed almost animated. Per

or a truth so it would seem. And
according to the most popularly be
lieved tale it was a "cute" Chinese
Princess who is accountable for the na
tional custom of deforming the feet.
This Princess, Taki, lived about the
time of the Trojan wa- s;:ys a Chi
nese poet. She was as bei -!i:;;l as
the sun. fairer than Helen herseif.
Bul both her feet were <: formed. She
was so beautiful that <!â¢â¢.-]>!'.â¢ her club

I>;> tely was he under the spell ol her
beauty that she made bin, believe that
her malformed feet were tb â  mosl
beautiful in the world. But she lived
in constant terror that some day the
Emperor would be no longer blinded
by her other charms and would see her
feet as they really wire.
At laX she hit upon a plan whereby
she could feel secure. She told her hus
band that the other women of the
royal family were so ' alous of her
small feet that they made her life un
bearable.
She lamented bitterly that they did
not all possess small feet like her own
since they were so anxious to have
them. She proposed that her husband
issue a royal edict commanding that
all aristocratic women compress their
feet until they approach the shape of
hers.
The Emperor was delighted at her
magnanimity. Her generosity in being
willing that the other women should
have feet equally as beautiful as hers
delighted him. He proclaimed an im
perial edict and from that time foot
binding in China became a national
institution.
Thus by forcing upon her sisters her
misfortune the Princess Taki hid her
deformity from her husband and kept
his admiration at the expense of all *he
women of China.
The Chinese begin to bind the child's
feet when she is about G years old. It
requiresa period of two or three years'
continual strapping by means of tight
bandages before the desired effect is
produced. There is a varying degree
of pain. During the first year it is al
most intolerable. It gradually dimin
ishes as the binding of all the joints is
completed.
During the binding period the girl
at "night lies with her legs in such a
position as to make pressure under the
knees, thus. benumbing the parts below
and avoiding the major degree of pain.
In this position, swinging their legs
backward and forward, the, poor Chi
nese girls pass many a weary night.
During this period the feel are un

foot longitudinally. The girl is then

leg usually regains the muscles and

small.
Next to Mrs. Sing's foot, the smallest

MAX MULLER`S
REMINISCENCES.
Max Muller'a lecture experiences at
the Royal lns:ituti(in are amusingly
related. He records with due gratifi
cation that he had brilliant audiences.
All the best men of the town were
there. Even royalty sometimes put
in an appearance. But the old ha
bitues of the Royal Institution were
not easy to please. The front row
was generally occupied by old men
with hearing trumpets, old Indians, old

Max Muller had to make speeches
as well as deliver lectures. This side
of his oratorical career furnishes an
interesting' anecdote. At one of the
Royal Academy dinners he had to re
turn thanks for literature and scholar
ship. He sat opposite to Robert
Browning, who was known to be
firmly opposed to getting on his feet.
"I was, of course, rehearsing my
speech during the whole of the dinner
time, while he enjoyed himself talk
ing to his friends.

while he was enjoying his dinner in
peace, he laughed, and said that he
had said 'No' once for all, and that he
had never in his life made a public
speech. 1 believe, as a rule, poets are
not good speakers. They are too care
ful about what they wish to say. As
dinner advanced I became more and
more convinced of the etymological
identity of honor and onus. At last
my turn came.
"Having to face the brilliant so
ciety which is always present at this
dinner, including the Prince of Wal^s.
the Ministers of both parties, the most
eminent artists, scientists, authors and
critics, 1 had, of course, learned my
speech by heart, and was* getting on.

Prince of Wales laughing and- saying
something to . his neighbor. At once
the thread of my speech was broken.
I began to think whether 1 could have
said anything that made the .Prince
laugh, and what it could: have been,
and while 1 was thinking in. every di
rection, 1 suddenly stood speechless. I
thought it was an eternity, and I was
afraid I should have to collapse and
make the greatest fool of myself- that
ever was. I looked at Browning and
he gave me a friendly, nod. and at that
moment my grappling-irons caught
the lost cable and I was able to finish.

â¢'When' it was over I turned to
Browning and said: 'Was it not fear
ful, that pause?' 'Far from it,' he
said "It was excellent. It gave life
"to your speech. Everybody "saw you
were ' collecting your thoughts," and
that you were not simply delivering
what you had learned by heart. Be
sides, it did not last half a minute.' To
me it- had seemed: at least five or. ten
minutes. But after Browning's good
natured words I felt relieved, and en
joyed at least what was left of a most
enjoyable dinner, the only enjoyable
public dinner 1 know."
In conclusion let me quote an excel
lent apothegm about the impression
which poets make upon their readers:
"To have known such men as Ten
nyson and Browning." says the pro
fessor, '"is indeed a rare fortune. It
helps us in two way?. We are pre
served from extravagant admiration,
which is always stupid, and. on the
other hand, we. can enjoy even insigni
ficant verses of theirs, as coming from
our friends and lighting up some cor
ner of their character.
"There are cases where personal ac
quaintance with the poets actually
spoils our taste for their poetry, which
we might otherwise have enjoyed; and
to imagine that one knows a poet bet
ter because one has once shaken hands
with him is a fatal mistake. It would
be far better to go at once to West
minster Abbey and spend a few
thoughtful moments at the tombs of
such poets as Tennyson or Browning,
for there, at all events, there would be
no disappointment."

TRAINING CITY DOGS FOR
A HARD LIFE IN ALASKA
Months Spent in Coaxing Them to Pull a
Sled, Eat One Scant Meal a Day and
Wear Pads on Their Feet.
COME on. Bingoâ that's a good
fellow. Step out lively, now.
Oh, confound it all! Why can't

The gate was ajar and I pushed it a
trifle wider open and looked in. I be
held a rather large inclosure, bounded
on one side by a low shed, divided into
email stalls, with a passageway at one
end of the structure which led into a
smaller yard, the back yard of the
building and stable situated on the cor
ner of the avenue.
Just across from me there were two
men and a half-grown boy, a long, low
sled laden with a miscellaneous col
lection of old junk, and a very-much
ashamed-of-himself-looking dog. appa
rently inextricably tangled up in a lot
of canvas straps. The dog looked em
barrassed and apologetic; his wet pink
tongue hung limply from his inanely
grinning jaws, and the end of his
bushy tail wagged feebly in would-be
propitiation, but he did not appear
either conseience-striek^i or alarmed.
Evidently the accident which had hap
pened to him was one which might
happen to any other fellow under sim
ilar circumstances, and although he
would rather It had not occurred, as it
was unpleasing to be placed in a rid
iculous position, even temporarily, he
did not feel that it was at all serious
or that it would entail any disagreeable
consequences to himself.
I glanced at the sign on the gate.
"Klondike dogs for sale," and under
stood the matter at once. This was a
training school for canine burden-bear
ers preparatory to their departure for
Alaskan service, and Bingo, the amia
ble but awkward, was taking a les
son In the art of wearing harness and
dragging sledges.
Some of the dogs, of which at least ?.
dozen were sitting or lying in the
stalls sleepily blinking in the sunshine
or watching Bingo's misadventures
with an overdone affectation of lack
of personal interest therein, gave
tongue at sight of me and forced me
Into suddeft prominence. I introduced
myself and was made welcome, the
overgrown boy, however, bashfully
disappearing as I entered.
"It may be fun to see folks train
dogs," said the man who from his
grimy and perspiring appearance was
evidently the Rarey of the occasion,
"but it ain't fun to do it. Look at me
now"â ho was dusty from head to
foot â "that theredf.-g," indicating Bingo,
who had takni his tongue in in honor
of my advent and accepted a pat on his
rough head graciously, "dragged me

his rope like a feather when I first took
him out. Just because he felt fresh and
lively, and now he can't go six steps
in harness without trying to turn round
and go backward for a change. He'd
ought to have a good walloping, that's
what he had! "
The other man, the ringmaster, as it
were, a good-looking young fellow in a
business suit and an apparently ever
blooming smile, laughed pleasantly.
"You'd be the last one to give it to
him, Jim," he said, "for you know too
much to ruin invested capital in any
such way. Do yc-u know" â this to me â
"that the man who tries to train a dog
GAULORD OF THE WEST
HE came out of the "West â but that was the only
respect in which he resembled Lochir.var. In
deed, the points of dissimilarity were noticeable.
He had no fair Ellen; his -steed, a kndtty little
mountain animal, was far from being the best
on all the wide border, and, naturally, he did not
bring it with him to Chicago.
What he did bring was a bulging pocketbook. Not
knowing exactly what to do with the contents, he bought
an astonishing amount of gay summer linen and scandal-
Izpd a discreet neighborhood by sending quantities of
American beauties to Mrs. Haddon Worcester, whom he
had met out at Denver, and whose husband had interests
Identical with his own In certain mining ventures. Mrs.
Worcester was somewhat annoyed by these attentions,
but understanding that they were only a part of the
habitual exuberance by which Thaddeus Gaylord was dis
tinguished, she accepted them with patience.
He even insisted that she should lunch with him at his
hotel, and she consented, but just as she was leaving her
house to keep this appointment a young woman alighted
from a cab, satchel and guitar case in hand, and presented
herself at Mrs. Worcester's door.
"Why, Heth Lowman!" cried Mrs. Worcester, kissing
the quiet little face of the girl, "1 thought you were not
due for a week yet. Surely you said commencement day
was the Ist of June."
"I was too tired to wait for commencement," said the
girl. "1 just thought I would come and see you."
"You're as welcome as you can be, my dear, and you
look just like your motherâ which snakes you even more
welcome."
"But 1 must tell you why I have my hat on. I'm in
vited to luncheon with a gentleman from your own town,
from Denver, who is a friend of Mr. Worcester's. My
friend will be delighted to have you come with me." Half
an hour later Thaddeus Gaylord took her pliable little
hand in his.
"I call this kind of Mrs. Worcester," Baid he; "I count
myself complimented: Mrs. Worcester, madam, you have
honored me." He led the way to the din ing- mom.
Gaylord waa of uncertain "age. He appeared to be a
man who would never grow old. His dark hair was wiry
and intractable. His eyes were blue and full of frankness.
His mustache was so voluminous, so long, and so gen
erally reckless in its appearance that it seemed like the
caricature of a mustache. His white hands had certain
protuberances on them, which indicated tWat he knew
the shovel and pick â but that's no shame to a miner, as
he would have explainedâ and his skin, naturally tender
and sensitive, bore marks of exposure.
The luncheon was quite wonderful, even for that hos
telry, and the conversation was so interesting that a num
ber of listeners made a feint of lingering' over their des
eert tÂ» hear as much of it as possible.
After luncheon Gaylord called for the best rig In the
establishment. But no sooner hnd he laid his eyes upon
It than his jocund spirit appeared to undergo some trans
formation.
"That hearse," said he to the attendant, "is intended
for me, is it?"
"Yes, sir. It is quite the most correct thing we have,
â lr."
"Mr. Reynolds," said Gaylord to the clerk. "I asked
rou fur a rig to take two ladies riding- I didn't ask you
for either tricks or work makes a fool
of himself and spoils his pupil com
pletely, if he strikes him a blow? Dogs
simply won't learn that way."
I looked at Bingo and his companions
in captivity with a new intereest and
admiration. In these days of driving
and being driven it is a pleasing thing
to find something that is not amenable
to the usual law of painful compulsion,
even if the exception to the rule be but
a mongrel dog.
"How do you manage them, then?"
I asked, and Jim, busy, with the snarl
of straps and buckles and dog's legs,
came into the conversation with a
wrathful snort.
"You have to have the patience of a
dozen Jobs," he said, "and you take
your temper out in swearing. If you
hit 'em a lick they'll lie right down in
the harness and stay there; you can't
get 'em on their feet again to do any
good that trip. And the worst o-f it is
that they put the hurt and the new ex
periment together in their minds, and
they'll always hate the harness after
ward and act like sin in it."
"We've trained eighty-five dogs so
far," said the smiling 'boss,' "and we
haven't turned out a balky one in the
whole lot, but it has turned Jim gray
headed to wrestle with them. Mongrels
â the long-haired ones â are the best for
the business, for they are always
stronger and healthier than pure
blooded close-bred dogs, but there's all
kinds of dispositions among them, and
what goes with one don't go with the
next one. In the first place you've got
to make them understand clearly just
what you want of them, and some are
very dull of comprehension. You've got
to make it perfectly plain to them, and
show them over and over; coax them a
little at first, and praise them when
they do the right thing.
"First we get them so that they will
wear a harness peaceably, without.try
ing to turn somersaults or chew the
whole business into shoestrings. Then
we hitch a plank or piece of wood to the
traces, and then the fun begins. Some
of them seem to think that they've got
a tin can or something of the kind tied
to their tails, and they simply go crazy,
but others are more sensible. We have
a rope or chain around their necks, you
see," waving an illustrative hand to
ward Bingo, who was by this time trot
ting pleasantly along beside the per
spiring Jim, "and we walk along with
them. Sometimes we have to pull them
a bit, and sometimes we hold a piece of
meat in front of their noses. Some way
or other we get it into their heads that
we want them to go along and drag
things after*them, and it isn't very long
before they do it all right."
"But they are whipped up in Alaska,"
said I, remembering some of the grue
some stories of cruelty which have
thawed out and floated down to us, and
the smiling young man shrugged his
shoulders deprecatingly.
"There are brutes and fools every
where," quoth he, oracularly. "I have
known of men beating horses to death
right here in San Francisco, but all tho
same that isn't the best way to get
good work out of them."
And then, being a person of tact, he
turned my attention to more agreeable
things. He personally conducted me
for a hearse, sir. I'm not one of the mourners! No. nor
the corpse, damned if I am! Get me a wagon, sirâ a road
cartâ something yellow."
A few minutes later Gaylord was driving two bright
chestnuts up the Lake Shore drive, before a yellow road
cart, and every time the chestnuts lifted theirdainty legs
there was a clanking of brazen chains.
"Now, this," said Gaylord, fairly unfurling his splendid
mustache to the wind, in the exuberance of his enjoyment,
"reminds me of Denver. Now, I feel at home!"
After that (iayjord called every day at the Worces
ters and saw the ladies. Two bunches of roses came daily
to the house nuw, and the roses for Miss Lowman were
invariably whiteâ and sometimes the flowers were not
roses at all, but lilies.
Mrs. Worcester did not want to shirk responsibility,
but she rather hastened the departure of her guest, and
explained afterward to Gaylord that she had been sum
moned by her father, who wanted her at home.
"Why didn't you telegraph me, madam? I'd have gone
with herâ indeed I would. I would have seen' her safe to
her journey's end. Who knows what annoyances she may
encounter? You ought to h&ve told me, and I can't un
derstand why you didn't!"'
It is necessary to record the fact that Thaddeus was
not known to the fashionable set of Denver. But on his
return and upon finding that Miss Heth Lowman had been
introduced to society at Mrs. Dexter's afternoon he grew
socially ambitious.
He went to Vernon Harcourt Beresford with his dif
ficulty. Beresford lent a sympathetic ear.
'I'll bring you out, my boy!" cried Beresford. "I'll
give you a chance to make your virgin bow to society at
my table, and I'll have people there who will make the
rest easy. You ought to shine in Denver society, Gaylord.
I'm dashed if you oughtn't. But the first thing you must
do, man, is to get yourself in proper gear."
"You don't like my clothes?"
"Clothes? Do you -call those domes? Gaylord, I hate
to tell you, but the truth is. you have never dressed in
your life. You have merely covered your nakedness.
Now, you ought to have a valet."
"Doâ do you think so?" asked Gaylord, doubtfully.
"But we don't raise valets out here. They don't grow in
this soil."
"You might send to England for one. I know a man
who will send you jusr the- fellow. Here's his address
had a letter from him to-day."
"I'll cable him," exclaimed Gaylord, suddenly electri
fied. "I'll do it this minute."
Ocean greyhounds are fleet, and so are the overland
filers, and in little more than a fortnight Richard Stubbs,
a gentleman's gentleman, knocked at Gaylord's door at
the Brown Palace.
Gaylord shouted to come In and Richard Stubbs en
tered.
"How do you do, sir," said Gaylord, rising, "I haven't
the pleasure â "
"Richard Stubbs, sir, of London, at your service â the
man you sent for, sir."
"Man I seqt â O. yes, yes! Glad to meet you, sir; glad
to meet you! I hope you had a pleasant voyage." He
held out a welcoming hand and greeted the Englishman
as If they were reunited brothers.
There was a pause. Stubbs finally said:

tell me my room, I'll have my boxes taken up. And as
you may be going out presently, sir, perhaps you will
be kind enough to show me where I will lind your ward

moccasins, some of them fleece-lined,
which, securely tied above the dew
claw on the canine leg, protect the feet
from frost, ehillblains and ice cuts.
I learned that since the Klondike ex
citement began and dogs of size, butj
no particular pedigree, came to be
merchantable articles, our frugal
Italian and Portuguese citizens, who
formerly subsisted on the income de
rived from the crops raised in outlying â¢
vegetable gardens, have gathered the
golden harvest from the sale of the
dogs, who heretofore protected their
small farms. Scores of dogs who
seemed, less than a year ago, destined
to spend their uneventful lives in
frightening hoodlums from making
predatory excursions into tempting
strawberry and melon beds have found
themselves torn from their homes and
delivered over to the trainer, and
thence carried to the icy land where
cold and hungry, footsore and wretched
they have worked and starved and suf
fered until death came and their poor,
abused bodies have been fed to their
less fortunateâ because still alive â com
panions.
These "dago dogs," as they are called,
are, however, not the only ones that
have been swept northward by the tide
of human necessity, but from all over
the coast, from cities and villages and
ranches dogs have been collected on
speculation and shipped to Alaska. The
voyage up is particularly hard on them,
for they suffer from cramped quarters,
sea-sickness and each other's ill tem
per. When they arrive in port they are
generally a sorry looking lot, but they
are usually sorrier before their life
work is over. Life in the Klondike re
gion is hard enough for the men who go
there of their own volition, but it is far
worse for the poor brutes who are car
ried prisoners and forced to wear out
a miserable existence in unwilling and
thankless service.
They were beautiful dogs to which I
was introduced, every one of them,
though not one of them showed the dis
tinctive "points" which would have
gained him the respectful consideration
of a true dog fancier. They were all
long-haired, or what is technically
known as "rough-coated" animals, and
all in excellent condition, as their diet
and general health is carefully looked
out for for some time before sending
them away.
"Pick up a dog and send him up off
hand," said my kindly host, "and you
might as well send a dead one for all
the' good he will be. We get them used
to one regular meal a day, and Klon
dike fare at that, and when our output
arrives every dog in it is worth having.
They'll drag heavy loads, make good
time and live on cracklings or tallow
and meal."
Bingo was through with his lesson by
this time and 1 was relegated to his stall,
while two of his companions, whose ed
ucation had been longer under way,
were brought out, harnessed tandem
fashion, and driven merrily around the
inclosure for my edification. They
seemed to enjoy the performance huge
ly, holding their heads well up and
wagging their tails whenever a halt was
called, and the only mistake they made
was occasionally getting their hind feet
over the traces.
"Dogs would be a sight easier to
teach if they only had two legs," said
Jim, "but they learn to manage all four
after a while. Take a new one, though,
and he seems to be a regular centiped
the first hour you spend with him.
REGRETS THE STEP THAT
MADE HIM A HERMIT
AT the side of a hill near the Alms
house is a hut, tho front of which
has a door and one window. The
back is built into the hill. Only
a short piece of pipe peeps
through the roof, giving the outside
world the knowledge of a stove. The
one room â which serves as a kitchen,
sitting room and bedroomâ is extremely
neat. A bookcase is the only luxury
outside of the necessary furniture.
And its occupant? An old man, with
beard and hair white :is the drifting
snow and eyes that retain a wonderful
brightness. He is tall, although his
shoulders are stooped with the weight
of many years. His v 'ice is gentle and
kind, bespeaking a true gentleman.
Every ' morning he starts off for a
long walk. About once or twice a week
he takes a sack unri^r his arm and with
the aid of his cane finds his way up and
down the hills into the midst of civili
zation. There ;ire several families
whom he visits, and at the first place
he usually gets a cup of hot coffee,
robe. Or you may wish me to attire you for luncheon,
sir?"
Gaylord, who had beon glancing: over the paper for the
last few seconds, looked up in something akin to con
sternation.
"Attire me for luncheon! Why, damme, man, I've got
the only clothes I have on my backâ except that old
diagonal suit for Sundays. Wardrobe! Merciful powers!
Wardrobe! My wardrobe. Stubbs. Is in the closet. It
consists of pajamas and a bathrobe."
"May I ask you, sir, under those circumstances, what
my duties are to be, andâ begging your pardonâ why you
sent for me. sir?" ___
Oaylord stared a moment at the valet, and thon went
over to him and good humoredly pushed him into a chair.
"See here, Stubbs." said he, "I'm going to be frank
with you. I'm a miner. I've made my pile. I've traveled
a hundred miles to every one of yours. I've known cold
and hunger and rough living of all sorts. But now that's
over. I've two of the richest silver mines In the State.
I'm at a place where I can enjoy life, and I've earned my
right to do it. I've got to stand on my own merits as. a
man, but I think I'd look better to the world in general
if I had a tailor. Now, I want you to rub me down, so to
speak, and send me out well groomed. In short, array
me like Solomon. I'll place a bank account at your dis
posal and I want you to do the thing right."
Stubbs regarded him with a pair of honest bovine eyeg
for a moment. Then the man in him rose to meet the
man in Gaylord, and they shook hands vigorously in
sign of compact. This certmony over, Stubbs became in
stantly the valet, ajid was never for an instant after
ward anything else.
A week after this Vernon Harcourt Beresford gave a
dinner, and the guest of honor was Thaddeus Gaylord,
who. In the most conventional attire, told vocif'-rous
sttfrks with a gusto all his own. There were any number
of people present who were glad to make the acquaint
ance of a good story teller, because they gave dinners
themselves, and when the evening was over the new as
pirant for social favors found himself in the" possession
of a number of pleasant invitations. He went home
exultant. It was now only a matter of a few days before
he could meet Miss Lmvman on an equal footing.
The first time Gaylord met Miss Lowmai was at a
dancing party given by Mrs. Thurlow Green. I Miss Low
man wore a severe frock of white, out of which arose her
giriish neck, delicate as alabaster. Her face 'still bore a
look of innocent hauteur, and her sweet voice was tuned
to a minor key. The young gentlemen of Denver had
already dubbed her the ice maiden, but Mr. Thaddeus
Gaylord was a Chinook wind, as he himself might have
said had he undertaken a simile, and her frigidity did
not even arrest his attention.
The next day Gaylord called. The next day after that
he sent flowers. When he met her at dinner at Mrs.
Drexel's she was wearing some of them in her drab hair.
After that he always sent flowers â every, day. Her father
might well have Inquired into this devotion had it been
her father's nature to inquire into anything. But he was
a distrait sort of man. who appeared to speculate absent
mindedly, and who seemed vaguely and largely suc
cessful.
Stubbs saw the photograph of a girl on his patron's
dressing table and drew his own conclusionâ especially
after he found it one morning under his g-entleman'a
pillow. In course of time a delicately painted miniature
replaced the photograph. Stubbs was able to observe
certain marked changes in his patron also.

You've got to hold onto yourself to get

But I, looking pitifully at the big
shaggy heads In which there was no

something to put In his sack; and by
the time his last visit is made his full
sack contains enough in quality and
variety to keep him through the week.
One would think this o.d man lone
some. Not so, for although he seldom
speaks to any one except on his regu
lar visits he finds much to occupy his
mind. His dog, which guards the hut
day and night, and his books aj-e his
daily companions.
"I have no name now," he said in an
swer to a question. "I am unknown to
the world, and so let me remain. Call
me the Hermit, or what you will, but
the name I had in the world of activity
has long ago died."
"How long have you been in San
Francisco?" I asked. .
"Ever since the early part of the '50's

ried one of the best girls in San Fran
cisco. After a few years of wedded
bliss she died, leaving a three-year-old
One day, however, a cloud appeared on Stubbs horizon.
It may of may not have been bigger than a man's hand;
Stubbs was not in a position to say, because for some
time he paid no attention to it whatever. The first thing
he noticed was that every morning Mr. Gaylord was
avid for his paper, and that he turned to the Washington
news and read It feverishly. Later on the valet observed
that a strange anxiety lay upon the whole city. Excited
groups talked and gesticulated together on the street
corners. Men lingered long In the barber shops, har
anguing. The hotel rotundas were thronged at night,
and, apparently, not for purposes of pleasure. Miners
thronged the city by the thousands, fresh from the camps.
Bulletins were eagerly read in the clubs and the news
paper windows. The rooms of the Mining Exchange
hummed like a hive with men.
One morning the papers printed the news that India
had suspended the coinage of silver. That day there were
three suicides at Rico and two at Ourayâ and perhaps
some others elsewhere, of which no one took note The
air was electric with presage of disaster. Gaylord ate
nothing all day, and that evening he stayed in his room
âa thing he had not done since he returned rrom Chicago.
About this time Colorado began to make new fashions
for itself. Beresford invited his friends to dine with him
under the auspices of the Sheriff. So they cameâ all the
merry old rounders, and drank good wine under the nose
of the Sheriffâ who drank as much as anybody. In fact,
Mrs. Beresford, in her corn-colored satin, held aloft an
iridescent goblet of twisted glass in her hand and cried:
"To the Sheriff," and the company drained the amber
liquid to him, while he came in from an anteroom to
bow his acknowledgments.
Up in the camps hard-luck dinners became the rage.
One dinner was given at Rico to which ten penniless men
sat down who had been millionaires, or well on the way
to be such, the week before. The food they ate was ob
tained on credit, and they sent out a telegram asking for
passes to Denverâ which they got.
The days passed feverishly. Men waited 'for the final
blow. It came. The Sherman act was repealed. The
Government no longer guaranteed the purchase of silver.
Gaylord came to Stubbs with the old wnimsical smile
about his face.
"I'm done for," he said, "I'm cleaned out, Stubbs. But
there's a lot of ethers traveling my roact, and I'm not
going to feel lonesome. I'm simply going to pack my grip
and get out. If you want to go with me, you may. I
brought you over here and you may share my fortunes
to the end if you wish. But I give you fair warning
they'll be misfortunes from this time on for a while.
Of course, I'll get on my feet again somehow, but I
don't know when nor where nor how. I'm used to
roughing it, and I don't mindâ at least, I wouldn't mind
but for one thingâ but that's neither here nor there.
Now, what will you do? I'm with you, Stubbs! Say your
say."
"Why, sir," said the man, touched by his employer's
misfortunes, "there's a very respectable place in a bar
ber's shop that will be open to me. and I'll be better
there. I'd be a burden to you, sir, but I'll be well pro
vided for, and in conditionâ l beg your pardon, sir, but
you'll understand how I mean itâ to be or some assist
ance to you, should you need it at any time."
The tears were In Gaylord's eyes in a second.
"No, no, Stubbs. I shan't need your assistance, I hope.
But if I do, I'll ask for it and be proud toâ and there's
my hand on it. I don't know yet where I'll go, but
there are many reasons why the sooner I get away from
here the better."
-That night Thaddeus Gaylord left Denver. Stubbs re
turned to his master's old apartments at the Brown
Palace and was gathering up such of his trinkets as he
had not packed, when a nervous little knock at the door
arrested him. He opened it to the lady of the miniature.
"He is gone?" she almost whispered. "Mr. Gaylord is
really gone?" She held a note in her hand which Stubbs
at once saw was in his departed patron's handwriting.
"He is gone, madam." said Stubbs. bowing profoundly.
She walked back and forth in the room in apparent
distress of mind".
"You are his man?" she asked at length, stopping
suddenly and facing Stubbs.
"I am, and If I can be of any service to you pray let
me know, ma'am. I'm sure Mr. Gaylord would wish me
to da anything in my power â or â or his, ma'am."
"Mr. Gaylord," said the lady, "wasâ was a friend of
mine. He has gone just when I needed him most. I do
not know what to doâ what to doâ what to do!" She
wrung her pretty little hands together.
"Won't you tell me what I can do for you, ma'am.
There is certainly something!"
"Listen!" she eaid, drawing near the valet and looking
at him with dilated eyes. "I have something so terrible
to say that you will hardly believe me! No one knows
yetâ not a soul. As soon as I found it out I locked the
door and came here. I ran all the way. I knew the
number of his room, and I came right hereâ and he is
gone. I had a note saying he was going, but I thought I
might gÂ»-t here in time. Do you know what has happened?
My father â " she took hold of the valet's sleeveâ groping
for human sympathyâ "my poor father has killed, him
self!"
By and by she grew calmer and permitted him to in
form the proper persons and to send for her carriage
and see her safe home. He sent out telegrams after the
departing train on which his patron had gone, but no
response came.
The death of Georee Lowman attracted but little at
forebodings of the cruel hardships com
ing daily nearer, and feeling Bingo's
friendly, cold nose push against my
hand as I passed him on my way out,
felt that I, "worth while" though it
daughter. I kept my home for this lit
tle girl, who had all the advantages T>f
a good education, music and language
included. One day I returned from my
office and found my daughter gone. Af
ter a diligent search she was located in
a place where good girls should not be.
I kept my home, with the vain hope
that she would some day return, until
I heard of her miserable death. Broken
hearted I sold ever; thing and fled to
the hills to find peace and comfort in
the quietness of nature, and here I still
am."
"Do you not sometimes wish yourself
back in the city?"
"Sometimes I do, and regret the
hasty and foolish step I took; but I
have become accustomt.. to my sur
roundings and expect to remain here
till I die."
DESERTIONS ARE NOT COMMON.
The recent arrest in Jamaica of an al
leged deserter from a warship in the
Brooklyn Navy Yard was rather an un
usual event in this neighborhood.
Sometimes soldiers stray from Willets
Point or sailors from the navy yard get
drunk and overstay their time, but that
is an offense hardly to be called deser
tion.
The service of Uncle Sam has become
much more attractive of recent years
than it was in the past. Barring the
chance of getting into the command of
a brutal officer, the wearer of the blue
has a pretty good opportunity to profit
by his enlistment. Of course the pay
tention. When the news of his insolvency and his suicide
went abroad people simply concluded that they had over
estimated his wealth and had been mistake^ as to the
source from which it came.
His daughter's existence was unknown to many of
those who had an acquaintance with her father, for it
was but a few weeks since she came to the city. The
women who had taken it upon themselves to introduce
her and to show her courtesies were kind now, and
invited her to their houses and sent flowers.
The poor child turned toward them a white face of
refusal and shut her doors on all the world. She dis
missed the servants the next morning and bent herself
to the task of looking after her father's affairs. She
gave the whole thing over finally into the hands of his
attorneys and quitted the place at twilight, when none
might see her, with no attendant save the faithful Stubbs.
He had sent her trunk to a quiet place in the suburbs,
where the mountains looked down on a grass-grown table
land and white streets, irrigating ditches apd clumps of
wild willows.
For several days she did little but He on the settee
and watch the rise and fall of the fire. The conscious
ness that she would soon be penniless had prompted her
to forbid Stubbs to let any of her few friends know her
whereabouts. A few days more would bring her to pen
ury. Her proud little spirit would not endure the idea
of mendicancy, even in its most agreeable forms, and
she shut herself close in the house and kept her heart
ache as her only guest.
She kept a diary and made notes of her emotions, and
she watched the mails, and was forever expecting a let
ter from Gaylord, who had gone, as he explained to her
in his farewell note, to retrieve himself and would return
to her only when he was once more a rich man.
She was convinced that he was keeping watchful care
over her when, about a month after her misfortunes, and
just when her fortune looked the blackest, an envelope
came, containing a number of bills â quite enough to keep
her in comfort for several weeks to come. She told
Stubbs about the money â she was confidential with Stubbs
âand asked him if he didn't suppose Mr. Gaylord had
caused his banker to send the money, which would ac
count for the Denver stamp mark on the envelope.
Stubbs said that was a reasonable supposition, and little
Miss Lowman was perfectly happy.
As the months went by the mysterious stipend con
tinued to come unfailingly, and Heth kept up her spirits
and made herself useful. She loved the spot where she
lived. The eagles flew over it sometimes and the moun
tains were seldom hidden. One day that which Heth
expected happened.
Stubbs hadjiot called in the morning, as usual, and
Miss Lowman, who had come to depend upon him for her
morning paper, and any small service she might wish
performed, wondered if he. were ill. She sat at the win
dow sewing lace in the neck of her little gray Sunday
frock, when she saw him coming down tne street. And,
gladness, gladness! He was not alone! Beside him
strode a gentleman in resplendent attirpâ a gentleman
with a flamboyant mustacheâ a gentleman who looked
as if he were in the habit of having men and obstacles
and even United States mail wagons get out of his way!
She flew back to her own room and sat down and
sewed some more of the lace in the neck of her frock
with an air of deadly indifference. She heard some one
bounding up the stairs three at a time â ana she still
sewed in the lace. She heard an impetuous knock at the
door, and it burst openâ Heth was just knotting a thread
âand the next thing she knew she was not in her chair
at all, or on the floor at all. butâ well, well, never mind.
"Well," said he. "Heth, I'm back!"
No one smiled. Every one seemed to think the remark
was needed.
"I'm on my feet again. I knew I would beâ with you
waiting. Alaska salmon did it. I canned the tails.. Th 2
fools were throwing away as much as they cannedâ l
swear they were. I've got a cannery in the shadow of
a volcano and under the lid of a glacier and I want you
to see it."
It didn't seem surprising to anybody that Gaylord
should wish to take his bride to a salmon cannery.
"I didn't know your plight, dear child, till Stubbs told
meâ heavens! if I had known it, I'd have been home quick
enough." *
"But if you didn't know about ray misfortunes." said
she suddenly, "how was it that -you sent me that money
every month? But for you I should have been a beggar
and I know I should have broken my heart."
"Money." said Gaylord, "money!"
Stubbs was making for the door.
"Come back here, you rascal," cried Gaylord. "Turn
around, sir."
Stubbs' face was scarlet.
"Look at that, my dear, will you." cried Gaylord,
"look at that! Guilt painted on every feature! See that,
my dear!"
Heth got up and slipped her hand in Stubbs 1 big paw.
"I hope you will never have to be parted fr,omâ from
Mr. Gaylordâ andâ and me," said she.
Gaylord was mopping his blue eyes. "Stubbs," he
said, "Iâ"
"Don't mention It sir. if you please. My fathers have
been gentlemen's men for five generations, sir. and it
would be queer if I didn't understand a gentleman's feel
ings, sir, and know what he would want do/ie under cer
tain circumstances."
"How," cried Gaylor, throwing up his hand, "can I
even live up to Stubbs!" ELLA W. PEATTIE.

FROM A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN 15 YEARS AGO, WHEN WILSON FIRST SAW HER.
that he was urged to prolong it a week
or two.
Among the several children in the
Deuchler household was Emma, a lit
tle, black-eyed, jolly child, who had
just passed her sixth year. She was by
long odds the beauty of the family. She
took the visitor by the hand and led
him about the yard. She triumphantly
showed him her pet dog, her cats, kit
tens and rabbits; recited "Mother
Goose" rhymes by the dozen and
climbed upon his back in play.
The young man was attracted to the
child from the first, and as the days
passed and he saw her perennial good
nature, her cunning, affectionate ways
and looked into her big black eyes, his
soul was struggling with his reason ere
he knew it. Little Emma had graduated
from the kindergarten at that time.
John helped her in her lessons for
school. He taught her the intricacies
of such mathematical problems as add
ing two and five. He guided her
through the mazes of spelling words
of two syllables. Nothing like this ex
perience had ever come into his life
before.
The rest of the Deuchler family gave
no more than passing heed to their
young-man visitor's liking for the lisp
ing child's company. They attributed
it to a general fondness of the visitor
for any vivacious child. "The fact is,"
said Mr. Wilson, the other day, in
speaking of that first visit to the
Deuchler home, "I fell in love with
hands still or sit quietly for any length
of time, liable to nervous disturbances,
vivacious, but liable to great extremes,
lovers of knowledge, and usually fluent
speakers.
From June 21 to July 22, the sign of
Cancer, which makes great lovers of
home arid family, kind and loving in all
the home relations, will lab<?r indefati
gably to care for family, but extremely
sensitive to the mental and physical
conditions of those around them.
From July 22 to August 22 is the sign
of Leo, or the heart, and gives a great
variety of inclinations; they are easily
led, but lack natural policy, and con
sequently get into many difficulties.
Frc-m August 22 until September 23,
the sign of Virgo, gives a fine and dis
criminating mind, but makes them pe
culiar and notional about their food,
their eyes keen and discriminating,
making excellent proof-readers, fond of
harmony, discord will affect their ap
petite, cannot bear pain, have great
rallying power and also have a strong
tendency toward selfishness.

In a fortnight young Wilson's visit
came to an end. Before he had turned
his face toward his Southern Califor
nia home he got a promise from little
Emma to print him a few words of a
letter at least once in every two weeks.
He in turn agreed to write her a pleas
ant message once a week and to send
her remembrances from California. The
Deuchler parents thought it very g-ood
of the son of their old-time friends, the
San Diego Wilsons, to take such an in
terest in their little child, and Mrs.
Deuchler was especially pleased at the
epistolary interest John took in seven
year-old Emma.
From that time until a month ago
a correspondence was continued be

There are hundreds of letters in that
collection from Emma Deuchler as a
girl in her teens, who at that time
thought it great fun to write to a
young man. and more especially to get
letters from him. There are also
bunches of letters (tied with ribbons
and jealously guarded) in this uncom

Emma, who then realized that there
is a heart in California, which has
been beating for longer than a decade

A FISH THAT_ WALKS.
THE Zoological Gardens in London
have acquired n<> less than seven
walking fish or mud skippers.
The mud skipper is a large fish,
which walks on land frequently. It
also climbs trees and doe? other things
equally curious. A well-Frown speci
men weighs from forty to fifty pounds.
It has a head something like that of a
mastiff, the resemblance being very
striking about the lower jaw. The
scientific name of the mud skipper is
Periopthalmus.
The mud skipper walks principally
by means of its pectoral fins and its
tail. It gets along exceedingly well. It
is fairly common along the shores of
the Indo-Pacific Ocean â that is to say,
in Southeastern Asia. In Siam plenty
of mud skippers are to be found.
The most remarkable accomplish
ment of the mud skipper is to climb
trees. With its pectoral fins it catches
hold of a tree trunk as firmly as if it
had hands. It goes up into thp tree in
search of insects, sunshine and fresh
air.
The mud skipper has a loud, hoarse
voice.

to the little girl. No Argonaut ever
hunted the Golden Fleece with more
restless zeal. No fabled story of an
cient lovers tells a more fervent waging
of a suit than this has been. For four
years Wilson was a clerk in a San
Diego store, then a traveling salesman
for a wholesale dry goods house in St.
Louis. He went to England one year
to straighten his father's estate. He
was in Honolulu when the Queen was
deposed, and he was a real estate agent
in the boom in Seattle in 1889.
But notwithstanding where he has
been, no matter what the attractions
for him and the demands upon his
time, he has always written to his girl
love at least once in ten days â more
often twice a week. His parents left
him an agreeably large estate four
years ago. Two years ago he bought
ranch property in San Bernardino
County, and he has made it very at
tractive and fruitful.
For six years this rarely devoted
lover kept his love for little Emma
Deuchler in his heart. As the years
passed his ambition to make her his
bride grew firmer. His parents and rela
tives could not understand him, and he
was set down by all who knew him
well as a confirmed bachelor and an
irreconcilable, constitutional â woman
hater at 26. They knew he wrote often
to a prattling tot in Texas, and sent
her pretty presents with marked regu
larity, but that was ascribed to a fond
ness for a jolly, cute child and a lik
ing for his father's old Texas friends.
COSTS OUR CITY $25 EVERY TIME THE
FIRE ALARM BELL RINGS.
NEW YORK claims that every
alarm of fire, of which there is
an average of eighteen daily,
false and actual, costs $545. This
Bam is just $345 in excess of
what London pays for the same
inestimably valuable modern conveni
ence of learning where fires are, and
having them extinguished.
In Greater New York, with its five
boroughs, there was during the past
fiscal year 6463 alarms, and the entire
cost of maintaining the fire department
was $3,510,000. The fire department of
Boston spent during the same time I
$1.135.000, that of Philadelphia $913,190 32
and that of San Francisco only $626,
000. While London, with an average
of ten fires each twenty-four hours,
allows her fire department only $750,000
for twelve months' expenses.
In arriving at the cost, as stated, for
each fire alarm, the New York method
of procedure is simply to divide the en
tire expense of the department by the j
number of alarms sent in during the !
given time. This way of presenting
the matter is. however, decidedly un
fair and is certain to give an additional
terror to the sounds of the fire bells J
and whistles as they clang and shriek
into the taxpayers' ears.
The absurdity of such, reckoning is
self-evident, since the conclusion at
which a mathematical mind must ar
rive is that the greater the number of
fires the less is the expense which is
entailed upon the city, whereas the reg
ular expenses of an organized depart
ment are the same whether fires be |
frequent or infrequent, and the alarms j
themselves cost just what extra out
lay is required to answer them, fight
Young Wilson visited his friends, the
Deuchlers, two or three times a year at
first.
In one of his visits ther along about
1890, he could not longer keep his burn
ing, enthralling love secret. He sat up
late one night with Mr. and Mrs.
Deuchler and told into their astonished
ears the story of his consuming passion
and his ambition to some day make the
little Emma (then fast asleep in child
ish dreams with her sisters upstairs)
his wife. When at length the mother
recovered her speech and reason she
laughed at the idea of such a strange
infatuation. In vain she argued the
wide disparity in the ages of ncr little
girl and the young man lover.
Both father and mother pitied the
honest, faithful lover as they tried to
show how very possible it would be for
the girl; as she grew to womanhood, to
have no reciprocation of nis sentiment
for her and how unsuited she might be
to him at a marriageable age. The pa
rents and the visitor talked in this vein
till early morning. The lover remained
as persistent as ever.
Several years ago Mr. Deuchler failed
in business in Waco and he and his
family moved to El Paso. Wilson vis
ited the family more frequently. He
was pledged, however, never to speak
of his love to the girlish Emma until
after she had reached her eighteenth
birthday. He Kept the pledge sacredly,
althougl as he admits, it required
more determination than anything he
ever experienced.
fires when fires occur and repair dam
aged apparatus.
Computing the cost according to the
New York method, San Francisco,
whose allowance for her firemen is far
less than that of any of the other large
cities, with the exception of London,
where the firemen are very poorly paid
and poorly cared for, paid $654 for each
of her fire alarms last year. This fact,
however, is a cause for self-congratu
lation on the part of her citizens, since
it shows that there were only 957
alarms during that entire period.
The actual average cost of each of
these alarms, that is the additional ex
pense to which they put the depart
ment, was just $24 90, so no San Fran
ciscan need shudder when bells and
whistles sound, save at the thought of
the danger, if the alarm be a genuine
one, into which brave men rush, with
out thought of anything but their duty,
at that call.
The entire force employed by the
London fire department comprises only
1000 men, whose wages are about half
the average paid to regular fire-fighters
in our large cities. New York has 1700
paid men on her roll, Boston 800 and San
Francisco 564. this list including both
uniformed and ununiformed men.
The Boston department, the special
pride of that city, has a drill school
where new members serve thirty days
and go through all that a fireman has
to go through, with the exception of
actual fire and smoke. Fire fighting is
a lif 3 profession with Boston firemen
after they pass the severe ordeal of the
drill school and serve six months on
probation. The salaries paid are good,
being $1000. $1100 and $1200 for hose and
truck men, $1500 for captains and $1450
for engineers. Philadelphia pays $100
yearly more to her hose and truck men,
$60 less to her captains and $70 less to
honors has no Knotty muscles stanaing

Two years ago last July, he, for the
first time after his unique courtship
of barely twelve years, revealed his
heart to the young woman. How far
she was prepared for information â¢no
one will ever know.
Then there was a year of waiting for
the young woman to come to a decis
ion. Meanwhile her devoted and vigi
lant suitor was more active than ever.
When a decision had been reached Mrs.
Deuchler suddenly died, and Miss
Emma could not leave her father's
lonely home for another year. The date
of the marriage was finally settled
upon. Mr. Wilson at once employed a
force of carpenters, decorators and fur
nishers to make his ranch home ready
for the coming of his bride, and he
went about as one in a daze of bliss
at the approach of the goal of his
long ambition.
All was ready by the 23d of last
month. Meanwhile Mr. Wilson went
to El Paso.
There, three days later, the first
chapter in an extraordinarily real love
story closed. After fourteen years of
ceaseless devotion to gain a human
heart, fourteen years of consuming
love, formed for a mere child at play
among her dolls and unfalteringly con
tinued through childhood, youth and
into young womanhood, was beauti
fully crowned.
The couple went upon a wedding tour
to St. Louis, thence to San Francisco,
thence to Coronado, and thence to their
home in this locality.

pays her engineers more money and her
other, men a little less.
Boston has forty-five engine compa
nies, including two double companies',
two fire boats, seventeen ladder compa
nies, twelve chemical engines, two wa
ter towers, one independent hose com
pany, two combination wagons and two
combination ladder companies, and San
Francisco's equipment consists of thir
ty-four engine companies, six chemical
engines, seven truck companies, one
water tower and two, monitor batteries.
Compared with other cities, our pro
portion of the $112,500,000 yearly lost by
fire in the United States is very small,
and we have the lowest death rate
among our firemen. Had we a fully
paid fire department, instead of de
pending, as we do, for a great part of
the actual work done at fires upon "ex
tra" men, who, receiving only $35"
monthly, are allowed to employ them
selves in other ways provided they obey
fire-calls with all possible alacrity, it
would be of great advantage to our
residents and property owners. The
extra expense would be more than com
pensated for by the greater efficiency
of well-drilled and always "ready"
men.
As matters are now arranged, we

I a business of giving their entire time

other one word, intimates a prophecy of i
another revolution and a new social or
der yet to be.
All the world reads with interest of
Paris; or if any one here or there is so
sated and staled by the frequent repeti
tion of its story as to turn aside indif
ferently from a book bearing as a title
that magic name the nagging interest
would be revived and the jaded curiosity
be roused again by seeing upon the vol
ume inscribed as author the name of
Zola, To-day the name of the man is
almost as famous as the name of the city.
Whenever in intelligent circles either is
mentioned the other is soon heard. Each
name serves contending parties as a
battle-cry in the conflicting opinions .of
the time. Each has strong friends and
bitter enemies. Few men regard either
with indifference.
For these reasons "Paris, by Emile j
Zola," is destined to be the subject of as |
fierce a controversy as has ever been i
waged in the annals of literature, anu an I
excellent translation into English by j
Ernest A. Vizetelly just published in two j
volumes by the Macmillan Company of I
London and New Yurk, will give to Brit- ;
ish and American ulers and critics a \
fair cause and opportunity to take part
In the conflict with as much keenness as j
the French themselves. The work is for j
saie in this cuy by all booksellers, and j
San Francisco, therefore, is as well sit
uated to share in the fray as any other i
community.
The work is the culmination of the most
ambitious literary effort of our time. In
the trilogy of the three cities, Lourdes,
Borne and Paris, Zola has attempted to
accomplish much more than the narra
tion of interesting incidents, the delinea
tion of striking characters, the picturing
of the manners and morals of the time,
and the portrayal of the emotions and
passions of men involved in the meshes of
chance and circumstance, lured_by for
tune and confronted by fate. Al^of these
things have a place in the drama un
folded in the trilogy, but they are but
accessories to the central theme, which
is no less than the struggle of humanity
toward a new birth through which it
ehall attain a clearer perception of truth
than has ever yet been taught in church
or temple, by sage, prophet or priest
Since the world began.
Paris as depicted in this work is very
different from the Paris of popular con
ception, of fashionable novels or of guide
books. It is even different from the Paris
of the earlier novels of Zola himself. It
is not simply a splendid capital where
luxury and misery crowd together, where
tragedies and comedies mingle incessant
ly, where pleasure-seekers from the four
Quarters of the earth assemble to vie with
one another in extravagance, where our
civilization has blossomed into its most
voluptuous rose and bears it sharpest
thorn. It is as Zola himself describes it,
"A huge vat in which a world fermented,
Bomething of the best and something of
the worst, a frightful mixture such as
Borceresses might have used; precious
powders mingled with filth, from all of

HAT is heaven like? Fervid eloquence, in

1 /of pulpits, during the Christian centuries
VJw has been employed to describe the unseen
glories of the blessed place or condition.
Wise men have differed as to whether
heaven is a place or a condition. Belief
differs still concerning that. Faith and hope alike
lead all worshipers of the unseen God to look for
ward to a life of bliss beyc-nd the grave as a reward
Tor good deeds done in the flesh. The following opin
ions are in line with that view, but at the same time
there is a wide divergence of opinion on the question:
What is your idea of heaven?
â¢ â¢ â¢
The doctrine of heaven is so inextricably con
nected with pagan fancies and unreal and impossible
Munitions that there Is an
lination on the part of
theologians to surrender to
the well-established fancies
- of the popular mind and to
Bpeak of heaven in terms of poetry and symbolism.
But it is this old idea that prompts Frederick Harri-
Bon to speak of heaven as a vacuous eternity, a future
of ceaseless psalmody, and who asks with fine scorn:
"Why should this great end staring at all of us along
the vista of each human life be forever a matter of
clithyrambic hypotheses anc*- evasive tropes."
To be brief and at the same time intelligible I
would say that I do not believe that heaven is the
Elyeian plains of the Greeks; nor in the green para
difro ot the Scandinavian; nor in the conventional
dream of streets of gold, and songs and harps, for
which the orthodox Christian longs. I say I do not
believe in these, but. strictly speaking, I do, and so
flo you, my reader. We all believe in the fundamental
truths of these grand old pictures painted by the
common mind, and respect, with reverent admiration,
the mighty rose of Dante, with its petals made up 01
living angels, its glorious center the very holy of
holies; in the transcendent pictures of Milton; and in
the city of the new Jerusalem, which John saw de-
Bcending out of heaven.
We always think of heaven through the ijnagina
tion. Nobody has returned to tell us what heaven is,
and I confess that we all must be agnostic, just aa
l-aul was when he said: "Now we see through a glass
darkly, but then, face to face; now we know in part,
but then we shall know even as we are known."
Heaven is not up nor down; neither here nor
there; but, in the thought of the New Testament,
Is the absence of sin. It is life, without life's agonies;
It is a temper; it may leave locality; if there is to
be a place, then this present world will probably be
that place. Heaven is harmony. It is progressive be
cause it is life; redemptive forever, because it is the
very expression of eternal love;* a condition of spirit
ual satisfaction.
Heaven is the realization of the best within us.
[t is life at its highest. Every soul makes its own
heaven; its own hell. I believe in degrees there. Some
have greater capacities than others. Heaven is time
winnowed of its limitations and imperfections. The
â¢ocial problem is the attempt to translate the dream
t>f heaven into present industrial and political con
ditions.
â¢ â¢â â â â¢
As a Christian I like to think of heaven in the
words of Christ. "In my father's house are many
mansions. I go to prepare a
place for you, and if I go I
shall come back again and
receive you unto myself."
Where heaven is I do not
know. The Bible, as far as I have studied it, does
not tell. From my reading of the old book it seems
to me it is a place of abode and not a mere condition
or existence.
Will it have pearly gates and streets of gold? I
do not know. In fact I do not care. There will be no

which was to come the filter of love and
eternal youth."
This being the conception of Paris out
of which the story and all of its philoso
phy grow, it is scarcely necessary to say
the book will not find favor with those to
whom a novel is merely a means of pass
ing with pleasure an idle hour. It is not
meant for those who desire only a pleas
ant tale or an exciting romance to amuse
them. It is a work for the study of the
serious; to be read as an illustration of
total depravity, or as a prophecy of the
speedy coming of the dawn ot a brighter
day." It is a challenge to every form of
conventional religion, to the Church of
Rome and to the whole scheme and dog
ma <>f Christianity.
The keynote of the book is a denuncia
tion of religion founded on charity and a
demand for a religion founded on justice.
The hero whose experiences and intellec
tual development constitute the continu
ity of the plot throughout the trilogy,
sought first for satisfaction for his aspi
rations at Lourdes. but found there only
the glorification of mysticism and renun
ciation of reason. He turned to Rome to
see if the faith and ardor of primitive
Christianity could be renewed by the
church, but found there what Zola calls
"the rotted" trunk of a tree that could
never put forth another spring time." He
went at last to Paris and sought consola
tion in works of charity, only to find that
charity itself is a blunder, that the reli
gion founded on it has become bankrupt.
and that alms can never cure the suffer
ing of mankind.
The story opens with Froment serving
in one of the churches of Paris as an un
believing priest, convinced of the useless
ness of all his efforts to help others to
ward salvation. He goes forth on a mis
sion of charity, and straightway the nar
rative plunges into the slums and miser
ies of Paris. From the wretched tene
ments where poverty dies of hunger, and
enforced idleness breeds the mad spirit
of anarchy, he goes to certain rich phil
anthropists to seek aid for a starving
man. Here he enters into the stream of
corruption which wealth breeds, and
comes into contact with one of the lead
ing characters of the story, Baron Du
villard, who "rotted and devoured, cor
rupted and swallowed everything he
touched, and was also the tempter per
sonifiedâthe man who bought all con
sciences that were for sale."
In this circle of the aristocracy of
' wealth he finds many patrons of ehari
i table Institutions, but not one to help the
i dying wretch in whom for the moment he
is particularly interested. He turns from
them to the statesmen of the time and a
striking chapter of the story describes a
I scene in the Chamber of Deputies when a
j scandal breaks out over the bribery re
j sorted to by Duvillard to carry through
a great railway scheme. Among the
characters introduced in this scene are
many which can be recognized even by
American readers as portraits of well
known politicians and journalists.
Froment fails in this circle as in the
former one and is led to a visit to the
: residence of "Sylvaine," the mistress of
Duvillard, a woman of "virginal coun
tenance," with aspirations for success on
the stage; a character which can be read
ily recognized as that of a Parisian cele
brity recently in this country. Here also
tie fails. No help is forthcoming. The
: starving workingman dies in his garret.
His friend Salvat, who also is destitute
and starving, goes forth desperate Into the
streets of Paris with a bomb made of
a powerful explosive he has stolen from
trouble there. That is evidently the meaning of
Christ when he says just before the worcs we have
quotedâ "Let not your heart be troubled." I for one
will be pleased with the furniture of heaven, what
ever it is, and with the locality of heaven, wherever it
is, if there is no trouble in it.
To me heaven is the vision of Christ. "We shall
be like him, for we shall see him as he is." He will
be there and to know him perfectly and see him with
out any veil of doubt between will be heaven.

an innocent working girl.
From this point the story moves slowly
forward through a maze of philosophical

is worth noting as an evidence that the
book is fln de siecle that the lovers make
the trip to the forest on bicycles. More

and with sincere hearts the light comes at
last, and with it peace and work and
love. The contrast between these earnest
souls and those of the mad anarchists,
the profligate rich, the lying journalists,
the self-seeking statesmen, the devouring
courtesans, the almost equally vicious
women of the circles where money rules
and licentiousness affords the chief
amusement of tedious lives, is vividly and
impressively brought out in a multitude
of scenes of dramatic intensity.
Through all there runs the one thought,
the one lesson. \\ ide apart as are the
different characters of the story, land
diverse as are their fortunes and their
ambitions, the unity of the drama is
never broken. The fate of Salvat, the
anarchist, is linked with the political for
tunes of the statesmen, and on them in
turn depends the outcome of Sylvaine's
desire to be admitted to the Comedie
Francaise. The life of each affects the
lives of all the others, and every incident
has a bearing on the fortunes of all.
Never has the constructive skill of Zola
been better displayed than in the man
agement of this complex drama, and if
the movement of the play were not so
hindered by the mass of didactic dis
course the story would rank as one of the
most Intense and dramatic he has ever
written.
In the closing chapter Zola sums up the
substance of his philosophy and preaches,
the moral of his tale. Out of the seeth
ing vat good is to come. What matters
all the wrongs and sins and miseries of
the time, since humanity always ad
vances. "Liberty sprang forth from the
vat to wing her flight throughout the
world. And why in her turn should not
justice spring from it?" It is by science
the revolution is to be achieved. "Now
that science has destroyed that false idea
of heaven, and shown what dupery lies
in reliance on the morrow of death, the
slave, the workman, weary of dying for
happiness' sake, demands that happiness
and justice shall find place on earth.
Therein lies the new hope. Justice after
eighteen hundred years of impotent char
ity."
This, then. Is the philosophy of Zola, the
lesson he has drawn from his life and
labor and love in Paris, and which he has
chosen to teach to the world in the form
of a study of the city from which he has
drawn so much inspiration and so much
hope. The book closes with a triumphal
burst of word music. The city glows in
the light of the declining sun. The b'eau
tlful Marie calls the attention of her hus
band to the glory of the scene: "Look,
look," she exclaimed, "Paris is all golden
covered with a harvest of gold." Zola
adds: "And Paris flaredâ Paris, which
the divine sun had sown with light, and
where in glory waved the great future
harvest of truth and justice."
So runs the philosophy, the dream, the
romance of ideas wilder than any romance
of action. And now for reality: At the
! very time this exuberant prophecy of the
coming of a better faith than Christian-
I ity and a better practice than charity.

my idea of heaven-life, death and hereafter is that it
is a state of progression, and as we leave this sphere

Heaven and hell are states of consciousness, very
near to each other. Heaven is not a place, but a con-
" â â â  dition of consciousness. Con
sciousness is of the soul or
individuality. We do not
have to lay down this soul
to reach heaven. Aspiration
and an act of the will set spiritward will lift and keep
the soul on a plane of consciousness above the dis
cordant vibrations of the lower levels of the world's
consciousness. Mankind will have to fin l God within

society has no dogmas, and
composed as it Is of persons
of all sects, classes and
- creeds it must of necessity
contain the faiths of all conceptions, varying with
their understandings. Logically a man could believe
nothing else, at a given time, than that which he un
derstands to be true. *_ ,
The Theosophical Society offers a wide field for
research, in which reason should guide, and observed
facts from the basis of understanding. Every belief
should be proved logical, unreasonable and within
the bounds of probability. In dealing with religious
questions one must not depart from the rational. :If
heaven means anything it means a state in which
freedom and happiness exist. â ' . â ;â - '
Freedom in the abstract cannot exfst where one
single desire binds. He who performs beneficial acts
in the hope of reward is not happy unless the reward
is obtained, and if the reward is obtained happiness
ends. Among the . Buddhists . the very desire for
heaven is considered a supreme selfishness. Jesus is
made to say, "do good for the love , of good," "the
kingdom of God is within." He who does not care for
heaven, but is contented where he is, is already in
heaven. The fulfillment of duties brings its own
reward. " . i

that heaven then is only a I condition, an existence,

We do not know who the author of
â 'Unchaperoned" may be. but it is to be
regretted that he or she has been let
loose on the literary market without a
guardian. Presumably the writer is R
woman and we would humbly advise her
to engage at once a cultured chaperon,
who might keep her wayward fancies
within bounds and teach her at least tli-i
elementary canons of good taste. "War
ren Hyde," not to waste adjectives upon
it, is h mawkish, pretentious volume, un
worthy of notice save to protest agrninst
its offensive motif. It is inconceivable
that a self-respecting firm of publishers
should have put its name to a story which
is so obviously, through all the windings
of its complicated plot, the product of a
diseased brain.
The second of these novels comes under
a different and more pleasing category.
It is a tale full of the warm sensuous col
oring of the South. The plot is incon
sequential, the story loosely put together,
the interest carelessly sustained, but
these faults are atoned for by vivid word
photos of character and scenery. The
idea, too, is original, embodying the trials
in the old slavery days, not of slaves or
slaveholders, but of the noor "white
trash" that stood between.
Eliza Martin, come of an overseer's
family, nearly breaks her proud heart on

has his life embittered, being falsely sus

an animal. But there is the real man, that divine
trinity, the three higher principles of the Brahmins â
the mind, soul and spirit, or the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost of our Christian Gospel. Life in the
quatenary is fleeting, transitory, changing with the
physical elements. In the higher territory . man is
immortal. A man may live sensually, physically,
mentally, morally. How he lives relates him to the
corresponding conditions of existence. Heaven is but
a higher plane of cosmos.
Man's term of bliss and the pleasures and pain of
the intermediary stage depend upon the ' quality of
life; the purpose and aim of existence. The reward
of eternal bliss would be out of all proportion for a
well spent life. Man eternally receives his merit
vow and passes on to new experiences. We learn
only through experience. The changes are continu
ous from the passive to the active, and natural as
wakefulness and sleep. Great indeed is the destiny
of man, and heaven but a resting place.

I accept the Gospel statement that "The kingdom
of heaven is within us." It is a state of the mind
- which receives truth and of y
the will which obeys It. To
bring people into the king
dom Jesus and his disciples
.l__ â _ . taught the doctrine of re
pentance. "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand." This did not refer to a particular locality
near by. but to the power of Christian truth, which
could lead them into goodness. When the Lord said
to the scribe, 'Thou art not far from the kingdom of
heaven," he alluded to the state of his mind, which
could see the truth, and of his heart, which could
love r it. . . , . m.
Paul tells us of those qualities which dlstm-j
guish this heavenly kingdom within from the king
doms of the world and of Satan. They are "righteous
ness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." So if we come
into a right state of mind and heart ass to spiritual
things, wherever we go, having heaven within and
living in its consciousness, we are in heaven.
Heaven is of the spirit and all places are heavenly
when the soul is right toward God and man. And in
the future, after the death of. the body, wherever
heavenly spirits are, there heaven is, for there a
sphere of love and good will follow from each to all,
and from all to each. The spirit of Christ is within
and there is no desire for anything except what will
promote the happiness of all.
Those who are in heaven, in the spiritual world,
were once men and women on this or some other
earth. We read in the Scriptures of their being fre
quently seen by the prophets and apostles. When the
heavens were opened to them they did not go away
into distant realms, but simply "looked" through some
mental change, their spiritual eyes were opened and
the realities of the spiritual world were seen by them.
This was what was called "being in the spirit." Paul
said that he was caught up into the third heaven, and
yet he did not leave % his earthly body. So there are
three particular characteristics which distinguish
the heavens into at least ; three specir I divisions, for
those who live in one of the many mansions of the
Father's house. ". , ! - :
Many of the prophets describe the scenery of the
spiritual world. Some of them heard voices. No two

"Out of the 500 letters I receive daily,"

The only American edition of her work
up to the present time was brought out
some years ago In San Francisco, largely
for private circulation. T. Fisher Unwin

"A Voyage of Consolation" is the title
of the new book by Mrs. E. C. Cotes (Sara

this book Mrs. Cotes returns to the field
which she developed with such success In

in this new book, and their entertaining
experiences on the Continent are set forth
with unfailing good spirits and an apt
appreciation of the picturesque and

The text is admirably supplemented with

THERE are two kinds of explo
sivesâlow and high. Lieutenant
Edward Simpson, U. S. N., who
is an authority, writes that the
term explosive is one applied to
those substances, solid or liquid,
â which upon the application of
heat or shock are converted either by
combustion or decomposition into gases
having many times the volume of the
original substance. A low explosive,
like gunpowder, is one which can be
exploded by ignition. Further, the rate
of this combustion can be regulated
by mechanical treatment. Thus, black
gunpowder eoes off quickly, like a flash,
whereas brown gunpowder burns as
Blowly as punk. Gunpowder is a me
chanical mixture, as are all low ex
plosives; but high explosives, with
which this article has to deal, are
chemical compounds.
Gunpowder is the best known repre
sentative of the former, nitro-glycerine
of the latter. High explosives are used
where shattering and rending effects
are to be produced, and they can be made
to explode only by wtat is called deto
nation â that is, by so^suddenly shock-
Ing or heating the surrounding high
explosive that the mass is instantly
chemically changed into gases many
times greater than the original volume
Of the explosive, and this gas in its
efforts to escape rips, tears, destroys,
annihilates anything and everything
around or about it. The havoc it can
work is terrific and irresistible.
A great many kinds of high explo
sives have been compounded; in all
those used for commercial purposes ni
tre-glycerine furnished the active prin
ciple. Is'itro glycerine is formed by the
action of concentrated nitric acid upon
glycerine. It is a colorless, oily liquid
having a pungent aromatic taste. It
produces a violent temporary head
ache if taken into the human system,
either by placing a drop upon the
tongue or on the skin, but when per
sons habitually handle it they lose their
Eusceptibiiity to this actic-n.
At a temperature of 40 degrees Fah
renheit nitro glycerine freezes to a
â¢white crystalline mass, and it is usu
ally kept in this condition until ready
to be used; it can be thus transported
easily and safely. In its liquid form
it is dangerous to handle in any way.
To bring it from its frozen state into
the liquid form, the cans containing it
are placed in hot water of a tempera
ture of 100 degrees. The point of tiring
is 356 degrees.
Nitro glycerine is the most powerful
explosive agent in use; it can be fired
by a fuse charged with fulminate of
mercury. However, nitro glycerine in
its pure state is rarely used for explo
sive purposes, principally because of its
dangerous nature. Three essentials are
required in a high explosive, strength
or disruptive power, safety in handling,
and keeping qualities, and in their ef
forts to secure these many scientists
have brought out different explosives.
Dynamite, perhaps, is the name most
familiar to people: it has become to a
great extent generic, and means a high
explosive without consideration of the
Ingredients of which the compound may
be manufactured. Dynamite, the gen
uine article to which the name was first
given and by which in the army and
navy it is still called, is a preparation
made by mixing nitro glycerine with a
natural'silicious earth called kieselguhr.
or rotten stone, from which the water
and organic substances have been
driven out. The proportion of the mix
ture is 75 per cent of nitro glycerine
and 25 of rotten stone. The resulting
compound Is soft, of a pale brown col
or, in general appearance and consist
ency not unlike damp brown sugar.
The rotten stone in dynamite proper
Is replaced in other high explosives by
some other substance which inventors
claim adds certain specific qualities to
the resultant. This absorbent is called
c dope. It is this employment of this
dope that renders dynamite safer . to

THAT "Uncle Sam" is rich enough
to give all a "farm" has been true
from the earliest history of the
Government, but his landed pos
sessions have grown comparatively
small, and that which is left is
mftiv arid or mountainous. How these
handle and less liable to explosion from
shock than is the case with pure nitro
glycerine. Dynamite freezes at 40 drg.
It is always frozen for transportation;
it explodes at 360 deg. To thaw it is
dangerous, unless done with the great
est care. Ninety-five per cent of ihe
accidents in mines due to explosions of
dynamite have been owing to the care
lessness nf thawing. In blasting dyna
mite is very extensively used, though
generally it goes under the name of
powder. For submarine mines, planted
in a channel to obstruct the fairway,
dynamite is extensively used. It is
put up io copper spheres or cylinders,
which are anchored so as to float ten
or twelve feet below the surface, or
still lower; to these are connected elec
tric fuses, operated by an electric cir
cuit from the shore. Pressing a key
will cause the fuse to detonate the
dynamite and the explosion follows.
Gun cotton, however, is more exten
sively used for military purposes than
any other form of high explosive. It
is produced by the action of concen
trated nitric acid on cotton or cellu
lose. After compression the white
cakes resulting look very much like
ordinary hard-pressed cotton, white
and hard. Gun cotton is unaffected by
water. This is one of its most valuable
properties and one which makes gun
cotton so valuable for use on board
ships in torpedoes, or wherever under
water explosives are needed. Dry loose
gun cotton is harmless; if burned it
flashes off. Dry compressed gun cotton
burns rapidly but quickly if uncon
flned, and moist gun cotton does the
same. Wet gun cotton cannot be ex
ploded except by certain kinds of deto
natorsâit may be treated without dan
ger; it may be even forced into or
placed in a shell and shot out of a gun,
yet it still remains intact. These are
most important characteristics of wet
gun cotton. You might have maga
zines full of it, instead of one or two
torpedo heads, yet fire on board ship
or a shot from an enemy or an explo
sion from within or without will not
detonate this wet gun cotton. Gun cot
ton is always stored and used wet. Dis
tilled water is used to wet it and keep
it wet; in this condition it is the safest
explosive known. In one of the naval
intelligence publications it is stated
that the English Government tested
the safety of gun cotton containing 30
per cent "moisture by burning bonfires
in two lots of a ton each. In one case
the explosive was in disks in a closed
tank, and in the other it was divided
among eighty closed packages. In both
cases the gun cotton burned away
without explosion.
In order to explode moist gun cotton
a special kind of primer or detonator
must be used, consisting of a disk of
dry gun cotton, and this dry gun cotton
is exploded by a fulminate of mercury
fuse fired by electricity. These disks
of gun cotton may be made any size.
Usually they are about four inches in
diameter and an inch thick, with a hole
in the center. Several disks of wet gun
cotton are placed one over the other;
near the top is put one layer or disk of
dry cotton, then the electric primer is
lowered into the charge through the
hole, and the entire cartridge is care
fully sealed up with a water-tight head
through which the electric wires lead,
which are to be spliced to the wires
leading to the firing battery. It is of
the utmost importance to keep this dry
gun cotton dry. Should it get wet the
fuse would be inoperative. When gun
cotton is used to charge the war heads
of torpedoes, the gu.. cotton is usually
molded to fit the form of the chamber
designed to hold it.
Guncotton is not so extensively used
for commercial submarine operations
as some of the nitro glycerine com
pounds, mainly because of the diffi
culty of preparing it fdr firing. Nor is
it so terrible in its explosive action as
some of them. A form of gelatine
seems to be more generally preferred.
One of these now on the market is
called Repauno gelatine. It is described
as a high explosive powder, having a
gelatinous consistency. It is. therefore,
sticky and very dense or heavy â two

lands can be best utilized for the benefit

classes of -work. The higher grades
have extraordinary disruptive power.
It is decidedly plastic. This, with its
density, renders it particularly suitable
for submarine work, where the flow of
water is strong, because it will adhere
firmly together even should the cov
erings of the charges get damaged or
removed, and it is not disintegrated
by water.
Another high explosive in our mar
ket is forcite. It closely resembles ex
plosive gelatine cellulose, being used in
stead of nitro-cellulose. Some forcite
contains 95 per cent of nitro-glycerine,
and other grades less, incorporated
with a mixture of nitrate of soda, sul
phur and wood tar, with a little wood
pulp added. It burns in the open air,
explodes in confined places, and water
has no action on it.
There are many other explosives suit
able for submarine use, some of them
of a greater explosive strength than
dynamite, others less. Some years ago
General Abbot of ,the United States
army, carefully investigated the prop
erties of several kinds of high ex
plosives and gave as the result of his
experiments the following relative
strengths under water of certain ones
of them per pound, assuming dyna
mite Xo. 1, that described above, as 100:
Blasting gelatine, 142; forcite gelatine,
133; gun cotton, wet, 87; nitro glycerine,
81; gunpowder. 20 to 50. There was
some other interesting data reported
by General Abbot concerning high ex
plosives. His experiments led him to
believe that in order to wound the bot
tom of a man-of-war of 9000 tons, ar
mored with nine inches of iron, an ex
plosive must produce a pressure of 5500
pounds per square inch; that 6500
would be fatal to an ordinary double
bottomed ironclad. However, all scien
tific investigators in this direction, as
well as in other theoretical matters
pertaining to the force which high ex
piosives exert, are not by any means in
agreement. Referring to some of the
results of the researches of Colonel
Bucknill of England, into the relative
strengths of high explosives, it is no
ticed that he gives the following rela
tive horizontal distances and charges
necessary to inflict a fatal blow on a
modern ironclad:

Guncotton 107 2a 1 820 <toÂ«
Gunpowder 428 1034 2100 2610
But it should be remembered that
these results are largely speculative, and
may be very much influenced by the
disposition of weights and internal ar
rangements of the vessel. Thus in
some Jtalian experiments with a model
of a ship with a triple bottom seventy
five pounds of guncotton exploded in
contact broke through two of them,
and when the space between the two
inner ones was filled with coal, only the
outer bottom was injured.
Comparing dynamite with guncotton.
the two explosives with which we are
most familiar, it may be said that dy
namite loses strength by the evapora
tion of the nitro glycerine. Pure gun
cotton, whether wet or dry, is unaf
fected by changes of temperature. Gun
cotton, as well as forcite and gelatine
dynamite, are unaffected by water, but
dynamite loses 6 per cent of Its power
when drowned in water. Nitro glycer
ine is insoluble in water, so that most
of the compounds are uninjured by be
ing submerged. With regard to safety
in handling and transportation, dyna
mite and nitro glycerine are the most
sensitive. They should not be ex
posed to a tropical sun. Guncotton is
more liable to detonation by influence
when dry than when wet, and dynamite
when compressed than when loose.
Buoyant mines when planted, if filled
with F.OO pounds of blasting gelatine,
need to be spaced every 456 feet; gun
cotton mines require 321 feet, while
gunpowder requires 100 feet.
Summing upâ and here we are quot
ing from Lieutenant Simpson â we find
blasting gelatine and guncotton as the
two explosives best fulfilling all the re
quirements, and they tire the ones
generally in use for submarine work.
Blasting gelatine shows a superiority
with regard to strength, shattering ef
fects, plasticity and specific gravity,
but guncotton. from its stability, safe
ty and capability of exerting its full
force even when confined simply in a
net, combined with its high standing
in the other requirements, all tend to
make it the best explosive for naval
use.

FOR MAINTAINING THE WELL-TO-DO INSANE.
MANNER IX WHICH PATIENTS ARE EXAMINED AND SENT TO THE SEVERAL ASYLUMS AND THE VARIOUS
CAUSES THAT BRING ABOUT TIxEIR COMMITMENT.
IN one of the coldest and barest
rooms of that very dreary build
ing, the City Hall, there is a little
gathering every morning, and a pa
tient, or it may be perhaps two or
three, is added to the melancholy
assemblage erf human wrecks which
populates our State Asylums for the
Insane.
In this enlightened age, when indi
vidual liberty is safeguarded by every
possible precaution, it takes a great
deal of writing and a great deal of offi
cial questioning to make a man a luna
tic. There are fmr examining doctors,
who act in pairs each alternate month,
and it is their duty to ascertain wheth
er the patients brought before them
from the Receiving Hospital or the po
lice station are really sound or un
sound in their minds.
"Whatever people may say," re
marked the doctor, "we take every pos
sible precaution against any sane per
son being railroaded into an asylum.
Wait and see for yours.-lf."
The examination was certainly elab
orate enough. Presently the patient, a
haggard-looking, grizzly-haired Italian,
was brought in. He was clad in the
traditional rough blue garb of his class,
and his tangled locks had failed to re
cover from the effect of submersion in
the bay. But two or three days ago
he demonstrated his insanity, from the
police point of view, by jumping over
bc-ard from one of the docks. As sui
cide in this State is not a crime, he
was promptly fished out, and hung up
in the Receiving Hospital to dry.
To complicate matters the patient
could not read or write, neither could
he speak a word of English. His sis
equivalent of the Civil war debt, owed
mainly for food, clothing and ammuni
tion of its citizen soldiers. The continu
ous settlements of the thirteen original
States did not extend farther back from
the Atlantic seaboard than to the Alle

ter, who accompanied him, had little
more of our language, and it took the
doctor fully a quarter of an hour to find
out the subject's name and his place of
birth. A huge printed form was before
the examiner, and he had to fill in num
berless blanks. He had to ascertain,
for instance, the names and ages of the
patient's parents, whether they were
alive or dead, whether they or any oth
er members of the family had ever
drunk alcohol or suffered from demen
tia in any shape or form. Also, it was
necessary, by. a series of elaborate ques
tions, to contrast the patient's mental
condition with that of his brothers and
sisters, his uncles and cousins and
aunts. To do all this with a half
crazed Italian who can't speak English
is enough to send any physician to an
asylum.
After several amateur attempts at in
terpreting, the doctor gave the task up
in despair, and sent for the official in
terpreter. This personage took the
matter quite chirpily. He seemed to
know the alleged madman very well,
and saluted him with a friendly greet
ing in the most voluble Italian.
It took the interpreter exactly five
minutes to find out what the doctors
had been puzzling their heads over for
half an hour.
"The man's not mad," he said, turn
ing round; "it's dago red."
A new light broke upon the scene.
"Put out your tongue," cried the doc
tor hurriedly.
Obediently the man thrust his tongue
forth, and its color was as the color
of the tablecloth of a Latin quarter
restaurant when you spill your wine
upon it.
"A clear case of inebriosis," remark
ed the doctor, covering up his sur
prise, after the manner of the faculty,
with technical language.
Various attempts were made, with
to the thirty-first parallel on the south
stretched a territory over which the con
flicting claims of the several States ex
tend.d Here was an area of some two
hundred and fifty million acresâ rich, un-
The availability of the unoccupied lands
of the West as a means of revenue for
the States and of individual enterprise
on the part of the people had early re
ceived the attention of the Continental
Congress. Even during the stfess of
war Congress found time, in the inter
ests' of harmony, to urge the States to
cede their lands to the confederation for
disposition for the common benefit. In
dependence won at last; in 1754, Congress
moved that the same subject be again
presented to the several States." In due
course of time the States ceded their
lands to the United States and thus was
provided a nucleus for a vast Federal do
main. The Government kept its prom
ise to the States, and in less than a dozen
years, the soldiereâ the first care of the
Government-had received individual
grants, varying In extent according to
rank, from officer to private, borne were
in lieu of pay; some for merit. To heads
of families lands were sold for cash or
upon credit. Grants were made of large
tracts to organized development compa
nies upon partial cash and deferred pay
ment considerations. Thus homes were
afforded the people and revenue for the
Government. Three new republican
Statesâ Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee
were added to the Federal Union, and
others were in development for state
hood.
Two streams of commerce were now
flowing, one from the Atlantic seaboard,
one down the Mississippi. The people
were thriving. The fondest hopes of the
founders of the young republic were be
ing realized, when suddenly a little cloud
appeared. Spain denied further exercise
of the right of free navigation of the
Mississippi. President Jefferson, ever
zealous for the welfare of the people,
sent a special envoy to Paris, for France
had secured to herself Louisiana. The re
sult wns the acquisition of Louisiana for
IIS 000 000 paid to France. A territory was
added by this purchase which was nearly
one and one-half times the prior area of
the United States. The total cost of the
Tofi 000.000 acres of territory added was
something over $27,000,000. the additional
amounts being for interest on bonds and
the assumption of the payment of certain
spoliation claims. The average cost per
acre was about 3 3-5 cents. The land thus
acquired was promptly opened to settle
ment, and three more States were settled
and formed thereon in the next few
years Greater revenues swelled the na
tional treasury. Buying and selling land
appeared to be profitable, financially and
politically. . , . .
When Spain, a few years later, again
crew troublesome â this, time on the
southern borderâ she was promptly paid
15 coo 000 in bonds, to which subsequent
interest added another million, and a lit
tle item of thirty-seven or thirty-eight
million acres of land, the areas of the
Floridas was added to the public domain
in ISI9. This cost about 17 cents per acre,
the aid of the interpreter, to find out
how much wine the man had been in
the habit of drinking. He would go
out in his boat with the other fisher
men, he admitted, and of course they
had a jar of wine with them and
drank whenever they wished, using no
measures.
So it came to pass that one day
Pietro saw strange lights dancing be
fore his eyes, and then, while down on
the wharf, he had a vision of a man
struggling in the water and drowning
for want of aid. Therefore Pietro
jumped in to save him.
The support of the insane costs the
State somewhere in the neighborhood
of $600,000 a year. And the burden is
constantly growing.
Since the last census was taken the
number of insane persons supported by
the State has increased by 1400. In 1890
there were 3594 patients in the various
asylums; to-day there are 4927. They
are distributed as follows: Mendoclno,
460; Napa, 1451; Southern California,
573; Agnews, 918; Stockton, 1525.
Each patient costs the State on an
average ctf $140 per annum, so that, for
mere financial reasons, it is not desir
able to increase their number too rap
idly. On social and sanitary grounds
the objection of course is much strong
er, but still there is no reason to be se
riously alarmed at the increase.
"It is not the native-born Californians
who are going insane," said the Com
missioner, "it is the foreigners who in
flate our totals. They number more
than TO per cent."
A glance at the contribution made by
San Francisco to the insane population
of the State will illustrate this point.
During the past year 499 presumably
insane persons were brought up for ex
amination, and out of these 357 were
sent to the asylums, and 142 were dis
charged. It is noticeable that the male
but since Spain threw into the bargain
her claims in the Oregon country, the
price paid bought something more than
the Floridas. , â
In 1546 the Government quieted title to
the Oregon country definitely by treaty
with Great Britain, without any further
expense than items of extras in the diplo
matic disbursements. Here the public
i domain suffered a serious loss, because
the managers of a political campaign as
sumed to make the subject of diplomatic
correspondence a campaign promise of
"Fifty-four-forty or fight." It was found
Inconvenient to fight, iso the country had
to go back five degrees of latitude to the
forty-ninth.
To heal all wounds of war and pride
growing out of the Texas affair and war
of 1848, the sum of $15,000,000 in interest
bearing bonds was paid Mexico, and
340,000,000 acres were transferred from the
landed assets of the Mexican Republic to
those of the United States. This added
a territory about half the elze of the
Louisiana purchase of lSo3,>.nd moved
the western boundary from the summits
of the Rockies to the waters of the Pa
cific in an unbroken frontage. This, like
the Louisiana purchase, was a "snap bar
gain," costing about 4% cents per acre.
Then to soothe the woes of Texas, in
1850, the sum of $18,000,000 was paid her
for her claims to 60,000.000 acres. This
was the most expensive purchase thus
farâ a little over a quarter of a dollar per
acre, especially as the Government had
bought the land once before.
By this time sixteen new States, not
counting Vermont and Maine, had been
formed out of the public domain, not to
mention organized territories. The land
purchases of the Government were cer
tainly proving popular.
In 1853 the Government grew fastidious
and wanted the line of its southern boun
dary to run a little bit differently, so
Mexico obligingly turned over 3M00 .000
acres for that purpose, and $10,000,000 paid
the bill Fastidiousness is expensive, and
a better looking boundary line cost the
Government about 35 cents per acre.
Then came the purchase of Alaska for
$7 200,000, which was at the rate of about
2 cents per acre.
Since 1867 the Government has halted
in its purchases. No wonder. Look at
this;

It requires just a little bit of manage
ment to get over a billion acres of land
into shape for disposition: some little
financial skill to turn the revenues of the
Government to make this land to pay
its price; many persons to spread out
over these vast tracts of land, to form
new States.
Let us see what disposition has been
made of all these lands for the common
lunatics outnumbered the female by
nearly two to one, the figures being 224
male and 133 female, showing that,
whatever may be the case in other
States, California is not a place where
household worries bring about an un
sound state of mind.
But the point is the nationality of the
patients. Out of the total of 357 luna
tics, only 142 were of United States
birth. The Irish were the next highest
on the list, with a contribution of 52,
and then comes Germany, 50; England,
17; China. 16; France, 12; Italy, 8; Scot
land, 7; Sweden, 7, the balance being
made up by small contributions from
nearly every nationality under the sun.
It will thus be seen that the foreign
element among our population Is large
ly responsible for the increase in in
sane patients. Another thing is that
California has for a long time past been
the favorite dumping ground for luna
tics from all parts of the Union. Peo
ple desirous of getting rid of their
helpless relatives would ship them off
with a ticket to the Golden State, and
the Golden State of course would have
to care for them. The State Commis
sion is busily engaged in shipping back
as many of these helpless creatures as
possible to the States whence they
came. It is cheaper in the long run to
pay the lunatic's fare back to the East
than to keep him.
A curious and rather pathetic in
stance of this kind occurred the other
day. A family migrated from Massa
chusetts to Oregon, bringing with
them their aged and witless mother.
But apparently they soon got tired of
keeping the old lady, so they bought
her a second-class ticket to Spring
field, Mass.. and put her on the cars
to get there as best she could.
However, they took the precaution of
sewing a label on her dress, showing
her name and destination in bold let
ters. Probably, being thus ad
dressed, the old lady would have got
through all right, had not the unusual
bustle and jolting of the cars destroyed
what little balance of mind she had
left. Thus, when she got to Califor
nia she had to be placed in an asylum,
and arrangements have only just been
completed for sending her to her home
in the East.

have been given homesâ over 61,000,000
acres; heads of families. 55,000,000 acres;
for schools, seminaries and agricultural

roads, wagon roads, canals and telegraph
lines, SO,iKXÂ»,O*K) acres, ami ho on one might
go with a statement of numbers of acres
which grow meaningless because of their
immensity.
The Government has sought to lay out
and settle up its lands by townships.
Actual occupation and use of the land has
been the elementary condition of trans
fer of ownership to the individual. The
title conveyed Is an absolute one; no
reservation of an annual rent; no per
formance annually of an act of homage
to an overlord: no right of entry retained.
The actual tiller of the soil may become
the landlord in every sense. He is his
own overlord. He is a free man.
What wonder, then, that as fast as the
Government has acquired lands actual
and potential citizen-settlers have pushed
the surveyor forward with his compass
and chain. Why should not population
rise from 3,000,000 to seventy odd million?
Why marvel that thirteen little States
have erected a Union of fifty-one repub
lican States and Territories.
Why should not the task and reward
that follows bringing forth the riches of
a billion acres of land that range through
all forms of base and precious metals, all
vegetable wealth from the tropics to the
Arctic, suffice to keep a people too busy,
too happy for anarchy. When in one
year the yield of gold alone in a single
State of the newly purchased territory
almost equaled the total coat to the Gov
ernment of the billion acres acquired,
why should the increase in national
wealth seem so incredible. When one re
gards the generous aid given to educa
tion from the lands of the public domain,
why should the high average of enlight
enment and culture of the American peo
ple seem so exceptional. Considering the
aid given railroads and other roads, why
should not our mileage and equipment of
roads lead all other nations.
A little reflection, it is plain, must lead
to the conclusion that the material and
political growth of the United States is
due largely to the character of ita terri
torial acquisitions and Its policy of dispo
sition of newly acquired lands. The Gov-
eminent has consistently adherod to Its
original guarantee to hold the vast public
domain in trust for the common benefit
and the settlement and formation of sov
ereign States, always leaving the circum
stance of the future to determine what
the common benefit demands, and the
ability of the soil to support population to
fix the time and place of a new common
wealth. ELENOR D. PRATT.

QUEEREST FAMILY PLAT ON EARTH.
IT is doubtful whether there exists anywhere in this broad
land a parallel to the strange cemetery lot at Mayfield, Ky.,
which has been for the last ten years the hobby of "Uncle
Henry" Wuolridge, as he is known familiarly to his friends
and neighbors. Although born in 1t22. a native of Middle
Tennessee, he is vigorous in mind and has never used spec
tacles, but a physical Infirmity prevents his walking, so he is
driven each day to the cemetery in his buggy and inspects the
condition of his collection of monuments.
The term "collection" is exactly the most fitting one to ap
ply in this case. Like most true "collectors," lie began in a
email way, with a very modest family monument of Vermont
marble, to mark the lot. But this seemed to him lacking in the
personal note, and he haxl a white marble shaft Inserted into
this monument, bearing on its face a bas relief portrait of him
self on horseback. This was an improvement, but did not
eeem entirr-ly satisfactory, and he accordingly ordered a life
elze portrait statue of himself in white marble at a cost of $1000.
Having thus arranged for his own posthumous fame, he

PERHAPS one of the oddest things in all Southern Cali
fornia is a street car in Ontario, San Bernardino County.
This car is not run by electricity, steam, nor is it drawn
by a cable. Ever}' morning it can be seen standing near
-*- the depot of the Southern Pacific Railroad waiting for
the incoming train. It is long, broad, and filled with
little seats such as are found in steamcars, and a broad aisle
down the center. Two mules are harnessed to the front of the
car In comes the railroad train and off goes the car up
Euclid avenue, the principal thoroughfare of Ontario..
Euclid avenue is 200 feet wide and along the side are rows
of pepper and palm trees. Directly in the center of the street
is the cartrack. On each side is a broad strip of green
bounded by a row of trees. This avenue Is seven miles long
and it is a* true grade. The altitude at the head of the avenue
is 1400 feet above the foot of the avenue.

HOW ONE ANNEXATION
SCHEME FAILED.
IT was but a short time after the
rejection by the United States
Senate of General Grant's pet
scheme to annex San Domingo for
a coaling station and a foothold in
that region that I met the Hon. Ben
Wade, then ex-United States Senator
from Ohio as he was returning to his
home from Hayti and Washington.
President Grant at that time was
bending every energy of his adminis
tration to accomplish the purchase of
a harbor in. Hayti. The papers were as
full of San Domingo and its acquisition
then as they are now of Cuba and
Spain.
After an almost interminable discus
sion in the Senate a commission was
agreed upon to go to San Domingo to
examine and report upon the proposed
purchase. Ex-Senator Wade was one
of this commission whose report was
favorable, and again discussion and
struggle ensued, continuing hotly for a
number of days.
"At last," said Mr. Wade, "the day
and the hour set for taking the final
vote arrived. But few Senators were
absent from their seats, and an interest
almost painful in its intensity was
manifested by all in the result. The
friends of the measure were confident
jf a majority of six, while their oppo
nents were in despair of being able to
rally any more votes than such a ma
jority would leave them.

surrounding mountain peaks, with its summit capped with
At the terminus of the road the driver pulls from under the
back of the car a square platform, places the mules upon it, re
leases the brake and away goes the car down the long, gentle
grade, moved Only by gravity, thus giving these two tired
mulefl a free ride, which they enjoy as much as any of the
nasseneers. The grown people as well as the children crowd
out upon the back platform and feed the happy, contented
mules grass and candy.
This car was so great a novelty that a representation of It
was made of oranges and sent to the World's Fair, also to the
Citrus Fair held at Los Angeles in 1894.
REMARKABLE DISCOVERY Â«
OF AN ESCAPED MURDERER
Continued from Page Seventeen.
didn't wait for a second command. Up
went my hnnds, fur I didn't know what
sort of a scrape I had tumbled into.
"The next instant I saw that one of
the men was Geigor. The other was a
much younger manâ the same whom I
had seen behind the stump at the Reg
istration Flat camp. They stood there
with guns up, one en each side of the
narrow entrance of the cave.
"Two men in such a place coultl hold
several hundred In check. But they
had no need to fear me. I was more
paralyzed than they were. Had they
exercised ordinary precautions, they
would have discovered my approach,
for from the mouth of the cave they
could command a view of all the sur
rounding country for miles.
" "Well, what dv you want here?' said
Geiger.
" 'Nothing,' I answered. 'I was look
ing around and lost my way.'
"I could see that Geiger recognized
me as the man he had seen in camp.
But he was not entirely satisfied with
my reason for no-sing around his cave.
It looked a littl" as if I had been fol
lowing him. The life sentence in prison
still hangs over him. There was a re
ward offered for his capture, which is
still good. He knew all about this; and
so there were good reasons why he
should be afraid of spies.
"I didn't like the way the two men
scrutinized me, and so I tried to s^uara
myself.
" You don't seem to remember me,
Mr. Geiger?' I said, boldly.
"The effect of .this name upon the old
man was startling. The younger man
was startled, too. So it was evident to
me that he knew all about Geiger's
record.
" 'Geiger?' said the old man, never
lowering his gun; 'why do you call me
that?'
"Then I told him of some favors I had
once done him. He smiled, and told his
chum that it was all right. He put
down his gun and came forward and
shook hands.
"Very soon I had a good chance to
look about me. The cave was quite
large, how large I don't know, but Gei
ger told me that a stream of water ran
through the back of It.
" 'So, you see, we can't be starved
out,' he said.
"From the ma'ln cave there were
smaller side caves leading off different
directions. Helper and his chum had
more guns in rocks around the walls of
the cave. Geiger did not say so: but
I am satisfied, from his remarks, that
they could 'not be starved out,' that he
has a lot of provisions stored in his
cave and ha must have ammunition in
quantity.
"I noticed also a lot of books and
papers, quite a library. The latest
newspapers were not very old. Each
man had a comfortable bed. There was
a 'Dutch oven' in the cave and other
facilities for cooking.
"Just how we fell into talking about
Geiger's past life I don't know. Ho
told me that he had never been out
of California since the affair at Sher
wood Valley. He showed me a bill
of fare from the Russ House dated
August 15, 1897. He also had a pro
gramme of 'Wang,' which he had seen
performed in a San Francisco theater.
"When I expressed surprise at these
Geiger laughed a*id said that he went
to San Francisco whenever he felt in
clined.
" 'I was in Captain Trees' office in San
Francisco one day,' he said, 'when they
were discussing the theft of some tools
belonging to "a surveying party. It
seemed queer for me to be there, but
amusing.'
"Afterward I verified this statement
by questioning men who were present
in the office when the subject of these
very stolen tools came up.
"Geiger spoke to me about his cave
announced that the hour had come for
taking the vote a Senator rose to a
question of privilege and sent a paper
to the clerk's desk to be read.
"There was the stillness of the tomb,"
continued Mr. Wade, "as every one
soon recognized the memorable lan
guage of Washington's farewell ad
dress. Not a word followed the reading,
even the presiding officer's direction to
call the roll was by a look and a mo
tion of the head. In a silence that was
oppressive the vote was taken and an
nounced. The measure had failed. Not
only had it lost Its majority of six, but
many more on the affirmative had
changed their intended ayes to noes,
and San Domingo did not become a part
of the territory of the United States.
"The prayer of the good Washington
had prevailed and we were free from
entangling alliances."
P. T. DICKINSON.
WORSE THAN BIG HATS.
There is a more intolerable nuisance
in the theater thaji the big hat. The
nuisance is the late comer. Sometimes
he is alone; he has dined heavily; he
has been late in deciding where to go;
he saunters leisurely down the aisle;
he apologizes loudly and steps care
fully on male and female feet. Or he
is one of the theater party. He and
his friends come in the full glory of
evening dress, but they come late.
There are people on the stage, but the
theater party does not see them as It
entersâ nor do those seated near them
until the party, with much ceremony,
is seated. â Boston Journal.
i companion, and said that he was want
ed in several places.
" 'They want him,' said Geiger, 'for
doing the sort of thing I got Into trou
ble for. Oh, yes, he's a chip of the
old block!' "
Mr. Bailey does not know who Gel
ger's companion is.
Geiger, he says, was well preserved
for his age, 70 years. His hair and
beard, both of which were long, were
white with age. He was dressed very
comfortably and seemed to have a high
opinion of his own cleverness in elud
ing capture for over twenty-five years.
He was well supplied with money, and
seemed to be contented with his lot.
When Bailey left him he bade him
a warm farewell. _The only promise
he extracted from his visitor was that
he should say nothing about the meet
ing or tell any one about the cave for
six months.
"By that time," said Geiger, smiling,
"I'll be fixed again Just as safely as
I have been any time during the past
twenty-five years, and none of the old
Mendocino people will be able to tum
ble on my hiding place as you have
done.
"Good by."
Mr. Bailey kept his promise and has
not tried to locate Geiger within the
six months.

Market and Jones Streets. Market and Jones Streets.THE TAILOR-MADE GIRL OF '95
p. 3 Special from New York to The Call.
HE spring girl of '98 has an en
tirely new shape.
Her tailor-made gown is cut to
ii> Ehiiw every curve of her figure.
She has given up flowing
draperies.
Full skirts and puffed sleeves are now
things of the past.
The slender woman Js in despair. It is
the plump girl who is in fashion.
Padding has become an art. Figures
are made to order to show to advantage
the gown, as well as gowns are made to
fit the figure.
The new skirt of the tailor-made gown
Is conspicuous. It bears a striking re
semblance to the pull-back skirt worn
about fifteen years ago. It requires prac
tice to walk with grace and ease when
wearing it. It is fitted this year to the
figure with the same care as the bodice.
It must fit the hips without the sugges
tion of a wrinkle, and must really cling
to the figure until the knees are reached
if it aims to be in the very latest fashion,
most elaborately trimmed, and frequent
ly is finished with a small accordion
plaited ruffle. For frequently this skirt
lining takes the place of a silk petticoat.
The tailor-made girl cannot wear petti
coats if. she wishes to be strictly up to
date this year. Petticoats tend to hide
the symmetry of the figure, and she
wishes to reveal it.
With her new tailor gown the spring
girl wearsâ what do you think?âbloom
ers. But not the baggy bloomers of the
bicycle girl. Oh, dear no; but almost
tight-fitting black satin bloomers. And
for comfort in walking there is nothing
In the world to equal them.
The young person who cannot afford to
have her bloomers made of black satin
may have them of French flannel, light
weight serge, or brilliantine. But in one
thing this year she cannot afford to be
economical if she hopes to be considered
really fashionable. She must no longer
buy cheap taffeta silk for her skirt lin
ing. Silk which rustles is no longer the
vogue. It has become too common. The
high-priced taffetas and the soft silks,
which have a delightful swish about them,
but no suggestion of rustling, are now the
proper thing for linings.
Of course it isn't every girl who will
care to adopt this new and startling
fashion of t-ie tight-fitting skirt, but no
matter how she may change it to suit
her own particular views she will make
a fatal mistake if she does not see that
her skirt fits tightly across her hips and
at least for a few inches below them.
To carry out the fashionable figure the
corsets are now made with the bust
somewhat higher than it was six months
ago. But the straight front is still in
demand.
As for the sleeve It must be clinging,
like the rest of the costume. It must fit
to show perfectly the shape of the arm.
\s a substitute for the full sleeve with
- le generous puff it is a total failure. Not
oven the women with weil-developed,
beautiful arms look upon it with favor.
And as for the thin-armed sisterhood,
they weep with one accord at even the
::t of it. The good old puffed sleeve
has surely died hard.
Besides the new sleeve being tight fit
ting, it is extremely and somewhat un
comfortably long, the pointed puff not
unfrequently reaching over the knuckles.
Even the sleeves of the new coat, which
have no fancy cuffs, are much longer
than they were last year.
When the girl with the new figure ap
pear.- on the avenue in her new tailor
made gown, she must wear a hat tilted
well over her forehead. Of course, this
[a her spring hat, and it must be of straw
â r straw and chenille combined. The fa
vorite shape turns tip abruptly at the
">ack, and is trimmed with ribbon loops to
rive a broad effect. In many of the new
-ITir.c: hats the trimming appears to be
-nassed at the back. The back view of a
-; ring hat for the season of '98 is curious
ly much more remarkable and effective
:han the front.
There are any number of novelties dis
played in the shops just now to tempt the
uilnr-made girl. There are masculine
â  â¢oking vests in plenty, some made of
Mque and others in fancy cloths, and
here are the ribbed silk and satin vests
Relow the knees the skirt flares a trifle
In order thut walking may be made a
ossibllity.
Jt is to the lfning of this skirt that ;
r:uch ot its clinging effect is due. The
ning is made separately from the skirt.
n fact, it is attached to it only at the
tvaistband, and is fitted as carefully over
the hips as the skirt proper. The bot

SONS OF RICH MEN WHO WORK
WALL, street is full of rich
men â bankers or brokers or
the owners of gTeat railroads
âwho are giving their sons
a college education and then
putting them to work. Although
every now and then you hear
though every now and then you hear
some prophet of 111 declare that pres
ent conditions tend to nurture a gen
eration of wealthy idlers and pluto
cratic non-producers, even a casual In
vestigation of the matter emphatically
dissipates the id#a.
I asked Chauncey M. Depew recently
what he thought of the necessity of ed
ucating rich men's sons to business
life. .
' There is only one side to that ques
tion," said Mr. Depew. "Every man
should educate his son to a business or
a profession, if he is fitted for either.
There are cases where a boy is not
mentally equipped for business life. I
know a young man, the son of a
wealthy father, who has been four
years in the same class at school. I
know another who has been in the
hands of a private instructor for three
rears and his tutor tells me he shows no
nental grasp.
I "When should the young man begin
' lis business career? When he has
iad a good college education. Com
<nodore Vanderbilt did not believe in
giving his son more than an academic
education. That son gave his boya
the same kind of an education; but the
â¢ourth generation is going to college,
foung Cornelius Vanderbilt graduated
from Yale. He is now taking a post
graduate course in marine engineering
â¦.here."
Dr. George F. Shrady said to me a
ew days ago: "Do you know that only
10 per cent of the men who succeed in
New York are 'to the manner born'?
Eighty-five per cent are from smaller
â¢<.uns or from the country. 'These men
â¢me to the city with all the energy
and vigor grained in outdoor life and
v, ith the determination to conquer for
tune."
Dr. Shrady does not consider this an
nidence that rich men's sons have not
an equal chance to success if they have
ambition, however, and he says that
Bt every rich man he knows is
'â ringing his sons up to work. "All
work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy," said the son of a very rich man
his father. "Yes, and all play and
â rk makes Jack a blanked fool,"
the father in reply, according to
iJr. Shrady.
Perhaps the most striking instance
!n Wall street of rich men bred to work
b in the firm of Blair & Co., where
three generations are represented, two
â â â  them actively. John I. Blair, the
head of the family, is 96 years old. H<?
spends most of his time at his home
in ijlairstown, N. J. He gave his son,
De Witt <\ Blair, a thorough educa
â¢ion and then put him at work in Wall ]
IPtreet. When De Witt's son, C. L.
had graduated, like his father, at
i'rinceton, he was put in the office to
learn the buslne^ He is now a part-
Tier at 30, and he *Â»-Â«Â« hig father are
ls steadily attentive to business as
though they -were not the heirs of one
*t the richest men In the United States.

them. Often times those vests give the
one touch of bright color to an otherwise
somber costume. Plaid vests and those
in bright scarlet are much in demand.
The newest umbrella for the spring girl
is a gay affair made either of plaid silk
or silk in bright Roman stripes. And it
has swinging from its slender natural
wood handle a tiny purse also made of
gay silk. This purse is only large enough
for car fare, but in these days when
pockets are not always where they can be
reached most easily, the umbrella is
worth buying just for the convenience of
the purse if nothing more.
There is no use in denying itâ the most
up-to-date girls are buying their stock
ings to match their umbrellas. Think of
it! If you -on't happen to believe it is
true, the clerks at the umbrella and
stocking counters have been comparing
notes, and they can certify to the abso
lute truth of this statement.
The newest stockings are all bright in
coloring. Plaids are the favorites and
HER VEST OF PLAID CLOTH.
many exquisite color combinations are
seeen. There are also many Roman
striped stockings and others showing a
novel ribbon effect. Elaborately embroid
ered insteps are also much in fashion.
The sale of silk stockings has greatly In
creased within the hist yc-ar. Now even
the bicycle stocking is a silken affair, and
has lost all its clumsiness.
In the matter of gloves, the strictly
tailor-made girl copies her brother's. But
if she happens to be just a bit frivolous
she is sure to buy this spring the new
gloves with the jeweled fastenings.
These gloves come in every color im
adnable and have imitation jeweled
studs, which are fastened together by
means of a fine silken cord. The gloves
in the different shades of tan. with violet
stitching and bits of mock amethysts for
the studs, are unusually pretty. For
dress occasions there are exquisite silvery
gray gloves with turquoise studs and sil
ver* stitching.
; Rockefeller, the Standard Oil million- I
aires, are believers in the plan of edu
cating rich men's sons to work. John
iU. Rockefeller Jr. is the only son of
John D. Rockefeller and heir to $200,
: 000,000. He is about 23 years old. He
â  is at work in his father's office, where
! he draws a small salary and saves part
! of it, just as his father did when he
was a clerk in a business office in
Cleveland. William G. Rockefeller, his
cousin, who is 28 years old, has been
in the employ of the Standard Oil
Company for several years. Both the
Rockefellers are steady, industrious
young men, and either of them could
find employment very easily if thrown
upon his own resources.
A comparatively new figure in W all
street is George Crocker, son of the
bonanza millionaire. Few of the men
who made such quick fortunes in the
gold fields saw far enough ahead to
realize the necessity of making their
chidren bread winners. Many of their
sons became dissipated, like young
Fair. Some of them have fallen into
business life because they needed oc
cupation. Mr. Crocker is one of the lat
ter. He says that the biggest obstacle
he has had to surmount all his life is
the fact that his father was a million
aire.
"You will always live in the shadow
of your father's name," said a million
aire friend of the elder Crocker to the
young man one day.
"It is true," said Mr. Crocker,
"though no one ever expressed it to me
in that way before. Whatever I do I
am always my father's son; I .have no
identity of my own."
George Westinghouse, the millionaire
inventor and manufacturer, has a son
who is too young as yet to think of the
responsibilities of life: but if he shows
a liking for the machine shop when he
grows older Mr. Westinghouse will put
him in a pair of overalls and set him
at work. Mr. Westinghouse himself
works at the bench in his private shop
in Allegheny, where he develops his
mechanical ideas.
Washington is full of idle young men
having rich fathers. Senator Stephen
B. Elkins, who has been a very busy
man all his life, has a son who is giv
ing his attention almost entirely to so
ciety. There are a great many young
men like him, whose fathers have
â  plenty of money, who are living for
amusement. George Pullman's sons
were of this type, and they learned a
spvf-re lesson when their father prac
tically disinherited them because they |
lacked business ambition. They have j
undertaken to cultivate it now, and |
both of them are working for the Pull
man Car Company in Chicago. The
stock yard millionaires are self-made
men, and they believe in bringing up
their sons to honest labor. Philip D. j
Armour has two boys. They left col- |
lege to take clerical positions in htelr |
father's office, and there they worked i
beside their father's clerks, asking no I
favors and learning the business thor
oughly by experience. Both of them
are now members of the firm, and there j
are no busier young men in Chicago.
TJavid R. Francis of St. Louis, for- j
mer Secretary of the Interior, believes
in work for the rich man's son. Mr.
Francis has seven boys, one of whom |
graduated last year from Yale. Mr. â 
Francis told me last summer that he i
was going to put the young man into i
a clerical position in his office, and let j
him learn the business. Mr. Francis ;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
Though this very severe tailor-made
young person of the spring of IS9B has
apparently -abanuoned petticoats for
street wear she shows just the same
old-time fondness for fluffy skirts when
dressing for the house. There is an end
less variety of silk petticoats, and every
one of them shows plainly the effect of
the tight-fitting cloth skirt. For all of
the new silk skirts are made to fit per
fectly over the hips, and but little full
ness is visible until the knees are reached,
and then invariably a circular flounce ap
pears. This is generally lace trimmed,
and is often so arranged that it may be
ripped from the skirt and cleaned with
but little trouble.
THIS spring's fashions will make the
lining separate from the skirt.
From experience a: skirt so made
will not keep in shape nearly as
long aa when both lining and cloth are
made together. Have It fitted as closely
and carefully as a bodice. Of course, if
nature has made you for that style, all
right. A very good finish for the bottom
is shown this springâ a brush braid. It
cannot wear out, for it is woven like very
long-pile velvet and in the shape of a
cord.
A gown intended for wearing in an
office every day, rain or shine, is a me
dium-light shave of gray. The skirt is
quite tight, having two ruffles on the un
der eide of gray shot mohair, bound at
the bottom with gray velvet. The coat
ends in a belt at "the waist; Blouse in
front and tight, without seams in the
back. The cloth collar and belt of the
same gray cloth are covered at will by
adjustable ribbons, which brighten the
dress. To wear with it a plain little
! had some hesitancy about having his
â  son go into the grain trade because of
' the uncertainties of its speculative side,
: but he had no hesitancy about making
i of him a business man and not an idler.
A great many public men have their
sons holding office under them at Wash
ington, but most of these are poor men
| to whom the second government salary
|is an object. Senator Hanna's son is
| not one of these. He was trained to a
| business life. "Vice-President Hobarfs
j boy will be a lawyer, like his father.
I Ex-Senator Henderson of Missouri had
j his son study law after he had com
pleted the collegiate course at Harvard,
and he is ready to earn a living if nec
j essary, though he has not gone into
j practice very actively yet.
On the other hatid, Senator Hale, who
married the wealthy Miss Chandler, has
had his oldest son, Chandler Hale,
made secretary of legation at Rome;
and as diplomacy is not a profession
with us, his can hardly be called a se
rious calling. Ex-Senator Brice did not
bring his son up to business life, but
the son has gone into politics in New
York lately, and promises to be an ac
tive if not a useful figure in life. His
father began his career as a school
teacher, and knows the value of labor.
General Russell A. Alger, Secretary
of War, says it is a great misfortune
for a boy to have a rich father who will
not teach him to work.
HOW MRS. SOUTHWORTH
BEGAN
HER CAREER.
UP IN Sonoma County lives an in
teresting old lady of 70, who tells
the following story of the manner
in which Mrs. E. D. E. N. South-
worth, whose works, though not
of the highest order, have perhaps en-
Joyed a wider circulation than those of
almost any other American author, first
made her appearance before the public
in literature.
The family of Mrs. Southworth's hus
band were prominent people of the lit
tle mining town of Plattville, Wis.,
which at the time of her marriage was
but a Territory, and where the narra
tor of the story then resided. The fam
ily were also religiously inclined, and
when the rumor went abroad that the
wife of the favorite son and brother
had been an actressâ in those days re
garded by people of their class as a so
cial pariahâ they not only declined re
ceiving her as one of the family, but
even insisted that young Southworth
should leave the village and not further
disgrace them by flaunting in their
very faces his devotion to his actress
wife.
He had friends, however, in the vil
lage who did not approve of the stand
taken by his Immediate family, and
those friends, partly through good will
to the young man. and partly through
anticipated enjoyment of his pompous
relatives' discomfort, advanced money
to start him in business in a small way,
and this he invested in a tinner's shop,
to the horror and disgust of his people.
The young couple took up their resi
dence in a miner's los cabin containing
gray velvet hat, trimmed in harmonizing
shades of green, tan, yellow and fancy
colored liberty silks without wings or
feathers.
Two pairs of gray gloves, made to or
der, are expected to last out the dress.
Pockets in the new tight skirts are a
difficulty, for the plaits come together in
a fan at the top, leaving no place for the
Insertion of a pocket.
A nun's pocket, however, can be used,
and for the woman who is lost without a
pocket this will be a blessing.
A double square of cambric about 14 by
6 is sewn securely to a belt to be worn
around the waist under the corset. A
reticule in the pocket opening sufficiently
large to admit the hand comfortably is
faced securely. This pocket Is worn so
that it can be reached through an open
ing left in the back of the skirt and pre
vents dragging.
In purchasing the new gay colored
hosiery beware ot the poisonous dyes.
one room, and did their cooking over a
great fireplace, as was the custom on
the frontier in those primitive, early
days.
In time Mrs. Southworth became a
great favorite with the young people
of the village, and her cabin was a re
sort for the school girls, who, attracted
by her bright, winning manners and
witty sayings, flocked about her and
considered it a privilege to assist with
or entirely take up her neglected house
hold duties for the sake of hearing her
chatter; for, as a girl once remarked of
her, "What Mrs. Southworth says
never sounds like the remarks of any
one else," and great was their regret
when the adverse influence of her hus
band's relatives finally prevailed with
him and circumstances made it neces
sary for her to leave the West.
One of these then girlish admirers,
who is still living, described the au
thoress' habit of fitting when alone be
fore the great, open fireplace, among
the neglected pots and pans of the
hearth and mechanically and inces
santly tapping her foot, as she medi
tated for hours.
The open contempt with which her
husband's relatives treated her and her
own apparent quiet submission, won
for her the sympathy of the com
munity. Whether this spurred her on
to ease her mind through the medium
of a witty and pointed article, in which
each member of the family appeared
to great disadvantage, is not known,
but such an article was penned by her.
The husband of an aggressive sister
in-law, a Mr. Roundtree. was designat
ed by the non-disguising title of Mr.
Longtree, and his little weaknesses
were so vividly depicted that even
without appellation he wa-i easily rec
ognized.
Another even more vindictive rela
If you find any green wears off or any
yellow, remember that those colors are
made by the use of arsenic and enough
may be easily absorbed through the feet
to cause poisoning. The feet perspire
more or less and so become one of the
most susceptible portions of the body.
The short French corset is worn en
tirely, and for comfort far surpasses the
old-fashioned long ones. Very good ones
come for $1.
The summer sailor hat has a straight
brim and a straight crown. If your nose
is retrousse tins will accentuate it. Get
a good hat of the straight style, take to
a man's hatter's and get him to put a
curve in the crown and also in the brim.
It will be much more becoming. If you
can, wear the hat very well forward and
just a bit to one side. To a sweet Ma
donna face this gives a most ludicrously
rakish air, but wit.* some faces it is most
charming. Stj .es will be very trying to
most women, but the stout ones will be
happy and have full revenge for the wide
skirts and short coats which have been
worn so long.
The small Bicevefl will be a delight to
stout ones, for being large already it was
a torture in a crowd to have otner people
quite "in the shadow of her sleeves."
The trimmings of every sort give the
sloping shoulder effect ami are infinitely
more artistic than the late styles.
THE EASTER GIRL WILL DRESS LIKE THIS.
tive, the symmetry of whose nose was
marred by a great wart, was given a
name suggestive of this affliction and
also placed on file with those held up
to the public eye as* person of faults
and foibles. Not one of the number
who had mercilessly persecuted her
was spared; yet the scoring was done
in such an artistic way that the allu
sions seemed almost accidental, and
gave no suggestion of malicious
thrusts.
The little town supported a weekly
paper, but the editor would never have
dared offend such powerful patrons as
the Southworths" relatives. He de
clined to publish it. A zealous friend
to whom the effusion was shown liked
it so much that on one of his trips to
Illinois he offered it to another paper,
and the article was gladly published.
It so touched the public sense of hu
mor that it was copied far and near,
and gave the indignant young wife a
proper sense of her abilities. The ed
itor of the New York Ledger was so de
lighted with the skit that he promptly
wrote to Mrs. Southworth and offered
to pay her for a story. So the young
wife started on her career as an au
thoress.
It is doubtful if any of the widely
read stories which she penned in after
years brought her a feeling of greater
satisfaction than this sketch of family
peculiarities, published in a little coun
try sheet.
A coasting steamer was wrecked near
Sydney. The captain tied life-lines to
some pigs which former part of the

thus established, every person on board
was rescued.
SHE TRAVELS WITH
A COURIER VALET
NOTION OF AN AMERICAN GIRL WHO WANTS A MAN
TO LOOK AFTER HER LUGGAGE AND MAKE HIM
SELF GENERALLY USEFUL.
MISS L. B. FREEMAN, a young
American woman, now stay
ing at the Cambridge Hotel,
in New York, has brought
to this country with her
a man servant whom she
she calls a courier - yalet, and who
is part of her establishment in
Paris, where she makes her home. The
young fellow is a sturdy German boy,
just learning to speak English, and a
being who can do more things than a
juggler and has more of the virtues
of service than any article in the ad
vertising placards of the elevated train.
Having this sort of a general all
around man of work has lifted a load
of carking care from Miss Freeman's
shoulders, who no longer has to go
through the awful crisis of seeing her
self and a person in cap and flying rib
bons left in stations while trains pull
out and porters gesticulate and the
world turns generally upside down. The
intricacies of a thousand and one things
hitherto sacred to the "maid" have
been undertaken by this amazing crea
ture of hers, until traveling his lost
its horrors, and even luggage and pass
ports and duties have ceased to per
plex.
Even that imperturbable man, the ho
tel clerk, regards this "refreshing:
change" as a boon to hotel clerks
throughout the land, should it become
a custom in this country.
It is an innovation so brand, brand
new, that Miss Freeman's friends, after
their first surprise had worn off, came
to regard it as another originality of
this delightful woman, and to take It
along with her other matter-of-fect
traits. It is the very first "man ser
vant" in a like capacity that ever came
to America, or ever was found in this
habitat, though in France and England
the custom of having such a member
of your suite is not only generally ac
cepted and uncommented upon, but it
is considered a necessity.
"And why not?" says Miss Freeman
herself, in her own inimitable, honest
inquiry.
The "why not" in most cases might
be largely a question of finances, about
which this vouiiij woman does not hava
to worry. And assuredly you will want
one of these new luxuries when you
hear all the things this "garcon" can
do â anything: in fact from blacking a
boot to buying a skein of embroidery
silk.
Miss Freeman told me some of her
reasons for this new change of hers,
somewhat reluctantly it must be ad
mitted, for she dislikes notoriety, and
expressed the most genuine surprise
that her practical plan should have
been regarded as a freak or fad.
"How did I come to have a man in
stead of the time honored maid?" said
Miss Freeman.
"That is easy enough told â he is a
better servant â men make better ser
vants in the duties that this one has to
meet than the best maids that ever
were born. Why? Well, they â or
rather, he â can buy my tickets, run my
erfands, announce my carriage at re
ceptions, and see me to and from the
theater at night. No maid could do all
this.
"Why. not long ago while in Europe
I was trying to make a train, and if it
had not been for this man I would have
lost it, for the porters and guards had
finished their work and "All al>oard!'
was the word. My boy here just threw
those trunks on and off we went. Noth
ing easier. Where is the maid who
would have been even rational at such
a point? They lose their heads, you
know, and go to pieces at a â at the
very time when you need them the
most. As I said, if it had not been for
that boy I should either have had to
stay behind or have gone without my
lugeage.
"When it comes to the comparative
virtues of man and maid, do you not
see how it is?"
As for Miss Freeman, she can get
along without a maid.
"I can do up my own hair." she said,
and she looks as if she could do other
things that would put the novel-read
ing, maid-ridden woman to shame. The
pompadour of rather heavy, dark hair
only adds to the independent spirit
that shows out of the firm blue eyes,
and one can understand just why Miss
Freeman would prefer to adjust her
own coiffure â though "men," she re
marked, "always were the best hair
dressers."
I glance at the red-cheeked young
foreigner who hands in a card just
then, and the American servant sinks
to the dust in my estimation. But then
It is Miss Freeman's estimation we
want to hear about. Just so, and the
"man maid," with foreign politeness,
bows himself out of her presence and
she can resume.
"That boy can do anything everheard
of." she continued; "black my boots,
and button them if necessary. He runs
thirty errands a day sometimes. Does
wonders for me, and he begged me to
bring him along, to see America,
"He carries no^es, announces the car
riage, as I told you, and buys me things
as I need themâ small articles, of
course. I told him I should hold him
responsible for every sou piece â he is
honesty itself, and I am the one to be
pleased, after all. if they do call this a
fad of mine. It is common sense, I say,
and â oh, I forgot, he cleans my palettes
and brushesâ that is such miserable
work for a painter to do for herself.
"In Warsaw, Poland, in France and
England they have valets," said Miss
Freeman, "and it is such a common
thing that no one ever pays any atten
tion to it and no one ever Comments
on it. It is queer how they do in this
countryâ they will go over to France
and go into all sorts of things a
Frenchman never thinks of doing or
seeing, and come back and tell how
dreadful it all is over there â and then
they never can take an innovation with
composure"
And then this "boy" of twenty or
thereabouts appears and the possibili
ties of him as errand runner and care
taker cover him with a sort of nim
bus of glory, and the American
woman's trials with her so-called ser
vants come to mind. The American
woman generally runs her own errands,
does her own little odd pieces of work,
and yet calls herself "advanced."
"Oh, but I have not told his chief
virtue," added this independent woman,
hastily. "He can mend and sew very
well â little things of course â but saves
me a great deal of troublo."
And every bachelor girl in the land
is expected to promptly faint at this
last alluring summing up of this va
let's qualities â every muddy skirted
one, especially â and when they "corrie
to" they are supposed to be seized In
the instant with undyiner envy, which
they have probably not altogether out
grown along with th^-ir snuffing off the
"yoke" in other respects.
Miss Freeman Is only visiting her
native land â she was born in New
York City â and is soon to return to
Paris and her work there.

TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS.
Some two years ago there appeared in
The Call an account of the organization
of Bands of Mercy in the various classes
of the Jefferson School. The report of
these cluba and the groat good they ac
complished in doing away with fighting
to a large extent, discouraging the abuse
of Chinamen, and abolishing cruelty to ,
animals was published far and wide, for
the Massachusetts Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals ordered
20000 copies of the article and sent them
: dcast over the country. This society
â  rganized more than 30,000 Bands of I
Mercy and caused the circulation of over
two million copies of "Black Beauty," to
cay nothing of the vast mass of its other
humane publications.
The work in our public schools, judging
from the reports of the two principals,
Miss Murphy and Miss Hart, who have I
fostered it in the Jefferson, as well as I
the result of Silas A. White's earnest
t hampionship of the cause in the Spring ,
Valley Grammar School, proves that no
where else can the seeds of kindness and!
love toward animals be sown to greater j
than in the schoolroom.
So impressed was the veteran educator,
John Swett, by this sentiment, that dur- j
ing his superintendency he caused the i
principles of the movement, together I
with the following stanza, to be incor
porated in the old course of study:
He praycth best who loveth be^t
All things, both great and small.
For the dear God, who loveth us.
He made and loveth all.
On leaving the Jefferson School, Miss
Murphy organized Bands of Mercy in the
Le Conte Primary, but was transferred
v, the Irving Scott before her plans could
be fully perfected. However, she intends
to begin the work in the latter school as
soon as possible. Hut with the exception
of these there care no city schools which
contain such societies, although we read
in the new course of study adopted last
August. "The proper treatment of dumb
animals should be regarded and an ef
made to lead pupils to be humane
and considerate. â¢ Â» â¢ Organize Bands of

Commandery Hall and the banquet hall
In Golden Gate Asylum have on many oc
casions been arranged in a most attract
ive manner, but it is doubtful if either
was ever more attractive than it was on
last Thursday night, the occasion of the
official visit by District Deputy Mrs. Dell
C. Snvage of I,ivermore to Golden Gate
Chapter. The arrangement of each, by
the willing- hands of the ladies of the
chapter, was on the suggestion of the
worthy matron. Miss Susie M. Willats. In
the east the American flag was tastefully
drooped over the. matron's chair; in front
of the station and to each side was a tall
column of evergreens which held hun
dreds of callas; at each point of the
f-tar was a tall piano lamp, the shade of
which corresponded with the color of the
point; the altar and the stations were
tastefully decorated with blossoms, and
on the organ loft balcony there was a
pretty festooning of the colors of the cen
tral star. The effect was one of the pret
tiest ever produced in that hall. In the
banquet hall there were five long tables
radiating from a common center in such
a manner as to represent the central star.
Each table representing a point was of
the color of one of the star points, and
the decoration corresponded with the
color, even to the napkins. In the center
there was a grand floral combination of
the five colors, while on each table there
wore flowers corresponding in color to the I
point on which they were placed. Then j
there was on each table a profusion of all i
the delicacies that go to make up a first
class collation. At the meeting there were
â it Past Grand Matrons Sarah Jennie
Mann, Eleanor Marie Owens, Augusta
Dunn Wilson, Past Grand Associate
Matrons Mary Sophronia Munns, Em
ma Perkins, Margret Belva Searles,
Past Grand Patron John Hatfleld Gray,
Past Grand Treasurers Mrs. Isabella Hub

Patterson, Mrs. Lulu Blanchard, district
d.puty of District No. 11, past patrons I
a,nd matrons and matrons and patrons j
from the local chapters and those in Oak- I
land and Alameda. There were present i
ahout 250 persons. There were two initia- |
ttons and the work was done in a most
satisfactory manner. The worthy matron,
Ihe conductress and the associate con
ductress were attired' In white and the
young ladies representing the five points |
were appropriately dressed in the colors
of the point each represented. The ad- i
dresses that followed the work were well
received and the banquet it is needless to
say was enjoyed.

The entertainment that was given on |

sum must have been realized. The lodges

This, together with the talks of the
teachers, is very good as far as it goes.
but. unfortunately, a book which really
belongs to the grown-ups and is not at
all suitable for text-book use was placed
in the hands of the pupils. Vor this rea
son, and because, as Mr. White expressed
it, arithmetic, grammar, etc.. have re
quired so much more attention this year,
the bands -have not been generally es
tablished In the schools, and interest in
the movement has rather flagged, which
is indeed a pity.
Some may argue that the talks given by
the teachers on kindness to animals may
serve quite the same purpose as the or
ganization of Bands of Mercy, but with
this I cannot agree. If John Smith is a
vicious boy. given to constant pummeling
and fighting, never able to look at a cat
without thinking of a stone, his teacher's
talks on the love he should have for ani
mals and his duty toward them may do
some good., but how much? On the other
hand, John Smith, sitting either as a lis
tener or as president of a Band of Mercy
on Friday afternoon, when the children
have their songs and recitations about an
imals and pets, and relate incidents of
kindness, or brutality overcome in their
own experiencesâ this John Smith. I say,
will soon prove a very different boy. That
is, judging from reports of personal ob
servation of the work among children.
That the imaginary instance cited is by
no means an unusual or extreme case of
brutality. I might call upon many teach
ers in various parts of the city to verify.
Let us then have more Bands of Mercy
In our schools.

Lodge will give another party, and on
that occasion there will be a grab bag in
Welcome Hall.
Last week thirty members of Oriental
Lodge paid a surprise visit to 1611 Turk
street, the residence of the noble grand,
Mrs. Abbie Ewing. Each visitor brought
a basket of good things, and a most
pleasant evening was spent.
At the meeting of t.ie board of trustees
of the home at Gilroy last week the ap
plications in behalf of several children fur
admission were acted on favorably.
THE N.ATIVK SONS.
Grand Marshal Dunbar officially visit
ed Sea Point Parlor at Sausalito and
Menlo Parlor at Menlo Park last week.
He found both in excellent condition
and progressive.
Stanford Parlor will hold a spirited
meeting on Tuesday, on which occasion
delegates will be selected from the very
best material to represent this influen
tial in the grand parlor.
Charles M. Cassin of Watsonville and
A. W. North of Winters will be candi
dates for grand trustee. R. D. Barton
of Sequoia Parlor wants to be grand
outside sentinel. He will have for oppo
nent L. G. Hagenkamp of Rincon
Parlor.
On the 30th California Parlor will
elect six delegates to the grand parlor.
This parlor gained $1865 in finance dur
ing the past year, and has now on hand
$14,461 and has a membership of 450.
During the past six months the parlor
afforded relief to members to the extent
of $671. The good of the order commit
tee is arranging for a grand high jinks
to be given on the 7th of Aprn.
Nevada City is making great arrange
ments for the reception of the delegates
to the grand parlor on the 25th of April.
Grand Trustee Joseph K. Hawkins
last Wednesday visited Orange Parlor;
on the following night he was with
Tracy Parlor. On Thursday he will visit
Point Arena Parlor, and on Saturday be
with Alder Glen Parlor at Fort Bragg.
The Lincoln Drill Corps has arranged
for a picnic at Sunset Park on the 17th
of April.
The Native Sons have secured a large
plat in Mount Olivet Cemetery, San Ma
teo County. In the center there will be
raised a grand monument, and an effort
is now being made to have the various
parlors secure subdivisions of the plat
and beautify the same. From sugges
tions that have been offered it is prob
able that this plat will be one of the
finest in that cemetery.
OUR NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
The entertainment that is to be given
Alta Parlor in the large hall of the
Native Sons' building on the evening of
the 15th of April will be a historical one,
and will be followed by dancing.
At the close of a recent stated meeting
of La Estrella Parlor Miss Minnie Kleve
sahl, a member of the parlor, who was
the Queen of the. Jubilee, was approached
by about forty of the members, under tne
leadership of Miss Helen M. Kruse, and
informed that one of the number (Mrs.
Lillian Carlie) had something to say to
her. What she did say, in that flow of
eloquence for wnlcu she is noted, was
that the members, in grateful apprecia
tion of the honor Miss Klevesahl had
done the parlor by the manner in which
she sustained t- part of queen, had ae
cided to prepare a banquet, at which
she was to be the queen of the evening.
A procession was then formed to Caonl
lo Hall, where there was an unusually
fine spread on a table decorated by Miss
Edith Maunder, Mrs. A. Nichols, Mrs. L.
Carlie, Miss S. Asmus and Miss L. Mc-
Carty with a profusion of violets anu of
those yellow blossoms embler.atlc of the
State. There were a number of toasts,
the principal one being to "Our Queen."
The evening was one of the most pleasant
ever spent by this parlor.
The entertainment that was recently
given by Ramona Parlor at Martinet was
a very pleasant affair, and, in ..ddition
to a very neat programme, there wu a
banquet, when Miss Bertola, past grand
president, delivered a patriotic address
that was exceedingly well received.
The Jubilee committee has prp.Â«entf<]
to Miss Minnie Klevesahl of La Estrella
Parlor a beautiful photograph of Herself
in regal robes, as she appeared as Queen
of the Jubilee.
The officers of Fremont Parlor were
installed last week by Deputy Mrs. Theo
Lunstedt in that manner which has won
so many words of commendation in the
past for the installing officer. She was
assisted by Miss Mac B. AVllkins, Miss
Emma Dc-lwlg and Miss Edith Bryant.
Mr?. Daniels was on that night installed
as president for the third con?etoutive
term. The members of this parlor, who
of late have displayed unusual activity,
will during the month of April initiate
thirty candidates.
The members of the order all over the
State deeply sympathize with Grand
President Mrs. Belle W. Conrad in the
loss she has sustained by the death of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898,
asleep on the summit of Mount Tamal
pais. Myths are often the subject of dis
cussion or reference in this class, and one
day in an effort to make clear the defini
tion of a myth the teacher asked for sug
gestions in connection with this figure on
the ' mountain. Here are some of their
answers, which were given with scarcely
a moment's hesitation:
"1. A sleeping beauty.
"2. The wind and sun are her visitors.
She is to be the bride of the one who
awakens her. The fog is the spirits of
former worshipers.
"3. The waves sing at her feet. The
mountain is her bier.
"4. She is the bride of the sea.
"5. She is the guardian spirit of the
Indians. When she fell asleep the In
dians yielded to the white man. When
she awakens the Indians will rise and
claim the land.
"6. She is the guardian spirit of Cali
fornia and is sleeping but lightly; the
slightest rumor of war would rouse her
gigantic form to action.
"7. Shell Mound was an altar built for
her worship.
"S. She was picking flowers when she
was lulled to sleep by the singing waves.
She will sleep until the waves cease their
song.
"9 She is the Venus of the Pacific.

dates were initiated, ai:d it was an
nounced that several more would be In
itiated at the next meeting. It is expected
that there will be eight to take the de

The reports of this order show increas
ing prosperity. At the close of last year
the net assets were $173,079 and no benefit
claims unpaid or due. In March, 1890, the
receipts were $325, and in December last
they amounted to $9Sl!>. The new busi
ness of the guild in the paat year, the
largest in its history, was a little over
two and a half million dollars. The Fra
ternal Monitor of New York, in a recent
article, pays a highly flattering tribute to
the worth of S. Ojleskl, the supreme sec
retary of the order, denominating him "a
man of strong convictions, an earnest
and untiring worker, who has left his im
press on the affairs of this order, knitting
them so strongly that to-day it is ranked
among the strongest fraternal organiza
tions in this country."
THE NATIONAL, UNION.
The San Francisco Cabinet held a meet
ing last Monday night at which plans
for the entertainment to be given by the

I of this board that the section of the Po-
I litical Code requiring the designation of
! an official organ of the Department of
l Public Instruction should be repealed, and
I that the Superintendent of Public In
struction and the president of the State
Hoard of Education be requested to rec
ommend to the Legislature the repeal
' of the said provision.
Harr Wagner, the editor of the Western
Journal of Education, is a native of Penn
sylvania, and began teaching at the age
;of 17. In ISSI he graduated from the
i classical course of the College of Witten
! berg, and on coming to California a year
' later he purchased the old Golden Era
I Magazine, securing as assistant editors
i Joaquin Miller. Madge Morris and Ella
j Sterling Cummins. In ISB7 Mr. Wagner
i removed to Ran Diego, where he became
! founder of the San Diego College of Let
ters, taught English for three years, and
j started the agitation which finally re
: suited in converting this College of Let
: ters into a normal school.
From IR9O to 1595 Mr. Wagner held the
| office of County Superintendent, and dur
i ing this time he started the Arbor day
| movement in the public schools, which
; has since spread to other parts of the
j State, and secured the appointment of a
: day for school trustees' meetings and one
j for local teachers' institutes, which have
i met with much success.
Since this date Mr. Wagner has been
I occupied in lecturing for institutes and
writing textbooks. The well-known West
ern series of readers, 10,000 copies of which
have been sold, are products of his pen.
In 1897 Editor Wngner, in company with
Joaquln Miller, made a lecturing tour of
the Pacific Coast and of the Southern and
Eastern States.
Two years ago the Whitaker-Ray Com-
I pany started the Western Journal of
j Education and secured Harr Wagner as
! editor and manager, which position he
j has ever since held. With a strong, vigor-
I ous Intellect, both as writer and speaker,
ITarr Wagnpr has by his energetic and
sagacious directorship placed the Western
Journal in the foremost rank of our edu
cational magazines.

under consideration the observance in an
appropriate manner of Arcanum day.
This will be discussed at the next meet
ing, and there will also be brought up
a proposition for a card party and social.
The subject of joint meetings will also

received an application.
Supreme Warden Parriah is still labor
ing in the southern part of the State with

Since the Ist inst. considerable work has
been done in this order. A new camp
with thirty-two members was instituted
at Covina by Special Deputy Lyman of
Azusa, the Azusa team conferring the
protection degree. Deputies Blood and
Moody instituted a camp at Fulton, So
noma County; a new camp was organized
at Fruitvale. and a camp was instituted
at Alvarado. There are now seventeen
camps in Alameda County.

special train to South San Francisco on
the occasion of the installation of the
camp recently organized there.
To-morrow evening Golden Gate Camp
of this city will entertain the members of
Oakland Camp, and there will be an old
time camp blaze and log-rolling. This

WOODMEN'S FRIENDSHIP CLUB.
The- Woodmen's Friendship Club, a sick
benefit organization, to which all Wood
men are eligible, gave a great smoker last
week at which the following programme

iam Debols; selections on the autoharp.
Louis Klein; stereopticon views and reci
tation, Mr. Jennings; address on wood
craft and fraternity, D. Oliver Jr.; ac
cordion solo. Professor Miller; address on
the order. Special Organizer Dr. M. B.
Estes. During the evening the club re
ceived nine applications.
I last December, there was organized an
association of the State Teachers of His
tory. The purpose, as expressed in the
brief constitution adopted by the mem
bers, is "to promote the study and teach-
I Ing of history." Back of the thus broadly
! stated purpose are specific plans; the
j three most prominent are: To assist sec
i ondary schools in the selection of a well-
I chosen, working historical library; to ad
vance along definite lines the study of
i local history; to assist teachers in second
ary and grammar schools to a use of ori
ginal sources in their classes. The asso
ciation elected an advisory board of five
members, in which is vested the executive
I power. This advisory board consists of
; Professor Bernard Moses, of the State
i University, president: Professor Arley B.
i Show of the history department, Stanford
! University, vice-president; Mrs. R. F.
Winterburn. supervisor of. history in
' Stockton, secretary; E. M. Cox, Superin
j tendent of Schools, Santa Rosa, and Miss
i Genevra Sisson of Palo Alto.
At the first meeting of the advisory
! board, held very soon after the formation
j of the association, it was decided to pub-
I lish a leaflet containing the constitution
and a statement of the plans of the asso
ciation. It is intended that this leaflet
shall be the first in a series publishing the
results obtained by the association from
its various lines of development and re
search. It is hoped that all earnest his
tory teachers of California will become
members of this association, so that our
State may soon feel the results of com
bined efforts for the promotion of the
study of historyâ a subject whose power
ful Influence can hardly be overestimated
in the formation of character of the man
and of the citizen.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Preparations for the next meeting of the
Southern California Teachers' Associa
tion, to be held at Los Angeles March 31
and April 1 and 2. are progressing rapidly
and everything Indicates a large and one
of the best meetings in the history of the
association. Many prominent educational
people have signified their willingness to
come. The leading hotels of Los Angeles
will make liberal reductions in their rates
and will furnish headquarters for coun
ties and cities without extra expense. The
railroads will givp reudced jtites from all
points in the State. For information con- i
cerninp rates inquire of G. H. Chilcote, |
transportation secretary. 874 Pasadena j

All who enroll as members of the asso
ciation are entitled to these reductions
and to admission to the lectures provided !
WHIST
WELCOME TO A GREAT WHIST PLAYER.
Every whist player In San Francisco h.illed
with delight the announcement of his coming,
and now he ts here, an<l we extend both arms
to receive and give both hands of Milton C.
Work a warm grasp In welcoming him to the
metropolis of the Pacific Coast.
Our distinguished guest is a prominent attor
ney at Jaw of Philadelphia, well oft In Â«this
world's goods, and loves whist, aa wf love it,
for Kb own sake. He looks upon the game as
the greatest of all intellectual pastimes.
He stands in the front rank of whist players
âthere are none better, and very few his equal.
He is one of the Hamilton Club team who for
the tirst time in the history of the game won
the American Whist League challenge trophy
twenty times, ami by so doing makes it tne
club's permanent property.
For several years Mr. Work has beÂ«n one
of the most prominent whist writers in Amer
ica, and for three years edited a daily whist
column in one of the Philadelphia papers, a
Herculean task, and strange to say never
wrote a line of whist l'ur publication during
business hours.
Ther<Â» is no player living that Is better known
in whist circles than this great champion. One
of the greatest departures that was ever made
in whist was when Mr. Work presented to the
whist world his "Whist of To-day." that has
gained for him a world-wide reputation. Thi9
work was a revelation to whist writers and
players. An old saying of "Cavendish": "It
won't do to put it into the books." Work
thought differently, and the whist players of
this country were glad to see one man at least
with the courage of his convictions.
Mr. Work was the guest of honor at the
Trist Duplicate Whist Club Thursday evening,
and the Linda Vista Club of Oakland Friday
evening at the home of ex-President R. U.
Calley. To-morrow evening he will be the
guest of President G. M. Murph- at the San
Francisco Whist Club, and Tuesday he will be
lunched at the Bohemian Club by President
James A. Thompson of the Mill Valley Whist
Mr! Work is accompanied in his travels by
his charming little wife and father. Mrs.
Work is a great lover of the game and one of
the leading members of the Trist Club of
Philadelphia. Mr. Work Sr. is one of the pillars
of the old Hamilton Club, and loves whist next
to his devotions. He came to California six
weeks ago broken down in health, and he
Â«ays almost a miracle has been performed in
his case. In a very pleasant interview he told
us no human being could realize what a won
derful effect the climate of Southern California
"if the^stay of Mr. Work and his family is
not one round of pleasure it won't be the fault
of their new-found friends, and we sincerely
hope that their next visit to the Golden State
will not be caused by sickness.
INTERCLUB PLAY AT THE TRIST.
The third round of the interclub play was
held in the rooms of the Trist Duplicate Whist
Club Thursday evening last.
Mrs. Fredericks of the whist committee de
serves great credit for the manner In which
the match was arranged and conducted, for
everything was done under her immediate
supervision.
Milton C. Work, the great expert from Phila
delphia, was the guest of honor, and played
in a team for the Trist with George E. Bates.
H. C. Richards and JonatHan Curtis as co
partners. The evening was most enjoyable.

consent to . undertake It.. providing she wai
given sufficient encouragement and good coun
cil. She â¢ could get none of | the former from
New York, Boston. Providence, Philadelphia,
Brooklyn or Chicago, from those standing high
in whist circles among the men. We reluct
antly suggested to her to give up the idea for
the time. California stood alone on the propo
sition for women in whist. 'Bat what a change
has come over the spirit of their dreams since
thenâ these - same cities have swallowed the
j spinner,- leader,' line, tip. rod and reel. â  In a
i little over a year from the time it was first
! broached, a Woman's : Whist League was
j launched by one of the ..most enthusiastic
i whisters of this country, a lady of indomita-
I ble willâ Mrs. E. H. Andrews of Philadelphia,
i and was chosen its first president. Next month
will be the crucial test. The women will hold
! their second congress. Should the same thing
i happen this year .that happened last, thÂ«
Woman's League will ring its own d^.Â»th
1 knell. From afar off. we sound a note of w.i n
) ingâ our heart, is with the movement, * fi;ut
' everything must be done with clean hands.
It is to , be hoped that those -In authority
: will take the advice offered them by such
â  writers as the' Whist Editor of the Evening
; Post of New York and have a National
Woman's League and not a sectional - one â
| have the . "board of governors" control the
! affairs of the league and not any one or two
! individuals, no matter how competent.
Let the whist women of America know that
j the sun shines occasionally in other whist
i circles besides- a portion of Philadelphia, and
I when these ladies meet in the city of brotherly
love to take part in their whist contests, a Una
I of play should- be laid out for them and fol
lowed to the letter, and not changed to suit
Borne foolish notion, as was done last year
after the contests commenced.
The umpire or referee of each contest should
be chosen from outside of the â the reason
Is obvious. The announcement of the result
of each match should be put on the bulletin
board In every detail as quickly as possible
after the match is finished. . Thirty minutes
is plenty of time.
Every score made at a congress should be aa
open book after a contest Is over.
A quick announcement of " the result of a
match gives the players confidence and shows
there is no underhand wT>rk going to be prac
ticedâaa was openly charged at the first conÂ«
gress. - r-.-V
We were In Brooklyn a few weeks ago when '
the president of the -Woman's Whist League
made the statement that ' the women would
show, the men how to run congresses. Cer
tainly -last year was not an example of It.
But let us wait and see. At the same time wo
wish them every success. . ~ ;;':Y"
I PLAY OLD-FASHIONED WHIST.
Those who have played whist for a number
|of years .have often heard the remark: "I
don't know anything about this new kind of
whist. I play the 'old-fashioned' game."
Some weeks ago we received a marked copy
of a Coast newspaper in which we read what
purported to be an : Interview with one of these
"old-fashioned whist players," as he was un
doubtedly proud to call himself. In this arti
cle he ridiculed the idea of acquiring a knowl
edge of â¢ whist by the study and practice
method. This "old-fashioned player." as fine
a gentleman as you would want to meet, is c.
Judge, that is, we were introduced to him'a^
such. â -â â : â¢..'-.*'â¢
How would It sound to his learned ears, or
to the ears of any learned barrister, for me to
say: "I practice law the "old-fashioned way'
but never studied it?" I Or to say to a skillful
surgeon or physician: "I practice surgery and
medicine the 'old-fashioned way âbut never
studied it." Or to say to an educated clergy
man: "I preach the gospel the "old-fashioned -
way"â but never read the Bible. Or to hear
the . new master of an ocean steamer say:
"When I go to sea I will navigate my ship tne
'old-fashioned way"â but I never studied navi
gation or even the use of a sextant."
These remarks generally reflect discredit on
the maker. It is an acknowledgment of lgnor
i ance'on the subject they are talking about.
i â  Whist, as it is played by the educated player,
is the same to-day that It was 150 years ago,
with a few slight variations of no great im
portance whatever. a teacher of whist from
Edmond Hoyle was a teacher of whist from
the years 1740 to about 17.-.>. During that time
! in the year 1742. he; wrote the first edition of
I his famous book â on the game, and inside -of
ten years ten edition* were Printed , a " d n ?Â°, < hh a |.
If -IÂ» should reprint the first edition of that
i book to-day, using new type and new style of
binding- and not change a single word as re-
Lards The instructions to whist players, from
cover to cover, and call It "Tormey-s Latest on
Whist." I don't believe there would be one
in a thousand that would recognize it.
'V whist student doesn't ever say he I. a
â¢â¢new-fashioned'.' or "old-fashioned player."
i ThPro are a great many brilliant card players
: wandering around our whist clubs all over, the
! country groping in the dark with lots of
i natural card sense, that play at wmst with
considerable success In winning tricks and
rimes Their knowledge of the game is ac
niii-ed by playing by sight or pick, up method,
and if this class of playersâ l am sorry to say.
our city clubs have quite a numberâ could only
lÂ«> 'induced to raise the .veil which years of
prejudice has kept close and tight around their
eves what a revelation it would he to them.
Hut to sit down and attempt to play ,the
came of whist as It should be played, without
any knowledge of it. is like visiting the great
i art galleries of Rome, Florence. Venice. Dres
: den or other places of Europe, or attempting. to
enjoy the -beautiful poem- "Comus" or the ode
"On the Morning of the -Nativity" without a

MRS. RYLEY AND THE IMPOSSIBLE
MR. BUGLE.
I am sorry that "The Mysterious Mr.
Bugle" turns out to be of so little ac
count. It completely knocks out the
brilliant sermon on the woman drama
tist which I had in mind for this Sab
bath with Madeline Lucette Ryley for
the timely text. I wonder if dramatists
are ever so -heritable to critics as to
confess that it is their work which de
termines the quality of criticism?
It is a comfortable reflection, any
way. The more new plays I see the
better am I reconciled to- my colleagues
and myself. The other day I read in
the New York Commercial Advertiser.
a newspaper of conspicuous reserve and
reliability a speech of Julia Marlowe*,
in which she said that we have no
drama nowadays because we have no
dramatic critics. I should have pleas
ured in arguing the point with Miss
Marlowe, and would haveâ only, on |
reading the next day's Commercial Ad- j
vortiser I found that that paper had. ,
with its customary reserve and relia- |
bllity published Miss Marlowe's entire
denial of the speech. But about Mrs.
Ryley I feel particularly put out, re
membering the glad Ink poured over
earlier efforts of this industrious young
woman. In recalling certain trustful
prophecies of the wonderful Mrs. Ry
ley-to-be. I admit the fallibility of dra
matic criticism, even in The Call. Aft
er all, critics would do wiser to deal
exclusively in the past and present and ;
let the future take care of itself. I \
should hate to know Mrs. Ryley j
through only her "Mr. Bugle," and at
tempt to cast her future on the mer-
Ita of that farfre. In such circum
stances the publication of her horo
scope would be libel.
â¢ * â¢
And yet "The Mysterious Mr. Bugle"
Is, for all its structural weakness and
amiable inanities, unmistakably and
characteristically Mrs. Ryley's. In a
mild way it is a caricature of her bet
ter style. The dialogue, while not so
Fharp as that of "An American Citi
zen" or even "Christopher Jr.," is still.
in its brightest passages, on the same
scheme of sublimated vaudevilleze; and
the whole social atmosphere of ' the
piece is touched with that unconscious
disregard of the conventions which is
apparent in all of her work. Mrs. Rlley
is not a writer of smart plays. The
manners, the mental fashions of her
characters are far from urban. Her
portraiture of the American quality,
like Henry Arthur Jones', when he
gives us Jukes and loidies in their an
cestral halls, is scarecly convincing. In
my wildest prophecy I could not have
included a modern comedy of manners
among the possible accomplishments of
Mrs. Ryley. But what she showed a
special grasp of in "An American Citi
zen" was that type of character most
fittingly described in the title of the
piece. She sketched the American cit
izen, the young one of to-day, as he
never has been done in any other play
of my acquaintance. She sketched him
with all his comic weekly wit, vaude
ville epigram, commercial fertility,
sound heart,, quick nerve, good sense
and enthusiastic manners. She showed
the first stage representation of that
phase of young American-.sm which
1 meets the more serious emotions of life
* with a jest, and, like as not, a vaude
ville jest at that; the young American
â who is hopelessly, irreverently, damna
bly impregnated with American humor.
And Nat Goodwin played the part,
which was nothing less than an ideali
zation of himself. He has done big- ;
ger things, but his skin never fitted
him closer than did this part of Beres
ford Cruger in "An American Citizen." ;
I have no doubt that Mrs. Ryley copied j
Nat Goodwin shamelessly when she i
â wrote "An American Citizen" for him, I
but at all events she succeeded in
striking one true note of American
character, and, whatever the trustful
ness of the story, she wrote a play with
a live man in it.
* â¢ â¢
But nobody lives in "Mr. Bugle." The
only attempts at human identity are in
a comic aunt of rhetorical sarcasm, her
brat of a son, who wears precocious !
spectacles and makes a business of fall
ing over chairs, and an imperturbable
servant, suggestively humorous. The
brat, I think, is new to the stage, al
though he died in print with the last
generation of newspaper humorists, but
not valuable; the two others are an- |
tlquely English. The comic aunt and
her tumbling offspring have no place
at all in the plot, and the servant has
served in earlier pieces in his same sug
gestive capacity. This leaves the per- !
Bonages involved in the actual intrigue â j
so completely involved in a series of fe
rociously misfit situations that the sig
nal specialty of each seems lunacy.
Mrs. Ryley may say that this is not se- !
rious drama, nor even comedy, but
farce. She calls it, if you please, "a
legitimate farce," a description that
perhaps is used only to distinguish it
from the song and dance and under
clothes affairs which are commonly in
cluded in the farce class, but neverthe
less one that inspires expectations of
Just the sort of farce Mrs. Ryley did j
not write. And that is good farce in
which one, two or more persons of se
rious purpose, and simple-head if need

Mrs. Ryley's scheme is preposterously
! unplausible. From one end of "Mr. Bu

speculation as to what will happen
next, because everything that happened

interest and obscured all idea of a

the will, and that she assumes at ran

i cure the liberty that is granted matron

an earlier notice I praised the "cigar

The theatrical paragraphers are say
ingthat T Tenry Irving is broken-hearted
as well as financially crippled by the fire
which destroyed the warehouse in
which the scenery and properties of
nearly all his elaborate Shakespearean
productions were stored. The entire
scenic outfit of more than thirty plays
was destroyed. Two hundred "cloths,"
painted by the foremost scenic artists
of this era, and many elaborate scenes
stretched on frames, have gone forever.
The loss comes all the heavier upon
him just now when, owing to the com
plete failure of "Peter the Great," he
has found it necessary to revive his
repertory until a new play can be got
ready, a task which takes anywhere
from eight weeks to three months.
Another rumored- thorn in the Eng
lish actor's side at present is the
change that has come over Ellen Terry.
As long ago as last May it was com
mon talk in London that Irving anil
Miss Terry were not on the best of
terms and that the actress had threat
ened to resign from the company and
take a theater on her own account,
with Frank Cooper as her leading man.
This quarrel, however, was patched up

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SODAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
I late in the Bummer, but since the fail
! ure of "Peter the Great" it seems to
j have broken out again, and it is gen
erally understood now that unless the
fair Ellen sees fit to change her mind
again this is the last season she will
appear at the Lyceum.
It is said that Henry Irving will not
act in "Cyrano de Bergerac" after all
the pains he took to secure the English
rights. His next production wiil be
"The Medicine Man," the joint work of
H. D. Trail, the editor of Literature,
and Robert Hichens, the young bar
rister who wrote "The Green Carna
tion." This will mark the first appear
ance in years of Irving in modern
clothes. Hypnotism furnishes the mo
tive of the play, Sir Henry hypno
tically detecting a murderer.
Speaking again of "Cyrano de Ber
gerac," Mansfield finally has secured
the American rights and will produce
the now famous French play early in '
the autumn. Henry Irving's reason
for not producing "Cyrano" in London
is said to be based on the fact that
Miss Terry and young Irving, who
journeyed to Paris especially to see the
original performance, pronounce it un
translatable, too poetically undramatic
for the English tongue and English
taste. However, this news will have
only a stimulating effect on Mansfield,
who in more than one curtain speech
has confessed himself a several times
better actor and manager than his col
league of the London Lyceum.
When Miss Ethel Barrymore's en
gagement to Laurence Irving was an
nounced her father, Maurice Barry
more, cabled: "Have just heard of
your engagement. Heartiest congrat
ulations." Scarcely a fortnight later
came the news that the ertgagement
was broken off. Whereupon Mr. Barry
more again cabled, "Have just heard
that your engagement is off. Still con
gratulate you."
Actor Davies Is responsible for the
foregoing paragraph.
Lillian Russell, according to a rumor,
Is considering a proposition to star
jointly with De Wolf Hopper next sea
son.
The New York papers have taken up
I the subject of the too frequent benefit
j performances which impose on actors
j and managers. With few exceptions
| âthe most 'notable one being Modjeska,
I who thinks that if vaudeville and
j other artists are able to appear in
| "continuous" bills and are not taxed, as
' all actors are in some countries, surely
â  they can do a little extra work now and
I then for either charity or artâ both
I managers and actors vote the benefit
|an imposition and a nuisance. The
j directors of the Actors' Fund have
; taken a hand in the matter and will
see to it that a law is passed which
will reserve for the Fund a fair per
centage of the receipts of every bene
fit performance.
Here is a bouquet of new engage
ments: Marie Burroughs will reappear
with John L. Stoddart in "The Bonnie
Briar Bush." Selina Fetter is going
into vaudeville with a condensation of
"Captain Impudence." Maude Granger
is a star again in "Camille," Fanny
Janauschek in "Mary Stuart" and Cora
Tanner in "Alone in London." Marie
Celeste and Louise Royce have joined
the Castle Square Company for the cast
of "Sinbad." Eleanor Moretti will be
with Mr Kelcey and Miss Shannon in
"The Moth and the Flame" at the Ly
ceum.
Budapest is crowding its Royal Opera
House to see a ballet founded on Rider
Haggard's weird story of "She." The
ballet consists of twelve tableaux, the
first being taken from the companton
novel, "Cleopatra," in order to intro
duce Kallikrates and Amenartas. Kal
likrates, in his capacity of priest, as-
sists at the mystic rites of Isis, and,
during the progress of the orgies, es
capes with his secret lover, Amenartas,
under the curse of Isis. Then is intro
duced the cave of the Fire of Life,
guarded by an old hermit. Ayesha
(She) wins her way to this secret spot
by descending in the basket used for
conveying fnod to the hermit. From
this point on the story follows the nar
rative of the novel.
Ada Rehan's illness compels her to
abandon a projected revival of "The
Merchant of Venice," in which she has
been preparing to enact Portia for the
first time. In the current perform
ances at Daly's, Lettice Fairfax as
sumes the leading role whenever Miss
Rehan is unable to do it. The favorite
actress will after this week retire until
next season.
Coppee's "Le Passant," done into
English verse, will be given a single
performance at the Astoria, New York,
this week, with handsome Julius Opp
as the boy and Marie Burroughs as the
girl.
The incidental music in the play of
"The Tree of Knowledge, " at the Ly
ceum, is selected from themes of
Tchaikowsky's "Pathetic" symphony.

Moszkowski was asked who there was
to take the great pianist's place or ev&n
nspire to it. He pointed to a slender,
thoughtful-looking lad, who had sat in
the front row. absorbing the work of
the master, and said:
"That boy, Josef Hofmann. He will
be Rubinstein's successor."
Moszkowski was then teaching Hof
mann composition, as d'Albert and Ru
binstein were teaching him th% piano,
and he only voiced the opinion of the
few who at that time had heard the
boy play.
Hofmann is already a great pianist,
says the critic of the Commercial Ad-Â«
vertlser, a great virtuoso. He has in
a seemingly unlimited degree all those
qualities that go to make a great mu
sician. Whether he will become that
time alone will tell, but in the face ef
what we know of him as a boy of ten
and now a* youth of twenty, we see no
reason to doubt that the future holds
much for him. He has been wisely
trained; his genius has been carefully
and tenderly fostered: and If to-day he
is in so many respects a man before his
time, why should we doubt that the
coming years, with their deepening and
broadening effect, with such rich and
fertile material to work with, will not
complete the work that has been so
grandly begun?

Widow; Edwin Stevens, the lubricated
Count Mennaggio; Tillie Salinger, the
sweet Dora McAllister, the widow's
daughter by her first husband: Georgie
Cooper, the stepsister Nora; Edith Hall,
the colored maid; Arthur Donaldson,
the explosive Captain Cranberry; Phil
Branson, his demure son Tom; John
J. Raffael, the young blood from. Bos-

ton; Arthur Boyce, the Pinkerton de

ard, a part which he is said to have
made very funny in John E. Sheridan's
production of this same farce, under ti
tle of "Fun on the Brsto-1."
The chorus will have its chance in
the concert hall scene of the second act.
which will consist largely of songs and

F. Marion Crawford, perhaps the

with being an amiable exception. He \
is said to indulge in easy, sensible elo
cution and to infuse magnetic person
ality into his talks. His knowledge of
modern Italy surpasses that of any oth
er writer of the language, and special
interest should be attracted to his open
ing lecture, which has for its subject
"Leo XIII in the Vatican." "The Orig

c-n Tuesday evening, and "Italian Home

farce to-morrow night, giving an Eng
lish piece by the name of -'The Girl Up
to Date." The title is supposed to-be
descriptive of the central character, a
young woman named Winnie Tiveston,
who, in the ambiguous language of the
Alcazar's press agent, is said. to be &
phrenological study from the rise to tne
fall of the curtain." It would need a
phrenologist tor an astrologer to trans
late into sense the, press agent's fore
cast of the plot. The following is it:
The sister to Winnie as the curtain rises
is a bride of but a. few days to Charles
Fullalove: Stopping with him is his er
ratic uncle. Dudly Fullalove. who poses
as a deacon, and who by court rites is
holding money in trust left to Charley.
The Uncle gives Charley out of this
money at his marriage, the sum of low
pounds. This? money his nephew invested
without his knowledge. Into the Apollo
Concert Hall. His absence from home In
attention to business, evenings, was
looked upon by the uncle as leading a
double life. This fact was made known
to hie wife by the uncle. Plans to shadow
his footsteps were laid in the attempt to
have him placed under hypnotic power.
The hypnotist engaged happened to be
the man doing an act at the Apollo hall.
The result was that the uncle was made
the subject, and to the amazement or
witnesses, proved to be regular Don
Juan. Not content with disgracing his
relatives he pubUcally. knocked out. on tne
Apollo sta^e. a professional boxer, .hen
broutrht too. he saw that he had been
made the victim of his own trap, and that
his nephew was not the erring, young
man after all which he had been taken
for. Charley was then handed over an
the money left to him and a happy sequel
closes the farcical story.
Morosco's. â¢
The attraction at Morosco's next
week will be Oliver Byron's melodrama,
"Upper Hand," with which he starred
the country a few years ago. The;
play has been a mint to Byron and stilE
yields rich royalties. It is in five
acts, replete with sensational incidents
and comic relief. It tells the story
of Jack Lamar, a whole-souled fellow,
who steps forth from the ranks of
the people and marries the woman her
loves, incurring thereby the bitter ha
tred of her wealthy mother, who (to
gether with a scoundrelly lawyer, New
ton Darke. who is also a disappointed
suitor) plots his undoing. He is false
ly accused of murder, and sentenced
to ten years in prison. He escapes
In the second act, with brain crazed
by wrongs and suffering. He wander*
to the home of his wife, but is driven
away by the mother. Eventually his
reason is restored, he is reunited to his
wife, his enemies confused and over
come and everything hapdly ended.
All the favorites of the company arÂ«
in the cast, and Fred Tjader has beeix
specially engaged for a comedy role-
There will be a number of specialties;
Introduced by members of the com
pany; also a sensational explosion

OrpKeum.
The important changes at the Or*
pheum this week especially include a.
one-act comedy entitled "Mrs. Hogan's:
Music Teacher," in which the principal
parts are played by Charles T. Ellis,
i Mrs. Ellis, Clara Barry. Thomas Grady
> and Michael Welch. This is something
I of a new departure for the Orpheum.
' but is in keeping with the latest vaude
ville fad in having a comedy or dra
matic skit in which the parts are playedt
by people from the legitimate stage.
In marked contrast to this is the act
by McCale and McDanlels, who are said.
to be the greatest Irish knockabout
comedians in the business. A novelty
| turn is expected from Master Wade
â  Cochran, a precocious youth of 6, who
i is so well versed in biblical, historical
i and geographical matters that he
; finds ready answers to a list or over
â  twenty thousand questions. The work.
;of his sister, Gertie Cochran Wade.
: is well known to Orpheum patrons and!
! it is -claimed that Master Wade does

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
â¢Ir pressure: isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usu; lly accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weath?r and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure I." high in the interior and low
along: the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along; the ccasi. rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is lm
frobable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
daho. and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 19.â The action or lack
of action of to-day's stock market can only be
Interpreted as the natural restriction of the
overshadowing of the uncertainty of the Cuban
question. Last Saturday the threatening as
pect of the situation, coupled with the recol
lection of the developments of the
preceding Saturday in the suggestion for thÂ» re
call of General Lee, led to reckless short sell
ing by the traders, driving the market to a
point even lower than the Monday market suc
ceeding the Lee incident. The pinching ad
ministered to the reckless bears in the re
bound of last Monday made them extremely
cautious about putting out short lines In to
day's market. Even the shorts who were
driven to cover in yesterday's late flurry over
unwarranted rumors of compromise with Spain
did not venture to renew me:r selling. The
consequence was an almost lifeless market, as
no one is ready to take the long side of the
market at this time. . Prices dritted aimlessly
up and down over a narrow range. Only a
little over 100,000 shares changed hands during
the day's short session.
The bond market was equally dull.
The bank statement showed an unexpected
Increase in the surplus reserve, but the net in
crease in specie by no means reflected the re
ceipts of imported gold during the week, and
the stock 'of legal tenders .ras materially re
duced. Th<Â» lowering of the legal reserve level
by t1.526.120 through the reduction in deposits
accounted for that much of the increased sur
plus. The 110,585,100 contraction in loans , is
clear enough evidence that the heavy receipts
of gold from abroad are insufficient to main
tain the balance o( the money market, in spite
oi .ie distinctly easier tone of money in the
last days of the week.
The Cuban problem has remained the domi
nant factor in the stock market during the
week. Its uncertainties ami perplexities are
felt to be so great that no one in the specu
lative world feels competent â¢ - form a fixed
opinion as to the outcome. The .result is a
email and narrow market. The heavy liquida
tion-of speculative holdings of long stocks in
duced by the first stage of the threatening de
velopments has about been concluded, and
probably no further heavy offerings will be in
duced except by some development threatening
serious consequences to security values. That
there, has been an extensive restriction of cred
its has been obvious from tne developments in
the money market. But this restriction has
. oi'i>arently affected nothing- yet beyond specula
tive enterprises and ' partly trading in-securi
ties. Prices move easily and quickly with only
the light Volume of business, which is wholly

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, ,19.â The opening in wheat
was irregular. Traders In July rather looked
with favor on the selling side, as the cold wave
which was expected to follow the rains did
not materialize and there was apparently no
â¢ prospect of any serious drop In temperature.
Cables failed to respond to the strength shown
here yesterday. This caused some liquidation
in July at the outset, opening prices being
Ss"i<SS6c, showing %c decline. There the mar
ket halted, however. May was strong from the
start. Shorts were active bidders for this de
livery, which opened %C higher at $1 06. and
heavy buying soon sent prices up to $1 06%.
The demand for May and the advance in that
future soon brought July shorts into â  the pit
to protect themselves, heavy buyers of yester
day coming Into the market again, and the de
mand became general. The result was a
gradual advance to 86% c. Realizing then set
In and a reaction to 86% c took place. May at
the same time dropping to *1 06%. The drop
ping off in the Northwest receipts was a help
ing influence. " Continental markets were
steady. . The reaction in both options was of
short duration and the demand soon became
j heavy â¢ again, especially â â  in May, the > price of
1 which was sent up to $1 07. July advanced to
: 86% c. The advance was well maintained up to
11 o'clock, when the market began gradually
to give way. Leiter's brokers had meantime
i begun selling heavily of May at top figures,
I and as shorts became tilled up the demand from
i this source! decreased. ' Liquidation, however,
I did not become general until heavy . estimated
I receipts for Monday were posted. These
i brought: In. a 'flood of realizing orders and
prices late In the session broke very sharply.
Leiter kept up his selling of May to the last
and probably disposed of : over 1.000,000 bush
1 els. In the last few minutes early buyers be
! came, sellers, and with this added weight, of
! liquidation" the : market became very . weak,
1 though July did 'â  not suffer so much as May.
! Closing price for the latter option was $1 03,
' July closing at 85%<fi:S5%c. .
Corn was slow. May closed unchanged.
Oats were : firm early, but declined with

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. March 19.â The Financier says:
Judging from the statement of the associated
banks of New York City for the week ending
March 19, it will require a larger war scare
than has yet appeared to put money at higher
rates than have ruled for a few weeks past.
Even with less than $6,000,000 of the Imported
gold Bhowing in the total, the banks have
gained $4,512,500 In cash, the specie increase
of $5,211,300 having been offset by a loss of
$1,698,800 in legal tender, the latter represent
ing in large part the shipments to the interior.
The position of the New York banks at present
Is very strong. They "hold an excess reserve
of $28,060,050, as compared with $20,523.. r )00 two
weeks ago. The policy of contraction, however,
has brought about heavy reductions In several
Items. Thus the loans of the banks are now
$39,600,000 less than one month ago. Deposits
in the same time have fallen off more than
$50 000,000. The loss in cash, however, has only
been $10,000,000, all of which has gone to inter
ior institutions, and the excess reserve Is near
ly $3,000,00 i) larger than at the close of business
February 19. The interior demand has been
rather well satisfied, but owing to the cheap
ness of transfer rates the domestic exchange
quotations are moving Independently of usual
lactors. As showing the calmness which pre
vails, it may be noted that interior banks iire
again in this market as purchasers of com
merical paper.
The changes in the totals for the week are
less than expected. The loan Item decreased
$10 585 100, due to the continued liquidation. It
W worth mentioning that the decreases of one
bank, which Is the largest lender to call funds
and also the largest importer of specie, ac
counts for $6,000,0<W of the total reduction. De
posits have decreased $7,304,500. but the bank
which reduced its loan item so heavily figures
but slightly in this. There seems to be no
doubt that the sales of sterling bills have some
connection with the loan decrease. It is esti
mated that at least $3.'-,000,000 of accumulated
sterling bills are held in this city, and any
rapid advance in money must of necessity lead
to continued large imports of gold.
This amount of deferred credits will increase
; rather than diminish under normal conditions,
i as the monthly trade balances in favor of the
United States are growing, exports showing
! an expansion and imports a contraction. Short
: <j( actual war, there seems to be no reasons
I for a money market higher than prevails at
j present.

| animation at the wool auction s<iles to-day. |

COFFEEâ C..E. Bickford's coffee circular
contains the following: Our last report was
Issued on the 26th ultimo. The market dur
ing the Interval has been very quiet. â¢ Washed
coffees of all kinds are at a standstill, and the
prices quoted, although marking a reduction
from former rates, are still largely nominal.
Buyers view these qualities as being too high
in comparison with unwashed coffees, and will
purchase the former only when their necessi
ties compel it. and then In the most sparing
way. The transactions in current unwashed
Salvador indicate some faith in the future of
this description, and the opinion grows that
present rates are safe for' liberal investments.

THE NEWEST FABRICS.
One of the prettiest and much-courted
fabrics is the old-time si!k-warp ba
rege, which, in mother's young lady
days, was the proper thing for party
gowns. They are shown in both light
and dark plain colors, and they come in
all shades, covered with rich colors in
flower patterns. The new challies are
extremely pretty in both design and
coloring. The dark blue, green and red
grounds, with satin stripes of the same
color scattered over, with white or
black polka-dots, are styligh, and will
figure conspicuously among the gowns
built for cool spring and summer days.
Though black taffeta has had a run of
several seasons as a handsome gown,
spring will see it as popular as ever,
and the trimmings of lace and velvet
ribbons represent a small fortune In
themselves.
Cashmere, very thin and light, poplin
fabrics and soft, light serges are to be
much worn, while canvas-cloth in fancy
weaves flourishes under the new name
of "Mouline natte." Transparent fab
rics are dazzlingly beautiful, some be
ing so woven as to have the appear
ance of being tucked crosswise, which
in grenadines, mousseline-de-soie and
chiffon is charming. Organdies are ever
new and ever old, and as each spring
season rolls around they are placed in
the foremost ranks of thin fabrics.
Black crepe de chine gowns are very
much in evidence, and are trimmed
with narrow ruffles of the same, edged
with tiny edge of black lace or a nar
row ruche of black footing. The waists
lose their somber effect by using bands
of open-wrought insertion which hsow
a bright colored lining. White lace at
the neck and wrists, too, adds to the
brightness of these bodices.
Watered silk, with large satin polka
dots, waved or pointed cross stripes
and disks, are shown among the newest
black goods.
Lace and net dresses are much worn
again, some showing a black lining,
while others are made over colored
silks. â March Woman's Home Com
panion.
NO CONCERT IN OURS.
New York Mail and Express.
There is something fantastic in the sug
gestion of a concert of European nations
to mediate between the United States and
Spain for the purpose of averting war.
Even if this Government were to agree to
such a programme Spain probably,
j wouldn't, Sagasta having already an
| nounced that she will submit to no for
! eign interference in her own affairs. But
i the European concert business is played
out anyhow, and the nations over there
have troubles enough of their own on
j hand to engage their undivided attention.
CHEAP MONEY IN THE WEST.
Boston Transcript.
Cheap money has .struck the Southwest
and the Clinton, Mo., Republican invites
the calamity-howler to make a note of
the fact that several counties in that
State have recently refunded their 5 and
6 per cent bonds at 3^2 and 4 per cent.
But the calamity-howler will not make a
note of any such occurrences, for they
do not harmonize with his howl.

HOW JACK BECAME A HERO
I BELIEVE that I am just as dis
appointed as you will be. Jack, but
I must start to-night and I see no
other way than to leave you to take
care of poor sick mamma and baby
â¢ Helen while I am gone. x Can you
do it, little man?"
Jack Everett was 12 years old. His
home was in California.. His grand
father and grandmother and many
other relatives live in New York State.
Mr. Everett had intended to take all his
family to New York for the summer,
but he was forced to go without them.
Jack had heard his father tell many
times about a bear that he had seen
when he was a boy. Jack had heard
that bears live a long time, and he had
determined t>> try to kill it should h<
ever visit New York. Now his father
was going aAvay and Jack could not
go with him. It seemed hard enough
to the boy.
He bore up bravely, however, and
went with his mother, the baby and
the nurse to the springs in the Sierras,
taking with him his 22-caliber rifle.
A mountain stream ran very near the
hotel and Jack caught some beautiful
trout. Mrs. P^verett declared papa never
did or could catch such beauties in the
Delaware for the very good reason they
weren't there to catch.
"If she praises me so for a few little
fish what will she say when I kill a
bear?" thought Jack.
It was a wild, mountainous place,
with tall pine trees almost touching the
sky. and huge boulders â  and piles of
rock that looked like castles with ter
rible dungeons, such as they used .to
keep vris^ners in -Jong 'ago. It wasfrt't
hard to fancy almost anything in the
way of fighting and prisoners here, for
there were Indian arrow heads every
where. Certainly there must have been
either a great deal of game -killed here
or else a furious battle once upon a
time.
Under these circumstances nothing
was more natural than that Jack
Bhould play he was an Indian war
rior. He was fortunate enough to
phoot an immense hawk, and his
mother and another lady made him a
head-dress of the feathers that looked
exactly like pictures of tnose worn by
King Philip. The proprietor of the
hotel had a real Indian bow and arrow
and a real Indian necklace made of
hears' claws, both of which he lent to
Jack on the spot. Some wild berries
made the right color for a blood
thirsty warrior's skin, and when all
these thing's were on, and Jack as-
Fumed his fairest frown, any one who
paid he did not look like an out and
out savage didn't know what was
what.
He frightened Helen so that she
cried. Then he proposed taking her
upon the hill just In front of the hotel.
Nurse went with them to put up a
hammock for the baby to sit in while
Jack explored the neighborhood.
"Now, kape your best eye on the
baby, Mr. Injun, for it's a wild baste
lives in that hole under the rock, I'm
ihinkin'."
Mary laughed as she said it. She

didn't really think anything of the
kind, neither did Jack. but he
premised, and after he had shot an ar
row at a squirrel that ran up a tree
turnfd his attention to the rock with
a wild warhoop. "Woe to the pale
faces."
First he looked in the hole, which
was not very large but so dark that
he could see nothing. He took a long
stick and poked it in as far as he
could reach. Then he lookod aeain.
but not very carefully, or he would
have seen two glaring eyes.
"The enemy has Mown, the fortress
is ours." he shouted, not dreaming
of a fierce enemy that was just ready
to spring upon him and as a final
EAGER BOYS AND GIRLS
The interest among the boys and girls is at floodtide! Concerning
what? Why, the test to see whether the boys or the girls can get out the
better page of stories and essays. The suggestions are becoming so many
that several typewriters would be kept busy, night and day, acknowledg
ing them all, if that were feasible. But, of course, the young people do
not expect that. The great number of letters coming to hand in the past
week, if their writers were to be polled, would show that the following
points may be considered as settled.
The age of competitors is fixed at 18 years; stories are preferred to any
other form of composition; the limit of all stories is 600 wordsâ and no
more; the -jury to decide .vhether the boys or the girl* are the victors will
include women and men â probably the four originally designated, and the
four will name the fifth juror. The time for the close of the competition is
still to be decided upon; but this should not deter the young writers from
sending their stories forward at once. Each story intended for compe
tition should be marked "competitive," that there may be no mistake.
Write on one side of the paper only and send your postoftke address.
There is room, this week, for only a few extracts from the many let
ters sent by young writers. Clara 11. Kennedy of Goodyear's Bar, Cal.,
writes: "The age of competitors should not exceed 18 years; the editor of
the Boys' and Girls' page should choose the jurors: it would be difficult to
choose the class of matter to be written, as some could write stories and
essays would be easier for others": Clara asks "whether any of the boys
and girls could draw designs for either page?" The answer is that good
drawings will be welcomed, but only a few could be used, the purpose be
ing to give as much space as possible to the writers.
Mary Tenney of San Francisco suggests "that there should be five
judges and these should be school principals, three women and two men.
I think that the judges should live in five different cities." How is that
idea â five school principals for judges? That is new.
Laura Jane Gray thinks that "every boy or girl who competes should
publish his or her' age. for that would be fairer."
Thaddeus Henderson wishes "that the girls might all write stories
about fairies and the boys write stories about wild animal adventures."
Next Sunday morning the date for closing the competition will be an
nounced. Sufficient time will -be given those at a distance to become
competitors, but it is urged anew that all the writers will help by being
prompt.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1898.
mark of triumph he shot an arrow into
the dark cavern.
In a twinkling out of that hole
sprang the wildest, fiercest little beast
you ever saw, with sharp pointed ears
and a snarling mouth; with cruel
white teeth, eyes blazing with anger,
and feet with long sharp claws. It
was a wild cat, and a big one, to<>.
Now, if Jack, the inatant he shot the
arrow, had not jumped to his feet for
the purpose of dancing a war dance
the wild cat would have sprung upon
him. Instead of which the first object
he saw was poor little Helen, a few
feet away in the hammock laughing
and clapping her hands with delight
at Jack's antics.
EDITED BY
DAVID H.
WALKER
Instantly the furious beast sprang
upon her. Just how Jack reached her
or just what he did, he never knew.
He had a dim recollection of screaming
and pulling and beating the cat, so
that it left Helen and attacked him.
His one thought was it must be kept
away from the baby because he was
taking care of her, but the snarling was
horrible, and the claws hurt terribly,
and he was blinded by the blood which
streamed down his face.
He tried to get his hands around the
creature's threat to choke it, and I
guess he would have succeeded, for he
was a brave boy. but at that instant
"bang" went a rifle, and both Jack and
the wildcat fell down on the ground
and rolled over and over. A minute
more a real Indian was bending over
them and helping Jack to his feet. The
wildcat was badly wounded, but not
dead, so another ball was put straight
between his eyes.
Strange to pay. the baby's wounds
were not very bad. Jack's were worse,
and the soars be will bear all his life,
but the Indian knew a plant that
stanched the blood. Of course, every
body in the hotel was greatly excited
and frightened, and everybody pro
nounced Jack a hero.
I think he whs, too, don't you? And
wasn't his tether proud o-f him!
No one could ever guess what was
the nicest thinK Mr. Everett could find
in New York for his boy, so I must
tell. It was an enormous bear skin,
the original owner of which was shot
just a few weeks before in the very
same spot where Mr. Everett had seen
one so many years ago-. Jack was sure
it was the same bear, sohecouldn't have
killed it if he ha.i with his father,
and every time h- tells the boys. about
his encounter with the wildcat he is
glad he didn't go.
THINGS TO DO,
BY ELLA M. SEXTOM.
Golden-hair busy with blocks and toys.
For a kiss I'm wooing and suing;
But he frowns and lisps In his baby way:
"Dere's too many fings Is doing,"
As he bends his dimpled shoulders anew
To that task relentless of Things to Do.
Scarce twelve months twain has the
baby known â
Faic, blossom cherished dearlyâ
Yet me" shadow of gloomy .are has crept
Into Love's garden clearly.
How boldly he grasps Eve's heritage, too,
That primitive curse of Things to Do!
'Tis the daily treadmill of iif,> for all.
Where we labor reluctant, sighing.
While "Work or perish" still goads us
on â
Stern mandate there's no defying.
So. waking we toil, and in dreams pursue
An endless procession of Things to Do.
"What joys we miss, and what halcyon
hours
These sordid tasks denying;
The rose ungathered. the sunset tints
Each night's unnoticed dyingâ
As weary we pace Life's dull round
through
In the merciless clutch of Things to Do!
Ah, the peace and rest of that Arcady
Our starved lives might be holding.
With golden leisure for book or song.
Or the' artist's dream unfolding!
And the joy of Life could \vt banish, too.
Grim Care with his burikn of Things
to Do!
LITTLE WISEACRES
OF THE GARDENS
BY MABEL .S. HERMAN.
Does it not seem strange about the
flowers â how they know when spring
comes to put out their tiny green
leaves? The peach tree has little
heads, small and round, called buds.
But some bright morr.njs yo > will wfllv
in the garden and you will see that
these buds have gone away and have
left their little babies all alone. These
babies are the prettiest creatures under
the sun. They are all in beautiful pink
dresses. And you would laugh to see
the busy bees at work going from
flower to flower.
It is strange about the buds and flow
ers. How the buds can burst open and
send out blossoms that always are
pink â never blue nor any color save
pink. It is a wonder that they do not
forget. I wonder if any one could
make a seed.
Let us hurry over and see how queer
the berries are. Why don't the black
berries sometimes forget and bear a
cluster of raspberries? And why do
the violets wait until after sunrise to
open? And when we plant a flower
and wish it to climb up a fence, why
does it not run along the ground?
Now listen. A pumpkin vine was
once climbing upon a fence. As I was
walking by I heard a sweet voice say:
"Little girl, do you wish to know how
the pumpkin on this vine grew so fine?"
The owner of this vine is a farmer and
he is very cross. So I make him happy
by making the pumpkins the grandest
in the world. People come from far
and wide to get these pumpkins. He
made lots of money, and I think I will
let the vine die.
But all of a sudden the stable door
opened and the farmer came out with
a gentleman to get some pumpkins.
As soon as the little fairy saw the
farmer she turned herself into a beau
tiful pumpkin flower and I ran away.
Another day I went to see the vine, but
when I got there I saw that the vine
was all dried up.
THE NAUGHTY KITTEN.
BY GRACE M. TIPTON.
The table is set.
And no one is there
â¢ But pussy upon
The arm of a/chair.
Her eyes ope and shut
Like' grandpa's in church,
It's strange that she doesn't
Fall off of her perch.
On a plate near by.
The cake looks so nice.
Said she: "I must have
Just one little slice."
So stealthily now.
To get pome she goes
On the very tips
Of her velvet toes. .
Alas for pussy!
The slice is too big;
To eat it she'd have
To turn to a pig. .
It's only half gone,
She couldn't eat more; â¢
So she just leaves it
Down there on the floor.
Ten minutes later
The family came;
There sat Miss Pussy
Exactly the same.
Looking so peaceful,
Ten-lied high in the air.
Fast asleep on the
Smooth tftm of the chair.
LITTLE MISSIE
GOES A-FISHING,
BY EVA A. JONES.
Missie was a little girl who lived
down South on a plantation.
Missies joy. knew no bounds when
oi*e morniitg she found herself one in
a fishing party, and when given a line
and pin-hook she felt quite capable
of catching all the fish in the river.
But when the hook went down and
up, down and up without any fish,
and all around the lines were jerking
with the little fellows, her pride be
gan to fall.
Missie looked up about her. HÂ«r
father, mother, aunts and uncles were
all walking away with long lines of
fish to the rampfire.
"Oh, dear; what shall I do?" thought
Missie. "Here lam without one. Sup
posing I am a little girl; why shouldn't
I catch fish the same as mamma or Un
cle John?" Down went the hook and
up it came; no fish. Missies heart
sank very low. The tears came 1 rick
ling down her cheeks. Hope had fled.
"What de mattah \Â»ia dis chile?"
said the black nurse at her side. "Bin
a fishen yer all dis yer mornln' an' not
a single fish. Po'r chile."
"Pray de Lawd, honey. He all'as
helps de chilluns out in times ob trou
ble."
"All right," said Missie very solemn.
"I'll try." So again she threw the
hook over into the sparkling river; she
did not see it, though. She did not
even see the little fishes splash up with
both eyes closed.
Then the eyes came apart just a lit
tle at first to make sure. And then,
oh, my, such joy as there was in that
party. For Missies fish was by far
the largest caught that day.

BRAVE TEDDY AND JIM.
BY HELEN E. WRIGHT.
DON'T you want to buy a gffbd
dog for the Klondike? He's only
a dollar!"
The voice was a pathetic one,
and more than one man paused
for an amused second look at the pair
that stood by the gangplank.
The boy was about 12, 'though so
small he might easily have passed for
a child of nine. He had a pinched,
worried little face, and a pair of bright,
eager eyes. A hat several sizes too
large for him and a jacket as much too
small, a pair of men's trousers that
might have seen years of active serv
ice before they were cut over, and some
tattered little shoes, from which peeped
the inquisitive toes, completed his out-
The dog had but half outgrown his
puppyhood. He was a cur. A coarse,
rough coat of no particular color, a
thick stump of a tail, poorly cut ears
and a lame fore paw rendered him as
unattractive a puppy as ever escaped
the poundman. But, in Teddy's eyes,
no blue-ribboned favorite of the bench
show was ever half so beautiful
More than one tear had splashed
down on his rough head that morning
at the very thought of parting.
"Oh, I Just can't do it!" Teddy
sobbed. "I just can't. And yetâ
there's the babyâ" â Â , ,
"Jim's" warm pink tongue had licked
his little master's hand, and "Jim's"
soft, brown eyes had looked up, brim
ful of sympathy and love. And BO they
had come, these two, to the Pacific
street wharf, where a great steamer,
bound for Dawson City, lay tugging
at her moorings.
But "Jim!" Why, he had owned"Jim"
ever since he was a wee little blinking
puppy! He had shared his breakfast
and his dinner, and at night he had
cuddled with "Jim" in his arms to
sleep on the hard little bed! How could
he sell him? And Â»yet the little
sister was sick and somehow she could
not get well without a doctor. The
mother had had no work for so long,
and Teddy thought it all over and de
cided "Jim" must go.
From the lower deck came a chorus
of barks and whines from the poor,
homesick doggies. From the upper deck
greeting's and partings and last mes
sages from the prospectors, and, ming
led with all, the voices of the crew.
Still nobody wanted "Jim." At last all
was ready. The moorings were raised
and coiled, and amid cheers and the
nutter of handkerchiefs the big ship
floated slowly out of the dock, turned
and headed for the Golden Gate and
Alaska.
Singly or in groups the spectators
turned homeward, and only a few
stragglers were left. Teddy stood still
against one of the piles, where he had
been pushed in the last great hurry.
looking â looking! "Jim" whined and
licked his hand, but Teddy saw noth
ing but the vessel steaming away in
the distance. He strained his eyes in
the twilight tfil the last glimpse of her
faded, and then, with a little despair
ing cry, flung himself on the wharf and
sobbed his heart out, while "Jim"
whined in sympathy and leaned hard
against him, wagging his scraggy tail.
"Here, here, what's all this?" asked
a man's voice. "What's the matter,
little chap? Now, now; there, now!"
He was a big rough man, but he had
little boys of his own at home and knew
just how to manage them. Before lonjj
Teddy was rubbing his teaf-stained lit
tle face with a pair of grimy fists
and pouring out his whole story. One
by one bystanders gathered round. He
told them of the two little rooms he
called home; of his mother and how
hard she tried for work; of the little
sister who didn't get well, and how he
had tried to help, but nobody wanted
"Jim!"
He finished and more than one man
found there was something besides the
incoming fog that made his eyes grow
dim. A big man blew his nose vigor
ously and then took off his hat, "For
the little man and Jim," he said, and
they all understood.
Did you ever realize how it must feel
to be a millionaire? Well, Teddy knew
that night when they took him home,
for he had found in the warm hearts
of San Francisco a Klondike of his own.

ANDY CLUNIE
WAS ROASTED
Attorneys Goodfellow and
Garber Tell What They
Think About Him.
Close of the Argument on the
Motion to Restrain the
Commissioner
The Official's Action Declared to Be
Arbitrary and Totally Without
Sanction of Law.
The two days' argument on the appli
cation of the foreign insurance com
panies for an injunction against the j
threatened acts of Insurance Commis- ;
sioner Clunie came to an end yester- J
day in the United States Circuit Court
before Judge Morrow. John Garber j
and Mr. Goodfellow closed for the com- \
panics, and incidentally roasted Mr.
Clunie for his conduct in attempting
to drive millions of capital out of this J
State.
They contended that the alleged law
under which the Commissioner pre
tended to act had been declared uncon
stitutional, and that clunie had been j
guilty of bad faith by threatening to |
revoke the certificates of the companies j
and then coming before the court by |
his attorneys and denying that he had â¢
bo threatened.
Mr. Goodfellow said that Clunie had
calumniated and sullied the fair name
of the State. His action had been
arbitrary and without reason.
"How can you expect," asked the at- ;
torney, "English capitalists to come j
here and invest their money to assist I
us in developing the natural resources j
of this State when they are told that !
the laws are administered in such a !
way that the Insurance Commissjoner I
is allowed to discriminate between cor
porations, favoring some and oppress
ing others?"
With reference to the statement made ;
by Clunies lawyers that he never in- !
tended to revoke the certificates of the
foreign insurance companies, thespeak
er said that if such were the case he i
could not suffer if the court should ;
grant the injunction applied for, which
was to prevent him from doing that ;
which he said he never had intended to ;
do. Clunie was simply resorting to that
course for the purpose of evading the ,
process of the United States Circuit i
Court, and of forcing the companies to j
pay an illegal tax to the State.
"He has made threats publicly," add
ed the speaker. "He has advertised all :
through the State through his organ,
the Examiner, and witb a degree of as
surance I have never seen equaled he
states broadly that the purpose of mak
ing these companies give new bonds
was that his approval of them will de- 'â¢â 
pend upon whether they will pay this ;
tax or not. His action is iniquitous."
John Garber closed the argument and i
said that as the State of California,
construing the decision of the Supreme j
Court, never imposed that alleged con
dition upon the companies, Clunie had ;
â¢no right to impose it. He could not
decide that question of comity. Clunie ;
could not place himself in the position .
r-f the State. The Pfate had already de
cided that matter.
By what warrant of law, he asked, does
Clunie say "'I will refuse to accept any
of your bonds; I will order you to
leave the State unh-ss you comply
with this condition," which is no con
dition at all? He would have no more
right to do that than he would have
to say, "Unless you pay me ten thou
sand dollars I will drive you out of the
State."
"On what ground can he make him
self the Legislature of the State of Cal- j
ifnrnia?" asked Mr. Garber, " and say
'I entact and declare that in addition
to what is said in the statute this in- \
Eurance compact is illegal, and unless ;
you dissolve it I will drive you out of !
the Stale?' Clunie has arrogated to !
himself the right to pass another law
and say 'Unless you do this I will drive !
you out of the State.' "
Judge Morrow said that he would !
render a decision in the matter as soon !
as possible, which would be as soon as
he could have an opportunity of exam- j
ining the authorities submitted to him !
by the counsel on both sides.
Clarkson Arraigned.
William S. flarkson, ex-foreman of the
rolling department of the Mint, was ar
raigned before United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday on the charge
of embezzling gold bullion placed in his
charge. He pleaded not guilty and was
allowed the usual time of five days in
which to change his plea should he so de
sire.
Clarkson's attorney moved to reduce the
ball from $5000, but the application was
refused.

THE MODERN
HIGH SCHOOL
Pnotessor Brown Talks
of Its History in
America.
A Plea for the Introduction of
Debating Into the Public
Schools.
The Practice of Marking Defended
Against the Objections of Recent
Pedagogical Critics.
Professor Elmer E. Brown, in a lec
ture before a teachers" class at the
State University yesterday morning,
gave an outline of the beginning of the
modern high schocri. He said in sub
stance:
The high school is more characteristic
of modern times than were the grammar
school or academy. The first school of
the true high school type was the Kng
lish High School of Boston. '1 ne name
high school hart been used before, but for
Institutions that were really seminaries
or academies, rather than high schools in
the modern sense of the word. On the
other hand, many schools of this type
went by different names. The term
"union school" was often applied and is
often applied even yet. This name indi
cates the origin of the schools, which
were graded schools, resulting from the
union of school districts. As the graded
school grew out of a union of districts,
the high school grew out of the graded
system.
In 1821 Boston first had a system of
primary schools. Strange as it may seem
it ls hfstorically true that dear old Bos
ton had got well over into the nineteenth
century before she had a system of pri
mary schools, ln fact, all over the coun
try we have been painfully slow in estab
lishing a good system of primary educa
tion In 1825 Boston established a high
school for girl*. The experiment was
quickly dropped at the end of a year, be
cause "it was such a success. The school
during its brief existence was crowded,
and the school board saw that the ex
pense would be so great that they could
not afford the experiment. In brief,
the school was closed because it was too
costly, and It was too costly because it
was too popular.
Professor Brown spoke briefly of the
movement toward the establishment of
universities. He declared that this
1 movement was influenced strongly by
; the famous decision in the Dartmouth
: College case, in which the inviolability
! of a private charter was maintained,
and the principle of non-interference
by the State with private educational
corporations established.
T. L. Heaton defended the practice
lof marking in the public schools. He
said:
Marking has been much decried of late,
and largely, I think, because the practice
:is an old one. I believe that a thing is
not necessarily bad merely because it has
been done before, and I regard marking
' as one of the good features of older meth
: ods of teaching. It is often objected that
i the pupils should bo taught not to work
; for marks but for knowledge. True, but
is it true that the child cannot work for
: both at the same time?
Marking is the best way of indicating
to the pupil the teacher's approbation. A
certain American university vigorously
'â  opposes marking; yet in the register of
this university every professor has his
: complete list of honors and degrees print
!ed after his name. What inconsistency!
: Children, like older people, like to be glv
â â  en credit for what they do. Nothing indi
cates better than marking the extent to
which a pupil's work has bee.n successful.
Mr. Heaton strongly recommended
the practice of having debates in the
higher grammar grades. "A child," he
said "should have something to say
and be able to say it. Debating gives
practice in speaking and practice in
composition. It is best to begin by
having the debaters write out their pa
pers and then read them. Afterward
the pupils may be allowed to speak
from notes.
"The habit of arbitrarily choosing
sides is, I believe, a pernicious one.
Teach the children honesty; never
choose sides for the pupils, but let
them speak as they wish. Assign sides
at first, but as the pupils study the
question, if they change their minds,
let them change sides, and even if there
should be three on one side to one on
the other it is better than to Inculcate
dishonesty in the children's minds.
Not only should the language of the de
bater be criticized, but he should be
held down strictly to facts, and not be
allowed to make wild and unauthorized
statements that are so common in many
debating societies."
The speaker concluded by emphasiz
ing the importance of nature study as
a part of the public school curriculum.
"Nature study* has come into our
schools, and has come to stay," he de
clared. "It has come to stay because of
the training it gives and the knowledge
it contains. Nature study is not a fad,
and in the next few years there will be
a growing demand for expert nature
teachers."
State Superintendent of Public In
struction Samuel T. Black will lecture
on the "Public School System of Cali
fornia" before Professor Brown's class
In pedagogy next Monday morning at
10:20 o'clock at North Hall.
SUPREME JUSTICES DIFFER.
Conflicting Views Relative to a
Wife's Loan or Gift.
The Justices of the Supreme Court
handed down a decision yesterday, the
most striking feature of which was the
wide difference of opinion of those who
passed upon the merits of the case.
Jane Warren, the wife of W.Â» H. War
ren, brought an action against her hus
band to recover $6000 alleged to have been
loaned to him by her. She secured a judg
ment for the amount and subsequently
died pending further proceedings, and W.
H. White, the executor of her will, acted
in her stead. At the trial Mrs. Warren
established a prima facie case. Warren
introduced some evidence to show that
the money was a gift and not a loan. The
lower court Instructed tho jury to line! a
verdict for the plaintiff, holding that
while the. parties to the action were hus
band and wife, it devolved upon the for
mer, who claimed to have received the
gift, to prove that such gift was made
without undue influence on his part, the
presumption being that, in the absence
of proof to the contrary, such undue in
fluence was used.
Upon this principle of law as laid down
the Supreme Justices differed. Justices
Garoutte, Van Fleet, Henshaw, Temple
and Harrison, as a majority of the su
preme tribunal, affirmed the judgment of
the lower court, but Justice McFarland
wrote a dissenting opinion, in which he
held that "The court peremptorily in
structed the jury to find for the plaintiff;
and in my opinion It ought to have been
left to the jury to determine whether or
not the money sued for was a loan or a
gift. â¢ â¢ â¢ The question here was
not whether a certain transaction was a
loan or a gift."
Street Railway Changes.
The work on the Eighth street electric
road Is expected to be completed in about
three weeks. The road will then run
from Market to Townsend street, and
will transfer to all cross lines. To-mor
row the steam road running from Stan
yan street to the ocean will be replaced
by the electric road, on which work has
been in progress for a long time past.
It is thought that the new line will be
in working condition about May 1, when
it will begin to carry passengers. In a
short time the San Mateo Electric Road
will begin the construction of a double
track from Guerrero street to Twin
Peaks, from where there is already a
double line running to the park.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The Miners' Association
to Give Legislation
a Boost.
More Old Mines Becoming New
and Greatâ Buying, Selling,
Digging and Finding.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the California Miners' Association
has been called by Secretary Julian
Sonntag for next week, to take Import
ant action In assistance of pending min
ing legislation in Congress.
The meeting was chiefly called at the
instance of Tirey L. Ford, who, as chair
man of the California and Trans-Missis
sippi Congress committees in a depart
ment of mines and mining, is very actively
interested In that measure. Word has
been received that Hon. Lafe Pence, j
chairman of the similar committee ap- j
pointed by the International Gold Min
ers' convention at Denver, who is in the
East, has abandoned the hope of the
miners securing a Cabinet officer to look j
after the industry, and is devoting his
energies to the next best thing, a bu
reau of mines in the Interior Depart
ment, with a Commissioner of Mines and
Mining at its head. The executive com
mittee, at its meeting, will decide
whether or not to likewise abandon the
larger measure for the present and join
in Mr. Pence's efforts. This will prob
ably be done. Mr. Ford has telegraphed
to Mr. Pence to communicate a full ac
count of the situation as it appears to
him, and this report Is expected to ar
rive before the date of the meeting. The
mineral lands bills and other matters
will also be considered.
A bill creating an executive Depart
ment of Mines and Mining was intro
duced by Congressman Barham in Janu
ary, but it slumbers in a committee
pigeonhole. To secure its passage
would be difficult at best, while a de
partment bureau would be more readily
given.
"I believe," says Tlrey L. Ford, "that if
we could have had two or three wide
awake men pushing it at Washington we
could have secureu a Cabinet officer. All
the Congressional representation from
this side of the Mississippi is for it, and
this constitutes one-third of the Senate
and an influential portion of the House.
The commercial interests are after a de
partment of commerce and industry, and
we might have got into the same wagon
by joining influence. If we can't get it
we would better take half a loaf."
The old Grizzly mine In Tuolumne Coun
ty, which has oeen reopened during the
last year under a working bond, has been
purchased by the new company bearing
its name, and is to be developed on a
large scale, says the Grass Valley Union.
The owners are mostly San Franciscans,
and at the first annual meeting of the
stockholders last week they elected as
president William C. Murdock of the
Commercial Bank; as vice president, W.
E. Brown of the Crocker-Woolworth
Bank, and as directors, W. H. Martin of
the mining firm of Martin & Ballard,
Otto Greenwald and R. E. Russell, in ad
dition to the officers named. At the same
time a contract was made with William
Sharwood for the erection on the prop
erty of a twenty-stamp mill, a hoist, air
compressors atid all of the necessary
buildings for the working of the mine, at
an outlay of 520,000. A new shaft has
been sunk In the Grizzly to a depth of 350
feet, and at the 200 level a drift has been
run a distance of 180 feet north to the
old works, from which, previous to 1872.
when the property was closed down, a
million dollars had been taken. The vein
is very strong ribbon quartz, eight feet
wide, which mailed $8 to the ton, while at
the 300 level similar results were obtained.
It Is estimated that the mine has been
sufficiently opened to run the twenty
stamps for three years, but. neverthe
less, the board of directors has decided to
continue the sinking of the shaft. Thus
far about $13.00" has been expended in the
rehabilitation of the Grizzly.
Further details regarding the fifty
stamp custom mill to be built immediate
ly at Barstow by the people of the J^*nÂ«p
burg railroad :\r<- given by J. P. Nevins of
the Denver Iron Works as follows: ' Inls
plant, when completed, will represent all
features of modern appliances for quick
and perfect methods for handling ores.
The mill proper will contain fifty stamps
of 950 pounds each and have ninety drops
per minute, capable of crushing from 100
to 200 tons of ore per day. A system of
I twelve Frue vanners will be put in to take
care of all the tailings for concentrates.
Automatic feeders will be attached to the
motors, with the ore crushers above the
bins, making the process of handling ores
an economic feature. The power plant
consists of one Corliss 200-horsepower en
gine and two steel boilers of HX)-horst>pow
er each. The mill will be equipped with a
full electric lighting plant, the wires ex
tending to all parts of the camp. The mill
is about 1000 feet from the Mojave River
and on the railroad. The mill will con
sume about 200,000 gallons of water each
twenty-four hours, which will be supplied
from wells In which water is obtained at
about twenty-four feet from the surface.
The company Is now sinking, wells in
which an abundance of water is found.
The plant, with sampling works, crushers
and rolls, will Vie ready to run about May
15. The plans of the company are so ma
tured that they expect to treat $7 ore.
which will i.ri.vc a lasting beÂ»efit to
mines around Randsburg."
A notable mining suit, known as the
Morse-Heinze case, is now being tried in
the United States court at Butte, Mont.
Of course the issue hinges upon "extra
lateral rights, â¢' that wonderfully fruitful
source of long decisions and big lawyers'
fees. The Western Mining World enter
tainingly comments on the case as fol
lows:
"While the views of thirty odd experts
as to the geoiogy of this section, with
its veins, zones and ore bodies, and the
fantastic gyrations of our innumerable
dips, spurs and angles, will prove of more
or less interest to mining men, it Is a
lamentable fact tnat expensive and long
drawn-oui. litigation promises to become
one of the principal industries ol this
city.
"The present suit is to be followed by
others, and these unfortunate disagree
ments will hardly be settled before the
crack of doom. Millions are involved in
these cases, and they represent the con
tests of giants. When the United States
Supreme Court shall have finally dove-
I tailed all differences into a definite ex
j pression of justice there will have been
a wonderful contribution to the mining
literature of the world. As educators the
litigants will have rendered invaluable
service to mining men. not only in the
matter of mining detail as brought out
by expert testimony, but in the greater
and broader sense of teaching them to
settle their differences outside of court."
All over the mining regions of the
State are districts to which attention is
\ turning in an effective way for the first
time and in which mining develop
ment is just beginning. From out-of-the
way corners of mining counties come fre-
q uent tales like this from a correspond-
I ent of the Democratic Banner of Sonora:
"There is quite an interest taken in min
ing in and around Blanket Creek. Sev
eral parties, with a view of bonding, have
been around recently. Land & Burchard
made a clean-up in their arastra and
I their ore went $30 per ton. This will be
| a surprise to many to think $20 ore has
been sticking out of the ground until this
! late hour. This is a section of country
that has not been prospected much, and
in fact, is very little known of in min
ing circles. It is a true mineral belt, or
a spur from the great east belt, running
very nearly east and west, connecting
with the east belt near the Buchanan
j mine."
The Schaffer mine, near the Providence,
Tuolumne County, is giving evidence of
great value. The vein is five feet wide,
the gold appearing exclusively in the
sulphurets, which assay $1600 per ton, ac
cording to report.
Reports have been frequent enncern
i ing the splendid character of ore en
j countered in one of the Snell group of
mines, Tuolumne County, operated by
John T. Newcomer. It is reported that
the ledge suddenly widened and from
! milling tests made runs from $270 to $300
per ton.
The Eagle Bird mine at Maybest, Ne
vaiiu ('.unity, lias finally been transferred
I to an English syndicate, which has taken
! possession. Of this mjjae the Grass Val-
I ley i. nion says: "In the past history
! of the mine as much as $200,000 has been
! offered for it and refused, and very late
\ ly an important strike of very rich ore
has been made, crosscutting to the vein
j on the sixth level, proving the exten
; sion downward of the richest ore chute
and adding at least $50,0u0 in value to
the mine. This property will surely again
take its place as one of the lep.ding pro
; ducers of Nevada County, as the new
: company will spend much muney In thor
oughly prospecting it."
A $20,000 pocket is reported to have been
I unearthed in the old Washington mine at
French Gulch, Shasta County, In which
i deeper development has" been going on
: recently.
The Silver King Mining and Milling
I Company, which owns silver properties
near Calico, San Bernardino County, has
collapsed. Last week a judgment for
$11,500 was given by default, and eighteen
liens still lie against the property.
It is given oui that the Argonaut mine.
I Amador County, will declare its lirst divi
dend of 10 cents a share, amounting to
$20,000. This is from the profits of the
I lirst three months' run, after paying all
i expenses, including the cost of the mill.
At the Crystal Peak mine, Butte Coun
ty, twenty-five men are employed, and
the ledge is now from six to seven feet
! wide, and is very promising.
Very rich rock has been struck in the
i Miller mine, in the vicinity of Powelton,
Butto County.
Howard Avery and Pembrook Murray
of Enterprise, Butte County, have bought
the Bright Star and the Litttle Monarch
mining claims near that place, with the
] two-stamp mill.
A Chicago woman has gone into mining
in Amador County with bold enterprise,
and as though she knew her business.
The Amador Ledger says: "A complete
new deal has been effected in regard to
the Bellwether mine which augurs well
for the north end of Jackson and for the
town. Tuesday night Mrs. Mary J. Hep
burn, widow of the late John W. Hep
burn, came from Chicago with her at
torney, Edward Logan Reeves. The deal
was completed in Judge Davis' office on
the folowing basis: The purchase price
in the mine was $98,600, $2600 being paid
to Mr. Bright In cash Tuesday evening,
and the remaining payments to be made
in accordance with an agreement now on
record in the County Recorder's office,
but similar in terms lo the one previously
held by the Bellwether Mining Company.
Mrs. Hepburn and her friends intend to
immediately open -he mine in a system
atic manner and to open the shaft to
develop it, instead of taking up further
time with surface developments."
William H. Myers recently bonded his
mining claims In El Dorado County, for
merly the Lloyd properties, to F. H. Hall
of San Francisco. Mr. Hall and others
i have filed incorporation papers for $1 000 -
I 000, and $5000 has been subscribed for de-
I velopment work. Mr. Hall will be general
I manager and R. A. McPherson superin
tendent. The Incorporation is the Hall
Consolidated Mining Company.
A. M. Drew has bonded two Tuolumne
County mines, which will be developed.
One Is at Tuttletown and the other near
Groveland.
At the Morning Star gravel mine the
company has sixty-live men on the pay
roll. The Morning Star has been one of
the largest bullion producers of the State.
I The dividend for March was No. 87. The
I main bedrock tunnel is now in consider
j ably over 4000 feet. The gravel is crushed
| by a ten-stamp mill, which runs steadily.
About a hundred cars of gravel are mined
during each twenty-four hours. The Jan
uary cleanup from the Morning Star was
on exhibit at the recent Mining Fair. It
weigheVl 1555.94 ounces and was valued at
125.754 70.â Colfax Sentinel.
The Jupiter Consolidated Gravel Mining
Company, which owns one and one-half
i miles of channel near lowa Hill, will be
gin active development work within sixty
days.
Benjamin A. Buckxnan of Placer County
has sailed for Korea, where he will have
! charge of some of the gravel mining op
; erations for which J. Sloat Fassett of
New York has secured large concessions.
According to the Democratic Banner of
Sonora. the Big Oak mine, situated in the
j Groveland district, is showing up to the
pleasing surprise of the Tuolunane Devel
opment Company. This company is com
posed of Fresno capitalists, and N.
W. Moody is president. The vein is of an
enormous size and yields gold free and in
sulphurets.
! Actual construction of the Stockton and
' Tuolumne road is promised to begin at
Stockton within a few days, and the pros
pect for success in this enterprise which
will moan a good deal to the mining in
terests of a large section grows brighter
daily, 'i.ie first section will be bunt to
Copperopolis, and the reopening of the
large copper mines there and the develop
ment of other mining properties will soon
follow. A similar stimulus will be given
to the east belt of the mother lode in
Tuolumne County when the line reaches
its final destination.
The Echo of Angels Camp, Calayeras
County, contributes this item of mining
progress: "Air. Baumhogger, owner of
the Great Western mine in this town, in
lurms us that he is now making prepara
tions to add five more stamps to nis mill,
making the full capacity ten. He also
states that the ore in the mine is get
ting richer as developments are made,
and that the vein increases in width as
depth is attained. Recent explorations
have made it necessary to increase the
present milling facilities. The last clean
up was immense."
The Red Dog hydraulic mine, Nevada
County, which recently secured a permit
to operate from the California Debris
Commission, is now running at full
blast behind its restraining dams, and it
is reported that nuggets "as big as hens'
eggs" are being taken out at times.
It is likely that the California mine, |
which is situated four miles from Gran- I
iteville and seven miles from Washing
ton, will soon pass to the ownership of
an Eastern company. The present own
ers are Colonel Tozer, Charles D. Lane
and others. They bonded the property
some time ago to a New York syndicate
represented by Dana Harmon, the re
ported price being $50,000. The bond was
to have expired on the 10th inst., but an
extension to the Ist of April has been
obtained. Under the superintendency of
Mr. Harmon there has been expended
about $100,000 in opening up the property,
and the operations have been attended
with the best results. A magnificent
mine has been developed. The ore de
posit is very large and of good quality.
It is expected that in the spring thirty
more stamps will be added to the ten
now in use.â Nevada City Transcript.
A deed of a mining claim has been filed
in San Bernardino, wherein Gay W.
Brown of Los Angeles, for the sum of
$25,000, conveys to the Colorado and Cali

During 1597 the quicksilver exports from
San Francisco included 3890 flasks to
Mexico anil 1445 flasks to Central Amer

The mining interests of Southern Ore- '
eon are suffering with California from i
the lack of rain. According to the Ore
eon Aiming Journal the mining sea- j
son in Southern Oregon has so far been ;
a source of great disappointment to the
olacer miners. The present weather is
unprecedented within the memory of the !
oldest inhabitant. There have been dry
spells before, but not such a long spell
of dry weather as has existed for several I
months There will yet be some rain;
hut hardly enough to guarantee half the
amount of gold usually yielded by the '
sluice-boxes.
