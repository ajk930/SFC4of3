SLEDGE ISLAND PASSED.
But ths Revenue Cutter Puts In at
Capo Vanoouver and Leaves
the Overland Rescuers.
By Lieut. J. G. Berry, U. S. R. M.
UNALASKA, Alaska, Dec. 23, 1597
(Via Seattle, Feb. 13).â The overland
expedition for the relief of the whalers
imprisoned in the Arctic ice has been
landed, and is now tramping through
the snow on the long trail to Point Bar
row. Since the childhood of mankind
itself Santa Clans has started, year
after year, at this season to bring glad
ness from the frozen north, where little
gladness is. Unmindful he must be that
charity begins at home. But we must
not blame him for that, especially since
we are one and all under so deep obli
gation to him since our own childhood.
Now, however, in this enlightened age,
we are beginning to reciprocate his
kindness. And it is fitting that the
United States of America, herself a
child among nations, should be the
first to attempt to repay the debt which
for age after age has covered but one
Bide of the ledger.
The revenue steamer Bear is back at
Unalaska, unharmed and ready to fol
. low in its track, when the summer sun
A shall clear a way through the ice to
â  the Arctic Ocean. All on board are
â  well although somewhat depressed by
the prospect of a dreary winter and
spring in the comparative solitude of
: Alaska. Until this enterprise hove
: above the horizon we had planned so
v. pleasantly on enjoying the comforts of
the hospitable Pacific slope after the
long summer spent in chasing pelagic
sealers in Bering Sea or In watching
over and aiding those same -whalers
and their brothers in the Arctic. But
we have done all that can now be done
until June or July, and the rest is prac
tically dull idleness. You may think
we ought to be supremely happy to
have such a long rest. Just try it some
time.
As I informed you in my last letter
we arrived at Unalaska on December
9. We landed there all of the extra
stores destined for the whalers which
had hitherto cumbered our decks and
even taken up space ordinarily reserved
for coal. >> c also turned over to the
Mission school the boxes of Christmas
presents for the little Aleuts, which
presents had been sent by the children
of the Pacific Coast.
That night ;<e left the wharf there
and went around to Dutch Harbor,
where we began as soon as possible the
next morning to get our coal and water
on board. We took in enough coal to
bring the total up to three hundred
tons. We freshened the water in the
boiler and then filled all our tanks
with fresh water. To be sure we have
a coil for distilling salt water so that it
Is good to drink. But that takes coal
for evaporating the salt water and coal
is very valuable when you once get
etuck In the ice. For at that time we
more than half expected such an ex-
perience. The water ran but slowly
and it was fully 11 o'clock at night be
fore the last tank was full. Then, to
avoid sailing on Friday perhaps as
much as anything else. Captain Tuttle
waited until 1:35 in the morning. At
that time, December 11, we cast off
from the wharf at Dutch Harbor and
steamed out into Bering Sea.
Our good luck, which has followed us
clear from Cape Flattery, did not de
pert us now. The wind came, strong
and fair, from the southward and east-
ward, and with all sail set, the old
Bear broke into a steady lope toward
the North, leaving between ten and
eleven knots behind her evÂ»Â»ry hour.
The aim was to sight Nunlvak, the
large island off the Yukon delta, but
the horizon was not clear when we
reached the nearest point to the island,
and we passed by without seeing it. So
northward we went. Nothing but sky
and water was in sight until the 13th
at a quarter to one in the afternoon.
Then for the first time I noticed that
the surface of the sea was beginning
to be covered here and there with slick
places, as if oil had been spilled over
board and had spread out. The waves
did not break in these places, and as
they became more thickly gathered to
gether, the whole surface of the sea
>-was perceptibly calmed. Soon It be
f came apparent that this was very fine
ice. I reported the circumstance to the
captain, and he and several of the other
officers came out on deck to observe it
and to look out for other and more
formidable signs.
At 1:10 p. m. we saw the first lump
Pf ice, floating. in the midst pf one- of

those patches of scum. At 1:22 Jarvis
sighted St. Lawrence Island, and soon
we could make out the outlying rocks
thereof. They were covered with mow
and shore ice stretched from one to
another. To leeward of them, that is
to the northward, detached cakes of
ice were floating out to join a cluster
of dazzling, white islands, bobbing up
and down with the waves of Bering
Sea.
The temperature of the air had fallen
since we had got near the land, so that
it was now between 30 and 32 Fahren
heit. The sea water showed a temper
ature of 29 and 30, almost down to the
freezing point of salt water, which is
28. By 3 or 3:30 the Bear was well in
the ice, encountering cake after cake of
it. It was soft and mushy, but no one
knew how far it might extend, and,
moreover, if it were possible to reach
Sledge Island, who knew if the Bear
could get near enough to the hard
shore ice to make a landing? For there
might be floating Ice extending for
miles outside the grounded cakes. Per
haps the whole Bering Bea to the
northward of us was a mass of ice. So,
at 4:45 p. m., the Bear turned and stood
to the southward, hoping to find a fa
vorable place to land near the mouth
of the Yukon.
The Bear, fitted especially for work
in the ice, has a steam pipe leading to
each opening through the bottom of the
ship, so that they may be thawed out
should they become clogged with ice.
At 10:30 p. m. on the 14th a plug in the
pipe leading to one of these outboard
connections blew out. The fire-room
and engine-room immediately filled
with steam. Nothing could be seen,
even if the stationary lamps had not
gone out. Mr. Bryan, who was on
watch, could not tell but what the boil
er or main steam pipe had given way.
Finally, by means of a lantern, aided
by the sound of escaping steam, the
leak was found and the steam shut off,
but not before all engaged in the search
had got thoroughly wet and somewhat
scalded.
At 9 a, m. December 15, land was
sighted to the eastward, and the ship
stood slowly in toward it, sounding as
she went, for the water was shoal. At
3:20 p. m. we rounded Cape Vancouver,

expedition, in winter quarters at Unalaska, Alaska.
To Hon. John D. Spreckels, San Francisco Call, San
Francisco, Cal. â SIR: We, the warrant officers and crew
of the United States Arctic relief steamer Bear, wish to
testify our appreciation of the generosity of the San
Francisco Call and of your thoughtfulness for our comfort
in this bleak and desolate country of Alaska. Not only
did you call the attention, First of all men, to the suffer
ings of the imprisoned whalers, but by supplying us, who
have volunteered to rescue them, with the comforts as
well as the necessaries of life, you have served the inter
ests of humanity almost as well as in the first instance.
Very respectfully,

the eastern end of Nelson Island to
the south of the Yukon delta-
Then we s Jeered to the northward
and eastward, looking for a village â
there are two of them on the chart
there â from which the expedition
might be started. For the dogs which
we had brought from Unalaska were
not trained, and although they would
have to be trained as they went, pro
vided no others were obtainable, it
would be ever so much better to get
from the Eskimos dogs that had done
the work before. Now, for an hour or
so, the temperature of the air and
water as well fell to 24 degrees F., well
below the freezing point of salt water
and new ice was forming, thin but
hard, inside between the thicker but
soft ice and the land.
At 3:50 we sighted a village, found
afterward to be Tunumak, and at 4:15
the Bear anchored in Hazen Bay,
about eight miles from the village, to
wait for daylight. All that night the
ice went by us, drifting with the tide
at the rate of three knots per hour at
its strongest. Then as the tide turned,
back it all came. Sometimes it swept
off shore, outside of us; again it would
swerve in and envelop the vessel. The
thin new. ice had melted by this time
as the temperature of the water rose
to 29 and 30 degrees. But the wind
came down in the heaviest kind of
squalls from the mountain tops.
On the 16th at 8:45 a. m., we got un
der way and stood in a little way
toward the village, and at 9:20 an
chored. Hardly was the anchor down
when two kayaks were seen coming
toward the ehlp. They bone off coyly
and would not come too near us. The
craft apparently held but one man
each. I say "apparently," because
frequently a kayak will come from a
long distance and the man will get out.
Presently, from one end of the craft
a squaw will emerge, then two or
three children will make their appear
ance. Finally some dried fish, their
staple food, is brought out, and the
observers wonder, just as when a
magician hauls yard after yard of rib
bon from his mouth. Then Lieutenant
Jarvis went ashore to see if it were prac
ticable to land. Meanwhile a two
hatch bidarke had come over from
Tunumak to the Cape Vancouver
beach. A half-breed trader in this
craft told Jarvis that he was going to
St. Michael in a day or two. He ex
pected to reach the settlement in ten
days and the overland expedition
might go with him. This was un
expected luck. Allowing for two days
to get ready, that would bring them
into St. Michael by December 28. As
the whole Yukon delta is, so far as the
charts tell us, a trackless waste, there
is no knowing Just what direction the
guide would take. But following the
villages as shown In the chart, the dis
tance from Cape Vancouver to St. Mich
ael, cannot be less than 240 miles. Con
sidering the nature of ground and the
reputed fact that the rivers are not yet
fully frozen over ten days seems only
too short. I doubt if they got to the
end of this, the first stage of their
journey, before the 10th of January.
Of course Jarvis was delighted at this
good luck at the very outset of the
undertaking, and upon hia return to
the ship preparations were at once be
gun for landing the expedition.
Accordingly at 10:30 o'clock Bertholf
shoved off with one boatload of gear.
Shortly after the second boat with
Jarvis, Dr. S. J. Call and F. Koltchoff,
who has lived in this part of the coun
try for some years, left the ship with
most of the rest of the outfit. I went
with this boat. Brown w-as not going
to send any officer to bring back the
boat, but I wanted to see Bertholf at
the last moment. Besides that, so long
as they would not let me go in the
overland expedition, I wanted to have
a* juui-h fun as I could with the fellows
that were going. So I prevailed on him
to let me go.
Bertholf went sailing along merrily
until he got opposite the place selected
for the landing. When he found him
self down to leeward he dowsed his
sail and pulled to the shore. It was
blowing a gale and the sails on both
boats were reefed, with the sprit out.
We had not much more than gotten
clear of the ship in our boat before the
mast went over the side, taking with it
the thwart in which it was stepped.
So we had to row the whole two miles
to the shore, mostly against the wind.
The spray dashed over the boat until
the crew and Mr. Koltchoff, who were
dressed in the clothing furnished by the
San Francisco Examiner, were wet to
the skin. But the rest of us, clothed in
the fur parkays and trousers given us
by The Call, were as dry as a bone.
Koltchoff made several remarks unsuit
ed to the climate, and, since he also
had the fur clothes from The Call,
although he had not chosen to wear
them as yet, I could not feel so sorry
for him as I might have done. Bertholf
had unloaded his boat and sent it back
to the ship before we reached the
beach. When we arrived he was stand
ing in the midst of a pile of goods and

SAN JOSE'S
BIG BATTLE
FOR FREEDOM
Thorough Organization to
Secure an Honest
Government.
Under the Banner of the New
Charter Club the Citizens
Will Drive Boodiers From
the City.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 13.â Aroused to ac
tion by a realization of the wide-spread
corruption that exists in the adminis
tration of municipal affairs the best
citizens of the city of San Jose have
organized for the overthrow of the men
who seek public office for the benefits
that they may secure for themselves,
for their relatives and their friends.
How thoroughly the corrupt political
gang has control of every department
of the city and county governments and
how inconceivably corrupt are the men
and methods of this band of boodlers
have been brought home to the citizens
by the exposures made in The Call dur
ing the past few months. This is ad
mitted by every decent and reputable
resident of San Jose and of Santa Clara
County.
The city election is only about seven
weeks ahead, and the people see in this
event their way to pure and economical
municipal administration. An organi
zation has already been effected and
plans have been formulated which are
designed to place the reins of San Jose's
government in such hands that this
city will in the future be held up as a
modal of all that is desirable and com
mendable in municipal government.
In this grand and noble work for the
public welfare are enlisted many of the
most wealthy, influential and promi
nent citlzenE., They have joined hands
under the banner of the New Charter
Club, which was instrumental, more
than any other influence, in securing
the adoption of the present charter for
San Jose, an instrument acknowledged
to be one of the best ever approved by
the Legislature of the State.
The officers of the club are as fol
lows: President, H. E. Schilling; vice
president, J. P. Jarman; secretary, D.
M. Burnett; financial secretary, J. J.
Southeimer; treasurer, T. Ellard Beans.
Schilling is an ex-Mayor and ex-Coun
cilman of San Jose, and is known as one
of the strongest anti-gang men in the
community. During his term of office
he was always found on the side of the
people despite the desperate efforts of
the gangsters to whip him into their
camp by tricks and threats. Jarman is
also an ex-Councilman and his record
is one that ensures him the confidence
of the people under all circumstances.
Burnett is an attorney and has the good
government movement greatly at heart.
He has been ready at all times to give
the benefit of his advice to the leaders
of the movement and always with good
results. Beans is the president of the
Bank of San Jose and no man stands
higher in the community in every re
spect. Southeimer is an ex-County
Clerk of this county and in that posi
tion showed that he was worthy of any
political trust and honor that might
be conferred upon him.
Part of the organization of the club
comprises two constitutional commit
tees. One of these is the advisory com
mittee, of which T. A. Carroll is chair
man. This committee deals with the
policy of the club, but its functions are
simply advisory. It is composed of fif
teen members. It also decides the man
ner in which the campaign shall be
carried on, has power to appoint sub
ordinate committees and arrange pre
cinct organization. The other commit
tee is the finance committee. This con
sists of eleven members, and its chair
man is C. M. Wooster. These two com
mittees, with the president of the club,
comprise what is called the nominating
committee, before which the names of
all candidates for the several offices
to be filled in the coming election are
placed for consideration. After the
committee has made its selection the
name is submitted to the club for the
approval of the members themselves.
Should the name be unacceptable the
committee is so informed. It is its
duty then to submit other names until
the approval of the club Is secured.
It is the avowed purpose of the club
to place a full ticket in the field for the
election for city officers to be held on
April 11. At that time the people will
elect a Mayor, Treasurer. City Clerk,
five Councilmen and an Appointing
Board of fifteen members. The great
fight will be on the Mayor and the
Appointing Board. The latter will have
the duty to perform of appointing a
Board of Health, Board of Education,
Board of Free Public Library Trustees,
Board of Park Commissioners and
Board of Police and Fire Commission
ers. Each of these boards is to consist
of five members. It is the great powers
thus placed in the hands of the Ap
pointing Board that will make it one
of the chief bones of contention. The
Mayor is also a member of this board,
and it requires eight votes to make an
appointment.
Every person Is eligible to member
ship in the New Charter Club who is
against the present gang rule, and who
has no affiliation in any manner with
the gangsters and boodlers. The great
est care will bo exercised to. exclude}
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
those who are known to have any con*
nection with the ring of corruptioniÃts,
and even more caution will be used to
see that none but persons absolutely
free from even the taint of the gang
are nominated for any of the city offi
ces. The New Charter Club is organized
on an absolutely non-partisan basis,
and former party affiliation will not be
allowed to enter into any question un
der consideration. Every effort and
sacrifice, if necessary, will be made to
maintain harmony in the ranks of the
club, as it is fully realized that victory
can only come by united and energetic
action. As showing the non-partisan
character of the organization it may be
stated that the chairman of the finan
cial committee is a Republican, while
the chairman of the advisory commit
tee is a Democrat. All parties are also
equitably represented in the personnel
of bath these committees.
The officers of the club state that
they intend to place a ticket in the field
! that will meet with the approval of the
people from top to bottom, and that
there will not be a single man on the
New Charter Club ticket for whom it
I will be necessary to apologize. They
! say their idea is to put up such a ticket
| that whoever wants good and econom
| ical government will be able to vote the
| club ticket straight from top to bottom.
i Only well-known men of established in
' tpgrity in business and private aflairÂ»
i will be placed on the ticket.
The club now has a membership of
! about 250, and it is growing at~the rate
of 100 each week. The nominations
made by the club will be given to the
public in about three weeks, and cer
tainly not later than four weeks from
this writing. The reason for announc
ing the ticket so early is to give any
element that Is not satisfied with the
nominations of the club ample oppor
tunity to place other candidates In tha
field.
Under the old charter there was no
salary attached to the position of coun
cilman, and the Mayor received only
$600 a year. Under the present Instru
ment the councilmen get each $300 a
year, and the Mayor's compensation is
$2000 a year. This matter of salary, It
Is believed, will be an additional In
ducement to good men to accept the
honors of those offices, but will also be
a further incentive for the boodle gang
sters and their heelers to make desper
ate efforts to defeat the decent and re
spectable people.
The work of the New Charter Club
is not to be confined altogether to
matters pertaining directly to the ap
proaching election. There is a special
committee of ten. whose duty It Is to
see that all the provisions of the new
charter are being carried out by the
official Incumbents and to prevent or
punish violations of the charter and of
the laws. Two injunction suits brought
by the club against the council to pre

will take action to have the accused

upon which to base such action exists.
Every move made by the club is in
tended to demonstrate to the people
that the movement it is back of and
the candidates whom it may put for
ward are worthy of support by every
man who is a tax-payer or a resident of
the city of Pan Jose. The members of
the club do not propose to let the people
forget how the tax rate has been in
creased, through the raids made on the
city treasury by the boodlers, from 80
cents on the $100, before the advent of
the gang, to $1 40 during one of the
years since the gang got control.
It is in view to organize precinct
clubs, so that every portion of the city
will be brought in touch with the main
organization. It is common talk that
the coming April will see one of thÂ«
hottest political battles in the city of
San Jose that have ever been fought in
the State. It will be a fair and square
contest between the tax-payers and the
tax-eaters, with the odds in favor of
the former. The people now fully
realize the state of bondage they have
been held in through the machinations
of "the gang." They will be given the
means of regaining control of the reins
of government, and from the energy
that is now being displayed by the rep
resentatives of the better element, the
tax-payers will not fail to give their
time and their votes to the men who
promise freedom from the raids and
from the reign of terror inaugurateo.

morants who have so long infested the

MARCHING TO RELIEF
OF THE WHALERS,
Continued from First Page.
several natives had gathered around to
take an account of his stock and to
wonder what such an interesting
young man could have done that he
should have been marooned on such a i
barren shore. Jarvis upon landing be- I
gan to talk to the Eskimos with his I
forefinger, pointing out that he wanted
the goods taken in their kyacks to the j
village. They promptly began loading j
the skin boats. They are an obedient }
race. I could not help contrasting their
behavior with what one might expect
from Caucasians who had a corner in
boats.
Meanwhile the boat was unloaded
and the supplies were carried about
fifty feet up the beach to be clear from j
the rising tide. Then I had the men j
lash down the broken mast thwart with
the help of a few nails borrowed from !
the overland expedition. Then, stay- j
ing the mast while we bade them good I
by, good 1 uck and godspeed, and. I
shoving off from the beach, we ran be- !
fore the gale off to the ship.
The first boat had in the interval got
hopelessly entangled in the ice, making
it necessary for the ship to get under
way to pick It up. They had accom
plished this, and were again anchored i
within the line of ice when we came
along. But I jammed the boat into the
drifting mass well ahead of the vessel,
took the sail, and with the oars just
managed to get within reach of a line
from her as we were swept by. After
we had eaten our dinner, the remain- j
Ing articles having been collected, our
anchorage was shifted again, so as to j
bring it further to windward of the j
landing place and clear of ice, so that
the boat might make a good start. S<r
at about 2:30 p. m. we started again
In the same boat, whose mast step had
been repaired by the carpenter. I nev
er saw a boat so loaded. There were
two long frame sleds, almost as long
as the boat itself, seven big dogs, sev
eral boxes of dried fish, feed for dc-gs, v
sundry other packages and the crew of I
five men and myself. There was no
chance to use the oars, and the wind
was still howling down from the moun- j
tains. We shoved off, with sail reefed, j
Eliding off to leeward almost as much |
as we wene ahead. We were so clus
tered that I could n<-t place the men j
and dogs so as to balance the boat well !
for sailing. To increase the disorder I
two of the dogs began fighting. The ,
men tried to stop them, at which I was |
surprised, for it is not the nature of
men to stop a dog fight.
Presently, however, the wind began !
to lull as it came more under the lee j
of the land, and we shook out the reef I
In the sail. In due time we reached ,
the place where we had landed before,
but the travelers were trending toward
the village. Finally, seeing no sign i
from the boat of our friends, and ob- i
serving that the sun was pretty near :
the horizon, I decided to land, espe- \
cially since my orders were to put the j
things ashore wherever possible,
whether the people were near or not. !
Landing, then, at the first place where â 
we could get in comfortably, I saw :
tracks of the travelers trending toward i
the village. Of course, I knew that ,
they would not come for the sleds and ;
things until the next day, perhaps not j
for a couple of days. But the supplies
were considerably nearer them on the |
beach anywhere than they would be on
the Bear, especially if we had to get ;
out of there during the night. And the
dogs would live for at least four days
without food. So ashore everything
went. I hope that Jarvis has them
now. But I did hate to leave those ,
poor dogs out there alone in the snow. '
Returning the wind freshened again !
and as we went alongside, the ship she '
was getting up her anchor. At 4:10 we [
were under way, but the water shoaling
we anchored again at 4:55 to wait for
daylight. If any of The Call's readers
are planning to take any little excur- I
sions of a similar nature it will be in- ,
teresting to know what the argonauts
took with them. There were fifty
pounds of beans, fifty pounds of pportk t
two cases of canned meat, two cases of
hard bread, twenty-four pounds of ba- â 
con, one large knife, half-dozen table
spoons, half-dozen teaspoons, half- ,
dozen knives and forks, two rifles, one
shotgun, 400 rifle and 100 rounds shot
gun ammunition, two sleds, seven dogs,
four sleeping bags, two cases coal oil, ;
one lantern, 300 pounds fish for the i
dogs, one camp stove and outfit, two \
sacks flour, one package leaf tobacco |
and one large box of cigarettes.
It is intended to take with them only )
enough provisions to last from one vilr I
lage to another, getting a fresh supply ;
at each stopping place. Much of these
supplies may be used in trading with I
the natives for dogs, etc., before start- |
BANDED TO SECURE
BETTER GOVERNMENT
Officers of the New Charter Club Say It
Is Time That Respectable Citizens
of San Jose Were Aroused to
Their Danger.
13.â T0 the Editor of The Call, San
Francisco: As to my views with reference to the pres
ent and past condition of affairs in San Jose, I will
state that I believe the proper time has arrived when
the respectable citizens, who are in favor of a good
and economical government, should bestir themselves
and take the proper steps at the coming oity election
to secure their desire. To secure the result desired,
they must not be divided by any "issues" or partisan
motives, but must present a united and a determined
opposition to the selection for any office of a person
who is or who has been identilied with, or who has any
affiliation, no matter how slight, with the disreputable
element who now control the government of our .city.
The New Charter Club, an organization, has been
formed to assist in securing to this city honest. Tear
less and capable men for the various positions of public
trust within the gift of the city. Its principles are: A
determined and organized opposition to any and all
propositions which in any way savor of bossism or
gang rule; to oppose corrupt men and methoGs, and to
put forward and support men who are representative
citizens and who are honest and capable, and whose
election to office will be a credit instead of a detriment
to the interests of our city.
In conclusion, as president of the New Charter
Club of San Jose, I would earnestly request all of our
citizens who desire a change in the condition of affairs
in this city, and who desire to present a strong and
successful opposition to the elements which now con
trol our city, to refrain from circulating or signing pe
titions for any candidate for office until the Charter
Club ticket has been nominated and published, which
event will occur in ample time before election so that
any person who may not be satisfied can have ample
opportunity to exercise his right as an elector in any
manner he may see fit.
I desire also to extend my thanks to and to indorse
The Call for the position it has taken, and for the as
sistance it is giving us in our fight for good govern
ment, and also to all other newspapers who have ex
pressed a friendly feeling toward our cause.
President New Charter Club.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 13.â T0 the Editor of The Call, San
Francisco: The advisory committee of the New Char
ter Club is composed of fifteen members. This com
mittee, of which I am chairman, is pledged to devote
its energies to the interests of the people in the ap
proaching campaign. It will act in the capacity of a
steering committee, both as to the policy of the club
and as to the plan of campaign in the approaching city
election. It will carry out what it believes to be the
wishes of the people in regard to good and economical
government of the city.
Not only will it be our endeavor to see that only
ing from Tunumak. As they get further
along articles will be obtained, if pos
sible, from the natives by means of
orders for supplies which Captain Tut
tle will redeem in the summer as we
follow the track of the wanderers.
Now that the overland expedition is
landed and on its way let us revise our
table of distances a little and remem
ber that they are expressed in nautical
miles and that there are 6080 feet in one
of them as against only 5280 feet in the
statute mile in which you reckon dis
tances on land. We cannot tell Just
how many miles they will have to
travel over. Perhaps we cannot come
within a hundred miles. They may
find places here and there where a
crossing on ice will cut off many miles,
such as the short cut across Kotzebue
Sound if that is practicable. Again, ob
stacles will undoubtedly be met with
which will increase the distances; ob
stacles that are not on the chart, but
which exist none the less. Here they
are, so far as I can figure it out:

I cannot come anywhere near to an
accurate estimate of the length of time
that it will take the overland expedi
tion to cover this 1440 miles. There Is
nothing to figure on. They may have
some exceptional good luck. But they
will, without doubt, have delay after
delay. The sun does not rise now un
til 9 a. m., and it sets at 3 p. m. The
natives themselves will not travel in
darkness. This reduces the available
day to six hours unless the moon
shines. Owing to the fact that the
moon will be as far south as the sun
itself, I doubt if they will get much
benefit from it. Besides this, the
storms will drive over the country with
great frequency, keepiDg; them within

men of known probity and ability are elected to every
one of the city offices to be filled, but we shall make
it part of our duty to see that they are held up to a
proper discharge of their duty after they are Installed.
They will be given due credit for service well per
formed, and they will not be spared if they fail in
their duty.
We expect the men who are elected to carry on the
city's affairs on the one dollar limit, as we believe the
expense of conducting all the departments of the city
government can be reduced twenty-five per cent with
out interfering with their proper administration or
with necessary improvements. The people teel that an
enormous amount of money is now expended in a
wasteful and extravagant manner. The people are now
fully aware of the peculiar methods that have been
adopted by the city officials. The work of The Call in
exposing these matters is fully appreciated by the peo
ple, and they expect that they will be able to rely on
The Call to help them in the April election.
Everybody is looking to The Call for a full, fair and
honest statement of the condition of affairs here. We
look upon what The Call has done in the past as a
benefit to the people, as it has called the attention of
the citizens here to the extraordinary manner In which
the city officials have been conducting affairs. They
look for the support of The Call until victory is
achieved for the people.
Chairman Advisory Committee, New Charter Club.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 13.â T0 the Editor of The Call, San
Francisco: The New Charter Club is organized for the
purpose of assisting the election of representative and
capable men to the municipal offices. The new charter
was framed on economic lines, which forbid the waste
incident to the rule of machine politics. Men accus
tomed to financial economy in the business affairs of
life are the kind of representatives necessary to the
efficacy of good government. Men who are friendly to
the reforms in the new charter are essential to Its suc
cess. The charter in such hands will prove a great
boon to the city of San Jose. It is pronounced by good
judges throughout the State to be the best municipal
charter in California, but good laws are useless in the
hands of men unwilling to enforce them. The general
laws of California are good, but they are rendered use
less by the lax method of enforcing them. More busi
ness men in office and less machine politics. 1 think, is
the panacea. I am pleased to see such an important
factor as The Call working on these lines.
Chairman Finance Committee, New Charter Club.
the native huts for days, even weeks,
at a time. Snowstorms may overtake
them between stations. In such a case
we cannot tell what will happen. They
will lose their way, perhaps. Moun
tains 1000 or 2000 feet high must be
crossed. Rivers that may or may not
be frozen completely over will deceive
them. The members of the expedition
may fall sick or be injured, so that it
might be necessary to wait a long time
for them.
Now you have as much insight into
the problem as I have, and I would sug
gest that there is a first-class chance
for a guessing contest among the read
ers of The Call. The expedition left the
Bear on December 16, 1897. When will
it reach Point Barrow?
At 8:40 a. m., December 17, we got up
anchor and stood out to the northward
of Nunivak Island, sounding as we
went, because the shcml water extends
away out of sight of land. From the
ship, before we left, we could see no
sign of the travelers coming for the
sleds and supplies that we had left on
the beach for them. We steamed slow
ly out, stopping and even backing
whenever the water shoaled to five
fathoms or less. The vessel draws three
fathoms, and we got as low as four
and a half, leaving only nine feet be
tween the keel and the bottom of the
sea. But the sea was smooth in these
places, so there was no damage done.
That night the sea Increased until by 3
o'clock the next morning we were ly
ing to.
All that night and until midnight of
the 18th we lay to, drifting off to the
northward and westward. Then the
vessel's head was pointed for St. Paul
Island and her speed was gradually In
creased until by 6 a. m. of the 19th
the Bear was steaming at full speed on
the homeward road, if the Aleutian Is
lands can be called a home for man.
Captain Tuttle had taken Mr. Baldwin,
the agent of the North American Com
mercial Company, on board for pas
sage to St. Paul Island. Not wishing to
delay the expedition by landing him
on the outward trip he was taken along
with us to the north, running bis risk
I with us of bring frozen in. Now, how
i ever, our work being done for the
present, we were to visit the seal is
j lands and Baldwin would have plenty
I of time to attend to the affairs of the
: company.
Communication in Bering Sea is so
'â  precarious that the revenue cutters and
I naval vessels have always extended to
I the various companies of Alaska all the
j courtesies possible in the way of trans
portation. #
On December 20, at 11:50 a. m., we
| anchored in Village Cove, St. Paul Is
j land. In the summer time the seal is
' lands are almost continually shrouded
in an envelope of fog. That is supposed
to be the reason why the seal likes to
live there. But in the winter the air
{is clear as a bell. We sighted the is
land at least thirty miles off. In the
â  summer you are lucky to see It when
! more than three-quarters of a mile
I away and the United States ship
j Adams, some years ago, did not see the
island until she was piled up on the
beach. But then it was indistinct.
Captain Tuttle's instructions to Lieu
i tenant Jarvls are as follows:
j United States Revenue Steamer Bear,
December 16, 1897.
First Lieutenant D. H. Jarvls, U. S. R.
!C. S., United States Revenue steamer
; Bear: Sirâ You are detailed to take
i charge of the overland party from the
i Bear for the relief of the whalers at
! Point Barrow. Lieutenant E. P. Bertholf.
IR. C. S.. Surgeon S. J. Call and F.
Koltchoff will comprise the party from
the vessel. Inclosed are instructions
| from the department, by .which you will
;' be guided as far as practicable. They
I are full and appear to cover every point
! and to leave me little to add. The party
I will be under your sole control, and you
j will make such disposition of them as
i may seem most advisable to you under
any and all circumstances.
Whenever it becomes necessary to em
ploy natlvps and thoir outfits of dogs
| and sledÃea, or procure provisions from
i them, make a nof of articles and the
! amounts promised for the same; if prac
j ticable, give the natives a copy .to pre
sent when the Bear is met, and the arti
j cles will bfl delivered.
The department does not. in its letter,
! mention the whalers to. the eastward of
I Point Barrow. If you hear from them
use your own judgment as to what can
be clone for their relief. At this dis
tance and the utter lack of knowledge
of their circumstances, it is impossible
for me to give any directions. I shall
leave Unalaska as early as there will be
any possible chance to get through the
ice. If St. Michael be open, I shall call
there. If not, Port Clarence and Cape
Prince of Wales will be visited in search
of news of the expedition. I hope to
reach Point Hope early in July. Should
any of the whalers be there, will land
provisions enough To last them until I
return from Point Barrow. If any part
of the expedition should be along the
shores, I suggest you to direct them to
make smudges of heavy smoke to attract
attention on board the Bear, should she
be sighted. A good lookout will be kept
from the vessel for such signals.
In conclusion, any matters that may
come up which are not covered by these
instructions are left to your own judg
ment, and whatever you may do will
meet with the approval of the depart
ment. If opportunity offers, communi
cate with me at Unalaska and leave in
formation as to your own progress at
Port Clarence, Cape Prince of Wales,
Kotzebue Sound and Point Hope, to be
picked up on the arrival of the Bear at
these places. Also, if possible, send cop
ies of all communications to the depart
ment. Respectfully yours.
F. TUTTLE,
Captain, U. S. R. S., Commanding.
These instructions show that the
overland expedition is to be conducted
mainly on I O Us. But the natires
have great faith in the promises of the
United States Government, and I see
no reason to fear for the success of the
scheme.
The colder the weather, within
reasonable limits, of course, the bet tf ?r
they can travel. Over hard-crusted
snow, under favorable conditions, a dog
sledge with twelve dogs can make as
much as sixty miles a day. Koltchoff
claims to have made over a hundred
miles a day for two or three days on a
dog sledge. But nothing is so discour
aging to a traveler as soft snow, es
pecially snow that lets on that it is
going to bear you and then goes back
on you at the last moment. Any way
that you look at it they have a tre
mendous job in hand, and I prophesy
that, whether they reach Point Barrow
or not, there will be nowhere in the
world such enthusiastic advocates of
good roads as the members of the
Bear's overland relief expedition.
CAPTAIN TUTTLE'S
OFFICIAL REPORT.
Tells Secretary Gage of the Landing
of the Expedition to Rescue
the Whalers.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â The Secre
tary of the Treasury to-day received
the following report from the captain
of the Bear:
Seattle, Feb. 13, 1898.
Secretary of the Treasury: The Bear
arrived at l T nalaska at noon of Decem
ber 9, coaled and watered 'there an<l sailed
for the north at 1:35 a. m. on the 11th,
arrived off the southeast cape of St. Law
rence Island at 2 p. m. on the 13th, where
ice was encountered, and on December
14 ice was forming rapidly. Cape Nome
was ninety-six miles distant. I conclud
ed that the vessel would be frozen in
long before the Cape could be reached,
and therefore turned and steamrd south
ward for Cape Vancouver, which was
reached at 3:T>o p. m. on the 15th, too late
to make a landing. The relief party,
Lieutenants Jarvis and liertholf, Dr. rail
and Mr. Koltchoff, with their outfits and
malls fur St. Michael and the north, were
landed on the lfith about five miles from
the village of Tununak. Cape Vancouver.
Lieutenant Jarvis made arrangements
with the trailer of the village to guide
and assist hi? party <o St. Michael which
place the trader s;dd could be reached in
ten days via Andreafski. On account
of bad weather and running ice the Bear
could not remain to see the party started
overland. We sailed from Vancouver at
8:40 a. m. on the 17th, and called at the
Seal Islands on the 20th and 21st. All
were well there. "We arrived at I'n
alaska December 22. All well. Th >
branded seals are. returning to St. Paul
Island. F. TI.'TTLE, Captain.
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
Howell to-night, in conversation with
The Call correspondent, expressed him
self as well pleased that the Bear had
landed the rwverland party so nearly ac
cording to the programme, although it
would have been much better for the
overland party if the Bear could have
reached a point nearer St. Michael.
Captain Shoemaker, when seen early
in the evening, had not yet seen the re
port of Captain Tuttle. He said: "My
calculation was that the Bear would
reach Sledge Island about December 15,
or between that and the 20th, for the
Bear would only stop at Unalaska to
take coal and water. I was not sure
that the Bear could land the party in
Norton Sound though I believed that it
might be done. I calculated that the
party would start for Point Barrow
after making arrangements for the deer
and that the Bear would return to Una
laska and winter there and then start
north as soon as the ice broke in the
spring or early summer."
As this was before Captain Shoe
maker had seen Captain Tuttle's report
it shows that his calculation was cor
rect.
Captain Shoemaker said further: 'Of
course the orders to Captain Tuttle left
matters largely to his discretion, but
we did not expect that any great
amount of provisions could be hauled
overland or packed by the deer, the
intention being merely to drive a large
herd of them to Point Barrow, where
they would be slaughtered for meat and
that the additional food supplies would
be carried by the Bear and would reach
there in July. Since then, however, I
have talked with men from that coun
try who are familiar with the drawing
and packing capacity of the deer and
they say that each animal ought to
pack 100 pounds, but even if they were
only able to pack fifty pounds each five
hundred of them could carry 25,000
pounds of provisions and this, with the
deer meat, would have maintained the
whalers until the Bear arrived in July."
Captain Shoemaker said that as far
as he knew there was no intention of
detaching any officers from the Bear.
"I cannot understand how such a re
port could have originated," Baid he.
"I do not see how we could detach any
officer from the Bear before her cruise
is ended, for she cannot be reached. I
will understand the situation better,
though, after I have seen the full re
port of Captain Tuttle, which I under
stand is coming from Seattle by mail."
Captain Shoemaker paid furthermore
that the Corwin Avould soon be fitted
out for a northern cruise, and that it
was likely that she would follow the
Bear to the whalers' relief. This de
pended, ho\rr \er, on Captain Tuttle's
report and later developments. He
said that the Corwin would, be sent to
Alaskan waters, at any rate, where
she could find plenty of employment
when the spring and summer rush to
the Klondike set in.
Captain Shoemaker asked the corre
spondent concerning the report that
the Thrasher would be equipped by San
Francisco parties and that she would
try to beat the Bear to Point Barrow.
"If she beats the Bear she Is a good
one," said the captain, who is very
proud of the vessel. "The Corwin is a
smaller vessel and might possibly for
that reason be able to get through the
ice and round the point to Point Barrow
sooner than the Bear, but the Thrash
er cannot do it. I think that no vessel
ever left a port so well equipped for
such an expedition as the Bear. It
cost the Government $15,000 in addi
tion to the amount furnished by The
Call and other parties, so that the
total sum for her equipment approx
imated $26,000."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13.â The City
Council â or at least a majority of the
membersâ has sent forth an unofficial
announcement that all wires within the
conduit district not underground on the
10th day of April will be cut. This pro
nunciamento does not seem to have any
effect on the Los Angeles Lighting
Company and several other corpora
tions, for their wires are everywhere
strung overhead within the prescribed
territory, and they are making no pro- |
vision whatever to place them under- j
ground.
The truth is that the city of Los An
geles has, through the treachery and
faithlessness of the three syndicated
dailies, been handled and ruled abso
lutely by the corporations so long that
the officers of the various companies
cannot now realize that they are in the
future to receive the same treatment
accorded private individuals. W. B. i
Cline, the president of the lighting com
pany, makes a boast that at the proper
time, whenever that may be, he will see j
to it that the conduit district ordinance j
is knocked out. Nevertheless, conduits !
are being put in all over the district by
some of the corporations whoso officers
have generally manifested a \villingnes3
and desire to comply with the law.
Since The Call registered the com
plaint of the property owners in the
I matter of requiring corporations tear
ing up the streets to replace them
promptly in condition, cause for rea
sonable complaint has disappeared. It
was a fact that a corporation formerly
could and did tear up the main thor
oughfares for whatever purpose it de
sired, and then, in its own good time,
put the street hack into condition if it
desired to do bo; if it did not, it sim
ply let the street go and the citizens
did the best they could. But if an in
dividual had reason to tear up a street
'he had to give a cash deposit to the
street superintendent that he would put
it back in satisfactory condition. If he
did not, his money was spent to do it.
Since The Tall exposed this manifest
outrage the corporation is alsir re
quired to immediately repair avenues
or streets which it has caused to be
torn up.
The officials of the water company
are engaged preparing the inventory of
the improvements they have made to
the city's plant, which the Council has
called for. It is reported that the in
ventory is being prepared in such a
way as to compel the Council, if pos
sible, to order a reappraisemerit of the
improvements. This is what the peo
ple are opposed to as a unit, and they
will look upon any councilman voting
for a reappraisement as playing direct
ly into the hands of the water com
pany.
As indicating the feeling of the peo
ple of the community toward the mu
nicipal officers who have stood faith
ful to their pledges in the water con
test it is only necessary to refer to an
incident that transpired Saturday even
ing. Four thousand people were gath
ered at Hazard's Pavilion. Mayor M.
P. Snyder entered and took a seat upon
the platform. As soon as he was recog
nized by the audience the people arose
and gave him a grand ovation. This,
be it rememberpd, is the man whom the
three syndicated dailies refer to as an
advocate of a piratical policy of confis
cation, and whom they have repeatedly
denounced as an unsafe man. The peo
ple of Los Angeles do not agree with
the combined corporation dailies.
CLAY WILL SUE
FOR A DIVORCE
The Aged Kentuckian Wants
Legal Separation From
His Child Wife.
Declares That She Has Been Drugged
by Relatives Until Reason
Has Departed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 13.â A Louisville spe
cial to the Herald says: General Cassius
M. Clay's stormy career is likely to in
clude a divorce suit. A report received
from Richmond to-day states that he has
at last determined to seek a divorce from
his child wife, Dora. Although she re
turned home a few weeks aÂ«o she re
mained only a few days and then went
back to the home of her brother, John
Richardson, where she is now staying.
The General has exhausted every effort
to win her back and has decided that
they must part forever. He has, it is said,
already reduced to writing the main
points in his petition. His ground will be
lunacy, the petition alleging that Dora
has been drugged by members of the ven
detta and is no longer herself. He will,
he declares, never allow her to want for
the necessities of life.
These facts were communicated by the
General to personal friends, who made
them public. The Richardsons, Dora's
relatives, it Is said, will stubbornly op
pose the divorce proceedings. Dora knows
nothing of her aged husband's determina
tion She has never moved her personal
effects back to Whitehall, and while the
old General has kept her supplied with
money and food, it has all along been ap
parent that he does not desire her return.

\ NEW YORK. Feb. 13.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: There
is a general impression among Pan-
American diplomats here that Costa
Rica and Nicaragua are very near
war. Both Governments have assumed
belligerent attitudes according to in
formation which has reached Washing
ton, and it is the expectation of Central
Americans in this city that President
Zelaya will demand a disavowal of
Costa Rica's responsibility in connec
tion with the revolution in San Juan
del Sur.
Whether the President of Costa Rica
will comply with President Zelaya's
demand and whether Nicaragua will
have the support of Salvador and Hon
duras in case of war are questions
which Pan-Americans are asking each
other. Those in touch with the Costa
Rica legation in this city express the
opinion that that Government will not
comply -with the prospective demand
of Nicaragua's President, and in this
event war is likely to follow.
There is some question as to wheth
er Nicaragua will have the support of
Honduras and Salvador in the event
of war with Costa Rioa. These three
countries form the greater republic of
central America. Pan-Americans here
/ty that Salvador may not feel jus
fied in embarking in war. Besides.
President Gutierrez of Salvador is not
friendly toward President Zelaya, and
he might exert his influence with Hon
duras to prevent her from lending as
sistance to Zelaya.
It is understood here that the forces
of Costa Kica are stationed on the
frontier ready to spring into Nicara
guan soil at a moment's notice.
PAX A. MA, Feb. 13.â The latest dis-

that anarchy reigns throughout the

the plotting of leaders to get into pow
er in the republic.
General Mendizahal, who was called j
upon by the military to assume the !
presidency, is now marching on the
capital, Guatemala City, with a large
force of troops. Besides the military, |
General Mendizahal has prominent and
influential leaders, such as General Na-
Jera, behind him. General Prospero
Morales, who, with General Fuentes,
â was at the head of the rebellion In Sep
tember, has been called to Guatemala
City by President Cabrera to take a

Morales has been in the City of Mexi

HOW FASHION FIGURES.

By Lieutenant J. O. Berry. O. B. R. M.
UNALASKA, Alaska, Dec. 23 (via
Seattle, Feb. 13).â Colonel Joseph
Murray. United States Treasury Agent
in charge of the seal islands, Messrs.
Redpath and Johnson and Dr. Chap
man of the North American Commer
cial Company, with a boatload of na
tives, came out to see us upon the ar
rival of the Bear. Colonel Murray
gives us the first positive information
with regard to the success of the ex
periments conducted during the last
two years in branding the female seals.
It was feared that the rough treatment
that necessarily goes with burning a
great brand into the backs of the ani
mals would drive them away from the
rookeries and cause them to seek some
other breeding place. During the
summer of 1896 a number of female
seal pups were branded with red-hot
irons in such a manner as to forever
destroy the value of the skin. Different
designs were used in order to dis
tinguish the pups from the several par
ticular rookeries and from the different
islands.
All during the present season, al
though the work of branding was per
severed in, no results of the previous
year's work, so far as was known at
the time, were apparent. But it ap
pears that, late in the fall, a goodly
number of the yearlings, last year's
pups, branded at that time, returned to
the rookeries on St. Paul Island. Two
were killed and skinned, in order to
send their pelts, one to Professor David
Starr Jordan, head of the seal expert
I commission, the other to the Secretary
of the Treasury at Washington.
The seal question now stands in a
fair way to be settled with or without
; the help of Great Britain or any other
I nation. For, with the female seals
branded in such a manner that the
skins are valueless and with the bach
i elor seals herded in the salt lagoon on
1 St. Paul Isiand until the weather be
| comes too bad for pelagic sealing,
i there will be no profit in the business
I for the sealing schooners. And we can
i easily protect the herd from raiders on
i the islands, within or without the six
; ty-mile prohibited area.
The fur question is more or less a
! matter of fashion, however. We may
!on that account be beaten yet. Sup
pose Mrs. Grundy should declare in fa
vor of wearing branded fur sealskin
cloaks? All our trouble would have
been in vain. No woman would look
at one that is not branded, and the
Victoria sealers would be in their
glory.
In the skins under consideration the
brands are cleai and distinct. Not a
vestige of hair or fur remains in the
! wake of the iron, although the mark is
jat least a year old. Colonel Murray is
delighted with this excellent result, as
he was one of the first advocates of the
branding procesA, besides having done
the branding with his own fair hands.
The next morning at 6:30 o'clock we
i got under way and headed for St.
George Island. At 11:30 we stopped off
the vlilage landing, but found the surf
too high for a safe landing. They sig
naled, "Try Garden Cove." So around
to the other side of the island we went
and anchored off the beach. Lieuten
ant Hamlet went into the landing in
one whaleboat and, anchoring outside
of the surf, veered in toward the
! beach. When near enough he threw
! them a line attached to a keg contain
ing mail for the island. In the other
whaleboat I lay just outside of him, in
I order to pick him up should his boat
j capsize. We hafi orders to land on the
I beach on no account, so we could not
get their mail.
On our return to the ship, and I re
gret to state that Hamlet's crew beat
mine in an impromptu race to the ves
sel, we got under way at 2:35 p. m. and
squared away for Unalaska, Yester
day, December 22. at 12:50 p. m., we
made fast to the wharf at Dutch Har
bor and landed Mr. Baldwin.
GLOUCESTER'S TRIBUTE

The memorial list, which was read,
shows that ninety-six fishermen lost their
lives during 1897,, their average age being
31. There are seventeen widows and
forty-seven children : left to mourn their
loss. A large percentage of the unfor
tunnte fishermen were natives of the
British provinces. â

HAS THE COLOMA
GONE DOWN IN
NORTH PACIFIC?
Last December This Old Bark Sailed for Alaska
With a Cargo of Lumber and No News
Has Since Been Received
From Her.
SEATTLE. Feb. 13.â The steamer Lskme arrived In port at 4 o'clock
this morning from Dutch Harbor and Unalaska. The steamer Lakme,
which brought the news with reference to the relief expedition, left Se
attle for Dutch Harbor on January 13. She reports that the various
river boats now being constructed there for the North American Trad-
Ing' and Transportation Company are now about ready for the boilers.
Chief Engineer Harry B. Cloak of the Lakme reports that fears are
entertained that the bark Coloma has gone to the depths of the stormy
North Pacific Ocean. This vessel sailed from Tacoma on December 26,
Captain Mattson in command, with a cargo of 680,000 feet of lumber con
signed to the Alaska Commercial Company at Unalaska. The Coloma
Is a very old vessel, and was a trans-Pacific packet between Portland,
Or., and the Orient eight years ago, before any line of Oriental steamers
was established north of San Francisco. She was chartered by the Ta
coma Mill Company from the agents, C. A. Hooper & Co. of San Fran
clbco, to carry a cargo valued at $4500, and which was fully Insured, to
Alaska.
Nothing has been heard of the Coloma since she left Puget Sound,
and the length of time she has been out to sea warrants the belief that
flhe may have been wrecked and gone down. It was the intention of
Captain Tuttle of the Bear when the Lakme left to cruise about the Pa
cific in the hope of hearing something of the long-overdue bark.
Mr. Cloak brings the news that there is little excitement at Dutch
Harbor over the reported discovery of gold quartz In that vicinity. HÂ«
states that a Mr. Coley, a mining man from Montana, found an outcrop
ping of what is generally considered good quartz.

FEUD WAGED ON
THE GILA RIVER
A Bitter Strife Between Fac
tions of Stockmen in
Arizona.
Two of the Participants Accused of
an Attempt to Assassinate
a Foe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Feb. 13.â John M. Mullen, a
wealthy and highly respected cattle man,
with ranges on the Gila River, and
Thomas Davenport, a prosperous farmer,
have been arrested, charged with the at
tempted assassination of Josiah Ander
son several days ago. Davenpoit will
be discharged, but Mullen will be ex
amined before a Justice of the Peace to
morrow.
Anderson's story, to account for a shrX
tered hand, was that he was called to
his gate in the early dawn and shot by
a masked and mounted stranger. The
tale of Mullen's friends is that Anderson
and several others were caught by the ac
cused and his neighbors in the act of
stealing some of Mullen's cattte. and that
Anderson was wounded in a sharp-shoot
ing affray that promptly followed. The
\ndersons were driven from the field
without further casualties.
Further trouble is looked for, the fac
tional feeling being bitter. Anderson and
two of his sons have been under indict
ment for several months for the theft
of thirty head of cattle from a farmer's
nasture and are also defendants in a
criminal action of a year's standing,
wherein they are charged with unlaw
fully branding a number of Mullen's
calves. m

FAIR WITNESS
SPIRITED AWAY
Sensation iri a Lawsuit
Involving Land at
Everett.
Miss MagglÂ© Black Has Dis
appeared and Cannot
Be Found.
AÂ» the County Auditor's As letan
She Could Giva Startling
Testimony.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SNOHOMISH. Wash., Feb. 13.â A sen
sation has developed as a feature of
the biff Hart-Rucker lawsuit which has
been transferred from here to the Su
perior Court at Seattle. It is nothing
less than the mysterious disappearance
erf Miss Magffie Black. Miss Black has
been the County Auditor's assistant
j since 1890, when the city of Everett was
! booming over the location there of pa
per mills, foundry, nail works and
barge works.
In that year occurred the appraise
ment and sale of a school section on the
outskirts of Everett. The purchaser
was Wyatt J. Rucker, an Everett bank
er, who supposed he was representing
James J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern Railway, which was Just
building into the town. Hill failed to
furnish the money for the property, and
in consequence John F. Hart's claim of
$40,000, the assessed valuation of a saw
mill he had built on the section, was
never paid. Hart Â»ued Rucker, and the
case now, including casts, Involves
some $60,000.
Miss Black, having been in the Aud
itor's office during the whole time, is
said to be in possession of knowledge
which, if promulgated before the court,
would convict some one of tampering
with the records relating to this land.
Accordingly, it is said, this guilty per
son has had Miss Black sent on a se
cret mission to some distant State, or
probably to Canada. At any rate, Miss
Black has not been seen about Snohom
ish since about Christmas time. Aud
itor Headlee does not know where she
is, and her friends either do not know
or refuse to tell.
The attorneys for Hart say that
Rucker was instrumental in spiriting
Miss Black away. The attorneys for
Rucker make a like charge against
Hart. Probably when the case is tried
at Seattle some sensational charges will
be made. The case has been to the Su
preme Court five times during the last
six years on minor points, and Is now
to be tried on its merits.

Guilty. â
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Qordo.i Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. 13. â Numerous
meetings were held in the prov
inces to-day in connection with
the Dreyfus agitation. In some
cases resolutions against the
Government were adopted, but
there were no serious disorders.
PARIS, Feb. 13.â "What will be the
upshot of the whole business?" is a
question that may be asked with some
profit at this juncture of the Zola trial.
The gravest anxiety obtains and the
Gaulois goes so far as to complain ed
itorially that "anarchy prevails in the
army and law in the street," and calls
upon Felix Faure to exercise his con
stitutional power and put a atop to
this state of things.
The following views of well-known
Parisian journalists experienced In
reading the signs of the times will be
read with interest:
Gaston Calmette of the Figaro Bald:
"A fault has been committed, a fault
which should b^ attributed to the
course of affairs rather than to the men
who have brought about this campaign
of revision. The proper position to take
is a strictly legal one, and to ask but
one question in parliament, which
communicated against Dreyfus with
out his knowledge, to the court
martial. If Jhe has been convicted
in connection with a document
which he knows nothing about, and of
which his counsel knew nothing, then
the law, no matter what was the fault
of Dreyfus, has been violated, and the
matter should be revised. The whole
question is wrapped up in that. Every
one could associate himself with this
campaign so far as justice is concern
ed, but no one could do so properly be
fore the revision takes place, nor with
certainty have set in motion the ques
tion of the innocence of Dreyfus. If
the matter had been viewed in this
light, France would have avoided one
of the most terrible crises she has un
dergone since 1870. I speak of the re
public, and this is the flrnt danger to
the republic which can Involve such,
incalculable consequences. I refer to
the danger of antagonism now spring
ing into existence between the Judicial
system and the army, between the
gown and the sword, the antagonism
between the political world and our
army staff."
Henri Rochefort says: "Zola will be
convicted. There is so great a pressure
of public opinion acting on the jury
that one cannot expect anything but
conviction. On the other hand, Zola
does not seem to be well defended, and
his counsel seems to be" dragging the
affair out as long as possible. I don't
think Zola will go to prison, nor do I
think he will be obliged to pay a fine.
After the trial is over its conclusions
will be considered by the court of cas
sation: but suppose Zola Is acquitted,
he will not be able to show himself In
public in Paris, or, for that matter,
anywhere in France without personal
danger to himself. He could not very
well live in Paris with a body guard
continually about him."
M. Judel of the Petit Journal said:
"I consider the present situation grave,
and this gravity is owing to the weak
ness of the Government."

Takes a Tragic Method of Gaining
Relief From Continued
Illness.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GILROY. Feb. 13.â John Rogers, a Por
tuguese resident of Old Gilroy, aged about
55 years, committed suicide this morn
ing at 8:30 o'clock. Rogers had been
sick with a stomach affection for many
years, and It is supposed that a tem
porary fit of despondency Induced the
act.
Rogers seemed In his usual good spirits
this morning, and left the house presum
ably to hitch- horses to a wagon to bring
his family to church. Instead he went
to the granary a Â§hort distance away
and struck himself four times on the
head with an ax. He then took out a
pocket knife and cut his throat from ear
to ear. His wife, having dressed her
self and the children, went in search of
her husband and^found him lying dead
with blood streaming from his wounds.
The news was broi^jht to town and
City Marshal Rives and Dr. J. W. Thayer
went at once to the scene of the trag
edy. There was no doubt that It was
a case of suicide.
Rogers was the owner of a tract of
rich land at San Felipe. He was living
on rented land at Old Gilroy. He was
known as an honest, good-hearted Por
tuguese, devout in his religion.
Mrs. Rogers and the four children are
at a loss for a cause for the tragedy,
other than that he was despondent from
his long suffering. _ â¢

TAMPERING
WITH MAIL
Reason the Cushing
Was Sent to
Havana.
Official Communications
to the Maine Are
Intercepted.
Will Hereafter Be Carried by
Torpedo- Boats From
Key West.
MADRID'S HAUGHTY STAND
Has as Yet Failed to Disavow Re
sponsiblltiy for the De
Home Letter.
BpÂ«clal Dispatch to Ttoe Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 13.â The
Herald's Washington corre
spondent telegraphs: It Is now
known on the highest authority
that the real reason for sending
the United States torpedo-boat
Cushlng to Havana was that the
Spanish authorities have been
tampering with mail sent to the
battle-ship Maine in. Havana
harbor. This resulted in Captain
Sigsbee of the Maine sending a
protest to Washington, with
the suggestion that regular
service be established between
Key West and Havana by means
of torpedo-boat. On the strength
of this protest the Cushing was
dispatched to Havana-
It Is stated that the Cushlng
will return to Key West from
Havana In a day or two, bring
ing dispatches. After remaining
at Key West for about a week
she will go back to Cuba's
capital.
Although It has been frequent
ly reported that official mail has
been tampered with in the past.
Secretary Long told me to-night
that he had received no reports
from Captain Sigsbee saying
that the Spanish authorities
had interfered with his letters
In any way.
"The dispatch of the Cushlng
to Havana," he continued, "was
in line with the department's ac
tion in sending the Maine on a
friendly visit to that port and
the Montgomery to Santiago de
Cuba and Matanzas. I expect
she is now or will be soon on
her way back to Key West."
The De Lome Incident is still un
settled. A cipher dispatch received
from Minister Woodford late last night
and translated this morning was not
entirely fatisfactory- It was taken to
the President by Assistant Secretary
Day this afternoon, and after a short
conference between them Mr. Day sent
another cablegram to' Minister Wood
ford.
Offloially nothing will be said about
these two communications further
than that the incident is not yet en
tirely closed. I am reliably informed,
however, that Minister Woodford's
cable was a report of his interview
with the Spanish Minister of Foreign
Affairs, which showed that no direct
disclaimer had been made by Spain of
that feature of the De Lome letter,
which has been interpreted to indicate
the insincerity of the Spanish Govern
ment in the matter of autonomy and
in negotiations for a commercial
treaty.
The absence of such a disclaimer is
not entirely satisfactory to the Presi
dent. Accordingly, Minister Woodford
has been given further instructions on
the subject. Without making any ex
press demand for a disavowal, Minister
Woodford is required by his new in
structions to impress upon the Madrid
authorities the importance to all par
ties concerned of some distinct repudia
tion of Senor de Lome's declarations,
which the President cannot telieve cor
rectly represent the position of the
Spanish Government.
Mr. McKinley believes that when the
Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs
fully appreciates the interpretation
which has been put upon Senor de
Lome's letter in some quarters in the
United States he will hasten to dis
avow it. Minister Woodford has been
told in a positive way what the Presi
dent would like to have done, but he
has not been told anything which
would Justify him in making a demand
for a disavowal. In other words, it is
assumed that he will use delicate
diplomacy to secure the end desired,
and the President is sincere in the be
lief that another interview between
Minister Woodford and the Minister of
Foreign Affairs in Madrid will end the
whole trouble.

WILL SPAIN APOLOGIZE ?
Contradictory Beports Are Received
From Madrid and Wash-
ington.
NEW YORK, Feb. 14.â A dispatch to
the World from Madrid says: A formal
statement of regret and censure of
Dupuy de Lome's conduct, coupled with
an expression of sincere desire that the
Canalejas letter incident shall not impair
the present friendly relations between the
governments of Spain and the United
States, or interrupt the negotiations for a
commercial treaty, trill be made by For
eign Minister Gullon Immediately follow
ing the gazetting of the royal decree ac
cepting Senor de Lome's resignation and
appointing his successor as Spain's rep
resentative at Washington.
On the other hand the Washington cor
respondent of the World Bays that Spain
has not disavowed responsibility for the
utterances of Senor de Lome and does not
consider that any disclaimer of that
character is necessary. From Spain's
point of view the incident is closed, not
only aB to De Lome's reflections upon the
President and the American people, but
as to his declaration that autonomy Is a
mockery and fraud.
Such Is the unsatisfactory information
contained In the long-expected statement
from Mr. Woodford received late last
STOLEN BY A CLERK.
De Lome's Letter Taken in the
Havana Postoffice.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 13.-ThÂ« Press
will print to-morrow what it asserts to be
the true version of the acquisition and
publication of the letter of Minister de
Lome to Senor Canalejas. The authority
cited for its authenticity la a "Cuban of
the highest standing In the councils of hlÂ«
party, who received his information from
headquarters in New York." The story
proceeds to say:
The letter was not stolen from the Unit
ed States mails, but was secured by an
agent of the Cuban Junta In the postofflce
at Havana. Don Jose Canalejas, to whom
the letter was addressed, never saw the
original. He did not know until eight day*
after the letter reached Havana that sucn
a from Spain's representative at
Washington had been written him. De
Lome wrote the letter in his private resi
dence in "Washington instead of at the
Spanish legation. The paper, however,
was marked with the official type and
read in the corner "Legation de Kspana."
The same Inscription was upon the left
hand upper corner of the envelope.
Sen.or de Lome did not mail the letter
from his house. In fact, he had not quite
completed it upon the moraine it was
written and carried it to the legation,
where it was first seen and noticed bj- a
person who is In the employ of the em
bassy, acting in a sub-official capacity.
The letter lay upon the desk of the min
ister In his inner office, the outer office
being his pluce of reception to visitors.
During an absence of a half hour from
the inner office of de Lome the clerk in
question saw the open letter and read
some of it.
The next day this same person sent
word to his Cuban associates in Wash
ington to the effect that he had seen a
letter from De Lome to Canalejas, in
which President McKlnley was vilified
and autonomy called a scheme.
The letter reached Havana five day*
after its postmark in Washington. An
agent of the Cuban party, who is an
employe of the Spanish postofflce. knew
that the letter was on the way, and when
it came into his hands it was carried
from the postoffice and a copy was madÂ»
of it. Word to this effect was sent to
the Cuban leader in Jacksonville, Fla.,
who at once asked the secret Cuban junta
in Havana to secure the original letter
âthat a copy was not what was desired.
The Havana postoffice clerk was not will
ing to do this at first, but afterward
consented, as he was obliged to ac
count for it to the other employes of tha
department. The original was then
taken, several blank sheets were substi
tuted in place of the paper upon which
De Lome had written, and the letter fin
ally postmarked in the Havana office and
sent on its routine way.
Eight days from its arrival in the Ha
vana office, the sealed envelope, prop
erly addressed to Senor Canalejas, was
delivered at the Hotel Inglaterra. Senor
Canalejas did not regard the matter ser
iously at the time, although the hotei
boy who brought him the letter and the
postoffice employe who had charge of it
were arrested. So, also, was the hotel
employe who wont several times dally
to the postoffice for the mails. All three
were discharged after an examination.
ELUDES ALL THE SPIES.
Large Expedition Sails From the
Florida Coast for Cul>a.
JACKSONVILLE, Feb. 13.â A special to
the Times-Union and Citizen from Tampa
says: Almost under the nose of Edward
Gaylor, superintendent of the Pinkerton
and Spanish spies, a large Cuban expedi
tion left Tampa last night and to-night,
sailing from a point on Pease River. The
men, about seventy in number, walked
through the streets of Tumpa about 3
o'clock this morning and boarded a spe
cial train, which quickly bore them to a
point near where they were to embark,
and there they remained in hiding until
to-night, when a tug took them out to thÂ«
steamer which bore them away to Cuba.
Colonel Emillo Nunez being in charge or
the steamer.
It is si^'d General Sanguilly is the real
comma ncer, and color is given this ru
mor by the fact that when the men left
here they were in charge of Colonel Le
chuga, who was first lieutenant of ths
personal staff selected by Sanguilly when
he failed to get away from Jacksonville.
Superintendent Gaylor, his son. and an
other Pinkerton man have been here look
ing for Sanguilly. they believing he was
somewhere near here. It Is alleged the
Cubans have sent Sanguilly away on his
trip to get rid of him in the United States.
The detectives are totally ignorant of
the departure of this expedition. It Is
understood that 5000 rifles. 6000 pounds of
dynamite. 200,000 rounds of cartridges, and
a large lot of supplies made up the cargo.
Arcos May Succeed De Lome.
MADRID. Feb. I?,.â The Cabinet will

cessor to Senor de Lome at "Washington.
The candidacy of Senor Polo-Ber
nabe appears tc be abandoned. Seve
ral members of the Cabinet favor thÂ«
nomination of the Duke of Arcos. Spanish
Minister to Mexico, because he could taka
charge of the Spanish legation at Wash

RIOTING ON
A JAPANESE
STEAMSHIP
Europeans Attacked
by Sailors of the
Hakata-Maru.
Clubs and Knives Used by
the Furious Natives in
the Assault.
Officers of the Vessel Powerless
to Protect L ives in Their
Keeping.
ONE NIGHT OF TERROR.
Foreigners Leave Their Staterooms
and Huddle Together on the
Saloon Bridge.
C.'rrespopuence of The Call.
HONGKONG, Jan. 7.â The China
Mail of to-day contains an account of
occurrences on board the Hakata-maru
while at Moji on Now Year's day that
will reawaken all the distrust, many
times expressed, as to the safety of
Japanese steamships for European
passengers. It is but fair, however, to
give prominence to a statement made
by Captain Nivison, R. N. R., who is in
command of the Hakata-maru on this
trip to Europe, to a representative of
the Daily Press. He denied that any
thing serious had transpired on board.
The only British passengers were the
crew of a ship returning to England.
On New Year's day the crew went into
the Japanese firemen's quarters, and
after a time a quarrel sprang up be
tween the Englishmen and the firemen.
They fought on deck, but no one, ac
cording to the captain's account, was
injured, and the only upshot of the dis
pute was that two Japanese firemen
were ordered to go ashore.
"We (Daily Press) understand, how
ever, that the passengers give a very
different account, and that they assert
the Japanese used knives against them
and also against some of the engineers.
They also affirm that although a Jap
anese warship was lying alongside the
Hakata-maru she refused to render any
assistance in suppressing the disturb
ance."
The China Mail's account is very cir
cumstantial, and is made up of per
sonal statements by Thomas Hall, who
came out as third officer of the Tainan
maro, and by the carpenter and a fire
man of the same steamship. On the
strength of their narratives the Hong
kong journal declares that "a more
cowardly attack could scarcely be im
agined," and all three of them still bore
marks of rough treatment. While in
Hongkong steps were taken to obtain
redress.
The following is taken from Hall's
account:
We went on board the Hakata-maru
at Kobe. All went will until we got
!â â¢ Moji. About a quarter past 1 o'clock
on the morning of New Year's day, I
was walking along the deck after wish
ing the officers "a Happy New Year,"
and was opposite my own berth when I
was struck on the head with what I be
lieve must have been a marlinspike.
Blood commenced to flow freely, and be
fore I realized what was up I was set
i:pon by several Japanese. One of my
friends was walking behind me. He sung
out for assistance, tackled two of my
assailants, and rescued me.
I had just got clear when I was set
upon again, and believing it was now
a matter of life or death, and thai rhe
Japanese were attempting to murder the
whole of us, I pti-uck out as well as I
could. I was knocked down, hit while
I was on the deck, jumped upon and cut
and bruised about the head and boriy.
I rushed into the third engineer's Quar
ters, whr-re 1 was patched up by the na
tive doctor. I then went to my berth,
where I was told the Japs had been try
ing to get in during my absence. They
were armed with knives.
Everything went all right till about 7
o'clock, when another attack was made
upon the Europeans on board. The JapÂ»
were armeii with knives, iron crowbars,
bf laying pins; some were naked, others
half-drepsed, and all were mad with sake.
They burst in the doors of the engineers'
berths, seized the engineers, dragged
th.-m out on the dock and dashed them
about. There were sd many Japs that
the Europeans wore completely helpless.
WÂ« watched them through the port
holes nf our cabins, and wondered when
our turn would come. The chief and
third engineers were badly mauled. The
Japs then went forward to their own
quarters.
After tiffin I was standing speaking to
the second and fifth* or sixth engineers
when I was set uprni by one Jap. I tried
to go to my berth while the engineers
held him. He broke away and I faced
around upon him. Another Jap came
rushing up, ami then it became a general
melee. All the Europeans on board, in
chiding the officers, engineers, first, sec
ond and third class passengers, got upon
the saloon bridge. Captain Nivison was
too in in his cabin to render any assist
ance. There were about forty Europeans
all told and about a hundred Japs. We
passengers asked for something to defend
ourselves with, but the officers, though
they did what they could, were afraid to
give us firearms, as we were lying in a
close, port, and they were afraid of com
plications with the Japanese authorities,
we all had sticks. We remained on the
bridge the remainder of the day and
all night. The Japs broke all the gear in
the cabins and on the deck, and threat
ened to carry the bridge and kill all the
Europeans. Intimation was given us on
the previous day that there was likely
to be trouble on board, but we never an
ticipatud anything so serious. I heard
rumors in a general way that there was
ill feeling toward some of the Europeans
on boardâ that they were stricter with
the natives than native oiricers and en
gineers.
Hall's statement was fully confirmed
by the other passengers.
FINDS A BURGLAR AT
WORK IN A SALOON.
Fresno Officer Prevents the Theft of
a Quantity of Liquor
and Cigars.
FRESNO, Feb. 13. âAt an early hour
this morning Special Watchrr^n Smith
detected a burglar in the Fi tt o Beer
Hall, at the corner of Tula., and J
streets, which had been entered by burg
lars a couple of times recently. The ma
rauder dodged back of a partition when
he saw the officer and the latter fired his
pistol. The report attracted several citi
zens and the officer guarded the front
door while three men ran back to the al
ley in the rear of the saloon. The foot
steps of. the fleeing burglar were heard as
he was running away, and one of Jhe
citizens fired at him, but the fugitive
made good his escape.
Shortly afterward a well-dressed man
came out of a yard adjoining tHe saloon
and asked what the shooting was about.
He then coolly walked away, smoking a
cigar. It is believed that he was the
burglar.
T'pnn investigation It was found that
the fellow had thoroughly ransacked the
saloon and had seven boxes of cigars and
a couple of bottles of whisky In a sack,
ready to carry away.
This afternoon Officer Morss arrested
Toward Collins on suspicion. He had
broken a window In another place after
the attempted saloon burglary and is be
lieved to be a professional housebreaker.
He had a good supply of cigars of the
same make as those found in the sack In
the saloon.

DIES A VICTIM
OF HIS SLAVERY
Dr. Develli Succumbs to the
Effect of the Morphine
Habit.
His Daughter, Found With. Him In a
Hovel, Will Recover Her
Health.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE. Feb. 13.â Dr. John E.
Develli, who was found in destitute cir
cumstances with his daughter. Miss Cora
Develli, in a comfortless room on East
Main street, several weeks ago, died to
day In a New Albany Eanitarium. He
was taken to the institution a week ago
to undergo treatment, but his vitality
had become so low that the manager of
the sanitarium did not think it advisa
ble to give him any treatment other than
to relieve his pain by the use of the
drugs to which he was addicted. His
body was almost one mass of Bores
caused by the. use of the hypodermic nee
dle, there being 150 abscesses on him
when he died. These abscesses brought
on pyaemia, which caused his death.
Miss Cora Develli, who was taken to
the New Albany sanitarium with her
father, has been steadily improving and
her physician feels certain that she will
recover her health. Wealthy and in
fluential friends of her father, who re
side in this city, have taken her cane in
hand and they will care for her after
her recovery.
Dr. Develli wua. for years a prosperous
and highly respected physician until
wrecked by the morphine and cocaine ha
bits. He was an Italian by birth, was
highly educated and accomplished and
spoke many languages with fluency. His
learning, no less than the mystery of
his life, which no doubt died with him,
was a constant source of wonder to those
who were thrown in contact with him.
He came to this city right after the war,
though he is said to have been in Louis
ville during the war as a Confederate
spy.
Many strange stories have been told
concerning him, especially since atten
tion has been called" "to the sad ending
of what once promised to be a brilliant
career. It has been said that he was a
political exile, .that he killed a man in a
duel in his youth, and other theories have
been advanced to account foe his reti
cence concerning his early life.

plicity in the Garcia conspiracy and was
tried by court-martial and sentenced to

THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1898.
GENERAL TEXTILE
STRIKE ORDERED
If Backed by Other Labor Unions
All the Workers in New Eng
land Will Now Go Out.
BOSTON, Feb. 13.â At a meeting to-day In this city of flfty-flve rep
resentatives of textile unions in New England it was unanimously
voted to recommend that all unions call out the operatives in every
cotton mill in New England.
The meeting was practically the outcome of the recommendation
which President Gompers made to the Federation of Labor last Sunday,
in which he urged the different unions to unite on some settled policy
on the mill situation. At that meeting a committee was appointed to take
charge of the matter and after a conference this committee recom
mended that a general meeting be held to take definite action. To-day
the representatives of the various national textile associations assem
bled and for four hours discussed the situation from every standpoint.
The primary object of the meeting was to devise some methods of
rendering assistance to the New Bedford strikers. It was pointed out
that if the strikers at New Bedford could hold out for four weeks
without receiving more than 20 cents per operative a day in the way of
outside assistance other mill operatives could stand a similar strain
and that if all went out it would precipitate a crisis that would have to
be met with in a short time by the manufacturers. It was also shown
that the mule spinners were in excellent condition as regards funds;
united textile workers and the New England Federation of Weavers
were also in good shape, but that the rest were short of funds. The
questions were fully discussed and at length the matter was put to a
vote, no one being registered against the motion that the different
unions should order a general strike in every cotton mill in New Eng
land until satisfactory adjustment of wages could be arranged.
It now remains for the various national unions to take action on
the resolution, but what this action will be is a matter of conjecture.
If all should acquiesce and vote to strike 147,000 operatives would un
doubtedly cease work and the manufacture of cotton goods throughout
New England would be at a standstill. If, on the other hand, only a
few unions should vote to strike the refusal of the others would still
keep a large portion of the mills in operation.
Inasmuch as the meeting was the outcome of President Gompers'
suggestion and as he admonished the members of the Federation of
Labor to join hands and assist the New Bedford strikers, it seems
probable that nearly every union will carry out the recommendations
and that one of the greatest strikes ever seen in this country is Im
pending.
DEATH CLAIMS
A DIPLOMAT
Kalnoky, Former Austro-
Hungarian Minister,
Summoned.
Was a Talented Descendant
From an Old Bohemian
Family.
Retired Three Years A#o Because of
a Political Dispute With Baron
Banffy, the Premier.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRUENN, Feb. 13.â Count Gustav
Siegmund Kalnoky de Koros-Patak,
former Austro-Hungarian Minister of
Foreign Affairs, died here this after
noon.
Count Kalnoky, who was born at
! Lettowitz, Moravia, December 1, 1832,
I was descended from the Moravian
I brarch of an old Bohemian family. He
! entered the diplomatic service of Aus
tria In 1850. From ISGO to 1870 he was
Chancellor of the legation at the Aus
trian Embassy in London. In 1874 he
was Minister at Copenhagen; in 1880
he was sent as Embassador to St.
Petersburg?, and in 18S1 he was ap
pointed Austro-Hungarian Minister of
! Foreign Affairs, a post he held with
I distinction until May 16, 1895, when he
was succeeded by the present Austro
! Hungarian Foreign Minister, Count
I Goluchowski. The cause for his resig
| nation was found in Count Kalnoky's
: action in reference to the denunciation
iof ecclesiastical laws by the papal
: nuncio at Vienna, Monsignor Agllardi,
i who was charged by Baron Banffy.
j the Hungarian Prime Minister, with
! having made statements at Budapest
â¢ which amounted to interference in
', Hungarian affairs.
Baron Banffy addressed a note to
' Count Kalnoky informing him that an
interpellation was about to be put for
i ward in the Hungarian Parliament
i concerning the utterance of the nuncio
! which had appeared in the Hungarian
I newspapers, and had never been dis
i claimed by the author. Count Kal
: noky replied that the nuncio had dis
i played tactlessness, overstepped the
j limits prescribed by forelrn diplomatic
j representatives, and that he deserved
that a foreign office note be sent to
the Vatican to complain of his con
duct. He went so far as to sketch a
: communication to the Vatican, and
! the Hungarian Premier telegraphed
! his approval of it. A few days after
: Baron Banffy said in the Hungarian
Parliament that the papal nuncio's
' acts were not approved in Vienna.
As soon as this speech was recited
Ito Count Kalnoky he telegraphed to
! Budapest that only part of his let
; tor to Baron Banffy was for public
' knowledge; that the rest was conft
; dontial, and that the protest to the
â¢ Vatican had not been sent. Efforts
| were made to reconcile the two Minis
i ters. but these were unavailing. The
1 Hungarian House approved Baron
! Banffy's attitude unreservedly and
j Count Kalnoky resigned.
PROVES HER DEXTERITY
WITH A SHOTGUN.
Arizona Woman Riddles the Back of
a Cowboy With Small
Shot.
SAFFORD, Ariz., Feb. IS.â At Gpronlmo
yesterday occurred an affair In which one
small woman not only put a cowboy to
flight, but showed her dexterity with a
shotgun in a manner that may prove fa
tal, according to Dr. Linsoy, the physi
cian of the vanquished.
Charles Carico. the male combatant,
claimed a colt that was beins held by Jus
tice of the Peace Morris. While Morris
was absent Carrico invaded the justice's
stable yard and tried to lead away the
animal. His way was blocked by the
judge's wife and a shotgun. A few sharp
words were exchanged, when Carico. ap
preciating the danger, started to run, his
pace being accelerated by a discharge of
the gun. It is understood that Mrs. Mor
ris did not shoot to hit, but the result was
that Carrico received about forty small
shot in his side.
Suffers Fatal Burns.
SAFFORD, Ariz*, Feb. 13.â Mrs. Miles
Reay, wife of one of the leading residents
of Thatcher, )b lying near to death, her
body horribly burned from the waist up.
In some unaccountable manner her dress
caught fire between her shoulders. She
was alone. She screamed for help and
tried to tear her clothing from her. The
material was too strong for her weak
hands, and much of It had burned away
from her body before assistance arrived.
TREATY WILL
BE DISCUSSED
Will Take Up Much of
the Senate's Time
This Week.
Pettigrew of South Dakota to
Continue His Speech in
Opposition.
Consideration of thÂ« Bankruptcy Bill
Will Bo Resumed in tho
Houso.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â The Ha
waiian annexation treaty will receive
the greater share of the Senate's at
tention during the we"ek. The friends
of the treaty have succeeded in secur
ing quite general assent from Senators
in charge of other measures that the
treaty shall be given practical right of
way until a vote can be had, which
practically will decide its fate. The
Corbett case has right of way, but the
probabilities are that an arrangement
will be made early in the week whereby
a time will be fixed for voting on the
Corbett case, and that then the con
sideration of the treaty will be al
lowed to proceed without material in
terruption.
There are still some speeches to be
made in the Corbett matter, and it may
be proceeded with on Monday in case
no one is prepared to speak on the
treaty. Senator Pettus has not yet
completed his speech in opposition to
Corbett. Senators Burrows and AUeji
also will make opposition speeches,
while Senators Hoar and Spooner will
address the Senate in Mr. Corbett's be
half.
<Â»n the treaty there will be speeches
in its support by Senators Gorman, Pet
tua, Money, Lodge and others, while
Senator Pettigrew has not yet conclud
ed his speech in opposition. It now looks
as if the fortifications appropriation
bill would not be considered this week.
The House will on Wednesday enter
upon the consideration of the bank
ruptcy bill, which the majority of the
Judiciary Committee has reported as a
substitute for the Nelson bill, passed
by the Senate at the extra session last
summer. Under the order made, the
bill is to be debated on Wednesday,
Thursday and Saturday of this week at
4 o'clock. The substitute, which the mi
nority contend is practically the old
Torrey bill, including both the volun
tary and involuntary features, will be
opposed by the united Democratic and
Populist opposition, but if there is no
appreciable defection from the ranks
of the majority, the measure will pass.
The Democrats and Populists are both
favorable to the passage of a volun
tary bankruptcy bill, but have always
vigorously opposed the Torrey and
other bills, including an Involuntary
feature, claiming that its purpose is
practically the creation of a law for the
collection of debts.
To-morrow is District of Columbia
day. Tuesday probably will be devot
ed to the consideration of such business
as is reported from the committees, and
a call of committees, and Friday, which
was excluded from the order providing
for the consideration of the bankruptcy,
bill, will under the rules be devoted to'
private bills.

GARCIA AND HIS
WIFE ARRESTED
Accused of the Murder of
Collins at Santa
Monica.
Telltale Evidence Disclosed by a
Careful Search of Their
Dwelling.
Prisoner* Hurried to Los Angeles
Because of Threats of a
Lynching.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA MONICA, Feb. 13.â 1n the
case of Charles Collins, found dead yes
terday morning, the Coroner's jury to
day brought in a verdict that the de
ceased was murdered with an ax in the
hands of Peter Garcia, aided and
abetted by Mary Garcia.
A search of the Garcia house, WtlWh
had been guarded this morning, brought
forth an ax that had been recently
washed, yet on the back near the han
dle was a tuft of gray hair and some
blood. Against the wall, under some
clothing, hung a blood-soaked old dress
skirt that had also been partially
washed. As the woman had not been
allowed out of the place her resources
were limited. A blood-stained table
cover and a bespattered newspaper
were also found. Mrs. Garcia gave up
a $20 gold piece, but insisted that Col
lins had paid it to her in return for
borrowed money. Marshal Dexter found
large blood stains on the railroad track
In a direct line between the Garcia
dwelling and the spot where Collins'
body was discovered.
On the witnfess stand Mrs. Garcia
proved almost a match for the Coroner
and made no damaging admissions.
Garcia was not so bright. He testified
that he sold a basket of star fish to a
stranger for $â * yesterday morning, and
out of that it developed that he had
paid $3 for a pair of shoes, bought over
alls, taken a trip to Los Angeles and
spent some money, given $5 to City
Trustee Carrillo to keep for him and
bought a brooch made of a Mexican
dollar, beside paying some small bills
and redeeming Collins' saw that he had
pawned. The blood stains on his coat
must have been made by his nose
bleeding, he thought.
Collins' watch could not be found,
though Garcia was seen to have a
watch in his possession yesterday.
Immediately after the verdict the pair
were arrested and hurried to Los Ange
les as threats of lynching had been
freely made. It was not expected that
the inquest would be terminated until
late into the night and before the ex
cited crowd realized it the pair were
hurried into an electric car and were
on the way to the Los Angeles County
Jail.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13.â Fine
weather brought the usual large crowd
to the coursing at Agricultural Park to
day. As the weather grows warmer
there is a noticeable increase in the at
tendance and in spite of the fact that
the imported dogs are no longer in evi
dence lovers of sport find that there is
still something to look at and their
ardor does not seem in the least dim
inished. The purse to-day was for dogs
which had never won first, second or
third money, and there were thirty-two
entries.
There was a sensation in the morning
when the discovery was made that Imp.
Reliance and Hardy had been poisoned.
Colonel Black promptly offered $200 re
ward-for evidence leading to the arrest
of the perpetrators of the outrage.
There was a five-mile race between
Robert Hackney's running horse, Prince
Hooker, and the triplet bicycle, ridden
by Lacy, Cromwell and Palmer, the bi
cycle having one-quarter mile start.
The popular opinion was that Prince
Hooker would win, even with the han
dicap, as on previous occasions, and so
it was proved. The horse passed the
triplet on the third mile. He kept the
lead and won in 11:09, which is the best
time that has been made.

THE CRIME
AT BADEN
Moore Adds to the
Confession Made to
Warden Aull.
He and Willett Had Re
solved to Slay if They
Were Opposed.
Insists That Harry Winters
Had No Hand in the Death
of Andrews.
BEGINS TO ACT QUEERLY.
Prison Guards Believe That the Con
demned Man Is Feigning
Insanity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FOLSOM. Feb. 13.â "1 flr<d the shot
that killed Fred Andrews at Ferriter's
Hotel in Baden on November 17 last,"
said S. E. Moore, alias C. H. Raymond,
to Warden Aull to-night. The con
victed murderer sent word from his cell
early in the evening that he wanted to
see the Warden again, and he was soon
afterward taken to the office of the
prison.
"Harry Winters, who is here in the
prison with me with the sentence erf
death over him for complicity in the
death of Andrews, had nothing to do
with the killing of that man at Ba
den," he continued. "Winters was not
at the hotel on the night of the mur
der that I know of. James Willett was
with me when the crime was commit
ted."
Moore a week ago- sent word to War
den Aull that he had some important
â  information to make public, and he
asked the Warden if he would send for
Rev. John' Chisholm, the chaplain of
the prison, to come and see him. The
chaplain resides at Auburn, and he was
communicated with by telephone.
"Chisholm returned word that he ccmld
not reach the prison before Saturday.
Moore was notified of the chaplain's in
ability to see him earlier in the week,
and then the murderer sent word to the
Warden that he wanted to confess his
crime and correct a mistake that had
been made, whereby, he claimed, a man
innocent of murder was about to suf
fer the death penalty. What he told :
the Warden on that occasion was pub
lished in to-day's Call. / â  5' â 
After the murderer was taken back
to jus cell he began acting in an ecoen
li'ic manner, and it was the opinion of j
his uards that he was feigning insan- j
ity.
: â  Chaplain Chisholm called on the pris
oner to-day, but Moore would not speak
to him. Instead, he crouched in a cor
r.er c-f his cell, glancing at the minister,
ar.d Chisholm backed away from the
murderer, fearing he might be assault
ed. To-night Moore again sent for the
Warden, saying he wanted to make
clear the statements he had made.
'About five days before the murder
occurred," he said, "Winters and I went
to Baden to look at the Grand Central
: H6tel there, with the purpose of seeing
how the rooms were situated. We con
teraplated robbing the place. We went
back to San Francisco, and spent most
of the next two or three days around
Attorney Nagle's office. I was at a Sal- i
vation Army meeting a night or two j
after returning from Baden, and there j
met James Willett. Willett and I had
spent terms in this prison together for
burglary. When we came cut of the
meeting he asked me if I was ready to
do a job. I said 'yes,' and told him of
the good chance of getting a stake from j
Ferriter, the proprietor of the Baden I
Hotel. â¢
"On November 16 we went to Baden.
A day or two before going I got a pis
tol from Winters, and I gave it to Wil
lett. Winters knew what I wanted the j
pistol for. He knew we were going to
rob Ferriter. On the way to Baden
Willett and I met Winters in Holy
Cross Cemetery. Winters knew where
we were going, and, as I had no pistol
with me, I asked Winters for one he
showed me while we were In the
Cemetery. He gave it to me, and it
v.as the weapon with which I killed
Andrews.
Willett and I reached Baden at I
about 4 p. m. We loitered, about the I
place, keeping hid as well as we could. i
We watched the hotel until all the |
lights were out, then crept up to the j
side door and entered the house. The i
door was not locked, and as we went '
in a dog commenced barking. We
knew then that we would be discover
ed, and we resolved to rob the place
if we had to kill.
"We went up the stairway, and we
met a man in the upper hallway. I
said I wanted some whisky, but he
shoved me part of the way down
stairs. Willett then grappled with
him. and there was a scuffle. Willett
had his pistol in his hand. Then an
other man came in the hall carrying a
light. The man who carried the light
1 killed. I fired four shots. After the
fourth shot I ran down the stairs,
and Willett soon followed me. We
went up the road, and we were to
gether about two hours j before we
separated. The last I saw of Willett
was when I left him In- the road at j
the foot of the hill near Holy Cross

CONFESSION RIDICULED.
Wiilett, Whom He Accuses
Was Not in the Hotel at the
Time of the Shooting.
Thf> police ridicule the confession of
P. El Moore, alias C. H. Raymond, who
ip under sentence of death for the mur
der of Fred Andrews at Baden several
months ago.
j'oora. who realizes that there is no
hope for him, last Saturday made an
alleged confession to Warden Aull of
the Folsom Penitentiary, exonerating
Harry Winters, his murderous accom
plice, and throwing the blame on James
Willett, who has not been arrested.
Winters is also to be hanged for his
participation in the murder.
Detective Crockett, through whose ef
forts the murderers were apprehended,
laughed last night when shown Moore's
confession.
"From my investigation," he re
marked, "I am convinced of Winters'
guilt. The evidence at the trial of the
accused men showed conclusively that
he had a hand in the brutal murder.
Prior to the attempted holdup and
murder Winters was a constant com
panion of Moore. It was he who
bought the revolver used by the mur
derous pair.
"Moore, in his alleged confession, at
tempts to shield Winters, evidently for
the purpose of saving his neck. On the
night of the shooting Winters was seen
in the company of Moore. They had
already planned the holding up of the
hotel.
"After the shots were fired Winters
was seized by one of the men who
were in the place at the time. He
readily recognized him and, calling him
by his first name, begged him to stop
shooting. Winters broke away from
him and darted from the hotel.
"After his arrest he was positively
identified as being one of the murder
ers. Willett, the man who Winters
claims was with him at the time of
the murder, has so far eluded arrest.
I am convinced that he was not actu
ally concerned in the shooting. He may
have known of the plans of Moore and
Winters, but after a thorough investi
gation I am satisfied that he was not
present when Andrews was killed.
"It seems to me," continued the de
tective, "that the alleged confession is
nothing more than a clever scheme to
save Winters' neck. His attorney ad
mitted to me during the trial that he
| was up against it, and could not pos
; sibly escape the consequences of his
[ crime. I have expected that something
of the kind would be done, but did not
Think that Moore would attempt to
throw the blame on Willett."
It is understood that the authorities
of Baden will in the next few days
petition the Governor not to commute
the sentence of Moore and Winters.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1898.
TWO LIGHTS OF THE TURF
Todd Sloan, the Blase Prince of Jockeys, and
His DusKy Rival, Modest "Long-Shot"
Copley.
TODD SLOAN AND "LONG-SHOT" CONLEY.
If you want to see his highness, James Todd Sloan, you must telephone all
morning, for Prince Todd Sloan does not rise till noon. Then, if you insist
upon an appointment, you may have the privilege of being received by the
diminutive Prince of Jockeydom in his apartments at the Baldwin.
If you yearn for "Long-Shot" Con ley's acquaintance, all that's necessary
is to signify your wish. Conley will call upon you or he'll come to the door of
the little room at the paddock out at the Oakland racetrack, where the Jockeys
are penned in and watched.
The difference is the difference between the man who has arrived and the
one who's on the way; between a salary of $12,000 a year and one-fifth as much,
say; belween a great reputation in Racetown abroad and a modest one in Race
town at home.
The figure of a slight, Bhort boy. the foot of a danseuse, the face of a man
of, at least, 45 â this is the great Todd Sloan, the 100-pound idol of the race
track.
"It's all been told before," he tells you â¢wearily, striking a match with his
jeweled fingers and lighting a huge cigar. "It's been told over and over again
in all the papers all over the world. I've seen the Associated Press reporters
and told it all to 'em, andâ andâ "
And words failing he sucks at his big cigar for consolation and comfort In
this agonizing moment of interviewing.
His .-oice has not a particle of animation, ?Â»je corners of his mouth droop
complainingly, and his pale, little face beneath s-is sleek black hair is discon
tented, and woefully blase.
"It must bore you dreadfully," I suggested sympathetically.
"Well, it does," replied the little great man, lifting a foot over his knee.
Such a tiny, shapely foot, with its arched instep and delicate-hued sock
revealed by the tan ties, cut low on the side like a lady's "Diane."
"I've been riding nine years," he went on. "No, it ain't long. I know men
of 50 that ride. An' I intend to ride all my life. There's pleasure In riding, but
there's danger, too. I've been in accidents five or six times. Some take their
excitement one way, some another. I know men, it would be like taking away
sunlight from, if they couldn't bet on races."
It's a long speech for so short a man, and it's delivered in laconic grunts.
Not his big cigar, not even his pretty foot, which he caresses with that be
ringed small hand, can soothe Prince Todd into loquacity.
"I'm going to be here 'bout six weeks," he vouchsafes. "I'm going shoot
ing. Then I'm going back East to work."
It doesn't matter of what he speaks, whether of work or play. The prince
ling of the race-course is always bored. At 23 the penarties of greatness weigh
heavily upon this manikin. Ennui, the curse of royaltyâ whether of Jockeydom
or otherwhere â has seized upon James Todd Sloan, prince by grace of the pau
city of his inches and the quantity of his dollars.
Let it be a lesson to us whose obscurity would make us long for fame!
With "Long-Shot" Conley, on the other hand, the world is not yet a sucked
out orange. He takes himself very seriously, does this dark rival of the great
dapper, little "Todd."
His black face â he is very blackâ has all the dumb tragedy of the negro face
till he shows his white teeth in a grin that changes tragedy to farce. But he
doesn't see much to laugh at, though his seriousness Is the stolidity of imma
turity, not the awful 23-year-old disillusion of that man of the world, James
Todd Sloan.
But Conley laughed when he and "Our Climate"â Conley pronounces It "Ah
Climate "âflew by the Prince of Jockeys on Wawona one day last week. And
the memory of his grin Is cherished out at the Oakland track, when a second
time that day the modest ebony jockey outstripped the famous small blue
sleeved man whose reputation is as great among English noblemen as It is
among American commoners, who speak and understand the jargon of the race
track.
I saw Conley yesterday out at the paddock, where the soft, loose earth
around the horses' stalls gives one the ghost of that old memory of exhilara
tion you felt when your feet touched the floor of the circus in olden days.
The negro jockey is a graceful little fellow In his white suit, hooped about
with magenta, and his green silk cap.
"Yes â yes, ma'am," he said, unconscious of his pretty pose there in the
doorway, "Sloan he had the favorite. Yes, ma'am, bofe times, he rode the best
horse. May W. Now she was & cinch, they thought."
"A what?"
"A moral, you know."
I didn't, but I was ashamed to admit It.
"When we lined up that secon' time, ma'am, Sloan he was ahead o' me an'
I come last. It was jes' a six-furlong sprint, but when we'd got three-quar
ters done, I went pas' him and won."
"Did you say anything as you passed?"
"(J, we didn't say nuffln to each other. He don' know me, ma'am, said Con
ley modestly. "Iâ l know him"â even a black cat may look at a jocÃey prince
â"I see him las' year on th' track. I knowed I'd beat him when we started.
Th' boys, the other jockeys," Conley nodded his head- toward the inside of the
room on whose threshold he stood, "they heard so much 'bout him, they don"
think they can beat him."
Conley is a little vague about his age. He's 'bout 23, he tells you. But he
speaks positively enough with all enthusiasm about his riding. When he talks
of horses, one understands what the racetrack reporter means by describing
Conley's way of riding as "hand and foot style." When Conley rides, so they
tell you at the track, he rides with every fiber of his body, as though all his
soul were in the race. Prince Todd, though, is made of different mold. Per
haps this is why the crowd out at Oakland's track Wednesday rejoiced in the
darkey's triumph.
"Wha, ahve been riding, " says Conley, "evah since ah was a little fellow
no higha 'n that," and he puts out a pink-palmed black hand a few inches below
his present height. "Ah used V ride at Sahtoga, but ah got kin' o' bothered an'
didn' want f ride any mo, till 'bout two yeahs ago, when I began to ride lone
shot hosses, ma'am. Don' know what's long-shot?" Conley's white teeth
showed. "Long-shot hosses ha' long odds agen 'em. Tha's why ah'm â¢Long-
Shot" Conley."
"Do you think If you were mounted upon as good a horse as he you could
always beat Todd Sloan?"
Sloan's rival smiled and then grew very serious.
"Wellâ well, he wouldn' beat me," he said boyishly. "Ah know that."

TRIED TO KILL
HIS PARTNER
L. St. D. Roylance Fired
Five Shots at F. J. Dyer
Last Evening.
Had Been Friends and Inter
ested in Electrical Business
for Years.
Four Bullets Took Effect, but They
Will Not Prove FatalâRoy
lance ArrestaJ.
F. J. Dyer, who Is connected with the
Acme Electrical Company, was shot
last evening at 537 Mission street by L.
St. D. Roylance, a former partner In the
business, and, while the wounds are be
lieved not to be fatal, they are exceed
ingly painful. Five shots were fired by
the would-be assassin, and one ball en
tered the right side of the lower jaw,
shattering the bone in such a manner
that the greater portion of it will have
to be taken out; another entered the
right hand; another, which was pre
sumably spent, struck the breast, and
the fourth passed through the sleeve
and cuff on the right arm.
According to reports given, the two
men had been on the best of terms for
years past, but of late bitter quarrels
arose, and each threatened the other.
Last evening Roylance went to the
house at 537 Mission street and called
his former friend, and after some hard
words had passed he took out the pis
tol and fired point blank at Dyer's
head.
The bullet entered the lower jaw.
Dyer then ran into the house, and Roy
lance kept firing through the door and
window. The second bullet went
through the door and struck the victim
in the chest, but only made a slight
scratch, the force of the bullet having
been spent by passing through the
wood. When the shots were fired
through the window, flying glass cut
the wounded man about the head, and
it was at first thought he had been fa
tally injured. The ambulance was
called, and Dyer was taken to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, where he was
treated by Drs. Thompson and Hartley.
He was afterward sent to St. Luke's
Hospital, where he will be operated
upon for the purpose of removing the
bullet from the jaw bone.
A slight tinge of scandal seems to be
connected with the attempted murder,
as it was reported that family troubles
had arisen between the two men dur
ing the past month, but as neither the
injured nor the shooter will give any
information or make any statement
which would tend to incriminate the
other, there is possibly no foundation
for the rumor.
Roylance was arrested immediately
after the shooting and taken to the
Central Station. He refused to make a
statement, except to say that Dyer had
tried to kill him on three previcrus oc
casions, and that he fired in self-de
fense. He was charged with an assault
to commit murder.
EDWARD T. JEFFERY HERE.
The President of the Denver and Rio
Grande Speaks of Railroad
Matterp.
Edward T. Jeffery, president of the
Denver and Rio Grande, arrived from the
north yesterday, and is staying at the
Palace. Mr. Jeffery has been president
of the railroad company during the past
six years, but prior to that time was
connected with the Illinois Central for
thirty-three years.
In speaking of Colorado last evening
Mr. Jeffery said that State was enjoy
ing better prospects at the present time
than it has since the panic of 1893, both
in trade, mining and agricultural Inter
ests.
"I left the State a" week ago last Fri
day and am on a general tour of observa
tion, combining business with pleasure.
"The cut-rate trouble between Chicago
and Denver has not yet been settled. The
last conference between the Western
trunk lines was held last Thursday. Af
ter a protracted discussion the subject
of fast train service by the Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy and by the Chicago
Northwestern and the Union Pacific rail
roads was referred to the five presidents
of the companies in interest;* that is.
President Hewit of the Northwestern,
Burt of the Union Pacific, Perkins of the
Burlington, Cable of the Rock Island
and Ripley of the Santa Fe. They are
to take the matter tinder consideration.
Pending their recomÃiendations and
views, the rates will be maintained.
"The Klondike fever has struck the
miners of Colorado, and already parties
are being made up to jourjiey to the gold
fields. The miners of tnat State have
become inured to working at an alti
tude of 12,000 feet, when the thermome
ter has been 40 to 45 degrees below zero,
and feel confident they can stand the
Alaska climate. They will take with
them experience in mining, and also
ability to stand exposure."
Mr. Jeffery will pay his respects to the
officers of the Southern Pacific to-day.
He will remain in this city till the end
of the week, when he will return to Col
orado.

STABBED HER
TO THE HEART
A Chinese Girl Murdered
by a Disguised Half-
Breed.
First Slashed Brutally Across
the Face and the
Body.
Unrequited Love Assigned as the
Cause of the Fiendish
Act
Another terrible murder was added
to Chinatown's already long list last
night, when Charley Dean, a half-breed
Chinaman, stabbed to the heart Yit
Sing, a Chinese girl, at her home, on
Pacific street and Bartlett alley.
The girl died while being taken to the
hospital, and her body was removed to
the Morgue.
Dean went to the house disguised as
a colored man and rang the bell. The
door was opened by the girl, when he
slashed her across the face with a
highbinders' knife, about twelve Inches
long. In his frenzy he inflicted several
nasty body wounds, and completed the
deed by burying the knife in the girl's
heart The motive prompting the mur
derous act is said to have been unre
auited love.
The murderer then made his escape,
but the police hope to capture him be
fore morning. He is a well-known
character in Chinatown. Dean is said
to be an ex-convict.

They are on their way to Mexico to ex
amine land purchased by ex-Premier
Omotl of Japan for the purpose of found
ing a colony.
The land is situated in the city of Chia
pas, near Guatemala, and consists of 100,
000 acres.
Mr. Kobayaahl, In speaking of the
colony last evening, said: "The making
of the colony there Is a priva.te enter
prise, and in no way backed by the Gov
ernment. The colonists purpose planting
coffee, as well as other cereals. It has
not yet been deckled how many Japanese
will be brought over. Mr. Kawamura,
and myself are going first to ascertain
the nature of the land and how many it
will support. We have concluded a treaty
with Mexico which allows the subjects
of Japan to possess land in their own
right. As soon as an examination of the
land is made we will report to our su-,
perlor. Should a colony be established 1
think the Viscount Omoti will visit it?
Our trip may take about five months a*
we intend to make a thorough examina
tion.
"The Mexican planters want JapaneW
laborers, as they are cheaper. They witt
work for 30 shillings a monthâ about $7 in
gold. The employer must furnish them
with suitable food and guarantee them a.
return passage, also medical attendance)
while on the plantation. "

Speaking about the trouble in Japan.,
Mr. Kobayashi said there would be niv
war. "Although the relations are stralne*
with Russia, we are most friendly with?
England and America. From what I sa-wy
and heard. I don't think there is anyi
danger of trouble. Japan will try to pre-i
vent war as long as possible, as it pre
fers peace."

OUR ENORMOUS BUSINESS.
THE enormous business now being done in the
United States may be realized by a glance at
the bank clearings for the past week. They
amounted to the stupendous sum of $i.434.975- OO0 >
and were 52 per cent larger than for the same week
in 1897, 58 per cent larger than in 1896, 74 per cent
larger than in 1895, a "d 82 per cent larger than in
1804. The only city of any importance to show a
decrease last week was Denver, which tell off 18 per
cent for some cause not known and probably local.
The gain in San Francisco was 25.3 per cent, and it
may be remarked in passing that this city uniformly
stands eighth in volume of business and one of the
ten whose clearings are always written with eight
figures.
The railroad earnings of the country are also large
for midwinter, those for January" being $.38,000,006, or
16.6 per cent better than in January, 1897. This is per
haps due to the opening of the spring trade, which is
sudden and earlier than usual, itself a gratifying sign
of the general prosperity of the country.
The two leading features of the week are the
abrupt improvement in the iron and steel trade? and
the continued increase in the demand for cotton.
This latter has greatly stimulated trade in the South
and Southwest, which report a more active call for
merchandise, chiefly on spring account. The busi
ness failures show the usual decrease, those last week
being 278, against 301 for the same week in 1897 and
381 in 1896. The exports of wheat fell off somewhat,
though they were 1,400,000 bushels larger than for
the same week in 1897. The exports of corn, on the
contrary, showed an increase, being larger than for
some years. The output of iron is immense, and yet
we are told that even this bids fair to fall short of
the demand for finished product; if the present activ
ity in building of various kinds continues. The dis
tributive trade of the country was never as good as
it is now, and advices from all parts of the country
report collections satisfactory. The recent advance
of 17 per cent in woolen goods is maintained with
out difficulty, and heretofore idle mills are starting
up in many localities. The hide and leather trades
are in first-class shape, and the hide market has again
advanced under an extreme scarcity, which is
causing some annoyance to dealers and leather man
ufacturers.
There seems to be a disposition all over the
country to invest in corporate enterprises, as
affording safe and profitable returns. This is
one of the best signs of the times yet
observed. It shows that the people have
confidence in financial and industrial operations
of large capitalists, and that a good deal of the sense
less outcry against this class of business has died
away, as it does when times are good. This ten
dency is shown by the bullish feeling in securities
in Wall street, and, to come closer home, by the
noteworthy activity in the San Francisco market for
local stocks and bonds. Attention has already been
called to the latter, and a glance at the transactions
on the Stock and Bond Exchange will be a revela
tion to those who do not keep track of the daily
dealings in these securities. There is nothing better
to hold than first-class stocks and bonds. They are
alwnvs available at a moment's notice in case of de
sired financial accommodation, and are therefore
called quick assets.
The local situation presents no new features of
importance this week. Wheat is quoted rather
higher than during the preceding week and is in
trinsically nronjj. Barley continues to advance and
is getting scarce, as shipments to Europe this season
have been heavy. The other cereals hold their re
cent advance. The activity in provisions shows no
diminution, and dealers report trade better than ever
before at this time of the year. Hides have gone up
again. Dried fruits and raisins are still in the dumps,
though at the present rate of slow and steady pur
chasing by the East stocks bid fair to be well whittled
down by the time the new crop comes forward.
Hogs have advanced and are firm at the improved
prices, with a growing scarcity reported in choice
hogs. Beef and mutton rule steady at the good
price*. The wine trade is still in a bad way owing
to the lack of agreement between the different in
terests, but there are indications that the market may
soon shape itself into better condition, and those in
the trade express general confidence in the future of
the industry.
Crop prospects have been greatly improved by the
recent rains, and while more moisture is needed in the
great valleys, especially in the south-central part of
the State, no district is suffering. The usual spring
rains will doubtless bring us. through all right.
There is such a thing as dignity. San Jose should
resent the act of a Councilman in. selling himself so
cheaply. '
PUT UP OR SMUT UP.
SOME days ago The Call published as an item
of news a report that John W. Lynn, who re
cently in Oakland made an attempt to kill his
wife, was said to have killed Peter Camarinos, an
inmate of the Agnews Asylum for the Insane. The
story was that Lynn had been employed as a special
attendant for Camarinos, who was at times violent,
and was so employed at the time of the death of the
patient. The report of the killing was given on the
authority of John R. Griffiths, who was an inmate
of the asylum at the time, and claims to have been
an eye-witness of the assault which led to the death.
The Call was not responsible for the story of Grif
fiths further than results from making it public. It
was responsible, however, for the statement that
Lynn had been employed at Agnews as the attend
ant of Camarinos and was acting in that capacity
at the time Camarinos died.
The Examiner, in its eagerness to make up for lack
of news in its own columns by discrediting the news
of The Call, at once denied the truth of this story.
It said: "John R. Griffiths, who is responsible for the
story, claims to have been an inmate of the asylum at
the time the alleged murder was committed, and he
has been quoted as saying that he saw Lynn kill
Camarinos. After the crime Lynn says he went to
Fresno. This was about November 26, as near as
he can fix the date. As a matter of fact and record
P. Camarinos died on December 8 last, or nearly a
month subsequent to the time when Griffiths claims
Camarinos was murdered."
The Call does not publish news that it has not in
vestigated. The statements it makes are accurate and
can be relied upon. It does nofr depend, like the
Examiner, for success in business on fakes and
frauds, but on the correctness of its reports. There
fore it cannot permit its reports to be aspersed with
out making reply. In this particular case it calls
upon the Examiner to make good its charges or
stand branded as an envious libeler of a paper that
beats it as a newsgatherer.
As the Examiner boasts much of its devotion to
charity. The Call now offers it an opportunity to
add $1000 to the charitable institutions of San Fran
cisco on these terms: The Call will deposit $rooo
with Mayor Phelan to be forfeited to the charities
of the city if it was in the wrong in the statement
that Lynn was at Agnews at the time of the death
of Camarinos, provided the Examiner will deposit
an equal sum to be forfeited and divided In the same
way if it be proven that The Call was right.
The Examiner is so quick to discredit the reports
of its rivals, and so incessant in boasting its regard
for charity, it can hardly decline the proposition we
have made without stultifying itself both as a news
gatherer and as a patron of charitable institutions.
The issue before it is therefore plain. It must put up
or shut up.
LINCOLN DAY SPEECHES.
BY common consent in all parts of the country
the celebration of the anniversary of the birth
day of Lincoln seems to have been turned over
tc Republicans as a party feast day, just as the cele
bration of the battle of New Orleans, Jackson day
has been made a Democratic festival. The two par
ties into which the people are divided thus have their
partisan celebrations early in the year, and thereafte*
come together as one people to do honor to the
memory of Washington, whose good fortune it wa!
to be associated with no party or faction of his coun
trymen.
In a certain sense it is to be regretted that the
observance of the birthday of Lincoln should be par
tisan, but the result was well nigh inevitable. Lin
coln so thoroughly represents Republicanism, htf
was so closely identified with the history of the party,
he stood so stanchly for principles and policies o*
governmental action which are the exclusive prop
erty of the party, that it would be difficult to corn*
memorate htm or his work without commemorating
also the party which elected him to the Presidency
and supported him in the arduous task of saving the
Union and freeing the slave.
In commemoration of the day on Saturday but two
Democrats of national repute took part, and one of
them only indirectly. Mr. Bryan, who talks on all
occasions, spoke to his fellow townsmen of Lincoln
Nebr., and Mr. Towne, the silver-tongued orator
from Duluth, spoke in Los Angeles to a club of so*
called silver Republicans. Their speeches were dis
cords. Their utterances sounded like jarring note*
disturbing the lofty harmony of patriotic speech
which Republican orators were sounding in honor of
Lincoln and the mighty party which is still inspired
by his memory and his principles.
Bryan and Towne each in his own way preached
the demagogue creed of class antagonisms. They
went over the old familiar calamity cry
about the bondholder crushing the farm
er and the laborer. Their speeches tended
to discontent and strife rather than to the
glorious exultation which Americans should feel in
being citizens of a land where a man born as pool
as Lincoln could aspire to the Presidency and where
a statesman as honest and as pure from self-seeking
could attain it.
So long as Democracy continues to follow such
leaders as these the celebration of the birthday of
Lincoln will of necessity remain the special charge of
the Republican party. As the years pass, however, a
change will surely come. The youth of the land is
being taught in our public schools' to revere the name
of the martyred President and to learn the patriotic?
lessons taught by his simple but sublime life. These
as they reach maturity, no matter which party the-*
join, will feel an instinctive prompting to participate
in every celebration in honor of the greatest of all
Americans, and then Lincoln's birthday will be a
national festival and all the people will take part
in it.
Anthony Hope's dislike of interviewers is not
surprising when he explains that these inquisitive
gentlemen did not ask him anything about
England. As a matter of fact the absence of Anglo
mania is nothing to be deplored. This part of the
world hears all it wants to about England without
consulting an authority likely to be biased.
It is well that discovery of defective ammunition
among that supplied to the Government has been
mad* in shooting at inanimate targets rather than at
a live enemy. It would be pleasing now to hear of
some of the rascally contractors who furnished it
being fined and put on a blacklist.
Oakland's city jail is said to be of a character to
make the way of the transgressor more than reason
ably hard. If so it is clearly unconstitutional.
General Dickinson is a credit to the National
Guard. When in full uniform there is nothing more
beautiful.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1898.
STATEMENTS made by members of the Board
of Supervisors on the subject of water rates
show that the city is fairly safe against the dan- j
ger of a raise in the price at which water will be fur
nished to consumers during the next year. Six
members of the board have declared themselves op
posed to an increase, and if all of these hold firm ;
the scheme of the water company to place a higher !
burden of taxation upon the people for that neces- j
sary of life will be defeated.
The Supervisors who have thus frankly declared
themselves on the 'side of the community are: Clin
ton, Dodge, Lackmann, Morton, Rottanzi and
Smith. These men are not waiting to be seen by any
one, nor are they seeking to see any one. They are
aware of all the factors of the problem. Past inves
tigations have given them as much knowledge on the
subject as the company will ever give. They also
know the needs of the city. These facts afford them
a sufficient foundation on which to base a conclusion
of what should be done in the present instance.
There have been no notable changes since last year,
nothing to justify an increase of the rates, and ac
cordingly these men, being honest, have no hesita
tion in declaring what course they will take in deal
ing with the demand of the company.
There are six Supervisors who have not yet de
cided how they will vote on the question. These
are: Britt, Delaney, Devany, Haskins, Rivers and
Sheehan. They are waiting for more information.
Britt says, "I will be governed by circumstanecs";
Delaney says. "I will be in a better position to
judge * * * when the company has had an op
portunity to be heard"; Devany says, "It would be
too soon to ask me how I should vote in the mat
ter"; Haskins says, "I decline to express an
opinion"; Rivers says, "I will be guided entirely by
the testimony and the facts adduced before the
board"; Sheehan says, "I will be governed a good
deal by the representations made during the in
quiry."
All of this is fair talk, and under normal conditions
would pass as seemingly honest, but in the present
instance it gives rise to suspicions. The public is
familiar with the kind of evidence obtainable in ex
aminations of this kind. Again and again the water
rates of the city have been made the subject of in
vestigation, and the sum of all has been a moral de
monstration that the water company will never let the
true value of its plant and business be known. Just
enough has been revealed to make it certain that
water rates are now as high as they should be.
The Supervisors who are waiting for testimony
and are so eager to give the water company a chance
to be heard have doubtless peculiar ideas of the kind
of testimony the company is capable of putting up if
it chooses, and have probably made up their minds
fast how much of the testimony will be necessary to
induce them to vote for the desired raise in rates.
Fortunately, the danger of a raise this year is small.
With six Supervisors and the Mayor on the side of
the people and justice the chances for a cinch scheme
are small.
WHILE the recent disclosures of so many
scandals in connection with the administra
tion of various departments of official affairs
are by no means pleasant reading for the people, the
situation is not without encouraging aspects. Cor
ruption can never be overcome until it has been ex
posed. Light must be thrown into all the dark cor
ners of evil before the reforming broom can be ef
fectively used. In this instance the light has been
Mimed on good and strong. The work to be done is
now clear before us, and therefore we have reason to
hope the reforming task can be accomplished with
complete success.
It is not a coincidence merely that so many scan
dals have been brought to light at once. It cannot
have escaped the attention of any careful student of
current events that all of these examples of wrong
doing have been exposed by The Call as a part of its
work on behalf of the commonwealth. It was not
chance that brought them to light, but intelligently
directed zeal in the interests of the people and good
government. The popular approval which has. at
tended The Call in exposing the wrongdoing will
support Grand Juries and other authorities in the
work of bringing the guilty to condemnation and
punishment, and the outlook for reform is distinctly
promising and cheering.
As a matter of fact we are going through the
process of cleaning the governmental ship for a new
departure. The exposure and punishment of wrong
doing is at all times commendable, but they could
never be more opportunely done than at this time.
We shall soon be called upon to elect new officials,
and it is altogether fitting, therefore, that the atten
tion of every citizen should be at this time directed
to the evils of bad government. The present scan
dals will have the effect of arousing public sentiment,
and to that extent will serve a useful purpose by in
creasing the chances of getting better public serv
ants next time.
The Call does not delight in official scandals. It
believes, however, that it is better to expose corrup
tion and eliminate it from the governmental system
than to leave it to work secret harm in darkness un
til its pernicious influence is felt everywhere to the
injury of all departments of administration. On this
principle The Call has gone about its work, and now
has the satisfaction of seeing that much of the cor
ruption it has exposed is in a fair way to be made ;>
moral to good citizens and a warning to evil ones.
In fact the decks are being cleared. The bad odor o*
the present scandals will soon blow over and Cali
fornia will be cleaner politically than it has been for
many a year.
THE MAID AND THE MATRON.
M ISS A MALIE HOFER in lecturing on child
I life possibly says some instructive things, and
yet one would sooner trust the judgment of
one who has acquired the title of Mrs. and the dig
nity of motherhood. No young maid nor old one
has any right to assume the role of guide to the
matron. Let her first acquire experience. When a
woman has labored with colicky youngsters, spanked
naughty ones, assuaged the pangs of infancy, lis
tened to hs troubles, dried its tears, mended its
clothes, heard it lisp its prayers, watched tearfully
as the dews of death have kissed it and moaned by
the empty cradle and fhe flower-laden grave; or
when she has seen her boys and girls grow to man
hood and womanhood loving her, and renewed her
own youth in the prattle of their children, then she
knows of child life, whether or no she is fitted to make
speeches about it. She is not looking for advice
from the worthy theorist who would not understand
where to look for a trespassing pin. Motherly in
stinct may need> training, but it needs it from a
mother.
THE WATER RATES.
CLEARING THE DECKS.
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS.
BY A MODEST CRITIC.
Some six or eight weeks ago there
appeared in this column an announce
ment of what had probably occurred in
the Orient. The opinion, in short, was
that Germany had insisted on rights
equal to those of other nations in China
that seek expansion of commerce and
the convenience of the navy in time of
peace. The concept was quite accurate
and it is now apparent that the Chinese
imbroglio had an existence only in the
imaginings of correspondents. There
has been clearly no objection on the
part of either of the great powers to
the granting of Germany's request.
This Baron yon Buelow's statement to
the Reichstag and Lord Salisbury's ut
terances in the House of Lords bear out
to a degree. Amongst other things
Baron yon Buelow said "Despite con
trary views of English newspapers it is
well known in authoritative quarters in
London that in the interests of peace
and culture we desire to cultivate re
lations of harmonious co-operation with
Great Britain. Our modest demands
have neither menaced the integrity of
China nor called for justifiable objec
tion on her part."
This is a dignified and a statesman
like utterance, it almost reminds one of
Webster, and if Senator Morgan and
the allied jingoes will thoughtfully di
gest it we might earn more of the re
spect of other nations for sincerity
than we at present enjoy. The en
deavor to cultivate at every oppor
tunity a national craving for war on
the slightest pretext, the development
of our commerce being neglected, sa
vors not of statesmanship, but of folly.
Let us promote industry; let others do
the squabbling. No nation assails us;
"let us have peace."
So much has been written in these
columns on the Hawaiian question from
a naval standpoint that there is a pos
sibility of wearying, but as the annexa
tion or non-annexation of the islands
is such a vital matter, and as the ac-
| curacy of statements made here has
been questioned, the evident duty is to
! point out error and repeat the truth.
It appears from a Washington dispatch
that a letter from Captain Mahan, in
' reply to the catechizing of him by Sen
, ator Kyle, was read in executive ses
\ sion of the Senate by Senator Teller.
Captain Mahan has been made to say
: much of the defensive value of Hawaii
j in case of war, and as one of the quer
; ies put to him refers to a weakness
I that, as a writer on this subject, I be
j lieve I first drew attention to, it is im
1 possible to pass this eminent strate
: gist's replies unanswered. In discuss
ing this point it is necessary to assume
j the frame of mind of a famous jurist,
who, when interrupting an able plead
i er who was reading opinion after opin
ion from other judges which were fa-
I vorable to his client's case, said: "I
do not desire to interfere with your
manner of presenting this cause, but I
must tell you that 1 care nothing for
: these opinions unless you can show me
! that they are based on reason. An un
reasonable precedent I shall decline to
i consider, no matter how illustrious its
; author." Captain Mahan has a famous
, name, but I cannot accept even his
[ statements when they are clearly in
i error. It has already been pointed out
! that this gentleman reasons backward
â¢ when he says that the Hawaiian Is-
I lands are strategically of value to us,
and his letter to Senator Kyle shows
! how accurate I was when I said so.
!He says: "Hawaii is now exposed to
â¢ pass under foreign domination, notably
Japan, by the peaceful process of over
j running and assimilation." It Is not.
j Hawaii will pass under the control of
j no other nation if we object. To the
most powerful nation of the earth, ex
j cepting this (and possibly Germany)
| we said only a couple of years ago,
; "Hands off," and that 'immense power
that could crush Japan as easily as she
could little Portugal, instantly respect
|ed our wishes. We can insist as eas-
i ly on Hawaiian independence as does
I Europe on Switzerland's. If Captain
; Mahan will be good enough to explain
1 how it is "inevitable" that a foreign
j power will annex this group against our
i will it would prove an Interesting story.
One thing that would have to be ac
knowledged to commence with is that
j there is a nation that will be permit
! ted to dictate to us. Will this gentle
j man avow that? I think not. Our
i navy is not as powerful as it should
I be by any means, but no arrogance is
j displayed when it is stated that we are
the most powerful of nations on land,
our defective shrapnel included.
In answer to the second Question put
him, Captain Mahan says that a great
er navy would not be needed for the
defense of the Pacific Coast than would
be required with the islands unan
nexed. That is distinctly illogical. "If,"
he says, "we have the islands, and in
the Pacific a fleet of proper force, the
presence of the latter or an adequate
detachment from it at the Hawaiian
Islands will materially weaken if not
wholly cripple any attempted invasion
of the Pacific Coast (except from
British Columbia) and will proportion
ately strengthen us." A fleet at the
Hawaiian Islands cripple an attempt
at the invasion of this coast! How
could it? The day has long passed
when one could reasonably expect to
find an enemy in a certain degree of
latitude or longitude: the frigate with
her dependence for propulsion on wind
has disappeared. Coaled and pro
visioned at a safe distance from our
coolie land, a hostile fleet could easily
elude the most vigilant observation and
attack this coast. At best a flrst-class
modern cruiser can patrol no more than
a hundred and fifty miles of sea space;
it is much doubted If she can efficiently
look after a hundred, and isolation of
ships in midocean cannot be thought
of with sanity. 'On the coast it is a
totally different matter. It would be
quite safe to spread a fleet out if within
sight of land. There are no difficulties
about conveying intelligence with
rapidity and certainty to ships in the
offing of the vicinity that they are built
to protect. Heliographs, semaphores
and even the telegraph and the tele
phone would aid in massing the fleet
where it was most wanted with
promptitude, but the position we
should be in with half our Pacific
Coast fleet at Hawaii and the foe in
full force off Monterey 1b one of the
things we may have to face if Captain
Mahan's strategy is to be implicitly
followed. From these islands to the
coast line latitudinally is roughly 3000
miles. How many squadrons of five
fighting ships each would it take to
guard that entrance to this coast?
Really, this distinguished man seems
to have mistaken the Pacific Ocean for
the Straits of Gibraltar.
The end of the remarkable letter Is
this: "Coal can be transported in col
liers, but as yet it cannot be tran
shipped at sea with either rapidity or
certainty." I beg respectfully to say
that is inaccurate. If Captain Mahan
indited this opinion he surely must
have had a lapse of memory at the
moment. True, we have made practi
cally no experiments in sea-coaling, but
other nations have with very satis
factory results, although as stated be
fore the system is not yet perfect. The
battleships Magnificent and Majestic
quite recently, under anything but the
most favorable conditions, in a five
hour trial, coaled at the rate of about
150 tons an hour. This would mean 2000
tons in an ordinary working day, which
is very satisfactory progress. And as
sea-coaling is more easily done when
the vessels are under slight headway
the loss of time is not so very great.
Against sea-coaling I am aware that
it is urged it cannot be done in heavy j
weather. True, but neither can a bat- j
tleship fire her big guns in heavy
weather with anything like accuracy.
Indeed the admiral who would risk an
engagement, even if he had the superior j
fighting force, when a big sea was run- j
ning would be tempting Providence, .
and it is not at all unlikely that he |
would be punished by the fickle goddess j
for his temerity.
A cable dispatch tells us that within
a month an Austrian cruiser left her
sister ship in the Red Sea "going to
Aden to send a collier to her assist- j
ance." I am told by a master mariner
in whom I have implicit confidence that
he has seen three hundred tons of coal
transferred from one ocean-going j
steamer to another in that very sea,
and he says it was done in short order
and with no difficulty whatever. The
man who willingly blinds his eyes to I
the fact that sea-coaling is certain to
be completely successful in the course j
of two or three years has not my sym
pathy, no matter how famous his name.
If is often asked why it is that Japan
looks on with such complacency at our
frantic efforts to annex these islands.
The little brown man is something of a
strategist himself, as the Chinese have
lived to find out, and doubtless he sees
what a "constant source of weakness"
Hawaii will be to the power that makes
it an integral part of its territory.
After the foregoing had been written
my attention was called to an editorial
in yesterday's Examiner which purports
to give the queries put to Captain Ma
han by Senator Kyle and his replies.
This furnishes another striking in
stance of the rascality of that paper.
It garbles each statement in an as
tounding manner, omitting everything
whereby it could be shown that Cap
tain Mahan's opinions were not unas
sailable, and excludes altogether the
most important answer, wherein, as is
shown above, the distinguished strate
gist was lamentably in error.
After an absence that has been re
gretted by those seeking divertisement
the Examiner's logician Is back doing
business with accustomed sedulity. He
now descries a gift by the people of
this city of the capital stock of a street
railroad to the shareholders of that
corporation because a franchise to run
its cars through the streets has been
granted. The track, the rolling stock
and the labor which it took to build
the road â and even the cost of main
tenance â I suppose, all went with the
franchise. If the logician will inter
view some reputable financier, like Mr.
Hellmann, for instance, he may learn
how to distinguish a right of way from
an equipment. The franchises men
tioned were granted because the peo
ple of the city generally wished in
creased transportation facilities and if
the abolishment of rapid transit were
to be seriously entertained for a mo
ment the public (of which the Exam
iner is so fond and eternally tries to
humbug) would willingly pay $20,000,000
to have the status quo maintained. The
logician must produce some sounder
argument than this when attempting
to excoriate a street railroad company,
that is if he seriously hopes to get for
his paper another "advertising cofT
tract" which includes the phraseology
"and all in accordance with an agree
ment entered into between, etc."
In an account of the Golden Jubilee i
celebration which has appeared in Har- i
per's Weekly the question of Marshall's
right to be known as the discoverer of |
gold in California has been given much j
attention. Marshall is probably due the
credit, but that Hubert Howe Bancroft j
has pronounced him so (as Harper's j
points out) is about the greatest doubt
that could be placed on Marshall's
claim to the distinction. This man of
many books has had his character so j
clearly exposed by the different jour- j
nals of the State, and the local field I
of deceit having become about exhaust- |
ed in consequence, that he has shaken !
the dust of the city from off his feet i
and sped to solitude At any rate, we
hear of him no more. It may interest
Harper's to learn that this particular
Bancroft never was a historian. His
tory is truth, not fiction, and Hubert
Howe Bancroft's unquenchable desire
not to have the truth told if his pocket
would suffer thereby is known here, If \
not in New York. Some of the matter
that appeared under his name was ac
curate, but the fiction is so much in j
evidence that the whole work lias been
rendered valueless. Much of the hon
est writing in these volumes was done !
by Mrs. Frances Fuller Victor, a gen- !
tlewoman who declined to lie for pro- j
fit. Were she to be asked, it is certain j
that she would admit that what she j
conscientiously wrote about Indian I
wars in Oregon, Bancroft "switched !
into" what he calls California history. [
It was pleasing to notice some years '
ago in the woman's booth at some fair '
in the Mechanics' Pavilion that Mrs. I
Victor had the courage to show half a j
dozen or so volumes of the so-callod !
"Bancroft's Works," labeled "By F. F. j
Victor." Mrs. Victor is honest by na- I
true; Bancroft by nature is a . I
(Thi3 is not a missing word contest). ;
The man cannot even write English. [
He was heard to vow once that he had !
written the life of Henry Failing, the j
Portland, Or., banker. Probably he did i
essay the task, and assuming that he
did it is a fair sample of what he can !
do in the way of English, to say noth- ;
ing of history. In the first page cf !
what is said about Mr. Failing occurs !
a rambling collection of words between ;
two periods which this "historian" '
vowed was a sentence. It was pointed i
out to him that there was no predicate I
in his "sentence," whereat he testified ;
that he "saw nothing wrong with it." i
The mental passing of Adolph Sutro
Is a matter for keen regret. Reference
has been made to it with the respect
it deserves by all the local papers ex
cept the Post. Its veiled sneer at the :
unutterably sad condition of the mari i
whose energy has helped the poor of
, Sao Francisco in many ways, fits the j
general character of its utterances.
Nothing seems too despicable for the
organ of the railroad monopoly if either
of its masters' vicious tastes will be
| likely to be pleased thereky. In its
! base conduct it is without shame; it
I actually revels in its debasement.
! Sutra's memory is insulted because he
I compelled the Market Street Railroad
j Company to carry people to the ocean
beach for a nickel, because be fought
the odious funding bill tooth and nail,
and because he was of independent
character; he owned himself. A wise
Providence denies to the grov-ler the
privilege of understanding the nature
at a man who despisep a sycophant,
and, though there may be an editorial
smirk over this miserable attempt to
rail at a terrible misfortune, it is dis
dained by the decent of the world.
The Post's reputation has ever been
fishy, but since thechamelionicMcEwen
said in unmistakable English that De
Young had paid the Post $2000 to have
the management of the Midwinter Fair
"let alone" it has fallen still lower in
public esteem. And the charge has
never been distinctly denied, to say
nothing of making an effort to disprove
it.
Worden, the train-wrecker, has "con
fessed" his connection with the brutal
quintuple murder near Davisville three
years and a half ago. A casual read
ing of his statement shows that he ac
knowledges being an accessory aftef
the fact, and on that alone, of course,
hanging is his due, though I hanker not
for his blood. The possibilities are that
he was the drunken tool of others, but
as he has been respited till Jrfne there
is ample time for the bringing of his
accomplices to justice if they can be
found. If there is a particle of truth in
his story more than one other man
should pay the penalty to which he is
sentenced. In truth, those who could
incite a weak creature to commit a
crime of this fiendlike type are as unfit
to live as is he.

Judge Denny, Whose Great Run Saturday Made a New Record, and
Charlie Thorpe, His Rider.
The grand performance of the black horse Judge Denny at Emeryville track on Saturday last, when he reduced
the world's two-mile record, Is still the principal topic of conversation among horsemen. Many are inclined to argue that
the mark set, 3:2^. will stand for some time to come, while others opine that when the son of Fonso and Belle of
Nantura meet to-morrow he will have to step still faster to down Barney Schreiber's three-year-old. Judge Denny was
first brought to this coast and raced by the firm of MrXaughton & Muir, and while occasionally putting In a good
race did nothing to throw out the Impression that he was a world beater. However, like most of the get of Fonso, the
black colt shows improving form with age, and with light weight up has a chance to beat "most anybody's horse." He
has been fitted for all of his races by Sam Hildreth, considered by many the peer of any trainer in the country. It is
generally supposed that the Judge is the property of William Pinkerton of the great detective agency, though this may
be only hearsay. Hildreth neither denies nor confirms the rumor.
From whatever standpoint the performance is looked at it was a great one, and too much credit cannot be given his
rider, Charity Thorpe, the "grand old man of the saddle." When the stretch was reached the last time, with Marplot
simply galloping, the backers of the black horse experienced a feeling of gloom they were unable to dispel. Thorpe then
began one of his famous rides, and, responding gamely to his rider's urging, the Judge, foot by foot, overhauled the
three-year-old and snatched victory when defeat 6eemed inevitable. Many riders would have given up the task, but a
characteristic of Thorpe seems to be that he never acknowledges defeat until th c wire has been passed.

Miss Haind Rahy, pearl of the Syrian
colony of this city, and Rachid Rahy
were united in matrimony yesterday
afternoon by Father Quinn at St. Pat
rick's church.
It was a day of importance to local
Syrians and to d^ justice to the oc
casion, preparations for the nuptial
ceremonies began with the rising of the
sun. From the four quarters of
the city the Orientals, dressed and
bedecked with unwonted care, collect

f>2 Jessie street.
While the bride was in the midst of
the preparation of her toilet the ground
floor of the parental home was occu- i

cestors. From 2 until 4 the Syrians j
poured in .ike wolves en the fold." j
Solomon Rahy, father to the jewel of
the tribe, his left eye bandaged with a
flaming red silk kerchief, performed the i
honors so \v<^!l that, when the time for I
the wedding arrived, there was not a
thirsty Syrian for miles about.
The wedding itself was picturesque, i

enmities have arisen, was dressed in

; to the proudest scion of them all are I
i not yet at peace. They fear the wily
i Zachary and his threats. On Saturday
they consulted their attorney, Felix H :
Merzbach for advice, thinking that If j
j the disappointed lover were inearcerat- '
' ed until the marriage was solemnized i
I thinps would then go well. As it hap- '.
I pened, everything went as smoothly as
I a marriage bell should, and no harm is
ncrw anticipated from the Don Furioso
: of the story. The young couple will
not tour the southern portion of the !
State on their honeymoon.
The wedding was noteworthy for an- ;
other reason. Between the Rahy gens
and the Karsha gens, rival families of
the same tribe, many feuds have been
fought out. A Rahy was the cause of
much discomfiture to a Karsha upon
the latter's return to his native soil.
The Rahy apprised the vice-gerent of
the Sultan at Jaffa that this Karsha
had villified his most exalted Highness I
in America. So when the Karsha ar
rived In Jaffa a cordon of the Sultan's
cavalry welcomed him In a fashion that ;
engendered large doses of hatred and
revenge in the Karshan breast.
Karsha was finally released and re
turned to this city. For some months
after the Syrian districts in this city
were split in twain by warring fac
tions. But the hatchet of war is now
burled, for Obdala Karsha. chief of
his section, attended the wedding of
the Rahy.
Peace will now reign supreme, but
how long Is. a matter of conjecture. The
sporting element In the Syrian colony
Is now making books an that question.

GENIUS ON THE ALTAR OF MAMMON.
How the Apotheosis of Senator Stanford Was the
Martyrdom of Artist Thomas
Hill.
After an absence of thirteen years,
Thomas Hill, the artist, has come back
to San Francisco. The painter of the
great "Yosemite," which received the
first medal in the Centennial Exposi
tion in Philadelphia in 1876, looks old
now and feeble; older and frailer than
a man of his years ought to look. And
the main cause of his suffering is the
very thing on which he once built his
greatest hopes of fame and fortuneâ
the picture out at the Park Museum,
"Driving the Last Spike."
Thomas Hill has no tenderness for
this child of his brush. It is the black
sheep of his artistic family. What he
has suffered in connection with this
picture cannot be atoned for by all the
rest of his paintings combined. He
speaks of it as "that wretched picture,
that dreadful Spike picture!" He dis
likes to talk about it. The very thought
of it renews all the humiliation it has
caused him.
"I never want to see it again. Every
thing connected with it is hateful to
me. No one can realize what an agony
that picture embodies. That wretched,
wretched picture!"
Mr. Hill Is recovering from a paraly
tic stroke just now. His voice is weak,
and while he talks he sits in that effort
ful immobility that follows severe ill
ness. But not age nor sorrow nor suf
fering can quench the sense of humor
and the kindly good nature with which
the artist looks upon the world. His
trials have not embittered him, though
they have saddened his heart and shat
tered his health. He told me the story
of the celebrated picture yesterday in
temperate words such as a dignified,
honorable man uses in speaking of an
injustice done him.
"Mr. Stanfordâ Governor Stanford
he was then â ordered the picture.
We aareed upon a priceâ not to ex
ceed $25,000. When he discovered that
his associates in the railroad company
were infuriated at his egotism, at his
monopolizing the credit for work they
all had done, he repudiated the bar
gain he had made with me and refused
to pay for the picture. The "Last
Spike' cost Stanford the presidency of
the Southern Pacific. He wished to
evade the responsibility of what that
picture implied. And he sacrificed me
That is the whole story.
"Oh, you've no idea of the vanity,
the egotism of the man! He would
have walked over dead bodies to jus
tify himself. He believed there was
nothing too great for him, nothing to
which he might not aspire. He firmly
believed that some day he should be
President of the United States. Fancy
such a thing!"
Mr. Hill's blue eyes twinkled with
humor. Those eyes of his are very ex
pressive. As a rule they're mild and
soft, beneath his broad forehead, above
which the soft, abundant gray hair
waves. But they glow with anger,
lending an appearance of determina
tion to the artist's candid, simple face,
when the memory of the old wrong
stirs within him.
"It was in 1875 that Mr. Stanford
coniin;sMuried me t<> paini that pic
ture. I worked on it for years. Dozens
of men were sent to me by Stanford
to pose and I painted and repainted
put in this figure anci blotted that one
out, as he was in or out of favor with
Stanford. Every political wind, every
personal quarrel, made some altera
tion necessaryâ according to Stan
ford's ideaâ in the grouping of the
picture. Oh, I cannot tell you how
many alterations I made; how many
times, after painting a portrait from
life, I had to blot it out and paint over
it another face to gratify Governor
Stanford's vanity or enmity. The pic
ture's all Stanford. Youâ everybody
can see that. He wouldn't permit
any one but himself to be glorified in
it. Not only must he have the center
of the stage, but those whom he dis
liked or of whom he was jealous must
be subordinated or even taken out al
together. Oh, the weariness of being
subjected to that sort of thing!
"I had put Mr. Durant of the Union
Pacific, who drove the silver spike be
hind Stanford. When Stanford saw
that he objected immediately.
" 'Nobody must have a hammer but
me in that picture," he said. 'You've
given him too prominent a place any
way.'
" 'Well,' I asked, 'whom shall I place
there?'
" Put Strowbridge in his place ' he
said.
â¢'And Strowbridge did come clear up
from Arizona on a pass issued by the
office to pose for his picture.
" 'And where shall I put Mr. Durant?'
I asked then.
" 'Oh, it is not Important. He was
one of the Union Pacific people. It
doesn't matter.'
" 'I can place him where Mrs. Strow
bridge stands.'
" 'Yes.' said Stanford, 'and put Mrs.
Strowbridge by my side. She deserves
a first place, for she has been in the
lead all the way from Sacramento.'
"Mrs. Strowbridge had cooked for
them .all, had been with them through
all the hard work in the beginning, you
know. It was one of the best traits in
Stanford's nature that he should be
grateful to and remember her, *r>isn't
it?"
Perhaps It was. But with the light
that Thomas Hill throws on the dead
millionaire's character one Is more like
ly to believe that it was thÂ» impossi
bility of any rivalry between himself
! and a woman that induced Mr. Stan
1 ford to accord Mrs. Strowbridge so
i prominent a position.
"One day Stanford wanted Towne out
of the picture. I pleaded for Mr.
Towne, and Stanford finally consented
that he should be placed in the back
ground by the side of Colonel Grey.
Then his eye caught the figure of David
j D. Colton, and he exclaimed angrily:
" 'I don't want that man in. He has
no business there. He was not con
nected with the road at the time.'
"So Colton was taken out. MacCrel
lish of the Alta California came next.
Stanford's eyes flashed when he saw
MacCrellish's figure.
" 'Why have you got that man in? 1
he asked. I told him that I understood
McCrellish was present on the occa
sion, and that if I should leave him out,
being the editor of a paper, he would
annihilate me. 'I will annihilate you
if he is in,' Stanford answered. And
then he told me of the enmity between
MacCrellish and the railroad people. Of
course MacCrellish was taken out, and
Stanford said he 'would think up some
suitable person for the position.' He
decided upon his brother, A. P. Stan
ford. So his face was painted in
where MacCrellish's had been.
"I can't tell you," Mr. Hill went on,
passing his hand wearily over his face.
"It would tire you to listen to all the
changes I made under Mr. Stanford's
direction. I only mention them that
you may understand that I had been
ordered to paint the picture, and that
one of the proofs is that I made these
changes solely at Stanford's direction."
How absurd .c is to imagine Thomas
Hill, on his own responsibility, conceiv
ing a picture that should have for its
only aid the glorification of Mr. Stan
ford; of his arranging and rearranging
the" figures in it of his subordinating
every question of art ethics, of fitness,
of history and of truth to the rich
man's love of prominence and nis am
bition to be remembered by posterity.
And yet this is the stand that Stanford
took when he realized the light in
which his fellow projectors of the rail
road viewed the "Last Spike" picture.
He declared that Hill had painted the
picture without any authority from him
and that he was not responsible for the
idea of the grouping or anything con
nected with it.
"But mine wasn't the only case in
which he treated a poor devil in this
way," said Mr. Hill philosophically.
"He had ordered Stone â do you know
who Stone was? An artist, too, poor
fellow! Well, Stone had been ordered
to make drawings for statuary, repre
senting Stanford. The Governor showed
them to me. They were really beau
tifully done â but, imagine! Here was
Stanford high up on a locomotive, and
on the cow-catcher in front, Stanford's
son. But waitâ the locomotive was
represented as coming out of the
cluuds. Fancy a heavenly locomotive
and Stanford on it! The Governor saw
that he would make himself ridiculous,
after the thing was explained to him,
so he did with Stone what he did with
me; said that he had not ordered the
pictures and refused to pay for them.
Stone sued him and recovered about
one-fifth of what he should have been
paid for his time and his work."
"Did it never occur to you, Mr. Hill,
that you might take the thing into the
courts, too?"
"No. For one thing, I had no legal
proof of all I would swear is true. My
wife had destroyedâ as women will, you
know â all the notes and directions we
had had from Mr. and Mrs. Stanford.
It would be only my word against his.
And he was rich â he had been very
kind to me, too â and I was poor. I
didn't realize for some time that he
meant to repudiate it all. I went down
to the office on Townsend street, where
the little clerks had been so smooth
and so suavely polite before, and, now
that Stanford's humor had changed,
their affability had gone also. I waited
five hours in that horrible office, only
to be told that Mr. Stanford had gone
home without seeing me. Fourâ no,
fiveâ days I spent like that. And, at
last, when I was sick and weary with
waiting, a clerk told me in an off-hand
manner that Mr. Stanford had gone to
Europe.
"And so he had. He had gone away
to avoid me and the ridicule and ani
mosity the picture, as he wished It
painted, had stirred up against him.
"Why, you can't imagine the indig
nation these men felt at Stanford. One
of them said to me, "That is adâ pretty
picture, when men of my standing
have to be placed in the background!'
"Don't talk to me of the vanity of
women. I learned more, painting that
picture, of the littleness of men than
most people have any realization of.
Why. here's a case. You know Tritle,
ex-Governor of Arizona, was one of
the commissioners sent by the Govern
ment when the last spike was ham
mered in. Well, when Tritle came to
have his portrait painted, he had no
whiskers. You know Tritle's whisk
kers?"
I doâ l did, at least, and know them
to be worthy of you and to receive the
greatest admiration upon the Corn
stock years ago.
"Well, hero was Tritle's face going
in to the picture that enould hand him
down to posterity, and no whiskers!
Unfortunately he had just shaved
Poor Tritle with no whiskers' So he
decided that I should paint the whisk
ers on after I had finished his por
ci alt e* And J did - U makes him look
like Steve Gage, but you must remem
ber those whiskers didn't pose."
Here's to the man that can still find
fun in the world after the world has
treated him so shabbily!
Hill mortgaged his place at Seminary
Park so that his family might have
means on which to live while he was
working at the big picture, payment
for which should recompense him for
the timeâ it couldn't for the disgust
that must have filled his artistic 'soul
at such a commission-*he had given
When the great millionaire went to
Europe for a nleasure trip the artist
was left to face his creditors.
"I gave up our place," he said sim
ply. "I was heart-broken and my
health was failing. I couldn't face
such a debt, and my country home was
sacrificed for not half its cost. I crawl
ed away from San Francisco. I was
desperately ill. The worry had pros
trated me. In my despair I went to
George Crocker, told him my story and
asked for help.
" 'Well,' he declared, 'artists are fools
Show me the man under the sun not
an artist, who would have done a thing
like that without insuring himself by
some sort of contract.'
"He was right," Thomas HJII looked
across at me frankly. "And he prob
ably knew Stanford better than I did
We are fools. Artists are Incompetent
They need a guardian."
So they do, in their dealing with mill
ionaires, if Stanford was a type of rich
men.
"Crocker was very kind to me," con
tinued Mr. Hill. "He loaned me the
money. And I afterward repaid him
every cent, with interest, too. although
he didn't want to- accept that. It must
have surprised him to find an artist not
only able to earn $1000, but anxious to
repay it," Mr. Hill smiled knowingly.
"And did you never see Mr. Stanford
again?" I asked.
"Once, yes." Thomas Hill sat up
straight in the low rocker. "When he
got back from Europe, at last he saw
me by appointment. I went into the
office. There was one of the young
Crockers sitting there. I told Mr. Stan
ford about the picture, how I had had
to hire a studio and pay $26 a month,
merely to have a place to put the
wretched thing, and all the rest of it,"
he said, with a sigh.
" 'I'm sorry,' said Stanford. 'I've oft
en thought of some disposition that
should be made of your picture; that it
should be placed somewhere, as it's his
torical. But I really don't know what
I could do about it. I never ordered
it.'
"But his eyes had dropped to the
ground," Mr. Hill said, his own eyes
flashing with anger. "He didn't dare
to look me in the face and say that.
" 'Oh, you don't mean that!' I said
to him. 'Mr. Stanford, you don't mean
that.'
" 'Yes, I do,' he answered, but still
keeping his eyes bent upon the floor
â not daring to raise them, "I never or
dered that picture.'
" 'Well, you did,' I answered. 'But
that ends it. 'I'll never" speak to you
again about the picture. Never!'
"And I left him, but think of Â»t. I
had had two opportunities to sell the
picture. First a millionaire â don't men
tion his name, offered me $25,000, my
price; and later a man offered me $10,
000 if I would paint out Huntington
and put in Colton. I wrote to Stan
ford â this was, of course, before his
returnâ telling him of the offer, and he
wrote back vaguely that I shouldn't
change the picture, to leave it as it
was. He neither gave up his claim to
it nor accepted it, till it was too late
for me to dispose of it.
"And yet one day, long before this,
he had agreed to pay me $5000 on ac
countâfor the picture he never or
dered! And he had objected to my sell
ing photographs, and I had meekly
given up what might have been quite
a source of revenue, of my own pic
ture, the picture he says I painted
without any order from him I And on
the*.Â£3outhern Pacific's trains, on their
advertising folders, they printed, with
out my permission, and without paying
me for the privilege, copies of the
'Last Spike' picture, which Stanford
declared wasn't his property.
"Oh, well," Mr. Hill's sigh has more
of philosophy in it now than of dolor.
"That picture was fated to be un
fortunate. The Italian artist who stole
the idea of my picture â they had sent
out here from Washington for a copy
of the "Last Spike' â for the cupola at
Washington, was disappointed also.
For some reason, the design wasn't
accepted. Isn't it a sort of poetic Jus
tice that Stanford, who longed to be
immortalized in the capitol, more than
for anything else in this world, should
have failed in this, too?
"But it's all past now. And it isn't
the loss of the money that grieves me
so â though at one time, as I've told you,
that meant much to me. It's being
treated so shamefully. It's having the
public think that I painted that pic
ture of my own accord, and then tried
to make Stanford take it by lying about
an order from him.
"Oh, I know!" Mr. Hill waved a
deprecatory, thin white hand in an
swer to my exclamation. "People tell
you that it doesn't make any difference
what is said about me; that his friends
know and will justify him. But, right
at the same time, they're saying sagely,
'Where there's so much smoke there
must be some fire.'
"Mrs. Stanford knows that her hus
band ordered that picture, for she, her
self, when she saw MacCrellish's
figure in the picture, said:
'Don't put that man in! He
has made my husband suffer so!' If
Mrs. Stanford will only do me justice,
if she will put me right before the peo
ple, she may have the picture. I'm
through with it now, and I'll give it ta
her."
I went out to the park when I left
Mr. Hill to see the painting again. But
I can no longer look upon it without,
mentally, seeing a companion picture
of Thomas Hill, with his white hair and
his white beard and his invalid face, as
he sat telling its history. I hear that
gentle, quiet voice, like the chorus of a
Greek play, commenting upon, explain
ing the real motives of the lifelike fig
ures that crowd the stage; making
plain that which was obscure, justify
ing that which seemed unwise.
When you know the history that Is
painted in that great canvas out at
the Park Museum you'll look at It with
more interest. You'll try, behind each
painted face that is grouped about the
central figure, to find its predecessor,
as a geologist in laying bare one stra
tum after the other of earth's layers,
discovers the secrets of Nature's stu
dio. But of one thing you may be sure.
However great may have been the
changes to which, in the process of
making, this famous picture was sub
jected, one face, one figure has stood
like a rock, unchangeable. While all
about him eddied the shifting pictorial
fortunes that rose or fell at the pleas
ure or displeasure of the artist patron;
while Durant became Strowbrldge and
MacCrellish was bewitch' a into some
one else; while the merry 13-14-15 rail
road puzzle was being played down on
Townsend street and also on painted
canvas, the position of Stanford's fig
ure was never changed; Stanford's face
alone shone in the full effulgence of its
well-chosen prominence as steady, as
unalterable as a fixed star among a lot
of whirling meteors.
But the apothesis of Leland Stanford
in the "Last Spike" picture Is also the
artistic martyrdom of Thomas Hill.

TO BE TRIED BY
COURT-MARTIAL
Five Sailors of the Mohi
can Got Drunk on
Alcohol.
Four of the Naval Apprentices
Have Deserted the Train
ing Ship.
I.arpe Shipments of Opium Â»nd
Oranges Arrived on the Gaelic
From the Orient.
The pick of the crew of the United
States sloop of war Mohican are in
disgrace, and the apprentice boys are
not taking as kindly to discipline as
was expected. The lads have not yet
got used to confinement, and the sooner
the vessel is got away on her cruise the
better It will be for the boys. Five of
the sailors, headed by the equipment
yeoman, are in irons awaiting court
martial, and four of the boys ran away
the other day. A squad of marines is
now on their trail.
Pure alcohol got the sailors Into
trouble. After shore leave they re
turned to the ship with a raging thirst
which water could not quench. The
alcohol for mixing the paint and gen
eral use on shipboard was handy, and
the equipment yeoman had the key to
the locker. The drum in which it was
kept was soon produced and two or
three long swigs made the sailors feel
at peace with all the world. Two or
three more made them fighting drunk.
As a general rule they are the best
behaved men in the crew, but the pure
alcohol was too much for them and
they raised such a disturbance that
they finally had to be put in strait
jackets. When they sobered up they
were clapped into irons and are now In
the brig cooling their heels, awaiting a
court-martial that will end In loss of
pay and imprisonment.
Since their advent on the old war
ship the apprentice boys have been
making things lively. Hammocks have
been cut down when the persons oc
cupying them were in a sound slumber;
some of the crew were treated to a
cold bath when they least expected it,
ând pillow fights were of frequent oc
currence. The officers winked at many
a breach of discipline among the boys,
but when things began to go too far
something had to be done. In conse
quence some of the ringleaders were
punished and desertions followed.
Many of the lads who are Joining as
apprentices think their cruise on the
Mohican will be a pleasure trip to the
southern seas, and that they will have
nothing to do but enjoy themselves.
When they begin to find out their mis
take some of them begin to kick over
the traces, but the big majority are
settling down to their work and will be
a credit to San Francisco. The officers
of the Mohican have been chosen for
their ability in handling boys, and it
will not be their fault if every ap
prentice who sails away in the sloop of I
war does not return well versed in \
seamanship.
Much has been written about the ad- I
vance in coal, and many people blame I
the dealers for the raise. It is due, |
however, mainly*to the fact that nearly j
all the coal carriers have been divert- j
ed to- the Klondike trade. The Wachu- j
sett and Invincible are making their i
last trips to the Sound, after which !
they will carry coal to Dutch Harbor. !
Nearly all the other colliers will follow
suit in a month or so, and that will
leave this market in a great degree de- j
pendent on the Australian supply. |
When the last steamer left Sydney, X.
S. W., there were three vessels loading I
at Newcastle, N. S. W., and ten on the j
way. The coal cargoes of the latter I
will aggregate about 27,000 tons. There
are about forty vessels chartered to
load at the same port, and they will
bring about 100,000 tons, but many of !
the vessels will not get here until the
latter part of this year.
Coal freights from Australia are firm
at 15s. 6d., while last year at this time
Ts. 6d. was the ruling rate. It will thus
be seen that what with the advance in
freight and the scarcity of bottoms
there is not much chance for cheap coal
this year.
The work of getting the Australia
ready for the Klondike was being
rushed yesterday. The stores that are
useful only on a tropical run were put
on the wharf ready for transshipping to
the Zealandia. Captain Charles Good
all, Captain Bennett, superintendent of
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
and T. Turner, purchasing agent for
the same line, went all over the ocean
liner yesterday and noted everything
which will be required to make her the
finest vessel on the Dyea-Skaguay
route.
The Zealandia will leave on the Aus
tralia's time for Honolulu next Thurs
day and the Australia will get away
for Puget Sound the latter part of this
week. All of her crew with the excep
tion of Purser McCombe and Dr. Soule
will remain by the vessel. The Zea
landia will take a new crew.
The steam schooner Hermosa is the
latest addition to the Klondike fleet.
She used to run between the Santa
Catalina Islands and the mainland, but
her owners thought there was more
money in the Dyea-Skaguay trade so
they have brought her to San Fran
cisco to fit out. She will have some
alterations made to her cabins and
when all the repairs are completed she
will have accommodations for over a
hundred passenger?.
The steam schooner Alice Blanchard,
en route from Port Los Angeles for
Dyea and Skaguay, put in here last
night to take on a number of passen
gers. She brought up ninety people, of
whom four are women.
The Occidental and Oriental Com
pany's steamer Gaelic arrived from
Hongkong via Yokohama and Honolulu
yesterday. She would have arrived in
port last Saturday had it not been for
the fog, which detained her outside
thirty hours. The Gaelic brought out
thirty-one cabin passengers and thirty
one Chinese and five Japanese. Among
her cargo Is 452 cases of opium, valued
at 5257.000, the duty on which will be
$110,880. This is the largest consign
ment of the drug which has come to
this port for some time. There was also
among the cargo 1324 boxes of oranges,
all of which will have to be fumigated
hr-fore they will be allowed to go into
circulation.
The schooner Sparrow arrived in port
yesterday morning, eleven days from
Eureka, under a jury rudder. When
off Cape Mendoclno the vessel was
caught in a gale and the rudder head
carried away. A piece of spare timber
was brought into use and the makeshift
â¢was made with which the schooner was
steered into port.

JAMES' RESIGNATION IS NO SURPRISE.
General John H. Dickinson, the New Major-General.
There was a great deal of talk in National Guard circles yesterday over the
resignation of Major-General Nathaniel T. James, though it was not an unex
pected event. It has long been well known that General James was so absorbed
in his insurance business that he no longer desired to hold the position, and it
was at his request that he was succeeded by General Dickinson.
Major-General Nathaniel T. James, division commander, announced the
fact of the change to the members of his staff late on Friday night. He sup
plemented the announcement with the statement that he had tendered his resig
nation to the commander in chief with the understanding that he should name
his successor, and that he had named Brigadier-General John H. Dickinson (re
tired). He also stated that the nomination was apxeeable to the commander in
chief, who stated that he would, without delay, sigpo the commission of the new
division commander. The change of commanders of the National Guard of this State
will nowise disturb the staff selected by General James, as General Dickin
son expressed a desire that the members should remain with him. These are
Colonel Thomas M. Cluff, assistant adjutant peneral: Colonel John Gallwey, di
vision surgeon; Lieutenant-Colonel D. E. Miles, sipnal officer: Lieutenant-Colo
nel William Edwards, ordnance officer; Lieutenant-Colonel Louis Barrere, in
spector of rifle practice: Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Watt. Judge advocate; Lieu
tenant-Colonel A. B. C. Dohrmann. inspector; Lieutenant-Colonel Charles E.
Murphy, engineer officer; Lieutenant-Colonel Charles T. Stanley, quartermaster;
Lieutenant-Colonel Adolph Huber. commissary; Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Em
eric, paymaster: Major J. Fitzgerald and Major L. S. Schmitt. aids.
Major-General James assigned as a reason for his action that his business
engagements did not allow him the time to devote to the Guard that he would
like to In order to carry out his ideas for Its advancement. The general had his
own ideas of what ought to be done to bring the citizen soldiery to the stand
ard of the best of any State in the Union, but for some reason he did not meet
with the hearty co-operation that he expected, and a number of reforms that
he contemplated were not carried out. This gave rise to murniurings in the
Guard and the general was criticized in no unmeasured terms. It is an admit
ted fact that during the past six months his official position has been anything
but a pleasant one.
Major-General James received his commission as major-general July 21. 1596.
Previous to that he was lieutenant-colonel on the staff of Governor Budd. He
was United States Naval Officer from IS6S until 1.R74.
The new major-general has for a long time been interested in the affairs of
the National Guard, and was. while in active service, a very popular officer. He
enlisted as a private in Company B of the First Infantry April 1, 1577, was elected
captain of the company on the sth of the same month, was re-elected in 1579, and
on the 28th of June, 1880. he was elected colonel of the First Infantry; he was re
elected in 1884 and again in 1888. On the 16th of February, IS9I, he was appointed
brigadier-general of the Second Brigade, which position he held until the reor
ganization of the Guard, when he went on the retired list. During the last held
session of the Legislature he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Military
Affairs.
CELTS GATHER
AT THE CHUTES
Mayor Phelan Delivered
a Brief Address to
the Gathering.
Benefit to Raise Money to Build
a Hall for Irish
Societies.
Crowds Visit thÂ« Big Recreation
Grounds and Spend an En
joyable Day.
All day yesterday the Celts enjoyed
the day at the Chutes. During Satur
day and Sunday the big recreation
ground out on Haight street was
crowded with the members of the vari
ous Irish societies of the city and their
friends. The entertainment was in the
nature of a benefit for the Celtic Union,
as that organization wishes to branch
out and establish itself on a footing
second to no society in San Francisco.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon Mayor
Phelan addressed the gathering in the
big pavilion. He explained the object
of the Celtic Union benefit, to gather
funds with which to erect a building in
this city that under its roof all the
Irish societies may have a permanent
home. The address was not a long one,
and at its conclusion the gathering ap
plauded the speaker. '
Miss Pearl Hickman and Joseph P.
Keller were the next on the pro
gramme. They did some Irish step
dancing that was unique in its way and
called forth much favorable comment.
Chlquita, the living doll, also enter
tained the gathering for some time.
Various other amusements attracted
the crowd, which remained within the
grounds until late in the evening.
MARRIED AS AN
ADVERTISEMENT
Henry Miller and Miss Fanny
Turner United but Soon
Separated.
Had No Intention of Going North, but
Played Their Parts for a Con
sideration.
An acquaintance of three weeks, an of
fer of a certain sum of money to perform
an agreement to marry, the performance
of the agreement, a separation within
two hours after the ceremony, receipting
for the money and an acceptance of a
few presents, among them a wedding
cake and a Klondike outfit, marked the
marriage of Henry Miller, better known
as William Raymond, a variety perform
er, and Fanny Turner, who is reported to
j?* qA Preagot with herjslster in San Josp^
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1898.
Rev. Dr. Ford performed what was
pleased to be termed a Klondike marriage
Tuesday evening in Mechanics' Pavilion,
and the above parties were united, but
for money alone, according to the state
ment of Miller himself.
It had been advertised that the couple
were to be married prior to their depar
ture to the Alaskan golu fields, but now
the wedding cake and the outfit are for
sale to the one who will give the price
askt>d, and the parties who had never in
tended to go north on a wedding tour are
separated and apparently happy.
From statements made it is learned
that tht- couple received $75 for the per
formance before thousands of interested
spectators. Miller took $50 and his wife
g-ot the remainder. It is said that Archie
Levi. who has known and employed Mil
ler for some time, also had a share of the
sum total, $150, which had been offered
by the enterprising people who thought
of the drawing card.
After the ceremony the couple visited
the sights in the Pavilion, and then, ac
cording to dame rumor, separated. At
any rate the groom was seen last even
ing in a local coffee saloon enjoying him
self with a cup of coffee and common or
dinary doughnuts, rather a frugal repast
after such an interesting and profitable
performance according to contract.
It had been reported that the couple had
courted for the past few months, and had
thoroughly made up their minds to enter
into the bonds of matrimony. This is
denied, however, by Miller, who states
he met the young lady but three weeks
ago in a lodging-house where he had been
staying, and that the money was offered
him to marry the young lady merely as
a drawing card for the Mining Fair. The
friends or Miller are having considerable
amusement at his expense, and it is
thought he would be glad to go north to
escape their jests.

NATIONAL
GUARD NOTES
Whatlt Is Hoped the New-
Division Commander
Will Do.
New Service Uniforms Will
Soon Be Ready for
Distribution.
A United States Army Officer's Views
of the National Guard
Organization.
The resignation of Major General
James as division commander of the Na
tional Guard, while it came in the na
ture of a surprise in view of the asser
tion oft made that "the major general
might die, but would never surrender"
it was not wholly unexpected. It was
the talk in the guard for some time past
that it was not likely that the strained
relations between the commander-in
chief and the division commander could
last until the end of the term of Gover
nor Budd. Whatever may have brought
about such a condition of coolness be
tween the two officials is known to them
selves and neither will tell. Now that
the change has taken place the hope is
expressed that the new major general
will Inaugurate such measures as will
be conducive to creating an interest in
the guard and make it more than a mere
parade organization.
The Pettibone Company that has the
contract for furnishing service uniforms
to the National Guardsmen of this State
has notified its agents in this city that
nearly all the orders received have* been
filled, and that within a short time the
company will be ready to sort the sizes
and ship the goods. This would have
been done sooner had it not been for
the delay occasioned by some of the
companies in not complying with the
orders to send on the number of each
size required. One company did not
comply with that request until last Wed
nesday. The company having the con
tract announces that the cloth that has
been used in the make up of the uni
forms is exactly the same that is used
for the United States army, and that
before the goods are delivered to the com
panies they will be submitted to such
tests as the Uniform Board shall deter
mine upon to show that they are up to
the specifications.
As already announced in this depart
ment, the o"fficers of the Fifth Infantry
drew attention to the very unsatisfactory
condition of the target practice at this
time and suggested that a meeting < f
inspectors of rirte practice be called to
devise some method of making changes
that will meet the requirements of the
law and at the same time not be a hard
ship on the men. The Board of Officers
of the First Infantry was to have taken
some action in this matter at its meet
ing last Thursday night, but the. sub
ject was overlooked. In the meantime
Lieutenant E. S. Heller, inspector of rifle
practice for the Fifth Infantry, commun
icated with Colonel Park Henshaw, in
spector general of rifle practice, inclos
ing a statement of the action Â«;f the of
ficers of the Fifth. His response was
that he favored the suggestion, and there
is a possibility that such a meeting will
be called at some time in the future.
The law as it now stands declares that
the members of the National Guard must
do certain things at stated periods to
qualify as marksmen, and that they must
parade for the purpose of target prac
tice at such times as may be designated
by the commander-in-chief, but the
commander-in-chief has not. since the
law has been in force, ordered such a
parade, and the men of the several bri
gades have gone to the ranges, if they
felt like It. and have kept away if they
did not feel inclined to go. As there is
no penalty for not going to the range
the men feel that if the superior officers
fail to < arry out the law they are at lib
erty to disobey orders, and if the feeling
that exists at this time continues the men
will argue that if they can disobey the
laws and orders in one case they will be
able to do so with impunity in other
cases, and it will not be long before de
demoralization reigns supreme all along
the line.
There are many of the officers of the
guard who are of the opinion that wiih
the issuance of a commission to them it
Is time to cease military study. On the
contrary, they should from that time on
continue to improve themselves in the
art of war. so that in case of emergency
the knowledge which it is fair to pre
sume they would acquire would be of im
mediate service to the Government. There
are many officers who appear to be of
the opinion that ability to command
"fours right" or "left," and in a few in
stances to give the command for the de
ployments of a squad, but without knowl
edge as to when arwl why certain move
ments are to ue executed, is all the
knowledge required. Every officer should
pay proper attention to the care and
handing of men in the field, the prepara
tion of reports and papers, all of which
can be Â»asily learned by studious and
painstaking National Guard officers.
There should be schools of instruction,
and if, after the first term, officers failed
to show any improvement or advance
ment, they should be given an oppor
tunity of retiring, to make way for more
ambitious men, who would bring the
guard up to its proper standard. In a
prize essay by Lieutenant S. M. Foote,
Fourth United States Artillery, on,
"Based on Present Conditions and Past
Experiences, How Should Our "Volunteer
Armies Be Raised, Organized. Trained
and Mobilized for Future Wars?" pub
lished in a recent issue of the Military
Service Institution, he says, after draw
ing attention to the "crying want in the
North at the outbreak of the Civil War
for Instructed and competent officers":
But since, a great change has taken place,
especially in the larger and wealthier States.
The organized National Guard is now in a
much better condition in every way than it
was thenâ so much better, In fact, as to be
practically a different class of troops. This
advancement has been brought about in a great
degree by the active interest taken by the
General Government in its condition, welfare
and improvement. The organizations in the
different States are becoming somewhat more
uniform in arms, equipments and dress, as well
as in discipline and drill, and in the qualifica
tion of officers. But there is still and there
must ever be, in the nature of things, vast dif
ferences in the quality and efficiency of even
regiments of the same State, and differences
vaster between the organizations of differ
ent States. Some States make generous appro
priations, have annual encampments and in
spections by regular officers and maintain their
National Guard in excellent condition. Others
have no annual training or inspection and
make no appropriation at all. In some organi
zations the fact that a man is an officer is in
Itself a guarantee that he is, to a certain ex
tent at least, an educated, intelligent soldier
and gentleman; but in most National Guard
organizations it must be confessed that many
of the officers are not properly fitted for the
positions they hold.
Some of the best militia regiments are those
that would wish to remain in the service the
shortest period in time of war. Take the Sev
enth Regiment of New Tork, for instance, the
crack militia regiment of the United States be
fore the war, the original National Guard. It
made special arrangements with the War De
partment in IS6I by which it was to remain in
the United States' service only one month In
stead of three. It afterward furnished enough
officers of volunteers to make a whole regi
ment, and at the same time keeping up its or
ganization as a militia regiment during the
war. doing valuable service both at home and
at the front in emergencies. It would certainly
have been bad policy to keep those men to
gether as a regiment instead of scattering:
them abroad to officer and instruct raw levies.

WILD SCENE
AT A FUNERAL
An Escaped Prisoner Is
Dragged From His
Mother's Side.
After a Desperate Struggle He
Was Handcuffed and
Taken Away.
The Shrieks of His Mother, Brothers
and Sisters Attracted a Large
Crowd.
An exciting and dramatic scene oc
curred yesterday in front of St. Rose's
Church, on Brannan street, near
Fourth, in which a deputy sheriff and
an escaped prisoner from the House of
Correction played the principal parts.
James Brogan, a son of John Brogan,
a marine fireman, living on Fargo
place, died last Friday, and his fune
ral took place yesterday. One of his
brothers, John, is in the City Prison, on
a charge of burglary, and at the urgent
request of his mother Chief Lees de
tailed Policemen Coughlin and Carr to
take John to- his mother's house, so that
he could get a last look at his dead
brother's face.
When they reached the house the cof
fin was being put in the hearse, and
Mrs. Brogan asked the officers to go j
with her son to St. Rose's Church, and i
he might get a look at his brother's \
face there. They went to the church, I
but the undertaker refused to take off
the lid of the coffin. The officers re
mained in the church during the serv
ice, and when it was over they waited
until the coffin was carried out and
placed in the hearse. There was only
one carriage, which was occupied by
Bfrs. Brogan, her eldest son, Michael,
I 20 years of age, and three small chil- :
I dren. Her husband is with his vessel j
on the way to Alaska.
John, with tears in his eyes, had ;
kissed his mother good-by, and the door
of the carriage had just closed upon
her, when a man stepped forward, and, j
announcing himself as a deputy sher- \
iff, ordered Michael to come out of the
carriage.
The two policemen asked him what
was the matter, and he replied, point
ing to Michael, "That young fellow es
caped frc-m the House of Correction
about three months ago, and we have
i been looking for him since." Michael
! refused to leave the carriage, saying
i he wanted to attend his brother's fune
â  ral, but the deputy sheriff, who said his
| name was Frank Naseby, took hold of
j him and dragged him out. Michael
fought desperately, and as his mother
and her young children commenced to
scream a big crowd quickly gathered.
Naseby succeeded in getting one hand
j cuff on, and, becoming exasperated at
i Michael's resistance, he put his hand
: in his hip pocket, and said he would
| shoot if he did not quit.
Michael was urged on by his brother
John not to go with Naseby, and there
would have been serious tro-Ã¼ble if the
j two policemen had not poured oil on '
the troubled waters by advising Naseby
not to draw his revolver and keeping '
! James in subjection. The crowd hissed
! the deputy, and it is possible if the po
i licemen had not been there he would
I have been mobbed. He finally succeed
â  ed in securely handcuffing Michael and
i led him away, amid the howls of the
! crowd and the shrieks of Mrs. Brogan
! and her children. Coughlin and Carr
| hurried away with James and took him
i back to the prison.
Michael was arrested on September 4
: under the name of Thomas Greene, on
charges of vagrancy, petty larceny and
burglary. The first two charges were i
i dismissed, and the burglary charge ;
j haying been reduced to petty larceny, j
he was sentenced to six months in the ;
! House o-f Correction. He* escaped about
I three months ago. He and his brother >
i John are known as railroad car thieves. ;

BACK SEATS
FOR CROAKERS
Effect of Electric Lines in
Developing the City
of Oakland.
How Outside Towns Could
Have Their Eyes
Opened.
Some Interesting Views of a Mem
ber of the Ebell So
ciety.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, !
908 Broadway, Feb. 13.
If the pessimists and croakers of Oak
land have not so completely stunts!
their mental growth that they <<Uk no |
longer think, a little statement made i
this week in the press must surely can
rtnca them that they should change
their tune or move on to another town.
This particular foot to which I refer ;
is that the electric railroad syndicate !
is now, and has been for some time, j
payirg nut $2.",0'"> a month in wages.
Now glance back eight years. At that
time there was not a foot of eleCtfte
track in this city, and the blocks which !
are now the leading business centers of
Oakland were vacant lots. A few
lonely horse cars moved along slowly
till about 11 p. m., and then the city
retired.
In 1889 Oakland was one of the least
progressive cities on the coast, and was
run solely for the benefit of a few poli
ticians and a couple of corporations.
Then came a great change. The
whole city received literally an electric
shook. Street railroads were run in all
directions. West Oakland was invaded
by four distinct linos, all coming to the
center of towiL Berkeley was connect
ed with Oakland by two fine routes. Ala
meda and Fruitvale, East Oakland, Le
ona and Mills College. Haywards, Pied
mont and the cemeteries were all
reached by electric roads, and one-half
the county was so completely tied to
gether that, although it may not come
under one government for ten years, it
Is now practically one large munici
pality.
These roads represented investments
of some millions of dollars. It all went
in labor, and eventually into the pock
eta erf merchants, who again invested
It in large blocks, making more labor.
Towns crew up between Oakland and
Haywards; while riding now from Oak
land t<> Berkeley there is no dividing
line, houses being erected all the way;
Fruitvale has developed, and is only di
vided by a bridge from Alameda, and
in all directions new life has come into
dry bones. In addition to all this, a
new industry has arisen, that of th i
army of street-car men â mo-tormen, :
conductors, cleaners and repairers, who
are a permanent addition to the popu- i
lation, and among whom $25,000 is now
being paid each month by the syndi- ,
cate railroads, in addition to perhaps
SSOOO paid by the Broadway lines, and
not any less by the Haywards compa-
ny.
This $41,000 per month put into the
pockets of workingmen is respectfully
called to the attention of those who
fondly refer to the "good old times" |
when* things were so much "better and \
different."
Dr. Chamberlain's letter to his
brother members of the Board of
Health deserves more than the passing
notice hitherto given it. The doctor
had good ground for writing as he did,
and the only trouble in the matter is
that the members of the Board of
Health, being scientific men and
doctors of high repute, cannot aiso be
expected to be politicians and practi' .;!
economists. Thus, when they hml a
very careful analytical examination
made of the water supply of this city,
they deckled it was their duty to adopt
thert-purt. This being done it became
a public document, and the report that
foretold of death and other horrible
things was scattered broadcast.
Worse than that, it was made the
basis by rival cities of Oakland in other
parts of the State of an attack on this
city, and a fearful warning was given
all intending settlers to keep away
from Oakland. This, of course, was not
foreseen by the doctors of the Board of
Health, all of whom have the best in
terests of the city at heart, commer
cially as well as hygienically.
Then came the annual report of the
Health Officer, Dr. J. P. Dunn, who is
not a member of the board, and he
wrote:
The health of the city has remained
at its usual high standard during the past
year, the death rate being only 12.22. In
comparison with the majority of cities
in the United States this is extremely low.
The very low death rate from zymotic
diseases that was a marked feature in
last year's report can, we are glad to flay,
be again recorded this year, and there
can be no doubt but' that, when our
marshes are filled in and drained and
some further improvements made in our
â ewers, this will fall still tower, we have
especial cause to congratulate ourselves
upon our relative immunity from those
scourges of Eastern and European cities,
diphtheria and diarrheal cas-s.
This caused Dr. Chamberlain, who
did not help to pass the water report,
to remark in his letter published this
morning:
I regret that this Board has been placed
in the position of advertising one water
company to the detriment of the other,
and that the publication of any such clr
cularas that recently distributed through
out the city was made possible.
I believe that the methods suggested by
the preceding Board, if faithfully followed
out, would have succeeded very soon in
purifying the water t-upply in question
and would have avoided the unfavorable
advertising just glv^n our city. Such pro
ceedings would only have been justified,
to my mind, had there been a recent epi
demic of typhoid feTer or dysentery; but
with a death rate averaging unusually
low, I cannot see the need for any such
action.
Does the doctor mean to Imply that
the water company's fight cut any
figure with his colleagues on the Board
of Health?
It is Interesting to observe how the
press of Alameda, Berkeley, Elmhurst ;
and San Leandro rises with one ac- j
cord and denounces the ambition of \
Oakland to absorb the territory ad- ;
jacent to it in a city and county. These â¢
t'.wns are evidently suspicious that .
Oakland may not give them as clean !
a political deal as they are now re- j
ceivlng from their several administra
tions. Alameda is virulent, Berkeley
is a little less so. San Leandro 1b really
rude, and the Elmhurst Review goes
outside the bounds of propriety and
says:
It would be more creditable to the pro- '
ponents of the annexation scheme if they ;
would devise some means to take care of t
the neglected streets In the outlying por- I
tions of Oakland before they seek to en- j
large the dominion of their city govern
ment. One can pass along in thickly set- j
tied portions of the community and look
upon block after block in a condition
which is a disgrace to the name of the j
Athens of the Pacific. Large municipal)- j
ties are not desirable. They are difficult i
to protect from the ravages of political
bosses. Vice and crime are iiore ram- j
pant than in smaller communities. The
rate of taxation is necessarily high, for
large revenues must be raised to supply
the bands of corruptlonists who live upon
the lootings of the public treasury.
This is unpleasant. It is now In
order for the Board of Trade and the
j Merchants' Exchange to organize ex
j cursions to these places, bring these
I unappreciatlve populations here, show
them our streets and public buildings
! (excepting temporarily the City
Prison), and then take them to Gier's
! Hull, where Mayor Thomas should
I convince them of the immaculate pur
ity of tho purged political conditions
of this city. After this, the residents
of these towns will surely tumble over
tht-mselves in their mad rush to re
cord their votes for annexation, and
| Ben Lamborn of Alameda will be their
leader.
The ladles of the Ebell Society, who
wish to preserve their exclusiveness
and who do not wis-h to affiliate with
any general organization of clubs,
should make public the reasons for
their belief in justice to themselves. If
the 400 ladies comprising the Ebell have
discovered by experience some phases
of club life that might be helpful to
others â and in the years of their exis
tence as a club they surely haye â it is
not fraternal that they should desire to
keep this helpful experience to them
selves. Nor is it reasonable to suppose
that the Ebell Is so perfect that it can
not learn something from other clubs.
There is such a thing as being too ex
clusive and the Ebell seems to have
reached that point. A body of 400 ac
tive women, all desirous of dning good,
can accomplish untold good in a com
munity like Oakland, but so far the
Ebell has been so confined to itself that
the city at large knows nothing of its
real work and the white Greek temple
on Harrison street is regarded some
what as a housp of mystery. There Is a
nobler work fur 400 of Oakland's best
women to do than to amuse and Inter
est each other, and that is to let those
outside of the pale receive the full bene
fit of their efforts in some such manner
as that outlined by Mrs. John Russ be
fore the club three weeks ago. These
ideas will not receive the indorsement
of many of the members, but they were
given me by one of the ladies and are
certainly worth consideration.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1898.
AT THE MERCY
OF SCAVENGERS
End of a Struggle That
Has Lasted Three
Years.
At One Time Dynamite Cut a
Figure in the Heated
Warfare.
Bankruptcy Overtakes thÂ« New Com
pany and the Union
Wins.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 12.
The Oakland Scavengers' Union has
j pursued its war against the holders of
the garbage franchise and the owners
of the crematory with such persistence
and sagacity that they are now to be
come the owners of the franchise grant
ed to their competitors.
This stroke of policy is the culmina
tion of two years' bitter Warfare that
has brought the crematory corporation
to bankruptcy, and has cost the Scav
engers' Union a large sum erf money
for litigation, and has entailed heavy
expenses on both sides.
The scavengers have from the first
refused to deliver their garbage to the
crematory, as required by the ordi
nance. They have put all sorts of ob
stacles in the way of the crematory
company, and on one occasion the
crematory people claimed to have
| found two sticks of dynamite among
| the garbage, and asserted that it was
| the intention of the scavengers to de
i stroy the plant. The scavengers de
clared that the company had given out
the story to enlist public sympathy on
j its side, and that the dynamite was
| purely imaginary.
Some time after this incident the
| crematory company demanded that the
I scavengers pay for each load as it was
! delivered, and this caused another
I skirmish. Then it was discovered that
only about one-fourth of the garbage
was delivered to the company, and a
â¢ hunt was made for the place where the
j scavengers were dumping their loads,
for such is an offense against a city
ordinance. Everything that the Coun-
I cil could do to help the company use its
! franchise was done, but the scavengers
chartered cars and ran the garbage to
: a point neross the county line, and this
i could not be prevented.
At last the crematory people went
i into insolvency after losing about $10,
000. Now the creditors want to raise
i something on their claims, and the
only thing rrf any worth is the fran
; chise granted by the Council for the
' exclusive collection of garbage. As the
' scavengers now have the upper hand,
| they can afford to be generous, and so
they are prepared to pay a moderate
sum for it and thus insure their free
dom from molestation for several years.
They will not use the crematory in
â  North Oakland, but will continue to
haul the garbage out to the hills.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow files with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath It, If any, the
! amount of rainfall, of melted snow In Inches
and hundredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
I temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric preÃsure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

TO THE MEMORY OF LINCOLN
Religious Exercises Held in Various Churches
Throughout the City to Commemorate a *
Great Day-Sermons on a Hero's
Life and Works,
rr\ HE anniversary of Lincoln's birth was solemnly and appropriately com
memorated yesterday in the churches throughout the city, many laudable
[ tributes of respect and veneration for his memory being delivered from the
X-ulpit in eulogium of his life and character. Many children Joined In the
choral services.
In addition to the insertion of a Te Deum In the usual religious services,
many of the Protestant and Methodist Episcopal churches had arranged com
plete programmes of memorial exercises for observance in the evening: in place
of the usual ceremonies. These exercises consisted for the most part of pa
triotic songs, prayers and religious hymns.
Among the various churches that dedicated special services to the memory
of Lincoln's birth were the following:
CALIFORNIA M. E. CHURCH.
Rev. J. W. Phelpsâ Yesterday brought
us once morthto the birth of Abrahin:
Lincoln. That this day is crowded with
associations at gTave import to the c'.ri
zens of our republic no one will deny.
Not opposing armies merely, but oppos
ing ideas confronted each other on tho
battle field.
The victory of our cause has dimmed
the jewels in every crown and has vin
dicated the right of the people every
where to govern themselves.
Whenever a crisis has arisen in na
tional affairs there has always been given
us the man to meet it.
It has pleased God in his wise and good
providenoe to give to this republic in the
last third of a century a mofrt sovereign
man â one "whose name constitutes one of
the twelve or fourteen really great names
that will survive all times and civiliza
tionsâand that man is Abraham Lin-
coin.
The whole spirit of his life is disclosed
during that period of his career when
a young man on the Western frontier.
He was exceedingly fond of outdoor
athletic sport, but he never could have
his full share In any of the races, con
flicts or games; because his comrades
were constantly choosing him to act In
the position of judge. He was consid
ered too just an umpire to act as cham
pion.
It was Lincoln who wrote, "T never
willingly planted a thorn in any man's
bosom." It was Lincoln who so fairly
stated the other side to the Jury that his
clients feared he would concede away
their cause. It was Lincoln who. In a
dark and stormy hour, wrote these words:
"Let us hold fast the faith that right
makes might; and in that faith let us
dare to do our duty to the end as we
understand it." These are words that
will be quoted centuries and centuries
hence.
These packed proverbs, these wonder
ful sayings of Abraham Lincoln will
henceforth be a part of the imperishable
literature of mankind. Have you for
gotten his sympathy with the suffering?
Have you forgotten his calm reliance
on the vitality and Invincibility of moral
forces?
PLYMOUTH CONGREGA
TIONAL.
Every effort had been made by the Rev.
T. B. Cherrington. pastor of this church,
to make the religious celebration in honor
of the anniversary of Lincoln day a mem
orable event in the history of the church
and a service long to be remembered by
the congregation.
The church was crowded with enthusi
astic worshipers, whose only thought was
That of appropriately dedicating their of
ferings ot prayer to the honor and eternal
rest of one of the greatest souls that this
country has ever recorded among its citi
zens during its brief history.
A special invitation had been extended
to the Grand Army comrades, and judg
ing by the large number who responded
this special mark of consideration was
more than appreciated by them.
The old soldiers joined in the patriotic
songs with a vim and enthusiasm which
was prompted by a recollection of the
martial airs which at one time goaded
them on to victory. The services were
concluded with a Te Deum sung by the
entire congregation.
THIRD CONGREGATIONAL.
The Rev. William Rader. pastor of this
church, chose, as. did many of hie brother
ministers, Lincoln's life as the subject

employ a large number of laboring men.
Hfs wife is somthlng of a society woman,
and the weekly tea-drinking seances
â¢which she holds in her hotel are always
well attended by the solemn-visaged ma
trons who compose the ultra-select cir
cle of swell San Francisco. Bantwer has
among his other employes a character
named Duff3\ who, when sober. Is a flrst
class man, but whose love for the frothy
steam and the exhilarating tanglefoot
causes him to be discharged periodically.
A short time ago Duffy got up against it,
and, as usual, received his conge. He left
the vicinity of the mine, where he had
been working, and nothing was heard of
him until last Wednesday, when a knock
came at the door of Mrs. Bantwer*s room,
where she was sitting with a few of her
most severely critical friends discussing
the latest developments in the Sallsbury-
Greenway feud. Almost immediately the
portal opened, and through It floated
about as hard a looking character as the
Barbary Coast could produce. Not one
whit abashed by the looks of abhorrence
and disgust that greeted him he advanced
to the middle of the room, and, addreas
SIMPSON MEMORIAL.
A special programme was arranged by
the pastor. Rev. R. J. Stephens, last even
ing to take the place of the usual Sun
day night service. The programme con
sisted of patriotic 'exercises and relig
ions hymns, which proved to be not only
enjoyable, but also interesting and In
structive.
In addition to the memorial service
the pastor delivered a sermon on the sub
ject of the public career of Lincoln. The j
address was well delivered and the ex- \
amples held up by the preacher as worthy ,
of imitation were many and various.
The programme of exercises was de- j
livered as follows: Voluntary, national !
melodies. Professor Bogart; opening an- I
them, the choir; hymn. 1092, congrega- i
tion; anthem, "Te Deum Laudamus," by !
the choir: scripture reading, by the pas
tor; music, "Hail Columbia." by the choir !
and Sunday-school; Gettysburg address, !
Frank Robison; hymn, 1103, congrega- I
tion; offertory, organ solo, selected; mv- |
sic, "Red, White and Blue," tenor solo, '
choir and Sunday-school; address, Rev. i
John Stephens; "Star Spangled Banner," j
soprano soio. Miss Alma Berglund; hymn,
1089, congregation; postluTie, 'â¢Triumphal
March From 'Xamaan.' "
CENTRAL METHODIST.
The most novel subject chosen by a. i
minister from the many laudable traits of I
Lincoln's character was based upon the '
query, "Was He a Christian?" This is a \
subject seldom taken into consideration in i
the exemplary life of the martyr and in j
consequence much interest was "manifest- i
ed as to what argument the preacher [
would advance in determining the doubt. '
In addition to the usual service special j
prayers were said and hymns sung in |
honor of the occasion.
FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH.
Rev. E. A. Wood preached on "The Life
and Character of Abraham Lincoln."
From the commencement of the ex
pansion of this subject the preacher en
deavored to place before his congrega- j
tion the many laudable traits of the I
martyr's character and the many re- I
markable and unusual incidents which ;
distinguished both his private and pub
lic career.
At the conclusion of the sermon a well
arranged programme of memorial ser
vices was rendered, being participated In
by the members of the entire congrega
tion.
The choir was specially augmented for
the occasion, there being in addition to
the usual number many talented and
noted singers.
FIRST CHURCH, OAKLAND.
Rev. E. R. Dllle, pastor of the First M.
E. Church, Oakland, and post chaplain of
the Department of California, G. A. R.,
addressed the Sons of Veterans. O. A. R.
and W. R. C. members last night. There
was special music by the choir, while the i
platform and choir loft were tastefully j
decorated with the national flag. A por- j
trait of Abraham Lincoln occupied a
prominent position beside the pulpit. The
attendance was so large that many were
turned away. Dr. Dille's text was taken ;
from Hebrews, eleventh chapter and part i
of the fourth verse, "He being dead, yet
speaketh." He said he spoke for the Sons '
of veterans, sons of illustrious sires who
were banded together to keep green the
memory of those who had defended their
country in the hour of need. The mem
bers of the G. A. R. could die knowing
that in case of another war there were
those who would fill the places held by
them In former years. Abraham Lincoln
was great because he did his humble duty
In a lowly place. When God would make '
a great man. he first made a great moth- i
er. No great man has ever been born of i
a. woman of poor stock. So with Lincoln '
his mother was a true, grand woman.
ing Mrs. Ban'twer, said: "Me frin' Duffy
has bin on der worstest drunk dat yer
ever saw, an' he is too proud ter put
himself on der charity list of der best
man llvin', but he tole me f cum an' see
yer as yer was a old frin' of his an' would
let him have th' loan of er couple of
cases till he sobers up."
Duffy's friend got the "cases" in a
hurry, but his visit broke up the party
and procured for the management of the
hotel a roast from the hostess that was
more than warm.

PACIFIC COASTERS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â Mrs. J. N.
Dolph, widow of the late ex-Senator
Dolph of Oregon, expects to leave in
several weeks for Portland, to remain
there until June, when she will probably
Bail for Europe. Contrary to her earlier
plans, Miss Ruth Dolph will not come to
Washington before the latter part of
April. There is universal regret at the
sudden departure of Major and Mrs.
Lewis Smith. They left Saturday for San
Francisco, the home of Mrs. Smith, which
is one of the beautiful mansions that
adorn Presidio Heights. Mrs. Smith was
one of the most charming young matrons
at Washington barracks.

ARTILLERY PROMOTIONS.
Retirement of Majors Chester and
Smith, TJ. S. A., Advance
Younger Officers.
Promotion in the. artillery is a subject
that engages unusual attention in army
circles, as advancement in that branch
of the service is nof by any means rapid.
Yesterday the wires flashed congratula
tory messages to several young officers
!at the Presidio when Major Ches
: ter. Third Artillery, retired, but this did
j not cause excitement, as his retirement
I was slated. V. hen. a private message
was received by wire from Washington,
1 D. C, that Major Smith of the Fourth
I Artillery had asked to be retired much
interest was manuested in the event.
The retirement of Major Chester pro
. motes Arthur Murray, First Artillery, to
I captain and promotes Captain Van An
' druss to the rank of major. The retire
! merit of Major Smith will promote Cap
| tain Frank W. Hess, Battery 1,, Third
I Artillery, Alcatraz, to the rank of major
! and will advance First Lieutenant Wil
liam E. BirkWÂ»er, Third Artillery, to
1 the grade of captain. Two additional
! second lieutenants of the Third Artillery
i will also go up a notch, and lieutenants
| above them will go higher.
Sunday at the Park.
Thousands of people enjoyed the sun,
the flowers and the music at Golden Gate
Park yesterday. Early In the day the
throngs began to gather In the city's
pleasure ground and out at the beach,
and by 2 o'clock. vahen the musical pro
gramme commenced, the shaded walks
I were jammed with humanity. Notwith
standing the crowds no accidents oc
curred to cast its shadow on the pleasure
of the day. One horse out on the road
near the Cliff House made a feeble at
tempt to run away, but was caught by a
mounted policeman, and the occupants of
the buggy which it drew escaped with a,

SEAWELL
WILL HEAR
A SENSATION
Suit of C. B. Polhemus
Against C. Mayne
to Be Tried.
Was the Board of Super
visors Bribed in the
. Matter?
Hundreds of Thousands Ex
changed for Mere
Thousands.
POLHEMUS WANTS RELIEF
Htetory of the Market-Street Com
pany Will Come Into the
Case.
The opening statement In one of the
most sensational civil cases that have
yet occupied attention will be made be
fore Judge Seawell to-day. Allegations
of fraud against Charles Mayne, the de
ceased millionaire capitalist, will form
a part of the proceedings, and another
prominent capitalist still doing busi
ness in San Francisco will probably be
drawn into the litigation to explain how
It was that a former Board of Super
visors was induced to part with $300,000
worth of the stock of the San Francisco
and San Jose Railroad for the paltry
sum of $1000. The suit is that of C. B.
Polhemus against the estate of Charles
Mayne and others.
The history of the case goes back to
mentioned was projected as an iron
highway into San Francisco.
McLaughlin & Houston, the contract
ors for the road, having completed the
work and finding themselves financially
embarrassed by an indebtedness of over
one million dollars sold out their in
terest in the property and contract
to a company consisting of the late
Peter Donahue, the late H. M. Newhall
and C. B. Polhemus, the plaintiff in the
action, for advances in coin and other
obligations to an aggregate of $1,177,
007 15.
With the idea of controlling the entire
stock and all the bonds of the concern
the three partners entered into con
tracts for the city and county of San
Francisco, the county of Santa Clara
and the county of San Mateo for the
A NEW CHILCOOT
SLEIGH.
It was thought that when the over
head trolley system was Inaugurated
the dangers and hardships encountered
in climbing steep Chilkoot were les
sened, but now comes a scheme that
would seem an improvement-
A company has been organized in this
city, with a capital of $200,000, to oper
ate on a stationary cable from Dyea to
Lake Lindeman, which is both novel
and ingenious.
G. S. Fouts is the inventor of
a rotary whip-wheel which has been
successfully operated in logging camps
and in other places, and he has put his
idea into a sleigh which he feels con
fident will solve the problem that has
been the bugbear to prospectors. Su
perintendent Owens has taken his idea
and designed the sleigh, which will be
operated by a specially built gasoline
engine.
The contrivance is such that by
means of the motor power in the sleigh
the wheels are set in motion, and, re
volving, catch up the slack of the cable
and force the vehicle over the snow.
The speed can be regulated from one to
nine miles an hour, and its inventor
claims it will not slip on the steepest

â¢iehteen feet ovfer all. Steel and bronze
purchase of 6000 shares of the stock of
the railroad owned by these corpora
tions. Thus the three capitalists be
came the practical owners of the road.
In order to carry out his Interest in
the concern and pay up the Interest on
his shares of the stock Mr. Polhemus
applied to Charles Mayne for pecuniary
assistance. In consideration that he
should put up the necessary coin an
agreement was entered into between
Mayne and Polhemus by which the lat
ter transferred one-half his interest to
Mayne.
Shortly afterward Polhemus went
East to obtain from the Government in
bonds and lands a subsidy for the com
pany. Before leaving he confided his
interest in the road to his partner
Mayne. On his return, as is claimed by
the plaintiff, the defendant made repre
sentations that the property was losing
money, when, as a matter of fact, it
was paying a large profit, and by such
representations induced him to part
with his interest for a small sum.
This is the large point at issue, for
it has since been discovered that Mayne's
representations to Polhemus were un
true, and that at the time that he
claimed the road was losing money it
was in reality in good financial condi
tion.
Then follows allegations of the ne
gotiations for the purchase by the San
Francisco and San Jose Railroad Com
pany of the Market Street Railroad
Company of its owners, Donahue, New
hall and L. L. Robinson. This pur
chase was made before the plaintiff left
California, and was for $250,000, in
bonds of the Market Street Railroad
Company guaranteed by the San Fran
cisco and San Jose Railroad Company.
After this purchase a new company
was incorporated, entitled the Market
Street Railway Company, with a capi
tal stock of 7500 shares, and 6500 of
these shares were subscribed for by
Donahue, Newhall and Mayne. In
payment they gave their checks for
$36,670 each, which checks were never
used, but were returned in 1870 after
the sale and transfer of the above men
tioned railroad and railway to Stan
ford, Huntlngton, Hopkins and Crock
er.
Prior to Polhemus' departure for the
East the Southern Pacific Railroad ex
isted as a corporation on paper, and
Mayne was one of its promoters and
incorporators, and also one of its large
stockholders. It appears that on Sep
tember 22, 1866, while Polhemus was in
the East, the project of the Southern
Pacific Railroad for purchasing the
San Jose Railroad was already con
ceived and steps were being taken to
accomplish that end. On that day a
map of the Southern Pacific Railroad
route was prepared, on which it was
delineated as commencing in San Fran
cisco and running over the line of the
San Francisco and San Jose Railroad
through Gilroy. Then began negotia
tions between Messrs. Donahue, New
hall and Mayne for and on behalf of
themselves and the Southern Pacific
Railroad, with Messrs. Lloyd Tevis and
H. W. Carpentler, representing Stan
ford, Huntingdon, Hopkins and Crock
er, to sell the San Jose Railroad and
the Market Street Railway for
$3,250,000. On January 29. 1567, Messrs.
Donahue, Newhall and Mayne signed
an agreement segregating their inter
ests in the San Jose Railroad and Mar
ket Street Railway, each taking one
third of the bonds and stock and own
ership.
The sensational feature that Is ex
pected to develop, however, lies in the
disposition of $300,000 of the stock of the
company that was purchased by the
municipality by the exchange of a like
amount of municipal bonds. The
charges will be made that by getting
an act passed through the Legislature
enabling the municipal corporation to
sell these bonds to the best advan
tages, the Board of Supervisors was
manipulated in such a manner that
$1000 was all that the city ever received
out of the transaction. It is charged
also that Mayne refused to render a
statement to Polhemus and that the
latter was defrauded out of more than
$100,000,000 In the operation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1898.
"OLD TIMERS"
ON THE DIAMOND
Weil-Known Players Ap
pear lor the Benefit of
Tom Power.
California Markets Barely Es
cape a Shut-Out After an
Exciting Game.
"McGlnty" Carroll and the Old Fa
vorites Receive an Enthusi
astic Reception.
"Gooda the boy, Rube! Run, you
; Rube! Hold yer base, yer safe, Levy!"
These and many other enthusiastic
expressions floated across the diamond
â  yesterday in the benefit game between
| the "Old Warhorses" and the Califor
i nia Markets.
Cranks, who in the halcyon days of
baseball at the old Haight street
grounds never missed a game, were
I there in force, and the present day lov
ers of the national sport added to the
crowd by turning out In large num
bers.
An ideal day and a chance to do a
good turn for smiling Tom Power, who
so ably held down the initial bag for
the champion Haverleys, attracted
nearly 5000 people to the grounds. Each
man felt in duty bound to join his voice
i in the game, and the noise that was
< generated could be heard blocks away.
As the old favorites went to bat they
were greeted with cheers which must
i have gladdened their hearts and re
; payed them for playing.
Handsome Bill Lange and "Shorty*
Carroll divided the ovations with Rube
i Levy, the bleachers' pride, and "Two
! base" Pete Sweeney. Every move these
| men made, every time they were lucky
enough to reach first, they were greet
ed with boundless enthusiasm.
Yet above the noise there was always
heard one deep voice, coaching the "Old
Timers." It was no one else but Joe
Feehan, the champion rooter of the old
Haight street grounds. His encourag
ing words time and again raised their
drooping spirits, and engendered new
hope into them. To his presence may
be attributed the evenness of the
score.
It was a great game! The California
Markets barely escaped a shut-out.
They played hard and fast, but were
able to roll up but four runs, and It
might be said that this would not have
occurred but for the wildness of John
son's pitching. The latter seems to
have taken on an abundance of flesh,
and this balked him in his movements.
Anyhow, he should have known better.
The old-timers were first to bat, Van
Haltren, Mertes and Lange going out in
order.
Johnson gave Krug a base on balls,
and then advanced him to second on a
wild pitch. Monahan was aJso given a
life. Then Marty Murphy sent a
grounder to Johnson, who threw to
third to catch Krug. but too late. With
three on bases, Hearty singled to the
right field fence, and Krug scored. Fred
Lange was given a base en balls, forc
ing Monahan in. Pyne hit to the pitch
er, who threw Murphy out at the plate.
Reilly flew out to Levy, and after a
short run Rube nailed it. He shot the
ball to Mertes with such force that the
forth. In Spokane he tested his wheel
on one of the steepest bluffs, when two
men using hand power were able to
travel back and forth for nearly a
thousand feet with nearly two tons to
carry- The fact that the sleigh will
have to climb an elevation of 52 degrees
does not make any difference, as he
says it can easily be done while carry-
Ing six tons.
latter dropped it, otherwise they would
have doubled Fred Lange, who re
turned to second. He tried again to
reach third, when Mertes threw to Bill
Lange to catch Pyne off first, and Bill
returned the ball to Mertes in time to
put his namesake out, ending the in
ning.
In the next Inning Pete Sweeney
scored on a two-base hit and Matt
Stanley's single. The Markets in their
half could do nothing owing to the clev
er fielding of the "Old Timers."
When "McGinty" Carroll strode to
the plate to open the third inning he
received a warm reception. After
blushing becomingly, he threw his chest
out and rapped the sphere to Monahan,
and was retired. Van Haltren then
landed for two bases, and was ad
vanced on Mertes' sacrifice. "Graceful"
Bill Lange sent a hot grounder to
"Heney" Krug, and reached first on the
fumble, Van Haltren scoring. Pete
Sweeney ended the Inning by going out
on a short hit to second.
The Markets, with the assistance of
a few more bases on balls from John
son, added their last tally in their half
of the third.
Johnson retired to the bench in the
fifth, giving way to Phil Knell, who
up to that time only had a speaking
part in the game. Matt Stanley
changed positions with Carroll, the lit
tle fellow making no objection, as he
was placed close to the grand stand,
where the eyes of the ladies were cast
en his form. Standing in the shade,
wearing a glove nearly as big as him
self, the popular little player waited
for flies that never came.
In the sixth the "Old Timers" gained
their last run. Peoples was given a
base on balls, reached second on Stan
ley's single and scored on Fred Lange's
high throw of "Shorty" Carroll's bunt.
After the sixth inning neither side I
scored, although men were repeatedly
on bases. The Markets put up a fine
exhibition, but the "Old Timers" were
an improvement. Iberg was given
strong support, and pitched his usual
good game.
As the services of the man in the box
office, the ticket receivers, the umpires
and the players were gratis, Jim Pow- i
er should receive a neat sum to lessen â 
his worry during his sickness.

THE JURORS
ARE AFTER
THE SCHOOLS
Thick Coat of War-
Paint Donned for
Directors.
All the Newly Appointed
Teachers May Be Sum
moned to Testify.
Bribery Charges Doubtless tc
Be Sifted by a Drastic
Method.
WILLFUL WASTEOF FUNDS
Failure to Advertise School Work
Will Be Carefully Investigated
at Once.
If any School Directors have been
guilty of accepting bribes for obtain
ing positions in the department for
teachers, as is alleged, it is now pretty
sure that the next step contemplated
by the Grand Jury will bring the fact
to light. It was stated yesterday by
one who is pretty close to several mem
bers of the jury that this step contem
plated is nothing more nor less than
summoning all the teachers who have
secured positions by the favor of the
present board before It, and asking:
them a set of questions as to whether
they have paid for their own positions
or know anybody else who has done so.
This method will take some time, but
it is believed by most of the Grand
Jurymen to be the only way in which
the true status of affairs can be got
at, as It is thought only reasonable
that In so large a number not a few
can be found too conscientious to per
jure themselves. In case the Grand
Jury can secure direct evidence against
any one he will be promptly indicted.
Another thing that will come in for
full investigation will be the immense
amount of money expended by the
School Board in repairs, it being a mat
ter not disputed that the law has been
flagrantly violated in the matter of ad
vertising for bids. The law requires
that in cases of repairs costing more
than $200 the work shall be advertised.
This has been evaded by letting a fa
vorite do a certain part of the work
for so much money, not exceeding the
legal limit, and then another part for
another sum â in reality a sort of sub
division of the necessary work. By this
method cases are known where the
same sewer has been built in two sec
tions.
It is now said that the Lincoln School
lease will not come up until later on
account of the difficulty of securing
evidence. The Grand Jurors realize
that there is too much hard work be
fore them to spend any of their time
in probing into an affair in which no
evidence wan-anting an indictment can
be found. They are going to strike
hardest at what they deem the most
vulnerable parts of the School Board's
armor.
DEATH OF MISS GOTTLOB.
She Wa? Beloved by All in the The-
atrical Profession.
One of the saddest things that has hap
pened In the theatrical profession ww
the death yesterday afternoon of Miss
Annie Goftlob, the only sister of J. J.
and Joseph Gottlob.
Up to last Wednesday Mlas Gottlob
was in very good health, but on the day
aforementioned she complained of feel
ing ill, and a doctor was immediately
called in, and after examining her found
that she had appendicitis and an opera
tion would be necessary immediately, and
on Thursday it was performed. She
seemed to be improving until yesterday
noon, when her brothers were sent for
and they were informed that ?h* was
unconscious, and a few hours after they
got home to 823 A Bush street, she had
passed away.
Miss Gottlob was short and heavily built
and the cause of her death was Heart
failure, though she had the best medi
cal attendance, six doctors being In con
stant attendance.
She was a woman loved by all* she
was welcome everywhere and always
kindly remembered; she never let slip
an opportunity to say a kind word to
those that needed it and was one of the
greatest encouragers of young actresses
Her one aim in life was to make a home
for her brothers and to make life pleas
ant for them.

Rabbi Myers lectured at the Bush-street

Business cares, he said, should be laid
aside, as it Is an everlasting memorial of
the unity of the Jewish people.
