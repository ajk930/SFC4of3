issued the following proclamation:
"Spaniards: Between Spain and \

ment has arrived to prove to the
world that we possess the spirit to

misfortune to abuse our hospitality,

count unworthy and disreputable.
The North American people, consti

exhausted our patience ana provoked
war by their perfidious machinations,
their acts of treachery, their out

and international conventions. The

The god of victories will give us one

righteousness and justice of our
cause demand. Spain, which counts
upon the sympathies of all nations,
will emerge triumphant from this

NEW YORK, PURITAN
AND THE CINCINNATI
SILENCE THE BATTERIES
KEY WEST, Fla., April 27. â Admiral Sampson this afternoon bom
barded, silenced and pretty well destroyed the Spanish batteries in position
and in course of construction at the entrance of the harbor of Matanzas.
He did it with the flagship New York, the monitor Puritan and the cruiser
Cincinnati. Not one of the American ships was struck, the Spanish gun
nery being wild.
I have no means of knowing the number of dead and wounded on
the Spanish side. It must be considerable.
While the New York, Puritan and Cincinnati were reconnoitering in
force for the purpose of locating and destroying the formidable defenses being
constructed, the flagship was fired on by the batteries on Point Rubal Cava
and Point Maya, guarding the entrance to the harbor.
The New York replied with her forward eight-inch gun on the
port side, steamed boldly in between the batteries and was soon blazing
gage. It was given and she soon began firing her guns at the fort on the
west side of the bay.
The batteries fired explosive shells and most of them fell wide of
the mark. One burst just beyond the stern of the New York and a shrapnel
shot exploded above her.
It took the three ships just eighteen minutes to reduce
the batteries*
After waiting for the Spanish to renew the engagement the ships
withdrew, leaving both batteries in ruins.

N. Smith, via Key West, April
27. â When Admiral Sampson,
on the flagship New York,
left this cruising ground to
day to pay a visit to Matan-
zas and Cardenas he had
made up his mind that some
thing had to be done with
the very aggressive Spanish
artillerymen who were man
ning batteries out that way.
They had fired twice on the
torpedo-boat Foote and were
very busy erecting fortifica
tions and placing guns in po
sition. At Matanzas the New
York found the monitor Puri

Admiral Sampson
decided to make a re
connoissance in force
for the three=fold pur
pose of locating the
batteries, discovering
the kind of guns they
mounted, and, if pos
sible, stopping the
work of fortifying.
Matanzas lies at the head
of a bay, about four miles
from the sea. This bay at its
mouth is three miles wide.
On the west side of the bay
is Point Rubal Cava and on
the east side Point Maya.
These points have very slight
elevation above the sea, but
the configuration of the har

The Cincinnati,

Stretching back from these

ON BOARD HERALD-CALL DISPA !H BOAT ALBERT F.
DEWBT, WITH BLOCKAIgNG SQUADRON OFF NORTH COAST
OF CUBA (via Key West), April 27.-*- Since the capture of the Pana
ma nothing of startling importance has happened off the Cuban
coast. The net is being drawn tighter about the beleaguered island,
and it would now. require a genius indeed to thread his way through
the blockading lines with my sort of craft and make port between
Pinar del liio and Santiago de Cuba. Several fishing smacks were
picked up yesterday and last night, but in every case were released
with the admonition that recapture would mean forfeiture of all
rights. Several coastwise trading schooners have been captured and
released in order that they may carry instructions against any
further .att --npts at business of that nature.
The two Spanish army officers whose capture was reported to
the Herald and Call yesterday were taken aboard the flagship and
then released and permitted to return to .Havana unier a flag of
truce, carried in a small boat. I attempted to learn more of this inci
dent, but found that Admiral Sampson had given instructions that
it should not bj discussed. From him, however, I learned that the
Spanish officers carried a communication to General Blanco fix.n the
admiral. I was yesterday permitted to glance at a letter that has
been smuggled from Havana to a gentleman aboard one of the ships
patrolling the coast. In it the writer said the Spanish an . officers
and men were sev in their determination to fight to the bitter end.
N<me oi taetn expressed any doubt of what the end must inevitably
be. They will be content, it was said, if the Yankees secure a vic
tory dearly bought. They talk of Cuba as surely -ost to fc.jain, and
ure planning for their return to take up an ccupation more profit
able than has been soldiering in Cuba. Although this lette* as writ
ten Bey ral days prey ous to the time of the departure from Havana
of John . oiffo, whom I interviewed aboard the English steamer Lu
clll:.e, .the writer told the same story of suffering and distress among
torer classes. He said that the first effect of the blockade, which
had just been commenced, was to cut off all charity. Those who had
been feeding reconcentrados and poor people generally foresaw the
near approach of that time when hunger would menace them and
were husbanding every resource.
He wrote, too, of the practical cessation of business. Only the
provision stores made a pretense at doing business and by orders from
the palace they were selling in small amounts !y. Foraging par
ties were sent out Friday morning, and large herds of cattle which
*â¢â¢ leen kept in Pinar del Rio, Havana and Matanzas provinces were
ordered driven in tovard Havana, where they will no- be kept
closely -"ur-rded by soldiers when allowed to graze. All information
concerning the insurgents had been shut off. Havana papers were
being censored more carefully than ever.
'' was imn< ;sible to know what was going on in the eu. tern pro
vinces. Morro Cast' continues testing its guns, and last nisrht the
batteries on each side of the harbor awoke the echoes all around the
g.ilf by firing testing charges. However, the oj aniards of Havana
have not shown tfieir teeth, the only shots fired from Morro or neigh
boring batteries have been blank, or at most the practice has been
of a sub-caliber nature. This is stated on the authority of an officer
aboard a ship that for five days has hugged the Havana shores.
from ship to ship would have
made an almost perfect tri
angle.
Just astern of the
Cincinnati was the
Herald=Call dispatch
boat Sommers N.
Smith, under com
mand of Commodore
William Bazzell and
Captain Frank Dunn,
the only newspaper
boat in the gulf to be
within twenty Miles of
the engagement.
From the deck of the Her
ald-Call boat not a human
being could be seen on any
of the ships. The crews
were a!l at quarters ready for
the fun to begin.
Nor could any living object
be descried on shore. The
bay and shore .of Matanzai
were like the land and waters
of No Man's Land.
At a few minutes of
1 o'clock there was a
puff of smoke from
the east shore and an
8-inch shell whizzed
toward the New York
and fell short.
Scarcely had the report
died away than another puff
of smoke floated from the
point on the Maya side and
easily blew away. This shell
also fell short.
The range to the
east battery was
nearly 7000 yards,
but the flagship
promptly opened fire
with one of her 8-inch
guns and in a few min
utes the engagement
was general andshore
and bay were cov=
ered with wind=blown
smoke, while the hol
lows between hills
roared with the can
nonading.
Continuing to cut loose
with her guns, starboard and
port as well as fore and aft.
the New York steamed quick- 1
ly in and circled around to
the westward toward Point
Rubal Cava, while the Puri- i
tan swung to starboard to en
gage the Maya batteries.
Those Maya batteries were
more formidable, and the fire
from them was more fre
quent, but the shells fell
short.
The New York ignored
these batteries after a min
ute, and proceeded to pay all
her attention to the battery
on Rubal Cava, which was
being pushed to completion.
It was a beautiful sight to
see the target practice of the
New York. A big balloon of
smoke would suddenly rise
from her side. The eye, fol
lowing the direction of the
shot, would see an instant
later a great cloud of dust
and fragments of concrete
and mortar fly high in the
air. Then would come the
roar of the piece, sullen and
heavy.
The New York had soon
reduced the range from 7000
to 3000 yards and was toss
ing shells into Rubal Cava at
the rate of about three a min
ute, wi.h wonderful pre
cision and apparently great
destruction.
In the meantime the Puri
tan was taking care of Point
Maya. It was a long shot to
that battery. It was so well
masked that the only target
was the infrequent smoke
from the battery. But when
the Puritan got the range her
shells burst every time with
in the fortification, and great
was the explosion thereof.
High up in the air
would go the cloud of
a Spanish fort in
atoms, looking for all
the world like the ex
plosion of a magazine
of brown prismatic
powder.
Viewed from the deck of
the Sommers N. Smith the
Puritan was doing fully as
much harm on the east side
of the bay as the New York
THE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. AFRTL 28, 1398.
was doing on the west side.
All this time the Cincin
nati had remained out of .the
action. One can readily im
agine the distress and impa
tience of Captain Chester and
his enthusiastic crew at not
being allowed to take a hand
in this first engagement of
the war with the Spanish.
Presently Captain
Chester signaled for
permission to engage
and it was granted by
the flagship.
The Cincinnati, in leSs
time than it takes to write
it, steamed up to within 2000
yards, broadside on, and be
gan to let fly with her guns
at the batteries. The New
York was just giving the sig
nal to retire when one defi
ant shot was fired from Rubal
Cava.
It was the last shotj
that battery was ever
to fire. One of the big
guns on the Puritan
fired back, Itwasthe
best shot of the day.
It struck the battery 1
Just where the gun|
was, tore its way into
the earthworks and
exploded, doing great
destruction.
Captain R. J. Machugh, an
artillery officer of the British
Army who was a spectator of
the engagement from the Her
ald-Call boat, said it was one
of the best shots he had ever
seen made.
Having practically demol
ished the Spanish batteries,
the ships stood out to sea.
Not a shell had
struck one of them,
but there had been
three narrow misses
on the New York.
The Spanish fired a shrap
neil once which had burst
over the ship, a shell had
struck just fore of her and
another struck just aft.
The fact that the Spaniards
failed to strike such a large
target as the New York, tow
ering, as she does, like a
house out of the water, was
evidence that they are not
good marksmen.
On the other hand,
every shot that the
New York fired after
she got the range was
pitched right into the
batteries.
It began at 12:^7 and ended
at 1:15.
In point of time the engage
ment lasted just 18 minutes.
The Herald-Call dispatch
boat rounded the fleet after
the engagement, and not a
single casualty was reported.
The Puritan and Cincinnati
were left on guard at Matan
zas, and the New York re
turned to her old position.
All told the United States
ships fired 86 shots at the
forts. This is by actual count
from the Sommer N. Smith.
The forts fired probably 2$
shots.
The bombardment devel
oped that the largest pieces
mounted by the Spanish at
Matanzas are 8-inch guns,and
the best opinion is that there
is not more than five or six
guns there.
But far more important than
the destruction of Matanzas
batteries is the conclusion
about the future which may
be drawn from the bombard-
â ment.
This conclusion is
that Havana is abso=
lutely at the mercy of
the United States fleet
whenever we choose
to open fire.
Sampson to-day, with guns
which amount to less than
one-tenth of his fighting force,
silenced the batteries in 18
minutes. He steamed right

FAST CRUISERS
TO SEARCH FOR
SPANISH SHIPS
Five of UQcle Sam's Vessels to Be
Sent After the Enemy's Men
of-War and Merchantmen.
NEW YORK, April 27.â A "Washington special to the Herald says:
Five fast scouts will soon be traversing the Atlantic on the lookout for
Spanish men-of-war and Spanish merchantmen. Two of these, the
Minneapolis and Columbia, are now at sea on this duty, and they will
be followed in* the course of a day or so by the St. Louis and Harvard.
I learned to-day that the hasty conversion of the St. Louis and New
York into auxiliary cruisers was the result of a recommendation n--.de
to the Navy Department by the War Board.
In view of the desire of the board to have ships available for imme
diate service it was determined to equip ' each with only four 6
pounders. Not only were' the batteries reduced to a minimum, but to
save time instructions were sent to Captain C. F. Goodrich, command
ing the St. Louis, and Captain C. S. Cotton, commanding the Harvard,
to employ their men at sea, if necessary, in mounting the guns. It
is expected that orders will be given, to these vessels now at Tomp
kinsville to proceed to sea in search for Spanish men-of-war as .soon
as the department learns that the latter have left their present an
chorage. The St. Paul will be ready in a few days.
Ketir-Admiral J. G. Walker, retired, has applied to the Navy De
partment for an active command afloat. At this time there is no va
cancy for him, and Secretary Long announced to-day that he had no
intention of appointing a commander-in-chief of the several squad
rons stationed along the Atlantic coast. I understand that the depart
ment has practically determined not to assign to sea duty, for the
present at least, any retired flag officers.
Much to the relief of naval officials a telegram was received to
day by. Captain Charles O'Neil, chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, from
the California Powder Works, announcing that the Government's in
terests had not been affected by the explosion of the powder mill
which took place yesterday at Santa Cruz, Cal. The mill which ex
ploded was used for the manufacture of black powder.
The hospital ship Solace will leave Norfolk on Monday to join Ad
miral- Sampson's fleet now off Havana. ' Few cases of sickness among
the men on board the ships in the fleet have been reported up to the
present.
in on them, as close as he
could get, and not one of our
ships was touched. What is
to be said of a gunner that
cannot hit a mark as big as
the New York 2000 or 3000
yards ay/ay ?
The incident has great
ly encouraged the naval
officers, and they believe
that when they bombard
Havana they will destroy
all the defenses in about
one hour.
WORKS AND
MEN GO UP
ON BOARD flagship New York, off
Matanzas, April 27, from Herald-Call
correspondent (via Key West). â The
bombardment of Matanzas, the first
important hostile act of war, began
half an hour ago, at 5 minutes past 1
o'clock in the afternoon. The first shot
was fired from the New York's eight
inch gun amidships* on the port side.
It is under Cadet Boone. The harbor
of Matanzas is protected from sea by
a long low strip of land covered with
managua.
On this point a battery has been
placed, and for the. last few days the
officers of the Puritan and Cincinnati
have observed me* working on the
ramparts and placing guns in posi
tion. This fact was reported to the
admiral, and the bombardment of to
day was to clear the point of this fort.
When the call came to general quarters
the flagship was 4000 yards off shore.
The Puritan was about 1000 yards
further out on the New York's port
side and the Cincinnati lay still an
other thousand yards out, moving
slowly to the starboard of the ship.
Admiral Sampson and Captain Chad
wick were on the forward bridge
throughout the bombardment. The
bullseye at which the first gun was
trained was a long rampart of yellow
earth about 200 yards long. With a
glass it was quite possible to see
groups of men moving about upon it.
The first shot fell about a hundred
yards to the right of this bank, and
the managua bushes were thrown up
into the air in a cloud of yellow sand.
The second shot came from one of the
8-inch guns in the forward turret,
which is under command of Lieutenant
Frank Marble. It fell at the extreme
edge of the point 200 yards to the left
of the fort, but its sister gun followed
it like a reverberation of the first and
struck the fort fair in the center with
a projectile twenty-five inches long,
weighing 250 pounds.
The earthworks rose in the air like a
geyser of muddy water and the work of
many men for three days was demol
ished as completely and as suddenly
as though an earthquake had swal
lowed it up. How many of those men
were demolished with the earthworks
or what guns were dismantled it was
impossible to see. Simultaneously with
this third shot a battery in a fort on
the further side of the harbor opened
on the warships, and guns from all
parts of the ship returned the fire. It
was impossible to keep count of them.
The smoke as it drifted back over the
ship's superstructure and between
decks made it almost difficult to tell
which of the shots had reached the
shore.
Not more than five or six shots from
the forts came near the flagship. One
shot fell about a hundred yards to the
stern, another fell short by a hundred
yards and a shrapnel shell broke almost
overhead. There were no casualties
among the seamen. Of course the fact
that the ship was prepared for this and
stripped for action, and that every un
necessary piece of iron work and wood
work had been removed accounted for
the little damage done by the concus
sion of her great guns.
This was the first one of our greatest
warships which has gone into action,
and it was Interesting to note the per
fectness of discipline that obtained.
Officers gave their orders in voices
hardly raised above that of every day.
The men laughed when the shots struck
home, but there was no cheering nor
greater show of excitement than at
practice. At the same time the deck of
the superstructure heaved, and where
your correspondent stood on the for
ward bridge back of the turret the con
cussion of her guns made the ear drums
tingle, and the smoke filled the mouth
and nostrils of the officers and dimmed
their eyes so that it was for a second
at a time impossible to see or speak.
KEY WEST, Fla., April 27.â The re
sult of the engagement created the
greatest enthusiasm among officers and
men, and increasedâ if that is possible â
the desire to take a crack at Morro
Castle. Within ten minutes after the
engagement had ended the special dis
patch boat was alongside the New York
and congratulations were extended to
Admiral Sampson, who returned his
compliments. He requested the Smith
to carry the official dispatches report
ing the battle to Key West. So it
was the Herald and Call that brought
the news to President McKinley, as
well as to millions of readers.
Spanish Craft Sails Suddenly.

ent of the Daily Telegraph at Gibraltar

Bay of Gibraltar). The Spanish tor

LONDON, April 28.â The Hong
kong correspondent of the Daily
Mail says:
"United States Consul - General
Williams, after spending the even
ing ashore with Consul Wildman,
accompanied the American squad
ron. Thirty insurgent leaders here
wanted to accompany it, but Chief
Aguinaldo went as their representa
tive. He will take charge of the in
surgents at Manila. Admiral Dewey
has issued strict orders that no bar
barous or inhuman acts are to ba
perpetrated by the insurgents. The
primary object is the capture of the
Spanish fleet, which Admiral Dewey
thinks more important than captur
ing Manila. He is determined to
prevent its preying upon American
vessels. On reaching Manila he will
demand its capitulation within half
an hour of his arrival.
"His men are in the best spirits
and excellent health. There have
been nine desertions, including six
Chinaman, one Italian and one Ger
man,' during the fleet's stay at Hong
kong. Every preparation has been
taken. The ships are cleared
painted for battle, and the general
opinion is that the fight in these
waters will resuit in an easy victory
for the Americans. Her ships carry
122 guns as against ninety-six of the
Spanish fleet.
"The co-operation of the American
fleet with the rebels has been kept a
strict secret. The latter await the ar
rival of the fleet, wlien Manila must
soon succumb. Its defenses are in a
wretched state.
"The Americans in the Philippines
are anxious to see British rule estab
lished there and the report has been
favorably received. The Manila press,
on the contrary, says there is great
enthusiasm among the population fcr
Spain, and that an obstinate resist
ance will be offered to the Americans.
But the papers qualify their bold al
legation by referring to the phleg
matic character of the natives, which
prevents any excited expression of
opinion.
"These journals say, too, that tre
treason of a few hundred or a few
thousand rebels does not affect the
virtue of the race, and they haughtily
add that the Philippines -will prove
worthy of Spain.
HAYTI HAS SHOWN
HER FRIENDSHIP.
NEW YORK. April 27.â A Washing

States by agreeing to pay, at a time
when she could have avoided doing so,
the claim of Bernard Campbell, an
American, who was maltreated at Cape
Haytien in 1889 for his refusal to enter
the Haytian navy. Under the agree

State Penfield, representing the United
States, and Minister St. Leerer, repre

Mr. Campbell on June 1, $5000, and on
June 1, 1899, $5000 with interest for one
year at 5 per cent. Hayti has not yet
issued a neutrality proclamation, but
this is daily expected, as is also one
from San Domingo.

ron in this port received important cipher dis
patches from Madrid to-day. While even the
officers of the squadron have been kept in ig
norance of the contents of these dispatches the
general belief is that they contained the long
looked for sailing orders.
It is expected that the fleet will move out to
sea during the night, or at least in the morn
ing. AH signs indicate that the flagship will
give the signal foi* starting within a very
short time.
Immediately after receipt of the dispatches
from Madrid the few officers who had been
successful in obtaining shore leave were has
tily called to their ships. On the cruisers and
torpedo vessels there is unusual bustle and
excitement.
NEW YORK, April 27.â A Washington spe
cial to the Herald says: It is announced semi
officially to-night that if Portugal does not de
clare her neutrality speedily she will receive a
diplomatic reminder.
XFW YORK, April 27.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: At last the mystery of the
whereabouts of the Spanish battle-ship
Pelayo and the armored cruiser Carlos
V has been solved. While the Pelayo is
peacefully plowing her way toward
Cadiz the Carlos V is cruising alone the
European coast hunting for American
prizes to offset those picked up by the
North Atlantic squadron.
Official information to this effect has
been received in Washington, and as a
result an easier feeling prevails in ad
ministration and naval circles. Further
than this, the officials have learned, I
understand, that the Spanish fleet at St.
Vincent will sail to-morrow. This
movement will undoubtedly be the re
sult of the neutrality proclamation
uhich Portugal is expected to issue
within the next twenty-four hours. So
skeptical have the officiah become of
what r-.eem to be reliable reports that
they will not believe the fleet has gone
until an official cablegram announcing
its departure has been received from
the American Consul at that point. As
the Herald stated, the officials will be
glad and sorry at the departure of the
Spanish fleet from its present anchor
age â glad because it will minimize the
possibility of capture or destruction of
the American battle-ship Oregon and
gunboat Marietta, and sorry because the
departure of the Spanish fleet from St.
Vincent means that it will disappear
from telegraphic communication and
that information concerning its where
abouts must come from merchantmen
and scouts. Two of these scouts, the
Minneapolis and Columbia, are now at
sea, and three â the St. Louis, St. Paul
and New York â will be ordered to sea
within a few days. It is expected that
the commerce destroyers will remain
at sea for some days, and. as the Herald
has stated, their instructions are to as
certain the whereabouts of Spanish men
of-war and privateers and to seize any
Spanish merchantmen which they may
meet.
Considerable satisfaction is felt by
naval officials over the fact that the
Spanish fleet is still divided. Infor
mation that the Pelayo, instead of pro
ceeding to the Cape Verde Islands on
April 17, as was reported, went to Car
thagena, where she received her final re
pairs. She is now returning to Cadiz,
where the second torpedo flotilla, con
sisting of eight torpedo boat deatrov
crs and torpedo boats, the iron battle
ship Victoria and three auxiliary
cruisers, besides several small gunboats.
is anchored.
It is not known what disposition will
be made of this fleet, but it is supposed
that some of the smaller vessels will be
retained on the coast, while the torpedo
destroyers and torpedo boats will
re-enforce the force now at St. Vincent.
Suc)i re-enforcement will probably be
effected at the Canary Islands. 700 miles
from Cadiz and 876 miles from St. Vin
cent, and the necessity of combining the
two fleets make the officials believe that
when the force at Cape Verde Islands
sails it will proceed to Teneriffe. It is
possible the torpedo boats may be or
dered back to that point, while the ar
mored cruisers will be sent to intercept
the Oregon.
It was learned by the Navy Depart
ment to-day that the battle-ship Oregon
and gunboat Marietta arrived at Punta
Arenas on April 17. The report of their
arrival came from the American Min
ister at Montevideo, who reported that
the steamer arriving there from Sandy
Point stated that she had left the Amer
ican men-of-war coaling.
The orders to Captain Clarke Com
mander Symonds, of these two vessels,
directed them to take on sufficient coal
to reach the West Indies, but the au
thorities have learned that their coal
supply is short, and it is expected they
will put into Rio Janeiro within the
next few days. At least two days will
elapse, the officials expect, before the
Oregon reaches Rio Janiero, and she
will remain there three days taking
coal on board. Three days more will
be required for her to make the distance
to San Rogue, where it is expected the
Spanish men-of-war will lie in wait for
her, provided that be their plan. They
will exhaust considerable coal in cruis
ing around awaiting the coming of the
American ships, and besides lav them
selves open to a dash from the Amer
ican fleet. Within the next week the
authorities will probably have formed
a fleet of armor-clads, upon which the
main reliance of the country must be
placed, and should it be ascertained that
the Spanish armored cruisers are seek
ing the Oregon a surprise may be in
store for the Madrid Government which
will undoubtedly seriously cripple its
navy.
THE TEMERARIO OFF

Troublesome Spanish Torpedo Gun
Vessel has Left Argentina
Waters.
Copyrighted. IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
BUENOS AYRES, April 27.â The
Spanish torpedo gun vessel Temerario
has left Argentina waters, and has
gone to Montevideo. I have been un
able to ascertain whither she will sail
from there. Twenty officers of the
army in Montevideo have requested
that they be dismissed from the ser
vice. They wish to offer their ser
vices to Spain and they do not desire
to do anything that might be looked
upon as compromising the neutrality of
their country.
The Herald's correspondent In Rio
Janeiro informs me that a great many
of the sailors of the Nichtheroy, recent
ly purchased by the United States from
Hrazll, have left the ship because of
the dissatisfaction with the comman
der. Another crew, however, has been
procured to take the places of those
who left.
The Herald's correspondent in Rio
Janeiro also informs me that the Bra
zilian Minister of Foreign Affairs has
requested the Minister of the Navy to
order the Nichtheroy to leave Brazilian
waters.

VANCOUVER, April 27.â The mail
brought by the Empress of China,
which arrived here this morning from
Hongkong and Yokohama, states that
the people of the Orient are turning
their attention from the far eastern
question to the war between the United
States and Spain. Generally speaking
the press is on the side of America.
The Japan Daily Herald declares the
Spanish pride and obstinacy conspired
to throw away all chance of peace.
It was reported in Hongkong on April
11 that the American Government had
purchased two steamers, the Zephyr
and Nanhan as transports.
The news from the Philippines is less
than ever reassuring for Spain. De
spite an official statement from Madrid
that the rebellion has been got under
control the outbreak does not seem to
have been subdued. General Primo de
Rivers is so disgusted with the Govern
ment not carrying out his recommen
dations for reforms that he has insisted
upon being relieved.
Spain seems to be resorting to foul
tactics to kill the rebellion. At the end
of March 150 rebels were holding a
meeting in a house in Manila. The
news got to the authorities and the
house was surrounded with the result
that upon their refusal to surrender
about ten so-called Insurgents were
killed, some forty wounded and the re
mainder taken prisoners. They did
not linger long in confinement, being
released by death.
This massacre aroused intense indig
nation. The Japanese officials declare
that it becomes more evident than ever
as events progress and develop that
neither the present Government nor
the Philippine rebels can ever govern
the island as they ought to be governed,
with a view to the reasonable develop
ment of this paradise of the earth.

Determination to Co=operate
With Insurgents in an Ad=

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK, GA., April 27.â Late to
night it was learned, on what is considered good authority, that or
ders had been received from' Washington for the immediate shipment
to Tampa, Fla., of two of the light batteries of artillery now sta
tioned at Chickamauga Park. Cars enough to accommodate the
twelve guns of the batteries, eighty horses and 140 men, will, it is said,
be switched to the park early in the morning. The batteries will be
loaded on the cars at once and run through to Tampa on passenger
train time. Taken In connection with the conference held in Washing
ton to-day between General Miles and Senor Queseda, Brigadier-Gen
eral Nunez and Lieutenant Artiago, representatives of the Cuban
insurgents, at which it was reported plans were completed for the
immediate arming of the Cuban army, it is taken to indicate a de
termination on the part of the United States army authorities to
co-operate with the insurgents in an immediate advance on Havana.
Whether other batteries have been ordered shipped is not known, nor
can anything be learned at this hour as to whether any of the in
fantry now stationed here has been ordered South. The report
caused considerable excitement.

proper committees of Congress and
that there would be no delay, Stewart
agreed that the resolution should go to

SPAIN IS GAINING
ENGLISH SYMPATHY.
Trend of British Sentiment Toward
the Dons Is Becoming Very
Pronounced.
LONDON, April 28.â The trend of
English sentiment toward Spain is be
coming so pronounced as to be gen
erally recognized. All resident Amer
icans, even among diplomats, are com
pelled to admit it. Although the Gov
ernment's friendly attitude is un
changed, it is questioned whether a
majority in Parliament now is Spanish
in its sympathy, although practically
unanimous partisans of the United
States. A straw indicating the direc
tion of the wind is shown at a popu
lar music hall in London, where night
ly pictures of the American and Span
ish warships are shown by the kine
toscope. The American ships are oniy
moderately applauded, the Spanish
most enthusiastically.
The expected fight off Manila is
awaited in England with the greatest
interest, first, because it may have con
siderable political significance, and.
second, because it is the first instaace
of a modern squadron fighting so far
from a well equipped base.
The effects of the war continue to be
felt in Europe, in the rise of prices of
various commodities.

as a base of operations. The fleet was
then directed toward the Philippines
with a view to immediately engaging
the Spanish squadron and after dis
abling it to invest Manila.
Latest advices indicate tl.at the Span
ish squadron is cruising in close prox
imity to Manila, and the department
therefore feels confident that the two
fleets will come together within a
few hours and a decisive engagement
follow.
While news of operations in the Ori
ent is awaited with the utmost anxiety
there is an almost equal tension in the
minds of naval officials regarding the
movements of the Spanish fleets at Ca
diz and the Cape Verde Islands. The
only information the department has
regarding either of these fleets is in the
form of a brief commercial cablegram
received this morning to the effect that
the Cape Verde squadron would leave
St. Vincent to-morrow for tne west. It
was also reported to the department,
though upon what authority cannot be
learned to-night, that the vessels of the
Cape Verde force would be divided and
all but two of them dispatched to join
the Spanish warships in Cuban waters,
while a cruiser and torpedo-boat de
stroyer were sent to ' he coast of Brazil
to intercept the battleship Oregon. It
is calculated that the Oregon in coming
north will follow the usual steamer
track, passing almost within sight of
Cape St. i-toque, near which the most
experienced navigators in the depart
ment assume the Spanish vessels might
most reasonably expect to head off the
American warship. The department
has no fears regarding the safety of
the Oregon in spite of the menace of the
two Spanish ships. In fighting quali
ties she is more than a match for both
vessels and it is believed that neither
by day nor by night could the torpedo
boats evade the vigilance of her officers
and get close enough to do her any in
jury. On the contrary the Oregon's big
guns are counted upon to sink her com
paratively frail adversaries in the event
that an attempt should be made to car
ry out the programme suggested.
More serious attention is being given
by the department to the possibility of
reinforcement of the Spanish fleet now
in Cuban waters by the Cape Verde
or Cadiz squadron with a view of re
lieving General Blanco and his forces
in Havana. The denant tone of Blanco's
latest utterances, cabled from Havana
last night, are construed by the depart
ment to mean he has assurances that a
powerful Spanish fleet will soon be sent
to his aid. Should an attempt be made
by the Spaniards to force Admiral
Sampson's blockade a terrific battle
would ensue which mlr : prove the
turning point in the war. With such a
possibility in view the administration
hesitates to dispatch a land force to
Cuba where, in the always possible
event of the defeat of the American
fleet, the troops on the island would
find themselves cut off and forced to
meet the Spanish army ur -r most un
favorable conditions. With these con
siderations in view i* is probable that
no important action will be taken within
the next few days, the purpose of the
department being to maintain Admiral
Sampson's fleet in the most serviceable
condition until the enemy's plans are
more clearly defined. Instructions have
been sent to the blockading squadron
to redouble the vigilance exercised to
prevent ships from reaching Havana,
for while the reports concerning the
running of the blockade by the troop
ship Montserrat lack official confirma
tion, navy officials are inclined to ac
cept the statement as true.

KEY WI'.ST, April 27.â The only war
like incident that has rippled the cus

the arrival this morning of the little
Cuban coast steamer Ambroslo Bolivar,
In charge of a small prize crew from
the monitor Terror. The boat itself is

CADIZ, April 27. â The Spanish have sent a fleet to the Mediter
ranean to prey upon the many yachts owned by the citizens of the
United Stares which are there. Her new torpedo-boat destroyer, the
Destructor, accompanied by the torpedo-boats Barcelona, Nabu and
Ritamosa, sailed to-day from this port. They took an eastern course
for Tar/fa, Ceuta. Their object, lam told, is to retaliate on the
United States for capturing Spanish ships by taking all the American
yachts in the Mediterranean.
The warships in the harbor to-day include the iron broadside
ship Victoria and the torpedo-boat destroyers Proserpine and Osada.
The Columbia and Normannia, which were recently bought from
the Hamburg-American Steamship Company, are being stiffened to
receive artillery. English engineers have been engaged at large
salaries to get the highest possible speed out of them. The Gibraltar

was the Detroit's prize.
The silver specie the little coaster
had was destined for the payment of
some of Spain's long-suffering soldiers
and unpaid troops. The fact that the
Bolivar is a Spanish vessel and hail not
loaded in any American port makes her
a legitimate prize of war, even in the
light of the President's proclamation,
the purport of which is made public in
local papers here to-day.
The proclamation exempting from
capture vessels sailing from foreign
ports prior to April 111 and those sail
; ing from domestic ports prior to May
21 is variously interpreted here. The
consensus of opinion, however, Is that
it means that we must return to their
owners most, if not all of the steam
ships taken by our ntavy as prizes of
war since the fleet sailed from here last
Friday, beginning with the Buena Ven
tura and ending with the Panama, so
gallantly taken by the game little
Mangrove. Naval officers express the
hope, however, that in the case of the
Panama, at least, the fact that she was
loaded with provisions for Havana and
was actually an armed vessel carrying
two fourteen-pounders, will place her
legally in the category of contraband
of war.

the matter of placing our bonds in the
European markets. It was admitted
by Mr. Gage that some of the financiers
thought the rate of interest on the new

with a :> p*r cent bond. Conditions
were favorable in Mr. Gage's opinion
for a $200,000,000 issue and there was

WASHINGTON, April 27.â There w^as
some discussion to-day in the Senate
Committee on Postoffices and Postroads
of the bill introduced by Senator
Chandler to provide for a popular loan
through postal savings banks, and the
suggestion was made that it might fur
nish a more acceptable means of rais
ing funds for the war than the bond
clause of the House revenue bill.
The measure provides for the issu
ance of postal savings notes of $50 and
$100, payable to bearer and bearing 3
per cent interest. A sub-committee
was appointed for the consideration of
the details of the bill. It was notice
able that all the members of the Post

parties, expressed a desire to avoid a
bond issue if possible.
The postal savings bill was also un

Serious Bread Riots.
ROME, April 27.â Several bread riots
took place to-day at Bari, capital of the
province of that name. A mob of 2000 at

devastated the public gardens and then
proceeded to make an assault upon the
Town Hall and prison. The latter attempt
was frustrated by the prison guards and
oolica.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 1898.
NEUTRALITY
IS OBSERVED
Proclamations Are Being
Issued by European
Powers.
So Far Germany and Austria
Are the Only Nations to
Hold Out.
Colombia the First of the Latin
Republics to Declare It Will
Extend No Favors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, April 27.
The State Department posted a notice
to-day stating it had been officially ad
vised of the Issuance of neutrality or
ders by Italy, the Netherlands, Switz
erland, Norway and Sweden, Russia
and Colombia, It is supposed also that
official notice of Great Britain's and
France's neutrality will be received by
to-morrow.
Including France and Great Britain,
four of the six great powers of Europe
have declared their neutrality, namely:
Great Britain, Italy, France and Rus
sia." There remain of the great powers
Germany and Austria, neither of which
has yet acted. The delay of Austria
does not cause surprise, as Austria's
sympathy with Spain is more pro
nounced than that of any other country
of Europe. It is not doubted, however,
that Austria will assume a neutral at
titude sooner or later.
The delay of Germany is felt to be
due solely to Germany's consulting her
own commercial interests before shap
ing the exact terms of her neutrality
proclamation. From the first Germany
and Great Britain have opposed the
right of search as detrimental to Brit-
ish and German commerce. Thus far
Spain has announced a much more rad
ical doctrine than the United States on
this matter. The Spanish order, pub
lished in the Official Gazette last Mon
day, announced the purpose of exercis
ing the right of search of all merchant
ships on the high seas. The President's
proclamation of yesterday qualified the
right of search by saying that it "is to
be exercised with strict regard to the
right of neutrals, and the voyages of
mail steamers are not to be interfered
with except on the clearest grounds of
suspicion, etc." It is understood that
this matter of right of search is caus
ing hesitation on the part of Germany
and that if it is satisfactorily estab
lished that German merchant ships
shall not be subjected to harassment
Germany will adopt the same course as
other nations.
The attitude of Portugal is felt to be
more important just at present than
that of any of the great powers of
Europe, owing to the presence of the
Spanish fleet at the Cape Verde Islands,
belong to Portugal. Neither, the State
Department nor the Portuguese Min
ister at Washington had received word
up to to-night as to the purpose of
Portugal on the question of neutrality.
This caused considerable apprehension
in official circles here, as it was felt
that Portugal's vicinage to Spain
might induce her to withhold neutrality
for a time. She owns the Cape Verde
group, the Azores and the Madeiras,
which would give the Spanish fleet
three very important bases of opera
tion. Late in the day the press dis
patches from Lisbon, saying that the
Cabinet Council will declare neutrality
to-morrow, relieved this apprehension
considerably. The effect of the decree
will be to compel the Spanish fleet at
Cape Verde Islands to leave imme
diately. It is felt, however, that Por
tugal has done her neighbor a good
turn in deferring the proclamation un
til to-morrow, as the Spanish fleet has
been laying in stores and coal for sev
eral days past and doubtless will be
fully equipped and ready to sail be
fore the neutrality proclamation forces
them out of Portuguese waters.
Colombia is the only South or Cen
tral American country which has thus
far declared neutrality. Spain has
counted much on the co-operation of
Spanish-American countries, but there
is no reason to doubt that all of them
will adopt a neutral position.
Members of the diplomatic corps dis
miss the reports coming from Europe
that another move toward European
intervention will be made as soon as
Spain suffers a decisive reverse. This
is said to be purely conjectural; as no
such move has taken form thus far by
the exchange of notes. It is accepted
as settled that no mot-e ships intended
for the American navy can leave the
ports of those countries which have de
clared their neutrality. This result is
most serious in the case of the cruiser
Albany, now at the Armstrong yards
in England. The view among diplo
matic officials is that neither the Al
bany nor the torpedo-boat Somers can
leave, even though the United States
flag was raised over them before the
proclamation of neutrality was issued.
It Is said the raising of the flag can
not avoid the manifest uses of the
ships for war purposes.
NO BANGER OF
WATER FAMINE
Citizens of Sausalito Resent a
Misstatement Concerning
Their Town.
Not at the Marcy of Flames Nor
Likely to Suffer From
Thirst.
Special Dispatch to The Call..
SAVSALITO. April 27.â citizens of
this town were considerably amused to
day to learn that they were 'in danger of
a water famine and that if a fire broke
out the place would be at the mercy of
the flames. At least, this was the absurd
story published in two of , the morning \
dallies, and it is asserted that the imagin- i
ations of the correspondents : led them !
into ludicrous error. There is plenty of i
water here and a freer use of It would i
conduce to less lurid misrepresentations. I
"It is a shame that this place should j
so frequently.be placed in a false light by '
inveraclous newspaper correspondents," j
said Trustee A. Sylva. "All that occurred
was as follows : I asked Mr. Tillinghast, j
secretary of the Sausahto Land and
Water Company, why water was I turned
off at .11 p. ; m., and he said in reply that I
it was because water :in the springs did j
not rise well until August, and, in accord
ance with the practice of companies gene
rally throughout the 1 State, i economy . was
necessary, Just now. Mr. Tillinghast said j
he ' had asked â  other companies *to assist j
them, but it was an absolute falsehood j
to say that he had promised to give up
his system if they would do so. His quot
ed statement .that the company had been
sinking, hundreds of wells was never
made.
DISARMS THE
STATE TROOPS
Governor Leedy of Kan
sas Issues Some Pecu
liar Orders.
Disregards Every Wish Made
by Representatives of the
War Department.
It Is Evident That the Government
Will Secure Raw Recruits and
Not Guardsmen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WICHITA, Kans.,April 27.â At
midnight to-night Governor
Leedy was hanged In effigy on
First street in front of the ar
mory of the National Guard.
Crowds of people are marching
back and forth on the street
hooting and yelling: 'Down
with Leedy and Weyler."
TOPEKA, Kan., April 27.â Governor
Leedy took action to-day which practi
cally disarms the State National Guard,
and there is every indication that Kan-
Bas will have no troops ready for ser
vice outside of the State for several
weeks, possibly a month. It is clearly
the purpose of the State administration
to "turn down" the State militia, and
the three regiments from Kansas must
be made up largely from raw recruits.
Goevrnor Leedy received a message
from the War Department authorizing
him to organize the State troops to
suit himself, though advising him that
the department preferred the enlist
ment of the National Guards. He also
secured permission to mobilize his re
cruits in Topeka instead of at the Gov
ernment barrackÃ at Fort Leavenworth
as the War Department had ordered.
Immediately upon securing this au
thorization, the Governor telegraphed
to the captain of every Kansas militia
organization directing that all army
clothing and all equipage belonging to
the State or Federal Government be
forwarded at once to the adjutant-gen
eral in Topeka. This step in effect dis
arms the militia and has raised a storm
throughout Kansas. Following this
action the Governor named five recruit
ing officers, assigning them by Con
gressional districts, and these officers
will enroll the Kansas volunteers. Gov
ernor Leedy orders that after the com
panies are recruited they shall select
their own company officers.
TOPEKA. Kans., April 27.â The Gov
ernor's orders directing the militiamen
to deliver their uniforms, guns and all
other equipment to the adjutant-gen
eral has caused open revolt in some of
the National Guard organizations.
Word came from Wichita that the
equipment of the company there would
be held for hall rent and other ex
penses incurred in keeping up the com
pany, and there is talk of assembling
the Second Regiment at Emporia to
morrow, despite the Governor'sNjrder.
At Hutchinson to-night Gcvernor
Leedy was hanged in effigy by the an
gry militiamen. When the Governor
was informed of this affair he said:
"If the boys will keep their shirts on
they will find that I -Rill treat them
right."
The Governor's Populist supporters
insist that it is his intention to enlist
as many of the privates of the National
Guard as are eligible under the War
Department's requirements.
BALTIMORE, April 27.â The Fourth
Regiment, Maryland National Guard,
has broken camp at Pimlico and re
turned to the armory in this city. It
is reported they have rebelled because
of dissatisfaction at not having beeen
assigned to active service by General
Wilmer, the Fifth being assigned to that
honor.
MONTIJO MAY
BE RECKLESS
Possibility That He May
Proceed to Meet the
Fleet of Dewey.
Commander of the Spanish
Squadron at the Philippines
More Brave Than Wise.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, April 28.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Dally Mail, tele
graphing Wednesday, says: It is
thought possible in some quarters that
Admiral Montijo, commander of the
Spanish squadron at the Philippines,
who has a reputation for reckless
bravery and determination, but does
not shine as. a tactician, may put to
sea and take the offensive. The pub
lic is elated by the Montserrat's suc
cess, which is regarded as furnishing
proof of the ineffectiveness of the
blockade of Cuba.
Senor Romero Robledo declared in
the Cortes to-day that Spain ought to
make up her mind to Strugs'^ alone,
since no one would support her. He
said he believed the present situation
was the result of repeated acts of
weakness on the part of Spain toward
America and that he considered as
wholly useless the autonomy project
fur Cuba. On the other hand, he
thought Spain ought to do everything
possible to revivify and strengthen the
integrity of the empire and to main
tain the sovereignty of the mother
country in Cuba.
Admiral Beranger, former Minister of
Marine, Is of the opinion that it would
be exceedingly profitable to Spain to
adopt privateering. The Senate to-day
delivered to the Queen Regent its re-
I ply to the speech from the throne. The
i members of the Government were
present.
MADRID, April 27.â 1t is difficult t?
describe the state of the public mind
' to-day without being paradoxical.
| Every one believes that the Spanish-
American fleets in the far East may
have engaged or are just on th 3 eve of
i engaging in the first battle of the war.
j The foundation for this belief is a tele
: gram from Rear Admiral Montijo,
j commandant-general at Manila, to the
Minister of Marine late last night,
which says: "I am leaving with a
j squadron to take a position of expecta
tion for the enemy." The people, con
sequently, are possessed by a feeling of
disquiet and confidence. Disquietuue is
shown in the eagerness with which all
i details and strengths of the respective
i squadrons are discussed and the con
! fldence by the knowledge that the
! Spanish forces will move heaven ard
! earth to win a victory. The Heraldo

Spaniards Yet Gro-wling About Un

Over England's Policy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, April 27.â As a counter
poise to the growing Bympathy toward
the Carlists among the people since
Don Carlos raised a vigorous war note
against the United States, the Spanish
cardinals and prelates are now assem
bling here to visit the Queen Regent
collectively, declaring their adhesion to
and support of the dynasty. They will
endeavor to convince the people that
the Queen Regent has never advocated
peace at any price, but thoroughly
participated in the enthusiasm of the
people to defend the honor and rights
of Spain.
This attitude of the prelates will
cause a sensation throughout the coun
try, greatly irritating the Carlists. To
night Madrid is absolutely unmoved.
The capture of the American bark Sar
anac by a Spanish gunboat near Man
ila caused a momentary excitement,
but the tcnvn is expectant of the result
of the action likely to occur off the
Philippines and awaits the outcome
with perfect confidence. This confi
dence in the navy is an article of faith
with the Spaniards. The papers po
litely chaff the Americans on "their
want of dash in capturing only fishing
boats and ocean tramps."
One Journal says: "El Morro's sig
nal gtins were mistaken on board the
American squadron for offensive fir
ing. The gunners of El Morro know
that the squadron has kept well out of
range, and they wish it would not."
There is a strong expectation of
European complications and increasing
doubt in the "assumed neutrality of
England." It is believed she would
join America to-morrow were she not
deterred by a fear of uniting the pow
ers In a crusade against the Anglo-
Saxon."

TULARE LAD CRUSHED
UNDER TRAIN WHEELS.
Loses His Life While Stealing a Bide
on the "Blind Baggage" to
Fresno.
FRESNO, April 27.â The body of Syd
ney Lawler of Tulare was found this
morning horribly mangled on the rail
road track near the Southern Pacific
freight shed. Last evening Lawler and
two other lads named Thomas and Clark
thought they would come to Fresno on
the n blind baggage" for a lark. They
boarded the train and rode as far as the
Valley road crossing near Fresno. At
that point Thomas and Clark entered the
passenger coaches, but Lawler remained
on the baggage-car platform. Arriving
in town Thomas and Clark left the train
and sppnt the night hunting for their
friend. They could get no clew to his
whereabouts until they found his body at
the Morgue at about noon to-day.
No one knows how the young man met
death. The supposition is that he at
tempted to leave the train after his com
panions went into the cars and slipped
beneath the wheels.
It is reported shots were heard in the
vicinity or the station last evening about
the time the train came in, and it is
thought that some brakeman may have
fired at Lawler. This is to be investiga
ted. An examination of the body made
this afternoon showed no bullet wounds.

CONSIDER
COST OF
THE WAR
Statesmen Discuss the Bill
to Increase the
Revenue.
Dingley Says Three Hundred Mil
lions a Year Will Be Required.
Bailey Asks for Income
Tax, Not Bonds.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, April 27.
The opening of three days' debate on
the war revenue measure attracted
crowds to the House galleries to-day
and the attendance on the floor was
also large. Rev. Hezwell, who deliv
ered the invocation, asked the Divine
aid and direction for our army and
navy. Without any evidence of excite
ment or preliminaries of any kind the
House went into committee of the
whole, after the reading of the journal,
and entered upon the consideration of
the bill. Owing to its importance Ding
ley, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, did not ask that the first
reading of the bill be dispensed with
as usual with bills of minor impor
tance.
Dingley emphasized the necessity of j
united action in support of the measure
In order not only to impress Soain but the
countries of Europe with the profound
conviction that the American Congress
and the American people stood shoulder
to shoulder without regard to party in
the determination to prosecute to a suc
cessful termination the war we had un
dertaken.
Dingley' spoke with great earnestness,
and was listened to with profound atten
tion. Many of the Democrats left their
places and took seats on the Republican
side to hear the better. With great im
pressiveness Dingley said that unless all
signs failed the war would not be a three
months' affair, nor a six rionths affair,
and that the more preparations we made,
both for offense and defense, the shorter
it would be. When he reacned the ques
tion of the bond Issue he was besieged
with questions by McMillan. Sayers and
other Democrats, and there was some
discussion of the probable cost of the
war.
Sayers ventured an estimate of $300,000 -
000 per annum, which Dingley rejected,
calling attention to the fact that the
Civil War cost $1.100. 000,00Â») -Â»r annum.
Sayers, while avowing his willingness to
vote every dollar necessary to prosecute
the war, contended that there was no ne
cessity for authorizing in this bill the
raising of $700,000,000. when Congress
would meet again in December. A ple
thoric treasury in time of war, be ar
gued, would invite endless schemes of
speculators until it was gone.
Dingley pointed out that the authoriza
tion for $000,000,000 bonds was simply an
authorization. If not needed ail the bonds
would not be issued. Dingley briefly dis
cussed the proposition which the minor
ity would advance for an income tax as
a substitute for the bond proposition. The
Supreme Court had declared the tax un
constitutional, and yet it was proposed
in place of an authorization to borrow
money to renew a law suit which had
already been decided against . the Gov
ernment. "It seems so preposterous in
such an exigency." said Dingley, "that
1 can hardly believe such a proposal is to
be seriously presented." The proposition
to coin the silver seigniorage he charac
terised as one of the absurdities of finance
which was never heard of beyond the
borders of the United States. Seignior
age was the profit from coinage. We are
not now coining silver.
Pingley was given a hearty round of
! applause when he concluded.
! Bailey, the leader of 'the minority, fol
lowed Dingley with the opening argument
|on his side. He said that his side realized
I as much as the other the necessity of
raising revenue to carry on the war, and
they stood willing to co-operate in plac
ing at the disposal of the Government
every material aid for the prosecution of
the war to a successful and speedy termi
nation. There would be no difference of
I opinion that the Government should be
abundantly provided with revenue. But,
said he, the minority would not be either
led nor driven into the support of meas
ures which commended themselves neither
to thier conscience nor judgment. They
reserved the right to oppose the measures
by which the majority proposed to pro
vide the war fund.
Bailey spoke with a trace of bitterness
at the treatment the. minority had re
ceived at the hands of the majority. The
chairman of the Ways and Means Com
mittee had said that the pending bill fol
lowed closely the system of war taxation
which obtained at the close of the Civil
War. That system, Bailey said, had been
j followed in respect to those taxes which
| fell most heavily upon the producing and
consuming classes. Beer, tobacco and
other articles were taxed, but in one re
i spect, in his opinion utterly Indefensible,
the system in vogue at the end of the
Civil War had been discarded. The tax
! on bank capital and bank deposits was
! omitted. At one-half of 1 per cent such
i a tax would produce $10,000,000. If there
\ was one species of property above all
: others that ought to be the subject for
! extraordinary taxation it was bank de
posits, the only form of property owned
by one class which was used by another.
i There were in banks of the United States
i $i,700,000,000 of deposits.
Proceeding with his criticism of this
and some other features of the bill,
Bailey declared that, imperfect as it was,
his side of the House would take ft ff
the other side would accept their propo
sition for an income tax which would
provide an additional income of $100,000,000.
(Democratic applause.) He thought the
estimate of Dingley ($25,000,000 a month
for war expenses) a reasonable one.
Bailey also contended for the proposi
tion to coin $48,000,000 of the silver seign
iorage, and to that he thought an issue of
$58,000,000 of legal tender could be added
with propriety. The greenback circula
tion could be extended that far without
danger.
The gentleman from Maine (Dlnglev)
advocated the placing of a bonded debt
on this country of $600,000,000. Whenever
i the country's credit ought to be pledged
i he would be willing to do this, but there
! was not. In his opinion, any necessity
I for mortgaging that credit at this time
"We propose." said Bailey, "to tax the
rich men now, rather than to mortgage
the energies of the poor men for coming
! generations " (ApplauÃe on the Demo
i cratic side.)
: Discussing the question of the Supreme
Court s decision of the income tax case,
, he declared that no Question was ever
; settled until it was settled rightly. Bailey
then entered upon an extended argument
,upon the constitutionality of an Income
tax combating the theory that it was
: a direct tax inhibited by the constitution.
â  B i u . le y "* aid , the , lncome tax provisions
which the minority had drawn, and which
would be offered by McMillin. had been
drawn to meet that portion of toe court's
decision which was unanimous, and in
which he concurred, by exempting fed
eral state, county and municipal bonds.
Dolliver (R.) of lowa, a member of the
â  Ways and Means Committee, was then
recognized He was listened to with
( close attention and was frequently inter
rupted by applause. He said in parr
There are two ways in which a Gov
ernment can support a large expense of
: this character, either by collecting it in
cash or by borrowing it on credit The
committee on Ways and Means has fully
considered both methods, and we have
made up our minds that the Government
; ought to pay as it goes so far as it can
leaving as little of the burden of our in
tervention in Cuba to the future as pos
sible. If the war upon which-we are about
to enter was to secure new national pos
sessions or any other acquisition of mate
! rial assets, the case might present a view
j somewhat different. But here, for the
first time in the history of the world, a
nation- has of its own volition thrown
! away- any prospect of aggrandizement
i arid "has based its action upon disinterest
i ed grounds, so that what we are about
' to do, however much it may minister to
I the present satisfaction and moral com-
I fort of the community, concerns posterity
i vastly less than it does us.
"If there was a case in the history of
the world where a situation amounting
to a declaration of war was the direct re
sult of the wish and purpose of the people
1 themselves, it is in this case. It cannot
be said that the President of the United
States has plunged his country into a
war. If he had done so, heedlessly put
ting in peril the welfare of a country like
this, instead of being entitled, as he is, to
the respect and confidence of the world,
it would be better that a millstone were
hanged about his neck and that he wero
drowned in the depth of the- sea, His
tory will acquit the President of such an
acL of hostility to the public welfare. I
do not predict the size and the cost of the
undertaking in which we are embarked,
but my conviction is that we will gain all
that we lose and infinitely more things
we have already gained, and one is the
i outspoken sympathy of this great Eng
! lish speaking race, of which we are a
i part; another is a larger sense of the
| unity of the American people, a unity
! that* has already killed tne spirit of sec
tionalism, taken the poison out of parti-
I san strife and brought in the better era
| of American patriotism.
Bell (Pop.) of Colorado, in stating the
i position of the Populists, announced his
i unalterable opposition to the bond pro-
I vision of the bill. Nothing, he declared,
! could cause such a shudder among the
people of the country as the announce
ment that they were to be saddled with
I another bond issue.
Then, discussing the provisions of the
i bill, he asked why the taxes were to be
| exclusively levied against the poor. Why
! did not the rich railroads bear part of
I the burden? Why did not the colossal
I Standard Oil Company bear its share?
r The>.burdens should fall equally on all
interested.
Lacey (R.) of lowa gave notice of an
j amendment to prevent the invalidation of
j Instruments on which the stamps due
I were inadvertently omitte-d.
Ridgeley .(Pop.) of Kansas closed the
) debate for the afternoon with some brief
remarks in opposition to the bond feature
of the bill.
At 5 o'clock the House recetieecl until 8
j o'clock.
The night session of the House was de-
I voted to brief speeches by members who
j were unable: to secure time during the
day. Many speakers only had time to
ask permission to extend their remarks
in the record. Only two Republicans-
Gibson of Tennessee and Ormstead of
New Yorkâ spoke to-night. The Demo
! crats and Populists all opposed the bond
i proposition. The speakers were Kleberg
(D.). Texas; Wheeler (D.), Kentucky-
Lewis (D.), Washington; Green (Pop.),
Nebraska; Cowherd (D.). Missouri; Ben
ton (D.), Missouri; Vandlver (D.), Mis
souri; Davis (D.), Alabama; De Vries

Ed Gilleran.
SANTA CRUZ. April 27.â Eleven
bodies of those killed in the powder
mill explosion are in the undertaking
parlors of Wessendorf & Staffler. The
corpse of Ed Gilleran, who was killed
by a falling roc I',1 ', and that of Guy Fa
gen are the only ones which have been
identified. The identification of any of
the others is an impossibility, as they
are horribly blackened and charred.
The names of only ten are known, the
eleventh body not having been claimed.
The known dead are James Miller, the
foreman of the Government smokeless
powder, and the six boys enployed in
this mill with himâ Ernest Marshall,
Luther Marshall, Charles Miller, Ernest
Jennings, Guy Fagen and Jo Josephs â
the last three had worked in the mills
only two days. The two carpenters
who were killed were Charles Cole and
Henry Butler, who were at work on the
outside of the vacuum dry house, and
Kd Gilleran, killed by a falling rock
while on his way home.
The wounded are: Mrs. Margaret
Worden, cut by flying g-lass while Jeav
ii.Â»r hontt; i>r. \Y. H. Congdon,
Btrtick on back by flying rock while
emerging from a cottage in the village;
Mark Connelly, bruised back, broken
arm and injured internally; Michael
Noon, two horrible gashes on head; Joe
Fritz who was near the coal house, cut
on head from a flying piece of coal;
Thomas Sutton, gash on head from fall
ing timber; C. B. Rea, knocked on back
of head by a rock and in the fall left
elbow dislocated; John Nelson, a car
penter, cut on the forehead and his
arm fractured.
It is safe to say the first mill that ex
ploded -was the vacuum dry house. Then
the Government smokeless for big guns,
cannon powder, shotgun smokeless and
Handley mill caught from flying
sparks. , The gun-cotton store house
and the shotgun smokeless store house,
in which was stored gun-cotton also,
went next. The last and heaviest ex
n destroyed the nitro-glycerine
More house. It contained one ton of
nitro-glycerine.
These mills were all situated on the
east side of the creek. The scene this
Ing was one of desolation and
waste. What was not demolished by
the Explosion - as destroyed by fire and
over a tract of five acres on this fla?
all that remains are ashes and the
pieces of machinery -which are scattered
ov<>r the ground.
Where the vacuum dry house stood
and also the nitro-glycerine store house
are two immense excavations. They
are twenty feet deep and the shape of
a cone. The soft dirt is scattered all
over, several foet deep, and on top are
timbers and the branches of trees.
The coal house, which was near the
smokeless, is burned to the ground.
A large amount of wood was burned â
3000 cords of powder wood and 500 cords
of redwood. The boiler was ruined.

NEW YORK, April 27.â The seventy
sixth anniversary of the birthday of
General U. S. Grant was celebrated to
night with a banquet at the "Waldorf-
Astoria, under the auspices of the
Grant Monument Association. Two
hundred and forty-six guests were
present. The principal speaker was
Henry Watterson, whose subject was
"The Reunited Sections." He said in
conclusion:
If thf-re was any doubt anywhere about
Â»*he restoration of the Union, not merely
fla fa<n and in name, but in the spirit to
which it owes its birth, themanlfestatlons
of the last few weeks cannot have failed
to dissipate it. That Spanish gentleman
who proposed to supplement the forces of
his country in Cuba by inciting the South
to â¢Jinthnr rebellion must surely have
The new boiler, which is being put up
fifty yards from the scene of the ex
plosion, is the only thing intact.
Across the river every window in the
packing houses, and the wheel and |
press houses is broken, but only one
mill is a wreckâ that of the refinery,
where the saltpeter and soda was j
mixed.
The scene at the once pretty powder
mill village is a sad one. The only
structures left standing: are the old
office, the schoolhouse and several
small cottages. The boarding-house
is a total wreck.
Th" fire started from firebrands from
the works and commenced at the old
lodging-house, where the carpeters j
roomed. The houses of William John- |
son, another lodging-house, the home j
of Prank Patton, that of John Dennett, ;
George Mower's cottage and the last
dwelling on that side of the street,
owned by John Welch, went in their !
turn. The flames then crossed the j
street and the home of Mrs. J. Rooney
was destroyed.
Coroner Clark impaneled the follow- j
ing jury to-day: Henry P. Rice, J.
W. Smith, William E. Lyman, John j
Werner, Christian Hoffman, W. W. |
Lane. G. R. Gray, Sam Miller, A. J. j
Irving, William Grantz and F. G. Clark. I
It viewed the remains at the under- I
taking parlors and then adjourned un
til Monday morning at 10 o'clock.
To-day has been one of mourning in
Santa Cruz for those killed. Six were
boys connected with local families, and
the men were heads of families and
leave widows and children to mourn
their loss. The saddest feature of the
powder-house horror Is that none are
able to recognize their dead except the
relatives of Gilleran and Fagen. The
flags on the city flagstaff and on build
ings about the city, which have been
flying since the declaration of war, arÂ«
now at half mast.
The first funeral of an explosion vic
tim was held to-day. It was that of
Guy Fagen. He was the only son of
Bert Fagen, who at present is engi
neering in Mexico, and was a grandson
of Dr. P. B. Fagen, the capitalist. The
services were conducted from his home
on Plymouth street, in North Santa
Cruz. There was a large attendance.
Many beautiful floral tributes testified
to the high esteem in which the young
man was held by his friends. The im
pressive burial service of the Episcopal
church was read by Rev. C. O. Tillot
pon of Calvary Episcopal Church, of
which Guy was a communicant. The
pallbearers were Carlos Dennis. Gar
field Bull. Alfred Witney, Frank Fargr>,
Ed Williams and Henry Folsom. These
boys are all members of Guy Fagen'9
Sunday-school class and of the Percy
Webber Society. The interment was
in the family plat at Odd Fellows' Cem
etery.
The funeral of Edward Gilleran will
be held on Friday morning from the
Roman Catholic church, where requiem
mass will be celebrated for the repose
of his soul.
To-morrow afternoon there is to be
a public funeral over the remains of
James Miller, Ernest Marshall, Luther
Marshall, Ernest Jennings, Joseph Jos
ephs, Charles Miller, Charles A. Cole
and Henry Butler. Services will be
held in the armory, the largest building
in the city. The clergymen who are to
officiate are Rev. H. McNamee of the
Catholic church. Rev. C. O. Tillotson of
the Episcopal church and Rev. E. H.
Hayden of the Baptist church. Some
of the victims were members of these
churches. The interment will be at
Odd Fellows' Cemetery, where the Cal
ifornia Powder Company has a plat,
and where it will erect a monument to
their memory.
A big benefit will be given to-morrow
at the opera-house by Professor Fon
tana, the mindreader and hypnotist,
who is giving performances in this city.
The gross receipts will go to the benefit
of the families of the unfortunates who
lost their lives in the explosion. The
receipts are to be placed in the hands
of the cashiers of the three banks of
this city, who will place the funds
where they will do the most good to
relieve the immediate distress of fam
ilies left without providers.

In truth, most of those supporting Spain
In her 111-starred contention seem to be
lineal descendants of the famous Don!
Sir, the reunited sections of the Union
stand a wall of iron between the nation's
honor and. if need be, all the world;
stand a wall of fire between the stricken
Cubans and any further hurt from Spain.
We want no other warrant for our act
of war than the cruel, the heartless story
of the Spaniard In America. From the
coming of Cortez and Pizarro to the going
of .Weyler â three centuries of brutality,
irradiated only by the pirate's lust for
plunder and the tiger's thirst for blood
each succeeding captain-general has
seemed to emulate AlvÂ« as a rival of
Satan by seeking a second immortality
of damnation. Before such an array, his
torical and contemporary, the true Ameri
can neither consults his geography nor
counts the cost. Hla pulse-beats are the
same In Massachusetts and in Mississip
pi, and whether the band plays "Yankep
Doodle" or "Dixie" Is all one to him!
Assuming that In ordinary times it takes
but a few months and a change of rai
ment to convert a typical Vermonter into
a typical Texan, it has taken but a few
weeks to impress upon the reunited sec
tions of the Union the truth that we are
the most homogeneous people on the face
of the globe: that such differences as ex
ist among us are local and external, and
not skin de<-- and, along with this les
son, to reawaken in all hearts Decatur's

WILL CAPTURE
CUBAN PORTS
Plans Completed for the
Invasion of the
Island.
Insurgents Will Be Near By to
Aid the Forces Sent by the
United States.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 27.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Within three
days the North Atlantic squadron will
strike a blow at a Cuban port, which
will result In the seizure of an Amer
ican base of operations. On high au
thority I learned to-day that Satur
day has been determined upon as the
day of attack, and the Insurgents are
collecting in the neighborhood of the
port to be captured, for the purpose of
aiding the men-of-war in its prompt
reduction. All the necessary plans
have been perfected, and the authori
ties have high hopes that they will be
executed without much loss of life.
In order to facilitate the work of the
forces operating against the port se
lected, plans have been completed, as
the Herald stated this morning, for
making a demonstration either upon
Havana or some other point which will
draw the attention of Captain-General
Blanco, and with that officer and his
troops occupied in defending the sup
posed point of attack a second division
of the fleet will be bomDardlng the
port which will be taken, and under
the fire of its guns 2000 marines and a
number of blue jackets will be landed.
Nineteen thousand insurgents are ex
pected to aid in securing the evacuation
or capitulation of the Spanish troops
defending Havana when that point is
attacked. It is geneiTLlly understood
that the army of 15,000 men which will
be sent to the port proposed, after it
has been taken, will at once fortify the
place and through them arms and am
munition will be sent to the insurgents.
In addition, I understand, a num
ber of large field guns will be sent to
Cuba, and when the assault on Havana
is commenced, the guns will be
mounted on commanding elevations
and will aid the American men-of-war
in shelling the city.
Concerning the details of their plans,
the authorities are secretive, and be
yond admitting that the expedition is
in contemplation, they will say noth
ing. The troops which -will take part
in the expedition are those at Tampa,
Mobile and New Orleans. There are
5000 men at each of these points. Army
transports have been collected in the
gulf, and there will be a sufficient num
ber handy to take the troops when the
word is given to move after the Cuban
port has been captured.

NEVADA CITY, April 27.-Patriotlc
sentiment actuated the whole of to

the following resolution adopted by a
unanimous vote:
The Native Sons of the Golden West in
Grand Parlor assembled, this 27th day of

of loyalty, reaffirm allegiance to our State

A. L. Morgenstern of San Francisco
moved that some action be taken ex
pressive of the feeling of the members
of the order relative to the destruc
tion of the battle-ship Maine and 260
members of her officers and crew. The
matter was, by consent, referred to a
committee instructed to prepare a suit
able resolution.
It has been decided to defer the elec
tion of grand officers to serve during
the year until Friday, as the business
that is yet to come before the body
will consume the time of to-morrow's
session. This understanding is ac
ceptable to the many candidates for
office, as it will allow them another day
In which to canvass for votes. The
contest for the seven places on the
board of grand trustees promises to be
exciting, as there are more than a
dozen candidates in the field. Grand
Marshal C. O. Dunbar is making a hard
fight for a place on the board, and his
friends believe hip prospects of being
elected particularly bright. Henry
Lichenstein of Alcatraz Parlor has
withdrawn from the contest out of
courtesy to snmo of his personal
friends, who are seeking a seat in the
board. George Dryden, whose popu
larity extends beyond the bounds of
the order, is conducting the campaign
of L. K. Hagenkamp for the position
of grand outside sentinel, and is also
assisting the candidacy of Lewis F.
Byington for re-election on the board
of trustees.
At to-day's session of the Grand Par
lor it was decided that the 9th of Sep
tember celebration for the year 1900
shall be held in San Francisco.
A committee of five was appointed to
commemorate the trials and hardship
of the Dormer party, with Instructions
to report at the next meeting of the
Grand Parlor. This is looked upon as
the beginning of a movement for the
erection of an appropriate monument.
To-day's entertainment programme
included a street parade, in which all
of the local and visiting Native Sons
participated. Other local organizations
and about 500 school children were in
the line of march. To-night the youth
and beauty of Nevada City assemble!
at Armory Hall, where there was a
grand ball In honor of the visiting na
tives.
To-morrow's programme includes a

afternoon and an entertainment by the

FIRE AT YOUNTVILLE.
Incendiary Continues His Persecu
tion of a Woman.
NAPA. April 27.â The fourteen-room
house belonging to Mrs. Bryant was de
stroyed by fire at Yountville at 4 o'clock
this morning. The fire was probably in
cendiary, as an attempt to burn the same
dwelling was made a few days ago but
without success.
Mrs. Bryant was away from home at
the time the fire occurred, and nothing
was saved.
Less than two months ago a house be
longing to Mrs. Bryant was burned on
her ranch near Yountville.
The supposition is that some person
having a grudge against the lady is re
sponsible for the conflagrations.
The dwelling was one of the old land
marks of the village of Yountville and
was worth several thousand dollars and
was protected by $2000 insurance.

will represent the new claimants in the
struggle for the fortune.
Notice of the existence of the heirs
was filed in the Superior Court to-day.
When the news came that the rich
old farmer had died and that no will
could be found a number of persons
instituted search for relatives. It was
the general supposition that he had no
near kinsfolk, but Mr. Thompson as
certained his place of birth, and com
municated with the authorities there
through the German Consul of San
Francisco. Christensen was born in a
little town in Denmark, and a search
was made of the records there. It was
found that four cousins of the deceased
were still living â three women and one
man. The latter is Hans C. Thorel
sen. The family name of the women
was also Thorelsen, but they are now
married. Their marriage names aro
Catherine. M. Jaeobsen, Christine M.
Wolff and Helen M. Haverner.
In all likelihood the fortune of $150,000
will be divided among these cousins,
for the law firm says that proof of their
relationship is absolute and that it can
be proved that they are the only sur
viving heirs.

EVIDENCE OF REMORSE.
r^ OMMENDATION of the Morrow decision,
I which will enable the Railway Commission to
probe into Southern Pacific methods, is general.
It funds have been used for the corruption of courts
and legislatures, thwarting the purpose of wholesome
legislation, the public has a right to know it. That
the obstacles to placing Mr. Huntington on the stand
have been swept away is a matter for congratulation.
Mr. Huntington has at command a vast fund of infor
mation. He could divulge much of interest, and that
he may have an early opportunity to do so, stimulated
and encouraged by suggestions from the commission,
is a natural and proper hope.
Such is the view taken even by the Examiner, and
a more noble example of unselfishness has seldom
come to light. In order to have the wicked Mr. Hun
tington immolated it is willing to lay itself on the altar
and give the world a chance to joy in the odor of its
scorching. With fearless candor, and without heed
that attention will be drawn to its own sooty hue, the
pot has called the kettle black. Brave potl
We have the unusual experience of finding our
selves in agreement with the Examiner. Let the
operations of the Southern Pacific be laid bare. Some
of these are known in a general way, and there is a
3*earning for particulars. It is known, for instance,
that the Examiner was for a period of almost two
years receiving from the soulless corporation $1000 a
month, and when this payment was shut off without
having readied the expected aggregate of $30,000
the paper made great ado over Southern . Pa
cific sinfulness. There has never been, a full
understanding as to the terms of this payment, and
now the commission can not only find out all about
it. but do so with the full consent and approbation of
the Examiner. At least that sheet, fired by remorse
or something, declares that it wants the whole truth
brought out. It generously refrains from asking that
art exception be made in its own favor. Mr. Hun
tington has already sworn before a public body' at
Washington that he had a contract with the Exam
iner for its silence. Details are still lacking. If he
sustained a running account with that paper which
has never been closed, he can tell what it was for and
why there has been no final settlement. We are as
glad as the Examiner; possibly more so.
There are rumors that the Examiner has an in
fluence over the Commissioners, that it assumes to
tell them what they shall do. Some go so far as to
assert that Mr. Hearst thinks he can have the. com
mission, following his will, exact only such testimony
as shall reflect upon the integrity of the Huntington
policy, and leave the Examiner unspotted in its atti
tude as a reformer, no hint of its rottenness brought
to the surface. Of course this view cannot be ac
cepted. In the first place it would not be in con
sonance with the righteous indignation of the paper,
and it would call into question the good faith of the
Commissioners. Naturally the Commissioners will
by the thoroughness of their inquiry do away with
any such fallacious impression, and frankly develop
the fact that the Examiner is a rogue, even if the pang
of remorse has made it in a degree penitent; while
to stamp itself as absolutely sincere the Examiner will
be obliged to turn State's evidence and ask the mercy
of the court.
Spain is said to rely on the climate to kill American
froops. There is a possibility that American troops
will keep from getting mixed up with a climate so
sinister. In the meantime if Spanish soldiers can re
main there without food and thrive amid microbes
which would be fatal to others, they are tougher
than had been supposed.
The Spanish commander of the Philippine fleet an
nounces that he is going to capture all the American
vessels. This would be much more considerate than
to sink them, and, besides, he would find some of
them quite useful after he has scared the Americans
into the sea.
The war bulletins issued by The Call have done
good in more ways limn one. Through them the
news has been given to the public promptly, and the
bogus "extras," which were making life a burden,
have been killed off in most cheering measure.
Another man who expectorated on the floor of a
street car has been rebuked. He was not only ejected
by his whiskers, but fined in the Police Court. Serves
him right. Any man old enough to raise whiskers
ought to have sense enough to be decent.
Properly the Mangrove belongs to the feather
weight class, and yet she seems quite at home among
the middle-weights. â¢"
TREASURER WIDBER'S BONDSMEN.
IF the Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland,
the surety corporation which guaranteed the integ
rity of Treasurer Widber, succeeds in evading its
liability for the defalcation of that official it will be in
order to relegate official bonds in San Francisco to
the limbo of farce comedy. No sane person ever ex
pects individual bondsmen to pay. In the eye of the
law those bondsmen are always good fellows who
ought to be let off, or straw men whose property
never can be discovered when it becomes' desirable to
levy upon it. Personal guarantee bonds have conse
quently long been a joke. But if it shall now be
found impossible to collect from a surety corporation
the whole subject should be turned over to Sullivan,
Gilbert and Hoyt.
Still it must be admitted that, as its manager de
clares, the surety company which guaranteed Widber
has a grievance. It had a right to rely on the vigi
lance of the officials deputed by law to make a
monthly examination of the Treasurer's accounts.
The Widber policy was practically a thirty-day risk.
Unquestionably the corporation would have with
drawn from the bond or never issued it had its offi
cers supposed that the Mayor, Auditor or Superior
Judge were going to resort to "hefting" the Treas
uier's money sacks or accepting them as true to label.
The law says that they shall "see" and count the coin.
As a matter of fact they neither saw nor counted it.
Whether the failure of the Mayor, Auditor and Su
perior Judge to "see" and count this money constitutes
such a variance as will void the insurance contract of
the Fidelity and Deposit Company is a question of
law in which the public will take a lively inter
est. Whether it will be possible, in case the corpora
tion succeed in avoiding its obligation, to make
Mayor Phelan pay the shortage is another question of
law in which the public will take even a livelier in
terest. There is no difficulty, however, in reaching
| a conclusion upon both questions in advance. We do
j not hesitate to say that in our judgment the affair will
I wind iip by the taxpayers standing the loss. Neither
the surety company nor Mayor Phelan will pay;
Auditor Broderick and Judge Bahrs cannot pay, hav
ing nothing with which to pay, and as the taxpayers
have plenty they will have to pay.
This result has been foreshadowed to some extent
by. the course of Widber himself. When he began
stealing he considerately released his individual |
bondsmen and took out a policy in a foreign surety j
company. This was very kind of him. Probably had j
he anticipated that Mayor Phelan might be held re- !
! sponsible he would have persuaded that gentleman to i
deed his property to trustees and take out a surety I
; bond in some other foreign corporation himself, j
! Evidently Widber intended to rob the taxpayers or
: the Man-land- Surety Company â which seems to have
| been immaterial.
One thing, however, may be considered certain.
If Mayor Phelan squirms when his liability becomes
fixed â if it ever is fixed â he may as well retire from
politics. An attempt to evade returning to the tax
payers the $117,000 stolen by Widber will give to his
public spirit and patriotism such a sickly, mercenary
hue that the push of all parties will speedily inter him
in the political cemetery, unwept, unhonored and un
sung.
THE GERMAN ATTITUDE.
I 7 HILE Great Britain has been prompt to re
\A / spond to the notice given by our Government
â  of the existence of war: with Spain, other na
tions have been less regardful, and irom Berlin comes
the report that Germany, while . observing a strict
neutrality, will not at any time issue a formal declara
tion to that effect, "having determined to reserve for
itself perfect freedom of action."
In adopting this course the German Government
follows the policy it pursued during the war between
Turkey and Greece. Perhaps there is some advan
tage in such a position, which is known to diplomat
ists, although it is not clear to the eyes of outsiders.
Germany may have had interests to guard in the fight
over Crete that would have been jeoparded by a for
mal declaration of neutrality, but it is not apparent to
the world that she has any over here that could be
injured by hex neutrality or bettered by her active in
terference.
The attitude taken by the Berlin Government is
exactly that outlined and advocated by German news
papers for some time past, and the fact leads to the
conclusion that the press must have been more or
less inspired by high officers of state. Upward of a
week ago our dispatches from Berlin gave an elab
orate review of an article in the Hamburger Nach
richten, urging neutrality, but declaring German in
terests must be watched, and closing with the state
ment, "German theoretic opposition to Monroeism
can be practically enforced only when German inter
ests are at stake, which is not now the case."
It is worth noting that nearly all leading German
papers, while adverse to American interference in
Cuba, are none the less aware that the sentiment of
the large German population in the United States is
as loyal to this Government and as ardent in patriotic
devotion to the cause for which America fights as that
of any other citizens of the country. All of them,
moreover, recognize the importance of respecting in
Germany the sentiment of the German-Americans.
Even the Nachrichten, while asserting the need of a
close watch to protect German interests, adds: "At
tention must be paid to the feelings of Germans in the
United States." The sentiment of American citizens
of German descent and the trade with the home coun
try growing out of it is in fact one of the greatest in
terests Germany has in this hemisphere. It is the one
she should most carefully guard.
Taking all things into consideration, the announced
resolve of the Kaiser's Government to issue no forma!
declaration of neutrality, but to reserve to itself per
fect freedom of action, is hardly much more than a
piece of diplomatic stage play. It sounds, indeed, like
the voice of one who expects to be called on to in
terfere before the fight is over, but the meaning may
be quite different. At the present outlook, at any
rate, German interference is as unlikely as that of
Great Britain. . . â¢
Sausalito, by determining to have open pool
rooms, displays a certain sort of enterprise. The
little suburb does not propose that its young men
shall be obliged to leave home in order to have their
lives corrupted. If they find it necessary, as is often
the case, to steal in order to be able to play the races,
at lenst they must spend their stealings at home. The
village fathers seem to have overlooked the question
of morality, but their commercial instinct comes out
clear arid strong.
A question seems likely to arise soon as to what a
bond given by a public official is for. There was
formerly a theory that the protection of the
public was one of the considerations.
Another feature of the "extras" is mat they are
teaching, the innocent newsboy to lie in a loud and
jarring voice.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, THURSDAY, APRIL 28, IS9B.
THE SPIRIT OF ANARCHY.
THE record of several anarchists who, by bomb
throwing and other forms of assassination, have
brought themselves into positions in which their
lives could be laid bare furnishes an interesting
study.
They have usually been found to have lived in vio
lation of the moral law which . was in force among
men before national codes were formed, and is under
stood to restrain men even when they are beyond the
reach of codes and statutes. Their domestic rela
tions are frequently illicit, and their ideas of rights of
property are not derived from the Ten Command
ments.
As organized society and the laws of states are
based upon the rights of person and property and de
fend the moral foundation of the domestic relations,
anarchy lifts its hand against society and against gov
ernment.
When confronted with such records as are revealed
by the arre3t of anarchists who have been guilty of
assassination it is their practice to reply that the
moral offenses committed by them are also practiced
by others who profess to support organized society
and to support government.
That is obviously true. But such violators of the
moral code are secret sinners who realize their of
fense and conceal it, and shrink from making its prac
tice the social rule by the destruction of government
and its institutions.
The spirit of anarchy is one that resists moral re
straint, that chafes under the discipline of institutions
and strikes impartially at church and state, because
each is in its way the agent of morality and discip
line.
It would seem, then, that anarchy is the cult of ab
normal man, of the class of atavists who reject every
thing that has come into the world with civilization.
Those who publicly propagate it are the apostles
of crime, the evangelists of assassination.
Their cry to the laboring man is that he is a siave,
and no means are omitted to embitter him and make
him an agent in the destruction of civilization and
government.
It needs no profound knowledge or exalted intelli
gence to discern the motives or deny the premises of
anarchy. Modern civilization, which it attacks, has
lifted the face of labor from the ground and turned
it to the stars. It has taken labor in the mass out of
serfdom into independence, out of a hut into a house.
It has dotted the nations with schools wherein the
sons and daughters of laboring men have been freely
offered the opportunity for a better education than
was within the reach of princes a thousand years
Government and civilization have put the personal
and property rights of labor on exactly the same
footing and under the same judicial protection as the
rights of the rich, born in purple.
The improved economic conditions, due to modern
civilization, have put over labor a shelter, into its life
comforts and on its table food that were the exclu
sive possession of royalty and nobility five hundred
years ago.
So government and social institutions can point to
what they have done for the enfranchisement of man
since the Dark Ages. To what can anarchy point as
its achievements for humanity? To the innocent
torn to shreds by dynamite; to the President of a
republic murdered in his carriage; to a Czar who de
creed freedom and ownership of land to 25,000,000
serfs, assassinated in the streets of St. Petersburg;
to a score of faithful policemen, murdered in Haymar
ket square while doing their duty as protectors of
person and property. What has all this crime and
violence done for labor? Has it given wages, shelter,
food and schooling? Has it advanced man a step in
the path of further progress which civilization has
opened to him? â  ' .
Let it blazon its achievements and inform labor of
the mighty things it has wrought for those who toil,
that the world may strike a balance between murder
and civilization as a means for the uplifting of the
race.
GUARDSMEN AND VOLUNTEERS.
AN interesting point in relation to the proposed
wholesale transfer of the National Guard or
ganizations into the Volunteer Army is raised
by the Brooklyn Eagle in the assertion that the mem
bers of the National Guard cannot legally resign
from that force in which they are now enlisted nor
enter the Volunteer Army until their enlistment terms
have expired.
The point is of no practical importance at this mo
ment, for the American people have a rough and
ready way of overriding legal technicalities when they
stand in the way of any action on which the whole
nation is resolved. Nevertheless the issue is worthy
of consideration, for technicalities of law when
brushed aside have a fashion of coming tip at times
in unexpected ways to torment a good many people.
If, therefore, there is any obstacle of that kind in the
way of transferring guardsmen into the Volunteer
Army it ought to be removed by law, so that it may
never hereafter cause wrong or injury to any citizen.
The Volunteer Army as provided for by Congress
is to be essentially different from the .National Guard.
It is organized for different purposes and is under
different control. The man who enters the Volunteer
Army retires by that act from the National Guard.
Nevertheless, the Secretary of War, in issuing his
call upon the Governors of the various States for their
quotas of volunteers, says it is desired "as far as prac
ticable the National Guard be given the preference."
This preference will of course be complied with by
the Governors, and the enlistment of the guards will
be encouraged. When this has been done, and the
National Guard has faded away into the Volunteer
Army, what force is to do the duty formerly attended
to. by the guard?
The Eagle says the War Department is in the
wrong "when it intimates that it will not accept the
services of the National Guard unless its members re
sign from their commands and enlist in the army with
other volunteers who are coming in from all over the
country." It is not clear, however, how the War De
partment, could have done otherwise. The Govern
ment wishes the guardsmen because they are better
drilled, than other citizens and because they are al
ready organized, but it cannot accept them on differ
ent terms from other volunteers who are to be their
comrades, to serve in the same regiments and often
in the same companies.
The tangle is not a very serious one, but it may give
rise to complications later on, and the military
authorities ought to straighten it out at once and
make a fair start. The young hero who goes to the
front cannot expect to understand everything in re
gard to- his situation in the campaign or in the battles
that are to come, but he ought to be enabled to know
whether he is a volunteer or a guardsman.
Of course the story that the powder works explo
sion was the work of a Spanish spy appeared in due
season.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
To judge from Mme. Albanl's experi
ences, Australia must be a "land of Co
caigne" for famous American singers.
The prima donna has been making a tour
of the country with her own troupe, and
she was everywhere received with as
much prestige as if she had been a poten
tate visiting a nation of faithful subjects.
In the cities the civic authorities vied
with one another in receiving her with the
greatest pomp, but what will strike
greater astonishment into the minds of
Americans is the fact that the railroad
companies entered into the most zealous
competition to see which could claim the
honor of having rendered Albani's transit
over its line the most agreeable. At Vic
toria the private car belonging to the
Governor of the province was given over
to Albani's use, and all over the country
the best sleeping cars were placed gratis
at the disposal of her and her troupe.
MME. ALBANI, Whose Tour Has Resembled a. Royal Progress.
(From a Recent Photograph.)
The whole tour was one long triumph.
One reason for the official character given
by the Australians, to Albani's tour was
no doubt the warm esteem-and friendship
in which she is held by Queen Vivtoria.
She has many times sung "by command"
at court, but, more than that, she has
been received in an informal and entirely
friendly way by the Queen â an honor
never bestowed by Victoria on any
woman, however exalted her rank, unless
her. name is spotlessly above reproach.
Aibani has been for nearly a quarter of a
century one of the most popular prima
donnas in London, and her Australian tri
umph is only the culmination of her Lon
don career.
Albert Carre, director of the Opera Co
mique, has announced that Paris is two
centuries behind the age in the matter of
stage mechanism. The only French the
ater that possesses revolving scenes is the
Varieties. The system is simple. It con
sists of a vast round floor which occupies
the entire depth of the stage, and on
which two scenes can be set, back to
back, so to speak, with all their lighting,
scenery and' accessories. Scene I turns
when it is no longer needed and gives
place to scene 11, which has been set for
the second act before the performance be
gan. While act II is being played the
scenery of act I is replaced by the scen
ery of act 111, which by another rota
tion comes to the front as soon as act II
is ended. These successive changes can,
of course, be continued indefinitely, and
their effect Is .to reduce the entr'actes to
a minimum. Even the revolving scene of
the Varieties is rudimentary compared to
the mechanism of some of the German
theaters. At Munich, stage mechanism
reaches its highest pitch of modernity. In
fact, the idea of a revolving scene at all
is due to King Louis II of Bavaria, who
evolved it years ago' in making experi
ments in models for stage settings for
Wagner's operas. At the Munich Deut
sches Theater, which is built of iron and
cost nearly a million and a quarter dollars,
the whole stage mechanism is performed
by electricity. An electric dynamo works
the machinery and one man, seated be
fore an indicator, can, by pressing a but
ton, perform the work of a whole army of
scene-shifters. In this way fhere are
scarcely any waits between the acts, and
the audience is sent home betimes. The
only local theater-goers who would com
plain if San Francisco caught up with the
age are the gentlemen who go out "to see
a man" between the acts. The leading
London theaters have had revolving
scenes for years.
In Europeâ and, unfortunately, also in
Americaâ an impression seems to prevail
that "Robin Hood" is the highest oper
atic flight expected of the American com
poser, and that "Ma Angeline" is a very
fair sample of native talent for song writ
ing. Legrand Howland promises to wipe
away the mistaken Impression that the
United States possesses no serious com
posers, and he is accomplishing the feat
by striving to get European indorsement.
The Paris Figaro says oi' some excerpts
from his opera, "Nita," which were re
cently performed under his ov/n direction
at Monte Carlo:' "The extreme youth of
the composer certainly counted in the
spontaneity of the enthusiastic reception
awarded him, but his music shows a very
abundant and facile temperament. He
possesses melodic and harmonic inven
tion, and he especially appeals to his
hearers by the great variety of his or
chestral coloring. This interesting debut,
consecrated by unanimous applause, gives
reason to hope that Legrand Howland
may take place among our best operatic
composers." The latter remark shows
that Howland has enough talent for
France to stand ready to adopt him. If
France adopted Mc*Dowell and a few
other gifted Americans they would prob
ably receive the recognition they deserve
at .home.
The European papers give long para
graphs to the wonderful success obtained
at Venice by a new oratorio, "The Trans
figuration," written by a young priest
composer, Dom Perosi. The enthusiasm
of the Venetians has taken such extra
ordinary proportions that other Italian
towns are clamoring to hear "The Trans
i figuration," and the foreign musical cen
ters have telegraphed to the composer for
the right to perform his work. Clamorous
crowds attended the five performances at
Venice, where Dom Perosi conducted, and
as the secular and royalist press was not
likely to show any special favor to the
work, on account of its composer's cloth,
it is generally conceded that the eulogistic
criticisms were due to the real beauty of
the music. Dom Perosi, who is worn out
with fatigue and the excitement attend
ing his. unexpected notoriety, has hitherto
refused to entertain any propositions for
performing his music abroad. He has,
however, consented to go to Milan and
conduct his oratorio some time during
the second week in May.
The new- director of Ihe Imperial Opera
of Vienna Is making- himself so hated
that a general uprising- among the sing
ers and dancers Is expected at any time.
He has promulgated a code of Draconic
I laws and by-laws which deprive the em
ployes of the Opera of all personal lib
erty. No artist can go outside Vienna,
even on the day's when he is not Singing,
without written permission from the
management, and whether there is a re
hearsal or not, the entire corps de ballet
i has to sign a rollcall at 11 o'clock every :
: morning. Schroeder and Marie JRenard :
I have refused to renew their engagements,
and all the lesser singers are contemplat- i
| ing escape from the thralldom of the Vi
enna Opera. Marie Renard is an idol of
the Viennese public, and it will be hard
to replace her.
The Italian papers state that since the i
death of his wife Verdi can no longer j
bear to live at his beautiful villa of j
Sant Agata, where he lived so happily for
years with Signora Verdi. He has de
; cided to settle in Milan and will take up
! his quarters at the Milan Hotel (Albergo !
i Milano), where he will retain the suite i
lof apartments to which the proprietor ;
j years ago gave his name. The Milan ;
Hotel has always been his headquarters
when in the capital of Lombardy. but he '
has objected to remaining long in Milan, {
as admiring crowds followed him when- j
ever he went out. No doubt the aged i
maestro hopes the familiarity will pre
vent the Milanese public from annoying
him in this way.
Mme. Schumann-Helnk, the famous
contralto, has written to deny the rumor
| that her ten years' contract with the
'< Berlin opera would prevent her from
j singing at the Metropolitan next season, j
j She says she will positively appear. The i
: letter is to a private friend. t Referring to i
! the sudden taking oft of Anton Seidl. j
! Mme. Heink says she thinks the gap will I
! be hard to fill, but from information re- |
ceived from Maurice Grau she says Herr I
Mottl, Arthur Nikisch and Dr. Muck are
being negotiated with, the chances being
greatly in favor of Dr. Muck's coming.
At Candia, in an old monastery of Ven
etian monks, a number of interesting and
hitherto unknown documents have been
| discovered, relative to Othello, who com- |
! manded the eralleys of the Venetian re- ',
I public and won several naval victories, i
I These documents state, among other i
I things, that Desdemona survived the '
; famous Moor of Venice many years. ;
This is overturning romance with a yen
! geance. Since Shakespeare's time a
! number of famous musicians have told in
| lyric strains the fate of Desdemona, and
now it appears she was not smothered at
! all. Instead of being a poor victim sing
| ing touching ditties. Desdemona lived to
! become "the widow Othello."
The Berlin papers announce that Wein
, gartner has been offered the conductor
i-ship of Grau's season of German opera
:at the Metropolitan next season. The
sum named as the inducement is $15 000.
; Nikisch, according to the same authority,
has been offered the conductorship of the
: permanent symphony orchestra at an hon
ararium of $20,000 a year. On account of
previous engagements both Weingartner
and Nikisch have refused the tempting
: offers.
The German opera season as the Im
! perial Mario Theater of St. Petersburg
, has been a bis: success. On the final
; night of the season the Emperor and the

j Gounod, whose ".Romeo and Juliet"
formed the bill. The De Reszke brothers

"HOW ARE YOU, SANITARY ?"
Down the picket-guarded lane
Rolled the comfort-laden wain,
Cheered by shouts that shook the plain,
Soldier-like and merry ;
Phrases such camps may teach,
Saber cuts of Saxon speech,
Such as, "Bully 1" "That's the peach I"
"Wade in, Sanitary."
Right and left the caissons drew
As the car went lumbering through,
Quick succeeding in review .'.
Squadrons military ;
Sunburnt men, with beards like frieze;
Smooth-faced boys, and cries like these ;
"U. S. San. Com. !" "That's the cheese 1""
"Pass in, Sanitary."
In such cheer it struggled on
Till the battle front was won ;
Then the car, its journey done,
Lo, was stationary ;
And where bullets whistling fly
Came the sadder, fainter cry,
"Help us, brothers, ere we die-
Save us, Sanitary."
Such the work. The phantom flies,
Wrapped in battle clouds that rise ;
But the brave, whose dying eyes,
Veiled and visionary^
See the jasper gates swung wide,
See the parted throng outside,
Hear the voice to those who ride â
"Pass in, Sanitary."
IN the troops to march away from
California will be many native sons.
They will go willingly, eagerly, and
know that the love of the State that
sends them forth will follow them to
bivouac and battle-field, may reach
them as they lie in distant hospitals, and
will inspire countless prayers for their
safe return. They will know this, be
cause the people will bid them godspeed
with tears and cheers. They will re
member it because all that is possible
to do for their welfare will be done.
This State proposes that her sons shall
have every comfort that can find its wav
into the haunts of war. The red cross
waves close to the stars and stripes.
Yesterday the Grand Parlor of Na
tive Sons in session at Nevada City
passed a resolution favoring the work
of the Sanitary Commission. That the
resolution carried an appropriation of
$100 was a pleasant incident. It was an
earnest of sincerity. It meant more than
words alone. The Native Sons are not
only in sympathy with the movement,
but they realize that many of their own
number will go to the front, and they do
not shrink from the possibility that
some may never return.
In this city the red cross has nothing
but friends. Everybody is anxious to
help the cause along, and nothing but
the exact opportunity is lacking. Or
ganization could not be accomplished
in an hour, but it is almost complete,
and soon the method by which each one
may assist will be understood. The

For a few hours yesterday afternoon
Mrs. Bertha Grainer, an old woman j
â who lives in Alameda, was locked up !
In a padded cell in the insane ward of
the Receiving Hospital. She was or- I
dered Into custody by Judge Coffey, |
pending an examination as to her \
sanity.

Rabbi Nieto last night visited the Re- j

Sonic time ago the husband of Mrs. !
Grainer died, leaving her an estate â¢
valued at several thousand dollars. She ''â 
employed Attorney Peixotto to assist â 
her in getting possession of the estate,
and according to her story she gave j
him $800 as a retainer.
Several relatives of the old woman, i
becoming alarmed at what they termed i
her "extravagance," petitioned Judge |
Coffey to declare her incompetent and j
also to appoint a guardian over her.
Yesterday the matter was heard, and :
as the unfortunate woman realized that I
an effort was being made to "Job" her, I
as she expressed It, she became ex

Monday night there is to be a meeting
at the California Hotel at which de
tails will be arranged. , The proper
committees once appointed, an execu
tive staff at work, and the money will
come pouring in. Such a small sum is
needed that if any embarrassment, arise
it will be due to a surplus. Yet no gen
erous impulse is to be checked by this
possibility. The sum asked will repre
sent the actual and pressing necessity.
It has been estimated that for the care
of the California volunteers there must
be provided a little more than Soooo.
This will be for the present volunteers.
But soldiers of the regular army are al
ready in the South, having gone from
this post. Although they came from
various parts of the Union, California
now regards them as her own. And
there is no telling what the future may
hold. It may be that there will be an
other call and more taken to the front.
Above all it must be remembered that
the red cross gathers under its folds
no element of selfishness. Wherever
there are men in pain it waves for all.
Wherever there is opportunity to bring
a cup of cold water to fevered lips the
red cross is the emblem. So there is
no need to think that because the sum
specifically called for is small there
should be laxity of effort. No amount
that could be raised would be in any

She was then taken to the Receiving
Hospital and thrown in a padded cell.
A friend, learning of her sad predica
ment, at once communicated with
Rabbi Nleto with the result that he
lost no time in reaching the hospital.
After a short conversation with the
woman he became convicted that she
was sane and he sent for Wallace Wise,
his attorney. They both declared that
it was an outrage to have locked the
woman up and at once proceeded to
secure her release. Meeting Dr. L,us
tig, one of the Commissioners of In
sanity, they told him of the action of
Judge Coffey and requested him to have
a talk with Mrs. Grainer. the doctor
subsequently visited the hospital, and,
after a short conversation with the
woman, gave as his opinion that she
was sane. He then ordered the hospi
tal authorities to release her.
Amid many exclamations of joy Mrs.
Grainer left the hospital after fre
quently thanking Rabbi S'ieto and Dr.
Lustig for their efforts in securing her
release.
Rabbi Nieto has known the woman
for nearly five years, and during that
time he says he never discovered any
symptoms of insanity.. He strongly
believes that her relatives are doing
all in their power to have her com
mitted to the insane asylum in the
hope of getting possession of the estate
left by her husband. .__

NATIVE SONS
PLEDGE SUPPORT.
The Red Cross League of
Vital Importance to
the Order.
NEVADA CITY, April 27.â The Na
tive Sons of the Golden West are for
war. The ten thousand members of the
order, through their representatives
who are here as delegates to the Grand
Parlor, have made a public declaration
of their patriotism and declared their
willingness and readiness to shed their
biood for the flag of their country. This
was a day long to be remembered in
the history of the order because it was
devoted almost wholly to the expression
of sentiments that breathed of love of
country and the desire to let the world
know that the Native Sons of Califor
nia are ready to lay down their lives
in the service of the State and the na
tion.
Not only this but the delegates to the
Grand Parlor gave practical proof of
the earnestness of their loyalty by
pledging their moral and material sup
port of the recently organized Red
Cross League, which has for its object
the sanitary equipment of the brave
men who will form California's quota
of volunteers for immediate service in
the war with Spain. The approval of
the order and the support of the order
has been pledged to this humane work
and as an earnest of what may be ex
pected In future the Grand Parlor has
donated the sum of $100 to aid in pro
viding California's heroes with . what
may be necessary to alleviate their suf
ferings from wounds and from sickness
on the field of battle.
This action took the form of a resolu
tion introduced by five members who
had been selected by the Grand Parlor
as a committee to consider measures
involving the causes of the present war
with Spain. When presented to the
main body E. L. Head of San Fran
cisco proposed the adoption of the reso
lution. This was acceded to without
debate and the motion was carried
without a dissenting vote. The resolu
tion is as follows:
Whereas, The patriotic men and women
of California having organized a Red
Cross League, to the end that the brave
men who are tor lend their lives to the
service of the nation may be better pro
vided with sanitary equipment and may
receive on the field of battle such care
and attention as will in a measure allevi
ate their sufferings from wounds and
from sickness, therefore he it
Resolved, That the Grand Parlor of the
.Native Sons of the Golden West does
hereby heartily indorse the action and ap
plaud the humane and patriotic senti
ments that prompted it. And be it further
Resolved, That the grand treasurer be
and Is hereby authorized to pay " to' the
president of the California Red Cross
League the sum of $10). which sum to be
used In assisting: the work of the league.
And be it further
Resolved, That the attention of subordi
nate parlors of this order throughout the
State be- called to this good work and
that they be recommended to lend it such
support and sympathy as may under the
circumstances be possible.

The attorney at once sought Judge
Low, who was holding court at the time,
and informed him that he was ready to
furnish bail for the five bunko men. For
some unexplained reason Low set their
bail at the ridiculously small amount of
$25 each, notwithstanding, it is claimed,
that the arresting officers had informed
him of the dangerous character of the
men. As the clerk of the court was not
present, Judge Low consented tn take the
money and deposit it wltn the desk ser
geant of the City Prison. In the mean
time Attorney Mack had filled out the
requisite orders of release and induced
Judge Low to sign them.
Mack at once started for the harbor
station, intending to present the orders
for the discharge of the prisoners. Shortly
after he left Judge Low's court the bunko
men wore transferred to the city prison.
Desk Sergeant Bidwill, acting under ln-
order w.ho are among- those who will in
a few days be sent from this State CO
do their share in the battles that will be
fought for the honor of the nation.
OAKLAND CHILDREN ARE
FIRST.
The movement among the people of
Alameda and San Francisco Counties
looking toward alleviating the suffering
of soldiers and sailors in the conflict
likely soon to come has extended to the
younger element. The pupils of Miss E.
Thompson's room in the Lincoln School,
Oakland, of which T. O. Crawford is the
principal, have organized what will be
known as the Junior Red Cross Society
No. 1.
Tho object is to gather and prepare
the supplies of bandages for surgical use.
The officers of this, the first society, are:
Harry Leach, president; Marion Walsh,
vice-president; James Mitchell, secre
tary; advisory committeeâ Cornelia Strat
ton" (chairman), Edith Downing, Bonnie
Downing. .Ray Coyle, Etta Dickinson.
Tht; members include: Louise Hall,
Mary Hops, Milola Ward, Ernestine Mol
ler Maggie Bercovich, Susie Stow, Veva
Campbell, Elsie Palmer, Lela Martin,
Nadine Belden, Grace Madden, .Olive

Davidson, Ralph Evans, Roy Farish,-Le
land Garfield, Harry Holt, Lawrence
Hotchkiss. Millard Merrill, Leo Thomp
son, Vernle Sheehan, Ezra May, Horace
Steward, Albert Ralston, Merril Kinsey,
Ernest Gray.
This Is the patriotic school of the State.
It planted a Lincoln tree in the plaza
and has a. Lincoln guard on all occasions
when suitable patriotic exercises' are
held.
MONEY AND
HOW TO GET IT.
The California Red Cross
Will Need $9000 to
Start With.
Twelve Ambulances, $350
each $4200
Fifteen Major Operating
Cases, $150 each 2250
Four Emergency Field
Cases. $120 each 480
Ten Field Tables, $15 each 150
Hospital Supplies, includ
ing First Aid Packets,
Field Tents, Absorbent
Cotton, Antiseptic Gauze,
Bandages, Pots, Blank
ets, etc â  2000
Total. $9080
This is the estimate furnished by Dr.
Hopkins, surgreoh-general of California,
and by Dr. Gallwey, his right-hand
man, of the requirements of the Sani
tary Corps of California, when, within
the next few days, the State shall be
called upon to furnish 4000 men to the
Government.
Every dollar of this $9000 is as ab
solute a necessity for the California
soldiers as are the guns with which
they are provided. But this Spanish
war, coming on so unexpectedly after
thirty years and more of peace, finds
the Sanitary Corps altogether unpre
pared.
Dr. Hopkins says: "We are on ' a
magnificent peace footing. When it
s . to real war we lack just $9000
worth of necessities. The National Gov
ernment â though organized on excel
lent principles â is unable to provide for
so great an emergency. ' If our men
leave California to-morrow they leave
unprovided with propor hospital sup
plies. They go to take part in a
campaign where disease will be more
disastrous than bullets, and we of the
Sanitary Corps accompany' them,
knowing: that when the sudden' call is
made for our services, we shall be
handicapped by lack of the ammuni
tion with which surgeons fight."
It will be the first care of the. San
Ptructions from Judge Low. after book
ing them, allowed them to go on the
money given him by the Police Magis
trate.
A short time afterward Mack visited
the city prison and r<r learning that the
men had been released handed the desk
sergeant â¢ the orders of discharge signed
by Judpre Low.
The action of Judge Low In placing the
ball of the men at $2"Â«. each caused con
siderable surprise in police circles. Here
tofore the minimum bail !;n.s been $150,
and at times as hiph as $500.
"When taken Into custody the defend
ants had a complete outfit for robbing
the unwary, but notwithstanding that
Judge Low was shown their scheming
devices he fixed their bail at the ridicu
lously low sum of $2F. each. As. the' men
boast of a "jnill" it Is thought likely
that Low will dismiss their cases to-daj
without the formality of a trial.

inp to his shrewd business instincts,
which are supplemented by a trait which
his friends call "laudable frugality" and
his enemies term "parsimonlousness."
Some time ago this gentleman concluded
that he had arrived at that state where
he needed a helpmate to travel with him
along the path of life and assist him in
presenting to his country citizens who
would be able to offer their services to
the sanitary commissions of the future.
There was, however, one thing which
troubled him. lie had seen so much of
women that he realized how little value
they set on money, and he did not want
to marry a girl whose inclinations would
be to spend on dress and other frivolities
the nest egg that he had spent years de
veloping in his pharmaceutical Incubator.
But how to find the kind of a girl that
would prove the realization of his ideal
was the thing that troubled him. Finally
he resolved to take his case to an old
maiden aunt and get her advice on it.
The aunt listened to his dilemma and,
when he had linished, said: "My dear
nephew, I certainly agree with you that
it is a good idea for you to marry and
provide yourself with a home. I also
think that you should know something of
the disposition of the woman who you in
tend to wed. Now, I'll toll you what we'll

itary Commission, now thoroughly or
ganized and enthusiastically preparing
for work, to supply these deficiencies.
But, though they are not yet aware of
the fact, a host of small auxiliary
branches of the commission are about
to be formed, to share in this particu
lar work.
There are thirty or forty thousand
school children in San Francisco. And
every one of these young Americans is
afire with patriotic ardor.
"Why," writes a school girl, "if every
one of us gave only 10 cents, a third
of the cost of properly equipping the
Sanitary Corps would be done already."
But there are some small patriots to
whom that "only 10 cents" might as
well be $10, or ten thousand, so unaÂ«
vailable is it. Hearts as loyal, hopes
as enthusiastic, there are south of Mar
ket street as upon the hill, where a
girl's candy money in a day is more
than nine out of ten children in other
localities see in six months of a year.
But difficulties were made to be over
come. The remedy for the non-pro
ductiveness of the tiny patriot, beggar
in all save hope, suggests the drummer
of his school, is that those who have
shall be taxed double.
"At our school," he says, "we're go
ing to form an auxiliary of the Red
Cross, and we're going to pay a nickel
a month till the war is over. Just wait
till you see the Red Cross badges blos
soming out in this school!"
There's a whirl of suggestions in
these young brains. Some are for a
monster fair, where every school child,
be he rich or poor, shall be able to con
tribute his share, in money or in talent.
For genius, the first, great democrat,
knows not social conditions. Its flams
is as pure, as bright in the breast that 1 *
covered by a threadbare coat, as be
neath the well-cut jacket. So soms
are for entertainments, where the gift
ed may shine, while the fortunate ones
pay their nickels to witness the con
stellation the united forces of San
Francisco's school children would pro
duce.
And for the child who lacks both
great giftsâ who has neither wealth nor
fame to lay down for his country?
However poor he be, he has still love
of country, and in the great outpour
ing he will find his opportunity to be
useful.
San Francisco school children are a
bit piqued that Berkeley has got ahead
of them. But they lay stress upon the
fact that it is the High School of Berk
eley that has organized the first schol
astic Red Cross association, and that
there is still opportunity for a r~Â°mmar
school and a primary school in town to
be the first to hoist the banner of the
Red Cross.
There, are schools that declare it is
their intention to* purchase an ambu
lance, or an operating case alone, and
that this contribution to their country
shall go to the front bearing the name
of their Alma Mater in the inscription
that makes the gift to the boys in blue.
There Is a dispute between two pri
mary schools on the subject of first
aid packets. First aid packets, these
children suddenly grown wise in the
use of technical terms will tell you, are
the four-ounce packages supplied to
every soldier in the ranks. They con
sist of a triangular bandage, of one
quarter of a yard of antiseptic gauze,
of half an ounce of absorbent cotton
and a piece of mackintosh ten inches
square. These packages are so com
pact, so light, that they take up little
room in a soldier's knapsack, and when
the emergency arrives the first aid
packpt arrives with it. These first aid
l>aok^ts cost but 14 cents apiece, since
Dr. McCarthy of the Sanitary Corps
has perfected arrangements for having
them made here. Whi< " school shall
supply these is the question which has
net yet been settled. .
Apart from the lack of funds the
Sanitary Corps of California is in ex
cellent condition. There is not a bet
tor trained corps in the United States.
The men have been, thoroughly drilled
in ambulance work and in the man
agement of the simpler casualties. The
thirty t-urprenns and 140 men composing:
the corps have worked wo-nders under
Dr! Hopkins' guidance. Dr. Gallwey

ladies you know to come up here to the

whLch will be both a pleasant ana an in
expensive entertainment. We will watch
the girls as they pare the apples and, I
think, the girl that pares the quickest
and closest can be safely depended upon
to make you happy." The party was
given, the girls came and were watched,
and the young lady who pared' the closest
became a wife before sixty days had
passed. The young couple have been liv
ing together for some time now, and the
husband has no reason to repent of his
choice. The only thing that interferes
with their domestic happiness is the
trouble they are continually having with
servants. As yet they have not suc
ceeded in keeping a girl with them over
a week.

Offense to the Flag.
A yard of yellow bunting sewed to the
end of an American flag that was flying
from the window of a photograph gallery,
at 31 Third street, aroused the indignation
of M. Irvine and Robert McCall yester
day afternoon. They deemed it an insult
to the flag, and in their enthusiastic pa
triotism they appealed to the Chief of Po
lice to have it removed. Their appeal had
ho effect and they took the matter upon
memueives. Armed with a lone ladder
they climbed to where the flag with the
offensive tail was flying, and amid the
shouts and applause of a crowd pulled the
yellow bunting from the folds of the
starry emblem of liberty.
Stole a Large Mirror.
W. J. Anderson entered the lodging

Heinz took him to the City Prison, where
a charge of burglary was booked against
him.
SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED TO AID THE FUND.
At the meeting of the Board of Education yesterday the follow

Resolved, That principals are hereby authorized to hold entertain

Commission and Red Cross League of California, provided, however,
it is distinctly understood that no assessment must be levied in any
â way on pupils of the department.
in Californiaâ "the lightest, best litter

Dr. Hopkins.
There is a fine spirit of sympathy, of
comradeship, among these surgeons.
One will tell you how his brother of the
corps dropped his entire practice for
three months during the railroad
strike, devoting all his time and a
goodly portion of his money to taking
care of the men called out up at Sacra
mento. He'll tell you, too, that the
State never reimbursed this unosten

service, unselfish, devoted as ever.

CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE.
Governor Budd Offers an Additional Regiment to the United
States Government,
At 6:15 o'clock last evening Governor Budd attached his name to
the following telegram, which was immediately flashed over the wirÂ«3
to the War Department: .
The Secretary of War, Washington, D. C: California desires 1 3
tender to the United States an additional battalion to complete three
regiments of infantry of twelve companies each in addition to the four
companies of heavy artillery. Would you accept a fourth regiment in
addition to the above if raised and tendered? Answer.
JAMES H. BUDD, Governor.
The hum of many voices, the rush-
Ing In and departing of uniformed or
derlies, the business-like dictating and
riling of official dispatches and the con
sultation of State military officers,
made an animated scene at the adju
tant general's headquarters yesterday.
"With systematic precision the prepara
tions for war are rapidly progressing,
and by the first of the week, when the
soldiers of California take the oath as
volunteers in the United States service,
everything will be in readiness for their
participation in the impending conflict.
Governor Budd was early at head
quarters to see that the affairs of war
moved as they should. From the mo
ment of his arrival until his departure
late in the evening every moment of
his time was consumed in the consid
eration and direction of business per
taining to getting the National Guard
into service. Generals Dickinson, Bar
rett and Warfield were in frequent con
ferences with the commander-in-chief
considering and advising as to the im
mense amount of detail work necessar
ily incident to the rapid preparations
for war.
A large clerical force wr.i busy com
piling the required tabulated reports
that the Government has requested to
be furnished it, and this force has been
augmented or rather is assisted by an
equally large clerical force which is
busily at work at Sacramento.
One of the most eagerly discussed
dispatches of the day was the one fur
nished by The Call's special war bulle
tin issued at noon stating that as soon
as the National Guard was mustered
into service it would be immediately
ordered to the Southwest in order to
move the volunteers from "demoraliz
ing home influences" and make soldiers
of them as soon as possible by putting
them in camp remote from home. This
met with the approval of the command
ing officers and Captain Carrington
stated that it would be a good thins
for the men as It would necessarily
have a tendency to harden the voiun
teers and accustom them to the rigor
ous and Reacting duties of the life of
common . oklier. As to the location
f the troops Captain Carrington thinks
.- will be in t he zone of New Orleans,
llobiie and Chuka manga.
The word "southwest" is presumably
used with regard for Washington, D.
C, as being the point from which the
location is meant to be.
Dr. W. F. McNutt and Hermann Ben
dsl of this city have informed General
Warfield that their pnns can be counted
upon to enlist in tho heavy artillery
he is recruiting. General Warfleld is
experiencing no difficulty in raising
men to man the heavy batteries called
for by the Government.
Regarding the rumor that the com
panies of tho Seventh Regiment would
not volunteer for service unless they
were allowed to go as a regiment the
following dispatch received at head
quarters yesterday afternoon is an of
ficial denial of thp same:
LOS ANGELES. April 27, 1898.
Adjutant General Barrett, San
Francisco: All statements that Na
tional Guardsmen here will not vol
unteer except on conditions they
dictate are untrue. They are ready
to do their duty. J. R. BERRY.
Colonel Seventh Regiment.
The request made of General Last
that he would be expected from his
brigade to furnish one company to man
a battery of the heavy artillery met
â with a prompt response from that of
ficer, who pent General Barrett the fol
lowing dispatch yesterday morning:
"Lob Angelea, CaL, April l' 7. I*9B.
"Adjutant General Barrett, San Fran
cisco, Cal.:
"Captain Steere reports his ability to
enroll 200 men for artillery service In
twenty-four hours. C. F. A. LAST,
"General Second Brigade."
Santa Barbara County is bubbling
over with patriotism and is anxious to
offer the services of its sons to sup
port the honor of "Old Glory." as is
testified by the following dispatch
which was received by General Barrett
yesterday afternoon:
"Sacramento, Cal., April 27. IS9B.
"General A. W. Barrett, San Francisco.
~Cal.:
"Just received following from Santa
Barbara: 'R. L. Peeler, assistant -ad
jutant-general: Will you allow forma
tion of independent sharpshooters as
home guards, armed and equipped at
our expense? Arthur G. Wilson, sec
retary." R- L. PEELER.
. Tb* following djepatch received yes
terday from General Last was in reply

"C. F. A. LAST,
"General Second Grlgade."
Governor Budd late yesterday after
noon gave out the following statement
for publication:
"There is no material change In the
situation and I have issued no orders.
I am simply waiting for my instruc
tions from Washington, D. C. When
I receive them I shall be prepared to
act, and inside of two hours from the
time they are received orders will be
issued and the National Guard will be
in motion."
Governor Budd yesterday afternoon
sent the following communication to
Captain Carrington in regard to the
mustering in of the National Guard,
which explains itself:
SAN FRANCISCO, April 27, IS9S.
Captajn F. de L. Carrington, on duty
With the National Guard o: California,
San Franciscoâ Sir: 1 am advised that
you will be detailed by the National Gov
ernment to muster in California's quota
of volunteers for the war between the
I nlted States and Suain. I also have ad
vices that 1 will be requested by the
National Government to cause the "ad
jutant general of the army to be in
formed of the time this quota will be at
the rendezvous, as it will be met a' soon
as possible thereafter by an officer to
muster it into the service of the United
States." I desire to suggest that you
communicate with the National Govern
ment and request that the United States
mustering officer be lirst at the place of
rendezvous, that 1 may tender him Cali
fornia's quota in such numbers, and in
such manner, as will facilitate their im
mediate enlistment in the United States
service. To mass the troops as a body
at the place of rendezvous and then await
a mustering officer, and the thereafter
mustering into the service of the United
States, would cause the State of Call
fnrnin a needless expense of about $10,000
per day, or over $2w.voU per month. I can
deliver California's quota as desired, and
in such manner as will cause the imme
diate enlistment of those nearest to the
point of rendezvous, without keeping
those from the interior and further points
of the State awaiting their turn in San
Francisco. In view of the great saving
to the State caused by this method, with
out any superior benefit from the method
proposed, I suggtj* that you communi
cate the matter t<> ti ; . War Department
U. S. A., and get advices for my informa
tion. Yours very truly,
JAMES H. BUDD.,
Governor California.
The Governor said: "I have taken
the step which I have set forth in my
communication to Captain Carrington
because it is economical, and at the
same time will c: jedite the business of
mustering in the guard, and will sub
ject the men to the least poss^le in
convenience."
Captain Carrinpton upon receipt of
the Governor's letter at once notified
the Secretary of War of its contents.
He said: "Governor Budd's sugges
tion may be a wise one, for unless the
regulations governing the mustering of
men into service are modified it will
take over a month to get the. Guard
into service. It takes about half an
hour's hard work to enlist one man. but
I am of the opinion that the require
ments will be greatly changed so that
a regiment can be rapidly enlisted, as
was the case in the late war, other
wise there may be a long delay before
the men are ready for service."
The expense of calling out the quota
of the National Guard demanded by fne
Government and having it rendezvous
at a given place for the purpose of be
ing mustered into the United States
service will cost the State $10,163 46 a
day. Of course as the men are enlisted
the expense would proportionately de
crease as they enter the service of the
Government. It is with a view of
avoidintr this great expense that the
Governor communicated to Captain
: Carrington the suggestions embodied in
i his letter. If the troops of the south
ern part of the State are mustered in
at Los Angeles matters will be greatly
expedited and the expense lessened.
Colonel J. F. Smith of the First In
fantry arrived at headquarters In the
afternoon. He declared that In his
opinion the ordering of the troops away
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 1898.
as soon as they have been mustered
Into service would be the best thing
that could possibly be done. He re
ported to headquarters that he. esti
mated that only 150 men from the en
tire First Regiment would be unable
to go, being incapacitated by some dis
ability. The exact number will be as
certained to-day.
At 4:45 o'clock Governor Budd re
ceived an answer to the dispatch sent
to the War Department by Captain
Carrlngton. In substance it officially
announced that the Government would
bear all expenses from the time a man
was enrolled until he has been mus
tered into service. From this it would
seem that the Governor's communica
tion to Captain Carrington had the de
sired effect with the War Department.
This only leaves the State liable to
the expense of $2 a day per man, as
provided for by the Legislature. Even
this amount will be lessened by the
suggestions in the Governor's commun
ication to Captain Carrington.
The Government will provide every
thing that is necessary' to enlist the
men. A board of medical examiners
will be appointed, and the men will be
required to pass the examination as
provided by the Government. This
board will be a large one, so as to facil
itate the mustering of the troops into
service.
FIVE BATTERIES
AT FORT POINT.
Men and Guns Ample to
Repel Attack of the
Enemy.
Before many days pass there will be
a tented field near the Fort Point forti
fications. Captain Charles B. Thomp
son, quartermaster's department, U. S.
A., will at once provide tentage for the
batteries of the Third Artillery on duty
at the works. The Angel Island bat
tery, commanded by First Lieutenant
Benjamin H. Randolph, will take sta
tion at the point to-day. Captain Sedg
wick Pratt's battery from i ort Mason
will also go out to the modern guns to
day. Before dark this evening the for
tifications at Fort Point will be manned
by five regular batteries of the Third
United States Artillery-
It will probably gratify many resi
dents of San Francisco to learn that
the band of the Third Artillery will
come over from Angel Island to-day
and occupy the quarters at the Presidio
recently vacated by the band of the
Fiiv^t United States Infantry. This
transfer of musicians will enable Col
onel Morris, commanding the post, to
announce that the regular band con
certs at the reservation will be re
sumed.
Colonel M. P. Miller, Third Artillery,
commanding the defenses of the har
bor, and Colonel Morris, Fourth Cav
alry, have talked over the subject of a
camp ground on the reservation for the
volunteer regiments of infantry to be
furnished by the State of California.
No place was designated yesterday, but
several sites were inspected. A good
place was found near the golf links; not
far from Seventh avenue. It may be

necessary for the State to supply the !
volunteers with tents, as much of the
Government tentage stored in San
Francisco ' was taken East with the
light batteries of the Third Artillery
and the First Infantry Regiment. The.
heavy batteries from this State will
probably go into camp with the regu-.
lars at the Fort Point works.
No doubt Colonel Miller, command-
Ing the defenses of -San Francisco, will
listen with the utmost courtesy to the
jepresentations of the Chamber of.
Commerce concerning the proposed en- :
listment of more men to re-enforce the
nsrular troops now on duty at the for-;
titicatiors, but he has too much mili- '
tary tact and experience to indorse any
plan that might tend to delay the en
listment of .artillery volunteers called
for from this State through the regu
lar channels of the War Department:
Wore) may come from Washington by
wire urging the Governor to hasten the
mustering in o*f men for. the heavy ar
tillery service. The Chamber of Com
merce telegrams transmitted to Wash- ,
ington yesterday may be regarded
there as a note of alarm from San
Francisco.
General Merriam and Colonel Miller
are confident that the men and guns
now in position here are ample to repel
any force that the enemy could bring
to this point. General Merriam is so
well satisfied that everything here is in I
good: form for repelling Invasion that
he left the city Monday evening last
for Vancouver. Before going he made
a thorough inspection of the fortifica
tions of the harbor.
FIRST CHANCE
TO VOLUNTEER
Points of Difference Among
Officers of the National
Guard.
General Dickinson Presents One Plan
and Colonel James Smith
Another.
There Is no disguising the fact that
some differences of opinion arise among
prominent ofllcers of the National Guard
of California regarding the manner of
selecting the organizations of the guard
for the proposed service in the volunteer
army of the United States. Company
officers desire that company organizations
as now officered should not be disturbed.
Colonel Smith of the First Infantry sub
mits that regimental organizations should
be preserved. Major-General Dickinson,
division commander of the guard, has
submitted a plan to the Governor under
which company organizations may be
preserved, but which will not permit any
existing regiment to go as a body.
The complication arising at this time
is unfortunate, and if not adjusted may
| constrain the. Governor to authorize the
immediate enrollment of the volunteers
called, for without regard to existing regi
mental or company organizations. It is
i not advisable to take all the troops from
one section of the State, and since all
counties in fairness should have represen
tation an entire regiment cannot be taken
from any one city.
General . Dickinson holds that his plan
j enables the companies to maintain their
â  integrity as organizations in the field. In
prefacing his statement he submits that
troops must be raised as follows:
Two regiments of inf-ntry, 12 com
panies each â 24 companies.; two battalions
jof infantry, .4 companies eachâ S com
panies. Total infantry, 32 companies, 103
officers and men each, 3296 men. Four
batteries of heavy artillery. 20) men each,
900 men. Totalâ lnfantry, 22% men; artil
lery, 800 men; aggregate, 4096 men.
General Lickinson further states: "I
have r.ot the exact strength of each com
pany on March 31 last, but approximately
let us say seventy men to a company, and
I think it would be unfair to take any
oth>-r basis than a normal one."
The brigade strength is thus figured by
1 the general: .First Brigade, 12 -companies
â¢â  of Infantry. 70 .men eacn, 840: Second Brl
i gado. 20 vompanl* :s of infantry, 70 men
| each, 140 ii; Third Brigade. 17 companies of
' infantry, 70 men each, 1190; 49 companies,
; 3430.
"Thus we have 3430 men. and we require
3296, as we have no batteries.
"Not to deal in fractions or odd num
bers, let us take from each brigade as
follows:
â  first Brigade. 8 companies. .
"Second Brigade, 14 companies; 9 com
panies from the ' First Infantry and- 5
â  companies from the Fifth Infantry.
I "'Third Brigade, 11 companies; 6 from
the Sixth Infantry and s.from. from the Second
Infaiitry.
â¢â¢Notify, each brigade- commander to
designate the companies up to the num
ber required. Find out how majiy in each
of the designated companies are willing
to volunteer. This gives the basis for a
start.' .
"Then let those in any company in the
brigade not in a designated company that
wish to volunteer, and were members on
llarcb ."1, be transferred to a designated
company until it has its full strength, and
if its full strength is not attained in this
way, then fill up with others who are on
the emergency or waiting list. In short.
give the members of the N.- G. C. the first
chance and to thp.se. who were members
on March 31 before the companies filled
up- on account of the war.
"Each df-sipnated company to report
with its present officers, or those of them
who desire to volunteer, for muster into
the United States service, and any men
rejected for disability of any kind" to be
replaced from the National Guard of Cali
fornia of their brigade or other volun
. "All company officers reporting to be
commissoned by the Governor, unless re
jected for physical disability or incompe
tency. Companies so designated to be re
placed by new companies to be mustered
in as the Governor may direct. All of the
above matters to be attended to without
charge of the State for services of-offi
cers, except a very few to' do the neces T
sary work."
â  .'"The above plan," says General Dick
inson, "maintains the integrity of the Na
tional Guard and gives equal representa
tion and fairness to all parts Qf the State.
The selection of companies ought to bo
made by seniority of captains and age
of .organization. The designated compa
nies should be' put in two regiments and
two battalions immediately prior to re
porting for muster.
"The artillery can come from companies
not designated for infantry. as a basis,. or
by enlistment within brigades, as already
fixed.
"Designated companies, if possible,
should be- met by the mustering officer,
say, at San Francisco, Stockton, Sacra
mento, Fresno and Los Angeles on days
when he can muster them, thus saving
expense of transportation, subsistence
and delay to men reporting for muster."
Colonel James Smith, First Infantry,
N. G. C.,. is an officer of experience and
ability. He is alert and ambitious, and at
the head of his regiment would doubtless
render gallant service in the Held. He has
addressed a letter to the commander-in
chief presenting a plan widely different
from the plan submitted by the major
general commanding the division. Colo
nel Smith's suggestion may not be prac
tical from a military point of view, but it
is readable. His views are thus given:
To the Governor of the State of California:
I have the honor once again to' tender for the
volunteer service of the United States the
First Infantry Regiment, its officers and en
listed men. In making this tender of the
sen-ices of the First Infantry Regiment we
wish it understood that, once mustered in as
a volunteer organization, it will go wherever
required or ordered, within or without the
United States.
Hermit me as commanding officer of the reg
iment, and â¢at the request of the whole or
ganization, to earnestly urge that the regi
ment bo taken in Its entirety. The organiza
tion is a perfect unit, no inharmonious ele
ments within â  it, and officers and men are
anxious that the regiment in \vhich they take
a pardonable pride shall be given an oppor
tunity to obtain distinction as such. The offi
cers have worked earnestly and faithlully to
bring it as near perfection as possible. The
reports of the ' inspect! .r detailed by the War
department and the reports of the brigade in
spector will show what earnest and faithful
work has been done in that direction.
The three battalion formation of four com
panies, each has met the distinct approval of
those most skilled in military science and is
supposed to be best adapted to the require
ments of modern warfare and the changes
required by Improvements in modern arms and
armament. Our regiment is organized on that
basis, as a result of a reorganization which it
has taken nearly two years to perfect, and
which was initiated by you and calmly,
thoughtfully and deliberately made. It seems
to us that it would be ill-advised to destroy
such an organization on the eve of active
service.
As eomman.!er-in-chlef and having been al
ways thoroughly in touch with the military
spirit pervading the National Guard of this
State, you will readily understand the pride
that all officers and men take in their or
ganizations, . and how much disappointment.
not to say dissatisfaction, would be created by
impairing, reducing, dividing or diminishing
them.
From the point of military efficiency I feel,
and I think you will agree with me, that mili
tary organizations should be preserved as near
as possible in their entirety. -Officers by con
stant association become acquainted with the
peculiarities, bent of mind, dispositions, tem
per, ability and bravery of their men. The
men, on the other hand, from the same asso
ciation, acquire confidence In their officers and
become devoted and loyal to them. The su
perior officers are made acquainted with the
character and disposition of subordinates and
almost unconsciously acquire a perfect knowl
edge of the capabilities and .adaptability of '
each.
Permit me. then, to suggest that regimental
organizations of the National Guard offered for
the volunteer service be preserved Intact, be
cause thereby the "esprit de corps" will be
preserved, dissatisfaction and disappointment
completely avoided and the best military effi
ciency maintained.
In .saying these things to you, my dear Gov
ernor, you will allow me to say that neither
myself nor the officers and men of the regi
ment are actuated by selfish motives, but sub
mit them to your calm and ripened Judgment
for consideration for the good of the service.
If in your wi?e judgment other regiments
would better serve the purpose intended than
the First Infantry take them as an entirety
as far as military efficiency will a!!.->w. An]
while we may be greatly disappointed if we
should not be selected, as one of the. organiza
tions to represent California, still we will
have the satisfaction of knowing that some
regimental organization as a- whole' has been j
put into .the field from the National Guard to
acquire distinction and a name for itself.
â¢I have the honor to most respectfully sub
mit to you the foregoing and to be and re
main your obedient servant. . .

MERCHANTS WANT PROTECTION.
The Business Men of San Francisco Offer to Raise a
â¢ Regiment.
Alive to the dangers to commerce on this coast and the Imperative
necessity of further protection from the Spanish, the trustees of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce and a number of prominent downtown
business men met in the rooms of the organization yesterday, and after
discussing the situation decided to send the following appeal to President
McKinley.: â¢ ' â 
"The President of the United States, Washington, D. C: Our entire
coast, with cur merchant marine, 20,000 tons of coal and one year's
canned provisions for 6000 men now at Alaskan ports and 16 â¢j0 tons of
provisions and outfits on the way thereto have no other protection than
three naval vessels and four small revenue cutters.
"There is a pressing necessity for further provision in the way of an
auxiliary sea-going navy composed of vessels _ of good sea-going qualities,
strong batteries and a good steaming radius.
"There are several immediately available, namely, the St. Paul, Sena
tor (new),' Queen and China.' The first two can be ready within thirty
days. The Queen and China are of larger caliber and greater speed.
"We respectfuny ask that you will urge on the Navy Department the
necessity of immediate action. . HUGH CRAIG,
"President Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco."
The following. resolution was unanimously adonted and was immedi
ately telegraphed to Senator George C. Perkins, with a request to lay it
before the Secretary Of the Navy and the California delegation and
strongly urge the need of such protection:
"Resolved, That the Secretary of the Navy be respectfully requested to
purchase and equip as auxiliary cruisers a sufficient number of fast
steamships and apply them to the protection of the United States com
merce of the Pacific."
President Hugh Craig broached the idea of raising two artillery regi
ments in this city to be stationed at the Presidio to man the high-power
guns that have been erected during the past year. He stated that owing
to the withdrawal of troops from the post this city was not amply pro
tected from attack by a Spanish fleet. Mr. Craig's suggestion that the
property owners of this city subscribe fifty thousand dollars for the sup
port of the regiments for thirty days, during which time they could be
taught to manipulate the great weapons of defense, was enthusiastically
adopted. It was decided to lay the proposition before Colonel Miller,
commander of harbor defenses, before proceeding with the raising of sub
scriptions.
As representative of the Government on this coast. Colonel Miller will
be asked how many soldiers he could use, what he could do with them
and whether the War Department would accept the regiments at the end
of thirty days and continue them in its employ or use them as a reserve
force. Until his answer is received the matter will rest.
That the. merchants of this city are patriotic and erenerous can be easily
9een by one instance. President Craig, in conversation with one of them,
spoke of the idea, and without any solicitation the merchant calmly
said, "Put me down for twenty-five hundred." Mr. Craig expects to
have no. difficulty in collecting the amount if soldiers are needed.
Major Edward Field, acting adjutant general of the department, thinks
that in thirty days the men could be taught to be useful at the high
power guns.. .
The following Interesting communication was telegraphed to Wash
ington by the Union Iron Works:

Men Who Would Rather
Be Dead Heroes Than
Live Cowards.
To a veteran of the civil war the scenes'
around the armory of the First Infantry
yesterday afternoon recalled the early
days of that memorable epoch in the his
tory of the I'nion when men, eager to
offer their services in defense of their
rights and for the preservation of their
homes, clustered about the headquarters
of the recruiting officer. .
Promptly at 2 o'clock Captain S. L.

branches of the military organizations of
the different States and in the United
States army and navy. Three are from
the Seventh Regiment of New York, one
from Montana and six are honorably dis
charged soldiers of the regular' army. The
other twenty-live are from the different
regiments of the National Guard and
semi-military organizations of California,

Figures Showing the Fight*
ing Strength of the
National Guard.
Governor Budd yesterday gave out tha
following tabulated statement, which has
been carefully prepared by his orders,
and which shows the exact fighting:
strength of the National Guard. That is,
it gives, up to date, the exact number of
men enlisted, the number who are mar
ried and the number who are unmarried,
and who can go to the front because they
can leave their families provided for.
The total number of men who should
not go, including those that are married,
is 263. which, deducted from 3651, the total
number enlisted, gives 3394 men ready for
immediate service. .

THE COIN OF PUGILISTS.
Sharkey and Jeffries Deposited
Money Yesterday With Jim
Chesley.
The managers of Sharkey and Jeffries met
yesterday afternoon and deposited $1000 each
with Jim Chesley as a guarantee that they
will enter the ring on the evening of May 6 In
good physical condition to fight a champion
ship battle.
The National Club also deposited $1000 as a
guarantee that it wl!l bring off the contest In
accordance with the articles of agreement.
Sharkey was very huffy over a published
statement said to have been made by Jeffries
to the effect that the sporting public will wit
ness a great mill provided that Sharkey will
stand his ground and not run under fire. The
fact of Jeffries having questioned the sailor's
qualities for sameness aroused the ire of
Sharkey, and yesterday .he was ready to fie-
at the drop of a hat.
"Jeffries had better look out for himself "
said Sharkey sharply, '"and unless I am
greatly mistaken it will be the man from Oak
land and not the man from Valie-jo who will
be on the run soon after the battle starts. I
don't want any man to question my eamen<-3s
above other things." "
Some bettinc is beins done In the pool
rooms, Crowley & Raggett have five thousand
dollars to be placed either way at even money
but it appears that Jeffries, owing to the big
handicap he will have in weight and height,
will finally end a slight favorite .
Me , xi S. an P ete left for his home in Crlppl*
Creek Tuesday evening. He said he did not get
a fair show, otherwise he would have whipped
his man. . -

first game under the new league's sched

The two leagues as they stand at present
will hold attention at the diamonds on
Saturday and Sunday and then they will
go out of existence. The schedule of
games that is to follow will be prepared
Monday night next. At the same time it
will be decided on which of the three
grounds in the city the games will be
played. The new league holds an option
on all three of the baseball parks until
then.

The managers of the teams of both
leagues have been suggesting to each
other for some time that the baseball
clubs of both organizations should for
the benefit of the sport be under one
management. All the managers were
agreeable to the scheme, but none of
them seemed willing to concede anything
to bring It about. Neither league baa
been a profitable venture as far as pe
cuniary, results were concerned, and as
the debts kepi Increasing tne louder was
the talk of consolidation. After many
wrangles a basis for amalgamating the
two clubs was formed and at the end of
a few heated meetings the Pacific Coast
League was effected, with all the choice
climbs of the two leagues selected to form
the schedule of the new organization.
BASEBALL NEWS
AND COMMENT
BY JOE CORBETT.
"Josh" Rilcy will not go East this sea
son, preferring to take his chances with
the Central Park League.
It Is said that "Blocker" Hanlry is phy
a bone 'twlxt tho elbow and the shoulder,
which account! for his poor throwing.
Krug aspires to become a National
Leaguer. Not a bad Idea, Henry.
"Youngus" Johnson Is .still having his
troubles with the Eastern magnates, and
Kays that if they don't come to his terms
pretty soon he will sign with Manager
Crowley's aggregation. With Johnson
and TUley the San Franciscos will have a
very strong team.
Creamer says that umpires have not
enough authority, and In consequence
their life is made miserable. It would be
much better for the game out here if a
rule was made enabling umpires to put
players out of a game. . If such a rule
does exist it should be enforced., as too
much kicking very often spoils a game.
Entirely too much time is lost by teams
between innings. Ginger up a bitâ it looks
nice. ' â¢ i
Any ball player who cannot afford a
pair 'of shoes with "spikes" should be
suspended. How they ; ever expect to
play good ball with tennis shoes on is a
mystery.- . â¢ . ;.
Monahan, the crack third baseman. of
the San Franciscos, is thinking very
seriously of accepting one of the 'many
liberal offers made him by Eastern
clubs. This star player would undoubted
ly hold up the enviable achievements of
former Calif ornians. but as good players
are in demand out here as well as in the
East, it is to be hoped he remains with
us.
-lanager Coffroth says that In two
weeks he will have the fastest team in
the State. Wake up. Jim.
Russell of the White House team would
make a valuable ucciuisitlon to any of
the league clubs. He is a good pitcher
and should be given a chance.
Hughes, the young Native Son who re
cently joined the Bakimores, is making
a wonderful record for himself with that
club. His shutting out of the great Bos
t"ii team without a. run or a hit places
him in a class by himself. Many people
are inclined to believe that the support
accorded him by the Baltimore* was re
sponsible for his great record. Such a
supposition is without grounds. There is
no doubt but what he was accorded excel
lent support, yet if he were not a good
pitcher all the league clubs combined
Could not have prevented that hard-hit
ting Boston team from funking at least
one base hit.
Eastern writers, commenting on his
work, state that his pitching is simply
marvelous and his batting all that could
be desired. The most wonderful part of
this man's work lies in the fact that he
entered the National League without the
almost necessary minor league experi
ence. He opened up against the Bostons
without knowing their weaknesses at bat,
which fact gives to California, the repu
tation of producing the only real
"phenom."
There will be joy and fireworks among
the "rooters" when they learn that, at
last, and after much wrangling, the two
leagues have consolidated. It will be
most gratifying ;,, Eastern players now
on the coast to know that the "National
protection" is to be dropped, by the new
league.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 1898.
MORE GLORY
FOR OLINTHUS
Finished First in the Cor
rigan Stake Decided
at Ingleside. .
/
Sombre, the Hot Favorite, Fin
ished Outside of the
. Money.
Buoltwa Cantered in Winnerâ First
Choices Fell Heir to Four
Purses.
OHnthus, the handsome chestnut brother
to Diggs, more than turned the tables on
Sombre at Ingleside yesterday. On March
24 the black daughter of the one-time
queen of the turf. Miss Woodford, downed
Olinthus half a length for the Androus
stake. On that occasion the latter re
ceived a shabby ride. Since that time
Olinthus has shaken his country coat and
gait, and now looks the aristocrat all
over. His steady improvement appar
ently escaped the majority, for in the bet
ting on the Corrlgan stake at five fur
longs Sombre was chalked up a 6 to 5 fa
vorite, and the bookies were almost
swamped with the coin offered. At post
4 to 6 was very scarce. Olinthus, carry
ing 123, two pounds more than the choice,
opened at twos, but the supply was
greater than the demand, and his odds
drifted to 4 to 1. The other starters had
shown no class.
At the start Excursion was first to
break and went sifting away in the lead,
Sombre at his heels and Olinthus plod
ding along, in third position. Well into the
stretch Sombre was all out and fell back.
Shields shook Olinthus up and gradually
taking the lead won cleverly from the
fast coming Milt Young in 1:023;. Excur
sion hung on gamely, only giving up the
place in a head linish.
A strong wind blew over the course,
which prevented any fast time being
made. It was a rosy day for favorites,
four out of six securing purses.
The opening event at six furlongs was
taken by Rosormonde which, with San
Antonio, held sway in the betting.
"Skeets" Martin rode N'aglee Burkes
mare. and. In front most of the way. led
San Antonio out by over a length in l:lsVj.
In tin 1 seven-furlong selling affair next
decided the 3 to 2 favorite San Mateo
found the route too far. and after making |
all the pace was beaten out the last few j
strides by Lena, the second choice, pi- |
loted by Piggott. Woods landed . Miss
Ross in" the show at odds of 30 to 1.
A cheap slx-furlong run followed, and
Twinkle Twink, the favorite, with Gouin
in the saddle; won and that was all. Zar
ro, ridden by Gus Wilson, struck the
stretch with a commanding lead, when
liis rider grew gay, and Gouin brought the
favorite along in time to get the decision
by a nose. Zaraida was third.
'The mile and a sixteenth looked a gift
for Buckwa. and such it proved. The
ring laid the long price of 9 to l*> about
him and all Clayton had to do was to sit
still and hold his head up. Four lengths
back as the wire was passed Thelma beat
San Marco a nerk for the place.
Bernardillo had nothing to beat in the
lasl event, and at odds of 3 to 5 galloped
in the easiest kind (if a winner. In a hard
drive the 100 to 1 shot Walter J took the
place from Summertime.
TRACK NOTES.
The stewards of the California Jockey Club
will meet this forenoon at 10 o'clock at the of
fice of the club, when thp case of the sus
pended rider, Eddie Jones, will be given a re-
hearing. ,
K'l Corrigan has protested the -claiming or
Chihuahua by Tom Cooke 'on the ground that
the latter was acting as agent for pome one
who kept in the background. The matter will
receive an airing to-day.
Soscol appears to be very much of an in
and outer. Hia showing in the opening event
was a very rank one with "Pepsin" Claw son'
in the saddle.
MJmtw Marine* ran third in the first race at
odds of KXJ to 1. He has plenty of speed and
Will do to keep an eye on.
Zatnar had speed to burn until the stretch
was reached, and there he cashed In. Honig's
gelding receded in the betting.
There wen; hard luck stories without number
at the conclusion of the Twinkle Twink-Zarro
finish. Had Ous Wilson on the latter gone
on about his business in the run name instead
of turning in the saddle to see how far be
hind the field was. the bla< k horse would have
won. It is a ' habit that has lost many a
puiac.
OllnthuÃ has won over $4000 In ptakÂ»Â»s and
purses glnce Galen Brown first showed him up
at Ingles-kle track back In January.
On Tuesday evening at a down town hotel.
"Skeets" Martin wagered a new hat with
Starter J. B. Ferguson that he (Martin) would
land Master Lee inside the money in the two
year-old stake yesterday. "Skeets" put up a
good ride on the youngster, but lost the hat.
Paul Pry must have experienced one of his
old time sulky turns, for he was last from
start to finish.
Pleasanton, a 25 to 1 shot, with a stable boy
on his back, thoroughly enjoyed himself at the
post In the last run. He first gave Summer
time a resounding kick on one of her hind legs
and then plastered one on Cabrlllo's knee, cut
ting a gash that bled profusely. The latter
was heavily played both for the place and
show, and It seems as though bets on the
horse should have been declared on*. When
Captain Rees presided In the stand at Ingle
side he invariably offered bettors this protec
tion, a Turf Congress rule permitting of the
ruling. â 
Young Mclntyre, quite a promising boy In
the saddle, left for tho East last evening. He
signed to ride for Billy Magrane. â¢

The advertisement canvasser for a St. Louis daily paper says of
Ripans Tabules: "Ever since I can remember I have been troubled
with constipation in its severest form. So acute, in fact, at times, as
to produce dreadful headaches that, notwithstanding all the outdoor
work afforded me by my vocation, and the latitude it allowed me to
test my pedestrian abilities â which is supposed to be a successful
manner of displacing constipation â I was very often compelled to
forego my pursuit of 'business.' Constipation with me seemed to
be hereditary rather than due to accidental causes, therefore much
harder to relieve. In my extremity I often resorted to most drastic
measures, but found no cure to be permanent. In 1892, while con-
nected with the Times of El Paso, Tex., Ripans Tabules were brought
to my notice, and I used them with marked success. Nowadays I
never suffer from such severe cases of constipation, and the violent
headaches I formerly experienced never worry me in the least. Some-
times, though, when I allow myself to lapse for a period into irreg-
ular habits, I become slightly constipated, but by taking the Tabules
according to directions, my bowels again perform their functions in a
highly pleasing manner."

Isobars, or solid lines, connect potnts of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and 13 usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to iow pres
sure and Is usually preceded and .accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usuaily
firs', appear on t v .e Washington ?oast. When
the pressure Is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
Br.j F'->uth along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with iso K ars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "high" In the vic:nity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In Fummer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will croduc* id

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 27.â T0-day's stock mar
ket was almost entirely without tone. The
total transactions were not , greatly In excess
of the smallest day's business in the history of
the exchange, the aggregate of sales footing
up only SI, COO shares. The market drifted aim
lessly over a very ..narrow range. Such usually
volatile specialties as Sugar and Metropolitan
Street Railway covered a range of less than
% during the whole day. A large number of
stocks which almost always figure In the day's
trading have not a single Bale recorded for
them. A few stocks moved quite widely on
account of special causes, but the volume of
business, even with these, was small. Cana
dian and Northern Pacific stocks moved up
ward together from the same cause, namely,
rumors which are prevalent in London that the
Northwestern rate war Is about to be settled.
Canadian Pacific net gain Is 2% and Northern
Pacific a point. The strength of these stocks
really gave the tone to the whole market, lift
ing it above last night's close, which it re
tained to the end. General Electric showed
strength from the showing made by Its annual
statement. Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf
recovered 2'Â« of yesterday's loss, which was
Bald to be due to apprehension that its ter
minal port on the gulf would be closed by the
war. - Hawaiian Commercial recovered, four
points of its 'recent loss, which were said to
be due to apprehension that its stocks of sugar
In transit were liable to capture. ; Arbitrage
dealers sold most of, the international stocks,
but bought Northern " Pacific. Their 'transac
tions,-however, were insignificant.- . The I dull
ness In stocks is no doubt due In part to the
transfer of speculative Interest to the wheat
market. : ..... ....
Conditions in the money market seemed 'to
be working to an. easier basis. Call loans at
the banks, which hold out for 4 per cent, are
being repaid, as money can be had for less
than that In the street, and time loans are said
to be made at a shade below 6 per cent, which
has been firmly held for some time. The de
mand for funds from the interior continued,
but Is not as large as earlier in the week. The
ripe In exchange checked the rate for demand
sterling, holding steady at about $4 84%.
The bond market was intensely dull In sym
pathy with stocks, and prices were held about'
steady. Total sales, $900,000.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 27.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet but better today on
the combined Inflow of gold and easier money.
Tht tettlement was a small affair, except in
West Australian mines and . was easily ar-
ranged. Contangoes were comparatively light,
the rate In Spanish 4s being about 1 per cent,
which Is Indicative of a short supply.
Contangoes on Americans were 4% to 6 per j
cent, but on New York Centrals the rate was
even down to 2 and on Louisville and Nash
ville from 2 to 3 per cent.
- A feature in the market to-day was the sharp
rise In Canadian Pacifies on Montreal buying, j
Americans closed at about the best, with a j
very small speculative inquiry here. Kaffirs j
were better on the reported reduction of the
dynamite rates in the Transvaal. The dif
ficulties in the West Australian market have
not yet been settled. Another failure was an
nounced to-day. 1 am Informed on excellent
authority that as a result of the j Bank of
England's policy, as recently told In these
dispatches,- In making advances of free In
terest,- Â£1,500.000 in gold has been already re
ceived, the remainder being expected In the
next ' few days. To-day's receipts of bar gold
at. the bank is the first for two ~ years past.
The London discount market would be easier
but for the fact that on May 7 more than Â£12.
000,000 of the Chinese Indemnity money to be
paid Japan, will, with the exception of Â£1,000,

Germany, all so to Japan's account at the

London market and Increasing the bank's

NEW YORK WHEAT MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 27.â After a season of dis-
couragements early In the session, wheat bulls
attacked the market on all sides to-day, forc
ing shorts in vigorous action, which wiped
out all the early decline and left official clos
ing prices â¢%'irlc higher than last night. The
greatest excltnmen-t of the day, however, was
brought out in curb trading, when July sold
up Co $1 03V4 on a continuation of the active
covering, which marked the last hour's trad
ing. Heavy liquidation formed a part of the
morning's business, thus relieving the market
of a considerable burden and making it ex
tremely sensitive In the late afternoon to the
bullish demonstrations. Exports were' fairly
large and an advance was reported In freight
rates. The remarkable strength In foreign
markets to-day in face of yesterday's late
.weakness on this side, was a bit? surprise to
all traders, indicating either a big corner !n
near-by deliveries, particularly In Liverpool
and Antwerp, or a continued scare over light
supplies. July sold from 99c to $1 01 T 4. closing
officially at $1 01H- May ranged from $1 1G" 2
to $1 22!4. closing officially at $1 22.
The last curb price on July was %c over the
best previous figures for the year.
CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 27.â The foreign wheat mar
kets, which were â¢controlling influences ai the
opening here to-day, showed a deal of irregu
larity. Liverpool quoted declines of %!g2d,
while Paris came 2%Â®3c higher. The extereme
ly favorable crop bulletins had a bearish tenor.
Trading began at a decline of 14c in July
wheat. For half an hour the :nark?t actod
strong and rallied twice to yesterdays clom\
but at the end of the. time mentioned an ava
lanche of offerings struck the >lt and prices
dropped with a thud from 93Hc to 91>4c. Not
niUMh account was taken of the statistics per
tali'.lng to the dally movement of wheat, but
iru' favorable weather for growing winter
wheat wns in the minds of people who sold
whoat short i-arly In the session. Chicago re
ceipts were 109 cars, and 72 of them were con
tract. Receipts here a year ago were
thirteen Â«ars. Minneapolis and Duluth
received 327 cars, against 207 a year
ago. The clearance of wheat and flour
from Atlantic ports were equal to 497,000 bush
els. Closing quotations from Liverpool showed

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, April 27.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
wool market:
Transactions In the wool market were al
ready too greatly curtailed to be much further
affected by the outbreak of war. The sales of
the last week foot up something over half a
million pounds, which is about the average
since the war scare entered Its acute stage
several weeks ago. Conditions have not Im
proved since our last report. There have been
practically no manufacturers In the market.
The feeling on part of the holders of wool
Is phenomenally strong. Nothing but the con
dition of the money market seems likely to un
settle prices in the near future.
The mills are buying only such wool as they
actually need to piece out with.
The sales of the week amount to 297,000
pounds domestic and 216,000 pounds foreign,
making a total of f.33,000 pounds, against a
total of 1,151.000 pounds for the previous week
and a total of 6,113,000 for the corresponding
week last year.

NOW CALL IT
A HUGE JOKE
Dr. Woolsey Never Had
Any Idea of Law-
suits.
And Dr. Dunn Was Also
Working Off a Little
Pleasantry.
ThÂ» Seriousness With Which They
Ran Up Attorneys' Fees Was
Well Feigned.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, April 27.
Drs. Woolsey and Dunn have buried the
hatchet. For over three weeks each has
been digging a hole large enough to con
tain his enemyj But now the holes are
filled in and the little hatchet that threat
ened such dire things is far enough below
the ground to be out of sight.
When these two friends, who have been !
partners and companions for years,
rushed Into lawyers' offices and threat
ened all kinds of suits because of a
difference in their calculations regarding
the lease of the property where they do
business it was freely predicted that they
would never come to blows. Everybody
told them that they were pointing blank
cartrid/es at each other. Dr. Woolsey
swore nis gun was loaded and would go
off, and Health Officer Dunn made tne
6ame statement.
Now all the attorneys in the caseâ and
they are manyâ have had a conference, I
in fact, have had several conferences, and
to-day all prospects of suits have van
ished, and this evening it was reported
that the two doctors ate dinner together
at the expense of Dr. Woolsey.
The most peculiar part of the incident
is the statement now made by the doctors
that it was all a joke. If such be true,
it is certainly the most impractical Joke
that was ever played in Oakland. Of
course, when Dr. Woolsey consulted sev
eral attorneys and Dr. Dunn did the same
everybody knew they were joking:. No
doubt the joke has cost them a pretty
penny, but no one can doubt their word,
and although they did not speak as they
passed by for perhaps nearly a monthâ
that is to say, they did not speak in i
dulcet tonesâ still it was all a joke, for i
the doctors themselves say so, and no
as a right to challenge their integ
rity.
At the same time, there are scores of at
torneys in Oakland who would like noth
ing better than to see all the professional
men of the town go to joking in a similar
manner. ____________ !
JUSTICE ADMINISTERED.
But Judge Ellsworth Shows Mercy to
A. J. Luckhardt, an Invalid.
OAKLAND. April 27.â A. J. Luckhardt.
the consumptive prisoner wno confessed
to stealing cameras from the store of
Travers & Leet, was sentenced to ten
days in Pan Quentin this mornit" r and
sent across the bay to-night. He will be
allowed two days' credits for good be
havior, which will cause his release on
Thursday of next week.
The case was called in Judge Ells
worth's court on request of the defend
ant's attorney and the date for sentence
vacated. Drs. A. M. Lrison and C. J.
Sharp testified that the prisoner had con
sumtinn verging- closely on the last stage.
This morning he fell in a faint.
"This is the mnst painful duty, I
think. " said Judge Ellsworth after a few
moments' meditation. "I have ever had
to der.l with. It again illustrates what
often happens, in punishing the guilty a
man's family is. punished more than he
is. Your excuse offered for the crime is
that you suffered from hunger: not only
yourself, but your famiiiy. your little
ones, were suff-Tinfr. Whether that is
true, whether that is the real reason for
committing the crime, it cannot certainly
be known, but I shall give you the benefit
of the doubt.
"Because you were too proud to apply

who is to open at the Baldwin on May 9, in a tragic pantomime with Piiar
Morin. was treated by an audience at Providence, R. 1., on Monday night.
Charles L. Young, who is out here ahead of the company, received the fol
lowing telegram yesterday, which is so clear that It practically explains the
whole affair.
"PROVIDENCE. April 23. 1886.
"Charles I>. Young. San Franciso: Enthusiastic audience Providence
last night hissed Spanish pianist Sarbreno severely and called for another.
I.achaume, being in. the city, was secured. Ysaye appeared with an Ameri
can flag and the audience went wild. lIIRSCH."
So strong has the feeling became against everything Spanish that the
management has been forced to cancel Sarbreno's engagement and substi
tute Lachaumo in his place. Sarbreno is probably one of the finest pianists
at present in America, but he is so well known that it is useless to try to
hide his nationality, and consequently the people having charge of the pan
tomime have been obliged to let him go, as they say that under the present
conditions it would ruin their production to keep him with them.
The piece will lose nothing by the change, however, as Lachaume is
fully the equal of the Spaniard on Â».he piano, and is moreover, one of the
most popular men, personally, in the business.
for aid it Is not right that you should
Ftoal. There is :io excuse left for me but
to pronounce judgment. I feel that send
ing you to the State prison is enough dis
grace- to you and your family, so I shall
make the term very short. I- may err in
doing so, but It "will be on thÂ£ side of

you be confined in the State prison at San
Quentin for ten days."
The prisoner thanked the Judge for his
leniency, while his wife drew a sigh of
relief as the judgment was finished.
MUST GO TO TRIAL.
Technical Objections Swept Away by
the Court in the Thomas Case.
OAKLAND, April 27.â Judge Ellsworth
refused the attorneys for Harry Thomas,
the secretary of the Board of Public
Works, a week's time to rile a demurrer
j to-day and ordered them to have It In by
| Friday at 10 a. m.. or it would be passed.
! The attorneys first challenged the panel
i of the Grand Jury under section 895 of
the Code and moved to set aside the in
dictment under sectio.n ft*s.
The challenge charges "that the requi
site number of ballots was not drawn
from the jury box of the county; that no
tice of the drawing of the Grand Jury
was not given; that the drawing was not
had In the presence of the officers desig
nated by law." '
The motion to set aside the Indictment
was made "on the ground that the same
was not found, indorsed or presented as
proscribed by the Penal Code, and ob
jects to the "legality thereof because the
1 body which found the saint 1 was not le
gally drawn, ordered or arranged accord
ing to law, for the reason that the said
body was not drawn or ordered or im

THE LITTLE ONE

A Schoolgirl's Friends Given
a Surprise, Which Is
Returned.
Mr. and Mrs. â  Frates Are Serenaded
by Boys Who Are Girls in
Disguise.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, :
908 Broadway, April 27.
About a dozen boys, who were not boys
at all, but boys' sisters in their brothers' !
clothes, made a sensation In Haywards
last night by serenading Mr. and Mrs.
Frates. . .
Mrs. Frates, whom everybody thought
till yesterday was Miss Louise Silva, is a
schoolgirl in the fifth grade, generally
supposed to be about 12 years of age. Yes
terday afternoon her mother astonished
the neighbors by announcing that last
Thanksgiving day her little daughter had
been married to Manuel Frates, who is
of the mature age of 3S. No sooner had
the news been made public than the
young folks decided to emphasize the
occasion. About a dozen girls dressed in
boys' clothes and carrying with them tin
cans and similar instruments went at
midnight to the home of the bride and
groom and favored them with a long and
noisy serenade. When the serenaders
saw that their presence was not agree
able to Mr. Prates and that serious con
sequences might follow they returned to
their homes.
This morning Mr. Frates is 1 in arms. He
feels he has been badly treated and he is
searching the town tor some of the
"boys"' who visited his house at mid
night. No one has yet taken him into the !
secret.
All the bride's friends are wondering
how they could be so deceived as to her
age, as it is well known that the neces
sary consent of her mother could not be
given unless Marie was 14. '-.â  â¢ â¢:<

LOST ON HIS
HOMEWARD TOOK
Jacob Goodsell Traced
From Mexico to Los
Angeles.
The Pretty Actress Asks the
Police to Search for Her
Father.
For. Two Months and a Half the
Search for Him Has Been Void
of Result.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 27.
Virginia Goodsell, the well-known ac
tress, appealed to the police to-day to
assist her in finding her aged father, who
has been missing since February 12.
The missing man went to Mexico some
months ago and was returning home
when he dropped out of sight. He has
been engaged in mining ventures and has
spent altogether several years in Mexico.
It is known that he was as far as Los
Angeles on his journey home, as a train
conductor has been discovered who
Checked him out of that city.
About three months ago Jacob Goodsell
wrote home that he had sustained a
stroke of paralysis and it had left
permanent results. Since leaving Los An
geles on February 12 not a trace of him
can be found.
Manager J. A. Fillmore of the railroad
company has caused very thorough
searches to be made, but without result,
and now the police authorities have been
asked to take up the search.
Mr. Goodsell is 63 years of age, has gray
hair and mustache, no beard, rather a
prominent nose and forehead, and speaks
with a slight German accent. He Is of
medium height and build and walks with
a slight stoop. His family has resided
for several years at 526 Telegraph ave
nue, and Miss Virginia, whx> has just re
turned from a professional tour, has de
cided to remain home until her father is
found or until she is satisfied of what be
came of him after leaving Los Angeles.
LOST COIN FOR
THE CITY'S GOOD
Seven Thousand Dollars Annu
ally Saved the Tax
payers.
The Garbage Crematory Now a
Monument to Good In
tentions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 27.
After losing $10,000 in trying to establish
a garbage crematory in this city the pro
moters now find themselves incapable of
operating under the franchise granting
them exclusive rights, and practically
they have no redress.
The derision of Judge Allen has de
stroyed the legality of the ordinance
granting the franchise, and the situation
I is interesting, showing, as it does, that
i the. competition between the scavengers
j and the franchise company had saved and
; is saving $600 per month to the city. Since
i last August the crematory has been shut
, down, although it has not thereby for
' feited its franchise under the terms of
the ordinance. The ordinance gives the
i company the exclusive right to gather
j garbage within the city of Oakland and
I in another section it authorizes house
holders or their proper agents to remove
the garbage from their own premises.
After the scavengers were arrested they
at once secured contracts from their cus
tomers and under this clause the court
held that the scavengers were justified In
collecting garbage.
When the practice of dumping of
garbage within the city limits was
stopped by the Board of Health about
two years ago, it was made compul
sory that all the garbage be either de
stroyed or carried five miles beyond the
city limits. For a long time the city of
Oakland provided railroad transportation
at a cost of $600 per month to carry the
garbage which was delivered to them by
the scavengers into Contra Costa Coun- '
ty, where it was dumped. When the ere-,
matory people came along this expense"
to the city was stopped, and the individ
ual scavengers who refused to patronize
the crematory chartered cars on their
own account and did and are still doing
that which cost the city such a large
sum.
The situation now is rather complicated,
though economical, so far as the city is
concerned. The crematory is idle, its
property and franchise attached by the
creditors, the scavengers are collecting
garbage as in the past and are conveying
it seven miles outside the city limits, "and
the ordinance granting the franchise is
practically void.
The inventor of the crematory, Louis
Shaffer, and the leading promoter. Re
corder Spear, entered into the project in
good faith, and have rendered the city a
material benefit, but at the same time
have been heavy personal losers. It would
seem now that unless a new ordinance is
passed their investment cannot be made
profitable, and it is a doubtful question if
the old ordinance can be amended so as
to protect the exclusiveness of the priv
ilege without trespassing on the validity
of the privilege itself.

DESERTEL THE INSTRUCTOR.
University Students Object to Being
Treated "as Kindergarten
Pupils."
BERKELEY, April 27.â Several scores
of students in physics at the university
are indignant at the treatment accorded
them to-day by one of their instructors,
A. \Y. .Gray, an assistant in the depart
ment of physics. The students went to
the physics lecture room to take the ex
amination which had been prepared for
them by Professor Lewis, who gives the
course Professor Lewis is away visiting
schools and had left Assistant Gray to
give the examination.
When Gray met the class this morning
he announced that the examination would
not be given then until there was abso
lute silence in the room. Absolute silence
did not prevail for a quarter of an hour,
at the end of which time nearly all of the
class indignantly left the room. They
went to Assistant Professor Raymond,
who is acting head of the department in
the absence of Professor Slate, and
angrily protested against Gray's treat
ment of them "as kindergarten pupils."
Professor Raymond promised to give
them their examination next Friday
morning. The students are very much
Incensed at Gray's action, which they
characterize as a capricious attempt to
exercise authority and an insult to them
as^ university students.

Deliger.
Rev. Dr. McLtan Speaks of the Value
of Progressive Men to a
Community.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 27.
'I am able in my own mental rec
ord to accord Mr. Delger a good
place among the benefactors of our
city. There are different kinds of
benefactors and benefactions. One
kind of benefactor is to be found In
the man possessed of great material
wealth in a community, and of that
kind was Mr. Delger, who lived a
life of Influence among us here In
Oakland.
"It is a good thing to be able to
contribute among the sorrowing,
the helpless and the orphan,
but Is it not a good thing
to make it possible that othera
shall not enter the ranks of the suf
fering? To relieve the suffering is
a great and beneficent thing, but
to prevent suffering is even a
greater thing, to my mind.
"Among this kind of benefactors
I would rate Mr. Delger.- For more
than thlrty-aeven years has Mr.
Delger been here and been such a
contributor to this fair city of Oak
land.
"Thirty-seven years in Oakland.
That covers mostly all of its his
tory. It covers the lifetime of a
generation. During those years,
the entire population of the place '
has changed more than twice. In
INSI, when Mr. Delger first came
here, there were only 1500 inhabi
tants in Oakland and"Berkeley, and
the center of business was Fourth
street and Broadway. He has seen
the school system rise from obscur
ity to be one of the best in the
United States; has seen the develop
ment of banks, of institutions of
charity and churches and all things
that make a fair city.
"And now it is said of him that
he was the largest individual owner
of improved real estate. That man
man in righteous ways accumulates
largely of material wealth is of
more importance in the beginning
of a small city than almost any
other factor. He is the man who
puts up substantial improvements,
and their taxation contributes di
rectly to every good thing in that
city.
"I say it Is money just as well
spent as money contributed to
benevolence. Such a thing makes
possible the safety of the city, for
the safety of person and property
comes through taxation. The ex
ample of such a man in the com
munity is worth much, and to Mr.
Deiger the citizens of Oakland owe
a debt of gratitude.
Such were the words of the venerable
J. K. McLean, D.D., as he stood at the
head of the bier of the late Frederick
Deiger in the First Congregational Church
this afternoon. Around the casket, in
full regalia, was Live Oak Lodge, of
which the deceased tfiis a member, and a
large number of visiting brethren from
all the lodges around the Day. Ihe church
was tilled with prominent citizens and
friends who had been acquainted with the
deceased for years. Members of the
household bore the casket to the hearse,
and the honorary pall-bearers were: Wil
liam K. Davis, W. Frank Pierce, Wallace
Evcrson J. Everding, F. K. Shattuek,
11. C. Taft. C. H. Smith, H. A. Powell,
Thomas Crelin, E. C. Sts-sions, Victor 11.
Metcalf and William Rutherford.
Many ladies of the Fabiola Association
attended as a delegation from the insti
tution toward which the deceased had
been so generous.
At the Deiger vault in Mountain View
Cemetery Live Oak Lodge conducted the
ceremonies. The lodge was in charge of
Master George H. Smith, Senior Warden
J. C. Dunne, Junior Warden T. F. ivlock,
Deacons John A. Britton and G. T. Burt
chaell. Stewards J. S. Corrigan and Ed
Pierce. Marshal D. W. Standeford and
Tyler D. H. Mathiesen.
CHRISTIAN CHURCH TROUBLE.
ALAMEDA, April 27.â The friends of
Rev. Mr. Wickham, the pastor of the
Christian Church in this rity, which has
been split by dissension, are very averse !
to any publicity with regard to the mat- I
ter and the reverend gentleman himsolf
says that it is one of those things which
are best settled without the newspapers.
S It is now stated that the entire trouble
is over the payment of the minister's sal
ary. The church is a poor and struggling j
organization, without any wealthy mem- I
bers, as stated. It is so poor that it has
not yet been able to have its building
painted, though completed more thau a
year ago.
There are only about sixty members of
the church all told, and of these about '
forty havo decided, so it is said, to abide !
by Rev. Mr. Wickham, and will worship
In Holtz's Hall, at the West End. The r.
mainder will continue to occupy the J
church, and Rev. Dr. S. M. Jefferson of j
Berkeley will supply the pulpit until some |
definite and permanent arrangement is
There is a debt of about $1900 on the
church, and how to meet this will tax the
efforts of the remainder of the congrega
tion most severely. Mr. Wickham prom- j
ises at the proper time and before the !
proper church tribunal to make such a â¢
showing as shall confound his opponents j
and put them to shame.

that on August 4, 1597. in latitude north

The Pacific Athletic As-

Saturday.

Have EnieredTheir
Names.
The Complets List ol Entries and the
No tible Events to Ti^ke
Place.
For the first time since the spring of
1892 the Pacific Amateur Athletic Asso
ciation will hold championship games
worthy of the name. It was the old
Olympic Club which kept alive the spirit
of athleticism, and in the former associa
tion meets the contest for supremacy
was fought out between the Olympic
Club and the University of California.
Then came the advent of Stanford, which
practically changed the whole order of
things. Intercollegiate field days rang
the death knell on general championship
games, the Olympic Club men, bowing to
their collegiate superiors on the track,
drew out of the race and the association
as a fosterer of athletics eank into des
uetude.
On Saturday at the Olympic Club
grounds the field and track contests will
be between three institutionsâ the Uni
versity of California, Stanford and the
Amateur Athletic .League. Over 100 en
tries swell the programme of events. The
games will be noteworthy for several rea
sons, the two colleges will again cross
swords and there will also be a pitting of
the college athlete against his younger
brother in the preparatory schools. Many
of these embryo athletes have won lau
rels on the track and field with records
to their credit equal to, if not surpassing,
those of the sprinter more advanced in
years and didactic qualifications. Sev
eral of the High School students are
looking with covetous eyes to the prizes
offered, and they are of the opinion that
the colors of Stanford and California will
be lowered in more than one instance.
The field day should be exceptionally
interesting and the races exciting not
only for those entered but for the specta
tors as well. It is very likely that the
Olympic outdoor grounds will be taxed
to "their full capacity on Saturday, for the
high schools will turn out in a body.

TRACK ATHLETES
WILL GO NORTH
Proposed Eastern Trip of the
Berkeley Team to Be
Postponed.
"Can Win the Mott Haven Games
Three Years Hence," Predicts
Manager Brown.
BERKELEY. April 27.â The victorious
track athletic team of the University of
California, which defeated Stanford last
Saturday by a score of SS to 38, will go
north soon after the completion of the ;
college examinations to compete with the j
Multnomah Athletic Club of Portland and
the Seattle Athletic Club. Enough money
has been guaranteed by Portland and |
Seattle to more than cover the expenses j
of the trip. The first contest will be
against the Multnomah Club on May 30.
The Portland club has a strong team. In
cluding Morgan. Stanford's crack hurdler,
and Kerrigan, the phenomenal high jump
er of the northwest, but the. Berkeley ath
letes are confident of defeating them. If
a large enough number of students can
be secured, an attempt will be made to
organize a party to accompany the team
north.
The proposition to take the team east,
as was done in 1895, has been practically
abandoned. Track Captain Brown be- I
lieves that the athletes can afford to wait !
for a few years until they can go east
better equipped financially.
"To enter half a dozen meets," he de
clared, "as the '95 team had to do to
make expenses, would result in killing the
men as athletes. Athletics at Berkeley are
steadily improving, and if the improve- ;
ment continues, in three or four years
the University of California will have a
track team that will win the great Mott '
Haven games."

DIRECTOR
GALLAGHER
LET 'ER GO
Makes a Bitter Attack
Upon a Grand
Juror.
Refers to Alexander Tru
man as a Falsifier and
a Blackguard.
Vents His Spleen Over the Dis
ci osures Made in the Lum
ber Deal.
TWO TEACHERS DROPPED.
Fornucl Offer Made by the Board, of
Education to Assist the Grand
Jury in Its Work.
Under the guise of introducing a reso
lution in the Interest of reform In the
School Department, School Director
lagher vented his spleen yesterday against
Alexander Truman, one of the m<
of the (rand Jury who rave been activ*
In bringing t>> the attention of the puuiiu
tho scandals connected â¢with the purchase
of lumber f<T the department.
yie waited until the regular business of
the Board of Education had been com
jilf-ted. Then be rose, and with the full
rr.;nht of his voice delivered himself as
follows:
"I hear that a groat deal of responsi
bility is being thrown op the shoulders
of the finance committee for the alleged
frauds that have b< en perpetrated in con
n with the purchase of lumber fur
this department. While I don't deny any
responsibility for any "t" nay acts, I feel
that the finance committee, of which 1
am chairman, performs its duty in a com
pulsory manner. The custom has been
Buch in the past that the committee has
no discretion in the matter of passing
upon bills presented to it for approval,
though the rules give the committee a
power which It does not exercise. In or
der to remedy this, I offer the folowlng
resolution.' He read the resolution, which
is us follows:
Resolved, That the finance committee be in
cre&aed to five members.
That no committee shall Incur any .expense
against the department, except on a requisi
tion duly signed, as provided lor In the rules
of the .Board of Education, and all. requisi
tions calling for an expenditure of $50 or m ire
ehall be tirst submitted to and receive the ap
proval of the chairman of the finance com
mittee.
That under the rules of the Board of â  Edu
cation the finance committee shall adopt such
regulations as it may deem necessary for the
economical disbursement of the school funds,
and no money shall be expended or work per
formed except In accordance with such regu
lations.
That the finance committee shall exercise
general supervision over the books and ac
counts of the department and- bee that the
tame are kept in a businesslike manner, and
for this purpose they may adopt such measures
as they may deem necessary. - ; 'i -
Speaking ostensibly for the adoption of
the resolution, he continued: â 
"We may be morally but we are not
legally responsible for these matters. I
don't believe the charges are. true, be
cause they are made by one of the rank
est blackguards in this city, because they
are made by a member of the Grand Jury
â¢who has resorted to the dirtiest, lowest
and most contemptible methods. I know
that on several occasions he has lied
about members of the board relative to
things they have done. 1 feel safe in
saying that the things he Is ram sing to be
publishd in the papers are without truth.
This man is known to be a blackguard,
not by myself alone, but by others. It Is
a matter of common report that he is not
lit to come here and investigate matters
tnat require more than ordinary. skill. He
forced the board of examiners of this
department to do things that many men
â would call dishonest. As a member of
the Grand Jury, he should first have
brought these things to the attention of
the Grand Jury."
The resolution was adopted without
further debate, and Directors Carew arid
Derham were added to the finance com
mittee, which had theretofore consisted
of Directors Gallagher, Waller and Ham
mond.
Previous to this the lumber scandal had
raised its head during the session by the
introduction of the following resolution
by President Barrlngton:
Whereas, the attention of this board has
been called to the fact that apparently some
discrepancy exists between the amount of lum
ber furnished and amount consumed by this
department; therefore be It
Resolved, That the Board of Education by
every means In Its power subsist the Grand
Jury of this city and county In iixint the
responsibility, it any, where It properly be
longs.
It was adopted unanimously and with
out comment.
Daniel Sherrin f& Sons were awarded
the contract for repairing the (lirla 1 High
Bchoo!, corner Geary and Scott streets, oil
bid of 11600. The only other bid was
that of Anderson Bros, for $1741.
A communication was read from the
Hae Building: and Contracting Company,
in which the company informed the board
that It had assigned its contract for tho
construction of the Mission High School
to James F. Logan, in accordance with
the wishes of the company's creditors.
The board agreed to approve the assign
ment providing the assignee filed a bond
for $16,000.
H. T. Damm, who was consolidated out
as a teacher of the Hamilton evening
school, was restored to his class, the at
tendance in the high school class having
been maintained over the average re
quired for one month.
A new class was formed in the Spring
Valley evening school, and Miss Kyne
was assigned to the new class.
Mr. Hendry and Mr. Drew were elected
special teachers in mechanical drawing
and asigned to the classes they are now
teaching in the business evening school.
The City Board of Examination recom
mended that M. L. Choynskl be granted
a grammar grade certificate upon his

AND STILL THE
MARKET SOARS
Strong Foreign Quotations
Stiffen Local Wheat
Prices.
Harry Wise Credited With Be
ing the Leiter of San
Francisco.
Fluctuations During the Morning
Develop Into a Feeling
of Strength.
The wheat market -esterday opened
with traders at sea. First Liverpool ca
bles reported a decline of two pennies (4
cents) in wheat futures. This news
caused a weak feeling in Eastern mar
kets .and depressed the bull enthusiasm
In the local market. Chicago wheat open
ed half a cent under Tuesday's closing
riguros. Good buying then resulted in
advancing the price to 83*fcigMc at the ad
vance. Longs began to realize, causing
a sharp break to &IV4C. About this time
closing Liverpool cables reported the
early decline fully recovered, whicn
started an advance.
These conditions kept wheat traders in
the local market In a quandary. Decem
ber opened at $1 80, declined to $1 '$'&,
where good buying was found. The short
selling was strong, but' not heavy enougli
to offset the buying demand. The result
was a victory for the bulls, who bid the
market up to $1 S(H*>. At this price an
other stand was made by the shorts, and
their efforts effected a decline to $1 79^,
the offerings at that -lrice finding ready
buyers, and a rally to $1 SO I.*1 .* followed.
This was the action of the market before
noon.
At the afternoon session there was a
marked change in the character of trad
ing.- Chicago advices were surprisingly
strong; the public curb showed an ad
vance of 1 cent over the closing prices.
One linn wired: "Chicago has gone from
the highest to the lowest wheat market
in the world; we will soon get a strong
advance." Many other expressions of
strength were received by local brokers
from their Chicago .correspondents.
The feeling in wheat was one of
strength before the opening of me ses
sion. December was $1 SlV* old; then $1 82.
$1 S2Â£ and $1 5.2%, was reached before
much wheat could be found for sale.
About the only offerings were these who
had bought under $1 !>U at the morning
sessions.
Harry Wise took everything offered
from >1 524 to Jl S2 34.3 4 . He is considered
just now to be to the San Francisco mar
ket what Leiter is to Chicago. The talent
are opposing him, while he has condi
tions and a strong foreign market In his
favor. It is estimated that his winnings
amount to Siso,ow. â  â¢ .
The feature or the trauing during the
afternoon session " was the buying by
Wise. The offerings came from those
who. were willing to take in their profits.
But little short Belling was indulged in,
as the crowd seemed to have overdone
tlie selling craze under $1 SO. The market
[c again largely oversold. Should Eng
lish and French markets show another
advance to-morrow no doubt- there will
he a scramble for wheat by the shorts.
The undeniable strength shown in East
ern markets late in the day made shorts
very nervous. The trade seems to have
forgotten the marginal rule. Very little
was said about the action of the board
in putting the rule into force, brokers be
ing about evenly divided on the point.
Some are in favor, others against, the
rule.
The situation in wheat is one that neeas
the exercise of judgment at present*
prices. Conditions abroad are very
strong. Liverpool ar.d London report
Btocks exhausted. Paris wheat and flour
continue to Show sharp advances. Tile
war cuts no little factor in the demand
f<>r wheat, the fear that others besides
the United Slates and. Spain may be
drawn Into the conflict having frightened
the foreign wheat and flour trade into re
filling their almost exhausted stocks. Tne
conditions of the growing wheat crops of
tho United Kingdom and Continent are
most encouraging. The crop of the
United States as a whole is most promis
ing, but the secret seems to be that im
porters on the other side of the Atlantic
nave pursued their dangerous policy of
a hand-to-hand character until the case
has gone beyond their control.
There is no telling where the boom
craze will end. As is generally the case,
the price will in the pnd be carried too
far and a severe reaction foilow. At
present there seems no stopping the tide
of advancement.
Barley opened weak at the start: De
cember sold at $1 32; buying by shorts ad
vanced the price to $1 34%. Buying by
shorts was the chief feature of the day's
trading. The life scorns gone out of this
cereal. There is a very large long inter
rst in the market, which will In the end
drng prices voyy much lower. The de
mand for spot is very poor and daily
growing less. The action of yesterday's
market indicated the shorts were trying
to advance the price in order that they
might sell again. Barley seems doomed
to lower prices.
On the 4 p. m. curb December wheat
sold at $1 S3:Â»i: December barley at $135; a
strong feeling prevailing.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL .28, 1898.
IT WAS ALL
A MISTAKE
How Henry F. Emerie
Came to Lose His
Ranch.
Gave It to His Wife, Who, Dy
ing Before Him, Left It to
Her Sister.
An Amicable Suit to Be Instituted
Whioh Will Soon Set Every
thing Right.
The friends of Henry F. Emeric, the ex-
Fish Commissioner, are very indignant
over an article that recently appeared In
a morning paper, in which it was stated
that Mr. Emeric intended instituting a
sensational suit to have the will of his
recently deceased wife set aside and in
whuh, together with a lot of other bosh,
it was stated by innuendo that Attorney
W. W. Foote, one of Mr. Emeric's most
intimate friends, had something to do
with the will left by Mr. Emeric's wife,
by which that gentleman is completely
cut off from the enjoyment of his own
property. The facts of the matter are
as follows: About a year and a half ago
Mr. Emeric deeded to his wife a tract of
land in Contra Costa County known as
the "Home Ranch." The strip covered
about 270 acres, and the only reason for
the gift was that Mr. Emeric wanted to
make his wife a little present, purely as a.
token of affection. This tract was a part
of the great San Pablo rancho, which Mr.
Emeric had inherited from his father,
and whicn comprised nearly 2U,U00 acres,
tho balance of .something over H.iWU acres
Mr. Emeric reserving lor himself.
Shortly after receiving this present Mrs.
Emeric, being then in a rather delicate
state of heiuth, made a will, in whicn,
after bcstuwmg a lew minor legacies or
small sums 01 money. Jewelry and the
like, she maae her sister residuary leg
au-e, thus deposing of all the balance of
Her property, the Z,u acres among tne rest.
Several months alter tins Mr. .Linene
himseil was taken violently ni, and as
he nad every re^tson to fear a tatal ter- i
mlnatlon of his trouble, he deeded all .the
balance or' his property to his wife, not
wishing her to have the trouble of ex
tended legal proceedings alter nis ueatli, ;
which he then thouynt was Dear at band.
Mr. Emeric's Illness turned out differently i
from what he anu every one else expect- â¢!
Ed, and he recovered, while his wife, who
was thought to be improving, grew rap- j
idly worse and finally died on April 1, lier â¢
death being greatly hastened by the flight
she receiveo uuring the recent earui
<4uake. When she died, her sister, being '
residuary legatee, became possessed of a.i
the property of the late Mrs. Emeric,
whicn sne had not bequeathed otherwise,
the 17,100 acres made over by Mr. Emeric
during nis unless among me rest.
Mr. Emeric, his sister-in-law a:i<l all
the relatives of Mr. Emeric's dead wife
who proiit by her will, realizing that it I
was only by a mistake that the husband
bad been temporarily despoiled of his :
property, have agreed to enter into an j
amicable suit for an equitable division of '
the estate. This is all there is to the re- i
cently published version of an expected j
sensation.
W. W. Foote had nothing whatever to
do with the will, as he did not draw it
up. being sick abed at the time, and knew
nothing about it until the death of Mrs.
, Emeric. The only way be conies to be
! connected wivh the case is through a note
left by Mrs. Emeric among the rest of her
papers, in which she says that if it is
ru â  essary to have legal advice in. settling
, up her estate it is her wish that B4r.
i Foote, being an old friend of the family.
i be given charge of the matter. .
Mrs. Emeric was never asked by her
husband to return any gifts that he had
| made her, and at the time of the transfer
<pf the IT.OuQ acres neither she, her hua
band nor any of their friends imagined
for a moment that Emeric would survive
his wife. .

BOLD THREAT
THROWN OUT
BY PHELAN
May Attempt to Take Revenge on
the Company That Is On
Widber's Bond.
Many City Officials and Employes Involved.
A Special Session of the Supervisors
Called for To-Day.
I -will use every effort, officially and otherwise, to compel them
to meet this obligation, and I shall not approve any bond of their com
pany hereafter, now that I have an insight into their methods. â Ex
tract from published statement of Mayor Phelan.
When Mayor PheJan made this threat
Tuesday he believed he had it within his
power to work great injury to the Fidel
ity and Deposit Company of Maryla-nd.
It was uttered while the Mayor was
smarting under the Impending danger of
being sued by the company named for
part of the defalcation of ex-Treasurer
A. C. Widber. This company is on Wld
ber's bond for $100,000, and its president,
Edwin Warfield, claims that the Mayor,
as chairman of the board that made the
counts of the money in the custody of the
defaulting Treasurer, is in part responsi
ble for the shortage. In fact, it has made
a formal demand upon the Board of Su
pervisors to bring suit against Wldber
and the Mayor, If necessary, to recover
the amount of its bond. This action was
prompted by the belief on the part of the
president of the company that the Mayor
did not exercise due care in the discharge
of his duty as guardian of the city's
money.
It is only since the present administra
tion came into power in the City Hall
that the Fidelity and Deposit company
of Maryland made a bid for the bond
business connected with the officers and
attaches of the various city department^
The records show that it is on the bonus
of forty-five officials and employes, aside
from that of Widber. The total amount
represented in these forty-five bonds is
1406,000. The complete list follows:

Each of these had to be approved by
the Mayor. On what ground the Mayor
â will base his threatened disapproval in
the future is not divulged. As the com
pany's solvency has never been questioned
lie muy not ilnd it a-s easy a matter to
carry his threat into execution as he pos
eibly thinks. The only way in which h.
could carry out his intention of interfer
ing with the company's legitimate busi
ness would be to use his personal influ
ence with those who are required to give
bonds.
It was feared by some of the employes
In the City Hail that the Mayor might
attempt to attack the soundness of the

Mayor Phelan yesterday called a special
meeting of the Supervisors to be held to
day. The board will be asked to take
measures to recover from the surety
company the amount for which it be
came responsible on Widber' s bond. The
surety company will probably be repre
sented, and will ask that the Doard begin
proceedings against Widber, the Mayor
and others who composed the counting
board for the amount of Widber' s defal
cation, so as to protect the company ac
far as it is legally able to do so. An in
tfrostinpr session is anticipated.
Treasurer Rels opened his office for bus
iness yesterday, and announced that he
was ready to handle all the business that
might be offered. The safe that Chief
Lees inadvertently threw out of order by
Interfering with Its combination was
opened yesterday, without recourse to the
boring method. All the money in it waa
counted and found to be correct.
Should Widber escape criminal prosecu
tion by the city authorities, he will still
have difficulty in keeping out of a felon's
cell, as it is the policy of the Fidelity and
Deposit Company to prosecute all persons
who cause it loss by a criminal act.
ACCOMPLICES SUSPECTED.
Mayor Phelan Believes Wid-
ber Was Not Alone in Rob-
bing the Treasury.
Mayor Phelan believes Widber was not
alone In looting the city treasury. He
Insinuated to the Grand Jury last night
in a letter that he was of the opinion that
others besides the imprisoned ex-Treas
urer were implicated in the robbery.
The Mayor, in his communication to the
Grand Jury, asks that all the deputies be
called before that body and under oath
be made to tell all they know of the dis
appearance of the lost coin from the
cfty'fl vaults. He also wants Widber put
in the Grand Jury sweat box and asked
many pertinent questions concerning the
robbery. Chief Lees, too, he thinks
might be able to tell someming that will
bring conviction to the supposed accom
plices of the disgraced city official.
SUSPENSION
MAKES TROUBLE
Brown of Berkeley Is Being
Backed by the Local
Athletes.
The Intercollegiate Association De
clared to Bo Auto
cratic.
The action of the executive committee
of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association
suspending Everett Brown for two years
on account of his harsh criticism of East
ern athletes, has stirred up local athletes
and something more will be heard frof.
all sides before the matter Is forgotten.
Brown, on his return from the East last
winter, told in public about athletic con
ditions as they exist on the Atlantic
Coast. Casper Whitney has called our
local athletics "putrid," "pustular" and
a thousand other such pleasant names,
and Brown, according to his observations,
discovered that the status of amateur
sport in the East was no purer than our
own. This was his opinion, and he al
lowed It to pass his lips before a gather
ing of eager listeners. Because he did
this the Intercollegiate Association, rising
In its wrath, suddenly assumed a censor
ship and suspended Brown for a couple
of years.
The suspension has caused a great deal
of comment and complications are likely
to en.sue from it.
William Humphrey, the well-known
fosterer of amateur athletics and for
many years president of the Pacific Ath
letic Association of the A. A. U., unhesi
tatingly condemns the action of the Inter
collegiate Association. "Brown merely
expressed an opinion," he said yesterday,
"and the Intercollegiate Association of
which the two California colleges are
members had no right to exert a censor
ship of speech. Brown is entitled to his
opinion and to the right of expressing it.
I think the suspension autocratic and un
called for. Brown will be a judge in the
Pacific Amateur Association field day
next Saturday. We will take no recogni
tion of the suspension unless Informed
in a formal manner, and then I doubt
whether It will influence us any."
The American Athletic Union embraces
the Intercollegiate Association and the
Pacific Association, an affiliation being
the spirit that governs the operations of
any component part. In this case it looks
as If the home association would ignore
the actions of the Eastern body.
Prominent supporters of athletics like
John Elliott likewise back Brown. Elliott
said yesterday: "If I were Brown I
would see the end of this thine. If he has
facts let him present them and force an
exposure of the methods which he claims
regulate the athletic conduct of the
East."
The West is rarely recognized in the
East in matters athletic, and this is an
other straw piled on the camel's bock
There are many who declare they foresee
the time when the load will be heavy
enough to break things.
TWO EXPERT BURGLARS.
Martin Gavin and Thomas Powers
Have Twenty-Five Cases to
Their Credit.
Martin Gavin and Thomas Powers, who were
arrested Tuesday night by Policemen Edner
and Brown while trying to break Into the house
of T. Varney, a vegetable gardener at Ocean
avenue and Corbett road, were booked at the
City Prison yesterday on a charge of attempted
burglary.
Gavin and Powers are notorious sneak thieves
and their arrest has given great pleasure to
Captain Olllen. as they have committed a large
number of burglaries in the outlying portions
of the Mission district. They were In the habit

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 1898.
CHASING THE
CULPRITS TO
THEIR LAIR
Grand Jury Begins to Probe the
Newest of the School
Scandals.
Experts Testify to the Outrageous Frauds
Practiced in the Supplying
of Lumber.
The committee of the Grand Jury con
ducting the investigation into the repair
ing of school buildings during the first
half of the present fiscal year has made
its report and the entire body has taken
the matter up with the intention of run
ning to earth every man who has had a
hand in the gigantic steal.
A special session of the Grand Jury was
held last nigm for the purpose, and after
returning an indictment against Stanton,
who is alleged to have attempted to ex
tort money from "School Director Ragan
(whose brother-in-law John O'Brien,
ought to know a whole lot about the
latest scandal), proceeded with the busi
ness on hand.
Expert Rickards was first summoned
to the secret chamber. Mr. Rickards is
the regular Grand Jury expert, and as
sisted the lumber experts, Messrs. Holt
and Campbell, furnished by the Lumber
Dealers' Association, in all their investi
gations.
Each man figured up the amount of
lumber used separately, and the result
was entered in a book, the accuracy of
the figures oeing vouched for by all three.
Mr. Rickards presented this book to the
Grand Jury and explained the methods
of procedure and the discrepancies be
tween the quantities charged for and
what was actually found.
Mr. Holt followed and gave the Jury
some valuable points on measuring lum
ber, besides describing hi 3 investigations
at the various schools and their results.
After Mr. Campbell had given similar tes
timony the Grand Jury continued iho
hearing until next Monday night.
Grand Jurymen Emil Bauer, ri. A. Hed
ger, Dr. Bryan and A. B. Truman, with
Experts Holt, Campbell and Rickard,
continued their Inspection of school build
ings yesterda'- and the result disclosed
as bad a state of affairs as at any of
those previously inspected. Short meas
urement and the poorest quality of lum
ber to be obtained were the rule without
an exception, wmle the city had been In
variably charged the highest contract
price.
If the city had on hand all the plank
ing it has paid for during the first half
of the present fiscal year, but no trace of
which can be foundâ and it is reasonable
to suppose has never been delivered â
there would be enough to replank every
school yard in the city.
The Western Addition was the scene of
operations yesterday, two schools, in ad
anion to the measurement of some addi
tional lumber found In the bill against
the Hamilton Grammar Scnool, being
gone over. In order that no question
could be raised as to the thoroughness of
the Investigation several hours were
spent at each nlace ana every nook and
crevice ransacked for the missing lumber.
The Crocker Grammar School on Page
street, near Baker, was the first on the
list. Here the yard had been replanked
and Borne of the stairs repaired, the lum

ing quantities of No. 1 lumber, but in
every lot only the poorest quality being
BREWERS MUST
PAY IN CASH
Tax Is Paid Only When the
Stamps Are Attached to
the Barrels.
Right to the 6aven and m Half Per
Cent Discount Not Acquired by
the Act of Purchase.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
at Washington notified Collector Lynch
yesterday of an Important decision af
fecting all beer brewers in the United
States with reference to the manner of
purchasing internal revenue stamps for
beer in barrels, and discount of 7Va per
cent allowed on the same. According to
the terms of the decision stamps must be
paid for in cash and at their full face
value.
The decision was made by the United
States Commissioner of Internal Revenue
at Washington in the case of the Ameri
can Brewery Company of St. Louis, Mo.,
vs. the United States. The contention
arose out of an application by the com
pany for beer stamps of the value of $25,
000. The company tendered in payment
for the same a certified check for $23,125,
being the amount of the face value of the
stamps, less the deduction of 77 1/*1 /* per
centum allowed by section 3341 of the Re
vised Statutes of the United States. Such
payment by check was in accordance
with the usual course of business be
tween the claimant and the ortice of the
Collector of Internal Revenue, at whose
office a statement was made in substance
as follows:
"We are temporarily out of stamps.
Leave your check and application and we
will notify you when to call for the
stamps."
About a month later the application
and check were returned to the brewing
company with the statement that owing
to the modification of section 3341 of the
Revised Statutes by the terms of section
9 of the act of July 24, 1897, the stamps
could be purchased only for their full
face value in cash.
The following paragraphs from the de
cision will be round of interest:
It is made the duty of the Collector by Section
3341, Revised Statutes to keep on hand at all
times a sufficient supply of permits and a supply
of stamps equal In amount to two months' sales
thereof. The law contemplated the possession
of stamps at the time of the sale and does not
permit transactions involving the gale of
stamps for future delivery.
The Collector Is authorized by law to sell
stamps which may be on hand at the time of
pale, but it does not permit the making of
executory contracts for future delivery. His
agency In the sale of stamps was limited by
law to a sale of the stock on hand and did
not confer the right to sell for future delivery.
The law makes it the duty of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue to prepare suitable stamps
and furnish the same to the Collector in such
quantities as the need of the trade demands.
The Collector gets his supply from the Commis
sioner, and his agency attaches to such stamps
as he receives from the Commissioner, and be
yond tliat he has no power to bind the de
fendants in the sale of stamps.
T'nder the Act of July 24, 1597, a brewer is
compelled to pay the full face value of the
stamps purchased without deduction of 7Hc per
cent previously allowed by Section 3341, Revised
Statutes.
The purchase of stamps by a brewer does not
technically pay the tax on his production; the
tax Is paid when he attaches the stamp to the
barrel for the purpose of putting the product
on the market.
The right to the IVa pÂ»>r cent discount is not
consummated by the mere act of purchase, but
Is dependent upon the further condition of the
stamps being used by the brewer.
Although the law uses the word "sale" as
applicable to the delivery and transfer of
stamps they do not thereby become a com
modity of merchandise In the market.
The Collector In accepting drafts in payment
of the tax acts without the authority of law
and does not bind the United States.
The Collectors .agency In the sale of stamps
is limited to the sale of stock on hand, but
does not confer the right to sell for a future
delivery.
Judgment for Bowers.
In the case of A. B. Bowers vs. A. W.
yon Schmidt 19 the United States Circuit
found: 45,780 feet of two-inch planking;
1500 feet of two-inch pine; 7466 feet of 3x6
and 7780 feet of 4x4 redwood; 576 feet of
IV4x4 inch tongue and groove flooring and
UI.S feet of stepping. This is what was
found, the most liberal allowance being
made for waste: Is.ftOO feet of planking,
a shortage of 22,75>0 feet; 73 feet of 2x4
pine, a loss of 1427 feet; a total of 7500
foet of 3x6 and 2x4 redwood, a loss of 7746
feet; 374 feet of flooring where 576 feet
had been charged; 162 feet of stepping,
only one-sixth of what. had been paid for.
In order to obtain these measurements
planks were torn up, the earth dug away
from the stringers in order to show their
size and every foot of new timber on the
premises carefully and accurately meas
ured.
The planking was measured first and
when the result was announced by the
three experts, who made the computa
tion separately with the same result, the
Grand Jury men became deeply inter
ested. Some assisted in ripping up the
planks, while the others took turns in
nailing them down after the experts had
finished their task. As an Instance of
the thoroughness of the work it may be
cited that long and careful search was
made for eighty-four feet of 3-inch
clear, that appeared among the items in
the bill, but It could not be found.
In this connection it may be mentioned
that in the hills against every school
visited so far appear one f >r more items
for insignificant quantities of lumber
such as that above given, none of which
has been found.
Second on the list was the Emerson
Primary, on Pine near Scott street. The
same careful inspection took place with
the same shameful results, less than half
the lumber charged for being .found, and
the quality of that found being the very
poorest. These wore the principal items
on the bill, with what the city actually
received: 41,875 feet of 2-inch planking
charged for, and 19,500 feet used; 16,474
feet of 4x4 redwood, 6400 feet used; 1752
feet of stepping, 501 feet used; 200 feet
of tongue and groove flooring, 173 feet
used.
It was getting late, but the committee
was anxious to know something about a
charge for 41,610 feet of 4x4 redwood that
had oeen found against the Hamilton
Grammar, so the party went to the
Geary-street premises. The yard was re
planked last summer, and the planking
was measured last Friday and found to
be far short of the quantity charged for,
but the stringers were not measured.
The entire yard was gone over, and two
or three pieces found that had been used
to brace uji the rear fence, the total
amount being I*7oo feet, a shortage of 31,910
feet, or 75 per cent of the total amount.
Ihat finished the work for the present,
at least, every member of the commit
tee being thoroughly satisfied that the
grossest fraud marked every job of re
pairing made since last July. Sixteen
schools in every section of the city have
been inspected, with the same result. Had
there been a single place where the ex
perts' measurements came anywhere near
tallying with the amounts charged, there
might have been some grounds for doubt,
but as it is t?ie members of the Grand
Jury are determined to fix the responsi
bility for the loot of the city funds.
Court to settle a contention regarding the
ownership of patent rights in the hydrau
lic dredger. Judge Morrow yesterday gave
Judgment for the plaintiff- for $1 and
costs. The costs amount to about $3000.

GRAND DOGS ENTERED.
Largest Meeting of the Year Will Be
Held To-Morrow at Union
Coursing Park.
There was one of the largest and most
enthusiastic gatherings of the season last
evening in Pythian Hall to witness the
"drawing" of fast dogs for the all-age
stake and the great champion stake,
which will be held to-morrow at Union
Coursing Park.
The all-age stake was originally open
to forty-eight dogs, but leashmon were so
anxious to have representatives in the
stake that seventy-eight nominations were
received.
The club finally agreed to make the
stake eligible for sixty-four dogs, and as
a matter of solace to the sportsmen who
had, under the circumstances to withdraw
their respective charges, the directors of
the park allowed each owner of a dog or
dogs that had to be scratched a small
monetary consideration.
It will be noticed that many of the
crack dogs of the Stateâprize-winners
are entered in the champion stake. It is
regretted that the great Connemara was
not among the Myers, but the ones en
tered are all of high class quality, and
great coursing will assuredly result. The
drawing is as follows:

POLICE ON A HOT TRAIL.
They Believe That the Problem of
Many Mysterious Bobberies
Is Now Solved.
ThÂ© Imitation gras meter man, the bogus
water inspector and the alleged laundry
men have all had their turn, and for a
time have shone in their uniqueness; but
the lottery ticket operator is a pioneer in
his line, and thus far has had no imi
tators.
Burglaries and petty larcenies of a
dozen different varieties and a dozen dif
ferent methods have been brought to
light in the past three months, but the
profession is evidently finding a higher
plane. The police have had to reclassify
their crooks and materially remodel their
methods.
For the past two months the hotel
keepers of the Sutter-street boarding
house district have been put to it to dis
cover the perpetrator of the innumerable
petty larcenies reported to them by their
guests. Purses have been reported miss-
Ing, watches gone a-glimmering and jew
els easily picked up and easily concealed
have been reported missing. Though
every energy was bent in that direction
no clew to the identity of the skillful
operator was had until yesterday morn
ing, when Mrs. J. M. Daniels a guest
at the Hotel Alexandria, 781 Sutter street,
reported that her purse containing val
uable papers and no small sum of money
had Just been stolen. She fljftly accused
a vender of lottery tickeis, who for two
months past has made it his custom to
visit the house.
Mrs. Daniels had Jupt been preparing
for a shopping trip in town. She had laid
her gloves and her purse upon the dresser
in her room and had stepped for a few '
minutes' chat to the apartments of a
friend adjoining. As sue left her room
she noticed the agent of the lottery
knocking at different doors and trying
the locks of those from which he got no
response. He was working up the hall
toward her room. After an absence of i
not more than three or four minutes she i
returned to her room and discovered her i
door wide open and her purse missing '
The alleged vender of sure-thing tickets '
in the lottery had also disappeared with
out finishing his rounds.
She immediately reported her loss and
the circumstances to the management.
Chief Lees was immediately communicat
ed with and Detective Seymour detailed
to hunt down the culprit. He has strong
clews to the man's whereabouts and he
doubtless will be soon apprehended.
It is now remembered that every case
of theft heretofore reported at the hotel
has been discovered directly after the
weekly visits of the same lottery agent.
On previous occasions two valuable
watches have been missing from different
rooms, and other larcenies of books and
baubles' have been of frequent occurrence.
It is probable that the peer of the meter
artist has been discovered.

TAKEN FROM THE STAGE.
Little Norman Phillips, a bright, flax
en-haired boy, aged six years, was re
moved from the Orpheum Theater yester
day afternoon by Colonel Parnell of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children.
The little theatrical wonder has been
on the stage for a year or so, alternating
between Morosco's and other local houses,
until he eventually secured an engagement
at the Orpheum for $2 a week to sing and
otherwise amuse the audience.
Information having been conveyed to
the secretary of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children steps were
taken to have the child removed. Yester
day afternoon Colonel Parnell sent for
Mrs. Phillips and read the law to her
covering the case. She pleaded ignorance
of the law, and when its conditions were
explained to her she cheerfully consented
to keep her little boy home.
The father of young Norman is at pres
ent in Vallejo. He is a professor of lan
guages and was not aware of his son be
ing engaged In the theater. Mrs. Nor
man was connected with the theatrical
profession in the E-ast years ago. She
stated to Colonel Parnell that she was
saving the little fellow's earnings for the
purpose of giving him a musical educa
tion by and by, as she believes he pos
sesses rare musical talent. The parents
of little Norman are respectable and mean
to do what is right by their son, as also
to comply with the law.
A Schooner in Distress.
At a late hour last night a steam
schooner was observed displaying sig
nals of distress about ten miles west
northwest of Point Reyes. It is sup
posed that she is the Weott bound from
Eureka to this point, now two days
overdue. There was a heavy wind
blowing and the sea was running high.
The tug Reliance of Spreckels' fleet was
dispatched to her assistance at about 3
o'clock this morning.
