VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO 108.
PERMANENT AMERICAN CONTROL
OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
Text of the Instructions
to the Peace Com
mission.
Spain Will Be Required to Give
a National Salute to the
Stars and Stripes.
NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â The Herald's Washington
correspondent telegraphs : The instructions finally drawn
up and approved by the President and his Cabinet at a
special meeting this afternoon, after a lengthy conference
with four members of the Peace Commission this morn
ing, mean permanent American control of the Philip
pines.
Although there was an agreement that nothing
should be divulged as to the nature of the instructions,
pending the arrival of the commission in Paris, I was
told to-night by a high official of the administration,
who is familiar with their contents, that the instructions
mean a treaty which would make American control of
the entire Philippine group inevitable.
In addition to the determination of
the question of future, possession, con- |
trol and government of the Philippines,
the treaty of peace which the American
and Spanish commissioners are to ne- !
gotiate in Paris will have to include im- j
portant provisions finally disposing of j
many other matters.
While the Spanish Government, in
the protocol signed on August 12,
pledged itself to relinquish all sover
eignty rights in the island of Cuba, to !
cede to the United States Porto Rico
and all other islands in the West In- \
dies then under control of Spain and '
to cede to the United States one of the
Ladrone islands, to be chosen by the .
United States, all of these pledges will j
have to be definitely and finally carried j
out in the treaty. The evacuation of j
Cuba and Porto Rico will have to be \
provided for in accordance with agree
nirnt* t<i La raaohod by the Cuban and â 
P^Tto IVcun military. coin missions. The ,
cession of Guam Island, which will be
named as the choice of the United
States in the Ladrones, will have to be
specifically provided for.
In addition to these provisions, the
treaty will contain a provision for a
joint commission to pass upon all
claims arising, out of the Cuban war.
It will also include a provision for a
national salute to the American flag
as a preliminary to the resumption of j
diplomatic relations between the
United States and Spain.
COMMISSIONERS GIVEN
CONSIDERABLE SCOPE
Will Not Be Bound by Ironclad Or
ders in the Negotiations at
Paris.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 15.â The Cabi- j
net met in special session this after
noon and adjourn. ! at 4 o'clock. All
of the members â were present except
Secretary Alger, who is not in the city.
All united in the statement after the j
meeting that they i agreed to say
nothing more of the deliberation^ than
that the peace commissioners had beÂ«n
fully instructed. As to the nature of i
these Instructions they conveyed not a
word. Each one pointed out that to ]
do so would be extremely impolitic, and
would amount to arming the Spanish
commission in advance against them-
Belves. The peace commissioners who
were approached on the subject made
similar response, thus closing all offi
cial avenues of information.
It was said that the commissioners
\.-.-rv "fully instructed," and upon seek
ing a further explanation of this phrase
it appeared that the Cabinet had pa
tiently gone over in tho discussion with
. inmissloners every subject that,
in its opinion, could be brought Into
the proceedings before the Joint com
missioners. On each of these, the
American commissioners were made ac
quainted with the view and wishes of
the administration.
It is not to be v âstood from this
that the commissioners go under Iron
clad and unchangeable instructions at
fil) points, for there is a certain amount
of flexibility in the instructions, else,
as one of 'he Cabinet members put it,
the President might just as well have
reduced his wishes to paper in the form
of an ultimatum and have sent that to
Paris by mf-ssengers. The peace com
missioners are in no sense mere mouth
pieces, but having chosen with the
greatest care and consideration five
men, in whom he puts the most explicit
confidence, the President feels that they
are to be trusted with the interests of
the United States. It is not expected
that they will have n free rein in the
larger questions of policy, but with am
ple opportunities for consultations by
cable and otherwise, there Is no reason
why the commissioners should not be
able to carry out the desires of the ad
ministration and at the same time
have the opportunity to somewhat
shape those desires by conveying infor
mation they may require.
For Instance it is expected that at
Paris the commissioners will meet Gen
eral Merritt, fresh from Manila, and in
addition they will there have the bene
fit of a special report from Admiral
Dewey. The3e will be of the greatest
value, for the commiSHioners are not
acquainted with the Philippine ques
tion in detail and even the information
that is to be acquired from the Span
ish peace commissioners Is not to be
despised when It takes such an official
form that it can be relied upon as to
accuracy.
All the arrangements have been com
pleted for the departure of the com
mission and its staff. Most of the
party will leave Washington at 4
o'clock to-morrow afternoon for New
Tork, but rcumstances may detain
some of the commissioners until the
night train. The Campania sails at 2
p. m. Saturday End explicit instructions
have been given all members of the
The San Francisco Call
party to be on board at that time.
Special baggage tags have been printed
for the belonging of the commissioners
and a small paper paster showing red
and blue bars crossed on a white back
ground gives a handy way of making
a ''red, white and blue" identification
of the personal and general luggage of
the party.
A number of stout cedar chests have
been made to carry the books, pamph
lets, typewritten papers, etc., forming
a part of the American case. The
chests are like shallow steamer trunks
so that they may be shoved under the
berths and thus be available on the
passage over, Instead of going with the
baggage in the hold of the steamer.
This will permit considerable work on
the trip and It Is expected that the

commissioners will hold meetings on
shipboard. They will go direct from
Liverpool to London and there stop for
a day's rest, then proceeding to Paris
by the way of Dover and Calais
Senator Frye called at the War De
partment during the afternoon and had
a talk with Acting Secretary Meikle-
John. While they were together Rep
resentative William Alden Smith of
Michigan, who is a member of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Joined them. In the course of a good
natured exchange Mr. Smith urged
Senator Frye to hold on to the Philip
pines as an entirety, as well as all
other territory which we were possessed
of as a result of the war. Mr. Frye
diplomatically avoided committing him
self beyond remarking that this idea
seemed to be growing.
As Mr. Frye came from the depart
ment he was asked if he favored a re
tention of the Philippines, to which he
replied:
"I never have given my views on that
to any human being."

SPAIN WILL NOT BE
PERMITTED TO PARLEY
Must Acquiesce in the American Stip
ulations or Suffer n Resumption
of the "War.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 16.â The State
SAIST FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1898.
Department to-night gave out the fol
lowing concerning the discussion to
day between the members of the Cabi
net and the peace commission:
The members of the Peace Commission,
with the exception of Senator Gray,
whose absence was due to his inability to
withdraw as counsel in a case In which he
was engaged some time before his ap
pointment as one of the Peace Commis
sioners, have spent the greater rartfof
yesterday and to-day in a free discussion
of the duties with the discharge of which
they have been intrusted by the Presi
dent. Senator Gray is expected during
the evening, and before sailing will have
a full conference with the President and
his associates.
While, for obvious reasons, it was de
termined that the nature of the instruc
tions as to the negotiations about to be
entered upon shouTd for the present oe
kept secret and made known only after
dennite results shall have been reached,
it is possible to state authoritatively that
the commission goes to Paris fully pre
pared to follow a course of action mapped
out for it as the result of the consulta
tions of the last two days.
â  At the very outset it will be made clear
to the Spanish commissioners that, as In
the case of the preliminary protocol, there
can be no deviation from or modification
of the demands made by the United States.
The decision arrived at by the President,
after a full consultation with the mem
bers of the commission, subsequently re
ceived the cordial and unanimous ap
proval of the Cabinet at a meeting held
this afterr.non.
As previously announced, the commis
sion sails from New York on the Cam
pania at 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon.

petition.
Special Dispatch to The Call
HAVANA, Sept. 15.â The predomi
nant feature of the situation Is the
feverish and widespread agitation of
the Cubans in favor of the absolute
independence of the island at all costs.
Manifestos are being circulated invit
ing the co-c-peration of Spanish resi
dents and merchants to this end, and
pointing out that either annexation or
an American protectorate would mean
death to all trade with Spain in a
couple of years.
General Maximo Gomez, who only a
fortnight ago gave expression to ex
tremely moderate views, counseling
harmony and patience, now expresses
himself as strongly in favor of absolute
independence or nothing.
How far the influence of the party
agitating for Cubap independence may
extend it is at present difficult to esti
mate, but the fact is its agents are
working like beavers.
This violent impetus given to the
agitation for independence is the re
sult, apparently, of the arrival of the
Resolute, or, rather, of the arrival of
Mr. Porter and the examination he is
making Into tariffs, municipal taxation
and other matters of international gov
ernment which Cubans had expected
to handle and administer themselves.
One reason why many Spaniards who
at first favored annexation have now
changed their opinion is that they fear
the competition of American rivals a3
storekeepers, hotel managers and res
taurant-keepers.
Exactly the same spirit prevails
among the planters, especially the
smaller ones, who had hoped to sell at
good prices the old French and Belgian
machinery for which they paid dear
and Imported under excessive duties.
They realize that the American ma
chinery, much cheaper and paying
practically no duties, will establish a
large central market, close theirs and
push them to the wall.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Sept 15.â General
Lawton has received information from a
Cuban courier from Manzanillo that four
days ago the Spaniards there violated the
armistice by attempting to take posses

further trouble, but the Cubans dispatch

quest that an armed force be sent to Man

plied with, as Manzanillo is outside the
territory embraced by the terms of ca
pitulation.
SERIOUS SITUATION
IN SAN DOMINGO
Commercial Panic Threatens the Sta
bility of the Government â Great
Distress in the Island.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Heral.3. Copyrighted, 1593, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PORTE PLATA, San Domingo, Sept.
IB. â Serious results may come from the
widespread commercial panic that exists
In this country. Public discontent has at
tained such force that the situation of the
present Government is critical.
The trouble has been accumulating for
more than a month, and is laid at the
door of the financial system of the coun
try. Exchange on New York has been
gradually rising, and the Increase in a
month has been more than 100 per cent.
This has caused great distress throughout
the island. Cuts in napes have been made
in many instances, ana these have caused
strikes. Every effort is being made to
avert disaster.
BRYAN PREFERS BALLOTS
TO POSSIBLE BULLETS
He Is Anxious to Get Home to Take
Part in the Fall Cam
paign.
NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â A special to the
Herald from Washington says: Colonel
William Jennings Bryan will, I under
stand, soon end his war service. Reluct
ant as he is to resign his commission, in
the face of pending orders to hiÂ» regiment
to proceed to Cuba for garrison duty, his
desire to get back to his State in time for
the fall campaign is seemingly paramount
to all Other considerations.
Strenuous efforts have been made by the
Governor of his State and other poli
ticians to have his regiment mustered out,
so as to allow Colonel Bryan to f-scape
the alternative of resigning his commis
sion. This he contemplates doing in case
the War Department adheres to Its de
cision to keep the First Nebraska in serv
ice, and this, I am told, the President has
decided to do. not because his late politi
cal rival is colonel of the regiment but be
cause this one remaining regiment from
Nebraska is needed for service in Cuba.
"FIGHTING BOB'S" NEW POST.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â Secretary
Long this afternoon decided to assign
Captain Evans to duty as a member of
the naval inspection board, and he will
assume his new duties after a brief va
cation.
SET A TRAP-GUN FOR A
ROBBER OF HIS CABIN
Bound Valley Rancher Arrested for
Murder â The Case a Peculiar
One.
ITKIAH, Sept. 15.â Court Barker, who
lives seven miles from Covelo, was arrest
ed yesterday and charged with murder.
The case is a peculiar one. Barker owns
a ranch in Round Valley, and for some
time past has been bothered by parties
who entered his cabin during his absence
and appropriated several articles. Barker
rigged up a rifle Monday and set it in his
cabin su that when the window was
opened the weapon would be discharged.
M. Blanc, a Frenchman, visited ttiÂ«
house Monday. He was a stranger in that
part of the country, and opened the win
dow. The gun was discharged and the
bullet penetrated his breast, killing him
instantly.
Arrested at Hanford for Arson.
HANFORD, Sept. 15.â William Fisher of
Cincinnati has been arrested for burning
the barn of W. S. Porter, four miles west
of Hanford this morning. He is also
charged with having fired the residence
of J. W. Lane soon after. The evidence
against him Is eald to be conclusive.
No Complaint Accompa
nies the Demand for
Mrs. Botkin.
Is She a Fugitive?- The One
Question Which Gov. Budd
Must Now Decide.
Governor Hudd surprised the prosecution la the Dunning
poiMoning cane yesterday, by declaring that the extrudttion pa
pern do nut contain a, formal complaint against Mrs. Cordelia.
Botkin. The hearing: of the case will go on, bnt the Governor
advised that the authorities of Delaware be requested to for
wurd the all-important document at once.
He assured Assistant District Attorney Honmer that he
would not grrant the request for extradition on the present
sliowinur of the prosecution.
His questioning*, dnrlng the course of the inquiry, Indi
cated that he had made a deep and Intelligent study of the lew
bearing on the cane. It Indicated, also, that he did not believe
her to be a fugitive from justice under the constitution. He
asked Assistant District Attorney Hosmer if he knew of a sin
gle case where extradition had been granted when the party
had never been in the State. Mr. Hosnier had to acknowledge
that there -was none.
The Innocence or guilt of Mrs. Botkin does not enter Into
the case now under consideration, the fight being on the ques
tion of extradition alone.
An impression that Cordelia Botkin
would not be sent to Delaware for trial
on any such showing as the police would
be able to make was greatly strengthened
yesterday during the extradition proceed
ings which took place in a room at the
I Palace Hotel. It must be admitted that
I up to the present stage the triumph of the
prisoner's lawyers seems to be complete.
Governor Budd stands between the woman
and the Delaware authorities, and seems
j to entertain the idea that the constitution
I of the United States sustains him. If the
! harangue of District Attorney Hosmer
I had any effect in weakening the opinion
of the executive there was no indication
of It. The hearing will continue to-day.
The apartment in which proceedings
were held was not crowded. About the
edges of the room were rows of law stu
dents and newspaper men. One lady re
porter graced the scene. There was
among the spectators a craning of necks
due to an impression that the defendant
was present. As a matter of fact Mrs.
Botkin did not appear. She was, repre
sented by Attorneys Knight, Wheeler,
McGowan and Heggerty. Against this ar
ray Hosmer had to stand alone, and his
experience did not gain in comfort from
the attitude of Governor Budd, who asked
many questions. The presence of Chief
Lees ana Detective McVey may have sus
tained him.
Hosmer explained that the purpose of
the law was to punish rather than shield
the guilty. The Governor did not desire
the matter of guilt or innocence to be dis
cussed. What he wanted to know was
whether Mrs. Botkin could be regarded as
a fugitive from Delaware. He was direct
in his inquiries, and did not appear to be
fully satisfied with the answers. That he
had himself been devoting study to each
point involved was evident. The proceed
ings, particularly in the afternoon, were
not of a lively nature. Hosmer cited in
stances and quoted law, meantime read-
Ing an address written in a book. It hap
pened that he stood directly In front of a
mirror. Occasionally his eye would alight
on a gesture reproduced there, and the
vision seemed to please. At least he
would make another gesture and look
again. There is reason to fear that that
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
mirror will be the means of prolonging
the hearing. Â°
According to the view freely expressed
by Governor Budd, there is no reason for
sending Mrs. Botkin to Delaware. Hos
er ,P l ? aded for v on the ground that it
would be an act of comity. The Governor
was not in favor of extending the sort of
comity which would conflict with the Su-
Preme Court. He did not understand how
the Delaware complaint could have been
sworn to and bolstered up by evidence col
lected in San Francisco long after the
date of the swearing. Neither was ha
pleased with the form of the complaint.
Such was the condition when the hear
ing closed for the day. Hosmer had been
talking as steadily as the flre of inter
ruptions would permit, but he could not
pacify the interrogative Governor. at
times there were signs of warmth, but
after adjournment the Governor called
Hosmer "John." Detective McVey looked
depressed. His prospects of an early trip
EaÂ§t ifi company with Mrs. B.iikin bad
lost their brilliancy. It was with a sub
dued air that Chief Lees gathered up the
wealth of exhibits with which he had
cumbered the room. Hosmer assumed a
solemn aspect. The Botkin attorneys
loaded themselves with a law library
each and went away. They were observed
to be grinning.
At 10 o'clock in the morning Governor
Budd's apartments at the Palace were
well filled. It had been quietly given out
that Mrs. Botkin would appear at the
opening of the proceedings that will have
results of so much importance to her. At
the last moment her attorneys decided
that her presence before the executive
would not be necessary.
Chief Lees carried his ill-omened black
grip, and from it he shortly drew the bun
dle of documents which he was to turn
over to the Governor.
Upon Governor Budd's arrival he settled
at once at the business that lay before
him. Chief Lees opened proceedings by
laying before the Governor the requisition
of Governor Tunnell for the person of
Mrs. Botkin, the warrant for her arrest
and the numerous affidavits and exhibits
that have been attached during the past
month.
It was the warrant that first caught the
eyes of Governor Budd and he immediate
ly asked Chief Lees for the complaint
upon which it was based.
"Why, the warrant is the complaint,"
explained the Chief. "They are the same
thing."
"Mr. Hosmer," demanded Governor
Budd, "do you consider this paper a com
plaint."
"I do, your Excellency."
"Well, I certainly cannot grant extradi
tion upon any such showing as this. The
first thing that the Governor looks for
when he is asked for requisition is the
complaint, information or indictment that
the request must necessarily be based
upon. Such an instrument is not here.
This paper is not even an affidavit that
such complaint has been ever made. It
seems to me that it is nothing more than
a hodge-podge of both warrant and affi
davit. As far as the affidavit part of it
goes it does not say that the complaining
witness does make oath that the facts aro
true, but that he has, at some time past,
made such oath. Furthermore, it is not
sworn to by any one, apparently. Tho
name of John B. Pennington, the com
plaining witness, is signed only once and
then in the body of the instrument."
Here Mr. Hosmer and Chief Lees both
arose to explain that in Delaware a war
rant for arrest upon a charge such as
the one In hand was considered complete
when it included an affidavit to the effect
that due complaint had been legally
made. It was really Mr. Hosmer who
made tho explanation. The Chief was
pulled back to his seat before he had
further jeopardized the case.
Governor Budd wa? not satisfied and
nsked for an explanation from Detective
McVey. as agent for the State of Dela
ware. McVey explained that in Delaware
a verbal complaint sworn to before a
Justice of the Peace was the custom.
Upon this verbal complaint, he said, the
warrant was issued. The Governor then
Bald that under the constitution he could
not permit the extradition unless either
a complaint, information or indictment
accompanied the requisition. McVey in
sisted that the warrant in hand was also
a complaint, but that no indictment could
be brought until November as the Grand
Jury did not sit until that time.
At this? point Chief Lees broke in with:
"Governor, you can grant us extradition
on this paper, and if the courts back
there declare all this work illegal we can
hold her till November and get an in
dictment." The Chief was quickly pulled
down into his seat by anxious friends,
and the Governor, with a look of amused
surprise, replied that he "certainly would
not stand in to kidnap the prisoner."
Attorney George Knight broke in at
this point and indicated at the start the
one point upon which the defense will
make its fight. Said he:
"Your Excellency, we grant for the pur
pose of argument that these papers are
all right, but there is one admission that
I want from the prosecution. T will ask
Mr. Hosmer whether or not Mrs. Rotkln
has ever been In the State of Delaware."
"In the body, no," answered Hosmer,
"butâ"
"How about the spirit?" suggested the
, Governor.
Here Chief Lees made another futile at
tempt to point the way for Mr. Hosmer:
"That ain't it at all, Hosmf-r." said he.
"We are willing to admit that she has
never been In Delaware, but we will prove
that she's a fugiâ " Again that friendly
hand at the official coattail pulleti him
back to silence.
Hosmer was unwilling to make any ad
missions until Knlerht had admitted that
the papers in hand were correct, but the
Governor answered that the objection to
the complaint was his and he would not
waive It . ââ â
The Governor continued: "Mr, Hoamer,
I see that this requisition says that Mrs.2
Botkin is a fugitive from the justice of
Delaware; has she ever been in that
State?"
This question of pointed significance
perceptibly shocked the prosecution. Mr.
Knight headed off an explanation from
Mr. Hosrner by saying that that was
â what he was trying to talk about, and
that he not only proposed to prove that
Mrs. Botkin was in no light a fugitive,
but also that Governor Budd had no
actual right to consider the requisition
as it stood.
"It is backed up," eaid Mr. Knight,
"by affidavits taken from witnesses in
this city, witnesses of whom Governor
Tunnell knew nothing when he wrote
thut requisition. All that you can legally
deal with is the evidence taken in Dela
ware by the order of Governor Tunnell."
Mr. Knight then took up the allegation
that Mrs. Botkin is a fugitive from jus
tice and after quoting a dozen and odd
authorities he argued that unless a per
son had been actually at the spot where
the crime charged was committed, having
afterward fled outside the State, he was
In no light a fugitive; that a person com
mitting a crime across a State line was
constructively a fugitive from the State
in which the crime was consummated he
denied, and brought numerous decisions
to bear him out.
The fugitive theory was rapidly get
ting to be a warm one for the prosecu
tion to handle, and without help from
any one Chief Lees got up and an
nounced that he had rather discuss the
complaint, as It was the matter of first
Importance, and he asked that a continu
ance be granted until the matter could
be satisfactorily straightened out.
To this Governor Budd replied that un
til a new and proper complaint was re
ceived from Delaware he could not fur
ther consider the requisition. Governor
Budd also required of Detective McVey
that he procure from Governor Tunnell
a written guarantee that, should extra
dition be granted, the State of Delaware
will pay the expense of all witnesses of
the defense to and from that State and
provide for their maintenance while there.
The whole of the afternoon wae con
sumed by Mr. Hosmer, who quoted and
argued from authorities without end, try
ing to substantiate his "constructive
fugitive" theory.
Governor Budd made a number of strik
ing points during the day's proceedings.
He showed that section 77S of the Penal
Code of California provides that had Mrs.
Botkin mailed the box of bonbons in
Delaware and persons were poisoned here
she could be tried in this State. To re
verse the case, he stated. that no law can
be tound in Delaware under which, in the
present circumstances, a person could ue
tried there; consequently, the alleged
poisoner must be tried where the crime
originated.
The section quoted by the Governor
reads as follows; "When the commission
of a public offense commenced without
the State is consummated within its
boundaries, the defendant is liable to pun
ishment therefor in this State, though he
was out of the State at the time'of the
commission of the offense charged. If he
consummated it in this State, through the
intervention of an innocent or guilty
ag* nt, or any other means proceeding dl
rectly from himself, In sucfi case the ju
risdiction iÂ« In the county in which the
offense is consummated."
The Governor also cited another Dela
ware law. He said if a crime begins in
the miiHt northerly county of that State
end is not consummated until the most
Southerly county be reached, it must be
tried in the county where it originated.
The authorities of Delaware are trying to
do the opposite In this case.
If parties in different States enter into
an agreement, the moment that agree
ment is mailed it goes into effect, as once
it Ik placed In the postofTice it has gone
beyond the control of the person sending
it. He can neither recall it nor follow it.
The Governor's wit bubbled over sev
eral times, brightening the somber pro
ceedings. He took exception to the con
struction placed by Mr. Hosmer on a cer
tain legal decision, saying: "I have done
many brash things in my time, but I

LITTLE MISS PARLOW
ON THE VIOLIN
HER AGE IS SEVEN AND HER \
TONE PRODIGIOUS.
An Enjoyable Concert That Should
Have Netted Enough, to Send
Her Back to the Nursery.
Kathleen Parlow, a delicate chit of a
little girl, age 7, played the violin at the
Sherman-Clay Hall last night and cap
tured the hearts and ears of a large audi
ence. As a rule the youngster prodigy is
a nuisance and a bore to the public, and
a reproach to the parent or guardian who
permits it to be out of bed and working.
Of course there are extenuating cir
cumstances in the case of Miss Parlowâ
she is poor and needs the money to com
plete her education and all that sort of
thing. However, this was a second con
sideration last night, for her talent, if
nothing else did, justified her public ap
pearance. She played Sarasate's "Gip
sies," the Bach-Wiihelmi chaconne and
several more or less adult pieces with
prodigious tone and not a little mufll
cianly understanding. Her bowing Is
easy and graceful, and, while fingering
does not always find the easiest means
to an end, it promises tremendous tech
nique when it shall have been better
schooled.
The Pre3S Club quartetâ easily the best
hereâ gave several delightful numbers;
and two of its members, Mr. Coffin and
Mr. Parent, sang solos. The concert was
liberally patronized and altogether en
joyable, and it is to be hoped that It net
ted enough to keep the young violinist at
her studies and off the Btage for some
time to come. 8.

MISSIONITES INDIGNANT.
The Supervisors Urged to Fulfill a
Previous Promise.
At a meeting of the Potrero and Mission
Improvement Club last night the neglect
of the Supervisors In ignoring their
former promise to provide sufficient
money to erect a new county hospital was
severely censured.
A motion was carried authorizing Chair
man T. B. Slevin to appoint a committee
of ten members of the club as a delegation
to wait <>n the Supervisors on Monday and
urge them to embody in the tax levy
$4<H>.ooo for the erection of the hospital as
heretofore announced.
Workmen Entertain.
The patriotic entertainment given in
Odd Fellows' Hall last night by the grand
officers and subordinate lodges of the An
cient Order of United Workmen was a
success in every way. The hall was pro
fusely decorated with the national colors
and the emblems of the order. The stage
was occupied by Past Supreme Master
W. H. Jordan and a number of past grand
officers. Addresses were made by Deputy
Grand Master Danforth, Grand Master
Bahrs and Past Master W. H. Barnes,
after which an excellent musical and lit
erary entertainment was given.
"LEST WE EPRGET."
Professor Jordan on the War and Its
Heritages.
Professor David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University delivered a discourse be
fore the Cymrodorion Society in Cam
brian Hall last night. His subject was
"Lest We Forget." It was a brilliant
review of the martial history of our coun
try, a commentary on the war with
Spain and the many grave responsibilities
it has brought to the people of the United
States. Referring to the late conflict he
eaid that the result was expected; that
it was one of the three great war crises
through which this country has found it
Incumbent to pass.
The war with Spain, he said, had three
Incentives. One for revenge, one for hu
manity and one for expansion of terri
tory. The question which the Govern
ment and the people of the United States
will now have to solve is: What form of
government will be best for the people of
these new lands of conquest? The in
habitants of the Spanish colonies have
not the remotest idea of governing them
in a civilized manner. Hence it will be
come a necessity for our people to re
main in control of these countries until
such time as the Inhabitants gain an
idea of self-government. Otherwise Cuba
would be no better off than are the South
American republics, in which cut-taroats
and thugs rule by the right of might.
In concluding his remarks Professor
Jordan scored the officials in Washington,
who, he said, are responsible for the
needless deaths of so many of the volun
teer soldiers. Incompetency was also to
be found among many of the commis
sioned officers appointed by political Gov
ernors of States, who often selected men
in no way fitted for the responsible duties
they were called upon to perform.
The management of the navy under
competent officers was vividly compared
with "the mismanagement of the army."

SHE WAS DESPONDENT.
Mary McKechnie Swallows a Quan-
tity of lodoform.
The first case of lodoform poisoning on
; record in this city was brought to the at
tention o the Receiving Hospital' surgeons
last night. The victim is a middle-aged
woman, who gave her name as Mary Mc
i Kechnie. Shortly after 9 o'clock she was
â  discovered in a semi-conscious condi-
I tion in a room in the Koster House at
] Third and Howard streets.
Realizing that she had taken poison, the
landlord of the house had her removed to
the Receiving Hospital, where Drs. Wy
more and Graves, after considerab.e
trouble, relieved her of the drug.
To the surgeons the unfortunate woman
said that her husband had deserted her,
and, becoming disgusted with life, sne
purchased 15 cents' worth 'of iodoform and
swallowed a large portion of it. She then
lay down to die, but as the drug did not
act immediately she placed the remainder
in a glass of water and drank the con
tents. She will recover.
Call's Boys Victorious.
An exciting game of baseball was play
ed yesterday afternoon by teams picked
from the mailing rooms of The Call and
Examiner, with "Fatty" Blodes as mas
cot for The Call. Neither side put up
a claim of being professionals, but thero
were plays made that would make the
blood of the most esthetic critic boil and
drive bleachers and grand stand fran
tic; but the game was purely for sport,
and accordingly there were neither grand
stand nor bleachersâ all were equal; the
man who came first got the best standing
up seat. The players were: Call teamâ
Coyle. Lenihan. Raubinger, O'Nell, Wil
son, Lee, Lenihan Jr., Sylvester and Ma
lony. Examinerâ B. McDonald, W. Mc-
Donald, Cambpell, Moore. Johnston, Hast
ings, Baker, Heller and Hern. The score
was 16 to 18 In favor of the boys from
The Call, who accordingly issued a chal
lenge for any time, place or amount.
Washington Associates.
The Washington Associates gave an en
tertainment and dance last night In Lau
rel Hall, Shlels building which was at
tended by a great many of the friends of
members present by complimentary in
vitations. There was an interesting pro
gramme of musical and literacy numbers
and a fine cake walk.

BULLETS FLYING
IN MARIN COUNTY
Revival of a Feud at
Bolinas.
KNIVES, LARIATS AND GUNS
DON PIERSON ATTACKED BY
TWO ENEMIES.
Fights His Way Out, But Is Again
Waylaid â Shots Exchanged in
the Night â Posse Goes to
the Scene.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOLINAS, Sept. 15.â The feud be
tween the employes of the Golden
Crown Milling and Mining Company
and their opponents has again broken
out in a most rabid manner. This time
Don Pierson came to blows with two
of his enemies. Knives were Hashed,
lassos used in genuine cowboy fash
ion and five rifle shots fired.
Sheriff Harrison was summoned from
San Rafael last night In order to pre
serve the peace and prevent bloodshed.
He arrived this morning with several
deputies and placed two of the princi
pals under arrest.
Last evening Walter Masten and
Oliver Longley rode into town on
horses, both men seemingly under the
influence of liquor. Shortly afterward
Pierson made his appearance in a light
wagon. He was called upon by Masten
to "treat" the crowd, which he refused
to do.
"All right," shouted Masten; "then
we'll lasso you!"
As Pierson started out of town Mas
ten and Longley followed and endeav
ored to throw their lariats over him,
but failed. Finally Pierson got out of
his wagon and was pounced upon by
Masten, who had dismounted from his
horse. Pierson knocked his opponent
down and jumped upon him.
Longley dismounted and tried to pull
Pierson off his companion, but was pre
vented by a crowd of bystanders. When
Pierson permitted Masten to rise the
latter pulled a bowie-knife and started
after Pierson. Several cooler heuds per
suaded Pierson to go into Bonati's
store, when the door was closed. In
trying to enter the store Masten broke
the window with his knife, but was
finally persuaded to leave the scene.
Pierson then borrowed a rille and
started for his mine. As soon as Mas
ten and Longley heard this they fol
lowed. They overtook their man near
the cemetery, but he was too quick,
and, getting the drop with his rifle, or
dered them to return to town. They re
tired, but took a circuitous route to
waylay Pierson.
By mischance they failed to intercept
him, but overtook him just as he en
tered the gate of the mining property.
Here five shots were fired, none hit
ting anybody.
Both sides assert that the other fired
the shots, but it is believed generally
that Masten and Longiey fired ilrst and
Pierson simply replied to their bullets.
The two assailants then returned to
town and left shortly afterward for
their ranches. Late at night Pierson
returned to town with an armed guard
and telephoned to San Rafael for Sher
iff Harrison and Attorney Frank W.
Taft. Accompanied by a posse of dep
uties the two reached here this morn
ing. Harrison and two deputies left to
arrest Masten and Longley at their
ranches, while Taft proceeded to the
mine to see Pierson.
This last collision has stirred the
blood of many who had dropped out of
the feud, and they announce their in
tention of entering the arena at the
first opportunity. A clashing of oppos
ing forces or of officers of the law with
one of the factions, with its accom
panying bloodshed, Is expected.
SULTAN COMING
TO NOEL'S TERMS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CANDIA, Island of Crete, Sept. 15.â
An aid-de-camp of Dejevad Pasha
boarded the British flagship last even
ing and announced that he had an im-
portant communication for the admiral.
He said that thirty-nine houses from
which the British troops had been fired
upon had been demolished, arid that 113
of the ringleaders of the disturbances
had been arrested. He added that the
Embassies of the powers at Constanti
nople, in deference to the of the
Sultan, had agreed that the prisoners
be tried by an international commis
sion.
This alleged decision of the Embassies
does not accord with the demands made
by the British admiral, Gerald Henry
Noel, and will increase the difficulty ex
perienced in disarming the Mussul
mans, as It encourages them In the be
lief that the Sultan of Turkey still in
fluences the Embassies of the powers
at Constantinople. It is doubtful
whether Great Britain will consent to
include the outrage on her flag with the
question of pillage and the massacre of
Christians, which are purely interna
tional questions.
Later forty-three of the ringleaders
who have been arrested were delivered
to the British admiral, and it was con
sidered possible that all the terms of his
ultimatum would be complied with
without resistance.
SECOND ANNULMENT SUIT.
A second complaint has been filed at the
instance of George Monnier Sr. and his
wife, Anna Monnier, in an endeavor to
have the marriage of their son, George
Monnier Jr., to Violet Henry, which was
solemnized on March 4, 1897, declared null
and void. The complainants allege that at
thp time of the marriage the groom was
under age and ha.d not obtained the con
sent of his parents. For these reasons,
notwithstanding the fact that young Mon
nier married the girl of his choice and
wished to assume all the responsibilities
of a husband, his parents ask the court to
cast the girl aside.
Lydia A. Hamilton has sued her hus
band, William A. Hamilton, for an annul
ment of their marriage on the ground of
fraud. The plaintiff alleges that in March
of this year she became acquainted with
her husband. He represented that he was
a descendant of Alexander Hamilton of
revolutionary fame; that he was a man of
money and that in far away Buffalo, N.
V., a* prosperous dry-goods business waa
augmenting his wealth. She marrfed him
a month after their meeting, and they
went to Los Angeles on their wedding
tour. On May 3 her husband departed,
and a most thorough search has failed
to establish his present residence. The
most casual investigation, however,
proved that the story of wealth and pros
perity was but a fabric of falsehoods,
and then the young wife realized that she
had been duped. In consequence she asks
for an annulment of her marriage and
the right to resume her maiden name,

OVER THE STATE.

Workers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 15. â The
great success of the reception last night
which the ladles of the California Con
ference gave the presiding Bishop has
marked the beginning of a new era in
the history of this conference, and has
given it a social as well as a religious
and business side. With this innova
tion has come a new feeling among the
ministers, and the usual joviality and
hearty good fellowship that character
izes all gatherings 'of Methodists has
been emphasized since last night, as
was shown upon the assembling of the
conference this morning.
The second day's session of the forty
sixth California annual conference was
called to order by Bishop John F.
Hurst, D.D., L.L.D., at 8:30 o'clock this
morning and was opened with devo
tional exercises conducted by Rev. Dr.
J. N. Beard of San Francisco. At 9
o'clock regular business was taken up
in its usual order. After the reading
of the minutes of yesterday's session
W. W. Case, acting for the presiding
elders, nominated the following commit
tee t/n ministerial qualifications: H. B.
Heacock, J. W. Burton, S. H. Rhoads,
George Clifford, F. D. Bovard, C. H.
Beechgood and R. J. Carroll, and on
motion it was elected for the coming
year.
The second district of the conference,
the Sacramento District, was called
and a full report given by its presiding
elder, Robert Bentley. A prosperous
condition, both spiritually and finan
cially, was to be found in the churches
of his district, the report showed, and
adverse circumstances c-f the past year,
from an agricultural and horticultural
standpoint, made the latter point the
more remarkable. Dr. Bentley espe
cially commended the beautiful church
and parsonage building and improve
ments that had been carried on during
the past year. He also praised the pa
triotism that has been shown by his dis
trict during the war with Spain, a large
number of young members of the
church being soldiers who fought in the
Philippines, while the Red Cross work
of Sacramento City and its neighboring
towns was among the very best in the
State. The effective elde>s of this dis
trict were called and reported their
church finances.
Dr. W. W. Case, presiding elder of
the San Francisco district, one of the
most important in this Btate â embrac
ing as it does the cities of San Fran
cisco and San Joae, the universities of
Stanford and College Park and the re
sorts of Pacific Grove and Santa Cruz â
was then called upon, and gave a splen
did report of the work and condition of
his territory. This being a territory of
between 3UOO and 4000 square miles, em
bracing nearly six counties, it has the
largest membership of any in the con
ference and therefore can do the broad
est work.
A tribute to Rev. T. H. Sinex, D.D.,
of Pacific Grove, who died during the
year, and who has done such magnifi
cent work for Methodism in California,
was a striking characteristic of this re
port. The effective elders of this dis
trict were called and gave their report.
Rev. D. M. Birmingham of this dis
trict was appointed professor of theol
ogy in the Central Tennessee College,
Nashville, Term., and was transferred
to the New York conference. Rev. C.
V. Anthony, D.D., was appointed pro
fessor of practical theology in the Stiff
School of Theology at Denver, Colo.,
and Rev. H. F. Briggs was appointed
professor of New Testament exegesis in
the same school. '
P. Boim, G. Guth, W. Schuldt, L. E.
Schneider and G. Schneider, members of
the California German Conference, were
introduced to the conference, and on mo
tion they and all other visiting clergymen
were invited to seats within me bar or
the conference.
Napa district was next called and re
ported upon by S. G. Gale, D.D., presid
ing elder. This district embraces nine
counties, the various charges being at
great distance apart and it is therefore a
difficult field of work. Dr. Gale reported
five new charges organized during the
year in the district. Throughout his dis
trict church Improvement and the in
crease in Sunday school attendance are
marked.
From Napa district D. A. Hayes was
appointed professor of New Testament
exegesis in the Garrett Bible Institute of
Evanstdn, 111. M. C. Briggs, D.D., was re
appointed State Secretary of the Califor
nia Sabbath Association.
F. J. Masters, D.D., presiding elder of
the Chinese district, followed with an
Interesting annual report of his charge.
During the past year missions have been
founded at San Jose, San Francisco, Sac
ramento, Oakland and Stockton, work in
each being- divided into four departments
âevangelistic, educational, zenana and
rescue. San Francisco is, he said, an
ideal place for the first department, be
cause it is the rallying point for members
of Chinese clans from ail parts of the
"Western World.
A strong portion of the report was that
which dealt with the political side of the
Chinese problem, "we have." said the
reverend gentleman, "in the pust few
months annexed 40,000 Chinese in Hawaii
and 70,000 in Luzon, and this will have a
curious effect on the Chinese exclusion
law. There are over 2000 American-born
Chinese children in San Francisco alone,
and the California bear may growl, but
the American eagle is bound to protect
them. These little urchins in purple and
yellow blouses are born under the Stars
and Stripes and their merry voices mock
the efforts to check Chinese population
by Congressional legislation and close
barred gates. The Chinese are here to
stay, and we must make the best of it."
Then, giving statistics to show the great
power coming to Chinese from American
born Chinese children In future legislation,
he declared that since the "heathen voter
in America is a monstrosity," all effort
should be used to Christianize the chil
dren. In this district Miss Lake's dea
coness work is especially commended, she
having during the year visited each sep
arate tiome in San Francisco's Chinatown
and having done much to rescue the $1,
000,000 market value) worth of women and
girls that have been rescued in the past
twenty-five years.
For the Japanese district, M. C. Harris,
D.D., presiding elder, was called and made
a splendid report. The district covers
Japan and Hawaii, as well as America on
the Pacific Coast. Dr. Harris spoke of
being present at the celebration of the sil
ver anniversary of Methodism in Japan
In June, and outlined the great political
as well as religious advancement of that
empire in the past quarter of a century.
He also described the ceremony of lower
ing the Hawaiian and raising the Ameri
can flag over the palace of the Kameha
mehas, and enlarged upon the wider field
for American workers presented by Ha
waiian annexation. "For," he said, "the
American flag waves over Hawaii as the
BISHOP HURST RECEIVES A "CHAUTAUQUA SALUTE."
symbol of freedom, humanity and Chris
tianity. Hawaii is ours us a way station to
the Philippines, and though but a pin
point on the map. It is a point of tremen
dous importance."
Remarking on the generosity of the Jap
anese toward religious causes, even in
cluding the present California Red Cross
work, their eagerness for education and
its concomitants, he closed with the state
ment that the past year had seen the larg
est number of Japanese converted to
Christianity of any year of Pacific Coast
history.
It was decided to appoint 10 a. m. to
morrow for voting on the question of
equal lay representation in the general
conference, after which the secretary
called the roll nf yesterday's absentees.
A committee consisting of r>rs. John
Coyle, 11. B. Hancock and F. F. Jewell
was appointed to wait on the laymen at
their session to-night.
A resolution requesting the transfer of
Chaplain Potter, T. S. A., from the Texas
to the California conference, was passed
and the session adjourned.
The Woman's x oreign Missionary So
ciety held Its regular conference anni
versary during the afternoon. Addresses
were made by Mrs. A. J. Hanson, Mrs.
Charles Edward Locke, Mrs. Alfred
Kummer and Mrs. Henry Damkroeger,
the latter being in German, Bishop Hurst
translating.
At 7:30 p. m. the ninth annual session
of the California Conference Lay Asso
ciation opened in the Methodist Episcopal
Church H. Morton of San Jose presid
ing. The business of the organization
was gone through with, and officers for
the ensuing year were elected as fol
lows: President, L. J. Norton of Napa;
vice presidents, T. B. Hutchinson, Mrs.
A. J. Hanson and Thomas Hodge; secre
tary, M. V. Donaldson of San Francisco;
treasurer, H. E. Snook of San Francisco.
Rev. E. S. Chapman, president of the
California Anti-Saloon League, delivered
the address of the evening on anti-saloon
work. He began his discourse by saying
that it was the fault of the Christian
people of this State that California was
the third worst rum-ridden State In the
Union. Outlining the plans of the Antl-
Saloon League, he showed how far su
perior this is to all other plans to pro
mote temperance. He declared that no
man in America can be hostile to the
work and purpose of the Anti-Saloon
League without being disloyal to the
flag. In his usual scholarly and forceful
style, ringing with the highest patriotic
fervor, he dealt with the subject that is
so dear to his heart.

Puzzling Trinity County Phy
sicians.
REDDING, Sept, 15.â A case that is ex
citing- the keenest interest among the
medical fraternity of Trinity County is
the remarkable tenacity of life exhibited
by Frank Bartlett, who attempted sui
cide Wednesday morning by firing: a bul
let into his mouth. The ball passed
through the roof of his mouth, penetrat
ed the brain and emerged from the top
of his head. He is able to speak, but re
fuses to say anything pertaining to the
shooting.
From early Wednesday morning until
2 o'clock in the afternoon he laid on his
bed bleeding from the terrible wound.
When discovered he was very weak from
loss of blood. The local physicahis made
an examination of the wound and pro
nounced it fatal. A thirty-two caliber
bail went crashing through the brain, and
that death was not instantaneous was
little short of a miracle. The physi
cians had hopes, basing their conclu
sions on the remarkable fact of the pa
tient being still alive several hours after
the shot was fired, that by the aid of
powerful stimulants they would be able
to sustain life until his brother, the Dis
trict Attorney of Trinity County, could
arrive from San Francisco. Their hopes
were realized. The patient's mother also
reached Weaverville from Oakland to
night.
At 8 o'clock this evening no alarming
change in the patient's condition had
taken place. He is growing gradually
weaker, but is conscious and still able to
talk. For forty hours he has retained his
faculties.

Santa Monica lines are not included in
our purchase.
"No, we will make no changes in the
management. We will have o\ir repre
sentatives on the new Board of Direc

changes."

GRAND PRESIDENT DEANE
REVIEWS THE GOOD WORK OF
THE SOCIETY.
An Evening Devoted to Vocal and
Instrumental Music, Recita
tions and Dancingâ Next
Place of Meeting
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 8.-The eleventh
Grand Council of the Catholic Ladies'
Aid Society closed to-day after four days
session at beautiful Santa Maria del
Mar. The council was called to order by
the grand president, Mrs. Margaret
Deane, who opened the session with
ritualistic prayer. Greetings were read
from Santa Cruz Branch No. 13, express
ing a warm sentiment of fraternal feel
ing. A large number of members from
this branch has been in constant attend
ance at the session of the council.
The nominating committee made Its re
port, and then, there being no opposition.
Grand Secretary Margaret Curtis cast the
ballot. The officers who are to serve the
noble order for the coming year are:
Grand president, Mrs. Margaret Deane
of San Francisco; grand senior vice pres
ident, Miss Marietta Fitzgerald of Gil
roy; grand junior vice president, Miss M.
F. Dorsey of San Luis Obispo; grand
secretary. Miss Margaret Curtis of San
Francisco; grand treasurer, Mrs. Mary
Atkinson of San Francisco; grand deputy.
Miss Mary Garrity of San Francisco.
The election of grand directors caused
the most spirited portions of the ses
sion, as there was opposition and much
friendly debate. The election was by baa
lot and resulted in the following being
chosen for the coming year: Mrs.
Margaret Deane and Mrs. B. McFadden
of San Francisco; Mrs. Logier of Stock
ton, Mrs. M. Smith of San Francisco,
Mrs. Dr. Ragan of San Francisco, Misa
B. Gallagher of Alameda, Miss Schneider
of San Kafael, Miss Emma Russell of
San Francisco, Miss Mollle Regan of
Santa Cruz, Mrs. Pendergast of San
Francisco and Miss Maria Flynn of Oak
land.
After the election the council adjourned
until 1:30 this afternoon, when the matter
of amending the constitution was brought
up and debate was very lively pro and
con. A number of changes were made,
but all of them were of minor impor
tance.
A good portion of the afternoon was
taken up in the installation of officers
elected at the morning session. Mrs. Mar
garet Deane, as past grand president, in
stalled the officers according to the beau
titul and impressive ceremony of the
ritual. She was assisted by Grand Mar
shal Mrs. Molloy of San Francisco.
After the installation of officers and di
rectors Mrs. Molloy installed Grand Pres
ident Mrs. Deane, who then in a few ap
propriate words spoke of the help she had
received from the officers and of the
grand work accomplished In the cause of
charity.
This evening at Del Mar a very enjoy
able time is being spent. Omnibuses are
being run from Santa Crus, and members
of the order and their friends in largo
numbers are spending a most social time.
An informal programme of music, sing
ing- and recitations was given, followed
by d-ncing. ThÂ« lot at S^nta. Maria
Del Mar was raffled, 4Cv tickets being a â¢:>.
This council has done great good to the
society, which dispenses charity without
respect to creed or nationality. It haa
been very harmonious. The most impor
tant matter was that of arranging for
quarterly meetings to be held in San
Francisco, Alameda and San Rafael by
the branches at these places, at which
time reports are to be heard and a social
time enjoyed.
After the close of the session the an
nouncement was made that *85 had been
donated by ladles at the council and $32
by friends toward the debt at Del Mar.
The council will be held next year at
Del Mar. ________________
EVERYBODY AT THE PAUL
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 15.â A glorious
close to Sacramento day was witnessed at
the pavilion to-night. Ten thousand peo
ple made locomotion in the vast builclina; a
matter of absolute discomfort. Ohalrs
were not at a premiumâ there were no
chairs after the first half of the tremen
dous crowd had filed tediously through
the turnstiles. Men, women and children
striiKÃled to get at the ticket windows,
and, finally, when it was found impossible
to move about in the packed entrance
way, lines were formed leading away
from each of the ticket windows far out
vron the sidewalks. Each car added its
full quota to the assembling multitude.
It was an inspiriting sight, for it testi
fied to the loyal regard Sacramento holds
for a State institution which It has fos
tered from the days when the site of the
I present exposition building was a pasturo
i for cattle and the landscape was nn
marked by streets.
To-night's attendance represented a Sac
ramento demonstration in honor of the
State Fair. It was a substantial evidence
that the people take pride in the exposi
tion and are willing to help it whenever
called upon. One director was heard to
remark that in twenty years he had never
seen such a throng at a State fair.

Wilber â Asserts His Inno
cence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Sept. li..â Sheriff Cun
ningham received a. dispatch this morn
ing from Sheriff Simmons of Randolph
County, Ind.. staling- that he had ar
rived at Sacramento with requisition
papers from the Governor "f Indiana
for Charles H. Cudwullader, alias E. H.
Wilber, charged with embezzling funds
of the Union City Bank of Indiana, of
which concern he was treasurer.
Wilber was arrested Saturday morn
ing, the loth Inst., in the oltice of the
California Navigation and Improve
ment Company of Stockton, where he
had been engaged in the capacity of a
clerk and ticket seller. Deputy Sher
iffs Black and Wall made the arrest.
WOber had been in the employ of the
Navigation Company for several months
and was regarded as an efficient man.
When arrested he declared he would go
back to Indiana without any requisition
papers. as he said that he had done
nothing for which he could be placed
In the penitentiary. He begged that the
matter be kept as quiet as possible, and
as Bheriff Cunningham had no proof
that the man was a criminal he acceded
to tht- extent that he kept the fact of
his arrest inside- his office until the news
of i!ir arrival of the requisition papers
at Sacramento was sent out this morn
ing.
On Monday Wilber sent the following
dispatch to Hon. Thomas Shockney,
Union City, Ind. :
Have been hold here since Saturday
Woods and Levinsky best attor
ney.-. Advise me. E. H. WILBER.
Acting on the advice of Shockney
Wilber engaged the attorneys men
tloned in the dispatch. He will not
light the extradition, however. The fu
gitive, who is in the County Jail, de
i to be interviewed this morning.
Since his stay in this city Wilber has
been stopping at the Windsor Hotel. It
is >.iid that the crime was committed
about eighteen months ago, and that
since leaving Indiana Wilber has been
engaged part of the time as the agent
for diffÂ»TÂ«'nt theatrical companies.
INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 15.âCadwal

the collapsed bank.
HORSES SLAUGHTERED
FOR THEIR HIDES
Carcasses of Seventy Animals Found
on Madeline Plains â Work of
a Gang of Thieves.
REDDING, Sept. 15.â Wade Williams, a
cattleman of Likely, Modoc County, brings
a report of the operations of a gang of
outlaw hide-hunters who are killing stock
on the Madeline plains. The carcasses of
seventy horses have been found on the
ranges. The animals had been shot,
skinned and relieved of their manes and
tails. The miscreants market their plun
der by way of Reno, Nov., some of It
being shipped to the East and the rest
sold in San Francisco.
Mr. Williams stated that at Boot Lake
twenty horses had been shot down and
skinned. Stockmen and ranchers whose
places border on this great cattle run
fear that but a Fmail portion of the dam
age hits been ascertained.
The South Fork people propose taking
the most stringent method to rid the
Madeline plains of the offenders. The
watering plact-s are being patrolled by
armed men, und if any hide-hunter should
fall into their hands he will probably be
tn-uted with that short shrift accorded
to horse thieves In pioneer days.

Death on the Experiment
Schooner.
NEW BEDFORD, Sept. 15.â During a
test of Cunningham torpedoes in Price's
Cove this morning the experiment schoon
er Freeman was blown up by the explo
sion of a projectile and sunk. A dozen
men were on board of her at the time, but
all escaped injury. In fact, only two or
I eceived slight scratches.
Lieutenant Holman, of the survivors of
the battleship Maine disaster, and Lieu
tenants Oliver and Marshall, the board of
survey from the Newport torpedo station,
were on board the ship and had a miracu
lous escape. They were standing mar
the place at which the explosion occurred
and were in the midst of the crash of
wreckage which followed. The men were
rescued by a boat.
The cause of the explosion is a mystery,
as two torpedoes were fired without acci
dent yesterday and one this morning. The
projectile which caused the damage was
fired under apparently the same condi-

BUENOS AYRES, Argentina, Sept.
15. â In order to meet any crisis in the
boundary dispute between Argentina
and Chile the Government has ordered
that preparations be made to mobilize
an army of 50,000 men.
The Argentine Minister of Foreign
Affairs, however, has sent a circular to
the diplomatic representatives abroad
declaring that the alarming rumors in
relation to the boundary troubles are
without foundation. Argentina does
not refuse to arbitrate the general
question, he declares, but will not con
sent to the course except in the manner
stipulated by the treaties now in force.
j Chile, however, insists on eliminating
I the words ' "Cordillera de Los Andes"
from the first article of the treaty of
1881.
If this concession should be made the
article would mention only the famous
diverti aquarum and would make it ac
cord with Chilean pretensions. This
Government, however, is resolutely op
posed to such modification.
The attitude of the people is remark
able for its composure. There is no
hostile manifestation of any kind
against Chile. The Minister of Foreign
Affairs, replying to an interpellation in
the Chamber of Deputies, announced
that he hopes for a pacific settlement
of the trouble. He asked the chamber
to maintain its reserve during the deli
cate negotiations. The Minister of War
declared that the country was prepared
for any emergency.

SANTA ROSA. Sept. 15.â Charles Al

many matrimonial adventures have In

the past few months, appeared In Judge
Baldwin's court hi-re this morning to for

the father of the young lady of thiH city

During the examination which followed
Albrecht's identity was established ap

responded exactly, and despite the pro

to have very little weight.
Albrecht was bound over to appear be

RURAL DELIVERY
GAINS IN FAVOR
Postal Service Will Be
Revolutionized.
SANTA CLARA EXPERIMENT
RESULTS ABE PLEASING TO
THE OFFICIALS.
Assistant Postmaster General Heath
Finds the Cost No Greater Than
That of the Fourth-Class
Offices.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â The postal
service of the country will be revolu
tionized if exneriments now being made
by the Postofflce Department are suc
cessful. The -ural delivery recently
established is to be extended over the
entire county of Santa Clara, Califor
nia. Representative Loud, chairman
of the House Committee on Postofnces
and Postroads, represents that coun
ty. Primarily the county was selected
because it possesses all conditions
which are held to be necessary for a
successful test, but the department,
moreover, deemed it wise to have the
test under the immediate supervision
of the man through whom the legis-
lation for the establishment of a free
rural delivery throughout the country
must originate.
First Assistant Postmaster General
Heath has devoted l.iuch time and at
tention to this subject, and believes the
experiments so far made and those to
be undertaken on a more comprehen
sive plan in California will lead Con
gress to take favorable action on the
subject. He is already able to show
that in populous counties mail can be
delivered and collected at each farm
house at no greater expense than is
now imposed in maintaining fourth
class postoffices and star routes in such
counties.
' General Heath says there are some
counties in which rural free delivery
can be operated at considerable saving
to the Government over the present
system.
Superintendent Machen of the free
delivery service leaves for California

OPENING CHINA
TO CIVILIZATION
Radical Change in the
Emperor's Policy.
MANY REFORMS INTRODUCED
POSTAL SYSTEM SOON TO BE
INSTITUTED.
Opening of a National University in
Peking, With Branches in Other
Cities, Has Been Sanc
tioned.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PEKING, Sept. 15.â An edict has been
published extending postal operations
throughout the empire and replacing
thp present system of Government cou
riers.
iae frequent edicts introducing re
forms and cutting down expenditures
prove that the Emperor's advisers are
bent upon a- policy which can only be
the result of a complete change of
opinion. Most of the Chinese and the
old European residents look upon the
change as being too sweeping and ir
ritating to the official classes, but it is
evident the Emperor has decided to
abolish many abuses, and his efforts
are welcomed by all the enlightened
Chinese, who, however, counsel moder
ation.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â Minister
Conger informs the Department of
State that the Emperor of China, by
imperial decree, has sanctioned the
opening of a national university at Pe
king, In connection with which schools
are to be established in the provincial
capitals, and educational institutions
called the third class are to be opened
in the department and district cities.
Graduates of the schools of the third
class may enter the intermediate col
leges and the university at Peking. It
is believed that the curriculum adopted
by the Japanese University will be fol
lowed.
Another dispatch from Minister Con
ger would indicate that the Emperor of
China has taken a long stride in ad
vance in civilization by encouraging the
newspapers of his empire to publish a
truthful and full account of the
daily events, and to be both bold and
fearless in the discussion of current af
fairs. He has, by public proclamation,
made the Chinese Daily Progress an
official organ, and has declared that
articles which appear in Chinese news
papers, though apparently displeasing
to him, shall not on that account be
suppressed.
He has directed that important arti
cles of current events in the leading
papers shall be marked and presented
to him promptly. He assigns in his
proclamation the reason for this that
he desires to extend his knowledge of
affairs, both Chinese and foreign.
NO SERIOUS INJURIES
BY THE TRAIN WRECK
Road Cleared Below Penryn Yester-
day, and Eastbound Overland
No. 3 Proceeded.
AUBURN, Sept. 15 âThe railroad wreck
below Penryn last night was cleared away
this morning. The engines of the wrecked
eastbound overland No. 3 were taken
back to Sacramento, while new ones were
attached and the train went on. Conductor
McMaston, Injured about the head, was
relieved by "Shorty" Leonard of No. 4
westbound as they passed at Penryn. The
two runaway fruitcars that caused the
wreck are still lying on the hillside with
ice and fruit scattered everywhere. It is
estimated that the runaways were gointr
at the rate of seventy miles an hour, and
had not the accident occurred just wheie
it did. on a curve and steep grade, not a
car would have been left on the track.
No serious injuries resulted. Engineer
Newton and Conductor McMaston wore
hadly bruised, and Express Messenger
Willis' ankle was sprained. Mrs. Mary
Allen of Auburn was the only passenger
hurt at all. Engineer Newton had his
arm broken in a wreck occurring about
the same place two years ago.
M'INTYRE SUFFERING
FROM MENTAL TROUBLES
Statement Telegraphed From Denver
Which Naval Authorities Do
Not Believe.
NEW YORK, Sept. 15.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: It was re
ported at the Navy Department to-day
that there was a chance of Chaplain J. H.
Mclntyre of the Oregon escaping trial by
court-martial. The department, in re
sponse to a telegram sent to his address
in Denver, received a reply intimating
that he was suffering from mental
trouble. The authorities do not believe
this, and are going ahead with prepara
tions for his trial.
DISBANDING OF THE SEVENTH
Many Men Beturn to Los Angeles

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 15.â 1t is appar
ent that the Seventh Regiment is now
being quietly and gradually disbanded.
Within the last week or so mn.ny of the
members of the regiment have arrived

loughs amount to discharges. The re

"WINDY AND DISAGREEABLE."
When a man blows wind off his stomach, that is flatulence.
Sometimes people call it gulping *md. No matter what you call it,
the disease, for it is a disease, is an annoying one to you and disgust-
ing to your friends. I once heard a politician speak of a rival, whom
he did not admire, as a flatulent old fool. Flatulent means windy.
Usually we mean by it wind collected in the stomach. Wind in the
intestines may also be just as properly designated flatulence. It is
always caused by indigestion. A physician, who practices in a town
near Albany, New York, reports the case of an old* gentleman who
had been so annoyed by a persistent condition of flatulence that he
had consulted all the doctors in the vicinity without securing any
benefit. " Finally he came to me and I prescribed several remedies
which failed utterly. I then prescribed Ripans Tabules, which he re-
ported gave him immediate relief, and he is now nearly cured. I think
it would be an excellent thing to make a strong feature of ' flatulence'
in all the R-IPANS advertisements, for I find then* excellent in
almost every case of that sort" \

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 11 898.
IF A SLATE
IS ALL READY,
'TIS BRITTLE
Candidates Fear Sat
urday's Primary.
EVERYTHING A GAMBLE
SECOND AND SEVENTH ARE IN
A TURMOIL. .
On the Eve of the Battle Fear and
Anxiety Have Taken the Place
of Former Self-Confl-
dence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 15.
On the eve of the primary there is more
genuine fear and anxiety as to the re
sult among the county candidates than
there has been at any time during the
past two months. Just at the period when
the boasted self-confidence of aspirants
should be most, stable it is fallu^g to
pieces, and timidity, nervousness and
painful premonitions are portrayed on
every candidate's face.
A great deal of talk has been made
about a slate, If there be a slate, most
decidedly the men who might be sup
posed to be upon it are those who are
most fearful of Saturday's battle. In
some wards the candidates perhaps feel a
little less fearful than those in other
wards and townships, but with the ex
ception of the ancient County Surveyor,
who was never known to have an op
ponent, there Is not a candidate upon'
whose chances it would be safe to wager
a dime.
Any combination to be probable must
include the names of Frank Jordan, .Char
ley Spear, James Barber, Oscar Rogers,
Dr. Mehrman, Judge Allen or Harry Mel
vln. P. M. Fisher or 11. \V. Lynch. Yet,
although every man mentioned will tell
you that he has a walkover, they are all
flying around and showing most posi
tively by their frantic efforts that their
boasted confidence has no foundation in
their own minds.
In the Seventh Ward there will un
doubtedly be a hot nght. One ticket is
that of Frank Jordan and Harry Melvin,
the other is that of Robert C. Leckie,
James A. Webster and Dr. Derrick. Even
the most conservative guessers will not
say which ticket is apparently likely to
win.
The Second Ward is torn asunder in
all directions. It Is the largest ward in
the city, and Includes the whole of the
annexed district, more than at the lust
county election, or. Mehrman, for Cor
oner, and P. M. Fisher, for Superintend
ent of Schools, have one ticket; John A.
Sands, who wants to be District Attor
ney; D. C. Hinsdale, for Auditor, and
George Frick, for Superintendent of
Schools have another ticket, which
Judge 1? rick is helping along. Everybody
is prophesying victory, and now there is
talk of putting in an unpledged ticket to
blind some of the other issues.
The Third Ward does not seem to be
any less tangled, even though Judpre Clift
has withdrawn. Judge Allen and Henry
Dalton will have the delegation in their
respective interests, but there is another
and independent contest being fought out
in this ward, having for its object the
patronage of the Public Administrator's
office. Some of the politicians want to
see W. H. Knight reliominated; others
want to see the nomination go to the in
terior, and this particular phase of the
struggle is confined to the lawyers.
E. B. Thompson, an Irvfngton editor,
says that politirs is very warm in Wash
ington Townshin "Complications of
rather n startling character have entered
into the Clark-Lynch fight," said he,
"and the outcome is doubtful. The con
test is between Assemblyman C .ark, can
didate for Public Administrator, and
Harry Lynch, for Superintendent of
Schools. Each will place a set of dele
gates before the voters, and at present
each seems to have a fighting chance."
BEPUBLICANS WILL RALLY.
General W. H. L. Barnes to Formally
Open the State Campaign in
This City.
Republicans will rally at Metropolitan
Temple to-morrow evening to greet that
matchless orator, General W. H. L.
Barnes, who is advertised to deliver ono
of hl6 eloquent addresses on the work of
the grand old party In the" past, prrs'-nt
and future. This meeting will be the for
mal opening 1 of the State campaign In this
city, and standing room will be at a pre
mium. As General Barnes' reputation as
an orator is established it is certain that
many citizens with different party affilia
tions will be in attendance.
Other prominent members of the Re
publican party will speak at the big meet
ing, and many of the candidates nomin
ated by the Sacramento convention will
appear before the assemblage and make
short addresses.
That the meeting will be an enthusiastic
one Is assured. An excellent band will dis
course patriotic airs and some of the lead-
Ing Republican clubs will send large dele
gations.
Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of
the State Central Committee, will call the
mooting to order promptly at 8 o'clock
when the feast of logic and eloquence will
begin.

The Republican County Committee
met last night at Shiels HaH and is
sued a call for a .primary election for
the selection of delegates to the Re
publican municipal ', convention and to
the legislative, judicial and educational
convention of the 1 city and county of
San Francisco. .
T. D. Riordan occupied the chair and
on calling the meeting to order John
Chretien offered the following resolu
tions, which were unanimously carried:
AVhereas, in the present campaign, is
sues of vital importance are submitted to
the people of this State for consideration
and decision; and whereas, the principles
involved in the success of Henry T. Gage,
our candidate for Governor, and the de
feat of James G. Maguire, the Demo
cratic-Populistic candidate, are of such
importance to the commonwealth that it
behooves every conservative citizen, la
borer, merchant and capitalist to interest
himself actively in the work of this, cam
paign; and whereas, the Democratic can
didate claims San Francisco as the source
from which he will endeavor to draw per
sonal success; and whereas, such a de
cisive majority should be given against
him and in favor of all the nominees of
the Republican party as forever to silence
the fallacious doctrines and dogmas of
which he is the promulgator and typical
representative, to which end it is proper
that all Republicans of San Francisco
should contribute an active assistance;
now therefore be it
Resolved, That for the purpose of se
curing a triumphant victory and a large
majority vote in San Francisco for the
nominees of the Republican party, both
State and municipal, the Republican party
of San Francisco organize forthwith, and
that under the auspices of this committee
to be established and organized in each of
the Assembly districts included in this

THEY FUSED WITH
POPULISTS ONCE
Experience of Alameda
Democrats.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 15.
"Fusionâ twice? Not if I know my
self," said Con Brosnahan, chairman of
the Democratic County Central Com
mittee.
Then Mr. Brosnahan went on to tell a
story of the fusion in Alameda County
two years apo. His story referred to the
celebrated night on which Governor Budd
spoke at the Tabernacle, the same night
that George W. Baker, the Silver Repub
lican leader, spoke at Livermore. At that
time there was in existence a club called
the Populist Zouaves, the members of
which wore short baggy pants, loose
blouses and fez, and looked like Turks.
Mr. Brosnahan wanted this uniformed
club to remain in Oakland for the Budd
demonstration, but somehow the Zouaves
were .sent to Llvermrre. There was a
general impression that It was not quite
the thing for a PopuliÃt organization to
escort a Simon-pure Democratic Gov
ernor through OaKland, and the Zouaves
in Bpito of Mr. Brosnehan's protest were
sidetracked.
Mr. Brosnahan now believes that so
, long as fusion does not fuse either be
fore or at election it is a good idea for
the Democratic party to run itself.
"I am going to advocate Democracy,"
said Mr. Brosnahan, "until It either wins
out or is snowed under." And then he
consigned fusion to a distant place.
The Democrats are now casting around
for candidates, and a great many have
been found who are willing to run tho
risk of being beaten. The party evi
dently thinks that the Republicans must
be weak in the matter of the Sheriff, for
Con Brosnahan, Patrick O'Kane, Thomas
Landregnn and Robert McKilllcan have
already been brought forward.
Tom C. Stoddard of Alameda has an
nounced himself as willing to be County
Clerk. Recorder St. Sure of Alameda
would not object to being District Attor
ney. Colonel Tom Garrity has also been
mentioned in this connection. But when
spoken to to-day he said, "Run for office
again? Not I. I have been running quite
a while, and always get within a snort
distance of winning. It is worse than the
Louisiana lottery. It has kept me poor
for four years, and I don't Intend to get
into bankruptcy entirely because of my
fealty to Democracy In Alameda
County."
No Democrat is particularly anxious to
be nominated for Assespor, but there is
a desire to persuade M. J. Laymance to
permit his name to go on the ticket, but
without much hope of success. James
McManus is named for Coroner, and John
M. English may possibly seek to be
be Treasurer.
Charles Heyer may be the candidate for
Supervisor from Mr. Talcott's district,
and Alex Hirschberg may elect to run
from Supervisor Church's district. An
attempt is being made to persuade John
R. Glascock. an ex-Congressman, to ac
cept the Senatorial nomination from his
district. Apparently Democrats do not
think they will stand much ?how in tho
next Legislature, for candidates for the
Assembly have not yet been heard from.
There is considerable opposition to fu
sion on the county ticket, although ex-
Congressman Warren B. English says
that it would soem to be the proper thing
to follow the example set by the party in
State politics. Should the Democrats and
Populists unite it Is Bald that the Pop
ulists will demand the privilege of nam
ing the Sheriff and the District Attorney.
MAGUIRE TO SPEAK
AT THE TABERNACLE
COMBINED PARTIES HAVE THE
MEETING IN HAND.
Candidates for Lieutenant Governor
and for Congrsss Also to Be
Heard.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 15.
The combined Democratic, Populist and
Silver Republican parties have announced
that "Judge Magruire, the foe of monopoly
and the champion of popular rights, will
discuss the real issues of the campaign"
to-morrow night at the Tabernacle. Ed-
ward L. Hutchinson, candidate for Lieu
tenant Governor, and John Aubrey Jones,
candidate for Congress, will also speak.
William P. Lawlor will be the chairman
of the evening.
The commLttee of arrangements consists
of: Silver Republicansâ H. A. Ingalls, H.
A. Ryfkogel and Dr. E. T. Barber; pop
ulistsâF. J. Gregory, C. W. Pangburn,
Burdette Cornell; Democratsâ C. H.
DE YOUNG AS A BOLTER.
Record of the Perennial Candidate for United
1 States Senator.
Has No Regard for the Republican Party Where His Own Personal Wishes
and Decrepit Ambition Are Involved or His Private
Desires Are Dngratified.
The recent assertions of M. H. de Young, proprietor of the Chronicle
and perennial candidate for United States Senator, that he is now and has
always been a stanch supporter of The regular Republican nominees for of
fice has caused much merriment among persons of all shades of political
belief.
It is a well-known fact that De Young has never supported the Repub
lican ticket and that he has been a bolter as often as the opportunity has
offered for him to be one, which was every two years. At the general
election of two years ago he followed his usual custom and bolted the
ticket and suppc. Ed a ticket of his own selection as against the ticket
recognized by the Republican State Central Committee and the Supreme
Court.
Several days prior to the election the Chronicle printed the De Young
ticket in its columns and prefaced it with the following:
THE TICKET TO "VOTE.
The Chronicle this morning prints the names of the candidatesâ and
their voting numbersâ on both general and municipal tickets, whom it re
gards as most deserving of the suffrages of the citizens of San Francisco.
The great number of candidates for the Supervisorship makes the selec
tion of a satisfactory ticket extremely difficult. The voter, therefore, will
do well to scrutinize every name offered, and weigh the merits of the con
testants, even of those included on our Hat. With this caution, and the
additional observation that the list of candidates for the leading municipal
offices here named represent the best timber, we commend the following
ticket:
In order that every one may have an opportunity of judging whether
or not De Young bolted the ticket on that occasion, the De Young ticket, as â¢
it appeared in the columns of the Chronicle, and the regular Republican
ticket are here printed side by side for convenience of comparison. The De
Young ticket is taken from the columns of the Chronicle of November 2, 1896.

Veterans Protest.
A joint meeting of the Union Veterans*
Patriotic League, the Naval Veterans'
Legion of California and the Harrison'
Camp Army and Navy Republican Vet
erans, comprising a thousand members
was heid last evening for the purpose
of participating in the ensuing State elec
tion. Quite a large representation from
each organization was present. S. Smith
called the meeting to order. James M
Sloane acted as secretary. The chair
man stated that a large number of vet
erans throughout the country are becom
ing dissatisfied with the want of consid
eration received from the Republican nar
ty; that the time had about arrived when
they should call a halt. The Republican
party has forgotten that the veterans of
the civil war saved the Union, and now
every pledge made to them is being vio
lated and ignored.

Club held its regular weekly meeting last
night, with E. Thomas in the chair. The

v .MIX AS
A POLITICAL
MESSIAH
Organizer of the Land
and Labor Party.
DENOUNCED THE DEMOCRATS
BARRY AND HINTON WERE
HIS LIEUTENANTS.
Chapter o: Political History Con
tained in a Small But Interest
ing Pamphlet Issued in.
1887.
When James G. Magulre deserted the
Democratic party in liST he probably
had no Idea that in IS9B he would be
come the Populist-Silver Republican-
Democratic candidate for Governor.
Had the contrary been the case he
would" probably not have called the
members and leaders of the party bad
names nor would he have declared, as
he did declare, that he could no longer
associate with those members and lead
ers and retain his self-respect.
One of the reasons that induced Judge
Maguire to shake the dust of the Demo
cratic party from his feet was the be
lief that he had a "call." He believed
that he was the chosen disciple of a
new political religion that was to cure
all the ills to which the flesh is heir.
This party was the Land and Labor
party, and it was by promoting its
principles that Maguire hoped to
achieve greatness.
Judge Maguire made reference to this
new party in his letter declaring his
withdrawal from the Democratic party.
After briefly outlining its principles he
said:
"To the new party founded on these
principles, which I conceive to be the
very soul and essence of true democ
racy, all of the time which I can hence
forth give to the political service of my
country will be devoted."
There is still in existence a small,
paper-bound pamphlet that contains all
that is interesting to know of the party
that once held all the hopes and aims
of the present pinto candidate for Gov
ernor. It was issued early in the year
ISB7 from the printing office of James
11. Barry, the "logical successor of Ma
guire as Congressman from the Fourth
District." On one of the outer covers
of the pamphlet Barry makes public
the fact that he is the publisher of the
"Weekly Star, a journal of progress,
reform and literature." He also an
nounces that it is the "people's paper."
and that it is the "official organ of the
Land and Labor party of California."
In a footnote he says that "cv ./ yearly
subscriber paying in advance will be
prese nte i with a copy of Henry George's
famcue book, 'Progress and Poverty,'
or his latest work, 'Social Problems." "
The front-page announcement is that
the pamphlet contains the "principles,
constitution and pledge of the Land
and Labor party of California." The
contents of the pamphlet are as fol
lows:

PRINCIPLES.
I. What the Declaration of Independ
ence says:
The Declaration of Independence, drawn
in 1776 by Thomas Jefferson, affirms as
follows:
We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that they
are endow"fed by their Creator with cer
tain inalienable rights, that among these
are life, liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness. That to secure these rights gov
ernments are Instituted among men, de
riving their just powers from the con
sent of the governed: that whenever
any form of government becomes de
structive of these ends, it Is, the right of
the people to alter or abolish It and to
institute a new government, laying its
foundation oh such principles and organ
izing its powers in such form as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness.
11. How the present Government vio
lates this doctrine.
We indorse every word in the above de
claration, and declare that the present
methods of administration of national.
State and municipal governments In the
United States are destructive of the ends
which are therein declared to be the
proper purposes of government, becauseâ
FirstâGovernment permits the monopo
lization of land by individuals and syndi
cates, excluding the people from their
natural and rightful ownership of the
means of living, since the land of the
nation belongs to the people or the nation
and their title to it is an inalienable right.
Secondâ Government has permitted the
functions of transportation and communi
cation to be monopolized by artificial per
sons, called corporations, enabling them
to control the production and llx prices of
many necessaries >t life, dictate the pros
perity or destruction of towns, firms ana
Individuals, and thus levy unjust tribute
ui>on the people for the private benefit of
a very few.
Thirdâ Government has otherwise grant
ed to particular persons and combinations
of persons special privileges, above and
LeyonO their general rights as citizens,
whereby they arc enabled to unduly con
trol the legislative, executive and Judicial
departments of the Government, to the in-
Jury of the State and nation, and of the
people thereof.
111. What the Land and Labor party de
mands.
Wt therefore declare that the applica
tion of the following principles to the
affairs of government is absolutely de
manded by the public necessities:
First â That taxation should be
laid only on land values exclusive of
buildings and other improvements.
Secondâ That all poll taxes, road
taxes, license charges on business
(except for the protection of public
morals), and all taxes on personal
property should be abolished.
Third â That specie and paper cur
rency sho'ild be issued exclusively by
the National Government, and that
the present national bank system
should be abolished.
â  Fourthâ That the Government should
assume the ownership and control of rail
road and telegraph lines.
Fifthâ That the Importation of alien
contract labor, and the use of domestic
convict labor in competition with free la
bor are public evils and should be prohib
ited
Sixthâ That United States Senators
should be elected by the direct vote of the
people. Â«
Seventhâ That bribe giVng or taking in
order to influence political or official ac
tion should permanently disqualify the of
fender for the exercise of the elective
franchise, and for holding any public of
fice.
Eighthâ That the importation or immi
gration of Chinese should be prohibited,
and it should be the policy of the State
and the people to discourage the employ
ment of Chinese in any kind of industry.
Ninthâ That the waters of the State
should be the general property of the
whole people, to be held and distributed
under the public authority.
Tenthâ That the ownership of land by
aliens should be prohibited.
It is idle to expect the promotion
of these principles by any existing
political party. Therefore the pro
ducers of the country are impelled to
independent political action as the
Land and Labor party, pledging
themselves and the organization to
secure by every lawful means the
election of officials who shall embody
these principles in laws and shall
carry them into practical effect.

, cure harmony in all its deliberations;
that I will use every proper means
to promote its purpose; that I will

fluence the candidates it may agree
upon for public office, municipal,
to promote its purposes; that I will
licly maintain and defend its men
and measures whenever called upon !
to do so; that on election day I will
work at the polls as directed by the
executive committee, and that I will
keep secret all the private transac
tions of the executive committee and
of the club.
It will be noticed that many of the
gentlemen who at that time associated
themselves with Maguire for the pur
poses set forth in the pamphlet are still
with him and are now either assisting
him to control the affairs of the Popu
list, Silver Republican and Democratic
parties or are themselves candidates for
office. Among the number whose names
are more familiar to the general public
are Joseph Leggett, James H. Barry,
William M. Hinton and Walter (kil
lagher. In ISB6 Hinton was a candidate
for Mayor on the Labor ticket and re
ceived 1435 votes. In the following year
he and Barry and the others joined Ma
guire, the Land and Labor party Mes
siah. Now they are stanch Democrats,
enthusiastic Populists and conservative
Silver Republicans â and are all candi
dates for office.
Dewey Republicans.
The executive committee of the Dewey
Central Republican Club met last evening
at headquarters in the Columbian build
ing. P. B. Gallagher presided. The com

to notify all members to meet at their
clubrooms in order to attend in a body the

on banner, with instructions to procure a
permit to stretch the same across Market

mittee C. C. Morris, J. W. Wadswortn, F.
E. Wallace, James -Gllleran, R. Schleuter,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1898.
WOULD PRESIDE OVER ALAMEDA'S MORGUE.
A Lady, a Doctor and an Undertaker Are in the Contest for the
Office of Coroner Across the Bay.
OAKLAND, Sept. 15.â Miss Bessie Wood of East Oakland believes there should be a female in the Coroner's
office, and it Is not improbable that the young lady may decide to be a candidate for the office. This is not a new
idea with Miss Wood, and the project has during the past two years received much sympathy from the people of
this city. There is always a bitter contest for the office of Coroner, and Miss Wood believes that if a lady entered
the race some of the gentlemen might be inclined to give way to her; but she admits that she has found little chiv
alry in politics. As an inducement to those who might support her, she has promised to give a cardinal necktie to
every juror who may sit on an inquest over which she presides. Her opponents for the office are James Taylor, an
undertaker who says there is so much profit in the business that he could afford to be Coroner and give all the lees
to the Associated Charities, and Dr. ivlehrman, who is out in earnest for the Republican nomination, but who holds
out no bribe, declaring that a laborer is worthy of his hire.
NON-PARTISANS
AGREE ON A
PLATFORM
Stand on a Dollar-
Limit Tax Levy.
A VERY LIVELY SESSION
PUBLIC OFFICIALS HELD UP
FOB CRITICISM.
Delegate Webster Wanted the Party
to Denounce Certain Supervis
ors and School Directors
for Past Acts.
The Citizens' Non-Partisan conven
tion met in the Academy of Sciences
building last night and after a lengthy
discussion adopted the platform pre
sented a week ago. A few minor
changes were made in it.
J. S. Webster made two ineffectual
attempts to have a plank put in the
platform denouncing the Supervisors
and members of the Board of Educa
tion who he considered had betrayed
the pledges given by them when they
were nominated by the party two years
ago. Webster made a persistent fight,
but was outvoted each time.
After the calling of the roll, Chairman
Fitch announced that the first order of
business wo-uld be the adoption of a
platform.
E. J. Le Breton then said that he did
not consider the plank relating to the
pledging of the legislative nominees to
ratify the new charter strong enough.
He believed that all legislative i^spir
antÃ coming before the convention for
nomination or indorsement should be
required to sign a written pledge to
support the charter before their names
were voted upon. After a discussion
lasting over half an hour it was decided
to amend that section of the platform
so as to conform with the ideas of Le
Breton.
The next objection raised was to the
section providing that the tax levy be
fixed at $1 on the $100 on an assessed
valuation of $350,000,000.
Ex-Mayor Ellert was of the opinion
that it would be impossible to keep
within that limit on an assessed valua
tion of $350,000,000. He believed that
the limit should be placed at $1 on the
$100, exclusive of the amount necessary
to be raised for the interest for the
sinking fund and the improvement of
public parks and squares.
The majority of the delegates did not
agree with Ellert, however, and the sec
tion v-as allowed to stand as originally
presented.
Delegate Mahoney next objected to
the pure food section of the platform.
"The expenses of the Board of
Health have been raised from $25,000
to $125,000 a year within a few months,"
said he, "and I do not consider that we
can indorse any sach expenditure. I
believe that we should indorse the
pure food campaign, but not the ex
travagant manner in which it is being
carried out."
Delegates Denicke and Sbarboro
spoke in favor of the section, and said
that while the work of forcing dealers
to sell pure food might be costly, many
lives had been saved, especially those
of infants.
Delegate Cummings believed that the
entire section should be stricken out,
and very broadly intimated that the
pure-food laws were being used for
purposes of extortion.
"It is now a case of pay," said he, "or
be killed if you are in business."
George Center gave it as his opinion
that there were too much extrava
gance in the management of the pure
food department.
"While lam in accord with any
health measure," said he, "I must say
that I believe too much money Is being
spent on the pure-food question."
When the question of striking out the
section was put to a vote, it was de
feated by an almost unanimous vote.
J. S. Webster then exploded a bomb
shell by moving that section 15, endors
ing the administration of Mayor Phe
lan, be stricken out and that the fol
lowing section be inserted in its stead:
The administration of municipal affairs
during the past two years has been a de
plorable failure, due to the violation of
their pledges by the majority of the
Board of Supervisors and the Board of
Education. We especially condemn Law
rence Devany of the Board of Supervis
ors, and Charles L. Barrington, Thomas
Carew and Samuel L. Waller of the
Board of Education, nominees of the
Non-Partisan party, who have proven
false to the trust reposed in them by us,
and who have been conspicuously guilty
with the other members of the majority
of both boards in a shameless disregard
of the interests of the citizens. In strike
ing contrast to their shameful actions,
we warmly commend the manly and hon
est course of C. A. Clinton, Washington
Dodge and John Lackmann of the Board
of Supervisors. We also heartily com
mend the able and efficient administra
tion of Mayor Phelan, In the fearless per
formance of his official duty at all times.
Delegate Cummings at once objected
to the plank.
"We are preparing a platform,"
said he, "and I always understood that
a platform was a declaration of prin
ciples, not a denunciation of men."
"I object to the indorsement of
Washington Dodge," exclaimed George
Center, "for he is a pledge-breaker. If
we are going to mention any names let
us mention all our faithful public ser
vants."
Webster explained that while there
were other worthy officials, his reso
lution only dealt with those who were
nominated by the Non-Partisans.
Ex-Mayor Ellert took the floor in de
fense of Dr. Dodge and indignantly de
nied that the Supervisor from the Sixth
Ward had ever broken any pledges.
Barclay Henley said that he believed
in placing the brand on all unfaithful
officials and those who were recreant
to the trust reposed In them.
Delegates Hallidayand Cummings ob
jected to introducing the resolution as
being made part of the platform, and
finally got a ruling from the chairman
that the matter was out of order. The
original section was thereupon allowed
to stand.
Webster made another attempt to get
the convention to place itself on record
and offered the substitute as a resolu
tion. He was beaten again, for a mo
tion to lay the entire subject matter
on the table was carried without fur
ther debate.
A letter from Mayor Phelan, accept
ing the nomination for Mayor, was
read and a committee of three was
appointed to Invite him to attend the
next session of the convention.
An adjournment was then taken un
til next Thursday nlgrht.
Students' Club Reorganized.
The students' club of the Twenty-eighth
Assembly District reorganized last night
for the coming campaign with fifty new
signatures to the roll. The club has in
dorsed Judge A. B. Treadwell for Police
Judge, and intends to make a strong flgnt
In his behalf. The following officers were
elected: T. S. Cotter, president; P. Deasy,
vice-president; J. Gorham, recording sec
retary; J. Johnson, financial secretary; T.
White treasurer. Executive Committee â
J. Kane. J. Hughes, W. Parker, E. Bar
rett and W. Riley.
Maguire Club Organized.
A James G. Maguire Club was organ
ized at Ocean View last evening. The of
ficers elected were: President, J. T. Den
ahy; secretary, William Cannon; treas
urer, T. Sermatter; sergeant at arms,
William Crane; executive committeeâ S.
Mnrgon, T. Tyne, J. H. McKean, M.
O'Hare and William M. Doyle. Several
speakers addressed the meeting.
A resolution indorsing the candidacy of
James G. Maguire for Governor and R.
A. Thompson for Secretary of State was
adopted.
Cheered for Maguire.
The regular meeting of the Maguire
Club of the Thirty-eighth District was
held last evening at Powers' Hall, Turk
and Pierce streets. Hon. William Craig,
candidate for Congress; Hon. Henry Gos
ford, from the Democratic State Central
Committee, and Charles S. Peery ad
dressed the club, and created the most in
tense enthusiasm. The meeting adjourned
amid loud applause for Maguire and the
State ticket.
Fraudulent Names Expunged.
The Board of Election Commissioners
held a meeting yesterday and ordered
some 300 names stricken from the register
of voters, on the recommendation of Reg
istrar Biggy, who had found them to be
fraudulent. Commissioner Gallagher was
empowered to act for the board in con
sidering another list of several hundred
names which will probably be presented
to-day to the Registrar and formally
stricken out.
The board notified the Merchants' Asso
ciation that it could not guarantee the ap
pointment of j)erpous who were named by
the association for officers of election, but
that its list would receive due considera
tion if presented.

C. N. Hitchcock secretary, assisted by F.
T. Hale. The basis of representation was
ten delegates to each of tne six Assembly
districts in the county, and of these sixty
at least fifty were in attendance. The
Forty-sixth was filled up with Populists
from other districts. TJie platform as re
ported by Dr. J. U. Oberg and adopted re
aflir.nfc the Omaha platiorm of 1592 and
the straight Populist State platform of
July 14, 1898. It favors the enforcement
of all constitutional laws pertaining to
school books and also favors the consti
tutional amendment referring to the
county government act and a curtailment
of all county expenses. It pledges the
legislative candidates, if elected, in favor
of municipal ownership and control of
public utilities; it condemns all those
elected upon the Populist party platform
who have violated their pledges to the
people, especially where they lobbied
against a reduction of salaries, which
they had previous to election so earnestly
espoused, and therefore declares them no
longer representatives of the party.
During the evening a collection was
taken to defray all expenses, ajad $6 35
vas realized.
The paragraph in the platform relating
to salaries Is especially directed at Sheriff
White. W. J. Oglesby, nominated for
Justice of the Peace, is an Afro-American
attorney. F. J. Gregory, chairman of the
fusion county committee, was Invited to
a seat on the platform, but positively de
clined. Under the ruling of Secretary
of State Brown, the party claims it will
not have any difficulty in- getting on the
ticket.
MAGUIRE VISITS HIS
WATSONVILLE HOME
Given a Splendid Reception by Men
of All .Parties â Trouble in ti-e
Fusion Camp.
WATSONVILLE, Cal., Sept. 15. -This
was a great Democratic-Popunst day for
Watsonville. The Populist and Demo
cratic conventions met during the day,
and James G. Maguire and E. L. Hutchi
son held forth at the opera house in the
evening. Some time ago fusion com
mittees from the two county committees
were appointed for the purpose of effect
ing fusion. To-day their report was sub
mitted. The Democrats readily adopted
it, as they secured the bulk of tne patron
age offices. In the Populist convention
there was a protest on Its adoption, but
the report was finally adopted, and as a
result one-third of the convention bolted.

MOGUIRE AND THE ORMY.
IT is still remembered that at the outbreak of war
with Spain Judge Maguire denounced the first acts
of the navy as no better than acts of piracy. He
was not sustained in this view by the public, and
later the courts decided him to be wrong. An ex
planation became necessary, and the Judge explained.
It was a remarkable effort. It simply deepened the
insult originally given. There was in it no note ot
apology and better for him had he kept silent than
opened his mouth and therein again tiirust his foot.
But a slur on the navy was not enough for Ma
guire. He has enlarged his view so a* to take in
the army as well, and from his ready tongue has
come abuse for part of the gallant force which fought
so valiantly amid the dangers of tropic Cuba. To
be sure, he said a word for the soldier, but upon the
War Department and army officials he pronounced a
verdict of "guilty" as to the charges of neglect and
incompetency. Who constituted him the tribunal?
By what means does he know there is truth in the
accusations? Many of these, most of them, come
from papers notorious for their venom and untruth.
As a matter of fact, Maguire talks in this fashion
because the struggle so brilliantly waged, and so soon
leading to triumph, honorable and complete, was
under the direction of a Republican administration.
He ignores the truth that an investigation has been
ordered; that the President, not content that rumor
should go unchallenged, has asked that representa
tive citizens of every party act as a committee to
ascertain where blame should rest, if blame there be.
No one is to be shielded. If there has been negli
gence and incompetency the names of the culpable
will be proclaimed, and by the very administration
which Maguire slanders.
This is a Republican year, and partly so by the
victory of our arms. It is a poor time to decry the
ability of the men who directed the war, or clamor
for the very evidence which the administration has
undertaken to secure, openly, fully and for the pur
pose of giving it to the world.
A DUTY OF PARENTS.
A STRIKING illustration of the extent and de
gree of the public interest in the problem of
protecting our common school system from
the domination and contamination of political bosses
is shown by the fact that the revolt of the pupils of the
San Jose High School has attracted attention and
won approving comment not only throughout Cali
fornia, but in the Eastern States. It is everywhere
recognized that while the contest is local, the issue
is national, and that the boys and girls of San Jose
are fighting a battle in which all Americans are more
or less concerned.
The Philadelphia Inquirer, after a review of the sit
uation in San Jose and a fair statement of the causes
that led up to it, says: "If this method of rebuking
recalcitrant or criminal School Boards were to be
come more popular the public would have far better
service than they have in some places at present.
There is too much carelessness in the way parents
hand over their most sacred duties, the education of
the young, to incompetent politicians."
This statement of the responsibility of parents with
respect to the management of the schools to which
their children are sent to be educated is not open to
any charge of exaggeration. There has been in all
American communities too much carelessness on the
part of the parents in such matters. San Francisco is
as justly subject to this reproach as any other city in
the Union. Here, as elsewhere, a profitable lesson
can be learned from what has been accomplished in
San Jose by the aroused conscience of parents toward
public school management.
In most cities and counties in the United States the
larger part of local taxes are levied for the purpose of
maintaining schools. There is therefore an important
monetary as well as educational interest involved.
Citizens should see to it that they get for their money
that for which the money was paid. A people who
know their rights, and have sufficient self-respect to
assert them, will not permit the money they pay for
the support of schools to be diverted to the support
of the henchmen of political bosses.
As the Baltimore American says: "To make the
child the victim of politics is about the meanest crime
a community can commit, and it must be remembered
that at the end of the argument the child is the vic
tim. A political public school system, therefore, is a
double robberyâ it robs the parent, who gives the
money, and it robs the child."
The case of the spoliation of the San Jose High
School by the bosses of that city is an extreme one,
and it is not necessary that other communities should
resort to the drastic remedy undertaken there, but the
spirit that prompted the resort to that remedy is one
that it would be well to see everywhere aroused.
What has been done at San Jose has, therefore, been
widely beneficial. It has recalled popular attention to
the important issue at stake, and is felt as an incentive
toward action for the protection of the schools in al
most all sections of our widely extended Union.
Gomez is said to have resigned, but he doesn't feel
that way.
DE YOUNG'S ABSURD AMBITION.
IN the course of what he calls a "dignified" edi
torial Mr. M. H. de Young yesterday protested
against our expose of his designs upon the Fed
eral Senatorship. He feelingly deprecated the intro
duction of "personalities" into the campaign, es
pecially when they refer to himself and the plans of
his political bureau, arrogated to himself the right
to keep his secret thoughts dark when he wishes, de
clared that The Call exists only for the purpose of
venting the personal spites and wreaking the indi
vidual vengeance of its proprietor, and emitted a few
salty tears over the disastrous effect which the dis
ruption of his Senatorial plans (to his mind) will
have upon the party and its ticket.
In an interview in the Examiner Mr. De Young is
reported to have asked: "Why do The Call and Ex
aminer oppose me? Because they know there is a
growing feeling throughout the Mate for De Young
for United States Senator. I met a banker the other
day who said that four years ago he would have
opposed me for the Senate, but now he is ready to
vote for me. The same story comes to me from all
over the State. But I am not a candidate. I have
no money to give out or put into any political fights
â not a postage stamp. I worked too hard for it to
give it away in such fights."
The inconsistency of Mr. De Young's reply to our
charge that he is a candidate for the Senate, and, not
daring to appear boldly in the open, is making a still
hunt for legislators, may be stated in a few words:
Large numbers of people want him to run for Sen
ator, but he is not a candidate. We, being aware of
the public demand for him, oppor<e him for personal
reasons.
Mr. De Young is mistaken, however, in assuming
that our opposition to his candidacy is personal. We
beg to assure him that it is based upon the highest
and most patriotic of grounds. In the United States
Senate we know that he would not represent the State
of California; we know that he is conceited, selfish
and unpatriotic; that he desires the Senatorship
solely for the purpose of self-glorification; that he is
regularly attached to the Southern Pacific political
bureau; that Mr. Huntington is assisting his absurd
ambition in order that he and his ridiculous paper
may be kept in line; that, notwithstanding what the
banker told him, or what he hears from the country,
the people do not want him; that a Republican Leg
islature cannot be elected if it be known that he is a
candidate for Senator; in short, that as a member of
the Federal Senate he would be for himself and Hun
tington and against California.
There is nothing personal in all this. On the con
trary, knowing these things, in opposing De Young's
aspirations we are simply discharging a bounden
public duty. Every intelligent Republican in the
State knows that what we have said and what we are
now saying with reference to this subject is true.
Mr. De Young is a candidate for Senator, and he is
making a still hunt for the office. Why should this
be kept from the people? Is it good politics, or will
it aid the election of Republican candidates in State
and city to conceal so important a fact from the rank
and file of the party, when the result, in the event of
discovery, is certain to be so disastrous?
Does Mr. De Young desire proof that his political
agents are informing aspirants for legislative nomi
nations in this city that the only condition on which
they can obtain them is that they will pledge them
selves to vote for him for Senator? If he does we will
furnish it without delay.
Our purpose in this matter ought to be plain even
to an understanding as obtuse as that of Mr. De
Young. In announcing his secret candidacy for the
Senate we have merely desired to force him into the
light. Why should he be permitted to footpad the
Senatorship? Mr. Gage is compelled to appear be
fore the people; so are all the other candidates. Is
Mr. De Young especially privileged to programme
legislative delegations while keeping in the dark his
designs on the Senatorship? We do not think so.
If Mr. De Young want the office let him take the
stump and fight for it. That is the honorable and
manly thing to do, and we violate no confidence when
we say that under no other circumstances will he
get it.
THE COMMON DUTY OF ALL.
THAT all persons having considerable dealings
with Wells, Fargo & Co. feel gratified by the
resolute action of William E. Costley in resist
ing the aggressions of the corporation is a matter of
course. No doubt many of them will extend to Mr.
Costley their thanks for what he has done, and will
assure him of their best wishes for his speedy success
in the contest.
All such thanks and wishes will be right and proper
provided they do not end with words. In matters of
this kind where the whole public is concerned there
should be something like universality of action. It
was by combination that the newspapers of San Fran
cisco compelled the corporation to back down from
the attempt to force them to pay the tax which Con
gress had imposed upon the revenue the corporation
derived from its newspaper patrons. A similar com
bination among merchants and other shippers would
have the same effect. The company can afford to
fight one man. It would not persist in its extortions
if it found itself resolutely opposed by the whole city.
The course taken by Mr. Costley should be taken
by others. The Chamber of Commerce might well
revive at this juncture its movement toward making a
test case against the company in the courts. It is now
manifest that the assurance given that the question
would be settled speedily by a test case raised in the
East was a trick of the corporation to obtain delay;
what the church-going president would call a "pious
fraud." Time has passed and the corporation has ex
torted large sums from the public and continues to
do so. A fight should now be made all along the
line. The suits should be multiplied. There is such
a thing as skinning a fraud of its pious covering and
forcing its votaries to abandon it.
Some more straw bonds have been accepted in the
Police Court. There has not yet been added the in
formation that the straw bondsmen have been ar
rested, although the prisoners have vanished and the
straw bondsmen are doubtless known to the po*lce.
If the subject were not as old as the Police Courts
one would be tempted to ask the reason for all this.
Even in times of peace the Oregon and lowa are
useful. One day they supply the opportunity for
sending a report that they are going to Manila, and
the next for denying it, all of which is of course in
teresting.
It is pleasing to learn from the Report that that
ever modest paper is responsible for the project of
making a vice-admiral of Dewey. It is beginning to
be suspected of having been responsible for Dewey.
There can be no doubt but the stories of some of
the tardy witnesses anxious to project themselves
into the Botkin case will be regarded as inspirations.
It would seem that the Governor had been expend
ing some preliminary thought on the matter of extra
dition.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1898.
SO many fads in sociology have been sprouted
recently and have grown when watered by the
crocodile tears of political demagogues that
the aims of anarchy have been obscured. Judge Ma
guire's speech in Congress against the bill to ex
clude these assassins from this country has done
much harm in -misleading public opinion concerning
them.
Maguire declared them to be the Democrats of
Europe, intelligent and educated people, very desir
able as immigrants and worthy to be welcomed to
this country.
From an ignorant man such an indorsement of
anarchy and anarchists might have been excused, but
as the Judge has informed The Call by letter that he
is a scholar and a writer of eminence, we are com
pelled to assume that his indorsement of anarchists
and his desire to invite them to the United States are
due to his belief in their principles, of which he can
not be ignorant. The principles of anarchy, as often
declared by them and asserted by Karl Marx, who
incorporated them with the Internationals, require
the destruction of all government. Their venom is
against republics as well as against constitutional
monarchies and autocracies.
They assassinated the Czar of Russia and the Presi
dent of France, Prime Minister Canovas of Spain and
Elizabeth of Austria, representing every system of
civilized government. They did these murders, all
of them cowardly, not because of hatred of any
special form of government, but to destroy all gov
ernment by murdering in succession all who repre
sent it. The President of the United States is con
demned to death by their principles equally with the
Czar. Their plan, often stated, is to make govern
ment impossible by killing all officers who represent
it. They believe that finally no man will dare repre
sent government, law, order, and that these will then
disappear from the world, and men will live without
law.
They began their cult long before their creed was
publicly known. The murders they have committed
during this century are not confined to the ,royal per
sons and others representing government whom they
have attacked. Scores of others have been killed in
such affairs as Orsini's attempt to kill Napoleon 111
and the bomb-throwing in the French Assembly. In
this country we have had but one outbreak, the mur
der of the policemen in Haymarket square, Chicago,
for which several were hanged, one committed sui
cide and the rest were sentenced to prison for life and
were pardoned by Governor Altgeld, who seems to
believe with Maguire that these anarchists are the
Democrats of Europe and desirable people to have at
large in this country.
Every one who believes in institutions, who knows
that civilization cannot exist without government and
that civilization is worth preserving, regards these
cowardly murderers as enemies of the human race.
When they are arrested and their records are traced
in nearly every case they are found to have lived in
violation of the moral laws. They have been thieves;
they have defied the marriage laws; they have been
untrue to their obligations as sons, husbands and
fathers. In their records is an awful warning to the
world of the conditions to be expected if they could
murder fast enough to destroy government and abol
ish law, for they live in defiance of virtue, honesty
and honor. They must not be confused with the so
cialists, who teach virtue and benevolence and peace
and abhor bloodshed. The anarchist stands by him
self, a sworn murderer. The only literature of
anarchy is to teach murder as the first and highest
duty of the anarchist.
Their latest exploit, the cowardly murder of a de
fenseless old woman by stabbing her in the back, is a
perfect illustration of their principles. The wretch
who did it glories in it and will be toasted and cele
brated as a hero by anarchists all over the world.
This bloody event brings into sharp relief the prop
osition to elect as Governor of California Judge Ma
guire, the only man who ever advocated in Congress
the desirability of anarchist immigration to the
United States. In view of his record in this respect
it is no injustice to him to suggest that his election
would be celebrated by anarchists as an event scarcely
second in importance to the murder of Elizabeth of
Austria.
WITH PROFIT TO THE NATION.
ALL authorities on the naval operations of the
war agree that an immense service of great
value was rendered to the nation by the four
ocean steamers â the St. Paul, the St. Louis, the New
York and the Paris â which were chartered by the
Government and put to use as auxiliary cruisers in the
operations in the West Indies. With the exception of
the battleships that took part in the actual fighting
no vessels in the navy were charged with more im
portant duties or performed them with greater effi
ciency.
The profit which the Government has thus derived
from these steamers in the time of the nation's need
completely vindicates the policy under which the
steamship line to which they belong has been built
up. It is a policy adopted by Great Britain, France
and Germany before it was tried here, and has been
as profitable to those empires as to our republic. It
is therefore one which has been fully justified by its
results wherever tested, and should be included
among the policies which the nation will not only
continue to enforce, but will expand as rapidly as
possible.
The American liners, like the British, French and
German mail steamers of the larger class, are granted
a certain annual subsidy, not only for carrying the
mails, but as a retainer for their use as naval auxil
iaries in case of need. When it was proposed to fol
low the European plan in this respect, and thus bring
about the establishment of a great American line of
steamships, the object was violently opposed by those
who always object to everything that tends to the
upbuilding of an American merchant marine. It was
said at the time by the objectors that the nation would
never have any use for the ships, that the subvention
given them wouW be money wasted, and that the
scheme was a job to enrich the few at the expense of
the many.
It is not likely after the experience of the recent
war that such objections to the advancement of our
ship-building and ship-owning interests will be urged
again during this generation. The four ocean grey
hounds demonstrated their value to the Government
too clearly to be disputed. It is recognized by all
authorities that the navy would have been heavily
handicapped without them, as the high rate of speed
of which they are capable rendered them almost in
valuable in the performance of certain forms of work
in the strategy- of naval campaigns.
Experience having thus made it certain that the
nation has derived a profit from the policy of pro
moting the building of American steamships, there
should be no longer any hesitation on the part of
Congress in extending the system so auspiciously
begun. An American merchant marine is one of the
essentials of the coming expansion of American com
merce and American industry, and the sooner we pro
vide for the one the prompter will be the profit of
the others.
THE ANARCHIST CULT.
STEPHEN T. GAGE, HENRY T. GAGE AND THE RAILROAD.
OROVILLE, Butte County, Cal., Sept. 13. IS9B.
To the Editor of The San Francisco Call: A great many people In this see'
tion seem to think that the nominee for the governorship on the Republican
ticket is Stephen T. Gage, the old warhorse of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Would you kindly inform me through the columns if your worthy paper if Mr.
Henry T. Gage, the nominee, is a relative of Stephen T. Gage and if he has
ever been connected in any way with the Southern Pacific Railroad? I have
maintained stoutly that Henry T. Gage has no connection whatev. ' with either
the Southern Pacific or "My dear Stephen." Am I correct?
AN OLD REPUBLICAN.
You are right. The Republican candidate for Governor is not Stephen

MONEY TALKS AT A BANKERS' CONVENTION
The California Bankers' ..association be
gan its sixth annual convention yesterday
in the rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce and conducted its business with
such dispatch that it is believed that the
convention proper will be concluded by
noon to-r 1 "- To-morrow the bankers will
make an excursion to the top of Mount
Tamalpals, where they are to partake of
a fine dinner. At yesterday's gathering
Vice President J. M. Elliott of Los An
geles presided, President J. J. Valentine
being absent. The address of welcome
was delivered by Mayor Phelan, who dis
cussed the situation of financial circles,
and expressed the belief that with the
closing of the present war business * in
general will take an upward start again.
The address was replied to by Mr. Elliott,
who spoke of the necessity of the enact
ment of more laws favorable to banking.
The annual address of President Valen
tine was read by the secretary, in which,
after expressing regret for his absence,
he said:
The monetary system, so called, of the United
States has long been a reproach, nut to say
scandal, to both the Intelligence and business
honesty of the country. For years past It has
staggered under no less than ten different forms
of money, with variable functions, including a
heterogeneous mass of old war-time devices
adopted as temporary expedients to meet ex
traordinary emergencies. â¢ â¢ â¢ It will not be
necessary here to dwell upon the Intolerable
embarrassments that have been inflicted upon
the business of the country by this condition
of things. business men and organizations
have been protesting against it for yeara and
pleading for relief, but in vain. â¢ â¢ â¢
H-.u the financial panic of 1893 seems to have
at .ast aroused the country to a sense of the
inhtrent dangers of our present monetary ag-
Kli'iiu'ratlon, and Congress has now beconte
very much In earnest In its efforts to effect
a radical and lasting reform. To this end a
bill was Introduced some two years ago pro
viding for the appointment by the President
of a non-partisan commission of eleven busi
ness men which should take under considera
tion our entire monetary status and its rela
tions to the financial and fiscal operations of
the Government and formulate a thoroughly
consistent and logical system which would ex
clude the dangerous elements at present exist
ing, and which have so long been a constant
menace to our monetary stability and national
credit. â¢ â¢ Â«
Mr. Valentine then gave a detailed ac
count of the efforts of boards of trade,
commercial bodies and financiers to have
the monetary system straightened out, of
the several bills presented to Congress
and their failure to pass, and of the bill
presented by the sub-committee and now
before Congress. This measure Is en
titled, "A bill to provide for strengthen
ing the public credit, for the retirement
of the demand obligations of the United
States and the amendment of the laws re
lating to national banking associations."
Mr. Valentine considers this the best
measure yet presented to Congress. He
recited the many advantages of the meas
ure, and in conclusion said:
One of the essential purposes of the bill Is
to relieve the I'nlted States treasury from the
burden of the constant redemption of Govern
ment paper mon^y, and to obviate the neces
sity of selling interest-bearing bonds running
for a long term in order to obtain gold for the
continued and repeated redemption of notes
under the present status. The foregoing Is a
brief summary of the chief features of the bill.
Doubtless it Is Impossible to frame a measure
of this kind that would suit any one in every
particular. Even we of our own association,
representing only one section of the country,
would differ among ourselves as to details, and
perhaps, also, as to some principles. The diffi
culty of securing an agreement of business
interests all over the land on what is essential
In currency and banking reform is known to us
all. The bill combines the most important
principles to be followed In the revision of our
monetary legislation, those in regard to which
thinking minds are almost unanimous, in a
â¢form politically feasible. It practically retires
the greenbacks, but without the Issue of bonds;
It maintains the parity of all our moneys, while
giving a larger scope to the legitimate use of
silver; it affords an opportunity In this coun
try of testing bank circulation based upon gen
eral assets, but makes the banks assume, in
return, the burden of the current redemption
of Government notes; above all. it is the most
direct recognition we have yet hnd of the fact
that all our money Is, and must be. based upon
the gold standard â at the same tlmp, through
branch banks- and a reduced minimum capital
ization, furnishing sparsely settled districts
adequate provisions for their need of capital,
thus silencing the alarmist cry of "contraction"
where it has hitherto reached too credulous
ears.
From the standpoint of sound money, the bill
is the he^t that has been presented to Congres,
and yet It concedes more than any of the others
to the honest Inflationist, whose real need is
Improved banking facilities. As Chairman
Hanna says: "Every advocate of change In
our currency laws, and every citizen and busi
ness man who seeks safe and stable things In
finance, should Immediately recognize the vital
Importance of complete support of this measure.
It is a great step forward."
In conclusion: Under date of August 29, the
press dispatches from New York reported as

I was hotter than a hot day in Cuba. I
asked this descendant of the gods if he
knew that he was in my room and told
him the quicker he removed his fat shape
to, another part of the car it would be to
my liking.
He rose up to his full height and said
in broken English: "Young man, I haf

With this declaration he handed me a
card. Of course I was pleased to meet a
nice, big-mustached Baron, but I also
wanted my drawing room for my own
comfort. I politely told him that it may
be the custom in Europe to rush for the
best part of the carsâ they have compart
ments, you know â but here each man gets
a section and must not wander therefrom.
The fellow looked furious and refused to
surrender. The conductor, a half dozen
porters and as many passengers feared
trouble, and they all began to explain at
once. It took a long time to appease that
German aristocrat. We fixed him, but not
until he threatened vengeance. The next
morning he apologized, but he said it was
a " bad system," and this country
was "something wrong, anyway." But
that isn't the joke. I want to know
what became of a small parcel of some
value that I had in one of my satchels
before that gentleman of foreign blood
dropped into my stateroom."

BROKER FRED HARPER
GRAVELY ACCUSED
SHARP PRACTICE ALLEGED IN
A PASTER'S APPOINTMENT.
Harry Browne Charges That the
Broker Sold Him a "Gold
Brick" in the Appraiser's
Store.
H. R. Browne, paster In the Appraiser's
building, has Instructed Haven & Haven,
his attorneys, to file suit against Customs
Broker Frederick F. G. Harper to recover
$2700, which he alleges Harper received
from him under false representations.
Browne's story is that a little more than
three years ago he entered into an agree
ment by the terms of which Browne was
to succeed Harper's father 'as paster.
Harper representing that he owned the
business and that no one else could come
into the Appraiser's building and do any
stamping except Harper or his assigns.
Browne was to pay $1200 cash and halt of
the proceeds of the business until the fur
ther sum of $1500 should have been paid.
On November 2, 1897 the following bill
of sale was given by Harper to Browne:
For value received I do hereby sell and con
vey to Mrs Agnes Browne the whole of my
former business of affixing Internal revenue
stamps to cigar?, snuff and tobacco sent to the
UnUed States Appraiser's *Â£ r^ fo^f I '
Per F. F. g'. HARPER?
Mrs. Browne is Browne's mother, he
being a minor at that date and not quali
fied to enter Into a contract X. . Â±i.
Harper was the father of Fred Harper,
and was dead at the time his name was
signed by his^son. Browne says that
three weeks ago* he discovered that he had
bought a gold brick and that any one had
a right to go into the Appraiser's store
and stamp his tobacco.
Collector Jackson said that when the
stamp regulations went into effect many
years ago there was much confusion on
account of the large number of persons-
Chinese and othersâ who crowded into the
store for the purpose of stamping tne
goods. Hence, the tobacco importers were
requested to appoint a man to do their
stamping for them, they to pay him for
his services. Harper's father was select
ed by the importers, and the Collector
holding the office at that time appointed
Harper a laborer without pay. Mr. Jack
son said that he 'knew nothing about the
relations between Harper and Browne.
Browne said that after he had made the
agreement with Harper the latter circu
lated a petition among the importers ana
induced them to recommend Browne for
the place vacated by the death or the
elder Harper. Browne added that he used
to do certain other work for Harper and
divide the fees with Harper, and that this
work of right should have gone to
Swayne, Hoy t & Co., of which Harper is
a member. It was rumored around tne
Custom-house yesterday that Swayne &
Hovt, learning of these things from â 
I Browne and certain clients, took Harper
! to task last Monday and that a rupture
iin the firm was the result. .
Swayne. Hoyt & Co. would not speak of
l the matter, and Harper declined to make
I any statement beyond the fact that what
ever he had done in the affair with
Browne was right and that Browne had
no case. _ '_ ' .

changed their plans last night, and instead
of evacuating all the suburbs of the city,
as General Otis ordered, they moved from
Ermita and Malate to Santana, where they
appear to be concentrating in strong force.
It is reported, although it is not con

Obstacles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 15.â Henry T.
Gage received an ovation at the hands
of the Republican County Convention
to-day. He appeared on' the conven
tion floor, and as soon as the delegates
and spectators became aware of his
presence they arose and with hearty
cheers manifested their regard and en
thusiasm. Mr. Gage was deeply moved
by the demonstration, and in response
to a general demand he took the plat
form and briefly addressed the conven
tion.
His speech was extemporaneous and
covered only a few points. After
thanking the convention for the honor
accorded him he congratulated the del
egates upon the personnel of the ticket
they had nominated. He said:
"I am pleased, indeed, that you have
indorsed the San Pedro harbor propo
sition. I have for years battled to
bring about that improvement. If I
am elected Governor no man will be
United States Senator, if I ran prevent
it, who is not unqualifiedly in favor
of it."
At this Juncture a v.oice from the
delegates said:
"Yea, Henry, and you are going to be
Governor."
To this Mr. Gage replied: "I hon
estly believe that 1 will be, but whether
I am or not, I wish to deny the charge
and the insinuation of my opponent
that I am a tool of any railroad or
other corporation. You who have been
my friends and neighbors for years
know that charge to be a lie."
Loud cries of "Yes, yes: 11 went up
from all over the hall.
Mr Gage did not attempt to enter
into any discussion of campaign issues
further than to uncover some of the
fallacies of Judge Maguire's single-tax
ideas. Thanking the convention, he
left the platform amid a storm of ap
plause and three rousing cheers which
the delegates gave with hearty good
will. , .
The convention about concluded its
labors to-day. It made almost an en
tirely clean Bweep of the Courthouse.
Every official in it was a Republican
and nearly every one of the incumbents
wÂ»Â« a candidate for renomination. But

FOR FURTHER TIME
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15.â General
Otis to-day cabled the War Department
as follows:
â¢â MANILA, Sept. 15, IS9S.â Adjutant
General, Washington: Affairs are much
more satisfactory. Demands for the
withdrawal of the Insurgent forces com
plied with and all withdrawn or with
drawing to-day except small forces in
outlying districts, which are not obey
ing the insurgent leader. Aguinaldo re
quests a few days in which to with
draw them by detachments and to pun
ish their commanding officers. Over
2000 are already withdrawn. No con
cessions were granted the insurgents,
but strict compliance with the demands
of the Bth instant was required. Gen
eral good feeling is prevailing. Manila
is quiet and business progressing fa
vorably. No difficulty is anticipated.
Have been compelled to confine the
Spanish prisoners temporarily within
the limits of the walled city.
"OTIS, Commanding."
the convention was against the propo
sition of a second term for anybody.
The delegates made nominations on the
theory that a four-year term was long
enough for any man to fill any office
as principal, so not one incumbent has
been renominated.
Alexander Caldwell was named for
Assessor, defeating John W. Hlnton
and F. Edwards Gray.
Mark G. Jones was nominated for
Treasurer, defeating T. J. Fleming, in
cumbent.
John H. Strine of Pasadena was
named for Superintendent of Schools,

bent.
C. G. Kellogg was nominated for Pub

From the Devastated Islaods an Urgent Ap

Fortb,
LONDON. Sept. 15.â The dispatches
received at the Colonial Office from the
British authorities in the "West Indies
indicate that, as a whole, the earlier re
ports of the havoc wrought by the hur
ricane were not exaggerated. They
show widespread devastation.
Owing to the breakdown of the tele
graph and telephone systems, the real
extent of the disaster is still unknown,
but financial aid is needed. People are
flocking into St. Vincent from all the
country around for shelter and food.
Everywhere it appears that all the
small buildings and many large ones
were destroyed, and there is no doubt
that the fatalities were numerous.
Sir Cornelius Moloney, Governor of
the Windward Islands, cables that two
vessels were sunk and that the fate of
many others is unknown.
The Governor of Barbadoes, Sir J. S.
Hay, reports that the hurricane was of
ten hours' duration. Already he has
been officially notified of sixty-one
deaths and of thirty-one persons seri
ously injured. The reports from the
country districts distant are incomplete,
but there has been a heavy loss of Gov
ernment and private property. Assist
ance is urgently required.
TRINIDAD, British West Indies,
Sept. 15. â A steamship which has ar
rived here from Barbadoes reports that
fearful havoc was caused there by the
hurricane on Saturday night. The de
struction of property was immense. It
is believed over 150 persons were killed
throughout the island and numbers
were rendered homeless and destitute.
Shipping suffered seriously. The ship

ST. VINCENT, British West Indies,
Sept. 15.â The official reports reduce the

MONTEREY POPULISTS
REPUDIATE FUSION
KINGS CITY, Cal., Sept. 15.â The full
delegation of the Populist party of Mon
terey County assembled in convention
here this afternoon. It soon became
known that a caucus held by a majority
of the delegates had decided against fu
sion, and confusion reigned among the
various candidates.
Chairman M. L. Dexter called the ses
sion to order. The platform adopted in
dorsed the Omaha platform, and further
declared that the Monterey Populists
were here to stay and would defend the
party's life against all enemies, including
fusion.
After the committees had reported
Mark Landrum, amid great applause, an
nounced Secretary Brown's decision giv
ing the Populist party places on the
ticket. An additional resolution was
adopted unanimously denouncing the re
cent fusion deal in this State by a few
bosses and place-hunters in the Populist
and Democratic parties as being both un-
Popullstc and un-Democratc.
When nominations were called for all
were passed untl mat of Assemblyman
was reached, when the name of S. O.
Pugh of Gonzales was proposed. That
gentleman expressed his thanks for the
honor, but declined. This was opposed by
the candidate for Congress, Landrum,
who claimed that Pugh should hold the
nomination to preserve the name and life
of the Populist party in Monterey County.
Next followed a bombshell when one of
the delegates proposed nominating a lady
for School Superintendent who is the
nominee of the Democratic party for that
office. Hot speeches followed, during
which crimination and recrimination
among delegates was the order. Matters
finally became so hot that the chairman
stated he would order the hall cleared of
all disturbers. The attempt to restore
harmony by the introduction ofÂ»a resolu
tion that the convention should not in
dorse any candidate nominated by either
of the other conventions was like adding
fuel to fire, as only more confusion was
created. On a vote the resolution was
lost, and Mrs. Chope was declared the
nominee. She declared that she had al
ways been a Populist and did not seek
the Democratic nomination.
Landrum, Miller, Gould and Bousfleld,
all leading mlddle-of-the-roadsters, de
nounce the trick of the leaders of the
Democratic party and are outspoken In
the opinion that this nomination will re
sult in the disruption if not extinction of
the party In the county.
"Where no nominations were made mem
bers of the Populist party can vote as
they desire, which means success by a
large majority for the entire State, coun
ty and district tickets of the Republican
party. The members of that party are
jubilant over the Populistic fizzle.

NEW YORK MONEY MARKET.
The circular of Henry Clews, under date of
New York, September 10, says: "The exces
sive heat and Labor day combined were suffi
cient to prevent any activity on the Stock Ex
change, especially as many large operators are
â till away at the seashore and mountains.
This, together with disappointment at St. Paul
not raising it* dividend to 6 per cent, afforded
the professional element an opportunity for de
pressing values, and wherever weak spots could
be found attacks were made. The results only
served to demonstrate the undercurrent of
strength that the market really possesses. The
strongest argument at command of the bear*
was the fear of tight money. Call loans were
pushed up to 4 per cent, a rate not likely to
injure the market; but the futility of this
method of attack was soon understood. There
Is no possibility of any Important advance In
money rates so long as we continue such a
henvy creditor in Europe. Sterling exchange Is
already at the gold importing point, and any
further advance in the money market would
simply hasten the large influx of gold which is
inevitable this autumn. Europe expects to
â end us large amounts of the precious metal,
and. thoush the flow may be hindered slightly
by higher rates for money in London, still the
gold must come when wanted, as Europe has
no other way in which to settle the Interna
tional account. There is no pnwpect of a
scarcity of funds for crop or business purposes
at the East or the Wett, so we advise our
friends not to be frightened by any tight
money scare."

NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 15.â Very large amounts
of money found their way ; Into stocks and
bonds to-day, and the apathy and depression
which have hung over the stock market during
practically â  all of this morning were com
pletely dissipated. Even sugar, which at the
opening showed some continued ' apprehension
on the part of holders regarding the formidable
competition Impending in the trade, yielded
to the influence and more than ; recovered Us
early losses on very large transactions/. Man
hattan resisted attacks and rose with the gen
eral market. The late uneasiness over the
future of the money market had completely
disappeared. It was early demonstrated that
the late leaders of the bull market were to
give place to others, the grangers and other
high-priced dividend stocks meeting free offer
ings after a moderate advance. The most con
spicuous movement was In lower grade stocks
with dividend reports, and the Pacifies were
clearly the leaders. They were advanced in
London before the opening here, and the New
York market took up the- advance where the
London market left off. Northern Pacific led
the group with an extreme advance of 3% on
enormous transactions. There were . no reac
tions of any Importance during the day and
the closing was firm and generally near top
prices.
Bonds were strong and higher. Total ' sales,
610,000.
United States 3s advanced % In the bid price
to-day.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 464,100

CHICAGO BRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, . Sept. 15.â Liverpool wheat shorts
were evidently very much alarmed as Septem
ber delivery of the article there was l>4d high
er than it closed yesterday before trading; com
menced here. Their alarm communicated it
â¢elf to their speculative brethren of the same
kind In Chicago, the consequence of which was
a rise In December of Vie a bushel at the start
and %c more In the next fifteen minutes. Sep
tember shorts were more cruelly dealt with,
having- to pay from lc to 24c over last night's
close, during the time of the above named ad
vance in December. Duluth was the only one
of the Western primary markets that received
anything like what might be considered â  heavy
receipts. The dally repetition of very small
receipts, however, outside of Duluth. had at
length lacerated the feelings of the bears to a
point they could no longer stand. Minneapolis
cash wheat advanced â  2%c a bushel and cash
wheat at Duluth 2%c during the first hour.
Liverpool kept adding to the early advance In
September and finally closed with a gain for
the day of 2%d per cental, of the equivalent of
3%c a bushel. September closed with a gain
of l*4c and December rose %'g"Â»c. â 
Corn was In a disgruntled and unresponsive
mood to the strength In wheat. December
closed unchanged to %c up.
A fairly active cash demand, together with
the rally in wheat steadied oats. May closed
unchanged to %c higher.
Large hog receipts and lower prices at the
yards settled the fate of provisions for the
day. Prices were at a good stiff decline to be
gin with and made the matter worse as the
session progressed. . The latest trading was at
practically bottom prices of the day. Pork
declined 12%@15c; lard, 15c, and ribs, 7%c

CALIFORNIA PRUNES IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK. Sept. 15.â The Journal of Com
merce sa>s: There Is reported to' be an In
creased demand for California prunes for for
ward delivery. The call has been chiefly for
large sizes, and as these are almost unobtain
able, buyers are now turning their attention
to smaller fruit. Numerous car > load orders,
we are informed, have been placed since the
beginning of the week, but no sales of larger
quantities have. come under our notice, specu
lative Interest seeming to be entirely dormant,
as prices demanded on the coast are above
most buyers' views, and holders there decline
to make any'concesslon. Owing to the scarcity
of large California fruit, it is reported that
buyers are seeking to supply their wants
through purchases- of Washington and Oregon
Italian prunes, but even of these, it is under
stood, that the proportion of large sizes Is
light, > although the crop is held to be much
heavier than in previous â  years.

HAT AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The flood of outside Hay to this market,
which was predicted for the month of Sep

Dealers say that Oregon has about 30,000 tons
of surplus Hay which she can ship here If
prices warrant, and this will probably be done
If the maket advances two or three dollars a
ton later on; but present quotations do not
justify the shipment of this Hay to this mar
ket. It Is the general Impression among deal
ers that the market has about reached bed
rock, but this Is a mere guess and may oe re
alized or not. T T tah has a good deal of Al
falfa, and Washington has more or less Hay
which can be sent in here in the event of a
sharp advance; but as prices are now It Is
likely to stay at home.

FAREWELL OF
THE PRETTY
CHORUS GIRLS
The Stranded Players
Out of Oakland.
NEVER SAW A SALARY
THIRTEEN WEEKS OF BARN
STORMING IN ILL-LUCK.
Miss Mooers Says It Is Anything but
Fun to Chase Meals Through
Half the Length of the
State.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 15.
After being stranded for three days the
Martens opera company was enabled to
cross the bay this afternoon. The attach
ment on the "Maseotte's" costumes and
other property at the Macdonough Thea
ter has been released, and the pretty girls
that have been quite an acquisition to
Oakland for so long are now haunting
the stage doors of San Francisco theaters.
Many ventures have gone to grief in
Oakland. This city enjoys the distinction
of sending into bankruptcy the repulsive
Eva Sontag combination, and since then
the record has been lengthy. â¢Â»â¢â¢
The troubles of the Martens opera com
pany began with Its organization at Los
Angeles about three months ago, and it
has been a -case of barnstorming and
"standing off" ever since. All the little
towns between Los Angeles and Oakland
have been visited by the company, which
possesses some good talent, but the hoo
doo never left.it and is still pursuing ft.
"Perhaps you think it is funny," said
pretty Miss Mazie Mooers, "to chase
bread and butter. from Los Angeles to
Oakland, but excuse me. We haven't had
any salary since we started, and here w^
are, dead broke -and can't get anything
to pay for our board. We managed to
struggle along till we got to this town,
but oh. my! that frost in the Macdonough
Theater chilled Us So that we haven't got
warm yet, and we are nut a particularly
cold crowd, either. Monday night when
the constable locked us out. of the theater
and told us that our costumes were in
hock we didn't like it a bit, and I guess
that constable will know more the next
time. he tries to attach the private prop
erty of a chorus girl or any other lady."
Last night the company .made a deal
â with Mrs. Allen, the landlady of the Ga
lindo Hotel. The score of hungry barn
stormers were eating the hotel to death,
but they were such a genial crowd that
the landlady did not feel inclined to turn
them out. A council of war was held, and
it was agreed that the company should
give a benefit to the hotel In the dining
room, on condition that the landlady
gave them enoughâ 2o cents apieceâ to
reach San Francisco this morning. The i
benefit was quite a success, ami after giv- ;
Ing the landlady a testimonial to the ef
fect thai she is the first hotel proprietor
that ever showed hospitality to a stranded
lot of fetors and actresses, they crossed ,
Â«ho bfiV. â â  :
The "attachment at the Macdonough"
Theater was also released, because it was
found that the costumes and property had
been only rented from a Los Angeles
house, and therefore touM not be levied
upon for the company's debts.
TEACHERS' INSTITUTE.
Resolution to Oppose the Sixth
Amendment.
OAKLAND. Sept. 15.â The Alameda
County Teachers' Institute, after four
days of educational lectures and work.
adjourned to-day after listening to tho
tiding lecture on "Will" by Professor
W. M. James. The speaker believes in
free â¢will. Said he: "I do not agree with
the predestinarlans who believe every
action is fated. The action by which
ideas are arrested is called inhibition. The
functions of the will are as much of In
â¢ hibition as of action. The larger part of
the will is inhibition, because it is harder
to say no than yea. The higher emotions
and passions inhibit the lower ones. Fear
deprives one of appetite."
Before adjournment resolutions were
adopted expressing disapproval of the
proposed sixth amendment to the con
stitution of the State of California. The
wording of the proposed amendment is
considered bo ambiguous that It seems
Impossible to forecast its effects' in the
matter of taxation for educational pur
poses, find the teachers moreover believe
it would prove a source of much litiga

The corsets and g-oods which Mrs. Ver
mliyea claimed were her property were
brought Into court by Benedict, who tes
that th<\v belonged to him by gift
from Mrs. Vermilyea, and that the lot
was not worth over $150. Benedict also
claimed that Mlf=s Dwyer had hypnotized
Mrs. Vermilyea, and that the latter as a
luence believed everything Miss
Dwyer had mid her about him.
Judge Allon wan undecided as to which
of the claimants spoke the truth, ani
felt that the CAM was one for the civil

known. As she left the court room she
promised to "lix l'.encdict yet."

FIXED THE
TAX LEVY
AT $1,21
The Result Surprises
Every One.
LITTLE FOR LAKE MERRITT
DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES SUF-
FEE, HEAVILY.
A Remarkable Document Which Will
Raise Sufficient Revenue Sut
Complicate Its Distri
bution.
OAKLAND, Sept. 15.â The City Council
passed to print this evening an ordinance
fixing the tax levy at $1 21. The ordinance
was a great surprise to everybody except
the eight members of the Council who
had assisted to frame it. It is a remark
able document In that while It ostensibly
Incorporates $80,000 for the Improvement
of Lake Merritt, it provides in reality
for but $12,000 for the work.
The levy adds $67,000 to the Auditor's
estimates, and he had cut $182,000. This
would raise the levy from $1 27 of the
Auditor to $1 42, hut by cutting heavily
in all directions the levy was brought to
$1 21 by cutting nearly $100,000 from the
department estimates.
The levy as it is made will not provide
sufficient money to pay tho salaries and
contracts already entered into under the
law in June last, and Auditor Snow says
that the money raised for the lake will
be claimed by creditors, and the law will
give It to them. The levy of $1 21 is made
up of the following: Maintenance, 7&
cents; Bewero, 7 cents; bond fund, 17 cents;
Lake Merritt, 19 cents. Auditor Snow
sivs that the revenue that the levy will
raise will leave a large deficit. He says
the 7 cents for sewers cannot be said to
be fnr maintenance, and that the city's
creditors will go before the courts and
elnim that as the law allows a dollar levy
independent of the bond fund they are
entitled to all the revenue up to that
limit. The Auditor says that the courts
will undoubtedly so rule. As the levy.
Independent of the lake fund, is but $1.02,
only the 2 cents will be left for the lake,
and this amount is about $12,000.
The cutting lias been done as follows In
the various funds: General, from $26,000
to $21,000; salary, from $3<!,000 to $29,000;
fire, from $70 .000 to $5S.OOo; police, from
$*!2.000 to $56.(i00; street, from $56,000 to $46,
0fÂ»0; sewer (increase) from $5000 to $33,000;
park, from $7000 to $4000; fire and police
alarm, from $7000 to $4000; High School,
from $44,000 to $25.00Â«j; school, from $21 .000
to $13,000; Free Library. $19,000 to $S000;
street lights, from $72.0 C) to $63,000; park
and boulevard, from $42,000 to $90,000. The
grammar schools cost about $300,000 per
annum, but the bulk of the money comes
from the State. The High School, how
ever, has no other income, and the result
of the cut will be to close the school part
of the year.
The levy is much smaller than It ap
pears. Last year It was 95 rents for
maintenance on an assessment of $48,
000,000. This year it is but 78 cents on an
assessment of $42,000,000, and Auditor
Snow says that the difference In Income,
will be 970,060, which will be severely
felt, as three months of the fiscal year
have already gone, during which nil the
departments have been run on the ex
pectation of receiving vastly greater in
comes than are allotted to them. The
levy will raise sufficient revenue, but the
Auditor predicts much difficulty over the
distribution of it.
ihe ordinance has to be printed for ten
days and then be finally passed. It has
then to be signed by the Mayor. Tho
levy as contemplated closely resembles
that of Mayor Davis, the result of which
was to dose the schools for a part of the
year and to cause other Inconveniences.
Should Auditor Snow's view of the dollar
limit be supported by the courts the Lake
Merritt matter will present a peculiar
complication. ,
Suspects a Plot to Rob Him.
OAKLAND, Sept. 15.â Manuel Cabral,
who resides at 1600 Third street, reported
a strange Incident to the police to-night.
He says that on September 13 he gave to

Judge Allen, though he dismissed the

brought upon his regiment.
Scarlet Fever at Niles.
OAKLAND, Sept. 15.â Scarlet fever has
broken out in Niles, and unless prompt
measures are taken to disinfect the town
there is danger of an epidemic. Dr.
Chalmers states that the town is in a
uad sanitary condition, and that there is
no law or officer to enforce a cleaning
up.
He appeals to the citizens to use a lib
eral supply of slacked lime and copperas
in their yards, and tells them plainly what
will follow If they fail to do so. He asked
District Attorney Snook and Supervisor
Wells for aid in enforcing some sanitary
and quarantine measures, but was told
by i>oth that they had no power in the
matter. The longdrouth is believed to be
the cause.
Deadly Banana Peel.
OAKLAND, Sept. 15.â Miss Ann Daly,
a domestic, aged 47 years, died at the
Receiving Hospital this morning, the ap
proximate cause of her death being from
an injury to her left hip sustained by
slipping upon a banana peel two weeks
ago in front of the Fifteenth street en
gine house. The injury was considered
insignificant until a few days ago, when
serious complications set In. Coroner
Baldwin will hold an inquest.
Improvement Club.
OAKLAND. Sept. 15.â The Oakland Im
provement Club was organized last night
at Montana Jlr.ll by the election of I. F.

DISCOVERED GOLD ON BONANZA.
GEORGE W. CARMACK, the Wealthy Klondiker, and His
Native Wife and Child.
George W. Carmack, whose discovery
of gold on Bonanza Creek started thou
sands of seekers after the precious metal
to the land of the midnight sun, arrived
in this city yesterday with his native
wife and child and registered at the Com
mercial Hotel.
I!- Is the returned Klondiker who threw
bandfols Of gold and silver from his ho
tel window in Seattle for the pleasure of
watching passing pedestrians, policemen
and newsboys sen .ble for the glittering
coins. Carmack stood at the window with
his wife and native brother-in-law, burst-
Ing his sides laughing at the antics of
motormen and conductors who had de
serted their cars -minions o. the law and
men, women and chu ren, who were at
tracted by the unusual shower of wealth.
Mr. Carmack is quiet and unostenta
tious in speech and dress, and one seeing
him on the street would not take him for
the croesus he really Is. He is devotedly
attached to his Indian wife and child, and
has bestowed on the former nuggets in
quantity, which she wears suspended
around her neck or in the form of stick
pins. His first act on arriving In this city
was to buy a handsome and expensive
doll for the little girl, who Is now five
years old.
This is Mr. Carmack's first visit to this
city since 1885. He was then a resident of
San LuiÃ Oblspo, but seeing a slim
chance of earning a livelihood and hear
ing of the finding of gold in Alaska he
decided to try hi 3 fortune there. Ho en
countered hardships while prospecting
about the lakes the first summer, but
found nothing. During the winters of
IRBS and 18P6 he traded Tn Juneau.
"In the spring of '86," he said, "I went

BAD FOR THE STEELHEADS
"BILLY" FOOTE AND J. V. COLE
XLAN ARE CRACKAJACKS.
The Hon. Thomas ilynn and the
Duke of Connaugrht Will In
troduce Some of Their
New Ideas.
"Billy" Foote would be a very much
chagrined man if a friend incidentally
remarked to him that there were points
in law with which he was not familiar,
as "Billy" is unquestionably an acknowl
edged authority on Blackstone, but when
queries that pertain to anadromous fishes
are introduced an allowance must be
made for the attorney's knowledge of
the habits of steelheads and the king
salmon.
But Mr. Foote, notwithstanding the
limited knowledge he may possess of the
peculiarities and habits of the salmo
fontinalis, or the salmon proper (Quinnat
for instance) Is nevertheless an enthusias
tic angler, and according to report from
such an eminent authority as Judge
Hunt, Mr. Foote can actually land a fish
not exceeding ten inches in length with
out the aid of a gaff.
Then there is another very significant
personage who is well known to the fra
ternity of the angle by name J. V. Cole
man, who will be assisted by the Duke
of Connaught, viz.: the Hon. Dan O'Con
nell.
It would be absurd to say that either of
these able artists of the gentle art could
possibly miss landing a trout that was
hooked in such a manner that only a
tyro could possibly fail to creel it.
However that may be, it is certain that
Messrs, Foote, Coleman, O'Connell, Benn,
Butler, Macauley, Hunt, Venker. Maskey.
Sammi, Smyth, Johnson and Young will
take their departure to-day for tne Eel
River, which stream offers great induce
ments to anglers at the present time to
enjoy royal sport.
Among the sportsmen who have been
enjoying "high-toned" fishing during the
past week on Eel River are the Hon.
Thomas Flynn of me Wasp, John Galli
gher, champion spoon-caster of Oakland;
Colonel W. Kefiehor of Texas, and
Messrs. Casey and Lynch.
The lovers of good angling will leave
to-day from pier 9, Broadway wharf, at
9 a. m., and It goes without saying that a
large gathering of well-wishers will be on
hand to wish the patrons of the classic
sport a pleasant voyage.
Mr. Butler, who is better known among
the enthusiasts as "Heel River John,"
received a letter yesterday from Mr. Rob
ertson of Fortuna, stating that the ang
ling was at its best and that with tiles
he caught 1300 steelheads during the
month of August, the average weight of
which was three-quarters of a pound.
During the latter part of September the
King or Quinnat salmon will make its
appearance, and anglers who delight in
trollirg from a boat will have sport ad
libitum, as the Quinnat is a game fish and
will take a spoon readily.
OUR COLONIAL POLICY.
Colonel Tobin's Masterly Reply to
John P. Irish's Attack on the
Administration.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 15.â Six weeks ago
John P. Irish addressed the Unitarian
Club of this city on the subject of wnat
he called the "Imperial policy" of the ad
me: until the fall of '89. I remained for
tbree summers in the vicinity of the
Forty-Mile District and then went to the
Pelly River district, and was principally
engaged In trading. In the spring of S>6
I went down the mouth of the Klondike
to fish and then started on a prospecting
tour. I was accompanied by twoiThk
weesh Indians. On the 16th of August I
made the big discovery on Bonanza. I
was going to a little creek called Gold
Bottom to prospect, and on my way
stumbled across this creek. It was on a
higii river bed rock, and the gold could
be seen lying on the gold rock. I staked
out a claim of 500 feet by right of dis
covery and 500 feet by right of location.
My two Indian companions also staked
out 500 feet each.
"We then went down to Forty-Mile for
provisions and tools to work our claims,
and as soon as the news of our discovery
became known there was a stampede to
the spot, and within two weeks every
inch of ground In the vicinity of the creek
was located.
"The first year we did not take out very
much, and sold one claim for $13,500. Pete
McDonald purchased 250 feet and Jack
Felix and the Edgar brothers 250 feet, and
are profiting by their investment. The
second winter my partners and myself
worked our claims and took out about
$125,000.
"I don't advise men to gp or stay away
from Alaska. If they go they should
steer clear of Dawson ana strike out in
some other direction. There will be no
scarcity of provisions this winter, as the
river steamers are rushing in a big sup
ply.
"I will visit San Luis Oblspo for a few
daya and then go to the springs to get
rid of my rheumatism contracted while
on the coast. I expect to return to Alaska
in March next."
ministration. He took the most positive
ground against colonial extension, claim
ing that it was unconstitutional and op
posed to the policy enunciated by Presi
dent Washington. Irish devoted all the
wealth of invective, sarcasm and denun
ciation of which he is capable to an at
tack on the policy of the administration.
Last night Colonel J. J. Tobin, in re
sponse to repeated requests from mem
bers of the club that, he answer Irish's
argument, delivered <\ lecture on the sub
ject "Cullings From Our Late Scrap With
Spain." His discourse dealt with the en
tire question of territorial expansion,
going Into each instance where additions
had been made to our domain. He showed
that in the past we had gone outside of
our contiguous territory, and claimed that
such action was constitutional. He
pointed out where the recommendations
of Washington had been repeatedly de
parted from, and claimed that it was not
right to be bound by his dictum, when
conditions had changed In a manner
which he could not have foreseen.
Colonel Tobln did not believe that the
acquisition of foreign territory would en
tail burdensome expense, and hoped that
this country would retain all that it had
gained in the West Indies, as well as in
the Philippines.
The speaker had the entire sympathy
of his audience, and his speech was lis
tened to throughout with close attention
and 'received frequent applause.

the last few years, and they have been
framed into a constitution upon the ad
vice and suggestion of Colonel Edwards
and Professor Walter Magee. It is ex
pected that their adoption will introduce
a better organization into student ath
letics and bring them into cluser touch
with the student body.
One of the innovations contemplated is
that of the creation of a new office to be
known as student treasurer. It will be a
salaried position, paying $40 a month, to
be open only to graduates or seniors tak
ing limited work. The treasurer will have
entire charge of all money received or
paid out for all branches of athletics,
and he will be placed under bonds of
$6000. Among the condidates who are
prominently mentioned for the position
are James Hopper of the class of '98. who
played end on last year's Varsity foot
ball team, and J. C. Allen, student assist
ant in chemistry.
Aside from adopting a constitution, the
meeting is al6o called for the purpose of
Dominating athletic officers for the com- j
Ing year. Candidates for secretary of the
association are Duncan MacDuffie of the
class of '99 and Frank Pache. It is ex
pected also that some action will be taker, j
upon the rush held recently on the cam- j
pus between the freshmen nnd sopho
mores, as rushing of any kind is forbid
den by the rules of the Associated Stu
dents. _

JEWISH NEW
YEAR FESTIVAL
ROSH HASHONO
Impressive Services at
the Synagogue.
WILL BE A DAY OF REST
THE HOLIDAY TO BE STRICTLY
OBSERVED.
Religious Exercises To-Night Will
Mark the Advent of the Great
Celebration â Its Sacred
Portent.
The Jewish Now Year, Rosh Hashono,
will be appropriately observed In this city
to-morrow and Sunday. Saturday will be
the linst day of the Hebrew month Tishri,
thi' first ecclesiastical month of the Jew
ish calendar, and, according to Semitic
computation, it is the live thousand *lx
hundred and lifty-ninth year of the crea
tion of the world.
The festival will be ushered In this even
ing by exercises in all the synagogues and
â¢will bo observed by the orthodox or con
servative element of the community until
Sunday evening. The Temple Emanu-El
congregation, being "reform" in its ideas,
will, however, only recognize it for one
day. This day will be observed strictly
by all. for no matter how lax the Jew
may be as regards the observance of the
minor fasts and festivals, he is ever
scrupulously careful to see that the New
Year and the Day of Atonement are spent
In a befittingly religious manner. He will
close his office or store, and the down
town portion of the city will know him
not on those "Days of Awe," as they are
appropriately termed.
The synagogues during the festival will
present a striking appearance. They will
be dressed' entirely in white. - A mantle
of white satin will ornament the Ark of
the Covenant, wherein rest the manu
script scrolls of the law. The pulpit and
reading desk, where chants the Chazan,
or cantor, will be likewise covered. Min
isters of the orthodox congregations will
be robed In white linen.
Sermons will be delivered in all syna
gogues on the first day of the New Year.
The shofar, or cornet, fashioned out of
the horn of a ram, will be blown thirty
times with different intonations. The ob
ject of these blasts is to bring the con
gregation to a due sense of the solemnity
of th" day.
Yom Kippur. or the Day of Atonement,
follows ten days after Rosh Hashono.
This day is strictly observed by all. re
gardless of differences of opinion on mat
ters commercial, as a day of fasting and
prayer. The fast begins at sunset of the
9th day of Tishri, and concludes with
sunset on the 10th. During these twenty
four hours no Jew will partake of food in
any shape or form.
The evening of Yom Klppur is called Kol
Nidre from the two opening words of the
services. Sermons will be preached on
that evening In the Temple Emanu-El by
Rev. Jacob voorsanger, at the Synagogue
Sherith Israel by Rev. Jacob Nieto. at
the Geary-street Temple by Rev. M. S.
Levy and in the Bush-street Temple by
Rev. Isadora Meyers.
During the day of Yom Kippur four
cervices, named respectively Schacharlt.
Musaph, Mincha and Xeilah will be held
successively. Sermons will be preached
either before Musaph or before Neilah.
Five days after the day of atonement
â will witness the celebration of the Feast
of Succoth or Booths. With this festival
are revived many ancient and quaint cer
emonies to commemorate the fact that
while the Hebrews were wandering In
the wilderness their only places of abode
were booths or tents. It is from this that
the festival derives its name. The good
Jew will erect a temporary structure of
wood roofed with boughs of evergreen,
called a "Succoth," and will take his
meals in this frail tent for seven days.
In the synagogue the orthodox Jews
will form processions, carrying in their
hands palm branches and citrons. While
walking in procession around the syna
gogue with these they will chant the
hallel, or hymns of praise.
On the seventh day Â«f Succoth, called
Hosanna Rabba, "The Great Hosanna,"
all visitors to the synagogues of tho
orthodox will be presented with a hand
ful of willow boughs. With .iese they
will strew the floors of their places of
worship in imitation of the priests of the
ancient Hebrews.
With the observance of the feast of thÂ«
eighth day and the last one, called "The
Rejoicing of the Law." the festivals will
come to a close. On the former of these
days an allegorical prayer for rain will
be offered, this being a survival of the
days of the Babylonian exile, and the so
journ in the Holy Land, and is supposed
to insure a winter that win work no in
jury to the- vegetation of the land.
"The Rejoicing of the Law" derives its
name from the fact that among conserva
tive Jewish congregations the fifty-two
portions Into which the Pentateuch is di
vided are completed, and the first chap
ter of Genesis is recommended on this
day. The process of finishing and recom
mencing has gone on uninterruptedly for
many centuries, and is marked ay the ob
servance of numerous quaint customs.
OAKLAND. Sen*. 15.â Rosh Hashono,
the Jewish New Year, begins to-morrow
at sundown and will be observed by the
member? of the Congregation Beth Ja
cob. Rev. W. Livingston, a noted East
ern rabbi, has been specially engaged for
1 the coming holidays.

RUFFIANISM
OF POUNDMEN
IS DENOUNCED
Judge Conlan Tells
Them Their Duties.
AN UNWARRANTED ARREST
THE CASE OF W. J. FOSTER, A
BARBER, DISMISSED.
He Was Handcuffed by Two Depu
ties, Thrown luto the Pound
Wagon and to
the City Prison.
W. J. Foster, a barber at H25 Market
Btreet, was arrested last Saturday uy
Deputy Poundkecper W. Robling on a
charge of interfering with an officer. Fos
ter was enjoying the pranks of three pups
in front of his shop, when Robling and
another deputy swooped down on the pups
and threw the net over them. Foster
released the dogs. Robling handcuffed
him, and, without giving him an oppor
tunity of getting his coat and hat, placed
him in the poundwagxm and drove him to
the City Prison.
The eiLse was tried before Judge Conlan,
and in dismissing it yesterday he took
occasion to scanty tho Pound officials.
He said:
Why the deputy poundmastens assumed the
high-handed authority that they did. why they
should so outrageously assault, handcuff and
abuse and curt off to prison without hat or
coat In a wagon made for the transit of dogs
a law-abiding citizen I don't know, unless the
occasion waa ripe for the rufHanlum and rowdy-
Ism In them to crop out. No wonder Mr. Foster
is indignant. I don't blame him to be mnrti
fled, and werv I him I would Invoke the aid of
the law to secure redress for the brutal and
Inhuman violence and Indignity that he waa
tubjected tc through the uuotficerlUce action ou
tho part of the pound official. If they would
exercise more dillcnce as to the duties of
their office and les>B vulgar, vicious brutality
to Inoffensive, peaceful citizens they would be
more leniently considered by the public In gen
eral, but so long a-s such rowdies are employed
by the public pound so long will law-abiding
citizens be dragged Into prisons and courts
upon frivolous charges, which are only made
an v subterfuge to cover their own vicious con
duct. Now I want you to understand right
here that your duty is to look after the cap
ture and detention of. stray, vagabond, home
less dogs wandering upon the streets without
an owner. 1 have heard complaints thut pet
dogs and valuable dogs have been taken from
the front steps and lawns of the residences of
their owner?, where they belonged. I dare
heard complaints where you have taken dogs
from the Immediate QilStody and control of the
owner while walking upon the streets. I dara
ray that were a disinterested person to go from
this court straight to the public pound he would
find SO per cent of the dogs confined there to
be valuable animals, and that he would pas*
upon the streets oi\ the way there a dozen or
so of mangy, homeless curs, which are permit
ted to run at large because you do not con
sider them worth impounding. Now that is
not your duty ar.d not the object of the exist
ence of a public pound. You can have no sucb
ct&rllke authority vested in you, and If you
bo think you have I will inform you that you
are violating the law yourself. If my dog Ik
sitting on my front steps, or on the sidewalk
In front of my house, or In my immediate con
trol and custody, and under my command, you
have no right to molest or take my property,
and it borders upon larceny to do so. It is
about time you had a lesson v*> to your duty,
and your duty is to look out for stray, home
less dogs and not lie around watching and
waiting for any and all valuable animals that
nrny come your way. In this cose It Is too bad
that Mr. Foster has been subjected to the
abusive Indignities that he was, and, as I Raid
before, were I he I would seek redress In
the proper courts.

AN ARTIST RECOGNIZED.
Alexander Harrison, the Celebrated
Marine Painter, Gets a Double
Compliment.
Alexander Harrison, the eminent ma
rine painter, who arrived In San Fran
cisco a few days ago, went to Monterey
yesterday, accompanied by Charles Rollo
Peters. They will be Joined by other art
ists early next week.
Mr. Harrison received two agreeable
announcements just before his departure.
The rtrst came by wir*;, conveying the in
telligence that the University of Pennsyl
vania had conferred upon him the degree
of bachelor of science, and the second was
a letter from the Owl, informing him tnat
he had been elected an honorary member
of the Bohemian Club. The duties at
taching to the position of bachelor of
science will in no wise conflict with the
duties or obligations which one accepts In
becoming an honorary member of the Bo
hemian Club, so there is but little douot
that the artist will accept both offices and
continue the work of painting the sea and
its surroundings as if the shower of hon
ors had not occurred.
SEVERELY PUNISHED.
George Foster, a Teamster, Disturbed
the Peace in the Orpheum.
George Foster, a teamster in the em
ployment of Wells. Fargo & Co., -was con
victed In Judge Conlan's court yesterday
and sentenced to pay a fine of $200 or
spend ninety days In the County Jail,
which is the limit for disturbing the
peace. The fine was paid later. Sun
day night Foster was in the Orpheum
Theater and took possession of a reserved
seat. The usher asked him to leave the
seat, but he refused. Force had to be
used, and Foster threw himself on the
floor and gave utterance to the vilest
language, which was heard all over the
house. He was finally dragged out and
taken to the City Prison, wheretbe charge
of disturbing the peace was booked
against him.
Her Confidence Betrayed.
Mary Feeney, a servant at 1616 Pine
street, swore to a complaint In Judge
Conlan's court yesterday for the arrest
of Benjamin Leipsic, driver of a milk
wagon, on the charge of felony embezzle
ment. She alleges that Leipsic induced
her to give him her savings, amounting
to about $300. on the representation that
he would Invest it in stocks for her and
the money would triple In value in a
month. That was nearly two months ago,
and she has not received a cent from him.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 15.â One of the
largest crcnvd6 ever assembled at Agri
cultural Park paid homage to Sacramento
day this afternoon to view the racing. The
mercury in the thermometers ascended
until it neared the bubbling point, and
the grand stand looked a whining mass
of pretty faces, vari-oolored flowers and
fans. The icecream men sold out early
in the day. and in its effort to cool out,
the bookmaking brigade was almost
tempted to lengthen out the prices. Later
better counsel prevailed, and the old odds
stayed there. Betting in the ring was
brisk, one peneilor estimating the amount
of coin handled by the six books at
$25,000.
The card was a tempting racing morsel.
Besides the rich $4500 California Futurity
stake, the Autumn handicap for two
year-olds and the Vlnctor stake were
down for decision. In all, two favorites
only were successful.
The other c% r ents were tame in compari
son to the Futurity, which furnished a
desperate finish between Bonibel, Al
moner and Ollnthus. The latter, carrying
top weight, with Henry Shields in the
saddle, carried the biggest commissions,
though the Byrnes pair. Saintly and He
mera, were favorites in the betting at
the short price of 4 to 5. Against the
Burns & Waterhouse pair. Bonibel and
Panamint, 5 to 1 were offered.
Figsrott, on Bonibel, went out when
Starter Havey sent the field away to a
pretty start, to make a runaway race of
it. At the end his mount was stopping
badly, but by superb riding he kept tho
roan Oily up long enough to get the de
cision In a terrific drive from Almoner
and Olinthus, the three finishing heads
apart on the wire. Shields on Olinthus
had a tempestuous voyage or he would
have won, the big chestnut colt clearly
showing that he was the best. The best
jockey won on the poorest horse of the
trio. Saintly showed none of his old
time speed. The track was dead, and the
timeâ l:l7 â indicates a very poor race.
The Autumn handicap drew out a tin
pan collection of four scaly looking two
year-oids, with Cardale ruling a 1 to 2
chance In the ring. The brown colt must
have retired late the evening previous, for
he chopped It up badly, taking the short
end of the coin. Rainier, a 7 to 1 chance,
came from nowhere and beat ....le leader.
Obsidian, as ho pleased. Hal Brown, a
sawed-down stable lad, piloted the win
ner.
Mike Kelly, who has been nursing Scar
borough along the greater part of the
summer, made no secret of the fact that
he thought his charge would win the
Vlnctor stake, and in his prognostication
he was correct. The bay horse, with Hen
nessey in the saddle, allowed the mild
favorite, Buckwa. to cut out the run
ning until nearly stretch time, where he
was given his head, and with conslder
ab.e to spare led tho Cambridge stabla

The flying filly Magdalenas seems to
have regained her old-time speed, for,
starting a 7 to 10 favorite in the opening
five and a hnlf-furlongs sprint for beaten
two-year-olds, she beat her field away off
after getting away last. Gus Wilson rode
the winner, earning his first set of brack
ets since coming from Montana. In a
hard drive Holmes on Napian got his
mount home a neck before Nilgar.
Himera, which was beaten on Wednes
day, came out in the six-furlongs selling
sprint following, and with Piggott on her
back led Rose Maid and Roulette Wheel
over the line in a driving finish. The
winner was held in twos in the betting,
and received the best, of the saddle work.
Roulette Wheel might have won with a
less pantomimic ride. St. Philip, one of
the post chokes, caught stage fright while
the running was young.
The final six-furlongs dash, decided un
der selling conditions, went to Amasa.

Home of Melodrama Closes January
IâTo1 â To Be Splendidly Remodelled
"With a Seating Capacity
of 2900.
jTorosco Is frntngr to tryâ from a the
atrical standpoint â to make hHtorv re
peat Itself.
With the waning of the present year
tho popular priced Grand Opera-houso
â will close its doors to reopen again on
the fith of toarch as the most beautiful
and high priced theater on the coast.
The aim of the manager is to draw the
â¢wealth, the patronage and the brilliancy
that marked its earliest career to the
row popular theater, and make It again
the most fashionable house on the
coast.
It is to be an anti-S3 - ndieato and big
production house. The independent actor
or actress who refuses to share with tho
ail-absorbing theatrical syndicate the ma
rr!(in of the profits of a season of
artistic and financial success may book
with Morosco. Then those attractions
which cannot play at the Baldwin on
account of its stage capacities will also
find i pen dates at the new theater.
Harry Moroaco will personally attend
to the booking of attractions, and he has
already secured Mme. Melba and her
grand opera company, which will open the
house. Henry Irving will shortly follow.
' ; ' ni Morosco's attention is
given up entirely to the remodeling of
the theater. Tho auditorium is to be en
tirely refitted, and for that purpose $30,000
will be spent. Three hundred additional
seats, mostly tn the orchestra, will be
added, thereby mrking a seating capac
ity of 2900. No existing theater will
serve as a mod*! for the refitted house,
and the aim of the manager is comfort
and largvr stating capacity, as well as
beauty.
There is not to be a fixed scale of
prices, and admissions will range ac
cording to the attractions offered. When
thp management has no high cl;iss at
traction the theater will remain closed.
Mm.-. Melba, who is to be the opening
attraction at the house, has secured the
refusal of a:i annual operatic Beason for
five consecutive years. The prlma donna
la to briny with her x company of 200
people and an orchestra of sixty mem
bers.
Th.> new theater will be known as the
Grand Opera-house.

At a meeting of the Board of Health
next Wednesday action will be taken
looking; to an inspection of the quarters
occupied by Chinese women in Chinatown.
Reports have recently been submitted to
the board stating that widespread dis
eases of a most n-.alignant form exist.
Following the raid upon the unclean res
taurants, Chinatown will receive an over
hauling more thorough than it has had
Bince Judge Murr-hy of the Superior Court
Interfered by granting a temporary in
junction against the board over a year
ago.
In ease the Supervisors cut down the
appropriation for the board of Health it
is understood that some forty employes
mostly Inspectors and attaches of the
chemical and food <U-;wrtment, will lose
their Jobs. The Legis'i.ture has provided
that certain health officers shall be main
tained, but allows the Board <>t Health
to "appoint such other employes as may
be deemed necessary." Under this pro
viso the majority of the present force of
inspectors was appointed. Their tenure
of office necessarily depends upon the ac

money for their pay.

SUICIDE OF GEORGE RUGE.
Despondent Over the Death of His
Child He Hanged Himself.
George Ruge, sn loon-keeper, har.ged
himself early yesterday morning in his
place of business. 7, Ellis street. He had
been on watch the night before, and
closed the place at the usual timeâ 2
o'clock in the morning. His partner,
August Feil, opened the place in the
morning and found Ruge's dead body
hanging by a clothesline attached to a
gas fixture in a room adjoining the bar
room. Ruge had stood upon a small box,
and had kicked the box away after he
had fastened the rope around his neck.
On a slate on the bar was the following
message, written in German:
Gus: When you get here this morning you
will find me dead. Close the door and go to
Captain C. K. Zimmcr, 1007 Mission Btreet. He
will notify my dear wife of my death. Yours
truly, GEORGE RUGE.
Good by.
On the back of a business card was
written the following in English:

you t.it- trouble and tho city the expense I
hereby *tate that I came to my death by my

GEORGE RUGE.
The deceased lost a child by death about
a month ago, and his wife is precariously
ill. Mr. Feil never heard Ruge talk about
making away with himself, although his
partner was rath<r despondent because of
the death of his offspring and the sick
ness of his wife.
DISCUSSED THE TAX LEVY.
The Buildirg Trades Council Thinks
a Dollar Would Be Sufficient.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last night, as soon as the routine
business had been disposed of, the balance
of the evening was given up to a general
discussion of the tax levy.
There are rumors that it will be at
least $2 10, but prominent members who
have made a careful study of the^matter
think that $1 would be sufficient and taat
many projected improvements could t>e
held over for another year. The general
expression was that if the tax levy is high
there will be less building done in the
coming year, and members of the build
ing trades will accordingly suffer. A long
speech was made by the president, P. H.
McCarthy and short ones by W. H.
Wood, J. E. McDougald, W. M. Page, J.
"W. Rose, T. Saunders and others.
The members of tho Building Trades
Council represent over 8000 voters, and
all promise to remember the men who set
the tux levy according to their deeds.

Wants $7500 for the Structure and
$68,000 to Secure an Elec

LOADING STORES ON THE CONDOR.
The British tramp steamer Condor, under charter to the United States Government, had a narrow escape
at Lombard street wharf Wednesday night. She was moored on the north side of the wharf and about 11
p. m. a strong southerly swell began to roll along the front. About the same time the tide began to ebb and
soon the steamer was almost rolling her green smokestack out. The steamer snapped some of her hawsers
and the wharf was badly wrecked in the struggle.
THE wholesale arrests by both the
civil and the military authorities
of drunken and disorderly soldiers,
as a direct consequence of the
murder of young Ililderbrand. has
caused the class cf offenders to
be more guarded in its conduct since
the tragedy. The police kept an active
outlook last night in the districts where
lawbreakers are usually found.
Walter Rosser, who still seems uncon
cerned, either at the prospect of punish
ment or because of the life he has taken,
was again handcuffed yesterday morning
and cairied before Judge Joachimsen.
General W. H. L. Barnes and Daniel A-
Ryan, his associate in practice, appeared
in his behalf, and the former announced
that he represented Rosser. At General
Barnes' request a continuance was grant
ed by the court until next Tuesday.
Private Charles Goad of the Tennessee
Regiment, who attempted to knife Police
man Colen in "Billy" saloon,
was dismissed by Judge Conlan with a
reprimand. Tho soldier was thoroughly
repentant, and if he keeps his promise ne
will nc-ver look upon the flowing bowl
again. G. W. Hughes of the same com
mand was given a continuance until to
morrow morning by Judge Mogan. He is
charged with carrying concealed weapons.
Albert S. Emmett of the Fifty-Mrst lowa
Regiment, who tried to wreck the Klon
dike saloon at 50ti Dupont street, and who
incidentally assaulted Captain Beyer of
the provost guard, who tried to arrest
him, was fined $20 by Judge Joachimsen.
He was given the alternative of twenty
days in jail. Ed Slater and James Snyder,
who created a disturbance in a saloon at
406 Dupont street, were allowed to go free
by Judge Joachimsen. Their repentance
was so manifest that the policemen who
took them into custody were disinclined to
prosecute them. Both are Tennesseeans.'
The case against Private E. A. Harris, the
Tennessee volunteer who tried to rob a
sandwich man in front of the Tivoli 1 he
ater, was continued until Saturday, 'me
four Tennesseeans who assaulted a win
dow cleaner employed by Johnson, the
Creamerle proprietor, were allowed to de
part from the City Prison yesterday
morning. They had been booked as nlain.
drunks, and their confinement over night
seemed to have brought them to their
senses.
The blotter at the City Prison did not
bear the name of a single soldier yester
day between the hours of 6 a. m. and 8
p. m.
In the tax levy the sum of $7300 for a spec
ial building, to be located in the inner
court at the City Hall buildings, and the
additional sum of $68,000 for the electrical
equipment of the same.
"The dome is not a fit place for a cen
tral atatlon." remarked Mr. Hewitt yes
terday. "The place assigned or it is 300
feet above the ground, and the expense of
putting in an elevator and getting tne
wires and apparatus up there would be
excessive. I have prepared plans for a
station on the ground, in the inner court,
which will cost less and be far preferable.
The building is but one story and a base
ment, the apex of the roof being thirty
feet above the ground. The roof is of
glass, to admit the necessary light. I
provide that it shall be 59x77 feet in di
mensions, so as to allow a ten-foot mar
gin all around between it and the inside
walls of the city buildings. Thus there
will be no obstruction of windows or in
terference with light.
"My project is to place the battery of
2140 storage cells in the basement and
leave the main floor for the instrument
room and offices. There are to be three
instrument boards and one telephone
board. They will be each forty feet long
by ten feet nigh, the material being mar
ble. The recording board will be equipped
for seventy circuits, the charging board
for 76, the service board for 110, the tapper
and gong for 40 and the telephone for
circuits. It will be the finest and most
complete central station of any in the
United States. The present plant is utterly
insufficient. Heretofore I have had to get
along on an insufferably small appropria
tion and have not had money to make
needed extensions of the system. What
the Supervisors wil do this year I cannot
say. 1 have asked for the money and it
has bf-en promised, but the last moment
Is always the critical one with appropria
tions, and I may. be loft out in the cold."
Mrs. Fuhrig Accused.
The Coroner's jury in the case of the
death of Mrs. Anna Eggortsen, wife of
Jacob Eggertsen, returned a verdict yes.

death was malpractice committed by Mrs.
Dora Fuhrig, midwife.
WILD NIGHT
ABOARD THE
TRAMP CONDOR
Ebb Tide and Swells
Make Trouble.
STEEL HAWSERS SNAPPED
LOMBARD STREET WHARF IS
BADLY DAMAGED.
The Chilean Bark Bertha and Ameri
can Bark Lucile Were Nearly
Wrecked in a Collision
Off Flattery.
The tramp steamer Condor was in
trouble at Lombard street wharf last
Wednesday night. In consequence the
vessel's hawsers suffered and a portion
of the wharf way wrecked.
The Condor Is under charter to the
United States Government to carry stores
to Manila. The only inclosed wharf
where a spare berth could be found was
at Lombard street, and there the vessel
had to go to load. The tides run like a
millrace there, and vessels will not use
that wharf unless in an emergency.
About 11 p. m. Wednesday a heavy
swell rolled in through the Golden Gate
and soon the Condor began to feel the
effect of it. Then the tide ebbed, and
that kept her away from the wharf and
gave the steamer more room in which
to roll. At times it looked as though the
big vessel would go clean over, and all
hands were called. The strain on the
hawsers was terrific, and some of them
snapped like pipe stem?. A big steel
hawser was got out, and it carried away
the mooring pile and about twenty feet
of the stringers of the wharf. Other
mooring piles showed signs of giving, so
the captain had the line put clean
across the wharf and securely fastened. |
Even then the steamer was in danger,
and the entire crew was kept on the go !
all night. The ebb tide would catch her '
on the keel, while the swell coming in
another direction Would throw her over '
until she was almost on her beam ends. I
Then she would suddenly right herself
with a jump that would strain the haw
sers almost to the breaking point and
make the wharf groan.
The experience was enough for the cap
tain of the Condor, and yesterday he
moved his vessel from Lombard street
to Howad street wharf, where she will
linish her loading. About 200 tons of
coal is to be put on the Condor's deck
and then she will sail for Manila via
Honolulu. There is some talk of her tak
ing aboard the horses which left hero on
the ship Tacoma at Honolulu. If this is
done it will be a bad move on the part
of the Government. The Tacoma is splen
didly fitted for carrying the animals, and
at this season of the year she will make
better time than the Condor to Manila,
In order to accommodate the horses stalls
will have to be built on the steamer, and
that will cost money. Of course by send
ing the Tacoma home the Government
will save in charter money, but will lose
heavily in horse flesh, as the accommo
dations for the enuines on the Condor
cannot be made what they should be.
The Merchants' Exchange has received
word of what might have been a disas
trous collision. The Chilean bark Ber
tha and the American ship Lucile ran
into each other off Cape Flattery, but
luckily both were able to make the sound.
The Bertha sailed from Moodyville for
Valparaiso on the 13th inst., and the Lu
cile was on her way from San Fran
cisco to Seattle. When ten miles south
of Flattery the two vessels crashed to
gether in a fog. The Bertha was cut
through her catheads and had her bow
sprit carried away. The Luclle lost all
her head gear and was cut through ten
of her planks. She was towed to Seat
tle. The Bertha was leaking badly, and
was taken to Chemanus for repairs.
The British ship Duchalburn, which ar
rived here on August 25, will go to either
Portland or Tacoma to load wheat for
Europe. The prospects for charters do
not seem to be very bright, and the own
ers of the Glenmark evidently think there
is no chance of an improvement. They
are sending the ship in ballast from Port
land to a nitrate port on the west coast
of South America to load nitrate for Eng
land at 30 shillings a ton.
The United States steamer Mohican,
which arrived from Honolulu early Wed
nesday night, is to be overhauled at the
navy yard and will then proceed to Sa
moa.
Reinsurance on the bark George F.
Manson advanced to 90 per cent yester
day in London. All hope for the vessel
has now practically been abandoned.

CLOSING SCENES OF
THE CUBAN CAMPAIGN
SOLDIERS' RETURN SEEN BY
WILLIAM GREER HARRISON.
Lieutenant C. L. Bent Had a Close
Call â The Patients Now in a
Boston Hospital and
Convalescing.
William Greer Harrison returned to the
city last evening. He was absent several
weeks attending to business affairs in
New York, Boston and Chicago. In New
York he observed that thousands of peo
ple went to see the battleship Oregon,
and he noted also that the famous ship
was spoken of whenever the achievements
of the United States navy were discussed.
Officers and enlisted men of the First
United States Infantry, returning from
Santiago, arrived at Montauk Point while
Mr. Harrison was in the East. Many of
the men were prostrated with the fever
and much emaciated. Lieutenant Charles
L. Bent, who was on the balance be
tween life and death, is now convalescing,
and may recover his health within six
months. Mrs. Bent left her home In Ala
rneda to join her husband as soon as she
was advised of his illness. She arrived
in Boston in time to render the most val
uable aid to the patient's recovery. Dr.
Daggett of New Haven, a brother-in-law
of the officer, expected to find Lieutenant
Bent on the Olivette, but he was not
among the officers on that vessel, and
no one seemed able to give definite infor
mation as to his whereabouts. After dili
gent inquiry covering a period of three
days the physician succeeded in locating
the patient. Lieutenant Bent, who was
utterly prostrated by malarial fever and
greatly emaciated, was conveyed to the
Massachusetts General Hospital in Bos
ton. Under the constant care of wife and
physician the officer rounded the danger
point, although it hardly seemed possible
that one so badly wrecked physically
could recover.
In New York Mr. Harrison saw Henry
T. Scott, president of the Union Iron
Works. Mr. Scott was gratified that the
ship-building concern in this city with
wiiich he is identified had received a con
tract for building one of the three big
battleships and three of the torpedo
boat destroyers.
IS IT MISTAKEN IDENTITY?
Curious Case of L. H. Jones, an Elec
trician, Charged With Bur
glary.
A singular case in which burglary is
charged, came up before Judge Joachim
sen yesterday rrr*rnlng\ the complaining
witness swearing positively as to the iden
tity of the man arrested for the crime,
and the latter as positively denying it and
bringing forward two witnesses who
swore that at the time of the alleged
burglary the defendant was with them at
the Bush Street Theater.
On Saturday night about 10 o'clock the
residence of Joseph Heinman, a sales
man at 2023 Sacramento street, was en
tered by a burglar. The servant girl was
the only occupant of the house at the
time. While the housebreaker was going
through* the house Helnman and his wife
and son came home. Heinman stood in
the hallway under the light until his wife
entered their bedroom and turned on the
light there. Just then the burglar made
his appearance and attempted to get past
Heinman. who sought to grapple with
him. The burglar put his hand in his hip
pocket and threatened to blow Heinman's
brains out if he laid hands on him, and
Heinman allowed him to leave.
L. H. Jones, an electrician, in the em
ployment of L. P.. Hetty. 121 Eddy RtreÂ«t,
was arrested, by Policeman Keys Wednes
day night and charged with the burglary.
In court yesterday Heinman swore that
Jones was the burglar, but his son could
not identify him. Jones brought forward
two reputable witnesses who testified that
he was with them in the Bush Street
Theater Saturday night. The Judge al
lowed Jones to go on his own recognizance
and continued the case until this morning
to enable him to bring his employer as
a witness as to his character.
Claims He Is a Stockholder.
Frank Lester, superintendent of thp At
las Iron Works, was arrested yesterday
on a warrant charging him with felony
embezzlement. The complaining witness
is Secretary Townley of the concern, who
alleges that Lester got a $400 note from
Warren & Malli-y on or about September
6 and used it for his own uses and pur
poses. Lester, who was released on his
own recognizance by Judge Conlan, takes
the position that he Is a large stock
holder in the concern and could do what
he liked with the note.
Manslaughter Verdict Reversed.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
verdict of the lower court In the case of
Jack Aatghini, who was convicted of
manslaughter. The defendant shot and
killed his brother under the supposition,
as he testified, that his relative was a
tramp and intended to do him harm. The
position of the higher court was that .the
accused was cross-examined on matters
not touched upon in his direct examina
tion. Also that actions of the defendant
after the shooting 1 were not testified to
by persons who had known him Inti
mately.
