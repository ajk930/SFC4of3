GOVERNOR TANNER
IS INDICTED ON
THREE COUNTS
Grand Jury Charges Omission of
Duty and Malfeasance in
Office.
Numerous Other Indictments Found Against
Those Who Were Concerned in the Virden
Coal Mine Riots.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. I.â A special to the
Republic from Carlinville, 111., says:
The Virden riot Grand Jury made its
formal report to Judge R. B. Shirley at
S:3O this evening:. Judge Shirley came
down from Springfield, where he was
holding court, and held a short half
hour session to receive this report.
The Grand Jury dealt pertinently
â¢with the affair, as far as it was able to
ascertain, and returned true bills against
the principal participant* in the trag
edy of October 12 at Virden. Ten in
dictments involving fifty-four persons
â were returned.
Against John R. Tanner, Governor of
Illinois, there are three counts for pal
pable omission of duty and malfeasance
In office.
Fred W. Lukins. general manager of
the Chicago-Virden Coal Company, is
charged with manslaughter on two
counts.
With Lukins, his deputies, Frank
Wilde, J. E. Sickles and J. H. Smith,
are indicted for the killing of Joseph
Gitterele. a Mount Olive miner.
Sixteen Thiel guards are held for
riot.
In the indictments against Governor
Tanner, the complaining witnesses are
John Graham, Will Mitchell, William
Wilson. Clarence Ross and Charles
Stewart, employes of the Chleago-Vir
den Coal Company. The^- testified that
they were intimidated and prevented
from following their legitimate em
ployment by an armed body of men,
numbering 1000, who unlawfully and
feloniously were assembled in Virden;
that the Governor had been notified by
the Sheriff of Macoupln County that
no protection was to be had from the
county, and earnestly Importuned for
State assistance.
Judge Shirley fixed Governor Tan
npr's bond at $500.
A. J. Koberts, \the foreman of the
Grand .Tury. who Â«-as also foreman of
the Coroner s"jury> is a Virden police
magistrate. He was strongly opposed
to indicting Governor Tanner.
In each of the indictments against
Governor Tanner, the omission of duty
was identical; failure and refusal to
respond to the call of Sheriff Daven
port, of this county, for military and
suppressing the riotous demonstrations
of the Virden coal miners. The indict
ments were in brief as follows:
1. Failure and refusal to send troops
to aid the Sheriff in checking the ac
tions of a thousand or more men who
were preventing certain persons from
entering on their duties in the service
of the Chicago-Virden Coal Mining
Company.
2. Failure and refusal to send troops
on the call -of the Sheriff to prevent the
Fame men from doing bodily violence
to the same would-be employes.
3. Failure and refusal to send troops
to aid the Sheriff in preventing the
same rioters from conspiring and com
bining to do injury to the would-be
employes.
INDIFFERENT TO THE
GRAND JURY'S ACTION
The Chief Executive Declines to Dis
cuss the Subject as Not Worth
While.
SPRINGFIELD. 111., Dec. I.â When
Governor Tanner was informed this
evening of the action of the Grand Jury
at Carlinville he received the news with
indifference and manifested no inter
pal in the particulars. He was asked
for an expression in regard to the mat
ter, but declined to talk about It, sim
ply saying that he did not consider it
â worth while to discuss the subject.
Attorney General Akin was asked to
give his opinion regarding the legal
effect of the action, in view of the sup
posed fact that the chief executive of
a State cannot be proceeded against In
that way and cannot be prosecuted up
on the indictments returned, but he de
clined to say anything about the matter
further than that he had not previously
heard of the action taken by the Grand
Jury and was not aware that such ac
tion was contemplated.
This is not the first time a governor
of Illinois has been indicted. It is but
a few years since ex-Governor Altgeld
was indicted in Champaign County as
one of the trustees of the University of
Illinois, ex-officio, because the so-called
"flag law" was not observed at the uni
versity, but nothing ever came of the
Indictment, which was soon afterward
dismissed.
SHAFTER IS ANNOYED
BY SAMPSON'S CRITICISMS
But the General Declines to Go Into
Any Extended Reply
to Them.
NEW YORK, Doc. I.â General W. R.
Shafter was to-day shown a copy of Ad
miral Sampson's report on the operations
Of the T'nltod States fleet at Santiago
otter the destruction of the Spanish
sqaadron in which the admiral denounced
as false the suggestions which he at
tributed to General Shafter, that the navy
was unwilling to co-operate in forcing an
entrance to the harbor and intimated that
the services of the riavy were not prop
erly recognized by the commanders of the
land forces.
General Shaf ter did not conceal the fact
that Admiral Sampson's criticisms an
noyed him greatly, bat he declined to go
into any extended reply to them.
"This controversy has been fought over
before," he said. - "The records speak for
themselves. My letters and dispatches to
The San Francisco Call
Admiral Sampson as given in his report
fell the story. I have nothing to add to
them."
The general went over the newspaper
synopsis of the admiral's report and
pointed out that the correspondence given
therein showed that ne had requested
Admiral Sampson to send a representa
tive to the ceremonies of the surrender of
Santiago, and that he did not sign the
terms of surender himself.
"As I did not sign them I certainly
would not consent for Admiral Sampson
to do so," he said.

TIE VOTE ON THE
STAY OF PROSECUTION
The Trench Senate Fails in an At
tempt to Postpone the Pic
quart Court-Martial.
PARIS. Dec. I.â The Senate this after
noon adopted the motion of M. Constans,
placing court-martial under the operation
of the law of 1597, which abolished the
Becret examination of accused persons
prior to trial.
An amendment proposing to retain se
cret examination in cases involving na
tional danger was opposed by the Minister
for War, M. de Freycinet, and rejected.
M. Waldeck-Rosseau- demanded urgency
for a proposal to empower the Court of
Cassation to order the stay of any prose
cution calculated to hamper a revision
case.
One hundred and thirteen votet. for and
113 against the motion for urgency, which
was therefore lost. The tie vote result
ed in the measure being referred to a
.special committee, so that it cannot be
pansc-d soon enough to apply to thÂ«
Picquart case.
Legal opinion leans to the view that M.
Dupuy, the Premier, was mistaken yes
terday in declaring that the Court of
Cassation had power to delay the
Picquart court-martial, and it was on the
theory that the Premier had, erred that
M. Waldeck-Rosseau introduced his bill.
The conversion of M. Herve, editor of
El Soliel, the Royalist organ, to the Pic
quart cause to-day caused a great sen
sation.

W. F. HERRIN HAS DECLARED
FOR BURNS FOR SENATOR
SOME INSIDE FACTS
OF THE RAILROAD'S
SECRET BUNKO GAME
A Truthful Record of
the Attempt Made
to Delude the
People.
This is a plain tale of William F.
Herrln and Colonel Dan Burns. Those
who have some small Interest In the
welfare of the State, or who place a
value on their citizenship, may read it
with profit. To others the account of
the doings of two political blacklegs
as set forth here can have no interest.
The facts to be related have par
ticular bearing on the manner in which
Burns became a candidate for United
States Senator, the quality of the sup
port he depends upon to secure his elec
tion and the people who are pledged to
give him that support. Quite inci
dentally It will be shown that W. F.
Herrin, chief counsel of the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company and head of
C. P. Huntington's political bureau, is
a political pickpocket, who is making a
surreptitious attempt to rob the people
of the State of honest representation in
the United States Senate.
So much for the preface. Now for the
story of the doings of two political
shysters, who, so far as the average
citizen Is aware, have all the outward
semblance of respectable members of
the community.
About ten days ago Mr. Herrln paid a
visit to M. H. de Young, proprietor of
the Chronicle, and made a proposition
concerning the selection of a candidate
for United States Senator. About the
same time Mr. Herrin called on John
D. Spreckels, proprietor of The Call,
and made a similar proposition, care
fully refraining from mentioning to
either gentleman that he had called
upon the other. What transpired at
those and subsequent meetings until
the secretive Mr. Herrin was finally
led into a trap is best told by Mr. de
Young and Mr. Spreckels.
"I am more than willing," said Mr.
de Young yesterday, "that the facts
should be known, as I believe that the
general public is entitled to a full
knowledge of the manner in which a
great corporation is attempting to se
cure for one of its political servants a
seat in the United States Senate.
"Abcmt ten days ago Mr. Henrin, chief
counsel of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, came to me and told me that he
had been requested by George Crocker,
vice president of the Southern Pacific
Company, to tell me that I would be
permitted to name the next United
States Senator. I thanked Mr. Herrih
for the honor conferred upon me and
said that I had not yet made up my
mind as to who, in my opinion, would
be the best man for the place.
"This reply did not prove to be satis
factory. Mr. Herrin continued the con
versation and very broadly intimated
that if I would name a man friendly to
the interests of the Southern Pacific
Company the honor of doing so would
be given to me, and he even went so far
as to say in so many words that if I
would name such a man the company
would secure his election and that the
Senator so elected would be my tool.
I continued to decline the proffered
privilege and the interview closed.
"I was at a loss to understand the
real purport of Mr. Herrin's visit, but
I was not left long in the dark. Mr.
Herrin went immediately to two friends
of mine and sought to induce them to
use their influence with me to have me
name Dan Burns for Senator. After
having done this he again came to me
and repeated the proposition he had
previously made. Being then advised
of his real intentions, which were, of
course, that I should be given the privi
lege of naming the Senator, provided
I named Burns, I gave Mr. Herrin a
flat refusal.
"About this time I learned from John
D. Spreckels that Herrin had made a
similar proposition to him. After a
consultation we decided to unmask the
railroad attorney and thus learn his
real intentions. Accordingly a tele
phone message was sent to Herrin re
questing him t<* meet Mr. Spreckels in
his office at Third and Market streets,
no intimation being given that I was to
be present. Herrin complied immedi
ately with the request and was ushered
into the room where we were. He was
so surprised and taken aback that he
leaned against the wall for support un
til he could recover himself.
"I asked Herrin how it was that he
had made practically the same proposi
tion to Mr. Spreckels and myself. H*
hemmed and hawed, pulled out a cigar
and stuck the wrong end of it in his
mouth and finally stammered out some
thing about the delay that had been
made in making a reply to his propo
sition. I. then asked him point blank:
'Who is the railroad's candidate for
United States Senator?' His reply was:
" 'Colonel Dan Burns is the railroad's
candidate.'
"Herrin was then told both by Mr.
Spreckels and myself that under no cir
cumstances would the railroad's can
didate be supported by either The Call
or the Chronicle. That ended the inter
view.
"In the light of the events of the past
two weeks I can see that the -^^lltical
managers of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and Burns have worked together
during the whole of this campaign with
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the end in view of securing the election
of Burns to the United States Senate.
Burns has changed his personal habits,
though he has not changed his personal
associates. As far back as last August
he went to a gentleman to whom he
had not spoken in years and asked that
bygones be forgotten. The cause of his
enmity to this gentleman grew out of
the fact that when Burns was In jail
in Sacramento charged with robbing
the State of more than $30,000 this gen
tleman refused to go on his bond. He
sent word to Burns that he (Burns)
was in the place where he ought to be
and that he trusted that he would be
punished as he deserved.
"Burns also went to the attorney who
defended him when he was charged
with robbing the State, and whose fee
Burns never paid, and requested him to
forget the past and be friends.
"It was Burns that handled all of the
money paid out in this district to Leg
islative candidates, presumably by the
railroad company, during the cam
paign. This was done for the purpose
of securing their favor for Burns when
he should finally unmask and come out
as a Senatorial candidate.
"As I said at the beginning, these are
facts that the public should know in
order that the people of the State can
decide if they want Burns to represent
them in the Senate of the United
States."
What Mr. de Young had to say of the
proposition made to him concerning the
announcement of a candidate for Sena
tor was corroborated by Mr. John D.
Spreckels.
"Mr. Herrin came to me some time
ago," said Mr. Spreckels, "and told me
that I could name the next United
States Senator. He said that I might
as well have the honor as another, as
he believed it best for all parties to
come together and agree upon some
good man.
"I asked him if the railroad had a
candidate, and he said it had not. He
added, however, that the railroad would
favor a man whose views on public
questions were not prejudicial to its
interests.
"I told Mr. Herrin that I had no can
didate, and that I was willing to get
behind any big, broad-minded man who
would be satisfactory to the people of
the State. I then named every man
who has from time to time been men
tioned as a Senatorial possibility, but at
the suggestion of each name Herrin
shook his head and said the man would
not do. BurnÃ' name had never been
mentioned in connection with the Sena
torship, and it never entered my head
that it was Burns that Herrin was try
ing to get me to name.
"When I found out from Mr.de Young
that Herrin had made the same propo
sition to him, and that It wag Burns for
whom the railroad was seeking my
support and the support of The Call,
the whole thing dawned upon me. I
immediately sent for Mr. Herrin. He
was somewhat disconcerted when he
found Mr. de Young with me, but when
he was challenged to name the rail
road's candidate he defiantly asserted
that it was Colonel Dan Burns, and no
one else. I did not leave him long in
doubt as to the attitude The Call would
assume toward Colonel Burns' candi
dacy, and there the matter was
dropped."
There is yet a little of the history of
Mr. Herrin's dark lantern attempt to
secure for Burns' under-coyer candi
dacy the indorsement of two great
newspapers that has not been related
in the foregoing statements of Mr. de
Young and Mr. Spreckels. As it is per
tinent to thÂ« subject under discussion
it is "given here with the assurance
that the facts as they will be stated
will be vouched for by either of the
gentlemen mentioned. The attention
of the numerous candidates for Sena
torial honors is particularly called to
this part of the story, as they will be
given, free of charge, a true estimate
of the esteem in which they are held
by the railroad company.
When Mr. Herrin went, to Mr. Spreck
els and asked him to name a candidate
for United States Senator he stipu
lated -that the man named must be
some one whom the railroad liked
better than M. H. de Young. Mr.
Spreckels then proceeded to name, one
after another, such men as George A.
Knight, E. F. Preston, Robert N. Bulla,
General W. H. L.. Barnes, Judge Hen
shaw, U. S. Grant, Thomas R. Bard,
E. S. Pillsbury, Charles N. Felton,
James A. Waymire, Irving M. Scott and
a half dozen others whose names are
familiar to almost every resident -* the
State. To each of these Mr. Herrin in
terposed a decided negative. As it
transpired that it was Colonel Dan
Burns who was in Mr. Herrin's mind's
eye, the inference is apparent. Mr.
Herrin and the political manipulators
of the Southern Pacific Company place
small value on the mental and moral
qualifications of the many gentlemen
named when compared with the magni
ficent attainments of the cultured Col
onel Burns, whose career as an office
holder ended in a prison cell; whose
knowledge of race horses and racing
matters is unlimited; whose brilliant
record as a mine operator is contained
in a thousand legends that float back
and forth across the border line of
Mexico; whose career as a political boss
is as aromatic as that of Sam Rainey;
wbQSG personal associates move the
best circles of the Tenderloin; whose
knowledge of the great questions af
fecting the welfare of the nation is as
limitless as the broad* prairies beyond
the Rocky Mountains, and whose love
of Collis P. Huntington is as that of a
babe for its mother.
For those who have read the fore
going account of the bunko game Mr.
j Herrin is trying to work on the unsus
pecting public, there is still another
1 chapter. It is contained in an edi
torial printed in last evening's Post,
the Southern Pacific Company's offi
cial organ in this city. It is reprinted
here for the sake of making stronger
the contrast between the secret meth
ods of the giant corporation and the
attitude it assumes before the public.
Following is the editorial. In reading it
keep in mind the acts of Mr. Herrin2
tiefore related l and the additional fart
thai $14,000 of the Southern Pacific's
money was paid c>ut to Legislative can
didates during the campaign through
the hands of Colonel Dan Burns:
WHO OWNS THE LEGISLATURE?
If Republican government is not a fraud
and a pretense, every member elected to
the Legislature of California is at liberty
to vote for whomsoever he pleases for
United States Senator. If there fs a mem
ber of that body who is bound by any
pre-election pledge? or who has farmed
out his honor and his manhood, he has
violated the laws, and a position In San
Quentin would more fittingly become him
than one in the Legislature.
If there is a member elected to the Leg
islature who paid his election expenses
out of the pockets of a candidate for
I'nited States Senator, he has nut arisen
to that plane of honesty or intelligence
which would make him fit for self-govern
ment. A slave could bo bought and sold
without dishonor to the slave, became
behind the seller stood the armies and j
navies of the world and the coercive ap
proval of public opinion. But the mem
ber of the Legislature who has been or
can be bought and sold has voluntarily
chosen a condition of slavery., and has ;
reached a depth of moral degradation be- i
yond which there are no soundings. The j
negro on the auction block occupied a
popition infinitely superior to that of the
member of the Legislature who. having
taken the money of a candidate -for Unit
ed States Senator, will occupy a seat In
the Senate' or the Assembly of the State
of' California after the . tlr.-n Monday in
January. The moral purpose which could
:;t to an abasement :ot this kind
KUgun ill for the legislation such a body
will enact. There an? times when the
honest mind flnda a high consolation in
dealing with the exact truth, and there
is a fullness of truth in the foregoing
characterization ol the real status of legr
islattve slavery which every Just mind
will recognise and approve.
If the members of the Legislature to as- j
somble in January are men appreciating
the full dignity of the right, of self-gov
ernment they are the only parties to be
consulted as to who will be elected United
States Senator. They are untrammeled j
save by their honest convictions, as to
who will best serve the State.
Assuming; that tne Legislature of Cali
fornia is composed of decent and respect- \
able citizens, the stories which are being 'â 
told concerning the consultation of people]
as to who shall be United States Senator
must be untrue and absurd. Every such
convention of politicians or journalists ;
meeting to determine what the Legisla- i
ture shall do is the most burning insult
to the character, manhood and dignity of j
the supreme legislative body of this com- j
inonwealth. Every self-respecting citizen
In California would like to believe at least j
that the choice of Senator lies with the
men who under our form of government
have been vested with the right of selec
tion. Kvery well-wtsher of republican in
stitutions would like to lay the flattering j
unction to his soul that the members of
the Legislature of California are not
slaves upon a Senatorial auction block.
A fair illustration of the manner In
which Burns is seeking to whip legis
lators into line in behalf of his can
didacy was witnessed yesterday at the
Grand Hotel. A prominent attorney
from the San Joaquin Valley was ac
coeted by the political writer of the
Examiner, who is also the secretary of
the Board of Pilot Commissioners, and j
State Senator-elect Sig Bettman, one of j
Burns' stanchest supporters. The at- I
torney was importuned to use his best , j
endeavors to bring the two San Joaquin j
Valley members of the Legislature into j
line for Burns, for the stated reason j
that "this is going to be a landslide j
for Burns and you had better get your j
men in under cover." The political
writer's interest in Burns grows out of
the fact that Burns promised him that
in case of the election of Gage he
(Burns) would secure his (the writer's)
reappointment to the political position
he now holds by grace of a Democratic
Governor.
Those Californians who do not know
Burns are entitled to some knowledge
of the man now that he aspires to be
their representative in the upper house
of the American Congress. The some
what disagreeable task of Informing
the people of the State as to the man
ner of man he is will be undertaken by
The Call, believing that by so doing it
will be discharging a sacred duty.
BACON PLACE GATES
FINALLY TORN 00WN
THE ALLEY IS NOW AN OPEN
STREET.
Secretary Kane Still Continues Ar
resting the Inmates of the Houses
and the Property-Owners.
Acting on instructions from Mayor
Phelan, Superintendent of Streets Am
brose yesterday morning sent his depu
ties to Bacon place to remove the iron
gates which have shut the alley from
the view of people passing along the
Btreet.
The process of tearing down the gates
began shortly after 10 o'clock In the morn
ing and a large crowd of people collected
to Bee the work done. The property own
ers formally objected to the destruction
of their property, but the deputies con
tinued the work and the gates were re
moved without any trouble.
A number of the warrants issued
Wednesday were served yesterday morn
ing on the women who could not be found
the night before. Last night Secretary
Kane served twenty-three c warrants on
the Inmates of the cribs, who were
charged with keeping houses of ill-repute.
The two property owners were again ar
rested for letting houses for immoral pur
poses.
Timothy J. Crowley, on behalf of the
property owners who were anxious that
the gates should remain. In order that the
Iniquities within might be hidden from
prying eyes, appeared before Acting Pre
siding Judge Daingerfleld yesterday and
made application for. a writ of Injunction
prohibiting the tearing down of the gate.
Judge Daingerfleld refused to issue the
Injunction and application, was made to
Judge Troutt, with a like result.

Commerce.
â¢
ANOTHER DELAY RESULTS
ASKS THAT THE "OPEN DOOR"
BE EXTENDED.
Spanish Advices Predict Serious
Trouble for Americans From
the Insurgents in th<j
Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. I.â Anxious as both are
to conclude their work, the United
States and Spanish Peace Commissions
did not hold a joint session to-day.
Their next meeting will be held at 2
o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
' This delay arose from the fact that
'â¢. the Spanish Commissioners at yester
' day's session offered several urgent
| propositions which called for special de
liberation on the part of the Ameri
cans. Spain asks the United States to
grant for a term of years to Spanish
ships carrying Spanish goods or pro
ducts to Porto Rico and Cuba the same
Bivilege as American vessels engaged
the same trade may have, and she
alifies this request by a proviso that
trade privileges be extended to Cuba bo
long as the United States Government
dominates over the island.
eupport of this request the Span
jmmissioners assert that Spain
t, without vital harm, immediate
andon or cut the business rela
so long maintained between the
:r country and the West Indian
territories. They declare that family
j ties and social relations, added to af
fairs of trade maintained throughout
centuries, require gradual dissolution.
They invoke the terms of the treaty of
1819, by which the United States took
over Florida from Spain and the fif
teenth article of which granted Spain
for twelve years the right to send her
goods and products to Florida in Span
ish ships on the same terms as the
ships carrying thither goods and pro
ducts of the United States.
The Spanish Commissioners cite
further the fact that the treaty of 1803
with France for the cession of Louisi
ana granted French and Spanish goods
and products the same terms as Ameri
cans in New Orleans and other ports in
the ceded territory.
Finally Spain points to the American
proposed "open-door" policy in the
Philippines and asks a guarantee of
the same advantage In her West In
dian colonies until trade relations can
by degrees accustom themselves to the
change of sovereignty.
The proposition and the arguments
by which it was supported are consid
ered strongly stated, and the American
Commissioners desire time for delibera
tion. Thus, although" they were busy
until nearly 2 o'clock this afternoon
they were not fully prepared, and
Judge Day sent a message to Senor
Montero Rios, requesting that the Joint
session fixed for this afternoon be post
poned until to-morrow.
Meanwhile the Spanish Commission
ers had been preparing a list of sub
jects for negotiations, supplemented by
suggestions counter to and amendatory
lof the subjects the Americans sub
mitted yesterday. This came to the
American Commissioners to-day In
Spanish, rendering it even more desir
able to postpone the joint session in
order to give time for translation and
consideration. The translation is being
made this evening, and the subject will
be laid before the American Commis
sioners to-morrow morning.
Now that the first gust of griff and
chagrin has passed, the Spanish Com
missioners are meeting the Americana
in a frank spirit that is helpful to an
early completion of the negotiations.
From information which comes to the
correspondent of the Associated Press
from a well-authenticated source late
this evening It seems unlikely that the
commission will finish their work as
soon as had been expected. It is proba
ble that the negotiations will last con
siderably longer.
Madrid has instructed the Spanish
j commissioners on three points to which
! the Americans attach much importance.
! These are the cession of the island in
j the Carolines, the granting of religious
! freedom over the whole of the Carolines
' and the cession of a cable and coaling
i station at Ceuta.
The Spanish Government has in
structed Senor Montero Rios to grrant
none of these, and while Spain may â¦ul
timately yield to them all, it is ad
mitted that the American commission
ers have no power to enforce their de
mands on points not covered by the
protocol. Before Spain does yield the
negotiations are likely to be prolonged
and the United States may have to give
a substantial quid pro quo.
CRISIS NFAR IN
THE PHILIPPINES
Aguinaldo Will Soon Be Ordered to
Disband the Insurgent :
Army.
NEW YORK, Dec. I.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: In the treaty of peace now be
ing negotiated in Paris a provision will
be Included providing for the release of
the political Cuban and Philippine pris
oners held* by : Spain in exchange , for
the release of the Spanish prisoners
held by the Insurgents of the Philip
pines. ,
This provision will require the United
States immediately upon ratification of
the convention to compel the Insurgents
to surrender the opunish soldiers and
priests whom they hold as prisoners.
Just what action Aguinaldo and his
followers will take upon such a demand
Spain, of course, has nothing to do
with, but the authorities are confident
there will be no trouble in obtaining
compliance.
Some days ago General Otis cabled
to the War Department Indicating that
the annexation of the Philippine archi
pelago would be distasteful to Aguin
aldo and the men under his command,
but the authorities do not believe that
ho will revolt against American do
minion.
Just as soon as the treaty is signed
General Otis will be directed to bring
about the disbandment of the Insur
gents, and here will come the trouble,
if it comes at all. Aguinaldo will be In
formed that the Philippines are the
property of the United States and that
he must gl.ve up his dreams of an inde
pendent republic, and it is expected
that, appreciating the strength and re
sources of the American Government,
he will determine to submit to the in
evitable. In disbanding his army the
rare sa:n francisco call, Friday, December 2, 1898.
RATIFICATION OF THE
TREATY IS ASSURED
Poll of the Senators at Washington Shows It Will
Get the Requisite Two-Thirds Vote, In
cluding Some Democrats.
NEW YORK, Dee. I.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald telegraphs: There is every indication
that the peace treaty will be ratified by the Senate during the approaching session of Congress.
Interviews that I have had to-day with the Senators who are here show that the Republicans, with few
exceptions, are generally in favor of the treaty. The Democrats, on the other hand, are disposed to criticise
and to search for grounds of ounosition, but even such Democratic leaders as Senator Jones of Arkansas and
Senator Cockrell of Missouri are not willing to commit themselves in opposition to the treaty.
The tone of interviews with the Democratic Senators justifies the inference that if the treaty of peace
does not undertake to bind the United States to a definite line of policy in dealing with or disposing of the
Philippines, the opposition to the treaty will lack cohesiveness and lead to a speedy ratification of the treaty
by more than a two-thirds vote.
The Senators and all parties will be reluctant to vote against the treaty of peace unless they can find
more substantial ground to stand on than mere opposition to the administration
Fifty-two Senators are counted on as practically certain to favor the ratification of the treaty.
The probability would seem to be that the compact force of the advocates of annexation would have lit
tle difficulty in recruiting from the doubtful list more than enough Senators to give them the sixty votes re
quired to ratify the treaty. When this has been done the real conflict over the final disposition and govern
ment of the Philippines will be postponed until the next Congress.
authorities will probably follow the
same tactics as those which have been
so successful in Cuba.
WANTS NOTHING LESS
THAN INDEPENDENCE
Filipinos Object to Having Their
Homes Treated Like So Much
Merchandise.
MANILA. Dec I.â The Independent
party of the Filipinos Is not disposed to
accept the result of the deliberations of
the Peace Commissioners at Paris,
judging from the tone of the native
press.
The Independencia publishes a partic
ularly bombastic leading article to the
effect that the Filipinos will decline to
permit their homes to be bought and
sold like merchandise. It then repeats
that the Filipinos are ready to fight in
defense of their rights and asserts that
the Government and people are unani
mous in claiming nothing less than in
dependence.
The United States transport Indiana
arrived here this morning and the Nero
sailed for home.
Two companies of Pennsylvanians
have been transferred to Corregidor
Island.
With the exception of a battalion of
the Washington Regiment, the new
troops have not been landed.
INSURGENTS MAY HAVE
TO BE DISCIPLINED
Reported They Will Not Recognize
the Cession to the United
States.
MADRID, Dec. I.â Advices from the
Philippine Islands say the insurgents
there have decided not to recognize the
cession of the islands to the United
States and that they will resist to the
last. It is also claimed that the United
States will require 70,000 troops to put
down the rebellion, and it is alleged
that the insurgents hold 10,000 Spanish
prisoners, whom they will force to
serve against the Americans.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE MAINE DISASTER
NEW YORK, Dec. I.â A Paris cable
to the World says: Among the articles
of the peace treaty submitted by the
Spaniards is one that provides that the
United States and Spain shall appoint
an International commission of seven
experts from each country to name one
of its citizens, one Briton and one
Frenchman, with a German to be presi
dent. This commission is to determine
the responsibility for the Maine dis
aster.
If Spain is responsible she is to send
a warship to salute the American Hag
at New York. If she is not the United
States is to pay all the expenses of the
commission.
FRUIT GROWERS WILL
REORGANIZE FREE MARKET
An Important Resolution Relating
to the San Francisco Exchange
Is Adopted.
FRESNO, Dec. I.â When the State
Fruit Growers' Convention was called to
order this morning the first matter to
come up was the consideration of the
resolutions introduced the preceding day
in reference to the California Exchange
and the free public market of San Fran
cisco. It was proposed to reorganize the
exchange which was formed about nve
years ago for the purpose of giving out
information about the frutt market. The
exchange has since lapsed into Innocuous
desuetude, and it is the intention to re
vive it and place it in charge of the
movement for a free public market on the
San Francisco water front.
Though there waÂ» some opposition to
the resolutions, led by Rubs Stephens and
ex-Senator Johnson, the resolutions were
carried by a good majority.
Secretary Lelnng then read a paper
on the condemning of wormy and other
wise infected fruit, and State Quarantine
Officer Craw followed with an interest-
Ing address In which he urged the im
portance of passing laws that would pre
vent the introduction Into California of

DIRECTED AGAINST
THE HIGHBINDERS
China Wanted to Nego
tiate a New Treaty.
TO EXTRADITE CRIMINALS
WOULD BID THIS COUNTRY OF
AN UNDEoIRABLE*T:LASS.
But the Proposition Was Not Favor
ably Received at Washingtoa
Because of Its Harsh
Nature.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. I.â The Chi
nese Government, through its Minister,
Wu Ting Fang, has broached to the au
thorities here the willingness of China
to negotiate an extradition treaty, ap
plicable to all criminals, but intended
in particular to reach the highbinders.
It was represented to the officials
here that, as the highbinders had
proved such a difficult class for the lo
cal police authorities in this country to
deal with, China would assume the
burden of detection and punishment if
an extradition treaty could be nego
tiated. The purpose was to have China
assume all the cost of apprehending
and transporting the guilty parties.
This could be done through the ma
chinery of the Chinese Consular serv
ice at San Francisco and other West
ern points, which, being conducted by
native "Chinese, was better able to
know the ramifications of an organiza
tion made up entirely of Chinese. By
doing this China felt that she would rid
this country of those responsible for
much of the ill-feeling toward the Chi
nese as a class.
While willing to get rid of Chinese
highbinders and all other Chinese
criminals, the authorities here foresaw
serious legal objections to such a
treaty. The method of trial and pun
ishment in China are very summary.
The proposal, therefore, was open to
the objection that this country was sur
rendering persons domiciled within its
borders to a foreign country for harsh
and unusual prosecution and punish
ment. Little doubt was entertained
here that if China once secured posses
sion of the highbinders short work
would be made 'of them owing to the
prejudice they have brought upon the
Government. China was ready to over
come this objection as far as possible
by providing for a full hearing or trial
in this country before the parties were
turned over to the Chinese officials for
deportation home.
This, however, did not fully meet the
legal objections against the proposi
tion. Moreover, it was believed the
Senate, to which such a treaty would
have to be referred for ratification,
would not act favorably upon it and
that it would stir up animosities and
agitations on the Chinese question in
general rather than accomplish any
special good in the direction desired.
PLEADS FOR CHINESE
IN THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, Dec. I.â The Wash
ington Star prints this afternoon an in
terview with Wu Ting Fang, the Chi
nese Minister, concerning the probabil
ity ot the enforcement of the Chinese
exclusion law In the Philippines when
the Islands shall come under the con
trol of the United States.
Wu expresses satisfaction at the con
clusion of the peace negotiations, as
peace between the United States and
Spain is thereby Insured. He depre
cates war in all its phases and believes
that all international differences should
be submitted to an arbitrage tribunal
for settlement. Regarding the applica
tion of the Chinese exclusion law to
the Philippines Wu said:
"I wish to appeal to the American
people not to enforce the Chinese ex
clusion law In those Jslands. By do
ing 1 so a great injustice will be done my
countrymen and the many opportuni
ties of a prosperous and happy life will
be denied them. There are a great
many Chinese in the Philippines and
all of them are a credit to the archi
pelago. The Chinese population there
is entirely different from that in your
western countries. In the Philippines
my countrymen are engaged in every
walk of life. There are innumerable
artisans, farmers, storekeepers, mer
chants, traders, and, in fact, business
men of every legitimate character."

An Intruder at the Pos

MRS. HENT NOT WELCOME
BUT FORCED HERSELF INTO THE
FASHIONABLE AFFAIR.
Trouble Caused by a Relative of the
Fair Brideâ Began at Belvedere
and Wound Up on the
Wharf Here.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TIBURON, Dec. I.â Behind the glare
and glitter of the fashionable Postley-
Cook wedding at Belvedere yesterday
danced the grim family skeleton, its
rattling bones keeping an unwelcome
accompaniment to the music of the
orchestra. And the specter grinned in
triumph when the apple of discord was
hurled into the festive gathering in the
person of Mrs. Ada Hent of Sausalito,
an aunt of Miss Ethel Cook, the fair
belle whose hand was given to Mr.
Postley of New York.
In fact, Mrs. Hent's advent necessi
tated the presence of a sturdy limb of
the law, whom Dr. Byron Haines of
Belvedere has to thank for the fact
that his face is not furrowed by the
finger nials of that irate lady. Mrs.
Hent, who was the sister of the bride's
deceased father, is also Mrs. Haines'
mother. Her former husband was
named Barry. For a long time Mrs.
Hent has been at outs with the other
members of the family, and none of
them would speak to her, nor was she
invited to the wedding.
It is stated that the original dispute
arose over an heirloom in the shape of
an oriental fan, which she claimed be
longed to her, but which her brother
refused to relinquish. About thirty min
utes after the nuptials Mrs. Hent made
her debut on the scene, having come
from Sausalito with a friend in a
launch. She had blood in her eye, and a
messenger was hastily dispatched for
an officer. Deputy Constable Frank
Crosby responded, and when he arrived
at the Cook residence found his hands
full in keeping Mrs. Hent from creating
a scene. When the wedding party went
aboard the steamship Tiburon Attor
ney Henry E. Highton, whose wife is
a sister of Mrs. Cook, asked Constable
McLane to accompany them across the
bay, as the unwelcome visitor insisted
on going along in spite of earnest re
monstrances. On the way to San Fran
cipco she kept quiet under the officer's
watchful eye, but created a scene at the
wharf.
As the party was disembarking Mis.
Hent uttered a scream of rage and flew
at Dr. Hainee. Constable McLane in
terposed and had to restrain her for
cibly from carrying out her intent.
While she was detained by the officer
the party entered hacks and drove rap
idly away, leaving her screaming with
rage and making direful threats. Every
thing pc-ssible has been done to keep
the Btory from beooming public prop
erty. Constable McLane, probably act
ing under Instructions, refused to dis
cuss the affair.
PLUNGER GILLETT
ISJJNDER ARREST
It Is Said That His Captors Are
Negotiating Their Price for
Giving Him Up to
Creditors.
KANSAS CITY, Dec. I.â lt is stated
here to-night that Grant G. Gillett, the
Kansas cattle man whose financial col
lapse last week revealed the fact that in
less than three years he had piled up
an indebtedness of more than $1,500,000, is
under arrest somewhere !n the South
west.
Charles A, Shaeffer, president of tne
George Holmes Commission Company,
swore out a warrant here to-day charg
ing Gillett with having obtained $19,500 by
false pretenses. The warrant was placed
in the hands of an officer, and the officer
left the city to-night.
M. A. Fyke, attorney for the Holmes
company, to-night made this statement 1
"Gillett Is under arrest in Mexico. An
officer has gone for him, and we will get
him back, we hope, at a very early date "
In other quarters it is stated almost as
positively that Gillett is not in Mexico
but that he is in custody on American
soil that ho has a large sum of money
In hlB possession, that his captors are
negotiating with his creditors here to ex
act a stated percentage of the money as
their price for turning Gillett and the
funds over to his creditors.

JOCKEY DEVIN'S
GUARDIANSHIP
Legal Battle for Control
V" of a Bright Boy. -' >ooo o
ROMANTIC CAREER REVIEWED
THE LAD'S LIFE BEFORE HE BE
CAME A RIDER.
In Court He Declares That He Wants
to Stay With Thomas H.
Boyle, His Friend and
Employer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. I.â There was a
legal battle in the Superior Court to
day for the possession of a boy that has
aroused considerable interest among
horsemen throughout the State. The
boy is Frank Devin, 14 years old who
has attained considerable of a reputa
tion as a jockey, and who seeks to have
Thomas H. Boyle, the well-know^
horseman, made his guardian.
The petition for guardianship is being
opposed by W. B. Devin and wife, who
reared the young jockey. When Devin
was but thirteen months old he was a
waif, and an aged woman, who had him
in charge, made continual application
to the Board of Supervisors of Sacra
mento County for aid in his support.
George O. Bates, who was then Su
pervisor, tiring of these continual ap
plications, declared to the woman one
day that if she would give him the boy
he would care for him. The woman took
him at his word there and then, and
Bates placed the little fellow In charge
of his daughter, Mrs. W. B. Devin, who
named him Frank Devin.
Three years ago Thomas Boyle found
Frank running around on the streets
and offered to take charge of him. Per
mission was granted, although there
was no legal agreement to that effect.
Under Boyle's tutelage Devin has blos
somed into a strong rider with a prom
ising future before hi.m. Under the cir
cumstances Boyle was anxious to se
cure legal control of his little friend,
and upon Boyle's suggestion Devin ap
plied to have Boyle appointed his guar
dian.
On the witness stand to-day Boyle
declared that Devin had ridden a great
many winning mounts and had made
as high as $400 or {500 a month. He de
clared that If he was appointed guar
dian all the money earned by the boy
would be banked In the boy's name.
He denied that he had any interest in
the boy other than a strong personal
liking and a desire to see him succeed.
As guardian, however, he would expect
the boy to ride his mounts tree of
charge, but would see that he had
ample opportunity to secure outside
mounts.
These statements were made in an
swer to questions asked by counsel for
the Devins, for the evident purpose of
showing that Boyle simply wanted to
control the boy's earnings, which. It
was hinted, were very considerable in
a year. Boyle's counsel, c-n the other
hand, attempted to show that this is
the interest the Devins have in the case,
and that before the earning capacity
of the boy was known to them they
neglected him.
The interesting feature of the case
was the testimony of Jockey Frank
Devin, who declared that he had ap
plied to have Boyle appointed guardian
entirely of his o-wn free will. He was
moved to do this, he said, because
Boyle had been his friend and to him
he owed his success. When asked by
opposing counsel if he would not ac
cept a liberal offer from Burns &
Waterhouse he replied that they could
have second call if they wanted it, but
that Boyle should have first call, free
of charge. He said he proposed to stay
by his benefactor.
Young Devin has ridden on nearly
every track in the State, making his
best records this season at Los Angeles
and Ingleside.
The petition for guardianship will be
taken under advisement by the Â«ourt.

NEW ZEALAND TO
FAVOR THIS CITY
To Discriminate Against
Canadian Lines.
IN THE MAIL CONTRACTS
AIDED BY THE NEW SOUTH
WALES AUTHORITIES.
Australasia Ready to Terminate the
Vancouver Service and Substitute
East Fortnightly Steamers
to San Francisco.
. Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 1 â Accord
ing to advices received here to-day hy
the steamship Miowera, Australia and
New Zealand will discriminate against
the Canadian steamship lines in favor
of San Francisco In the matter of mail
contracts. In the House of Representa
tives at Wellington, N. Z., just before
the Miowera sailed, it was moved that
the San Francisco and Vancouver mail
services be continued for another year
from April 1 next. It was then an
nounced that the Government had re
ceived a communication from the New
South Wales authorities stating that
that colony would renew the San Fran
cisco service contract, but not the Van
couver. Mr, Ward made a long speech
in favor of the San Francisco contract,
claiming that it was purely a matter of
business, and that sentiment should
net be permitted to interfere.
The New South Wales authorities, he
said, were not likely to renew the Van
couver contracts, as they believed that
a very much better service could be
brought into operation in a very short
time across the Pacific. San Francisco,
knowing this was demanded, would put
on a faster line c-f steamships than the
Canadians could.
A select committee of the House has
reported in favor of faster steamships
being employed in the San Francisco
service. The committee thought it
doubtful whether the Vancouver ser
vice could be long continued, and in the
event of its cessation a fast fortnightly
San Francisco service should be sub
stituted and also subsidized.

Precia! Dispatch to The Call.
VINEYARD HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 1.
The schooners Amelia G. Ireland of
New York and Clara Leavitt of
Portland, Mo., were wrecked Saturday
night near the Gayhead life saving sta
tion. The captain, mate and four sea- j
men from the Leavitt and one seaman
from the Ireland were drowned.
It was about 9:30 o'clock, in the
fiercest of the storm, that the Gayhead
life saving patrol saw the flash of a
torch In the direction of Dogfish bar.
As quickly as possible Captain Hayman
mustered his crew and in a few min
utes a life boat and all the apparatus
necessary, drawn by a yoke of oxen,
â was on its way to the nearest point to
the bar, which was two and one-half
miles from the station-
It was il o'clock before the men
reached the portion they sought. They
â¢were top late. jWhen they came to the
beach, wreckage from the vessel was
coming ashore, giving evidence that she
had gone to pieces. A fragment showed
thevesÃel to have been the Clara L.eav

Into the storm in an effort to discover
another poflAible survivor another sig
nal torch Vk-Â«ia seen from a vessel which
was at that moment almost upon the
bar. The next, instant she struck, but
vent "ii in a position a little less cx
i t<j the fury of the wave*, and
the did not go to pieces. An attempt
vrajS made t" launch the life boat, but it
I t back like a chip. It was
then jdeeided to try shooting a line to
the wreck, but this could not be done
until .daylight. With the first appear
ance of dawn the gun carriage was
drawn up for service. Seven men could
be seen clinging to the rigging of the
I. A iine was shot toward the
schooner, but it fell short. The attempt
;welve times repeated without suc
cess. Meanwhile the wind shifted more
to the northerly and was colder and the
Know had turned to hail.
Spurred by the sight of the men and
the increasing severity of the storm
another trial of the surf boat was
made. The craft was tossed back on
the beach. Seven tinieg the boat was
launched and the most persistent ef
forts of the crew to breast the waves
were of no avail. On *he eighth trial,
however, success came and under the
tremendous strokes of the men the boat
was driven from wave to wave till she
reached the vessel. One seaman had
perished, but the captain, mate and
four sailors, who were barely alive,
were rescued and taken to the station.
The vessel was the Amelia G. Ireland.
"When the messenger who brought the
Btory of the wreck and rescue left Gay
h*.ad the shipwrecked men were all In
a serious condition from exposure.
Several members of the life sav
ing crew were more or less injured
while engaged in their attempt at res
cue. The Clara Leavitt was a three
master of 395.85 tons, 127 feet long and
was built at Cape Elizabeth, Me., in
The Amelia G. Ireland was also a
three-master. She was owned by the
Tidewater Oil Company of New York,
and was bound from Bayonne. N. J.,
to Boston, with a cargo of oil in tanks.
She was of 'J7i).31 net tons, 124 feet long
and was built in Somerset County, Md.,

PROVIXCETOWN, Mass., Dec. I.â
Another day has passed andthe mys
tery of the steamer Portland has not
been given up by the sea. It was a day
of constant watching of more than
thirty miles of coast line and the sea
grudgingly held its victims,; yielding
only five. Twenty-five bodies have
been recovered out of the entire pas
senger crew list, the exact number of
which is still unknown. The number
of people who went to their death in
â 'ortiand will never be known, but
almost hourly persons are reported
â \k fmm different places in New
â  England, until now it seems possible
that the number was over 150. Of the
bodies recovered hereabouts, thirteen
have been identified and eight remain
to be named. The identified are:

BALTIMORE, Dec. 1. â Captain
Henry O. Appleby and the crew of the
American bark St. Lucie, which is now
supposed to be at the bottom of the At

The St. Lucie left New York Friday
with a general cargo for Santos, Brazil.
Saturday morning the wind freshened
to a stiff gale and by night was blowing
almost a hurricane. Sunday was a day
of terror for all on board. The wind in
creased in fury, and at noon the bow
sprit, jibboom, fore and main topmasts
went by the board. To. make matters
worse the vessel began leaking badly.
Monday morning the deckload of lum
ber and rosin washed overboard and
the battered wreck was tossed over on
her beam ends. In the afternoon a big
sea broke over her, stove in her cabin j
doors and flooded everything. Fearing '
that she was about to go under at once,
an attempt was made to launch her
single available boat, and when Beven
of the luckles* seamen had leaped into
it it capsized and was smashed against
the ship's side. Six half-drowned men
struggled back to the wreck, but Hey
meyer was lost. At 2 o'clock on Tues

which parted from her tow, the Orion,
on Sunday, or of the schooner City of
Augusta, which parted her hawser and
was blown to sea on Monday. Grave
fears are entertained for the safety of
the crews of both craft, as neither has
been seen by incoming vessels. The
city of Augusta has a crew of eight
men and the Enos Soule had four men
on board, ;

MYSTERY OF A DEATH
IN A LODGING-HOUSE
PATRICK GALLAGHER'S STJS- j
PICIODo DEMISE.
Patrick Gallagher, a 65-year old cattle j
! dealer from Nevada, died suddenly in a j
' lodging-house at 329 Bush street last cv- i
ening and the circumstances surround- j
ing his demise are so suspicious that the
1 police are Investigating the case to see
! if the man was not robbbed and. his
death is not indirectly chargeable to
some one.
Deputy Coroner Hallett went for the
i body, and from the fact that he could
i not find the man's clothing and that
there was no money in his possession he
immediately became suspicious and no
tified the police that the case was one
I worthy of investigation. Detective
I Crockett and Officer Caples were detailed
I on the case and made a report that the
i man died of heart disease. To Hallett
i Al White, in whose lodgingi-house Gal
' lagher died, stated that the man had no
I money and that he, White, would see
that he was buried. The ; barkeeper,
named Duffy, told the Deputy Coroner
that Gallagher had a bank book showing
a deposit of between $3000 and $4000 in the
Hibernia -Bank.
Gallagher came to White's saloon last
i Sunday night and took a room in the
j lodging-house. From that time he stay
ed in the room drinking and carousing
] until the time of his fleath. A bar bill
i of over $100 stands against the dead man
! at White's saloon, and it Js said that be-
I sides this he signed checks for something
; like $800.
Deputy Hallett and Officer Caples state
i that White has levied an attachment on
the bank account through Jake Raver,
the collector, and it ie said that Raver,
' has the bank book. Mr. White denies
that there is anything wrong in the
transaction.
SUDDEN DEATH OF
DR. GEORGE W. RACHEL
OVERCOME WHILE LEA VINO
THE ALCAZAR BUILDING.
He Had Just Been Elected Physician
for Court Washington, Foresters
of America.
Dr. George W. Rachel, who has been
for many years one of the most promi
nent physicians in the city, dropped dead
last night, presumably from heart fail
ure.
Deceased had been in attendance at a
meeting of Court Washington, Foresters
of America, in the Alcazar building, and
had just been selected as physician for
the lodge. When the meeting adjourned
he went into a saloon on the ground floor
of the building and asked the bartender
to let him sit down for a few minutes, as
he felt weak. He was given a chair in
the back room, where he tried to admin
ister a hypodermic injection, but passed
away in the act.
Dr. Rachel was about 55 years of age
ami lived with his wife at 1030 Mission
street. He has always stuck closely to
his profession, and about the only office
he has ever held was that of autopsy sur
geon during Coroner Hawkins' first term.
The body was taken to Porter & White's
undertaking parlors.
Joseph Clark Arraigned.
Joseph Clark, the murderer of Joseph P.
Gross, assistant foreman of fire engine 5.
was taken before Judge Low yesterday
morning, and as the prosecution was not
ready to proceed the case was continued
for a week. Meantime the Coroner's in
quest will be held.
Detective Reynolds, who was detailed
on the case, reported to Chief Lees yes
terday that he had called upon Mrs.
Clark at her residence, 716 Green street,
and found the family happily situated,
the children contributing to the general
support. Mrs. Clark is a woman over 40
years of age. She stated that Gross was
a boarder at the house, but he did not
Bleep there. He was a quiet man. who
minded his own business and never over
stepped the bounds of propriety. Why
her husband should have been jealous of
him was a mystery to her.
In the neighborhood Clark was known
as a quarrelsome drunkard, who desert
ed his family three years ago and failed
to contribute to their support.
THIRTEEN
LETTERS AND
A KNOCKOUT
E. J. Mulverill Drub
bed as the Author.
EX-SHERIFF TUNSTED ACTS
OTHER MEN FAVORED BY THE
EPISTLES ALSO ENRAGED.
The Classic Neighborhood of San An
selmo Disturbed by a Scandal
That May Be Aired in
the Courts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. I.â Thirteen
anonymous letters have thrown the
classic neighborhood of San Anselmo
Into a furor, and resulted in E. J. Mul
verill, who is accused of being their
author, being soundly drubbed by ex-
Sher"* James Tunsted, who is now in
the real estate business. Three weeks
ago Tunsted received an anonymous
typewritten letter, stating that while
he filled the position of Sheriff he had
j "squared" several flagrant cases, that
[ he was "trying to lift his head from
i the slime in which he swam," and that
j the people would resent this by pun
i ishing him severely.
Tunsted at once surmised that Mul
verill had written the communication
and took steps to learn if such were
true. He steadily refuses to discuss the
I affai-. but the facts, as furnished by
an i-*'mate friend, are alleged to be
as follows: Mulverill came to reside
with Mr. Fobs, a capitalist of San An
eelmo, about five years ago. He has
made many enemies, the first being
Attorney John Richards, who told
I Fobs that he would be a welcome vis
| itor but that Mulverill was not wanted
at his house. Shortly afterward the
lawyer received a letter couched in
j most vituperative language. Then At
{ torney I. F. Crisp, who is connected
with the law firm of Adams & Adams,
offended Mulverill, and shortly after
ward that firm received an anonymous
letter, which warned them against em
ploying further "reprehensiole black
guards," naming Crisp.
Next Station Agent Morris fell out
with Mulverill, and before long J. B.
Stetson, president of the North Pacific
Coast Railway, was written to and told
that Morris was not attending to his
duty and should be discharged. This
letter was signed with the name of
Coleman. Tunsted had some words with
Mulverill and shortly afterward re
i ceived the letter referred to in the fore
| going.
A week ago last Monday evening
! Tunsted and the friend who furnishes
j this information went down to the sta
tion to get the evening paper. There
they met Mulverill, and Tunsted in
quired why he had sent him such a
letter. According to this witness, Mul
verill replied that it was none of his
j business, and, stooping, picked up a
I handful of sand and threw it in the
I ex-Sheriff's face. Tunsted then grabbed
I hold of Mulverill's nose and slapped
him in no gentle manner. Mulverill is
alleged to have begged for mercy, and
informed his castigator that he had re
j ceived the information contained in the
i letter from George D. Shearer, a real
I estate dealer in this city. He was per
j mitted to leave after what was re
garded as a tacit admission of his guilt,
the only fact in the case which Tunsted
himself will give out for publication.
An attempt was made to interview
Mulverill and Foss this evening, but no
I response was elicited by loud and re
j peated knocking at the door of Mr.
I Foss' residence, though a lady living
opposite said they were undoubtedly at
home. To others Mulverill has denied
j his guilt.
George D. Shearer, who is also In the
real estate business, was a partner of
ex-Sheriff Tunsted eleven years ago.
When seen this evening he said: "Mr.
Mulverill is a correspondent of several
Eastern papers and a perfect gentle
man. I frequently dine with him and
Mr. Foss and they with me. He is per
fectly innocent of the charge of writing
these letters. He tells me that when
Tunsted assaulted him the lantern he
was carrying was kicked out of his
hand, and that he was felled to the
ground and repeatedly kicked, his as
sailant exclaiming at the same time:
I 'I'll bet you got that pack of lies from
j Shearer.' The end of this thing is not
yet, you mark my words for that."
Tunsted has placed all the evidence
he holds in the possession of his attor- I
ney, James W. Keyes, and threatens a j
suit at law. He has also shown the |
letters to Postofflce Inspector Monroe,
and if he can prove that Mulverill is !
the author of the communications that
have caused the trouble will endea\ r or
to have him prosecuted for a misuse of i
the mails. Mulverill also threatens J
suit, and, taken all in all. a lively time j
is ahead for all the participants in the
affair. Attorney Keyes asserts that he
is in a position to know that thp in
formation furnished The Call regarding !
the affair is correct, and that if it comes !
to a suit at law Mulverill will be the I
sufferer.
J. S. Mulverill came to this coast '
about nine years ago. It Is said that |
he was a clerk in vhe Gilsey House, New I

there. He was at one time employed
on the Hotel Gazette In this city. It
is reported that he got "the ax" and
for a time drifted around with noth
ing to do. Through Fred O. Stanton,
at one time chief clerk at the Palace,
Mulverill met Foss who is a wealthy
old bachelor. He amassed a fortune
back in the East through his mining
Interests. Stanton was a protege of |
Foes'. Mulverill thought he saw a |
good thing In Foss. and began to make j
up to him and at the same time to give
Stanton the "back tap" until he seuc
ceeded in undoing him In Foss' favor j
and ingratiating himself In his place. |
The residents of San Anselmo declare,
so it Is reported, that Mulverill has
hypnotized Foss. It Is said that th * two
on one occasion had a fight and that
Mulverill struck Foss in the face,
knocking out an eye. â¢ Despite this Mul
verill still retains his influence and
poll with the old man, and what he
says is law so far as Foss is concerned.
Stanton Is now In New York.

PARCELS POST
ADVOCATED BY
EAST AND WEST
Congressmen Deluged
With Petitions.
COMMERCIAL MEN ACTIVE
MERCHANDISE SHOULD BE CAR
RIED CHEAPLY.
Pressure Brought to Bear to Secure I
Legislation That May Deprive
Tax-Dodging Companies of
Much Business.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. Dec. 1.
Members of Congress are being del
uged with petitions from commercial
bodies of various cities and towns in
favor of the passage by Congress at the
coming session of a bill establishing a
cheap "parcels post," intended to com
pete with express companies, which are
not in good odor because they have en
deavored to evade the payment of the
war revenue tax. The movement in
j favor of a cheap "parcels post" orlg
j lnated in the East, but, judging from
I the letters and petitions received by
Western members of Congress, the far
West is also aroused.
Packages are now sent through the
malls as "merchandise," as everybody
knows, but the rates are higher than
the express companies charge. It is
proposed to make the rates for postage
packages as low or lower than the ex
press companies. This system is in
vogue in England and various Conti
nental countries and is very popular.
Several members of Conrress have
prepared bills on this subject, which
they will present on the opening day.
It is considered doubtful, however,
whether the Postoffices and Postroads
Committee will act at once on such
measures, for the Postoffice Department
is of the opinion that the transporta
tion of such packages would, under
present conditions, prove to be a losing
investment. There is an annual deficit
in the Postofflce Department. The ex
penditures have for many years been
far in excess of the receipts, chief
among the reasons being the fact that
railroads have resorted to fraudulent
practices when mall is weighed at cer
tain Intervals, on vhich is based yearly
contracts. The mails are also burden
ed with free matter, and a certain class
of printed matter classed as "periodi
cals" Is allowed to go at a cheaper rate
than it should.
All of these abuses will be called to
the attention of Congress by a special
committee, of which Congressman
Loud is chairman. The Postofflce De
partment is of the opinion that if the
Loud bill regulating second-class postal
matter is passed the postal receipts
may equal expenditures.
"In this case," says First Assistant
Postmaster General Heath, "Congress
will undoubtedly pass a cheap parcels
post bill."

PREPARING FOR
MIDWINTER MEET
Events Arranged by Gar
den City Wheelmen.
SWIFT RIDERS TO ENTER
MATCH BETWEEN STEVENS
AND DOWNING ON CARD.
Some of the Best Known Cyclers on
the Coast Will Compete and
Great Sport May Be
Expected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. I.â Preparations for
the great midwinter race meet to take
place under the auspices of the Garden
City Wheelmen at Cyclers' Park on
Monday, January 2, are being rapidly
pushed, and the indications are that It
will be even more successful than the
meet given by the wheelmen on Sep
tember 9.
The race meet committee, with Joseph
A. Deslmone as chairman and Robert
J. Butler as secretary, has already or
ganized, and the work of arranging de
tails and advertising the event has
begun.
The principal attraction will be the
match race between the two profes
sionals, Orlando L. Stevens. McFar
land's riding mate, and the fastest
short-distance sprinter in the world,
and Hardy Downing, whose fame as a
plucky and speedy rider has already
spread throughout the State. The race
will be mile heats, best two out of
three, and a purse of $250 has been
hung up as an attraction. Kid Down
ing wants to go East next season on the
national circuit and to win this race
would mean much to him. Both riders
are training daily on the cement track,
assisted by a number of pacemakers.
There will be two competition races,
a one-mile open and a one-mile-handi
cap. It is the desire of the race pro
moters to make the mile open a cham
pionship event in whici case it is prob
able that Hill and F!;man of Los An
geles would enter.
Cabby Cotter, the amateur champion
s of the Northwest, has arrived in this
city, and he, too, commenced active
training. Cotter says he will make it
warm for some of the California riders,
and it is more than likely that he will
do so.
Jack Wing, a resident of this city,
but a member of the Olympic Club, has
challenged Bunt Smith for a match
race on that day with a side bet of $35.
In case Smith refuses to accept the
challenge is open to any Pacific coast
amateur. It is very probable that
Smith and Wing will ride, and this will
undoubtedly prove to be a drawing
card.
Floyd McFarland will give a mile ex
hibition. He is greatly interested in
the meet and is doing all that he can to
make it a success.
The Indications are that a large num
ber of San Francisco riders will enter
either one or both of the amateur
events.
MRS. GROSS ARRESTED
FOR THE DESERT CRIME
Declares She Took No Part in thÂ«
Murder, and Says Hancock Did
the Killing.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. I.â Mrs. Gross,
the former mistress of John Hancock,
whom the latter accused of complicity
In the murder of Dr. George Engelke
and Pete Edminston on the desert in
Southern Nevada, was arrested in this
city to-night upon request of the Sher
iff of Lincoln County, Nevada. Mrs.
Gross declares that she took no part in
the murder. She sticks to her original
story that Hancock did the killing sin
gle-handed, first braining the men
while they slept and then shooting
them through the head.
Sheriff Burr received a telegram to
sight from the Sheriff of Lincoln
County, Nevada, stating that the bodies
of the murdered men had been found,
and that they had evidently met their
fate in the manner described by Mrs.
Gross.
Billiard Tournament.
The members of the San Francisco Club
have arranged a billiard tournament,
which will continue throughout the month
of December. It will be exclusively for
members, and pastime and pleasure is all
the players seek. The first series of four
games was played last night and was wit
nessed by a large number of gentlemen.
The players were clever with their cues
and the games were exceeding interesting.
The first was played by Judge G. H.
Bahrs and Charles Bliss. Bahrs proved
the victor, scoring 70 points to Bliss' 54.
In the second contest General Warfleld
scored 100, while Mr. Slosson, his oppo
nent, listed 72. In the third contest Mr.
Clinch played 100 points to Mr. Zak's 80
and was beaten by Zak by 30 points. Mr.
Zak played 80 points to Mr. Biles' 70 In the
last game and was heat en by 11 points.

NAVAL MEN ARE
BOOMING DEWEY
FOR PRESIDENT
Nothing Stands in His
Way.
ONLY HIS WISH NECESSARY
WILL RETURN AS THE HEBO OF
THE WAB. .
Ban Francisco Expected to Lead in a
Series of Great Popular Demon
strations in His
Honor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rigrgs House,
Washington, Dec. 1.
The prospect that Dewey may yield
to the wishes of his friends and admir
ers and consent to become a Presiden
tial candidate Is much discussed here
at present, especially at the Army and
Navy Club.
It is pointed out that on December 13,
1599, Rear Admiral Dewey is to be re
tired. He is expected to reaph San
Francisco In March or April, 1900, just
before the nominating conventions
meet. It is expected his reception there
â¢will be a tremendous ovation, equaling
or surpassing that when Grant landed
from hie trip around the world.
Dewey's trip East will be that of a
conqueror. Wherever he passes great
popular demonstrations will be held,
ard the eyes of the entire nation will
br riveted on him.
A naval officer, discussing the matter
to-day, said In reply to a question as to
Dewey's political predilections: "It
makps no difference. General Grant be-
Joncre-3 to no party after the Civil War.
but the Republican party claimed him
first, and that settled It. It makes no
difference to what party Dewey belongs
H"\v; the party that nominates him will
nominate the winner.
"There were six rear admirals on the
active list when the war began, and all
of them were kept in the background;
not one of them was permitteed to go
to ppa. Naval officers were thus held
back. Just as General Miles was. But
Dewey's performance was something
that no politician could foresee. He is
the real war hero to-day, and he will
remain in the forefront until 1900.
"I remember when the Civil War con
cluded and Grant was a lieutenant
general, the polltlcans underto. >k to
Fhelve him by giving him the thanks
of Congress, a handsome sword, the
grade of general and whole oceans of
flattery, but it did not work. When the
time came Grant announced he wanted
the Presidency, and the politicians soon
got out of his way and jostled each
nth' r about in their efforts to get Into
his band wagon. That will happen in
1900, when Dewey comes."
HYDRAULIC MINING
IN THE KLONDIKE
New Regulations Adopted Whereby
the Yukon Pioneers Have an
Advantage.
NEW YORK. Dec. I.â An Ottawa (Ont.) |
special to the Herald says: New regula
tions have been adopted for hydraulic
mining in the Yukon. The areas a r c to
be from one to five miles in length and i
will te granted only by public tender. Ex
ception Is made, however, in the case of
parties from the Klondike who have al- i
ready applied. They are treated as pio
neers, and not only get their concession
without competition or payment of bo- i
nus, but are exempted from dues. These
dues are $150 a year per mile frontage
and obligation to perform assessment
work yearly to the value of $5000.
On all commissions, however, the usual
royalty will be collected on an output of
over $25,000 a year. It Is expected this i
royalty will be reduced to two per cent.
Other conditions are that the applicant j
furnishes proof of having resided fn the j
Yukon and file a certificate that he has '
examined the ground applied for, pros- !
pected it and ascertained that it Is not j
suitable for mining by ordinary placer
methods.
A number of Americans have qualified !
under the pioneer clause and will get
their areas subject to special advantages.
These properties will be developed by
American capital.

IMPORTANT ACTION
OF UNION PACIFIC
Planning for Entrance
to San Francisco.
EXCHANGE OF ITS STOCK
WILL BRING CONTROL OF THE
REQUIRED LINE.
Indirect Methods Adopted for Secur
ing the Much Coveted Oregon
Railroad and Navigation
Company.
NEW YORK, Deo. I.â At a meeting of
the directors of the Union Pacific Rail
road held in this city to-day it was de
cided to recommend to' the stockholders,
at a special meeting to be called for the
purpose, that authorization be given for
an exchange of Union Pacific stock for
that of the Oregon Short Line Company.
It is proposed that in the event of the
stockholders ratifying this action ex
change shall be made for at least two
thirds of the Oregon Short Line, while as
to the remaining one-third the matter of
exchange shall be left to the discretion
of the Union Pacific directors.
By the proposed exchange of stock the
Union Pacific will be placed in a position
whereby it will be enabled to elect one
third of the directors of the Oregon Rail
road and Navigation Company. Under
the existing voting trust or the latter the
preferred shareholders elect two-thirds
of the board of directors and a majority
of the preferred stock is held in escrow for
the joint benefit of the Union Pacific,
Great Northern and Northern Pacific com
Â§anies. The ownership of the Oregon
hort Line stock by the Union Pacific,
therefore, will give the Union Pacific the
control of the affairs of the Oregon Navi
gation Company, and therein lies the chief
Flgnificance of to-day's action by the
Union Pacific directors.
OBSTRUCTIONS IN
SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR
Congressman Loud Striving to Secure
Legislation for Their
Removal.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. I.âCongress
man Loud hopes there will be a river
and harbor bill passed by Congress at
the coming short session, for he is
anxious to secure an appropriation for
! the removal of Arch and Shag rocks,
j which have for so long imperiled navi
â  gation in San Francisco harbor.
i Through his efforts Congress provided
| for surveys, and the engineers' reports
| recommending their removal and sub-
I mitting estimates of the cost will be
transmitted to Congress by the Secre
tary of War.
The War Department engineers' re
ports will show Congress that Arch
Rock is a bold, high rock, standing
i thirty feet above low water and is
very conspicuous, situated about two
thirds of a mile west: of Aleatras and
half a mile north of the regular chart
i course followed in entering the harbor.
Shag Rock No. 1 lies in the track of
ferry-boats plying between San Fran
cisco and Sausalito. It is a small pin
nacle rising four feet above high water
j and surrounded by deep wjater. Shag
' Rock No. 2 was developed by a recent
! survey. It has an area twice as large
I as No. 1 and only seventeen feet of
j water above it at mean low tide. If
I No. 1 Is removed it would be essential
; to remove No. 2, which would otherwise
! remain a dangerous hidden obstruc
1 tion.
The combined cost of removing these
obstructions would be $638,620.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JENNINGS, La., Dec. I.â The Sunset
Limited transcontinental train of the
Southern Pacific Company, westbound,
was badly wrecked at 4:30 o'clock this
evening two miles west of Jennings, on
what is known as the Grand Marias.
The train left New Orleans at 11:20
o'clock to-day. It was running sixty
miles an hour at the time of the acci
dent.
It is impossible to tell the exact
cause of the wreck, but it is surmised
that an axle on the locomotive gave
way. The pony trucks left the rails and
ran 300 feet on the ties. The engineer
reversed his engine, but could not stop
the train, which was under full speed.
The engine finally left the track en
tirely and plunged down an embank
ment, the forward end dropping and
the engine turning completely over,
where it lies on its left side over half
submerged in water and mud.
It was miraculous that there was no
loss of life.
Engineer W. E. Ragsdale of Houston
was caught in the cab and his left foot
badly mashed.
Fireman F. H. Booth of Hous
ton had his back and shoulder se
verely sprained.
Conductor Richard Qualtrough of
Houston had his spine seriously in
jured.
Chief Air Inspector Cox of Boston
was caught in the engine, <m which he
was riding, and fatally injured.
The first three cars left the track,
jumping from the trucks, and lie down
the embankbent.
The limited carried forty-three pas
sengers, none of whom were injured.
Among the passengers are the wit
nesses in the Botkin case.
MONEY PAID, BUT
TITLE NOT SECURED
An Interesting Lawsuit Which Will
Reveal Some Peculiar Land
Transactions. .
SALINAS, Dec. â  I.â A lawsuit was
transferred yesterday afternoon from
San . Francisco to the Superior r Court of
Monterey County, which promises some
interesting developments ; and \ the prob
able exposure of how numbers of men
and women of the metropolis â¢ were in
duced' by smooth-tongued- ; '. real \| estate
dealers to invest their all in lands lin this
county, payment to be made in install
ments, and then lost.all because no title
could be acquired. .'\ '.:,..'' ' ' .
The case just transferred is brought by
C. Q. Meyer against Francis Doud, the
latter being the wealthy Monterey Coun
ty capitalist. The plaintiff is a San 1? ran
cisco hack driver, who has been saving
! his earnings for iifteen years past. The
; complaint alleges that a man named
Charles Orpin entered into an agreement
with Meyer, whereby the latter was to be
come the " purchaser of property in the
Doud tract, near Monterey City, to * the
value of $1700. From December 1, 1894,
Meyer regularly paid weekly and month
ly installments ranging from $8 to $32.
Under his agreement with Orpin, Meyer
â¢was to pay up in full on November 1,
1897, and having paid him previous to that
day $1603, tendered the balance due of the
$1700 and asked for his deed. This Orpin
said he could not give. Meyer. then ten
dered the money to Francis Doud, but he,
claiming ,to be ignorant of the transac
tion, refused to accept it. Meyer then
brought suit. It appears further from
investigation that the suit is also an out
come of the failure some two. years ago
of the real estate firm of Carnall, Hop
kins & Co. of San Francisco, and is only
the precurser of many others. . From the
records it is shown that some time dur
ing 1593 that real estate firm offered Mr.
Doud the sum of $80,000 for his property.
They did not buy outright, but simply
bonded the land, , which they at once laid
out in town lots 5 and sold ;to ' clerks and
numerous others of small ' means :in . San
Francisco. When Carnall, Hopkins & Co.
â¢failed they _> also . became unable to meet
their obligations : to Mr. Doud. - Conse- â¢
quently, it is claimed the agreement â  for
the. sale of the Doud tract was forfeited.
; Further, Mr. Doud having received no
money consideration for the land from
any one, r positively refuses to give deeds
to any lots purchased * from either the
real estate firm of Carnall,' Hopkins & Co.
or. their agents. "- Some queer transactions
of certain parties are said to be ripe for
exposure when the case is brought to
trial, ' which : will be during' the present
month. . 'â '::,. : â

OBSIDIAN FINISHED SECOND
HUGH PENNY NARROWLY ES
CAPED A BEATING.
Llmewater "Won at leisure From.
Anchored â x-ord Marmion. Downed
by Yankee Doodle â Four Fa
vorites Finished Ahead.
The betting ring creaked and groaned
and swayec after Moringa won the high
weight handicap at Oakland yesterday.
The wise ones strode about with bung
starters hammering his odds down from
3& to 1 to 2 to 1. Many of the block men
turned their backs to the coin handed up
to them.
Obsidian opened favorite at 3 to 2,
but nobody outside of the stable seemed
to fancy the brown colt's chances. Mor
inga carried Piggott and 116 pounds in the
saddle, and he was the popular candi
date. Piggott got him away well, and at
the head of the stretch he was in front.
When the wire was passed he was still
in front, with Obsidian two lengths away.
The track was not fast, still the winner
stepped off the six furlongs in 1:15 V&.
Rosormonde and the balance of the com
pany finished irregularly. The lines back
of most of the books resembled the dem
onstration in front of "the postofflce at
Dawson City on mail day. Twenty book
makers cut in yesterday, and if they
could have heard about this race the
chances are twelve of them would have
refused to cut. It was a solar plexus
punch, and thirteen of them are still won
dering why they laid the price.
The first choices proved of the substan
tial sort, four out of six getting home
with the coin. They were all well sup
ported as well as the two that did not
command first call in the betting.
It looked as if Lothian, the Burns &
"Waterhouse entry in the opening scramble
for two-year-olds, could choke off his
field, but at the finish he was not num
bered among the first three. Almoner,
ridden by Turner, led all the way, win
ning easily from Crossmolina, an outsider.
Polka, unevenly ridden, was third.
This was followed by the downfall of
the favorite Libertine in the six furlong
run. The big sprinter seemed to have
the class all over his company, yet when
it came to the show down the last eighth
of a mile. Soscol, a 6 to 1 chance, showed
the bay horse how it was done, passing
the wire two lengths to the good. Quite
a fast bunch of speed finished behind the
leading horses, many of them well backed.
Some of them were short, and others
possibly their riders Uidn't fancy.
In the spin for vwo-year-olds over the
futurity course, Limewater closed favorite
,over Mldlove, and won blinking from
Anchored.
The bookmakers generously laid a post
age stamp against a dollar bill on Hugh
Penny. It was no Cakewalk, however,
that the old sprinter encountered. The
distance was seven furlongs, and Lost
Girl had him tip-toeing from start to fin
ish. At the wire he downed the mare a
length, ridden out. Pongo finished a dis
tant third.
Yankee Doodle came to town in the con
cluding piece of the afternoon, a six fur
long affair. Purser's gelding closed an
8 to 5 favorite, and catching Lord Mar

THE SITE REUSED.
No Bids for the Property Will Be
Considered by the Man Who
Still Believes His Luck
Will Win Out.
E J. Baldwin haa at last begun the
work of tearing down the tottering walls
of the burned hostelry that have been
for more than a week a constant and
dangerous menace to the lives of pedes
trians whose business took them In that
vicinity. But It was not regard for the
lives of citizens or a desire to obey the
mandate of the Fire Commissioners that
induced him to begin the work. It was
rather the fear that continued Indiffer
ence of public sentiment and the require
ments of the law might get him into seri
ous difficulties with the authorities.
It was rumored on the street yesterday
morning that Baldwin was about to be
arrested for refusing to obey the orders
of the Fire "gardens in regard to the im
mediate removal of the ruins. This was
later denied, but the fact that a score of
riggers suddenly put In an appearance
shortly before noon and started to work
gave color to the story that Baldwin had
been coerced Into making a bluff at com
plying with the law.
Baldwin says he has not opened the
bids submitted by professional contract
ors yet and will not do so until he gets
good and ready.
"I am a pretty good wrecker myself,"
said he, "and I will see what I can do. X
have twenty men at work, but if I find
I can get the work done cheaper by con
tract I may let It out."
The wreckers succeeded in pulling
down the fragments of the cupola and a
small section of the wall on the Market
street Bide, but owing to the nature of
the work and the small force employed
progress was necessarily slow. On the
Powell street side the work of removing
the remnants of carpets, broken furni
ture and fixtures that have no value in
the eyes of anybody but Bald win and the
junk dealers was ' continued uninter
ruptedly.
Mr. Baldwin still clings to the idea that
he will be able to erect a grand struct
ure to replace the burned hotel and the
ater, and he has thus far persistently re
fused to even consider any proposition for
the purchase of the site. Madison &
Burke, his agents, have received several |
bids for the property, Including one for
$2,000,000 cash, which they advtjse him to
accept. He refused to even consider -the I
bid, nowever, saying he had no Intention
of parting with the land. While he be
lieves he can raise the necessa
ry money to carry out his
plans those familiar with his af
fairs are not bo sanguine. They say it
will cost $3,000,000 to put up a suitable
building and furnish it.and that Baldwin
cannot possibly raise that amount.
Mr. Burke of Madison & Burke declined
to say who made the offer of $2,00Q,000,
J&ut evaded the question by Baying that-
George Crocker had asked him to deny
that the Southern Pacific was among the
bidders.

Energetic preparations have been made
for the bazaar, dinner and entertainment

Congregational Church, at Richmond

MARIN COUNTY
REACHING FOR
THE DRYDOCK
Said to Have the Best
* Site in the State. J
ALAMEDA AND SOLANO OBJECT
A HOT THREE-CORNERED FIGHT
OVER THE PLUM.
The Old Blairmore, Renamed ' Johr '
Palmer, Is Now Called Abbie *';;
Palmer Because of Her . !
1-V^iV Figurehead.
There Is going: to be a three-cornered
fight over the sito for the new drydock
which Uncle Sam has appropriated a mil
lion to build somewhere in the vicinity
of San Francisco. At first it was sup
posed that Solano County would get the
plum and that the docking and repairing
of the huge fighting machines of the
United States navy, stationed on the Pa
.ciflc, would be continued in the vjelnity
of Mare Island. Naval men and Govern
ment engineers gave it as their opinion;
however, that better sites than the Mare
Island one could be found.
Then Alameda County got into the fight
and Is now urging that the only place
for a drydock is on the Oakland water
front. Its citizens point out that a splen
did site can be secured on the other side
of the bay and that in order to make a
dock at Mare Island large enough to ac
commodate the Oregon and lowa at !<ast
$300,000 would have to be spent in dredg
ing the present channel to a -sufficient
depth to make it navigable for battle
ships.
And now another county has been
heard from. The people of Marin say chat
the only logical place for a huge dryloek
!s on the Marin shore to the north of
Anj?el Island. They point out that round
about California City the shore is shel
tered from every wind that blows and
that at all stages of the tide there is
deep water. There is fresh water in
abundance on the hills that could be
piped to the and every facil
ity for raptd transit to the city by v/ay
of Tiburon. There is a splendid founda
tion and no dredging will be nepessary,
they say, and there is water enough to
dock the largest vessel that will ever be
built.
A boulevard sixty feet wide from Tibu
ron along the shore line to San Rafael
has been ' surveyed and it is thought a
couple of years will see it built. When
completed electric cars will be placed on
it and these cars will connect with Cali
fornia City. It is off this part of the
Marin shore that all the warships adjust
their compasses and where the Farragut
and other vessels built by the Scotts for
the United States have had some of iheir
trials. Marin is out for that drydo-:k
and Alameda and Solano had better be up
and doing or else they will lose the olum.
The Blairmore has .had her name
I changed again and thereby hangs a lale.
When Robert Suddan purchased the hull
and began to reflt it he .cast about for
a name. Away back in the rso'sr so's his bosom
friend was: John Palmer. They verc in
separable and then-love for- each other
was like that of David and Jonathan.
'What better name could Sudden tfvo ihe
ex-British ship than John Palmer. Ac
cordingly, when the vessel was rigged
the name Blairmore was stricken off her
br.ws and the name John Palmer put in
its place. Everybody, of cours-?, thought
it very appropriate and daily among the
"li*t of vessels in port" appealed "the
American bark John Palmer.'
A few days ago, however, a British
shipmaster was looking over the vessel,
and after a good gaze remarked, "I'll be
hanged if I ever saw a ship with a fe
male figurehead named John before."
Sure enough, the old Blairmore was dec
orated with a beautifully draped woman
.for a figurehead and nobody had noticed
it when renaming the vessel. It was now
a question of renaming the vessel again
or putting in a new figurehead. The for
mer alternative was chosen and the bark
is now known as the Abbie Palmer. Mrs.
Palmer is the wife of John Palmer and
so the difficulty was bridged in that way.
Owing to the fog the Mail steamer Sun
Bias did not get to her dock until noon
yesterday; She arrived from Central
American ports during the night and her
passengers were landed on the tug Mll
len Griffiths early in the morning.
RACING WITH A FALLING STAR.
On August 29 last the crew of the American ship Shenandryih was treated to
a strange sight. It was ab.out sundown and darkness was beginning to creep
over the waters. The ship was under full sail, and with a good breeze to help
her along was Jogging ten knots an hour. "Suddenly a -blazing mass about the
size of the end of a barrel shot put of the gloom." says Captain Starkey, when
talking about the Incident. "As it came rushing along with a tail of fire twenty
feet long it looked as if it vould strike us on the starboard bow. The head of
the thing was as green as an emerald and glowed with an unearthly fire. In
stead of striking the Shenandoah it went to pieces about one hundred yards away
from us. I have seen some falling stars In my titne, but I never before saw one
of that color or one -that came so near to sending me to Davy Jones' locker."

ROBBED BY THE METER.
THAT the San Francisco Gas and. Electric Light
Company is an overbearing, swinish and arro
gant corporation, without regard for the rights
of patrons, has been shown again and again. That
it charges outrageously for a bad illuminant, and
charges just the same whether the illuminant is used
or the household remain darkened during the ab
sence of the family, is well understood. That its rates
are exorbitant, its conduct arbitrary, its response to
well-founded requests impertinent, goes without say
ing. It numbers its victims by the thousands, and
it holds a fortune exacted from them with no warrant
of law and no shadow of equity.
But this company has surpassed its own record for
despicable tricks. It has achieved the seemingly im
possible. From the acute meanness of its greed
there has emanated an action such as would be be
neath the dignity of a footpad, and give the miser
pause. It has applied its hold-up tactics to & char
itable organization, which is not only organized for
a noble purpose, but amply able to pay its bills. In
its accustomed fashion of suspecting every customer
of being a thief, it has insulted a number of ladies,
and upon their request that a meter be put in certain
premises responded that a $5 deposit would be neces-.
sary. In vain was the case presented. An itching
palm was outstretched for the coin, and the money
has gone to join the fund wrested from other dupes.
The story is brief. Among the works of the Native
Daughters is that of maintaining a home for members
of the order. It is the design there to care for Native
Daughters who may arrive from interior points, to
provide the sick with shelter, medicine and gentle
ministration. For this purpose a good woman had
left a^sum of .money, and the order has been applying
it. A place was rented at 925 O'Farrell street. The
furnishing of it is now in progress. A stage had
been reached at which light became a necessity, and
this company was asked to put a meter in. Refusal
to do so was absolute. The ladies explained the situ
ation, that they would be individually responsible,
that ample money would in any event be forthcoming.
Their words were wasted. They had, or thought they
had, to deposit $5, and they did so. That is to say, a
shrewd and conscienceless corporation robbed them
of this trifle just as it had robbed before and will
again unless the Legislature lay a hand heavily
apon it. .;
The highwayman, pistol in hand, is no more an
offender than this corporation. It uses its power, its
monopoly of the meter, for the purpose of larceny.
It reaches into the pocket, abstracts a coin, and has
no excuse save the bad one that the opportunity is
afforded.
The Legislature should check this peculiarly exas
perating form of crime. Citizens are entitled alike to
protection from insult and from theft. Such a de
mand as these ladies were forced to accede to ought
:o be rated as a felony, for morally it is nothing less.
The ti-me is here for the gas people to understand that
:hey have no privilege of peculation. By the right to
Â»hut off the gas supply they are amply guarded. They
:annot ask more. Other dealers in public utilities
tsk no more. Let the demand of the gas company
r or a deposit be legally rated as a felony. Nothing
Â»hort of this will give its swollen and defiant officials
I proper conception of their place in the general
iconorny.

ar away they are not forgotten of the people who
fatched' them go and bade them farewell with tears
.nd cheers. AH contributions will be forwarded to

ributed in the most effective way, and not a scrap

Aguinaldo demands ransom for certain' of the

THE MONROE DOCTRINE DEAD.
THE purchase of the Philippines, if that folly be
ratified by the Senate, will be the final, formal
and official abandonment of the Monroe doc
trine by the United States. It is the consummation
of an act of aggression against a European state,
concluded outside of our own hemisphere. Haying
broken out of our own hemisphere, we can no longer
oppose the breaking into it by any power that
has the strength. The tone of the Continental press
is unmistakable. Those nations have the experience
that equips them for judgment, and when their press
declares that our past republican policy is obsolete
and that we have entered into the conflicts of the
world as an imperial military power/they speak the
truth. :
Mr. Henry Adams in his history of the United
States says:
"Jefferson aspired beyond the ambition of a na
tionality and embraced in his view the whole future
of man. That the United States should become a na
tion like France, England or Russia; should conquer
the world like Rome or develop a typical race like
China, was no part of his scheme. He wished to be
gin a new era. Hoping for a time when the world's
ruling interests should cease to be local and should
become universal; when questions of boundary and
of nationality should become insignificant: when
armies and navies should be reduced to the work of
police and politics should consist only in non-inter
vention, he set himself to the task of governing with
this Golden Age in view. Few men have dared to
legislate as though eternal peace were at hand, in a
world torn by wars and convulsions and drowned in
blood, but this is what Jefferson aspired to do. Even
in such dangers he believed that Ame-icans might
safely set an example which the Christian world
should be led by interest to respect, and at length to
imitate. As he conceived a true American policy,
war was a blunder, an unnecessary risk; and even
in case of robbery and aggression the United States,
he believed, had only to stand on the defensive in or
der to obtain justice in the end. He would not con
sent to build up a new nationality merely to create
more navies and armies, to perpetuate the crimes and
follies of Europe; the central government at Wash
ington should not, in his view, be permitted to in
dulge in the miserable ambitions that had made the
Old World a hell and frustrated the hopes of hu
manity."
It must be admitted that the spirit of this Jeffer
sonian view largely controlled our national policy.
It was violated by the Ostend manifesto, which was
plain affirmation of the brutal doctrine that might
makes right. But that manifesto was not influential
in controlling our policy. Now, however, a change
has come. American sentiment makes no conceal
ment of our purpose to take Cuba, against the pro-
I tests of its people and without giving them
adequate opportunity to prove a self-governing ca
pacity. The lines are written in the treaty of Paris
by which we take the Philippines, also against the
wish and in the face of the protest of nine-tenths of
their people. We have taken Hawaii, while 95 per
cent of the people mourned in their darkened homes.
A reference to the speeches in the Senate and ar
ticles in the American press illuminates the enormity
of this policy' The country was told in the Senate
I that Cuba had already a government, with a fiscal
1 establishment deriving revenue by taxation; that it
had an executive, legislative and judicial government,
co-ordinate and in the exercise of all its functions;
that it had an organized public school system in
operation, using textbooks printed by the govern
j ment, and, in fine, that the Cuban government was
I equipped with and operating all the machinery of
j civilized authority for the protection of personal and
property rights. This statement of its condition was
,1 one of the moving factors in bringing on our declara
j tion of war against Spain, in which we solemnly ab
jured territorial aggrandizement and repudiated all
irtention of conquest.
Therefore, up to the adoption of the war declaration
by Congress, we still stood in the traditional posi
tion of the republic. ;
With victory, all this was changed. Our solemnly
; declared purpose was abandoned and we were seized
I with the lust of conquest and a craze for the arbitrary
use of power.
What has become of the organized government of
Cuba, which we were told was in operation one year
ago? Has it gone glimmering to the limbo of lies
along with our high-minded pledge against conquest
and aggrandizement?
With ordinary revenues still short of ordinary ex
penditures, we propose a standing army of 100.000
men and the immediate building of fifty battleships.
Suddenly the only objects of national interest ap
pear to be a great army and a massive navy to gar
rison and guard distant possessions, the ownership
of which was not desired a year ago, and is not de
sirable now. Instead of setting an example which
will lift from the people of the world the burden and
sore oppression of militarism, we are forcing the in
crease of that incubns throughout the globe. We are
throwing moral power to the winds and going back
to i the principles that governed the early empires,
that there is only one element in the successful gov
ernment of man, and that is material, physical force.
To what quarter can the people turn for light and
leading in this time of national lust and passion?
The American Commissioners have exceeded the
1 wish and transcended the expectations of the people.
They have affirmed a policy that will drain us of a
billion dollars within five years. :.. ..
It may be admitted that in the flush of military suc
cess the people have seemed to approve some such
i course, but no thoughtful man believes: that it will
1 have the indorsement of their sober second thought.
ANOTHER OBJECT LESSON.
UNLESS captured by the time this appears in
print, Peter McGlade is a fugitive, hidihg from
those whose trust he has betrayed. ; It seems
that he had stolen, and that flight was the only
meihod by which he could hope to escape facing
open, disgrace and taking the consequences^
lueGlade was in receipt of an ample salary ha.d he
confined his expenditures to -proper channels. They
weTe not so-cqiifiried, however, for, like the rest of the
:lonig list of errfbezziers, defaulters and official thieves,
McGlade played the races. The dazzling, if remote,
possibility of winning a large sum was : to 1 him a
temptation too great. He risked money and reputa
tion, position and friendship, and he lost all. It is
the ordinary course. : .
The list is growing to a fearful length. Hundreds
of young men in this city are treading on dangerous
ground. Sooner or later many of them, will, like Mc-
Glade, reach the point at which their habit of playing
the races can be ho longer concealed. The City Hall
is full of clerks who are habitual players. They
handle money which does not belong to them. Their
salaries are not sufficient to support both themselves
and the bookmakers. ; â 
Aside from the hundreds who by their passion for
racing have sunk into debt and discredit, it may be
worth while to recount a few of the typical cases
(.which became notorious through a dimax of tragedy
THE SAX FBAyciSCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1898.
or of shame. Figel was ruined by the races. He ap
peared in court under the imputation of dishonesty
j and of murder. Welburn was ruined by the faces.
He is an exile. Isaac Norton was ruined by the races.
He is in a suicide's grave. Harry Piper was ruined
by the races; so was Widber, so was McGlade, and
so have been a countless number more.
Because of these facts racing should be subject to
a time limit. As a diversion it does no harm. As a
business at which men and boys and women wager,
for a vain hope, all they have, it is pernicious and
blighting. A duty of the Legislature will be to place
restrictions upon it. ;
REAPING THE WHIRLWIND.
THERE is an adage about sowing the wind and
reaping the whirlwind. President Valentine of
the Wells-Fargo Express will appreciate it, be
cause he not only has a leaning toward quotation,
!*ut the whirlwind harvest is his to reap.
The inexcusable dishonesty of the express com
panies in refusing to pay their share of the war tax
has been vigorously denounced by everybody not in
th? brsiness of carrying goods. That there was any
merit in the contention of the companies was not be
lieved even by themselves. They merely thought to
beat back the inevitable verdict until such time as the
tax had become ;i thing of the past. The courts have
been slow, but justice is moving.
There will be introduced in Congress more than
one bill for the establishment of a parcels post. The
plan is feasible. It has been tried elsewhere with
success. So strong is the demand for it that in all
probability it will be indorsed and put into opera
tion. Then the petty exactions of the express com
panies will be of no- consequence. A parcels post
would be popular, and there is no doubt would in
time be of profit to the department. In any event
it would relieve the people from domination by a
series of monopolies and teach the corporations a les
son in manners and in business ethics. They have
uniformly charged all the traffic would bear. When
they added the price of the stamp, for which they
should have paid themselves, they added a trifle more
than the traffic would bear, and to be deprived of the
traffic would serve them rightry.
Tl-jE PRIMARY LAW QUESTION.
THE joint non-political committee appointed by
the different organizations of this city with in
structions to frame a general primary election
law for submission to the coming Legislature ap
pears to be as far away from an agreement as the i
party leaders were who appointed it. According to
published accounts of its deliberations, the commit
tee will present majority s and minority recommenda
tions, and in this way tangle up matters effectually.
.Senator Stratton, the primary law prophet ; who
framed the measure declared unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court, declares that he is going to try his
hand again, regardless of the work of the committee.
Thus we shall have, not one measure indorsed by all
the political parties and embodying one general plan,
but several embodying the ideas of a number of poli
ticians who think they understand exactly how poli
tics can be reformed so as to make it certain that they
will get the offices. ; : .i . â 'â 
This subject is one that merits more attention than
it is getting. The committee ought to hold meetings
; and discuss it. The public may very properly be
: taken into its confidence, since a general primary elec
tion \ law affects all parties, all governments * and the
aspirations of the : statesmen of all parties. -If there is
a disagreement among the members of the committee
the details should be given to the press in order that
the bugs that are gnawing at the : vitals of the several
committeemen may be put under the microscope and
subjected to the electric light of public intelligence.
What the people want to know particularly is' how
the primary law manufacturers are going to get over
the decision of the Supreme Court in the Stratton
act case. . : It : will be remembered .'â  that ; that tribunal
discovered .the. test for voting in this State to have
been incorporated in the constitution, which docu- ,
ment was overlooked by ' Senator . Stratton when he
wrote his act. ''. Under the constitution any man may
vote at all elections who is 21 : years of age, a citizen
of the United States, a resident of his precinct thirty
days, ; his county ] three months, and the State :. one
year. The court said the Legislature could neither
add to nor take, from these qualifications, and that,
consequently:* it could not prevent. Democrats voting
at Republican primaries, or vice versa, by prescribing
different qualifications. ;. â¢'";-'â  . â '."â  ; j â¢â¢; .".'.-
How is this, difficulty to be remedied without : a
constitutional amendment? That is what the public
wants to know. Our own opinion is that a general
primary law : such as this committee has in its head
is a humbug. Even if it could be made to work it
would' tend to destroy independent voting by.
strengthening the convention powers of the political
bosses. What ought to. be done in this State is to
let the election laws alone for awhile. It is bur cus
tom as soon as we adopt; a "reform" statute to im
mediately begin an agitation to repeal it. ; : This is
: exactly what happened to the â¢ Story counting system;
; That system completely. baffled the ballot-box
i stuffers, and they let it alone for just . one election.
The "reform" Australian; system displaced it, notwith
standing - : it was perfection itself in producing : an
honest couilt of the votes. .' .â¢ . .' /.'
In New York a general primary law has proved: a
: qualified success. - There Platt and Croker are using
it to strengthen- their respective machines. Why does
1 not the' committee study results in the Empire State
and give .its reasoning powers sway ? ;. Aâ¢' general pri
mary law. is : .not necessarily a good thing because it
is advocated by the late band of knocked. out "re

BLAMED FOR THE
LATE COLLISION
License Is Suspended
for Two Years.
BROKE A PILOT REGULATION
CENSURED BY THE UNITED
STATES LOCAL INSPECTOBS.
He Went to Starboard Instead of
to Port When He Saw
the Czarina's Head
light.
Captains O. F. Bolles and John- K. Bul
ger, United States Local Inspectors of
Steam Vessels, completed their report yes
terday in the matter of the collision be
tween the steamers J. D. Peters and
Czarina, which took place on November
2 of this year. In the Investigation twen
â¢ ty-three witnesses were called and six
â¢were recalled. The transcript of the testi
mony covers 278 pages of typewritten
foolscap size paper. All this has been
'"boiled down" carefully by the inspectors.
.After finishing with the testimony, the in
â â â â Vpectors go on to say:
It will be Been that the testimony given re
garding the steam whistles sounded by these
steamers is very conflicting. We are unable
from it to determine which steamer first 'slg
â â â  naled the other and what exchange of signals
were actually made. It Is our opinion that
the headlight of the Czarina was in its proper
place and burning before and at the time of
â¢ the collision. The testimony of the witnesses
: - of said eteamer is to that effect. It was seen
â â by. Mr. Bell, witness of Angel Island, just after
â â 'â¢â¢â¢â¢thÂ£ collision. Moreover, Captain - Holdsworth
â i-cf the'J. P. Peters testifies that he saw the
-/â¢/.headlight of the Czarina at the time her second
!; : Vrwhistle was blown. We do not believe it pos
sible for the headlight to have been hoisted up
.Vat that time without some person observing
' tiie act >;:>, â â â  â â  ...
â¢ The bulk of testimony goes to show that these
â : steamers were . approaching each other, head j
â¢a: ! head, or nearly bo. It was. therefore, the
duty of the pilot of each to pass on the port
.side of the other as prescribed by . rule 1 of
â 'â  the "Pilot Rules for Atlantic and Pacific Coast
â¢ Inland Waters." Captain Seaman, , pilot of |
; the Czarina, acted accordingly by putting his
helm hard to port when he first signaled the
â ;J. D. Peters. When he received, as he tÂ«sti
fies, a reply of two blasts from the J. D. Pe
â ' ters he at once stopped and backed his steamer
to avaoid collision and the Czarina was back
ing and her helm still hard to port when the
â¢ J. .P. Peters struck her on thÂ» port bow, as
.â already related. There it. notnlng in the tes
'â¢'â¢'. tlmony to cause us to doubt that Captain Sea-
Cfflan put his helm to port and stopped and
'â '.- backed, as above stated. "c, however, testl
' â  res that he signaled the J. D. Peters with one |
blast of his whistle upon receiving from the
. latter a signal of two blasts. His duty in that
juncture under rule 3 was to have sounded i
not less than four short and rapid blasts. in
stead of giving, as he did, a signal of one i
blast. This action, on his part, was In viola- j
tion of that rule. But, in our opinion, his i
Bounding of such short and rapid blasts would â 
not. under the then existing circumstances, j
: have availed to prevent the collision which soon I
followed. :.'".;â¢-.â -â .â :
. On the other hand. Captain McNelll, pilot of
the J. D. Peters, proceeded 'to pass on the
â  starboard side of the Czarina, contrary to rota
1 cited. When first he saw the sidelights of the
Czarina â he thought they were those of i
.' schooner, and starboarded his helm a few.sec- ;
â¢â â . onds: he then, discovered, that they were the j
red and : green lights of a steamer. He kept I
V his helm to starboard and signaled to the Czar- '
.. ina,as stated- in the synopsis of his" testimony,
:; and â¢ stopped and backed his engines, and at
â  ".about: the time the vessels came together..
..-: It is in evidence that the J. I). Peters swung
:â  about three point to .port before the collis
ion.,.'. Had. the helm of the J. P. â¢ Peters been j
put hard to port at the time Captain McNeill
... realized. that the side lights he saw were those
> of a. steamer, two or two and a naif minutes
'.'.before the collision, this disaster In our opin-
Vinn would Dot have occurred, for the reason 1
;'"... that in such case the J. t>. Peters would have :
/â '.swung' fully .45-. degrees to. starboard. â 
â -'."Captain McNeill also violated rule 3 by- giv- |
. ins a signal cf two whistles upon receiving a
â v signal of one blast from the â¢ Czarina, as did
.- Captain Seaman of the/Czarina;.' ' .. ...â¢.â .â¢â .;
...In our opinion, taking, the testimony as a
â whole,: the cause of this, collision was In' the
action of Captain Charles JVlc>'ellJ-, pilot. Of thÂ»
â Eteamer .7 P. Peters,: In attempting to pass
on the starboard side of the Czarina, contrarj'

JUSTICE VAN
FLEET WILL
NOT ACCEPT
Supreme Court Posi
tion at His Disposal.
WELL MERITED COMPLIMENT
ASSOCIATES WOITLD REFUTE
AN ELECTION LIBEL.
A High Sense of Honor Induces a
Declination of Any Office
of an Appointive
Nature.
A rumor was freely circulated yester
day to the effect that Justice of the
Supreme Court William C. Van Fleet
would probably be appointed Supreme
Court Commissioner to fill the: vacancy
caused by the death of Conimissiontr
Isaac S. Belcher.
Members of the Supreme Court who
were, approached on the subject inti
mated that if Judge Van Fleet would
consent to accept the appointment It
would be given him by a unanimous
vote. The menibers of the Supreme
bench believe that such an act would!
be a flitting testimonial of their appre- I
elation of their fellow-Justice and a j
well-timed refutation of the baseless j
slander that was circulated regarding j
him during the campaign for political j
purposes. The circulation of the slan- j
der was for no other object than to se
cure the defeat of his candidacy for
re-election to the position which he has j
held with credit to himself during his j
term as Associate Justice. Such a tes
timonial as his appointment to the va
cant Commissionership would be, in the j
opinion of his associates, fl proper ex- |
pression of their regard for him as a I
man and his integrity as a Judge.
However kindly may be the inten- \
tions of the Supreme Court Justices j
they will be doomed to disappointment, j
as Judge Van Fleet will, under no con- |
sideration, accept the appointment j
should it be tendered him. He declares !
that he will not now or at any future j
j time accept a position in any way con
nected with the Supreme Court that
is not sriven him by a vote of the peo
ple. He feels that such a course is due
to himself as well as to the people of
the State, in view of the result of the
late election.
Such a delicacy of feeling is hot
often met with in a public officer, and
coming as it does at this particular '
time, forms in itself a sufficient refuta- \
tion, if any were needed, of the base i
libel of which he was made the innocent j
victim. It is scarcely possible that the !
ungenerous persons who aided in cir
culating the election story believed it.
The office of Commissioner of the
Supreme Court is practically of life â¢
tenure, and as the salary attached to it i
is the same as that of an Associate
Supreme Justice, it ls\ a position in all
respects honorable and desirable.
HOSMER NOT WORRIED.
Hi& Dismissal From the district At
torney's Office Only Hastened
Prearranged Plans.
Assistant District Attorney Hosnver,
whose: sudden removal from office by Dis
trict Attorney Barnes astounded the lo
cal legal fraternity, is in no wise discon
certed by the. peremptory act of his su
perior, as he has been contemplating re
tirement from official life for some, weeks
past.. It was rumored around : the City
Hall yesterday that Mr. Hosmer had
completed negotiations by which he would |
become one. -or the la;w firm of Redfly, i
Campbell & Metson, but when asked .as
to the authenticity of the report he de
clined to be Interviewed. The others in
the : bargain, however, .acknowledged tftat '
within the next few days. Mr. HosmoVs
shingle would appear with tlvqirs over the
office door, and they are inclined to con
gratulate themselves upon their acquisi
tion. .. .

Bold Thieves in Jail. :. ;
Detectives Ryan arid O'D*Â»a last night

CITY LOSES ON
M'GLADE'S DEFALCATION
TEN THEFTS DISCOVERED IN
THE AUGUST ACCOUNTS.
Authorities Take No Stock in Re
ports That the Absconding
Deputy Is Headed
Southward.
Peter McGlade is being sought by the
police. A comparison of the Auditor's
books with those of the Street Depart
ment, made yesterday, developed the fact
that the defaulting bookkeeper did not
confine his frauds to the warrant brokers
but by means of fraudulent warrants also
robbed the city of nearly a thousand dol
lars. To accomplish his thefts he was
obliged to forge the names of Superin
tendent Ambrose and Chief Deputy
Thomas F. Clark., and this he did with as
little compunction as he signed the bogus
labor rabs that he cashed with Bier &
Regenaburger.
The investigation of the books, so far as
ft has progressed, has unearthed ten sep
arate thefts, all of them committed in the
month of August. To accomplish them,
McGlade secured a blank warrant book
nod wrote orders on the treasury in favor
of any name that struck his fancy, ihese
he indorsed with the forged name of the
deputy clerk and Superintendent Ambrose
and swore to before Clerk Russell of tne
Hoard of Supervisors. The orders were
then audited by the Street Committee of
tho board and finally paid by the Treas
urer.
ThÂ« fictitious names on McGlade-issued
warrants and the amounts he realized upon
them are as follows: H. Swords, $96; H.
Murray. $60; J. Tierney, $120; C. Murphy.
$96; P. Coyne, $9C; T. Lynch, $72; Thomas
Dwyer, $36; Pat Welch, $72; L. McCarthy,
$60; J. Sulljvan, $96.
Owing to the fact that yesterday was
warrant day at the City Hall, the Inves
tigation of the books stopped at noon, but
it will be resumed to-day, and Superin
tendent Ambrose is afraid that $800 will
not cover all of the municipal shekels
that his erring bookkeeper has got away
The authorities are inclined to disbelieve
the repoTt that McGlade is headed for the
southern country, and a thorough search
is being made fox him among his known
haunts In this city.* No warrant for his
arrest has yet issued, but Mayor Phelan
has notified Chief Lees to place him un
der arrest wherever found.
Then He Got Mad.
Harry Glassman, a young man, wan ar
rested yesterday on a charge of battery.
The complaining witness is Dr. Emerson,
a dentist on. Sixth street, near Market.
The doctor alleges that on Wednesday
while he was at the door of his office
Glassman, without any provocation came
up and struck him a violent blow on the
<ye daysman's story is that the doctor
thrashed his wife, and when Mrs. Glass
man, her sister, interfered he beat her
â¢also.' AVhen his mother told him he got
mad, and meeting the doctor struck him.

and the roll was opened for signatures.
To-night the examinations will take place

Addressed the Bear Club.
The Bear Club held a large meeting
last evening at which Congressman-elect
Julius Kahn and Treasurer-elect I. J.
Truman attended and were greeted
warmly. Both gracefully thanked their
fellow Bears for the services they had
rendered and pledged themselves to con
tinue to work for the interests of the
club. George Meihling was elected cap
tain of the drill corps. It was decided
to meet hereafter on the first and third
Thursdays in each month. W. H. Phelps,
Supervisor-elect, was admitted as a
member. A. w. Voorsanger first vice
president, J. D. Brown, E. J. Casey,
President T. W. Collins. I. P. Kincaid.

National Peace Festival.
At the last meeting of the directors of
the Merchants' Association the presi
dent of that body was requested to send
a telegram to President McKlnley as
soon aB the articles of peace have been
ratified, congratulating the Government
upon the successful termination of the
war with Spain, and recommending that
a National Peace Festival bo held to
commemorate the event. <
uon gowns aiviaea me committee, ana
twoâ the Misses Callahan and "Mrs.
Byrne^ â were awarded blue ribbons.
From the Callahan workshop came a
dollâ "a dream"â in green and white
and silver trimmings. The Jupe was
of white satin embroidered in chenille
and silver spangles, and the overdress
of green satin, with appliqued jewel
embroidery. The Byrne reception
gown was fashioned of white mousse-
Tine de soie, and the skirt was
trimmed with tiny flounces edged with
pink velvet baby ribbon. The New
York doll, dressed by White & Lord,
and presented by William Hearst, at
tracted considerable attention.
All the Doctors' Daughters were on
hand and assisted the ever-smiling
bisque and kid ladies in making their
guests welcome. At the door Mrs. W.
V. Bryan stood guard, covering her
self with immortal glory by her light
ning calculation and dexterity in hand
ling change. Last year the Doctors'
Daughters cleared $3600 by their model
doll show. Judging by the immense at
tendance of tho opening day this
year's exhibit will probably excel vie
gratifying results of last year.
Several of the model dolls were sold
at the private sale during the day.
Among the purchasers were Mrs.
Frank J. Sullivan, Mrs. Will Crocker
and Mrs. Frank Carolan.
The attendance in the evening was
even larger than tnat of the afternoon.
The auction, which was to have taken
place, was postponed until this and to
morrow evening, thus giving to all an
opportunity to study and examine be
fore purchasing. The musical pro
gramme of the entertainment proved
a most attractive feature. During the
afternoon Miss Peyton Pritchard sang
and in the evening the Fachutar man
dolin orchestra was heard.
The show will continue to-day and
to-morrow.
THE SYMPHONY
AT THE ORPHEUM
Larger Attendance Than at the Pre
vious Performance and a Very
Interesting Concert.
The symphony concert yesterday after
noon was marked by two material im
provementsâfirst, the audience was much
more numerous than that at the season's
opening a fortnight ago; and, second, the
ghosts of the yesternight's beer and cigars
did not rise up and smite the nose. The
Orpheum had been discreetly aired and
disinfected, and the lilac of smart feminin
ity was given full play in the atmosphere.
The programme was well ordered, al
though it offered but one piece that Mr.
Scheel had not given here before â some
waltzes for string orchestra by Fredrich
Kiel. They are decorous waltzes, care
fully scored and Impassioned. They
might have been written In a frock mat.
and they were played with something of
the respectable spirit of that garment, al
though Mr. Scheel, as usual, conducted
in the semi-dress of evening. The rest of
the programme was versatile and glitter
ing, and splendidly interpreted. Tschai
kowsky's "Romeo and Juliet" overture,
which we were introduced to on that
memorable Sunday afternoon of last sea
son whon Scheel played Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony, was played again with
even greater glow and freer rhythmic ef
fect than at the original performance,
and Schumann's B flat symphony was
given Its full measure of beauty and cor
diality. Especially perfect in the sym
phony was the rendition of the slow move
ment, which was read with liberal feeling,
at times with almost trembling orchestra
tion, and yet never was made banal by
excessive fubato and hysterical emphasis.
"The Entrance of the Gods in "Walhalla,"
from "Rheingold." concluded the concert.
It was played with plenty of pomp and
smash but with hardly as cumulative a
cower as Scheel gave to it the last time.
S.
Sewing School Exhibition.
The Sunshine Sewing School, located on
Harrison street, will give an exhibition
and sale of the work accomplished by the
boys and girls under its care at Sunshine
Hall, 934 Harrison street, to-day, between
the hours of 2 and 6 p. m.
A few months ago many of the young
sters had not been taught to even draw
a needle, but they now turn out garments
of their own handiwork. Their ages are
from 4 to 16 years. A class of young ladies
and mothers will be organized after the
lair If applications come to hand to war

Laura Ella Bailey's Woes.
Laura Ella Bailey filed suit yesterday
against her husband. Lewis H. Balley l
who Is a half owner of the American Iron
Works, for permanent alimony In the
sum of 1100 a month. Mrs. Bailey avers
that In March of 1896 her husband deserted
her. Since that date, she further alleges,
her husband has contributed but $20
toward her support. She does not seek
a divorce, but prays the court to compel
her husband to pay her half of his In
come, which she states Is $200 a month.

the Programme.
It was ladles' night at the Olympic Club
Wednesday evening, and the clubrooms
Were crowded. It was the first under the
new administration and proved a great
success. Incidentally the opportunity was
grasped by the club leaders to talk light,
and the social evening may lead to more
entertainments, but of a different kind.
George Lavigne and Joe Gans may be
matched to fight in the club in the near
future. Superintendent Kennedy has re
ceived a letter from the colored fighter
in which he expresses a strong desire to
meet the Saginaw Kid at 133 pounds. La
vigne is at present rusticating in the
country, and no steps can be taken look
ing to a match until he returns, but it is
not believed he will require much urging
to affix his signature to the articles, pro
vided a fair sized purse is hung up.
The Corbett-Sharkey fiasco in New
York has given the game a black eye in
the East and the professional pugilists
are already complaining. Superintendent
Kennedy says the Olympic Club is not
seeking professional matches because of
the tendency of the fighters to make ex
orbitant demauds, but they may become
more moderate in their demands now.
"There are several clubs in San Fran
cisco," said Mr. Kennedy last night, "that
are organized for the express purpose of
bringing off fights, and under present
conditions we are willing to let them do
so, but if we can secure first class attrac
tionsâmen like McCoy or Sharkeyâ wo
might bang up a purse."
The Olympic is preparing to give a
members' boxing contest about Christmas
or New Year, but the plans may be
changed if a match between Lavigne and
Gans or between other first class men
can be arranged.
The ladies' night programme was ar
ranged by J. A. Hammersmith, leader.
The feature of the evening was a double
headed boxing exhibition, in which the
principals. F. Carter and F. Sullivan, T.
Manning and W. J. Leonard, appeared in
evening dress. They shed the clawham
mers before donning the gloves, but the
spectacle of four young men trying to
duck swings and straight leads handi
capped by four-inch collars furnished no
end of amusement for the spectators.
Almost as novel and vastly more excit- i
ing was a setto between a quartet of Chi
| nese boys. The little almond-eyed Celes
tials knew nothing of the science of the
game, but they started in to do business
from the call of time and kept hard at
work until the referee waded in and un
tangled them from their opponents' cues
and sent them to their corners.
Exhibitions of wrestling were given by
Professor G. S. Miehling and C. T. Kro
ling. J. J. Philips and G. A. Hinkel, In
which honors were even and the rest of
the programme was made up of horizon
tal bar, trapeze performances, acrobatics,
fencing with single sticks and dueling
swords, a dumbbell and wand drill by the
scholars of the Chinese public school,
leaping and other athletic exercises.
In the Divorce Courts.
Joseph C. Giannini has been granted a
divorce from Grace Giannini on the

LEPERS ESCAPE WHEN
FANCY MOVES THEM
LAX METHODS IN VOQUE AT
THE PESTHOUSE.
Two Chinese Climb the Fence While
the Watchman Sleeps and Wan
der at Will Through
the City.
Two escapes within the past three days
is the record at the pesthouse. On Mon
day Lee Kern, a leper in the advanced
stage of that dread disease, took advant
age of the habitual drowsiness of Watch
man Popper, climbed the five foot fence
around the institution and was found by
the police on Tuesday indulging in a
"pipe" In Chinatown.
On Wednesday How Mew Glngr, a leper
suÃpect, made his way to Chinatown with
fas little trouble as his predecessor and
he has not yet been apprehended, though
the Health Department has notified the
police and officers are on the hunt for the
dangerous wanderer.
Lee Kern's good-natured confession when
he was recaptured on Tuesday gives some
idea of the condition of affairs at the
county's pesthouse. Asked why he left
he replied that Chinatpwn was "heap
clean" in comparison with his recent
I quarters. He said, he could get nothing
i that he needed at the pesthouse unless
I he went after it himself, and that he
I found no difficulty in Jeaving the grounds
whenever the fancy struck him.
There is no system of guards at the
i place, the drowsy Max Popper, nephew
of the only Max. being the only obstacle
between the inmates and the people at
I large, and according to the statement of
I his prisoners he is not a strict jailer.
Wanted for Perjury.
J. H. Hogan, 125 Cherry street, swore

last, made a false statement regarding

' The preliminary examination of Will
lam A. Brandos, charged with the murder
of. his 13-year-old daughter, Lillian, wan
commenced in Justice Cliffs court this
morning. -. , . . |
â¢ Brandea to-day appeared cool and
collected, and listened with interest to the;
testimony adduced by Deputy District
Attorneys Allen and Melvin, and his at- )
tornevs. J. E. Bennett and T. W. Sawyer
The small court room was so crowded
that Justice Clift issued an order to clear
the place of all save those who could find
seats. ,
The greater part of the morning was
consumed with explanations and testi- I
mony of Civil Engineer T. A. Havlland |
regarding the Brandes residence, where
the alleged murder was committed, and
at the request of the defense all other :
..witnesses were excluded from the room.
Dr. George F. "Whitworth and Miss j
L-ydia Atterbury were the principal wit- ;
nesses during the afternoon. Dr. Whit- !
â¢ â¢worth told how Brandes had called him
to attend a girl who had taken poison
and had killed herself. When he arrived
at the house he found Lillian Brandos
. dead. On the girl's right cheek he found
, two scars aim on the left one, while j
: B-ound her neck â¢ was a mark, evidently
â _jade by. a rope. â  â¢â¢â¢â ' : . ' . â  j
" The witness testified also that Brandes ;
an&Brandes' wife were in. the room at I
the time. The former paced up and down
and seemed rather excited, : lie had. called
the doctor's attention to : certain aprons
lying on the bed, remarking that with j
those she had hanged . herself. -He also
told the doctor that the first he Knew of |
the death was when his. wife came Into
his room saying, "Oh; AT, Lilly has tried
to hang herself.'* â¢ Brandt-s had also said
that he "would give ..a good deal if this i
'hadn't happened;". As to the abrasion on j
the- girl's left cheek, Branded had re-, J
quested â¢ that a- piece .of sticking plaster
be applied as ."if looked bad," and that
It was a. bruise sustained in a fall while
the girl had had. a. tussle With her mother
0 the day -before... â  ' ... ". â¢-â  '. p". ,'â¢â¢â¢â¢ â 
â¢ Miss Lydia Atterbury. the next witness,
testified that the. dead girt had been a pu- j
pfl in her class. She had last seen Lillian
on tiki 15th of November and that on the;
Friday. following she received a .note from i
Mrs. 'Brandes stating, that the.. girl had
gone to the country. Lillian, said the "wit-. I
ivess. was a girl of .! average.; IntelligenQe, !
and. 'usually cheerful: The fact- that she 1
was. not further along in her /.studies for
one of her age she attributed to lack of

TRAGIC DEATH OF
MRS. A. L MARBLE
WAS INSTANTLY KILLED IN A
RUN A VTA Y.

Cause â Deceased Was Sister to
Mrs. J. G. Blfline.
OAKLAND, Dee. I.â Mrs. Abble L. Mar
ble, sister of Mrs. James G. Blalne, was
, killed in the orchard adjoining the
I grounds of Socrates Huff at San Jjeandro
j this afternoon.
Shortly before 3 o'clock this afternoon
Mrs. Marble drove up to the Huff resi
dence In a piano box buggy, accompanied
by a 10-year-old lad named Smith, a son
of one of her neighbors. While still seat
ed in the buggy she was Informed by
] Mips Mamie Huff that her mother was
; absent, hence she decided not to alight.
j After bidding adieu she drove around to
the side of the house, when her horse be
came suddenly uncontrollable and .-ashed
i Into the orchard.
It is supposed that a thick hranch of an
i apple tree struck Mrs. Marble Just over
I the heart, throwing her out of the buggy
â  on the ground, where she was found dead
' a few moments later by the gardener.
The Smith boy was also thrown out of the
; vehicle, but escaped with only a few
i slight bruises.
Dr. B. F. Mason was quickly summoned,
j but upon his arrival heistated that death
I must have been almost instantaneous.
Coroner Baldwin was then notified and
Deputy Quellan took charge of the re
i mains, conveying them ; to the residence
of Mrs. R. G. Byxbte. In Fruitvale, where
I the deceased had made her home the past
twelve years. The funeral will be con-

BERKELEY'S LAST
FOOTBALL RALLY
BERKELEY, Dec. I.â To-night there was enactec upon the campus of
the University of California a scene the like of which has never been
known in; Berkeley before. It was the last and by all means the
most picturesque outburst of the new spirit o college enthusiasm
which has captivated Berkeley during- the late football season. Sur
rounding a. hiige- bonfire stood arrayed the whole student body In mas
querade costume,;. dancing and yelling, and shout ng and hurrahing for
their first great triumph on the gridiron.:
A strong flavor of Princeton custom seasoned t'io whole affair. In fact,
the old Princeton tnethod was followed out In detal . At an Informal rally
In the Harmon gymnasium this afternoon Cochran was asked to describe
a Princeton rally. 1 "Each; class." he said, "has a garb of Its own. The
seniors don nightshirts, the Juniors swr.-iters and plugs, the sophomores
old sacks and the freshmen dress as hoboes." Not ling less than nlght
shlrtH, sacks and jhobo- dress would suit i Berkeley men after that. And
they went Into the thing .with a nelish that nothing but a victory of 22-0
could have Imparted. . , ' " . â¢
Shortly after b;alf-past V the old college bell In North Hall began to
toll, and it tolled continuously till the last ember of the huge fire was ex
tinguished; ahfl the "last cheer for. old California died away. It was the
signal for the. assembly to begin. From, all quarters students began to
flock upon the campus. They came In: nightshirts, they came In sacks,
they came as .tramps, they came in every possible condition of masquer
ade. Some hafl blackened faces, some had clothes that baffle all descrip
tion. .
First of alj were the seplors, In white with black plugs, then the
Juniors with gray; plugs and sweaters, then the sophs with burlap, and
lastly the freshles. An Immense circle formed around the pile of lum
ber as Percy :Hall. Berkeley's football Captain, started the blaze. In a
few seconds a' lurid flame shot up and In its light the men of Berkeley gave
ve.nt to rejoicings over blue and gold's first triumph over the cardinal. For
hours they kept It up, Blnglng and yelling until all the songs and yells
were exhausted ten times over.
: Then, to end all, they gathered together, and It was three cheers for
the team, three cheers for Garry Cochran, three for Percy Hall, three for
the score,' and" last of all : three rousing cheers for their Alma Mater, and
with that the last cheer had been given for the football season of 1898.
THE SA:tf FBANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1898.
CAME OUT OF
THE MIST TO
DESTRUCTION
Carelessness Causes
a Bad Wreck.
LIVES SAVED BY JUMPING
HAYWAEDB LOCAL RAMMED BY
A GRAVEL TRAIN.
During the Fog in the Early Morning
a Wandering Special Kept the
Main Track Instead of
Switching.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Deo, 1.
The Haywards local and a gravel train
collided head on early this morning at the.
Haywards depot, and a train crew only
escaped certain death by jumping just be
fore the two locomotives met. One engine
was wrecked and its tender instantly
twisted into scrap iron.
The accident occurred In the fog that
prevailed at daybreak. The Haywards
local, which consists of an engine and
two cars, wus standing at the depot with
steam up, waiting to leave at 5:45 for the
Oakland mole. Engineer Tom Collins and
his fireman, Henry Haas, were waiting
for the signal to start, when Collins saw
a. headlight come into view suddenly right
ahead of him and on the same track.
Collins saw that the train was rapidly
approaching and that a collision was un
avoidable, so he turned his lever and
started his train backward. A moment
later the two engines struck, but Collins
and his fireman Jumped just in time to
avoid being crushed in the wreck.
The gravel train was a special and was
going about thirty miles an hour. It con
sisted of but three empty gravel cars and
was on its way to the pits at Niles. The
locomotive was a heavy machine, and
when it struck the local its tender, hav
ing to stand the shock, was knocked to
pieces. The engine of the passenger train
was of light construction, and when hit
by the heavier locomotive it was knocked
clear off its trucks and sent flying for
over forty feet. It was driven back on to
its tender and fell forward again, bury
ing the pilot in the ground.
Walter Edwards, the engineer of the
special, stuck to his post, and the few
people in the depot expected to see him
crushed by the impact. His engine, how
ever, was not materially injured, although
it completely wrecked the other locomo
tive. There was only one passenger In
the local train and he escaped with a se
vere jolt.
E. 8. Field, a brakeman, was the only
person Injured. He was thrown down
by the shock and badly hurt about the
head.
The passenger coaches and gravel cars
were not damaged, as they had clear
tracks on which to rebound. All travel
was suspended until noon, by which time
the wrecking train had put the damaged
engines in such shape that they could be
hauled to the West Oakland yards. It is
said that the gravel train was at fault
and should not have gone Into the depot
until after the local had pulled out.

THE STANDING
OF THE CLUBS
IS IN DOUBT
Santa Cruz and Cof
froth Claim Second.
ALL WRONG, SAYS ROBINSON
THE LEAGUE HAS BEEN MAN
AGED POORLY.
Not a Thought Has Been Given to
the Future, Which Is the Most
Important Point
of All.
By Joe Corbett.
There Is all sorts of trouble ahead for
some one "high up" in the estimation of
the Pacific Coast League. The correct |
standing of the clubs has yet to be com- j
puted, and Borne one "high up" must do
the work.
Of course, the trouble as yet has not
in reality put In an appearance, but when
Manager Coffroth, an able gentleman, j
comes out flat-footed and says, with all ;
the veracity at his command, that the
club he represents (when Bunker and :
Raver permit him) Is in second place, it I
is really time to prepare for the worst.
Coffroth insists that he Bpent much time |
in figuring out the whereabouts of his
collection. He is positive that his figures j
are correct, and yet from the town of j
Santa Cruz comes the cry that the Sand I
Crabs still hold second position, despite j
the reverses met at the hands of the Ath- j
letics and Oaklands but a week past.
This is but an inkling of what is to be
expected when the gentlemen "high up" |
is heard from. That his figures will be j
noted may be judged from the following j
little extract secured from a Santa Cruz I
paper:
Of course, as might be looked for, the league
officials, who are resorting to all sorts of
trickery to down Santa Cruz, will come out [
with a new sÂ«-t uf figures showing Santa Cruz |
to be in fourth place.
The above little item is but a starter, so i
to say.. It makes no difference to the i
Sand Crabs how the league figures out
their standing; they are in second place
according to their own reckoning, and |
there they propose to remain, it defeat ;
does not change the situation. And Man
ager Coffroth also proposes to remain ;
wnere he is, yet J. really believe the hand- >
some, curly headed boy will be pacified. |
How he ever could have figured himself \
in second place is a mystery to me still.
He claims, however, that out of the la^st
ten games played six were awarded on :
account of the opposing teams playing |
Eastern men principally; one was a com- j
plete victory and tne other a defeat. It
is in these games awarded his club on
protest that he finds himself in second
place, but Colonel Robinson says that the
Napoleon of managers errs terrifically.
me colonel claims that he has figured
it out himself, and knows for a certainty |
that he alone Is correct beyond doubt.
And so it goes. Every manager in the
league will have the standing of his club
figured out and not one of them will agree
with the official; and then lookout for the !
unearthing of real scandals. Trouble is in |
the air over this standing of clubs' prop
osition, and from the manner in which the
entire league was run and managed 1 can
not see how trouble can be averted. Not,
I'll wager, in the history of the National |
League, have as many games been pro- i
tested as there have been in this league |
of ours In the past three months. It is i
something awful when one considers it,
and the blame rests entirely on the fact
that the league from top to bottom has
been miserably managed. Rules were i
made and disregarded at will. It was
simply a case with all concerned to get
the money in any old way. Too much {
stress was laid upon this moneyed propo
â ltion. It was this that led a few of j
the clubs to playing two and three East- i
crn men when the rules distinctly read |
that each club was allowed one Eastern ;
man and no more. But what did they ;
care for rules. Two or three Eastern men
Would draw a big crowd and money galore |
would ensue, borne of these clubs, or
rather all of them, show that resorting j
to such methods would mean the loss of \
the game by protest, yet this did not
deter them. Game after game was played,
and when, finally, a meeting of the direc
tors was called to discuss various ques
tions the protested games occupied all the i
time, and what a "hot old time" it was. j
\\ ordy mix-ups were frequent, and after I
a halt was finally called the managers
began figuring unto themselves how they
had profited in securing a few protested
games. As a result of this meeting Cof
froth figured his team In second place, as
has already bet-n mentioned. So did j
Santa Cruz, and the colonel states that I
everybody is wrong in the matter but he.
What the outcome will be I am not in a
position to state yet. I am apprehen
sive.
One very Important point has been over
lookedâthe future of baseball on this
coast. After the miseraole judgment dis
played In the management of the pres
ent league but little confidence remains
In the hearts of those who have all along
desired to see a league run in accordance
with the rules that govern such undertak
ings. The blame tor it all can hardly
be placed at anybody's door. All connect
ed, In my opinion, were too avaricious and
thought not ot the future and what It
would bring if things were run on the
proper basis.
There is hardly any use, however, In
finding fault. What has been done can
not be undone, yet, if the same people
running baseball at the present time pro
pose continuing next year a system had
better be created at once. No lover of
the game will put up with all the non
sense that has been the people's lot of
late. At another time I will touch on this
question again. What Is more important
at present is the correct standing of the
teams. If the colonel has this problem
solved, as he states, let him out with it
and give Coffroth and the Sand Crabs an
opportunity to show how the entire affair
Is mixed up as they imagine. If they
are both in second place where will the
others line up at?
The following is a rather amusing squib
regarding Catcher Chanceâ and inciden
tally the trouble young catchers are sub
jected to on enterinlg the league:
I watched one of the Chicago-Baltimore
games, said an "old timer" to the Chicago
Journal's sporting editor, last summer, and
was Just tickled over a maneuver made by one
of the Baltimore players which resulted in the
discomfiture of Chance and a run through the
resulting error. Chance was behind the bat.
One of the ex-ehamplons batted a fairly high
foul which Chance started after. It fell about
twenty-five, feet away from the visiting play
ers' bench. As soon as the ball was hit, two
of the Baltlmores jumped to their feet and com
menced a vigorous movement among the batÂ«.
kicking them from side to side, as If to make
way for Chance no that he could get the
ball. The young backstop evidently naw the
movement, for ho hesitated, apparently think
ing ho was running Into bats, made a desper
ate dash and let the ball slip from Ms ner
vous grasp. And the two Orioles hugged them
selves in (lendlsh glee at the success of their
ruse.
Verdict of Murder.

A BRIDE MADE WIDOW
BY HER OWN MAD ACT
Mrs. Anna Mantell, Young
and Pretty, a Mur
deress and Al
most a Sui
cide.
She Says That She Feared Vio
lence at the Hands of the
Man She Called Hus
band, and So She
Shot Him.
Anna Mantell, a hride of less than a
month, is now at the Oakland Receiving
Hospital, a murderess, yet not until thla
rr. rning will she know the truth. Last
night she tossed in pain from a wound
she hoped might prove fatal, and in an
swer to questions which she did not caxe
to answer she would only reply, "Ask
him." And he. her young husband, W'l
liam F. Mantell, lay cold in death at the
Alameda morgue. The woman was Anna
Beth, daughter of the proprietor of ihe
Cld Louvre of this city.
After ihe tragedy that made the pretty
young bride a widowâ for she is pretty
ard but 20 years oldâ Mrs. Mantell did not
care to live. Without knowing or earing
What had been the effect of the shots nred
In her anger and disappointment she
turned the weapon on herself, but her
hysterical aim saved her life, for the bul
let glanced oft her skull and left a wound
that is but superficial.
The shooting occurred on Santa Clara
avenue, near Union street, at a spot
where the shade trees obscured the light
of the street lamps. There were no wit
nesses. The woman fired two shots be
fora she attempted to take her own life.
One Of the shots struck Mantell over the
right ear and penetrated the brain. The
other went through his. heart.
Dr. C. H. Lubbirk was attracted by the
report of the pistol and hastened to the
scene. The man was lying on the side
walk lifeless, and the woman was leaning
against a fence with her hands clasped
over her head viewing her murderous
work.
"I have shot my husband," she said.
"If he dead?" She men. fainted and was
carried to the physician's home.
Later the wounded woman was hur
ried across the marsh road in a furniture
wagon to the Receiving Hospital, where
r>r. W. F. Porter was waiting to receive
her. A hasty examination of her head
showed that there wis nothing serious,
and when the girl heard the doctor's
opinion she confessed to some disappoint
ment that her effort to die had not been
successful.
The wounded bride's story was not told
connectedly, but between her attacks of
excitement she gave a clear explanation
of her life during the twenty-eight days
she has been a wife.
"We were married on November 3 in
Ban Francisco," she said, "and during the
greater part of the time we have been
cjuarreling. Soon after the marriage my '
husband told me that he could, prove ft
was not performed legally and he fre
quently tantalized me with such re
marks."
The young woman then uttered some
disjointed sentences, apparently intended
only for herself. She Rsked for
her mother and added that there
would be great surprise at her home
when she did not return and it grew late.
1- I don't live with my husband," she
said. "I have lived at home and they
don't know about it. I wish you would
send for my mother and I will tell her
all."
Her mother is Mrs. Beth and she lives
at Sl6 Filbert street in this city.

ANNA MANTELL, the Bride
Who Made Herself a Widow.
The girl rambled along, conveying the
Impression that their marriage was se
cret. Then she told of frequent quarrels
and of frequent threats of her husband
to choke her or to kill her some way be
cause, apparently, she was about to re
veal, something that he preferred should
remain unknown. After a time she de
cided that when her husband started In
reality to carry out his threats she would
be prepared for him. Her preparation
consisted of buying a revolver, which she
has carried in her pockets, loaded, for i
some days.
Last evening Mrs. Mantell and her hus
band crossed the bay from San Francis
co for the purpose of trying to arrive at
some understanding regarding their
troubles.
"I do not know whether we went to
Alameda by the broad or narrow guage,"
she said, "as I am a perfect stranger,
but Mr. Mantell said he had a sister liv
ing there and that we might call on her.
We had not been off the train many min
utes before we renewed our quarreling.
In fact, we had been quarreling all the
way across the bay. He taunted me
about our marriage not being legal and I
resented his remarks. We had not walk
ed far before he put his hands violently
on my shoulder as though he intended
to harm me. I Remembered his threats
and told him to desist. Again he put his
hands on me and so roughly that I al
most fell. I did not wait for him to do
it again. I pulled out my pistol and lired
and fired, and fired. If that trigger had
not gone back on me I would have killed
him. He intended to kill me, I believe,
and when he really began to be violent 1
decided to act first. 1 did not want to
live after I had fired at him, and so I
shot myself. The doctor says 1 shall
soon be well. I don't want to live, I
want to die; really I do."
In answer to some questions about their
married life Mrs. Mantell referred to her
husband and said he would doubtless be
pleased to give all the particulars. She
said she did not wish to see him, but told
Detective Herbert of the District Attor
ney's office that he could tell her husband
she had sent him. Herbert quietly re
plied that he was not at all anxious to
Interview her husband.
"And it was so different a month ago,"
said the moaning murderess, and she
muttered the brief history of that roman
tic period over again. frequent>y giving
out hints that it was all a secret and that
her mother would be waiting in vain for
her to return.
This morning Mrs. Mantell will be in
formed by the Sheriff that she must stand
trial for murdering her husband.
Much mystery surrounds the case. De
ceased was a brother-in-law of J. L. An
sel of 2004 Encinal avenue, Alameda. He
had b*en residing in Alameda but three
weeks, having taken, rooms at the resi
dence of Mrs. Agnes Bremer, 823 Central
avenue. He was 26 years old and a man
of very boyish appearance. He had posed
as a single man.
His brother-in-law learned of the shoot
ing through a Call reporter. He stated
that about 3 o'clock this afternoon a
woman telephoned to his place of business
inquiring when Mantoll would be there.
"I knew the young fellow was in some
woman scrape," said Ansel, "but I did
not know the nature- of it. He was very
fond of the society of women, and I
warned him only yesterday that unless
he mended his ways he would get Into
trouble. I do not know who he was go
ing with nor the name of the woman who
shot him."
Another brother, Ansel, said he
had heard Mantell had been married by
contract. He had noticed deceased had
acted strangely for several weeks as
though something unusual was worryinjr,
him. He also said he knew Mantell had
been associating with several married
women in San Francisco. At the time
he was shot deceased was carrying a
bundle which contained a lady's" waist.
On his person was found a memorandurrt
book containing several addresses and a
card on which was written "Miss Delia
Leslie, in care of Lizzie Keegan, 134 Pow
ell street, San Francisco." There was also
the address of Sl6 Filbert street, which
the woman claimed was the home of her
mother. â¢
Deceased has two sisters residing In
Alameda and one visiting in Germany.
The Beth family at 816 Filbert street
were anxiously awaiting the, return of the
daughter. She had left home at 2 o'clock
In the afternoon for the purpose of taking
lunch with her father, Adolph H. Beth,
one of the proprietors of the Old Louvre,
in the basement of the Phelan building.
The parents did not say so, but a neigh
bor's child saw a satchel in her hand at
the time of her departure, which strength
ens the theory that she had prepared for
a Journey.
Later when the news of the murder and
attempted suicide was broken to them
they were dumfounded. The father said
his daughter left him at the Louvre at 4
o'clock, saying she was going home. Be
fore she left the house and during the
time passed in the company of her father
she exhibited no trace of anxiety or
trouble and went about wi her usual joy
ous mood. The parent denied all kndwl
edge of any person named Mantell. They
say their daughter kept company with no
young men. and so far as they were ac
quainted with her affairs, had not a single
girl companion. She was of a peculiar
disposition, yet they believed she had no

secrets from them. They further say she
avoided the society of men and she never
attended any place of amusement or
made any : visit unaccompanied by either
her mother -or her sister May, a girl of 16.
After Beth heard the news he went to
Alameda. For a long time after he had
gone the mother controlled the grief that
was boiling in her bosom, but at length
she burst into hysterics. . , ,
*t.V . her ,? must have been a 'reason for
this, the mother tearfully declared. "She

GAGE GIVES
GRANT SOME
PLAIN TALK
Believes the San Di
egan Knifed Him.
ENCOUNTER IN THE PALACE
GOVERNOR-ELECT CHIDED TOR
HIS ATTITUDE.
He Retorts by Accusing the Sena
torial Aspirant of Using His
Friends and Money Against
Him.
Governor-elect Gage is not at all likely
to inject himself into the Senatorial fight
in behalf of U. S. Grant Jr. with a degree
of enthusiasm calculated to warm the
heart of the San Diegan. As a matter
of fact Mr. Gage Is not counting on mix
ing in that imbroglio at all, and if he
does, the amount of benefit the aforesaid
San Diegan will derive from it will be in
finiteslmally small.
Mr. Grant understands this thoroughly,
for his informant was none other than
the Governor-elect himself.
The information was imparted in the
court of the Palace Hotel yesterday, and
not only Mr. Grant, but a half dozen by
standers heard It. Mr. Grant was stand
ing in the court talking to Milton Green,
his political manager, when Mr. Gage en
tered. The San Diegan accosted the Gov
ernor-elect, requesting a moment's con
versation with him. . The couple moved
off a few feet to one of the columns, near
which several gentlemen were standing.
"Mr. Gage," began the Senatorial as
pirant, "I understand you are against the
south in this Senatorial fight and are
supporting a Northern California man."
That is not true," replied Mr. Gage.
"I am taking no part whatever in the
Senatorial fight, nor do I intend to."
"But you are certainly not working in
the interest of the southern part of the
State."
"I certainly am not. working against it,
but even were I to take an active part
in this fight and give my support to a
southern candidate, I would by no means
feel in duty bound to give it to San
Diego's choice."
"What do you mean?" demanded Mr.
Grant in a loud voice. His face flushed
and he was visibly excited.
Mr. Gage was not of the same temper
ature as the proverbial cucumber, as his
thoughts reverted to the peculiarities of
the vote in San Die'eo County at the re
cent election, and his voice, too, increased
in volume as he replied:
"Simply this. I uo not consider myself
under any obligations whatever to you.
for It has come to my ears from reliable
sources that your money and your frlenus
were used against me. In other word 3, I
believe I did not receive fair treatment in
San Diego County and that you are re
sponsible for it."
Mr. Grant appeared to be entirely satis
fied with this explanation and turned
away.
That is the substance of the Interview.
None of it was carried on In tones too
low for the bystanders to hear, while the
latter part was fairly shouted out by bpth
gentlemen.
In referring to Grant's friends knifing
him Mr. Gage only repeated what has
been common rumor In political circles
ever since the. election. It is notorious
that while San Diego County gave Gage
something like 350 majority the Republi
can legislative ticket received 1200 ma
jority. This, in view of the fact that
Grant was all along an avowed candi
date for the Senate and the legislative
nominees were his men. Gage Is not al
together without a basis for his suspi
cion that he was "knifed."
Mr. Gage was seen at his apartments
In the Palace later in the day, but posi
tively refused to talk about his Inter
view with Mr. Grant, referring his ques
tioner to that gentleman for information
as to what was said. Mr. Grant was
equally uncommunicative and it remained
for one of the bystanders to narrate the
encounter. 'â¢

CHIEF LEES'
HIGH REGARD
FOR WITTMAN
Proves It by Counter
manding an Order.
THE CAPTAIN CALLED DOWN
POLICE COMMISSIONERS MEET
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
Head of the Central District Makes a
Call Upon Colonel Tobin.
Lieutenant Esola's New
Duties.
Chief Lees" proclamation that only the
warmest friendship existed between him
self and Captain Wittman was attested to
again yesterday, when in language more
forcible than elegant the Chief counter
manded a written order of the captain.
It came about In this way:
When Sergeant Tobin took charge of the
police detail on duty at the Baldwin
Hotel ruins, yesterday morning, he was
given a written order from Captain Witt
man not to allow anybody but firemen
in the discharge of their duty to pass
within the lines without the permission
of Fire Chief Sullivan. Sergeant Tobin
proceeded to carry out his orders, and In
a short time was involved in all sorts of
trouble.
Nobody passed the line, though, until
E. J. Baldwin and his agent, Mr. Hahn,
of Madison & Burke, arrived. When they
attempted to approach the ruins they
were halted by a policeman, who listened
patiently to their protests and then ad
vised them to see Sergeant Tobin. The
sergeant was soon found, but he could
not help them. He showed his written
order from Wittman, and said he would
have to abide by It. If Chief Sullivan
should happen around he would undoubt
edly give them permission to go where
they pleased, but until they obtained such
permission they would have to keep back
with the others.
But Baldwin would not wait until Chief
Sullivan "happened", around; instead he
hunted up a telephone and registered a
kick with Chief Lees. The veteran was
deeply interested at once and requested
Baldwin to have Sergeant Tobin go to the
telephone.
"what's the reason you won't let Mr.
Baldwin pass the fire lines?" demanded
the Chief when the sergeant called him
up.
"I have orders not to allow anybody to
pass without Fire Chief Sullivan's per
mission," was the reply.
"Who issued those orders?" and the
telephone wire began to splutter and
throw off blue sparks.
"Captain Wittman sent me a written
order.
"To with Captain Wittman and his
written order. You let anybody pass those
lines who has business there, of course
at their own risk, and never mind your
written order." The Chief hung up his
telephone, while the girls in "Central"
took their fingers out of their ears and
breathed naturally again.
Police Commissioner Tobin has returned
to the city, and the Commissioners will
meet next Wednesday evening.
Captain Wittman called on Colonel
Tobin at the Hibernia Bank yesterday,
presumably to assure that gentleman ox
his great regard for Chief Lees. Whether
any cognizance will be taken of the Lees-
Wittman Mutual Admiration Society at
the meeting of the Commissioners, none
of them will say.
The Call yesterday, in referring to
Lieutenant Esola's assumption of control
over Chinatown and the tenderloin, and
the consequent contraction of Captain
Wittman's sway, inadvertently omitted
the City Cemetery from the captain's dis
trict. He still retains jurisdiction over
that section as well as Cow Hollow and
Seal Rocks.
Lieutenant Esola will be held responsible
for the peace of Chinatown, hereafter,
as well as the suppression of evils in the
tenderloin. Consequently he will have
full control over the officers in those dis
tricts.
ARE WORKING FOR
SMOOTH PAVEMENTS
EARNEST EFFORTS OF THE MER
CHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
Chain of Bitumen Blocks in the Busi
ness Part of the City â Many
Outside Streets Have
Been Improved.
The officers of the Merchants' Associa
tion are very much gratified over the suc
cess met with in the matter of having
the old cobble paved streets repaved with
bituminous rock. The last block to fall
into line Is on Washington street, between
Kearny and Montgomery. All but two
property-owners have signed for the im
provement and they will come in before
the end of the month. The necessity of
the replacing of the old round-head cob
bles with bitumen is the new Hall of Jus
tice. This block is one of the links of a
chain intended to surround that part of
the city bounded by Market, Kearny,
Montgomery and the street under con
sideration. As soon as the railroad com
pany learns what kind of street car sys
tem it can put on Montgomery that
thoroughfare will be paved with bitumen
from Post to California, and the remain
ing distance to Washington will soon fol
low.
For a time It was believed that Cali
fornia street would be the connecting
link between the two long streets, but
obstacles have arisen which will prevent
It. The grade is so steep that bitumen
cannot be laid and the property-owners
object to having basalt bjocks. They de
mand wooden blocks. This cannot be, be
cause the bitumen combine has worked
the city fathers so that only the material
the former sells can be used.
The California street property-owners
see no reason to change from the old
rock pavement If they cannot have what
they wantâ a noiseless pavement. As
soon as the work of paving Washington
street is started the officers of the Mer
chants' Association will turn their atten
tion to Kearny with a view of having
the bitumen pavement extended from Cal
ifornia to Washington. This will be about
the time the Hall of Justice will have
been finished. This is not intended as a
Joke, for the Supervisors-elect, especially
those in the northern part of the city
have promised to see that the work on
that structure is carried on without any
more delay. It is expected that by this
time next year Kearny and Montgomery
streets will be paved with bitumen from
Market to Washington.
Another piece of work that the associa
tion has in hand is the paving of Second
street from Market to Mission. This im
provement will be started very soon. On
gutter street, between Grant avenue and
btockton, all but one or two property
owners have signed for a modern pave
ment. On account of the steepness of the
grade it will be necessary to have ba
salt blocks, but these will be laid upon a
concrete foundation and the seams be
tween the blocks will be filled with con
crete, so that the surface will be very
smooth and pleasant to drive over.

HATS
The top of creation. You are poorly dressed without a good
hat; it need not be expensive. Good hats are not expensive
here ; they are two and a half â thats's all. Two dollars and a
half buys a first-rate fedora or derby here. Three and a half
elsewhere. You know something of hats, come in to see ours.
UNCLE SAM HIRES
COOLIE LABOR IN
THE POSTOFFICE
Clerks' Salaries $75

POSTAL WAGES IN MANILA
TWENTY SKILLED EMPLOYES
WORKING FOB THAT.
They Are Spaniards and Can Live as
Usual on That Small Sum
and Be Able to Buy Bice
and Cigarettes.
The postofflce at Manila in the Philip
pines has been in control of United States
officials since July 30 of this year. From
that date until October 11, the date of the
last report received from there, the busi
ness and receipts have been up to the
grade of a first-class postoffice.
During 1 the period mentioned there were
Issued 1799 money orders, amounting in
value to $46,721 17, plus $211 62 fees and
$27 96 war tax. The value of money orders
paid was $1363 15. The total number of
registered pieces received was 4247; dis
patched, 3424. The receipts for stamps
sold aggregated $8314. All this business
has been confined to Manila- and Cavite,
but when postal communication shall
have been opened up in the rest of the
Philippines it. Is expected that the volume
of business and the receipts will be large
ly augmented.
ThÂ«most interesting thing connected with
the acquisition of the Manila postofflce
is the adoption by the Federal Govern
ment of the cheap labor facilities of the
islands. Six men were sent from the San
Francisco postoffice to Manila, and this
number was reinforced by fourteen men
from Manila. Two of these latter are
United States soldiers who had enlisted
from the postal service, and twelve are
Spanish postal employes retained because
of their knowledge of the Spanish lan
fuage and the routine of the office. These
paniards received before the American
occupation the salary of $150 each per an
num in Mexican silver, being equal to
about $75 in American silver or gold coin.
The office was closed every alternate day,
and on working -days it was closed for
a two or three hours' siesta, beginning
about noon. The total number of em
ployes was 200, but they took life easy
and did the work of about twenty Ameri
cans. The twelve Spaniards who are re
tained receive from the United States
Government salaries ranging from $150 to
$200 per annum in Mexican silverâ such
being the ruling rate of wages In the
Philippines for that kind of service, but
they have to work every day instead of
every alternate day as heretofore.
This startling- innovation by Uncle Sam
into the domain of coolie labor and peon
age Is looked upon with disfavor by Gov
ernment employes who regard the Manila
postofflce wage system as an entering
wedge for a reduction of wages and a
consequent lowering of the standard of
living to that of the Tagallos and ChU
MRS. BOTKIN'S TRIAL.
Both Sides Beady to Proceed Next
Monday.
The trial of Mrs. Cordelia. Botkin, ac
cused of murdering: Mrs. J. P. Dunning
and Mrs. J. D. Deane, will probably not be
delayed when the case is called next Mon
day in Judgre Cook's court. The attorneys
for the defense say the question of juris
diction will not be raised and no techni
calities will be used t obstruct progress.
Mrs. Botkin, who is at the House of
Correction, is in good health and spirits,
and says she is anxious for the trial to
begin, as she is sure of oelng acquitted.
Her attorneys have about ten witnesses,
whose names they refuse to divulge. It Is
possible, they say, that no evidence will
be needed to clear the defendant, as the
prosecution may fail to establish a case.
Assistant District Attorney Hosm'er Is
ready to â  proceed with the prosecution,
and he expects a speedy trial after the !
Jury has been secured.
George A. Knight, senior counsel for the
accused woman, has been out of town for
several weeks, and it is reported that he
has been to Delaware In the Interests of j
his client. He is expected to return Sat
urday. Attorneys Frank McGowan and
Charles S. Wheeler of Humboldt, who art
associated with Knight, will both assist
at the trial.
On Sunday night the fourteen witnesses
now en route from Delaware will reacn
this city. They will have several days'
rest, while the jury is being drawn, before
they take the stand to testify against tha
alleged poisoner.
Dinner to Coach Cochran.

nia will this evening: tender to Garrett
