SPANISH GUNBOAT LIQERA
FIRES AT AN AMERICAN
TORPEDO-BOAT DESTROYER
HAVANA, April 26.â A dispatch from Cardenas to La Lucha says that the
Spanish gunboat Liqera and an American torpedo-boat destroyer met off Cayo
Piedra. The American destroyer opened fire and the gunboat accepted the chal
lenge. Eleven cannon shots were fired by the Liqera, according to the dispatch,
and apparently they did considerable damage to the American torpedo-boat
destroyer, for she retreated, listing badly as she moved off. The commander of
the gunboat was Antonio Perez Reudon.
The American fleet is still sailing to and fro in sight of Havana. Its presence
has aroused the greatest enthusiasm throughout the island for war. Seventeen
young women called on Captain-General Blanco to-day and requested permission
from him to go as vivandie res with the Spanish army if it should invade the United States.
The Colonial Government has decided not to grant any leaves of absence to
its civilian employes who desire to join the volunteers.
At the Cabinet election held last Sunday many Cubans and Spaniards in good
standing in the city were elected. The Cabinet will assemble on May 4. The elec
tions for Senators will be held on Thursday.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, April 26.â
General Garcia, commanding the
Cuban forces in the eastern end of the
island, is now in full possession of
the United States' military plan of
campaign. He received his informa
tion from Lieutenant Rowan of the
Nineteenth Infantry, who has suc
ceeded in landing on the coast of
Cuba and reaching the insurgent
forces.
Lieutenant Rowan was ordered by
the Secret Service Bureau to go on a
secret mission in behalf of the War
Department. It was at first thought
that his destination was Porto Rico.
Then definite orders were issued for
him to proceed to Jamaica and thence
cross to Cuba and endeavor to reach
General Calixto Garcia's camp and
communicate to the general the plans j
of the United States Government.
He was also to ask the rebel leader
to make arrangements for effecting i
a junction of the insurgents in South- j
eastern Cuba with a probable Ameri- i
can expedition.
Lieutenant Rowan was told to ob- '
tain information of the character of !
the country and to make maps and
plans for the use of the Information
Bureau as soon as he made a landing.
He sailed from Jamaica on April 9
by the Atla3 steamer and reached

MEN ARE NOW COMING
TO MINE THIS HARBOR
NEW YORK, April 26.â Six regular army sol
diers, a detail from Company A of the Battery of
Engineers at Willetts Point, L. 1., in charge of
Corporal Henry Beck, left for San Francisco this
afternoon to superintend the laying of mines in
the harbor there.
One of the men said that they would report
to the United States engineer officer at San
Francisco, and that it would probably take three
or four days to properly mine the harbor. He
said that after the work was finished the city
would be absolutely safe from a hostile fleet.
Kingston on April 15. He put him
self at once in communication with
Mr. Dent, United States Consul here,
and endeavored to cross over.
Eventually an expedition was or
ganized through the Cuban Junta
with an expert pilot and guides. Lieu
tenant Rowan left St. Anns Bay on
April 24 at 2 o'clock in the morning.
He started with a good breeze and
expected to. arrive last Monday morn
ing.
His mission is one of great danger,
and if captured he would be treated
as a spy. The greatest precautions
were exercised here to conceal his
mission. No definite news has been
received of his safe arrival. His
schooner will be hidden until the re
turn of a messenger announcing his
arrival in Garcia's camp. He will then

F. DKWT.Y. KEY WEST. Fla.. April
26. â Havana is in a wild state of appre
hension and dread. Bombardment
from the American fleet has been ex
pected from day to day, and now the in
habitants of the panic-stricken city have
decided in their own minds that an ac
tive siege will not be delayed longer
than daybreak to-morrow.
Business has been practically sus
pended ever since cable communication
from the United States was cut off. The
prices of provisions of all sorts were
doubled on Saturday, and Monday
morning found them again more than
doubled.
Many dealers are already refusing to
sell except in most limited Quantities,
and agents of the army will probably
take control of every grocery and pro
vision store in the city before the end of
the week. Suffering among the poorer
classes, more especially among those
suspected of anti-Spanish sentiment* is
already something terrible. Those re
concentrados who were by order of
General Weyler brought into the city,
are now being driven into the country
at the point of the bayonet, there to
starve to death, as they are doing by the
score. A blockade of a month will pro
duce results too terrible to contemplate.
Foreigners of all classes â and Span
iards, too, for that matter â are clamor
ing for an opportunity to get out of the
island. Were there 100 neutral ships in
Havana harbor to-night they could all
leave to-morrow with full passencer

Story, Not Confirmed, That the Spanish
Transport Montserrat Succeeded
in Running the Blockade.
HONGKONG, April 26.â 0. F. Williams, American Consul at Manila,
arrived here to-day. He reports that the Spaniards have moored the
cruiser Castilla at Manila to act as a floating battery, taking guns from one
side to Corregidor Island at the entrance to the harbor.
The cruiser arrived from Spain a few days ago with many war sup
plies, probably including torpedoes, but no mines had been laid up to a
week ago for lack of submarine cable. The Spaniards then obtained
about eighty miles of cable from the telegraph company.
With the exception of the Castilla's battery there are no modern
guns about Manila.
The Spanish naval officer declared that he would sink at his moor
â  ings before he would surrender ftis ship, j About 25,000 native insurgents
are encamped outside of Manila ready to rush upon the Spaniards as
soon as the American fleet appears All the Americans except one are
now out of Manila, many taking refuge aboard of English merchant ships.
All the American ships except the Great Admiral have also got away.
The Europeans at Manila fear incendiarism and massacre when the
insurgents enter.

their own estimation.
Commander Everett's sue-
cessful bluff with his search-
light and his 6-pounders is
admitted to have been su-
perb. The Panama was well
armed with four 14-pounders
amidships, but it seems never
to have occurred to Captain
Quevado to make resistance.
Besides, the big Indiana was
only three miies away, ready
to take upon herself the task
of helping her consort if nec
essary. If Commander Ever
ett had been standing on the
bridge of the lowa or of the
fiagship his demand for im
mediate surrender under the
penalty of solid shot could
not have been more superbly
confident in tone. He won
by a rare combination of
skill, intrepidity and pure
impudence. Only three shots
were fired; but they were
enough. Lieutenant - Com -
mander Everett immediately
put Ensign Dixdn aboard his
big prize, the Indiana fur

men under command of
Cadet Falconer and the Man
grove steamed to the flag
ship, the New York. Admiral
Sampson ordered the Man
grove to take her prize to
Key West, and she arrived
here at 1 1 o'clock this morn
ing. We followed her in on
the Dewey.
Captain QueVado and his
crew of seventy-two men
and his passengers, who
number thirty-nine, are a
very disgusted lot of Span
iards. They were almost in
sight of Havana when the
Mangrove appeared, and now
they are held in Key West.
More than one hundred ref
ugees are added at one stroke
to the rapidly growing Span
ish colony accumulated on
board our several prizes of

The problem of feeding
and caring for these Spanish
hostages of ours was partly
solved to-day. A contract
has been given to feed them
and a large vacant two-story
house at Green and Simon
ton streets has been provided
for their use until the cases
of the several prizes captured
shall have been legally and
formally adjudicated.
Meanwhile the activity of |
our naval vessels is rapidly
accumulating a fine squadron !
of transports right here in ;
Key West, and it is not im- '
possible that part of our army j
of invasion may sail for Cuba
in ships taken from the en
emy and propelled under
power furnished by the en

the steamships Panama, Cat

used as transports, colliers or

RAILWAYS ESTABLISH
TRANSPORTATION RATES
Western Passenger Association Ex-
ecutive Committee Makes a
Recommendation.
CHICAGO, April 26.â The executive
committee of the Western Passenger
Association met to-day to establish a
rate to be charged the Government for
the transportation of troops. There was
a general feeling that the rate should
be 2 cents per mile, as that was what
was paid by the Government during the
civil war. However, the point was made
that the roads have been charging the
different States 1 cent per mile for
transporting th? State troops of their
national encampments and It was
thought that it might have an unpa
triotic appearance if the roads, now
that war has been declared, should
charge more than this for carrying the
troops to the front.
The matter was finally got around'
by the suggestion that 1 cent should
be charged for carrying the troops to
their various rendezvous and 2 cents
from there to the front. The general
meeting of the association, which will
be held to-morrow, will settle the ques
tion, the committee simply making a
recommendation.
BELLIGERENTS MAY
CUT THE CABLES
Mr. Balfour Intimates That Exigen
cies of War Would Justify
the Act.
LONDON, April Â»J.â ln the House of
Commons to-day Mr. Balfour, replying
to questions on the subject, said he
had reason to believe the Spanish Gov
ernment intended to limit itself to the
acquirement of auxiliary cruisers, like
those proposed to be employed by Ger
many in 1870. Respecting interference
with cables he pointed out that article
15 of the Paris convention of 1884 to
which Great Britain, Spain and the
United States were parties, provides
that belligerents in time of war were
free to act with regard to cables as if
the convention did not exist.
"I am not prepared." said Mr. Bal
four, "to deny that belligerents, on the
ground of military exigencies, would be
justified in interfering with the cables
between territory of an opposing party
and the rest of the world."
With reference to the alleged deten
tion of the channel mail steamer Ire
land, he said that^ so far as he knew
the vessel had not been sold, either to
America or Spain.

TO DEFRAY THE
COSTS OF WAR
Report of the Ways and
Means Committee of
the House.
Democratic Income Tax Propo
sition Defeated by a
Party Vote.
Secretary of the Treasury Authorized
to Issue and Sell $600,000,000
of Bonds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Rigps House,
Washington. April 26.
At the meeting of the Ways and
Means Committee to-day Mr. Bailey, on
behalf of the Democratic minority, of
fered the substitute agreed upon by
them authorizing the issue of $500,000,000
coin bonds. It provided for an income
tax of 3 per cent on incomes from all
sources in excess of $2000. State, county
and municipal bonds, however, were
excepted from its provision to meet the
unanimous decision of the Supreme
Court In this respect. The minority es
timates that such income would realize
$100,000,000. Coupltd with it was the
proposition to coin the silver seignior
age, which at present amounts to $42,
000,000. The substitute was voted down
by a strict party vote. No amendments
were offered to other provisions of the
bill, owing to the lack of time.
In its report the committee says that
the apparent cash balance in the treas
ury when the joint resolution appro
priating $50,000,000 for National defense
was passed was about $225,000,000. in
cluding the $100,000,000 redemption
fund, or $125,000,000 excluding that
fund.
But this balance was only apparent,
! inasmuch as $13,000,000 consisted of
: fractional silver, largely uncurrent
and minor coins, leaving only $112,000,
| 000. Of this amount $14,000,000 con-
I sisted of receipts from the sale of the
i Pacific railroads, held in the Treasury
for the payment of that amount of
' Pacific Itailroad bonds due January 1
I next, and $33,000,000 of the bank re
! demption fund held for the â¢-â <-ment
! of the notes of national banks failed
I and in liquidation or reducine circula
tion. Deducting these amounts and
I the actual available cash in the treas
| ury at that time belonging to the
i Government, exclusive of the green
1 back redemption fund, was only $65,
i 000 000.
Inasmuch as a working balance of
! about $40,000,000 is required to properly
carry on the operations of the Govern
ment, there remained only $25,000,000
belonging to the Government avail
; able in meeting the $50,000,000 appro
( priation. It will be necessary, to mejt
i all the expenditures under the $50,
000.000 appropriationâ all of which
; has been expended within a few weeksâ
; to use $25,000,000 of the bank redemp
tion fund, a part of v;hich must be re
: placed before the close of the present
i calendar year. -; " â¢ \ r
Inasmuch as : ' the- difficulties . with
Spain have plunged'the country into a
/war, whose magnitude aijd length can
j not now be intelligently fforetold, it .is
â¢ necessary that measures should imme
diately be taken to provide ways and
means to carry on naval and military,
operations on a scale and with a
promptness which will exert an impor
! tant influence in shortening the con
i flict.
As the expenses of. the preparations
! for defense that have been going on for
: nearly two months are a.? the rate of
. $25,000,000 per month, or $300,000,000 per

! ity to make loans for means to carry
jon naval and. military operations as
| will impress the great powers of Eur
i ope as well as Spain with the convic-
I tion that the people of the United
States are united in the determination
to prosecute the war on a scale and
with a vigor that will make prolonga
tion of hostilities useless.
With this object in view the commit
tee recommends the levying of internal
revenue taxes, either on articles of vol
untary consumption on objects that
will make such taxes fall mainly on
persons able to contribute to the na
tional defense, which will in the aggre
gate yield from $90,000,000 to $100,000,000
in addition to the present revenues.
The report then enumerates the dif
ferent articles to be taxed and the esti
mates heretofore published. It con
tinues:
These are all taxes on objects which
were assessed during or subsequent to tue
civil war, with one exception, and, there
fore, open up no new and untried system
of taxation. They are all internal reve
nue war taxes that can be collected by the
existing Internal revenue officials, slightly
Increased, with a small additional ex
pense, and with the minimum disturbance
of trade, although they are all taxes
which are unwelcome, and which it would
not have been necessary to impose if war
had been avoided.
While all of the additional taxes are
war taxes which would be naturally re
pealed, or modified when the necessities
of war and the payment of war expenses
have ceased, yet it is impossible now to
place a limit on them, not only for the
reason that no one can intelligently fore
cast the length of the war, but also for
the reason that war always brings a train
of extraordinary expenditures which do
not terminate with the close of actual
hostlities.
It is evident that it will be necessary,
in order to maintain the public credit, not
only to raise the additional revenue pro
vided by the accompanying bill, but also
to authorize the Secretary of the Treas
ury to borrow on the credit of the Gov
ernment from time to time as the public
necessities will require.
We have given, therefore, authority to
issue and sell not exceeding $500,000,000 of
ten-twenty three per cent coin bonds, to
be offered as a popular loan, believing, as
we do, that such a bond will be taken
from time to time by the masses of the
people. We have fixed the following years
as the period in which the bonds issued
may be redeemed at the pleasure of the
United States, not only because we re
gard it necessary to do this in order to
secure subscriptions at par for the latter
Issue, but also because the fact that the
one hundred million five per cent loan of
1901 and the laree four per cent loan of
1907 would inevitably be paid or refunded
by the Government before a three per
cent bond would be redeemed, makes a
bond that can be redeemed at the end of
ten years as desirable to issue as one
that can be redeemed at the end of five
years.
In view of the fact that it will be nec
essary in a few weeks, before the pro
posed war taxes can bring- results and
before the loan authorized can be placed,
to . provide means to meet the rapidly
augmenting war expenditures, authority
is given the Secretary of the Treasury to
temporarily borrow money, in no case ex
ceeding one year, by the issue of three
per cent certificates of indebtedness. It
is important that the Secretary of the
Treasury shall have this authority in any
emergency that may arise In the future.

INCREASED PAY
FOR REGULARS
Army Reorganization Bill
Signed by President
McKinley.
Offers a Greater Incentive to
Enlistment in Time
of War.
Sixty-One Thousand Men Will Here
after Constitute the Reg
ular Army.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Steps
will now be taken at once to put the
regular army on a war footing. Both
Houses of Congress to-day finally
agreed to the conference report on the
army reorganization bill, and it was
signed by the President and became a
law this afternoon. The amendments
adopted by the Senate yesterday were
all agreed to except that providing for
the assignment of retired officers to
duty in time of war.
The bill as it became a law organizes
the regular army on a war basis of
more than 61,000 enlisted men. It pro
vides for twenty-five additional majors
of infantry in the permanent organiza
tion; for fifty captains, fifty first and
second lieutenants of infantry and for
eighty-four second lieutenants of artil
lery.
Vacancies in the grades of captains
and first lieutenants will all be filled
by promotion, and the President will
have the appointment of 259 second
lieutenants. These appointments will
not all be made at once, but nomina
tions for many will be sent to the Sen
ate the latter part of this week.
Adjutant-General Corbin has tele
graphed to all of the recruiting officers
of the army directing them to begin en
listments at once to bring the entire
force up to a war footing. It is be
lieved by officials of the War Depart
ment that enlistments will be greatly
accelerated by the provision of the
army reorganization bill increasing the
pay of enlisted men of the axmy 20 per
cent in time of war.
As the President has approved of the
bill declaring that a state of war exists
between the United States and Spain,
that increase is now operative, and the
lowest pay of privates in the army is
increased from $13 a month to $15 60.
As the pay of non-commissioned of
ficers is increased in the same propor
tion, the incentive to enlistment will be
greater than before the passage of the
bill.
The increase in pay as well as pros
pects for active service, it is believed
by officers of the army, will have the
effect of attracting to the colors many
thousands of men throughout the coun
try who have served one or more terms
of enlistment in the regular army, and
who will take their places in the ranks
at once and will be much more efficient
than any new recruits who might be
obtained. '

Sampson's Fleet Takes Prizes,

Engage the Batteries

Call Office. Rlggs House,
Washington, April 25.
This was the sixth day of the Span
ish-American war, and not a drop of
blood shed as yet Our ships have taken
a number of prizes, some of which will
have to be given up, according to law
yers -who are thought to be well versed
In International law and comity. They
claim that the bill passed by Congress
yesterday and signed by the President
Is retroactive, and. therefore, as it vio
lates our constitution, may be disre
garded by the Admiralty Court, which
Is to try the several cases at Jackson
ville.
But however the court may decide as
to those prizes taken prior to the date
upon which Congress passed the dec
laration, there is no doubt that the
Spanish vessel Panama, captured by
the lighthouse tender Mangrove off Key
West last night is our prey. She is ours
de Jure and de facto. She is a rich prize,
a vessel of 2SOO tons, laden with a rich
cargo. What will be done with her
â  ngers. about forty Spanish ref
ugees, is now a question which is both
ering the Department of Justice. They
are scarcely to be regarded as prisoners
of war, and will probably be liberated
and allowed to depart hereafter the
best way they can. This will not be
difficult, as under the circumstances of
the President's procl-amation issued to
day Spanish subjects now in ports of
the United States may depart without
molestation at any time between this
date and May 21.
The French Embassador, who. in the
absence of Minister Polo, is acting for
the Spanish Government, was at the
State Department this afternoon, and
had an interview with Secre
tary Day. He explained that Spain
was anxious to arrange terms of ex
change, one captured vessel for an
other. It is understood he proposed
that a board, composed of representa
tives of the European powers, be ap
pointed to effect a method of exchange.
The Embassador of France and the
Secretary will have a further confer
ence to-morrow.
AWAITS NEWS
OF THE WAR
Hawaii Deeply Concerned
Over the Present
Struggle.
Citizens Suggest That President
Dole Declare the Islands
Neutral.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, April 19.â The steam
ship Miowera arrived* yesterday, three
days overdue, and again brought to
us the wearisome advice, "wait till the
next steamer." At the sound of the
signal whistles, as the sun was setting,
cyclists, pedestrians and hacks rushed
pellmell by the hundreds down to the
Pacific Mail in full expectation of hear
ing that once again the scions of the
sons of Semper Eadem had met the
descendants of the men who sailed in
the Spanish Armada in battle dash.
There was a sigh of relief from those
â who are well fixed in this world's goods
and of disappointment from those who
view only the romantic and picturesque
aspects of war when the indecisive
news filtered out. Hawaiians have been
arguing with one another as to the out
come of war, so far as the islands are
concerned, and have talked more
learned international law on the rights
of neutrals and belligerents than De
â¢ in this ever dreamed of, or Wharton
or De Maertens compiled. They have
gone so far as to make preparations
for a monster non-political mass meet-
Ing 1" urse our executive to proclaim
neutrality in advance of the preclama
tion of war, and even conservative men
of tlit annexation cause are cautiously
considering the advisability of petition-
Ing legislators to advise the President
to withdraw the annexation treaty
from the Senat<-, and to suggest in lieu
thereof a tripartite guarantee by the
United States. Great Britain and
France of th" neutrality and independ
ence of the Hawaiian Islands for ten
years.
If the United States Senate
has rejected the treaty this plan
will gather strength. The lin
gering uncertainty of Hawaii's con
dition is becoming irksome and gall
ing, for it disconcerts all plans for pro.
gress or development. Business is un
settled and "boomers" are thwarted;
government is hampered, and individ
uals are worried; legislation is timid
and politicians cantankerous It is
thought also that the pian suee-ested
Will be acceptable to the United IStS
Congress and more especially to the
two ancient treaty friends, the joint
European guarantors of Hawaii* in
dependence, Great Britain and France"
A very serious point in the construc
tion of Hawaii's constitution has been
quietly raised by foreign represent!
tives in connection with our naturali
zation of foreign subjects, and citizens"
and, consequently, of their right to
vote.
As originally drawn and submitted
to the constitutional convention article
74, qualifications of voters for repre
sentatives, read:
In order to be eligible to vote for reD
ircsentativpÃ a person shall:
Firstâ Be a male citizen of the republic
Thus far we have captured a half
dozen of Snain's merchant vessels, and
up to date she has taken none of ours,
but there are indications that the Span
iards will make a business of priva
teering, notwithstanding their profes- i
sions, and that their operations on the
sea, especially in the Pacific, will
amount to piracy. This information i
] reached the Navy Department to-day !
! and Admiral Miller of the Pacific
squadron, and Admiral Dewey of the ;
Asiatic squadron, have been apprised
of Spain's intention to make a specialty
of piracy on the Pacific.
"This is only mercenary warfare. 'â¢
| said a disgusted Congressman to-day,
; when he learned at the Navy Depart- ;
I ment that Sampson's fleet had not yet :
fired a shot at Havana's batteries. "Let |
us have a little Spanish blood to atone i
j for the murder of the Maine's sailor?;."
The "peaceful" blockade of Havana
is not satisfactory to the statesmen on
the hill. They want gore. The gen
eral impression in Washington among
these best informed and who have a
technical knowledge of naval matters,
is that two battles royal will result, one
before Havana and the other in the far
away Pacific. It is the belief in naval
circles that the first news of a battle
will be from the Philippine Islands and
that within a week word will have been
received that Manila has been taken
by Admiral Dewey's fleet.
It was pointed out in official circles
that although no great strategical ad
vantage would accrue to us from the
possession of the Philippine Islands,
they were nevertheless greater in area
and more valuable in wealth and na
tural resources than Cuba or Porto
Rico and their loss to Spain would be
a distinct gain for the United States.
The permanent occupation and tenure
by the United States of any of Spain's
colonies is not contemplated, for it is
the policy of the administration to in
duce the friendship of ah nations by
its insistence that the war was not ac
tuated by selfish or ulterior purposes
on our part and that we have no de
sire for the acquisition of territory re
mote from our own shores. Neverthe
less the Philippines could be held for
"ransom," ransom enough to pay for
the c<-..st of the war with Spain and the
loss of our battleship Maine.
and if a citizen naturalized prior to Janu
ary 17, 1593, possessed at such time of the
privilege of voting for representatives.
Now, Mr. Hatch, Minister at Wash
ington, carried an amendment to the
effect that if so naturalized they r"uÂ«=t
be "natives of a country having or hav
| ing had treaty relations with Hawaii "
j The intention of this amendment was
to debar Chinese from becoming natur
alized and possessing the franchise for
! at that date nearly 1000 Chinese had
i beeomenaturalized. Further, they must
j have taken the oath set forth 'in the
constitution. It is now contended that
as there is no er-untry having a treaty
with Hawaii in which there is the
slightest reference made to naturaliza
tion, all naturalizations already grant
ed and all papers of denization
with citizens' rights are null and void
jso far as the allegiance due to the
country of origin is concerned. If the
Government should feel inclined to ac
cept this ruling it can by disfranchis
ing the alien voters destroy at the polls
nine-tenths of its political opponents of
foreign birth.
To add to the excitement the steam
ship Peru was off port a little after 11
â  o'clock last night, but it was long be
fore any news came on shore, as she
cr-uld not come into the harbor until
this morning. In the meantime the ex
: citement had increased by the issu
i ance of "extras" by the evening papers
but cool judgment showed that it was
i merely whetting the appetite for the
| "news by the next steamer."
The main anxiety, enthusiasm and
curiosity centers around a telegram re
ceived by J. B. Atherton to the purport
I that Bacon's amendment was to be
i taken up by the Senate, as a test vote'
as well as the joint resolution, and
further, that there were sufficient votes
i to defeat the amendment and to carry
i the resolution. This news created a
sensation among the annexationists
and although all saloons were closed at
111 o'clock, carriages were running
| around all night with excited gossipers.
j It is learned this morning on the
| highest authority that the executive
: will take no action pending the receipt
| of official news from Washington

Queen's proclamation of neutrality in
the war between Spain and the United
States had been signed. The dispatch
adds that the proclamation is similar
to those issued on former occasions, but
in addition directs special attention to
the three rules of the treaty ct Wash
ington of May S, 1871. article 6 of which
will be obserwl towar both countries.
The three rules to which Lord Salis
bury directs special attention are of ex
ceptional moment just at present, ow
ing to the presence in British ports of
several warships, including the Somers
and Albany, intended for the United
States Navy. The three rules are as fol
lows:
"A neutral Government Is bound, first,
to use diligence to prevent the fitting out,
arming or equipping, within its jurisdic
tion of any vessel which it has reasona
ble grounds to believe is intended 10
cruise or carry on war with a power with
which it is at peace, and also to use iikÂ»
diligence to prevent the departure from its
jurisdiction of any vessel Intended to
cruise or carry on -;dr as above, such
vessel haying been specially adapted, in
whole or in part, within such jurisdicrion,
to warlike use.
"Secondâ Not to permit or to suffe-
Lighthouse Tender Mangrove, the Little Ship That Caught the Panama.
either belligerent to mane use of its ports
or waters as the base of naval operations
against the other, or for the purpose of
renewal or augmentation of military sup
p.aes or arms, or the recruitment or m;:i.
"Thirdâ To exercise due diligence in Its
own porta and waters, and, as to all par
sons within its jurisdiction, to prevent
any violation of the foregoing obliga
tions and duties."
The second rule doubtless accounts
for the enforced departure of the
United States lleet at Hongkong. The
first rule appears to apply directly to
several ships purchased by the United
States abroad, and now hurrying to
completion in British yards. Most im
portant of these is the fine cruiser Al
bany, formerly the Admiral Abrouall,
of the Brazilian navy. From the strict
rule adopted in stopping the torpedo
boat Somers and the mail steamer Ire
land, as reported by press dispatches,
it is believed the rule against the de
parture of warships will be given a
very rigid construction.
Doubt is expressed here as to the
report current in London that the
proclamation was due to an under
standing between the United States
and Great Britain, in order that other
countries might be urged to adopt a
similar attitude of neutrality. It is
hardly believed the United States
would urge a proclamation, the first ef
fect of which is to tie up American
warships nearing completion in Brit
ish yards.
It was stated in high diplomatic
quarters to-day that no further doubt
existed as to the attitude of Portugal
in maintaining neutrality. This is re
garded as specially important at this
time, owing to the fact that the Cape
Verde Islands, the Azores and the Ma
deiras belong to Portugal. All of these
groups have fine harbors and coaling
facilities, and are so located as to be of
vital service to the Spanish navy In
case their use were not barred by Por
tugal's neutrality.
The neutrality of Portugal will pre
vent a longer use of these islands as
a base of operations for the Spanish
ships, (r even a stopping place for
them. They will be forced to go to one
of their own ports, the Canaries prob
ably being the most advantageous
peint, now that Capr> Verde and other
Portuguese islands are closed to them.
The reports that Germany would not
issue a proclamation of neutrality, in
order to leave her hands free for inter
vention if it seems c" sirable, cannot be
confirmed in diplomatic circles here.
On the other hand, there is every indi
catic-n that Germany will observe strict
neutrality so long as German ships and
German commerce are unmolested dur
ing the progress of the war. If, how
ever, German interests suffer by search
and seizure on the high seas, then it is
not so certain a strict neutrality will
be continued.
It is held among leading diplomats
that no question can be raised as to
the status of Senor Polo at Toronto.
He is said to be a private citizen, hav
ing the right of domicile in a neutral
country. __ _____________

LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER EVERETT.
Career of the Naval Officer Whose Little Craft Captured
the Panama.
Lieutenant Commander William H. Everett is a true type of American
manhood. Born in Connecticut, he was at an early age left an orphan by
the death of his father, who came to California in 1849, and died in Tuol
umne County. The youne: man. left to his own resources, worked his way
through the schools of New Haven, and late in the fifties was appointed
by Governor English of Connecticut a cadet at Annapolis. He graduated
with honors and has seen much sea life.
In August, 1897, he was appointed commander of the U. S. S. Michi
gan, stationed on Lake Erie, but on April 5 he requested to be transferred
to active duty, and on the 13th took command of the Mangrove. He at
once has made for himself a name that will be honored in history.
Lieutenant-Commandor Everett is a nephew of S. L. Everett, editor of
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron of this city.
TWO BRIGADES
OF INFANTRY
Troops at Chickamauga
to Be Formed Into
a Division.
Colonel Van Horn of the Eighth
Regiment Put In Com
mand.
Field Maneuver* Will Begin at the
CÂ«mp Grounds ty Next
Week.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICKAMAUGA PARK, April 26.â
General field orders directing the for-
I mation of the United States infantry
regiments here into a division of two
; brigades were issued to Â»'iy by Major
1 General Brooke. Colonel James -*. Van
Horn of the Eighth Infantry is rut in
i command of the division, he being the
ranking senior officer. The first brig
ade is composed of the Seventh, Eighth,
! Twelfth and Twenty-fifth infantries,
with Colonel Andrew S. Burt of the
! Twenty-fifth in command. The sec
â  ond brigade, according to the general
! order, is made up of the Second and
i Twenty-fourth Infantry, "and such
j other infantry as may arrive here."
Plans in regard to the formation of
the second brigade were knocked awry
i this evening by the definite announce
j ment that the order for the First Regi
! ment. from the Presidio and Benicia
; Barracks, Cal., to proceed to Chicka*
' mauga, had been countermanded, and
' that the regiment had gone into camp
jat New Orleans. This also, for the
j time being, at least, disposed of the
! plan of the organization of the infan
! try into three brigades of three regi-
m ents each. As it stands now, the Six
teenth, from Forts Sherman, Spokane
and Boise Barracks, is the only regi
ment which Major-General- Brooke is
reasonably certain of having incorpor
! ated in his army. Detached officers of
i that regiment have already reported
j for duty here.
The Eighteenth and Nineteenth regi
ments frc-m Forts Bliss and Sam Hous
ton, and the latter from Forts Brady
and Wayne, it is thought, however,
; may have gone to Chickamauga, in
! which case three brigades of three regi
ments each will be formed.
As the second brigade now stands,
Colonel J. C. Bates of the Second Reg
iment is in command. Battery X of
the First, from Texas, and Batteries C
and F of the Third, from San Fran
ciscrr, arrived to-day. This makes
ten batteries in camp and completes
the artillery concentration here. It is
the intention to organize them into
two battalions c-f five batteries each,
with Majors Lancaster and Dillenback
as commanders.
The Second Regiment of infantry,
from Forts Keogh and Harrison, Mont.,
and Fort Yates, N. D., 469 men and 22
i officers, in command of Cc-lonel J. C.
Bates, which arrived last night, went
into camp near the Twenty-fourth, in
the Lafayette road. The cavalry ar
1 rivals consist of Troop A of the
â  Third, from Fort Huachuca, Ariz., and
Troops E and X o-f the Second, from
Fort Wingate.
Field orders were issued for the rigid
policing: of the camp. Daily inspections
of the camps will be made and every
sanitary precaution taken. It is quite
probable that the entire body of troops
located here will be vaccinated.
By next week the field maneuvers of
the army will begin.

KEEPING
BLOCKADE
BY NIGHT
Cruise of a Call Man
Outside of Havana
HarboPo
First Two Prisoners of War
Taken by the Cruiser Cin
cinnati and One Is
Paroled.
On board the United States torpedo
boat Porter, with the blockading
squadron, off Havana, via Key West.
Fla., April 26.â Two Spanish soldiers in
blue uniforms with hairline stripes of
white and straw hats, which Bianco's
men wear In the field, were prisoners
to-day on board the flagship New York.
One was a lieutenant. They were In a
boat going from Matanzas to a neigh
boring port, where the lieutenant
wanted to see his baby boy, that was
born while he was in the field. The
Cincinnati, which was lying off Matan
zas, picked up the boat and men.
They were sent to the flagship, the
first actual prisoners of war.
They were duly astonished by the
manual exercises 'drill, which they
i watched with interest, after they had
1 been told by an Interpreter that they
j were not to be hanged at the yardarm
immediately, as they seemed to expect.
I The lieutenant was paroled and set
ashore In the Algonquin, which landed
him this afternoon at a small fort a
i few miles east of Havana.
The flagship this morning lay ten
miles east of Morro Castle, where news
of the declaration of war was received
with keen satisfaction by all.
Surprise and laughter greeted the
news that the Mangrove had cap
tured the Panama, the rich prize for
which the battle-ships and torpedo-
I boats have been scouring the straits
for days.
The Porter last night did picket duty
1 inside and outside the cruisers and bat
tleships. I was a member of the Por
| ter's crew last night, and to-day be
, cause of my knowledge of the coast,
I which Captain Fremont wished to ex
amine.
It is the Porter and other vessels of
her class which make the blockade
; unequaled in point of efficiency and
; picturesqueness in the history of war.
â  By day the torpedo boats hunt before
and around the cruisers. By night,
with lights out, they cruise inshore
and outside the big warships, and
friend, foe and stranger alike must
prove their identity an mission before
' the black witches allow them to pro
| ceed.
If he be Spanish he is surely lost. He
cannot enter or leave Havana in any
case unless he be so small as to be of
no attraction for prize hunters. If he
be big ht is more easily seen and more
eagerly hunted.
Tha Porter lay off Morro Castle for
a time last night while the bi â¢ search
light on the castle swept sky and sea
; in vain effort to locate the ships of
j the enemy. The low-lying torpedo-boat
I was unnoticed, being so far off that the
! light even when it fell across her gave
I but few clews, if any, to the men at the
' guns ashore. Then, cruising westward
' for ten or fifteen miles, she returned,
running close under the batteries, but
â  still undetected. One of the warships
: lying off Havana, making out a black
! object between itself ana the shore,
showed the fle?t signal to determine
: whether the flying craft were friend or
j enemy. The Porter burned the fleet
j signal in answer. Delay in answering
would have been followed by a terrific
fire from the warship's secondary bat
tery.
From low cruising ppeed the Porter
suddenly increased to twenty knots to
go flying after a sail creeping: along the
land west of . orro. It proved to be a
small sloop ard the chase was aban
doned. Smoke later betrayed the pres
ence ' a small gunboat which had
moved out of Havana and was steam
ing westward still under the guns of
; Santa Clam battery. It was identified
ias the Plnzon or one of that class,
1 which for.. *rly used to run outside
Motto for gTiar'! duty at night, return
ing to the .arbor at dawn.
Once Captain Fremont of the Porter
had sized up the Spaniard he smiled,
and after sweeping the seaward horizon
with his glasses darted off to the De
troit and the converted yacht Hawk
with the news. The cruiser and the
Destroyer headed for the westernmost
end of the Vedado batteries, hoping to
cut off the gunboat before it could re
turn to the harbor, but the Spaniard
had put back as soon as the Porter
started seaward, and the night hunt
was fruitless. Away to the eastward
went the Porter, ignoring the Morro's
searchlight, which was sweeping the
sea and sky unceasingly.
Then at 11 o'clock the searchlight and
electric lights on the Porter were ex
tinguished, and only a faint patch of
soft radiance from the houses marked
the beleagured city of Havana. The
torpedo-boat ran close under the bat
teries and still to the eastward.
The outline of a big ship was seen,
dimly aga'nst the line to seaward
seemingly too far in shore to be one
of the fleet. Again the Porter's speed
jumped from ten to twenty knots, as
swinging wide of the stranger she
dodged his watch forward and sh Â»t
down upon him from the rear.
No sign was r-ade by the Porter un
til sho was far inside the distance at
which guns couV have been directed
at her. Then she showed the fleet
signal. Had the answer been any but
the right one the big ship was doomed.
In a second the proper signal burned at
the masthead in reply.
It was one of the cruisers, and the
Porter faded away in the darkness
and resumed her to the east
ward, sweeping close under the â¢ast
and far out to sea alternately, and
overlooking nothing bigger than n sea
bird till the sun like a t>ig gold piece
on edge rose out of the sea and the
night patrol was over.
WEST POINT GRADUATES
THE CLASS OF '98.
HIGHLAND FALLS. N. T.. April 26.
â West Point at 2 o'clock to-day gradu
ated the clasr of IS9B. The stern re
quirements of the service permitted
nothin but short ceremonies. The de
livery of the diplomas was made by
Colonel H. C. Ernest, superintendent of
the academy, and the addresses to the
class by Colorel P. S. Michie, profes
sor of natural and experimental phil
osophy.
This Is the first time since 1861 that
any class has been graduated before the
end of the academic year. There was
none of the many pleasant features
which usually attend the graduating
class, but there were fifty-live ha-^v
young men. T sgÃffiÃ
The examination, usually held in
June, will probably not be held until
later, as it may become necessary to
graduate the second class soon. If this
becomes necessary, that examination;
and graduation may not take place be
fore July or August. Most of the new
officers will be assigned to the two
new artillery regiments and the rest di
vided among the volunteers.
The following is the standing of the
first ten men in order of general merit:
Frank Boggs, Pennsylvania; C. Smith,

MASSING OF
WARRIORS AT
CHICKAMAUGA
Vast Bivouac on the Scene
of One of the World's
Greatest Battles.
Stirring Events of the Sixties Re
called by the Mobilization of
Troops to Conquer
Spain.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., April 26.-
Every veteran of the Civil War who
has passed through Chlckamauga Park
within the weekâ and there are many
who haye â has been thrilled with pat
riotism. Not only have recollections
cf the bloody IPth and 20th of Septem
ber, lSfiS, been brought vividly before
him, but the glint of the sunshine, upon
hundreds, almost thousands, of white
tents through the Interstices in the
foliage of the trees and the echoing
rotes of the bugle have thrilled him
anew with martial ardor, such as he
has not experienced sine.;' the day he
lapt saw this memorable field- Here
and there, dotting the open meadows
and surrounded, at times, by trees that
grow exactly where trees grew on the
days of the battle, are the camps of
the United States regulars. Adown
the magnificent driveways which
thread the grand park to its innermost
points, where once only trails or sur
face roads had place, the galloping of
the mounted orderly's horse, or the
ceaseless footfalls of the sentry on
guard, fall upon his ear as they did
In the days when first he saw this
place.
Tourists by the thousands are flock
ing into Chattanooga, and Chicka
mauga is the mecca of their pilgrim
age. The massing of the cavalry and
light artillery there assumed such
great proportions that it required a
day, before the week was out, to drive
about the park and see the various
camps. The roadways were thronged
every day with cavalry trains coming
in, followed by their lumbering wagons
and citizen teamsters of every race and
color. Ceaseless lines of quaint equip
ages, driven by negroes as dark as
night and carrying a mixed collection
of the highest colored society of Ten
nesse, follow the lien of march from
the depots in Chattannooga all the way
to the most remote of all the camps,
that of the Twenty-fifth Infantry, full>
fourteen miles from the city.
The scenes at the depots in town
may well be imagined. The colored
population, for lack of better employ
ment, turned out en masse the day be
fore the first troops arrived and has
remained turned out ever since. The
mobilization of these two arms of the
service could not be properly accom
plished without the assistance of thirty
or forty thousand of them, according
to their opinion. The scenes at Chat
tanooga stations, however, differed lit
tle from that witnessed at every town
through which troops have passed, but
at the Military Park there was enousn
that was unusual to interest half the
population of the city from dawn un
til dark.
The tourist who has conceived a men.
tal picture of the park, according to
descriptions that have been published
about it, or who attempts to see it by
following 1 the guidebook, will be disap
pointed. It is the largr-st. park in the
world, except Â«-ne, and covers so many
miles square that it is a good day's
drive to sec it nil and see it properly.
Its monuments, its beautiful drives, its
picturesque groves and its wooded
hills, its shaded brooks of purest wat
erâall these in times of peace appeal to
the eye of the visitor, but at this time
all interest centers in the military en
campments.
Chiekamauga Park Is a succession of
meadows, rolling land and wooded
knolls. It is Impossible to get a bir* 1*;-â¢1 *;
â¢ c view of it entire from any point, fo.
which reason no panoramic photo
graphs nf it have been made. The
camps of the troops are in the open
places, separated by acres and acres
of woodland, which has been preserved
In exactly the same condition, except
for the ravages of time, as it was in
1883. Hence It is impossible to see any
one great military bivouac at Chicka
mauga. notwithstanding the fact that
a great army is mobilized there.
A general view of the encampment of
the Twenty-fifth Infantry, the first
troop to arrive, gives a correct idea of
the various and numerous camps
throughout the park. Colonel A. S.
Burt, who i.s in command of the Twen
ty-fifth, has selected a picturesque
spot for his command, and is at home
to all visitors. I photographed him at
his quarters a few days ago, and at the
same time made a number of pictures,
through his kind permission. One of
them, a full portrait of Corporal Dan
iels of E Company, illustrates the type
of colored soldier enlisted in Uncle
Fam's service. That they are a very
d iff. rent sort of colored man from the
vorthless, lazy throng that exists in
this part <-f the South was made mani
fest immediately upon their arrival
here, and, notwithstanding the fact
that a negro has no standing whatever
in this community, they have com
manded the respect and admiration of
every one by their soldierly bearing.
Their village of tents is neat to a de
gree. There is absolutely no refuse in
Its streets, none in its fragile houses.
The cook tents and company messes
are sweet and savory, and it is an ad
mitted fact that the colored troops live
fur better than the whites, although
the rations issued for them are the
same. They are the best cooks and de
light in providing appetizing dishes,
which, even if made from ordinary ma
terials, are greatly relished.
â¢ The arrival of the cavatry at the park
on Thursday was the event of the
campaign thus far in Chickamauga.
The Sixth, comprising four troops from
Fort Myer, arrived Wednesday even
ing at Chattanooga and remained in
the cars until morning. Then the
trains were run out to the park and
unloaded there. There is a little de
pot at the beginning of the main park
drive, built to accommodate passen
gers who go out by train, but -wholly
inadequate for the handling of the vast
bodies of troops that are expected there
â within the month. The horses of the
cavalry were first unloaded. Gang
ways of rough planks had been con-
Ftrueted and placed at the doors of
the stockcars, as far as the length of
the platform would permit. But four
cars could be handled at a time.. The
horses, seemingly drilled for the work,
made no offer to bolt from the cars
â¢when the doors were opened, but await
ed orders like soldiers, and came down
the gangways with a precision and
care that was remarked by all who
saw them. In half an hour there were
T>oo superb horses staked out on picket
lines In the level valley opposite the
railway station.
The men, meanwhile, had not been
idle. With that promptness which
characterizes everything the cavalry
does their equipments had been car
ried from the train and placed on the
ground in as perfect order as if for in
spection at "stables" in their post at
home. Great lumbering army wagons,
with their bowed hoops and whit? tar
paulin covers, were debarked from flat
cars, piled high with army parapherna
lia, to be almost immediately picked
up by teams of sturdy Government
mules and wheeled off toward the site
selected for the cavalry camping
grounds, on Lexington road, almost in
the center of the park.
The cavalry is ready to move at a
moment's notice, and so far as rations
and forage are concerned would not be
at all hampered by sudden marching
orders, for they brought with them
supplies and rations for from thirty to
thirty-five days.
The cavalry encampment as inaugur
ated on Thursday is located about ft
mile and a half from the infantry bi
vouac. The Third Cavalry from Jef
ferson Barracks were the first of all
the troops t j arrive at Chattanooga
after marching orders had been given
nut. with the single exception of th<>
Twenty-fifth Infantry, which was on
the field several days before the gen.
ernl order was issued.
The Third was ordered to march from
Chattanooga to the camp site selected
for them by Major Dillenbeck, and ar
rived at the park about noon Thurs
day. The command numbered about
500 men. who. together with their bag
gage and supply trains, made a for
midable looking caravan. Throngs of
carriages followed this detachment
from the city and hack drivers reaped
a harvest such as they have not had in
years.
When the troops from Fort Riley,

Hydraulic Mine in

NEVADA CITY, April 26.â A nusrget
hunting expedition extraordinary was
the principal number on to-day's pro
gramme for the entertainment of the
Native Sons who are here to attend
the session of the Grand Parlor. In-
cidental to this interesting and practi
cal illustration of the methods employ
ed in wrestinp" the aboriginal Colonel
Mazuma from Mother Earth, the visi
tors were treated to some applied the
ories as to the best means of mountain
traveling. . "For this day only." as the
show bills have it, the "Teat Malakoff
hydraulic i..lne was thrown open for
the inspection of all who cared to see
it.
The mine, which is one of the largest
of the kind. in the world, is situated in
the heart of the mountains, near the
little village of North Bloomfield, and
fifteen miles from Nevada City. The
road to the mine pitches up and down
the precipitous sides of the mountains
in a manner calculated to make the
hair of a novice stand on end.
Occasionally the road skirts along the
edge of a precipice or whisks around
the shoulder of a great cliff, seemingly
for the sole purpose of giving the stage
drivers an opportunity to show how
easy it is to knock pebbles into the
seemingly bottomless abyss with the
rear wheel of the coach.
If to all this is added the fact that
almost every mile of the road has its
history of a stage robbery or murder, a
fair understanding can be had of the
effect of the fifteen-mile drive on the
minds of a majority of the native sons.
In this connection there is a story
going the rounds to-night that has for
a central figure Mark Devine, who,
when at home, is the valued and valu
able assistant of Chief Wharh'nger Root
on the San Francisco water front. It
seems, so the story goes, that Devine
is a trifle nervous and did not wholly
approve of the spectacular efforts of
the driver of the conveyance in which
he and a party of friends were riding.
Being of a retiring disposition he said
nothing, but at the first convenient op
portunity he expressed a desire to walk
over a particularly dangerous piece of
road. In order, as he said, to lighten
the load and save the horses. Devine
trudged alorg behind the team for per
haps a hundred - ards or so, when he
was suddenly confronted by the follow
ing inscription, painted in bold letters
on the face of a huge boulder that
jutted out from the mountain side, just
above th; road:
Sacred to the Memory of
S. GAVIOLLOTI.
Murdered on This Spot,
September 12, 1891.
The driver of the vehicle appreciat
ing the situation laid on the whip and
in a moment had swung around a turn
in the road and was out of sight.
Then ensued what is said Xi have
been one of .he prettiest races ever
witnessed in Nevada County. Down the
mountain side went the coach at a
break-neck gallop, and after it raced
Devine, with his hat in his hand and
his heart in his mouth.
When he finally caught up he took
his seat in the coach, and during the
balance of the journey said never a
word when the driver sought to make
new wheel marks along the outer edge
of the bit of a shelf that does Â«.uty for
a road. It Is only fai to Devine to say
that he brands the story as an inven
tion emanating from his fun-loving
companions.
Arriving at the mine the Natives
were escorted to the workings and in
itiated into the mysteries of sluices,
monitors, flumes, pipe lines, impound
ing dams, pay dirt, bedrock and a thou
sand and one things that are a sealed
book to the ordinary mortal, who gains
an occasional minted coin by the sweat
o-f his brow at an, office desk. The ar
rival of the visitors, who numbered
several hundred, was signalized by the
firing of twenty heaw charges of giant
powder. Two hours later, when all of
the sight-seers had been herded in a
place of safety on a high bluff over
looking the workings, 200 blasts were
set off in the bottom of the huge pit.
After the inspection of the mine had
been completed the visitors were con
ducted to a shady grove on the moun
tain side, above North Bloomfield,
where they were treated to a typical
miners' dinner, served on long tables
in the open air. The repast consisted
of stewed chicken, meats and vege
tables, together with unlimited quan
tities of all kinds of drinkables.
After the repast the visitors bade
good-by to their entertainers and
started on the return trip, reaching this
city late in the afternoon. The day's
enjoyment was somewhat marred by
a distressing accident, caused by the
incompetence of a driver, and which
resulted in bodily injury to three mem
bers of the junketing expedition. While
making a sharp turn on the road about
seven miles out of this city a stage
carrying a party of twelve Native Sons
was overturned. H. D. Cushing of
Oakland had his arm broken by the
fall. A. J. Turner of Stockton sustained
an Injury of the hip and Rod W.
Church of Oakland received several se
vere bruises about the body.

NICARAGUA AND
COSTA RICA ON
THE EVE OF WAR
Seem Determined to Decide
Their Differences by an
Appeal to Arms.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, April 26. â War seems inevitable between Nicaragua and
Costa Rica. Despite the mediation of sister republics, the two coun
tries seem determined to decide the issues between them by an appeal to
arms.
President Rafael Iglesias, accompanied by sixty officers, embarked
at Puntas Arenas to-day on the national guardboat Poas for the Nicara
guan frontier, where he will place himself at the head of a large for-ce
of troops and commence operations against General Zelaya, President
of Nicaragua, immediately.
Minister Lainfesta has failed in his efforts to bring about a settle
ment of the trouble.
El Comercio, the semi-official organ of President Zelaya, under the
caption, "There Is No Peace," says:
"Notwithstanding persistent rumors circulated within the last few
days, as the result of the efforts of Minister Lainfesta, we are in a po
sition to assert that such reports are absolutely unfounded, and that
war is now more probable than ever.
"War at the present time amounts to a necessity, as no other step
can put an end to this already too long drawn out question. President
Iglesias, with his well-known hostility toward us, has provoked the in
dignation of the Niearaguan people, who will no longer bear the ag
gressions of their restless and ambitious neighbor."
In conclusion, El Comercio says:
"There is no peace; there cannot nor should there be peace."
who arrived to-day on the steamer
Edith. Among them are S. J. Vandrey
and Peter Williams of Douglas, Wyom
ing. Their party of five men lost com
plete outfits under the avalanche and
expect never to see them again, de
claring that the tremendous weight
'crushed and destroyed their food sup
plies.
Vandrey says that without doubt fif
teen or twenty more bodies will be dis
covered in the avalanche's pathway
when summer comes. According to
his story no digging has been done for
a distance of a hundred yards on ac
count of the extreme depth of the snow,
which is piled over forty feet high. In
any community where organized gov
ernment exists this snow would be re
moved, vast, as the work might be, and
the bodies taken out. In Alaska such
a course is impossible, volunteer shov
elers having tired of digging and re
turned to their labors.
Vandrey talked with several men
who know that their partners were
killed, though their bodies have not
been found.
Unfortunately Vandrey took no ac
count of the missing men's names. He
could not continue his 'nurney, believ
ing that so many victims remained un
discovered in their frozen shrouds, and,
accordingly, returns to Wyoming for
good.
Another of the Edith's passengers
started from Portland last summer, but
got no further than Tagish Lake. Win
tering there consumed all his provis
ions.
On Sunday the Edith went ashore
near Comox while proceeding thither
for coal. After remaining fast for
twenty-four hours she succeeded in
backing off. The damage is not ser
ious. Just as she <?ot off the tug Mamie
of Vancouver ran on a rocky ledge in
the same vicinity and was still fast
when the Edith left. It was then dark
and impossible to tell how badly the
tug was damaged. The Edith has been
tied up, light Alaska business making
it unprofitable to start her north at the
present.

Special Dlsoatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 26.â A telegram
from Wichita, Kans., to the Herald
says tbat Colonel Boler has received a
telegram from W. J. Bryan, asking his
advice as to offering his services as a
private soldier. Colonel Boler is an
old-time friend of Mr. Bryan. The
Democratic leader said he was fearful
this volunteering might be looked upon
as the act of a demagogue, and hence
he asked Colonel Boler's judgment on
that point. The colonel says that Mr.
Bryan had before written him ex
pressing his disapproval of the "un
seemly scramble" for military office ex
hibited from every quarter.
Mr. Bryan left Lincoln this afternoon
for Rock Island, 111., where he will de

LOCATING THE

Two Spanish Men-of-War
Believed to Be Cruising
Near Our Shores.
War Department Formulates a
Plan for Conducting the
Military Operations on
Cuban Soil.
QUEENSTOWN, April 2<s.â The
"White Star line steamer Ma
jestic, from New York to Liver
pool, arrived here at 12:18 this
morning. Passengers who land
ed here say that at midnight on
Saturday, when about 1700 miles
west of Queenstown, the Majestic
passed a cruiser and three tor
pedo bound west, and It is pre
sumed that they were Spanish
vessels.
These reports seem to tally
with other advices that the
Spanish battle - ship Pelayo,
which sailed ostensibly for St.
Vincent, was really dispatched
with torpedo - boats for the
American coast.
NEW YORK, April 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Au
thoritative information has reached
here that Spain, anticipating the issu
ance of a neutrality proclamation by
France, has removed the battleship
Numancia from Toulon to Ca thagena.
The vessel was towed from Toulon yes
terday and it is understood that every
effort will be made by the Spaniards to
put her into condition for service as
promptly as possible.
There is considerable speculation in
naval circles as to the whereabouts of
the battleship Pelayo and the armored
cruiser Carlos V. The Pelayo left Ca
diz on J- >ril 17, nine ua-s ago, ostensi
bly for Cape Verde Islands and the
Carlos V sailed from Ferrol on April
20, six days ago, her destinat on being
officially announced as Cadiz.
Officials say that if the Pelayo were
bound for Cape Verde Islands she
should have reached her destination
several days ago. It is admitted to be
possible that the two ships may have
met and are now on a cruise against
American ship] ing.
The Columbia and Minneapolis, which
are swifter than either of the Spanish
vessels, are now at sea looking for any
of the enemy's warships or auxiliary
cruisers, and should a superior force be
sighted they will at once dash for the
nearest port, and the Hying squadron
will be sent to give battle to the enemy.
No official advices have yet been re
ceived of the departure of the Spanish
fleet from St. Vincent. Official infor
mation was received some days ago
that Spain's second torpedo fleet was
about to sail from Cadiz, but the of
ficials are unable to say whither it has
gone.
The naval plan of campaign against
Cuba contemplates a ruse de guerre
when the proper time arrives for the
seizure of the port desired as a base of
operations against Havana.
While several men-of-war will make
a demonstration against Havana or an
other port, a strong fleet of wars'iips
will be engaged in shelling: the point
picked out as the proper base, and a
force of 2000 marines and bluejackets
will be landed under their fire.
It is expected that the insurgents will
co-operate with the navy, and it is not
believed in naval circles that much
trouble will be experienced in the cap
ture of the port.
While the navy has practically made
all necessary preparations, the army is
disposed to wait until fall before com
mencing active operations. It is ad
mitted in all circles that it is neces
sary to secure a base through which
supplies can be sent to the Insurgents,
and once it has been occupied by
American marines it will be necessary
to send an army of 15,000, as stated in
the Herald, to hold It against any
force which General Blanco may send
against it.
. So far as any combined operations on
the part of the army and navy are con
cerned, however, nothing has yet been
determined. It is the expectation of
the authorities that the Cubans will
drive the Spanish troops Into Havana
and other points and will be able to
take such ports as axe not strongly gar
risoned.
According to advices received here,
General Blanco has already begun the
abandonment of the trocha and is col
lecting his troops in Havana, where he
will await the arrival of relief expected
to be brought by the Spanish fleet.
Naval authorities are extremely
anxious that the army shall at once
begin offensive operations by sending
a formidable fnrre to Cuba, and then,
with the aid of the insurgents, making
an attack on Hbviw while the navy
co-operates by attacking the city from
the sea.
President McKinley. Secretary Al
ger, Major-General Miles, Adjutant-
General Corbin and Brigadier-General
Shafter. who has been selected for the
command of 15.000 troops to be landed
in Cuba, will hold a conference to-mor
row. Final arrangements will then be
perfected for the conduct of the pro
posed plan.
As at present determined upon, it is
understood that the military will be
transported to the Cuban base in ves
sels convoyed b- men-of-war and will
aid the marines in fortifying it. Once
this has been accomplished it will be
an easy matter to ship into the in
terior an ample quantity of supplies of
all kinds for the use of the Cuban in
surgents.
When this work has been completed
it is highly probable, as the Herald
forecasted this morning, that the arm
ored ships of the North Atlantic squad
ron will be relieved from blockading
duty and will join the armored ships
of Commodore Schley's fleet. The com
bined force will then be ready to give
battle to the Spanish fleet, which will
by that time, it is expected, have been
for some days out from Cape Verde
Islands.
While no effective blockade of Porto
Rico has yet begun, I have it on relia
ble authority that American men-of
war have been cruising in that neigh
borhood for several days.
Members of the na r ai war board have
prepared a ph.n of operations against
San Juan and some of the members ara
in favor nf taking immediate steps to
deprive Spain of this important port.
It is conceded by naval strategists that
San Juan" will be extremely important
as a base of operations for Spanish
troops. In order that the earrison might
hold out as long a*s possible supplies of
all kinds were shipped in and it Is pre
pared to withstand a long siege.
In some circles it is regarded as prob
able that the action of this Government
in permitting- Porto Rico to remain un
attacked is due to its desire to draw
the Spanish fleet from Cape Verde to
San Juan and when it reaches that
port to send the armored ships of
the American squadron to give it bat
tle.
Spanish authorities appreciate as
well as do those of the United States
that so far as this country is concerned
the quicker a decisive battle is fought
tho better, and in some circles it is be
lieved that Spain will scatter her fleet
as much as possible, and will conduct
guerrilla warfare against this country.

SANTA CRUZ, April 26.â At 5:15
this evening a portion of the Califor
nia Powder Works blew up. There
was a Beries of terrific explosions and
at once the nature of the catastrophe
flashed across every mind. People
rustled into the streets, and a few in<Â«
a later were on ihe way to the
scene of the catastrophe, fearful that
ihing awful had occurred, and
yet conscious that at any instant
th^re might be an added calamity.
Hardly had the throng started f,, r
the scene when the sky was lighted by
a burst of flame, and a dull roar
startled the senses of those already
intensely wrought up by the dread
possibility of what had occurred.
Many turned back, and were spared a
Bight which description could hardly
Portray. There had been destruction
and death.
The i wder mill canyon was one
pea of fire. Amid the blinding timbers
and rapidly licking flames there did
not seem to be a vestige of the Cali
fornia Powder Works remaining.
Hcraps from gun cotton were falling
in showers to the ground. Aa one
neared the sc^ne of the explosion,
shingles, pieces of timber and gal
vanized Iron were strewn about in
confusion.
A half hour before this had been one
of the busiest spots in California.
Every man anil boy who could work
in the mills were engaged, and car
penters, masons and builders were en
larging the works.
Eight bodies have been taken from
the debris, nearly all charred beyond
reÂ© ignition.
Those dead are: James Miller fthe
foreman), Ernest Marshall, Luther
Marshal], Ernest Jennings, Charles Mil
ler and Guy Fagen. All of these were
employed In the smokeless plant.
Charles Cole, a carpenter, working a
hundred yards from the building, first
reported missing, is dead. Ed Gillman,
a stonemason, on his way home from
the works, was struck by a falling rock
and was found dead.
Among the wounded are: Mike Noon,
who received a cut on the head; Dr.
Congdon, who went to attend the
wounded and was struck on the back
by a flying rock; William Burge., struck
by a piece of falling rock and horribly
cut on the face; Bert Rea, working
outside, struck by a rock on the back
of the head and knocked senseless. In
falling he struck his elbow, which was
fractured. George Sutton. wounded by
falling timber; J. W. Nelson, carpenter,
cut on forehead and right hand frac
tured.
So great Is the confusion that even
now there Is a conflict as to the num
ber and identity of the victims.
The fire spread all over the canyon,
and the falling timbers were as fire
brands, which ignited the brush in all
directions. The men were soon at
work. The powder mills village is about
a quarter of a mile down the creek from
the scene of the explosion. Here, nes
tled in a canyon, in a lovely spot, is a
village of about twenty houses and a
Â»-. hoolhouse. This is the place of resi
dence of many of the employes of the
works. The entire village wns in flames,
fire destroying what escaped the shock.
The escapes of the women and children
from falling timbers were miraculous.
The home rrf Mr. Johnson is in ruins,
Mrs. Johnson and the children Just es
caping from the falling roof. The
boarding-bouse was also knocked to
pieces. Mrs. Margaret Wordon. the
boarding house keeper, was struck by
a piece of flying glass while running out
of her house, and was cut severely on
the top of her head and had her left
ear nearly severed. The two lodping
houses were soon In flames, while the

Fortunately the powder works do not
keep a great supply "f the product on

night is high and the streets have been
one mass of people gathered about to
discuss th" explosion. The men who
are employed at the works each has \
his story to tell. Telegrams by the
score are being sent by the men who !
escaped to friends telling them of their
safety.
Hundreds of cords of wood used in
th<- manufacture of charcoal Cor powder
has been burned.
Will)ur Iluntington Jr. was at -work
within 100 feet of the explosion paint
ing: a house. He was twirled off th>
ladder and when he struck the ground
th" contents of the paint bucket had
painted his face red.
The work of erection of new mills to
take the place of those destroyed will
be commenced immediately. It will not
take long. The work of making pow
der will go right on without interrup
tion. There are a large number of
mills.
An eye-winepp to the c:. >losion says
that all that c0..1d be se was a
whirling of clouds of smoke, then a tre
mendous explosion. Then could be seen
the iron roofs, timbers, pieces of ma
chinery, iron pipes in the air and next
the falling to the earth, and the flames
which devoured everything before
them. All the buildings and debris
were on fire.
Another witness said he fl is seated
on the front porch of the navy smoke
less building. MOO ; ards from the rifle
smokeless building, which was the first
to go.
The cause will never be known, as
the men employed in this mill â James
E. Miller, Carlyle itoss, Ernest Mar
shall ant! J uth'^r Marshall â will never
tell the tale. All were in the burlding
at the time of the explosion.
Th" next be lding was the shotgun
smokeless, or Handley's smokeless, as
it Is called. Handler, on hearing the
first explosion, ran from the building
where he was at work r.nd had only
gr>t a short distance from it when it
exploded. .He as miracul jsly saved
and was soon at the village to meet his
wife, who had come from town almost
frantic to find what had been his fate.
The guncotton warehouse is supposi 1
to have contained between three and
four tons of guncottonj one of the worst
explosives known. This created the
biggest flames of any of the explosions,
and when it went off the flames shot
h!~h in the air. affording a tremendous
spectacle.
The last and hardest shock of the ex
plnsion was thai of the vacuum dryer.
Here is where the shotgun smokeless
r- -<\er is dried by a new process. The
new smokeless powder building, which
was near by, and \. s under construc
tion. was destroyed as a result of the
concussion of the explosion. There was
hi-) powder in It.
The amount of powder exploded will
never be Aown, but it reached into the
thousands of pounds. The powder is
shipped to the Government as quickly
as manufactured, a fact which render
ed the disaster less appalling than it
might easily h. ye been.
The scene at Wessendorf & fitaffler's
undertaking parlors is ;i phastly one.
Here are the bodies <>f ei^ht of those
who lost their lives. <Â»f the eight only
two are reeognizabl >. The first one
brought in was that of Edward Gil
leran. killed by a falling brick while
on his way to his house. He was found
by his son.
Only one body of the seven who were
killed in the actual explosion !s reeoi;:
r.izable. that of Luther Marshall. lie
is the only one whos.- head is on the
trunk. All that remains of two of the
victims could be placed in a hat.
At first there was wild talk that the
explosion wns the work of a Spanish
spy, but there seems no ground lor
this belief. The works were carefully
guarded, and the men had tvorfced un
der such pressure that it is supposed
some of them got careless. At best.
the danger of accident at a powder -mil]
is always recognized, and no means of
a\<rting it has yet been devised.
The explosion was confined solely to
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 1898.
the army smokeless plant upon the east
Bide of the river. All the main powder
works, black powder works, the brown
prismatic ami navy smokeless were
saved, nor were they at any time In
any danger. Had it not been for the
fierce northern wind the explosion
would have been confined to the first
h<>use altogether. The accident hap
pened in the dry guncotton house. Fi
nancial loss is as nothing to the !"ss
of life, being from $18,000 to $20,000.
The works will be rebuilt immediately,
and there will be no delay whatever in
filling Government contracts.
Several of those killed were born and
reared in Santa Cruz, and known by all
from childhood. There are many sad
hearts in this city to-night.
A NATIONAL CALAMITY.
Leaves the Government But One
Source of Powder Supply.
It is hard for the average civilian
to realize the significance of the de
struction of the California Powder
Wcrks at this critical tinisâ that it
means that Uncle Sam has left until
the works are rebuilt but one solitary
source "f powder supply for all the
heavy guns of the army and nayy â
that of the Dupont establishment in
the East.
Isn't the composition of all powders
i well known and can't almost any of
the powder factories of America buckle
to and rush out powder according to
the formula in next to no time?
Couldn't the Government sharps go to
mixing r.ltro-glycerine and things by
the ton in no time?
No they couldn't. Common black
powder would be easy to ->t or make,
fHE EXPLOSION AS IT APPEARED TO EYE-WITNESSES.
j but Uncle Sam doesn't use it to any
; extent. In all th â¢ guns of the army
and navy, from the one-, mnders to the
13-inch guns, either "smokeless" or
"brown prismatic" powd-r is used.
Even the new Krag-Jorgensen army
rifle uses smokeless pov/der and the
black powder for the big mortars is
large-grained stuff made in a certain
1 way. There is not a powder manu
facturer in America, aside from the
California Powder Works and the Du
ponts, that hns been able to make a
pound of powder for the Gf eminent,
though the Government keenly wants
competition and would give a big pow
der contract to any firm at any time.
The makiner of both the smokeless
and the brow:, prismatic powders is a
job requiring more delicate skill and
experience than is often demanded in
[a manufacturing enterprise: . mokeless
powder is a preparation of nitro-glycer
ine and gun-cotton, the proportions dif
fering for the â¢ rmy and navy respect
ively in accordance with the differing
theories of th>' ordnance experts of the
two departments and formulae count
for little.-. :' ,'â¢,;.
"TVs well might one take one of Marlon
Harland's recipes and expect to beat an
experienced old wench at making
bread, or read a book and try to com- ;
pete with an old cellar-master at mak- !
ing and aging wine. The powder must I
stand just so many degrees of heat with
safety. It must act during the course â 
of a few thousandths of a second with
a steady and regular increase of power |
that knows no fitful energy. Every !
, ounce of the big charge must be burned
during the few thousandths of a sec
ond which the shell t.-Ves in reaching
the muzzle, and it must not all be ex
ploded while the projectile is two or
three feet from the muzzle. It must
develop just so much energy at the
muzzle and it must do and be a lot of
other things to a nicety.
These thing's cokic with delicate and
certain manipulations like the making
of rare vine. A degree of heat a sec
ond of time, a pound of pressure and
so on at various stages of manipulation
have their sure effect. All this applies
as well to the ' rown prismatic or "slow
burning" powder.
This is wholly different from the
smokeless powders, and in composition
is practically the same as black pow
der except that the charcoal is not
charred so much, the brown color being
due to the fact that the change from
wood to charcoal was arrested earlier.
Yet the preparation of this half-char
coal is a delicate operation in which an
instant of time or a degree of heat has
an effect, and when after various man
ipulations the whole composition
reaches a big and costly hydraulic
press, the 250 or so automatic move
ments which the press makes per min
ute are affected by a slight change of
hydraulic pressure with a consequent
result on the quality of the powder.
Not so very long ago an employe of
the Dv Ponts thought he had mastered
the secrets of powder-making, and he
induced a wealthy milk-dealer of Phil
adelphia to back him in making powder
for the Government. They got a con
tract easily enough, and made some
powder. When it was tested by the
Government sharps at Indian Head it
was found that about half way between
the breech and the muzzle there was an
undue expansion, which tended to swell
the gun at that point. The problem
was too much for the expert, and no
powder was sold to the Government.
Any one can get the formula for
Government^ powders, and anybody al
most can get a powder contract with
Uncle Sam. Almost anybody can mix
a mess of stuff according to recipe,
that will go off in a gun, but the fact
remains that but two firms in America
have been able to make powder fit for
Uncle Sam to use on an enemy, al
though the prices are temptingâ 3s
cents a pound for brown powder and S3
cents for Bmokejesa in million-pound
lots. An expensive plant and long ex
perience are among the things required.
WILL SOON RESUME WORK.
Plant May Be in Operation at the
End of a Week.
PORTLAND, Or., April 26.â Captain
John Rer: ingham, president of the
California Powder Works, who is now
in Portland, received the first news of
the accident at 7:35 o'clock this even
ing, as he was leaving the dining
room. His information was meager,
being nothing beyond the fact that the
army s.nokeless powdt magazine hnd
been blown up and ten lives lost. Cap
tain Bermingham said:
"We have a contract to supply the
Government with 3.000.000 pounds of
smokeli'ss powder, and in order to
hasten its manufacture the working
force was largely Increased. The pow
der was being turned over to the Gov
ernment's agents as rapidly as made,
but I cannot say how much has been
delivered, although a large amount had
been shipped. Work will be resumed
as speedil as po:- Ible. We have been
erecting new mach.iery, and -a soon
as the wreck is cleared away we will
start up again. Of course I cannot say
how soon, but I think in about a week,
for under the present circumstances it
is highly Important that we should
keep right on with the manufacture.
It may be even necessary for us to in
crease our present capacity."
GOVERNMENT'S LOSS.
Filling of a Monster Contract for
Powder Delayed.
The secretary of the Calift nia Pow
der Works?. J. B. Nesmlth. was seen
last evening, but knew very little about
the expldsion.
"We have had very meager reports
of the accident here," he said, "but
what we have heard leads me to be
lieve that <>n!y one of the plants was
blown up.. That was the mill in which
was manufactured the army smokeless
powder, and was. of course, the one
most needed just now. We have a
large order to supply the Government
with the army smokeless and the brown
prismatic powder. The plant in which
the latter is manufactured was not in
jured, if the report 1 have received
is true.
"I can Slve no figures as to the
amount of powder ordered by the Gov
ernment, as that is a state secr"et; but
to fill it will require running the plants
at full force for many months to come.
When the blowing up of the Maine was
reported to the authorities and war
threatened in the middle of February
we first received the Government order
and immediately began to fill it. We
put on an extra force of men and iust
about doubled the capacity of the
work 3. A great deal of powder haa
already been turned out and trans
ferred to the Government, but a large
amount is still to be manufactured. We
are at the present time making exten
sive additions to the plant and thesu
are about completed. When the new
mills are in working order we will be
able to turn out about four times as
much powder as we did before the
Government order was given to us.
"As soon as we heard of the explosion
William C. Peyton, the assistant super
intendent of the works, took a sDecial
train to Santa Cruz to personally in
vestigate the accident. As nearly as
we can tell the explosion took place
about 5:30.
"Of course the accident will hamper
the works to a great extent, but if it
is no worse than has been reported to
us there will be but little time lost, j
With the Government contract on our \
hands it is of course absolutely neces
sary for us to rebuild immediately and
the work will be pushed forward as
rapidly as possible.
"As to the cause of the explosion,
that would be merely a matter of con
jecture and probably never will be'
known for certain. In accidents of this i
kind where men are killed it is gen- j
erally those who did not survive who
know the most about it. When we be- I
gan the work for the Government twc:i
ty-flve deputy United States Marshals !
were detailed to guard the plant aud j
they have been on duty constantly
since the latter part of February to j
prevent any attempt to blow up the
works."
The president of the company. John
Bermingham, is in Seattle at present
and was promptly notified of the acci
dent. Several of the gentlemen em
ployed in the offices of the works were
interviewed and their statements were
similar to those of the secretary. None
of them had any theory to offer as to
the cause of the explosion, and all
seemed to think that the accident would
only delay the work of supplying the
Government with powder for a short
time.
BELIEF FOR MCHMOND.
The members of the Point Lobos Im
provement Club were in somewhat of a I
happy frame of mind last night in conse
quence of progressive reports received
from all of the standing committees ex- i
cept that on transfers. This committee I
reported that Mr. Vining had refused to j
grant transfers from the Geary-street '
road to the Third. This Is considered aj
great injustice to the residents on the line j
of Geary street, inasmuch as they alone j
are compelled to pay two fares to get to i
the San Jose depot or to the Mail Dock, '
while the residents of other portions of
the city are accorded transfer privileges, j
President Fletcher reported that the
Street Superintendent had promised to I
have the sewers flushed. A movement is
on foot with hopes of success to have a j
sewer run through A street from Fifth >
avenue to Eighth, which will drain Park
schoolhouse, in which there are sixty-five
children. This is the street immediately
west of the French Hospital, on which ,
there is no sewer.
Chairman Felix McHugh reported that
the Park Commissioners had promised to
make the necessary opening into the park
at First avenue during the coming sum
mer.

Book Question.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO.; April 26.â The pro
ceedings of the City and County School
Superintendents were disturbed by a
slight riffle this morning, and t came
as a relief to the lagging spirit and
monotony of the convention. It was on
the question of changing the annual
meeting of the County Board f Edu
cation to semi-annual meetings. Lin
sco-tt of Santa Cruz, in the course of
his remarks, said:
"The younger members of this con
vention will live to see the day when
the county examining boards will be
abolished entirely. We are not ripe
for it now, and we older ones i.. >v not
live to see it, but the time is not far
distant when our teachers will be taken
entirely from the great universities and
normal schools. Let us not stand .n the
way, I pray you, of this advance and
improvement. It is bound to come."
Harrell of Kern arose and said:
"While the gentleman from Santa
Cruz is praying to this convention not
to stand in the way of abolishing the
county boards, I trust he will include
in his invocation t'-ie request that our
normal schools may turn out teachers
who are competent to take charge of
our schools."
Following this little episode came the
school book question, and it arose in a
most unexpected manner. The conven
tion was passing on the section which
provides that no change of text-books
must be made at any other time than
"in the months of April, May or June
of the year in which the change is to be
made." A r ->tion was made striking
out the month of April, and upon a di
vision it carrio
I.iinscott of Santa Cruz, who has so
far been the " torm center" of the con
vention, created mother commotion by
declaring that the amendment directly
affected the State series.
Mr. Nielsen of Santa Itosa advised
the convention not to be led by the ex
citement of the hour, and offered a
resolution that a committee of five be
appointed by the chair to express the
opinion of this convention relating to
the proper place and use of the State
text books in the public schools of Cali
fornia.
When the question was finally put,
the motion to appoint the committee
prevailed by a vote of 29 to 24. Presi
dent Black then appointed the follow
ing- committee: Neilsen, Erleulne, Lin
scott. Bailey, Chymonds.
While the vote to send the master to
a committee was a temporary victory
to the enemies of the Ltate series, it is
believed that when the report is made
the convention will sustain the pres
ent law

THE EXAMINER h|AS WELShjED.*
THE Examiner has welshed. It is a regrettable
circumstance that it should have done this, and
that there is no more pleasing term to describe
the operation. When the Maine was sent to the bot
tom the Examiner offered a reward of $50,000 for
discovery of the miscreant in the case. That is to say,
the New York Journal offered this sum. It made the
offer in token of patriotism, and as .an indication that
the scoop it had suffered on the occasion in question
had stirred it to. its depths. On this coast the Ex
aminer got full credit fur the prodigality.
Of course nobody took the matter with the se
riousness that the Examiner itself did. The public,
not being an aggregate idiot, recognized the bluff
and discerned the string by which this goodly pile of
gold was attached to the Ilearstling sheets which
had made the pretense of offering it. As time went by
the fact became apparent that the precise author of
the crime would not be discovered. But now that our
Uncle Sam has taken a hand, and seems likely to as
certain the facts and handcuff the* culprit, the $50,000
is withdrawn. It is a clear instance of welshing.
Uncle could find use for $50,000.
But the sleuth bent upon uncovering a great crime
and at the same time winning as large and imposing a
pile as that the Examiner has just snatched away has
no reason to be discouraged. Immediately after the
$50,000 spasm of the Examiner The Call declared hs
readiness to pay $50,000 to the discoverer of the vil
lain who hit Billy Patterson. This offer still stands.
There is no doubt that Billy was struck; it is equally
certain that a villain did it. When The Call proclaims
a reward there is no inclinatio - to pull it out of the
reach of the eager detective just as it seems within his
grasp. Let the scoundrelly assailant of Billy Patter
con be dragged forth, identified, and the money awaits
as truly as the Examiner $50,000 awaited until the
6Otry moment when Hearst took what is technically
known as a tumble and got tired of being considered

THE PLUNDER OFTHE SCHOOL FUNDS.
WHILE the evidence collected by the Grand
Jury of the plunder of the school funds may
not yet amount to sufficient legal proof to con
vict any particular person of the crimes, it certainly
â¢hows that the School Directors have been guilty of
criminal negligence to an extreme degree. It is
hardly possible that such barefaced frauds as those
disclosed could have been carried on for so long a
time without the knowledge and connivance of at least
some of the members of the board.
Almost every step taken in the investigation so far
has resulted in the discovery of new frauds. As the
examination goes on the amount of money of which
it is known the city has been defrauded increases.
It has already run far up into the thousands, and when
the investigation has been completed the extent of the
plunder will probably be as startling as the boldness
with which it was devised and carried out.
Under the circumstances there is but one thing for
the Grand Jury to do. It must pursue the investiga
tion to the end, so as to determine not only how much
money has been stolen, but who are the guilty par
ties. A scandal of this kind will be a very grave scan
dal indeed if it does not result in the exposure of the
criminals, their conviction and their sentence to long
terms in the penitentiary.
Occupied as the people are with the war, they are
not so much absorbed by it as to be neglectful or in
different to this crime against the municipality. Even
the most careless citizens are aroused to indignation
at the waste and plunder of the funds provided for the
education of the children of the city. There is but one
sentiment on the subject, and that is a desire for the
prompt prosecution of the offenders.
The frauds have been gross. Thousands of feet of
lumber have been paid for that were never delivered
to the city. First-class lumber and fancy shingles
have been called for by the specifications of contracts,
and third grade lumber and Common shingles have
been accepted and paid for at the prices agreed upon
for the better grades. Surely it is not too much to
suppose that some of the Directors must have known
of such frauds as these.
It behooves all Directors who may be innocent of
connivance in the frauds to assist in convicting the
guilty parties, for unless the real criminals are made
known the whole board will be under suspicion. The
moral of the situation is plain; the only way to acquit
the innocent is to convict the guilty.
There is something strange in the way Captain
Robinson eloped from his position on the police
force, and it will be stranger still if his right to name
a successor shall be recognized.
PROVIDING FOR THE WAR DEBT.
THE preliminary measures proposed in the bill
of the Ways and Means Committee to provide
a sufficient war credit are of necessity based on
existing law. That law authorizes the issue of bonds
payable in "coin." Under the existing provisions of
the Sherman act of 1890 the GoTernment is pledged
j to maintain gold and silver at a parity, an equality, at
the established ratio of 16 to 1. That obligation of the
treasury of necessity makes a "coin" bond a gold
I bond, and these securities will be disposed of with that
j understanding and protected by that statutory pledge.
If in future emergencies, to protect the treasury
j against the drain of gold by redemption of green
backs, the Government find it necessary to suspend
specie payments, there will arise the practical ques
tion of a further definition of the contract between the
Government and its creditors. Then the whole ques
tion of our financial policy will be in focus.
When that time comes it is already evident that the
fiatists intend to force a resort to a legal tender paper
issue. When such issue is made no eye can foresee
its volume, but experience teaches reliably its effect.
The country will be where it was at the cl se of the
Civil War, with a large unfunded debt represented by
depreciated paper. This mass will be added to by the
whole existing issue of silver dollars, fallen to their in
trinsic value, which will not much exceed 50 cents on the
dollar, and the whole problem of resumption and re
demption will have to be gone over again, as it was in
1868. As an alternative it would be better financiering
to rely on a non-legal tender certificate, if it were not
for the existence of $340,000,000 of the old greenbacks,
which might prevent circulation of the new certifi
cates. The true way, however, will be in the securing
of gold for bonds by making them definitely payable
in gold. With gold in hand the cost of the war will be
as much less as the amount represented by the dis
count of any form of unfunded paper, or that of bonds
payable in "coin." that carry the risk of redemption
in depreciated silver.
It should be easy to see that if the Government is
pushed to the necessity of paying out depreciated
paper or selling bonds at a discount it has to pay
more for every pound of powder, every equipment
and ration that it must use in the wasteful game of
war. This added cost falls finally upon the taxpayers.
There is no room for doubt that this same method
pursued in the Civil War made its cost just twice what
it should have been, and for thirty years the people
have been patiently parting with their resources to pay
the bill. In that time they have been paying two dol
lars when they should have paid only one, and it
seems marvelous that in the light of such an expe
rience the fiatists should be able to secure any meas
ure of popular approval for a repetition of the costly
experiment.
As The Call said months ago, the real supporters
of the credit and honor of the country will be separ
ated from the pseudo-patriots when war financiering
becomes a burning issue.
Senator Allen of Nebraska has already flung the
fiat challenge at the administration in his resolution
declaring that financial provision for the war shall be
in accordance with the Populist platform of 1896.
That platform demands that obligations of the Gov
ernment be paid in any kind of lawful money which
the Government chooses to use. Of course this means
payment in the least valuable and most depreciated
form of such "lawful money." and is a policy Â«vhi
would do the country more damage than the Span
iard, are likely to inflict.
MENRI ROChJEFORT'S ESTIMATE.
SO many foolish things said or written by Henri
Rochefort have been quoted and repeated over
and over again that when by any chance he
utters something framed on lines of good sense and
infused with the glow of truth it is only fair that
it also should be quoted and circulated in order that
the world may know he has occasional lucid inter
vals in which he appears as a man of fair merit and
considerable judgment.
He has just given utterance to one of these lucid
statements, and the fact is the more remarkable be
cause it comes at a time when most French journal
ists seem to have lost their wits altogether and gone
crazy on the issue to which it refers. Answering the
common belief in Europe that the American people
are but a mob of undisciplined jingoes incapable of
raising an army fitted to confront the trained soldiers
of any European nation, Rochefort has recently said
in L'lntransigeant:
"In America no one is a soldier, which means that
in case of a conflict every one is. Spain, very for
midable in her sierras, as she proved in 1808, cannot
seriously hope to conquer or even to seriously incon
venience a race full of initiative and audacity, one of
whose most magnificent characteristics is contempt
of life. No European power which managed to set
root on American soil would come out of it alive.
Horror and, let us recognize it, contempt of foreign
ers have given the citizens of the great republic such
confidence and inspired them with such firm resolu
tions that the fear of defeat or invasion does not even
touch them. Spaniards are very patriotic and very
brave; nothingcan bemordtrue; but their courage will
hurl itself in vain against the terrific enthusiasm which
the arrival of their first ships in American waters will
arouse in their adversaries."
It is not often that so accurate an estimate of Amer
ican characteristics as this appears from a European
writer. Under even the most favorable circumstances
it would hardly find much acceptance amonc those
who have long indulged the belief that a free people
cannot fight, that volunteer armies are worthless, and
under present conditions it will hardly find favor at
all. It will not be very long, however, before the
eyes of the foreign critics will be opened, and then
Rochefort will have the satisfaction of reminding the
jeering journalists of Paris, "I told you so."
Both ex-President Cleveland and ex-President
Harrison have won good opinion by the simple pro
cess of being silent upon every occasion when yellow
journalism had the impertinence to ask them to talk
on Spanish affairs. They are merely passengers now,
but, having had a turn at the wheel, understand that
the man in charge is apt to know the points of the
compass.
Spanish schemes for blowing up the American ships
at Cuba are grossly interfered with by the repugnance
of the men on board to being treated in this way. In
fact the ships are there largely to show the Dons that
being blown up is regarded as an unpleasant expe
rience, and an evidence of unneighborly spirit.
Blanco is desperate, but he has not reached the
stage at which he deems it advisable to execute an
English sea captain. When he shall get to that point
Spain will be treated to the violent experience of two
lickings in rapid succession.
There would be a fine bit of justice in the spectacle
of General Lee riding Blanco's horse through the
streets of Havana.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 1898.
THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES.
IN declaring war against Spain Congress fixed the
date of the outbreak of hostilities at April 21, and
the language was to the effect that war already ex
isted at the time the declaration was made. It was in
terms a recognition of a state of war rather than a
proclamation of the beginning of one.
This feature of the declaration met with some objec
tion in both houses, and may probably be the cause of
considerable discussion hereafter. It is of importance,
because on it will turn the right of the United
States to condemn as prizes the Spanish ships cap
tured between, April 21 and the time when the declara
tion of war was issued by the President. In fact it has
been already asserted that the marine courts of the
United States will hold that the prizes have been un
lawfully taken, and therefore will liberate the cap
tured ships.
The point was raised in the Senate by Senator Pet
j tigrew, who made some opposition to the resolution
on the ground that the date had been fixed for the
purpose of legalizing the capture of the ships now
claimed as prizes. The answer made by Senator
I Davis, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,
I was that the date had not been determined by any
j consideration of the kind stated by the Senator from
South Dakota, but by the action of the Spanish Gov
ernment in dismissing the United States Embassador.
While Senator Pettigrew and some others may be
I sanguine that our courts will hold that the war did not
-begin on the date declared, it is not easy to see on
J what grounds they base their conclusion. The view
i that the dismissal of our representative at Madrid was
J an act of war is not taken by the United States alone.
; The British Government took the same view at the
j moment the act of Spain was made known, and or
; dcrs were at once given to officials throughout the
empire to treat American and Spanish warships in
their ports as the laws of neutrality require in time of
actual hostilities.
As British sympathies are known to be on our side
in the contest, it is possible their judgment on the act
of Spain may have been influenced somewhat by a
desire to give us every advantage they could. Xever
theless, the action of Great Britain remains a pre
cedent which will have its weight with the nations.
Spain committed the act which in the judgment of in
ternational law constituted the beginning of hostili
ties, and Congress could not have done otherwise
than recognize that fact and date the outbreak of war
at the time fixed.
BALMACEDA AND THE CHARTER.
AN intelligent correspondent, whose communica
tion is too long for publication, says there is a
strong probability that the proposed new char
ter would yield us the kind of government which pre
vailed in Chile under the lamented Balmaceda. In that
country, he informs us, the chief political boss always
manages the Peruvian guano deposits. Balmaceda's
system consisted in appointing his principal political
friend to this place and using the revenue of the de
posits to promote his own fortunes. In this way he
held the Presidency for some time. Just as he was
about to retire, promote his friend to the Presidency
and assume the management of the guano beds him
self, the people got up the revolution which resulted
in his death. Our correspondent regards this revolu
tion as justifiable. In no other way, he avers, could
the people have shaken Balmaceda off.
We think, however, that in drawing a parallel be
tween the Mayor and the chairman of the Board of
Public Works of the proposed charter and Balmaceda
and the manager of the Peruvian guano deposits our
correspondent is practicing a somewhat wild air. Un
i doubtedly the chairman of the Board of Public Works
; under the charter will, next to the Mayor himself, be
the most powerful official we have ever seen. He will
hold in the hollow of his hand the street contractors.
paving corporations, street car companies and all per
sons who ask municipal privileges connected with the
public thoroughfares. He will annually expend di
| rectly from a half to three-quarters of a million on
j street and sewer improvements, and indirectly several
millions on behalf of property-owners liable for the
cost of improving unaccepted streets. The Board of
Public Works, as our correspondent truly says, "con
sists of three members, two of whom will be ap
pointed by every Mayor.
But while all this is in accordance with the facts,
we are constrained to say that in our opinion no such
result would follow here as in Chile. Our correspon
dent should remember that we are more civilized
than the Chileans, and that for this reason it is quite
probable that we would submit for a long time
to an â¢ xchange of places between the Mayor and the
chairman of the Board of Public Works. In any
event it is doubtful whether even if an endless ribbon
such as Balmaceda inaugurated were established here
our people would ever meet it with violence.
Our correspondent should remember that the char
ter makers made one great concession to the people.
While they conferred upon the Mayor power to ap
point and remove everybody, including elected offi
cials, they also required him to be elected himself
every two years. True, as our correspondent says,
it might be difficult to dislodge a Mayor who con
trolled the "saloon vote." the street car lines, the
School Department, the Fire Department and the
police, and who also, through the Election Commis
sion, canvassed the vote; but it should not be for
gotten that the charter confers upon the people .the
privilege of making such a trial. It is barely possible
that the Mayor and the chairman of the Board of Pub
lic Works might some day becaughtoff their guard or
out of town. Then the people could raid and rout
them. We are free to confess, however, that' the
theory of our correspondent that a revolution would
be the speediest remedy has its strong points.
Oakland's School Board seems to be composed of
different material from that ordinarily chosen on this
side. The body now has on hand $15,000, for which
there is no immediate demand. If by any miracle
such a sum had been in the treasury of ou- own
Board of Education there are few members who
would not have found at least one excuse for expend
ing it and had it out of the way so quickly that the
Grand Jury would have had no time to interfere.
In a general way the downfall of Widber is an ar
gument against the endless performance given on the
local race track. More specifically it adds to an al
ready partly accepted theory that the betrayal of
trust is neither wise nor profitable.
A gentleman bent on raising a regiment in Wall
street worked hard for several days and secured four
volunteers. His object was to demonstrate the brand
of patriotism rampant there and he succeeded.
Spain's bonds have taken another drop. The tum
ble of the sort of bonds she has fastened on Cuba
may have been noticed also.
Polo y Bernabe got out of the country unscathed.
There was no disposition to make a national frame of
Polo.
MILITARY SECRETS.
TOURING the discussion in the British
j I Parliament last year of the naval
II estimates the First Lord of the Ad
miralty made a statement substan
tially as follows: "The several powers j
are cognizant of the details of naval and
land defenses of each country, and the |
only military secrets which we may be i
reasonably sure of being our own are con- j
templated strategic movements planned."
The only two countries in which mili
tary secrets are well guarded are Russia
and Germany, and published details about :
the materiel of the army and navy are ;
too general in their character to be of any i
value to outsiders. Great Britain and the
United States have until quite recently j
taken the public into their confidence, j
and it has not been difficult for foreign
military and naval attaches to observe j
and report upon the minutest details of
ships, guns, fortifications and other parts I
of the two services. The present Bureau
of Naval Intelligence in our Navy De
partment dates back to about 1883, prior j
to which the Bureau of Steam Engineer
ing had, in a desultory way, collected |
data about foreign ships. In Europe, the
Austrian Navy Department began as
early as 1865 to issue a publication giving j
news of foreign navies, maintaining for I
this purpose a staff of officers. It was |
not until about eight years ago that the
British Admiralty recognized the import- j
axice of such an adjunct to the naval ad
ministration, and at the present time
every country of any military importance I
nas bureaus of intelligence. Naval and I
military attaches are now a part of each
â¢^? ation ' in ac *dition to which officers on |
ships or traveling keep their eyes and
ears open and make reports to their re
spective bureaus. The Intelligence Bureau
or the navy, besides full information j
actly what each country possesses in j
S f S h guns> torpedoes and other details j
i l v. na _ vv > besides full information
auout harbor defenses. AVhere vessels I
a '* e . built by contract, no secrecy about i
their construction can be observed, and j
the same applies to guns and other war i
material. Ihere are complete plans and
data on file in Washington of every naval !
vessel built abroad of any consequence, â¢
and the construction of British and
1' rench guns, their effectiveness or short- j
comings, are as well known in Washing- j
ion as in the countries mentioned.
On the other hand, our naval and mili- i
k!Â« de P artr nents have given the widest
publicity, through official reports, of their I
doings; the navy-yards, ships, arsenals
Kun foundries and military posts, with I
kii fortlncati Â°i'S. have been open to the j
public, and if Spain or any other country
is not familiar with all that pertains to
our defenses it is not for the want of op
portunity of unchecked observation. In
time of pending hostilities this privilege
Is very properly restricted, solely because
of the damage that may be done by evil
disposed or thoughtless persons, and no
because secrets are to be guarded. This
mutual exchange erf professional news Is
now recognized as quite legitimate, and is
carried on openly and above board. It is
rarely that there is any friction caused
the only incident of that kind being in
ISSb, when Secretary "Whitney advertised
lor competitive plans for some of the pro
posed ships, and Commander Chadwick,
at that time naval attache to the lega- j
tion in London, came very near involving
the two Navy Departments in trouble.
Several officials in the British dockyards
were either dismissed or severely repri
manded for their connection with the
\\ hitney ship design advertisement.
In Great Britain the ships, forts, arsen
als and gun foundries are not open to the
public to the same extent as here, and :
certain restrictions are Imposed. In)
1 ranee, Germany and Russia the utmost
efforts are made to exclude visitors from
and arsenals, yet the almighty dol
lax causes the revelation of the most pro
found secrets, and while they do not be
come public property, yet they are stowei
away in the archives of army and nava
information. In Germany, the great works
of Krupp at Essen are accessible to the
public, subject, however, to a close watch
being kept on the visitor; but no outsider
is admitted to the gun tests at Wreppen
and the results which reach the public
are BUcn only as are given out by the
Krupp concern. The despotism, militar
ism and general espionage system of Ger
nn.ii.v enables it to preserve its military
- better than any other Govern
ment, and the following 1 authentic inci
dent shows how well the Kaiser has his
BUbjei ts in hand: In July, IMP 7. the Em
peror Invited the military attaches to
breakfast, and after the repast told them
it was needless keeping it a secret any
longer that the German army had had its
artillery changed without anything being
known of it outside of official circles. No
I<>BS than five army corps had been armed
with a new quick-firing Krupp gun, capa
ble of throwing ten tn twelve shells a
minute. The French attache at once took
train for Paris and found his Government
not entirely unprepared, and orders wÂ«r.e
at once placed with a number of factories
fur kuiis of improved model. The doings
of the French Government did not leak
out until Fast February, and the secret
Was kept nearly as well as in Germany.
Mr. Goshen'B statement in Parliament :
may be accepted as being the common- |
sense view of military secrets. The pub
lic knows as much about ships and guns '
in a general way as the majority of army I
and navy officials, but the actual ef- I
flciency is known only to a select few so |
far as relates to foreign services, -while I
in this country the merits and faufts have
been thoroughly discussed in public print I
and we have no secrets to keep from for
eigners..
CUBA'S NEW SILVER DOLLAR.
Cuba may not have a stable Govern
ment, but she has some sort of a body
which is exorcising one of the preroga
tives of sovereign States, that of coining
money, and silver dollars of her first
mintage have just been received in this
country, says the Chicago Inter Ocean.
The coin is a handsome one, contains
about 40 cents' worth of pure silver, and
the Cuban republic guarantees to re
deem it in gold after the establishment
of the island's Independence.
Emulating the example of this coun
try in issuing souvenir coins to be sold
at a premium for the benefit of the
World's Fair, these coins are also issued
a.s souvenirs to be sold for the benefit of
the Cuban hospital service, the profits
realized being used to purchase medi
cines, bandages and hospital supplies in
general.
The piece has on the obverse side the
head of a beautiful young Cuban woman
now residing in New York, typical of
Cuba Libre, and the words "Patria y
Libertad, 1897; Souvenir" ("Fatherland
and Liberty, 1597; Souvenir"). The re
verse shows the Cuban coat of arms, a
shield with a wreath composed of live
tobacco leaves and quartered with a sun
burst behind a sea with a key resting
upon it, typical of Cuba as the key to the
Western world, a palmetto tree, and
stripes from the national flag, typical of
the island of Cuba itself. The shield is
surmounted by a liberty cap on a pole
and the legend is "Republica de Cuba."
The coin is also stamped "900 tine."

Among the crowd yesterday were two
young fellows who had been waiting some
time, and who had drifted into conversa
tion with each other. After discussing
various things connected with the war,
one finally said to the other: "I, of
course, don't know anything of war fro*n
a personal experience, but I have ac
quired a pretty good idea from hearing
my father talk. He went to the front in
'61, and fought all through the trouble
until he was mustered out after losing a
leg at Chancellorsvilie." "Is that so?"
said the second of the two. "My father
was in the war also, but he was on the
other side, and fought with a Virginia
regiment up till the close. He subse
quently died from consumption brought
on by exposure while campaigning. You
see, when the war broke out he was on
the old plantation, andâ" But just then
the door of the adjutant's office opened,
and the son of the Confederate, catching
his companion by the arm, said, "Come
on," and the Xorth and South went in to
enlist together.

Another Day of Wild
Excitement on
'Change.
Morning Prices Drop at
the Afternoon Ses
sion.
The Board of Directors Finally
Force a Marginal Price
on Wheat.
HAY IS STILL VERY HIGH.
Timothy and Alfalfa ArÂ« Being Im
ported From Other ,
States.
There was a great deal of excitement
at the Produce Exchange yesterday
â g orning and all day, owing to the ad
v-ince in the price of wheat. Brokers
assembled at an early hour, and there
was no lack of interest while the day
lasted, and, as on the day before, there
was a great deal of talk of business
after the regular closing of the call
board.
The most Important feature of the
early day was the going up of the Liv
erpool market, which showed an ad
vance of 3 to 4 pence. With cargoes
quotably 46 shillings for Walla Walla,
California wheat is quotably 1 shilling
higher than Walla Walla. Added to
this was ,m advance of 3^i cents In
the Chicago market, with New York
reporting acceptance of everything of
fered yesterday. English houses were
using the call freely in order to secure
rear due cargoes. Liverpool reported
French importers making urgent re
quest for wheat in that market. All in
all. the wildest enthusiasm had worked
into the market even before the gong
Bounded. At the opening of the session
Jl V-2 was bid for December; then it
Jumj'.-i V;l cent at a time until $1 &~\
was reai hed. This advance was caused
by covering by a prominent short of a
heavy line of December. His purchases
of May sent the price of that option
to Jl 89. At the advance shippers open
ly sold freely, giving sh.rrts, who were
the only buyers, all the wheat they
wanted. This show of front weakened
es until Jl S3 was quoted for De
cember and Jl 86 for May. At these
prices early sellers turned buyers, caus
ing an advance to Jl 85% for December
ng easier at Jl S4U for December.'
At the final morning session Chicago
k began to weaken, which had consider
able to do with the temper of the
crowd. The board of directors deemed
the time had arrived when a marginal
â¢ â¢'hnuid be placed on wheat, as the
market was fairly running away with
itself; also that margins should be paid
into the bank. This they passed, and a
notice was posted on the official board
of the Exchange. It was rather in favor
of the shorts, as margins could only
be called to $1 80, whereas the longs
â were compelled to deposit in the bank
$300 on each 100 tons .if wheat. This is
the rule that was placed against Fair
when he had the market completely
â within his grasp. The rule Is generally
looked upon as an unjust one, as shorts
cell with their eyes open.
However the rule was effective
enough to break the price back to
|l 79% fi : i December. At the afternoon
session, buying hv shorts rallied the
price to $1 _i 2,i 2 , later selling at $1 sf
with May Jl S3. The rule bases the
price of wheat upon Liverpool quota
tions, freight added.
It is more than likely whejrf would
have declined had the rule not been
put into effect. The market has had an
advance of 47Â»2 cents without what
might be called a set back. The re
markable feature to the market has
been tho small realizing by holders
They hang on with a death grip believ
ing in J2 wheat. The substantial ad
vance in the English and French mar
kets warrants good prices. Should for
eign markets continue to advance no
doubt American markets will follow.
Yesterday's prices have not been ex
ceeded since 1891. At that time there
was less merit to the advance than the
present.
Barley was disappointing to Its
friends, who mustered up thfir entire
courage to advance prices. During the
rapidly advancing wheat market period
their efforts were of no avail. As one
broker put it. "You can't raise It with a
derrick." The market was as heavy as
lead, as it proved. On small offerings
the price dropped from Jl 3S\i> to Jl 3t]
for December with May closely follow
ing. At the closing afternoon session
the weakness In wheat was carried into
barley, December selling to Jl 33. Buy
ing by shorts advanced the market to
$1 34 1 -i. The only support barley hnd
was given it by shorts. There is a very
weak undertone to the market. The
fact of its depressed condition in the
of such remarkable strength In
wheat has and Is rapidly losing for it
its heretofore friends. Stock feeders
are substituting corn throughout the
State. The spot demand is falling off
rapidly as present prices are considered
too high V.y well posted dealers.
The trading yesterday was well dis
tributed among brokers. E. A. Bresse
was a heavy Beller of .December wheat
from Jl B5 to Jl 87%, trading in over
Poon tons. He also December bar
ley liberally. L. Kauffman was a seller
of wheat and barley. Shippers openly
s'.ld May and December wheat. Sig
Newman was the- heaviest buyer of
wheat. It is claimed his purchases
inted to 15,000 ions.
â¢ utter & Moseley unloaded a large
line of December wheat, supposed to
be for a prominent long. Blum was a
seller of May wheat, Baehr sold long
wheat and barley. Boule bought barley
early, selling later. l n the afternoon
early trading was animated. Offerings
r.t Jl 81 were heavy, but tho market
dragged downward until Jl 79^. was
reached for December. At the decline
b few shorts rallied the price to $1 ~u%~
Barley was fairly steady, Decomhr-r
Belling at SI 34 v 1 34%. At the advance
there wa? a heavy fe< "ng.
From reliable flour-dealera it was
learned yesterday that it j s nnto t likely
that It will )Â»â¢â¢ necessary to import that
commodity to the coast this year
Bperry & Co., speaking of the situa
tion, said: "We do not see any signs
that it will be necessary to import
Eastern Hour, as the Oreg ( , n supply
promises to be large enough to make ud
the surplus needed over our raisings
Of course, it Is hard to tell just what
Jhe situation is until full reports are
"â -., but there are not any particular
Mgrui of a desire to import from the
East so far as we can see."
Secretary Magner ot the Hay Ex
change says that a great deal of hay
is being Imported for local consumption j
and that it will be necessary to import
a great deal more. He said: "We are
buying a great deal of hay from Da
kota, Oregon, Utah and Washington,
owing to shortages in Contra Costa,
bonoma, Solano and other bay coun
ties of the State. Wo are buying al
falfa, timothy and prairie hays. The
crop in the principal counties of the
fetate is short at least a third."
SHORTS ON BARLEY.
Rumors That Prominent Deal
ers Are Trying to Over
load the Market.
There -were rumors on 'Change yester
day afternoon that Henry J. Crocker and
some members of the Pacific Union Club
were very short on wheat, and that their
shortage on barley was much greater, for
which reason some of the brokers thought
there was a movement to unload barley
and unload their shorts
There was also some thought that the
directors were doing all In their power to
help out the shorts, by making a mar
ginal price of $1 SO on wheat, which was
held by many to be too low. There will
?u etTo , rts lo have the directors rescind
the rule making the marginal price so

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 1898.
WILL NOT
CONSOLIDATE
A Fruitless Meeting of
the Two Baseball
Factions.
President Bert Refused to
Accede to Jako Raver's
Propositions.
Both Leagues Will Renew Hostili
ties With Unabated
Vigor.
Two hours of fruitless debate was had
last evening by the managers of the Cal
ifornia and Pacific States Leagues, for
the purpose of consolidation, but, as nei
ther side would accede to the propositions
of the other, the proposed deal has been
declared off.
President Bert of the Pacific States
League strongly urged that the managers
of the three San Francisco clubs of their
league consolidate with the management
of Oakland, San Francisco and Stockton
teams of the California League. They
wanted to ignore the California League
team at Sacramento for their club and to
place Santa Cruz instead or Fresno, none
of which the California League would
a^ree to.
The California Baseball League agreed
to consolidate with the Pacinc States
League only on one conditionâ that the
new league should consist of the Sacra
mento, Stockton, Oakland, San ivran
cisco and Fresno clubs of the California
League under their present management;
thai the two San Jose clubs should be
consolidated under the direction of S. N.
Kucker; that the new organization should
take up the National League protection
now held by the California League; that
L'ugene A. Bert should t>e president of
the new league; 11. H. McPike, president
of the California League, should be vice
president; Charles K. Wiggin of the Cali
fornia League, secretary, and T. F.
Bonnet, treasurer of the Pacinc States
League, treasurer, and all games should
be played with the National League ball
ana under National League rules.
As this did not meet with the approval
of the Pacific Stales contingent, v was
agreed to disagree, and both leagues will
go on in the even tenor of their ways.
At the meeting last night J. J. Kauer
for the California League said:
Mr. Bert "met me on Market street and sug
gested that two leagues would not be profit
able if they continued this fight, and that the
ball players would try to pull my leg and his
for higher salaries. WelL X Baid, my theory is
that H would be a good plan to consolidate
and have one league, as it would be profitable
to the owner's and (.layers themselves. I then
asked Mr. Kwing whether that .would be agree
able, and he said if the clubs could come to
gether and harmonize it would be a good plan.
McNeil sent for me last Sunday, and on my
arrival at his house I found Mr. liert. and we
discussed the whole matter. Mr. Bert- and
myself agreed to take charge of all these parka
on condition that Mr. Hunker and Air. Kwlng
were cared for. This was acreed to, but i
did not learn until to-r.i -ht that what they
meant by carine for Air. Bunker and Mr
Ewing was to put Mr. Crowley with Mr
Bunker, and that Mr. CofTroth, as manager for
Mr. Bushnell, was to be associated with Mr
Ewing as managers of the Oakland team. This
I retused to do. Our league was willing to
concede- the San Jose team to them on condi
tion that Mr. McGlynn, its manager, was given
the superintendency oi the grounds, also that
-Mr. Kucker be empowered to appoint whom-
Boever he pleased as manager 01 the Garden
City team. They wanted two San Francisco
teams to make it an eight team league but
as the rules of the national afe-reement will not
permit any two clubs to exist In one city I
would not agree to it. . "
We wanted them to throw out Santa Cruz
and put in Fresno, aa .Santa Cruz was a poor
baseball town, while Fresno has the backing of
its leading business men and the support of a
strong athletic club, but they would not listen
to Ã¼be proposition. Another reason why we
could not agree on a consolidation was that
they wanted Â»us to play at Central Park when
we knew that the Recreation grounds were bet
ter adapted to the national game
Uf^ni h . e taSSSJ?t B : Mr - Bert made the
These negotiations have been pending for
some weeks past. They were opened up the
Sunday following the day Corbett appeared at
Central Park. On that occasion we had a good
big crowd, and everything- was lovely aÂ£d

leagues would not do, and thought that if the I
managers could get together md agree we
could make a strong league. Mr RaSer who

REGISTRAR'S
NEW SYSTEM
Safeguards Against the
False Registration of
Voters.
Will Correct Pending Evils if
Aided by Election Com
missioners.
Many Changes Mods for tho Con
venience of thÂ« General
Public.
The Registrar's office of the City and
County of San 'rancisco has been thor
oughly renovated, and now assumes the
aspect of a respectable business office.
The old and unsightly structure, which
formerly occupied the center of the
office, has been removed, and a disposi
tion of the different desks has been
made which it is expected will materi
ally facilitate the work of the office
and afford greater convenience to per
sons desiring to register.
An entirely new and radical change
has been inaugurated in the system of
conducting registration, by which the
Registrar hopes to make illegal regis
tration not only difficult, but in every
way reasonable of detection.
Registrar Biggy says that under the
system, in vogue in the office for many
years, it was possible for a person to
register with each of the several pre
cinct clerks in the office, thus affording
an opportunity for fraudulent registra
tion of the must alarming magnitude.
The registration being made by differ
ent clerks was not easily detected by
the force in tht- office.
By the new system, recently adopted, I
all persons applying for registration i
are compelled to pass the careful scru- I
tiny of at least three clerks; one taking*
the voter's measure, ajiother taking his
address, and the thira fixing the pre*
cinct in which the voter belongs, be
fore receiving his certificate. As all of
the work of the three clerks is done .si
multaneously the registration is made
with remarkable rapidity.
The Registrar expects by the new I
methods which he has already put in!
operation to frustrate any attempt to
register illegally in his office.
Another important feature to wh'cb
Mr. Biggy called attention is the char
acter^ of the clerks under whose direct
supervision an applicant for re^istra
tlon must in all oases come. They have
been selected for their special adapta- j
bility for the respective positions they '
occupy.
One of the greatest faults founrf by ,
the Registrar is in the manner of ap
pointing men on the precinct boards.
This is done by the Election Commis
sioners, usually at the solicitation of
political friends, belonging to the iif
ferent political parties and by poiiti
clans representing certain factions
therein, thus forcing: upon the Registrar
men of unknown capability and at the
; same time making him responsible for '
their acts.

detecting fraudulent registration in the
different precincts it is claimed by the
Registrar takes away one of the great
eat safeguards again- 1 fraud that, hi:
has to deal with, and Mr. BlÂ«rgy says
that In view of his being held responsi
ble he should be given an opportunity
to learn the character of the men for
whom he is made accountable.
Mr. Biggy aims to overcome all of the
present difficulties in the way of honest
registration by the co-operation of the
Election Commissioners in the selection
of men known to be entirely competent
and reliable.
The Registrar has thrown the affairs
of the office open to the public nni
frankly says that he will conduct the
same on purely business principles, free
from any political taint, and that he
will make every effort to insure to the
voters of San Francisco an honest reg
istration.

Paloma's Piano Recital.
The astonishing piano playing and Im
provisations of little Paloma Schramm
entertained a snug little audience at the

sisted by Mrs. Florence Scarborough,
â¢whose contralto solos have been a happy
feature of all of Paloma's recitals here,
the young pianist will give three more re

and Friday and Saturday afternoons.
Melba has promised to attend Saturday's
recital and write a theme on which Pa

Ban Francisco, April 26, 1898.
SPORTED THE
BURNT CORK
Society Young Ladies Appear
as Black-Faced Come
dians.
A Splendid Entertainment Given by
Golden West Booth of St.
Patrick's Bazaar.
Young ladies can don the burnt cork,
the gaudy raiment and the fuzzy wig typ
ical of the "days befo' de wah," and sing,
laugh, crack Jokes, rattle the bones and
tambos just as well as the members of
the sterner sex. This fact was clearly
demonstrated at the ladies' minstrel en
tertainment given by the members of Gol
den West Booth in Native Sons 1 Hall last
night for the benefit of St. Patrick's ba
zaar.
When the curtain rose the house was
crowded, in fact, many persons in the rear
of the hall had been shifting uneasily
from one foot to another waiting anx
iously for the show to begin and envying
their more fortunate fellow-beings who
had come early enough to secure
seats. The scene on the stage, while made
up wholly of gaudy colors, was so harmo
niously blended as to be most pleasing'to
the eye. There was a bewildering array
of scarlet coats and waistcoats against a
dark green background of palms and
ferns framed in by smiling facesâ smiling
and pretty, even though they were black
ened and polished till they rivaled ebony
and disfigured by abnormally large paint
ed red mouths. There was a clash from
tambourines and cymbals, a murmur of
delighted applause from the audience, and
the show began.
Of course, as in all good minstrel shows,
music held sway. The coon song, the top
ical song and the sentimental song were
right there, and there was just enough of
merry jokes and witty sayings and bright
local hits to evenly balance things. The
coon girls were well up in their work.
They laughed, flouted, jigged and rolled
eyes which looked large and white in the
black cork setting in a manner which
would have done credit to the most pol
ished belles of the plantation. The la
dies, however, may not wear all the lau
rels of the occasion, as one of the hits of
the evening was made by Master Fay
Dougherty, a juvenile member of the sex
which is allowed to vote and smoke cigar
ettes, who appeared as a swell masher,
rigged in a style that would win any cake
walk, and strutted across the stage, i
swung his cane, swelled out pompously
and sang about his "baby" in a manner
which drove the audience frantic.
The programme was aa follows;
Opening overture by thÂ« entire company; "I
Loved You Bettor Than You Knew." Miss M.
P. Westhaus; "Mammy's Little Pumpkin-
Colored Coons," Nellie Oaks: "Sweet Antoin
ette." B. Hanlon; "Honey. Does You Love
Yer Man?" Mable Norton: "Love's Serenade."
Mrs. M. Frances Brennan: "I'm the Warmest
Member In the Land." Mamie Sheehan: "I
Love You Best." J. O'Brien: "Ambolina Snow."
Newman Sisters; "Sunset," Mlfs Etta O'Brien:
"That Black Man From Troy," Misses Jessie
and Janette Finnic; fancy dancing. Miss V.

Cross; "I Don't Care If You Nebber Come

Empire State." Kittle McShane: "On the Banks
of the Wabash," Miss Alice Garsen.
Miss A. Hoyne made a first-rate con
versationalist and Misses Jessie Finnle
and Kittic McShane. Mable Norton and
Tessie Smith handled the bones, while
Misses Mamie Wells. Jeannette Flnnie,
Mamie Sheehan and Xellie Oakes pounded

HOW THE HOSTILE SHIRS ARE MOVING,
THE SAX FRAXCTSCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 1898.THE GOVERNOR'S INITIAL
ORDER TO THE TROOPS
Enrolled Members of the Organized Division of me National
Guard of California Get the First Chance to Enlist in
the Volunteer Army of the United States.
Other Enlistments Will Be Received to Again Recruit the Guard to Its Normal Strength.
The Commander in Chief Directs That Four Batteries of Heavy Artillery Be
Immediately OrganizedâOrder to Open Emergency Rolls.
AFTER TWO BATTERIES.
Late last evening General R. H. Warfield, commanding Second Bri
gade, N. G. C, received orders from the Governor to at once proceed to
enroll two batteries of heavy artillery, 200 men in each battery, for service
under the quota of troops called for by the War Department. Such men
must volunteer and enlist for two years, unless sooner discharged. Mem
bers of the National Guard will be given the preference in volunteering.
Only physically qualified men between the ages of 18 and 45 years need
present themselves as volunteers.
Of the four batteries of heavy artillery called for, one company will
be recruited in Los Anjreles. one in Sacramento and two in San Fran
cisco and Oakland. Applicants can present themselves at any time after
10 o'clock this morning, at the old armory on Market street, between
Ninth and Tenth streets.
MAP FOR THE WAR DE
PARTMENT.
Captain Carrington, First "United
States Infantry, now on duty â with
the California National Guard, ha 3
been directed by the Secretary of
War to forward to the War De
partment Immediately a map of
California, showing the railroad
lines of the State and also the
towns in which regiments, com
panies or other organizations of
the Guard are stationed. In ac
cordance with instructions Cap
tain Carrington yesterday trans
mitted a map on which was delin
eated the location of every organ
ization of State troops.
THE VOLUNTEERS.
State Troops to Go Into
Camp at San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
Bright and early yesterday morning
General Barrett's headquarters were
opened and another day of active work
was commenced. Captain Carrington,
Colonels Bush and Burgin were busy
during the early part of the day pre
paring a report of the equipments, sup
plies and ammunition to be forwarded
to the Government. These reports were
made out on large official blanks, of
the classification order, which will be
in all probability telegraphed East.
Shortly after noon, the Governor, ac
companied by the adjutant-general', ar
rived at headquarters, and he was
handed a copy of the letter of instruc
tions from Pecretary of War Alger
This letter, which is a copy of the one
mailed on Monday from the "War De
partment, was furnished the Governor
by The Call, which had it telegraphed
here by Its Washington correspondent.
The Governor, It was ascertained be
fore his arrival at headquarters, had
held a conference with the Attorney-
General.
Colonel J. F. Smith of the First In
fantry was one of the early arrivals
at headquarters and was closeted for
some time with the Governor, as was
Lieutenant-Colonel Patton of Los An
geles of the newly organized volunteer
cavalry regiment of that county. Cap
tain D. A. Smith, the adjutant of the
Fifth Infantry, reported to General
Barrett that the new uniforms pur
chased by the State for the Fifth had
been turned over to him. He desired
to know what disposition to make of
them. Cantain Smith said that if the
men were to be ordered out and mus
tered into the United States service he
thought that their present uniforms
would suffice, and he did not see the
use of issuing the new ones to the men.
The old uniforms were good enough
for the soldiers to ficht- travel and
THE SAM FKAJNUISCU CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 189 S.
sleep in for. the present without using
the new ones.
Lieutenant-Colonel George Peppy of
the Governor's staff was also at head
quarters. During the fore and after
noon there was a continual stream of
officers and civilians pouring into head
quarters who desired information and
a chance to enlist. The commander-in
chief, Generals Barrett and Warfield
and Captain Carrington were busy re
ceiving and sending dispatches and at
tending to the numerous detail duties
attendant upon their offices. The
scenes presented were those erf anima
tion, and upon the arrival of The Call's
special war bulletins, which are posted
every hour in the adjutant-general's
office, the officers congregated around
them and eagerly discussed the latest
information from the seat of war.
Sergeant H. R Sullivan of B Com
pany, First Infantry, of this urv, ar
rived at headquarters about 2 o'clock
and reported to the adjutant-general
that his company on Tuesday night had
passed upon thirty-two applications for
membership in the company and select
ed fifteen new men. The non-com
missioned officers of the company are
acting as a board of investigation, and
they are using the same prec; tion to
select only men best fitted for the ser
vice as is done in times of peace. Ser
geant Sullivan reported the greatest
patriotism and eagerness to serve the
Government existing among the rank
and file of his company, and, in fact,
a similar spirit pervades the remaining
rank and file of the entire regiment.
Many of those who called at head
quarters to see the ranking officers of
thi j National Guard upon other than
military business were denied an audi
ence, as the urgent press of Govern
ment business prevented their being
heard.
Stf-ckton and Sacramento and other
points in the State were in constant
communication with the Governor over
the long-distance telephone. All of
these conferences wr- held in the Gov
ernor's private audience rooms and
their nature was closely guarded and
kept secret from the press.
Lieutenant Sydney Amos Cloman, U.
S. A., who has charge of the corps of
cadets at the University of California,
called at headquarters to pay his re
spects and ascertain the latest infor
mation from the front. Rabbi Voor
sanger also called upon the Governor
and held a private conference of short
duration with the State's chief execu
tive. It is thought that his visit was
relative to matters pertaining to the
Red Cross organization. The eminent
rabbi was followed by Colonei Choyn
ski, who Joined the group of staff offi
cers in General Barrott's anteroom
Major Naphtaly of Genpral Warfleld's
staff was also among the officers at
headquarters.
The Governor was cal'ed upon by
several persons who desired to have an
audience relative to civil business, but
he did not see them, and he issued the
strictest orders to admit no one, as his
time was entirely occupied in the con
sideration of purely military matters.
The Governor was In conference dur
ing the afterno-on witii Generals Bar
GOVERNOR BUDD'S FIRST ORDER.
About 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon Adjutant-General
Barrett, acting under the instructions of Governor Budd, issued
the following letter from headquarters, which explains itself:
San Francisco, April 26, 1898.
The following circular of instructions is issued
for the information and guidance of all concerned:
A call will soon be made by the President of the
United States upon the Governor for two regiments
and two battalions of infantry and four batteries of
heavy artillery â in all about 4000 men â perhaps for
service without the State. Such men must be vol
unteers and enlist in the army of the United States
for two years, unless sooner discharged. Members
of the National Guard will be given the preference
in volunteering, and present formations will be pre
served as far as practicable. All officers, both com
pany and regimental, must be appointed by the
Governor. It is absolutely essential that only physi
cally qualified men between the ages of 18 and 45
should volunteer, and those with families dependent
upon them for suppcrt should not be allowed to
volunteer. Report at once to general and also to
division headquarters direct number of men in each
of your companies qualified as above and who will
volunteer. Also open emergency rolls for as many
as will volunteer of like qualified men. The Na
tional Guard must be recruited and maintained even
after these 4000 men are furnished, as we must
always be prepared for duty, and there may be a de
mand for troops for the defense of our coast. By
order commander-in-chief.
A. W. Barrett, Adjutant-General.
The letter was the result of a long conference held by
Governor Budd with his trusted military advisers. This ac
tion was taken in anticipation of the orders from the East,
which are expected at any time.
rett, Dickinson and Warfield and Cap
tain Carrington, U. S. A. At 4 o'clock
Governor Budd gave ov* the following
statement:
"The letter of instructions sent out
by Secretary Alger has been under
consideration. This is not a formal
consideration of the letter, however,
for that will be impossible until I
have received it officially from the
War Department. However, I take
it that the telegraphed copy of the
letter furnished me by The Call is
exactly similar in wording 1 and lan
guage to the one that has been
mailed me by Secretary Alger. In
the letter it says: 'The rendezvous
for your State will be in San Fran
cisco. If for any cause it is found
necessary to change point of concen
tration your recommendation is re
quested.' "
There is no haste at present and
no action can be taken by myself
until I receive the letter, but at pres
ent I am of the opinion that one reg
iment at least will rendezvous at
Los Angeles, and the remainder, in
all probability, at San Francisco.
The letter received by the press is,
as I understand it, a circular letter
that has been sent out to all the Gov
ernors, and the letter of details, re
ferred to in the dispatch of Monday,
that I received from Secretary Alger,
is on its way here.
Colonel Patton held a f onference with
Governor Budd late in the afternoon,
and at Its conclusion he gave cut for
publication the statement that he had
been assured that in the event of the
National Guard being ordered East, th.3
Regiment of Southern Colifornia Vol
unteer Cavalry would be given the
preference of the second call, and, in
fact, would practically form the nu
cleus of a new National Guard.
Captain Carrington, U. S. A., was
first made acquainted with the fact
that he had been detailed by the United
States Government to muster in the
State troops through one of The Call's
Special War Bulletins. He said: "I
don't know until I receive my official
orders whether I shall open my office
here or in Los Angeles. I will prob- >
ably have offices in both places. I
will open my office in this city near the
armory and employ a force c-f clerks
and rush the business through."
Captain Carrington was of the opin
ion that the law governing the muster
ing of men into service would be some
what modified in many particulars.
Generals Warfield, Last and Muller
will be requested to furnish from their
brigades companies to- man the heavy
artillery. General Warfield is expected
to furnish two companies and the other
brigades one company each.
The news of the blowing up of the
California Powder Works at Santa
Cruz created considerable excitement
at headquarters. Regarding the rumor
that the explosion had been due to
some Spanish subject, General Barrett
said that the information he had re
ceived waa too meager to permit of his
expressing an opini

FEARLESS RIDERS.
A Regiment of California Rangers
May Be Offered.
The official call for volunteers from
California embraces only infantry and
heavy artillery, but it is possible that
an organization of mounted men,
known as the California Rangers, may
be accepted in addition to the regular
quota.
The organizers of the regiment,
among them George W. Fox, H. D.
Knight and Thomas O'Brien, assert
that 800 rangers have been recruited
and that the material is the best.
George W. Fox, an ex-soldier of the
Union army, who participated in many
of the campaigns of the Civil W T ar,
will probably command the rangers.
He has been recommended for a colonel's
commission. Many of the enlisted
men of the regiment are fearless riders
and good marksmen. The regiment is
to be recruited from the State at large
and when the enrollment is complete
the organization will be tendered to the
Secretary of War.

MUSTER ROLL OF THE RED CROSS LEAGUE INCREASING
RED CROSS IN SCHOOLS.
Rev. Dr. John Coyle Makes a Most Timelu and Valu
able Suggestion.
Editor of The Call â Dear Sir: Allow me to congratulate you on the
splendid movement The Call has inaugurated, that has culminated in the
organization of the Red Cross Sanitary Commission of California. I am
deeply interested in the work. -
It was my privilege during the war to be in charge of the Fifth
Corps, headquarters Sanitary Commission, Army of the Potomac. I
know something of the work done by that organization for our brave
boys at the front.
The full history- of the Sanitary Commission will never be written.
Of the number of lives saved and sufferings alienated none know save
the recording angel. Its daily history-, however, was written upon the
memories of the men whose wounds were healed, whose lives were saved,
and whose health was restored by the kindly ministers of this society,
and it found its reward in the lasting gratitude of those saved through
its agency.
Its most valuable opportunity comes while cannon are yet booming
and musketry is still rattling; where life is as cheap as air and the dead
and wounded are falling thick as autumn leaves; when the army is pur
sued or is pursuing: when the wounded perforce are lying neglected on
the field â then the sanitary agent becomes an angel of mercy to the men
whose lives are slowly ebbing away.
Again, when the wounded are consigned to the hospital the daily
visits of the agent, bringing help and sympathy, are highly prized by men
weak with suffering on beds of pain.
This help comes in letters written to loved ones at home, clothing
distributed, delicacies supplied, so essential to the sick, but impossible
to the army bill of fare.
The point of this letter is this: The Berkeley High School has the
honor of being the first school in the State to organize a Sanitary Com
mission.
It was organized yesterday (Monday), on the same day as the Red
Cross Sanitary Commission of California, Could there not be a similar
society organized in every High School in California?
I feel certain if you would send this thought down the line the thou
sands of patriotic young men and women in our High Schools would re
spond by organizing a Sanitary Commission in each school, each society
to be auxiliary to the central organzation in San Francisco.
Let us give the girls and boys a chance. If they cannot go to the
front they can send. And they will send not alone their sympathy, but
their benefactions, which will be the exponent of their love of country.
Their efforts will meet with a generous response from fathers and
mothers whose boys have gone to the front to defend our flag.
The question will be asked by many, How much ought I to give to
aid this organization? ' I would reply by asking. How much would you
give if your boy was the first to fall on the field of Cuba and the first to
feel the touch of the kindly hand of this organization as it stopped his
bleeding wound or snatched him from the jaws of the deadly yellow
fever. JOHN COYLE. D.D.,
President Berkeley High School Sanitary Commission.
SILENT HEREOS.
There are other heroes than those \
stirred by martial sounds und urged on
by roar of battle. Greater sacrifices are |
made for the nation than those under j
the inspiration of a mad charge against
an enemy's belching puns. It is easy to '
fight, aye. easy to die â when under the
stimulus of shrieking bullet, rattling i
musketry and the roar f>i conflict. It is
after all this â after the red tide has j
swept across the field, after the excite- j
ment of animal courage, after the de- â¢
sire for blood â that true heroism shows
itself in the silent suffering during thos.e
long and agonizing hours of patient !
waiting which ends in death or leaves j

DIVIDED
AGAINST
ITSELF
The Alameda First
Christian Church
in Trouble.
It Is Tottering to a Fall
Through Inward Dis
sensions.
The Majority of the Congrega-
Hion Want to Retain the
Rev. Mr. Wickham.
NOT WANTED BY MINORITY
Consequently th<Â» Majority of the
Members HÂ«ve Left the Church
in a Body.
The denomination In Alameda County,
known as the Christian Church seems
to have fallen upon evil days. Strife
and dissension hold the fort in two of
the folds and on one occasion a !
"brother" invited another "brother"
into the anteroom to settle their differ
ences a la Fitzsimmons and Corbect. j
This little incident happened at a |
prayer meeting and needless to say
the affairs of the church were not im
proved thereby.
In Oakland the members of the Cen
tral Christian Church have locked
horns over the sayings and doings of '
the Rev. Edwards Davis, while in Ala
meda the First Christian Church is
entirely disrupted over the retention or j
dismissal of the Rev. J. A. Wickham. |
For some time back a minority," led by
Trustees Speddy and Lorentzen, have
been trying to get Rev. Mr. Wickham
to resign, while the minority, led by
Elder Thomson and Mrs. Dill, have
been anxious to retain him. The cli
max came last Sunday, when the Rev.
Henry V. Morgan notified Rev. Mr.
Wickham that if he preached in the
First Church that day there would be
a disturbance that would not be quelled
in a hurry. Rev. Mr. Wickham did
not preach and his followers remained
away from the sacred edifice almost in
a body.
A meeting of the seceders was held
last evening, > and as a result, Ger
mania Hall on Lincoln avenu.V, near
Park street, has been secured, and
services will be held there next Sun
BERKELEY, April 26. 1898.
I ried through life.
Yet all the heroism of war does not
i lie with those who bear arms in their
nation's defense. There is a true cour
1 age that lives not in history except as a
result, that brings but collective glory,
that gives no personal honors. It is
1 that quiet heroism which induces
shrinking womanhood to face the hor
rors of the bloody field strewn with
' ghastly remains of humanity, to enter
the shambles of an army operating
j room or to carry its blessed ministration
ito the pestilential wards of the fever
hospital in order that some man's suf
fering may be alleviated.
Who is there that has lain on the sick
I bed that has not felt the gentle touch of
j a woman's hand and been the better for
day. The minority has been given
undisputed possession of the Park
street building and also the debt
owing by the church. The latter body
is said to be formulating charges
against Rev. Mr. Wickha-m, which will
be laid before the Ministers' Union in
this city. His followers will of course
espouse his cause and another wordy
warfare is sure to follow.
The troubles of the First Christian
Church date back to over a year ago.
At that time the Rev. Henry V. Mor
gan was the pastor, but after some
friction he resigned and subsequently
opened a temperance saloon in San
Francisco. He still continues to make
his home in Alameda and attended the
First Church.
When the Rev. Mr. Wickham was In
stalled as pastor of the church he at
first gave entire satisfaction to the con
gregation. Later on some of the
wealthy members of the flock thought
they discovered he was not powerful
enough at exhorting, and they gently
hinted that a change would be for the
better. As one lady member put it:
"Brother Wickham would make a first
class farmer, but I don't think much
of his abilities as a preacher."
Accordingly. Brother Wickham was
asked to resign, but backed by the ma
jority of his (lock, he refused to do so.
It was during an animated d:~cussion
of the pros and cons of this weighty
subject that Elders Speddy and T'.om
son lost their tempers and the Invita
tion to adjourn to the anteroom was
given.
The minority refuses to discuss the
trouble, but all assert that they had
ample reason for asking for "Brother"
Wickham's resignation, and say that
they will prove their case when the
matter Is laid before the Ministers'
Union.
"We loved our pastor, and were well
satisfied with him," said a leader of the
majority last night; "so why should we
want to part with him? His preaching
suited us, and when it came to a ques
tion of disruption we followed him,
against his advice. Seven or eight
wealthy members of the congregaritn
have been a disturbing element for a
long time, and with them is the Rev.
I Henry V. Morgan. The latter gentle
i man opei (da branch of his temperance
I saloon in Alameda to-night, and now
that his business is centered here I
think he v&nts to be pastor of the First
j Church rgsin. Well, he can be, so far
ias we are concerned. We have secured
Germanla Hall, and Sunday next you
will find almost the entire church there.
"As things now stand, there is no
pastor to the First Christian Church,
nor is there hitely to be. Brother Wick
ham was prepared to officiate last Sun
day, but he received a message from
Brother Morgan to the effect that If he
I occupied the pulpit there would be a
rattling of dry bones that would not
be to the edification of the congrega
tion. In consequence, there were no
services held, at least, not that I know
of. Then we tried to hit on a compro
mise, but the minority held out for
Brother Wickham's resignation, and we
were determined to stand by him, and
we will."
It is, therefore, plainly to be seen that
the First Christian Church of Alameda
Is "a house divided against itself."

it? Who, "when pain and anguish
wrung the brow," has not felt tho pres
ence of the "minist'ring angel?"
It is that those brave boys in blue
who have gone to the front to fight your
battles may receive these gentle minis
trations of the Society of the Red
Cross has been organized, and it is that
the nursing, the patient care and the
necessary delicacies so needful in the
sickroom may be furnished to perhaps
your own son, brother or fathe", that
you are called upon to give as best you
can from your store of vorld's goods
that the good work may be carried on
without ceasing to the end of the war.
The way is open for every one to help.
It may be the gold coin t om the ple
thoric purse of the wealthy merchant,
whose business is guarded by the sol
diers at the front, or it may be the
penny from the grimy hand of the
schoolboy yet too young to understand
the full measure of the blessing of gov
ernment, but whatever the source the
contribution means that some fevered
brow is cooled and some pain-racked
body is eased.
California will furnish many heroes
whose names will be heard when the
Hispano-American war is spoken of by
future generations, and it should be the
duty of Californians to see to it that by
the side of those heroes' names is re
corded the fact that from the Golden
State went the means which not only
alleviated the suffering of the men who
fought, but which also nursed back to
life and health those who might have
filled unknown graves through lack of
proper care after the brunt of battle had
been borne.
The start has been made. The State
League has been organized. Now let
every city, every town, every school in
the commonwealth, form an organiza
tion and send such a grand contribution
that the peaceful auxiliary may have
even greater victories than those of
arms.
A STRONG LEAGUE.

A WELCOME ANGEL.
A Battle - Scarred Hero
Tells of the Blessings
of Army Nurses.
"What do I think of the Red Cross
League?" said Colonel William R.
Smedberg, as he leaned back in his
office chair. "Well, we had no league
during the Civil War, but the relief so
cieties did noble work. Every one who
was not a combatant assisted directly
or indirectly in the hospitals or with
the ambulances in the field. If one
only knew what a blessed thing the
sipht of a petticoat coming across the
field of battle is to a wounded soldier
my enthusiasm would be pardoned.
"Do I believe that women nurses
should be sent to the front? Let me
amplify a little. Certainly no woman
should be upon the fcrrefrout of battle.
A male nurse would be more In place
there.
"It is the women who have had ex
perience of life, the mothers of fami
lies, who do the best work. The
wounded must be treated as helpless
children.
"Right here let me interpolate that
Walt Whitman wrote about this very
subject: 'The presence of a good-na
tured middle-aged or '*erly woman,
the magnetic touch of hands, the ex
pressive features of the mother, the si
lent soothing of her presence, her
words, her' knowledge and privileges
arrived at only through having had
children are precious and final quall
ncations.' It is a natural* faculty that
is required. It is not merely having a
genteel young woman at a table in a
ward. One of the finest nurs.-s I met
was a red-faced, illiterate oM woman.
I have seen her take the pour wasted
boys so tenderly up in her arms.
"On May 6, 1 > *"> 4 . I was wounded at
the battle of the Wilderness, and, after
lying in a hospital there for three
weeks, I was shipped on a transport to
Washington with fifteen hundred other
wounded men. And her<- I had my
first experience of sanitary work. God
bless it! Of course the Government
furnishes the necessaries, but even
its best efforts are often inadequate
unless supplemented by contributions
of organized and generous-hearted be
nevolence. On our transport we found
all sorts of grateful comforts that the
wounded soldier knows full well how
to appreciate.

The most amusing of all the contests
was the last race. All the ladles, fifteen
In number, put up a job on the judge,
who before the start warned them to run
fair. When they got the word "Go" they
all started off on a slow walk, but after
the three-quarter post was reached three
<>f the contestants broke Into a run, and
Mrs. Dignan came In ahead.
Then followed the distribution of a
number of gate prizes, the first being
awarded to Meta Vuight of Sunset Re

The pleasant outing was under the di
rection of George Farnham, W. S. Potter
and C. H. Kornbeck of Oriental Encamp
ment, the committee of arrangements,
assisted by Colonel Brower. commanding
the Second Regiment of Patriarchs Mili

Odd Fellows' Hall was crowded last
night by an audience of members of the
ordor and their friends that assembled
to enjoy the entertainment that had been
prepared by the committee on entertain
ment in celebration of the anniversary of
American Odd Fellowship. The hall was
very tastefully decorated with banners
and bunting and presented a beautiful
appearance.
There was a patriotic overture by
Yanke's orchestra, after which Deputy
Grand Master Karl ('. Hruftfck delivered a
short address of welcome in which he
made an allusion to the war, and his pa
triotic remarks moved the vast audience
to a pitch of wildest enthusiasm. The
Knickerbocker Quartet rendered vocal se
lections and on recall sang "The Star
spangled Banner" and "America" with
tine effect. This was followed by selec
tions on a chime of bells by Miss Nellie
B. Waters, and when she rendered pa
triotic airs American flaps were waved
from the rifiht and left front entrance to
the stage and by an arrangement by
Major Jaegher of the Patriarchs Militant
as the lady played the chorus of "The
Star-spangled Banner" a large American
flag was unfurled from the flies and
floated in graceful folds over the per
former, amid the wild plaudits of the
audience.
The principal speaker of the evening,
Frank McGowan of Farnsworth Lodge,
delivered a fifteen minute speech, in
which he drew attention to the rise of
Odd Fellowship in the United States, and
in the course of his remarks said that
Odd Fellowship in addition to teaching
charity and love of man for mankind
teaches loyalty to country and teaches
patriotism.
The deputy grand master called atten
tion to the fact that 11. Rugen, who was
on the programme for a cornet solo,
would not be present, because he is a
member of the band of the First United
States Infantry, and is now at the front
with his regiment.
Miss May Culkn, Miss Edith Hank,
Miss Florence Connor and Miss Jean
nette Partridge, the Arcadian Quartet,
charmed the audience with vjcal selec
tions, after which Professor F. L. Purdy
favored with a tenor solo, "Adieu Marie."
A. P. Van Duzer of Apollo Lodge then
delivered an address on the objects of the

MISS ISABEL DENNISON.
The First Contributor to the
Red Cross Fund.
Dear Call: I am glad that I was the first little girl to contribute to
the fund for taking care of our brave soldiers. I am rather lucky, any
way, for I was the first member of the Society of the Children of the
American Revolution on this coast, and also the first treasurer of the Val
entine Holt Society of the C. A. R.
We children have done some patriotic work during the past year. We
have given $i>o toward taking care for always of the Mar' Washington mon
ument. We have presented a flag to the Deaf and Dumb Asylum at Berke
ley, and now we are raising a fund for a monument to the martyrs of the
prison ships.
You will find that although a girl of the Valentine Holt Society is first
to give to the Red Cross League, you have not heard the last of us yet.
Yours truly, # ISABEL DENNISON.

Choices Won.
There was one race on the card at In
i gleside yesterday well worth seeing. It
i was the mile and a half run. captured by
; Morellito and ridden in captivating fash
' ion by little Johnny Woods. The three
! year-old was pitted against Ostler Joe,
i Grady, Won't Dance and Flashlight, and
j the ring laid 3 to 1 about him. Ed Corri
; gan tried to repeat Monday's trick with
Won't Dance, and although the mare
caused a splash of excitement in the
stretch when squared for the wire, she
failed miserably when the shoe pinched.
Grady, with Cole up, made the pace and
was undeniably a good horse, but was
handicapped by lacK of experience in the
Baddle. At the far turn Woods on Mor
; ellito extricated himself from a bad
pocket and making his run with Ostler
â  Jou just. a,s the turn for home was round
ed, beat the black Montana horse with
Thorpe up a neck, driving hard. Grady
was, third, a head further away. Master
Woods earned a well-deserved round of
: applause for his finish. Won't Dance
was a close fourth.
It was the second of the charity days,
and the attendance showed a slijjht im
provement. The track was rather deep,
and most of the races were run as though
the riders all had waiting orders. As it
so happen* d, favorites took three purses.
A hand of hand-me-down maidens
started in the opening six furlong sprint,
with Joe Levy and Amasa holding first
call in the betting. In the stretch Thorpe
strolled along leisurely *'ith Joe Levy,
and won easily from Rosa, a 12 to 1 shot.
Amasa likes four furlongs.
The betting on the five furlong scram
ble for two-year-olds was fretful and
nervous, finally resulting in Santello.
with Piggott up, being sent to the post
a 7 to 5 favorite, backed from 5 to 2. In
the run home Clayton got up and beat
the first choice a length in 1:02^4. Into
the stretch Bonibel looked a pos.si.ble win
ner, but passed it up. The winner re
ceded from 3 to 2 to 5 to 2.
Five started in the mile and a quarts
run, and it was a very Blobbery affair.
The Lodestar money came [n early, cut
ting the odds to S to 6, and the boys on
the other hors. s rode ;<s though" they
hoppd the favorite would win. There was
no pace, and in the stretch "iskeets* 1 .Mar
tin on Lodestar drew away, winning
easily from Claudius. Tulare was a
bang-up third. Metaire made the pact
for a mile and th< n "blew up."
â ; Fonsovannah and Morinel were
scratched from the mile pursp run, Iprv
ing it a throe-horse event. Torsida, with
Thorpe In the Baddle, ruled a strong fa
vorite !n the betting, and in a hard drive
downed the Coxrijcan entry Sardonic a
short bead. Glorian was close up.
The final six furlonsr selling dash caus
ed quite a commotion. it looked a
"cinch" for Conijran's recent acquisition.
Chihuahua, which was made a 8 to 5
chance, but in a drive the SO to 1 shot
Loch NV'ss beat the favorite out a
head. Piggott piloted the winner.
TRACK NOTES.
The last race proved a costly one for Kd
Corrlgan. .' He' ls reported to have lost $COO on
Chihuahua, and then Tom Cooke, owner of
Break o' Day. had the temerity to claim Mr.
Corrigans gelding, which was entered to be
sold for ' $400. It v.a- i =:hif fir?t appearance In
the colors of the fhlcac') turfman.
There was a heavy play <>n Rebel .Tack In the
betting on the first event, but Mclntyre failed
to make connections.
Trarpean has a thrr>,-it affection, cause. l by
Fickn^ss. which accounts for his stopping
proclivities.
Had Clawson, nn Sardonic, let the j>n.-.- |n
:ii mg behind Torsld â¢
Glorian, the Corrlgan entry would have about
landed the purse.

MAY HAVE TO
FORCE THE SAFE
Treasurer Reis Unable to Get
at Nearly Half a Million
Dollars.
.:,â¢â â 
The Grand Jury Told How Wldber
Performed the Act of Transmut
ing Silver Into Gold.
â  â¢ -'â â¢-'â â . "'"'<
Treasurer Reis expects to open the of
fice of the city treasury to-day, and will
at once begin to receive deposits from the
various city officers. Heretofore it has
been the custom to issue salary demands
on the Saturday preceding the first of the
month, but owing to the disturbance cre
ated in the Treasurer's office by the de
falcation of Widber, they will not be is
sued until next Monday. All other claims,
however, will be paid as heretofore.
Owing to the accidental disturbance of
the combination of one of the big safes in
the Treasurer's vault. It may be neces
sary to bore into it in order to get at the
money locked up in it. It contains $424,
003 50. This is the safe out of which Wlu
bcr stole about $76,000. Chief Lees is cred
ited with the responsibility of this con
tretemps. If the safe has to be forcibly
opened it will be a thirty hours' task.
Treasurer Reis has agreed to accept the
statements of those who counted the
money in this safe when the count was
made to discover the extent of Widber's
stealings, subject, however, to a count by
himself "when the safe iÂ« opened.
Judge Troutt has been generally credit
ed with having assisted the Mayor and
Auditor in the count made of the money
in possession of Widber's office on March
25. As a matter of fact, he has not as
sisted in this count for nt least five
months past. It has been the custom to
have a different Superior Judge assist in
the count every month. At the last count
of Widber'a cash Judge Bahrs represent
ed the Superior Court.
It has been a matter of speculation as
to how Widber managed to make the ex
change of silver for the gold in the sacks
In the safe without' attracting the atten
tion of the attaches of the office. At the
investigation before the Grand Jury Mon
day this mystery was explained. It ap
pears that Widber had prepared himself
by having the necessary amount of sil
ver in his private office. He would con
vey a 15000 sack of gold into his otÃce un
der his coat, make the substitution, and
then carry the sack of silver back into
the safe in the same manner that he had
abstracted the gold. He always chose a
time when there was no one but himself
or only one of the deputies in the office.

duct the excursion that will go down to
the different summer resorts and camp
ing places on the narrow-gauge line to

the Fourteenth-street narrow-gauge sta
tion in Oakland and the 8:20 train from
Park-street station, Alameda. Stops will
be made at Boulder Creek and at all the

ADVOCATES THE
DARWIN THEORY
Rev. T. C. Williams Scoffs
at the Creation of
Man.
Says That His Coming Was
the Final Term of Zoologi
cal Evolution.
The Pacific Unitarian Conference
Opened Last EveningâTrie Pro
gramme for To- Day.
Rev. Theodore C. Williams is evidently
a stanch supporter of Darwin and his
theories, if the remarks which he made
before the fourteenth session of the Pa
cific Unitarian Conference are to be be
lieved.
The gentleman was on the programme
for the opening lecture, and he announc
ed to his audience that he had chosen for
his subject "LJid Jesus Protest Against
Miracle? Did He Reject the Supernat
ural?"
He spoke at length against miracles,
trying to show that it was against the
scientific luws to have such tnings hap
pen. As he drifted on in his subject he
came to the creation of man, at which
time he made the following statement:
"God always works by universal laws,
and does not accomplish his ends without
means. He has no sudden 'Mat lux.' but
the slow production of the light giving j
suns and stars. There is no 'let us make j
man from tne dust of the ground,' but |
the appearance of man is the .inal term
of zoological evolution. Ti.ere is no "res
urrection of the flesh'; and man's only
hope of immortality is in some higher
law than the flesh manifest. There is !
no prophet, no Bible separated in kind
or in manner of production from all other
men and books or without a background
of historic evolution."
He further said that Jesus is supposed
to be the example of all, but it was im
possible to follow him and copy his ac
tions if he started to doing supernatural
things.
His paper was listened to with consid
erable Interest by the large number of
people present.
The conference, which is being held at
the Second Unitarian Church, Will con- !
tlnue for three days. The closing day, |
Saturday, the delegates have been in- |
vited by' the ladies of the First Unitarian I
Church to attend a lecture and recital at i
their church. At t..at time Alfred W.
Martin will sptuk on "Wagner and the
Music of the Future."

THE ALASKA TRADE HERE.
Information From the Bureau Gives
Assurance of Success for
This City.
The bureau having charge-of the Alas
ka trade for this city gives out encourag
ing reports, and adds that if the mer
chants only aid the bureau in its work
a good deal of the trade can be secured
for this port.
The report of the bureau is as follows:
While some (if the merchants who h;ive
been approached for assistance toward the
support of the Alaska Information Bureau of
th.Â» California StatÂ» Board of Trade Insist
that the hn.,m lias burst, yet we learn from
th.- committee'! headquarters that people are
dropping in (mm day to day from all points
of the compass who are on their way to
Alaska, and that v majority of them are out
fitting in thin city. The advertising done by
the bureau la bringing a good many inquiries,
and all indications go to show that the In
clination of those poing by way of the Yukon
is to ship fr..m Sun Francisco. The commit
tee is fully Informed as to the advantages
which San Francisco has to offer as an out
fitting point, and Is losing no effort to impress
Its correspondents accordingly.
The advance guard of a party of about forty
from Boston are now In the city, and will se
cure thi>ir outfits here. They have inves
tigated the situation at the different ports on
the Pacific and concede that Pan Francisco
has better goods, at lower prloeK, than any
other point is offering.
One of the latest inquiries is from Reading.
Pa., by Henry P. Green, who writes on be
half of himself and five others who are go-
Ing to Dawson, to know what advantages San
Francisco can offer In the way of outfitting
material, including mining machinery, trans
portation facilities, boats, shelter tents, cloth
ing, provisions, etc.. etc.
The bureau believes that with one-half the
support that was given to the old Alaska
Trade Committee they could bring the ma
jority of the Yukon travel this way.
An agent Is out among t^e merchants solicit
ing for subscriptions, and is meeting with
some success. Since our last report Horleln &
Krurab, Ames & Harris, B. T. Allen. Johnson
& Lock p. Murphy-'irant, L. Levy, the Alaska
Commercial Company, the Ferry Drug Com
pany, The Alaska Prospectors' Syndicate and
the Pacific Marine Supply Company have
come forward with subscriptions varying
from ?."â  to J2."< a month. The bureau Is en
eouragod by this support to enlarge its field
of aaafullMM, and if the subscriptions, which
aggregate $117 a month, are quadrupled, they
fp'-l that they can do San Francisco full Jus
tice in diverting travel this way.
Estates in Probate.
Samuol Goldstein, who died on the 21st
inst., left an estate valued at $15,000, to be
distributed among relatives.
Moses Franklin has left a $5000 estate, to
be distributed principally among the He
braic charitable institutions of the city.

SWALLOWED A
GOLD PIECE
Base Ingratitude of E. J.
Brooks, a Confirmed
Dope Fiend.
Robbed Mrs. Ornstein, an Old
Lady, Who Was to Give
Him Money.
He Was Chased and Captured and
Will Have to Answer a Charge
of Grand Larceny.
E. J. Brooks, a physical wreck from
the excessive use of morphine, was ar
rested yesterday about noon and book
ed at the City Prison on a charge of
grand larceny.
Brooks proved himself an ungrateful
scamp. At the corner of Leavenworth
and O'Farrell streets he went up to
Mrs. Ornstein, an old lady living at 703
Geary street, and her daughter, and
begged for money to enable him to get
a meal. His appearance enlisted the
sympathy of the old lady and she pull
ed out her purse and was about to
hand Brooks what she thought was a
25-cent piece, when her daughter said,
"Why, mother, that is a ten-dollar gold
piece."
Brooks grabbed hold of her hand and
snatched the gold piece. He ran south
on Leavenworth street and Mrs. Orn
stein raised an alarm. J. Morton of
207 Taylor street was close by, and
when he learned the facts he started
in pursuit of Brooks. He overtook him
at Taylor street, and notwithstanding
his struggles held him. A crowd had
Joined in the chase and began shout
ing for the police. Morton took Brooks
as far as his house, as he wanted to
get a police whistle, and while there
Brooks succeeded in breaking away
from him.
The chase was continued and after
running about three blocks Morton
overhauled Brooks and again got a
firm grip on him. He held him till Po
liceman J. F. Welch made his appear
ance and Brooks was taken to the
prison, Morton accompanying them.
Brooks was carefully searched at the
prison, but the ten-dollar gold piece
could not be found. He seemed to be
suffering pain and the conclusion was
arrived at that he had swallowed the
coin. When pressed to say what he
had done with the coin he refused to
answer.
Mrs. Ornstein called at the prison to

AMATEUR BOXING BOUTS.
The Excelsior and Manhattan Clubs
Entertain on Friday Evening.
Two amateur athletic clubs will clash
on Friday evening. The Excelsior Ath
letic Club and the Manhattan Athletic
Association will give boxing entertain
ments at their respective places of
amusement.
The Manhattans appear to be first in
the field, consequently the Excelsiors
should, by courtesy, have selected some
other date than the one named for their
athletic exhibition. Both clubs have ex
cellent programmes, and doubtless large
gatherings of sport lovers will be present
at each place. The event of the evening
at the Excelsior Club will be an eight
round contest between Billy Otts and
Jack Greenfield.
Nick Burley writes that Tom Sharkey
has amonc the men whom he defeated
the name of Nickâ not Old Nick, but
Nick Burley, the 160-pound smasher, who
is ready to meet Bob Fitzslmmons or any
other man who carries a title. Burley
says that the police stopped the fight in
the eig-hth round, and doubtless it was
fortunate for Nick that the officers were
so convenient to the ring.
Young Griffo, the harum-scarum pugil
ist of Australia, will meet "Bull" McCar
thy in a twenty-round contest before the
Sacramento Athletic Club this evening.
Griffo, although erratic, is unquestiona
bly a very clever boxer, and if his oppo
nent is fairly clever the members of the
club will be treated to a very pretty ex
hibition of clever hitting and "stopping.

HEALTH CATECHISM.
To Be Committed to Memory by All
Dyspeptics, Invalids and
Consumptives.
What is the first cause of nine-tenths
of all disease?
Imperfect digestion of food.
Why does imperfect digestion cause
disease of other organs?
Because blood, nerves, muscle, bone
and flesh are derived from the food we
e-it and digest. If digestion is perfect
the blood is pure, nerves and muscles
strong, flesh firm. If the digestion is
poor, the blood is supplied from haif-
digested, fermenting food, irritating
every nerve and organ. The result is,
sooner or later, organic disease, be-
cause every organ being poorly nour-
ished the weakest gives way first and
we have liver trouble, kidney com-
plaints, heart disease or consumption.
Is not dieting the usual and best
treatment to cure indigestion?
No, because the dyspeptic has been
starved long enough; what is needed
i is abundant nourishment, not the lack
!of it. The stomach and blood demand
nutriment, not bran crackers.
What is the best method of cure?
Plenty of wholesome food well di-
gested.
But how can a weak stomach digest
I plenty Qf wholesome food?
By taking with the food after each
meal certain harmless remedies which
are known to digest food and thug
nourish the biood and rest the weak
stomach.
What are these harmless remedies?
The most valuable are vegetable fer-
ments, pure pepsin. Golden Seal and
fruit salts. All of these are now com-
bined in the form of pleasant tasting-
tablets sold by druggists under the
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Are these tablets superior to the va-
rious liquid preparations so called dy-
spepsia cures?
Most decidedly, because all liquid
medicines become stale \vitb age and
lose whatever good qualities they may
have had originally, while the tablet re-
tains its properties indefinitely. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets can be carried in
the pocket, always at hand ready fop
use when traveling or at daily occupa-
tion. They cost but 50 cents and should
be kept in every family. They keep
the digestion perfect and save doctor's
bills by warding off disease.
Are Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
adapted to all forms of dyspesia?
Yes, because in all cases the troublo
results from indigested, fermenting
food. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets causa
the food to be digested before It has
time to ferment.
If you wish to know more about
them ask your druggist for a package
| and try them.

EASTERN
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
: NEW YORK, April 26.â Prices of (stocks i
ewung lazily upward to-day, covering about ,
the same range as in the downward course of !
yesterday. It was a traders market, as was j
that of yesterday. Xv operations on a large
'scale were ventured upon, nor Is there any
outside Interests in the market aside from
tome desultory buying of small lots through
commission houses. To-day's advance, how- j
ever, coon put a stop even to this, as the bid- j
ding of this character comes from bargain
hunters whose orders are placed upon a scale
of prices downward. The market was so nar
row that the buying for London account was
quite a conspicuous feature, though in itself
small, but this buying is rather significant in
spite of its small volume. It was . induced by
the declarations ot ' neutrality on the part of
Ureat Britain, France, and . Mexico and intima
tions ol a similar attitude suon to be adopted
by other powers. The demand for Americans
in London was stimulated also by the strength
of the general markets, which were active and
etrong on the easier money conditions. This
ttrength reflected from:. London .was. sufficient
to induce the local traders to take the bull side
tor a short turn. While there was no reaction
i>f any note during the day none of the promi
nent stocks made large net gains. A few less
active stocks . showed conspicuous movements.
Hpirlts preferred rose -'_ and Delaware and
luilMÂ»n and Detroit Gas 2 points each.
Sugar, Tobacco and the grangers made up the
liulk of the dealings. The money market con
tinues to attract much interest and attention.
Heseryes continue to l>e pretty closely held
tgainst future contingency. The demand from
the interior for currency, which . had almost
.ceased last week, has regained some force. It
is Impossible to forecast how far this demand
â will go, and It Is the main spring of the situa
tion. The United States Treasury has given
notice in effect that it needs all of its supply
of small currency, and the local banks are
obliged to meet the demand from the interior
almost altogether by shippinc gold. This is
likely to act as a check to that demand, for
bUli are desired rather than gold coin. There
was another advance In the rate of exchange
to-day, carrying it well above the gold import
point. The rate of discount In London and
Berlin was about equally lower to-day. Both
of these quotations reflect a subsidence of
rehenaion here ol the likelihood of any strin
gency. Probably Government payments for
purchases of war material made abroad are not
without some effect in giving strength to the
market.
The bond market showed weakness early in
the day, and there were later recoveries in
some cases, making the net changes mixed

markets generally were bettor, an upward
movement being led by consols and similar
stocks on the large arrivals of gold. But for
one weak spot the market might almost be de
scribed as healthy. After the recent shake
out the black spot is the West Australian min
ing market, where the difficulties of the opera
tor referred to yesterday are so huge that the
matter Is not yet finally arranged and may in
volve new failures.
The differences to be met exceed Â£25C.000.
Spanish and American securities were com
paratively neglected, but Canadian Pacifies and
Grand Trunks have been bought on rumors of

NEW YORK WHEAT MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 26.â During the afternoon
most of the early strength In Wheat was lost
through the efforts of scalpers to secure profits
on early purchases. May closed at $1 V',\,
against $1 25, the top price, and July at $1 00%,
after having sold at $1 02 J 2 near the opening.
Corn and Oats also eased off. Exports to
Europe were forty loads of Wheat and 140 loads
of Corn.
CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April With the Liverpool
Wheat market in a state of violent excitement
' and the price of the article for July delivery
equal to 6c a bushel higher than it closed last
nicht, it was naturally somewhat surprising
; when July, opened in this market to-day at an
advance of only 2%<g2%c. The buying fever
was not entirely chilled, however, and after
a moment's hesitation another cent was added
: to the price. Leading bull operators unloaded
: millions of bushels on this tempting swell and
I a 2c break followed. The Northwestern mar
! kets likewise gave evidel\ce of an oversupply
and toppled off 2@3c. Second Liverpool cables
showed a good decline, but Were offset by ad
'â  vances on the Continent, equal to 6V4@7%c at
; Antwerp. Bradstreet's report gave the world's
; visible supply at a decrease of 4,846,000 bushels
; and brought about a rally of lc, and traders
who were overloaded took every opportunity to
! lighten their load.
An advance of *4d In ocean freight, bring
â  ing the rate per bUÃhel up to 13V2d, New York
to United Kingdom ports, was the cause of
J the p latest weak phase of the market here
that brought it down to 93VÂ»c for July and
i prevented more than its fractional recovery.
During the opening excitement May Wheat
sold at Â»l 25, the highest price in several years.
i There was plenty for sale, and it eased off
slowly to 22>^, closing at Jl 23, a net gain
'of 3VÂ«c. July opened 2%iÂ£2V4c higher at 94%@
; 95c, advanced to 96c, declined to 93% c, closed at
>â  93%@93M>c, , a net gain of. %Â®lc. Letter reported
; cat*h sales of 400, bushels.
Corn was very strong and somewhat excited
1 for a while, but suffered as did all others of
I the speculative markets by heavy selllne by
! longs to realize profits. July closed unchanged.
Oats started strong and higher, but, like
Wheat and Corn, lost all advance under free
selling by longs. July closed unchanged."
Provisions -opened under the influence of the
excited demand abroad for all commodities of
American production. Liverpool made a fur
! ther advance of 6d to Is in bacon and 6d each
in lard and hams. The sellers were too numer
ous for prices to hold, and consequently the
i best prices of the day were : made at the be
ginning. Pork showed at one time 25c gain,
but only "Vie at the close. I July lard closed 2V4c
net higher and July ribs closed 2%c net lower.

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Are quoted at 27s 6d,
for the usual options, with a charter from
Portland at 355. The chartered Wheat fleet In
port has a registered tonnage of 3100, against
4600 tons on the same date last year; disen
gaged, 13,800 tons, against 83,000; on the way to
thin port, 227,800 tons, against 245.000.
WHEATâ The excitement continues, and it
is almost Impossible to give quotations except
those ruling on call, which govern the market
at the moment. With short stocks all over the
world, a scanty crop In this State and the gen
eral uncertainty regarding tonnage, the situa
tion is so confused that neither sellers nor
buyers know where they stand. The only quo
tation which can be givc-n with even an ap
proach to accuracy is for milling, which ranges
from $1 S5 to $1 90. The millers are drawing all
their supplies at the moment from the north
and will probably continue to do so, for Cali
fornia cannot supply them. Even the north is
running short and is seriously alarmed over
the heavy shipments to California. There are
lively times ahead In this grain.
The phenomenal advance on call continues,
as will be seen. The dealers are excited and
the market Is like a balloon.

would be Impossible at present to make a

BACKING UP THE PRESIDENT.
The President has assured the Re
publicans of Indiana that he intends
to stand by the sound money plank
of the St. Louis platform, and. In their
turn, the Republicans of Indiana have
notified the President that this is what
they expected of him, and that they
also expect that he will be firm in
his promise to maintain and extend the
merit system. In view of the immedi
ate pressure that spoils politicians in
Washington may bring to bear upon
the President, it would be well if the
example set by the Republicans of In
diana were followed by the Republicans
of other States. The President's incli
nations and promises as to civil service
reform are of the right kind, but a
little popular encouragement would not
come amiss to him nor Injure the
cause. â Harper's Weekly.

There is no lack of patriotism in Ala-
County, nnd while Pleasanton is
g !â â  organise a volunteer bngado ot'
N Uonal Guard companies In Oak
lnnd are constantly around their barracks
drilling nearly every evening and anx
iously awaiting t..e call to arms, which
they â¢ iriv.
Company A, Fifth Infantry, N. G. C. If?
ani ius that should it take the field it
â will be with its full complement of 103
men. "We have 68 members on our
rolls." said one of the officers to-day,
"and are now deluged with applications
fir enlistment frum well drilled ex-mem
who want to re-enlist in case the
Is called in-o active service.
Mentions are on file from men
Who desire t.> BO to the front. Of course
the preference will be given to ex-mem
bers where the age does not bar them.
If they are otherwise physically yuan
fled. 11
There is only one probability that may
dampen the ardor if the Oakland militia.
It is that should they go into camp they
may be commanded by some West Point
Graduate. This is an objection which
as been generally discussed. The boys
are very loyal to their officers and will
rebel against their being substituted by
strani whom they do not know ana
might not respect.
Company A expresses a very strong
sentiment in regard to its officers, and
Jill the members are generally averse to
having regular army officers as captains
over them. The company is looking for
ward confidently to being oidered into
service by the* ivernor very soon.
Major Hays is particularly proud of the
epirit existing in his command, and says
that when the Governor asks for the
number and character of troops availa
ble, Company A will make a line show-
Ing.
D. M. Connor of Pleasanton is so im
bued with the war s;Â»irit that he has is
sued the following call:
"One hundred men wanted who
are willing to enter the army in the

Ijes of 18 and 45 years,

ing to serve as infantry it cavalry,
from one to three years. Those
wishing to enlist, send your name

At the recular weekly drill of Company
D, I!. 8., â â !' The Eighth-avenue M. E.
Church, Saturday evening, the members
unanimously voted to tender their ser
vices to Governor Budd for duty. The or
ganization of this body was effected Sep

of a splendid company, consisting',
as It does, of young men of the proper
jiÃ'- and height. In the competitive drills

A PETTY SWINDLER.
Complex Plot Carried Out in Order to
Gain a Trifling Sum.
ALAMEDA, April 18.â A respectable
epr<~-aring man put in several hours yes
terday laying, the preliminaries for a
â windle that after all netted him only
J- and which at the outside could have
raid him only $4. First he called on F.
P. Furey. a Park street plumber, and
represented that he was affent for a
thy Oakland property owner who de
to hire a trustworthy young man to
look after the repairs to his houses. Mr.
Furey gave him the address of William
Pii free of 2211 Sari Antonio avenue, and
after making special inquiries as to the
young man's character he went to the
house. There he found no one at home
except the young man'? mother, Mrs.
Pingree. After considerable conversation
â  iast concluded that me young man
would fill the bill, and accordingly wrote
cut a letter of recommendation to the
alleged capitalist and left word for Pin
gree to call on him in Oakland. This Pin
gree d.id. with the result that he found
the address given to b<> a church. After
writing the letter the stranger told Mrs.
Pingree that he know a lady who was
about to move and who had a ton of coal
In her house that she wanted to dispose
of fheaply. She would take $4 for it
though it was worth $10. Mrs. Pingree
had no money, but finally went to a
neighbor and borrowed $2.30. This the 'â 
Stranger took and departed. After this
she even took thf trouble to go back to
Furey's store and thank him for r^com
rnending so fine a young man aa Pingree
to him. This is not the first time this
pwindle has been worked here, and in
each case only a small amount has been
realized.

THE MAN WHO TRAINED SAMPSON
Chaplain j, s, Wallace, an ex-Professor of An
napolis, Speaks Bluntlu of His Ideas of
the War With Spain.
OAKLAND. April 26.â The man who instructed Captain Sampson at An
napolis now resides at the Hotel Metropole in this city. He is Chaplain J.
S. "Wallace, U. S. N., retired, and he was. before his retirement, a professor
at Annapolis. While there many officers now holding commissions, includ
ing Sampson and YVainwright, were his pupils. He also accompanied Farra
gut on his celebrated cruise after the Civil War.
"This is a most righteous war," said Chaplain Wallace to-day, "and I
have felt so all along. In fact, it is unique in the world's history, in that it
is being waged for humanity, except, of course, for the Maine incident.
I feel confident that our men will win, for I know many of them person
ally, and ran judge of their merits.
"The duration of the war will depend much upon the result of the first
naval battle. If Spain succeeds in beating us in the first naval engage
ment that would necessarily put us hors de combat for some time to come.
We should be compelled to build ships and go at it again. On the other
hand, if we win the first battle Spain will undoubtedly back down and the
war will be short. . .
"But we are really not prepared as we should be for war. It is humiliat
ing to me and to other naval officers to see the United States compelled to
go all over the world picking up ships here and there. I don't think Europe
will become involved in the conflict. England is thoroughly our friend, and
Spain her old enemy ever since the Armada times. England wants us for
an ally. Other nations won't touch us as long as England sympathizes with
us.
"My theory in regard tr> the modern warship is that we ha% - e made a
EiisuikV- in not having more sail on them. Machinery is likely to break down
at any time, and it is not always convenient to get coal. The old ships were
equipped with both sail and steam, and there is really much to be gained
by having pnil power, for we could economize when at sea and in no hurry
by using such power instead of steam. This war, though, is resolved down
largely to a war oT coal. We can get plenty of it, but there is a question
about Spain being able to do so.
"As to the Philippines, we don't want them, of course, except to hold
them and trade them for something else at the end of hostilities, and it goes
without Baying that the Philippines will fall before our ships, because the
protecting "force of Spanish vessels is insignificant."
Chaplain Wallace is holding himself ready for a call in case his services
are needed.
YOUNG DELGER
NOT CUT OFF
Will Receive a Full Share
of His Father's Big
Estate.
Much Property Deeded Off to
Heirs and Leased
Back.
Masonic Societies Will Attend the
Funeral Services This
Alternoon.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. April 26.
The will of Frederick Delger contains
nothing sensational and no surprises. It
has not yet been made public, but the in
timate friends of the deceased are aware
of its contents.
It does not dispose of a large amount of
property, although Mr.' Delger was a very
wealthy man and owned immense bloclo
of valuable realty. Some time ago, show
ing his usual foresight and desire to min
imize the possibilities of litigation, Mr.
Delger, it Is now known, deeded a large
amount of his property to his heirs, and
afterward they leased it to him at nom
inal figures, so that ho had absolute con
trol of his large properties up to the time
of T.is death.
The heirs are the four children of the
deceased, who will inherit the. bulk of the
property after suitable provision Is made
for the widow. There are also numerous
legacies of varied amounts to some of the
relatives in this country an-d in Ger
many. The children are Mrs. H. O. Trow
bridge, Mrs. William Moller, Mrs. Brown
and Frederick Delger. These children
will each receive an equal share of their
father's estate.
It has been known that during the past
few years there have been some differ
ences between the deceased and his son.
These differences have, it is rumored,
amounted to occasional threats on the
part of the dead capitalist that his son
should not share in hJs father's wealth.
During the prevalence of one of these
differences young Delger went into busi
ness for himself in this city and was suc
cessful. This effort on the part of the
son was very gratifying to his father and
long before his death they were in perfect
harmony. All stories that the will con
tained a clause disinheriting the son are
entirely false, for It is authoritatively

DAVIS ANSWERS HUBBARD.
Will Say No More Except to Answer
Libelous Statements.
OAKLAND, April 2fi.â The following
j letter has been received from Rev. Ed
wards Davis. It explains itself:
OAKLAND, Cal., April 26, 1898.
Editor Call: The statement of George C.
t Hubbird at the Monday meeting of the
I Christian ministers, as reported in to-day's
1 Call, can be better appreciated in view of the
following fact. The party mentioned re
signed his eldership perforce, and but a few
mjnths ago wai regularly dismissed from
membership In the Central Christian Church
by the unanimous recommendation of every
other officer and the unanimous vote of the
congregation. He objects to the editor of our
denominational paper allowing complimentary
notice regarding myself. I am sorry such is
so displeasing. It Is grievous that small
ability should elicit enviouH enmity. I am
gratified that Rev. W. B. Berry and others
had the courage to desire justice and to await
action on discussion until something authorita
tive I* presented agalnpt me. I hope I shall
not be compelled to make further statement
in the press until some one charge has been
communicated to me. No definite charge his
yet been received. But I understand that
method, for Inuendo is more effective than do
finite statement.
Some of my brethren are certainly not act-
Ing In a manner conducive to my loyalty to
Christian fraternity, were not my faith in
Christ made more secure by tvery assallment.
Pre-eminently for the peace and power of
Christianity personal quarrels should be kept
from publicity, and, therefore, unless In the
refutation of a libel on my character. I shall
not further speak until before a Justly con

Demands Heavy Damages.
OAKLAND, April 2fi. â Mrs. Frances
Taylor has instituted legal proceedings to
collect $10,000 damages for malicious mis
chief from James H. Creeley. This is the
outcome of the celebrated Creeley-Taylor
fence fond of a year ago. The families
reside on Myrtle street, between Twenty
sixth and Twenty-eighth. They disagreed
and a fence was built between them by
Crcley that shut out the sun, light and
all view of his neighbors. The Taylors
tore it down and Creeley had Mrs. Tay
lor arrested for malicious mischief. The
testimony in the Police Court was of such
a character that Judge Alien dismissed
the defendant. Now comes this suit.

BERKELEY April 26.-Health Officer
Rowell of Berkeley Is fearful of disas

Town Trustees to immediately construct

In his report to the Trustees Dr. Row

I would further (suggest that some action be
taken by your honorable board restricting the
use of water for purposes of Irrigation while
our sewers require Hushing during this dry rea
son more than ever. It seems a cruel waste
of water to allow the hose to play for hours
upon lawns and garden*.
All panltary precautions apalnut fevers should
be taken, and the fact borne in mind that clean
sewers are more Important to the health of the
community than attractive lawns and flower
beds!
I regard the water problem to-day as most
serious from a sanitary standpoint and worthy
of vigorous restrictive measures In relation
thereto.

A Resolution That Comes as a
Surprise to the Water
Users.
J. W. T. Watkinson Says That There
Is Absolutely a Water
Famine.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 26.
"In view of the fact that the â 
present season is the driest experi- â 
enced in many years in Alameda â 
County, and may be followed by i
another of like kind, and realizing â¢
that the water now wasted in the â¢
gutters and in other ways is need- â 
k-ss and should be saved for possi- â 
ble future requirements, and be- -
lieving that, with care, an abun- <
dant supply could be reserved for a <
possible lung drought, which would <
be of great benelit to the city of <
Oakland and promote its prosper- -
Ity, now, therefore, be it <
"Resolved, That all watÂ«;r con- <
sumers be and they are hereby re- <
quested to take all necessary pre- <
cautions to prevent waste by re- <
pairing defective plumbing, etc., <
and by using only a reasonable -
amount of water for irrigation and <
other purposes." . <
The above resdlution was introduced at
the City Council meeting last evening,
and caused some surprise. Although this
year has been unusually dry, Oakianders
have been n lying on the statement of
the two water companies, and felt secure
against any possible lack of water. That
such a scarcity may .occur is shown to be
probable by the resolution introduced by
.Air. Pnngie.
Througnout the contest between the
water companies, each has reiterated the
statement that ft is entirely capable of
supplying the whole town with all the
water it could possibly u,se. Lach com
pany Is now supposeu to be supplying
about half thu town, and yet a drought is
predicted.
Mr. Dingee of the Oakland Water Com
pany several days ago said that the scar
city of rain will have no effect whatever
on the amount >>i water his company can
furnish. He said that the Weils were
Mowing better this year than last, and
that a dry season has no effect upon
them. When Questioned this afternoon,
Mr. Dingee said he preferred not to be
quoted on the matter, further than to say
that the resolution is not introduced at
the request of his company.
J. H. T. Watkinson of the' Contra Costa
Company furnished The Call with the
following condition of the water supply
of the State, compiled from ample in
quiry:
â  The ground has been sapped by con
tinuous drying winds of moisture afforded
by the light showers that have fallen,
causing this season 'o oe the driest on
record in Alarai da County, and generally
dry seasons come together and wet sea-
Bons follow each other.
By reason of the lawns surrounding
most of the houses in Oakland a larger
per capita supply of water than con
sumed in any other city is required, and
therefore more latitude is given for pro
lific waste.
An abundant supply of water at the
latter end of a protracted drought will
add to the prosperity of Oakland and
maintain an efficient â  tire protection
which many cities in California at such
a time Wia not possess. Each individual
water consumer who takes interest in the
welfare of Oakland should prevent waste
on his own premises and also discourage
his neighbor from so doing.
One city has the low per capita con
sumption of eighteen gallons. Many man
ufacturing cities come below thirty-five
p;illons, but Oakland, -here there "is no
municipal restraint on waste, consumes
las gallons. There is every confidence in
Oakland being- furnished with an abun
dant Bupply- still it is not known how
long this drought will last. By calling
the consumers' attention to the necessity
of abating waste now it may obviate the
necessity of enforcing obnoxious re
straints hereafter, when it might possibly
be necessary.
Oakland is more abundantly supplied
than almost any city in the United States
and that supply can be relied upon during
a long dought if reasonable care is taken.
The farmers in the vicinity of our
neighboring city of San Jose are surrep
titiously depriving the county of all the
water that has been used for sprinkling
streets, the condition of their orchards
from drought being so desperate that
they take the water from the pipes at
night.
Tulare Lake., deriving its sources from
the snow regions of the mountains, is
now lower than during any preceding
drought. I,ake Tahoe, thirty-two miles
long, has been thirty feet below its normal
level. From the Mexican line to within
some fifty miles south of Oakland the
country resembles the Mojave Desert. In
this district a person can cross the large
rivers without wetting his feet. There
Is absolutely a water famine. Under
these conditions Oakland is fortunate in
possessing an adequate supply for all
anticipated future necessities, but "fore
warned is forearmed," and the water now
being wasted might possibly in the dis
tant future be available for some useful
purposes.
In Washington, D. C, where they have
heavy rains nearly every month in the
year, the waste has been so excessive
that the water department has authorized
the expenditure of $1,000,000 for meters to
restrict the waste.
Under ordinary circumstances In Cali
fornia where we have six months without
any rain, and sometimes thirty-six
months with but very scanty rainfall, wa
ter Is a scarce commodity, and under all
circumstances should be husbanded with
care, and in case of a drought indulgence
in waste seems nothing short of a crime.

ANXIOUS FOR
A REVERSAL
Judge Belcher Not in
Favor With the Har
bor Commission.
Special Counsel Engaged to
Carry His Decision to the
Supreme Court.
Resolutions Passed and From All
Appearances the Board Is in
Earnest.
"At a meeting of the State Board of
Harbor Commisioners yesterday after
noon it was resolved that the decision
of Judge Belcher against the board
should be appealed, and special counsel
retained in behalf of the board. It was
resolved that counsel for the defend
ants in the two cases of Irving vs. the
board and the case of the Paraffine
Company vs. the same parties, now
pending in the Superior Court, be au
thorized and directed to forthwith take
all necessary steps and proceedings for
new trials and appeals on behalf of the
board.
The Commissioners have expressed
their determination to fight the decision
to the bitter end. Mr. Herrold asked
that the move be first referred to the
attorney of the board and the Attorney-
General, for the purpose of discovering
how long the action of the board would
be held by the appeal, but Special
Counsel F. S. Stratton was of the opin
ion that the appeal should be made and
victory for the board would certainly
follow. Other routine business was
looked into by the board, but it was
evident that the meeting involved prin
cipally the action of Judge Belcher in
his recent decision.
After the decision by the board to ap
peal the case to the higher courts, the
letter written by Attorney Stratton was
placed on record. The letter or appeal
follows:
Honorable Board of State Harbor Com
missioners, 10 California street, Cityâ
Gentlemen: The two suits of Irving vs.
Board of State Harbor Commissioners,
and i'araftine Paint Company vs. same,
have been decided, as you know, in favor
of the plaintiff. While the decisions axe,
as they ought to be, received as express
ing the law as viewed by tne trial court,
I nevertheless advise that appeals be
forthwith taken to the Supreme Court.
And while further the opinion as ren
dered is, as it should be, entitled to re
sp< ct and as of weight, I still further ex
press the belief that the appeals must in
evitably be successful. While your right
to employ special counsel Is assailed,
there can be no doubt of the proper ex
ercise of your power in this instance, for
the reason that the Attorney General has,
in writing, heretofore consented to my
employment as such in this case.
Regarding this same matter, for ser
vices rendered during thr, trial just had
I will not expect any compensation until
the matter or the law is more authorita
tively determined. Since, however, I have
never acted in any case as special coun
sel without the consent of, and unless re
quested by, Mr. Ford, your regular at
torney, and since one Attorney General
has already Hied a written opinion con
ceding your right to employ special coun
sel, and since you have verbally reported
to me the opinion of the present Attor
ney General conceding to you the same
right, and since further this power to so
employ special counsel is. in my opinion
given to the Harbor Commissioners ex
pressly by the act of March 13. 1895 I
would suggest and advise that the whole
matter of the right of special counsel to
act be referred to your own attorney for
In the opinion just rendered by Judge
Belcher I feel that it is my duty to state
that he has in all probability uncon
sciously done me an injustice regard
ing the advice which I gave you relative
to the rejection of bids. The opinion in
question states that I advised the board
that they had no authority to open the
bids, or to award a contract upon a day
not named in the advertisement. He
holds that such an opinion is not sound
law.
I think that Judge Belcher, when his
attention is called to the matter, will at
once recall that I never have given any
such advice. This is the more readily
shown by reason of the fact that my
opinion, dated December 15, 1597, is in
writing, and is on file In your office, and
was introduced as an exhibit in the trial
of these cases. Mr. Holmes testified that
before the bids in question were opened
and before it was known at all that the
plaintiff was the lowest bidder, or in
fact, that any bid had been put in by' the
ParafÃne Paint Company for the creosot
ing method. I stated to him that it would
be advisable for the board to return all
bids unopened, and in this way avoid
complication.
After the bids had been opened and
when I was appealed to for my views I
reiterated my former opinion that, since
the right of the board >o open bids on a
day not named in the advertisement
would probably be raised, and since by
opening bids on such a day the board
might be involved in litigation which
would delay the work for from one to
three years, the better plan would
be for the board to avoid all questions
and by readvertising for ten days make
their position in law secure. This cer
tainly waa merely proceeding with cau
tion, and there was no declaration on my
part at any time as to whether the board
had or had not authority to open thp bids
Very respectfully, F. S. STRATTON.
MAYDAY AT SUTRO BATHS.
Extensive Arrangements for the Big
Event.
Extensive preparations are being made
at the Sutro Baths for the children's
Mayday festival, which will take place
on Saturday, April 30, 1898. The big in
terior is being arranged to receive the
large numbers of children who are ex
pected to gather there. The platform
over the tanks has been enlarged, and in
the center a throne has been built for
the May queen. This will be covered
with flowers taken from Mr. Sutro's
grounds. The May poles will be placed
at the corners of the platform and the
seats for the children, who will be dress
ed in white, will be arranged in a semi
circle, rising to the throne like an am
phitheater.
The management has made arrange
ments to give up the entire Sutro
Baths and pleasure grounds for the
enjoyment of the children of the city on
Saiui^ay, April 30, the entertainment will
last from 10 a. m. till late at night, and
c.ere will not be a minute without its
especial form of amusement. Professor
William J. O'Brien has the children in
charge, and his skill in ..raining little
ones in the various faocy dances is al
ready well known to the public of San
Francisco.
There will also be a march, In which
one thousand children will participate, at
the end of which the queen will be
crowned and the triple luay poles deco
rated with their silken red, white and
blue streamers. Afterward there will be
fancy dances. Preparations are being
made to accommodate a large crowd, and
the management of Sutro Baths predicts
a day of unalloyed pleasure to all who
attend the festivities.
Crushed by a Truck.
Arthur Eleston, seven years of age, was
knocked down and run over by a truck
near his home at 4 Freelon street early
last evening. Upon examination at the
Receiving Hospital it was discovered that
the boy had sustained severe bruises
about the limbs and body, and tnÂ» left
ear was almost torn from the head. It
is possible internal Injuries may havp
been sustained. The injured boy recently
moved with his parents tro~i Vallejo to
this city.

MELVILLE ATTWOOD BURIED.
The Deceased Was Known on Two Continents as Geologist and
Mineralogist.
The funeral services oVer the body of the late Melville Attwood were
held yesterday morning at St. Mark's Church, Berkeley, after which the
body was brought to this city ami interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery. The
services wore attended by many of the old-time friends of the deceased, and
the members of the Microscopical Society attended the funeral in a body.
The deceased was widely known in scientific circles, both in this country
and England. He was born at Prescott Hall, near Stourbridge, Worces
tershire. England, on July 31, ISI2. He early developed a desire for scientific
research, and after a trip to the gold and diamond mines of Brazil, returning
in 1839. he became manager and part owner of the old Eton mine on the
Isle of Man. In 1^43 he made the first important discovery that gave zinc
a commercial value, and he rolled the first English spelter in Staffordshire.
About this time, his wife's health becoming critical, he disposed of all
his interests and sailed for America, hoping that the change might benefit
1., r. [n 1252 he arrived in New York, and was employed to examine and
report on the work of the Panama Railroad. On the trip the whole crew,
including his own family, were attacked with cholera, and two of the men
died. At Panama he took passage on the old Tennessee for San Francisco.
The first day out yellow fever broke out on board, and the ship's surgeon
was among the first to succumb. Mr. Attwood took the doctor's duties
upon himself, and when the ship arrived in port he was presented with a
splendid testimonial by the officers and passengers for his good services.
On his arrival here he immediately became connected with mining af
fairs as engineer and expert, and he received many diplomas and medals for
his superior work in this line. His contributions to the Mining Bureau and
scientific papers and magazines are so well known as to need but little com
ment. He was a membrr of the Academy of Sciences and the Microscopical
Society of this city and a Fellow of the Geological Society of London, Eng
land.
THE MOHICAN
IN QUARANTINE
Measles Said to Be Epi
demic on the Train
ing Ship.
Fifteen of the Boys in Blue
Came Up on the Steamer
Zealandia.
W. Teane Fell Down the Telegraph
Hi:l Precipice and Lives to
Tell the Tale.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's |
Zealandia. arrived yesterday from Hon
olulu with fifty-four cabin and fifty
four steerage passengers. She had a
fine weather passage throughout and
arrived ahead of time, as she was not
expected before midnight in any event.
The passengers by the steamer say that J
the annexation story was a hoax per- |
petrated on one of the reporters of the !
Hawaiian Star. The reporter asked j
Port Surveyor Stratmeyer of Honolulu |
If there was any news and the latter |
answered: "Yes, great news; we are
going to hoist the stars and stripes to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock." The re
porter immediately hied himself to the
editorial-room of his paper and made
a "top-head story" out of the item. |
Much to his disgust and also to the dis
gust of the readers of the paper Old
Glory was not raised over the Hawaiian
flag the next morning.
The Zealandia brought up fifteen
blue jackets from the United States
steamships Baltimore and Bennington.
Of these four were prisoners on their
â way to Mare Island Prison to serve
out sentences for desertion, four were
in charge of Dr. P. A. Hesler on their
way to Mare Island Naval Hospital
and seven were on their way home,
their time having expired. None of
the seven will take advantage of their
privilege, but all vvilj i ontinue in the
navy until after the war.
Quite a number of the boys on the
training-ship Mohican were in the brig
when the Zealandia loft, while the
warship herself whs in quarantine, as
there was an epidemic of measles
aboard. The boys in the brig were not
there for any grave offense, but had
simply overstayed their leave and
were being punished fur the breach ol
discipline. It was their first visit to
the tropics and life ashore was so new
and strange to them that they stayed
longer than they at first intended. In
consequence the oflicers took a lenient
view of the offense and the boys will
be reinstated when their term ot im
prisonment is over.
Sunday morning last Robert Cowes,
chief steward of the Zealandia, died at
Bea. He came from Honuluiu to take
charge of the steward's* department of
the Zealandia when she was put in
commission and on his arrival here wp.s
a very sick man. He was sufiiciently
recovered, however, to go out on the
steamer, and when the Zealandia was
here last was feeling first rate again.
Just prior to the sailing of tli.- vessel
from Honolulu Co.wes was feeling sick
again, but insisted on making the trip.
He grew gradually worse and in spite
of everything that could be done for
him he died at 6a. m. Sunday. The
body was brought to San Francisco,
where it will be embalmed and pent
back to Honolulu on the Zea'.andia. ThfÂ»
deceased leaves a widow and family
and a large circle of friends in the isl
ands. Robert Cowes was well known
to the traveling: public, having served
for years in the Pacific Mail Com
pany's steamers, and before retiring
from the service had been in the
Oceanic Steamship Company's Mari
posa as chief steward.
"^lnsurance of the big American ship
Phenandoah at the rate of 10 per cent
was paid yesterday. The vessel was
reported the other day to have been
raptured by a Spanish cruiser. A tele
gram was received by the Merchants'
Exchange yesterday to the effect that
on April 4 the Shenandoah was south
west of the Azores. Given the usual
â¢winds generally encountered in that lo
cality, Captain Murphy's vessel would
have been somewhere in the vicinity of
the place where he was reported to
have been captured. Balfour, Guthrie
! 4 Co.. the charterers of the vessel, still
! doubt the story and think that the
Shenandoah will turn up all right at
Queenstown.
William Teane, a laborer, who lives
on Minna street, had a most remark
able escape on last Monday night. The
special providence that watches over
drunken men must have had him in
charge, for he fell down the Telegraph
Hill precipice and escaped with two
lacerations of the chin, a fracture of
I the left kneecap, a badly abrased right
knee and both hands terribly mangled.
Dr. Diggins patched him up as well as
possible under the circumstances and
then sent him to the City and County
Hospital. Teane says he does not
know how he came to be on Telegraph
Hill, but thinks he must have wandered
there while drunk, and while trying to
find his way home tumbled over the
cliff.
The Austin (Texas) Regatta Asso
ciation is very anxious to get Henry
Peterson, the local oarsman, down
there for its annual regatta. Last
Labor day the association had a most
successful carnival, and Secretary L.
D. Peterson is more than anxious to
secure Peterson for this year's events.
Henry is a great favorite with the
Texans and they are willing to back
him against any of the world's cham
pions. The war, however, will prob
ably keep Peterson in San Francisco,
as he is an ensign in the Naval Bat
talion and one of its most enthusiastic
members.
The rush to the Klondike, via Dyea I
and Skaguay, is petering out, and the
City of Puebla, which sailed yester
day, took away only one or two passen
gers to the gold fields. The Humboldt
has been in port a couple of days, and
the chances of her getting away be
fore Friday or Saturday do not seem j
to be very bright. The steamers Wil- |
lamette, Oregon and Australia have
been withdrawn from the route and
are back at their old business. The
Oregon is running between San Fran
cipco and Astoria carrying passengers.
The "Willamette is carrying coal to
Portland for the Oregon Improvement
Company, and the Australia is being I
got ready to go back into the Honolulu |
trade. The Zealandia will make one j
more trip to the islands, after which j
she will be laid up and the Australia
will take up the run.
GOVERNMENT WINS.
Defaults Taken in a Case of Defalca
tion and Two of Warehouse
Abandonment.
Defaults were entered in the United
States District Court yesterday in the
of the United States vs. William M.
Vickrey and others, the United States vs.
S. G. Glaser, and the United States vs.
Charles R. Bowpn.
Vickrey was Postmaster at Copperopo
lis, Calaveraa County, and was committed
to an asylum for the insane. When his
books were examined it was found that
he was short $642 35 for money paid him |
on money orders. Being insane, he couid
not be prosecuted on a criminal charge,
so in lieu thereof he and his bondsmen
were made defendants in a civil action j
to recover the amount embezzled, to
gether with interest and costs. Vickrey
was discharged from the asylum cured a
short time ago. An attachment has been
levied on his property to secure the col
lection of the judgment.
The judgment against Glaser is for
$I*ll6 38 for duties due on goods aban
doned in the bonded warehouse. That
against Bowen is for ?C24 due in the samS
manner.
Struck the Elevator Man.
Charles "Whelan, who runs elevator No.
2 at the City Hall, had a dispute with one
of the janitors yesterday. The Janitor
struck Whelan, knocking him down and
he landed on his left wrist, breaking It
He went to the Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Bunnell attended to htm. He did not
know the name of the janitor, but as
soon as he ascertained it he said he
would swear out a warrant for his arrest.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 1398.
FAILED TO
WING THE
BOLD THIEF
The Letter-Box Pil
ferer Fired at by
an Officer.
Caught Tampering With
the Mail on Scott
Street.
Allowed to Escape in a Red
Cart Which He Had
in Waiting.
KNOWN TO THE POLICE.
His EtteminÂ«te- Looking Companion
Also Eluded the Authori
ties.
Discovered In the act of tampering
with a mail box at McAllister and Scott
streets last Monday night one of the
men for whom the postal authorities
are anxiously searching jumped into a
cart which he had in waiting and drove
away. He was detected by a police
man who, realizing that he could not
overtake him, fired three shots at him
in the hope of compelling him to stop.
Unmindful of the leaden missiles which
were sent after him the bold thief fur
iously lashed his horse and disappeared
along Scott street. Word was at once
sent to police headquarters and a num
ber of officers were dispatched to head
off the thief.
After searching the Western Addition
for the audacious culprit the police
men, several hours later, returned to
the central station without having ob
tained a trace of him. He wore a
slouch hat and a long overcoat and,
according to the policeman who detect
ed him in the act of tampering with
the mail box, was fully six feet tall
and was smooth shaven.
During the past few weeks a number
of letter boxes have been opened and
their contents taken. The postal au
thorities, unable to catch the thieves,
enlisted the services of the police. Spe
cial instructions were issued to the
guardians of the peace to closely ex
amine the boxes on their respective
beats and when found to have been
tampered with to at once notify the
superintendent of Station D. Not
withstanding the vigilance of the po
lice amd postal authorities the daring
thieves continued to ply their vocation,
periodically opening as many as a
dozen boxes tn one night.
The fact that they operated in a red
cart, to which was attached a gray
horse, was discovered about a week
ago. A police officer whose beat is on
Golden Gate avenue saw the men drive
up to a letter-box on Steiner street and,
alighting from the cart in which they
were seated, proceeded to open the box.
He attempted to arrest them, but,
catching a glimpse of him, they
Jumped into their cart and drove away.
Last night the following description
of the men was read off to the police
men connected with the Central sta
tion:
No. Iâ Fully G feet in height, -weight
about 190 pounds, round face, good-na
tured looking; dark mustache; wore dark
sack suit, dark slouch hat and long dark
overcoat.
No. 2â Height about 5 feet 4 inches, very
slim; smooth face, very effeminate look
ing; wore a dark cutaway suit and a der
by hat.
The police are inclined to believe that
the "short man" was in the vicinity
when his confederate was fired at by
the policeman Monday night. It is pos
sible, they think, that he was tamper
ing with another box near by when the
officers discovered his confederate and
vainly endeavored to capture him.
Chief Lees has instructed his men to
shoot the thieves if they fail to stop
when commanded to do so.

GRAND JURY
REACHES FOR
THE ROGUES
The Loot of the School Fund to
Be Looked Into This
Evening.
Five More Buildings Where the Most
Shameless Frauds Were
Practiced.
Contractor P. Swift, Inspector John
JTBrien and the members of the Finance
jjid Buildings and Grounds Committees
of the Board of Education will soon have
an opportunity to tell what they know
about the loss of the school fund through
the medium of supplies for repairs- A
special session of the Grand Jury has
been called for this evening to receive
the evidence accumulated by the commit
tee of that body, with the experts who
have conducted the investigation into the
repairs on the different school buildings.
This evidence, as has been shown by
The Call, will prove that not one job of
repairing during the six months prior to
January 1, that has beÂ«n inspected so far,
has been honestly performed. The lum
ber and shingles have invariably fallen
short thousands of feet of tho quantity
charged for; the quality furnished has
been, without exception, of the very poor
eat in the market, while the highest con
tract price has been charged, and oven
the work Itself has been done in the most
careless manner possible.
It is possible that O'Brien and the two
committees of Directors will be able to
convince the Grand Jury that the solo
responsibility rests upon Contractor
Swir't. but in order to acquit themselves
of actual complicity in the job they will
be compelled to set up the plea of gross
est negligence, O'Brien, who is Director
Ragan's brother-in-law, draws a salary of
$150 a month from the department to pre
vent just this kind of work. His duty as
Inspector requires him to measure every
foot of lumber delivered to the depart
ment and to see that it is of the quality
called for.
But as O'Brien is so closely related to a
director whose Influence among the other
tr. embers is most potent, hÂ£ may have
thought it entirely unneces^ry to devote
any tune to the city. .Besides, his private
contracts, in which lumber played an im
portant part, demanded much of his time
that the city paid tor.
As for Contractor Swift, the best advice
his must ardent well wisher can give him
is to strive long and faithfully to lose the
reputation he has among the members of
the Lumber Dealers' Association.
The buildings and grounds committee of
the School Directors, as constituted last
year, was composed of Burns, chairman,
with Gallagher and Drucker. This com
mittee had entire charge of all the re
pairs under investigation. It ordered the
work done and the lumber with which to
do It, and if the members accepted
O'Brien's reports as correct without any
investigation, they will have an opportu
nity to trj and convince the Grand Jury
that it was the proper thing to do.
Waller, who is already under indict
ment, but still has more to say In the
board meetings than the other eleven Di
rectors combined, was chairman of the
finance committee last year, his associ
ates being Burns and Armor. Burns and
Waller are fast friends, and it was they
Who transacted all the business of the
committee. Armer was thrown in the dis
card soon after the committee was
named, and was never given an opportu
nity to attend its meetings.
He was not notilled of the call for
meetings, and finally he became so dis
gusted with the manner in which the
committee was conductod that he re
fcigned from it. Consequently Waller and
Burns will have to tell why Contractor
Swift's bills were audited wnch they had
nothing but O'Brien's word for it that
any lumber at all had been furnished.
The committee of the Grand Jury, with
Experts Holt, Campbell and Rickard
continued its Investigation all day yes
terday, its lirst visit being made to "the
Fairmount School, away out In the Mis
sion district. It was while the party was
at that school that one o* the experts
made a casual remark that disclosed a
new channel for the drainage of the
school funds. Grand Juror Bauer re
marked that the hauling of lumber must
be profitable, judging from the bills paid
by the department.
Expert Campbell, who is a member of
tne Lumber Dealers' Association, re
plied that the association had a regular
schedule of rates for h H uling. He said
the city was districted and a large map
had been prepared showing these dis
tricts, and no member was permitted to
charge more than the schedule rates.
The rate to Ingleside. he said, is $2 25 per
thousand, and to ..e county line $2 50
these being the two longest hauls in the
city.
Xm ra ?2~ J Â« uri)r Truman stated that on one
Dill of f,oo worth of lumber for one of the
downtown schools the city had been
charged $240 for mill work and hauline
nearly a third of the cost of the material.'
It is probable that the Grand Jury will
go into this phase of the job to the fullest
extent as soon as the present line of in
quiry is finished.
The Fairmount School y-ard was re
planked and some additional class rooms
built during last vacation,' consequently
the bill for lumber was largo, being as
follows: 29,000 fancy . shingles (best
quality) contract price $1 90 per 1000. this
beine the price paid; 37,926 feet of 2-lnch
No.l planking of varying width; 10.000 feet
of 4x4 redwood. The experts found 15,500
JNo. I common shingles, contract price 99
cents per 1000; 27.500 feet of No. 2 and 3
planking; 7500 feet of 4x4 redwood. The
?n t ,L. 1 J aa been , r o bb e<l of 33,500 shingles,
10,426 feet of planking and 2500 feet of 4x4
redwood, in addition to being shamefully
swindled on the quality received Here
as In all the other schools, the experts'
made exceedingly liberal allowances for
waste, and. to nuote Expert Holt, any
dealer who furnished lumber for the
various jobs on the experts' measure
ments would know there would be some
thing left to carry away
The yard of the Horace Mann School on
\ aiencla street had new classrooms
built, the bill for lumber a.s paid by the
School Directors calling for 364G feet of
I^4x4-inch tongue and groove flooring
41^J feet of IxÃ rustic; 22,000 shingies- 3452
feet of 2-inch planking, and 940 feet of 4x4
redwood. The experts' figures show 2400
feet of flooring; 1900 feet of rustic- 14 000
shingles; 2000 feet of planking, and '451
feet of 4x4 redwood.
A visit to the Buena Vista primary on
York street, near Eighteenth, disclosed
one of the biggest steals yet brought to
light. The city paid for 46,591 feet of 2
inch planking and received 22,000 feet a
loss of 24,591 feet; 11.670 feet of 4x4, and
received 5850 feet, a difference of 5820 feet
and 670 feet of stepping, of which no trace
could be discovered.
After exploiting this case of robbery
the inquisitors made a jump to the down
town district, alighting lirst on the Whit
tier primary on Harrison, near Fourth.
This Job was awful, those responsible for
It being unwilling even to divide, but in
stead barely allowing the city a third of
the rotten material it had paid the high
est price for. The bill called for 5rÂ»,740 feet
01 2-inch planking, but only 20,500 feet were
used; 16,160 feet of 3x6 redwood at $8 95
per thousand, but for which pine at $7 40
was substituted, and only 9200 feet deliv
ered; 22,276 feel of 4xÃ redwood, in place
of which 2788 feet of 4xt; and 4722 feet of
4x4, a total of 7490 feet, was found; 750 feet
of stepping, of which but 504 feet was in
evidence, and 422 feet of 2x12. which
shrunk to 147 feet under the experts' tape
line.
The Starr King Primary, on Brvant
street, near Eighth, concluded the day's
investigation. Here the city got about
half the lumber it paid for, except step
ping, of which only a fourth could b*i
found, and all the stairways in the build
ing were measured. The 44,760 feet of
planking charged for actually measured
26,000 feet, with an allowance of nearly
2000 feet by the experts. Twenty-oi..
thousand seven hundred and seventy
four feet of 4x4 proved to measure flÃoo
feet. Both of these measurements In
cluded piles of material in the yard not
yet laid, for the replanklnr of thÂ« yard
has only been partly accomplished. Two '
thousand eierht hundred and sixteen feet i
of stepping appears on the bill, hut 663 I
feet are all that is necessary to build all I
the stairways in the school. Tho iJooring
in the landings on the stairs measured I
371 feet, but the city paid for 840 feet.
Sixteen schools, picked at random in j
every section of the city, have already
been thoroughly inspected by tho pr;.^H |
jurors and their experts, and the result
shows the grossest fraud in the repair of j
every one. As th<- carpenter work on all !
the buildings was done during the sum
mer vacation, it is nut a remote possl- j
bility that honesty prevailed In the work
on any of the others. Still the jurymen I
Intend to make sure, ana further lnspec- I
tions will be made to-day.
St. Dominic's Church Picnic.
Tho first pictnic and reunion St. Dom
| inic's Church has had for several yours
will be held at Sunset Park in the Santa
I Cruz Mountains on May 21. Judging from
the reports of the various sub-commit
tees which have the affair in charge the
arrangements are almost completed, and
the excursion will undoubted^- be one of
the pleasant outings of the season. The
EMMA GOLDMAN, ANARCHIST.
A little womanâ she can't be. five feet tallâ her round, slender figure neatly
dressed In black, a bunch of carnations at her belt and one glowing vividly.
In her brown hair, a white collar at her fair throat and white lace falling
over her tiny hands. Her eyes are beautifully clear and gray, her forehead
Is fine and low, though the head itself seems narrow, the small nose is a bit
blunt and the thin lips have an habitual disdainful curl that is far from
pleasing.
This Is Emma Goldman, the anarchist, who suffered a year's imprison
ment in New York for ! "inciting to riot."
"I didn't incite to riot," she said to me after last night's meeting was
aver. "I merely quoted Cardinal Manning's words: 'Necessity knows no law."
"But there was an Implication, wasn't there? You meant them to riot?"
J asked her.
Incite to riot? . . â¢ "
Why this five feet of feminine anarchy is the most dangerous enemy so
ciety has. Had she lived a century ago she'd have been beheaded. Two cen
turies ago. Emma Goldman, anarchist, would have been given over to the
loving embrace of the jungfrau; while in the sixteenth century, she would
have been nicely boiled in oil or beheaded and then neatly broken on the
wheel.
But this little Russian woman, with her thickened speech, her good roll
ing r's. her disdain of rhetorical rules, her vehemence of expression, her potent,
unstudied postures, is the most interesting woman I ever met. She has life!
she has courage, she has brains. She is fiercely consistent, unwaveringly true
and, though I can't agree with her, I believe her to be absolutely sincere.
You should hear her talk. It doesn't matter whether you're socialist or
anarchist or are endowed with a blessed indifference of Isms in general. You
can better afford to miss hearing Melba or even Bernhardt than listening to
this genuine creature. She is San Francisco's sensation, as she was that of
New York and Chicago; and next to the departure of the soldiers who
marched off to Cuba, there is nothing so thrilling as listening to Emma Gold
man.. For nothing cows this woman, who alludes, in her full, strong contralto,
to the Deity as "the old gentleman who employs full-stomached Idlers, priests!
rabbis and ..ministers to mind his business"; who attacks the Press, and
charges it with the responsibility of the war with Spain; who speaks mock
ingly of President McKlnley as "a low politician," and says that It was
honesty among thieves that made De Lome so express himself; and who then
turns upon the people themselves present and taunts them with their ignor

"Youâ youâ you fools," she cried, "you slaves, who prate of humanity! Did
you interfere In humanity's name when Sheriff Martin and the other murder
ers, his deputies, shot the strikers down? O, no, you did nothing oi. the kind!
You believe what you're told to believe, you do what you're told to do You
stand like cattle before the bulletin boards with the war news. What for my
friends, what for? That the ruling classes may rejoice; that the yoke may
press tighter upon you; that your blood and your body and your purse may
suffer. And then you talk of freedom, of liberty!"
O, the contempt in this woman's voice! O, the power she has over this
large audience that shouts bravos and stamps and roars in response to her
fiery words!
"Ab if a workingman could ever be free! Why, you are slaves, slaves.
And 'the brave boys, the brave boys.' "she went on, quoting sarcastically. "I
say 'the brave boy' who goes to offer himself In battle while his father slaves
and sweats at home and hia sister sells herself In the streets deserves the lash
â and I hope he gets it."
I asked Miss Goldman later whether she didn't fear to address men in
such terms as this. ' :
"Never," she answered. "I have talked to workingmen at the mines, in Chi
cago, during strikes and never once was molested."
She doesn't mince words, this fierce, scornful woman. She denounces tno
present warâ all warsâ as a relic of a barbarous time. She declares that the
men we honorâ Washington. Jefferson, and Wendell Phillipsâ were not patri
ots, but rebels. She deplores love of country because it makes one intolerant.
"Do you mean to tell me, ' she demands, one little hand outstretched and
the other braced upon her hip; "do you mean to tell me that it is wise and
noble to throw yourselves like wild beasts upon the Spaniards, and that you'll
believe it perfectly wise and perfectly legal and noble simply because you'ic
told so by the press and the pulpiiâ the pulpit," slie sneered, "for war!â and
the monopolists and the Government that is not by the people and for the
people? They tell you you'd tear yourselves to pieces if you had no leaders
Who does the lynching in the South -the white or the black?"
Miss Goldman's speech is epigrammatic; it is highly quotable. "The worli
is my country, r she declares. "To do good is my only religion." Frc<sdorn
freedom, is her cry. According to her creed every barrier is tyranny every
Government, all laws, an imposition.
And the remedy?
"1 may be a fool; I am not a prophet," she answered a question firm
the gallery, with a swagger, the only betrayal of self-consciousness she was
guilty of last night.
This small fire-brand will suggest no remedy save this:

Acquitted of Embezzlement.
Charles P. Harris, a stockbroker, who
failed in 1596 and was accused of the em
bezzlement of $1800 worth of stock belong
ing to Mrs. Jeannette A. Jordan, was ac
quitted yesterday by a Jury In Judge
Wallace's court. After listening to the
testimony for the prosecution Judge Wal
lace instructed the jury to acquit, as the
evidence entirely failed to substantiate
the charge of embezzlement.
Poolsellers Sentenced.
W. H. Coleman. who was convicted by
a jury In Judge Campbell's court last Fri
day of violating the pool ordinance, was
yesterday sentenced to pay a fine of $40.
The smallness of the penalty was owing
to the fact that the jury recommended
Coleman to the leniency of the court. No
tice of appeal was given and the bonds
were fixed in $500.
Charged With Burglary.
Richard Leonard, alias J. D. Lord, and
John Leishman were arrested yesterday
afternoon by Policemen Phelan and Me-

THE MAYOR
MAY HAVE
TO PAY
Dividing the Respon
sibility for the
Shortage.
The Company Insuring
Widber Is After the
Coin Counters.
It Contends Mr. Phelan Could
and Should Have Pre
vented Theft
NEGLECTED A GRAVE DUTY
Wlcl bar's Estate Will Be Levied on
Flratand Then Those Who Should
Have Counted.
It seems now as If the board that
should have properly counted the money
in the treasury as a guarantee against
just such a combination of circumstances
as led to the exposure of A. C. Widber
will have to bear more than the mere
censure of the public. The surety com
pany in which Widber was insured has
decided to make a demand first upon the
estate of the defaulter and then upon the
president of the board which should have
counted the money, the contention being
that had the money been properly count
ed each. month the shortage would never
have occurred.
Edwin Waxfleld, president of the
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Mary
land, which was Widber's sole surety, ar
rived In the city yesterday morning and
left last evening, the object of his flying
trip being to investigate and confer and
decide upon the course the company
should adopt. There was a conference in
his apartments at the Palace Hotel yes
terday at which Mayor Phelan was an
earnest and interested member, and the
result was a formal demand upon the
city to bring proceedings, iirst against
whatever estate Widber may have and
then upon the chairman of the board that
should have counted the money.
The position of the company was out
lined to the Mayor In the following com
munication, a copy of which was given
him:
To the City and County of San Francisco:
Although no demand has been made upon us,
we. taking notice of the fart that one Augus
tus C. Widber, formerly the Trt-asurer of the
City and County of San Francisco, has de
faulted In the sum of one hundred and
eighteen thousand dollars, more or less and
that we, the Fidelity and Deposit Company of
Maryland, a corporation liiily organized,
created and existing under and by virtue of
the laws of the State of Maryland, are the
sole surety from the first <>t January, 18Â»7,
upon the official bond of said Augustus C.
Widber for the sum of one hundred thousand
dollars, do hereby state that In entering upon
said bond o? said Augustus i\ Widber, we ac
cepted and became liable upon the same un
der and by virtue of the law that required the
President of the Board of Supervisors in con-
Junction with the County Judge and Auditor
of said city and county every month, to
examine the books of the said Treasurer, and
shall be permitted, and It shall be their duty,
to see and count over all the moneys re
maining In the hands of such Treasurer, and
it appearing to us that said President of the
Board of Supervisors and County Judge and
Auditor have wholly failed In the perform
ance of their duties to examine tha fiuoks of
the said Treasurer and to see and count over
all the money remaining In the hands of such
Treasurer.
. Now, Therefore, we state for the benefit of
the said city and county of San Francisco
that we require It under the law of the .State
of California, relating to the rights of sure
ties to proceed against the said Augustus Â«_'.
\\ idber and his estate and to pursue its rem
edy against the President of the Board of
Supervisors, and .all other persons who may
be liable and responsible in the premises and
to take all other remedies which the said
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland
cannot. Itself, pursue, and which would
llghtun Its burden.
Thereafter the said Fidelity and Deposit
Company waiving all technicalities nereb" de
clares that it will pay any balances or deficit
for which It may be liable under it; bond and
the law and to the full extent thereof.
. Fidelity, and Deposit Company of Maryland,
per EDWIN WARFIEI.D. President.
Another letter demanding that suit be
brought against the estate of Widber was
also served upon the Mayor, and also a
third letter, in which the position of the
company is again outlined and the de
mand is made that the Mayor be made a
party to another suit for recovery.
"We are not raising technicalities," s.aid
Mr. Warfleld, in speaking of his company,
"but we have a right under the law to
seek every means of lightening the bur
den upon us either by recovery from the
estate of the persona we guarantee or by
suit and recovery .against those whose
business it was not only to protect him
but to protect us. We had what was
called a thirty-day risk on Widber-^-that
is, we went on his bond with the knowl
edge that the monoy in his charge was re
quired to be counted every thirty days by
a responsible board or commission, and
with the expectation and the tacit under
standing that the officials whose duty it
was to serve on this board would attend
to their duties. We did not insure them
for the performance, consequently we
cannot be held responsible for what hap
pened aa a result of their dereliction.
"We contend that the shortage would
never have taken place had Widber
known that the money would be carefully
counted every month; and we assert that
the way in which it was counted gave
him the knowledge that he could steal
from the treasury with impunity; fur
ther, granting that the money was prop
erly counted every month, it is plain that
the shortage would have been discovered
long before it had reached the sum It was
eventually found to be, and therefore by
their neglect the commissioners have ren
dered us liable for two or three times as
much as we would have had to pay had
they discovered the defalcations a3 soon
as they should have done.
"We do not object to pay the loss, and
we will not raise technicalities, but we
have a right to redress from those who
have made such a defalcation possible by
neglecting a duty designed to make such
a state of affairs impossible."
It is expected that Widber's estate will
be large enough to cover a good part of
the defalcation. He Is said to own an in
terest in a mine worth ?50,000, which has
upon its dumps sufficient ore to yield $50 -
00- more. The surety company is entitled
to all this, and having obtained it the
liability of the Mayor and his financial
assistants will occupy the attention of
the courts.
THE MAYOR RESISTANT.
Ho Charges the Guarantee Company
With Having Adopted Equivo
cal Methods.
Mayor J. D. Phelan is much exercised
over the prospect of being compelled to
make good the ex-Treasurer's shortage,
and last night Issued the following state
ment:
"I saw President Warfleld of the Fidel
ity and Deposit Company of Maryland by
appointment at 4 o'clock this afternoon
In his room at the Palace Hotel. City
and County Attorney Creswell was with
me. Representing the company was not
only the president, but its attorney. C. H.
Wilson of 590 Califftmia street, and for
a part of the time Mr. Pelxotto, repre
senting ex-Treasurer Widber, was also
present.
"This is the first time I have had any
communication with the company, the
bond having been approved by Mayor Su
tro. There is nothing in the bond that re
quires the Mayor, Auditor and Superior
.Hidgt. to count the money in the treas
ury and report the condition of the treas
ury to the company, and so far as I am
aware no report was ever made to the
company, nor did they request any re
port. They simply insured the fidelity of
the Treasurer to the extent of $100,000. Mr.
Warfield said that no man was better in
dorsed than ex-Treasurer Widber; that
Before giving the bond they had made a
careful investigation and had reports
from leading bankers and citizens of San
Francisco as to his honesty. They were
in constant communication with him,
sending him printed blanks to fill out, so
not only before they gave the bond, but
during his term of ottice, they made in
quiries as to his methods of doing busi
ness. Like every other insurance corr.
panyâ fire insurance, accident insurance,
elevator insurance, boiler insuranceâ the
Companies' representatives are supposed
to keep their company informed as to the
condition of the insured.
"Hence, when the president said that
its liability was affected by anything out
side of the dishonesty of ex-Treasurer
Widber the City and County Attorney
and myself were surprised. He and Mr.
Wilson said that they intended to ask
the Board of Supervisors to sue Widber
tirst, and then to sue the Mayor, the Au
ditor and the Superior Court, and if re
covery could not be had for tne shortage
from these sources, then they might con
sider the payment of the bond. Tney said
they had letters prepared which tney in
tended to send to the Board of Supervi
sors and exhibited copies of them, hand
ing me one.
"I explained to the president that the
auditor, Superior Judge and myself
counted the money, that nearly two
thirds of the money in the vault was al
ways in trays and easily counted, and
that the other third was in sacKs sealed
by the Mint and tagged, showing the
contents; that we weighed several of
these sacks taken at haphazard and
counted others, always finding them cor
rect, and that that was the method of
counting gold coin contained in sacks
pursued by all banking and commercial
institutions. That was our method, and
when we did it we discharged our duty.
He thought that we ought to have count
ed every coin and locked it up in a safe
and sealed it, and as long as our own
seals remained unbroken to consider it
all there, which would have facilitated
the count and not required three days of
our time every month. I tolrl him that
that method was exposed to the same
danger that we' experienced in accepting
the Mint seals, because our own seals
could have been forged. We simply rested
upon the universal practice of accepting
Mint seals, a practice which is in daily
vogue in San Francisco.
"He said, cutting oft' further discussion,
that the company and its attorney had
agreed upon a plan of action as outlined
in *he letters requesting the Board of
Supervisors to sue, as I stated to you be
fore. I asked him if he had not con
sidered the proposition of giving all of
Widber's property to a trustee and realiz
ing upon it for the common benellt of the
ex-Treasurer, the surety company and
the city. He said that they had con
sidered t'nnt. Attorney Peixotto for his
client had proposed to City and County
Attorney Creswell, which was agreeable
to the City and County Attorney and to
me, to have the surety company, pay ita
obligation and then, all three parties
agreeing upon a trustee, for the oky to
release its attachments and turn it over
to the trustee for the common benefit, to
be realized on as speedily as possible.
This is the proposition I expected to dis
cuss to-day, but the president and his
attorney had evidently decided to act
without our advice or assistance.
"Then came a remarkable phase of this
interview, which led me to conclude that
the company was playing a game in
which they expected to interest me.
They intimated that I personally could
well afford to pay the deficit. I said
jocularly that I was endeavoring to brine
about an economical administration of
the city's affairs, and that the deficit
would serve my purpose because the
money could not be appropriated out of
the treasury that was not there. Then
Mr. Wilson said that they did not waive
their right to criminally prosecute of
ficers whose alleged neglect exposed
Widber to temptation. I asked him very
sharply what he meant. He said he
meant"that the company might criminally
prosecute the officers whose duty it- was
to count the money and bring the case
before the Grand Jury. I turned to Mr.
Warfield and said, 'Does Mr.. Wilson
speak for the company when he makes
that statement?' Mr. Warfield did not
answer, and I asked him again if the
company was responsible for the state
ment of Mr. Wilson, and he said yes, the
company was disposed to prosecute
criminally any one who was Instrumental
in causing it loss.
"I looked upon this as a threat border
ing very closely upon blackmail, and re
alized that they were banking upon a
supposed hostility of the Board of Super
visors toward .me personally, and you
will mark that in their letters to the
Board of Supervisors they mention me
particularly; and also upon my supposed
ability to pay in order to avert the con
sequences of their threat. When this was
mentioned I retorted hotly that they
were going out of tne bounds of their
business, and that- they wouiu meet with
resistance if they indulged in it. For my
part I considered the interview at an end.
Of course, if they prosecute anybody
criminally they would have to prosecute
not only the Mayor and the Audit )r but
most of the Judges of the Superior Court,
â who acted with these officers in counting
the money.
"The gist of the matter is that the com
pany has decided to ask the Supervisors
to sue first ex-Treasurer Widber and then
the Mayor, Auditor and Judges of the
Superior Court, ano exhaust mem nrst.
Then if they cannot recover from these
officers they say they will probably pay. |
Jlv lawyers advise that the proposition ;
is absurd; that, they have insured the:
fidelity of the Treasurer. He uas proved
unfaithful and the city can. recover from
the Treasurer and his bondsmen as,prin
cipal and surety, and I believe that suit
should be brought at once and for that
purpose. . ..
"I will call a special meeting of the
Board of Supervisors for next Thursday,
at 2- o'clock, to act upon the communica
tions of the company. There is great ur
gency, for this reason, that unless this
money is recovered from this foreign cor
poration in the Federal courts speedily,
the business of the city for the balance
of the fiscal year will in many respects
come to a standstill. No street work can
be done; Market street can not be paved;
bills for subsistence of prisoners and
other expenses of the city government
can not be met, and as no money can be
paid out of the next fiscal year for con
tracts accruing in this fiscal year, the
machinery of the government will stop
unless provision is made by recovery on ,
this bond. The .Board of Supervisors are ;
entitled to early legal advice as to the
methods of proceeding, and the city's at
torneys should have the suit on the bond
immediately instituted. We can not af
ford to trifle with a company whose
methods, to say the least, are so equiv
ocal. They are evidently trying to avoid
their liability, after assuming it with a
full knowledge which they independently
acquired of the reputation and character
of the ex-Treasurer, and after charging
him $500, which probably came out of the
city's strong: box, as the price for the
bond. The Treasurer never did, nor could
he, refuse them the privilege of investi
gating his office, and they must pay for
their neglect. Widber was a good risk
when they took him. and now that he is
a total loss, they must pay.
"I will use every effort, officially and
otherwise, to compel them to meet this
obligation, and I shall not approve any
bond of their company hereafter, now
thai I have an insight into their meth
ods."

The boy had been amusing himself out \

but abandoned because no water was
found, and removed the boards which
covered it. His mother missed him from
the yard and went in search of him.
When she saw tne cover had been taken
from the well she surmised that the boy
had fallen into it. and found that her
supposition was correct. Neighbors were
summoned and the child taken Into the
house. Dr. Simpson was called, but the
child was dead before he arrived. The
doctor signed a death certificate, so the
body was not taken to the Morgue and

REVIVES THE
CARNIVAL IDEA
San Rafael Will Have a
Floral Festival After
All.
Decision Reached at a Mass-
Meeting of the Town's
Citizens.
Heated Arguments and Sensational
Charges Result From a Difference
of Opinion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April . 26.â At a
mass meeting held to-night at Coch
rane-McNear Hall a strenuous effort
was made to reanimate the corpse of
the proposed rose festival. Attorney
Cochrane was elected chairman and a
free discussion followed. Judge Duf
flcy spoke warmly in favor of. the pro
posed festival and H. Phillips came to
his support with a resolution to the ef
fect that the executive committee go
on with the carnival. Others also
snoke in favor of holding the festival.
After the proponents had their in
ning the "cold water" brigade- took the
meeting in hand. W. M. Anderson, the
chairman of the executive committee,
said the carnival could not be carried
on.
Professor Collins said that if the
ladies' committee refused to act enough
school children could not be got into
line to make the American flag in the
procession.
Director-General Newhall gave a
statement of the finances in the hands
of the executive committee. He said
he was in favor of waiting until the
fall, and then holding a chrysanthemum
festival.
Bitter feeling was engendered by T.
H. Rush stating he could not see where
some of the money paid in had
gone. Director-General Newhall took
the remarks as personal, and. advanc
ing to the platform, where Hush was
acting as secretary, threateningly
asked if any insinuation were intended
regarding himself in the statements
made by the secretary. Newhall stated
most emphatically that Rush was a
member of the executive committee and
knew where all the money had gone
and that it had been judiciously ex
pended.
Rush replied that he had meant
nothing reflecting on the integrity or
ability of Mr. NewhaU, but he adhered
to the original assertion.
Rush's explanation brought mors
heated talk, but it gradually cooled
down and a motion was carried by a
fair majority that the festival as
planned be carried out.
When the result was announced I.
C. Gieske, one of the executive commit
tee men, handed in his resignation.

and the feeling in the city over
the proposed festival Is so bitter that
it is thought if it is carried to an issue
it will receive but feeble support, and
that it will not be a success.
