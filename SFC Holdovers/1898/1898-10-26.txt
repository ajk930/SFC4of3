Fail to Secure
a Tote of Con
fidence.
PARIS, Oct. 25.â Very few persons
have thought of Fashoda to-day.
There has been more immediate
ly exciting matter on hand. All
the afternoon the center of the
town has been in a ferment. Favorite
Deputies have been wildly cheered, and
unpopular ones franctlcally howled
down. About 150 arrests have been
made. It is not yet quite clear how
many persons have been injured.
Among them, at any rate, are three po
lice agents.
Several mild charges of cavalry have
been made. The crowd so far as pos
sible has been kept on the move or
broken up by police cuirassiers and
mounted municipal guards.
Hundreds of copies of a strongly re
visionist paper have been piled up and
burned as an expression of disap
proval.
While this tumult was being dealt
with in the street a sort of Donnybrook
fair was going on in the Chamber of
Deputies. Dreyfus was naturally the
cause. Deputies hurled insults about
with impartial recklessness, and in the
midst of an indescribable hubbub Gen
eral Chanoine, Minister of War, re
signed his portfolio.
This was a bolt from the blue. Every
body supposed he was in favor of re
vision of the Dreyfus case, seeing he
remained Minister of War in the Cab
inet that had decided upon it. His de
claration then that he was of the same
opinion as his predecessors about the
affair came as a complete surprise.
The Chamber of Deputies then ad
journed to give the minority time to
consult as to steps to be taken. When
It reassembled the Brieson Ministry was
quickly added to the list of those that
have been.
One thing: was made very clear to
dayâthat is the affection in which the
army Is held by the people. Every-

DAYS OF BOULANGISM \
RETURNING IN FRANCE
LONDON, Oct. 26.â The Paris
correspondent of the Times says:
The days of Boulangism are re
turning without a Floquet to
draw the sword against a fac
tious general and without a con
testant to make him cross the
frontier. The country has been
overturned on a mere pretext by
those defying authority while
pretending to defend it and who
fomented agitation and almost
terror. In the Rue Royale the
rioters tried to overturn a car
riage containing three Americans,
with cries of "Down with the
Jews."
Evidently the taste for street
demonstrations Is reviving and
perhaps on Thursday, when the
Court of Cassation will meet,
there will be a renewal of the up
roar.
It looks as though M. Brisson
gave up in disgust a position
which yielded neither pleasure
nor greatness. Nobody has any
idea who will succeed him unless,
perhaps, M. Faure knows, for he
is alleged to have instigated the
overthrow of the Cabinet.
where the troops were greeted with
cheering, and everywhere willing obe
dience was paid to their instructions to
keep moving. There is also a notable
relaxation in public feeling to-night
from the tension of the last few
months. At the same time every one is
asking what next. Is this the end or
only the beginning?
MOBS IN STREETS
AND TUMULT IN TI-|E
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES
PARIS, Oct. 25.â Strong bodies of po
lice were stationed in the neighborhood
of the Palais Bourbon and the Place
de la Concorde to-day to prevent the
projected demonstrations at the open
ing of the Chamber of Deputies. The
French Cabinet met this morning and
the Minister of Marine, M. Lockroy,
announced that he would shortly intro
duce a scheme for the administration

and financial reorganization of the
navy.
A meeting of Progressives and Re
publicans decided not to support the
Government's Internal policy, but to
uphold to the fullest extent Its foreign
policy.
There was considerable disorder
about the approaches of the Palais de
Bourbon when MM. Deroulede, Mllle
voye and other Deputies arrived, ac
companied by a crowd of supporters.
Members of the League of Patriots,
who were crossing the Place de la Con
corde, shouted "Vive I'Armee!" and the
Republican Guards were obliged to
clear a passage. A conflict with the
police ensued, in which a number of
Anti-Semites attacked and injured a
commissary of police with loaded canes.
The ringleader, M. Guerin, president
of the Antl-Semltlc League, was ar
rested.
When M. Drumont, the Anti-Semitic
leader, arrived there were further dis
turbances, with cries of "Down with
the Jews!" and cheering for France. A
detachment of cuirassiers charged and
dispersed the mob and several more
arrests were made.
The session of the Chamber of Depu
ties had no sooner opened that M.
Deroulede made a violent attack upon
the Minister of War, General Cha
noine, whereupon the latter arose and
explained the conditions under which
he accepted the portfolio. In so doing
he declared that he was of the same
opinion as his predecessors, referring
to the question of reopening the Drey
fus case, a remark which was greeted
with cheers and protests, the uproar
lasting five minutes.
When General Chanolne was able to
resume speaking he asserted that he
was the guardian of the honor of the
army, and concluded with saying an
grily:
"I place in your hands the trust I re
ceived and I tender my resignation in
this tribune."
The announcement was received with
loud cheering.
General Chanoine then left the
Chamber of Deputies and the Premier,
M. Brisson, ascended the tribune. There
he was greeted with shouts of "Re
sign!" while the Leftists cheered him
lustily.
SCENE OF THE DISTURBANCES IN PORIS.
The Place de la Concorde was crowded yesterday with excited members of the League of Patriots, who shouted "Vive l'Armee," while the Antfc
Semetic League also turned out, its members crying "Down with the Jews." All this was due to the opening of the Chamber of Deputies,
and the throngs in the streets had several encounters vith the police.

M. Brisson said that General Chano
ine's declaration was a complete sur
prise to him, as the general had been
present at the meeting which decided
to submit the documents in the Drey
fus case tc the Court of Cassation.
The general, M. Brisson continued, did
not then raise any objection.
Continuing, the Premier said that the
Government was fully determined to
uphold the civil power against the
military, and he asked for a suspen
sion of the business of the Chamber,
which was granted.
After the Chamber of Deputies had
resumed business at 5 o'clock. M. Bris
son announced that the "irregular res
ignation" of General Chanoine had been
accepted, and that his successor ad in
terim would be appointed this evening.
The Premier, then proposed that the
Chamber adjourn until Thursday next.
and he concluded his re-marks with re
affirming the supremacy of the civil

etc., their remarks being punctuated
with interruptions and cheers. M.

ing M. Meline, approved M. Brisson's
statement, and added:
"We have every confidence in the
army, and do not wish to see it attack
ed. All Republicans are united on Â«his
subject."
M. Demahy then proposed a resolu
tion calling upon the Government \o2
end the campaign of insult against the
army, but M. Brisson refused to accept
it.
M. Cavaignac, the former Minister cf
War, then rushed to the tribune raid
demanded an immediate discussion of
the resolution. lie was greeted with
hostile shouts, including "Sabre, ' "For
gery." "Razor," which caused a great
uproar. The shouting of the word "Ra
zor" was an allusion to the suicide of
the late Colonel Henry, who is said to
have cut his throat in his cell at the
Fortress of Mont Valerien, after con
fessing to having forged one of the
Dreyfus documents, though it has since
bull claimed the razor with which the
deed was committed was not found in
the cell of the deceased.
M. Brisson then accepted the order of
the day, proposed by M. Ribot, affirm
ing the supremacy of the civil over the
military power.
Several of the Deputies attempted to
pp.ak, but their voices were drowned
in ihÂ» up/oar which filled the Cham
ber.
The order of the day was adopted by
a vote of 259 ayes to 2 noes.
An amendment proposed by M. Ber
ger, censuring the Government " for
not causing the honor of the army to
be respected," was lost By 274 to 261
Votes.
M. Demahy then proposed a resolu
tion calling upon the Government to
"end the campaign of insult against the
army."
The president refused to accept the
motion, however, and a/vote was taken
on it, amid so much confusion that
scrutiny was demanded. Later this
showed that the Government was de-
feated by a vote of 296 to 243.
After the resolt of the scrutiny had
been announced M. Berteau moved a
vote of confidence in M. Brisson, which
was rejected by a vote of 286 to 254.
Whe% this vote was declared the Min
istors left the Chamber.
After the Ministers had withdrawn
the Chamber adopted, amid cries of
'â¢Down with the Jews," the order of the
day, combining the motions of M. Ri
bot and M. Demahy by a vote of 460
to 28.
A fresh tumult was aroused by the
declaration of M. Deboudrey d'Asson,
Deputy for the Arrondissement of Los
Sables d'Olonne, in the Department of
Vendee, that all the Ministers except
General Chanoine ought to be im
peached.
The Chamber adjourned to Novem
ber 4.
The Senate, after a brief session, ad
journed.
After the Chamber adjourned 10,000
people sang the "Marseillaise" around a
bonfire mad of the Dreyfus paper, "Les
Drifts de l'Homme" (the right of man).
All the stores In the neighborhood were
closed in anticipation of rioting. The
cuirassiers, assisted by the mounted
republican guards, succeeded in driv
ing back another . crowd which was
shouting "Spit upon Brisson."
As this dispatch is sent a big crowd
is gathering and organizing a mani
festation in front of the military club.
By 4 o'clock In the afternoon about
150 arrests had been made. The crowds
continually augmented until the
vicinity of the Chamber of Deputies
was black with people cheerinjc Gen
eral Chanoine and the army.
The cuirassiers had the greatest diffi
culty in clearing a way around the
Madeline and the Rue Royale. There
were many encounters between the
people and the police.
It is the general impression amonjr ;
the Deputies that President Faure will
invite Alexander E. Ribot to form a
Cabinet.
This evening detachments of muni
cipal guards, cuirassiers and police are
massed at the various approaches to
the palace of the Elysee for fear of dis
turbances.
M. lirisson went to the Elysee at 7
o'clock.
President Faure has signed the ap
pointment of M. Lockroy, Minister of
Marine, in the retiring Cabinet, as Min
ister of "War ad interim.
While accepting the resignation of
the Ministry M. Faure begged M. Bris
son and his colleagues to continue to
act until the formation of the new
Cabinet.
DEMONSTRATIONS
{3ND COLLISIONS
WITH THE POLICE
PARIS, Oct. 26, 1 a, m.â About mid
night a mob of members of the Patri
otic League smashed the windows and
glass staircase of a shop whose owner is
said to be a Jew, at the corner of Rue
Aber and the Rue Scribe.
The vigilance committee of the So
cialist party issued to-night a mani
festo condemning the action of General
Chanoine and denouncing the "make
believe republicans who have strangled
debate in the Chamber and created a
crisis."
The committee has decided to organ
ize all the socialists and revolutionary
republican forces in the country against
"military and clerical reaction." M.
Faure has issued no statement to-night,
but he will consult this morning with
the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.
After the adjournment of the Cham
ber of Deputies there was intense ex
citement followed by street demonstra
tions.
At many points the boulevard became
almost impassable and there were
numerous collisions between the dem
onstrators and the police.
Only with the utmost difficulty was
a semblance of order preserved, and in
many cases it was necessary for the
cuirassiers to clear the streets.
COLLISION OF THE
ROYALISTS AND
THE REPUBLICANS
PARIS, Oct. 25.-About 10 o'clock a
band of youthful royalists formed in
front of the Military Club, and, after
cheering for the army, marched, pre
ceded by the tricolor, toward the of
firos of the Soleil and the Gaulois,
singing, "C'Est Gammale, que'ell nos
Faut." (We need Gammele, we must
have Gammele ) Gammele 1b a nick
name for the Duke of Orleans and the
reference to the story that the Duke,
when entering the army, expressed the
desire to eat from the gammele or soup
bowl of a private.
On arriving at the boulevard this
demonstration, which had grown to
several thousands, met a rival repub
lican organization. A violent collision
took place and the republicans cap
tured the royalist flag, which increased
the tumult.
MINISTERS RETIRE
TO AVOID THE GREAT
STREET DISTURBANCES
PARIS, Oct. 26.â General Chanolne Is
tbe fifth Minister of War who has de
clared himself absolutely convinced of
the guilt of Dreyfus, and the third who
resigned on that account. His totally
inexplicable and unexpected act was
the chief sensation of the day. He dealt
a veritable coup de jarnac to the Cabi
net, and precipitated a new strueele
between the military and naval author
ities.
Yesterday (Tuesday) was the first
time General Chanoine ever sat on the
Ministerial bench, and his colleagues
knowing that he was unacustomed to
the tricks of oratorical efforts, such as
M. Deroulede indulged in, tried vainly
to prevent his ascending the tribunal.
He spoke briefly, with painful incoher
ence, and then literally bolted from the
chamber.
The scenes that followed were almost
indescribable. When M. Brisson ap
peared in the tribunal he was greeted
with insults and imprecations from all
sides. But he stood his ground calmly.
A lady who was leaving the gallery
after the adjournment, on being asked
by a Deputy how she enjoyed it all, re
plied, â¢'lmmense. Wasn't it delirious?
So much better than the Comedie Fran
caise."
"Yes," replied the Deputy, "and this
is only the beginning."
It Is said that President Faure de
clined to receive General Chanoine
when the latter called at the Elysee af
ter bolting the chamber.
M. Faure sent out word that he could
only receive Chanoine's resignation
through M. Brisson.
In a subsequent interview between
if. Faure and M. Brisson, it was agreed
that the Portfolio of War could cnlv
be entrusted to a civilian in order to
assert the subordination of military au
thorities.
Even now it is difficult to state clear- t
ly why the Ministry resigned, but there
is a general belief that it was in order )
to avoid, if possible, serious street dem
onstrations fomented by Messrs. De
roulede and Drumont, who have been j
the heroes of the night's proceedings.
Altogether some 250 arrests have been
made. Nothine is now heard about
Fashoda, but it is regarded as extreme
ly probable that the Cabinet crisis will
be utilized to put M. Hanotaux back in
the Foreign Office. M. Meline is also
mentioned as a possible new Premier
to succeed the retiring Brisson, who
has succeeded himself.

AND WATERWAYS
Annual Report of the
Chief of Engineers.
WHAT THE WAR HAS SHOWN
VALUE OF SHORE BATTERIES
AND SUBMARINE MINES.
Appropriations Recommended for the
Improvement of Pacific
Coast Rivers and
Harbors.
WASHINGT-N, Oct. 25.â The annual
report of Brigadier General John M.
Wilson, chief of engineers, U. S. A., has
been made to the Secretary of War. In
consequence of the war with Spain that
portion of the report relating to fortifi
cations is most interesting. Upon this
point General Wilson says:
During the fiscal year projects of per
manent seacoast defenses were prepared
and approved by the Secretary of War
for Port Royal, S. C, St. Johns River,
Fla., Tampa, Fla. , and Sabine Pass,
Texas, making thirty localities in the
United States for which projects of per
manent defenses have thus far been ap
proved under the general scheme pro
posed in ISSG by the Endicott board. At
the close of the fiscal year the construc
tion of permanent modern defensive
works was in progress in 250 localities.
In consequence of the war with Spain
and the possibilities of hostile attacks up
on our coasts, urgent and pressing de
mands were made by Senators, Represen
tatives and local business men for the
immediate erection of seacoast batteries
at numerous points not contemplated in
the general scheme of national defense.
In the absence of any available modern
armament the Secretary ot War directed
the immediate construction of temporary
batteries, mounting ukl style armament
and siege guns for the -defense of a num
ber of exposed localities, including some
which are embraced in the national
scheme of defense.
While no hostile attacks were made upon
our sea coasts during the war with Spain,
the operations of the American fleet on
the coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico have
amply demonstrated the value of coast
defenses, including shore batteries and
submarine mines, in resisting naval at
tacks. One other important deduction
may also be drawn from the results of
the war, namely, the great value and effi
ciency of the rapid-fire gun. It is gratify
ing to report that not only have a consid
erable number of these rapid-fire guns
been mounted during the year, but that
provision ha* been made for the manu
facture and placing of a large additional
number.
Existing projects for seacoast defenses
contemplate the emplacement of about
800 heav;. guns of S, 1", 12 and 16 inches,
about TOO rapid-fire guns of various cali
bers, and about 1000 mortars. These fig
ures are subject to slight changes. The
estimated approximate cost of the engi
neers' work included with the installa
tion of this work is $55,000,000.
Detailed estimates for next year's
river and harbor work include the fol
lowing work on the Pacific Coast:
San Diego Harbor, $S0.OO0; Deepwater
Harbor, San Pedro Bay, $400,000; San Luis
Obiapo Harbor, $70,000; Oakland Harbor,

BOSS PEA'S GANG
STILL A MENACE
Voters Will Be at Its
Mercy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 25.â "Jim" Rea's
handiwork is plainly discernible in the
appointment of the list of election offi
cers made by the Board of Supervisors
yesterday, and it now looks as though
the voters of this cit" will be given an
other exhibition of the disreputable tac
tics that characterized the gang's vic
tory at the Republican primaries.
With only a few exceptions the same
inspectors, judges and clerks have been
named. At the primaries respectable
citizens were deprived of their votes,
and ballot-box stuffing and the grossest
frauds were perpetrated. All the toughs
and hoodlums in the city were out in
force working at the polls and the peo
ple who refused to vote the gang ticket
were jostled and insulted.
These same election officers have been
put in the polling places again, and Rea
and the Mackenzies will make the most
of the advantage. The officers of the
primary election were appointed by the
Republican County Central Committee
at the request of Rea. Now the Board
of Supervisors have named the same
men, and it is presumed Boss Rea dic
tated the list. The Democrats appoint
ed are friendly to Rea.
In the country precincts the election
officers are of a better class than in the
city. The gang cannot get men in these
places to do their dirty work, and con
sequently fair elections are held. But
the gang has taken steps to cut down
any majority obtained In the country,
and anything will be resorted to in the
city to gain a big vote.
There are seventy-two precincts in
the county, and, as each precinct has
an election board of eight, there are 576
election officers in the county. This
gives the gang quite an army of work
ers. Each of these officers will average
at least $10 for his work, so hen; is
a corruption fund of $5760. There may
be a few anti-gang men among them,
but it is safe to wa?Â»r the number will
not equal twenty-five.
By law the Democrats are entitled
to one-half the officers, but, as year af
ter year the lists they have submitted
to the Supervisors have been ignored,
they consider themselves fortunate to
get any kind of a Democrat on the
board this year.
The Good Government League and
other reform forces are taking step* to
head off the wholesale perpetration of
the grossest of frauds on election day.
Watchers are to be appointed at all the
polls, and those discovered at the
slightest fraud will be prosecuted.
Now that Boss Rea has been convicted,
the people are satisfied that the min
ions of the boss and Mackenzie are not
exempt from punishment. The election
of James H. Campbell as District At
torney is assured, and with this gentle
man in office evil-doers will get their
Just deserts. Rea has controlled that
office for the past four years, and any
attempt to punish gangsters has been
quashed. The Good Government Leairue
has raised a fund especially for the
prosecution of ballot-box stuffers and
other perpetrators of election frauds,
and the methods employed by the gang
to intimidate voters and carry the Re
publican primaries will not be toler
ated.
EPISCOPALIANS
END THEIR WORK
Close of The Triennial
Council of 1898.
MUCH BUSINESS TRANSACTED
COMPLETE REVISION OF THE
CONSTITUTION EFFECTED.
Pastoral Read at the Closing Services
Reviewing the Past and Present
Condition of tha-
Church. ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGT-N.'Oct. 25.â After a ses
sion of three weeks the Episcopal Tri
ennial Council of 1898 came to an end
to-night. Probably never before at one
convention has the council transacted
more business than at this meeting, or
of so much vital importance to the
church. The work accomplished in
cluded a complete revision of the con
stitution with many important amend
ments, also the adoption of a number of
amendments, most of them of a minor
character, to the canons.
The new constitution will have to be
ratified by the next succeeding con
vention, three years hence, before it
becomes operative. A matter which has
received the earnest attention of the
council has been the question of church
unity, upon which an amendment to the
constitution was adopted. A readjust
ment has been made of the boundary
lines of the missionary districts in the
West and Northwestern parts of the
United States; a new diocese in India
has been created; six missionary bish

zil and discussions held bearing on the
extension of church work in Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines. The
failure of the proposed caxion on mar
riage and divorce caused considerable
surprise, but this has been left to a
committee of thirteen members to pre
pare a report to be made public nine
months before the next convention.
To-night both houses, sitting in joint
session, brought the convention to a
close with devotional exercises and thi
reading of the pastoral letter. The ser
vice was a most impressive one, the
bishops appearing in their full robes of
office.
Rev. Morgan Dix of New York read
the opening service, Bishop Gailor the
pastoral; Bishop Doane made the clos
ing prayer and Bishop Whipple pro
nounced the benediction.
The pastoral recounts briefly the
work done by the council, asks that
Whitsunday, the seventh semi-centen
nial anniversary of the book of com
mon prayer, be observed in the
churches, hails "with satisfaction the
wonderful harmony with which this
general convention, by the adoption of
an amendment to our constitution, has
without weakening the use or lowering
the value of the; prayer book, opened
the way toward training congregations
of Christians unused to our liturgical
forms, to accustom themselves by pro
cesses of education to approach and
desire them," says that "we are glad
that while insisting upon the choice of
keeping the public school system of
education free from political intrigue
or denominational intrusion to urge all
the more that it must be complemented
and consecrated by the more careful
and definite training in religious truth
in the family and in the Sunday
schools, in the church schools and col
leges, and in the careful teaching of the
clergy of the church"; recognizes the
earnest and effective work of the vari
ous organizations of the church ' and
calls attention to the fact that the list
of communicants has grown 10 per cent
in the last three years and that the
contributions during that time exceeded
those of the preceding period by $150,
114.
"We dare not face the future without
a recognition of the fact that the
church needs the stirring up of the
mills of the faithful to the plenteous
bringing forth of the fruit of good
works, of the giving of their substance
and themselves for their master's
work."
SEEKS TO CLOSE
THE POOLROOMS
H. H. Noble of Sausalito
Complains.
Special Dispatch to Tile Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 25.â H. H. Noble,
a well-known citizen of Sausalito, has
evidently arrived at the conclusion that
he can force Harrison and Harvey to
cease conducting poolrooms in that
town. By his attorneys, A. J. Treat
and C. L. Burnell, he filed a complaint
with County Clerk Bonneau to-day,
asking that the poolrooms be sup
pressed by law as detrimental to his
business and property Interests.
The documents filed are two in num
ber. The first complaint is directed
against W. H. Harrison, Charles For
rest et al. The second deals with Joe
Harvey, M. T. Bareiros et al.
Noble states that he owns certain
property situated within 150 feet of
where Harrison's business is conducted
in the Buffalo Hotel and within 380 feet
of where Harvey runs a poolroom at
19 and 21 Water street. He alleges that
both "maintain public gaming places
where money is wagered and which
premises are frequented by an idle,
vicious, dissolute, vagrant and criminal
class of persons."
These places he claims are rented by
Forrest and Bareiros with full knowl
edge of the use to which they are put.
For the reason that he believes them
to be a nuisance to th>; public peace and
comfort and that they are injuring and
will further injure in the future his
property interests Noble petitions the
court that Harrison and Harvey be re
strained from carrying on a business
which is a "nuisance," and that Forrest
and Bareiros be enjoined from renting
or leasing their property in future for
any similar games.

Hon. W. M. Cutter Will

NOT A RAILROAD MOUTHPIECE
POPULAR IN YUBA, YOLO AND
SJTTEB-.
Evidence of the Esteem in Which the
Gentleman Is Held Among
All Classes in His
I District.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE, Oct. 25.â The edi
torial attack in the Examiner of Octo
ber 20 on Hon W. M. Cutter, the Re
publican nominee for the Senate from
this district, has attracted very little
attention here. In this Senatorial Dis
trict â which comprises the counties of
Tuba, Sutter and Yoloâ there is but
scanty reference to the railroad in the
present campaign as little or no anti
railroad sentiment exists among the
W. M, Cutter, Candidate for
State Senator and the 0b-
Ject of a Vituperative Attack
Jdu the Examiner.
people. Mr. Cutter is in Yolo County
this week making his canvass among
the voters and it is difficult to com
municate with him in regard to the
Examiner's strictures. His personal
and political friends, however, indig
nantly deny the assertion that he is a
"railroad mouthpiece," and say that no
representative in the Legislature has
ever shown more independence of char
acter or been governed more entirely
by his own convictions.
The best evidence of the high regard
in which Air. Cutter is held by the peo
ple of Yuba and Sutter was afforded
after the close of the last session of the
Legislature. A few days after his re
turn to his home in Marysville he was
given a reception at the theater and a
testimonial signed by a large number
of prominent citizens was presented to
him with a release of a mortgage on his
home, the amount of the gift thus pre
sented being $1000. Among the signers
and donors were such well-known and
influential citizens as Superior Judge E.
A. Davis, N. D. Rideout, the banker;
J. H. Jewett, banker and president of
the Society of California Pioneers; F.
H. Greely of the Buckeye Flour Mills,
D. E. Knight, manufacturer and cap
italist, and many others of high stand
ing in the community. The list con
tains the names of many well-known
Democrats, including James O'Brien, J.
G. Cohn, D. P. Donahue, Sheriff of
Yuba County; W. H. Carlin, W. T.
Ellis Sr., A. C. Bingham, J. K. O'Brien,
P. J. Flannery, E. P. McDaniel, Dis
trict Attorney; Dr. E. E. Stone and
other prominent members of the Demo
cratic party.
The testimonial and presentation
were entirely non-partisan in character
and spoke volumes for the esteem and
confidence entertained for the recipient
in this community. Mr. Cutter has been
official reporter of the local courts for
nearly thirty years and in all that
period his personal integrity has never
been assailed. He has always been
noted for fearlessness and independence
in the expression of his personal opin
ions, and has never hesitated to attack
wrong and injustice through fear of
political consequences to himself.
Interviews with prominent citizens
published a few days ago by the Appeal
testify to the high esteem in which Mr.
Cutter is held by many of the most in
fluential men in Marysville and the
surrounding country. J. H. Jewett
spoke of him as "the ablest man in the
Legislature of two years ago," and de
clared that his record was excellent.
Others could be quoted to the same
effect.
There is a general expectation that
Mr. Cutter will be elected and many
Democrats have been heard to say that
they wili vote for him.
Wallace Dinsmore, chairman of the
Republican committee of Yuba County,
when asked this morning about the Ex
aminer's strictures upon Mr. Cutter
said he had heard no talk on the sub
ject and considered the attack hardly
worth attention. He said that while
Mr. Cutter had opposed cinch bills di
rected against the railroad he had al
ways in the legislature pursued a fear
less and independent course, which had
gained for him the approbation and
confidence of his constituents. Ths.
prospects, Mr. Dinsmore said, were very
good for the election of Mr. Cutter by
a decided majority. He added -that the
Republican State and Congressional
ticket would doubtless poll a large vote
in Tuba County and the general indi
cations were highly favorable for Re
publican success in both city and
county.

La Minerva says: "The English do
not admit either discussion or arbitra

complied with they are ready to make
war. This reminds one of the procedure

GET FLESH-
Get Strength, Vigor, Clear Complexion
and Good Digestion. Not by Patent
Medicine, but In Nature's Own Way
Any honest physician will tell you that
there is but one way to get increased
flesh; all the patent medicines and cod
liver oils to the contrary notwithstand-
ing.
Nature has but one way to increase
flesh, strength and vigor, mind and
body, and that is through the stomach,
by wholesome foud, well digested.
There is no reason or common sense in
other method whatever.
People are thin, run clown, nervous
pale, and shaky in tht.-ir nerves simply
because their stomachs are weak
They may not think they have dys-
pepsia, but the fact remains that they
do not eat enough food, or what they
eat is not quickly and properly digest
ed, as it should be.
Div Harlandson says the reason is
becafcse the stomach lacks certain di-
gestive acids and peptones and de-
ficient secretion of gastric Juice.
Natures remedy in sucl. cases is to
supply what the weak stomach lacks
There are several good preparations
which will do this, but none so readily
as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which
are designed especially for all stomach
troubles, and which cure all digestive
weakness on the common sense plan
of furnishing the digestive principles
which the stomach lacks.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give per-
fect digestion. First effect is to in-
crease the appetite, and increased
vigor, added flesh, pure blood and
strength of nerve and muscle is the
perfectly natural result
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the
safest tonic known and will cure any

idea spread by the dispatch of the
French Embassador here, Baron de
Counsel, that the Premier was willing
to negotiate on the whole question.
Hut the Liberal and Radical organs
still consider that the Marquis of Salis
bury's attitude admits of negotiations
promising a friendly arrangement.
The entire press, however, scouts the
idea of the possession of Fashoda com
ing within the sphere *f discussion.
The St. James Gazette says this after
noon:
"We are prepared to negotiate the
question of the western frontier of
Bahr-el-Ghazal district, but we must
control the Nile, both banks and water
sheds, from its source to the sea."
The Globe thinks the Marquis of Sal
isbury has made it clear that Major
Marchand must quit Fashoda without
conditions. "Until that is done," the
Globe says, "there can be no discussion
of the French clai^i in Africa."
The Globe points out the significant
announcement in General Kitchener's
report that he sent gunboats south
from Sebat toward Meshra-er-Kek, the
principal trading center of the Bahr-el-
Ghazal region, with instructions to es
tablish necessary outposts, and that be
fore he left he completed arrangements
for the maintenance of these stations.
"These movements." the Globe adds,
"bring our position down to the
eighth parallel of north latitude, and
the Valley of Bahr-el-Ghazal at_ this
moment is under the rule of the Khed
ive. It would be interesting to see the
effect of this revelation upon the
French Government."
The Pall Mall Gazette concludes from
the publication of the blue book that
the French Government has been given
to understand that, wholly apart from
the Fashoda question, its title to the
territory abutting on the left bank of
the Nile is "rejected as utterly unten
able, and Fiance must accept the po
sition or take the consequences."
The Westminster Gazette suggests as
the solution that the French be granted
"way leave" and "enclave" for com
mercial purposes in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
dlstriet "Way leave" is the right of
way over another's ground; "enclave"
is to shut in, to inclose a territory with
in the territories of another power.

SAN JOSE TO HAVE A
NEW SWITCH YARD
Southern Pacific Must Vacate One of
the Principle Thoroughfares
of the City.
SAX JOSE. Oct. 25.â The use of North
First street for a switch yard by the I
Southern Pacific is about to be wrested j
Pacific Railroad is about to be wrested j
from that grasping corporation. For j
years the company has been switching ;
its cars and making up trains in the thor
oughfare. Lives are daily endangered and
property has decreased, as detailed and il- \
lustrated in The Call several months ago, i
but heretofore the City Councils have re- j
fused to act In the matter. Committees
have been appointed to go to San Fran- !
Cisco and ask the Southern Pacific offi
cials to abandon the use of the street for
railroad yard purposes, but the railroad
people refused to accede to the commit- I
tees' wishes and the Council did not have
backbone enough to force an issue.
At the Council meeting yesterday after
noon Councilman Ward Wright presented
the following resolution on the subject,
which was given its first reading:
In switching; cars and making up trains at
the station or the Southern Pacific Railroad,
when It becomes necessary to pass and repays !
across First street, no engineer or other per- i
son having control of any freight locomotive j
engine shall permit such locomotive, car or
train of cars being switched, moved or made !
up to pass over or on any part of First street I
Included within Its exterior lines. It shall be !
unlawful for any engineer, brakeman, conductor j
or other person or persons navlng in charge I
any locomotive, engine, train of cars or car to i
leave the same standing upon or across any
street in the city of San Jose.
This ordinance should and will undoubt
edly be adopted. North First street is â 
one or the finest streets in the city It
is one of the main outlets, and the travel
over it is great. Beyond the depot it is
the city's finest residence district, and
here in the midst of magnificent homes '
Is situated the noted Hotel Vendome,
where guests from all over the country
corns to spend thoir summers.
Across this street a large number of
Southern Pacific trains pass daily, but the
railroad is not satisfied with this use of
the city's thoroughfare and have been
using it for a .switch yard. This blocks
teams and nut a week passes but that
death and accident is not narrowly
averted. J
The Southern Pacific owns a large tract
of land in the Polhc-mus tract, which was i
purchased a couple of years ago for rail- i
road yards, and they should be made to
remove their freight business there
BLAINE MUST GET
OUT OF THE ARMY
Makes a Personal Appeal to the Pres
ident to Save Him, but With
out Success.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.-As a last des
perate effort to be retained in the army.
Captain James G. Blame made an appeal
to-day direct to the President. Owing to
his misconduct at Honolulu and Manila
Secretary Alger decided several days ago
that young Blame must be mustered out
As final evidence of his willingness to
show leniency. Adjutant General Corbln
sent a telegram to Major General Otis
asking him if he were willing to have
Captain Blame returned to duty at Ma
nila, this being believed to be the only
course open to the Government, as his of
fenses had been committed while attached
to General Otis' army corps, and General
Otis was the only person who had a rieht
to overlook them.
It was deemed inadvisable to send Cap
tain Blame elsewhere, as the general offi
cer to whose staff he might be assigned
would probably object to being made re
sponsible for an officer who had been de
tached from one command on account of
his reprehensible conduct. General Otis'
answer was received to-night, and his de
cision can hardly result in anything short
of the mustering out of Captain Blame
General Otis cabled that there was no
place in his command for the young as
sistant adjutant general. This was con
strued to mean that Otis did not want
Blame with him at Manna.

Middle-of-the-Road Populists in Mis

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. Oct. 25. -The
State Supreme Court to-day granted the
Middle-of-the-Road Populists a writ of
mandamus to compel the Secretary of
State to place their State ticket on the
official ballot. The "regulars" claimed
the middle-of-the-roadsters were bolters

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1898.
AWAIT THE
AMERICAN
ELECTIONS
Delay of Paris Peace
Commissioners.
EACH SIDE SEEKS TIME
BUT SPAIN WELL NOT PROFIT BY
POSTPONEMENTS.
At the Cabinet Meeting at Washing
ton It Is Decided Not to Assume
Debts of the Dons
in Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 25.â The American Com
mission was in session during the whole
of this afternoon. The deliberations
of the Commissioners, however, had no
relation to the question of the Cuban
debt, upon which question the attitude
of the United States has been strictly
determined.
The Commissioners discussed the
Philippine question to-day and decided
upon the policy to follow. It is be
lieved the American Commission has
full power to deal with this matter, as
they may judge best in the interests
of the United States."
The Gaulois to-day, referring to yes
terday's joint session, says: "It is
certain that both sides will endeavor to
gain time, the Americans not wishing
to take up the Philippine question be
fore the United States' Congressional
elections have taken place and they do
not want a certain alleged mystery
previously disclosed by the Gaulois to
become known at present."
This refers to the alleged rumor that
there has been some agreement be
tween the United States and Spain out
side of the protocol regarding Spanish
sovereignty, an allegation which the
Associated Press has already declared
on high authority to be untrue.
Continuing, the Gaulois affirms that
the Spaniards are delaying a solution
of the Cuban debt until after the elec
tions in the United States, "expecting
then to get better terms," adding that
it "fears Spain does not perceive the
advantages possible to her from the
electoral situation in the United
States."
CABINET CONSIDERS
CUBAN SITUATION
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25.â At the
Cabinet meeting- to-day the situation in
Cuba was gone over for the informa
tion of those members who did not see
the President yesterday. It was ex
plained that the time limit for the evac
uation of the island had been extended
from December 1 to January 1. and that
the United States would assume con
trol of the government of the several
cities and provinces as fast as they
were evacuated by the Spaniards, but
no faster. Havana probably will be
the last of the cities to remove ita
troops and the last to surrender civil
control to the United States. This,
however, must be accomplished by the
Ist of January.
The question of the relation Porto
Rico shall bear to the General Govern
ment of the United States is receiving
the careful consideration of the Presi
dent and the members of the Cabinet.
The question of a change in the cur
rency system of the islands, the cus
toms and internal revenue laws, suf
frage and many other incidental but
highly important subjects are now un.
dfT consideration and probably will be
treated unon at some length in the
President's forthcoming message to
Congress. It is not unlikely that Con
gress will be asked to pass some need
ed general legislation respecting the
temporary government of the island
with a recommendation that a com
mission be appointed to consider with
more deliberation than is possible In a
short session of Congress all of the
questions involved and make a report
at a future time. Nothing of a dis
quieting nature has been heard from
our peace commission at Paris, the con
tention of the Spaniards that th&
United States should assume the Cu
ban debt, or any other Spanish obliga
tion, beyond the recognition as valid of
the municipal obligations of Havana
and possibly other Cuban cities, is re
ceived here with perfect equanimity.
Such a procedure is out of the question,
as our Commissioners knew before they
left Washington.
QUAKERS WELCOME
THE NAVAL Hâ¬ROES
Immense Crowd Present at the
Opening of the Philadelphia
Peace Jubilee.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 25.-Phlladel
phia lifted its hand and doffed the na
tion's hat to its naval heroes to-day. The
most illustrious actors of the war, whose
glorious end is the motive of the cele
bration, learned what the country thinks
of them. Sigsbee. Philip, Evans, Wain
wrightâthese were some of the men.
The Texas, the Gloucester, the Winslow.
the Mayflowerâ these were some of the
ships.
The Government was represented by
Secretary of the Navy Lnng; the people
by a throng that filled every bit of tim
ber on each shore of the Delaware River
and jammed every available craft to the
point of danger. The marine pageant
was one of surpassing brilliancy and
grandeur.
Secretary Long, with Lieutenant Cuth
erland and Captain Bob Evans on either
side, stationed himself on the bridge of
the May. find presently the Columbia, the
first of the warships, was reached. Her
officers and men were drawn upon deck,
and her six-pounders began to roar out
the Secretary's salute of seventeen guns.
With the beginning of the salute came
the bugle and drum salute from the ship
and before the echoes of the first shot
had been swallowed up by the boom of
the second a veritable pandemonium of
whistles, small guns and the roar of the
crowds broke out and continued through
out the procession.
The Texas, Gloucester and the Winslow
received the best share of enthusiasm.
The Kasagi's officers and men were lined
up like Americans and saluted the Sec
retary- quite as well, but as her guns are
at Armstrongs, in England, the salute
was therefore a silent onÂ«.
Apart from the naval pageant, the city
has seen a busy day preparing for to
morrow's display. Commodore Philip
to-day received the following telegram:
"Can you find a place for me in the
parade Thursday as a Confederate vet
eran and survivor of the old Merrimac?"
It was signed by R. O. Foute. a Cali
fornia Bishop who is now in Washington.
Mayor Warwick assumed charge of the
request and said Foute would be mounted
beside General Wheeler in the military
parade.
Fire Brick Trust.
MASSILLON, Ohio, Oct. 25.â William

chased and operated by a trust. It is
claimed that Eastern capital, amount
ing to H2.C00.000, is behind the scheme.
GEORGE M. CONDE DEAD.
He Was Mayor of Placerville in the
Days of Old.
George M. Conde, who was known and
esteemed by many of the pioneers of
California, died at his residence, 211S Van
Ness avenue, on Sunday morning and
was buried in the Masonic Cemetery yes
terday afternoon.
Mr. Conde was born in Schenectady, N.
V seventy-two years ago and came to
California early in the fifties. He settled
in El Dorado County, and by his many
estimable qualities soon became popular.
He was elected Mayor of Placerville in
1854 and was subsequently twice elected
to the Legislature. In 1865 Mr. Conde
came to this city and was appointed
cashier of the Farmers' and Mechanics'
Bank, a position which he held during its
existence.
The funeral services were conducted by
the Rev. M. D. Wilson, rector of St.
Peter's Episcopal Church.
IT WAS THE FERRY
SUICIDE, MRS. MILLER
HER BODY RECOVERED FROM
THE BAY YESTERDAY.
Identified by the Woman With
Whom She Lived in This
City.
The body of a woman taken from the
bay yesterday by the United States
steamship Vigilant has been Identified as
that of Mrs. Mamie Miller, the woman
who was supposed to have jumped from
the ferryboat Piedmont Saturday night.
The body was identified by Mrs. May
Howard, with whom the dead woman
lived at 292 O'Farrell street.
The Vigilant was on her way down from
Mare Island when one of the crow saw
the body floating just off the steamer's
course Lieutenant Evans, who com
mands the Vigilant, ordered the boat
stopped and the body was taken on deck
and was brought to this city.
At first It was supposed that the body
was that of a woman who lived on Du
pont street and who owns considerable
property there. A police officer declared
he knew the woman, but he could not give
her name. The body was taken to the
Morgue and there Mrs. Howard identified
it as that of her friend. Mrs. Miller. It
had been almost disrobed by the action of
the water, but the features were not
marred and Mrs. Howard had no diffi
culty in recognizing the face.
Mrs. Howard has no idea what prompt
ed the suicide to take her life. When she
left the house on O'Farrell street last
Saturday she gave no indication that she
had any suicidal purpose. She said she
had money, but immediately after leaving
the house she went to a jewelry store
and pawned a ring for $1 50. The mark on
her finger made by the ring is still visible.
When she pawned her ring she told the
jeweler she was going to take a Hammam
bath and she wanted the money for that
purpose. That is the last known of her
until her hat and purse were found on
the ferryboat.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 25.â Mrs. Ralph
Griswold, an aunt of Mrs. Miller, was
seen at her home, 1921 N street, by The
Call correspondent this evening. She had
just returned from the telegraph office,
where she had sent a message to Mrs.
Miller's parents at Eagle Grove, Ta., noti
fying them of the finding of the body.
Mrs. Griswold said:
"Mrs. Miller was a widow. Her hus
band was killed in an accident on the rail
road in the East.
"I don't see why Mrs. Miller should have
committed suicide, because she could
have come to me at any time and I would
have helped her. Her folks in the East
are of the highest respectability. I have
nothing but kindness for her memory."
Mrs. Griswold was very much affected
by the news that had reached her but a
short time before. She will leave for San
Francisco to-morrow morning.
MATCHMAKER CALLAHAN
IN SEARCH OF TALENT
OFFERS TO MATCH McCONNELL
AGAINST OLD OPPONENTS.
R. E. Callahan, the popular match
maker for the Sacramento Athletic Club,
arrived In this city last evening in search
of talent. The particular object of his visit
Is to try and arrange a match for Frank
McConnell, the hard hitting local welter
weight who gave Green his hard battle
some weeks ago. Mr. Callahan declared
his willingness to match McConnell
against any man of his weight In the
world. McConnell has accepted the Sac
ramento Athletic Club's offer to meet any
of his old opponents, and as tempting in
ducements are offered, it is more than
likely that before long Green, or some
other clever man, will be pitted against
McConnell.
The residents of Sacramento are desir
ous of seeing- Stelzner and Kennedy in
the ring and Mr. Callahan Is empowered
by his club to offer the heavy-weights
a $1000 purse and sixty per cent of the
gross receipts to fight.
In the last meeting Kennedy gained a
decision over Stelzner after twenty
rounds' hard fighting, but the latter was
not satisfied. He has been heard to say
that he could whip Kennedy and wanted
another try. Stelzner has fought before
the Sacramento club on numerous occa
sions, and when he learns of this tempt
ing offer he will doubtless accept.
Mr. Callahan called attention to a re
miirk made by Sammy Maxwell, who so
handily whipped Jimmy Lawler, that he
would bet his own money that he could
put out Bob Thompson, the colored idol
of Los Angeles. Mr. Callahan says he
stands willing to put Thompson in the
ring against Maxwell at 133 pounds for
either a bet or a purse.
"The Sacramento Athletic Club." said
the matchmaker, "is booming and Is
anxious to pull off. some good matches.
During the past year a number of inter
esting events between prominent expo
nents of the manly art were exhibited to
large gatherings and with satisfaction to
the participants."
THE IOWA REGIMENT

Saw In Cuba.
COLONEL CABELL TESTIFIES
INVESTIGATION COMMISSION
IMPRESSED WITH HIS STOBY.
Surgeon Boss Found Medical Supplies
Bather Short Until He
Learned How to
Get iuem.
ANNISTON, Ala., Oct. 25.â Dr. R. D.
Boss, assistant surgeon of the First In
fantry, was the first witness before the
War Investigation Commission to-day.
He was with the Fourth Infantry in
Cuba. He arrived in Cuba on the 10th
of July. He found the medical supplies
short, and was unable to secure any
of them for a few days, until he learned
how to get them from the division hos
pital.
There was a sufficient quantity of
quinine, but a shortage of morphine,
however, he had all of this latter rem
edy that was absolutely necessary. He
was able to secure hospital stores such
as food delicacies by 'rustling" for
them, getting them first from the Red
Cross Society and then going to Santi
ago for them.
Other witnesses at the forenoon ses
sion were Fountain Ragland and Ed
ward Simmons, colored, of the Third
Alabama; D. C. Lemke, quartermaster
sergeant of the Fourth Wisconsin; Con
gressman C-lson, colonel of the Fourth
Kentucky, and Lieutenant Colonel Ca
bell of the Second Arkansas.
Colonel Cabell said In reply to the
questions put by Dr. Connor, that he
had observed a condition of affairs at
the hospital of the Second Division of
the Third Army Corps in June which
he considered horrible. He had him
self seen one sick man lying without
the protection of even a tent, and he
had been informed by other officers
that several others had been left in the
same way. He thought the doctors
were honest enough, but that they did
not know how to get supplies. Mule
drivers had been used for nurses, and
he had been reliably informed that
many of them were in the habit of get
ting drunk and onsuchoccasions nee
lecting their patients. He said Dr.
Schooler was the division surgeon at
the time.
Colonel Cabell is a lieutenant in the
regular army and his testimony made
an evident impression upon the com
mission.

Passenger Train Runs at Lightning
Speed Vith the Engineer D;stl
at His Post.
. SUSQUEHANNA, Pa., Oct. 25.â When
the night express train, eastbound, ar
rived at this station at midnight last
night, the engineer, Henry Kingsley of
Susquehanna, was found dead in the cab
with his head badly crushed. After the
train left Binghamton, twenty-three miles
west of here, trainmen and others noticed
that the engineer failed to give the usual
signal at crossings and small stations, and
also that the train was running at un
usual speed. Fireman Cowen noted that
the whistle was not blown for this station,
and going forward in the cab, found the
dead, engineer. The train had run at a ter
rific speed twenty miles without any one
in charge. There were over 200 passen
gers on board.
It is supposed the engineer was hit by
a water crane at a point just east of
Binghamton. Kingsley was one of the

CAPTAIN NEVILLS
CAUSED A SCENE
Charges Against Lawyer
Church.
SENSATION IN A COURTROOM
ACCUSES THE ATTORNEY OF
COMPLICITY.
Threatened With Punishment for
Contempt by Judge Risley if
He Repeats His
Offense.
BpÂ«cial Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Oct. 25.â A sensational
scene occurred in Superior Judge Ris
ley's courtroom this afternoon during
the trial of Dr. Winslow Anderson of
San Francisco against Mrs. Elsie Wil
liams, Captain Nevills' nemesis. The
claim was for $2000 for medical attend
ance. The services were not denied,
but Mrs. Williams claims that Captain
Nevills had sent her to Dr. Anderson
and was to have paid the bill.
Captain Nevills was called to the
stand on behalf of the plaintiff in re
buttal of Mrs. Williams' testimony.
He denied that he had guaranteed the
doctor's fee. During his cross-exam
ination by Attorney George E. Church
of this city Captain Nevills created a
scene in court by declaring that he
would send Mr. Church to the peniten
tiary along with Azhderain, Mrs. Loose
and Mrs. Williams.
An exciting dialogue ensued between
the witness and attorney, In the course
of which Mr. Nevills declared several
times that Church was just as deep in
the scheme to blackmail him as the
others, and that he would put him in
State prison before he got through
with him. Captain Nevills in his an
ger lost control of himself entirely. He
declared Mrs. Williams had told him of
the whole plot, and that the attorney
was implicated in it.
"This is interesting," remarked Mr.
Church.
"It will be more interesting when I
get through with you." replied Nevills.
Judge Risley threatened to send the
aged capitalist to jail if he re
peated his threat. Judge Church
stands high in the profession here, be
ing president of the Bar Association.
The jury returned a verdict in favor of
Mrs. Williams.

BUTTE COUNTY
PLEDGES ITS
VOTE TO GAGE
A Record - Breaking
Meeting at Oroville.
THOUSANDS FORM IN PARADE
FIREWORKS, MUSIC AND CHEERS
PRECEDE THE MEETING.
Senator George C. Perkins Urges His
Former Associates to Sup
port the Republican
Ticket.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OROVILLE, Oct. 25.â Butte County is
nobly swinging into line for Gage and
Neff. To-night there was witnessed in
Oroville a great uprising of people to
applaud the gallant campaign of Henry
T. Gage against the single tax. The
magnitude of the demonstration called
to mind the out, ouring at San Diego,
Bakersfield, Fresno, Stockton, Sacra
mento and Auburn.
The Republican standard-bearer
arose at 4 o'clock this morning to board
the train from Red Bluff to Marysville.
It was still early when the train
reached Marysville, but Mr. Gage's
presence was soon made known to Mr.
Dinsmore, the chairman of the Yuba
County Central Republican Committee.
Between the hours of 9 and 12 o'clock
many citizens of Sutter and Yuba coun
ties called at the Western Hotel to pay
their respects to the popular candidate.
Judge Davis presented many of his fel
low citizens to the next Governor. Re
gret was expressed that arrangements
had not been made for Mr. Gage to
address the people of Yuba and Sutter
counties.
United States Senator Perkins ar
rived at Marysville at 12:30 p. m., and
joined Mr. Gage in the journey to Oro
ville.
At Gridley a throng of people assem
bled at the dfp>>t tn welcome the able
exponents of the Republican cause. At
other stations along the line enthusias
tic citizens cheered the nominee and
the Senator. A cordial reception was
extended to Mr. Gage and Senator Per
kins at Oroville. They were met at the
depot and escorted to the Union Hotel
by Judge John C. Gray, John P.
Leonard, D. H. Hilton, chairman, and
T. M. James, secretary, of the Repub
lican County Committee, E. W. Fogg,
chairman, and Ed Howard, secretary,
of the Oroville Republican Club, and
other citizens.
While there was great enthusiasm
for Gage the people of Butte also gave
to Senator Perkins an old-fashioned
welcome. The Senator lived in this
county for twenty years and knew
every man, woman and child in the re
gion. All the afternoon he was sur
rounded by old timers, who were happy
to recall the experiences of early days.
The farmers, miners and stockmen of
Butte recognized in Henry T. Gage an
every-day man of the people. They
came forward of their own motion to
grasp his hand and assure him that he
would be the next Governor of Cali
fornia. Monopoly in office holding is
resisted by the honest people of Butte
County. They prefer a man who has
not held office to one who has been
hunting and holding office for twenty
years.
Delegations began to arrive in Oro
ville early in the evening from the
ranches, orchards and mines of this re
nowned region. Republicans from
Gridley, 100 strong, headed by their
band, joined in the demonstration.
Bonfires, bombs, rockets, red fire, mu
sic, a large procession and a tumuult of
cheering for Gage and Neff delighted
a multitude of spectators. The route
of the procession was along Meyers,
Bird, Montgomery, Lincoln and Hun
toon streets. The Gridley band headed
the marching column. The Oroville
band was at the head of the second di
vision. Henry T. Gage and George C.
Perkins joined the column.
Before 8 o'clock 3000 people were as
sembled near the Union Opera-house,
but not more than 1000 could gain ad
mission to the hall. A desire was ex
pressed for an open air meeting, in or
der to allow all those assembled to see
and hear the next Governor and Sena
tor Perkins. It was deemed advisable,
however, to hold the meeting indoors
and crowd as many people in the house
as the space would admit.
The assemblage was called to order
by Judge Gray, who named the follow
ing vice presidents: Oroville â E. Tuck
er, J. J. Smith, X W. Fogg, G. M.
Sparks, N. Goldstein, C. H. Schively,

The mention of the standard-bearer's
name in the introductory remarks of
Judge Gray called forth prolonged ap
plause. When the cheering subsided
Air. Gage expressed his gratitude and
pleasure at the magnificent reception
and predicted that November 8 would i
bring the grandest triumph for Repub
lican principles ever recorded in Cali
fornia. This prediction evoked a mighty
round of cheers.
Mr. Gage proceeded at once to reply
to Judge Maguire's advocacy of the sin
gle tax doctrine, and so portrayed the
dangers lurking in the scheme that the i
audience listened with marked attention â¢
to every utterance of the speaker on i
this all-absorbing issue. Maguire's I
weak record on the railroad question I
was held up to the people, while the un- !
American attitude of the office-holding j
giant received deserved attention. In i
regard to the administration of State I
affairs Mr. Gage promised to gruard the !
interests of the people and render jus- :
tice to every citizen of California. His I
earnest and eloquent address won the j
admiration and applause of the vast <
assemblage.
Senator George C. Perkins received a
cordial greeting. He spoke with feel
ing as he referred to the associations
of bygone years. He spoke of the many
changes In the industrial features of
the county, mentioning the vast treas
>
ure of precious metal which the mines
had yielded and of the greater wealth
derived from the orchards and vines.
Proceeding to a discussion of politi
cal tonics the Senator spoke at length
on national affairs. He reviewed the
work of President McKinley's adminis
tration, Indicating where the industrial
conditions of the country had been bet
tered by the protective policy of the na
tion. The address throughout followed
the line ot, his masterly speech at
Woodland. ! His reference to the
achievements of the Oregon, the gal
lantry of American soldiers and sail
ors, the patriotism of the American
people evoked hearf- rounds of ar>
Â»-lause. The success of the meeting to
night of Butte County voters, the vast
turnout and the remarkable enthu
siasm displayed, inspire the Republi
cans with renewed confidence. This
county was carried for Bryan, but the
Republicans ar" confident of their abil
ity to win out for Gage and Neff on No
vember 8. To-night's demonstration
was a record breaker for the numbers
assembled. ,
To-morrow morning at 4 o'clock Mr.
Gage will leave for Vallejo and to
morrow night will address the voters
of Solano County. He Js somewhat
fiitigued by rising at 3 or 4 o'clock in
the morning and speaking late at night.
But his voice is not Imnaired.
ROUSING GILROY MEETING.
Good Government Leaguers of Santa
Clara Are Heard.
GILROY. Cal., Oct. 25â The Good Gov
ernment League of Santa Clara County
held a rousing meeting to-night at Music
Hall. Previous to the meeting bonfires
blazed <>n the main streets, anvils wera
fired, and the Gilroy band furnished lively
music. At the hall Dr. Bonne, a promin
ent Democrat, presided. State politics
were dispensed with and county politics
handled without gloves by Judge J. R.
Lewis. KM Wright. D. H. Bryant and oth
ers from San Jose. Several of the league's
candidates were present and made short
speeches. The colored quartet from San
Jose contributed vocal music.
JAMES G. MAGUIRE AS
A POLITICAL OSTRICH
COLONEL EDDY DESCRIBES HIM
IN A SPEECH.
Enthusiastic Republican Rally Held
at B'nai B'rith Hall Last
Evening.
There was a ' large and enthusiastic
gathering of citizens last evening at
B'nai B'rith Hall on Eddy street, between
Mason and Taylor, to listen to campaign
speeches by Colonel T. V. Eddy, ex-Su
preme Judge Van R. Paterson and other
Republican leaders. The hall was taste
fully decorated in the national colors. The
Sam Booth quartet and a brass band fur
nished music.
Colonel Eddy devoted an hour and a
half to the record of James G. Maguire,
and before he had finished there was very
little left of the triplicate candidate for
Governor on the Democratic ticket. The
colonel dwelt on Maguire's hypocrisy in
accepting nominations from the Demo
crats, the Silver Republicans and the
Populists on diametrically opposite plat
forms and principles. He quoted Ma
guire's record in Congress when the latter
opposed the bill prohibiting the influx of
European anarchists and nihilists to our
shores. Maguire then stated that the
nihilists were the Democrats of Russia.
"Why should we exclude them?" he
asked.
Colonel Eddy was of the opinion that
Mr. Maguire somewhat resembled the
ostrich in gastronomic powers, inasmuch
as he had successfully taken into his
stomach the husks of Silver Republican
ism, the old bones of Populism and the
cobblestones of Democracy.
Judge Paterson's speech was specially
directed toward exposing the sham re
former, Hefting Jimmy Phelan. "He's a
rank demagogue!" exclaimed the Judge,
"and the only reason I have taken the
gtump in this campaign is that I desire
to rebuke him for his arrogant attacks
upon the Supreme Court of the State, of
which I have had the honor of being a
member. Phelan is a pretense. He Is
sham and a delusion." The Judge then
proceeded to give cogent reasons for his
statements and proved his case against
the hefting Mayor.
Charles L. Patton made a brief address,
stating that he would make it his busi
ness to give the city a clean administra
tion. He guaranteed that the money in
the city treasury would be counted here
after instead of "hefted" in the Demo
cratic style.
REMOVED HIS STOMACH.
Physicians Pronounce the Operation
Successful, but the Patient Dies.
Another attempt at the sensational ope
ration of removing a stomach was
made yesterday morning at the City and
County Hospital. According to the phy
sicians and the assembled students the
operation was most successful, despite the
fact that the patient succumbed."
John Hoffmann is the name of the un
fortunate. For some months he was the
victim of a cancerous growth, malig
nant in nature. All other treatment
proving futile It was decided that the
rempval of the stomach was necessary
and preparations were made yesterday
for an immediate operation.
In the absence of Dr. R. A. McLean,
Dr. lirigham, assisted by Dr. THlman,
Dr. Roach and Dr. Boyd. performed the
operation. Some other physicians were
present, among whom were Dr. Hopkins,
Dr. Sussdorf and Dr. Moffitt. The patient
was much weakened in health by the rav
ages of the dread disease, and a perni
cious anaemia which had so enervated
his system that little reserve strength
was left to survive the operation.
The initial incision was made by Dr.
Brigham, Dr. Tillman handling the hae
mostatic forceps. Proceeding rapidly the
mesentery, the fold enveloping the stom
ach, was detached from the greater curv
ature, the lower part of the stomach. A
small adhesion to the liver was found,
but this did not deter the operation.
The mesentery removed, the esophagus
was severed near the cardiac opening of
the stomach. The incision was made be
tween two ligatures bound near the car
diac opening. The ascending, colon was
then cut and the stomach removed. A
Murphy button was inserted and the as
cending colon bound to the esophagus.
Up to this point the operation was suc
cessful. The patient then showed signs
of syncope, which necessitated the ad
ministration of strychnine and n.troplne.
Life was sustained until the -close, but
as attendants were removing the patient
to the ward he succumbed.
MONTEREY CHINATOWN FIRE.
MONTEREY, Oct.. 25.â A fire started in
Chinatown about 6 o'clock last evening.
It originated in one of the huts at the
northern end of the town owned by
"Chinese Mary." and was caused by the
overturning of a lamp or oil stove. In a
few moments the whole section was on
fire.
The Monterey fire company was
promptly on hand, but was unable to ren
der much assistance, there being no hy
ilrant to which hose could be attached.
The flames were finally subdued by means
of small hose and lines of bucket passers,
and by 9 o'clock the fire was nearly out.
About a fourth of the village was burn
i'd. the losb of nets, tackle and other
fishing paraphernalia being considerable.
The damage is estimated at between $500
and $800.
THREE BARNS BURNED.
STOCKTON, Oct. 25.â News reached
here to-day to the effect that three barns
belonging to Mrs. Nate Hoerl, whose
ranch is situated on the Stanislaus River,
twenty-five miles from Stockton, were set
on fire and entirely consumed, with their
contents, early Sunday morning. Thirty
tons of hay, a large quantity of straw, a
buggy, two carriages, a spring wagon and
twenty pets of harness were consumed.
The barns were so situated that the fire
could not have caught from one of them,
being so far apart, without human aid.
Lena Hoerl, a 12-year-old daughter, got
two horses out of one of the burning
buildings only a few seconds before the
roof feu in.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, WEDKESDAY^OCTOEEB 26, IS9B.
SANTA CLARA
GREETS LOUD
AND DAVIS
Great Demonstration
at San Jose.
REPUBLICANS IN CONTROL
THE CONGRESSMAN PAYS HIS
RESPECTS TO MAGUIRE.
Mr. Davis Urges the People to Re
turn His Companion to Wash
ington to Aid the Ad
ministration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 25.â A large audience
greeted Congressman Loud and Web
ster Davis, Assistant Secretary of the
Interior, at the Auditorium this even
ing. The place was filled and the audi
ence was one of the most intellectual
ever seen at a political gathering. A
large number of ladies were present.
Great enthusiasm prevailed and the
words of the speakers received rapt at
tention.
The Army and Navy League, 200
strong, under command of D. J. McGin
ley, and headed by the Fifth Regiment
Band, escorted Congressman Loud and
Mr. Davis from the St. James Hotel to
the Auditorium. The guests, with the
reception committee, occupied a car
riage drawn fey four black horses.
The following gentlemen composed
the committee: G. M. Bowman, J. R.
Patton, C. H. Phillips, H. J. Edwards,
O. A. Hale, Archie McDonald, A. E.
Eaton, D. J. Porter, Dan McGinley, S.
F. Leib, D. F. McGraw, D. L. Haas, L.
Callisch, T. S. Montgomery, Senator H.
V. Morehouse and W. A. Bowden.
The line of march was thronged with
people, who cheered Congressman Loud
and party.
D. F. McGraw, chairman of the Re
publican League, called the meeting to
order. The list of vice presidents in
cluded prominent men from all over the
county. S. F. Leib was then intro
duced as chairman of the meeting. He
urged the people to elect a Republican
Congress to uphold the policy of the
administration. As long as we have
industries to protect we don't want to
fail to elect that kind of Congressmen.
Congressman Loud was then Intro
duced, and his popularity was at once
apparent by the close attention and ap
plause he received. He said it was
gratifying to Californians that San
Joseans turned out in such force to do
honor to the Republican party and
one of the trusted lieutenants of Pres
ident McKinley, and it spoke louder
than words that Santa Clara County,
the garden spot of the world, approved
of his course. A glance at the faces
present showed a fair sample of the
70,000 men and women who live in
Santa Clara County.
The speaker said he was here to talk
a while regarding some of the issues
confronting the people; to discuss the
men who lead and enunciate the prin
ciples of the opposing party. The
course of McKinley and the policy of
the administration was praised. The
Democrats had charged the Republican
party with not keeping its pledges, but
this was not so. The Republican party
had made but one pledge, and that was
to endeavor to bring peace, happiness
and better times to the country. He
did not believe any man could say this
pledge had not been kept. They could
not deny the administration was wise
and the condition of the country better
than it was in 1893. No industrial armies
were marching through the country and
every man felt assured of protection to
life and happiness.
Maguire was then discussed. The
speaker said the standard bearer of the
combination party had discussed him
(Loud), and he proposed to pay his re
sp^rts to the fusion candidate. Ma
guire had addressed the people here a
short time am. and he had a right to
show the that they had been de
ceived by the pinto standard bearer.
He said Maguire had performed his
duties as well as the average Congress
man, but the people of California had
been led to believe he was the only man
who ever represented California in that
body.
Maguire had received more advertis
ing than any man who ever went from
this State. The Democratic candidate
for Governor had tried to drag the
funding bill into the campaign. This
measure had been settled by the high
est authority in the land, and no party
could hope to bring the question into
political affairs. He then told about
the passage of the bill in Congress.
The matter came up just when the
country was on the verge of war, and
only after due deliberation of Congress
was this settlement of the debt of the
Union and Central Pacific railroads
agreed upon. The action taken was
deemed best to secure the $80,000,000
owed by the railroads. Senator White,
the peer of any Democrat intellectu
ally, was more directly responsible for
the adoption of the funding bill.
Maguire has come back from Con
gress the personification of honesty. He
is impressed with the idea that no other
man has the interest of California at
heart. He tells you that at two sessions
of Congress he defeated the funding
bill. At those times he only spoke five
minutes, and it is surprising that the
eloquence of his voice should so easily
defeat the bill. In this last Congress
he had control of the time to speak â
you know how long he can talk when
he g-ets startedâ and yet the bill paÃsed.
Maguire has secured the passage of
the Maguire act and had helped in other
measures. He was willing to give him
credit for it and everything else, except
being Congress itself. If you elect Ma
guire Governor you will go back to the
conditions of 1896, of which he Is the
greatest living exponent to-day; elect
him Governor and you will experience
the times you had from 1892 to 1896.
Maguire also said that if Craig was
elected to Congress he would get a sur
vey of Alvlso Slough.
This was not so. The question of the
preliminary survey of Alviso Slough
had been determined upon three times
and each time was reported adversely
by the engineers. The speaker had
done all he could for the project. Over
$5000 had already been expended on the
harbor. Next winter the question
would be taken out of Santa Clara
County politics, and no man could ex
pect to gain political preferment by
raising it.
The combination party presents to
Callfornians one peculiar feature â com
mendation of the acts of McKinley.
The fusionists know the temper of the
people too well. They say McKinley is
the best President the country ever had
and then ask you to elect men to Con
gress who will upset his plans and poli
cies. The Democrats say the Republi
cans claim the glory of the war. This
is not so. They only favored war
when nothing else would do. The
eagerness of the Democrats to plunge
the country into war was touched upon,
and the speaker said when war came
they Quibbled over and delayed pro
viding means for carrying it on.
Congressman Loud said Maguire had
said the tax on express packages, tele
grams, sleeping car berths and checks
on banks was an iniquity on poor peo
ple, but the speaker pointed out that
poor people did not make it a practice
to indulge in such things. He said the
Democrats claim Dewey and Schley are
members of their party. He had known
both personally for years and simply
knew them as American citizens who
had dedicated their lives to their coun
try, and belonged to the party that sus
tained it. The war had reunited the
country and people from the North and
South, sons of the old reb and the old
Yank, had marched side by side to de
fend the flag.
He closed by urging the people to
support McKinley. The contest of 1900
would be fought in IS9B. The success
of the Democrats meant Bryanism in
1900. "Support McKinley, believe in
his courage and wisdom, uphold and
sustain him is the proper thing to do.
Don't tie his hands by giving the con
trol of Congress into the hands of the
opposition."
Several selections were rendered by
the Colored Southern Quartet, after
which Chairman Leib introduced Web
ster Davis, who said in part:
"When I listened to the young colored
gentlemen singing so lovely my
thoughts for a moment turned to dear
old Missouri. We have about 50,000
colored voters there, and every one of
them is a Republican too. The Demo
crats and Populists claim all the glory
of the war, and every prominent man
who took part in the war with Spain.
There is one exception, thank God, and
that is the brave black boys who fought
like wild cats and saved the day at
Santiago. No, they wont claim black
boys. No truer American or patriotic
blood flows through veins than that of
the black boys who fought at Santi
ago." â¢
Mr. Davis paid the State a great trib
ute. He said the fruitful orchards and
vineyards and splendid farms were
the homes of intellectual men and wo
men, who had come from all parts of
the country. Caliornia was a grand
State, and with our new possessions
California would soon be regarded as
the center of the United States and be
come the distributing point for the
Western isles. The Republican party
favored thia sort of progression, and it
would be many dollars in the pockets
of Callfornians to vote for the Repub
lican party. To accomplish this he
urged the citizens of Santa Clara
County to do all in their power to re
elect Congressman Loud, as he would
iook after their interests and the coun
try'!; interests. He said:
"The way for you to do is to send
men who are In harmony with the
President to Congress, men who will
support his measures who will assist
him in the solution of those great prob
lems which are coming" up for solution;
men who will stand with him In open
ing up that great Western country.
Then the result will be that wonderful
and magnificent prosperity, to which
we are looking forward to spring up
in this Western country, and the peo
ple of California will be the first peo
ple to enjoy the profits and benefits.
(Applause.)
"The way for you to do, then, I say,
is to send men who will support and
not oppose him. The majority of Dem
ocrats and Populists in the last Con
gress, and the free silver element of
both of these parties, opposed the Pres
ident in almost everything he desired.
They opposed almost every single, soli
tary war measure save the first one,
that of voting $50,000,000 to the Presi
dent to carry on the war. All the other
great questions proposed by him they
opposed; they pulled back and ob
structed; they became filibusters.
"The result Will be, if you return that
class of men to Congress so that there
will be a majority of that class there,
to bring to a standstill the progressive
policy of the present administration for
the next two years and the President
will not be able to accomplish the great
results that have marked his adminis
tration for the past two years. Then
the thing for you to do as patriots of
your country is to return men who
stand for the grandeur and glory of
California as well as of this republic
"It is your duty to send to Congress
the kind of men who have represented
you in this district in the past; a man
who will uphold the President, a man
with a clear head and honest heart, a
man who is able, more than any of his
colleagues on the floor of Congress;
a strong, manly man, an American one
who can sustain the interests of the
country, an honor to its flag; one who
is able to help settle the great ques
tions that will confront us in the fu
ture In the deveJopment of the islands
of the Pacific seas. Such a man is the
splendid man who addressed you to
night, and you should stand by him on
the Bth of next month and return him
to Congress." (Applause.)
"The principles and policies of the Re
publican party are in favor of prosper-
ity and you should give your support
to the Republican party to insure it.
A new era is dawning. The foremost
man of the twentieth century is Wil
liam McKinley."
After the meeting Congressman Loud
and Mr. Davis were entertained and
feasted at the Saint Claire Club.
MEETING AT GRAHAM'S HALL.
One of the best meeings of the campaign
was held at Graham's Hall, on Alabama
street and Preclta avenue, last night.
John T. Graham, the leader of the Re
publican forces of the district, spared no
cost or pains In gathering every voter in
the section to his hall to hear woids of
wisdom from the leaders of the Republi
can party. The meeting- was called to or
der by Mr. Graham, who in a few appro
priate words welcomed the speakers and
the voters to the meeting. He introduced
H. S. Millzner, who saia he appeared for
the County Committee in the interest of
the Republican party of the city and
county of San Francisco. He spoke of the
principles of the party and the excellence
of the nominees put forth by that party,
all of whom would be elected beyond a
Bhadow of a doubt.
H. N. Clement, one of the nominees for
Superior Judge, was the next speaker.
He refrained from discussing the issues of
the campaign, but assured his hearers
that when elected all should have the
laws admitted fairly and equally.
Attorney General \V. F. Fitzgerald,
nominee for City and County Attorney, on
being introduced received an ovation sel
dom accorded to any candidate running
for a local office. He gave a short outline
of the platform upon which the candi
dates stood before the people, dwelling
upon that portion which assured the peo
ple the right to acquire all public utilities.
Judge D. J. Murphy, nominee for Dis
trict Attorney, was given a hearty recep
tion. The Judge, being well known in that
portion of the Mission, he was quite at
home with the boys.
H. S. Martin made a few remarks and
apologized for having to depart so soon
from such a "warm" meeting for the pur
pose of attending other meetings. He re
ceived a parting cheer as he left the hall.
What was accorded to the other canai
dates in the way of a warm reception was
but child's play to what Charles L. Pat
ton received when he made his appear
ance at 10 o'clock. He delivered a vote
catching address and fairly captured the
entire crowd. There were several men in
the body of the meeting who knew Patton
since he was a Mission boy attending tne
Mission Grammar School, and these men
were loudest in their applause, because
the big, genial man was a genial boy of
happy disposition who worked himself up
to what he is without the aid of a father's
wealth.
The following Republican candidates
were present, and each made a few ap
propriate remarks:
John Laekmann, E. L. Head, Dr. Haw
kins, A. Attridge, Thomas F. Graham. W.
A. Deane, Asa R. Wells, Edward I. Shee
han. I. J. Truman, Charles S. Tilden, R.
H. Webster, John A. Drinkhouse and A.
B. Treadwell. *

ney of the bar of Yuba County, died at
the farm of his brother In Sutter Coun
ty to-day. He was a native of Canada,

COLUSA, Oct. 25. â Colusa gave
James G. Maguire a hearty welcome to
day. Judge Maguire and E. L. Hutchi
son drove over from Willows this after
noon and were met by a large crowd of
citizens. At the meeting later the Col
lege City Band furnished the music,
while Judge H. M. Albery presided.
The Democratic county candidates
were seated on the platform. The ap
pearance of Judge Maguire called forth
loud applause from the overflow crowd
outside and those in the hall as he
entered, accompanied by Mr. Hutchi
son, Mr. Arnold, chairman of the
County Central Committee, and other
members of the committee.
Judge Maguire was introduced by
Judge Albery with a few appropriate
remarks. His speech was along the
lines of the campaign issues embodying
his ideas regarding the single tax and
the money question.
Judge Maguire was followed by Mr.
Hutchison, who held the interest of
the audience astonishingly well under
the circumstances. He gave his views
on governmental principles, on corpor
ations, the railroads and other moneyed
institutions and their bearings upon
government and upon legislation. He
suggested remedies for the ills of the
country and urged the people to do
their duty at the polls to correct these
abuses to free humanity from the
moneyed power.
WILLOWS, Oct. 25.â Every Democrat
in this county, apparently, was in Wil
lows to-day to attend the Maguire
meeting which took place this after
noon. Maguire and Hutchison were
welccrtned with brass bands, anvil sa
lutes and cheers. Mr. Maguire talked
for an hour and a half, the major por
tion of his talk dealing with corpora
tions, principally the Southern Pacific.
An immense crowd listened to Maeruire.
and there was plenty of enthusiasm.
To-night the Republicans are holding
a rally, and many of the country peo
ple who are here to see Maguire are lis
tening to the other side as propounded
by E. L. Salomon. Mr. Salomon I- tak
ing up Maguire's speech noint for point,
and pulling the props from under the
arguments as presented by the Demo
cratic leader. The campaign is at fever
heat here.
SENATOR WHITE
AT WATSONVILLE
WATSONVILLE, Oct. 25. â Senator
White delivered a forty-minute open
air speech to about five hundred people
to-night. Notwithstanding it was one
of his best efforts he had an unusually
cold audience, winning his first ap
plause about midway of his address,
when he eloquently referred to the
Stars and Stripes.
Much of the speaker's time was de
voted to an explanation of the acts of
himself and his Democratic colleagues
in Congress with reference to the war
measures. He assured his hearers that
the Republican majority deserved con
demnation when it refused to follow
the dictates of the Democratic minor-
ity.
If it had done right everything would
have been well. His auditors were in
formed that they were pot voting for
party, that the so-called national issue
did not cut any figure and that this
was a State affair. He talked much
about the war, denounced the idea that
the Republican party was entitled to
any special credit for its conduct and
earnestly endeavored to convince the
drinkers of beer and users of tobacco
that they were defraying the expense of
the recent conflict and being ground to
the earth by taxation. He also ex
pressed the fear that the Peace Com
mission in Paris would do something
by which some one would be enabled
to make money.
The Republican party was denounced
because there is no representative mer
chant marine, and R. J. Waters, Re
publican candidate for Congress, was
referred to as a man who is making
speeches unfit to discuss or post on the
fences. He had little to say for BarloAv,
except that he was experienced and
ought not to be removed. The Populist
element waÂ« "jollied" handsomely, and
Shanahan and his followers were per
mitted to escape with a mild rebuke.
Mr. White then took up Maguire's
candidacy and asked: "Do you knov
Maguire?"
Despite the fact that Maeuire was
born and raised here the query
brought forth no applause. In a some
what labored effort the speaker en
deavored to satisfactorily explain Ma
guire's single tax doctrine, and told
his hearers of the difficulties the Dem
ocratic candidate would meet in en
deavoring to put his theory into prac
tice. Maguire's honesty of purpose was
dwelt upon, and voters were urged to
support that gentleman particularly be
cause of his experience in office and of
the fact that he had "a judicial mind."
Those who expected Mr. White to de
cry Henry T. Gage were grievously dis
appointed. He referred to him as a
warm friend for twenty years, and the
only reason the speaker gave why the
people should not support the Repub
lican standard bearer was that he had
"not had experience." It was a manly
speech and deserved a better reception
than was accorded it by tho Demo
crats present, considering the fact that
this is Mr. White's birthplace.
Enthusiastic Railroad Men.
The members of the Railroad Men's
Club of the Thirty-fifth District had a
rousing meeting last evening at their hall
at Twenty-ninth and Mission streets, and
were addressed upon the political situa
tion by nearly all of the Republican
municipal nominees.
The club has taken an active Interest
and part in the campaign since the be
ginning, and the 300 members who were
present at the meeting last evening were
enthusiastic over the outlook for party
success when it was pointed out to them.
Among the speakers who addressed the
meeting were Charles L. Patton, D. J.
Murphy. Henry S. Jdartln, William A.
Deane, Martin Fragley, I. J. Truman,
Dr. W. J. Hawkins, the candidates for
the judiciary and Ed Aigletlnger. They
were also addressed at length by W. H.
Cobb. who is running for the Assembly
for that district.
The club will hold another of its meet
ings neÂ£t week, and it is hoped that it
will have an opportunity to hear a num
ber of the State candidates who will be
in town at that time.

MAGUIRE'S LABOR
MEETING ENDS
IN A FIASCO
A Beggarly Array of
Empty Benches.
MAYOR PHELAN NOT PRESENT
GOVERNOR BUDD'S PLEA FOR
HARMONY.
Three Representatives of Labor Urge
the Election of James G.
Maguire, for Gov
ernor. /
A meeting which was announced as a
spontaneous tribute to Judge Maguire by
the worklngmen of this city was held in
Metropolitan Hall last night. It was also
announced as a preliminary meeting prior
to a big mass meeting of workingmen to
be held in the interests of Judge Maguire.
When the meeting was called to order
by W. P. Lawler the hall was well filled.
About 9 o'clock there was a movement
toward the doors and the chairman,
George Bromfield, begged them to remain
seated, as Mayor Phelan would soon make
his appearance and charm them with his
eloquence. They, however, gradually
kept leaving and before the close of the
meeting there was a beggarly array of
empty benches, not more than sixty or
seventy people being left in the hall. And
Mayor Phelan never came.
Governor Budd was the first speaker.
He thought it was eminently proper that
if corporations combined as clubs to de
feat Judge Maguire their employes should
come out in mass meetings for Maguire
and show him that he had at least as
many men supporting him as those
brought out against him by the corpora
tions of the State. The contemplated
mass meeting would be a protest that la
bor cannot be moved to vote one way at
any one's bidding. He declared that 40,
000 out of the 60,000 Populists in the State
would vote for Maguire and his election
was therefore sure. The Governor plead
ed for harmony among the Democrats to
win the victory and he pledged himself
that he would see that two years hence a
primary law would be in force for this
city.
P. H. McCarthy, who is at present
house carpenter in the California Hotel,
said that if the worklngmen wanted laws j
that would be fair and equal to all they
must have Maguire for Governor. As an \
instance of what Judge Maguire had done j
he Bald that when San Francisco had got i
more than its usual share of the "live- |
stock" at the outbreak of the late war j
(meaning soldiers), the contracts for mak
ing their uniforms was given to Chinese,
and the matter was submitted to Wash- ;
ington and Judge Maguire fought It out I
in the halls of Congress. "JinV' Phelan.
be said, was attacked by the press for not j
being a friend of labor, but he knew per- i
sonally that the charge was unfounded
and "Jim" had done everything to raise i
the downtrodden peopie.
John H. Marble of the Printers' Union
spoke of the initlati%'e and referendum
and urged the laboring men to vote for
Maguire and Barry, who believed in them.
He said it had gone forth from Fourth
and Townsend that four candidates must
be defeated at all costs and they were
Maguire, Barry, Hinton and Dunn, but I
the workingmen would see that these men
were not defeated.
Herman Gutstadt, ex-president of the
Federated Trades, said Maguire held a
more prominent position than any other
man in the United States as a friend of â 
the laboring classes, and hundreds of
thousands in the East were watching the
result of his contest for the gubernatorial
chair.
By this time the hall was almost empty
and as there was no sign of the coming
of Mayor Phelan, Everett I. Woodman,
candidate for State Printer, was put for
ward to fUI the breach. He talked for a
few minutes on the benefits of organiza
tion, but as it was dull work he cut hia
remarks short.
James Donovan was called upon for a
sor.g. He sang and sang again, but Phe
lan did not come. W. M. Hinton consent
ed to talk for a few minutes, but he soon
gave out and after a hurried consultation
among those on the platform, it was de
cided to wait no longer for the Mayor and.
the few remaining people rose from their
seats and walked out.
Independent Democrats.
An enthusiastic meeting of the Inde
pendent Democrats of the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District was held at Fox'a Hall,
Fifteenth and Guerrero streets last even-
Ing. Speeches were made by several
members and resolutions were passed de
claring in favor of open primaries and de
nouncing the methods adopted by the
present and self-styled bosses of the Dem
ocratic party as being against all prin
ciples of Democracy. The following 1 reso
lution was adopted by a rising- vote:
Whereas, The principles of the Demo
cratic party have always been in favor of
rewarding faithful and honest public ser
vants; and that that past records may
be a guarantee for their future, thereforÂ©
be It
Resolved, That we. the Independent
Democrats of the Thirty-fourth Assembly
District, recognize the honesty and ability
of the following candidates as our repre
sentatives: A. C. Freese for Public Ad
ministrator, William A. Deane for Coun
ty Clerk, and that sterling Native Son,
H. S. Martin, for Sheriff.

The Bear Club will hold a ratification
meeting on Friday evening In B'nai B'rith
Hall, and the committee are making great
preparations for the event. The members

TO MAYOR PHELAN
Some Queries That Are of
Interest to Voters.
A Few Facts About
Gas Rates and
Street Paving.
Supervisor Lawrence Devany has ad
dressed an open letter to Mayor Phelan
which contains some queries and state
ments of fact that are of particular in
terest at the present moment to the
voters of San Francisco. The part the
Mayor has played in recent events of a
public nature is fully dealt with and
serve to place Mr. Phelan in an en
tirely new light as a public official.
Mr. Devany has taken the public into
his confidence in this matter and it is
to be hoped the Mayor, in his reply,
â¢will be equally as generous, as the sub
ject matter of the communication deals
with matters that are of peculiar in
terest to the voters of this city. The
letter follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 25, 1898.
Hon. J. D. Phelanâ Sir: In reading
forae of your speeches I observe you have
made many statements which go far to
convince me that whatever acquaintance
you have â¢ â¢ â¢ with truth was not
made through the formality of an intro
duction.
Among other things which I will touch
on directly In your speech before the Non-
Partisan convention you said: "Mr.
Pevany on every square issue that af
fected the interests of the people voted
against the people." Will you kindly
state any vote recorded against me in the
Board of Supervisors which was against
the Interests of the people? Don't In
dulge in glittering generalities, but name
the vote â the record is open. You also
say: "Mr. Devany was a great disap
pointment to his friends." You are only
guessing at this, as you have no means
of knowing, as my friends in the clubs
are not numerous enough to justify you In
forming an opinion. If you had access to
those who have to work for a livingâ the
carpenters, for instance â who you think
ought to be satisfied with one dollar for
a day's wages, you might be able to as
certain how much of a disappointment I
am to my friends. Or you might try this
statement on the wheelmen, reminding
. of the fact that through their
unanimous support I received the largest
of any Supervisor. Ask them if
their demands for good streets and the
"repavlng of Market street" has been car
ried out to suit them, and to whom they
give credit for this work.
I see you are still coquetting with the
water question In spite of the kindly ad
vice the Supreme Court gave you in that
matter. But I suppose you must have
some amusement to relieve the arduous
cares of office. You also touch on the
â ie Jipht scandal." If there had
been Â«l> election there would be no scan
dal.
Perhaps the public would like to know
the history of this "scandal." The speci
fications for lighting the public streets
were approved by the entire board. The
cations were advertised and bids
invited. The only bidâ that of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company
was approved of and the contract award
ed to that company by the unanimous
vote of the board. The contract was sent
to you for your approval. You held the
contract the full legal length of time, re
turning it to the board without your ap
proval. You gave as your reasons that
in consequence of the board refusing the
Mutual Electric Company permission to
erect poles and wires that this company
was prevented from bidding. You omitted
to state that the board had refused the
same privilege to the Bay State Electric
Light Company, the Market Street Rail
way Company, the Spring Valley Water
Works, the Western Union Telegraph
Company, the Life Saving Station and all
other applicants, for the reason, with
which you singularly coincided, that the
board was opposed to the further erection
of poles and wires.
Had the board granted the petition of
the Mutual Electric Company there were
a dozen concerns having power to spare
ready to ask the board for the same priv
ilege. I will let it rest with the pub
lic whether the board acted unwisely in
refusing to permit the erection of any
more poles and wires. You state, when
ever you get an opportunity, that the
Mutual Company promised a saving of
540,000 on the lighting contract, but fall
to state that the charge for lighting this
year is about 10 per cent less than the
price last year, an actual, not a promised,
saving of nearly, if not quite, $40,000.
Your advice to the board to reject all
bids and await the decision of the Su
pierior Court in the case of the Mutual
Electric Company against the Board of
Supervisors would have plunged the city
in darkness had it been followed, as the
board has no power to purchase light ex
cept by inviting bids. Throwing the city
in darkness might have suited the pur
poses of your campaign, but I doubt if the
people generally would approve of such
action. I observe that you are very
solicitous about the welfare of the Mu
tual Electric Company, ignoring the fact
that there are other companies entitled
to as much consideration as the Mutual
Company. But. perhaps they are not as
close up to you.
But your latest veto affecting the pay
ment to the Gas and Electric Light Com
pany for payment of Its bill under this
contract is unique for the reasons given
therein. You claim that Supervisor liot
tanzi has no vote in the Council for the
reason that he holds a Federal position,
which is incompatible with the municipal
office to which he was elected. That Su
pervisor Rottanzi was unwise enough â
you would argue â to offer his services to
his country in time of need he should,
for that reason, be excluded from the
enjoynjent of the honors conferred upon
him by his fellow citizens. If all our
citizens were imbued with the intense
Americanism which you seem to possess
what a glorious ending the war would
have hadâ for Spain.
You nÂ»-xt take up the question of the
repaying of Market streetâ for which you
take the full credit. It has been stated
in the press quite recently that scientists
nave bu< ceeded in liquifying air. and that
the product is exiremely powerful, and if
not properly handled very dangerous. In
reading tliis the thought struck me that
your unparalleled success in manipulat
ing Boards of Supervisors and nominat
ing conventions might have been Instru
mental In causing the same startling ef
fect on your gall. With the possession
of a liquified gall It is easily conceivable
how you can lay claim to the credit of
having paved Market street, or of hav
ing accomplished anything during your
business administration to which you, or
any one else, can "point with pride."
You know you can truthfully tell the
public that you had nothing to do with
this workâ did not encourage itâ ln fact,
quietly opposed the use of California bi
tuminous rock In favor of the wooden
block pavement, which has proved an ut
ter, and to the taxpayer, an expensive,
failure. You complain that asphalt and
other "meritorious pavements" are ex
cluded from the street specifications. The
specifications now are the same as when
this board took office, and if the other
"meritorious pavements" are not includ
ed in the specifications it is because the
champions of these particular pavements
did not have faith enough in their lasting
qualities to accept the offer of the
Street Committee to put down experi
mental blocks at their own expense, lou
evidently have been more successful than
the board in succeeding in having an ex
perimental block of wooden pavement
laid.
The public is too familiar with the .all
ure of wooden block paving in this cityâ
a failure which has cost the taxpayers
thousands upon thousands of dollarsâ to
hazard any more experiments in this line.
It might be well to state that asphalt
pavements and bituminous rock pave
ments are the same thing-after they are
laid. There Is a difference, however, in
the preparation before the pavement is
laid. Asphalt Is artificially mixed, where
as bituminous sand rock is laid on the
street in the same state that it comes
from the hand 01 nature. In your speech
you state "with reference to keeping the
streets clean, I believe you pledged your
nominees to look carefully after that.
Th.- streets have been carefully looked
after. Then. too. the streets have been
much improved during the last two
years." You might have added, if you
cared to enlighten the convention, that,
with the exception of the writer, the
nominees of the Non-Partisan party vot
ed against every proposition for the
cleaning of streets; the repavlng of Mar
ket street, and the award of contracts for
the repair of bituminous rock streetsâ
this latter contract effecting a saving of
many thousands of dollars to the city,
and being the first systematic attempt at
repairing the bituminous rock streets yet
made.
"It is understood that there is a com
bination in the Board of Supervisors in
the interest of that particular pavement
(bituminous rock), and that all other
pavements, no matt&r how meritorious.
Including California asphalt pavements,
are excluded. This California asphalt
was offered when Market street was
about to be paved at a price very little
greater than that asked for bitumen."
For the ii.Tormation of your convention
I submit the figures which, in the hurry
and bustle of the moment, I presume you
omitted:
City Street Improvement Company, for
bituminous rock, $15,000.
Alcatraz Asphalt Paving Company, for
asphalt, $26,241 30.
A difference of JU.2-J1 30, or nearly 75 per
cent in favor of bituminous rock. It Is
rather fortunate for the city that an un
derstanding did not exist in the board In
favor of asphalt pavements.
"I have had some definite information
upon the subject of this understanding in
the board, but it is of such a character
that I cannot state as facts what I have
learned."
I would suggest that your public ut
terances during this campaign scarcely
justifies the public in expecting you to
state facts.
"I do not know what else I can tell you
that has occurred during the adminis
tration that will be of interest, except the
matter of unseating the Board of Super
visors. As to that, I think the chairman
of your convention knows even more
about it than I."
I do not wonder at your endeavoring
to drag in the chairman of the conven
tion or anybody else to share with you
the "honors" of that disgraceful affair.
The despicable part you took in that
matter is of public record, so need not
be dwelt on further. I can fully under
stand your protest at the delay of the
Supreme Court in rendering a decision in
this case and am pained to observe the
obtuseness of the press and people on
your position In this matter. If the pub
lic will go back to the period of the dis
cussion of the "water question" it will
remember that you took very decided
grounds in advising the board that so
long as the investigation was commenced
in February it might be prolonged to
the end of June. This opinion of yours
seems to have been concurred in by the
Supreme Court, and it is only human na
ture to expect that you should be eager
to have your opinion finally confirmed by
the highest tribunal of t .ie State. I
think, however, you were injudicious in
calling on the court in so public a man
ner. Had you telephoned the court with
a polite but linn request â mentioning
your name of course â to "rush" the de
cision, there is no question in my mind
that you, would have met with equal
if not greater success than you did by
your sandlot appeai.
I was spmewhat disappointed at the ac
count you gave of your "stewardship"
to the Democratls nominating convention.
I really thought your Heftiness would de
scend from the lofty perch you occupied
while addressing the Non-Partisan party,
but you maintained the same dizzy alti
tude before the Democratic convention.
I thought, for instance, that instead of
abusing every official, both elected and
appointed, you might have entertained
the convention with what you yourself
had done during the term of your busi
ness administration. You might have dis
pelled the tradition which still lingers
in the Tax Collector's office of that visit
of yours, and of the embarrassment
which followed when you discovered that
you had wandered into a strange place
and of your subsequent apologies for your
intrusion. You could have stated the re
sults of your visits to the various insti
tions over which you are supposed to
extend your watchful careâ for instance
the engine houses, jails and quasi public
institutions. When the FMnance Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors last paid
a visit to the public institutions it was
pleased to observe that although you had
not up to that time paid them a visit, yet
with rare thoughtfulness you sent your
portrait to one of the reformatories for
the adornment of the reception room.
While the sending of the portrait might
not conform to the letter of the law,
which requires your personal investiga
tion of all public and quasi public insti
tutions, still I do not think there are any
who are so censorious as to find fault
with your action in this particular in
stance.
You failed to make any mention of the
guessing contest you so successfully car
ried out in the Treasurers office, your
guess, though $118,000 short, was by far
the closest of any submitted. The
"Weekly Satellite" (the number contain
ing your portrait), in Its able editorial de
nouncing as malicious and false the
charge that in the contest you endeavored
to "See and Count," Instead of "heft" as
the conditions required, does you full jus
tice, when it further says: "That such
charges could only emanate from the de
based brain of some driveling editor who
has some two-bit contest of his own. We
have known Mr. Phelan since we were
boys; have played marbles with him and
we state without fear of successful con
tradiction that any one who says he
would take an unfair advantage of any
one is misinformed wrong." That you
have won the prize Is admitted by every
one and it now only remains for the ref
eree, the venerable Deacon Fitch, to pre
sent you to His Honor Judge Wallace to
receive It. That the Supreme Court will
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26, lfr9S.
deprive you of it, I think you need not
have the slightest fear, as you won fairly
and squarely.
I see you are trying to oil up the Sun
set District people after having vetoed
the bill for engineer's fees for the sewer
thus preventing its construction. You re
member you vetoed this bill on the ground
that the charge was excessive. This was
several months ago. But when a delega
tion from the Sunset Club came to you a
short time since you promised not to veto
the bill, but would let it become a law
without your signature. You kept your
word all right, but what puzzles me is
this: If the bill was excessive and ex
orbitant a few months ago why should
It not be just as excessive and exorbitant
now. Surely it cannot be because the
elections are close at hand and that there
are some votes in the Sunset District.
I observe that some of the papers take
exception to your wearing a "plug" hat.
I don't see where there can be any ob
jection to this practice, as it is the cus
tom with all club men. There is nothing
snobbish in this. It is not as if you
parted your name in the middle. For
Instance you might some of these days
be signing yourself J. Dennis Phelanâ and
even to this I suppose you will find a
few foolish objectors. Yours, etc.,

PHELAN AT NORTH BEACH.
Democratic Candidates Address a
Meeting in the Forty-Fourth
Assembly District.
The Democrats of the Forty-fourth As
sembly District met In Bersaglieri Hall
last night. The chief speakers of the
evening were Mayor Phelan, Bert Schles
inger, Franklin K. Lane and Barclay
Henley. Unfortunately for Mr. Phelan
he was late in arriving, and as Barclay
Henley had just had the platform the
hall was pretty well emptied. Dr. Wash
ington Dodge had intended making Nt.
speech, but when he arrived and found
Henley talking he started out in search
of another meeting, remarking that he
did not care to talk to empty chairs.
Mr. Schlesinger was the first speaker.
He started with James G. Maguire and |
went right through the ticket. While i
he had good words for all the Democratic |
candidates, he had nothing to say against
those on the Republican ticket, except
that they were untried. He did harp for
a time on the monopoly string, but could
find no possible way of connecting the
names of the Republican nominees with
any of the corporations. Richard P. Doo_
lan was then presented and promised
that the streets of North Beach would
be his particular care. Franklin K.
Lane took the platform and almost wept
as he spoke of the terrible calamitic-s
which would fall upon the city if the
Republican candidates were elected and,
incidentally, promised a revolution in the
City Hall should he be cnosen as City
and County Attorney. He could not see
how those untried and terrible Repub
lican standard bearers could ever be
elected.
To a rapidly diminishing audience Bar
clay Henley then Â» began to tell of the
unquestioned honesty of every Democrat
on the ticket, and said that Phelan's de
feat would be proof that man's capacity
for self-government is a failure.
Mayor Phelan finally arrived and was
given a hearty welcome by a crowd of
small boys equipped with fish horns and
police whistles, who had monopolized one
corner of the gallery. His speech was
the same old story. He held up his re
cord during the past two years as some
thing beyond reproach and threatened
the downfall of the gas and water com
panies if re-elected. He also placed him
self on record as being the best friend
the poor workingman ever had.
Short spoechf-s were made by Dr. Ice
land, Jeremiah Deanr, Flnlay Cook. T. F.
Bonnet, Rhodes Borden and Lewis F. By
ington.
Addressed the Sailors.
Democrats held a mass meeting at
Sailors' Union Hall, at East and Mission
streets, last night. There was a fair
attendance and a number of municipal
candidates were on the platform. Mayor
Phelan addressed his remarks principal
ly to the sailors, and claimed that the
success of the party would mean the
growth of an immense commercial trade j
for the port of San Francisco. He again i
referred to the newspapers as doing him '
serious wrong, and urged that it was !
necessary for him to appear before the
people to counteract their injurious
statements.
Washington Dodge, candidate for As
sessor, told the sailors how he would
heap taxation upon the corporations and
lessen their burdens. He was followed
by E. L. Fitzgerald, Rhodes Borden, i
James N. Block, John A. Brown, William i
M. Hlnton, John P. Dunn, Judge Conlan,
Lawrence Hoey, H. B. Andrews, Bernard
Bienenfield, Frank J. Murasky, L. F. By
ington, F. K. Lane, E. P. Mogan arid T.
F. Bonnet.
Edward Holland Club.
Saturday night the Edward Holland Re
publican Club was formed in the parlors
of the Commercial Hotel. The meeting
was called to order by Harry Lewis, act
ing as chairman. Following are the
names of the officers selected: President,
Gabriel Jacobs; secretary, H. Marks;
treasurer, R. I. Wren; sergeant at arms,
F. Sellinger. Edward Holland, nominee
for Supervisor, First Ward, on the Re
publican, Non-Partisan and Citizen's Re
publican tickets, spoke briefly, alluding to
the coming election as a most important
one.
Colored Republicans.
The Forty-third Assembly District Col
ored Republican Club held a meeting at
11 Stockton street Monday night. After
the usual business was transacted the
club adjourned to attend the meeting of
the Afro-American League. The league
was addressed by the Hon. Charles L.
Patton and John Neamoore of Los An
geles.
Julius Kahn Club.
The Julius Kahn Republican Club of
the Thirty-first district met Monday night
at Tierney's Hall. About sixty new mem
bers signed the roll. Thomas Graham.
William A. Deane, M. L. Tierney and Ed
Holland addressed the meeting, and re
ceived a rousing reception. The club de
cided to attend the Gage and Neff parade
in a body.
Meeting of Republicans.
The Twenty-third Assembly District
Republican Club will hold a meeting on
Thursday evening at Potrero Opera
House. Charles L. Patton and other cai^
didates will make addresses. It is ex
pected that the meeting will be the larg
est ever held In the district.
Judge Louderback.
As the election campaign progresses
interest in the selection of Superior
Judges increases. There are four to be
elected. Among the various candidates
Judge Louderback is eminently fitted
to occupy the Superior Court bench. He
was Police Judge some years ago, but
voluntarily retired from the position.
He made one of the best Police Judges
that San Francisco ever had, and his
record was pure and honorable. Un
der his administration life and prop
erty were protected and crime and vice
suppressed. His public, private and
professional life and character have
been pure and excellent. There are
various reasons why Judge Davis Lou
derback should be elected. He is a
foe to vice and crime and the low and
vile are combining against him. He
will not be owned nor controlled by
corporations nor monopolies, but will
decide all matters according to the
right of the case. He is the candidate
of the p*eople who want to place the
courts beyond the power of corpora
tions, politicians and ringsters.

TO WORKINGMEN
Another Big Meeting
on the South Side.
SHORT PARLEYS IN ORDER
NEW CHARTER AND PUBLIC
UTILITIES THE THEME.
All of the Republican Municipal Can
didates Gather at a Bally at
Twenty-Seventh and Ala
bama Streets.
There was another booming Republi
can meeting on the "sunny side" of
Market street last evening, to which
over 300 of the men employed at the dif
ferent car shops and factories in that
district turned out to hear the Republi
can nominees on principles and pledges.
The meeting took place at a hall on
the corner of Twenty-seventh and Ala
bama streets, and though the quarters
were too crowded for comfort, there
was no dearth of enthusiasm.
All of the prominent candidates and
able speakers of the party were on
hand, and though the speeches were for
the most part of no great length they
were well received and went farther
in the way of influence than would
have the same number of lengthier ad
dresses.
Charles L. Patton spoke to his hear
ers of the possibilities that would ex
ist under the new charter. Public own
ership of public utilities, he said, would
be not only a possibility but a proba
bility. The gas and water and the
street car companies to which this city
under present conditions pays such
large tribute could,' under the provis
ions of the new charter, be forced to
content themselves with four or five
per cent of profit rather than the enor
mous rate that they demand to-day.
Gradually, he said, the city and the
people would come to the possession of
these utilities themselves. "You have
elected to live under that charter," said
Mr. Patton, "and no man or set of men
have the right to say that you shall
not. If I am elected I shall certainly
see to it to the extent that I can that
no man or set of men does deprive
us of that right." Mr. Patton also
stated that he is confident that this city
can be run at an expense that will not
exceed a rate of $1 on every hundred
of the assessed valuation of $350,000,000,
and he proposed to conduct municipal
business on the same careful and eco
nomical lines that he wouid a business
of his own.
D. J. Murphy, who is out against the
Mexican "Sword of Damocles" for Dis
trict Attorney, spoke in his usual stir
ring manner and was frequently inter
rupted by the hearty applause of his
hearers. He spoke not only in his own
behalf but as well for his fellows on the
ticket. He referred to his record on the
bench in this county and his twenty
four years in public life and defied any
of his opponents to bring aught against
him that had not been honest and
above board.
Henry Martin ambled In with a smile
for self and Kahn, "who could not be
there," and said that he had not come
to make a speech but to get better ac
quainted. After proposing three cheers
for him, which were liberally bestowed.
Justice of the Peace Barry partly filled
the space he had occupied, and in one
of his graceful speeches explained his
theories of justice, and "aye an earm-st
pledge of fealty to the constitution and
the people whose suffrages he is seek
ing.
I. J. Truman was introduced, and said
that if elected, one of his first official
acts would be to abolish the "hefting"
practice now in vogue in the Treas
urer's office. He said that his friend,
Asa Wells, "who will be the next Audi
tor," will have the duty of counting the
cash that will come under the care of
the Treasurer, and he thought that with
him and Mr. Patton to supervise the
proceeding the people could he reason
ably sure of eventually getting their
share at least of the public funds.
William A. Deane did not need either
introduction or exposition. He was
greeted with hearty cheers and after
a. few words was allowed to go on to
the next meeting.
Thomas F. Graham Judge Low.
Judge Joachimsen and A. B. Treadwell.
who are listed for Police Judges, were
introduced, and acknowledging Judicial
dignity, said only enough to assure
their hearers that their principles were
right.
Coroner Hawkins spoke for only a
minute. He said that he thoueht his
administration had been indorsed by
his renomination to the office that he
has filled during the past two years.

POLL TAX AS
AN ISSUE IN
THE CAMPAIGN
A Collector Talks of
His Experience.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 25.
The poll tax has been brought into the
present campaign by the independent can
didate for the Assembly, William J.
Schmidt, who pledges himself to intro
duce a bill into the Legislature to stop
the collection of poll tax. There is not
much chance for Mr. Schmidt's election,
as the Republican nominee, A. A. Mc-
Keon Is making a winning fight, but the
poll tax matter is receiving much atten
tion.
John A. Foster, who has made a record
on a poll tax collector, published the fol
lowing statement this evening:
Having read with a great deal of attention
ami interest the different articles published on
the poll tax question, and noting that corre
spondents are either unable or unwilling to
give the real reason why the tax is so un
popular, I thought 1 would give my experience
as poll tax collector four years ago. When I
was appointed by Henry Dalton as poll tax
collector in March. 1894, I told him if he
wanted his personal or political friends spared
to appotnt surne other man, as if he appointed
me 1 would know neither friend nor foe in the \
matter. His answer was: "That is the kind !
of man I want; one that will do his whole i
duty."
1 started in to collect the tax. I found that
the office-holders, county and city, almost to
a man, refused to pay. They stated to me that
they hail always been exempt and did not pro
pose to pay anyway. I started In and attached
the salaries of the officials of the Police. Fire ;
und Street departments in the city, a Judge
of the Superior Court and several county ofri
cials, and finally brought them all to time.
That is one reason why the tax is so unjust
and unpopular. Why should the poor sewer
digger be forced to pay and the high-salaried
official go free? One president of a bank in
Oakland refused to pay until I threatened to
seize the furniture of the hank for his poll
tax. An ex-Judge of this county, who sat on
the bench many years, informed me that he
had never even been asked for his poll tax
in all the years he / had been in Oakland. I
doubt very much wnethf-r you could find a me
cbanic or laboring man in this city who would :
say the same.
I believe that If the tax was collected fairly
from every man who was able to pay, without
respect to his position in society or his political
affiliations, you would hear very little" com
plaint against the tax. The object of the tax
is a good one, as it goes to the maintenance
of our public schools, less, of course, the 15
per cent commission for collecting. And let
me say right here, the abuse the poll tax col
lector receives is such that I would not ac
cept the position again for twice the- salary.
In conclusion let me say the poll tax. ae it
is enforced in nearly every' county in this State,
is a curse to the poor man. as he and he alone
Is made to pay it. JOHN A. FOSTER.
1924 Filbert street, i
There is some dissatisfaction over the
manner in which the party designations
of the different candidates appear on the
official ballot. In each instance the fu
sionists are first classified as "People's
party." then "Democrats" and so on. The
Democrats have made some objection to,
this and claim that their party name
should take precedence. This view of the
matter does not suit the Populists, who do
not see why they are not as deserving of
prominence as the Democrats. A delega
tion of candidates visited the County
Clerk's office anil asked to have the or
der changed, and it is possible that the
alphabetical rule will prevail.
This evening there was a united rally
of the Young Men's Republican Club and
the regular Seventh Ward Republican
Club at Castle Hall. The attendance was
very large.

receipt of letters from all parts of the

Big Republican Meeting.
The regular weekly meeting of the
Fortieth Assembly District Republican
Club will be held at the club's hall, south
west corner of Post and Fillmore streets,
at 8 o'clock this evening. Most of those
prominent on the Republican municipal
ticket will be present to tell the truth, as
they see it, and to meet the voters of the
district on their own ground. An inter
esting evening will no doubt be the result,
and it behooves those who have been un
fortunate enough not to have heard the
candidates speak previously to be present.
Ninety-Eight Republican Club.
The '9S Republican Club held a very
large meeting at Cadets' Hall, 335 McAl
lister street, last evening. A communi
cation was read from the Bear Club in
viting the '98 Republican Club to attend
its mass meeting next Friday evening.
By unanimous vote the club decided to
attend In a body. I. B. McFarland was
indorsed for Supreme Judge. Clarence
Gray in his remarks spoke very highly of
John D. Siebe, Henry S. Martin, Charles
L. Patton and Henry T. Gage.

GUILTY, BUT DON'T CfIRE.
WELLS-FARGO people have had their lesson,
but don't seem to have taken it to heart. They
need another, more severe. Attorney-General
Fitzgerald is in a position to give it to them. He lias
the authority. He has ample grounds. It is true that
he has campaign duties to attend to, but these can
not be more imperative than the duties of his office.
Despite the fact that the Costley suit was decided
against the express company, that it has paid the costs
and the damages, it proposes still to exact from the
people the price of the revenue stamp which Congress
specifically said the company should pay. It does
this because it thinks patrons will be too busy to hag
gle over the cent, and some of them are. Demonstra
tion has been made, however, that no patron needs
submit to the imposition if he choose to take the mat
ter to the courts.
The reason the Wells-Fargo people, headed by that
great and good man, Valentine, are still obdurate is
that they know of a test case somewhere in the East
which they wish to see carried to the tribunal of last
resort. Their patience is beautiful to see. Delay
to them is as good as actual victory. They have hopes
that before a final decision can be reached the war
tax will be a thing of the past. Then what will they
care what the decision may be? Nothing. They will
have had their illegal gain, and there can be no re
covery.
So Mr. Fitzgerald should hurry up. Every day
â which goes by is marked by a series of petty swin
dle? on the part of the Wells- Fargo Express Company.
The people are the victims, and the Attorney-General
is expected to give them the protection to which they
are entitled without an hour's delay.
fj POINT FOR PriELflN.
THE tide which is running against Mayor Phelan,
and which bids fair to overwhelm him on the
Bth of next month, possibly might be stemmed
it he would return to the taxpayers the $16,000 lost by
Widber's defalcation. The Mayor's endeavor to sub
stitute a "hefting" system for the old plan of counting
the treasury money was the direct cause of the loss,
and he is morally if not legally responsible for it.
Inasmuch as he believes in responsible officials and
advocates honesty in public office, a moral respon
sibility should be as binding upon him as a legal one.
As we understand it, the people of this city doubt
the sincerity of the Mayor because of the discovery
that he is a careless and indifferent official, chiefly in
terested in getting places for his personal friends, and
for that reason ambitious of becoming a political boss.
Were he to draw a check for $16,000, and thus assume
responsibility for at least one result of his careless
ness, he would do much to check the public sentiment
that is rising against him. In such an event the peo
ple would feel that they were getting something for
Phelanism. They would feel that if they re-elected
him and more money were lost through his practice
of "hefting," he, and not the taxpayers, would be the
loser.
It will be remembered that when it was discovered
that Treasurer Widber had taken advantage of the
Mayor's custom of "hefting" the sacks in the treasury
to steal $116,000, Mr. Phelan hustled around, counted
the money and forced the surety company to liquid
ate its bond of $100,000. But here his hustling
ceased. There was still a deficit of $16,000, and the
last statement of the Auditor reports that amounts as
a loss. Mr. Phelan felt his responsibility while the
$116,000 hole made by Widber in the treasury was
still yawning, but the moment the surety company put
its share up his nerve returned, and he has allowed
the taxpayers to pocket the residuary loss. In other
words, Mr. Phelan is willing that his "hefting" habits
shall cost the taxpayers $16,000.
It is quite plain that this is the argument that is
controlling a large number of the Democrats and Re
publicans who are making up their minds daily to vote
against him. They reason that a man of Mr. Phelan's
wealth who causes them to lose $16,000 by the in
troduction of an absurd system of "hefting," is mor
ally bound to make good the amount. Therefore we
do not hesitate to express the opinion that if the
Mayor will draw a check for $16,000 in favor of the
City Treasurer it will materially aid his election. It
might not carry him through, as many people still
might regard it as a delayed contribution to the con
science fund, but that it would tend to stem the swift
running tide of defeat is unquestionable.
Besides, the money might better be expended in
discharging an obligation of this kind than in hiring
strikers to boom Phelanism in the corner groceries.
If the Mayor spends $16,000 this year he will have to
do it in violation of the purity act. Moreover, the
money belongs 1 to the people, and he has no moral
right to spend it at aIL
MENTAL ABERRATION QT STANFORD.
WHATEVER student virtues may be possessed
by those callow and inconsiderate youths at
Stanford University who have organized them
selves into Maguire clubs and are now shouting and
spouting for the single taxer, it cannot be claimed for
them even by their friends that they are at all loyal
to the welfare of their alma mater, or have any re
gard for the memory or the principles of the great
man who founded it and endowed it with all his wealth
that it might serve for the education of youth.
Maguire has denounced Leland Stanford by every
opprobrious epithet which his brain, fertile in billings
gate, could produce. The denunciations began while
Stanford was alive, and have not ceased with his \
death. According to Maguire, Stanford was a thief,
a perjurer, an extortioner, a briber of judges and
legislators, the corrupt author of a thousand corrup- j
tions. According. to Maguire, Stanford University 'â 
was founded in iniquity and endowed with the profits ;
of plunder. Every one who accepts a salary from its
revenues, or shares in the munificence of its endow
ments, is a receiver of stolen goods and a sharer in the
proceeds of fraud and dishonor.
Maguire has not limited his antagonism to Stan
ford University to bad language. So far as he is
capable of acting as well as talking, he has acted
against it. He did his best to have the Government
take from the university every dollar that Stanford
gave it. He sought to have the bill providing for the
settlement of the Government's claims against the
Central Pacific so devised that the property of the
university would be taken by the Government.
Could he have had his way. there would be no Stan
ford University, except in name. The great founda
tion would have been stripped of everything it pos
sessed, even to the land on which the buildings stand,
and the students who are now enjoying its advantages
would have had to seek their education elsewhere.
Nor does the menace of Maguireism to the univer
sity cease with the passage of the funding bill and the
settlement of the railroad indebtedness. The greater
part of the munificent endowment of the institution
consists of land. If Maguire can get his single taxers
in power in California he will make short work of
that endowment A year or two of their taxation
would virtually confiscate the property of the univer
sity and leave the institution without revenues.
The schools, the lecture-room, the museums and the
libraries would have to be closed for lack of money
to maintain them. The great structures would pass
to other and widely different uses from that for which
they were designed, and in place of the stately quad
rangle, with its attendant buildings, which now so
fittingly stand as a memorial of the great railroad
builder. Governor, Senator and philanthropist, there
would be but a desolation to bear witness of the tri-
umph of James G. Maguire.
Many vagaries can be, and are, pardoned in young
men at universities, but treason to their alma mater,
or indifference to her welfare, is not one that can be
lightly looked upon. The group of Stanford youths
who are shouting for Maguire in this campaign have
carried folly too far.
THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.
rROM the vantage ground of the national cap
ital, where political campaigns are unknown, but
where all parties are represented by their Con
gressional committees, the Washington Post has been
making a careful study of the situation throughout
the country, and has found reasons for believing the
Republicans will control the next Congress if they
are active and vigilant this fall, but will be in a mi
nority if they permit either over-confidence, indiffer
ence, apathy or any other cause to lead them to neg
lect their duties at the coming election.
According to reports gathered by the Post the Re
publicans are fairly certain of 166 seats, the Democrats
are about equally sure of 128 seats, while the Popu
lists and Silver Republicans are conceded twenty-one
seats. This leaves forty-two seats in doubt. If the
Republicans can win thirteen of the doubtful seats and
hold all that are accounted certain, they will have a
majority, while the opposition to control the House
must win thirty of the doubtful places in addition to
those which the Post concedes them.
On the face of it this report is highly encouraging.
It appears, however, that many seats in the present
Congress were won by very narrow majorities, and it
will take but a slight falling off from the Republican
vote of 1896 to return Democrats or Populists to the
next Congress in place of Republicans. The fight,
therefore, is one which must rouse the energy of Re
publicans everywhere. Any weakness in the ranks of
the party may result in such Democratic successes as
will either give them control of the House of Repre
sentatives or reduce the Republican majority to so
small a number that it will be seriously hampered in
undertaking important legislation.
In a recent review of the work of the Congressional
campaign committees in Washington the Post says:
"There is no disguising the renewed activity at Dem
ocratic headquarters these days. The Democratic
leaders have encouragement that they may win out
after all, and this has stirred them to unusual efforts
of late. * * * The chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Committee, Senator White of Califor
nia, has been in that field all summer, and Represen
tative Osborne of Wyoming, the vice chairman, after
aiding in the work of organization at headquarters
for about a month, has gone West again."
With both the chairman and the vice chairman of
their Congressional Committee in the Western field,
it is clear the Democrats are to make a hard fight for
every Congressional seat in this part of the country.
They have undertaken something like a still hunt.
Since the Republican victory in Oregon no Demo
cratic brass bands have been heard banging away for
free silver, free trade or Bryanism. The present tactics
are for fusion, State issues and silence. This form of
canvass may be one of political cowardice, but it is
insidious and dangerous.
Republicans cannot afford to overlook a single
point in the fight. An effort should be made to carry
every district in California for the administration,
sound money, protection and prosperity, and to send
to Washington a delegation honestly representative
of our interests, our principles and our people.
The Call has published in fac simile the shameful
contract made by Hearst's paper with the Southern
Pacific, showing that the company in self-defense had
to bribe to silence a blackmailer from whose asper
sions it could not otherwise have regarded itself as
safe. And it was not safe after all.
Perhaps there is no other statesman contending
with more devils and deep seas than surround Blanco.
And the world, having noticed the manner of man he
is, doesn't care a cent whether the devils get him or
he jumps into the brine.
Maguire says he is not an anarchist. Gage does not
have to say anything of this kind in relation to him
self.
Race wars in the South seem to be particularly
fatal to brunettes.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1898.
SOME NECESSARY RETRISCTIONS.
WHEN a public utility is controlled by a mon
opoly it must be subject to restrictions. Left
to itself, greed becomes its guiding sentiment,
and the rights oi the public are forgotten.
In California the most absolute monopoly is the
telephone company. It has no opposition, no par
; ticuiar prospects of any, and it waxes fat and arrogant.
It forgets that its patrons have rights, or, if it re-
I members, does not care. Therefore it has become
necessary this monopoly be called to the attention of
' the Legislature. It has not yet grown too mighty to
i be called down.
According to authentic reports, the receipts of the
i concern are as high as $3,000,000 yearly, of which im
mense sum 25 per cent represents profit. In consid
eration of this fact, it will be the duty of the Legisla
ture to investigate, to ascertain the character and ex
tent of the investment, and to fix the rate at such a
figure as to permit a reasonable income, and no more.
Twenty-five per cent on $3,000,000 is not only too
much, but so much too much as to be absurd. The
regulation of this matter is clearly within the pur
view of the Legislature, and candidates for the Senate
and Assembly should be asked to declare where they
stand.
In the District of Columbia a telephone company
once thought itself supreme. Congress appointed a
committee to investigate, and the committee reported
that the company could supply telephones at $50 per
year and yet realize a fair profit. Congress thereupon
made a law setting this limit. As soon as Congress had
adjourned the company set up the claim that this rate
applied only to Government telephones. As yearly
contracts expired, subscribers tendered $50 for re
newal, and the corporation declined to receive it,
threatening to take out the telephones. The sub
scribers applied for an injunction, won in the courts,
and the company accepted the stipulated sum, doing
it, too, without getting near a condition of bank
ruptcy. The local company is as subject to whole
some regulation. It merits treatment as condign.
Let the next Legislature bear this fact in mind.
There is another matter in relation to which the
telephone company needs rebuke. No telegraph
operator will reveal any information which may come
to him in the course of business. A secret ticked to
him over the wire is held inviolate. He is forbidden
by law and by honor to reveal it. The telephone em
ploye leaks like a sieve. The news sent in to one
paper is tattled to another. Matters which should be
held in confidence become the subject of gossip. This
is not only wrong, but so far wrong as to call for in
terference. There should be legal enactment for
bidding it and prescribing a penalty. The penalty now
is nothing more than distrust. This seems not to be
sufficient. It should be made unlawful for an agent.
manager or superintendent to extend special privi
leges to any one, for in respect of telephones all who
use them are supposed to pay the same rate, and all
should stand on an equal plane.
THE middle-of-the-road Populists of the State
at large are in much the same position politi
cally as the old line Democrats of this city. The
latter on one side are confronted by defeat of their
party, and on the other by Phelanism. To their credit
it must be said they are generally accepting defeat as
the lesser of the evils.
The Democrats of this city were able for several
years to survive Buckleyism and its attendant evils,
but it is questionable whether they could weather a
single season of such bossism as Mayor Phelan has
been giving them â appointed State delegations and
conventions, cooked up tickets, buncombe issues and
a general suppression of the rank and file of the party.
The local Democracy is, therefore, to be congratu
lated on its determination to sweep the entire Phelan
brood off the field. That is the shortest and surest
road to the rehabilitation of the party.
There are periods in the history of all political or
ganizations when it becomes necessary to defeat
them. Sometimes annihilation at the ballot-boxes,
which never obliterates vital principles, results in as
tonishing purification. We agree with Mr. Shanahan,
the middle-of-the-road nominee for Governor, who
has been shut off the ticket by the Maguire fusionists,
that their party label, party platform, party prestige
and party principles having been stolen by a band of
Democratic office-seekers, it is in order for the Popu
lists to retaliate. If the People's party is to be saved
at this time it must be saved by drastic measures. It
never can be saved by the election of Maguire. On
the contrary, his success would undoubtedly de
stroy it.
A majority of Populists are farmers â the very class
whose property will be confiscated by the triumph of
Maguire's single tax plans. How can these men %'ote
for candidates whose success means indirectly the in
troduction into California of a system of taxation
which will deprive them of their land? Maguire has
said that the single tax "must be forced into the poli
tics of California," and he is forcing it in now by de
claring that it is not an issue and that if elected he will
possess no power to establish it.
Th|re is but one way for the middle-of-the-road
Populists â and, in fact, all Populists who regard prin
ciple as paramount to pelf â to save their party from
destruction in this campaign. They must imitate
Mr. Shanahan and vote the entire Republican ticket.
There are no other means by which they can let loose
their sentiments. The Maguire party has shut them
off the official ballot, has stolen their platform, ap
propriated their name and adopted as much of their
campaign thunder as it considers of value. If it can
get the Populist vote by this process, the middle-of
the-road men may as well give up in despair. They
have been sold by a few of their office-seeking leaders
on a time contract. If the goods can be delivered on
November 8, Populism in California on that day will
pass into history.
Because this paper congratulated Mrs. Botkin upon
her escape from the necessity of talcing a trip to Dela
ware, the Bulletin jumps to the conclusion that a para
graph palpably intended as a reflection upon the lax
ness of the law against murder was really meant to
felicitate the prisoner. It is such sundown breaks as
this which lend strength to the theory that the Bul
letin is edited by an idiot.

THE POPULIST DILEMMA.
PHELAN ON A BRIDGE OF SIGHS.
How tfte Destruction of tbe Primaries by the Plug-Hat
Boss Menaces the Citizens' Rights.
Dear Sir: The statesmen who founded this republic knew by bitter ex
perience that the power of the people might be used against the people
Therefore they exhausted human ingenuity in the attempt to safeguard
the rights of the plain citizen, your rights and mine. And in the first place
they divided political power among so many officials that there could be lit
tle chance of any one of them setting so much power as to render him
independent of the people. Hence we have the law-making power independ
ent of the executive, and the judiciary independent of both. It is against the
American system to combine these powers in the hands of one man. The
gravest danger that could confront the plain citizen, you and me, is that
any one man should control all these departments of the Government.
But as we are plain people we must deal with plain facts. There are
men who strive to circumvent the precautions of our forefathers. They
try to get control of the various branches of the Government by controlling
the officials. Such men are bosses. We know they exist. We cannot eradi
cate them. We must make the best we can of them. Our own experience
tells us, and I'ie experience of the founders of this commonwealth that the
more bosses there are the less dangerous any one of them is. We must
deal with them as our fathers dealt with political offices. We must multiply
their number and thus divide their power. The greatest danger that can
menace our interests, your interests and mine, is the big boss that can buy
all the little bosses and rule alone.
BUT THE INGENUITY OF THE
Men who established this Government provided another remedy against
the danger that the power of the people might be used against the people.
At frequent Intervals the power granted to officials is returned to the citizens.
The men who have been elevated by the people's power return to the com
mon mass and there they remain unless the citizens think well to intrust
them with the same power once more.
In theory it is true that any citizen may run for office. But the common
fate of independent or sporadic candidates is not such as to tempt aspirants.
No man wishes to run for office unless he has a reasonable chance of win
ning. The number of those voters who belong to groups or parties of men
is so great that the candidate who is selected as the representative of such
group or party has a tremendous advantage in the race for power. It is
only in very exceptional cases that a man who has no organization to support
him Rets into office, and plain people, like you and me, are not dealing
with exceptional cases.
The usual method by which a candidate's name is proposed to the peo
ple is through a party nomination. The boss therefore who wishes to con
trol the offices makes it his duty to see that only his friends get the nomi
nations. He tries to control the nominating machinery, and he usually has
his candidates selected long before the nominating convention meets.
BY SECURING THE CONTROL. OF THE CONVENTION
The boss defeats this device for preventing the power given by the people
from injuring the people. The plain citizen has no hope except in nominating
conventions in which there are many bosses. In the ideal convention every
man would be his own master, but there are few ideal conventions in these
United States, and none in San Francisco. Therefore the most the plain citizen
can look to is the increase of bosses in a convention. If there are ten or
twelve bosses in the convention they will be compelled to unite on some
neutral candidate in order to make a nomination at all. The more neutral
ity the candidate has in his composition the better for the plain citizen â
fur you and me. If there be only one boss in the convention he can nomi
nate his own henchmen, and the only remedy left the plain citizen is to
vote the other ticket if he votes at all.
Hence, as far as our rights go, we want to increase the number of bosses
in the nominating convention as well as everywhere else. To you and to
me the danger comes not from the dozen small bosses, but from the big boss
that can buy them all.
Now, a convention is supposed to come directly from the people. The
members of the party or organization select the delegates immediately.
Such election is known as a primary and the electors are all those who
care to identify themselves with a political party. The plain citizen very
seldom troubles himself about the primaries. We are content to leave the
management of them to those who take a special interest in politics. We
usually think it enough to vote at the general elections. Of course the
plain citizen knows that the primary is very important. You and I have
heard the exhorters and the expounders urge us again and again to go to
the primaries. But somehow or another we don't go. We must accept
the facts about ourselves as well as the facts about others â the plain citizen
is not numerous at the primary.
BUT ARE WE THEREFORE TO REJECT THE PRIMARY
And consider it of little use? By no means. It is our great safeguard.
It is, as it were, an open door for bosses. Every political leader who is
worth his salt can make an impression at the primaries. It is the portal
by which he enters into public life. He can extort there at least a locus
standi. The primary Is an open call â come one come all. No "matter how
the boss may be said to control it there is always an opportunity for an
other boss to get in. The primary, therefore, of its very nature contributes
to the multiplication of bosses and for that reason to the safety of the plain
citizen â to your safety and to mine.
But Mr. Phelan has no love for the multiplication of bosses. He wishes
to be the sole and only boss and with his keen eye for his advantage in
politics he looks askance oh the primary. He gives his reasons quite frank
ly. "The bosses," he says, "will get hold of it. I wish to be the only boss
in the party and I do not intend to have my power disputed. If I have
claimed the right to dictate to the Supervisors and the judiciary surely I
am not going to suffer some mere member of the party to have opinions of
his own and to differ from me."
It is very seldom that the bosses dare to dispense with a primary.
The old bosses do not love the primary more than Mr. Phelan because
every primary introduces a new batch of bosses into the political world.
But a certain regard for public opinion compels them. Even their follow
ers expect it. But with Mr. Phelan it is different. He has too much in the
balance. He is playing for big stakes. He is no ordinary boss, who shares
his power with half a dozen others. He is the big boss who is to rule all.
He cannot brook opposition. He therefore considers it better to fly in the
face of all precedent rather than tempt the possibility that any one should
be nominated for office who might differ from him. He still believes in
dinners, but if he can control the next Board of Supervisors without giving
them dinners it is so much money saved. Even millionaires have been
known to be thrifty.
BETWEEN ELECTION AND ELECTION
An appointed committee usually takes charge of the few Interests of the
political party demanding attention. Before election its duty is to call a con
vention and then resign. But Mr. Phelan saw a new use for such a com
mittee. He first took care to fill it with his followers. Then he compelled
it to declare against primaries as a nuisance and finally he made it resolve
Itself into a nominating convention of the party.
His object has not been concealed. He wished to secure his own nomi
nation and the nomination of men who would support his policy. In other
words he wished to make it absolutely certain that if his party is success
ful at election he shall hold the city government in the hollow of his hand.
The plain citizen like you and me is usually suspicious of the politicians
of both sides. We know the worth of their professions and promises. That
Mr. Phelan is a politician and a smart politician his tactics prove. Of him
we are not only suspicious â we are afraid. He aims after more power than
one man should have. He is trying to build a Chinese wall round the offices*
of this cityâ a Chinese wall with one doorâ a door of which he alone holds
the key.
You and I have been raised in the good old belief that this country
gives every man an opportunity. Mr. Phelan believes otherwise. He haa
built a new bridgeâ a short cut to power â and no man may pass ov.er that
bridge unless he pays toll to Mr. Phelan. Other bosses have built such
bridges and have collected toll in the shape of coin. This is Mr. Phelan's
reason, so he tells the people, why he has built his bridge. But he takes
toll of the opinions of men, of thtir manhood, of their Independency. No
candidate can put foot on Mr. Phelan's bridge unless he thinks as Mr
Phelan thinks. It is a new Bridge cf Sighs, the emblem of the tyranny that
may take hold of a great commercial city.
This is the gravest outrage yet committed against American principle.
Better die in the Almshouse and retain the right to freedom of thought
than wallow in the spoils of office with as much mental liberty as the hog
in the byre. Yours truly, A PLAIN CITIZEN.

FINAL RESULTS OF FUSION.
Editor of The Call: After reading this
morning in The Call Mr. Shanahan's re
view of the political situation as seen
from a strtaight Populist point of view,
and while feeling: a deep sense of satis
faction with his masterly presentation of
the subject, it seems to me there yet re
mains a serious reason for repudiating
fusion which should have weight and re
ceive equal consideration among intelli
gent and honorable men of every po
pltical faith or affiliation, which I feel
it my duty under existing conditions to
state as briefly as possible.
I refer to the moral aspects of this fu
sion question, since if fusion is to become
a. settled and successful method of mak
ing nominations for office and conduct
ing political campaigns the country must
be prepared for the Inevitable results
which are to folllow.
The basis of fusion is compromiseâ a
compromise with conscienceâ as Judge
Maguire, for example. putÃ aside his sin
gle tax doctrine, which is his most pro
found and earnest political conviction I
supposeâ ln order that common ground
on some kind of issue may be found for
the temporary "union of forces" to se
cure a common objectâ the same object
In every known Instance of fusion, name
ly, the election of certain men in each
party to office. Is not this true? Is Jt
not a fair statement? Even the most ar
dent fusionist will say yes to both of
these questions. Fusion Is then a com
promise of principle, of one's moat sin
cere convictions, the Ignoring of an hon
est man's most cherished desire, the
hushing of a patriofs most unselfish aspi
rations for the welfare of his country,
that certain men may combine and get
into office.
It follows that if the American people
in the mass do not repudiate fusion al
the pells the time is near a_t hand when
men of conviction must retire from poll
tics, for office-seekers alone who can
unite with any class of voters to secure
election will till the offices, make and ad
minister our laws, with like men for
Judges to p;iss upon these laws, and the
end of our form of government has then
come, for no nation can survive the dom
inance of compromisers and place-hunt-
I 'desire to say to all straight and earn
est Populists that I think our first and
most urgent duty in this campaign Is to
do our utmost to destroy fusion, root and
branch, and my view "f duty in this exi
gency is to vote for Gage, the Republi
can candidate for Governor, and for no
fusion candidate whatever. T^ TTVT(=r . xr

GEORGE LAVIGNE
TALKS OF HIS PLANS
The Saginaw Kid's Sad and Touching Tale
of a Four Thousand Dollar Bill That
Might Have Gone for Beer.
GEORGE LAVIGNB, the world's lightweight champion, is in town, not
only ready but anxious to meet Tom Tracey. the Australian. ' The
Sagrinaw Kid is in splendid condition, and as usual goes in this fight
to win.
Lavigne was in a reflective and philosophic mood when he shed the
light of his little weasel eyes upon the reportorial presence. The
chunky little man had apparent
ly just arrived at the conclusion
that there might be glory but
certainly no honor in the ring,
and that as soon as he had ac
cumulated a sum sufficient for
the gratification of all his wishes
and earthly desires he would quit
the arena for the more lasting
Joys of mercantile pursuits.
"It's money that brings all us
fellows to the ring," said the Kid;
"that's what does it. As for
myself, just so soon as I get
enough money together the Kid;
t's what does it. As for
ilf. Just so soon as I get
gh money together I shall
buy out a cigar store or saloon
and quit."
It was not without some little
shame that the lightweight cham
pion acknowledged his lack of
business qualifications and his
utter Inability to save the vast
sums his skill and science brought him.
"Now my brother can keep his money," he explained, "but I
can't I have to spend it. There are my friends to treat, and my friends
whom I must loan to, and, oh, there's everything to spend and have
a good time."
The all around "good time" that Lavigne has had is marred by just
one little cloudâ the "good time" that he missed. The fighter tells the
tender little tale In a touching little way, that Is sure to bring tears to
the eyes of the entire Brewerymen's Union. "I saved $4000 once," said
the Kid, "and I had just got to feeling g*ood about it, when one morning
I got a letter from my brother, saying that the bank had failed and that
my entire savings were gone. What could I do?" thus philosophized the
Kid. "Oh. but gee! Think of all the beer I might have bought!
Twenty glasses of beer for fl, 80,000 glasses for $4000," and the lighter
smiled In a dim, reminiscent way without even considering what a great
thing arithmetic is.
His many successes have left the little fighter modest and cautious
and not without a dash of superstition. "Luck's got a lot to do with
fights," he said, "and I have never lost a fight,"
The Saginaw Kid comes from good o'.d French-Canadian stock, and
points with pride to other fighters In whose veins courses the inflamma
ble blood of the Gaul.
"Who would believe." said the fighter, "that Tom Ryan Is really
Thomas Lajeunnette, and Patsy Cardiff and Dick O'Brien are but the
noms de guerre of full-blooded Frenchmen?"
Lavlgnc expects the date of his coming contest to be settled within a
day or two, and then he will immediately go Into training to defeat the
Australian.

Extinction of the Blight.
Editor of The Callâ Pear Sir: In my card to
the press of the 23d inst. I called the atten
tion of the public in general and of the resi
dents of North Beach and the Buard of Super
visors in particular to the shameful and shock-
Ing state of Immorality that prevails in this
n of the city. I also showed that the
evil was increasing and I traced the source
of the supply to the area bounded by California,
Pine, Kearny and Dupont streets. Moreover, I
had in my possession a number of incontro
vertible proofs showing that a movement was
on foot to remove many of the fallen women
from that area and dump them at our doors.
I laid the case In a letter before the Chief of
Police, and while he did not acknowledge its
â¢ \-t I now find that he has been act
ing on its suggestions and conaequently I have
not been "ignored" by Mr. Lees.
Mr. Editor, in taking the step I have taken,
I was chiefly moved by a desire to save the
hundreds of children of this district from being
y slaughtered and to prevent shocking
sights from falling upon the eyes of our vir
tuous mothers and maidens. In my letter I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBEB 2C>, 1893.
â¢was in charge of the deck. The Glenericht
was close hauled on the port tack, and
she must have seen our lights for at least
thirty minutes before the accident oc
curred. It was h.r place to have kept out
of our way. and because she did not both
vessels wire nearly lost with all on board.
"As it is matters are bad enough. My
vessel is almost a wreck, and nothing
but her collision bulkheads saved her.
According to what the pilot tells m<- the
Gknericht is almost a wreck at Monte
video, and Captain Davies' wife is
drowned. I was knocked insensible by the
fall of the Glenericht'a mizzenmaÃt, and
by the time I regained consciousness the
two vessels were clear of each other.
"The men who came aboard my ship
from the Glenericht were able seamen
Carlson, Tingstrom, Young and Waters.
They got aboard aft and tell me that Mis.
Davit s was with them. They were not
sure but thought she fell between the
two vessels or else got back on the Glen
ericht. I hoped that the latter was the
case, and now y<>u tell me that Captain
Davies is satisfied that she is aboard my
vessel. It will be an awful blow for him,
poor fellow. One of our sailors, a man
named Clark, got aboard the Glenericht,
and I suppose he made Montevideo on her.
I was the worst injured man on my ship,
and Apprentice Windsor and First Mate
Flynn were severely cut. After getting
was careful to make no allusion to any church
or clergyman. Pruteetant or Catholic, -and I
grappled with the evil in itself fairly, square
ly and, as I believed, honorably. As far as
the press was concerned I have there rested
my case, but a lengthy article In to-day's Issue
of The Call, dealing with my letter, forces
me to reappear In print.
Let me stale here, Mr. Editor, that 1 wel
come In the main the article referred to, be
cause It goes to substantiate every one of my
arguments or assertions. The head and front
of my alleged offenae Is "my belief that the
evil should be Impounded and compressed. In
stead of diffused." I atill cling to this belief,
for the continuous impounding and compress
ing of a thing tends inevitably to Its destruc
tion. But the author of the letter In question
In order to show the falsity of my position
quotes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
â an example that is entirely on my side. When
God wished to stamp out the wickedness of
these cities did he disperse the inhabitants to
other citit'3 and towns? Certainly not. Hav
ordered the departure of Lot and his family
he burned out the evil and evil-doers on the
very spot where they had existed. If, then, the
example of God 1h to be followed, the evil
complained of In this city should be stamped
out on the spot where It has existed from time
Immemorial. I am far, however, from sug
gesting- for the work the agency of tire ur
sword.
The example of the trafficking- In the temple
Is most unhappily quoted, because there is no
parity in the cases, and I refuse to believe
that some of the statements connected there
with have come from any clergyman. The
buying and selling in the temple are stated
by the author to be a "kindred" crime with
the Immoralities committed in his neighbor
hood. This Is a fearful doctrine to lay down!
Buying and selling are perfectly lawful tran
sactions In themselves, and they could only
have been unlawful from being carried on In
a sacred plate, but immorality la essentially
sinful in itself and never admits of parity of
matter. When the writer likens buying and
selling to revolting carnal crimes he niakea
light of the latter and forfeits all claim to
public sympathy in his cause.
The writer asks the question: "Did he hesi
tate lest the miscreants, being driven out,
would occupy some other temple?" Let me
Inform the writer that this was the only temple
In Jerusalem, and that the trafficking and
scourging did not take place within it, but
only in its precincts.
The author of the letter admires my illus
tration of confining a fire within limits and
quenching It there or allowing It to burn itself
out, and yet. lllogically and impliedly, he main
tains that these women should be scattered
ovt-r the city for the eradication of the evil.
That "Immorality Is a necessary evil" no priest
will assert, and the clergyman that would hold
such a doctrine should be canonlcally de
graded.
Finally, Mr. Editor, let me re-define my po
sition. There are hundreds upon hundreds of
children attending the public schools, the con
vent school, the day home and the Sunday
schools of this flection of the city, and these
children are threatened with moral destruction.
There are also here thousands of adults, male
and female, threatened with an invasion of
women worse than that of any plague or epi
demic. Now in the front of these children and
adults I shall stand, and if the fnllen females
and their male companions that infest the lo
cality between Pine and California streets en
ter this parish It will be when I shall be over
powered in the struggle. T. CARAHER.

clear of the Glenericht we repaired dam
ages as well as possible and came on to
San Francisco, making as good time as
the ship Madagascar, which left Swan
sea the same day as we did and reached
port a few hours ago."
The Balmoral struck the Glenericht a
glancing blow amidship, almost cutting
her to the water's edge. The Balmoral
is badly stove on the starboard bow, and
on her starboard quarter. The cabin is
a complete wreck and the forward com
partment is full of water. The Glen
ericht's mizzen mast fell between the Bal
moral's mizzon and Jigger masts and
wrecked the running gear and standing
rigging. Topgallant masts and yards were
carried away, stanchions were broken,
bulwarks bent, bridges carried away, her
compass was broken and other damage
was done.
Captain Davies' cabled report of the dis
aster is as follows: "Was in collision
with the British ship Balmoral off Cape
Horn August 20. Balmoral struck us
amidship, but Glenericht not damaged
below the water line. One of Balmoral's
crew brought to Montevideo on Glenericht
and four of the Glenericht's sailors and
Captain Davies' wife are on the Balmoral,
which is only slightly damaged."
The Balmoral will be discharged and
will have to go on the drydock for a
general overhauling.
PROSECUTION IS OFF
ON ANOTHER TACK
DETECTIVE McVEY SEEKS FED
ERAL AID.
Tried to Secure Custody of Mrs. Bot
km Through an Infringement
of the Postal Laws.
Chief of Police Lees and Detective Mc-
Vey do not propose to have Mrs. Cor
delia Botkin tried in this State if there is
a possible loophole through which they
can escape the recent decision of Judge
Carroll Cook and his confreres of the
judiciary.
Yesterday they were closeted for over
an hour with Assistant United States Dis
trict Attorney Bert Schlesinger and In
spector Munroe of the Postal Department
in a discussion of sections 330 and 331 of
the postal laws. Section 330 provides that
if a Postmaster find a package in the
mails containing destructives or poisons
he shall take it out and destroy it, but
it does not make the depositing of such
packages a crime, and provides no pen
alty. Chief Lees was of the opinion, until
he had talked with Mr. Schlesinger, that
the section could be so construed that
Mrs. Botkin could be rearrested upon an
infringement of the poetal laws, and un
der such a charge be haled into the
confines of Delaware, where the minor
charge could be dismissed and the origi
nal charge of murder placed against her.
There would be no questions of Jurisdic
tion to bother under such circumstances
and she could be legally tried in the for
eign State.
Section 331 had no bearing on the case
whatever. It relates solely to the trans
mission through the mails of lottery tick
ets and advertising matter, and provides
that offenders of this class are triable
at either the point from which the mat
ter is sent or the point at which it Is
received. The chief and McVey argued
that the same law applied to other of
fenses, and desired to bring the matter
before the Federal court upon their show
ing, but as it was pointed out to them
that the clause provided only for lottery
offenders the matter was allowed to drop.
Thf defense will not argue the triabil
ity of Mrs. Botkin in this State when that
question comes up before Judge Carroll
Cook on Saturday. They will submit to
tho court that as their petition is for a
writ of habeas corpus the matter of this
State's Jurisdiction is not relevant. At
torney McGowan said yesterday that the
one question that could be settled by the
habeas corpus proceedings was the ques
tion of Mrs. Botkin's extradition into
Delaware, "and as that question has been
already settled there is no reason for fur
ther argument, so far as the defense Is
concerned.
Surrendered Himself.
School Director Thomas A. Burns, who
was indicted by the Grand Jury Monday
on a charge of fraud in connection with
the School Board lumber contracts, sur
rendered himself at the City Prison yes
terday morning. He was immediately re
leased on a $5000 bond accepted by Judge
Belcher.
Botwin. Was Acquitted.
J. Botwin. charged with having: crim
inally assaultrd Rosa Jacohson, a girl of
15 years, was acquitted by a jury in Judge
Cook's court yesterday.

AN OUTRAGE BY
DOG-CATCHERS ON
A BUSINESS MAN
Charles Mitchell Is
Clubbed.
HIS TERRIER WAS TAGGED
COWARDLY DEPUTIES PURSUED
BY AN INDIGNANT CROWD.
Two of the Buffians Have Been Ar
rested on a Charge of As
sault With a Deadly
Weapon.
Another high-handed outrage under
color of official authority was perpetrated
yesterday upon a respectable and Inof
fensive citizen by ruffianly deputies of the
Poundmasti-r. Charles Mitchell, proprie
tor of the M. & M. saloon at 231 Kearny
street, was walking: along Bush street,
near the corner of Kearny, with his fox
terrier Spider trotting along by his side,
when the Pound wagon drove up. Mr.
Mitchell's attention was called to their
presence by the yelping of his dog, which j
had been struck on the head by the hoop .
of the dog net thrown by the Pound men.
He at once seized the net and threw it
into the street, for his dog had a li
cense tag on his collar in plain view and (
was not subject to seizure. The three j
men at once jumped upon him and one of .
them struck him on the back of the head j
with a club and broke a blood vessel, j
which caused the wound to bleed profuse- j
ly. Mr. Mitchell, although dazed, did not
fall but defended himself as well as he j
could, whin- a big crowd gathered around j
and watched the men beat him. The ex- '
ecratlona of the bystanders alarmed the |
Pound bullies and they broke for the j
wagon, but Mitchell seized the horses by
the bridle and hung- on In order that he I
might detain his assailants and procure
their arrest. At this juncture the driver
of a dray came to the citizen's rescue â 
with a dray stake and pursued the now
trembling deputies down Hush street, fol
lowed by an Indignant crowd shouting
"Lynch them! Lynch them!"
Patrolman Kaskell of the California
street station came along and placed
Nicholas Robling, the driver of the Pound
wagon, and Deputy Poundkeeper Henry
Dan under arrest on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon. The third deputy
was allowed to take the wagon to the
Pound, and he will be arrested on the
same charge as soon a.s Mr. Mitchell is
able to appear in court.
Mr. Mitchell' b injuries were so serious
bis friends placed him in a hack
and took him to the Receiving Hospital,
where his scalp was sewed up by the'
physicians. They advised him to go home
and remain in bed for a few days, as
there were symptoms of a fractured j
skull. Mr. Mitchell was seen at his resl- â 
dence 515 Stockton street, and was found !
to be resting easily, although in great
pain In order to prove the genuineness
Of the tag on his dog's collar he produced
a receipt dated August 25, IS9B, and certl
fylng that Charles Mitchell of 231 Kearny i
street had that day paid to the License .
Collector the annual tax on the fox ter- !
rier Spider and had procured a tag for the
same the tag to be good until June 30, !
1599.

FLYPAPER WINDOW
CRACKERS AT WORK
FOUR STORES SOUTH OF MAR-
KET STREET VISITED.
A Grocery Clerk Took a Shot at Them,
but His Aim Was Not Steady
and He Missed.
The fly paper window crackers are at
work again, but this time they are tak
ing in the district south of Market street.
Four gTocery stores were visited during
the early hours of yesterday morning and
from the windows of thrte of them bottles
of liquor and other articles were stolen.
At the fourth place visited, the store cf
H. Hilberg, corner of Ninth and Brannan
streets, they met with a reception that
they did not anticipate. Hllberg's clerk
sleeps in the rear of the store and he was
awakened by the noise of the breaking
glass. He jumped out of bed and seeing
two men at the window, he grabbed his
revolver and fired at the men, who fled,
leaving the fly paper behind. The clerk's
aim was unsteady and he does not think
he hit one of the thieves, but he scared
them.
Last winter a number of groceries and
cigar stores in the "tenderloin district"
were visited by these window crackers.
Two or three of the gang were arrested
and were sent to the House of Correction,
but there are others. They paste the fly
paper on the window so as to deaden the
sound of the breaking glass, but it was
loud enough to waken Hilberg's clerk.
Special instructions have been issued
to all the policemen to keep a sharp look
out for these thieves, as they not only
steal what they can get but destroy wan
tonly valuable plate glass windows.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK ST( >CX MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â periodical settle
ment on the London Stock Exchange to-day de
veloped a very anxious state of feeling- in the
financial markets, due to the adverse conditions
of the money market and the threatening po
litical outlook. The very high loaning- rates
precipitated quite an active liquidation and a
squeeze in money rates. The uneasiness in
London was reflected on other markets in Eu
rope and there was a general rise in the rates
of exchange on London and in the discount
rates at all Continental centers. British con
sols dropped a full point and all other securi
ties, including American railroads, showed vio
lent declines. The announcement of the post
ponement of the British Cabinet meeting
brought some relief and the bears were actively
covering in London about the time the stock
market in New York opened. There were very
large and supporting orders in the market here
at the opening, bo that the decline in prices at
that time on account of the selling for Lon
don account was trifling and was soon over
come. Selling for London account was in
fact a small factor, and before the arbitrage
trading was concluded for the day London
turned buyer and took a fair amount of stocks
in this market. Consols there recorded almost
a full recovery and the upward movement in
other departments was almost as violent. Re
lieved from that depressing influence prices here
mounted upward quite easily, the short con
tracts put out in yesterday's market being gen
erally covered and the large bull operators who
led last week's buying resuming the movement
with great apparent confidence. The trading
was dull in the' latter part of the day, but
prices were firmly held and closed at about the
beet. Net gains in many instances reached a
point or over, the prices entirely retrieving
yesterday's large decline. Tobacco was fu
riously active all day and covered an extreme
range over several points. The price was low
ered In the morning on the announcement of
the incorporation of a new tobacco company
with a large capital. But traders distrusted
the first interpretation of this company and
the price was run up on very large transac
tions which were large at the prices. Sugar
was held firmly In sympathy with Tobacco.
Pullman sold off 6 points on the Illinois Judi
cial decision holding that the company's large
real estate ownership Involved a violation of
the charter. The stock recovered nearly 4
points.
The sterling exchange market was an ac
curate barometer of the course of affairs In
London. Demand sterling made an upward
bound of Vz during the early excitement In Lon
don and while stocks were still being sold here
for London account, but with the latter relief
of the nervous tension in London, with some
buying here for London account, demand ster
ling suddenly dropped a full cent, closing weak.
Notwithstanding this violent oscillation in the
price of credits on London there was not a
ripple In the local money market, which contin
ued quiet and easy.
There was a yielding in the early price for
bonds, but an upward movement later on ac
tive demand. Total sales were $2,000,000.
United States s's coupon advanced % and old
4's coupon Vi in the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 340,435
shares, including: Atchison preferred, 34,076;
Burlington, 10,967; Denver and Rio Grande,
4480; Louisville and Nashville, 3070; Northern

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 25.â English consols were
again lower at the start and the Liverpool
wheat market opened excitedly higher. The
logical result of that by itself should have been
a wild scramble for wheat here and a much
more material rise in prices than occurred the
day before. Wheat speculators had, however,
to take account of many things that were not
paraded in view of the multitude, and it was
due to some of those obscure Influences that a
severe decline In prices that inaugurated the
day's business was not so Illogical as appeared
upon the surface. Many of I â  active trad
ers have loaded themselves recently with wheat
at what they would consider a dangerously
high figure if peace were assured. People who
had bought heavily because they thought war
was imminent and had no use for
the wheat In the other event lis
tened to whisperings of a probable peaceful
settlement of the Kashoda difficulty and has
tened to rid themselves of their war-priced
wheat. English consols later in the day re
covered their early decline. This was hailed
as the harbinger of peace and helped to bring
out more kng wheat and even some from the
more careful short sellers. The weak feeling
that had prevailed was arrested for a time by
a report from New York that 130 boatloads of
wheat had been sold for export. The close was
at B&%&tS%C for December, a loss of 2c.
("urn was easy and would of its own volition
have remained immovable, but was forced to
adopt a downward course. The result of lower
prices for carriage and a decline In price of the
grain wbh the taking of quite a heavy amount
for export. Receipts were moderate â 407 cars.
The market firmed up near the close on country
purchases.
Oats ruled weak, with the selling of long
property by a prominent scalper the feature.
The decline was also assisted by the weakness
of wheat and corn. May closed VÂ»@%c lower.
Heavy grain markets and a further drop in
the price of hogs, together with lack of busi
ness, caused a concession in the provision mar
ket. Trade was narrow. Pork declined 12Hc

Clara Kluge - Sutro
Opens Her Fight.
AN IMPORTANT PETITION
SEEKS TO BE APPOINTED HER
CHILDREN'S GUARDIAN.
Wants to Be in a Position to Take All
the Necessary Legal
Steps in Their
Behalf.
The battle for the millions of the late
Adolph Sutro was opened In earnest yes
terday. Mrs. Clara Kluge-Sutro, who
claims to be his contract widow, struck
the first blow in the fight she proposes
to wage for a share of the vast estate.
Through her attorney, ex-Jutstiee Van R.
Paterson, she filed a petition in the Pro
bate Court asking that she be appointed
guardian of her two children, aged 7 and
6 years respectively, whom she has called
during the oeriod of their young lives
Adolph Newton Sutro and Adolphlne
Charlotte Sutro.
In the petition Mrs. Kluge-Sutro avers
that the children named are the offspring
of herself and Adolph Sutro; that they
have large property Interests within the
Jurisdiction of the court and in conse
quence It is necessary that a guardian
should be appointed to care for their es
tates. As their mother she prays for this
privilege. The children. It is said, through
a conveyance made by Sutro. when he
â¢was supporting them and their mother
in the home he built for their occupa
tion at Stelner and Clay streets, are at
present possessed of block No. 219. out-
Sidfl lands, which is valued at about $20,W0.
Through the filing of the petition it is
manifest that Mrs. Kluge-Sutro intends
In the near future to enter a contest to
the will of the deceased millionaire, if not
Â«n her own behalf on behalf of the chil
dren. She now seeks to be appointed their
legal custodian that she may carry her
Intention into effect. The petitioner seeks
to prove that she married Adolph Sutro
by contract after the dÂ«>ath of his first
wife, Leah. Should she fail in her efforts
ablish this allegation she hopes to
establish beyond the peradventure of a
doubt that her children are those of
Sutrn, and thereby gain for them a share
of the rich estate.
ANOTHER VICTIM FOR
THE NARROW GAUGE
ORTHMAK MILLER KILLED ON
WEBSTER STREET.
The Accident Was on the Curve From
the New Harrison-Street
Bridge.
OAKLAND. Oct. 25.â Orthmar Miller, j
proprietor pi the Contra Costa Pickle
Works, was struck by the 7:15 o'clock j
narrow gauge local from the Alameda j
mole to-night at the curve on Webster
street, near First. He was thrown about j
fifteen feet and died fifteen minutes later !
at the Receiving Hospital. Dr. Strat- j
ton. who examined the body, found the I
base of the skull fractured, also a frac- |
ture of the collar bone and two broken
ribs. The dead man resided at 305 Third
street near Harrison, and from all ac- ;
counts was out for an evening walk. \
From First street ho was walking north {
on the east side of Webster street at a
point where the narrow gauge tracks j
cross the cement sidewalk after cutting |
through a vacant lot, in its course from i
the new Harrison street bridge to con- !
nect with the tracks on Webster street, ]
forming what some are wont to call an- i
other death curve in Oakland. '
An eye witness, whose name could not
bÂ« learned, states that Miller was walk-
Ing along, apparently meditating, and
though the bell of locomotive No. 23 was
ringing, the whistle sounding an aJarm
of warning was not blown until after
the man was struck. Andrew Connor,
the flagman, signaled the train at the
First street crossing only about fifteen
feet away, but says he does not recollect
whether the whistle was sounded.
Coroner Baldwin has taken the remains
to the Morgue, and an inquest will be
held to-morrow night.
Deceased was an old resident, a native
of Switzerland, aged 65 years. He was
a prominent member of several lodges,
among them Vorvaerts Lodge \ No. 313.

LIPKA SAYS HE
IS A VICTIM
OF JEALOUSY
Employs a Lady to
Fool Detectives.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 25.
There will be a lively contest for the de
cree of divorce between EJkan M. Lipka
and his wife, who has brought the suit.
For some time the affairs of the family
have been matters of common report, but
owing to the large property interests in
volved nu actual separation took place till
a few weeks ago.
Lipka says he Is the victim of a con
y on the part of his enemies. "Last
night 1 knew that my movements were
being watched, so I thought I would put
up a trick to test my idea," said Llpku.
"1 indui-ed a lady friend to go to my
room. Then she stole quietly away. -It
wan all v Joke t" f'Â»>i the detectives. Late
In the night I went to my room alone,
ami about 3 o'clock in the morning some
v<-i)]>jc called on me. 1 suspected who
they were, and seizing my pistol I told
them to go away. Then they called for
the police and raised a disturbance. I
had Sergeant Peterson bring my wife into
the room just to satisfy hi-r i was alone.
My wife has been very jealous of me and
that is the cause of all my trouble. My
wife is after my property, but 1 gueM I'll
have some of her money before this thing
is over."
Mrs. Lipka has been gathering proof for
some time and says her position is beyond
dispute. "I have assisted my husband in
business for seventeen years," she says,
"and now I want a share of the property.
He baa done me a great injustice, and I
propose now to let the whole affair be
aired in court."
About a month ago Mr. and Mrs. Lipka
were passing along Broadway late one
night and the husband was using very
abusive language. Police Officer Scanlan
heard the abuse and threatened Lipka
with arrest unless he behaved himself on
the street. Lipka replied very dramatic
ally that he had "something in his heart"
that the officer did not understand. Scan
lan told him that unless his vile language
1 at once he would take him to jail.
Lipka subsided at once.

SAVED A COLONEL'S LIFE.
PRIVATE VJISSJIR Rescues a Spanish Officer
From .Mad Insurgents and Re
ceives a .Medal. I
OF THE many brave heroes who returned from Manila on the Rio
Janeiro, none have a more interesting story to tell and none tell, it
more modestly than does Private Rufus Pierce Vaasar, who has come
back with a Mauser bullet in his right thigh and a medal for brav
ery, which, by the way, he is too modest to wear. Vassar is well known
here. He is from New York, and is the grandson of the man who found
ed Vassar College, which bears his name. Young Vassar has re
sided here for about two years, and during the racing season he is a
familiar figure about the racetracks. When the war broke out he re
signed the pleasures of a life made eatry by comfortable remittances from
home, and enlisted in the Twenty-third Infantry. He went with his regi
ment to Manila.
It so happened that while doing police duty in the old town of Maryla,
on September 8, In one of the obscure streets. Vassar's attention was
attracted by cries for help. He ran to the spot whence the cries
came and found a crowd of natives surrounding a Spanish officer. They
had set upon the officer with knives and it was apparent that they were go
ing to make short work ot him, when Vassar fixed his bayonet, and with
out a moment's hesitation charged into the crowd. They scattered, but one
of them shot the young soldier with a Mauser carbine, the bullet taking
effect in his right thigh. As soon as he had been shot Vassar fell to the
ground and the natives ran. The noise of the shot attracted the relief
guard, who came to the assistance of the young soldier. But for Vassar's
interference the Spanish officer would have been murdered.
In recognition of Vassar's bravery and out of gratitude for saving his
life the officer, who was Colonel Garcia of the Seventy-third Spanish regi
ment, presented the young soldier with a medal. This is the keepsake that
Vassar has brought back with him, and which he will treasure In the
years to come.

AVARILA HESS
IS TOO YOUNG
TO BE A WIFE
Peculiar Sequel to an
Alleged Elopement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Oct. 25.
Edward D. Green and Avarlla Hess of
San Francisco applied for a marriage li
cense at County Clerk Jordan's office yes
terday afternoon, but returned home dis
appointed. The would-be bride gave her
age as 14. while the law requires that she
must be 15 years of age in order to marry,
notwithstanding the consent of parents.
Miss Hess' mother was present and
though they consulted the District Ator
ney no license was issued.
What is still more interesting is the
fact that it is stated that Miss Hess
eluped from Los lianos two weeks ago
with a young man named Wolfe. Yester
day morning she arrived in San Francisco
on" the steamer Walla Walla from Beattle
and was met by her mother and an older
The girl claims that she had no inten
tion of eloping, but that while visiting a
friend she met Wolfe, who is employed in
a lodging house on Market street. San
Francisco It was shortly thereafter that
she and a stranger left for Seattle, where
they were found in a lodging house by
the' police. The man escaped, but Miss
Hess volunteered to return to her home.
Nothing could be learned concerning the
antecedents of Green, who applied for the
marriage license, and his identity is
rather a mystery. He is supposed to be
either the fellow who accompanied her to
Seattle, or Wolfe under an assumed
name. ,
AGED WIDOW'S WOES.
Mrs. George Voges of Alameda Parts
With All Her Possessions.
ALA.MKDA.Oct. 25.â Mrs. George Voges,
old and an Invalid widow of a once re
spected citizen of Alameda, will be left
penniless and a charge upon the commun
ity, unless the law intervenes and protects
her from those who have taken advan
tage of her weakness of mind, and by
various methods persuaded the old lady
to give them all she had.
That she has parted with her all was
developed to-day In Justice Morris' court
when an attempt was made by a credi
tor to locate some money she was sup
posed to have received from the sale of
her household furniture.
Mrs. Jennie Woodworth of Eagle avenue
claimed to hold a bill of sale to the dis
puted property and she was brought Into
court. It was shown that a few months
ago she secured Mrs. Voges' piano and
moved it away to her own home. Later
much of Mrs. Voges' furniture went the
same way. The day before the remainder
was to be sold at auction, Mrs. Wood
worth secured a bill of sale to all that
was left, and took in the proceeds of the
Trie auctioneer states that the property
brought in the neighborhood of $200. Mrs.
â Woodworth swore that but $70 was real
ized which amount she paid to Mrs.
Voges, after the old lady's friends began
to interest themselves in her case.
Attorney R. B. Tappan has volunteered
to see that Mrs. Voges gets her rights.
He will take steps to have a guardian ap
pointed for her. and an effort will be made
to have the German Aid Society care for
her Mrs. Voges suffered a stroke of par
alysis some months ago and since then
her reason has been affected.
In all Mrs Woodworth has possession
of property belonging to the unfortunate
woman valued at about $600. She claims
it was given her to pay for her services
as a servant girl, but it appears that she
was in Mrs. Voges' employ but three or
four months. .
The Alameda authorities will investigate
the case thoroughly.

student at the Stanford University, has
dropped out of sight in Alameda as com

make away with himself. V*""
Goetz came from Palo Alto Saturday to
visit Mrs. A. H. Clark of 1417 Sherman
street. He arrived at her home in the
evening. They chatted over university
affairs and during the conversation Goetz
displayed a valuable gold watch that had
been presented to htm. He placed the
watcn, a silk handkerchief and a return
ticket to Palo Alto on the table. Suddenly
he remarked tnat he had an appointment
with a man at Park street and left the
house This was about 11 o'clock Satur
day night. From that time nothing has
been heard of the missing man. When

Mrs ctark Bays the leaving of the watch
and ticket was purely an accident on
Goetz' ; part She does not think he has

lieve that he has met with foul play. He

with him. although there is no definite
information on this point.

a pink and white four-in-hand necktie.
He was a young man of exemplary
habits. His only known relative is a
brother, who is at present in Manila.

LAVIGNE AND TRACEY.
The Clever and Hard-Hitting Pugil-
ists Will Doubtless Sign
Articles To-Day.
Billy Lavigne, acting for his brother,
George Lavigne, met the officers of the
National Club at the Baldwin Hotel last
evening to arrange a twenty-round con
test between the "kid" and Tom Tracey,
the clever Australian exponent of the
game known as fisticuffs.
Al Smith, acting manager for Tracey,
was present, and when Mr. Groom of the
National Club called the meeting to or
der, he drew up articles of agreement,
but Lavigne objected to the percentage
clause of 60 per cent. He held out for 65
per cent, which the club positively re
fused to give. The percentage question
was argued at length, but Lavigne would
not concede an inch until he had had a
conference with his brother, who was not
present.
A vain attempt was made to find the
pugilist. Al Smith, on behalf of Tracey.
v.-as seemingly willing to Mgn for 60 per
cent, but as Tracey"s prospective oppo
nent was not present nothing was done j
in the way of consummating a match.
Doubtless the contestants and their re- |
spective managers wIH meet this after
noon and settle on the question of per- j
centage. which appears to be the only j
clause in the agreement that will prevent |
the signing of articles between two of the j
most expert exponents of the fistic game
at present in this country.
Two-fifths of the companies promoted
yearly in England fail.

BIG BILL LANGE DRIFTS
IN FROM THE WINDY CITY
BILL LANGE has made another home run. This time, however the
score was not made on the diamond. It was simply a running of the
bases from the Windy City to No. 1 Spruce street, where Willie re
sides with his parents. t
Yesterday afternoon between the hours of 4 and a o clocK tne i.,ange
boy was on exhibition alone the
line from Powell and Market
streets to Sutter and Kearny. It
was the same old story of hand
shaking and hat-raising that has
punctuated the career of the
world's famous center fielder or
the Chicago baseball team since
he has been classed among the top
notchers.
Frobably there is no better known
or more popular professional man
than Bill Lange before the public.
He is equally at home on Michigan
avenue, Chicago; Broadway. New
York, or Kearny and Market
streets, San Francisco. On these
three thoroughfares he is known to
all. and when he cavorts along
either he generally holds the center
of the stage, with a full calcium
and tumultuous applause.
Of late there has been a great
deal of talk about "Bill's 11 resign
ing from the Chicago Club to Join
the New York Giants. He was said
to be suffering from a "Charley horse" and other troubles of the lower
limbs. His word and appearance belie these idle rumors. He will remain
the bright, particular feature of the Windy City team, and if he has a
"Charley horse" he Is not aware of the fact. Lange's trouble with
Burns, the new manager of the Chicago team, was the result of his friend
ship for "Pop" Anson, who forsook the Lake team for the great metropolis.
It is all fixed up now and "Bill" will be, as ever, the white-haired boy of
the pork packers' pride.
In addition to hie mountainous physique and smile of sunshine Lange
has returned with a wardrobe that defies competition. For two weeks pre
vious to his forsaking Chicago he had a force of tailors, hatters and boot
makersâyou always say boot-making in the Eastâ working day and night,
building#iim an outfit that will make J. Waldie Kirk look like 30 cents,
in a fog. *
He carries twenty-two vests, twenty-eight pairs of trousers, ten suits,
three overcoats, and the sum total of his shirts and neckwear would take
up too much space to tell.
Yesterday he appeared in a symphony of brown. To-morrow he will
blow along the line clad in a conceit in blu<-. Saturday he promises to
fease the multitude with an effect in gray. It took two men four hours to
count his socks, which are in all shades and paterns ranging from the cus
tomary close-spun silk to the more delicate open-worked lace.
When Mr. Lange bids adieu now he says "good night." with a deter
mined, decided and derisive accent on the "night." the same being a bit of
delicate pcarcasm much affected by the smart set of the East. On Sunday
"Bill" will be seen "meandering over the Presidio golf links, with a brace
of "Caddy" boys carrying his "irons." When he plays golf he always
assumes a decided Scotch accent and says, "Hoot! now," every time he
soaks the ball.
He is not decided whether he will take part in any of the local ball
g-ames during his stay here. Next week he will be given a formal reception
and dinner by an exclusive and secret club of which he Is a shining light.

A HOME FOR GIRLS.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson Has a Project
for Aiding Worthy Toilers.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson, pastor of How
ard street Methodist Church, is about to
open a home where working girls of slen
der means can enjoy all the comforts of
a home at small expense, without being
bound by irksome rules or prisonlike n?g
lons. In 1593 he opened a similar
home in New York City, which has since
become one of the great institutions of
that place. It will be on a common
sense basis, the only recommendation re
quired being character and industry, and
it will be entirely independent so far as
or religious belief is concerned.
Simply a home for the homeless, whose
means are limited.
A few donations have already been re
ceived, but more an 1 needed before the
institution can be placed on a self-sup
portlng basis. One gentleman has prom
ised $lv a month for rent and $100 addi
tional to go toward expenses of opening,
and .i. lady has promised $15 per month
and made a donation of $20. Subscrip
tions will be received by Miss Alice Mor
rison. 618 Hyde street, or Rev. John A.
B. Wilson. 643 Howard street.

Sons' Hall, where it is being held, Is
crowded nightly by people from all parts
of the city who visit it to enjoy the many
intei eating entertainments rendered un
der the direction of the ladies in charge
of the various booths.
The celebrated jig dancers, O'Connor
and Kelleher, were the chief attraction
last evening, and by general request will
again appear Friday evening. With
them will also appear the young lady
dancers who performed successfully with
them at the Irish Fair given recently at
tin- Mechanics' Pavilion.
The fair will continue until next Mon
day night, when the various articles will
be either raffled or s,>ki at auction.
Outwitted the Chinamen.
Sergeant McManus and posse raided a

Chinese, who made an effort to get rid
of thÂ«ir evidence against them. Usually
the beans are thrown down a waste pipe.
The police knowing of this before mak

BAD BREAK OF
PHELAN AND HIS
FOOL DEFENDER
A Malicious Attack on Creswell
Shows the Mayor's In=*
competency.
Assertions and Claims That Are Based on fflis=
statements and Without Foonda=
tion in Fact.
"Hefting" Mayor Phelan Is a living ex
emplification of the fact tliat "whom the
gods would destroy they first make mad."
With failure and political ruin staring
j him in the faceâ driven to desperation by
! his dire distressâ made mad before de
struction. Phelan, through the columns of
his Subsidized Bulletin, has attempted to
' build himself up by beating down an
honorable and respected citizen.
In an article of almost two columns,
filled with fulsome laudation, it is at
tempted to make the "hefting" Mayor
almost a demigod and the paragon of all
excellence. But in order to do this It
was found necessary to make a malicious
and slanderous attack on ex-City and
! County Attorney Creswell. This article
1 makes the specific statement that Brod
erick and Creswell were unfavorable to
the city's interests and opposed the char
i ter election. . .
Phelan, or whoever wrote the story for
! him evidently overlooked the fact that
! the records of the matter are in exist
! ence. Those records show that Creswell
i amended Phelan's motion as to the time
! of holding the election and this amend-
I ment carried. The entire Board of Elec
i tion Commissioners voted for the charter
i election. The statement in the Bulletin
! is false in detail and in general, and 13
i without the slightest foundation in fact.
Notwithstanding the fact that the roof
' of the New City Hall is one of the best
in the country and has been ao proven,
1 and notwithstanding the further fact
that Phelan was proven ill-advised
and ignorant when he began his fight on
: the roof, which, for some unexplained
reason, he fought with an animosity that
: seemed born of personal feeling, he haa
i the effrontery to lay claim to having it
; painted to keep it from leaking. Tha
paragraph in the remarkable article in
i the Subsidized Bulletin relating to the
! roof is a tissue of falsehoods from be
' ginning to end, as the records of the
i meetings of the City Hall Commissioners
', plainly show.
The reports covering the few meetings
I of the Commissioners when the roof was
I under discussion make very interesting
reading. The "posing" Mayor was not
satisfied with the fact that Dr. D. K.
Mellis, Professor Thomas Price and F. T.
Shea had thoroughly examined the ro<\f
I and pronounced it perfect, but he went
I forth and picked up Lieutenant C. L. Pot
i ter, of the United States army engineer
i corps, and Fred H. Ricken, and got them
, to make an examination.
When the Commissioners remembered
' that Potter was the same man who made
a report that caused the Examiner, Pbe
lan's other organ, to demand the indict
WITNESSES ARE LIMITED
TO TWO-BIT MEALS
JUDGE GREENE OPPOSED TO
UNDUE HIGH LIVING.
Particularly When the Accused,
Adolph Silva, Is Slowly Dying
at the Alameda County
Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 .Broadway. Oct. 25.
"We don't keep a high-priced boarding
house here," said Superior Judge Greene
this afternoon in stentorian tones, ad
dressing Jesus Goodfell. a witness in the
retrial of Adolph Silva, who was convict
ed last June on a charge of grand lar
ceny in having stolen several head of
cattle from H. N. Christensen.
The particular remark above quoted
was called forth while Judge Greene was
fixing upon and doling out the witness
fees for the day's attendance. Many of
the witnesses hailed from Uivermore and
Antloch, and of course witnesses attend
ing criminal trials are allowed their fare
and necessary expenses. In summing up
Jesus Goodfell's expenses Judge Greene
allowed for the fare and two meals at &
cents each.
"That makes $3 40," remarked his
Honor. Â T , Â
"I do not eat 25-cent meals, Mr. Judge,
replied the witness. My dinner costs me
U Â°" ( it nt does. eh?" retorted his Honor.
"Well, that's too much, and we don t keep
a high-priced boarding house here.
Thomas Shine, the next witness, came
all the way from Antioch. He was al
lowed $5. but this also included only 2o
cent meals, and he. too, had unfortunate
ly managed to drop into the wrong rea-
But no argument would be listened to
by his Honor ani the witnesses left the
courtroom much exercised and dis
gruntled. Next time they will bring their
lunches probably. .
Silva. the accused, has been in the
County Jail ever since February 26 1897.
Life behind the bars is hastening his
death He is suffering from consumption
in its advanced stages, and for months
has been under treatment by Dr. Porter.
Certain it is tnat he has but a short whi c
to live, and the ultimate outcome of his
trial does not seem to bother him to any
great extent.

ment of the Park Commissioners because
of a discrepancy of 12,000 cubic yards of
cement in a bridge, wherein it was af
terward proven that Potter had simply
written himself down an ass, no further
attention was paid to the report. Mr.
Shea, however, in his report, devoted a
little attention to Potter, and excoriated
him with such galling sarcasm that the
Mayor begged as a special favor that it
be "eliminated from the report, and ad
mitted that he had been misinformed.
Potter and Ricken condemned the use
of sea beach gravel, and said that the
salt in It would ruin it in a very short
time. When Professor Price made an
analysis of the cement he found two
pounds of salt in two and a half tons
of material, and it was conclusively
shown that in all parts of the city where
this same cement had been used it was
stronger and better than elsewhere.
Phelan lays claim to having compelled
the use of bituminous paint "to protect
the roof." He knows, as does every other
member of the board, that the use of this
paint was suggested by both Dr. Mellis
and Mr. Shea before Phelan was an offi
cial of the city, and he further knows
that, when he trumpeted through the
newspapers that Dr. Mellis had indorsed
his (Phelan's) idea, Dr. Mellis wrote him
a letter denouncing his assumption in
unmeasured terms.
But Phelan was not man enough to
admit his error, and while he admitted
to the board that he had been misin
formed regarding the roof, he, in a speech
at Saratoga Hall, a few evenings ago,
reiterated his charges and absurd claims
of having saved the roof.
Phelan further says in his article that
he "endeavored to effect improvements
around the City Hall, but was outvoted
by Broderick and Creswell." According
to the records the only "improvement"
Phelan ever suggested was the building
of an elaborate Turkish kiosk for a cigar
stand at the junction of the main corri
dor and the side corridor running in front
of the Mayor's office. This would have
'cost about $500, and the Commissioners
felt that it would be a useless expense
and would simply be a little more political
pap, and they declined to make the "im
provement."
Phelan is as unfortunate in the selec
tion of his advisors and defenders as in
his topics, for between the imbecile
mouthings of the Subsidized Ttulletln and
Venal Examiner his pretended reputation
is being cast to the winds, and the City
Hall roof, which seems to be his especial
aversion, has proven so strong that not
a leak has occurred in the entire two
and a half acres, and the only effect of
the dropping of the heavy iron ball dur
ing the earthquake was to make a slight
dent in the concrete, while the ball waa
cracked.

E. L. FITZGERALD ACCUSED OF
FRAUD, FORGERY AND THEFT
The "Hefting" Mayor's Pro=
tege Is Pilloried by His
Former Associates.
Phelan's Candidate for Public Ad=
ministrator Charged With Mai
feasance===Miller's Wrongs.
The Call, In its purpose to subserve the
best interests of San Francisco, accepts
the duty of exposing another rascal to
public scorn. Edward L. Fitzgerald is
the Democratic nominee for the position
of Public Administrator, a trust more
sacred than any other in the gift of the
people of this city. The estates of the
dead, the inheritances of helpless women
and children are, under frequent condi
tions, absolutely at the command of the
Public Administrator. In more tnan airy
other public trust personal honor con
stitutes In this Instance a fitness for office.
The Call feels it a duty. Therefore. To
inform the public whaut manner of man is
E. L. Fitzgerald.
This aspirant for public favor and con
fidence is accused of theft. He is charged
with forgery. He is held up to public
condemnation as a -violator of his oath
and the betrayer of his friends. He is
pilloried as one base enough to dishonor
his private obligations, and then he asks
the tribute of public confidence. He is ac
cused of having used a public office to
nil his purse, and now he asks another
opportunity to possess the property of
thoÃe that death makes helpless.
The Call has neither the wish nor the
necessity to present anything but the
facts.
Edward L. Fitzg-erald swore to a false
hood before the registration officers of
this city. For years he maintained a dis
creditable alliance with Ole C Vlnzent
In a voting contest at the Midwinter Fair
this aspirant for favor betrayed his
friends in his own county for a consid
eration. He is charged with having sto
len the property of a friend that trusted
to his honesty. He is accused of having
duped one of his employes in the Labor
Bureau to sign a voucher for money that
the employe protests he jnever received
This is the arraignment of the maii
who. through the courtesy of Mayor Phe
lan and his committee of one hundred
asks the public of San Francisco to give
him control of the estates of the dead
False in his obligations to the living he
demands the people of this city to be
lieve that he will be true to those of
the dead.
No more serious allegation has been
made against E. L. Fitzgerald than that
preferred by E. J. Stewart, who is now
connected with the Laymance Real Estate
Agency of Oakland. Mr. Stewart de
clares that Fitzgerald used him as an in
strument with which to obtain dishonest
money from the State. Stewart charges
that as a public officer Fitzgerald took a
STEWART'S ARRAIGNMENT OF
E. L. FITZGERALD.
E. J. Stewart, who is associated with the Laymance
Real Estate Company of Oakland, was interviewed last night
in reference to a voucher dated June 30, 1896, against the
State Labor Bureau for services performed during the
months of May and June, 1896, amounting to $95. He ex
plained the transaction as follows:
"I was appointed to a position in the San Francisco
Mint on May 7, 1896, and performed no services whatever
for the State Labor Bureau after that date. Before I re
ceived my appointment in the Mint I was out of employ
ment, and E. L. Fitzgerald, Labor Commissioner, sent for
me and informed me that he could give me temporary em
ployment in his department and that the pay would not be
much, but would assist in paying expenses until I received
my appointment in the Mint.
"I accepted the offer and engaged in gathering some
statistics for the State Labor Bureau. During the time I
was employed by Mr. Fitzgerald he advanced me money for
expenses in sums of $1 and $2 at a time, but not to exceed,
all told, $20. After I received my appointment to a posi
tion in the Mint Mr. Fitzgerald sent for me. and as I came
into his office he left me in the presence of Edward M.Greene,
his deputy. Mr. Greene had a number of vouchers on the
desk and he requested me to sign a voucher for the services
performed by me. Mr. Greene's actions indicated to me that
he was trying to conceal from me the amount of money for
which I was signing, but while I was signing my name to the
voucher I noticed that the amount was for $95. Of this
amount I am prepared to say that I received no part of it ex
cept, as I before stated, small sums at different times, but not
to exceed $20.
"I am positive that I performed no services for the State
Labor Bureau after my appointment to the Mint, which was
on May 7, 1896. lam positive that C. L. Dam, the Dep
uty Labor Commissioner, wa s not present when I signed the
voucher, therefore it was utterly impossible for him to have
sworn me as is indicated by the voucher you have just
shown me. The voucher you have just shown me reads:
For extra work for the months of May and June at $47 50
per month. When I went to wor k f o r tne bureau there was
no stipulated amount per mo n th that I was to receive, and I
am certain I did not work ttreeh ree weeks all told. There is
one thing I am positive about, and that is I did not receive
the amount that I was requested to sign for, namely, $95.
{Signed),
false oath to obtain $95. These are serious
allegations and the proof of them The
Call presents this morning.
Stewart was a friend of Fitzgerald in
IM"'. when the Democratic nominee for
Public Administrator was in charge of the
Labor Bureau. Stewart needed work and
Fitzgerald played upon his necessities.
The Labor Commissioner informed his
friend that he could give employment.
Knit the remuneration would be small.
Stewart accepted the terms. He was seek
ing a place in the Mint and realized that
even a little money would serve his needs
until something better was obtained.
He now says that Fitzgerald used him
to make a dishonest demand on the State
for $9f). There is a record in the office of
the State Controller that the money was
actually paid.
There is a certification by E. L. Fitz
gerald that Stewart received it. C.
L. Dam, the deputy of Fitzgerald, placed
his signature to an assertion that he had
placed Stewart under oath when the
voucher for the money was signed. These
facts are matters of record. Fitzgerald
did, beyond question, swear before the
State Board of Examiners that Stewart
had rendered certain services during the
months of May and June. 1596.
On the other hand Stewart swears that
he rendered no services, except for a few
days, and that he received not one cent
of "the |96 paid by the State to E. L. Fitz
gerald. Mr. Stewart says that Fitzgerald
employed him in the Labor Bureau for a
period' of three weeks to collect and tabu
late statistics. When the employment
was given there was no stipulation in
reference to salary. Stewart says Fitz
gerald gave him for his work not more
than $$0 in sums of one and two dollars at
various times.
But this is not the most serious allega
tion mado by Stewart against the aspir
ant for Public Administrator. The real
estate man positively asserts that he ren
dered no service to the Labor Bureau af
ter May 7. 1896. when he obtained employ
ment at the Mint. The records show that
E. L. Fitzgerald gave his sworn indorse
ment to a claim that Stewart was em
ployed in the Labor Bureau for the
months of May and June, 1896. The State
paid $95 to E. L. Fitzgerald for that ser
vice that was never rendered.
On June 30, 1896. Stewart signed a
voucher for $95. He declares that E. M.
Greene, a Deputy Labor Commissioner, so
held the voucher that the sum signed for
could not distinctly be seen. Stewart
succeeded, however. In seeing that the
sum was greater than he had earned or
that he had received from Fitzgerald.
Stewart subsequently confided the details
of the transaction to his friends through
whom the facts were communicated to
The Call. When confronted with the rec
ord Stewart admitted the truth of the af

fair and explained the incidents that led
up to it.
In doing so he recalled another circum
stance of moment. He declares positively
that C. L. Dam never placed him under
oath and was not even in the room when
the voucher was signed. These facts, in
all their severity, are given to the public
for its consideration.
It has been shown before that Mr. Fitz
gerald has no conception of the solemnity
of an oath. On two occasions during the
past year he has made affidavit before
deputies in the office of Registrar \V. J.
Biggy that he has resided in this city
five years.
In 1896 he made an affidavit, now on file
in the County Clerk's office of Alameda,
stating his place of residence to be Berke
ley. The directory of the same year gives
his address as Berkeley.
He has been the associate of one Ole C.
Vinzent in many disreputable transac
tions. During the Midwinter Fair Vinzent
was in charge of the Examiner booth in
which voting was conducted for a gold
cup to be awarded the county securing
the most votes. Toward the close of the
contest it was found that votes, once cast
for Alameda County, were stolen and
were then cast for Solano County. Mr.
Fitzgerald might tell who the messenger
was who carried the ballots to the repre
sentative of Solano County. The latter
had a residence on Adeline street, Oak
land, and when in this city registered at
the Grand Hotel.
Upon the death of Miss Valeria Hicke
thier of Oaklanad. in 1895, a joint note
signed by E. L. Fitzgerald and Ole C.
Vinzent for $40 was found among her ef

WILLIAM EDE HAS
BREATHED HIS LAST
Body Will Be Cremated at I. O. O. F.
Cemetery To-Morrow Afternoon.
Is Now Lying at Masonic
Temple.
Captain William Ede, the well known
millionaire street contractor, died in this
city yesterday. The hour of his death
marked the passing of a wonderful old
man, whose life has been well sprinkled
with eccentricities and whose business
pursuits have often been interesting. He
had a hobby of investing in bonds and
mortgages, and well guarded Investments
placed the figures of his fortune in the
million spaces.
At the beginning of this year he sud
denly realized that this city had a future
and commenced placing large sums of
money in real estate. He immediately
made a number of deals and they were
consummated with apparently little con
sideration. The Auzerais property was
purchased in January, and two weeks
later he secured for the sum of $150,000 the
property at 1016 Market street, which ex
tends through to Eddy. He was what
might be termed a "speedy" buyer, and
tHe Auzerais deal was made in three
days' time for a consideration Â«f $152,000.
Most of this property he immediately
deeded over to his son. William Ede Jr.
At his request the body will be reduced
to ashes. The cremation will take place
at Odd Fellows' Cemetery to-morrow aft
ernoon. The funeral services will be con
ducted by Mission Masonic Lodge No. 169,
of which he was a member.
In the Divorce Courts.
George Larson has been granted a di

of infidelity. Decrees of divorce on the
ground of neglect have been granted
Catherine Rustad from William Rustad
and Matilda L. Orr from Charles P. Orr.
Suits for divorce on the ground of infidel
ity have been filed by Alfred Kahn
against Mary Kahn. and Fred W. Bennett

cause of complaint.
Charged With Grand Larceny.
Henry Raymond, a newsboy, 14 years

of being the boy who entered Julius Van

fects. Payment of this note and accrued
interest was fought bitterly until the eve
of the present campaign. It was then
settled for fifty cents on the dollar. Mr.
Fitzgerald was the man who bought the
ring and arranged the details of the al
leged contract wedding between Miss
Hickethier and Shelby Martin, the
banker.
Frank Miller, a resident of Fitchburg,
Alameda County, accuses Mr. Fitzgerald
of sharp practice while acting as his
agent. Payment was demanded of Mr.
Afiller on two notes, one for $250, made
payable to E. L. Fitzgerald, and the
other for $100, made payable to Ole C.
Vinzent. When these were presented Mr.
Miller repudiated them, saying his signa
ture was in each case a forgery. He was
sued in the Justice's Court, Oakland, but
the proceedings were quashed. Mr. Miller
never paid the notes.
Mr. Fitzgerald might, if in an explain
ing mood, tell of the disappearance of 300
chickens, a cow, horse, some furniture
and farming utensils from a ranch pur
chased through him by Mr. Miller, near
Elmhurst in 1893.
Six years ago Miller was a prosperous
butcher in Oakland. He owned a beau
tiful home on Filbert street, and was en
vied by his acquaintances. Mr. Fitzger
ald and Ole C. Vinzent, his companion
in many escapades, cultivated Miller's
friendship and spent many hours in his
office. He introduced them in his house,
a trust which they basely betrayed. While
in Mr. Miller's office Mr. Fitzgerald often
amused himself copying Mr. Miller's
handwriting, in imitating which he be
came an adept.
"E. L. Fitzgerald and Ole C. Vinzent em
bittered my life and robbed me until they
made me a poor man," said Mr. Miller
yesterday. "They took advantage of my
good nature and of the confidence I re
posed in them. They had the entree to
my home and abused that privilege. I
had a beautiful home on Filbert street,
Oakland, and they finally induced me to
exchange it for a ranch near Elmhurst
belonging to Charles Thorn. I was to se
cure possession on a certain day, but they
put me off for another twenty-four hours.
Late that night they went to the ranch
with wagons and carried away -everything
of value.
This included over 300 chickens, a Jersey
cow, which I understand is still at Mr.

STILL WELLS=FARGO
SELLS ITS STAMPS
Only a Superior Court Decision, Says Mr. Valentine, bat
There Will Be Others.
Notwithstanding that Superior Judge Troutt has decided Wells, Fargo
& Co. must pay its own war tax and upon his decision has awarded to
William F. Costley nominal damages in the sum of $5 and the costs of his
action, the company still refuses to affix to its receipts the little blua
badges of the nation's necessity.
In fact. President Valentine looks upon the decision of Judge Troutt
as a differential instrument and has acceded to it as such. He has ad
mitted its justice and equity by mailing to William Costley a check cover
ing his damage and costs, but he denies this same Justice and equity by
still compelling his patrons to pay the company's tax. Wells-Fargo's
agents are affixing no stamps, nor, despite the plain written law, will they.
This upon the order of the manager of the company himself. But in ad
mitting Judge Troutt's findings to the extent of acknowledging the dam
ages of William Costley, Mr. Valentine has established a precedent that
may result In the diminution of his company's coffers to a greater extent
than would the righteous paying of its taxes.
As the caÃe stands to-day the merchants of this city can add several
hundred per cent to their profits by offering their freight to Wells, Fargo &
Co. for shipment without a war stamp and bringing suit for damages
upon its refusal. The minimum amount allowed by Mr. Valentine in cases
of this sort is $5, and he stands ready and willing to pay the costs of the
action. To the young man out of a job or the frugal citizen who has noth
ing else to burden his time here is a profitable employment, for a new suit
may be begun for every package hemay care to wrap and have refused, with
five dollars at least In sight for each refusal at the end of not more than
thirty days.
There need be no rush Into this new El Dorado. Mr. Valentine proposes
to give ample time to all who will. The decision of no court of this State
will change his present course, be it Justices or Supreme. Nothing but a
decision of the Supreme Court of the United States will do for ivir. Valen
tine, and a Supreme Court decision is, as a general thing, some little time
in coming to hand.
L. F. Rowell, the manager of Mr. Valentine's company, said as much
yesterday when he was asked as to the company's intentions toward the
people. He said: "No, of course we are not going to begin paying for the
war stamps. There has been no decision yet that we consider final or that
we think rightly compels us to pay this tax.
"Yes, Judge Troutt decided that Costley case against us. but then that
is only a Superior Court decision, and there have been two or three like
It in different Circuit Courts in the East, but until the United States Su
preme Court renders a decision against us I don't think we will begin buy
ing war stamps. We paid Costley his damages because the court awarded
them to him, but we did not consider that Judge Troutt's decision on the
stamp matter settled that question."
In other words, Judge Troutt's law Is all right when it costs anything
under a hundred, but for a larger expenditure Mr. Valentine and his man
ager demand the leverage of a higher decision.
Despite Mr. Valentine's small opinion of Superior Court and general
California decisions, Attorney General Fitzgerald is proceeding with his
plan to bring the company to time by a writ of mandamus. As was an
nounced in The Call of Friday morning last. Assistant Attorney General
Anderson presented at Wells, Fargo & Co.'s office a package addressed to
the State Board of Examiners, which was refused transmission upon his
declining to pay for and affix the necessary stamp.
With this refusal as a basis for his action the Attorney General pro
poses to apply to the Circuit Court for a writ of mandate, compelling the
company to accept and transmit his package.
Attorney General Fitzgerald is preparing a digest of the recent decision
of the Michigan Circuit Court, and of all other declsloÂ»s and opinions that
he can find that have any bearing upon the case.
Fitzgerald's home in Berkeley; a horse
and a lot of furniture and farming im
plements. It had been stipulated 1 was
to receive all these articles. The cnick
ens were sold to Jake Pantoskey. and
when I charged Mr. Fitzgerald with the
sale he laughingly acknowledged that ne
had done so." â
'â¢These men used to sit in my office at
night and often imitated my handwrit
ing, showing it to me and saying: See,
we can write just like you.' One day Ja
cob Greenhood, at that time president of
the California (Oakland) Bank, drove up
to my store. ...
"He asked me to go to the bank with
him. I jumped In his buggy dressed as 1
was in my butchers' apron. When we
reached the bank he asked me to sign my
name on a blank sheet of paper. I aid
so and he said: "I thought so, the signa
ture to this note as a forgery. We can
send those fellows across to San Quen
tin.
"He then showed me a note purporting
to be signed by me. It was drawn in
favor of B. L. Fitzgerald.
"Suit was afterward brought against me
to recover $250 on this note and $100 on one
drawn in favor of Ole C. Vinzent. After
the case was submitted, the Judge took
it under advisement. Further proceed
ings were quashed and I have never been
called upon to pay those forged notes. J
asked Mr. Greenhood afterward as to
whether he secured his money. He gave
me an evasive answer, hinting that some
one narrowly escaped a trip to State's
Prison."
This scathing indictment of E. L,. Fitz
gerald by the men with whom he has been
associated reveals his actions in private
life and his conduct in public office. With
this record and as the protege of Mayor
Phelan this man asks the votes of decent
citizens. Accused of serious crimes,
thrust upon the Democrats of the city,
dragged from his Alameda obscurity by
Mayor Phelan. Fitzgerald impudently
seeks the suffrages of self-respecting peo
ple. The Mayor, boss and "hefter," could
find, in his opinion, no Democrat in five
wards honest enough to stand the test
of public criticism. But E. L. Fitzgerald,
accused of shameful offenses, was carried
from Alameda, a discredited sharper in
his dealings with the living, to seek as
Phelan's favorite, to obtain control of the
sacred Interest of the dead.

Naval Rendezvous Here, So the
Place on California Street
Has Been Closed.
The old blockade runner Lanrada was
in trouble on the front yesterday. She
arrived off port last Monday morning,
and as Captain Fraser did not know the
port very well. Captain James Carrol, re
ceiver of the Boston-Alaska Commercial
Company, owners of the steamer, went
out in a tug and brought her in. He
docked her at Section A of the seawall in
a berth reserved for the British ship Ga
lena. The latter vessel was towed over
from Sausalito yesterday, and when the
berth was found to be occupied the
trouble began.
Assistant Chief Wharfilnger Scott was
summoned and he ordered the Laurada
into the stream. The mate, in the ab
sence of Captain Fraser, refused to move.
Mr. Scott summoned a tug and then the
mate said there would be trouble if any
body touched the ship. Then Mr. Scott
summoned a policeman and threatened to
arrest the mate and move the ship with
out him. Then the mate gave in, the
Laurada was moved into the stream and
the delayed Galena was docked.
