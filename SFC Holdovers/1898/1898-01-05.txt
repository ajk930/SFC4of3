IS ENGLAND
BACKED BY
AMERICA?
Claims This Country's Sup
port in Troubles in the
Far East.
Strong Pressure Being Brought to
Bear Upon the Administration
to Take Action Against
Partitioning China.
LONDON, Jan. 5. â The Times, commenting editorially
this morning upon the statement of the Cologne Gazette that
since Thursday last negotiations have been proceeding in Lon
don for a Chinese loan upon the proposed security of the land
tax and accession of territory, denies that England has any
intention to demand territory or take the lead in the partition
of China.
It says: "England's policy, on the contrary, aims at rmin
taining the Chinese empire as a growing concern and a vast
field for the extension of trade. In pursuing this policy we are
glad to note that England enjoys the powerful support of the
United States Government as well as the public sentiment of
that portion of the American people which is not swayed by
Mind jingo denunciations. "
The editorial considers that the Government would be justi
fied even in incurring "reasonable financial risks which might
formerly be properly regarded as outside the scope of Govern
ment action" in order to combat measures restrictive of trade
which Hussia and Germany are seeking to obtain from China
in the shape of railway and mining monopolies and the like.
NEW YORK. .lan. 4.â The Heralds
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Strong pressure is being
Drought to hear upon the Administra
tion for some official declarations
showing that the United States does
toot view vi th unconcern the move
ment of the powers in <'hina, and that
any occupation of the territory in vio- â 
lation of the favored nation clause in
our treaties will meet with an earnest
protest from this country. It is the
opinion of a number of Senators who
have recently talked with the Presi
dent on the subject that the powers at
present are playin? their cards for Chi
nese commerce rather than fur Chi
nese territory, and that it is the duty
of the Administration to see that noth
ing is done inimical to our interest in
this respect.
Li Hung Chang's appeal was touched
upon at the Cabinet to-day, and will
come up again at the next meeting,
when something definite may be de
cided upon as to the attitude of the
United States.
TVu Ting Fang, Chinese Minister to
the United States, says that just as
soon as China can raise the necessary
funds she proposes to commence the
execution of a shipbuilding programme
which will place her navy in a better
position than it was before the Japan
ese war. His Government now has five
cruisers and torpedo-boats under con
struction in Germany. According to ad
vices received China contemplated the
construction of six large battle-ships,
twelve armored cruisers, twenty second
and third-class cruisers, several 32
knot torpedo-destroyers and a number
of torpedo-boats. It 1s understood at
the Navy Department that this pro
gramme cannot be placed in effect for
some time, as China is without suffi
cient money to pay for the ships.
I talked to-day with Lieutenant-
Commander Jose G. Sobral, naval at
tache of the Spanish legation, in regard
to the Eastern situation. His views are
based on observations he made while
stationed in the East. He said: "Just
as America was once divided among
the European powers so will China and
the rest of Asia be partitioned. In spite
of the opposition of the yellow people,
European civilization will be spread
over the Eastern continent."
MONEY IS WANTED
BY CHINESE STATESMEN
FROM THE ENGLISH.
It Begins to Look as Though the Situation in
the East Would Turn Upon the Com
mercial Pivot.
LONDON, Jan. 4.â The Evening
News says It is reported in the city
that the negotiations for a Chinese
loan of Â£16,000,000, guaranteed by the
British Government, are practically
concluded.
The Cologne Gazette on authority
from *he best-informed quarters in
Paris, announces to-day that since
Thursday last important negotiations
have been proceeding in London for a
Chinese loan, the attempts made In
Paris and St. Petersburg to arrange
for It having failed. China has offered
to contract for Â£16,000,000 in London, at
the same time asking the good offices
of the British Government.
China, it appears, contemplates offer
ing as Becurity the land tax, under the
control of Englishmen, and agrees, fur
thermore, that an Englishman shall
succeed Sir Robert Hart as director of
the Chinese Imperial Maritime Cus
toms. In addition. Great Britain will
insist upon a concession of territory,
relative to -which secrecy, according to
the informant erf the Cologne Gazette,
must be temporarily observed.
The Cologne Gazette adds that It 1b
The San Francisco Call
understood Russia has renewed her
offer to China to include a loan in Ger
many on more favorable ternrs than
are obtainable in Paris or London.
According to a dispatch to the Daily
Mai! from Rome. Pignnr Crispi, th-
distinguished Italian statesman and
former Premier, has said, in the course
of an interview there, that events in
the far east have proved that Rus
sia "only sought the French alliance
to hamper France in this important
matter, and that Italy would get noth
ing by supporting England in Chinese
affairs, while she might expect much
from supporting Russo-German ac
tion."
Captain Rosendahl, commander of
the German warship Friedrlch Karl,

German forces ashore at Kiaochau

KANSAS CITY. Mo., Jan. 4.â After
about three months' inactivity Kansas
City's train robbers scored another
brilliant achievement to-night. This
time the Kansas City. Pittsburg and
Gulf road is the sufferer. The com
pany's Port Arthur express, which left
the company's depot here at 6:40 to
night, was robbed before it had passed
beyond the city limits.
Two men, whom no one but the ex
press messenger seems to have seen,
climbed into the express-car as the
train left the depot. They overpowered
the messenger, bound and gagged him
and rifled the car before the train came
to a stop. When the train slowed up
at a railroad crossing known as Air
Line Junction, near the southeastern
limits of the ciis r , they climbed out of
the car and disappeared. Nothing -v\;is
known of the robbery until a negro
train porter entered the car and found
the hdpfa ss Â« xpress messenger.
After the train had been stopped and
others of the crew had come forward
and released the express messenger, it
was found that the robbers had rifled
the local safe, taking from It every
thing of value. They had made no ef
fort to disturb the through safe, which
is protected by a time lock. From Air
Line Junction a telegraphic report of
the robbery was sent to this city and
the train proceeded south. The Wells-
Fargo Company control the express
on the Pittsburg and Gulf Road. At
the express company's office here. C.
R. Tease, the local manager, stated
that there was not much of value in
tho local safe, and that $200 or $300
would probably cover the company's
loss. In police circles, however, the
impression prevails that th<* robbers
secured several thousand dollars In
money and Jewelry.
The report received at the express
company's office here states that the
robbers entered the express rar as the
train was pulling out of the yards, hav
ing forced the rear door with a Jimmy.
E. X. Hyde of Kansas City was the
express messenger. T'pon turning from
his work he looked Into the barrel of a
Fix-shooter. The messenger offered no
resistance, though he was well armed,
and after the robbers had bound him,
one of them stood guard over him
while the other rifled the safe.
The robbers are described as smooth
faced young men and the fact that both
were extremely nervous while in the
express car is taken as evidence that
they are new recruits to Kansas City's
force of train robbers.
At 7 o'clock a special train was sent
to the scene of the robbery with a
force of policemen and marshals, and
theae men are now scourin^ the coun
try along the river banks in search of
the robbers.
Though to-night's robbery is the first
that has occurred on the P. & G. line,
it is the sixth crime of the kind per
petrated In Kansas within fifteen
months. There have been several ar
rests of train robbers during this time,
but there has not been a single convic
tion. __
DREYFUS CHAMPIONED BY
GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS.
American Veteran of the Opinion That the I
Frenchman Should Be Given a
Rehearing.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4.â General W.
S. Rosecrans is a strong- champion of
Captain Emll E. Dreyfus, the French
officer who is serving- a life sentence
on L'lsle dv Diatale for revealing
French military secrets to the Qer
mans. In response to a request Gen
eral Hopecrans has written the follow
ing 1 as his views of the case:
The case of Captain Dreyfus is one
that appeals to the sympathy of every
true American. A rehearing of the cn*a
under impartial influences would cer
tainly do no harm, were he guilty or in
nocent. If guilty, a MQOIMI conviction
would accentuate the majesty of the law
more forcibly. If innocent, a great in
justice would be at least partially atoned
for, a gallant and efficient officer would
be restored to the service of his beloved
country and his many friends and sym
pathizers throughout the world would re
joice In his vindication.
Ills gallant and patriotic conduct when
his sword and insignia of rank were torn
from him, when his sentence of dismissal
from the army was being carried out,
his devotion to his country, manifested
by his cheers and the cry of "Vive la
France" In the midst of this scene of ob
loquy and degradation, appeal to every
loyal soldier and certainly do not bear
tho> marks of treason to his country. If
guilty, would he not have curaed those
wh<> were thus heaping disgrace upon
him?
In the Interest of truth and justice I
heartily second the efforts made In the
work of obtaining a rehearing of the case
of this unfortunate officer.

HANNA'S MEN EXPLAIN IT.
They Tell What Occurred at an All-
Night Conference at Which Mrs.
Griffith Attended.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Jan. 4.â To-night,
It Is alleged, the Hanna managers lost
the two doubtful members that they
had gained to-day, bo that It Is said
there Is no material change from that
of yesterday, when the House stood 56
to 53 against Hanna. This would give
the Seoator only 70 votes on joint bal
lot, or three less than enough votes to
elect. In connection with the change of
Representative Griffith, back to the
antl-Hanna camp there are most scan
dalously sensational reports In circula
tion. Mr. Griffith has been on both
sides several times, and' bo pledged
himself in writing. In these dispatches
yesterday was an accVmnt of the Han
na workers spending Sunday night
with Representative Griffith and of his
sending at 3 a. m. for his wife to cpme
from the Great Southern Hotel to the
Neil House to Join him in a conference
with the Hanna people.
At R a. m. the Kurtz people saw Mrs.
Griffith and the all-night work of the
Hanna men was undone Just before
her husband went to the State House
on Monday nnrn f j to qualify as
Speaker pro tern. wlt>. .tee other can
didates of "the combine." After the
Legislature was organized Mr. Griffith
had another night of conferences on
both Fides of the Senatorial case and
this morning he pave the Hanna men
a written pledge over his own signa
ture that he would vote for the Sena
tor. Later In the day he was Been by
the opponents of Senator Hanna. and
to-nlcht he gave out the following:
To the public: Tt Is due to the public
and myself that I mako a statement of
my position in the Senatorial matter.
"While it is true that the convention
which nominated me paÂ«spfd a resolution
requesting me to support Senator Hanna,
and â¢while I at various times during the j
campaign and since declared my inten
tion to follow that r. .|ti.st and even
promised a dozen or more of my constitu- !
ents In Mr. Hanna's headquarters on
Monday of this week that T would do so.
I have, however, since learning the par
ticulars of the Indignities heaped upon
my wife Monday morning, reached the
conviction that I would be untrue to my
manhood should I cast my vote for a
man who either uses or employs such
methods, and shall resent the indigni
ties and insults heaped upon myself and
friends, and also do a rvice for my
State and country, by voting for a Re
publican other than Mr. Hanna for
United States Senator.
Notwithstanding the threats that have
been made to me that I cannot return
and live in T'nlon county if I do not vote
fr.r Mr. Hanna. It is my hnp P an d belief
that the good people who have honored
BM with the'r confidenre and whom I
love and honor will uphold me in this de
termination, that cannot under any cir
cumstances now be chaiw-
J. E. GRIFFITH.
When a copy of the statement pur
porting to come from Representative
Griffith waa shown to Senator Hanna
this evonini? he said: "I do not believe
Mr. Griffith ever made this statement,
because It is not true. It Is represent
ed to me that he is an honorable man,
and therefore I shall not believe with
out some further evidence that he ever
made or used any such statement."
Notwithstanding that Mr. Hanna re
gards it as untrue that Representative
Griffith himself published the state
ment, yet it is known that the docu
ment is in Griffith's handwriting,
whether he prepared it himself or not.
The last letter of Griffith has caused
not only a sensation, but the most bit
ter feeling and the worst of charges
on the part of rival workers.
A signed document was Riven out to
night by Grorere McPerk, a personal
friend of Representative Griffith of
Marysville, Union County, in regard to
Mr. Griffith's statement that his wife
had received indignities from Mr.
Hanna and his friends. He states that
during the all night conference at the
Neil House on Sunday night between
Griffith and the Hanna leaders Griffith
requested that Mrs. Griffith, who was
stopping in the hotel, be sent for. Act
ing upon this request. Mr. McPeck
says, he and Mr. Chapman secured a
cab and took Mrs. Griffith to the Neil
House. Continuing Mr. McPeck says:
"Mr. Chapman accompanied her to
her room. Afterward she came to room
IS, where her husband was. Her hus
band returned to the Great Southern
Hotel and left her in room 15, in com
pany with Mr. Chapman and Jerry P.
Bliss. As Mr. Bliss did not seem in
clined to leave her room and give her
a chance to retire, we Invited her into
the public reception room, with the
expectation that Mr. Bliss would then
leave the room. I also had some con
versation at the same time. At all
times while at the Neil House Mrs.
Griffith received the most courteous

To M. Legarde is due the credit for establishing the present friendly
relations and understanding between the two powers which is causing so
much concern in England, In making the visit to the court he left his com
panions at Harar, confiding himself entirely to Ras Makonnen.
PARIS, Jan. 4. â A letter from an officer of the Marchand expedition â which, according to
the authentic news received here yesterday, had arrived at Rafai, in the Tambura district of the
Nile Basin, on September 17, and was proceeding to occupy Rumbek, in the territory of
Bahr-El-Ghazeel â published in the newspaper of Toulouse, says the French force consists of
twenty-four white men and 500 riflemen. Describing the hardships endured, the writer says:
"The native carriers give much trouble. We seized them forcibly, and they attempted
to escape at every opportunity. We vainly shot or hanged those who were recaptured, but
others continued to escape. Many were recaptured, but several succeeded in getting away.
We were obliged to enter villages with a few riflemen and seize al! the men and women found
therein. Sometimes the whole population fled. Then we burned a few huts, which generally
induced the natives to return. We then seized the chief and compelled him to give us the
slaves to carry our loads. This is the only way to deal with these brutes, whom we have seen
quarrel over the bodies of their shot comrades for food."
treatment on the part of Senator
Hanna and all his friends.
"I will say further, that for many
years past the relations between Mr.
Griffith's family and Mr. Chapman and
myself and our families have been of
a very cordial character and that Mr.
Chapman and myself have been very
warm political as well as personal
friends of Mr. Griffith, and if any in
dignity had been offered to Mrs. Grif
fith by any person while she was in
our presence, we would have resented
it. It is not reasonable to suppose
that Senator Hanna or any of his
friends would offer any indignity to
any lady, especially the wife of a mem
ber who had promised to vote for Mr.
Hanna for United States Senator and
whose vote at that time, as he had
through the entire campaign, fully ex
pected to receive."
General Grosvenor stated that he
had to be in Congress on Thursday
to take part in the debate, and that
he was leaving for I that purpose and
would be back the lart of the week.
J. Park Alexander of Akron, a trustee
of the Ohio Imbecile Asylum, to-day

REPUBLICANS
DECIDE NOT TO
HOLD A CAUCUS.
They Will Fight the Senatorial Struggle to a
Finish on the Floor of the
Legislature.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 4.â The po
litical future of Senator Hanna is cer
tainly to-night in a closely poised bal
ance. While there are now reported to
be only nine dissenters among the
eighty Republican members â one in
the Senate and eight in the House â yet
the really doubtful list is limited to
two or three. Some of the dissenting
> Republicans are not likely ever to be
reconciled to Senator Hanna. They
have burned the bridges behind them
and openly admit It. Representatives

the organization of the House, stated
to-day that they would vote for Sena
tor Hanna, This givt^s Hanna fifty
four in the House and seventeen in the
Senate â a total of seventy-one, or two
short of the necessary majority.
Droste of Hamilton, who voted for
I'.MXwell for Speaker, announced at the
time that he would support Jeptha
Gerrard, a silver Republican, for Sena
tor, so that the net Rain for Hanna to
date over the vote on the organiza
tion Is only one. The Hanna men say
they expect to get the votes of Scott of
Fuller and Rutan of Carroll, who were
instructed for Hanna and voted for
the "combine" on organization.
The doubtful members are being of
fered their choice of chairmanships and
given the opportunity to make all other
selections they want. The power of
the organization of the House is cer
tainly being used to the greatest pos
sible advantage, and its influence is not
to be underestimated in connection
with the support of the State adminis
tration. While Mr. Kurtz and his as
sociates will make no statements, yet
they are holding back the appointments
on the committees and other patronage
in anticipation of gaining several votes
on the Senatorial ballot.
In holding their men in line the
"combine" is having trouble with some
of the sixty-five Democratic members.
It is believed that Mayor McKisson will
give way to Mr. Kurtz for the short
term for Senator, while Governor Bush
nell has all along been regarded as the
candidate for the long term.
Letters and telegrams poured in to
day on Governor Bushnell, the dissent
ing Republican members and others,
protesting against the action of the
Republicans who are co-operating with
the Democrats. In reply, thoee about
the headquarters in the Great South
ern Hotel revived the talk of the Amer
ican Protective Association, the work -
ingmen nnd others being opposed to
Senator Hanna.
The announcement to-day by the
Republicans that they would have no
joint Senatorial caucus to-morrow
nipht or at any time previous to the
balloting for Senator will compel all to
continue in this guerrilla warfare for
another week, but with the result de
pending on the action of two or three
doubtful members neither side could
show its hand without exposing the
recruits or the deserters to terrific fire
for at least a week. It was expected
by the public that there would be de
cisive results at the caucuses to-mor
row, but there will be no caucuses, and
the steering committees will try to

have all members located before bal
loting begins.
The Senate and the House will ballot
separately next Tuesday for Senator.
The Senate will stand 19 to 17 against
Hanna by Senator Burke voting with
the Democrats. The House on Monday
stood 56 to 53. It is now 55 to 54
against Hanna. This would settle the
contest if "the combine" in both houses
can concentrate on any one candidate
against Hanna, and when the two
houses meet on the following day,
Wednesday, January 12, to canvass in
joint assembly the vote of the previous
day, as cast by each branch separately,
there would be nothing to do except to
announce the total result as 74 to 71
against Hanna.
But if Senator Hanna has not a ma
jority a week hence it is doubtful
whether any opponent will have it, and
the general prediction is for a dead
lock. In the event that the balloting
next Tuesday does not show a major
ity for any one the General Asssembly
will proceed on the next day to ballot
ing in the joint assembly, and continue
to do so until there is an election. The
balloting a week hence may not do any
more than compel the contestants to
show their names on rollcall, and after
that the same fight may be continued
for an indefinite period.
The "combine" claims that he has
been an ex-Senator since the Legisla
ture met yesterday. As Senator Hanna
was appointed when Secretary Sher
man went into the Cabinet, article 2,
section 2, of the statutes Is being
quoted.
In the House all sorts of bills were
introduced against corporations. The
measures were regarded as thrusts at
Senator Hanna, whose afrairs are of
varied interests. An amendment to the
Nicholas law, which taxes the earnings
of express, telegraph, telephone and
other companies was introduced so as
to Include street railways, electric light
and power equipments, artificial and
natural gas, pipe-line messengers,
sleeping-car and all other corporations.
There was also a bill introduced to
repeal the law for a new State House.
This was regarded as returning the
compliment to the Columbus people,
who have expressed their protests at
the course of Governor Bushnell.
While these measures were being
thrown in a delegation of 350 from
Springfield, the home of Governor
Bushnell, marched into the Stat9
House wearing Hanna badges and with
banners bearing severe inscriptions
and called on Governor Bushnell.
Congressman Weaver, the spokes
man of the visiting delegation from
Springfield, said: "I had the hoses *â¢2
present your name at the Toledo con
vention and am proud of it. Circum
stances have arisen which have chang
ed the current of affairs. Certala per
sons who claim to be Republicans are
endeavoring to thwart Mr. Hanna s
candidacy, but cannot believe that
you are one of these, that you are ufi
loyal. For you to do this would be a
political blunder, if not a political
crime. Hence we call to ask if you
have done what is charged against
you."
Following this Congressman Y\ caver s
remarks were in the nature of an ap
peal to the Governor to not permit the
Republican party to go down to defeat
by the election of any other man COT
Senator except &L A. Hanna.
Governor Bushnell was almost over
come by emotion. In response h* re
ferred to the fact that the Representa
tives and Senators from Clarke County
are strong adherents of Hanna, while
but three-fourths of the Cuyahoga
County delegation are for him. He
said he had been misunderstood and
misrepresented in the present contro
versy and charged that it was not true
that' he had attended a Democratic
conference to defeat Hanna. (Cheers.)
He said he did not know a conference
had been held. He expressed the be
lief that the members of the House
and Senate should decide the question
of a Senator and all others should re
main out of the fight.
"But this." he said, "cannot be, as it
is a free country, and as long as the
people behave they have a richt to be
there. But all people have their pref
erences and prejudices. Until to-day
my Republicanism has never been
Questioned." (Hisses and groans, min
gled with cheers, greeted this state
ment, and Governor Bushnell raised his
hand to quiet the assemblage.)
"It is by your suffrage that I am in
this high "office. Now, if you have no
respect for me, for God's sake have re
spect for the office.
"Have you taken any action for a
candidate. Governor?" inquired one of
tho delegation.
â 1 have no vote in the Legislature."
he said.
Continuing:. Governor Bushnell said:
"I discharged my duty last spring
when I appointed Mr. Hanna United
States Senator. Now the members of
the Legislature must discharge theirs."
From the Governor's office the dele
gation marched to Senator Hanna's
headquarters in the Neil House, where
the members greeted the Senator. Ad
dresses were made by General (Irosve
nor. Senator Hanna, Major Dick, Judge
Nash and others. Senator Hanna spoke
at length, reviewing the action of the
Toledo convention, the work of the last
campaign, and the action of the past
few days, but expressed the fullest
confidence in the final result.
The Springfield delegation gave pa
rades during the afternoon, serenaded
the newspaper offices and even the
headquarters of Kurtz and "the com
bine" at the Great Southern Hotel this
evening and returned home before mid
night.

TWO CHILDREN SHOT
BY A VICIOUS YOUTH.
Fired Upon and Badly Wounded Because
They Refused to Play With
the Lad.
PORTLAND, Jan. 4.â Lena Demmlng
and Etta Brock, two children of Forest
Grove, aged 10 and 7 respectively, were
shot in the face by John Volkner, a 14
year-old boy, to-day, at the home of
the Demming girl, about three miles
south of Forest Grove. Volker was in
the yard, while the girls, with four
others, were in the house standing at
a window. The boy asked the girls to
come out in the barn and play.
They refused, and he discharged a
. shotgun at the window, breaking the
glass and injuring several of the girla
The little Demming girl was severely
wounded, shot and broken glass strik
ing her on the face. One eyeball is
lacerated, and it is feared she will losa
the sight. The Brock girl's face was
cut by the broken glass. The others
received minor injuries.
The boy has been known as a terror
in the neighborhood for some time and
will probably be sent to the Reform
School.
POLLISCO' S SLAYER SAYS HE
ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE.
James Savage Lewis Arraigned at Mad era
for a Recent Killing Near
ONeals.
MADERA, Jan. 4.â James Savage
Lewis, charared with the murder of
Frank Pollisco, was brought before
Judge Conley this morning for arraign
ment. Lewis pleaded not guilty and
his trial was set for the 15th of Feb
ruary.
Lewis is charged with having killed
Pollisco on December 20 last, in the
neighborhood of O'Neals, a mountain
section thirty miles from Madera
There were no witnesses to the alleged
crime, and defendant claims to have
acted in self-defense. Soon aft^r the
tragedy Lewis gave himself into the
custody of an officer, and when an in
vestigation was had it was found that
Pollisco had been stabbed to death.
A number of wounds was found upon
the body, and it was evident that Pol
lisco had bled a great deal, as his
clothing was soaked with blood.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 4.
Although the Secretary of War is ill
at his residence on X street and Assist
ant Secretary of War Meiklejohn is
virtually in charge of the expedition
for the relief of the Klondike miners,
Mr. Alger is devoting a good deal of at
tention to the matter. This is evident
from the decision of the War Depart
ment to appoint Stanley W. Turner of
Michigan as "civilian aide" to the ex
pedition.
There will be three of these "civilian
aides." They will act in an advisory
capacity to the regular army officers,
according to the War Department offi
cials, but just what this means is not
quite clear. Probably it means that
they will draw their salaries under the
appropriation made by Congress for
the relief of the miners. Just this much
money will, therefore, be diverted from
its charitable and useful purpose.
Mr. Turner, who is to be the "chief
civilian aide," has been the Auditor-
General of the State of Michigan. He
is engaged in the lumbering business,
and is a warm friend of Alger, who is
also a Michigan lumberman. It is un
derstood that one of the other aides
will be appointed from Chicago, and
the third from Seattle. These aides
are ordered to report to Captain
Brainerd.
ACTUAL SITUATION IN
DAWSON MISREPRESENTED
THROUGH SELFISHNESS
Men Who Seek to Profit by Taking In Supplies
Would Prevent Relief Expe
ditions.
SEATTLE, Jan. 4â Of the large
number of returning Klondikers, it is
the exceptional man who does not in
tend to return to Dawson City at the
earliest possible moment, and it is
their further intention to take great
quantities of provisions. It is the fear
that the Government or big capital
ists with every possible facility at
their command will anticipate their
commercial scheme of carrying in food
that prompts bo many to publicly pro
claim that there is no danger of
famine or any scarcity of food.
Of the nearly forty miners who re
turned from the Klondike on the
steamer Corona on Sunday night last,
a large number are very pronounced
in their views as to the shortage of
provisions that already exists. Prom
inent among these is T. G. Wilson of
Seattle, who was one of the latest to
leave Dawson. Speaking on the sub
ject he said:
"My business at Dawson was such
that I visited almost every claim on
Bonanza and El Dorado and conversed
with hundreds of the miners, and I can
safely say that seven-tenths of the
people are short of provisions. The
companies that had taken orders from
the miners calling for rrom eight to
twenty sacks of flour and other things
in proportion had to cut the orders to
one, two or three sacks of flour, and
other staples in proportion. While I
do not mean to say any person will die
of starvation, I have not the slightest
doubt that many will suffer from hun
ger. I know of hundreds myself who
have from three to five sacks of flour
and about the same proportion of other
supplies to carry them through to the
Ist of June. They are trusting to luck
to get more when these are gone.
"It takes about one sack of flour to
the month with other staples in pro
portion to keep a man. In April and
May the shortage will be felt. I am
surprised to see that because of indi
vidual and local jealousies people will
try to discourage the Government from
sending in the relief expedition. It is
nothing more than selfishness. Individ
uals want to take in provisions to sell
at high prices. I say by all means send
the expedition, even if the members
eat half of the food going in and com
ing out. The other half will be a god
send to the people in there and nine
tenths of them will be willing to pay
a reasonable price for all they can get.
"If the people in the States will but
stop and think a minute they will won
der why it is that they have ever
thought that the Government should
not send the expedition. Think of what
Captain Hansen has repeatedly said to
the miners at Dawson. He represents
the Alaska Commercial Company. I
have heard him address the miners
time and time again, using in sub
stance this language:
" 'Men, leave the country, for God's
sake leave it, or you will suffer. Go to
Fort Yukon, where there are supplies,
but under no circumstances stay
here.'
"As a result of his words many have
gone to Fort Yukon, others have come
out over the trail, but there are thou
sands yet at Dawson.
"I tell you that some time before I
left Dawson I was in Captain Han
sen's office, and I saw women come in
with tears in their eyes and ask that
they be sold ten pounds of flour. They
were refused. I don't for a minute
stand here and tell you that there is
no food in Dawson. If there were
none then there would be starvation
at the present time. But I do say that
what little food there is in the camp
is going day by day, and no man, if
he had studied economy all his life
could make it last until the river
opens next summer.
"When the statement is made that a
miner or any other person living in
Dawson can at the present time ro
into any store and buy food in large
quantities, or that he can buy suf
iicient t<> last him any length of time,
it is a willful misrepresentation of af

fairs as they actually exist. I cannot
understand why an honest man, In
terested in the welfare of humanity,
should come to the States from the
city of the far north and say that
there is no necessity of the United
States Government sending a relief ex
pedition with all possible haste into
the interior."
A. Mac Donald, who is one of a party
of electrical engineers sent to the
Yukon by a British company to look
into the feasibility of applying elec
tricity to quartz lodes and placer
mining as well, . also returned on the
Corona. He strongly indorses the Gov
ernment's determination to send food
into the Klondike district. In speaking
of the probable suffering in conse
quence of a shortage in the food sup
ply Mr. Mac Donald said:
"I am satisfied there is likely to be
actual starvation. I understand very
little work is being done in the mines
this winter because of the scarcity of
food. The miners are coming out and
going down the river in droves. I
have heard a good deal about people
going in on the ice this winter, but I
doubt if a single one will get through
jf he takes an outfit. "Why, no one can
imagine the difficulties of the trip until
he has tried it. The ice is piled up
mountains high in places, so that dogs
can hardly get over. Dogs can haul
but a very small load, , and when it
comes to a man packing in his outfit on
a sled he cannot make more than five
miles a day. ' Of course those coming
out have not outfits â only sufficient
food to last them on the trip.
"They can make good time. But it
is far different with a man going in
with a compete outfit. I have heard it
suggested that horses could be taken
in over the ice. That is absolutely im
possible. No animals of any size can
get over those mountains of ice.
"I tell you, it requires money to get
a start in mining in any part of the
Yukon country," continued Mr. Mac-
Donald. "Those fellows who are go
ing in without anything will find that
they cannot make money there. It is
a rich country, there is no doubt about
that, but just think of the enormous
amount of work it requires to get the
wealth out of the frozen ground. Most
of these people coming out are fellows
who went in and sold their outfits. Not
one in ten of them has done mining."

GOSSIPY LETTER FROM
A FORTUNE-HUNTER IN
THE KLONDIKE COUNTRY.
Experiences of One of the Argonauts Who
Is Wooing Wealth With Pick
and Shovel.
SPOKANE, Jan. 4.â Attorney Alex
ander M. Winston has received a letter
from George Foster, dated November
5. and written at Dawson City. Mr.
Foster is the cabinmate of Sam Wall,
The Call correspondent. Mr. Foster is
enjoying good health and has already
made some locations, but so far has not
done any development work. Portions
of the letter are given below:
There will be a party start up the river
with dog teams in a few days and I will
â end this letter with thorn. I wrote you
some time since, which letter I presume
you have received and learned of my ar
rival. Cole, Luhn and young Burke of
Spokane will start out as soon as the
river freezes over. They have given It
up. I have been building a cabin for Abe
Spring of Seattle. He is a good fellow,
but a little too cautious.
I staked a claim on Bonanza Creek the
other day, "No. % above. 1 " A few days
after we staked there was a stampede
up there, and now the creek is staked
dear to its h< ad. The Gold Comrais
sloner was among the number, as were
two men in his office.
The strike and shortage of candles and
provisions is seriously hindering devel
opment, yet reports from the new ci â¢ eka
are very favorable. I went over to Qu.irtz
Creek to get a claim, but there was a
stftmrt.lt- party a few hours ahead of me,
so 1 missed it there. There are lots of
men watching Deadwood Creek and will
make a rush as soon as the river freezes

W . E. Porter is here. I ran onto a
quartz location of his on El Dorado.
It is almost impossible to prospect for
quartz now, but will go and see if I can
get the extension of his claim. I am in
good health and spirits. Candles an
worth $1 apiece. Grub is very scarce.
Flour has changed hands at $l*a pound.
Senutor Range of Seattle cam*- in with
out grub and had to go on to Fort Yu
kon, the mecca of the hungry, disap

dreds have gone. I guess Senator Range
thought tho Legislature was in session
here, but that is most too pathetic a
thing to discuss with levity.
Thrre are over 100 men on the Ice walk-
Ing out. The river is not all frozen over
the route that they came in over. Their
thoughts then were bright with dreams
of untold wealth, where now they are
tilled with fear of the two most relentless"
foes of manâ cold and starvation.
Equipped as they are it is almost sure
defctb, but they flee only because they
f-'<l that sure death by starvation awaits
them If they remain. It would be heroic
on their part if they realized the diffi
culties that lie before them.
So long as the weather is mild they are
all right, but the cold, the drifting "snow
and their poorly provided condition will
make them easy victims. You will see
m.-.ny pictures of the '"pathetic" in the
papers, but few will be overdrawn of
those suffering from hunger. They will
be true to the letter.
Ten days later, on November 15. Mr.
Foster completed his letter. It reads:
November 15 â The river is frozen over
and the dog train is to Btart on the 17th.
It is 17 degrees below zero to-day, but it
is not very cold. I went to Deadwood
Creek. Two men who were with me
froze â one his hands, the other his foot.
I turned back to help them in and lost
the opportunity to stake a claim on ac
count of the accident.

The Commissioner's office is crowded

"NIGGER JIM" MARRIES A
WOMAN CORRESPONDENT
ON THE KLONDIKE.
Social Event in the Far Northern City, at
Which Champagne Flows
Freely.
TACOMA, Jan. 4.â "Nigger Jim," a
Southerner, who went to the Klondike
last year, is the most famous man in
Dawson just now. In November he
acquired prominence by placing a re
volver at Bartender Lord's head and
demanding to know what had become
of the $22,000 in dust and nuggets that
had disappeared from Keery's saloon
where Lord worked. Lord confessed,
and "Nigger" recovered his $8000,
which the missing sack contained
along with other deposits.
Men just returned to Juneau say that
"Nigger" Jim celebrated the event by
marrying a- female correspondent for
an Eastern paper, who arrived In
Dawson in September. They cannot re
member her name, but at Juneau she
is described as both pretty and sensi
ble. She attracted attention while at
Juneau last summer by the unique fur
coat which she wore. All Dawson
turned out at the wedding and cham
pagne flowed freely.
"Nigger" Jim's wealth is supposed to
have been an additional attraction to
the young lady. He is rated a million
aire, and, with Alexander McDonald,
recently sold several claims to the
Cudahy Company for large sums in
cash.

DAMAGE DONE BY

Fall Crop of Tobacco Badly Injured and
Various Fruits and Vegetables
Nipped in Blossom.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 4.â The
cold weather of January 1 and 2 did
considerable damage to vegetables, but
none of a permanent character. Orange
trees will, in some instances, lose their
foliage, and in exposed places in the
northern border of the orange belt the
trees will lose a part of their tender
growth. Owing to the fact, however,
that the sap was down, the trees them
selves were able to resist unscathed
even lower temperature.
Reports from the pineapple belt of
the east coast indicate that the damage
to pineapples was trifling. The fall
crop of tobacco in all parts of the State
was injured badly. Blooms on straw
berries were killed. Early strawberries
in the northern section were frozen on
the vines and the plants themselves
set back fully six weeks. The %enderest
garden crops in all sections as far
south as Tampa, when lacking protec
tion by forests, swamps or lakes, were
badly injured.

SAN JOSE, Jan. 4. â An inquest was
held this morning over the body of lit
tle Rebecca Jane Smith, the five-year
old daughter of George F. Smith, who
was shot by her brother Jesse, aged
10 years, last evening. The tragedy
was an exceedingly sad nne. The chil
dren were playing in the attic of their
home on Bascom avenue, near Santa

were snapplug It at each other.
They soon tired of this, and after
rummaging around found a 22-caliber
revolver that had been brought to the
house by Frnnk Smith, a 14-year-old
brother, who had picked It up at a
drier. He put the revolver under his
pillow, whore the children found it.
Jesse snnppt-d it at his sister. It went
off, the bullet entering the girl's brain
through the left eye. Death was al
most instantaneuos.

PARIS, Jan. 4.â Gaston Rivierre, the
French rider, who was one of the con
testants in the recent six-day bicycle
race at Madison-square Garden, New
York, and who fell from his wheel on
the last day of the race, severely injur
, ing himself, resulting in his being
taken out of the competition, has writ
ten to a cycling paper saying in sub
stance that the American competitors
at Madison-square Garden had re
j course to every foul trick in order to
; prevent the Frenchmen, particularly
himself, from finishing the race. He
affirms that all the rules were violated
with impunity by the Americans.
During the first four days, Rivierre
continues, the Americans made every
effort to block the track, and on the
fifth day, seeing that Rivierre had sue- i
ceeded in reaching second place, every \
means was employed to knock him ;
down. Finally, the Frenchman asserts,
Kinz deliberately succeeded.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â Messrs. Pow
! era and Bacheidor, two of the mana
j gers of the recent six-days bicycle race,
i as well as several bicycle experts who
j watched tha race closely throughout, j
when seen to-day by a representative '
j of the Associated Press, declared that
! Rivierre's statements accusing the
| American competitors of adopting foul
| tactics during the contest were un
! founded. Mr. Bacheidor said:
"Itivierre complained verbally to the ,
managers on the afternoon that he fell.
! The management investigated and
found that at the time of the French- !
'â  man's fall none of the riders was
within twenty feet of him. His claim 1
at that time was that Kinz elbowed j
him. This may have been the case, but ;
, If so it was due to awkwardness on j
the part of Kinz. who was a novice in
Indoor racing. Stephanie, the other
Frenchman who was among the con- '
testants, had no complaint to make and
the injury to his knee, which caused
him to retire, was purely accidental."
PHIL DWYER BACKING McCOY.
Money for the Fit/simmons Match Ad-
vanced by the Turfman.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â When "Kid"
McCoy challenged Bob Fitzsimmons to
fight him to a finish for the middle
weight championship of the world and
a side bet of $5000 everybody asked
where "Kid" obtained his backing. It
has been learned since, however, that
the man whom the "Kid" has for his
financial sponsor is P. J. Dwyer, the
well-known Brooklyn turfman. It will
be remembered that Dwyer was one of
the men who backed Corbett against
Sullivan. Dwyer's confidence in the
American middle-weight's fistic pmvers
dates from the "Kid's" successful fight
against Creedon.
McCoy refrained from giving the
name of his backer at the time he
issued his challenge, because he thought
Fit* would regard his deft as a "bluff"
and call it. In that event McCoy would
have posted the money and announced
the name of his backer. But Fitz did
not accept, and now the secret is com
mon property.

York.
Dr. Games, the President of the Con
gress, in the course of his reply to the
Presidential message, said the canal,
when constructed, would transform
Central America and lead to its being
brought under the United States flag.
This sentiment is cordially approved
by President Zelaya and the members
of the Cabinet.
Diplomatic negotiations have been in
progress informally for some time be
tween the United States and Nicar
agua with respect to the apparent con
ilict between the concession recently
made by the Nicaraguan Government
to the Atlas Steamship Company and
that made previously to the Maritime
Canal Company of New York.
By the terms of the contract between
the Nicaraguan Government and the
Atlas Steamship Company the latter,
it is understood, receives the exclusive
right to steam navigation for thirty
years on the Silico lagoon, Lake Nic
aragua and the River San Juan del
Norte, with the exclusive right also for
the same of constructing tramways and
railroads along the line and at the best
places to avoid the obstacles in the
River San Juan.
The company agrees to make at least
three trips a month with its steamers
between Grenada and San Juan del
Norte, both ways and at least once a
month to touch at every inhabited port
on the lake. The Atlas Steamship Com
pany, limited, is an English corpora
tion.
ALL CIVILIANS

Voyage of the Nicaragua Canal
Commission on the
Newport.
By This Time Surveyors and En

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â The Herald
will to-morrow publish the following
letter from Greytown, Nicaragua, un
der date of December 21:
'â¢The Nicaragua Canal Commission,
Walker, U. S. N., president; Colonel
Peter C. Hams, corps of engineers, IT.
S. A., and Professor M. Haupt, engi
neer, is now as comfortably located in
this place as the facilities of the town
will allow. The trip from New York
to Greytown on the Newport occupied
exactly twelve days. After the first day
out more thah one-half of the civilians
on board became ill, and before the end
of the voyage more than one-half of
the remainder succumbed, the disagree
able sensations of seasickness reaching
as far aft as the cabin. The Newport
arrived at Greytown on Friday noon,
December 12, but it was not until late
the next day that the whole party
reached town, a few men only being
able to go ashore on the day of arrival.
There is no wharf at which ships can
land, they being compelled to ride at
anchor three or four miles out from the
bar, while taking on or discharging
passengers or freight. A surf boat re
ceives passengers going ashore, while
in a lighter or two is placed freight
destined for Greytown and all interior
points. The Newport's passengers were
landed without danger the day after
their appearance off the bar. The
commission and staff were taken off by
the Government steamer San Jacinto,
and the engineers, surveyors, hydro
graphers, drill men, etc., left on the
regular surf boat some time later in
the day.
They were taken to La Fi and quar
tered in old buildings belonging to the
Maritime Canal Company, two miles
away from the town. About 150 labor
ers from CoÃta Rica and Bluefields are
quartered at Camp Cheney, across the
lagoon. They will be sent away with
the engineering parties that are now
almost ready to take the field. In
about a week or ten days only the
Commissioners and staff will be in
Greytown.
E. P. Alexander, the engineer arbi
trator, appointed by President Cleve
land of the United States to settle the
boundary differences between Costa
Rica and Nicaragua, has made an
"award No. 2" in favor of Costa Rica.

FINDS EIGHT VEINS OF
FREE-MILLING QUARTZ.
Prospector Claims to Have Discovered an
El Dorado in the Omineca Dis
trict.
VICTORIA, Jan. 4.â Colonel Weath
erly, a South African mining man, who
has been prospecting for quartz in the
Omineca, this season, claims to have
discovered between that district and
the Rocky Mountains the greatest free
milling quartz deposits in the world.
They are, he says, eight quartz veins
as regularly placed as books on a shelf,
each lying between slate on the one
side and sandstone on the other. These
veins are exposed to view for about
1300 feet, cropping out of a hillside. He
says the quartz is lowgrade, but that
the discovery is one of immense value.
These reefs are located about fifty
miles east of the Parnsip River.
Colonel "Weatherly thinks he has dis
covered the mother lode from which the
gravels of the Omineca streams obtaiu
their wonderful wealth in gold.
TO MAKE A SEPARATE
STATE OF MANHATTAN.
Assemblyman Trainor's Proposition to Split
New York in Twain Seriously
Considered.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â Assemblyman
Trainor's proposition to make a sepa
rate State of Manhattan, including
New York City, will be revived again
this winter. It is proposed now to take
in a string of counties reaching up a3
far as Schohari.
New York City Democratic legislators
discuss the subject in a most guarded
manner. They admit that the idea of
forming a new State prevails among
them. Republicans profess to regard
the idea as a rare bit of Tammany
Hall humor, but the measure will be
first introduced to-morrow at Albany.
Mr. Trainor says independent Republi
cans from New York City are favorable
to his measure, and he feels certain ha
can get it through the Assembly.
ONE MORE CASE AGAINST
CARMAN IS DISMISSED.
CHICAGO, Jan. 4.â D. M. Carman of
San Francisco was discharged to-day on
another case of obtaining money by false
pretenses, on which he was brought be
fore Justice Everett yesterday. Merrick
A. Mihills of Highland Park swore out
warrants for Carman last Thursday. He
said that Carman obtained $600 from him
in exchange for lands in California,
which he says he afterward discovered
Carman had no authority to sell. The
prosecution requested a continuance, but
could advance no good grounds, and the
case was dismissed.

Masked Men Relieve
Blame's Marshal
of Captives.
Hustle Two Thieves Over
the British Columbia
Boundary.
Resolved Not to Await the
Usual Slow Process or
Extradition.
FEARED A JAILBREAK.
ThÂ» Culprits Hurried, to a Canadian
Jail, Where They Will BÂ» Held
for Trial.
Special Dicpatoh tÂ« The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. 4.â Blame, on the
boundary line between Washington
and British Columbia, has a sensation.
Masked men on Sunday night held up
the City Marshal and compelled him
to surrender two important prisoners.
Btrange to Bay, the prisoners were not
liberated, but were hustled across the
line to British Columbia, where they
are now in custody. The whole affair
is shrouded in deep mystery, but the
explanation seems to be that the
maaked men were citizens of Blame,
â who are determined that thieving in
that section must be stopped and who
were unwilling to await the slow
process of extradition, for fear the
prisoners would escape or would be lib
erated on habeas corpus proceedings.
The two prisoners are supposed to
be implicated in the burglary of Trap's
hardware store at New Westminster
last week, when several hundred dol
lars' worth of property was taken.
They were being held at Blame, where
they were arrested on Friday evening,
awaiting the arrival of British Colum
bia officers. The latter were either
to act in requesting extradition
papers or were depending entirely on
the ruse that succeeded so well.
At about 7 o'clock Sunday evening
City Marshal Ratcliff, as was his cus
tom, took the prisoners from the jail
to a near-by restaurant for supper. On
returning, before reaching the jail, a
dozen masked men suddenly sprang
from behind a vacant building, cover
ing the Marshal and his deputy with
revolvers, commanding them to hold
up their hands. The officers recog
nized at a glance that reslstancee
would be folly and quickly complied
with the request. One of the masked
men blew a whistle. A conveyance
drove up, Into which the prisoners
were loaded, and were then driven
across the international boundary line,
where British officers were con
veniently waiting to make the arrest.
The officers feel sore over the man
ner in which they were relieved of
their charges, and, while they have no
proof, they are satisfied that the hold
up was the act of the citizens' com
mittee, which in the past has made
Klaine too warm for men with no visi
ble means of support.
The officers recall the fact that not
long ago the city jail was broken into
and two petty thieves taken out,
stripped of their clothing and whipped
with blacksnakes until their bodies
looked like raw beef. In this instance
there is very little doubt as to the
guilt of the prisoners. A person who
perchased some of the stolen property
identified them.
The occurrence has created great in
tefept on Puget Sound and reminds
old-timers of the method formerly em
ployed in arresting smugglers who had
crossed the straits to Victoria. Smug
gling not being an extraditable offense
the only remedy possible was to get an
intended prisoner intoxicated at Vic
toria and bundle them aboard a boat
for Port Townsend, where he was
locked up. In this instance the British
Columbia officers had willing allies in
the citizens of Blame.
SUFFOCATED IN
A BURNING MINE
Two Men in the Anaconda
Meet Their Death While
Retreating.
The Fire Said to Have Been Smol

Years.
6peclal Dispatch to The Call.
BUTTE, Mont., Jan. 4.â Fire on th<
700 level of the Never Sweat mine ol
the Anaconda Company to-day resulted
in the death by suffocation of Michael
C. Flaherty and John F. Sullivan, pi
men in the Anaconda proper, and thÂ»
narrow escape of three others em
ployed in the Never Sweat. The stor
ies told of the occurrence are somewh.it
conflicting, due in part to the fact thai
two of the men who were fortunat.
enough to escape were overcome by the
smoke and have no distinct reeollectio:
of what took place, while the oth-i
man whose life was s.-ivÂ«-d was not ne..i
enough to the Bcene when the victims
were overcome to know much about it.
A <fording to reports of the origin ol
the lire, it was the outcome of some fire
that raged in the St. Lawrence mine
many years ago, and it is said to hav>
been smoldering ever since. This, how
ever, the officers of the company stren
uously deny. They claim that the fir.
was started by some one careless! \
leaving a candle sticking in the tim

Flaherty and Sullivan are supposed
to have smelt the smoke and gas whilt

BULL GAUGHT
AT SPOKANE

Fagen-Bush in
Custody.
Assisted in Defrauding
Many People in Bogus
Mining Deals.
Worthless Stock Sold to Gulli

TRIO NOW IN PRISON.
Charged by the Federal Government
With Use of the Mails for Un
lawful Purposes.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SPOKANE, Jan. 4.â At the instance
of Postofficer Inspector C. L.Weyland
Johnny Bull was arrested here to-day,
charged with being implicated in what
has been pronounced the greatest pos
tal swindle of the last ten years. He
is accused of being the partner 6f B.
C. W. Evans and "Baron" C. Fagen-
Bush, now in custody at Butte and
Denver, respectively, in their opera
tions, the story of which created such
a sensation when they were arrested
on September 18.
The story told by the authorities is
that the three, with the connivance of
a woman sometimes calling herself
Ella L. Fagen-Bush and at other
times Mrs. Adams, worked the people
of Illinois and other Middle Western
States for thousands of dollars, tak
ing $108,000 out of Chicago alone. Ev
ans was stationed at Butte and the
others traveled. For a time Fagen-
Bush maintained extensive offices in
the Masonic Temple building in Chi
cago, where he was arrested for other
big swindles, in which it is thought
Bull was also implicated.
The crime for which the three men
are now held is using the mails to
transact bogus mining deals. Letters
would be sent by Evans from Butte
to names furnished him by Fagan-
Bush in towns in the Middle West,
asking the addressee to invest in the
stock of a mining company.
The latter would say that the stock
was selling for 76 cents a share, and
the company stood ready to pay that
much for all offered. The day after
the letter was received Bull would ap
pear in the town as a traveling man,
get acquainted with the man to whom
the letter was sent and eventually
confide in him that he had several
thousand shares of the stock named in
the letter. Bull would profess to be
ignorant of the real value, and, as he
represented himself to be short, would
offer to sell several thousand shares
for 25 cents. The cupidity of the vic
tim would be aroused and he would
buy at once.
The scheme worked successfully for
several weeks, with large returns.
Finally Bull took from John Wood of
Joliet, 111., $750 for 3000 shares. Wood
wired to the First National Bank of
Butte to collect the $2250 he expected
to get, the bank having been, with
Bradstreet's and Dun, among the ref
erences given by Evans in his letter.
The bank went to Evans and he de
nied all knowledge of any promise
made to Wood in the letter. He said
the letter must have been sent with
out authority.
The Postoffice Department took hold
of the case. Evans was arrested in
Butte, and after a long pursuit Fagen-
Bush was caught in Denver on Sep
tember 18. Bull had disappeared.
Many other swindles then came to
light.
One night last November Bull, who
had been in Spoknae for some weeks,
had a row in the Coeur d'Alene Theater
with the manager, Fisky Barnett, with
whom he had quarreled ten years ago
in Montana. Bull was thrown out. At
4 o'clock that morning, as Barnett was
leaving the theater with his wife, Bull
fired upon him. Mrs. Barnett threw
herself in the way, and the bullet
grazed her neck. Barnett thrust her
aside and drew his revolver. Bull shot
again, wounding Barnett in the hand.
I'.arnett shot twice, wounding Bull in
the shoulder and in the arm. Bull was
removed to the hospital and his right
hand amputated. He is 64 years old,
but he quickly recovered. He was re
leased on bonds and efforts are now
being made to dismiss the criminal
r harpe of assault with intent to commit
murder. It is said he killed a man in
Butte several years ago.
The publicity given the Barnett af
fair disclosed Boll's whereabouts to
the Postal Department. The arrest
followed. The hearing was continued
to-day by the Federal Commissioner
before whom Bull was examined. As
;ho man is technically in the hands of
the State authorities the Federal Gov
rnment cannot take him. He will be
kept under surveillance.

MAN WITH FIRE
Horrible Act of Barbarism Com=
mitted by a Party of Drunken
Youths Near San Luis
Obispo.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 4.â This community is horrified over an
act of barbarism which occurred at Pismo, a seaside town eight miles
from this city. August Neilson, an old clam and fish peddler, was
found in the sand dunes divested of all clothing and with his body
shockingly, burned. Neilson was made the butt" of a so-called joke
by a party of young bloods, who stripped him of all his clothing and
then scorched his body with burning paper, "just to see him jump,"
as they told it.
Neilson could not escape and the young men, being considerably
under the influence of liquor, did not realize just what they >vere doing
until the victim sank down unconscious, in which condition he was
found and brought to the county hospital. With careful treatment he
may recover.
Warrants have been issued for the arrest of the guilty persons, all
of whom have disappeared. Michael Price, a son of ex-Supervisor J.
M. Price, one of the most highly respected citizens of the county, is
accused of being the ringleader.

Special DlSDatch to The Call.
MARTINEZ. Jan. 4.â The body of an
unknown man is lying in the morgue
here awaiting identification. He was
shot and killed at Port Costa on Sun
day evening at about 10 o'clock by Offi
cer James Scott, while resisting arivst.
William Thomas, chief officer of the
coal ship Pengren.and Richard Hughes,
steward of the vessel, which is lying at
Port Costa, came from San Francisco
and arrived at Port Costa at 9:30
o'clock Sunday night. Soon after
alighting from the train they were as
saulted by tramps and Thomas was se
verely injured about the head.
Constable Scott and Deputy Sheriff
Moiles were notified and started to
look up the assaulters. Scott went to
a box car and found six men. He
ordered them to come out. One of
them, so Scott says, drew a pistol and
pointed it at him. Scott then fired
three shots into the car. Moiles, who
was near by, came to Scott's assist
ance and five of the six men were
taken into custody. The sixth was
found lying in the car with a bullet
wound in his head, and under him was
an unloaded pistol: He was taken
charge of and died during the night.
One of the men arrested began to
weep and asked that the handcuffs be
taken off him so that he could help
his dying brother. His request was
complied with, and, an opportunity
offering, he made his escape. The
other four are in jail. They claim that
the act of Officer Scott was cold
blooded murder. This was the second
man Scott has killed within two years.
Officers Fitzpatrick and Donlanecame
over from Suisun yesterday and iden
tified the dead man and those in jail
as tramps discharged from the county
jail at Falrneld on Saturday. Coroner
Curry is anxious to learn who the dead
man was, and has given out the follow
ing description: He is known as
James Pitts, alias "Pittsburg Jimmy";
height about 5 feet 10 inches; weight
about 160 pounds; very dark complex
ion, black hair, heavy eyebrows, high
cheek bones and large ears. In India
ink fn his right forearm is a picture of
a woman and two children, the woman
holding a bouquet of flowers. On the
left forearm are three flags and an
American shield. Below the flags and
shield, enclosed in a chain, are tht?
letters "J. F." or "J. E." Below the
letters there is a star. The fellow was
apparently about 25 or 30 years of age.

Leszynsky Fails to Get Damages Because
of an Arrest for Refusing to Pay
a Second Fare.
NEW YORK. Jan. 4.â A suit, in
which the question whether or not the
Broadway cable road has a right to
demand a sceond fare from a passen
ger who simply changed from a
â¢'stalled" car to a car further ahead
is involved, was on trial to-day be
fore Judge Lacnmbe and a jury in the
United States Circuit Court. It was
the result of the arrest of Eugene L.
Loszynsky. a well-known commercial
man of San Fr.anciscoo. He b<rarded a
cable car at Spring street, and, after
paying his fare, discovered that there
was a blockade. He told the conduc
tor that he was going to walk up to
Houston street and take a car uptown
from that point. He did s<f, but the
conductor on the second car demanded
a second fare. The passenger refused
and the conductor caused his arrest,
charging disorderly conduct.
Th" police magistrate decided that
Lewzynsky had violated no law and or
dered his release. Leszynsky there
upon brought suit for $20,000 damages.
Judge Lacomhe directed the jury to
render a verdict in favor of the de
fendant corporation. "If this were
an action, said Judge Lacombe, '"for
negligence of the company in so ar
ranging the details of its business that
its contract with plaintiff was broken
undoubtedly the jury would be entitled
to take the case and assess damages,
but this is not the case and cannot be
helped out by presumption."
Accuses a Police Officer.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4.â Mrs. Chris
tine Thomson, proprietress of the Casa

Police Officer Webb of Santa Monica
of attempting to extort money from
her. .She says the officer sent a man
t.i her lodging house to buy beer,
which was supplied. Webb then ap
peared and threatened to arrest her
for selling liquor without a license un
less she agreed to pay him $40.
OPPOSITION TO
MISS GILLETTE
Women Object to Her
Admission to the
Bar.
And They Will Hold a Mass-
Meeting and Vigorously
Protest.
Educated by a Judge at Whose Home
She Has Lived Since He Was
Divorced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 4.â The refusal to ad
mit Addie Gillette, the pretty young
typewriter of Judge Hayden. to practice
law before the Worcester County bar
is but the beginning of a sensation
which will excite the interest of the
whole State. Not only have personal
appeals been made and petitions circu
lated against Miss Gillette's admission
to the bar, but then? are at present
completed arrangements for a mass
meeting of all the women of Fitch
burg to take action in opposition to
Miss Gillette's legal aspirations.
Judge Hayden has stated that in the
event of such a meeting legal action
will be taken against every person
participating in it. Without a home.
Miss Gillette turned, Â«Â»ight years ago,
to Judge Hayden, who had been a
friend of her parents, for protection
and assistance. She entered into a five
year contract with her employer. By
the terms of this contract Miss Gil
lette was provided a home at Judge
Hayden's and some compensation be
sides in return for her services at his
office.
There was plenty to do, but enough
leisure for her to pursue the study of
law. She was examined for the bar
on November 26, but for more than a
month she did not officially know that
she had passed. Then she was de
nied admission to the bar because the
county examiners had listened to ru
mors that have been circulated in re
gard to her by some of the women of
Fitchburg.
The criticism arises because Miss Gil
lette has lived at Judge Hayden's home
since the latter was divorced from his
wife three years ago. Mrs. Hayden
secured an uncontested divorce from
Judge Hayden on the grounds of cruel
ty and abusive treatment. Miss Gil
lette continued to live at her employ
er's home after the separation, and
from this fact the criticism of her con
duct has arisen. She is engaged to
be married to a young man who is now
in London. Miss Gillette is a relative
of the actor, William Gillette. They
are cousins.
FUTILE SEARCH
FOR ELOPERS
A Runaway Pair Succeeds in
Eluding Monterey County
Officers.
Pacific Grove Society Man Accused
of Having Aoduoted a Young
Girl.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Jan. 4.â Sheriff Matthews
has been searching in this city for a
runaway couple. Benjamin Norton, a
society man of Pacific Grove, is accused
of having abducted Mamie Martin, al4
year-old girl, whose parents live in
Castroville. The young girl was last
seen in the company of Norton, and it
is believed that he has hidden her
somewhere either in this city or Pa
cific Grove.
Mrs. Mary A. Martin, the mother of
i the girl, came from Oastroville to-day
in search of her young daughter. She

SAN JOSE, Jan. The report of the
count of the money in the city treas
ury, as submitted to the . Common
Council to-night,' shows that there is
slightly over $124,000 on hand. From ap
pearances this is too rich a plum for
the members to quarrel over, so they
Will patch up their differences and pro
ce^ to -><iÂ«i it... - â¢ :â .Â»>;;; -
Under the investigations Into city af
fairs, as inadr by 'i ne Call, it has been
shown that $650 was paid to Charles
Wehner for alleged work on the main
sewer, which was not regular. The
Mayor refused to sign the warrant,
and the interested parties became so
alarmed that the money was returned
by Wehner to the treasury. To-night
this identical $GSO was passed by the
Council and ordered paid to Wehner.
The only member opposing was Krieg,
who voted no. The claim was not pre
sented in its original form. On the
contrary, it was cut up into smaller
sums ranging from $60 to $90 in each
bill or claim. Councilmen Nolting and
Fay showed especial solicitude in ad
vocacy of the payment of this sum.
The claims were presented In the
amounts of less than $100 to keep
within the provision of the charter,
which require advertisement and an
opportunity for competitive bids. The
payment of the claims, though cut up
into smaller amounts, is clearly illegal,
it is held, because even if Wehner has
done any work it was not let as the
charter requires, and this method of
allowing the claims is but a subter
fuge.
This "Job" was fully punctured by
The Call some weeks ago. It is con
tended by the advocates of the claim
in the Council that Wehner earned the
money in filling in the main sewer and
in work which was aside from that
called for in his contract. Many citi
zens wish further light on this matter
and may demand it yet.
Mayor Koch has not intimated what
he will do about signing the warrants.
He has gone on record as against pay
ing the money because it was an
illegal claim. The cutting of the total
sum of $650 into various smaller sums
does not alter the original illegality.
The sum and substance of the whole
matter appears on its face to be Just
what it is â a job to favor a favorite.
The Council also paid the claim of
Mabury & Farrel of $320. City Attor
ney Welch within the last few days
stated that the claim should not be
paid and that the courts should pass
upon it. This statement came as a re
sult of the controversy whicn arose
over the entire Julian street sewer con
tract. Fraud was freely charged, and,
although the city attorney had orig
inally recommended that the $3200 be
paid, he said he was forced to with
draw this recommendation under the
light given by the discussion. As
adopted to-night, the resolution, which
was dated In October last, provides
that '$1600 be paid at once, $800 at the
first meeting in January, and $SOO in
April." This would require the imme
diate payment of $2400, whereas, as a
matter of fact, there is in the sewer
fund but $2100. This was explained to
the members of the Council by the
clerk, but the resolution was passed
and then an attempt made to bridge
the difficulty by directing the Mayor
to draw a warrant at once for $1600
only.
Interested citizens are now asking
why Nolting, who had so freely charg
ed gross fraud against Contractors Ala
bury & Farrel, should so change his
views. Another curious position is lhat
of Fay. Fay and Noltins had the open
ditch filled in with great eclat ami
then declared that no matter what was
done with the claim the contractors
would be forced to pay for this. To
nisht no provision was made to collect
further than the statement that the
contractors would pay their claims for
labor. When the contract was let for
$12,000, there was no money in the fund
and many lawyers hold that the con
tract was absolutely void.
In the controversy which arose the
Councilmen, especially Nolting, charg
ed that there had been collusion by the
contractors and that the bid of $12,000
was about $4000 too high. Now, how
ever, he allows the proportioned part
of the bid for the amount of work done.
Various other matters to-night show
that the fat sum in the treasury will be
rapidly diminished.
COLONEL TIMOTHY BROOKS
LIES DANGEROUSLY ILL.
Oldest Gold Miner in the State May Mot
Be Seen at the Go/den
Jubilee.
POMONA. Jan. 4.â The people in
Pomona think that Colonel Timothy
W. Brooks, who lies alarmingly ill at
his rooms ut the Weston Hotel in
Pomona, will never recover. He is
the oldest and most generally known
pioneer in Southern California. He
has for several years claimed that he
was the oldest gold miner in the
State. He was one of the first men
who joined the stampede of excited
men from Santa Cruz to Coloma when
Marshall's discovery became known
there in March, 1848.
From that day to this Colonel
Brooks has been always engaged in
gold mining. He is known among
miners from British Columbia to the
Rio Grande. He has been very rich
three times and is now poor. His
heart has been set upon attending the
Golden Jubilee in San Francisco, and
he had prepared to go to it, when he
fell sick. Dozens of old-time miners
in Central California hav^ recently
written to Colonel Brooks to be sure
to attend the Jubilee.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4.â About forty
teachers were examined before the
Board of Education to-night as wit
nesses for the defense in connection
with the trial of School Director Wal
ter L. Webb, charged with taking
bribes from teachers and other em
ployes of the School Department. All
of the teachers testified that they had
not paid anything to secure their posi
tions and that they had not been asked
by any one to do so. These were all
teachers who had been newly appoint
ed and not simply re-elected.
In the course of the examination of
these witnesses it was shown that with
very few exceptions the teachers felt
that a stigma had been placed on all
of them in a general way by the man
ner in which the newspapers and those
interested in the prosecution had made
it appear that the teachers had been
held up by the wholesale. Both the
main floor and the gallery of the Coun
cil chamber, where the investigation is
being held, were filled with soectators,
ladies predominating. Charles Cassat
Davis, the newly elected president, pre
sided. The other members present w;ere
Poor, Webb, Bartlett and Conrey â just
a quorum.
After all the teachers present had
been examined Mr. Webb explained
that they were all the new teachers.
He added that he had a resolution
which he would like to have adopted,
as it covered all the teachers who had
been re-elected. He then read the
resolution, which requested the
League for Better City Government to
forward a communication to the
board, acknowledging that two teach
ers and two janitors were the only
ones who paid for their positions to J.
F. Adams and C. H. Axtell.
The resolution was declared out of
order by Chairman Davis, who said
each side had been given the right to
put in its case in its own way. Webb
said the prosecution had completed its
case. He added that the local papers
had charged that the defense intended
to drag out the investigation in order
to tire out the public and make it for
get about it.
Fifty witnesses, all teachers, will be
subpenaed for to-morrow.
MOT EAGER TO PROSECUTE.
President Rule Willing to Overlook Bra/ey's
Violation of the Law.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4.â Frederick
K. Rule, president of the League for
Better City Government, which has
been active in the prosecution of School
Director Webb, is not disposed to take
up the case of Banker J. H. Bealy, who
is charged with having violated the law
in discounting teachers' warrants.
When the attention of District At
torney Donnell was called to the Braly
case, he said that he would bring it be
fore the Grand Jury on Monday, as
that body had taken a recess until
then.
"The investigation started," said Mr.
Rule, when he was seen to-day, "on
the charges filed . against Mr. Ax
tell and Mr. Adams. Mr. Webb was
not connected with it as far as we
knew. Personally, I had no idea that
he was. The investigation resulted in
the resignations of Adams and Axtell.
"During the investigation of the
charges made against Adams and Ax
tell Mr. Webb's name was brought
into it by parties testifying that when
Adams and Axtell asked them for
money they stated the money was for
Webb. That of course resulted in
further investigation in reference to
Mr. Webb. The attorneys of the
League for Better City Government
felt that Mr. Webb was more or less
involved in the matter. At any rate,
the evidence was sufficient to warrant
the charges being brought against Mr.
Webb.
"The league is organized for the pur
pose of trying to improve matters here
in the city government, and we don't
propose to stop with the Board of indu
ration if there is any evidence of any
thing that needs investigation in other
departments.
"I think what we have done in get
ting rid of Adams and Axtell is suf
ficient to warrant us in feeling we
have been well repaid for our work.
We feel that the reorganization of the
board is a good thing for the city.
There is a man now at the head of the
Board of Education who is undoubt
edly thoroughly conscientious and
honest in every respect."
"Has it ever been brought to the no
tice of the league that Sir. Braly had
committed a felony in discounting the
warrants of teachers?" asked the cor
respondent of The Call.
"Not that I am aware of. I never
heard of any such charge. I have
heard somebody say that the teachers'
warrants were discounted at his
bank."
"Was any attempt made by the
league to investigate that matter?"
"I don't know that it was ever
brought to the attention of the league."
"This has been a matter of common
street report, the evidence of an un
mistakable cnaraceter and is a matter
of record. Why was not this case
taken up by the league?"
"It was, as I understand It, not Mr.
Braly, but his bank, which discounted
these warrants."
After the laws bearing on the matter i
had been explained to Mr. Rule and i
his attention was called to the fact
that Mr. Braly was president of the i
bank and consequently a stockholder i
and therefore benefited by the pur- ;
chase of these warants he replied:
"I do not think there was any in
fringement of the law."
Mr. Rule was asked why the league
had not taken action to have E. E.
Cooper, W. H. Morris. Miss Clara j
Schroeter and C. J. Rohde removed j
from their positions in the School De- j
partment and why they were not pros
ecuted for having purchased their posi
tions, the two former as janitors and
the latter as teachers. He was asked
why Adams and Axtell were not pros
ecuted for their repeated and self-con
fesed perjuries and why F. K. Neilson,
the contractor, was not prosecuted for
using bribery to procure a contract.
The prosecution of all these cases, he
answered, would take more money than
was required to run the city govern
ment. Mr. Rule thought it was the
duty of the district attorney to take up
these cases, notwithstanding the keen
interest the league had tal-isn in the
prosecution of Webb.
ZANOLI ESCAPES
THE MURDER CHARGE.
But the Barber Will Be Prosecuted for For-
gery and Grand Larceny for Swindling
Insurance Companies.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â The case
against Charles Zanoli, accused of.
having murdered his wife, Jennie
Sunnier, whose body was exhumed,
has broken down, as has been fore
shadowed. Professor Wilthaus. who
has teen making an analysis of the
contents of the dead woman's stom
ach in search for poison, has com
pleted his work, and will make a re
port to the District Attorney's office
to-morrow. The report has not been
made public, but it is learned that Dr.
Wilthaus has found nothing of a
poisonous nature in the intestines, ex
cept fluid containing arsenious acid,
the product of arsenic.
The poison, however, enters into the
composition of the fluid used in em
balming Mrs. Suhmer's body, so that
its presence there is no evidence of
poisoning.
It is also learned that the District At
torney had practically decided not to
attempt to prosecute Zanoli for murder.
It has also been decided that it would
be useless to exhume the bodies of Za
noli's other wives, all of whom died be
fore Mrs. Suhmer, and whose bodies are
doubtless much further advanced in de
composition than hers. He will be pros
ecuted, however, for grand larceny and
forgery, in defrauding the life insur
ance companies by collecting policiea
issued on his own life after the death
of his employe, William Schmidt.
THE CLEVELAND
AGAIN IN PORT
Return of the Vessel Which
Was Stranded Off Van
couver Island.
Drops Anchor at Victoria and. Will BÂ«
Repaired, at Quartermaster
Harbor.
Special Dispatch to TTie Call.
VICTORIA, Jan. 4.â The steamer
Cleveland, miraculously saved from de
struction on the west coast of Van
couver Island, dropped anchor in Royal
Roads, off this city, shortly after noon
to-day. Captain Metcalf of San Fran
cisco, who had superintended the work
of floating her, and Mr. J. H. Tyson,
the owner, came into town with the
idea of arranging to have the steamer
repaired here, but since the marine
ways are occupied, and the graving
dock charges rather heavy it was de
cided to adhere to the original inten
tion and have the work done at Quar
termaster Harbor on Puget Sound.
The Cleveland is to-day taking in no
more water than her own pumps can
control. A good sized hole forward
and another aft are her most serious
injuries, though many plates on the
starboard side as well as on the bot
tom are perforated and will have to be
removed. The machinery has been
damaged by its immersion, but the re
pairs will not be nearly so expensive as
might have been expected.
Little difficulty was experienced in
freeing the Cleveland from the rocky
pc-int on which she had lodged in mov
ing toward the sandy beach. On Sat
urday the American tug Tyee gave her
a line, but the water was low at the
time and the ship refused to move.
The next day the Czar of Victoria,
which had been on hand throughout
the wrecking operations, hitched on
astern, and without the slightest diffi
culty the steamer was towed to a place
of safety. When beached her bottom
was patched as best it could be for
temporary service, and the vessel can
now proceed safely to her dock.

A marvelous medicine for young mothers

It does away with the discomforts of the

" I took Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription
before my confinement, and I was only in labor
a short time,' writes Mrs. Minnie A. Peterson,

said I got along unusually well. I think the
medicine saved a great deal of suffering and I
get all my friends who need it to try it."
One of the best-known of American nÂ«ed-

would be wise if it could be done. Since it
cannot be done, try something else. Reform
the future grandfathers and grandmothers.
Do this through education. The greatest

LOS ANGELES. Jan. 4.â The first
meeting of the University Farmers*
Club's Institute held In the State of
California is now in session in this
city. Many of the best known and
xnoet prominent agriculturists in
Southern California are present.
Southern California is the birthplace
of the Farmers' Institute in Califor
nia. The tlrst Farmers' Institute on
the Pacific Coast was organized at
Compton, Los Angeles County, in IS9O.
At rirst the movement was really lo
cal in us character, but with the ad
vent of Professor A. J. Cook of Mieh
e and character of the
:tes broadened and be
came more general, until finally the
whole State of â  was Included.
The meeting now in session is â¢
a convent] .. i C farmers' clubs, assem
bled as an Institute. In the future it
is to be an annual feature. E
county and agricultural locality iii
Southern California is represented,
from Santa Barbara on the north to
San Diego on the south.
Among the prominent agriculturists
present are: Professor J. G. Kyle of
Riverside, James Boyd, the pioneer,
who laid out the beautiful Magnolia
avenue at Kiverside; William Perm

G. H. A. Goodwin; publicity, C. H.
Sessions; finance, A. J. Cook; music,
C F. Edsonson; railroadsâ Abbott

The first session was called to order
by Professor A. J. Cook, in the assem
bly-room of the Chamber of Com
merce. CÂ» H. A. Goodwin, the editor
of the Cultivator, acted as secretary.
General Charles Forman. president of
the Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce, was introduced and delivered a
cordial address of welcome.
Professor A. J. Cook read a paper on
"Farmers' Institute Clubs," Professor
Cook enumerated a number of subjects
which in his opinion the thirty-two
clubs now organized could discuss* with
Interest and profit. A committee, con
sisting of Messrs. Dunn. Beastons,
I>oyd. Maguire and Sprague, was
named to consider and report on the
suggestions. â¢ ;
Hon. Eiwood Cooper was to have
read a paper on "Food Adulteration,"
but as he was unavoidably absent a
paper written by Mr. Cooper upon the
subject was read by Secretary Good
win.
Robert Dunn of Fillmore discussed
the subject of "Diversified Crops." He
took the position that to keep lands
healthy there should be rotation of
crops.
One of the best papers of the entire
session was by Professor A. J. Sprague
of Fairmount, who discussed "Almond
Culture ' P: kfescor Sprague said that
the growers shoutd endeavor to produce
all the almonds -.he market could
profitably take, instead of competing
in lines that were already crowded.
So far the history of almond growing
in California had been one of disap
pointment, because the trees had been
planted in I icalltiefl. where the trees
flourished, bat did not bear well. As
California was the only State in the
Union which produced almonds. It was
to inquire what conditions favor al
mond growth.
In certain distri tB the wild almond
was growing. It is found in hich
altitudes, where the air is rarer, the
rainfall scanty, the soil of a permeable
character, where there was scarcely
any fog. where the winters were cold
end there was snow to the depth of
twelve to fifteen Inches in February
and the first of March. It had been
found that almonds in the higher
altitudes were hardier, standing a
temperature of t4 degrees, when to
those lower In the valley & tempera
ture of JS degrees was fataL
"As to culture," said he, 'it is wiee
to do as little pruning as consistent.
During the summer of the second sea
son it is not desirable to prune at all.
The second winter it Is better to cut
back only to thin out and trim up the
trees to make them shapely; and the
same method should be folÂ»owed there
after. This method has been proven
the best by experience.
"The almond is not for irrigation and
should be grown where irrigation Is not
necessary. In harvesting almonds they
can be handled much better and more
cheaply in large quantities, as the
largo machines for shucking are much
more efficient.
"The *oft-shelled almonds most cora
monly planted aro Norp&reil, I X i_.
Ne Plus ritra and paper-shell. Drakes'
seedling, though graded 2 to 5 cents
rhwpir than the above varieties, is a
heavy producer and consequently pro
fitable."
Ac a closing word. Mr. Sprague said
thai sitnonds should never be grown in
it region where they had to be su"
phured. Almonds that have t.< be sul
nhured suffer fioni two disadvantages.

viz: the cost of sulphuring and the dis
advantage in the market, which was
growing with the people's understand
ing that almonds were not so good after
being subjected to the injurious sul
phur treatment.
The subject of 'Fruit Exchanges"
started a dispute in the Institute. J.
H. Hoag of Kedlands took up a de
fense >f the Citrus Union and went for
the Southern California Fruit Ex
change. Mr. Hoag was not . present
himself, hut his paper was read by A.
C. Moore, the president of the Redlands
Horticultural Club. L. A. Taylor of
Pomona and William Perm Rogers of
Highlands defended the Southern Cali
fornia Fruit Exchange, as did A. H.
Natsner. the president of the latter in
stitution. Finally the subject got too
warm. or. rather, the discussion did,
and it was dropped.
Papers were read as follows: A. R.
Sprague of the Antelope Valley on
"Deciduous Fruit Exchanges": C. A.
Hatch of Pasadena Of the Southern
California Beekeepers' Association, on
"Beekeepers' Exchanges"; Albert K.
Smiley, on "Roads and Roadside Tree
Planting"; J. W. Mills, on "Promising
New Varieties of Fruit."
At this evening s s.ss.on resolutions '
were adopted favoring the fornsation of
a deciduous fruit growers" association; i
expressing sympathy with the Florida i
citrus fruit growers over the misfor
tunes they are experiencing in the way
of cold weather: Indorsing the ten block
system of numbering country homes
and urging boards of supervisors to
take the matter up and push it to early
completion.
Miss Jean Loomis read a comprehen
sive paper on "Scale Insects," describ
ing the different classes of scale in
stvts. and telling something or" their
habits and harmful propensities. F.
Austin of Fallbrook read a paper on
"Fighting Scale Insects. ' S. A. 1
of San Bernardino County made strong
argument in favor of fumigation rather
than spraying, as by the former fully
Â»9 per cent of the insects would be ex
terminated. Judson Williams of Fall
brook added his testimony as to the
efficacy of fumigation, saying, however,
that growers were justified in econo
mizing on small tre^s by using sprays.
He discussed at some length the mer
its of various sprays.
A. D. Bishop read a paper on 'The
Purple Scale," (riving the history- of
its introduction Into California and
suggesting the most successful meth
ods of lighting it. Mr. Hall of San
Diego lifted his voice in f*vor of spray
ing ;.â¢ Ft fumigation, which, he
said, killed the scale but not the egg.
He said the spray to swear by was one
pound of Babbitt's lye put into twenty
gallon* of water.
In the discussion that followed there
, seemed to In? a general opinion that
: kerosene emulsions should be gingerly
handled by amateur sprayers.
Secretary Goodwin read a paper by
V. Tressler. secretary of the Riverside
Poultry Ass.i lation. He spoke of the
', common erroneous belief that thor
oughbred poultry was more delicate
' than the common stock. Given proper
; housing nnd good food thoroughbreds
' were not only sightlier than the com
mon stock, but more profitable to
handle.
T. W. Covran of London. England,
was introduced as an authority on the
subject set for him on the programme.
"Bees and Horticulture. Ho gave a
learned account of th*Â» part bees play
ed in fertilizing plants. The fertilizer
question was discussed by P. M. Wood
bridge of South Pasadena, a member
of the Southern California Pomological
Society.
A paper on "Maintaining the Fertil

\V. Hilgard of Berkeley. James Mor
gan of the Santa Barbara Horticul
tural Association discussed the ques
tion of disposing of fruit crops, in
which he scored the middlemen, who
he claimed ate up the profits of the

FRANCE REALLY OWNS
CLIPPERTON ISLAND
At Uait That Is the C/aia Put Forward by
a Paris Paper, Which Says the Frtach
Should Adjudicate.
PARIS, Jan. 4.â The IJberte asserts
that Clipperton Island, over which the
Mexican flag is reported to have been
hoisted by a party of marines from the
runboat Dernocrata, after the stars and
stripes had been hauled down in spite
of the protests of the Americans there,
really belongs to France, and adds:
"Naturally the Americans have asked
for the protection of their Government,
but it is France's duty to re-establish
order in that island, adjudicate be
tween the Americans and Mexicans,
and demonstarate our own rights,
which have never been contested." *Â»
NEW YORK. Jan. 4-â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The admin
istration has paid no attention to the
report that the American flag was
hauled down on Clipperton Island by
a Mexican gunboat, nor will it do so
until the matter is brought officially
before it. I was Informed by a depart
ment official to-day that the United
States had never formally proclaimed
that Clipperton Island was under its
jurisdiction. Clipperton Island is situ
ated about SW miles off the Mexican
coast, almost due west of Acapu'.. It
is only about four miles in circumfer
ence, but the jruar.o upon it is said to
be valued at IJOO.OCO.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JA2TCARY 5, 1898.
SEVERE BLOW
TO ARBITRATION
Damages Not Allowed for
111-Treatment in
Mexico.
Argentina's Minister Decided
the Case by Ignoring All
Legal Points.
Peculiar Lack of Perception, Without
a Parallel in the History of
Arbitration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Rigg* House,
Washington. Jan. 4.
The cause of arbitration in the set
tlement of claims between nations has
received a severe check in the award
by the arbitrators in the case of Ober
lander and Messenger, who claimed
|M,tM and $2j>,i\>o respectively for ill
treatment by the Mexican authorities.
The arbitrator was the Argentine Min
ister at Madrid. St-nor Queseda. and his
decision was in favor of the Mexican
. nment and against the American
claimants. The discouraging feature of
the decision is that in making the de
cision the arbitrator apparently over
looked every point of law. according to
the English standard, and decided the
case with reference to his sympathies.
It is said that a more extraordinary
opinion than this from a legal stand
point of vit-w was never seen at the
State Department. Oberlander was a
Deputy Sheriff in California and he
was kidnaped and then taken across
the border by Mexican officer*. Mrs.
Messenger, in whose nouse he had
taken refuge, was ill-treated. When it
came to rendering his decision the ar
bitrator, it is said, ignored the facts
and reasoned that because the United
States Government had not recognized
the rights of the Chinese Government
to indemnity for the killing of Chinese
at Rock Springs. Wyo.. while insisting
upon indemnity for losses sustained by-
American missionaries in China, we
could not expect to have an indemnity
awarded our citizens in such IMM as
this.
This peculiar lack of legal perception
is said, at the State Department, to be
almost without a parallel in the history
of arbitrations, and has undoubtedly
done much to prevent the submission
of other claims to arbitration, unless it
can first be shown that the arbitrator
is familiar with the principles of com
mon law, according to the English
standards.

that the past season has been a golden

LOUD NAMES
POSTMASTERS
Recommends Men for the
Gilroy and Santa Clara
Offices.
Los Gatos Merchants Protest
Against the Free Rural
Delivery.
In Order to Reducs Expenses It Is
Proposed to Consolidate a Num
ber of Offices.
Special Dlipatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House.
Washington, Jan. 4.
Congressman Loud was at the Post
office Department to-day and recom
mended Postmasters for the cities of
Santa Clara and Gilroy in his district.
Richard Ryan was recommended for
the office at Gilroy and A. A. Withrow
at Santa Clara. Both are Presidential
offices. There were several candidates
for each of the places.
Mr. Loud has received from Los
Gatos several petitions against the
proposed free rural delivery system to
be established In that vicinity, with
the town of Campbell as the central
distributing point. It appears from
this petition, which is signed by mer
chants of the place, that they are fear
ful that Los Gatos will l->se the trade
of those ruralists who have been as
customed to go there to get their mail.
Tht-se merchants contended that it will
work a great hardship to them if the
t.-wn of Campbell is made the free
delivery distributing point, as the
farmers have for many years been ac
customed to coming to Los Gatos tar
their mail, and at the same time pur
chased their goods there, but Mr. Loud
very properly replied that such selfish
considerations ought not to prevail,
and that the convenience of mail fa
cilities in the outlying districts should
be considered. Inasmuch as there has
been a proposition considered to re
duce Postofflee Department expendi
tures by lopping off st-me of the car
riers in the big cities, other members
of the Committee in Postofflces and
I*. st Roads have proposed that the
force of carriers in the big cities be
reduced.
Mr. Loud assents to this, but thinks
that a better way might be to consoli
date the smaller P'gtofflces within a
certain radius with some central of
fices. One instance of a successful con
solidation of this kind is at India
napolis, Ind. A number of suburban
offices within a short distance of In
dianapolis were abolished. The main of
fice was then called "Greater Indian
apolis" and the smaller poetomces were
made "sub-stations" and an agent ap
pointed for each of them, under the di
rection of the PiHrtÃWtw at Indiana
polis. Mr. Loud suggested tbat this
DO might be put Into practice In
many thickly settled communities, as
for instance that In the nÂ«ighlK>rhood
of L- land Stanford University, where
a number of smaller offices might be
abolished by consolidation. This would
save about >20.0i>0 that is now paid in
salaries to these several postmasters,
and this money cou! i be used for free
rural delivery in that vi. inity. This
was merely a tentative suggestion on
the part of Mr. Loud, and has not yet
received ser:ous consideration.

Attorney - General McKenna
Says the Road Is in
Default.
Meanwhile Huntlngton Is Trying to
Prevent Action by the Gov
ernment.
Sp*riÂ»l Dijpatchto The Call.
XEWYORK. Jan. 4 â A special to the
Mail and Express from Washington
says: Attorney - General McKenna
stated this afternoon that in his opin
ion the Government could foreclose on
the Central Pacific road in view of the
default of tlO 614,210 worth of bonds
last Saturday, but he did not believe it
possible to take any immediate steps In
the matter in view of the reassembling
of Conjrress to-morrow.
Although Judpe McKenr.a did not
cay so it is we kruv.n at the Depart
ment of Justice that the course to be
followed by the Government in this
matter is to be left until Governor
Griggs is appointed Attorney-General
and takes office, but as Attorney-Gen
eral McKenna holds that the Govern
ment car. foreclose this will no doubt
be the administration's! course.
It is understood here that C. P.
Huntinirton is endeavoring la arrange
with English holders of bonds for an
extension of at least one year. â '.> â¢ ,
If Huntlr.pton canr.ot make arrange
ments with English holders of securi
ties in default foreclosure will have to
come, and the Government, of course,
will act with foreign bondholders so as
to protect itw (
President Oollia P. Huntington of the
Central Pacific Railroad had nothing
to add to-day to the statement of the
condition of the road which he made
in Interviews yesterday. He said then
that some satisfactory arrangement
could be made when the debt becomes
due. and that he thought a receiver for
the road would have a tendency to re
duc* the earning* one-third. . A rep
resentative of Speyer & Co., who is
sued J50.000,000 of the first mortgage
bonds of the company, said to-day that
as the bonds were : about to mature
something would have to be done to
satisfy the holders. He said, however,
that there wu nothing being done in
the matter Just now. but that there
would be developments in the course
of a week.

NEW YORK. Jan. 4.â Pictures of
characters of the Edwin Shaw murder
trial at Camden, X. J.. 145 miles from
New York, were secured this evening
in the editorial room of the Herald
and were ready for the press ninety
six minutes from the time they were
sent. The instrument stood in an al
cove, looking for all the world like a
diminutive model of a printing press
under a glass case. The veteran opera
tor who had charge of it sat at a
table next to the case and watched the
waving finger of the instrument, draw
ing likenesses line by line. Two sheets
of paper four and a half inches square,
with a carbon sheet between, were
placed upon the bed and securely
clasped down. Over the surface passed
a carriage upon a tiny wheel. The car
riage bore a needle which pressed
down upon the surface of the paper.
Out at Camden the indicator was
passed over the lines drawn with shel
lac upon a tin plate. The needle in
Ntw York pressed down upon the pa
per every time the indicator 145 miles
away crossed the line upon the tin
plate. The finger had nearly reach
ed the rim of the bed of braes and
stopped.
The carriage was lifted up, the sheets
were slipped out, and there was the
picture of a man. The telegraph in
struments were working now.
"Have sent a picture of Nelson W.
Cox, disqualified as a juror," ticked the
sounder.
â â Received In excellent condition," was
the message sent back to Camden.
The time was twenty-one minutes.
The features of a man over at Camden
had been pictured in New York in
twenty-one minutes. Fresh sheets of
paper were put in. The needle was
moved back to the starting point and
the ciock work began to move. A new
picture had been placed in the machine
at Camden. Another picture was on
the way; another twenty-one minutes
of waiting and another portrait was
taken from the machine. This, as the
operator at Camden Bent word over the
same wire, was the picture of Edward
Xorcross. foreman of the Jury-
Then the artist and engraver had
their turn. The picture* were re
drawn in India ink first. It takes thirty
minutes to re-draw a portrait carefully.
The drawings were then sent to the en
graving mom. Forty-five minutes after
it left the hands of the artist the por
trait was ready for printing. The send
ing of the pictures showed that draw
ings may be sent by wire, re-drawn
and made ready for printing in ninety

LONDON, Jan. 4.â Lady Anne Cov
entry, third daughter of the Earl of
I'ventry, was married this afternoon
at St. Peters Church. Eaton square,
to Prince Dhuleep Singh, son of the
late Maharajah of Lahore. The court
ship of the Prince and Lady Anne has
been marked by considerable opposi
tion upon the part of the lady's fam
ily, which was mainly overcome by the
intervention of the Prince of Wales.
There was a large and distinguished
company present in the church. The
decorations were elaborate, palms,
ferns and white flowers being promi
nently displayed. The Earl of Coven
try gave his daughter away. The
bridesmaids were: Lady Dorothy Cov
entry, sister of the bride; the Princess
Sophie Bamba Dhuleep Singh, Miss
Brenda Van de Wier, Lady Victoria
Herbert and Miss Elspeth Campbell.
Prince Frederick Dhuleep Singh was
the best man. The service was choral.
After the wedding there was a re
ception at the Coventry House on
Park lane. Later the couple started
for Paris. The presents were costly.
The Queen sent a bronze statuette of
herself.
Prince Victor Albert Jay Dhuleep
Singh, who is 32 years of age, is the
grandson of that East Indian Prince
whose struggle against the British
earned for him the title of the â¢"Lion
of the Punjab." The young Prince's
father, the late Maharajah of Lahore,
fought against the British in India, but
was eventually compelled to swear al
legiance to Queen Victoria. He was al
lowed a pension, the revenues of La
hore being turned into the Indian treas
ury. Later the Maharajah entered into
negotiations with Russia, for which
the British stopped his pension. The
Maharajah returnee to his allegiance,
was pardoned and his pension restored.
The famous Kohinoor diamond was
formerly the property of the late
Maharajah of ignore.
Prince Singh was educated in Eng
land, and was for a time on the staff
of General Sir Jchn Ross, when the
'.atter was in command of the British
forces in Tanada. Tbe Prince has been
prominent at Halifax, and visited Xew
York. Newp->rt and Lenox.
Lady Anne Coventry is the third
: daughter of the ninth Earl of Coventry.

Firm belief and confidence in a fam-

and faith In a patent medicine have
produced remarkable cures in all ages.
This is especially true in nervous
troubles, and no field offers so prolific
a harvest for the quack and charlatan
as the diseases arising from a weaK
or run down nervous system. -
Nevertheless, the most common or au
diseases, indigestion and stomach trou-
bles, which in turn cause nervous ais-
â¢ eases, heart troubles, comsumption ana
loss of flesh, requires something De-
sides faith to cure.
Mere faith will not digest your food
for you, will not give you an appetite,
will not increase your flesh and
strengthen your nerves and heart, but
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will do
these things, because they are com-
posed of the element* of digestion;
they contain the juices, acids and pep-
tones necessary to the digestion and
assimilation of all wholesome food.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will di-
gest food if placed in a jar or bottle

will do it much more effectively when

BEST EQUIPPED NEWSPAPER-
The New Era Edition of the San Fran

a great illustration of the enterprise

MIRRORS CALIFORNIA'S GLORY.
The Call of San Francisco Issued on the
19th an eighty-page paper to celebrate
the completion and occupancy of its new
home in the magnificent building erected
for it by Claus Spreckels. The occasion
Justified the effort. It is said the issue
will foot up over a quarter-million copies.
Its story of California productions and
clinmto." scenery, schools, farming and
mechanical energies, homes, workshops
and advances in art and science appeals
to State pride in a fashion that cannot
be denied. And to all Americans who
this remarkable paper it must carry

much to the nation's glory.â Nooksack

A MAGNIFICENT EFFORT.
The Call's New Era Edition Sunday
was a magnificent effort- The eighty
pages were full of good readable
matter, among which was found an arti
cle from Henry Miller, who does not
often pose as a Journalist. The cover
pages contained a fine view of The Call
building in the highest style of litho
graphic art. The paper was profusely il
lustrated with excellent half-tones and
many of the articles descriptive of the
State and Its industries are well worth
preserving for reference. Still, eighty
pages make too much at one time

HOPE OF THE OCCIDENT.
The New Era Call published Sunday
consisting of 350,000 copies of eighty pages
each, was a marvel even to those who ex
pected much. Its beautiful Illuminated
cover was a revelation in newspaper
foretopsafl, screen boards, band of the
main topmast and backstays; the dead
eye was carried awa; - and other damage
done. From Cape Horn to San Fran
cisco nothing but light baffling winds
were met, and for d;iys the ship did
not log more than twelve knots in the
twenty-four hours.
The Primrose Hill had nothing but
li^ht winds throughout the entire
passage, and Captain Wilson was
wishing yesterday that it had been
more stormy in order that he might
have had a chance to make a better
passage. Captain Wilson its a great
favorite in San Francisco, and a num
ber of his lady friends went out to call
on him as soon as they learned that
the Primrose Hill was in port.
Edward Sacks, late steward on the
steamer Alviso, gave Officer Tom Ellis
a lively chase on the water front yes
terday. He left the steamer some time
ago and took with him the freight
clerk's stamp and order-book. Yes
terday he began operations by bor
rowing $10 from Thompson, the
butcher, and giving an order for meat
to be delivered on board. Thompson
had his suspicions, and soon found out
that Sacks had been discharged from'
the Alviso. When he went back to
the shop later Ellis was awaiting
him. and the steward at once made a
break for liberty. He ran 1 across Mar
ket street to East, and thence to Mis
sion, where he was ca.ight and taken
to the Harbor police station, where he
was booked on six charges of obtain

he had obtained from W. S. Ray on a

NOTHING WAS NEGLECTED IN THE NEW ERA EDITION.
The New Era edition of the San Francisco Call has flooded the whole State, and probably the whole of the United
States. Our local Postmaster In this small town received fourteen sacks of Call mail and Fresno 100 sacks, which might
have accounted for the breakdown of the Fresno tratn at Borden last week If it had been going the other way. In an
Immense magazine of eighty pages such as California has never before seen and New York has never equaled, it Is
impossible to refer to everything, but nothing has been neglected. Wo call the sprr-al attention of dwellers In the
Valley to page 4S, which contains a superb article on the work done by and the future of the San Joaquin Valley Rail
road. Postmaster McLaughlin had a photograph, taken by A. R. Moore, showing the interior of the office with bun
dles of Calls piled up in every nook and corner of the spacious place. Mr. Spreckels is not booming San Francisco;
he is working for the whole State, and he has given to the entire world the greatest advertisement ever devised by

The San Francisco Call ushered In the Christmas season with a "New

and literary features of this energetic, sprightly Golden State journal are
certainly the best that money and men can command. Typographically this
edition stands unexcelled. But it is the Illuminated cover which deserves
particular attention, "it is a work of art, the frontispiece representing the
beautiful Clans Spreckels building, one of San Francisco's most imposing
structures, while the inside pages in half tones depict various sculptural de
signs with which the building abounds, together with the handsomely fitted
up business and mechanical departments occupied by the publishers of The

FLIPPANCY IN COURT.
JUDGE CAMPBELL recently decided a case
by the flipping of a coin. The matter involved
was the ownership of one silk skirt, value un
known. Here is a way out of troublesome litiga
tion. By it the jurist strengthened his claim to being
a modern Solomon. He might have listened to a lot
of testimony â about half of it perjured â and then
have been as uncertain as to the truth as in the be
ginning. Was he to permit the element of doubt to
cloud his decision? Not much. Judge Campbell
knows that a coin tossed in the air must come down
with one side or the other uppermost. No proposi
tion could be more plain. So he tossed the coin
and the woman who had elected to stake her for
tune on heads won the skirt. Justice was vindi
cated. Suppose that the obverse side of the coin
had appeared and the other woman had secured the
skirt! Then would justice have sneaked from there
downcast and forlorn. But so long as the coins
hold out justice does not have to do anything of the
sort. She can apply to Campbell and get a fair deal
every time.
TAXATION EXEMPTIONS.
IN his address at the annual meeting of the Acad
emy of Sciences on Monday evening Professor
David Starr Jordan of Stanford University is
quoted as having said in effect that with respect to
taxation the constitution of California is the meanest
ever devised by man. Dr. Jordan's complaint is that
the organic law provides for assessing all property
alike and without regard to the purposes for which
it is used. "Xo other State on receiving a gift," he
is reported as savins, "proceeds at once to tax it out
of existence. Other civilized States meet the gen
erous giver half way and double his gift. California
plunders his donation as soon as his back is turned."
Of course we understand that in referring to our
respected system of taxation in this disrespectful
manner Dr. Jordan is taking the Stanford Univer
sity view of the subject. The learned gentleman
cannot intend that his remarks shall have general ap
plication, for to carry his theory into the constitu
tion might upset the finances of many counties in
the State. Indeed, it is not difficult to see that were
Stanford University exempted from taxation a large
hole would be made in the revenues of San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties, to say nothing of the
northern counties in which its endowment is lo
cated. It would be far better for the State to re
turn the taxes collected from that institution than to
take from the counties the power to assess its prop
erty.
Since the adoption of the constitution in 1879 the
advocates of tax exemption have carried several of
their amendments. At present free public libraries
and free museums, growing crops, public schools
and State and municipal parks and buildings are
exempt from taxation. But further than this the
Legislature and people have not been willing to go.
The theory maintained by the constitution is that all
property should be taxed in proportion to its value.
If the law were to establish a long list of exemption!
not only would the orderly administration of local
fnances be interfered with, but the treasuries of
many small countries might be crippled. One of the
strongest arguments imaginable exists in favor of
exempting ships possessing California registers from
taxation. This exemption would benefit rather than
injure the State, yet the Legislature has not been
prevailed on to submit a constitutional amendment
to that effect.
Doubtless it is unjust to tax an institution like the
Stanford University. Indeed, Dr. Jordan would
probably be able to give a thousand reasons why a
. State which does assess such a school should be con
si-imed to one of its own insane asylums. But if the
property of Stanford is to be exempted, where is the
line to be drawn? Other private schools and col
leges will demand a similar privilege, and finally a
proposirion will be broached by the demagogues to
;bofish taxation altogether. We do not know but
this last idea would be indorsed by the people. It is
well 1-nown 'hat the average man no more enjoys
paying taxes than Dr. Jordan enjoys paying them.
The president of Stanford University is a gentle
man of infinite wit. We have great respect for his
learning and ingenuity. He ought to be able to pro
pose a plan for repairing the annual damage done
by the Tax Collector to his university which would
obviate the introduction of more real and personal
property exemptions into the constitution. If he
can do so we may safely promise him the public ap
proval, but further than this it is difficult to go.
Berkeley footpads explain that they recently held
up a citizen in a spirit of jest, using no weapon more
dangerous than a pointed finger. It was a most ex
cellent joke, but the real fun would have come in had
the citizen shot, and under the impression that he
was getting a pair of knaves got a pair of fools in
stead.
TWO- FACED ON ANNEXATION.
OUR neighbor, the Chronicle, should keep its
temper. Anger and logic are not messmates.
Rage and reason are never harnessed to
gether to pull the same load. In discussing annexa
tion from its spleen rather than its brain the Chron
icle discredits the intelligence of its readers. It put
in several years of fine writing to prove that white
men â Anglo-Saxons â cannot survive as laborers on
the plantations of Hawaii. It led in that line a long
list of newspapers in this State and elsewhere. With
all the iridescent egotism of the peacock it repro
duced columns of approving editorials from these
papers, from far Kentucky, cold New England and
the near by towns and cities of California. All this
was when the island planters were experimenting
with white labor by introducing Germans and Scan
dinavians. On that subject the Chronicle printed
volumes to prove that white labor could not endure
on the islands. The hot climate enervated it
It speaks now in a tone of awe and respect of the
Portuguese in Hawaii In its former campaign to
warn white labor away from the islands the Chron
icle said: 'The Portuguese laborers who come from
Fayal and the Cape Verde islanders bring their
wives and children, but they have been brutalized by
a long condition of semi-serfage and are destitute of
that adjunct of Christian civilization called morals."
In that way it accounted for their ability to stand
the climate and physical conditions of the islands,
which were too hard for the Germans, Scandina
vians and Anglo-Saxons.
Now the Chronicle changes its tune and the
change adds to the gayety of nations. In its former
campaign the islands were tropical. Now it de
clares that the vertical sun is unknown in Hawaii.
It must be, then, that Shah Dole and annexation
have given us a new heaven and a new earth. The
islands are wholly within the tropics, unless the
Chronicle has moved them, and the sun is vertical
there in its proper season.
To follow other remarkable statements of the
Chronicle in its choleric advocacy of annexation, it
says: "Whites and negroes are excluded because
they demand fair wages and the suffrage." Annexa
tion "may drive the sugar barons into paying labor
n decent wage and into yielding their despotism in
the local politics of Hawaii to the behests
of a popular majority." "To admit the
citizens of any other country, white or black,
to the suffrage would be to lose those
political privileges in the islands which the sugar
men have monopolized for years to keep their es
tates from being adequately taxed and to provide
offices under the most disgraceful system of nepot
ism which prevails anywhere for their families and
hangers on."
Now when one considers that the Dole revolution
was a planters' conspiracy, as proved by admission
of Minister Stevens and its subsequent history, and
that the sugar barons are its sole supporters, and
under it dominate the local politics of Hawaii, ex
chiding the natives from the ballot box, and that
they tyrannically suppress the popular majority be
cause it is against annexation and permit only 2800
men to vote who have to first take an oath to sup
port annexation, the Chronicle statements perspire
comedy. It would have us believe that Dole and the
planters are seeking to deprive themselves of the
privilege of paying low wages to coolies, of dominat
ing politics, of running a minority government
which suppresses a majority of the people; when
the fact is that Dole and the planters seek annexa
tion as the only means of perpetuating the rule they
have set up, of making sure a profit on their coolie
worked plantations, of depriving the majority of a
voice in Hawaiian politics.
. Dole must have some reason for saying: "I be
lieve the United States will give us separate laws so
that we can get plantation labor." The planters who
solidly support annexation must believe it too. The
President of the United States must believe it when
he says in his message that "peculiar conditions and
the needs of labor" will require â what? Just the
separate laws demanded by Dole.
In the face of all this the Chronicle gets red in the
face and cries out: "No treaty could do more to
emancipate labor than that which proposes to ad
mit Hawaii to the Union. Witness its object; it
aims to extend the humane labor laws of the United
States to a foreign country. It seeks to crush out a
form of slavery and supplant it with freedom."
Don't write nor talk when you are mad, neighbor.
Go seek a cooler head in the wash basin. The dead
and gone treaty does none of these things, and you
will know it when you refrigerate.
If the treaty did this why does Shah Dole talk of
"separate laws" and President McKinley of "pecu
liar conditions and the needs of labor," for which
that document makes no provision?
When lawyers lose a case which they have taken
on a contingent they go down to the tavern and
cuss the court, misrepresent the testimony and ac
quire a jag. Newspapers, which abhor contingents,
should not imitate the bar when they lose a case.
NOT UP TO EXPECTATION.
AT the Monday meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Golden Jubilee celebration it
was announced that collections are not up
to the expectations of the committee. It was there
fore resolved to put forth new efforts in the work.
The finance committee was increased by the addi
tion of several influential citizens and an active can
vass for funds will be made at once.
To impress upon the minds of the business men of
San Francisco the importance of making a triumphal
success of the jubilee it should not be necessary to
iterate and reiterate it. It is well known to every
intelligent man that vast opportunities of profit are
now open to the city, and that if we make San Fran
cisco widely attractive this winter we shall draw to our
manufacturers and our merchants the greater part
of the Alaskan outfitting tradeâ a trade so large that
no reflecting man estimates its value at less than
many millions.
To bring the great bulk of the new traffic to our
city and our State we must advertise the advantages
they offer. The jubilee will be an advertisement.
It is to serve as introduction to the mining exposi
tion, and by the brilliancy of the one will be judged
the value of the other. The jubilee must be golden,
gorgeous and glorious. Business as well as senti
ment demands it.
The time for raising the money and making the
preparations is short. What is to be done must be
done at once. This is the time to show the true
Californian liberality, vim. vigor and dash. San
Francisco on this occasion is to do the entertaining
for the State and should do it well. The announce
ment that contributions aie not up to expectation is
an evidence of a dormant public spirit somewhere.
We cannot afford to fall below the expectations of
the pioneers, the Native Daughters and the Native
Sons in a matter where State prestige is at stake.
THE SAX FBAXCTSCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JAXUABT 5, 1898.
THE Bulletin's favorite pose is that of a re
former. Only a few days ago it was glorying
in thi fact that in saving the city it had stood
shoulder to shoulder with that magnificent advocate
j ol purity which tinges Mission street with yellow
! and makes of it a hallowed place. That it had wrought
the salvation of the city it made no secret. That it
motives were high and holy it made no attempt to
conceal. Nobody believed it, yet few knew that the
paper thus modestly spreading the knowledge of its
virtue was a daily scoundrel and an evening crime.
Once the Bulletin was respectable. Three ptan
ago it struck the downward path, and ever since its
descent has been by leaps and bounds. Now it has
reached the lowest depths of journalistic degrada
j tion. It is a frightful example of degeneration. For
j its pretense in the matter of giving news it
might perhaps be forgiven, but when it schemes to
swindle merchants and by the methods of the
bunko world induces them to sign contracts the im
port of which is unknown to them, the time for pub
lie protest seems to have arrived.
If the scheme by which it is trying to exact pay
from business men for "advertising" they never
knowingly contracted for is not blackmail, a curious
public would like to know what it is. Nothing
more contemptible was ever known in journalistic
and commercial circles. Caught in the act of fraud,
it hurls epithets at all who refuse to approve of its
course, and threatens those who have the boldness
to resist demands which have no more basis in
equity than the demands of the non-journalistic gar
roter, who, knife in hand, endeavors to collect. The
P.ulletin of to-day is a pitiable example of dishonesty
in journalism.
SACRAMENTO is to be congratulated upon
the spirit which prevails among the members
of her municipal administration. As ex
pressed in the speeches made at the recent gathering
in the ofnee of Mayor Land, it evinces a complete
harmony of sentiment and a purpose to work to
gether for the general welfare of the community.
Mr. Bently, speaking for the Trustees who will
serve for the coming two years, said in the course
of his address to the Mayor: "I desire to extend to
\ou our assurances of confidence and a desire to co
operate with you in harmony, good will and a com
plete understanding in all matters affecting the pub
lic good."
He referred to the existence of rumors that the
board would make exacting demands upon the
Mayor and oppose his policy if the demands were
not granted, and disposed of them by saying: "I
desire to say on my own behalfâ and I believe I am
voicing the sentiments of my colleaguesâ that so far
as placing obstacles in your way by the present
board is concerned, you will find that such rumors
are false and unjustifiable."
If the Mayor and Trustees can firmly maintain
this friendly and helpful attitude toward one an
other the coming two years will be memorable for
municipal progress and improvement in Sacramento.
The people have already attested the existence of a
public sentiment strongly in favor oi profiting by the
opportunities of the new era. This was done first by
the election of Mayor Land and again by the over
whelming vote in the city for the construction of
the Folsom boulevard. Popular support is there
fore assured for an administration of enterprise and
good government.
The new officials have only to go forward in the
way they have begun to accomplish mach for their
city and indirectly for the State at large by setting
an example of what can be achieved when men in
authority work together instead of wrangling over
a division of the spoils and mutually knifing one
another to gratify spite and avenge petty grievances.
The duty of exposing a new style of fake prac
ticed by the Examiner is undertaken this morning.
It had been supposed that this paper had reached the
limit before and would be content with the spread
ing of bogus news and buncombe comment. No
body thought that it would deliberately try to fleece
the public through its business office. It was never
accused of conscience, yet policy should have for
bade. But the Examiner procured a lot of chromos
and in its efforts to work them off on the public
managed to swell its columns with an undetermined
number of fraudulent advertisements. This course
not only misled many who depended upon the ad
vertisements for information, but robbed the
genuine advertisement of its value, thus swindling
in two distinct ways. What the chromo is to art the
Examiner is to journalism. But the natural bond of
sympathy thus created is given an undue importance
when recognition of it takes the form of a confidence
game. The advertiser and the person who scans the
adveitisement in good faith are alike entitled to pro
tection against, such methods.
Undertakers seem to be in distress over the clos
ing of the old City Cemetery. However, there is
no need to expend sympathy in their behalf. They
knew in advance that the law provided for the clos
ing, but took for granted that the law would be ig
nored. Wherein for once precedent misled them.
To attempt to draw a lesson from the circumstance
that a 10 year old boy at Santa Rosa killed his 5
year old sister by shooting is natural, but wholly
useless. To the end of time the boy of this age will
go right on killing his sister. It is a matter of des
tiny, and to fret about it is a waste of effort.
An Oklahoma widow who took poison because
the man she loved had kissed another woman was
strangely illogical. Her natural and proper revenge
would have been to hunt up another man and kiss
him.
The spectacle of a School Director kicking another
so as to render the simple act of sitting down a mat
ter of discomfort does not tend to earn respect for
the board. The members of that body ought to be
encouraged to sit down.
Li Hung Chang is wasting the valuable time he
devotes to protesting against the thieving pro
gramme of the powers. There is no probability
that they went into pirate and highwayman business
with an eye to winning his august approval.
The rumor that Senator Platt intends to resign
is less startling at second glance. It is another
Platt. The New York gentleman is believed to
have entirely outgrown the resignation habit.

I believe Clara Fallmer was annoyed. *
She sat in the corner of the lounge, in her sister's manicuring and hair-dress
ing "parlors." There wasn't a particle of animation in her voice or in her face,
which would be rather pleasing if her brown eyes were more frank. Her hair
and her sister's, though arranged in the prevailing simple mode, were evidences
of that sister's skill. In fact, the Interview itself was evidence of Miss Fallmer'a
ability. \::i:V:l
"Your mother tells me." I said to Clara Fallmer, "that you don't intend to go
back to Alameda. What are your plans?" "Clara will stay here with me and
will learn my trade," answered the elder sister, composedly, "after she returns
from the country # where I shall send her."
"Then there's nothing in the story of your going on the stage?" I went on,
addressing the younger girl, who kept the position in which I had found her, as
though she had been posed and knew the effectiveness of that pose.
Both young women laughed at this, right merrily.
"I suppose," said Miss Falmer genially, "they printed that because it seems
to be the first thing anyone does after gaining notoriety. But Clara has received ;
no such letter, and has no such intention."

"OhV no," answered Miss Fallirer. deprecatingly. "But. really, you know, I'd
rather Clara wouldn't sÂ«y anything about Mrs. La Due. Our attorneys have ad
vised us not to talk," she went on largely. "We are sorry for Mrs. La Due, Clara j
and I. of course." . â¢ . ; â¢
'â¢ Of course. . The only difficulty in accepting that sorrow as sincere lay in
Clara Fallmer's Indifferent pose and placid. face.
"You were going to school when this happened?"
' "No," answered Clara Fallmer. "I wasn't going to school."
Her voice was quite toneless. It wasn't the hard, suppressed voleÂ« that tells
of strong emotion, but the insipid tone in which a child speak* who is repeating
a lesson by rote.
If Clara Fallmer has been posed, she is a trifle too docile a pupil. Her lack
of Interestâ one doesn't expect feelingâ is rather likely to impress one disagree
ably.
"Had you left 'school long before?" I asked her.
"Now," said Miss Fallmer softly. v "I don't think Clara ought to be questioned
about what'B past. It hurts her terribly. She cries and worries over it, and " i

so well that. If it had not been for her elder sister's assurance, one might have i

â  Miss ' Fallmer showed me out with that ease which the business woman ac
quires.- She is interesting, for she is Clara Fallmer matured; c trifle more viva

should Clara Fallmer adopt "artistic hairdressing, latest effects," as Miss Fall
mer's business card hath it, she will become just such a self-possessed youns?
woman and as' ready in speech as her senior.
The succession of tragedies which have made up these grrls' lives has not i
affected them.- Miss Fallmer spoke easily of her youngest sister, "who i 3 visitlne
friends in the country, because my mother's health is poor and she is also of un
sound mjnd." Â .
It would be a marvel If that mother's health were not poor, and she mi jr at well I

GOOD WORDS FOR BARRY.
San Francisco, Jan. 4, 1398.
Editor San Francisco Call: Recognizing
your motto, "The Call speaks for all," I
claim a small space in your valuable
journal. It is understood that Governor
Budd is now deliberating upon the ap
pointment of a successor to the lamented
Dr. Stanton on the Railroad Commission.
Among- the names suggested is that of
James H. Barry of the Star newspaper.
His friends, and their name is legion, be
lieve Mr. Barry would be, of all men, the
"right man in the right place" in the po
sition named, lie is a man of approved
integrity, undoubted ability, and has
made a study of the railroad question.
Notwithstanding- his fierce zeal in the
cause of the people, all who know the
man must be satisfied he would do in
justice to none as a public officer. Even
the corporations respect such a. man. If
chosen by Guvernor Budd Mr. Barry
would address himself with indomitable
energy to the work of carrying out the
watchword of Jefferson: "Equal rights
to all: special privileges to none."
The friends of Mr. Barry do not claim
that he is a goody-goody man, after the
style and manner of the many nonenti
ties in public life, whose proudest boast
is that they have no enemies. Barry is
a live man; earnest, active and aggres
sive for what he honestly believes to be
true and right. He does not think great
battles can be won with kid gloves and
rose water. Judging the future by the
past, it is safe to say that if James H
Barry is appointed the people of Califor
nia, irrespective of party, will have an
active, able, fearless and faithful guard-1
ian of their rights and interests.

The Examiner has enlarged the
Ecnpe of its fake department so a? to
embrace a portion of its advertising
pages. Its "want ads." have been
corrupted. Now, among the genuine
are scattered a lot of bogus. This cir
cumstance works a double wrong. If
a man desires to buy a horse and cart,
and, seeing one advertised, poos to the
address only to find that nobody there
has advertised, nor has such articles
for sale, he loses faith in the Integrity
of the rest of the advertisements, al
though some of them may set forth
a real ambition to dispose of a real
horse and cart. On the other hand
th> bogus advertisement is & gross
imposition upon th>' man with |
thing to sell. What shall it profit him
to sandwich his announcement be
tween two fraudulent announcements
which are apt to spread the blight of
their pretense over his own
faith? ll<rc is a thought for the per
son who has an advertisement Inserted
in th'^ Examiner, as well a^ for the one
who reads the advertisement, to pon
der.
Fake news in the Examiner is no
novelty. A cablegram from the Em
peror of China, coming with such â¢
speed that, as a scientific proposition,
it must have arrived before it started;
a message of Salisbury outlining se- !
crets of policy carefully hidden from
the English nation; the Cisneros nov
elette; the phantom charity inspiring
a baseball tournament â all these were
fakes, and never seriously regarded :
as being otherwise. But the adver- |
tlsement, believed to be secure from !
the assaults of yellow journalism, had
Its fair fame besmirched. It has been J
luYed into the Examiner and its repu- j
tation so endangered that the only
salvation is for it to get into better
company. Why should a woman de- I
clare she wanted roomers, having no j
rooms to rent? Why should a man j
seek a situation, already having a
good one? Alas! the virtue of the
"want ad." has been sapped by the
Examiner and the chromo.
The paper made known the evil in
tent of giving a chromo to every one
bringing a "want ad." Many desind
a chromo either to keep or bestow
upon an enemy. Wherefore they
flocked to the Examiner, declaring the
eligibility of rooming apartments
which had no existence, offered for
pale things they never had and gave
as addresses numbers where they were
strangers. Thus yellow journalism
succeeded in leading astray first the
advertiser, second the reader of the
advertisement had no means of know
ing the snare set for his feet. Happi
ness reigned in the office of art and
artfulness, the want ads. stretched to
pleasing length and there was rid
dance of the chromos. To interfere
with that happiness now appears to
be a duty. As to the full extent that
the passion for chromos has vitiated
the standing of the Examiner "want
ad." generally there is only one way
to find out. A few samples may be
cited, however, and doubtless more
than one leg- weary mortal could ex
tend the list.

Ex-Mayor Ellert, who lives at this
number, does not deny that it has
handsomely furnished rooms, but .they
are used for family purposes and are j
. not for rent. Mr. EUert is inclined
; to regard the matter as a joke, know
: Ing that no advertisement was Insert
ed by any one having a right to do
so. He is amused by the people who
confidently, call to inspect the apart
ments, but courteously refuses the best
offers they can make. Whether the i
callers extract much hilarity from the
affair dcre3 not appear, but the Exami
ner extracted the price of the ad., and
somebody extracted a chromo. Yester
day two ladies were surprised to find
that the Ellert kitchen and bathroom
were regarded as private. Then they
bethought them that perhaps the peo
ple next door had advertised, but in

An advertisement of rooms at 1100
Sacramento was also ascertained to
be a fako. The people living there
not only do not rent rooms and have
none to rent, but have been much an

by the Examiner's promise of "a fine

There is a pathetic side to. the mat
ter. When a person out of employ

an advertisement which seems to
promise a chance to work it may
easily happen that to reach the place
involves an expenditure of money
money naturally being scaree â or a
long and dreary tramp. To find at the
end of thÂ«j joiiraey that the destina
tion is a vacant lot or a house where
nothing is offered one is dishearten
j ing. One girl who has had many ex
| periences, all of them due to the Ex
aminer, told yesterday a measure of
; her troubles. Seeking work as a do
mestic she had gone to 1621 Leaven
worth street. There she was told that
th" people had not advertised and that
' they had been "pestered to death" by
I applicants. At 715 Ellis this was dupli
i cated. and again at the Strauss house
!at the corner of Post and Leaven
worth, and was continued on Hyde,
Fillmore. Sutter and Post. A number
on California was entirely fictitious.
One in the Western Addition was im
aginary, but would have fallen in a
vacant lot. So, disheartened and foot
1 sore, she returned from a vain search
day after day. This girl's sister could
I tell even a more trying series of dis-
I appointments, but yesterday was out,
probably adding to them.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1898.
THE STEVENSON BLOCK AS IT WILL APPEAR WHEN RECONSTRUCTED
The historic Stevenson block on the southwest corner of Montgomery and California Btreets, which was recently bought by General Thomas J.
Clunlp, Is to be remodeled, reconstructed and transformed into a building of modern features and up-to-date conveniences. The accompanying sketch made
from drawings by the architects, Curlett & McCaw, shows the structure as it will appear when reconstructed. The main entrance to the block, as it now
stands, is on Montgomery street. According to the plans for the reconstructed edifice the chief entrance will be from California street, on which the build
ing has a frontage of 130 feet. The Montgomery-street frontage is sixty feet. The present height of the building will be increased by the addition of a
Mansard-roof story and an ornamental tower. An inner section will be cut out to freely admit light and air. The interior equipment will consist of
swift-running elevators and electric lighting service. A large hallway on each floor will give access to seventy-two office rooms. The building which Is
to be converted into an office block was originally designed for hotel uses and was conducted as a hotel for many years. General Clunle understands
that the block was named in honor of Colonel J. D. Stevenson, but some of the pioneers are not positive on that point.

COMMANDER BOOTH-TUCKER in His Address Formally
Launching the Salvation Army Colony at Solcdad,
the auspices of the Salvation Army
and christened by Commander Booth-
Tucker last night midst the acclaims
of an enthusiastic audience that pack
ed Golden Gate Hall.
The scheme is a noble one. It is
the second step in the United States
In the direction of ameliorating the
congestion of city populations by af
fording willing hearts and honest
hands an opportunity to build family
homes in the country, and thus con
tribute materially to a solution of the
prfblems of pauperism and poverty.
The wort is accomplished by means
of Incorporation, under the leadership
of the Booth! and the co-operation of
the Salvation Army. It is a perfect de
sign of practical Christianity. In the
COM of Komie the incorporation is for
$100,000, under the management of five
trustees, who are empowered to issue
trust certificates. To equip 200 families
each with ten acres of improved land
it is estimated that not less than an ex
penditure of $50,000 will be required.
A part of this mm will be repre
sented by contributions from generous
sympathizers; it is the aim to raise
the residue in loans covering a period
of ten years, at a percentage ranging
between 3 and 6 per cent, at the option
of the lender. The trust certificates
serve as first security on the loans,
which are otherwise abundantly se
cured in the improvements and the
values of the townstte to be developed.
It is an entirely businesslike trans
action, in which the leaders of the Sal
vation Army organisation merely serve
as promoters or negotiators to procure
funds necessary for the holding in the
country of home.s by honest people
who are cramped, confined and desti
tute in the city for want of a chance
to make of themselves productive, suc
cessful and useful citizens. They sim
ply pledge their labor and the improve
ments accruing from it for the redemp
tion of the humane benefaction granted
them.
The Booths tri.xl their first experi
ment in this line of rational philan
thropy in Colorado, and selected Cali
fornia as the scene of their second de
parture. Last night the formal in
uufrural of the project occurred, and
those who attended out of curiosity, as
well as the Interested participants, left
the scene with wanner feelings for
their kind and a fair conception of the
possible benefits of benevolence that is
genuinely practical.

Rev. J. Voorsanger. chairman of the
evening, after the Salvation Army
quartet had rendered "We Are Bound
for the Land." described the coloniz
ing movement as one not in any sense
socialistic in its nature, as some erro
neously presume, but as a practical
plan for the bringing of people together
In such communal relations, founded
on self-help, as will remove both the
alms giver and alma taker from the
economic problems of the day. Neither
is It a, charitable movement, he said,
but one designated to afford opportun
ity to wlllinff men with families to ex
emplify the fact that every American
citizen desires to be free by working
for himself by his own hands and lips.
It is the chance for men to win back
their manhood and transmit it to their
own posterity as the wisest gift they
can bestow. The speaker was greeted
with a perfect tempest of applause
when he dwelt upon "the remarkable
fact" as an Indication of the spirit of
the times, anent the pauper and
poverty problems of the cities, that a
Jewish rabbi should preside over and
address such an assemblage, feeling in
perfei t sympathy and accord with its
purposes. He concluded by commend
ing the movement highly, and then
introduced Commander Booth-Tucker,
who went into comprehensive detail
as to the splendid practical nature of
the project.
CLEVER BURGLARS
IN THE TANKS
Frank Murphy and His Pal
Are Safely Stowed
Away.
Supposed to Be the Mission Terrors,
Who Were Hard to
Capture.
It is now thought by the police that
they have the Mission burglars, or ter
rors, as they have been termed, safely
stowed away in the tanks. Last even
ing Detectives Bee and Harper ar
rested two men In the Mission, one of
them proving to be Frank Murphy,
who h^s been long wanted by the po
lice. For days past the detectives have
been closely watching several parties
in that district, and last evening the
llrst capture was made.
The arrested parties emphatically
deny that they are implicated in the
Mission burglaries, but nevertheless
they were secretly, or supposedly so,
put on the detention book at the City
Prison.

HE ADMITS
THAT HE
IS GUILTY
George Tauchi, Who
Shot Mary Castillo,
Is in Jail.
Says That She Fooled
Him and He Was
Desperate.
Acknowledges That His Trouble
Is More Than He Ex
pected.
THOUGHT HE TOOK POISON
.Or. Kltzgibbon Hurriedly Called to
Attend the Supposed Mur
derer.
The lor? looked for Japanese, George
Tauchi, who fatally shot Mary Castillo,
is now In the City Prison. He was ar-
rested last evening in a den at 321
O'FarreJl street by Detectives Gibson
and Wren and Officers Clark and
Peshon.
For many days the officers have been
searching boarding houses, ships and
all places y. here the murderer might be
stowed, but until last evening nothing
had been heard of him.
Louis Fan, who was present at the
time of the shooting, and Y. Yaehimi,
In whose house Tauchi was hidden,
â were placed in the tanks at the City
Prison and charged on the detention
book with having harbored a criminal.
Early in the evening Officer Hellings
arrested two Japanese who were sup
posed to have been acquainted with
the circumstances of the murder, but
they were released as soon as Tauchi
â was brought in.
George Taucht and the Place in Which He Was Concealed at 32 J OTarreli Street
WTien Tauchi was taken to the
prison he vomited freely, and Dr. Fitz
gibbon was hurriedly called in as it
â¢was supposed that he had taken
poison, but it was soon seen that he
â was suffering from an overdose of
â whisky or alcoholic stimulant.
Detective Ed Gibson stated last even-
Ing that he found the long-looked-for
murderer In a closet in the rear of 321
O'Farrell street, and that in his opin
ion he had been there sine* 1 thn crime
had been committed. Tauchi first ad
mitted that he had killed Mary Cas
tillo, but afterward stated that he had
.merely tried to frighten the victim
â with a revolver and it accidentally ex
plod"rl.
When brought into the prison he
was intoxicated, but as he appreciated
his position he became sober and asked
who had preferred the charges against
him.
He said, "I will tell my story In
court and your questions don't bother
me. I liked Mary and wouldn't shoot
her for the whole of Japan. Why should
I shoot her? She was my b<-st girl, but
others tried to take her away from me.
After the accident I went to San Mateo!
but afterward returned here. At first
I did not know that she was dead. "
The police consider his capture a good
piece of work.
MONEY IS VERY SLOW.
Jubilee Management Confident of
Better Collections in the
Future.
In making: preparations for their dis
play in the coming golden jubilee cele
bration the Society of California Pio
neers is taking more pains than it
could were the affair entirely entirely
representative of their own organiza
tion. At the meeting of the celebra
tion committee yesterday afternoon the
design for the float in the jubilee
parade was finally accepted. The float,
â which was designed by Andrews and
Cannon, the designers of the jubilee
parade committee's floats, is a repre
sensation of Sutter's mill. The sur
rounding ground, upon which are to
be living figures of aborigines and
miners, will be portrayed. Within the
mill will be the identical saw which
was in the mill on January 24, 1848, and
has since been among the relics owned
by the society.
Embossed Invitations to attend the
Jubilee celebration were yesterday
issued to the Mayors of nearly 400
cities in the United States by the com
mittee on publicity and promotion.
Many of the members of the finance
committee who were present at last
night's meeting reported that in their
districts they had encountered persons
who exhibited letters under which
they claimed authority to collect funds
for the Golden Jubilee. Chairman
Tollman told the members of the com
mittee that no one except those who
carried the numbered collection books
signed by himself, T. J. Parsons (chair
man) and Henry Lunstedt (secretary
of the executive committee) have au
thority to receive subscriptions for the
funds needed for the Golden Jublleee.
Chief of Police Lees will be asked to
investigate these cases, and the com
mittee will prosecute them to the full
extent of the law.
All the committees made flattering
reports of the reception accorded them,
and quite a considerable amount of
money was paid in. , Other committees
expect to complete their labors in a
few days. The lists so far published
do not contain the names of the large
corporations which have taken action,
and from which returns are daiiy ex
pected.
The National Association of Sta
tionary Engineers has informed the
Jubilee parade committee that it will
enter the parade. The members will
turn out a small traction-engine
drawing two coaches, which will con
tain about fifty of their number. The
occupants of the coaches will wear
the official badge.
Professor Miehllng, marshal of
children's day at Golden Gate Park, is
forming the programme to be carried
out by the schoolgirls under his direc
tion. Over 500 will be assembled â one
company each from the following
schools : Horace Mann, Pacific
Heights, John Swett. Crocker, Hamil
ton, Franklin. Mission. James Lick
and Everett. The exercises will be
opened by the entire body drawing up
the line. At the command "Front â
take distance!" the ranks will be
opened and the girls will perform cal
isthenics.
The subscriptions published In The
Call yesterday, including the returns
of Monday last, amounted to $6725.

finance committee:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEBXESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1898.
HAS RAISED A
HORNET'S NEST
Result of the Row Be
tween Judges Low
and Campbell.
Significant Remark Made Yes
terday by Chief Justice
Beatty.
The Constitutionality of Pollee Courts
2, 3 and 4 May Be
Tested.
ThQ little unpleasantness between
Judges Low and Campbell over the
acceptance of a bond by the latter for
the release of Sidney Kellett may have
far-reaching consequences.
Judge Low convicted and sentenced
Kellett to one year in the County Jail,
being six months each on two charges
for having burglar tocrls In his pos
session and carrying a concealed
weapon. He appealed and Judge
Campbell accepted a bond for his re
lease. The Sheriff, on the authority
of Jtidge Low, declined to recognize
Judge Campbell's order of discharge,
and Kellett's attorney, Arthur Mack,
applied for a writ of habeas corpus
before Judge Carroll Cook. At the ar
gument Judge Low contended that the
committing magistrate alone had the
right to accept a bond for a prisoner's
release, but Judge Campbell laid down
the law that any Judge of a Police
Court was Justified in accepting a
bond, provided it was unobjectionable.
Judge Cook decided that Low was
right and Campbell was wrong.
Kellett's attorney appealed to the
Supreme Court, more with the object
of having the question definitely set
tled than anything else, and the case
was to have come up for argument
yesterday morning before Chief Justice
Beatty. Meantime Judge Low had ap
proved of the bond accepted by Camp
bell and issued an order for Kellett's
release, and he was released.
This put an end to the controversy,
but Attorney Lennon, for Kellett,
wanted to argue the point raised. The
Chief Justice declined to hear any ar
gument and then Lennon said he would
have taken up the constitutionality of
Police Court 4, presided over by Judge
Low. The Chief Justice significantly
remarked. "Better not rouse a sleeping
lion." It Is said that Attorney Lennon
will not heed the warning of the Chief
Justice, but will take steps to have the
important question tested by the Su
preme Court. It was also said that the
fear of having the question brought
Into court was the reason for Judge
Low's action in signing an order for
Kellett's release.
Under the charter for the city of San
Francisco a Police Judge Court for the
city and county waa established. After
ward, by amendments to the .charter,
Police Courts 2 and 3 were established.
Then about five years ago, by a special
act of the Legislature, the Police
Judge's Court was abolished and a Po
lice Court created with four depart
ments. It is contended that the pn>
cedure of the Legislature was uncon
stitutional, and that Police Courts 2,
3 and 4, particularly the last named,'
are not legally constituted.

Resident Jobbers to Combine Against
the Class Known as Manufac
turers' Agents.
The San Francisco Directory con- ;
tains the names of 242 men who are
listed as manufacturers' agents. The
list embraces some well-known firms
eampoMd of merchants who reside in
Utfa city, pay taxes and license and \
are Identified with the fbrtunes of the |
community. Others belong to a class
of raiding agents. Failing to get rep- ;
utable and leading houses of estab- '
lished character to handle their wares ;
they have engaged in the business of ,
selling to the trade in any form by
Which buyers can be reached. They sell
by sample and catalogue, and in or- ,
der to obtain the lowest rate on freight
so as to compete with the resident Job- j
bers, go from one retail dealer to an-
other until sufficient orders can be se- i
cured to Justify the shipment of a car- ;
load of goods. The car containing â¢
packages for ten or twelve customers j
is consigned to one individual in order I
that the regulations of the Traffic As- j
soclation may be observed in letter j
while violated in spirit. It is said by |
railroad men that the transportation j
companies have no right to inquire ;
into details regarding the consignment of
the various packages of merchandise
so long as the record shows the ship
ment of a carload from one consignor
to one consignee.
This system of traffic, which menaces
legitimate commerce, is not confined to
one, two or three lines of trade, but ex
tends to all lines of business. The city :
is literally swarming with agents. Res- !
ident Jobbers are now determined to
take steps to break up the practice, j
There is no Intention of proscribing j
commercial travelers or agents for
Eastern manufacturers who conduct
their mercantile operations according
to the established usages of trade, but
there is a purpose to ignore the agent
who sells directly to the retailer.
Yesterday a representative of The
Call visited the establishments of Mack
& Co., George H. Tay Company and
Miller, Slosa & Scott. All remarked
that the town was full of agents who
were soliciting orders from the retail
dealers of the city and interior towns.
"So far as this house is concerned."
remarked Mr. Scott of the last named
firm, "we do not buy goods from manu
facturing agents who sell to the retail
trade and go about the city and coun
try soliciting orders for their wares.
No agreement or compact among
wholesalers is needed. Simple observ
ance of the ordinary customs of trade
is all that is required. When we find
that an Eastern manufacturer has es
tablished an agency in San Francisco
and that the agent Insists on selling to
retail customers, we simply decline to
handle the goods of that manufacturer.
The Jobbing merchants of San Fran
cisco, In my Judgment, are able to
protect themselves. The Call, In ex
posing the system by which these man
ufacturing agents are conducting bus
iness, is rendering the mercantile com
munity service of great value."
While License Collector Bonnet Is
willing and anxious to assist the local
merchants in the fight for their rights,
he is handicapped by the existing laws.
The decisions of the higher courts are
against the imposition of a license tax
on drummers and agents representing
firms outside the State. All that he
can do Is impoÃe a merchandise license
tax on agents who are found selling
goods In broken packages. The Su
preme Court of the United States has
decided that a license tax on drum
mers soliciting sales from sample is
unconstitutional, and therein the whole
trouble exists.
There are several hundred agents of
Eastern manufacturing concerns In
this city, and as they claim that they
only solicit sales from samples there
Is no way of imposing a tax on them.
In a few instances they have been de
tected selling their "samples," and a
merchandise license tax has been im
posed on those offenders. While the
License Collector is certain that many
of the agents have the goods shipped
to them and Bell them direct, he Is
unable to secure the necessary proof
to compel them to pay a merchandise
tax license.
"The great difficulty," said Chief
Deputy Fay of the license office yester
day. "Is to catch these Eastern agents
selling from broken packages. They
claim that they only solicit orders from
sample, and that under the law they
are exempt from paying any license
tax. Tf any large quantity of goods
Is found in their possession, they claim
that the goods were shipped to them
to deliver to customers who made
purchases from samples. It Is only
when we catch them selling to a
dealer, from broken packages, that we
| can enforce the payment of a merchan
dise license. We have of late caught
several agents selling direr- 1 from their
so-called samples and forced them to
pay a license the snme as any other
retail or wholesale dealer. T'nless we
catch them selling goods from a bro
ken package, they claim that the goods
they carry have been shipped to flu
orders given from samples, and we are
powerless to act."

CORNER SIGNS
CAUSE TROUBLE
Auditor Broderick Holds
Up Several Large
Demands.
Finds No Law to Compel the
Municipality to Pay
Bills.
Property-Owners May Also. Bo Ex
empt From an Old
Law.
Auditor Broderick has decided that
the city has no right to pay for the
street signs at the crossing of thor
oughfares, and will refuse to pass de
mands, amounting to over $600, to pay
for such devices that were recently
presented by Superintendent of Streets
Ambrose.
During the time that the "Phelan"
Board of Supervisors was contesting
with the legal board for the possession
of the city government Mayor Phelan
dug up an old law enacted in 1883,
which provides that owners of all cor
ner property must designate the
names of the intersecting streets on
which their property is situated by
means of signs placed at the corner.
By virtue of this ordinance hundreds
of property-owners in outlying dis
tricts were compelled to go to the
trouble of putting up signs at their
own expense.
Recently Mr. Ambrose conceived the
idea of having the business streets of
the city similarly designated, and a
man was employed to do the work.
Such corners as the Intersection of
Grant avenue, o'Fairell and Market
streets were provided with artistic
signs at an expense to the taxpayers
of $9 per corner. This particular loca
tion happens to embrace the Phelan
building, owned by the Mayor of the
city and county of San Francisco.
When the bills, amounting to $600,
were sent to the Auditor, he took up
the statute-books, municipal reports
and other volumes of legal lore and
found only the ordinance of 1883 to
provide for corner signs. There was
nothing to show why the private prop
erty-owners In residence districts
should pay for their own signs while
the merchants downtown received
theirs at the expense of the municipal
ity. Thereupon he began the composi
tion of a letter to the Board of Super
visors explaining the why and the
wherefore of his refusal to audit the
demands.
"I fall to see the legality of these
demads for several reasons," said the
Auditor yesterday. "In the first place
it appears like special legislation to
compel property-owTyers on a corner
to put up signs while those In the mid
dle of the block are exempt. One has
as much right as the other, and the
Board of Supervisors that enacted
this ordinance evidently recognized
this point after its passage, for the
gas companies were required to desig
nate the name of streets on their
corner lamps. These 8 by 36
inch maroon and silver signs are all
very pretty, but I do not think that
the municipality or property-owners
fan be compelled to pay for them.
This matter waÃ called to my atten
tion some time ago by Judge Low, and
since then I have been looking care
fully into the law. Unless I can find
some better authority than I have at
present no demands of this kind will
be signed. Unless some check is
placed upon this matter it would be
easy to run up bills against the muni
cipality of JSOOO to $10,000."

WAS IT MURDER
OR A SUICIDE?
The Question That Causes
Coolness Between Po
lice and Coroner.
Diametrically Opposite Stories
Told About the Position of
the Body.
Both Sides Are Firm in Support of
Their Theories in the
Matter.
Did John H. Dow kill himself or was
he murdered?
This Is a question that is being
fought out by the detective force on the
one side and by the Coroner's office on
the other.
There is expert police testimony to
prove positively that it can be nothing
but a case of suicide, and then again
there is expert medical testimony to
show that it must have been a murder.
Captain Bohen says there are no de
velopments in the case which would
cause him to change his opinion that
the wounds in Dow's brain were in
flicted by the shooting gallery man.
Detectives Gibson and Crockett are so
thoroughly convinced that Dow in
flicted the wounds that they have de
cided that there is nothing further for
them to do.
At the Coroner's office there is as
positive a feeling in favor of the mur
der theory and In substantiation of this
position the autopsy is said to have
conclusively shown that after the first
ball entered the skull it would have
been impossible for Dow to have re
loaded the pistol twice and fired two
other balls Into his head. It was shown
that two of the bullets fractured the
skull and all three of them lacerated
the brain tissue to such an extent that
unconsciousness would have followed
either.
The Morgue officials say that when
the body was found It was covered
with the bed clothing, and the right
hand was under the cover and resting
naturally on the leg. They say also
that there was no blood on the hand
nor on the pistol.
Captain Bohen says that when found
the body was not covered up, and that
the right hand was hanging down at
the side of the bed, almost touching
the pistol, which lay on the floor. He

says also that the hand, as well as the
pistol, was bloody. The captain fur
ther cites numerous instances where
men have been Bhot through the brain
without being rendered unconscious,
and says that the small balls from a
22-caliber pistol would not produce
death instantly.
He further cites the fact that there
was a considerable lapse of time be
tween the firing of the first shot and
the two later ones. The detective the
ory is further strengthened by the
statement that Dow was financially
embarrassed and in ill health.
It has developed that while Dow
owed several small bills he had suf
ficient money on hand to liquidate
them, and so far as his ill health is
concerned, it is shown that he was
Thinking seriously of going to the
Klondike next spring.
Thus are the divergent theories
strengthened, and about the only tan
gible matter that has come out of the
conflict of opinion is the fact that it Is
possible to have a mysterious case of
death made deeper mystery by im
perfect care of the corpse when it Is
discovered. It has been shown that if
Captain Bohen's assertion regarding
the position of the right hand is true,
then some one must have handled tho
body and placed the hand by the side
of the dead man and covered it up
before the Morgue officials reached the
place.
Mrs. Dazel seems to Incline to the
suicide theory, but says that she will
express no opinion. She tells a straight
story regarding her going from the
shooting gallery shortly after midnight
Friday night, and says that the pistol
j which was used had been carried in
| Dow's pocket for several days prior to
| the killling. She says she sees 'no
reason to think it was a murder. She
has been released by the police, but
paid a long visit to Captain Bohen
I yesterday afternoon, and all inquirers
| were referred to her for particulars.
| She says that Dow was an expert with
! the pistol and could fire and reload it
j with great rapidity, and thinks it
would have been easy for him to have
fired the three shots.

H AS BOARDMAN GONE EAST
Probability That Ho Will Appear In
an Appeal to the Suprem*
Court.
Judge Morrow and Judge de Haven I
of the United States Court, sitting in j
bank, yesterday came to a determina- j
.tion that will act as a sedative on the i
nerves of the notorious criminal occu
pying the death chamber at San Quen- !
tin, and give him pause in his mathe- ,
matical contemplation of the hours
that separate him from the grave. This
Was the entertainment of a virtual re
petition of the previous application for
a writ of habeas corpus. General Dick
inson did not appear, on the ground
of illness. As Boardman just at pres
ent represents X, 'or the unknown
Quantity in the latest problems of Dur
rant's defenders, he was also invisible.
Mr. Deuprey, who presented the pe
:trtlon, was accompanied by General
.iDickinson's partner, J. K. Bonestell,
and the father of the condemned. The
court, to the 6urpriÃe of every one, of
fered no objection to Deuprey's re
quest, merely asking whether the
reading of the document would con
sume much time. On receiving a
negative reply Judge Morrow instruct
ed him to proceed. At the conclusion
of fifteen minutes the contents of the
document had been related. Mr. Deu
prey then urged upon the attention of
the court that the grounds on which
this last application for a writ was
made differed from those on which
previous petitions were based.
The contention raised was that the
.prisoner should not be disturbed until
the United States Court had passed upon
. an appeal alleged to be pending in con
sequence of the refusal of the clerk to
file the papers in a former application.
. vludsre Morrow benignly whispered to
â  â â¢.Judge de Haven, and then announced
} -that the matter would be taken under
: 'advisement until II o'clock this morn-

MRS. AMELIA CHURCHILL, the Victim of an Accident on Fourth Street.
Mrs. Amelia A. Churchill, a widow, 48 years of age, was struck and almost instantly killed by a southbound
car of the Ellis and O'Farrell street line on Fourth street, near Mission, at about 5 o'clock last night. Mrs.
Churchill resides at 2S*O Natoma street, where she kept a Bmall lodging-house. Last night at about 5 o"clock she
went out on an errand, saying she would be back in a few minutes. As she was crossing Fourth street she
stopped in the middle of the track to let a wagon pass in front of her. not noticing an approaching electric car. The
motorman did not see the woman until he was almost on top of her, when he rang the bell and applied the
brakes. As she was slightly deaf, in all probability she did not hear the warning, or If she did was too confused
by her danger to get out of the way. The car struck her full in the left side, turning her over completely, drag
ging her under the wheels. A crowd immediately trathered on the spot, and it was found necessary to raise
the car before the poor mangled body could be released. The body was taken into the drugstore of W. E. May
hew at 144 Fourth street and an ambulance summoned, but the surgeon pronounced the woman dead, and the
Coroner was notified. In attempting to extricate the body Guss Rapp, an etcher, 18 years of age, employed by the
Examiner, had his leg badly strained, and was taken to his home at 834 Howard street. His injuries are not
serious, but he will be unable to walk for several days. Be tells the story as follows: "I left my home to go
to work as usual at about 5 o'clock. When I turned into Fourth street I noticed a woman standing in the middle
of the track in a dazed sort of way with her side toward the car. The car was approaching slowly and the motor
man was struggling with the brakes and rinsing his bell furiously, but the woman paid no heed to it I turned
my face away as I heard a thud and saw the woman disappear under the car. If the motorman had had two
feet more to stop the car in all would have been safe, and if there had been a fender on the car it might have
picked her up without doing any harm. I could see that by the way she fell. I went to her assistance In com
pany with several others, and while they were raising the car somebody let go, and the weight of it came on
my leg. I was helped home by a couple of friends, but do not think my injuries are serious." Rapp's story was
corroborated by a number of witnesses. The car was In charge of Motorman W. Hillis and Conductor William
W. Wetemyer. both of whom surrendered themselves to the police, and were released on their own recognizance
by Captain Spillane of the Southern police station. Mrs. Churchill was a poor widow, who maintained herself by
keeping a few lodgers, and was respected as an honest, hard-working woman by those who knew her. She leaves

Cliff House on Sundays.
the annoying Insistence of Durranfa !
attorneys and of all the political re-en- ,
forcements they can muster, that a re
prieve be granted. The Governor** de- i
cision in the matter is expected some j
time to-morrow.
Should the Circuit Court deny the
petition for a writ of habeas corpus it
is said to be extremely doubtful
whether Warden Hale, acting under
advice of the Attorney-General, would
decline to execute under the notice of
appeal. The Attorney-General is at- i
credited with having, after a more |
thorough study of the complications,
changed his view as to the efncac y of !
such notice. If his present state of j
mind on the subject be reported cor- |
rectly. he would advise the Warden t<>
proceed with the execution of the order ;
of the State court, despite any inter
vening action on the part of Durrant's
attorney based on the denials in the
Circuit Court of the petition for writ.
The scientific men who are interested
In the pathological features of Dur
rant's case are grievously disappointed
at the prospect that no autopsy will l>e
allowed on the remains. Dr. John W.
Robertson, the celebrated chemist, has
received. a commission from the Ameri
can Journal of Insanity to prepare an
elaborate treatise on the case. He is
firmly impressed with the extraordin
ary character of Durrant as a study in
psychopathy, and regrets that a post
mortem examination of the head of the
condemned man cannot be made. its
I cranial conformation and the relative
I development of the cerebral convolu
| tions would prove of incalculable Inter-
I est and value to science. The fact that
j Durrant, having been well advanced as
i a medical student, should have made a
positive request that no examination
be made of his face or head after death,
! is commented on as significant.
"An autopsy would not necessarily
prove that Durrant was Insane," said
Dr. Robertson, "or that he was guilty
of the crimes charged. We have to ac
cept the legal determination of the
latter fact. Certain conditions con
firmatory of the theory of monomania,
or moral perversion, might be dis
closed in the assymmetry of the facial
bones and brain formation. These
measurements would be of great value,
while they could not be accounted as
proof of his guilt."
It seems that no measurements of
Durrant's head have been made, and
It is regarded as rather strange that
he should have been exempt from the
study common in nearly all cases of
capital crimes, and particularly in
those where the subject of satyriasis
is involved. Dr. Robertson has made
an appeal to Warden Hale to procure
at least external measnrements In ac
cordance with the formula provided.
Dr. W. H. Mays is equally interested
with other cerebral specialists in se
curing for the records of American
medical Jurisprudence a record of the
external and Internal formations <>f
Durrant's head. "It would be Im
portant to know the relative develop
ment of the cerebral convolutions,"
said he. "Much might be inferred
from the measurements and condition
of the two parts. Degeneracy of the hu
man brain is readily determined in this
manner, inasmuch as the left side in
the normal man shows excess of size
over the right. In human degeneracy
the brain tends to a similitude and
perfection of formation which Is the
characteristic of animals. It Is to be
regretted that an autopsy could not be
held in this case."

tion, for some reason that is inex
plicable to Rochfort and to many
others, who regret to see the parent
fishes of one of the most prolific trout
â treama in the State destroyed by un
lawful means.
It is a well-known fact that the To
males Bay fishermen use only such
nets as are employed for the capture
of small bay fishes, the meshes of
which are exceedingly close when
drawn together. It is not thought that
the fishermen have gone to the ex
jii !isi j of purchasing a salmon net or
n. ts that are of lawful dimension
when the nets of smaller size can do
h.ii'-r execution.
It is, however, the duty of the Fish
Commissioners to dispatch a deputy
to Inverness on a tour of inspection,
as the law reads that the Fish Com
missioners must see that the laws for
the preservation of fish and game are
strictly enforced, and for that purpose
they may from time to time employ
such assistants as they shall deem
necessary.
The law as regards netting is easily
understood. It reads:
Every person who buys, sells, offers or
exposes for sale any steelhead trout
CSalmo Gnirdneri) between the Ist day of
February and the lHt day of May 'of each
year Is guilty of a misdemeanor; pro
vided, however, that â  steelhead trout
may be taken In tide water between
the Ist day of May and the Ist day of
February of the following year with law
ful nets; and a lawful net shall mean a
net that when placed in the water is un
secured and free to float with the cur
rent or tide; and the meshes of which
are. when drawn closely, together and
measured Inside the knot, not less than
seven and one-half Inches in length.
Every person found guilty of any vlota
tlon of the provisions of this section may
be fined or imprisoned.
Last Sunday several anglers visited
Inverness for the purpose of seeing
the fishermen seining fishes. In one
haul of the net they landed thirty-four
steelhead which were shipped from
Hamlet station to this city. If each
haul returns a like complement of
fishes there will, certainly, be very few
fishes left to populate the Paper-mill
Creek this year, and anglers only too
well realize what that will signify.
Last Sunday night while Messrs.
Babcock and Vogelsang were discuss
ing in a hotel at Duncan's Mills the
sport they enjoyed on the river in
catching trout with rod and line, the
net fishermen were industriously em
ployed netting steelheada from a pool.
In the river not 400 yards distant from
the hotel.
Confederates were stationed to keep
a watch on the movements of the Ang
ling Commissioners while the work of
fish destruction was going on by the
light of the moon.
But Commissioner Vogelsang was
not sleeping; he had already planned
the capture of the lfw-breakera and
had stationed Deputies Davis and
Lowe at a point where they could
watch the actions of the net fisher
men. The officers remained under
cover until a late hour when they
were rewarded for thetr j>ains by the
capture r.f a first-class net which the
seiners had placed In the river almost
immediately under the DOMI of the
deputies.
The fishermen beat a hasty retreat
when they detected the officers, but
as they are known doubtless arrests
Will follow.
The anglers who visited Duncan's
Mills last week had grand sport. One
hundred and four su-elrnads were ta
ken on Saturday and Sun lay with rod
and line, and some of the most fortu
nate anglers are: A. Vogelsang, 7
fish; J. P. Babcock, 12 fish: W. Baehe
ler. 6 fish; Captain Qeorge Cummlng
hooked 12 fish and lost six. J. Searls
caught 2 fish. John Butler hooked and
lost 5 fish on Sunday and caught 3 on
Monday, Charles Green caught 3 fish,
George Walker caught 2 fish, W. A.
r naught ."> fis-h. McFarland and
Wilson have caught within the last
two weeks over fifty fish. The aver
age weight of the sieelheads of Rus
sian Riwr iF sixteen pounds.
The bar at the mouth of the river
closed again on Friday last, thus af
fording the steelheads that were lodg
ing In the deep pools near Duncan's
Mills an opportunity to ascend the
river.

CURIOS FOR THE
MINING FAIR
Extensive Preparations for
a Most Elaborate
Exhibition.
Artists and Carpenters to Take
Possession of the Pavil
ion To-Day.
Telegrams From Interior Counties
Tell of Large Appropria
tions.
The headquarters of the Golden Jubi
lee Mining Fair will be transferred to
the Mechanics" Pavilion to-day, and
the entire staff of officers will at once
begin the task of Installing the ex
hibits.
The Pavilion was thrown open yes
terday for the reception of goods, and
an army of carpenters, scenic artists
and workmen took possession of the
building and prepared to g'X every ex
hibit Into shape In anticipation of
opening day, which is yet three weeks
off.
Never In the history of San Francisco
will there be a more characteristic ex
hibition of the products of California
than will be presented in the mining
fair.
There will be all kinds of freak shows
and things that will delight the popu
lar mind. One firm alone has taken a
space 30x40 feet, where it will com
mence the erection of a log cabin, such
as Is found in the Klondike country,
and in this will be maintained a regu
lar old-fashioned outfitting store,
where goods will be shown just as they
are displayed on the arrival of a
steamer on the Yukon.
Up near the exhibit of the North
Bloomfleld Mining Company a space of
about 3000 square feet has been re
served for the Dawson City Theater,
where will be a repliqua of the most
famous dance held In that far away
northern town. Every evening min
strel performances, by celebrities from
Alaska, will b*> presented, and artists
intending to make a tour of the coun
try will be afforded an opportunity to
present themselves to the public and
secure the verdict of the San Fran
cisco audience before proceeding north
ward.
Manager Benjamin of the mining de
partment announces that all the space
assigned to the mining counties has
been filled. Telegrams came piling in
y.PtÂ»rday from all the mining counties
announcing subscriptions to make
creditable displays. The Boards of Su
pervisors of the various counties met
on Monday and, without exception,
granted the wishes of their constitu
ents regarding the desired approprla
, tions.
Among the dispatches received last
evening were these from Amador and
Nevada counties:

; pervisors has appropriated $250 In aid
or the golden jubilee.
NEVADA. Cal., Jan. 4â The Board
of Supervisors to-day appropriated

whether it might not be given to private
i parties and paid for with funds now in

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ares at station indicate maximum temperature
for the days: those underneath it. If any. the
amount or rainfall, of molted snow in Inches
und hundredths during the past twelve hours,
{sobars. or solid lines, connect points of equal
Hr pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The wind "high"" meaas high
barometic pressure and is usually accompanied
with fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
By cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the Interior and low
â Jong the coa.Â«t. and (he isobars extend uorth
ard ro'.ith along the coast, rain is probable;
but -.hen the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
â¢n.irkec. curvature, rain south of Oreg-on i* im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idah'>. and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be eipected
In s.ummer and colder weather in winter. The
re\-erpe of these conditions will produce an
oppovit* result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK. Jan. 4.-Prlces of utock showed
ft further decline to-day, and there was noth- !
ing: to indicate that the decline was due to any '
other cause than the preponderance of those
who desired to se'.l rver those who desired to <
buy. There waÂ» some short selling by the
professional bears, but no marked recuperation '
such as would he caused by the covering of 'â 
Bhorts was manifest, and the bears. If they <
EÂ«ild, were apparently content to leave their
contracts open. The specialties continued to j
absorb the largest share of business. The !
market showed a broader tendency and the li- i
quidation extended more generally through the I
Hat. Net losses of a large fraction are gen- '
eral throughout the list, and a number of :
prominent specialties and railroad stock*, no- !
tably among Southern and Southwestern roads i
and the coalers, show net losses of a point or '
over "iesteraays flurry ln the money market
wnlch carried rates up to 6 per cent was not I
r-peated to-day, but rates were firm and the
largest part of the day's transactions waÂ«
made at 4 per cent, with exceptions at 3Â« per '

that the January Interest disbursement* result
ed in the transfer of a little over $4,000,000 from

which j. Is to be . covered into the treasury in

there were evidently he-ivy banking operations
In addition quite sufficient to account for the '
flurry ln the money market yesterday. In view
of the proportionately umall surplus reserve
there are not such confident predictions heard
of an immediate easing of the rates of money
as were current la;-t week, though the ex- â 
change irarkft holds firm on a demand which
is based on a presumption of lower rates for
money ln the near future.

The stock markets here were rather dull to
day, the only feature being a strong Inquiry
for Arg-cntlnes, which have risen sharply.
Americans were dull on the New York weak-

speculative activity on Argentines and mines,
with a. weather eye open to Americans, If in

Important negotiations are proceeding here

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 4â Wheat was somewhat
Irregular to begin with. There were buyers of
May at from 91VÂ» to 91H e on the start, as com
pared with 91Â»,@91^c at the close yesterday.
May very quickly began to give evidence of de
cided, weakness. About forty-five minutes after
the opening It weakened on nÂ«*ws connected
with the Argentine situation and before the
decline brought In buyers enough to stop It
the price of May was 90\iÂ£9 ( 'iS>c. The early
news was not particularly Influential either
way. Liverpool was quoted Hd lower at the
start. Indicating less weakness than was pre
vailing here. Paris was also said to be some
what lower, but the weakest feature of the
first batch of telegrams was what New York
had to cay of the selling by foreigners. The
Continent wan selling, they said, and buying
orders from France said to have been already
limited to a price below the market were re
ported canceled this morning. Then It was
said the foreign selling and French cancella
tions were because of heavy offerings of Ar
gentine wheat for early shipment. The Con
tinental cablegrams were weak In tone. Ant
werp quoted freer offerings from Argentina as
the reason for declining. May made a dip to
9P%c on this. Bradstreefs made the world's
increase for the week 1.835, 000 bushels, all but
400.000 buÃhels of it on this side. In the after
noon New York reported fifty-five boat loads
taken for export and Infused some needed
strength into the trade. May rallied to 91
where it was quoted at the close.
Corn acted weak most of the day, but be
came fairly strong near the end. May closing
a r hade higher.
Oats were weak, elevator people selling Tery
freely. May closed a shade lower.
Provisions were weak from the start. The
clone was weak. May pork, 12Vjc lower; May
lard. 10c lower, nnd May ribs. 7>â¢c lower.

PARK FIASCO
The Whole Matter Now
Regarded as a
Job.
Confidence of the Public in the
Scheme Has Been Dis
sipated.
Too Much Suspicion to Make It Likely
That There Will Be Any
Result.
â¢-â¢â . . Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
'~.-J\ . â¢ 908 Broadway, Jan. 4.
f.\ V 'After last night's proceeding's of the
'."' /City Council it is very apparent that
. Oakland will have no public park as
?"â¢ (he result of the present unhealthy
: â  apitatinn.
V fKo one doubts for a moment that a
'â jcity of this size should have a large
:. .ornamental tract where its inhabitants
'.'can enjoy themselves. San Francisco
-V.has derived much of its popularity
I -Jrom the manifold attractions of Gold
â  ieji "Gate Park. By possession of a sim
â¢;.'ilar playground Oakland would also
i. obtain equal valuable notoriety abroad,
r.-V-vAs a matter of fact, at the present
...time Oaklanders d<Â» not feel the need
: ';6i a public park as they otherwise
â¢':.>..jvould were they removed farther from
".I; the beautiful surroundings from the
I/.', 'foothills. No piece of property can be
â .: jpbtaine'l at the present time to which
V; the public could go, unless they paid
; .car fare. As it is only a nickel from
:: *.jO.akland to Berkeley or Alameda, it
..stands to reason that the average per
{';'.s"&n desiring to spend a few hours in
â¢V'a./ park would have no objection to
:â â  hlaving a pleasant ride there and back
v-.-forv -.-for the same financial outlay. All
'" ; around Oakland are places which can
: 'be, reached by one car fare, and, conse- :
: tiuently, the people are not at all anx
jous for a park, although a crowd of
... rv.'il estate men are decidedly anxious
.â¢â¢ â¢â¢ that one should be purchased by the
â¢ city.
â¢l'-When the present agitation started
â¢:â¢ it was thought that a tract could be
â¢ 'bought at a reasonable figure and that
â¢". .the people would vote for bonds to
; purchase it. Since that time, how
â  ever, all manner of schemes have been
1 thrown out by antagonistic parties,
until the general public is thoroughly
. : ..disgusted with the whole matter.
'" â¢". Prices . have wavered as it was
; thought the public pocket could be
. reached, people who have no claim on
â¢ : the confidence of the citizens have ap
peared in various roles which would
dtepel rather than invite co-operation
â  and rumors of crooked work have been
... p l o rife that it would be an impossibil
',7Â« Ity at this time to convince the pub
: â¢ ..lie that a park could be bought with
: out the consummation of what is po
.litically called a "steal."
.â¢ " Many of the parties have doubtless
Â '..made their offers in good faith, but
'.the competition has become so heated
â¢ ; 'and acrimonious that no one knows
â¢:â¢ Just what to believe or what to dls
â¢ card. It is clear, however, that all in
â¢ -.terest in purchasing a park has ended
' and that all further efforts at this time
. will be useless. â¢ .
.. The cry that Oakland must have a
f . .park somewhere near the center of the
i city has little to recommend it, for the
'. city is so rapidly growing northward
and westward that its center five years
; ' asr'-> is far removed from where it is to
.;. day, and will be still farther removed
;' from its present position five years
v : hence. Under the existing conditions
: ,the only matter by which a park could
â ;â¢ be obtained in the purchase of which
.. thf- public would have confidence, Is by
â j .condemnation proceedings, which is a
â â  "lengthy, costly and on the whole un
â¢fj satisfactory course to pursue, because
â¢/â¢'by the time a conclusion would be
: : .reached the people would be more tired
'â¢of the project than they are now.
; '. ! There are so many schemes for parks
and chains of parks and scenic drive
â¢ ways and picturesque boulevards now
before the Council that each of the
eleven members may be said to favor
a different one, and as it takes six
â  votes to submit any proposition to the
people, and eight if the Mayor should
"..veto the ordinance, it can readily be
â¢ seen that the park incident of 1897 has
already practically passed into history,
â  : leaving the Fame record as the twenty
fj two other annual park fiascos which
Auditor Snow said recently he has ob
â¢ served since he came to this city.
' . The matter may drag along for a
fr-w weeks, but it is now really as dead
"â¢Jn public interest as it is in the opinion
. of the honorable member from the
â¢ 'Second Ward.
WHY HAMMOND
STRUCK BANTEL
Aftermath of the Row Between
Two School Di
rectors.
Heard That Derogatory Remarks
Had Been Made About
Teachers.
The row between School Directors
I'ammond and Bantel that ended in a
nai encounter on Monday ntter
noon, though apparently smoothed
by the love feast that was held
.it the residence of President Barring
ton on Monday night, still rankles in
Hit breast of at least one of the Di
â  ra.
Mr. Hammond believes that he his
not been fairly dealt with by Mr.
Bantel, find that he was justified in
taking the action he did in the board
â  on Monday afternoon. Mr. Ham
nas been one of Director Bantel's
( hi^f supporters in the board when the
latter had any fav<rr to ask. It was
ecauae he asked a return favor and
ime was not readily forthcoming
that the trouble arose.
Mr. Hammond also has another
ground for feeling aggrieved at Mr.
ntfeL Reports have come to his #ars
Bantel has been making derogu
tbry re marks regarding the teachers of
the department. If there is any one
man in the School Board who is ready
at ;tll times to take up the cudgel in
defense nf the- teachers it is Director
Hammond, and the rumor of Bantel'f
remarks aroused his temper to no
.small degree.
lie saya nf- has absolute proof that
! <li<i make the remarks that were
attributed to him, and, if necessary,
will bring a dozen witnesses to sub-
Btantiate the charge. On this ground,
also, he feels that he was justified In
giving his fellow-Director a shaking
Director Hammond is not given to
talkuig, and what he said about the
matter was not uttered for publ'ca
tion, but was told to friends to explain
his encounter with Bantel. It is prob
able the matter will go no further, :iÂ«
fellaw-members have prevailed upon
the two Directors to patch up their
differences and at least appear as
friends.
A MINIATURE WOMAN.
Chiquita Greets the Members of
the Press at a Receptioo Last
Night.
A living doll is the little Chiqaita
who gave a to the press at
the maple room of the Palace Hotel
| last night. She weighs but fifteen
pounds and is only twenty-six inches
high. Just the smallest bit of a thing.
The room was crowded with society
people and the Little One sat in her
little doll chair and entertained the
; assembly. She is a little Cuban and
! was born twenty-seven years ago. She
is pretty and every feature is perfect,
despite the smallness of her physique.
i She sang and danced for those present
and at the end gave them all a picture
with her autograph.
Supervisor Kottanzi was one of those
j present, but the Dr. had a grievance
1 all evening in that the ladies did not
! remove their hats and consequently he
' could not see the midget. He had no
remedy, as the matter was purely a
i social affair.
Chiquita may open at one of the
! theaters here in the city, but it is not
decided yet.
During the evening she drove around
the maple room in a little hack built
â  especially for her and drawn by a Shet
i land pony, the hack not being over
L three feet high.
THE FETE IS
THE REAL THING
Fashion and Beauty Make the
Columbia Pageant a
Success.
Gold Is Expected In Plenty to Re
plenish the Hospital Cof
fers.
The success of the Columbia pageant
continues.
The auditorium of the California
Theater last evening was crowded, the
assemblage quite fashionable and the
house as brilliant and dressy as the
one that lent its presence at the open
ing night of the charitable fete. Con
sequently the heart of the management
is glad, and the performersâ all fash
ionable amateurs with the interests of
the Children's Hospital very near and
dear to them â basked in the warm
smiles of the management and went to
work with renewed zeal.
In many respects the performance
! last evening excelled that of the open
; ing night. The long waits between the
â  acts were but a memory of the past,
I and many of the minor features that
I only tended to lengthen the pageant,
! while not adding either to the interest
lor the beauty of the representation,
j were entirely done away with.
As on the opening evening the enthu
siasm of the audience was unbounded.
Each picture was warmly applauded,
and fair Columbia, in private life,
Mrs. Martin Schultz, received several

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1898.
DUNN MEETS
HIS WATERLOO
"Inner Circle" Men Are
Practically Vindi
cated.
Total Defeat Warded Off by
Mr. Fredericks' Verbal
"Spud."
A Little Soothing Syrup in the Re
port â The Vote on Suspension
Avoided.
The eight members of the so-called
"inner circle," accused by President
Dunn of the San Francisco Commer
cial Travelers of conspiring against the
peace of mind of those shut out from
the sacred band stand forth morally
vindicated of the charges preferred
against them by the report of the
court of inquiry. The San Francisco
men met in regular session last night
in Seven Pines Hall of the Alcazar
building, and the first thing to come up
was the report mentioned. It was read
by Chairman Moscrop.
In brief the "solid eight" were exon
i crated of the charges and the recom
mendation made that they be rein
stated into membership. This was the
majority report and contained a clause
' to the effect that the president was.
perhaps, warranted in bringing the
charges, a natural insertion on account
of the fact that the committee was of
Dunn's own selection. The minority
report by L. L. Dobbs simply stated
that either a verdict of acquittal of the
charges or conviction should be agreed
on. This was expected and created no
; surprise.
Hardly was the report made when
Dunn vacated the chair and placed
; therein Harry Becker. His selection
was wise, as Dunn managed to get cer
tain things postponed that might
otherwise have carried.
Dunn then objected strenuously to re
ceiving and accepting the report of his
own committee. He went over the
whole of the evidence, and asserted
that if the men were reinstated the
papers would "roast" him, and begged
that it be rejected. Hours were con
sumed in a heated argument pro and
con, the accused men saying nothing
beyond the fact that, although they
had denied the jurisdiction of the com
mittee, they were willing to abide by
its decision.
Finally Harry Roessler moved that
the report be accepted, and it was done,
practically unanimously. Then he moved
that in accordance with the recommen
dation of the committee the men be re
instated. Dunn again, supported by
others, fought against this. When the
confusion reached fever heat it was
partly allayed by Fredericks, Dunn's
right bower, yelling vociferously for
order. The chair did not bring the mat
ter to a vote, as the previous one
showed that the motion would in all
probability carry.
Fredericks finally threw a verbal
"spud" into the meeting by moving to
adjourn at a time when the hour was
late and everybody tired. It carried,
and the matter of reinstatement was
postponed until the meeting two
weeks from last nipht. when proper
reinforcements can be brought to th.
aid of those who have met defeat so
far.
The California Commercial Travel
ers' Association has decided to launch
out socially, not only for the purpose
of providing an occasional pleasant
evening for the members and friends,
but also to provide a fund for the
widows and orphans. The first ven
ture will be made on next Monday
evening at Native Sons' Hall, and a
veritable feast of good things has
been provided.
CHINA TRAVEL
INCREASING
Pacific Mail's Annual Report
of Traffic to the
Orient.
San Francisco More Than Holds Her
Own in Trans- Pacific Com
petition.
The regular annual report of the
passenger business done by the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company was filed
yesterday with the Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers, to be forwarded by them
to the proper authorities at Washing
ton.
The report is remarkable, inasmuch
as it shows an increase in travel be
tween this country and the Orient
which is little less than phenomenal.
The approximate number of passen
gers carried both to and from China
and Japan during the year was 12,000,
which is an increase of over 25 per
cent on the previous year and 40 per
cent more than the number handled
for the corresponding trips during the
same seasons of the year 1895.
Though the report does not distin
guish between cabin and steerage and
white and Mongolian passengers, yet
it is a fact that the bulk of the in
crease has been in the cabin and con
sists of the very best class of tourist
travel.
During the previous years the ves
sels of the Pacific Mail touching at the
Hawaiian Islands have always had a
passenger list much larger than those
vessels bound straight through to Yo
kohama. Last year, however, there
was no perceptible difference, the ves
sels going right across carrying fully
as many passengers as those touching
at the inlands. This is thought to be
due to the increase of our commercial
relations with China and Japan and
the number of those whose business
interests make a trip across the Pa
cific necessary.
Though the Canadian Pacific has
done a larger passenger business dur
ing the last year, yet it only amounts
to about, one-half the travel outward
and inward at this port, and the ratio
of increase here is far in excess of that
on the more northern line.
This is supposed to be due to the
shorter time between this city and thÂ«-
Atlantic coast and to the reputation of
California's climate.
BIG MONEY IN COURSING
Valuable Prizes Trjat Are Offered
by the Irjgleside Coursing
ParK.
The regular monthly meeting of the
InterpfaU Coursing Club was held last
evening at Pythian Hall. The new
members elected are: George J. Pan
ario, H. A. Denkleman, John Maher,
Hugh Lynch and Charles L. Willet.
The manager of the Interstate Cours
ing Park agreeably surprised the mem
bers cf the club by the announcement
that the prizes for this year would be
increased as tollowa by the park: Three
hundred and twenty-five dollars for a
thirty- two old dog stake, to be run on the
first Sunday of each month, and the

dog puppy Btake; $75 for a twelve dog
puppy stake; $f.O for an eight dog
puppy stake; $200 open stake for beaten
dogs, to be run on the third Sunday of
each month, the entrance fee to he
$2 f.O; $250 for all other open stakes that
are run during the month, with an en
trance fee of $2 50; $550 will be added
by the park to the prizes that will be
run for on February 2 on the occason
of the grand annual coursing meeting
for the John Grace cup, which is in it
self a prize well worth having.
It was stated at the meeting of last
evening that dogs winning one course
will have their entrance fee returned
out of the added money.
The liberality of M. J. Donovan, di
rector-general of the Ingleslde Park,
was highly commented upon by the
leashmen, who extended tho great pro
moter of the grand old sport of cours
ing a vote of thanks and many well
wishes.
On Tuesday night the annual meet
ing of the club will be held. Officers
will then be elected, and much business
of importance will be transacted.
TROUBLES ENDED
WITH A BULLET
George J. Smith Preferred Death
to Further Suffer
ing.
Calmly Prepared for the Future and
Then Deliberately Shot
Himself.
After calmly bidding hie employes
good-night George J. Smith locked the
door of his office, sat down and in a
firm hand wrote a few final instruc
tions to his friends, then took his re
volver and put a bullet in his heart.
Smith was well known in this city
and has attained considerable promi
nence both in his business capacity and
as a politician. For some time he has
been suffering from rheumatism, and is
said to have made the remark that if
he could not be cured he would soon
end his life. Monday evening, as his
employes left him they noticed noth
ing unusual in his demeanor. When
Joseph McKenna, a young man in
Smith's employ, opened the office yes
terday morning he was horrified to find
the body of his employer lying on the
floor beside his chair. Beside him was
a 42-caliber Colt revolver, with one
empty chamber â this told the story.
On the desk near at hand was the fol
lowing note, addressed to his son
Henry:
January 3, '98.
Careara's. Including to-day, $3f13 39;
General Clunto's, up to date, fll!Â» 00; Robt.
Fry's l>il! is pent. Hake's mom'y is in

at once. I have tried to think of every*
thing, but it's dollars to doughnutt 1 for
get the most important. Toll your mother
to advise only with John and Jim Tr<-a<l
w< 11. (jiv<- Charlie my pipe, he admires
it. Consult Mr. JLl^yd about the will.
Good-by.
It is supposed that the deed was com
mitted early in the evening, as the
body was stiff and cold when found.
Smith was thought to have been in good
circumstances financially, as he owned
considerable property, both in this city,
and Sonoma County.
He was born in New York State
about sixty years ago and served in the
I'nion army during the civ.l war. He
was in at least thirty battles and was
wounded in the leg on the Held of An
tietam. At the close of the war he
came to California and went into busi
ness as a painter and decorator. He 1
then became acquainted with John
Treadwell and staked him for the mine
which made Treadwell wealthy. Later
both he and Treadwell were injured in
an elevator belonging to Whlttier, Ful
l'-r & Co., and their suit for damages
was in the courts seven years when a
judgment was finally rendered, giving
Treadwell $14,000 and Smith $38,000.
Smith was a member of the Masonic
order and several other fraternal or
ganizations. He leaves a widow and
family at 46 Cook street.
DURRANT CONFIDENT.
Hope Revives, but the Rope Is
Being Well Tested Never
theless.
SAX QUENTIN PRISON, Cal., Jan. 4.
âMany of the prison officials had
strong doubts to-day of the hangman
leading Durrant to the scaffold on Fri
day. The doubts were based on the
fact that Judges Morrow and De
Haven had even entertained a motion
for a writ of habeas corpus in view of
their action in previous appeals of a
like nature. Durrant. after he had
heard the news, said he would not go to
the death trap on Friday and one of his
attorneys. Eugene Deuprey, who called
on the condemned man during the af
ternoon, confidently told several of the
prison guards that he would make sev
eral trips to San Quentin after this
week, and each time he would see his
e'.ient. Mrs. Durrant, the nvnher of the
murderer, who was also a visitor to the
deatb chamber during the afternoon,
Â£nid her hopes had been eh*Â«red by tho
action of the court, and she, like her
son and the attorney, was strongly of
the opinion that there would bo no cxc-
CUtfcn within the walls of t*v: prison
on the day set by Judge r.uhrs for the
death of W. H. T. Durrant.
In spite of these assertions that a
stay of execution will be grant.nl by the
courts, the warden of the prison and
his deputies are putting the scaffold
in readiness and completing the other
arrangements for inflicting the death
penalty. The rope, that was under the
stretching process to prepare it for tho
execution of the murderer two years
ago, was examined again to-day and in
all its twenty feÂ«t of length it has not
a quarter of an inch of spring in it.
Th<' hangman pronounced the rope to
be well stretched, and to-morrow it
will be put in place over the trap and
the noose made ready for the doomed
man's neck.

IN THE REALTY
BROKER'S REALM
The Plymouth Hotel Sold
to Frederick Till
mann Jr.
A. M. Speck & Co. Consummate
Two Good-Sized Trans
actions.
W alter S. Dean Disposes of His Stable
Property on Geary and Leav
en worth Streets.
The new year has opened up most
auspiciously In the real estate world
and several large transactions have re
cently been consummated that will
have a most encouraging tendency on
those investors troubled with a timid
heart.
Last Friday afternoon the sale of the
property on the northeast corner of
Bush and Jones streets, by Louis A.
Berteling to Frederick Tillmann Jr., was
placed on record. Madison & Burke
acted as the brokers in the sale and the
price raid was in the region of $60,00 C
The property fronts 137:6 feet on Jones
street and 60 on Bush, the improve
ments consisting of the Plymouth Ho
tel, a four-story building, and three
flats on Jones street, worth about
$30,000. The rentals amount to about
$550 a month.
Two of the largest of recent sales
have been conducted by A. M. Speck &
Co. One consists of a lot 137:6x137:6,
on the northwest corner of Golden
Gate avenue and Steiner street. The
improvements consist of eight houses
of seven rooms each, with bath and
basement. The property was sold by
the Sharon Estate Company to Edwin
H. Mozart, the milliner at Sixth and
Market streets, and the price is given
at $45,000, a pure cash transaction.
Mozart will make certain improve
ments and hold the property as a
source of revenue.
The other large sale conducted by
Speck & Co. was of the property on the
north line of Ellis street. 55 feet west
of Jones. The lot is 52x120 to the rear
street and has on it the foundation for
an extensive apartment house, costing
over $5000. Joseph Hume, the canning
man, was the seller, and the buyer was
S. L. Sly, an Oakland speculator. The
Belling price of the property was about
$35,000. it being almost a cash trans
action. Sly will make extensive im
provements at once.
Another good sized sale is of the
property on the southeast corner of
Geary and Leavenworth streets, by
Walter S. Dean, to a customer of
Shainwald, Buckbee & Co., for a re
ported price of $30,000. The lot fronts
56:6 feet on Geary street and 110 on
Leavenworth, and has on it a stable
with hall above, bringing in a monthly
rental of $175.
Dealers do not predict an immediate
appreciation in the values of property
for the year on account of the fact that
so much property is now on the mar
ket, but this will come in time. There
is no doubt of the fact that last year
was an improvement on the year pre
ceding, so far as the volume of busi
ness transacted was concerned, and the
outlook now is very favorable. Build
ing improvements have certainly been
disappointing, but the reasons for this
unfavorable fact have of late disap
peared largely and better news will
doubtless be heard in that line also.
The inquiry for country property is
something tremendous, both for homes
and stock ranches, which shows that
the general upward trend of the mar
ket extends over the whole State.
IN BLACK AND WHITE.
The records show the number of
mortgages for the weeic to be fifty-two,
aggregating the sum of $144,329. For
the same period thirty releases passed
to record, amounting to $122,991. The
following were the principal mort-

The record of last year for auction sales
wns a good one. The outlook for the pres
ent seems to be still better. Three firms
have already catalogues for the latter
part of the month prepared, and it Is
likely that several more will enter tho
arena before the month closes. All those
scheduled liavo been ment'oned previous
ly in these columns. If the prices offered
are satisfactory there can be little doubt
that auction sales will grow to be a spe
cial feature.

WILL MOVE FOR
A REHEARING
John L. Boone Dissatisfied With
the Decree of the
Courts.
Claims He Was Deceived Regarding
the Evidence to Be Used,
Against Him.
John L. Boone, who was recently
disbarred by the Supreme Court for
unprofesslon.il conduct in connection
with the Bowers patents, Is dissatis
fied with the actions of that body and
will next Monday have a motion made
for a rehearing of the case. The notice
was filed yesterday afternoon, together
with an affidavit. Mr. Boone claims
"that the court misled and deceived
the respondent in the preliminary
part of said proceedings by holding
that it had no right to go behind the
contract and release, and afterward at
the hearing, without further notice
to respondent's counsel, ignoring its
said ruling and basing its decision on
matters that occurred prior to the con
tract and release."
In the affidavit he goes over the case
fully and then comes out with the alle
gation that the decision of the court
was made more on account of things
which transpired prior to the contract
and release. He says:
"That relying on the said statement
of the court and believing that no im
portance would be given to tfie facts
and circumstances which transpired
prior to the contract and release af
fiant failed to give said matters in de
tail as fully as he otherwise would
have done, and neglected to place in
evidence certain facts corroborative of
his testimony, which he otherwise
would have done if he had known that
the court intended to consider and
pass upon the testimony relating to
said prior matter; that notwithstand
ing said statement by the court it did,
fn rendering its opinion and decision,
herein consider and did practically
base and form its opinion on said prior
transactions, and the proof thereof
which affiant was so misled into keep
ing back so far as he could, thinking
that thereby he would act more con
servatively as the former attorney of
said Bowers, and would appear more
consistent in the eyes of the public and
this court."
He also makes a claim of new evi
dence, which could not be obtained at
the time of the former trial.

TORSIDA WAS
EASILY BEATEN
The Match Race in the
Nature of a Gift for
Eddie Jones.
The Roman Defeated Fleur de
Lis and Made a Track
Record.
Chappie First at 8O to Iâ Oarland
Barr Scored in a Hard
Drive.
It is more than probable that the
Burns & Waterhouse stable thinks it
self entitled to a gTeat big "kick." On
New Year's day Eddie Jones, the sta
ble's crack Morello colt, defeated Tor-
Bida in a seven-furlong run, for which
the latter went to the post a strongly
supported favorite. It was dusk when
the race was run, and when the horses
returned to the 6tand Piggott on Tor-
Bida claimed that Thorpe, astride the
winner, deliberately cut him off a fur
long from the wire. The claim of foul
was allowed, and, under the recently
created rule, Eddie Jones was placed
second and the race given to Torsida.
As a result of the ruling the pair were
matched for $750 a side, the race to be
run under the same conditions as gov
erned the New Tear's day race. The
match was decided at Ingleside yester
day at 1 o'clock, and the son of Morello
administered a sound and decisive
drubbing to the filly. . In the betting
the Burns <Sr Waterhouse entry was
favorite, the bookmakers doing busi
ness, holding him at 7 to 10, with 6 to 5
against the other. As Ed Corrigan
would not permit Piggott to ride. Henry
Shields piloted Torsida. Starter Cald
well dispatched the pair to a perfect
break. Eddie Jones skipped to the
front, and, never extended, won in a
gallop, traveling the route in the fast
time of 1:27 flat. The winner is still
eilgible to start in maiden races.
It was rather a pleasant day for out
siders, Einstein. Chappie, Miss Ross
and Garland Barr all turning up win
ners at very remunerative odds.
The most notable performance of tho
afternoon was that of The Roman, in
the mile and a furlong handicap, the
sturdy son of Brutus reducing the
track record one and a hair seconds,
the mark now to shoot at being 1:5314.
He was an 11 to 5 choice in the ring,
with Willie Martin in the saddle, and
it took all of that polished rider's
ekill to land his mount winner from
Fleur de Lis, Stemler's fast mare suc
cumbing only by a neck in a long,
hard drive. She was as good as 10 to 1
In the betting and was heavily backed.
Tom BromweH, the second choice, was
a poor third in front of Grady, Double
Quick and Los Prietos.
The Corrigan colors were borne to
the front in the opening six-furlong
eprint of Einstein, against which the
books laid 5 to 1 opening. The colt was
plugged in the betting and galloping
over his field won as he pleased from
Duke of York 11.
The last performance of Kaiser Lud
wig was nothing to gloat over, but
Tom Griffin's horse seemed to be Just
about the real thing in the second
event yesterday. With odds of 6 to 1
about him in the betting, he collared
Torsir.o in the stretch and looked to
have the race well in hand, when
Gray, on the 30 to 1 shot Chappie ap
parently caught Clawson. on the iead
er napping and snatched the race by
c head. The fWd was a large one and
tho winner was neglected in the bet
ti n st.
Miss Ross was another one that was
allowed to perambulate in the betting
without being accorded much support

mes, a
a...-: :
Time. 1:27.
Won easily.
Winner, Burn* * Waterhouse'a br. c. hy MoreUo-Earfy Rom. Good start.
One of ten starters In the fourth event
at six furlongs, she went over to the
post an 8 to 1- chance with Thorpe in
the saddle, and, overtaking George
Miller at the head of the stretch, led
Harry Thoburn out less than a length
at the wire. George Miller was again
made a favorite, but his suspicious legs
must have given him trouble, for the
old favorite stopped badly in the run
home.
On paper the mile selling run looked
a certainty for Shasta Water, and she
was plunged on at the short price of
7to 10. The mare must have been out
of sorts, for Clawson was unable to
make her raise a r^lop- Myth, with
Midget O'Connor in the saddle, led the
bunch to within a few yards of the
wire, where Conley got up with Gar
land Barr. and in a hard drive got the
decision by a head. George Lee easily
downed the first choice for the show.
The Baldwin entry, San Venado, took
the final six-furlong sprint In a
drive from Glorian. The winner ruled
a 5 to 2 favorite, and, leading from the
start, won out by a head at the wire.

Judge Seawell Yesterday Decided
That the Policy oi) the Life of
G. D. A.Crosble Is Worthless.
Judge Seawell filed an opinion In fa
vor of the Pacific Mutual Life Insur
ance Company yesterday In an action
I brought against the company to re
j cover $10,000 on an accident insurance
j policy held on the life of George Doug
| las Atcherly Crosbie.
While out rabbit-hunting in June,
1892. Crosbie was fatally shot, it is
supposed accidentally. A short time
afterward . a grandmother .of the de
ceased, who lives in England, put in a
claim for the amount of the policy, but
payment was refused. The claim was
later assigned to John Jenkins for the
purpose of bringing the action decid
ed yesterday. In the trial of. the case
the only support in proof that Crosbie's
death was accidental, and not suicidal,
were statements made by him on his
deathbed, such as, "I shot mypelf by
accident" and "The gun went off and
shot me." Judge Seawell held that the
burden of establishing the manner in
which Crosbie met his death rested on
i the side of the plaintiff, and as he had
failed in the attempt Judgment must
be given against him.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1898.
GETTING THEIR
SUPPLIES READY
Many Alaska Parties Are Now
Outfitting in This
City.
Largo Companies In the East Have
Their Representatives
The Alaska trade committee has oti
Its register-book over 1000 names of
people who are going to the Klondike
in the spring from outside the city.
This list of names is open to all sub
scribers to the committee, and can be
had by applying at the bureau in the
ferry building.
Yesterday the number registered
was seventy, and in most instances
the persons who registered their
names were merely representative^of
larger parties which are already pre-
paring to go to Alaska. In addition to
this about twenty-five letters were
received containing inquiries about
transportation and the cost of outfits
in San Francisco. One large party in
South Dakota has written to the
Alaska trade committee saying that
it would come to the coast very
shortly, and preferred to outfit at San
Francisco, all things being equal.
An Eastern party wires that if It
can arrange to purchase 80,000 feet of
steamboat lumber here it will send a
party of sixty people to the city, all
of whom will purchase their com
plete outfit here. The telegram states
that they will need 100 tons of sup
plies and machinery, in addition to
the lumber.
Another organization of miners
wants to contract for 150 tons of
freight, F0 tons of coal and 50 passen
ger berths. These parties come from
the East, and at the present time are
making Chicago their headquarters.
They have already organized the
company, and are prepared to enter
the Yukon gold fields as soon as it is
possible to Bhlp their supplies.
The number of visitors at the ex
hibit rooms at the ferry building yes
terday far exceeded the record on any
day during the holidays. A great
many of those who have been inspect
ing the articles displayed are already
purchasing their outfits. Several of
the merchants who have subscribed
to the general fund of the Alaska
trade committee report that th^y are
beginning to feel the effects of the
liberal advertising whioh has been
done in behalf of San Francisco. The
demand for the special supplies which
enter into the outnt of every Alaska
miner is steadily increasing. And
trade in these lines is beginning to be
very active.
The bulletin board which gives the
dates of sailing and all information
relating to steamers running to
Alaskan ports is revised daily, and as
fast as word is received of the pro
posed departure of steamers for the
north it is posted on the blackboard
outside the committee's rooms. In ad
dition to the vessels which are enter
ing into this trade for the first time,
a full list is given of the regular lines
plying between San Francisco and
Dyea, Skaguay and r*opper River.
To Foreclose a Big Mortgage.
Wplls. Fargo & Co. yesterday fllod a
suit against James P. McCarthy et â !,.
which Includes as defendants in the ac
tion many corporations. capitalists
lawyers and speculators, to forecl
mortgage of over J40.0(i0 on some of the
former Stanford lamls in San Francisco.
The action was IIWMHiji to pres.-rve the
legal rights of th<- mortgagee against the
statute of limitation, and is in the na
ture of a friendly suit.

UNDER THE SHADOW
OF FRESH DISGRACE
The Bulletin Exposed as a Leech
Trying to Fatten Upon
Merchants.
Some of the Victims Will Resist, and Many
of Them Meet to Consider
Plans.
THE BULLETIN THREAT.
December 94, 1807.
Gentlemen: We will be
pleased to hare you call
and see me in reference
to your writing up which
appeared in our Indus
trial Edition aud bill
for which you have re
fused to pay at (his writ
ing. We trust that you
will sivc this matter im
mediate attention, as it
will save you consider
able trouble and incon-
venience. Truly yours.
THE BtJEJMBTUV,
Per T. I\ Boyle,
Business
For a truly good paper, not only con
scious of virtue, but inviting others to
bask in the radiance of its moral lus
ter, the Bulletin is in an awkward
predicament. It has been detected in
an attempt to swindle. It has been
exposed in a scheme as dark and
graceless as ever contrived by the ven
dor of gold bricks; a scheme of even
more sinister turpitude. A bogus gold
brick can at least be thrown at a cat. i
The Bulletin, under pretense of giving \
away space of no possible utility, real- !
ly managed to assume the aspect of
having sold it. Unblushingly it en- ;
deavored to collect, and over those
â who demurred it held a threat, some- ;
times vaguf, some-times couched in |
the curt terms known to the lawyer
about to bring suit. The lawyer is
named Jennings, and only a brief term '
ago was mentioned as having been dis- !
barred.
The spectacle of the business men of
the community meeting to confer as to
the b^st method of protecting them
selves against the imposition sought to
be practiced by the Bulletin is po un
usual as to throw a glare of light on
the situation. At the point of the focus
that discredited shevt may be observed,
now defiant, now cringing, again com
promising with one of its victim? and
begging him to regard the matter as
confidential. The tendency to enter
upon confidential relations with the
operators of the confidence game is not
marked. A man whose pocket has been
picked seldom considers himself bound
to protect the picker.
The Bulletin boasts of modern meth
ods. Robbery and Jobbery are his latest
innovation. It does not boas* of thip.
Because it will not tell the story of its
own shame, and because few would see
the story even if it were to appear in
that twilight tomb of news, the duty
devolves on anothf-r.
The tale runs thus: The Bulletin es
spyed to produce what it was pleased
to name an industrial edition. It em
braced many pages, and. as contempo
raries were kind enough to admit,
made a showing apparently excellent
THE SOLICITORS' "SPIEL."
Here's Wbat tbe "Bulletin" Required Its
BunKo Men to Learn by Heart.
Mr. : lam from the Evening Bulletin and called upon you
In reference to an Illustrated and Industrial Edi ion of our paper which we are
going to soon publish and which is different from anything ever pub ished
before, because we don't want any advertising. We are going to take
up every line of business â that is, wholesale grocers, drugs, dry goods, etc. â
and speak of them editorially in our paper. We are going todevot: considera
ble space to your line, the , that is, speak of the amount of annual sales,
capital invested, etc. We are also going to illustrate this edition with cuts
of the fine office buildings and wholesale and manufacturing establishments and
will publish a nice cut of your place of business here free of charge. We
want to show the people at large that San Francisco is not only a big city from
a financial point of view but also from an architectural standpoint; that many
of our wholesale and manufacturing establishments occcupy large and com
modious quarters or buildings, etc. Copies of this edition are to be sent lo all
the prominent newspapers, Boards of Trade and commercial bodies through
out the entire West. We are going to publish an edition such as will please
every business man and public- spirited citizen in this city and one that can
not be referred to as an ad scheme. It is published for the benefit of
the city. The idea is to show what a great city San Francisco is and what a
great city she reasonably promises to be in the future. Now this will be
a very expensive newspaper; we don't accept any advertising.
but if you wish to donate or contribute something toward making
this enterprise a success we would thank you for any amount you
could give. We don't accept amounts less than one dollar ;we accept any
thing from one dollar up. To-day we are simply getting names of merchants
who will do something. You can see by this list whom we have already
interested. If you will read the heading it will explain the proposition better
than I can.
Mr. , those names are simply the names of those who agree to do

[ for local manufactures. But It devel
! ops that people who contributed in >
j many instances had done so under the
| mistaken idea that they were to be
i charged nothing, but have the pleasure !
of helping the Bulletin in thus explolt
j ing valuable enterprises, and then do
i nate to that peculiar concern any sum
i they chose. As the matter was first
! broached it had much the seeming of
1 a charity scheme, with the Bulletin
the direct beneficiary and the dear peo
\ pie petting a theoretical rake-off. The
plan in advance had been reduced to an
absolute system. No gang bent upon
, looting a bank ever went about the
I task with greater deliberation.
The seed was sown by means of a
cunningly devised circular. An agent
rich in cheek and fluent as to gab made
a call upon the selected victim. He
had a "piece" to speak, and until he
had committed this to memory was not
ready to tackle his game. But having
committed it there was no escape from
him save by flight.
He told how the Bulletin was intend
ing to get out an edition free from any
advertising; how donations would be
; accepted; how moral support was the
; thing of which he was particularly in
â¢ i quest. He paused at a certain place in
his eloquence to give the listener an
â  ; opportunity to subscribe his moral
support. In the "piece" given him to
learn was a memorandum, "Spring
contract," and with a regularity whirh
sjx.k.- well for his training he never
omitted to spring it. But he did this
pleasantly, casually, as a matter of
form. Afterward the merchant had an
impression that there was to be a
write-up; that some man was coming
to collect material, and then the Bul
letin would accept the boon of a
gratuity it had craved. But the man
never came. The next move was the
receipt by the merchant of something
(Here show list of firms.)
(Get signature to list.)
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1898.
called a write-up, this accompanied by I
a document meant still to give the or- j
iginal impression that the Bulletin was :
performing a labor of love. Then the |
edition was printed.
Hardly was it off the press when the
bills for the write-ups began to cause
pain and surprise. The merchants
thought they had signed something
chiefly Indicative of their local pride.
They found that they had signed some- j
thing which the Bulletin regarded as a |
contract to pay at $1 per line, and that '
their protest against such extortion i
was met by a threat to sue. Naturally
the merchants were indignant and they
held a meeting to consider how best to
meet the extortion. The business man
ager of the Bulletin was there and
tried to make out a case, but the job ;
was hopeless. He could not explain
why he had been concerned in an effort
to bunko them, and they soon tired of
I listening to him and adjourned with
their wrath uncooled.
Just what action will be taken next
lis not determined, but it is certain
that some of the merchants will refuse
to pay their bill and will welcome any
suit the Bulletin may choose to bring.
The Excelsior Glove Company has
compromised for half the amount
charged and feels Itself cheated at this.
President Dohrmann of the firm of Na- j
than & Dohrmann paid his bill, know
ing it to be unjust. "I found I was not
shrewd enough," said Mr. Dohrmann,
"and 1 paid the sum demanded, charg
ing it to experience." The sum was
more than $100.
H. S. Field of Hammersmith & Field
declared that the firm would not under
any circumstances pay for advertis
ing not contracted for. "I think it
rather peculiar," he said, "for the Bul
letin to try to collect for a write-up
: supposed to be gratuitous. Our firm
i has never been in the habit of doing
business in such a way, and before we
submit to the unwarranted bill will
stand suit, feeling confident we can
â  conclusively show any court we had
â¢ not agreed to pay for the article."
i Mr. Schmidt of the Schmidt Label
i and Lithographing Company consented
i to tell how he was taken in. "A man
I by the name of Spencer came to me,"
he said, "representing that he came
fr<>m the Bulletin, and asked that he
might be allowed to write the firm up.
As we are not heavy advertisers, I re
fused. Ho then told me that it would
be a free write-up, and if we were sat
istio'l we could donate a few dollars so
v to lesson the paper's expenses.
"I told him to go ahead and that we
would give him $5. A few days later
I received from the Bulletin the proof
of an article of about 300 words in
which a great deal of space had been
devoted to me personally, and not
caring for so much glory I drew my
pencil through nearly all the copy,
leaving a few paragraphs, which I re
turned to the paper. Within a week
Sf- neer called. I was very busy, but
he seemed to be in a great hurry, and
I went to him. Handing me a paper
he said, 'Of course I deserve some pay
for my trouble, and the only way I
can get it is to show my employers
that I was instrumental in getting the
write-up. Won't you please sign this
paper, so t*iat I can use it as a
voucher?' Not having time to read it
I signed the paper and he was off. I
thought nothing more about the mat
ter until I received d" bill for it at a
dollar per line. To say I was sur
prised is putting it mildly. I was as
tonished and declined to pay more
than the $5 I had agreed to give as a
donation. I will pay nothing more."
OJeorge L. Payne, president of
Payne's rtnlt Works, in speaking of
the Bulletin's methods of attempting
to extort money from the merchants
of the city to pay for the expense of
getting out their holiday edition,
said:
"The solicitor of the Bulletin came
to us about four weeks ago to advertise
in the holiday edition of their paper.
I looked over the list of the merchants
of the city who had already slgnod for
articles, and not being adverse to ad
vertising in this manner, I readily
agreed to subscribe.
"The solicitor represented that I was
to be allowed forty lines for the de
scription of my establishment, together
with an editorial and cut of the build
ing. The whole was to cost but $5. The
article was written by the Bulletin
people and submitted to me for con
sideration. As It was, as I thought,
entirely too flattering to my establish
ment, I handed It over to my book
keeper to cut down.
"When the process of cutting out this
objectionable praise was completed the
i entire article consisted of but eleven
lines. These eleven lines, together with
a cut of the bolt works on Howard
street, were published, and I thought
no more of the matter until the col
lector presented himself wtth a bill
against me for $11.
"I asked him for an explanation as
to why I should paY $11, as I had
agreed to pay his solicitor but $5, I
was told that such articles In the Bul
letin were taxed at the rate of $1 a
line and he saw no reason why I should I
not pay it.
"I remonstrated, and to smooth the
matter down and collect the $11 he said
I haa no particular kick coming, as I
had received a published cut of my
building, which was worth at least $15,
if not more.
"I refused to pay him the $11, and he
! threatened to sue me for the money.
1 ' I told him to go ahead and do so, as I
' ! wouldn't pay the extra $6 under any
; consideration."
j When asked whether he meant to al
) low the Bulletin people to institute suit
) against him for the money or pay it
and avoid notoriety, he said: "While I
dislike the notoriety that this matter
will probably cause me. I do not feel
Justified in paying the fxtra $6; it is
more for the principle of the thing than
the money I care; and I intend to fight
them for this reason if for no other."
When asked if he knew of any other
merchants of the city swindled in
like manner, he said:
"There are scores of them right
around my own establishment, but one
in particular, C. H. Evans, of the firm
of C. H. Evans & Co., doing business at
ISI and IST Fremont street, who was
swindled out of $45."

ONE OF THE VICTIMS.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: One of the victims of the bunko
gang, 3eelng in your paper this morning an exposure of the Bulletin,
wishes to state how he was entrapped. A solicitor called at our fac
tory, made known his errand and we told him that as the Bulletin did
not go out of Uie city to any extent we did not think it worth while to
put in our "write-up." The solicitor replied that they were to have
Dun's mailing list and copies of the issue would be sent throughout the
State. He also told us there would be no charge for the write-up, but
if we saw fit to give a few dollars we could. Thereupon we gave the
solicitor some points and signed the list, and put our stamp upon the
contract without having read it, the solicitor telling us this was a mere
matter of form. The write-up was presented for our "O. X.," and not
being to our liking we prepared another, and when this was returned to
us before publication we affixed our "O. K." and signature, all upon the
basis represented to us that no charge would be made, but the matter of
compensation be left to us.
When the paper was issued and before we had seen a copy, a collec
tor presented a bill of $79 for a write-up of seventy-nine lines at $1 a
line. We were astonished. After thinking the matter over, we went to
the Bulletin office and there learned that Mr. Wolf (a very suggestive
name) had charge of the edition. Not wishing to have a lawsuit, al
though we think we could sustain our position, and yet may try, we
talked on the line of settlement, and Wolf asked us what we would be
willing to payâ not that we were to understand by that that ne was to
accept the offer. We told him that we would pay $25. but considered that
we had been fleeced at this figure. He promised to let us hear from him
and in two or three days we did. through a lawyer named C. M. Jen
nings, demanding payment and stating that the claim had been put in
his hands for collection. We enclose said notice. We went to see Mr.
Wolf again and aiMl we would pay one-half the amount. After consult
ing with some one in the office. Wolf replied that $50 was the least they
would take. The same evening we sent by mail a check for $45, and in
due time received an acknowledgment, but not a receipt in MB. This
we sent back with an explanation, and in due time received the deslfed
receipt, an assurance that we had been very liberally dealt with, and a
request that the affair be regarded as confidential. Nevertheless, we
wish to show how we were bunkoed so as to put others on guard against
such sharpers- EXCELSIOR GLOVE COMPANY,

truly, the story of the Bulletin's shame,
supported by an array of "exhibits"
sufficient to convict. It shows a depth
of degradation to which few papers
have ever fallen, and it shows a stu
pidity dense beyond comprehension.
For what shall it profit a bunko sharp
if he try to skin the whole world, and
the world rising up, club in hand, re
fuse to be skun?
PERSONAL PRORPETY TAXES
Supreme Court Upholds Assessoi
Sicbe ir> the Rode Case.
The Supreme Court has rendered an
interesting decision, in whirh the law
is laid down that the Assessor of the
city and county has the right to seize
personal property and sell the same
without allowing the time necessary
in such proceedings where realty is
concerned. The matter came up in the
case of C. B. Rode and others against
John D. Siebe as Assessor. In March,
ISSS, the Assessor made his returns,
showing that Rode and others were
the owners of personal property, but
no real estate, subject to taxation for
the ensuing year. Siebe demanded the
payment of the tax and threatened to
seize and sell if payment were not
made. To prevent the threatened
seizure and sale Rode began an action
to enjoin the Assessor from taking
such a step. The Superior Court re
fused to grant the injunction and an
appeal was taken to the Supreme
Court.
Rode conceded the right of the As
sessor to take the steps permitted by
the statute, but not before equaliza
tion or before the levy for the year or
before the beginning of the fiscal year
to which the tax belonged, holding
that to do so was unconstitutional and ;
a violation of the laws of taxation. The
Judgment of the lower court was sus
tained by four of the Justices, Chief
Justice Beatty writing the prevailing
opinion, in which he says:
But where a taxpayer has no real prop
erty, or none sufficient to pay the pay
ment of his taxes, the Assessor is re
quired to collect them at the time of
making his assessment, and In case of
failure to pay to sell sufficient of the
property of the delinquent to make the
amount of the tax, with costs. As this
collection must be enforced before the
meeting of either the Board of Equaliza
tion and before the rate for the ensuing
year is ascertained and the levy made, it
is provided that it shall be made accord
ing to the rate levied the previous year.
and as this may beâ and generally isâ
greater or less than the subsequent levy
for the current year, provision is made
for refunding to the taxpayer any excess
in the collection and for the payment by
him of any deficiency.
He also argues that a person so dis
posed could leave the State and not
pay any tax at all. Justices Henshaw,
Temple, Garoutte and McFarland con

wrote dissenting opinions in which
they contended that it is not fair to
make the owner of personal property
pay his taxes many months and per
haps a year before those who pay on
realty It deprives him of the use of
his money. and it would be
equivalent to depriving him of
his money. In other words, he will
have to pay more taxes than the other.
They further take the position that

heavy on the poor who do not own real

HOUSEWARMING DEL AYED
The San prarjeisco Club Soot) to
Occupy Its Elegarjt New
Quarters.
The Pan Francisco Club, recently or
ganized and embracing within its mem
bership the very cream of this city's
commercial and professional men, ex
pected to take possession of its new
quarters in the Claus Spreckels build
ing at noon to-day, but owing to un
avoidable delay in the completion of
arrangements a short postponement is
inevitable.
The club will occupy the entire floor
beneath the dome. Its quarters will
be not only commodious, but sumptu
ous in the extreme. They will com
prise a thoroughly appropriate home
for a social organization, of which the
city will undoubtedly have reason to
feel very proud.
Due announcement will be made of
the fact when the date for occupancy
of the new quarters has been definitely
decided upon.

worth double the money. This is true
business, and by purchasing now you
make a fine investment. There is' a
$20,000 stock of all kinds of goods too
numerous to mention, all to be slaugh
tered, as Lyons will not take anything
away from the store when it closes up.*
