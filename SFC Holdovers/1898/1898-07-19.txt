IN SANTIAGO HARBOR, July 17, .by the Call-Herald
dispatch-boat Golden Rod to Port Antonio, Jamaica, July 18. â
I have taken the Golden Rod through the tortuous channel into
harbor, thus sustaining the reputation of The Call and
the Herald of being the first newspapers to be represented at
even- point where important news is to be obtained. This task
wa ( by no means an easy one, but it has been accomplished, and
The Call and Herald are here ahead of the American fleet and al
most ahead of the Government's representative themselves.
The Golden Rod is now anchored In !
the upper bay. Santiago in defeat is '
silent and somber. Many of the houses \
are deserted. Save for the measured j
tread of the American troops, who are
patrolling the city, no sound Is heard. :

happiness that Americans are here to |
fped them and keep the Cubans in the
leash.
Absolutely nothing is left in the city
except wine, so that the residents for
the present must be dependent upon
the Americans for supplies, and upon
the Red Cross staff for medical attend
ance. The Cubans resent the occupa
tion of Santiago by the Americans.
Th*>y think Gpneral Garcia should be
made Governor General of Santiago
and threaten to make trouble if they
are ignored.
In the harbor some rich prizes have
been taken to-day. Lieutenant Doyle
of the Brooklyn, who controls the ship
ping of the port, during the afternoon
seized seven Spanish vessels, manning
them with prize crews from the New
York and Brooklyn. These prizes in
clude the gunboat Canonero, the pas
senger steamship Mexico of Barcelona,
the passenger steamship Reina de loa
Angelo of Cienfuegos, the freight boat
Mortara, and a sister ship, the neme
of which has been removed, a tugboat
and the sloop Josefa. The four steam
ships are fine vessels, worth in the ag
gregate a million dollars. In addition
to these prizes half a dozen fishing
smacks have been taken.
The steamship Thomas Brooks, owned
by the former BrKlsh Consul, has not
been disturbed. About 200 marines have
been distributed among the vessels in
the harbor. As I write several of the
prizes are getting up steam, and I un
derstand they will be attached to the
transport fleet. The water supply of
the city will be restored at once and
thus enable the transports that are to
lakp General Toral's army back to
Bpain to obtain a complete supply of
coal and water here, and this will facil
itate the removal of the Spanish
trof.-pp.
Rear Admiral Sampson and Commo

how badly Morro Castle had been dam

Immediately after the American col

this work in a launch, and were thus
employed when I boarded the flagship.
"We are handling these mines our
selves," said Admiral Sampson, "pre
ferring to do the work in our own
way."
The mines are not being taken up, but
will be exploded so as to dear the chan

not enter the harbor, and that it would
probably not enter at all, although he
might send in the Vixen and Glouces
ter later to serve as dispatch boats.

sea have been carried away. The light

built in two sections, being opened In
the morning and closed at night. When

MANILA, July 14 (via Hongkong, July 18). â There is no change in the condition of
affairs here. The Spaniards still hold the outlying forts. The rebels make sham attacks to call the
Spaniards' fire, and the Spaniards waste huge quantities of ammunition. Food is scarce and bad.
The rebels have captured the steamer Compania de Filipinas, loaded with tobacco. Colonel Iboleon
of the Seventy-third native regiment has been killed, and Captain Bello of the same regiment badly
wounded, and the remainder of the regiment made prisoners in the province of Tayabase.
The Boston left the bay yesterday for Cape Egano to meet the transports from San Fran
cisco with the second detachment of troops. The situation otherwise is unchanged. The health of
the fleet is excellent, owing to the careful sanitary regulations enforced by Admiral L)ewey. A
steamer has arrived with a thousand tons of frozen meat from Australia and a sailing ship with 2600
tons of coal.
Aguinaldo has removed his head
quarters from Cavlte to Baker. The
rebels maintain their position before
Manila, but seem to be making no ef
fort to force the fighting.
It is reported that Admiral Dewey re
cently sent Flag Lieutenant Brunsberg
to Admiral yon Diederichs, com
manding the German squadron, calling
attention to several acts of the German
vessels not authorized by international
law or naval customs.
Admiral yon Dlederichs sent his
flag lieutenant to Dewey with an ex
planation that the acts specified had
been done without his knowledge.
Later, It is said. Admiral yon Diede
richs complained to Dewey that the
American ship McCulloch had shown
unnecessary severity in overhauling
the German cruiser Irene. Dewey re
plied that our officers had done only
what was proper, and would continue
to enforce the laws and customs us
ually applicable in time of war.
I wi3h to warn the readers of The
Call and the Herald against many
stories circulating at Cavite about the
relations of the United States forces
to the natives and Germans. The lat
ter are lacking in ordinary naval cour
tesy, but not to the point of hostility
as some have asserted. They have
landed some provisions in Manila, but
the stories that they have sent field
artillery and gunners to man the
Spaniards' heavy guns is not true.
Lieutenant Colonel Juan Cailles, In
charge of the guns in the insurgent
trenches surrounding Manila, informs
me that the Spaniards have placed dy
namite mines Immediately behind their
Intrenchments on every road leading
Into the city. The mines are connected
by wire with the Spanish headquarters
and pits also have been dug and filled
with upturned lance heads. The bridges
have not been mined. The Insurgents
have solved the Spanish system of
rocket signaling during the fighting,
which takes place almost Invariably at
night. A yellow rocket means a point
is endangered and calls for reinforce
speaking distance drew rein simulta
neously and raised their hats. Imme
diately every officer on both sides un
covered his head and remained so until
Generals Shatter and Toral had re
placed their hats.
At the same moment General Shaf
ter's cavalry escort deployed and pre
sented sabers, to which the Spanish in
fantry responded by presenting arms.
After exchanging salutations General
Shafter took from Lieutenant Miley
the sword and spurs of General Vera
del Rey, who died bravely defending
El Caney on July 1, and presented them
to General Toral with his compliments.
General Toral appeared to be much
affected as he received these souvenirs
of his dead comrade in arms. He
warmly thanked General Shafter, and
handed the sword and spurs to Colonel
Fontaine, his chief of staff. General
Shafter then announced that he was
ready to receive the surrender of the
city under the terms of capitulation al
ready agreed upon and signed.
General Toral, speaking in Spanish,
then said: "I deliver up the city and
province of Santiago de Cuba into the
authority of the United States."
General Toral then made a motion as
if to offer his sword, but this instantly
was checked by General Shafter. The
Thirteenth Infantry descended Into the

AUGUSTI REFUSES
TO SURRENDER MANILA
MANILA, July 13 (via Hongkong,
July 18).â An Important interview has
just been held between Aguinaldo's
secretary, Legarda, and a prominent
native white man, and the Spanish
commander, Captain Augusti, to sur
render the city, asserting that 50,000
Insurgents surrounded Manila and
were able to enter it at any moment.
Thus far, they argued, the insurgents
had been restrained with difficulty, but
if the Spaniards continued stubborn the
result would be that the insurgents
would be compelled to bombard and
storm the city "with the inevitable
slaughter, unparalleled in history, be
cause in the excitement of battle they
cannot discriminate."
Continuing, the captain general's vis
itors advised him to disregard the of
ficial fictions regarding alleged Span
ish victories in Cuba and reinforce
ments coming to the Philippines, and
proposed a reconciliation between the
Spaniards In the Philippines under a
republican flag and a Joint endeavor to
persuade the Americans to abandon
hostilities in the Philippine Islands.
Finally the representatives of the in
surgents proposed an appeal to the

sorrowful face. To the front the of
ficer went and the soldiers stacked
their arms and then moved along into
positions where they could recline on
the grass. This formality being over,
General Toral saluted General Shafter
and turned toward the city.
It was now noon, the hour set for
raising the American flag over the
Governor's house. Captain McKittrick.
Lieutenant Wheeler and Lieutenant
Miley had been selected to perform th*
ceremony of unfurling the flag, and at
five minutes before 12 they ascended to
the cupola of the palace. As the ca
thedral bells rang out the hour of noon
the stars and stripes shot to the top
of the flagpole, where for centuries had
â¢waved the banner of Spain. General
Shafter, General Wheeler and every
American present uncovered, while the
soldiers presented arms and the band
played "The Star Spangled Banner."
With rare courtesy. General Toral
and his staff officers uncovered and re
mained in that attitude until the
strains of muÃic ceased. It was an In
spiring moment. Another battle eagle
had perched on the old flag.
After the flag was raised the Amer
ican generals bade farewell to General
Toral and his staff and left the plaza
escorted by the cavalry. Just before
noon a call to arms was Bounded In
every regimental camp and all the reg
iments formed as If on dress parade
powers to recognize the Independence
of the Philippine Islands.
The captain general replied that he
must fight, however hopeless the Span
ish cause. Legarda then returned to
Cavite, taking with him the native,
who is a paroled prisoner.
The natives inside the city say they
received a fortnight ago a concerted
signal to prepare for storming the
walls. A second signal fixing the date
of the assault has not yet been issued
and they are tired of waiting and are
losing faith in Aguinaldo. The latter,
It is alleged, finds it extremely difficult
to capture the town's fortifications. HJs
previous successes, it Is pointed out,
were easy because of the nature of the
country, which suited his skirmishers.
It Is further alleged that the principal
points captured "by the insurgents were
obtained possession of through treach
ery.
The Insurgents are now bringing ar
tillery around by sea from Malabon,
which is tedious and troublesome work.
They are also obtaining detailed reports
of the condition of affairs from the in
side of the city.
Admiral Dewey is establishing a more
strict blockade, lest it be invalidated
by permitting neutmis to visit Cavite
and Malabon and send and receive
mails inclosing surreptitious Spanish
dispatches. He has threatened to sta
tion warships opposite the city, which
might precinltate hostilities as the
Spanish officers declare they will cer
tainly fire on any American within
range, regardless of the consequences.
A Spanish steamer, the Fillpinas, has
just been brought in here in the hands
of the insurgents. It appears that she
was on the north coast and escaped to
China with a native crew on board,
when the latter revolted, killed the
Spanish officers and brought the vessel
to Cavite.
The Spaniards are daily employing
convicts to fell trees and burn huts on
the outskirts of the town. Fusillades
continue, but otherwise the position is
unchanged. The stock of flour is prac
tically exhausted, but the supplies of
rice and buffalo meat will last for
months longer.
along the crest of the elevated ridge
facing the city. President McKinley's
dispatch conveying the congratulations
of the people of the United States was
read then, and Captain Capron'a bat
tery fired a salute of twenty-one guns
as a signal that the American flag
waved over Santiago.
On the way through the suburbs the
cavalcade dashed past a thousand refu
gees returning from Caney. Notwith
standing their accumulated miseries of
the last fortnight, they still had spirit
enough to cheer General Shafter and
his officers. Shortly after 1 o'clock Gen
eral Shafter reached his headquarters,
somewhat fatigued by the exertion of
the day. but exceedingly well satisfied.
In fact the capitulation was conduct
ed gracefully on both sides. The only
incident which marred the day was oc
casioned by the conduct c-f Sylvester
Scovel, a correspondent. When they
came to raise the flag Scovel attempted
to make his way to the roof of the pal
ace with the Intention of participating
in some way In the ceremony. He was
ordered down by the guard. Imme
diately after the ceremony Bcovel
pushed his way to General Shafter and
slapped the general's face. He was
promptly arrested.
For the present the municipal and
provincial affairs of Santiago will be
administered by the regular authorities
under the protection of the American
troops. There will be no material
change until the Spanish troops have
embarked.

WASHINGTON, July 18.â After three
days' consultation between Secretary
Alger and General Brooke, during
which there was a frequent communi
cation with General Miles at Siboney,
the details of the Porto Rlcan expedi
tion were perfected and the expedition
itself gotten under way. General
I Miles, with some military and troops,
I are sailing to-day for Porto Rico on the
converted cruiser Tale, to be followed
quickly by an army of about 30,000 men.
There are some notable differences in
j the plans for this expedition and for
the stately navaT pageant that sailed
away from Tampa under General
Shafter's command to attack Santiago.
First, there will be practically no naval
General Miles leads the way. He had
been promised by the President that he
I should go to Porto Rico and the prom
ise was redeemed when the Tale headed
to-day from Siboney for Porto Rico,
800 miles distant. General Brooke will
be the senior officer in General Miles'
command, and upom him will fall the
responslblity for the .execution of the
details of his superior's plans. It is
estimated that General Miles should ar
rive by Wednesday night at the point
selected for the landing, and that he
will hoist the American flag at once
over Porto Rican soil. The point chosen
for his landing is kept secret, as the
general will land before the full body
of the expedition Is at hand, and it is
consequently not desirable that they
should be able to assemble a superior
f^rce to meet him.
The distance from Charleston, where
the first body of troops for General
Miles' expedition was to start to-day,
is more than double the distance from
Santiago to Porto Rico, so that the
transports which sail from the former
city can scarcely reach General Miles
before the early part of next week.
There Charleston troops are to be the
First Brigade of the First Division of
the First Army Corps, and, are com
manded by Brigadier General George
H. Ernst. The brigade comprises the
Second Wisconsin, Third Wisconsin and
Sixteenth Pennsylvania Regiments.
The purpose of Secretary Alger is to
make the Porto Rican campaign a
short one. An overwhelming force will
be thrown upon the islands, and it i?
possible that a bloodless victory wiV
be achieved when the Spaniards become
convinced that they have no reasona
ble chance to resist successfully. Thr
expedition is to comprise 30,000 men a/
the start, and it will be swelled soon
to 40.000 men, and, if necessary, to 70,
000 men, the equipment of the volun
teer forces having now progressed so
well as to warrant the statement that
that number of men can be ready for
services in Porto Rico within a very
short time.
The entire body of troops at Tampa
will be taken, numbering about 13,000
men, and including a lot of heavy and
light artillery under command of Gen
eral Rodgers. The expedition will be
particularly strong with artillery and
some of that at Santiago, commanded
by General Randolph, is to be drawn
upon. The Tampa troops are known
as the Fourth Corps, under Major Gen
eral Coppinger, comprising the Second

The part which the navy Is to take
I In the assault against Porto Rica has
I been fully matured. The several
I transport fleets will have with them
one or two auxiliary craft, carrying
strong secondary batteries of six or
eight pounders.
Secretary Long said this afternoon
that no time has been fixed for the de
parture of Admiral Sampon's fleet for
| San Juan. As to the naval plans he
! would only say that they would
i co-operate In every way with
the movements of the army. The re
ports that three monitors are on their
way from Key West to San Juan was
characterized by the Secretary as un
authorized. It is the general under
standing, however, that the na,vy will
rely mainly on armored ships \pr the
bombardment of San Juan, as the big
battleships and monitors afford the
best means of offensive warfare, while
their armor belts protect them from
such fire as the San Juan batteries can
bring to bear. The fortifications there
are much like those of Santiago, with
a Morro Castle at thÂ» entrance of the
harbor and a number of lesser fortifi
cations leading up to the city. These,
however, are viewed with less awe,
since an examination of the batteries
at Santiago has shown them to be an
tiquated and capable of little effective
resistance.
The movement of the ships from San
tiago to their new fields of action will
begin at once, an 1 It is probable that
some of Admiral Sampson's ships were
detached to-day and proceeded with
General Miles with the expedition
toward Porto Rico. They will be need
ed to cover the debarkation of the
troops on Porto Rican soil. The others
will follow as soon as the full army ex
pedition is ready to make a landing,
when the attack will begin simultane
ously from land and sea.
It has been finely decided that none
j of the troops that participated In the2
actual fighting before Santiago shall be
employed on the Porto Rican expedi
tion. There are two reasons for this;
first, the men have suffered severely
from hardships, the climate and from
severe fevers and are entitled to a rest;
second, it is deemed to t:> very bad
practice to allow the soldiers who have
been exposed to yellow fever to be
brought in contact with those fresh
from the United States. There is also
still another reason, a purely military
one. Ten thousand Spanish troops are
at Holguin, Manzanillo and other points
within strikinr distance of Santiago
and might not lose an opportunity to
recover the ground lost at Santiago if
the place were left insufficiently pro
tected. Therefore Shaffer's entire army
is to be kept on guard on the high hills
in the rear of the town until the men
have stamped out the yellow fever.
Then they will take a turn at the Span
iards if they can be found, and it may
be that Shafter's march will end at
Havana. He will work as far from his
base as possible after his army is
thoroughly refreshed, hunting the ene
my wherever they are liable to be
found.

BOMBARDMENT
OF MANZANILLO
BY OUR SHIPS
LONDON, July 19.â A special dispatch from Havana, dated Mon
day, says:
"Seven American warships heavily bombarded Manzanillo this
morning. '. hree steamers of Mendendezline were set on fire. Several
gunboats that were in the harbor Issued forth to the defense of the
town, but were stranded. The result of the bombardment Is not yet
known here."
NEW YORK, July 18.â A cablegram to the Sun dated "Havana.
July 18, via London," says: Guns aboard a steamer at Manzanillo were
landed and used in the defense against the American bombardment.
The g-unboats Delgado and Pareja were burned.
Captain General Blanco has telegraphed a congratulatory message
to the commander at Manzanlllo and has ordered him to resist to the

HAULED DOWN

Officers View the

In Concluding the Inspection of
the Harbor the Commodore
Makes Pointed Remarks.

UNDER MORRO CASTLE, HAR
BOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July
17, 3 p. m., via Playa del â ste, Province
of Santiago de Cuba, July 17 (delayed
in transmission). â At exactly 9 o'clock
this morning the Spanish flag was low
ered from the staff crowning the
heights upon which battered Morro
Castle stands half way up. The low
ering of this emblem of the defunct
sovereignty of Spain in this part of
the world was witnessed by a few
Spanish and American troops on shore
and by the Brooklyn, New York, Vixen
and Vesuvius, lying within a hundred
yards of the harbor entrance.
Almost immediately after the flag
was taken down steam launches, com
manded by Lieutenants Hobson and
Powell, entered the harbor, penetrat
ing as far as the firing stations of tne
submarine mines. These mines were
judged not to be so formidable as ex
pected, and later in the afternoon they
were all exploded under the supervision
of the Vixen.
It was seen that two mines had been
exploded at the time of the entrance
of the Merrimac into the channel of
Santiago harbor, but it is not thought
that any of them had anything to do
with the sinking of that craft. Six or
seven steamers in the harbor fall cap
tive to the army and navy. The Span
ish gunboat Alvarez had already been
taken possession of by a prize crew
from the New Tork. The other ves
sels lie at the other end of the harbor,
at Santiago proper.
Soon after noon Commodore Schley,
with Captain Cook of the Brooklyn;
Lieutenant J. H. Sears, the flag lieu
tenant; Silcut B. Wells, the flag sec
retary, and three invited correspond
ents of the Associated Press, went into
the harbor on a steam launch, which
moved slowly in order to make close
observations of the Spanish forts and
batteries.
Every one expressed satisfaction at
the fact that Morro Castle was not de
molished by the bombardment, Captain
Cook saying: "We need El Morro as
an object lesson, and America is rather
shy on ruins anyhow."
The old fort stands on the bluff, ter
race fashion. From the water's edge
to the cliff are numerous caves formed
by the action of the waves, and around
the base, and in the superstructure are
not a few caves made by the fleet's
projectiles. It would appear, however,
that only one bastion was knocked to
pieces, while the queer little sentry
boxes, dating back to the sixteenth cen
tury, escaped almost intact. Morro
Castle is the. only imposing fortifica
tion in the harbor, and it is only so
in appearance, since not a gun is
mounted within or on the crumbling
walls. In fact, all the batteries,
masked and open, dwindled in their
terror-inspiring qualities as the inspec
tion grew closer.
Crowning the hill on the west side
of the entrance were the famous six
inch rapid-fire guns from the Spanish
cruiser Reina Mercedes. These were
ugly looking and dangerous, while be
low, on big foundations on the western
shore of the entrance, were some re
volving guns. These were the ones
which poured such a bitter fire into the
Merrimac. Directly east of Morro Cas
tle, on the crest of the nlateau-like cliff,
were six big guns, one or two of which
were dismounted.
The Estrella battery and a small
neighbor further in showed no guns,
while the famous islet, Cayo Smith, was
filled with blue, white and yellow
houses situated in groves of flowering
trees, some of the buildings looking as
if they had been resorts of pleasure
seekers in happier times. Others were
humble enough in appearance for
fishermen's houses. All were deserted,
and, strange to say, not one apparently
had been touched by a hostile projec
tile.
On the inside of the slope and hill to
the westward some hastily constructed
but very comforting casemates were
seen, Into which the Spanish gunners
were wont to retire when our ships
opened fire. When the firing ceased
the gunners had a few steps only to
climp to the six-Inch rapid-fire guns,
which almost always fired a few spite
ful farewell shots. In Santiago there
were four six-inch guns, one above the
other, neither protected even by sand
or earth. These commanded the har
bor entrance pretty well, but they could
have been silenced by one well directed
heavy shell.
Commodore Schley has over and over
again expressed the belief that our fleet
probably could have entered the har
bor without the loss of a single ship.
The mines might have stopped ingress
by sinking the leading ship, but this Is
the chance of war and not so grave as
many taken during the civil strife nor
as serious- as would have been the sit
THE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 19, 1898.
uation had there been good batteries,
properly manned, in the harbor.
Commodore Schley's party first
steamed around the wreck of the Reina
Mercedes, which lies with her bow
pointed toward the city. She had a
list to the starboard and rested on a
reef near the foot of Morro cliff. The
cruiser was sunk to the upper deck, on
which one six-inch gun remained. One
torpedo tube was loaded and the auxil
ary battery seemed in place. Evident
ly the crew of the Reina Mercedes left
her in a hurry. This is less to be won
dered at when it is noted that there
were great gaps in her sides, showing
where two twelve and two thirteen
inch shells struck her. The sea wash
ed through the after cabin, which was
decorated in old-fashioned style and
a silk curtain could bs plainly seen over
an inner door as the launch steamed by.
About six hundred yards ahead of the
Reina Mercedes anfl alomst in line with
her was the wreck of the Merrimac,
lying in fully six fathoms of water on
the very edge of the channel. Had not
the current swung the doomed ship
alongside instead of athwart the chan
nel the latter would have been well
blocked. When Assistant Naval Con
structor Hobson took the collier into
the harbor he was hunting for a four
fathom spot, and only missed by a few
hundred yards.
At the firing station on the west side,
which Commodore Schley inspected in
person, the American party met a
Spanish artillery captain, who was
courteous but gloomy. Commodore
Schiey was his own interpreter and ad
vised the officer, with the few men un
der his command, to go up to the city
and surrender as quickly as possible.
When the Spanish captain was asked
to point out the route to the six-inch
battery on the west hill he said there
was none and explained that the way
to get there was over steep, rocky and
difficult ground. It was learned later
that this was not true, and it was sur
mised that the Spaniard was anxious
to prevent the Americans from seeing
the damage done by the bombardment.
Commodore Schley then said he was
determined to have a glimpse of San
tiago City, and the launch was headed
along the west side of the channel, go
ing slowly and sticking to the shallow
water lest some contact mine put an
end, as the commodore remarked, "to
our pleasure party."
Skirting the broad, lake-like spot in
the harbor where the Spanish fleet, de
stroyed two waeks ago to-day, used to
lie during the bombardments, and not
ing the brilliantly painted buoys which
marked the shallows, Punta Gorda was
rounded and, distant about two miles,
the city of Santiago shone out, the
cathedral being especially well defined
and the masts and funnels of not a few
vessels showing at its wharves. At that
distance Santiago did not show any
traces of the destruction wrought by
the 106 eight-inch shells fired on the
city last Monday.
Returning to the Brooklyn, Commo
dore Schley, accompanied by his staff,
re-entered the harbor this morning:,
soon after the mines were exploded.
Captain Cook of the Brooklyn is au
thority for the statement that the for
mer Spanish flagship, the Infanta Ma
ria Teresa, has floated off the reef on
which she stranded, and that her heavy
armament is practically uninjured. The
captain also says this cruiser will al
most surely be saved and form an ad
dition to the United States navy a
trophy of the glorious July 3.
The Cristobal Colon may also be
saved, though a good deal depends
upon the weather, which is very un
certain at this time of the year. A
heavy storm might drive the cruiser so
high on the coral reef that it would be
impossible to float her. Many of the
naval men are outspoken in their crit
icism of the treatment of the Colon im
mediately after her surrender. They
believe the ship could have been saved
when she slipped back from the reef
into deep water, had divers, carpenters
and machinists', with a competent crew,
been sent on board of her.a
The crew of the Brooklyn regarded
the Vizcaya as their particular enemy
since the time when they were both
present at Queen Victoria's jubilee dis
play, when there was much comment
abroad on what a good fight might be
expected between the two ships If they
ever met. Of the four big ships which
were In Admiral Cervera's fleet, only
two are surely doomed to destruction.
They are the Vizcaya and the Almi
rante Oquendo, and these, as a coinci
dence, were the two cruisers which
went Into Havana harbor after the
blowing up of the Maine, and were
moored near the wreck of the United
States battle-ship in all their bravery
of paint, gilding and bunting, seeming
to gloat over the ruin caused, while the
people of Havana shouted themselves
hoarse, fired myriads of bombs and
bragged unceasingly of what the two
formidable cruisers of Spain would do
with the United States navy should a
fight ever be possible.
"Surely," remarked Lieutenant Com
mander Wainwrlght of the Gloucester,
formerly of the Maine, "this avenges
the Maine."
Speaking of the military victories of
July 1 and 2, and of the naval victory
on July 3, Commodore Schley said ser
iously: "These victories may serve
not only to deprive Spain of her co
lonial possessions, but to bring about
a change of frontiers in Europe. Spain
cannot get the terms now which she
might have had two months ago. What
can she hope for in six months more
of such warfare? 'Whom the gods
would destroy they first make mad.' "

STATE PAPER
OF HISTORIC

WASHINGTON, July 18.â A state
paper that will be historic, marking an
i epoch in American history, was issued
! to-night by direction of President Mc-
I Kinley. It provides in general terms
, for the government of the province of
' Santiago de Cuba an f is the first docu
, ment of the kind ever prepared by a
] President of the United States. By or
i der of Secretary Alger Adjutant Gen
; eral Corbin to-night cabled the docu

;of the military forces at Santiago, x'he
| paper is not only an authorization and
instruction of General Shatter for the
government of the captured territory,
I but also a proclamation to the people
j of the territory of the intentions of the
! Government of the United States re

i marks the formal establishment of a
j new political power in the island ct
| Cuba and insures to the people of the
â¢â  territory over which the power ex
tends absolute security in the exercise
of their private rights and relations as
well as security to their persons and
property. The full text of the docu-
I ment is as follows:
ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE,
WASHINGTON, July 18, 18&8.
General Shafter, Santiago, Cuba: The
following is sent you for your Information
and guidance. It will be published in such
manner in both English and Spanish -as
will give it the widest circulation in the
territory under your control:
EXECLTIVE MANSION,
Washington, D. C, July 18.
To the Secretary of War- Sir: The capitu
lation of the Spanish forces in Santiago de
Cuba and in the eastern part of the Province
of Santiago and the occupation of the terri
tory by the forces of the United States render
It necessary to Instruct the military com
mander of the United States as to the con
duct which he is to observe during military
occupation.
The first effect of the military occupation of
the enemy's territory is the severance of the
former political relations of the Inhabitants
and the establishment of a new political
power. Under this changed condition of
things the Inhabitants, so long as they per
form their duties, are entitled to security in
their persons and property, and in all their
private rights and relations. It Is my desire
that the inhabitants of Cuba should be ac
quainted with the purpose of the United States
to discharge to the fullest extent its obliga
tions In thla regard. It will therefore be the
duty of the commander of the army of occu
pation to announce and proclaim In the most
public manner that we come not to make war
upon the Inhabitants of Cuba, nor upon any
party or faction among them, but to protect
them In their homes. In their employments and
In their personal and religious rights. All peÂ»
sons who, either by active aid or by honest
submission, co-operate with the United States
in Its efforts to give effect to this beneficent
purpose will receive the reward of Its support
and protection. Our occupation should be as
free from severity as possible.
Though the powers of the military occupa
tion are absolute and supreme, and Imme
diately operate upon the political condition of
the inhabitants, the municipal laws of the con
quered territory, such as affect private rights
of person and property and provide for the
punishment of crime, are considered as con
tinuing 1 In force, so far as they are compati
ble with the new order of things, until they
are suspended or superseded by the occupying
TO BE PUT IN
FORCE IT ONCE
President Signs Santi
ago War Tariff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 18.â The Presi
dent has signed the war tariff for San
tiago, and it takes effect to-morrow. It
adopts in general the privileged rates
now given Spain there, and makes thit
lar'ff uniform for all countries, includ
ing the United States.
The tariff was signed by President
McKinley after a brief conference this
afternoon with Secretaries Gage and
Alger. The instructions were immedi
ately cabled to the authorities in charge
of Santiago by Secretary Alger so that
the tariff can be put in force to-morrow
morning. The new tariff abolishes the
discriminative tariff now in operation
there, the rates for different countries
at Cuban ports varying. This country
took as its basis the rates accorded pro
ducts of Spain and applied them to all
countries not even excepting the United
States.
The most important change effected
is a reduction of tonnage duty on ships
carrying 2000 tons or more which go in
and out of the port from the present
rate of $1 a ton to a rate of 20 cents per
ton. This prohibitive tonnage tax under
the Spanish customs has been added
to the customs duties. In contrast to
the 20-cent rate declared for Santiago
is our own tonnage of 3 cents and that
of most of the other countries of three
or four times that much. The heavy
export duty on tobacco and certain
other Cuban products and the 5-cent
export tax on iron ore are retained for
awhile at least.
YELLOW FEVER SCOURGE
PRACTICALLY ABATED
Encouraging News Keceived by Gen-
eral Qreely in a Private Cable
Dispatch.
NEW YORK, July 18.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: There
came to-day a private cable dispatch
from Playa del Este to General Grey
ly, saying that the yellow fever
scourge was practically at an end in
Santiago. General Greeley told me
his information was not official, but he
was sure a decisive check has been
given the disease. There are over 200
caeca now in the hospitals, but they
have not been severe.
As General Miles contemplates taking
as many regulars as possible from San
tiago, the question of disinfecting uni
forms has been discussed. I was in
formed to-day at the quartermaster's
department that this may be easily
done, and even if this were not feasi
ble there are enough new uniforms at
Santiago to give one to each man who
will go to Porto Rico.
belligerent; and In practice they are not usu
ally abrogated, but are allowed to remain in
force and to be administered by the ordinary
tribunals, substantially as they were before the
occupation. This enlightened practice is, so
far as possible, to be adhered to on the pres
ent occasion. The judges and the other offi
cials connected with the administration of jus
tice may, if they accept the supremacy of the
United States, continue to administer the or
dinary law of the land, as between man and
man, under the supervision of the American
cornmander-ln-chlef. The native constabulary
will, so far aa may be practicable, be pre
served. The freedom of the people to pursue
their accustomed occupations will be abridged
only when it may be necessary to do so.
While the rule of conduct of the American
commander-in-chief will be such as has Just
been defined, It will be his duty to adopt meas
ures of a different kind if, unfortunately, the
course of the people should render such meas
ures Indispensable to the maintenance of law
and order. He will then possess the power to
replace or expel the native officials, in part
or altogether to substitute new courts of his
own construction for those that now exist, or
to create such new or supplementary tribunals
as may be necessary. In the exercise of these
high powers, the commander must be guided
by his Judgment and his experience, and a high
sense of justice.
One of the most important and most practical
problems with whick it will be necessary to
deal is that of the treatment of property and
the collection and administration of the rev
enues. It Is conceded that all public funds and
securities belonging to the government of the
country In Its own right and all arms and sup
plies and other movable property of such gov
ernment, may be seized by the military occu
pant and converted to his own use. The real
property of the State he may hold and admin
ister, at the same time enjoying the revenues
thereof, but he Is not to destroy it save In the
case of military necessity.
All public means of transportation, such as
telegraph lines, cables, railways and boats, be
longing to the State may be appropriated to his
use, but, unless In case of military necessity,
they are not to be destroyed. All churches and
buildings devoted to religious worship and to
the arts and sciences, and all school houses,
are so far as possible to be protected, and all
destruction or intentional defacement of such
places, of historical monuments or archives, or
of works of science or art. is prohibited, save
when require* by urgent military necessity.
Private property, whether belonging to in
dividuals or corporations, Is to be respected,
and can be confiscated only as hereafter In
dicated. Means of transportation, such as tele
graph lines and cables, railways and boats,
may, although they belong to private individ
uals or corporations, be seized by the military
occupant, but unless destroyed under military
necessity are not to be retained.
While It is held to be the right of the con
queror to levy contributions upon the enemy
in their seaports, towns or provinces which
may be In his military possession by conquest,
and to apply the proceeds to defray the expense
of the war, this right Is to be exercised within
such limitations that it may not savor of con
fiscation. As the result of military occupation
the taxes and duties payable by the inhabitants
to the former Government become payable to
the military occupant unless he sees fit to sub
stitute for them other rates or modes of con
tribution to the expenses of the Government.
The mone'-a so collected are to be used for the
purpose of paying the expenses of Government
under the military occupation, such as the sala
ries of the Judges and the police, and for the
payment of T he expenses of the army.
Private property taken for the use of the
army Is to be paid for when possible In cash
at a fair valuation, and when payment In cash
is not possible, receipts ars to be given.
All ports and places in Cuba which may be
In the actual possession of our land and naval
forces will be optned to the commerce of all
neutral nations, as well as our own. In article*

TO ROUND UP
TRANSPORTS
Plenty for Porto Rican
Expedition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 18.â The ques
tion of transports for the Porto Rico
I expedition and that of providing sub
i sistence for the army which is to go
! there was the topic which occupied the
i attention of the officials of the quarter
master and the subsistence depart
ments of the army during the entire
| afternoon. There are ample transports
available, scattered all along the At
lantic and Gulf coasts and at Santiago,
and these will be concentrated as rap-
I idly as possible at the embarking
| points. Subsistence stores also are
I abundant at some of the points from
which the troops are to start and these
will be supplied by additional supplies
as fast as they are needed. A vast
quantity will be shipped from Newport
News and orders have been given for
dispatching to that point 6,000,000
pounds of these stores and 200,000
I pounds of refrigerated beef.
It is suggested in some quarters that
j the army may land in Porto Rico on
the southern coast, near the city of
Ponce, to the southwest of San Juan.
I Ponce- is situated on a plain about two
I miles from the seaboard, is the resi
dence of the military commander of the
district and is commercially the second
city of importance on the island. A
fine road leads to the port (Playa),
where is situated the custom-house, the
office of the captain of the port and all
I the consular offices. The port is spa
cious and will hold vessels with twenty
flve feet draught â an important con
sideration in the landing. The city
proper has no military defenses, but in
the hills to the north of the town a
series of earth intrenchments have been
constructed. West of Ponce, where the
railroad and military road touch the
shore, earthworks have been construct
ed to guard this strategic point.
There are about thirty mountain how
itzers in Ponce available for the defense
of the city and the railroad. The army,
if landed there, would be compelled to
travel fifty or sixty miles across the
mountainous country to reach San
Juan. There is, however, a main road,
irregular and circuitous, connecting
Ponce and San Juan. The northern
coast of the island extends in an al
most straight line from east to west
and is high and rugged. The only har
bors it has are the following: San
Juan, surrounded by mangrove swamps
and protected by the Cabras and the
Cabritas islands, and some very dan
gerous banks; the anchoring ground of
Arecibo, somewhat unprotected and
which has been mentioned as a possi
ble landing place, and the coves of Can
grejos and Condado. During the pres
ent season the ports on this coast are
safe and commodious unless visited by
, hurricanes.
GENERAL CHAFFEE
WILL PROBABLY BE
MILITARY GOVERNOR
Steps to Put Our Customs and
Postal Machinery in Operation
in Santiago.
NEW YORK, July 18.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Major Gen
eral A. R. Chaffee will probably be ap
pointed by the President to be military
governor of Santiago and the surrend
ered territory around that city. Presi
dent McKinley and the members of his
Cabinet devoted considerable attention
to-day to matters connected with the
establishment of a government for the
newly conquered territory. Several of
ficers were under consideration for ap
pointment as governor before General
Chaffee was practically decided on.
General Chaffee was regarded as un
usually well qualified for the place, be
cause, in addition to being a thorough
soldier, with wide experience in Indian
campaign, he has a thorough knowl
edge of law and is well qualified to ex
ercise mixed military and civil duties
as governor of the conquered province.
Steps are being taken to p,ut the cus
toms and postal machinery of the
United States In operation in the sur
rendered territory without delay. A
large force of postal employes accom
panied General Shafter's army from
Tampa, and they have already been at
work handling the mails at the various
camps. They will now establish post
WATSON'S GREAT
SQUADRON WILL
SAIL THIS WEEK
NEW YORK, July 18.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent sends the
following: Commodore "Watson's for
midable squadron of battleships and
protected and auxiliary cruisers will
leave on Friday or Saturday for Spain.
Additional battleships have been added
to the fleet. These ships are now at
Guantanamo preparing for the voyage
and the work before them, and repairs
are being effected by the engineers on
the repair ship Vulcan.
Department officials trust that all the
battleships will be in condition to join
the Eastern squadron, but should it be
found more repairs are necessary than
can be made those ships so reported on
will be retained under Admiral Samp
son's command. The lowa and Indiana
are reported to be in a very bad con
dition.
Already two of the ships attached to
Commodore Watson's fleet are on their
way to the rendezvous fixed by the de
partment. This rendezvous is at Mole

offices In Santiago and will open of
fices at other towns and cities in the
surrendered territory as fast as the
military government is extended. All
mail addressed to any points In the
surrendered territory will be treated
as domestic letters and be delivered at
the domestic postage rateâ 2 cents for
each ounce in the case of letters.
The same is true as to letters ad
dressed to Cavite, in Manila Bay,
where also a United States postofflce
has been opened. Letters for Cavite
should be addressed "via San Fran
cisco." and those for Santiago or any
point in Eastern Cuba should be ad
dressed "via Key West." The admin
istration is determined to open up the
port of Santiago to commerce without
delay, so that business can resume its
normal course with the least possible
interruption, thus enabling the inhabi
tants to become self-supporting and
making the problem of caring for and
governing the conquered territory
much more simple.
Secretary Gage and the President to
day agreed upon a schedule of customs
to be collected by the military authori
ties and turned into the treasury as a
military contribution. The schedule,
which was telegraphed to Major Gen
eral Shatter to-night, Is practically the
minimum Cuban tariff schedule that
was enforced in Cuba by Spain.
Oregon and cruiser Newark has yone
to that point. They will be followed by
such of the battleships as are pro
nounced in condition to sail, but the
authorities hope that as finally made
up Commodore Watson's fleet will con
sist of these vessels: Battleships Ore
gon, Massachusetts, Indiana, lowa and
Texas; protected cruisers Newark and
New Orleans and auxiliary cruisers
Dixie, Yankee and Yosemite. It will
be determined within the next day or
two whether to further increase the
fleet by adding the cruisers Columbia
and Minneapolis.
From present indications the authori
ties are rather inclined to retain these
vessels on this side of the Atlantic, so
that they may run down any isolated
ship which may be sent by Spain to
prowl along the north Atlantic coast.
As soon as Camara's fleet is destroyed
there is every reason to believe that
Commodore Watson will establish a
base In the Balearic Islands from
which he can operate against Spain.
These islands are in the Mediterranean
and constitute an ideal site from which
to carry on operations against Spanish
ports and Spanish commerce.

TREASURE SEEKERS
CAMPED AT DAWSON
Without Knowledge of Mining, Unable
to Get Employment, Thousands
Are in a Sorry Plight.
BY SAM W. WALL.
DAWSON CITY, June 24, via Seattle,
July IS.â Following close upon the heels
of the ice a-s It ran out of the lakes I
arrived in Dawson on the night of June
â¢ ie day that stands in the calendar
i ;' the Yukon from year to year for the
al at this point of the first up
.river boat. I found already tied up at
front the little steamer May West,
Richardson boat that wintered be-
Minook. The still smaller steamer
Victoria, belonging to the Alaska Com
mercial Company party that was lce
1 at Circle City, had already ar
rival and that day left for the Pelly
River with a few pasaeng< ra who were
going out over the Dalton trail. The
May West was listing passengers for
St. Michael. The Porteus B. Weare of
the National Alaska Transportation
Company, that wintered at Circle, had
arrived, discharged cargo and was
away hunting wood. The Bella i>f the
Alaska Commercial Company, which
wintered at Circle, was reported to have
a barge on a bar nrar Circle City
and to have cut loose and pone back to
lin for another cargo.
The river is falling rapidly. It had
: many days ahead of the lakes.
It rose high and flooded all the flat
upon which the business portion of
I )av. and threatened to carry
the city down with it- For several days
the water was knee deep on Front
street and men walked round the bll
llard tables or sat at faro In their
rubber l â¢:.-, the water above their
ank:
The flood subsided as it had come,
almost In a day, and left Dawson as I
found it, a marvel of new cities.
Wl ted out over the ice In
March last Dawson was a town of
about :.' people. The business portion
consisted mainly of the stores of the
panics, the Alaska Com
mercial and the North American Trad
,:,.i Transportation, together with a
n or nvre saloons and dance houses
which stood in a* frequently broken
line along one side of First avenue or
Front sm-*'t. ihe residence portion was
>up of Joe: cabins on the first rise
of a hill to the northward.
I come back to find both sides of
I street built up almost without a
: for a distance of nearly three
. ot a mile and the business
â  1 infr> the cross streets and along 1
venue The water front down
on the river Is packed closely for a mile
and a half with boats and barges, two
;>. many of them with
and Hying banners of
new industries â photographers, dentists,
>rs and lawyers â all manner of peo
ple. At the mouth of the Klondike
toward on both sides the tents of
th<* new comers resemble an army in
camp, and northward of the town *. n
the risf> of the hill is another army.
There Major Walsh, commissioner or
rnor of the territory, has pitched
his tent where he can command a view
of the town.
AU the surrounding hillsides that last
winter wore merely wooded spaces are
rapidly being 1 resolved into the City of
Dawson. The trees are down and In
their place stand cabins in all stages
ot construction, most of them on the
simplest architectural plans, but rrhony
being built with a care and neatness
that indicate permanent residence.
Most of the business places on Front
â¢t are mere rough board or canvas
affairs, put up with regard to speed
rather than appearance or permanency,
but there are a few quite pretentious
buildings of newer order. These are,
without exception, saloons and gam
bling and lodging-houses. Th^y are all
doing a great business.
Front street, long and wide as it is,
is crowded with people at every hour
or the twenty-four, and particularly in
the evening from 5 o'clock until mid-
Ldfe is at high tension. The
great number of new comers is hourly
being increased by the boats and
barges, and the circle of tents widens
daily; saloons and dance houses now
are numbered by the score; the water
s:d" nf Front street resembles the ap
h to a State fair.
In the hastily constructed booths
every line of traffic is represented, mu
g lemonade (at 50 cents a glass),
am, news and peanut stands.
Both sides of the street boast side
walks, but the roadway is axle deep
w!th rr.ud. The street is littered with
: the wreckage of buildings.
The Klondike Nugget and the Yukon
Midnight Sun are two newspapers al
ready established, while at least half
a dozen other plants are here or are
i n the way.
A little steamboat, the Bellingham,
.â mi" down from the lakes, run
ning the rapids successfully, plies hour
;â¢ between the A. C. Company's wharf
end Klondike City, on the other side
of the Klondike, and carries a crowd
Lgera at every trip at $1 a
head.
The camp knows no rest. There are
now twenty-four hours of broad day
light to every day and twenty hours
of warm, bright sunlight. And there
is ;i general Indisposition on the part
of the Inhabitants to sleep. ThÂ» hours
claimed by night in San Francisco â
from 6 o'clock of the evening until 6
of the mornin.g â are the pleasanttSt of
the day, being cooler and the light
Bubdued, although for nine hours
of that time the sun is above the hori
zon. For this reason many sleep dur
ing the warm hours of the day and the
are full of life every hour of
the so-called night.
Thef Is one little pause once a week
In th<' hurlyburly. Commissioner
Walph h;is pronounced a Sunday law.
At 12 o'clock sharp on Saturday, niprht
business BtOps, particularly that of the
saloons, including gambling. in such
prr-.-a respect is this regulation held
that neither friendship, love nor money
can procure a drink over :i bar after
12 o'clock midnight of Saturday or be
fore mi'hiitrht of Sunday. The big Jag
of the week is given these few hours
in which to recover itself and know the
Joy of starting anew.
JJoney or dust flows into town daily
nnd thence finds lodgment across the
bare, or over thÂ«Â» faro and poker tables.
The two commercial companies get a
big share of it and finally the banks
get some. There are two banks here
now, operating under canvas, both Ca
nadian institutions.
The clean-up on the creeks is some
thing more than half completed and is
suffering a pause for lack of water, odd
as that seems, following so soon after
a Hood. The warm sun of the quick
ly lengthened days turned the snow
into water and the whole ran off with
n rush. Much good dirt was carried
away, dams and sluices broke and
very considerable loss and damage
were suffered. When the water had
gone many of the dumps located so
high as not to make available the
water of the creek were stillâ and still
remainâ unwashed. Theee are now
awaiting some expected August rains.
Whether or not it is because of the
insistent enforcement of the 10 per
cent royalty law by Commissioner
Walsh, I am not at this moment pre
pared to say, but certain it is there is
an air of disappointment in the town
with regard to the gold output. Al
most all now shade down the figures of
their estimate as made early in the
spring. The total is variously placed
at from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000. Alex
ander McDonald, the largest operator
in the district, places it at $20,000,000.
In the spring and before the arrival of
Commissioner Walsh it generally was
believed that the Government would
not enforce the royalty law. This hope
has failed, however, and the exaction
of this big percentage of the output
causes widespread disgust and disap
pointment. Great as the yield is, there
fore, there is a certain sense of depres
sion in the caran. among the miners,
and nowhere is there any disposition to
boom properties that are being worked,
or to give out inflated reports of the
output. Many of the miners have large
indebtednesses to meet and Commis
sioner Walsh allowed them fifteen days
after the completion of the clean up in
which to meet these engagements be
fore making their returns to the Gov
ernment. Royalty has already been
paid into the banks, which are author
ized to make the collection upon $8,000,
000. chiefly taken out of El Dorado
Creek.
It is reasonably certain to say that
the clean-up on the lower Bonanza â
that is. Bonanza below Discovery, from
about 9 below â has been really dis
appointing. Bonanza above Discovery
has more than met expectation; this is
true also of El Dorado.
My estimate of Dominion Creek, as
Riven in The Call of April 19. has been
verified and even emphasized by the
report of the Government inspectors of
the creek â McGregor, Norwood and
Cadenhead. They speak of Dominion
Creek as showinrr the richest prospects
of any of the creek?, so far as develop
ment has sone. The creek Is surveyed
from above Upper Discovery to 120 be
low Lower. The confusion which re
sulted fmm the recording of the dis
coveries on this creek and which has
resulted in tying up some of the best
property on the creek, is now about to
be adjusted. Gold Commissioner Faw
cett began the hearing of the cose this
morning. The sworn testimony of
every claim owner on the creek will be
taken. The discovery will be fixed
from this and as betweeen
the several overlapping claims will be
rendered and the property thfe re
leased from embarrassment and set on
the road toward speedy development.
Sulphur Creek is turning out fully as
rich as its early prospects indicated.
These creeks are still in the prospecting
stage and should they fulfill their prom
ise they will be sufficient alone to sus
tain the camp at Dawson for several
years.
The two river steamers of the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company, the Hamilton and the Por
te us B. Weare, now at the docks.pre
paring to go down the river, will carry
with them about four millions in gold.
The total shipment of gold to the
outside is most difficult to arrive at,
but will not fall short of eight millions.
Porteus B. Weare, head of the
North American Transportation Com
pany, who has just arrived via Dyea,
is making a general survey of the sit
uation, and is much pleased with all
the indications. He started up the
creeks this morning.
So much for that picture. Now for
this:
Ten thousand people on the way to
Dawson or already crowding its streets
feel the touch of the depression that is
here, despite the heaps of gold in sight.
The throng is depressed because of its
own greatness. So many new comers
are here that they cannot see how it
may be possible to supply all with
work. They feel that anything less
than overleaping the output must re
sult in a cut of wages at least, if not
a lack of work for many.
Many of these new comers are of the
most helpless character, and already
grave forecastings are made concern
ing thorn anent the long winter that is
coming. It is pitiful to see them sit
ting in their boats along the water
front, at the end of their long and hur
ried journey, utterly at a loss what to
do now that they arc here.
The gold commissioner is hourly be
sieged by men asking him to please tell
them where there is a creek upon
which they can stake a gold mine.
Numbers of the more alert new com
ers, men who came into the country
with a .sturdy purpose to mine, are, af
ter a short stay here, passing by Daw
son and hurrying down to the plentiful
diggings on the American side.
The American side, broadly speak
ing, is enjoying a boom. Every day
sees the interest in the diggings grow,
as the most encouraging reports are
brought here. New diggings are re
ported in the old Forty Mile District,
said to be very rich. Big prospects
have been found and much prospecting
is being" done on American Creek. So
great if the rush down there that a
number of new towns have been start
ed, the newest among them being Eagle
City, at the mouth of Mission Creek,
into which American Creek flows. Star
City was the original of the place, but
it was so badly washed out by the
spring flood that the inhabitants
moved up the river a little way to
higher ground and called the new lo
cation Eagle.
A big stampede went down from here
B month ago, not only to locate mining
claims, but to stake town lots at thp
mouth of Mission Creek. It is pro
posed to control the old and new Forty
Mile District from Eagle City by an
all-American route. By going up Mis
sion Creek and crossing an easy divide,
the head waters of Forty Mile Creek
are entered upon. As all the rich
diggings of this district, together with
the newly discovered diggings on its
tributaries, are in American territory.
It is easy to understand this effort to
THE SAX FRANCISCO CAKL, TUESDAY, JULY 19, 1898.
place the supply depot on the Ameri
can side.
Many miners are going down to Ram
part City and the Minook diggings, up
the Tanana and the Koyukuk. Cap
tain W. H. Geiger has taken his little
steamer St. Michael to the mouth of
the river for a cargo and will return
and go up the Koyukuk with as many
passengers as he can carry.
Considerable anxiety is felt concern
ing the boats that are coming up the
river, especially the boats of the new
companies. The old companies are
said to have secured all the best pilots
on the river for their service and to
have control of the wood cut last win
terâwhat of it there is left, for the
flood carried away a great part of that
which was cut by the Indians and the
unprovisioned contingent between here
and Fort Yukon.
The fact that so many boats on the
river between these two points have
run aground gives excuse for this an
xiety. The May West has made a good
escape. She brought twenty-six very
forlorn-looking passengers Into port
with her. They had been wintering
away down the river and put in most of
the time worrying the captain. He
had guaranteed to land them at Daw
son and to feed them until he did so.
He had not counted on being caught in
the ice 1000 miles from his destination
and he was short of food for the filling
of his contract. Some of his passen
gers had a mortgage on his boat and
they threatened to tie her up here, or
at Circle City. Captain Worth, a hale
and hearty man at St. Michael last
summer, arrived here a haggard and
broken-down man, having lost forty
two pounds in weight since his cruise
beeran. Of all the trouble that the
frozen river witnessed last winter in all
its great length. Captain Worth says
his own case was the worst. He would
not go through it again for a fortune.
The difficulty with the passengers
was adjusted here and the boat re
leased to go and work out her indebted
ness. Besides Captain Worth and
Steward Harry Gifford, she brought the
following pasengers who had wintered
with her:
11. H. Honnen, John Tyler, James Carr,
Frank Hoor. Harry Numan, J. A. Ander
son, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Clark, all of
Seattle; Henry Shoemaker of Grass Val
ley, Cal.; James Flanner, Helena, Mont.;
Mr. Adams, New York; Will Lindsay.
Port Townsend; John Miller and Fred
Heath, Taooma; Al Mole, Denver; Will
Campbell and Will Dwyer, Leadville:
Mr. Scott. Mr. Cole, Mr. Robbins, Mr.
Schulte and Mr. Dunham, San Francisco;
Frank Holt, California; Mr. Todd, Oak
land; Charles Range, Idaho, and Alex Mc-
Donald, Michigan.
On her return trip down the river she
took seventy passengers, the first to
seek the outside by way of the mouth
of the river this year. Many of them
are miners and they took out consider
able treasure, but how much it was im
possible to learn from them here ns
they greatly fear an attack upon the
boat.
Captain Ray and others who have
been watching people and events down
the river this winter are convinced that
there is an organized gang of thugs
which has been planning for sudden
riches in that way and that an attempt
to hold-up the boats may be looked for
and should be guarded against.
The steamer Victoria, having re
turned from her first run to Pelly River,
left last evening for the Pelly again,
carrying some seventy passengers.
They will be met at the Dalton trail by
saddle horses and expect to reach salt
water in eleven days from this date.
The little steamer A. J. Goddard of
the Upper Yukon Company arrived two
days ago direct from Bennett. She
starts to-night on her return.
The special war edition of The Call
came in from Dyea in eight days.
Crossing the mountains, taking boat at
Ltnderman, making the portage from
Llnderman to Bennett, taking boat
again at Bennett and rowing against a
head wind almost all the way, but keep
ing at the oars day and night, two men,
one resting and sleeping while the other
worked, brought this great edition and
the Calls were on sale In the streets of
Dawson on the eighth day after they left
the ocean front at Dyea and brought
the first big news of the war to Dawson.
I arrived at Lake Linderman on the
18th of May. to find it still icebound.
I remained there and at Lake Bennett
ten days and still the ice remained. I
returned over the Chilkoot Pass to get
a later edition of the paper than I car
ried in the first instance, and with it
left Dyea on the afternoon of June 7
and arrived in Dawson the night of the
15th. The ice had been out of Bennett
several days when I arrived there the
second time.
I passed more than two thousand
boats on the way down. At Tagish,
where a stop was required by the
Northwest mounted police, the bank
was fringed with boats for a mile. At
the head of Lake Labarge they were
tied up for two miles. A strong head
wind was blowing and no man would
start out on the thirty miles of water
in the face of it: so they had been as
sembling there for three days.
Suddenly the wind changed and a
thousand sails were lifted almost in
concert. In a half hour the whole face
of the lake was dotted with every va
riety of craft and sail. Soon the line
stretched as the speedier got away, and
extended as far into the distance as
the eye could see.
It was a brave, stirring picture, the
seemingly unnumbered sails careening
before the wind over the swelling sur
face of the water.
Somewhere in the crowd, a cornet in
the hands of some one who knew how
to play it sent "The Star Spangled
I Banner" floating across the lake. Not
i a sound broke in upon it from the first
' note to the finish. But before that
I wonderful echo of Lake Labarge had
finished its repetition a cheer ran down
â¢ the whole length of that moving line.
i Then it came back to the starting
point and returned down again. Again
I and aernin it made the circuit, each
I time with new enthusiasm until the
cornist struck in with the first notes
of "Hail Columbia." He was listened
to intently as before, and at the con
clusion the seenÂ» was repeated, and m
this inspiring way Lake Labarge was
crossed.
And no man who was thei c will ever
forget that scene. Indeed, the same
may be said of the whole :un down.
The crush was so great at the canyon
and White Horse that the procession
through those dangerous waters was
almost continuous. ThÂ» banks on b<~>th
sides of the river below the White
Horse were strewn for a mile with
wrecked boata and goods laid out to
dry.
C. J. Harmon and J. Boyd, both of
Pan Francisco, were drowned there on
June fi.
In Thirty Mile River I counted the
wrecks of twenty-two boats. The
smokestack of the little steamer Kala
mazoo was protruding above the water
just below a certain rock about mid
way down and famous among those
who travel that river.
This is a strange land. Just now it is
a land of summer and sunshine. The
banks of the great river are abloom
with wild flowers. The sun does not
set and the birds do not sleep, but sing
always.
Following immediately upon a great
outflow of ice a fleet of five thousand
boats sails down the Yukon in search of
gold, and the prow of almost every one
of them bears a woman's name. It is
by these signs that they dareâ "Sadie."
"Marie," "Helen," "Catherine," "Mary."
Ah, summer and winter, this is one of
the great spectacles in the long story of
the world. And it is all summed up in
the name of the boat. This is the why
of this tremendous hazard of new for
tunes.
OUTPUT ESTIMATED
BY A DAWSON BANKER
VANCOUVER, B. C. July 18.âWil
liam Godfeey, local manager for the
Bank of British North America, to-day
received an official communication from
the branch at Dawson City, which was
opened on May 19, it being the first
bank to commence business in the Yu
kon district. D. Doig, who was sent up
as manager of the bank, claims to have
thoroughly looked into .mining condi
tions since his arrival and he does not
think the output will be much more
than $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 this year.
He bases his low estimate on the fact
that many good mines have not been
worked, miners early in the winter hav
ing been driven up to Circle City by the
famine. Gold is passing as currency,
he says, at $17 an ounce. When the
mines are thoroughly worked the clean
up will be enormous. Already the Gov
ernment had collected $400,000 in
royalty.
Manager Doig writes that the Bank
of British North America is doing busi
ness in a large tent with a wooden floor.
It is constructing a two-story building
of logs and pays $9 each for the logs.
Twenty-five thousand people were in
Dawson on June 2S, the day the letter
was written.

WAS GRANTED AN INJUNCTION

Mayor Snyder Will Direct Citizens
to No Longer Pay the Company
for the Water They
Consume.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 18.â The Los
Angeles City Water Company to-da y
applied for and was granted a tem
porary Injunction restraining- the Mayor
and Council from taking possession of
the water company's plant on the ex
piration of the thirty-year lease next
Saturday. The order is returnable on
Monday, when an application will be
made for a permanent injunction, i
Should the city fail to answer at that |
time the water company asks the court
to proceed to name arbitrators to llx '
the value of the company's plant and to
enter judgment for the amount of the
value so determined.
The Injunction proceedings are no
surprise to Mayor Snyder and the Cit^
Council, as they were expected. Tue
city will answer next Monday and ask
to have the proceedings dismissed. It
is understood that on Saturday nflXt
the Mayor will issue a proclamation di
recting the citizens to no longer pay
rates to the water company for water
consumed, but to pay the amount into
â¦he city treasury. The water company
officials say that if this is done they
will cut off service from consumers
failing to pay to their representatives
the regular rates. This is liable to
cause complications.
The City Council to-day la'i all the
water propositions, Including that of
Kessler & Co., on the table, except the
one matter of selecting the city's arbi
trator, who is to be one of three to de
termine the value of the watt?r com
pany's improvements. This action was
expected and clears the deck Tor some
procedure along the lines of municipal
ownership.
An ordinance was introduced In the
Council providing for and creating a
municipal water department of the city
government. It is quite lengthy and
detailed. It provides for the carrying
on of a municipal water plant, the col
lection of rates at the present figures
and for the maintenance of the sys
tem. This ordinance was presented
by the City Attorney and was in the
nature of a surprise.
A mass meeting of Democrats was
held to-night at Turn Verein Hall, at
tended by about 200 people. The ob
ject was to condemn the Democratic
City Committee for indorsing the Kess
ler proposition, and resolutions to that
effect were adopted. A. R. Burke acted
as chairman of the meeting. Consid
erable bitterness was aroused by the
speeches. Frank James was in favor
of having an investigation made, and,
if it was found that any members of
the committee had been unduly influ
enced by coin, he wanted them read
out of the party.
Judge A. J. King made a bitter
speech denunciatory of the action of
the committee, which he styled the
basest treachery. Members of the
committee present were accorded a
hearing after loudly demanding it, and
Earl Rotrers defended their conduct.
He admitted, however, that he believed
the action indorsing the Kessler prop
osition was a mistake. The action of
the city committee has hopelessly di
vided the Democratic party in this city.
The Republican committee, the Un
ion Reform League and the League for
Better City Government have declared
against the Kessler scheme.

Charges Filed Against
Tourtillott and Mrs.
Madigan.
Charles L. Williams Formally
Accuses the Attaches of
Immoral Conduct.
SAN JOSE, July 18.â Formal charges
were filed to-day against T. T. Tourtll
lott, secretary to the medical superin
tendent of the Agnews State Hospital,
and against Mrs. Madigan, one of the
attendants at the same institution.
The communication containing the
charges was put into the mail this
afternoon and addressed to T. S. Mont
gomery, secretary of the board of man
agers, by Charles L. Williams, husband
of the young woman who alleged in an
affidavit that she was discharged from
the asylum on the demand of Frank
H. Gould, because she knew too much
about Tourtillott, who is a half-brother
of Gould, and Mrs. Madigan.
This clears the way of all technicali
ties and throws the doors open to the
most sweeping of investigations. Here
tofore it has been the excuse of the
Gould majority of the board that It
would be useless to call a special ses
sion of the board to Investigate the
many recent charges against attaches
of the asylum, because no charges had
been formally filed. The Issue now has
been fairly and squarely presented to
the directors, and how they will meet
It remains to be seen.
Mr. Williams' charges not only are
clear and specific, but his communica
tion gives a list of eight witnesses, who
will, It is asserted, prove "valuable and
important." His action was hastened
by the attack made by Gould on all
who had dared to utter a word of criti
cism on the present administration at
Agnews.
Mr. Williams' views on the present
situation are best told in his own
words. He said:
"That was a remarkable reflection of
Mr. (Jould when he said that those who
are out are doing all the kicking and
attempting to slander his good brother.
The whole object of the dictatorial ad
ministration has been to proscribe
those who murmur. 'Open your mouth
against me or mine, and you take a
hasty walk down the avenue with your
grip, 1 has been the programme carried
out In every instance.
"None know this better than those
who are filling positions in the State
Hospital under the present regime.
I This very trouble, this miserable con-
I dition of affairs is solely due to the ef
j forts of Director Gould to compel
j every one to bow and cringe before
him. This is the root of all the mischief.
"Director Gould in his interview in
The Call says: 'The reason these so
called scandals have arisen is that in
competent, untruthful and vicious peo
ple have been turned out to make room
for competent, truthful and kindly per
sons. It has been one continual strug
gle for the board of directors for more
than a year past to counteract the evil
influences of persons here, most diffi
cult at times to identify. There is not
a statement made derogatory to this
institution that is not supported by the
statements of people discharged from
here because of their lncompetency, un
truthfulness or cruelty.'
"I shall submit at the forthcoming In
vestigation a number of recomenda
tions which were given where Mrs.
Williams is concerned. These are
the recommendations I refer to,"
said Mr. Williams, as he pro
duced three letters. "These re
commendations are from Dr. F.
W. Hatch, formerly medical superin
tendent at Agnews, and now a member
of the State Lunacy Commission; from
Dr. J. R. Curnow, chairman of the
board of managers of the Agnews State
Hospital, and from Dr. Leonard Stock
ing, senior assistant physician at the
hospital. They show that during the
seven years Mrs. Williams was employ
ed at Agnews she established an en
viable record on the very points
charged against her by Director Gould.
The recommendations are as follows:

FORMAL ACCUSATION FILED
WITH THE ASYLUM BOARD
SANTA CLARA. July 18. 1898.
To the Honorable Board of Managers Agncws State Hospital, Ag
news, Cal. â Sirs: I have the unpleasant duty before me of caliing the
attention of your honorable body to matters that have come to my
knowledge from what I consider a thoroughly reliable source, which go
to show that two of the employes of the Agnews State Hospital under
your charge have been guilty of What, to put it in the mildest possible
form, was a course of conduct highly improper and open to the gravest
suspicions, while at the same time it was a flagrant violation of certain
rules and regulations of the Agnews State Hospital.
The two employes referred to are Mr. T. T. Tourtillott. secretary to
the medical superintendent of the hospital, and Mrs. K. Madigan, head
attendant in one of the wards of the hospital.
The acts complained of in connection with the said Mr. Tourtillott
and the said Mrs. Madigan are that the latter at unseemly hours of the
night on various occasions was found in the room of the former; that
the said Mr. Tourtillott and the said Mrs. Madigan have been discovered
together in other apartments than their own in the Agnews State Hos
pital at late hours of the night, and that the said Mr. Tourtillott was
discovered in an attempt to surreptitiously leave the room of the said Mrs.
Madigan about 5 o'clock in the morning of a certain day in February.
Such conduct being subversive of good morals and discipline and
therefore decidedly injurious to the welfare and good reputation of an
institution charged with the care of some 900 unfortunate men and
women. I feel it incumbent upon me to place these matters before your
honorable board, coupled with the request that you immediately begin a
thorough, sweeping and conscientious investigation of this matter and
such other irregularities and offenses in connection with the administra
tion of affairs at the Agnews State Hospital as may be developed in the
course of the investigation of the charges herein specified.
For the purpose of aiding you in this matter I herewith submit a list
of the names of people, who, according to my best information, will prove
valuable and important witnesses. These witnesses are:
T. T. Tourtillott, secretary to the medical superintendent at the hos
ptial.
Mrs. Kate Madigan, attendant at the hospital.
Miss Ella Ro-se, formerly matron at the hospital.
Mrs. Z. B. White, attendant at the hospital.
F. P. Kerns, outside night watch at the hospital.
Miss Rose Ryan, assistant attendant at the hospital.
Mrs. M. D. Chaplin, formerly an attendant at the hospital.
Mrs. Olivia B. Williams, formerly night watch in the female depart
ment at the hospital.
Yours sincerely. CHARLES L. WILLIAMS.

now free to explain that I simply
wished to put the board on record, and
this I have accomplished. Had Mrs.

have resigned immediately. What we
sought was a vindication of her com

SANTA ROSA'S CHURCH WAR
OVEB A HUNDRED MEMBERS
WITHDRAW.
Indorse the Advanced Ideas of the
Deposed Minister and Will
Organize a New Con
gregation.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA ROPA, July 18.â The dis
sension in the First Christian Church
of this city has culminated in a rupture.
Over one hundred members have with
drawn from the church and they will
at once perfect a new organization.
When at the last regular business
meeting of the church body it was de
cided, by the narrow margin of two
votes, not to renew the call of the
pastor, Rev. Jay William Hudson, it
was predicted the action would divide
the congregation. Rev. Mr. Hudson
was deposed by the efforts of certain of
the more conservative members of his
flock who were of the opinion that his
views on certain orthodox questions
were too advanced. The presentation
yesterday of a letter of formal with
drawal, signed by 101 of the most prom
inent member?, evidences that the be
lief was based upon more than idle
rumor.
At the meeting held two weeks ago,
when It was finally decided not to re
new the call, Mr. Hudson, with charac
teristic firmness, during the course of
a strong speech said:
On this principle of liberty of thought
I stand to-night, and If I am again called
to the pulpit of this church I want it to
bo on this principle on which my coun
try is founded, and which should he the
only creed of the church universal. If
you cannot give me the liberty of my
Individual conscience I ask you to extend
me no call, for I can give to the world
no less grand principle.
The result of the vote, which showed j
that of the members present 7S were
against and 76 in favor of Mr. Hudson
and his Ideas, occasioned the warmest
discussion. Friends of the pastor openly \
charged that the meeting had been
"packed" with members who had not ;
been in the church for years and who
were not even acquainted with Mr.
Hudson. It was declared that had it
been generally known such action was
contemplated the pastor's friends could
have had out enough members to make
the vote two to one in his favor. This
was denied by the opposition.
A few days ago Mr. Hudson, hearing
that certain members were contemplat
ing withdrawing their membership
from the church, addressed to them the I
following letter. It failed to change
their plans, however, as subsequent
events proved:
To Members of the First Christian
Church: Information has reached me
concerning the intention of many influ
ential members and workers of the First
Christian Church to withdraw from that
body because of it 6 recent action regard
ing a principle for which I have stood. I
urge you to consider well the step you
are contemplating. If you can consist
ently remain in the church and work with
its mf-mber? In harmony I would earnest
ly counsel you, regardless of myself, in
the interest of unity to remain.
If, on the other hand, after careful con
sideration, you find it impossible to con
tinue in harmony Â«"ith the church in its
present policy, an*' If your withdrawal

to this principle o. berty, I cannot but
leave the matter to your individual con
sciences, knowing that principle is more
than church and character than creed.
Sincerely, your pastor,
JAY WILLIAM HUDSON.
The following is the letter of with
drawal. When it was presented yes
terday Mr. Hudson, who was then of
ficiating for the last time, spoke strong
ly against church divisions, but said he
felt compelled to accord to all the same
right to freedom of thought in this mat
ter that he claimed in ail things:
We, tho under^gned, workers and mem
bers of the Christian church, believing
that the action of the church at its re
cent annual meeting is contrary to ob- |

principles of liberty of conscience, and
feeling that said action must Irretrievably
prevent our future work from partaking

The so-called "advanced ideas" of
Rev. Mr. Hudson, which were the cause
of the rupture, relate to his belief as to
the hereafter. He refuses to be bound
by what he considers the too narrow
creed of the church. For example, he
is willing to admit that others may be
saved than those who subscribe to the
Christian church doctrines and even
many who do not belong to or attend
any church. He insists that each one
is "personally responsible to God for his

in their work. A striking example is
the conduct of the Bcapegoats who find
themselves in the guard house. They
are put at hard work policing the camp,

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 19, 1898.
i Interpretation of Biblical doctrine
| should be the guide in life and that
I no person or set of persons has a divine
right to legislate for any other.
Mr. Hudson's personal worth and ex
! emplary life have endeared him to
j many people. When he took charge of
j the church he found the former pastor's
' salary was sonje $700 in arrears. In or
: der to clear up the books he contributed
! $150 from his $750 salary' toward the de
j flciency, although the former pastor's
salary was $1200, and his own hardly
| sufficient for his own needs. This is
; but one instance of his self-denial on
j behalf of his flock.
ENDS AN AGED
HERMIT'S LIFE
Tragedy on a Monterey
Ranch.
FIRES IN SELF-DEFENSE
YOUNG MEXICAN SPEEDS A
FATAL BULLET.
Attacked by an Old "Squatter" Who
Resented His Attempt to
Take Up Government
Land.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
MONTEREY, July 18.â Vicente Esco
bar, a Mexican, employed on one of
the Sargent ranches near this place,
shot and killed Panciano Manjares, an
aged Mexican hermit, to-day and im
mediately came to Monterey to give
himself up to the officers. The trouble
arose over a land claim which Escobar
had taken up and which Manjares dis
puted.
Escobar, accompanied by Joe An
dratte, was passing through a portion
of Sargent's San Franciscito Rancho at
about 9 o'clock this morning, on his
way to his own claim five miles further
on, when he was stopped by Manjares
and told to get out. The old man swore
he would allow no man to take up a
claim in that locality, and If Escobar
did not at once turn back he would
kill him. Manjares then disappeared,
and Escobar, knowing his assailant to
be a man of ugly temperament, went
on rapidly toward his claim.
While they were stopping to cook
breakfast the two men saw Manjares
approach with a rifle. As he drew near
he leveled it at Escobar. Andratte en
deavored to argue with Manjares, but
the latter was thoroughly enraged and
declared that if Escobar did not move
at once he would shoot Andratte
rushed forward to get possession of the
rifle, but was pushed aside, and Just as
Manjares pulled the trigger, Escobar,
who had seized his own rifle from the
ground, fired. Manjares fell, expiring
instantly.
Escobar came Into town this after
noon, having walked from the scene of
the killing, and gave himself into the
custody of Constable Hernandez. An
dratte and Jose Boronda, the latter of
whom heard the shots from a distance
and reached the scene to find Man
jares dead, arrived later and gave their
account of the killing.
Manjares was about 83 years old.
He was known as a "squatter" on other
people's land, had been in several af
frays of like character, always making
trouble and never owning land himself.
Escobar's claim was on Government
land, on which Manjares had
"squatted."

PV INDUSTRIES 1 A YEAR,ALL TROOPS TO BE MOVED
TO THE PRESIDIO AT ONCE
WHEN the order was Issued
designating the Bay District
grounds, now known as Camp
Merritt, as the place of ren
dezvous for Incoming troops, sur
prise was expressed that the Presidio
was not used for camping purposes.
Greater surprise followed when troops
encamped at the Presidio were moved
from the reservation to Cajnp Mer
ritt. A? the number of troops at Rich
mond Increased the military authorities
saw that a mistake had been made in
the location of the camp.
Shortly after the first expedition pall
ed it was announced by The CaJl that
the regiments remaining at the Bay
District camp would be moved to the
Presidio. That decision was reached by
the military authorities after due con
sideration of the subject, but the order
giving force and effect to the decree
â¢was never promulgated. The plan In
fact was reconsidered during the night
following the day of its adoption. The
next day it was explained at military
headquarters that the camp at Rich
mond would be abolished by a process
of disintegrationâ as regiments were
moved away for service at the Philip
1 inea the camp wuuld disintegrate and
vanish.
In the establishment of the camp at
the Bay District track and in the trans
fer <â : troops from the reservation to
the Richmond District the volunteers
were not benefited in either health or
discipline. The chief gainer in the
change was the Market Street Railway
Company. That corporation got the
nickels from the 15.000 troops at Camp
Merritt and from the countless thou-

â¢J "I am not very favorably Impressed with Camp Merritt as a camping:- 82
52 place." paid Colonel Barber of the First New York Regiment to Major Gen- &
?i eral Merriam on last Friday afternoon. The New Yorkers had pitched their 22
% tents at Camp Merrltt, and Colonel Barber had carefully Investigated the Jjj
% sanitary conditions of the grounds. "Is It not possible to get a healthier loca- 8J
?* tion for my men?" he asked of General Merriam. 53
52 "Yes. It is possible." promptly responded General Merriam. "I shall send &
32 your regiment to the Presidio to-morrow. I have for several diys been con- ?jj
52 sideling the removal of the entire force from Camp Merrltt to the Presidio, 52
52 and I might as well begin at once with your regiment." â¢Â»Â»
li And the New Yorkers moved over to the Presidio on Saturday morning. 52
52 All the other troops will follow during the. week. Â»,
52 It was not supposed at the beginning that the Philippine expeditionary %
52 forces would remain so long at Camp Merritt, but their prolonged stay has 22
52 been due to the unexpected scarcity of transports. Camp Merritt was un- f.'
% der the jurisdiction of Major General Otis, but when he took his depart- &
52 ure It came under the control of Major General Merriam, who at once de- |$g
52 termlned upon taking steps either to remedy the evils or move the troops J2
52 away. The report of Colonel J. V. D. Middleton, chief surgeon on General 52
?2 Merrlam's staff, which was handed in on Sunday, has no doubt hastened â¢*
*. matters. Incidentally, Colonel Midd!cton said he did not know who had rec- 52
52 ommended the Bay District race tra^k as a camp ground. It is a place that *2
*i never should have been selected, he added, as it is entirely unfit for any such 5Â°
It purpose Â£
fg The various regiments and organisations upon their removal to the Pre- *2
% sldio will have to be scattered, as the nature of the grounds will prevent fa
52 them being all concentrated in one location. The chief difficulty will be the *2
* t water supply, but this is to be overcome by a distribution, among the va- Â«2
% rious camps by means of water carts, a large number of which will be imme- 52
52 dlately procured. General Merriam is anxious to effect a quick removal as 92
52 he does not care to be censured in case an epidemic'' of any kind should *2

THE FIRST NEW YORK.
Promotion From the Ranks of
the Regiment â Social Ambi-
tions Cut No Figure
in the Camp
Three members of the First Now York
Volunteer Regiment were yesterday
raised from the ranks.
Corporal Michael J. Reagan of Company
P. and First Sergeant Edward F. New
comb of Company A received their com
missions as socond lieutenants in the Two
Hundred and Second New York Regi
ment. Thf-y wore mustered out of the
service by '"olonel Barber and Riven hon
ornhle discharges. This arrangement was
necessary in order to comply with the
service regulation. The men will leave
for Albany (in Thursday, where they will
again be mustered in.
Sergeant Major Goodale received his
commission as second lieutenant. Com
pany X of the First. His promotion was
tho result of Captain Goodyear's eleva
tion to the rank of major. This change
resulted in the promotion of two other
oftirors of the company. First Lieutenant
Pickard has been made captain and Sec-
Lleutenant Wood advanced to the
rai k of first lieutenant.
M( it riant Reagan has been for many
In tho Bureau of Labor Statistics
of New York State. Under the admlnls
tration of Governor Black he has been
Dip confidential adviser of the State La
bor <'<Â»mmissioner. He was a member of
the N'.-Ulonal Guard for many years.
Lieutenant Newcomb comes from a
wealthy Albany family. Before leaving
camp at Hempstead he received assur
ances that ho would r>o given a commis
sion. At the timo he refused to sever his
connection with tho First Regiment for
the proffered advancement. Then he
was in hopes that he would receive a
commission in his own regiment. But the
vacancies in tho First were filled, as a
rule, from outside sources. Newcomb's
only promotion was to the ran Id of first
pr-rgoant. He did not accept a tommls-
Fion In the Two Hundred and Second until
after a long talk yesterday with Colonel
Barber.
Second lieutenant Goodale was a pri- !
rate in the separate Blnghampton com
pany when the war broke out. He gave
up his interest in one of the largest whole
sale clothing concerns in the State of New
York to go to the front. At Hempstead
be was made sergeant major, with the as- !
suranee that he would be selected to fill
the first vacancy in the ranks of the com- '
missioned officers.
Corporal Amos Potter, nephew of Bish
op Potter, has received word from Wash
ington that he will be nominated for a
commission as second lieutenant in the
regular army whenever he likes. In order
to make his appointment valid he wl'.l
have to pass the regulation examination
for the rank. Potter has not yet decided
whether to accept the tendered nomina
tion. He is the pride of Company A and a
sort of hero among the privates of the
regiment. It was Potter who bought tne
little bear and the old black crow that
have been adopted as mascots of the First
New York.
Colonel Barber and the officers of the
regiment are greatly exercised over state
ments printed in certain papers to the ef
fect that they aro more wrapped up in
their social ambitions than in the per
formance of their duties as soldiers.
In the article to which they have taken
exception they were referred to as a lot
of kid-glove incompetents, and many
sneering allusions were made to their
wealth and social cast. Colonel Barber
is of the opinion that a man Bhould not
be criticised for the simple reason that ",.e
has been interested in successful business
ventures. With practically all the other
officers and many of the men in the ranks
of the First New York he has given up
and practically sacrificed his business in
terest in order to go to the front.
The article also referred to the regi
ment as a collection of "tenderfeet," be
cause they refused to remain encamped
in the slush of Camp Merritt. As soon
as the tents of the regiment were pitched
on the stretch of sand and decayed mat
ter composing the old Bay District track
Surgeon Davis reported to Colonel Bar
ber that the health of the men was en
dangered every day they remained there.
The condemnation of the site yester
day by the proper officials Colonel Barber
believes to be an official vindication of
his act in refusing to allow his men to
remain In the camp.
In accordance with the regulations the
work of vaccinating the members of the
First New York at the Presidio reserva
tion was begun yesterday morning. All
the members of Company A were under
the surgeon's needles during the fore
noon. The vaccinations will be completed
this evening.
Colonel Barber ordered the evening pa
rade of the regiment yesterday at sun
down. It was the first general drill of
the entire regiment since the breaking
of the camp at Hempstead. The men left
their tents in columns of fours and after
a number of maneuvers formed the regi-
| mental line, after which they again
I formed fours and marched to the rear
yf their tents, where the three battalions
: rormed en masse.
Owing to the indisposition of Colonel
Barber, who haa been compelled to ke^p
his room at the University Club, Lieuten
ant Colonel . Stacpole was In command.
A number of visitors watched the parade
and were much impressed by the thor
ough manner in which the drill was man
aged. The men marched and maneu
vered with the precision of regulars. A
regimental parade will be held every
evening at sundown.
| As soon as Colonel Barber recovers his
health he will occupy his tent, which has
i been pitched Just beyond the terminus
i of the cable railway at the Presidio.

FIRST MONTANA ON
THE PENNSYLVANIA
March of the Regiment and
First California Recruits
From Camp Merritt.
The First Montana Volunteers and thÂ«
300 recruits for the First California drop
ped their tents at Camp Merritt at 6
o'clock yesterday morning and at 8 o'clock
they marched off for their transports,
leaving two more desolate, wind-blown
sandlots to sadden the hearts of. those
who are left behind.
Colonel Kessier, First Montana, had
preceded his command to town and the
troops were in command of Lieutenant
Colonel Wallace. Brigadier General Otis,
accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel
Schreiber of the Seventu California, led
the column.
The line of march was taken along
Point Lobos avenue to Post street via
Central avenue, across from Post to
Golden Gate avenue by Van Ness and
down to East street by Golden Gate and
Market. Along East street to the Oceanic
dock the way was all but blocked by the
crowd that had gathered to see them off.
All along the line there was the wildest
enthusiasm. Both Montana and Califor
nia were cheered and cheered again; fire
bells clanged and guns roared out a noisy
good-by. The men themselves were al
lowed every liberty; they marched at a
route step and carried their seventy
pound packs as lightly as they did the
great bouquets of blossoms that were
showered on them. They took Post street
hill at a quick step and marched down
the other side chanting "A Hot Time"
with all the gusto of a lot of cadets oit
for a summer camp.
Only two men left the ranks, and they
were detailed to give chase to the mascot
of Company G, a black kitten, that es
caped from its place of concealment in
the corporal's haversack.
The crowd on Market street shut off all
traffic and all along the line to the trans
port the good-bys were given as heartily
as the departing blue coats got when
they left their own homes.
SCENES AT THE DOCK.
Colonel Kessler Advised to Call
on General Merriam for
Final Instructions.
Soon after entering the dock building
the soldiers were treated by the ladies of
the Red Cross to a lunch consisting of
sandwiches, eggs, doughnuts and coffee,
which they very much appreciated. The
ladies who had charge of the lunch were
Mrs. Judge Slack, Mrs. Lowenberg, Mrs.
Robert McKenzie, the Misses Tillinghast,
Miss Callahan. Mrs. Carroll Cook, Mrs.
Thurlow McMullan, Mrs. Will Bryan,
Miss Carrigan. Miss Cerf, Miss Macom
ber. Miss O'Sullivan, Miss Bates, Mrs.
Carrigan and Miss Steel. These lunches
were not served, however, until a little
trouble that had arisen owing to some ob
jections raised by Colonel Kessler had
been smoothed over.
It appears that the colonel thought that
the lunches of the Red Cross ladies were
not necessary. It was said by some of the
men that Colonel Kessler even gave utter
ance to the remark that "hardtack la
good enough for them." Other soldiers
who were asked about the matter stated
thai they had heard nothing of the kind,
and <:idn't believe Colonel Kessler had
&ald any such thing. One captain, how
ever, before the trouble was settled, what
ever it was, stated emphatically that his
men could eat as many lunches as they
pleased, and he would shoulder the re
sponsibility. It was also current rumor
on the dock that the ladies of the Red
Cvosa at first refused admission, and
that soroe of them were let in by the po
lice, ah other authority to the contrary
notwithstanding. A Montana private
wrote out the following and handed it tv
a Call reporter, with the request that it
be published:
"The members of the First Montana In
fantry beg that they be not judged by
their colonel. They know their friends
and appreciate more than they can say
the kindness shown them by the ladies of
the Red Cross, and deplore the action of
Colonel Kessler in refusing to accept that
kinoiiess to-day."
Alter the men had got on board the
Pennsylvania the usual scenes incident to
previous embarkations occurred. There
was a lively bombardment with oranges
from the crowd on the dock and from men
and boys in small boats. Brigadier Gen
eral Otis was struck in the neck and was
nearly knocked down. He took it good
naturedly, however, saying he had been
under fire before.
Of course some man had to fall off the
dock into the water to add variety to the
scene. His name was Charles McCarty,
and he might have gone to the bottom of
the sea had he not been rescued by Frank
Smith, who plunged into the bay after
him. Neither man was a soldier.
"Willie Burns, aged 14 years, who was
acting in the capacity of mascot for Com
pany X of the First Montana, was not al
lowed to go on board the Pennsylvania by
Colonel Kpssler. Mrs. A. S. Townsend,
whose sympathies were aroused for the
sorrowing and despondent lad, at once
started for the City Hall with the inten
tion of becoming his guardian, so that he
could be enlisted with the regiment and
sail this monfUng.
About 3 o'clock Lieutenant Bennett, as
sistant adjutant general on the staff or
Major General Merriam, appeared at the
dock and hunting up Colonel Kessler held
quite nn extended conversation with him.
Although no one heard what it was all
about, the report was started and soon
became general that Lieutenant Bennett
had brought orders countermanding the
departure of the First Montana. This was
a danipener on the ardor of the men from
Montana, who were at a loss to under
stand why any such action should be
taken. It was some little time before
the contradiction overtook the false re
port, and then the men resumed the even
tenor of their way. It has been the cus
tom hitherto of the commanders of trans*
port fleets or large vessels to call at mili
tary headquarters before pulling out into
the stream to receive their final instruc
tions. It seems that Colonel Kessler ow
ing to his multifarious duties and the
somewhat lively scenes on the dock had
either forgot this custom or had delayed
going to headquarters too long. Major
General Merriam, therefore, sent the in
structions by Lieutenant Bennett.
The Pennsylvania pulled out into the
stream at about 5 o'clock, and according
to the instructions received by Colonel
Ktbtler she will sail at 9:30 this morning.
HOSPITAL SHIP.
Government Decides to Meet
the Expense of the Red
Cress Enterprise.
On Saturday an official high In State
Red Cross circles received from Senator
Stewart of Nevada, now in Washington,
a menage stating the Government had
decided to stand the expense of a Red
Cross hospital ship for service between
this port and the Philippines.
Yesterday it was learned at headquar
ters that the 1200 bed division hospital,
the necessary supplies and service that
are being rushed in to the depot at this
time will sail from this port for the Phil
ippines not later than two weeks from
date.
The ambition of the Red Cross Society
has been to outfit and man with a com
plete working force a hospital ship. Along
this line they have been working for six
weeks or more past. The original idea
of soliciting donations from all Western
States and in that way meeting every ex
pense had already been put in active opei
ation, but it was suddenly stopped beroro

results to a large extent had accrued. In
timation was received that the Govern
ment had taken the matter up and would
care for its own. The telegram from Sen
ator Stewart announces the definite deci
sion of the administration.
The arrival of the big ship Scandia at
this port almost simultaneously with the
announcement of these two decisions is
said upon authority to be significant. Sho
was chartered at about the time that the
Government began preparations for the
proper hospltaling of the Philippine
forces. She is eminently fitted for hospi
tal purposes, and the plan, as understood
at headquarters, is to dispatch the Scan

corps for Manila.
CAMP AT THE PRESIDIO.
Good News for Washington
Volunteers â Dress Parade
on the Reservation.
A well-founded rumor, which Is said to
have come from a reliable and authentic
source, was in circulation at the Presidio
yesterday to the effect that the First Vol
unteer Regiment of Washington is to be
concentrated here. This report caused
considerable excitement and no little sat
isfaction among the Washington soldiers.
When interviewed upon the subject. Ma
jor J. J. Weisenburger, commanding the
First Battalion of the regiment, which is
now stationed at the Presidio, said: "I
understand the rumor is true, and if such
is the case I am very thankful. I have
command of the First Battalion, which is
here; Lieutenant Colonel Fife has the
Second at Angel Island, and Colonel J.
H. Whalley is with the Third at Vancou
ver Barracks. Under the second call a
new battalion has been organized in the
State, and as I understand it, this is to
relieve the Third at Vancouver, which
will then be ordered here. Thus the regi
ment will be gotten together as a whole,
and in my opinion this move will be at
tended with most gratifying results. I un
derstand the rumor to this effect Is true."
Private Charles W. Keese, Company B,
First Washington Regiment, Is danger
ously ill in t,he Presidio Hospital with
meningitis.
Captain Came, commanding the Utah
troop of cavalry, who has been in Salt
Lake City on a furlough, will return on
Thursday. Lieutenant Smith is command
ing in his absence.
Sergeant do Vigne of the troop has been
relieved from special duty at Camp Mer
ritt and ordered to rejoin his troop at the
Presidio.
The Third Battalion of the Second Regl
mont of Volunteer Engineers. Major
Langfelt commanding, is still in need of a
few recruits. The engineers are rapidly
being equipped, and in a short time they
will be ready for active service. Major
Langfitt Is putting the men daily through
a very severe drill that is fast rounding
them into shape.
Colonel Harber of the First Now York
is still at the University Club, where he
is confined to his room by a slight Indis
position, and in his absence Lieutenant
Colonel Stacpole is in command. The reg
iment Inaugurated its daily drills yester
day, with parade at 7 o'clock in the even
ing. This will be the chief feature every
day. The regiment is in great shape and
affairs and men alike are working hard to
be ready for the trip to the Orient when
orders come.
The Wyoming "Alger" Light Artillery
will in all probability be sent along with
the First New York, for garrison duty at
Honolulu. This is a rather recent devel
opment In the slate, but from what could
be learned, it is correct. The officers and
men expect to go. It was learned yester
day that Colonel Barber. First New York,
only accepted the assignment of garrison
duty for his regiment at Honolulu with
the understanding that the ultimate des
tination of his command should be the
Philippines. _
SEVENTH CALIFORNIA.
The President May Interpose
arid Order the Regiment
to the Front.
The powers that are of the Seventh Cal
ifornia Volunteers have decided to give
up their relying upon their efficiency,
their "set-up," their drill and other qual
ities of that sort, trivial to the minds of
political warriors, and instead to do as
others who have gone before have done,
enlist their powerful political influence
in order to bring gratification to their
strong desire to broach the Spanish fort
resses of Manila Bay.
The Seventh California has camped on
one wind-blown sand dune or another at
Camp Merritt since May 7. They have
watched one expedition after another
march out of camp and have possessed
their sorely tried souls in patience, hoping
that their splendid condition and perfect
equipment would place them next on the
list.
A letter from Washington, addressed to
& strong friend of the Seventh, one day
last week, shattered their dream of
"next." The Southern California regi
ment was awakened to the fact that a
number of its officers had been altogeth
er too prominent on the wrong end of the
San Pedro fight to suit the head of the
department that had that matter under
its jurisdiction.
There is still a good bit of politics left
in the Seventh's officers, even if the San
Pedro matter isn't pushing very hard.
They called an officers' meeting for Sat
urday night last and from all accounts it
was little short of an indignation meeting.
The status of affairs was discussed at
length and a concerted plan of action.
The novices in ball cartridge warfare
have fallen back on "high ball" politics,
in which they are not novices. The nec
essary strings are a-pull in Washington
and a bombardment is on from this end.
Senator Perkins has enlisted and only
yesterday Governor Budd wired a per
sonal message to President McKinley so
liciting recognition of the Seventh and
their rights of priority.
That the radical change in policy is al
ready productive of favorable symptoms
is demonstrated by the fact that Brigadier
General Otis said to a Call reporter on
Sunday that the "Seventh w<?uld leave
to-day if they had a ship."
He further stated that the first fleet of
transports that left this port is expected
by the department to be returned by the
30th inst. and that it would, according to
his understanding, sail again on the sth
or 6th of August."
EIGHTH CALIFORNIA.
Liberality of the Donahue Line
to the Members of the Regi-
ment Appreciated.
CAMP BARR-TT, SATHER STA
TION, Cal., July 18.â It has been decided
to move the regimental camp across the
electric railroad to the east of the pres
ent location within a day or two. The
regimental officers have considered all
the plans for bettering the drainage of
the camp and arrived at the conclusion
that the best thing to be done was to
get near enough to a sewer to connect,
so as to carry off all the waste water
from the kitchen faucets. The new site is
a long, narrow strip of land, which will
necessitate the disarrangement of the
present plan of the camp to some extent.
The matter of how the camp shall be laid
out is now being considered and as soon
as satisfactorily settled the order to move
will be issued.
The members of Company C, Petaluma;
Company D, San Rafael, and Company B,
Santa Rosa, received 10Â« tickets to-day
from A. W. Foster, president of the San
Francisco and North Pacific Railroad,
better known as the Donahue broad
gauge. The donation represents nearly
$S(X) in cash, and will enable every man of
toe three companies named to visit home
with only the fare to and from camp to
San Francisco. The tickets are round
trips and were sent to the captains com
manding the companies. When counter
signed by that official they will be hon
ored for the soldiers' passage from San
Francisco to either of the three towns as
designated. The news was received with
great pleasure by the rffen, but Colonel
Henshaw sees hundreds of applicants for
furloughs that the transportation may
be used.
A good joke Is going the rounds of the
camp on Captain William S. Barnes, Com
pany C, Petaluma, In company drill the
sets of fours march forty-four inches
apart. In one of the movements it becomes
necessary for the commandnig officer to
pass through between two sets of fours
and take his place on the other side. Cap
tain Barnes was somewhat slow in get
ting through and the lines closed some
what so that when he attempted to make
the change he crowded one of the fours
entirely out of place and broke up the line.
It is now said that hereafter Company C
will march with intervals of el|rhty-elght
Inches between fours, so that their cap
tain may always be able to get into his
place.
Captain William Elliott, Company D,
San Rafael, has repeatedly been mistaken
in camp for Captain Barnes. The latter
went down to Mountain View yesterday
to visit his wife and baby. Many of the
visitors had read or hoard of the large of
ficer, and frequently groups could be seen
watching Captain Elliott, while some one
was explaining to the others that it was
Captain Barnes.
The services at the Army Christian
Commission tent this evening were con
ducted by Rev. A. T. Needham of the
Eighth-avenue Methodist Church and
some of his young people. Tuesday, Wed
nesday and Thursday evenings Evangelist
Crittenton will occupy the tent with evan
gelistic services. The members of Com
pany X of Colusa will have a debate Fri
day night. Henri Fairweather of Ala
meda will sing patriotic songs, including
"Who's Afraid? a song written and ded
icated to Company G. Saturday evening
Rev. F. D. Bovard of Alameda will speak
to the soldiers.
While swimming last evening Van
Gretchen of Company L, Marysville,
threw his shoulder out of place. He was
taken to the hospital tent, where Dr.
Dudley ordered him to stand erect. The
quick response threw the bone back Into
place. He was discharged to-day as
cured, although somewhat lame from his
queer experience.
The guard detail to-night consists of
Captain P. T. Riley, Company I, Grass
Valley, officer of the day; Lieutenant S.
M. English, Company D, San Rafael, of
ficer of the guard, and Lieutenant F. S.
Drady, Company L, Marysville, super
officer of the guard.
The Catholic Truth Society erected a
large tent directly in front of their small
one this morning. This will give them
more room to entertain soldiers as well as
for reading and writing purposes.
County Assessor William Vanderbilt of
Marin County was a visitor in camp to
day. His son, Newell Vanderbilt, is first
sergeant of Company D.
FIRST SOUTH DAKOTA.
The Regiment Hourly Expect
ing to Break Camp and
Embark.
Colonel Frost, First South Dakota Vol
unteers, has not yet received his orders to
break camp and go aboard the steamship
Rio Janeiro, but he expects to secure his
instructions to-day. The regiment, how
ever, may not go aboard the ship until to
morrow or Thursday.
The route of march from Camp Merritt
to the Pacific Mall dock will be along
Point Lobos and Central avenues. Post,
Market and Second streets, to Brannan.
CLAIMS HE WAS CHOKED.
Chaplain Stull of the First Montana
Regiment claims that Captain Dunlevy
of the Harbor police treated him with
unnecessary roughness during some
trouble between embarking 1 soldiers at the
wharf yesterday morning. It is said tn<it
the matter has been reported to the Chief
of Police, and charges may be made
against the captain to the Commissioners.
The trouble is said to have come about
while Chaplain Stull was trying to attend
to the injuries of William Stanley, a pri
vate in the regiment, who was hit by one
of his comrades. Stanley made an assault
with a knife on Lieutenant J. G. Chelley
of his company and another private
struck Stanley, who was intoxicated, with

NO PARTIALITY SHOWN.
IN listing the unpatriotic corporations which are
squirming from under the responsibility of paying
a war tax, the idea is not to cause them pain, but to
arouse within them a sense of duty. Until now the
Postal Telegraph Company had not been mentioned.
It is hereby appended. It belongs in the class with
Wells- Fargo, the Western Union and the Southern
Pacific. The Telephone Company was in the same
class, but dropped out with a pean of glorifying praise
for itself when it found it could no longer stay.
Even if there may be some technicality by which
telegraph concerns can make customers pay the cor
poration tax, instead of themselves obeying the law,
it would be a mighty mean corporation which would
take advantage of it. The intent of Congress was
plain. It did not .strive to provide a way in which
one big company could evade its share of the burden
of war while another company would be held respon
sible to the limit of the schedule. Most clearly of all
it did not intend that the Postal or the Western
Union should wholly escape, and the taxes they ought
to pay be paid by the private citizen, who uncomplain
ingly is paying taxes of his own. Corporations have
seemed at times to be favored, but there is not the
slightest indication that the present is one of these
times.
The injustice of the Postal contention, the same as
that of the Western Union, is particularly apparent
when the fact is considered that their profits, already
large, have been vastly increased by the war, while
business in many other directions has been injured.
Yet people of every class are cheerfully accepting the
common load. The Postal does not accept. The
managers of it and of other institutions like it ought
to be ashamed, and quick measures should be taken
to force them to pay their dues.
THE INDEMNITY QUESTION.
HOWEVER long the war with Spain may con
tinue it is likely the greater part of the fighting
is over. The destruction of two Spanish fleets
without any loss to our own, and the capture of the
strongly fortified city of Santiago with a numerous
army after a comparatively short campaign, should
be sufficient to convince even the most obstinate of
Spaniards that it will be folly to risk any further con
flicts either by land or sea.
Watson's fleet will soon set out in search of the last
fleet of Spain, and an army corps is now ready
for immediate descent upon Porto Rico. Watson
will find Camara hidden away in a fortified harbor,
and the troops that invade Porto Rico will find what
ever Spanish forces are in that island ready to retire
or to capitulate without much fighting. What is left
of the war will be simply the prolongation of it by
every means which the Spaniards can devise to escape
our guns and avoid a battle.
Under these circumstances the main subject of in
terest in the war is the problem of determining the
conditions to be imposed upon Spain in making
peace. This raises of course the question of the
amount of indemnity that will be demanded of her
and the steps we shall have to take to secure its pay
ment. We are dealing with what is not merely a bank
rupt nation but a poverty-stricken people, and that
fact will have to be taken into consideration in fixing
the amount we shall require her to pay for compelling
us to enter upon the war.
If we should follow the precedents set by other vic
torious nations in recent wars the indemnity we would
demand of Spain would be sufficient to crush her for
ever. Germany exacted from France two rich prov
inces, many strong fortresses and $1,000,000,000. Rus
sia wrung from Turkey extensive territorial conces
sions and $225,000,000, and would have exacted thrice
that sum if Great Britain had not interfered and ar
ranged peace by concert of Europe. Japan took from
China the island of Formosa, required the abandon
ment of her exclusive claims in Korea and exacted
$175,000,000 for indemnity. The Turks would have
imposed an equally heavy burden upon Greece if
Europe had not prevented and limited the exactions
of the victors to a strip of territory and $20,000,000.
If our demands upon the Spanish are made on a
similar scale we shall require of them an indemnity
heavier than they can pay for years, and will hold
their colonies until the amount is paid. That would
of course mean the permanent occupation of them by
our troops on much the same terms that Great Britain
occupies Egypt. Moreover, no European concert
could interfere to prevent the enforcement of our full
demand, as was done when Russia surrendered her
original claims upon Turkey, Turkey upon Greece
and Japan upon China.
Fortunately for Spain the United States are a gener
ous nation, and the American people are not vindic
tive. If she sues for peace now she can get it on com
paratively easy terms. Every week of prolonged war
will, however, add to the amount of the indemnity to
be demanded. If the Spanish Government is wise it
will, therefore, not only avoid battle but end the war
at once.
If the Queen Regent expects this country to respect
her she must quit giving audience to that fellow Wey
ler. Somebody ought to tell her he is a bad man.
THE COOLIES IN HAWAII.
DR. PARDEE'S newspaper in Oakland says:
"The Call is revenging itself for defeat in the
annexation of Hawaii. ... It demands
that all contract labor previously imported into the
islands shall be expelled. Of course this is impracti
cable, and all that can be reasonably be asked is that
from this time on the contract labor laws shall apply
to Hawaii. . . . Even the suggestion that the
Chinese in Hawaii shall be prevented from migrating
to other parts of the country is of doubtful practica
bility." The doctor might as well say that the consti
tution of the United States is trying to revenge itself
for the defeat in the annexation of Hawaii, for it was
defeated, and not The Call.
As the constitution has been overridden and we
have taken Hawaii against the consent of 98 per cent
of its people, California has every reason to fear what
may follow in the form of government which is to be
dictated by the island planters and the Dole oligarchy.
This fear originates in the presence on the islands of
50,000 Asiatic coolies. Their number has been largely
increased during the last few months. We have not
limited our demand for their expulsion from the
islands to contract labor alone, as the doctor mis
takenly states. He admits that if they are left in Hawaii
their exclusion from the rest of the country is of
doubtful practicability. Such exclusion was a feature
of the annexation treaty and of the unconstitutional
resolution under which we have taken the islands.
The Call said months ago that it was a sham and that
the annexationists never intended to enforce it, and
now the doctor admits this to be true, but accuses us
of making demands in behalf of California that cannot
be granted.
Why can they not be? The doctor's newspaper
seems to be talking for the employers of Asiatic
coolies here and in the islands rather than for white
labor and white wages in California. We demand the
deportation of all Asiatic coolies now in Hawaii,
whether under contract or free. Unless this is done
Hawaii becomes an open door for the admission of
coolies to this State. Send them home and that closes
the door. Does Dr. Pardee want it kept open? He
admits that they can probably come, notwithstanding
their pretended exclusion in the annexation resolu
tion. He admits the hypocrisy and show of the whole
proceeding, and decries our effort to secure protection
for California by impressing our needs upon the com
mission in which Hawaii has two votes and we have
none, owing to the culpable neglect of the Western
Senators whose votes made annexation possible.
In this city white women, the widows and the
mothers of soldiers, are crying out against the compe
tition of a hundred coolies in the manufacture of uni
forms for the War Department. Those women need
that work and their children want the bread it will
earn. This is the cry and the need of our own flesh
and blood against the alien coolie. But what is the
competition of a hundred coolies compared to that of
50.000! It is contemptible for Dr. Pardee to prattle
about our demands being dictated by revenge and im
possible to be granted while white children need
bread that is snatched from them by coolies.
We repeat that California demands of this Illinois,
Alabama and Hawaiian Commission:
The deportation of all coolies now in the Islands;
the absolute prohibition of further coolie or blackbird
immigration thereto; and the extension of the eight
hour day and existing labor laws to the islands.
There is nothing impracticable in these demands.
They simply put the employers in the islands on an
equal footing with the employers in California. We
are paying their debts, and propose to pay the cost
of their government. Why should we add to these
advantages a superiority of right to the employers of
labor? The stars and stripes should mean, every
where, political equality. But Dr. Pardee seems to
think that in Hawaii the flag is to mean inequality,
with California as the under dog.
"YELLOW DOG" YEARS.
THE impression which is gaining ground in Re
publican circles that James G. Maguire is going
to be an easy man to defeat ior Governor of this
State should be abandoned early in the campaign. No
candidate who appeals to the passions, prejudices and
whims of the masses is an easy man to defeat for any
office. It is always unsafe to calculate that dema
gogues if given sufficient rope will hang themselves.
True, many people readily see through the thin veil
which hides from the public the false pretenses of the
men who often ride into power by promising to
remedy government abuses, but the great mass are un
able to penetrate it and are prone to believe and trust
their words.
Judge Maguire is no novice at demagogy. He
thoroughly understands the art of making pretense
stand for deed. He is a professional office-seeker, a
master of campaign methods and an orator of no
mean ability. He can stand a large amount of hard
work with his jaw, and will probably be able to tender
any candidate the Republicans may name a difficult
oratorical battle. Those who think it will be easy to
defeat him should pause a moment and take a brief
survey of history.
Four years ago James H. Budd was an easy man to
defeat, yet he carried San Francisco by 10,000 majority
and ran Estee behind his ticket in nearly every county
of the State. The year 1894 was a "yellow dog" year.
The present year is gradually getting to be looked
upon as a similar year. The war, it is said, has created
a strong Republican sentiment, and improved busi
ness conditions have resolved much public discontent
which has heretofore manifested itself in Populism
and silverism. This may all be true. The same things
were said four years ago. Then the Republicans were
"sure" of the Governorship, and yet when the votes
were counted they found a Democrat had the office.
Maguire's attitude toward Populism, his single-tax
theories and the other sources of his political weak
ness should be put aside. He is not an easy man to
defeat, and if the Republicans make their campaign
on any such assumption they may again lose the
State.
What should he done this year, so far as the Gover
nor is concerned, is to proceed on the theory that the
strongest, brainiest, most popular and most inde
pendent man in the party must be nominated. Politi
cal hacks, boss candidates, programmers, factionists
and the political rap-tags who always seek the Gov
ernorship in "yellow dog" years should be consigned
to purgatory at the outset. The Australian ballot en
courages independent voting, and the people care lit
tle for party labels. They will not vote for "yellow
dogs," even though they are Republican dogs and
bear the Republican label. The great necessity of the
moment is a man free from political entanglements,
factions, the bosses, the railroad and all other malign
influences. If such a man is nominated for Governor
he will give character to the entire campaign and be
elected by an overwhelming majority. If a pro
gramme candidate is selected, or a representative of
factions, or a tool of the railroad, or, what is equally
bad. a favorite of the bosses, it will be useless to go
to the expense of holding an election. Judge Maguire
will defeat him.
Instead of propagating the notion, therefore, that
the demagogic Congressman is an easy man to beat,
the Republicans should look the issue square in the
face. He is a dangerous candidate and is going to be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 19, 1898.
hard to beat. There are no more "yellow dog"
years. The Australian ballot system has abolished
that species of political cur as well as his "years."
TROUBLES OF THE PIEBALDS.
THE Populist State Convention and the proceed
ings of the State Committee of the Inoppor
tunists offer material for anything from the
tragedy to the farce of ambition. Judge Maguire
seems to retain the distrust of the Democratic party
which he expressed on bidding it a final farewell in
1887. He regards it as an organization which pursues
the swill harrel and is to be influenced only by what
is poured in the trough. Acting upon this measure
ment of the party with which he affiliates for revenue
only, he intrigued with the Populists for the nomina
tion, believing that with such a start he had only to
get within hearing of the Democratic convention with
the swill pail in his hand and cry "Po-ig, po-ig," and
the whole party would run to him. Chairman Alvord,
of the inopportunist committee, seems to have been
the steerer of this plan for the Judge. Mr. Alvord is
convinced that getting an office and political reform
are convertible terms. In a signed interview in the
Examiner he said: "It is perfectly evident that what
ever the language of the respective platforms may be,
and whatever planks either may contain, there can be
no clash between them. The question of platform pre
sents no obstacle to a union of the reform forces." If
that is not the squeal of a political pig late in the fall,
when the oak mast is all eaten and the rooting is hard,
what is it?
Over against It is this declaration by Triumvir
Gould, of the Inopportunist committee, at its session
during the Populist convention:
"I am a Democrat, but if the Democratic party
enunciates principles to which I cannot subscribe I
am no longer a Democrat." So it seems that the
question of platform does "present obstacles to a union
of the reform forces." What Mr. Gould intended to
say is: "I am a Democrat, and if the party enunciates
un-Democratic principles I will show my Democracy
by opposing it."
But in either form the declaration will be taken by
Chairman Alvord to mean that Mr. Gould's oak mast
is not exhausted, for he cannot understand why any
one should let a matter of principle stand in the way
of getting an office. He is ably seconded by a mem
ber of the Populist convention, who informed that
body that platforms don't amount to anything.
We believe that Webster Flannagan of Flannagans
Mills, Texas, is dead. In the flesh that political pec
cary of the Staked Plains once asked a Republican
National Convention, "What are we here for except
office?" If his disembodied shade notes mundane
things, one can fancy him tuning his harp to play
"There Are Others," when he heard from the Califor
nia statesmen.
There comes now a period of anxiety while waiting
for Judge Maguire to accept the Populist platform
and nomination. It is true that Jefferson would re
gard the platform as a patch of political weeds and
would sow it with salt. It was the gamut of fads, from
Government ownership and operation of "public utili
ties." whatever that means, to the issue of "a more
and fittener currency" made full legal tender with no
provision for its redemption. It contains every gov
ernmental theory to which Jefferson was opposed, but
that will not deter a Jeffersonian Democrat like
Mapruire from swallowing it, provided an office goes
with it.
THE GALLANT SEVENTH-
THERE is nothing surprising in the fact that the
soldiers of the Seventh California are growing
impatient They have long been kept on the
wind-swept sands of Camp Merritt. They had been
quick to respond to the call to arms. Every day that
passes makes their quarters less congenial, while the
unhealthfulness of the camp is acknowledged. Yet
the men of the Seventh must not forget they are sol
diers, sworn to obey orders to go where duty makes
necessary, or stay if such be the sacrifice required of
them. The people of this city would be glad to have
the ambitions of the boys gratified. They would be
proud to have this regiment sent to the Philippines or
to the West Indies, knowing that wherever the for
tune of war may lead they will be an honor to the
State. They are ready and anxious to fight for their
country. While they await the summons they have a
chance to show the stuff of which they are made. The
call will come in time. The war is not over.
Let the Seventh be counseled to patience. There are
other regiments as eager, and yet they too are held
here. lowa, Kansas and Tennessee all have full regi
ments at this point, and these thousands of men ar
rived supposing they would be rushed to the front.
They, too, are fretting under the delay, but to bear it
without grumbling, to rely on the wisdom of the
commander, is the test of military fitness. It might
be wished that at least one California regiment would
be called East. From Pennsylvania and New York
volunteer soldiers have been dispatched to California
and beyond. We have greeted these as friends and
made them welcome. It would be pleasing if we were
to send our own to the Atlantic coast. Such a course
would strengthen the fraternal bond, already strong,
between sections. If there is no demand for the
Seventh at the Philippines now men are needed else
where.
It does not seem within the bounds of probability
that the Seventh Is to be denied an opportunity to test
its mettle in the face of the enemy. Wherever It may
go good wishes will follow it; a feeling of pride and
confidence.
NEGLECTING THE CREMATORY.
PERHAPS the hardest swearing done in this city
is that designed to lend to Examiner circula
tion figures the dignity of appearing to be be
lieved by the publishers themselves. For the sake of
arguing and at the same time avoiding unseemly con
troversy, no harm will be done by regarding the oath
author temporarily as reliable.
According to the swears of this distinguished gentle
man the paid circulation for June was less than that
of May by 4350 copies daily, and also less than that of
January. Yet the country is in the midst of war, and
there is profound interest in news from the scenes of
battle. If January circulation was as stated, there
being at that time no apparent prospect of war, why
should June circulation be less? Why should there
have been so large a falling off between May and
June?
Perhaps in their quest for news people prefer to
have the sort they can believe. It may be they have
had too much of the style of journalism which is
mostly lying and a brass band. Or possibly the maker
of oaths occasionally swears in a chunk of circulation
which has been burned with other offal. This is really
"paid" circulation, since the yellow journalists put up
20 cents a yard for having it reduced to ashes, the
price including cartage, and being regarded as reason
able. With a well-equipped crematory available there
is no excuse discernible for the Examiner's waning
figures.
Poor old Spain's course is not without a precedent.

THE COGSWELL FOUNTAIN.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In your issue of June 23 is an
editorial stating that permission was given by the Supervisors to a com
mittee of merchants to remove the "dilapidated Cogswell fountain at the
junction of California and Market streets," and in a later issue that "un
doubtedly the time has arrived when it is proper to dismantle" the above
fountain.
Now, Mr. Editor, will you explain why the time has arrived that a
drinking fountain donated in good faith, accepted and agreed to be taken
care of by the city, should be removed, when presumably the only objec
tionable feature of this fountain was by an act of vandalism destroyed
several years ago by some young men whose artistic feelings were so
worked upon by the iron image of an old man that they at midnight, in
great fear, attached a rope and pulled it down? It would have been well
for the Vendome column in Paris, in the days of the Commune, had its
assailants been of the kind who only in darkness dared do a deed claimed
for their country's good.
And what reason in excuse could the Chief of Police of this city at that
time offer for not arresting, when well known, the destroyers of city prop
erty? During its existence thousands of men and animals have availed
themselves of the offered water, which act so displeased the merchants of
that vicinity they must have it removed. It Is a sad commentary on
charity and temperance when in a great city, where destitution and want
continually appears to us, that any one, unless specially injured in pocket,
could advocate the removal of a public drinking fountain.
Dr. Cogswell's idea in presenting this and other fountains was to encour
age temperance, benefit the poor and improve the city by providing a
plentiful supply of cold water.
Three weeks ago in Tompkins square. New York, and on Pennsylvania
avenue in Washington, D. C, I saw fountains presented by Dr. Cogswell
surrounded by hundreds of people waiting their turn for a drink of water,
and the merchants of those localities have not petitioned for their removal.
These two are fac-similes of the one presented to and accepted by this
city over twelve years ago, and allowed by city officials to be defaced, lost
and partially stolen while in the shadow of the City Hall. Even an official
notice that Dr. Cogswell's gifts were not desired or were to be removed
has been withheld, and his only information comes through the press.
Dr. Cogswell has made great benefactions to this State and city, and
Intended to do much more, but such treatment as he has received in many
instances from the press, the public and officials of this city is not calcu
lated to encourage philanthropy and good will to a community which so
little appreciates the distribution of wealth for charitable purposes.

EXTRAVAGANCE OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
To the Editor of The Call: Fine furniture Is always acceptable and
makes an official office very pleasant, but when it becomes a question of
paying for it, whether it belongs to the board de facto to meet the obliga
tion or whether the ctiy should pay the bill, then the taxpayer becomes
interested to know by what authority the bill was contracted, and the
Auditor at the present time has very properly called for an investigation
to learn why hand-polished furniture or any other kind is needed, and
why it is purchased without the order of the Board of Supervisors.
It may not have occurred to a majority of the people of San Francisco
that we only have a quasi city Board of Healthâ that it is, in fact, a State
Board of Health â appointed by the Governor with functions co-ordinate
with the highest and most important department of the municipal govern
ment, leaving the city simply as an imperiurn in imperio. It has full
charge of all ihe public charities of the city, and not even the Mayor or
Supervisor can appoint a gatekeeper or any other attache of the City or
County Hospital or the Almshouse without supplicating the Board of
Health or seeking the consent of the Governor. This is all wrong, and all
other cities are allowed to control their own affairs. Should the new
charter become the organic law of the city, this mistake will be corrected.
In making this brief criticism Ido not reflect upon the integrity of the
honorable Board of Health, for they are numbered among the most promi
nent members of the medical profession and esteemed citizens, but by
virtue of their office they are expected to be governed by the request of
those who secured their appointment, and the city cannot remove any of
their appointees for misdemeanor or any cause, and strangers and non-resi
dents may secure appointments which the humble citizen cannot obtain.
This condition is strictly political on the plea that to the "victor belongs
the spoils," and is gracefully conceded by the politician, while the humble
citizen looks on and wonders why it is so; and only when the board enters
into any scheme of extravagance do those in authority, to whom is in
trusted millions of the city's money, call for a halt and ask that an investi
gation be made; and did they not perform this duty they would be charged
with negligence, If not connivance to wrong the city.
No department of the city has a legal right to expend more than $500
without advertising for bids to supply whatever is required, and while the
city furnishes the money it should have the right to say to whom as well
as for what the money Is to be paid. DR. WASHINGTON AVER.
JUDAISM AND THE WAR.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Tom Meyers' "Revenge" article in your edition of July
3 may represent the views of Tom Meyers, but not of Judaism at large. Judaism
of to-day does not kick any man when he is down. We seek no revenge against
Spain because she mistreated our ancestors 400 years ago. We forgive and forget
and do not believe that two wrongs make one right. If the fathers of the present
Spanish generation have maltreated our ancestors, things cannot be amended by
hurling defiance and revenge at the present generation. I admire any Jew who
fights for America. I despise him who under the cloak of American citizenship
joins the ranks to get revenge for what Spain did 400 years ago. He is no
better than the worthless Cuban who would fall on the defenseless sailors of the
Cervera fleet. The Rothschilds do not base their loans on sentiment, but on busi
ness principles. The United States can get money, because the securlt is good.
Spain has trouble getting monejfc because she is in bad financial shape. To say,
in fact, that the Rothschilds have any other motive in rejecting loans is the rank
est nonsense and a libel on Judaism. Some people will never learn. Two thou
sand years ago our ancestors made a blunder in hanging a man for his convic
tions. This blunder has cost Judaism untold lives and miseries, until more en
lightened days dawned, and the conclusion was arrived at that it is a gross in
justice to blame the Jews of to-day for misdeeds of their forefathers 2000 years ago.
Do unto others what you would have others do unto you! If the persecution
against Jews shall cease for former delinquencies let the Jews cease to persecute
their less fortunate fellowman for misdeeds done by his ancestors 400 years ago.
The true Jew no longer believes in a god of revenge. The God of love has in
fused new hope and new spirit into our mission, since we have realized that it i 3
wrong to believe him capable of revenge. If the love of the heavenly Father Is infi
nite we can please him best by following his example in drowning the spirit of re
venge and developing the spirit of love.
Tacoma, July 12. j. JACOB.
WE SUCCEEDED WHERE ENG
LAND FAILED.
In the capture of Santiago de Cuba Amer
ica has succeeded where Great Britain
failed on two occasions. The first attempt
was made in 1742, and failed because of
lack of harmony between -Vice- Admiral
Vernon and General Wentworth, com
manding the joint naval and army forces.
The expedition sailed from Jamaica July
1, 1742, and consisted of eight ships of the
line, thirteen frigates and about forty
transports with 3400 land forces. The fleet
anchored In Waltenham harbor, sixty
miles by land from Santiago de Cuba, and
Vice-Admiral Vernon was so sure of suc
cess that he changed the name of Walten
ham into that of Cumberland, in compli
ment to his royal highness, the Duke. The
Spanish fleet was at Havana, and there
was no Spanish army at Santiago ' de
Cuba.
Tho troops were disembarked, and began
their march against the object of attack
only four days distant, and a detachment I
of 150 Americans and negroes got as far as i
the village of Elleguava, but failing to get 1
support from the main body returned to ,
Ciinip. In the meantime Vernon block- I
aded Santiago awaiting with impatience j
news from the army. General Wentworth
frittered his unit" awa; until Oetuot-t 6,
when he notified the admiral of his doubt
about being able to do anything further,
and after waiting more time in the bush
and mountains the army re-embarked No
vember 20, and returned to Jamaica with
out having accomplished anything ex
cept losing a lot of men from fever. The
ships were thus forced to haul off from
Santiago, and tha Cubans were left to i
ponder over the incomprehensible conduct
of the British troops, and finally came to
the conclusion that the landing had been'!
made without hostile intent.
The second fiasco was six years later,
when Rear Admiral Knowles with ten
ships, carrying 44X guns and :;r>so men, pro
ceeded on April 5 to attack Santiago. As
the squadron approached the narrow inlet
to the harbor, Captain Dent, who as sen
ior officer, led in the Plymouth â observed
that the Spaniards had been so discour
teous as to lay a boom across the en
trance, Vith four vessels moored within j
it, two of which appeared to be fire ships.
The cautious captain correctly conjectured
that these obstructions were placed to
dissuade any attempt on the part of th<-
British to force an entrance, and calling
a council of his officers they agTced with
him that the ships would be exposed to
great danger.
The gallant Captain Dent and the other i
ships hauled off and returned to Rear Ad- '
miral Knowles explaining why they had
retired. The chief commander was furl- <
ous, and wrote a complaint to the Admir- |
alty against Captain Dent, and on the
latter*s return to England he was court- |
martlaled, but honorably acquitted. Rear j
Admiral Knowles later on found the
Spanish fleet between Tortuga and Hay- '
ana, and gave battle resulting in the
Dons losing several ships and the re
mainder being forced to flee. KnowleÃ
failed to follow up his advantage, and he i
was subsequently court-martialed and i
censured, but in the meantime the fleet !
was generally demoralized, charges and
counter charges were made by the several
captains, and there were more troubles
than prize money to the officers and '
crews, and Great Britain failed to cover
herself with even self-respect, so far as
the navy was concerned in the West
Indies.
A HEAVY HANDICAP.
It Is but a Spanish custom.
It was not the youngster's fault
That he never had the training
"Which would help him earn his salt.
And he couldn't raise a protest
When to christen him they came
And they solemnly afflicted
The poor infant with the name
"Alfonso XIII, Leon Ferdinand Maria
James Isidore Pascal Antonio."
And it's not at all surprising
That in business of state
And in military matters
All his people come too late.
For it's likely to occasion
An embarrassing delay
When they rally up their cohorts
And they stop to shout "Hooray
For Alfonso XIII, Leon Ferdinand Maria
James Isidore Pascal Antonio."

ROOT KNOT-S D. A., Templeton. Cal.
The question, "What is the cause of root
knot on prune trees, and what is the best
treatment for the same?" was submitted
to B. M. Lelong, secretary and chief hor
ticultural officer of the State Roanl of
Horticulture, and the following is his re
ply: Relative to root knot or. prune trees,
will say that it is a mysterious fungous
disease and so far it has baffled all science
in its determination and cause. There are
many theories regarding its development.
v,. 6 ? yet no one nas been ahle t0 e9e "
tabllsh by fact the cause of its growth
upon peach and almond roots. That it
appears on plum and prune trees is due
to the fact that these trees aro worked
upon peach roots. It does not attack plum I
roots. Many experiments have been made
to check its developments, but the only
one that has given partial results Is the
removal of the knots early in the fall by
cutting them with a "hisel and then
nainting over the affected part with a
strong solution of bluestone. This is re
peated again and again before the trees
put forth in the spring. During summer
they should be carefully examined; if any
knots appear they should be removed and
the trees treated with the bluestone solu
tion.

Passenger Agent James Horsburgh, also
superintendent of the Calvary Church
Sunday-school, Is rusticating at his
ranch, the Santa Tsabel, and with him
Is J. C. Stubbs, third vice president of the
Southern Pacific and general superintend
ent over the passenger and freight de
partments. Mr. Horsburgh is a religious
man, full of piety and reverence. The
Saobath to him is a day for strict ob
servance of religious duties. On this day
Mr. Horsburgh leaves the busy cares of
the world and surrenders himself to pious
meditation. One of the most delightful
spots of the Santa Ysabel rancho is a
beautiful lake, just large enough for a
pull in a boat. But there is one blister-
Ing abomination to the complete beauty
of this glistening sheet of water, and that
Is a series of sign posts round it, that
read: "No rowing on this lake on Sun
days." Now, one of Mr. Stubbs' idiosyn
crasies is the love of rowing. When the
opportunity offers itself Mr. Stubbs, who
Is also a good Christian, would not forego
a turn on the water for the best sermon
on earth. Not being ' particularly inter
ested in sign posts he did not acquaint
himself with the prohibitive warnings on
them, and was soon at his favorite sport
the first Sunday of his visit to Ysabel
rancho. Mr. Horsburgh happened to
stroll in the direction of the lake, and to
his horror saw his superior officer in the
act of a great sacrilege. Here was a nice
question to grapple withâ religious duty
or temporal welfare. The matter was de
bated in ' his mind, and the final resolu
tion was for the cause of principle. Wild
shouts issued from Mr. Horsburgh that
soon brought his superior officer to the
shore. "I am very sorry to disturb your
row, Mr. Stubbs," said the host, "but
these sign posts must stand as inviolable
lawâ no rowing on Sundays." >;â¢
Mr. Stubbs scratched his head. He
wanted his row, and this is what gave
it to him and freed him from further mo
lestation: "Mr. Horsburgh, you are in
the passenger department, I believe, and
I think you know that it is not the policy
of the company to allow an inferior officer
to dictate to a superior in a matter of
such importance."
The lake was a perfect gem to Mr.
Stubbs that Sunday morning and he com
muned with nature to the full.

BAGS OF GOLD
FOR THE MINT
Big Assays Made for the
Klondikers.
OVER A MILLION IN THE POTS
FRANK DINSMORE, ONE OF THE
FORTUNATES, VERY ILL.
After Braving the Dangers of the
Arctic He Contracts Bronchitis,
and Is in a Critical
Condition.
There was an active lot of Klondikers
on the streets of this city yesterday. The
greater part of the day was consumed in
packing the gold dust and nuggets to the
Mint and smelting works. The curiosity
of the people who watched these griz
zled and hardy pioneers of the north la
boring under heavy sacks, not of cloth
ing, but of yellow, shining metal, knew
no bounds. The Klondikers seem an in
different lot to the wealth that one an
other possesses. They know when a
strike has been made and that seems to
be the extent of their interest in the af
fairs of the outsider.
From the Commercial Hotel to the Sel
by Smelting Works the great portion of
the gold brought into this city on Sun
day traveled. Over $700,000 in dust and
nuggets went over the counters of the
Selby Smelting Works yesterday. This
aggregate amount in great part repre
sents the clean-ups of the returning min
ers. Some part of it comes from the
consignments of gold to the Alaska Com
mercial Company. The Mint received
about $300,000 from the gold-hunters. It
took seventeen individual deposits to
make up the $300,000. But a pile of lug
gage still remains in the office of the
Commercial Hotel and this will soon find
its way either into the smelting estab
lishments or the Mint. Some gold was
deposited in the various safe deposits of
the city. , .
The returned miners speak with a great
deal of acrimony of the actions of the
North American Trading and Transpor
tation Company.
Joseph Labreck said yesterday: The
N A T., Healey's line, is robbing the
neoDle right and left. We came down
on the Bella, a ship belonging to the
Alaska Commercial Company, and re
ceived the best treatment, but the others
who did not were robbed. They charged
$300 for the trip and then when they get
you to St. Michael they add on another
hundred. More than that they do not
give you anything to eat. In St. Michael
there was a riot and the hotel belonging
to the Healey company was stormed-

AN ATTOBNEY ARRESTED.
Burnette Q. Haskell Charged by a
Car Conductor With Disturb
ing the Peace.
Attorney Burnette G. Haskell was ar
rested yesterday on a warrant charging
him with disturbing the peace. He was
released on his own recognizance b>
Judge Mogan.
The complaining witness Is F. E. Hill,
conductor on a Haight-street car. He al
leges that on July 8 the attorney, accom
panied by a lady, boarded his car, which
was very crowded at the time. Haskeh
demanded a seat for the. lady and after
some trouble Hill got one inside for het.
This did not satisfy Haskell, and he in
sisted upon Hill getting a seat for her on
the dummy. Then he began to abuse thÂ«
company and use unparliamentary lan-,
guage to the annoyance of lady passen-
Hill reported the matter to the superin
tendent and next day swore to the war
rant for the arrest of "John Doe," as he
did not know Haskell's name. The at
torney was seen to enter Judge Mogan's
courtroom yesterday morning, and Po
liceman Graham, who had the warrant,
followed him and placed him under ar
rest Haskell protested, claiming he was
an officer of the court and could not bu
arrested at the bar, but the Judge pacified
him by releasing him on his own recognu
zance. He declared he would get even
with the conductor.
Suit to Settle a Trust.
Suit was commenced yesterday by Wil
liam H. Crocker and the executor of the
estate of Charles F. Crocker, deceased,
to secure a settlement of the account of
the trustees of the trust created by

daughter, Harriet V. Alexander, and her
children. William H. Crocker and the

tees under the trust created by their
father, and the settlement is sought ow
ing to the death of one of the trustees.
The trust originally consisted of bonds
of the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North
Michigan Railroad, valued at $100,000. and
bonds of the Ann Arbor and Mount
Pleasant Railroad, valued at $150,000. It
appears, however, from the papers filed
yesterday that since the creation of the
trust the property has increased in value
to the amount of $1Â£,578 31.
WORK FOR WOMEN.
The Home Sewing Company Will Be
Organized To-Morrow Evening.
The first steps toward organizing the
Woman's Home Sewing Company will be
taken to-morrow evening in Pythian Cas
tle, 909 Market street. The object of this
association is to furnish deserving women
with sewing at rates of wages at which
they can make a living. It was started
by those who think that they should have
some of the Government work of making
garments for the soldiers, work which the
contractors are now giving to the Chi
nese. Quite a number of wives and wid
ows of the old and young soldiers made
known their wishes to W. W. Allen Sr., a
veteran of the Grand Army of the Re
public, who aj; once started this plan so
as to give these women the work to which
they are entitled.
The meeting to-morrow evening will be
to perfect the organization. It will be ad
dressed by Mr. Allen and a number of
the ladies who are expected to look after
the welfare of the company after it is
incorporated. Mr. Allen is attend
ing to the legal end of the matter,
but the meeting was called by Mrs.
L. E. Squires. As soon as the company is
on a solid footing its directors will bid
for contracts for Government work,
which will be given out to the women at
prices far above what they are now get
ting. Those who desire will have the op
portunity of doing the work in a factory.
EXPECTORATION
A NEW WRINKLE
THE THIEF IS CAUGHT AND
WATCHES RECOVERED.
Novel Ruse of William Gridley to
Make a Profitable Haul in a
Third-Street Jewelry
Store.
It took TVllham Gridley, aged 59, just
three days to make up his mind to walk
out of Glindemann & Schweitzer's jewelry
store, 5 Third street, with two gold
watches nestling tenderly in the paims of
his hands, and now he is renentant and
aweary of this world, for his name is
written on the big book of the police sta
tion and he is charged with grand lar
ceny. Gridley pleads the desire for bread
the reason for his criminality.
Gridley, with the air and manner of
some prosperous farmer, walked leisurely
into the jewelry establishment on Third
street Saturday morning and asked to
be shown some watches. He was very
critical and fastidious in his selection and
finally narrowed down his choice to one
of two handsome chronometers. His de
liberate consideration was punctured by
apologies for expectorations of tobacco
juice. He would leave the counter every
few minutes, go to the entrance and then
color the contiguous sidewalk a deep ripe
brown. This over the watches would
again absorb his attention. The same
thing happened Saturday afternoon and
yet no selection was made. It was a
difficult matter for Mr. Gridley to satisfy
his mind as to the watch which his fancy
preferred.
The expectorations went on with unde
viating regularity during this second visit
ac before. On Monday morning there was
a second repetition of both the close ex
amination of the watches and the inter
mittent expectorations.
The climax came last evening. Schweit
zer was patiently waiting on Gridley when
the latter, weighing the pair of those
much-looked-at watches, one in each
hand, suddenly remembered that the time
for an expectoration iiad arrived. He for
got that he had the watches in his hands
and started to run out of the store. C. M.
Daiss, a clerk, rushed out after the thief
and caught, him on Third street. Gridley
was turned over to Detective Tom Ryan,
who took him to the Central Police
Station. Going up on the patrol wagon a
criminal named Bryant called Gridley by
the name of Tom and told him not to
give his name to the police, and that he
would bring him some tobacco. The police
th'nk Gridley is an old one at the bust-
ness.
One watch was recovered on Third
street by Special Officer Con Kelly. The
other was found on the thief's person.
Two suspicious looking characters were
in the store when uridley made his crit
ical examination of the timepieces.
RICHARD T. SPRAGUE.
His Funeral Was Attended by a
Large Number of Sorrowing
Friends.
The funeral of Richard T. Sprague took
place yesterday at 2 o'clock from the
Sprague residence, 2014 Webster street
The funeral was an exceptionally large
one attended by many of his personal
friends of whom the deceased had a large
number. The pall-bearers were J. B.
Stetson, B. Sprague, R. O. Oxnard and
Captain Babbit. The deceased was at one
time a prominent merchant of this city,
but for the last eight years has not en
gaged In active business pursuits.
Got Their June Salaries.
The school teachers astonished them
selves yesterday by drawing their Juno
salary. Heretofore the June salaries were
generally hung up until the following Oc
tober, but this year, much to their aston
ishment, they were notified to step up ttÂ»
the captain's office and draw down then
mite. It is needless to add they did.
DANCING MEN
ARE AGITATED
They Are Compelled to
Pay License.
MR. O'BRIEN'S PULL IS GONE
HIS SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES HAVE
NO INFLUENCE NOW.
Professors of the Divine Art Accuse
Collector Bonnet of Discrimi
nating in Favor of
Girls.
The dancing teachers are cutting pigeon
wings on a hot griddle.
Before License Collector Bonnet took
his office they were not required to pay
any license for the privilege and the
pleasure of teaching the divine art. Mr.
Bonnet's demand that they part with
some of the gold earned by the exercise of
their beloved art has Imbued the frater
nity with melancholy. Worse than the tax
itself, they say that the Collector has fa
vored the women teachers by exempting
them.
The indignation of the male members of
the professton culminated yesterday with
the filing of a communication with the
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. It was
from the Dancing Teachers' Association
of San Francisco, signed by L. H. Hin
man, William J. O'Brien and T. H. Irvine.
The communication set forth that the col
lection of a license tax from teachers of
dancing was unconstitutional, and pro
ceeded to extol the "Boston Dip," "The
Racket," "The Kangaroo" and the "Hula-
Hula."
"The capacity to dance gracefully," said
the Terpsichorean Triplets, "is one of the
elements which go to make up a complete
education; it is, in fact, of more impor
tance at the present time than many of
the other fine arts, which are exempt en
tirely from the license tax. San Francis
co is the only city in the United States
where teachers of dancing are compelled
to pay a license. Furthermore, there ex
ists in the methods used in the collection
of the present license tax a decided dis
crimination between males and females.
Male teachers of dancing are obliged to
pay this tax, while females who are en
gaged in the same business are not obliged
to pay it. If the tax is legal and consti
tutional the Collector has no right to
make any discrimination in collecting it."
License Collector Bonnet flushed like a
girl after a French dinner when he read
the communication. He was indignant
that he should be accused, even by im
plication, of making discriminations in
discharging the duties of his office, and he
made public the history of his connection
with the matter.
"This man O'Brien," he said, "had not
paid any license for years, and as soon
as I took charge of my office I made him
pay. He has a big dancing class, and
when he was notified that he would have
to pay his license Hinman said that I
could not collect from O'Brien. 'The
Sheriff's office will fix O'Brien's license.'
he added. I told Hinman that it wouldn't
go, for I was going to collect it. Sure
enough, two deputies from the Sheriff's
office came to me to fix it, but they
could do nothing with me, and I obliged
O'Brien to pay."
Hinman asked Bonnet whether he
would prosecute dancing teachers who
were paying no license, and he said that
he would, and Hinman presented him
with a list of young girls who were giv
ing dancing lessons to help support their
brothers and sisters and parents. Bonnet
found one of the cases to be a girl 17
years old who was obliged to teach danc
ing in order to support her family. He re
fused to arrest these poor women, but
notified them that they would have to
pay the license.
Mr. Bonnet expressed the opinion that
the tax on teachers of dancing is uncon
stitutional. School teachers, music teach
ers, the professions and laborers cannot
be taxed, and there was no valid reason
that he could see why an exception
should have been made in the case of
dancing teachers.
FBIENDS OF ANIMALS.
Annual Meeting of the San Francisco
Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty.
The San Francisco Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals held its an
nual meeting yesterday afternoon in Its
office at 2514 Sixteenth street. The follow
ing trustees for the ensuing year were
elected: N. P. Cole, John P. Jackson, H.
E. Holmes, James S. Hutchinson, Luman
Wadham, C. S. Crittenden, Martin Ste
vens, Theodore G. Gruenhagen, Frank A.
Vail, Frederick A. Hyde. Robert C. Bol
ton, Hugh Tevis, W. W. Montague and
Charles A. Clinton, the last four being
new members.
A resolution was adopted to the effect
that "it is the earnest wish of the
members of this society that the
board of trustees, re-elected at this
meeting, shall continue unceasingly
in all honorable efforts to secure the re
storation to the society of the control of
the public pound."

DRAMA AND
VAUDEVILLE
"Liberty Hall" at the
Columbia.
IS A VERY PRETTY COMEDY
THE TIVOLI PRESENTS "THE
BELLS OE CORNEVILLE."
"Captain Impudence" a Success at
Morosco's â The Orpheum Dis
plays a Fine Lo> of Stars.
At the Chutes.
"Liberty Hall," the charming comedy
drama by R. C. Carlton, was given a very
cordial reception at the Columbia last
night, after an absence of four years. It
is a dainty, pleasing mixture of the life of
the nobility and the middle class, taken
from the great English metropolis, and is
exceedingly interesting from beginning to
end. The art of the author in depicting
the methods by which the false pride of
a lovable woman is gradually humbled,
until she sees and appreciates life in its
true light, Is only equaled by the com
mendable manner in which the pretty
story was told on the stage last night.
The play moves quietly and smoothly
from one engaging scene to another, and
while the tearful predominates, there is
sufficient of the cheerful to give a mel
low effect, the enjoyableness of which
was attested by the generous applause
accorded it. The plot is simple and con
fined almost entirely to showing the mis
fortunes and good fortunes of two noble
young women, and the admirable sides
of the struggling poor and the British
aristocrat.
The scenes in the humble home of Tod
man, the unsuccessful shopkeeper, with
their effective illustration of the woes of
the pinching nip of poverty and vain ef
forts to hide them, afforded excellent op
portunities for the Frawley company to
display their capabilities in another line
and they did not fail to grasp them.
The- character of Todman, the poor, dif
fident and lovable old shopkeeper, who
cares for his aristocratic relatives in their
distress, showed us Theodore Roberts in
a new and delightful part. It is unneces
sary to say more than that his concep
tion of the character was true to life
one worthy of high praiseâ and which
greatly advanced him in the favor of the
patrons of the house.
Similar remarks would apply to the ar
tistic work of Madeline Bouton as the
poor but haughty highborn lady. It was
ncr first effort here in subdued character
ization and the best she has thus far been
seen in, earning well-deserved recalls.
Edward Bell improves with acquaint
ance and was particularly acceptable as
the nobleman making love in the guise ot
a commercial traveler. Miss Fanchon
Campbell has an ingenue part well suited
to her talents. Mr. Burke as the coarse
but ambitious shopman, Mr. Wilson as
the solicitor and Louis Payne, the lisping,
callow youth, were quite satisfactory.
Eleanor Carey's ideas of what constitute
a holy terror in the person of a servant
of all work was everything that could be
desired. Mr. Fratvley has a congenial
part as an earnest and, despite his diffi
culties, successful swatn. Mr. Clarencu
Livingston made an auspicious first ap
pearance as the hopelessly lovelorn shop
boy, and should be well satisfied with hlb
reception. In fact, every part was well
done, and with its bright lines, clever
stage settings and rapid changes from
laughter to tears "Liberty Hall" should
give a good account at tha J>ox office at
the close of the week.
Orpheum.
The Orpheum was crowded to Its fullest
capacity again last night, and by their
hearty rounds of applause the audience
emphasized the fact that they thought
well of the new bill. Some disappointment
was manifest in the non-appearance of
Wilton and Stack. After a trip of 7000
1 miles from London and across the Atlan
tic and its perils, and no accident by land
or water, they get into San Francisco and
begin practice. Almost the first turn Mr.
Stack made over the horizontal bar
proved his undoing. He slipped and in
jured his ankle so that he could not ap
pear at the Orpheum last night. He will,
however, be in form by the middle of the
week, and he and his partner, M. Wilton,
will appear next Sunday. Of the three
new turns Valmore is the novelty. After
hearing him one cannot but ask what sort
of a throat has the fellow. Without the
aid of any artifices he imitates all sorts
of musical instruments. His imitation of
the 'cello and a violin are exceptionally
clever. He catches the peculiar intona
tions of the instrument he is imitating'
with a wonderful degree of accuracy. Gil
bert and Goldie got one of the most
hearty welcomes ever accorded an artist
at the Orpheum. They were prime favor
ites from the start. They have an entire
ly new line of work. Mr. Gilbert's imper
sonation of the Hebrew who was intense
ly stupid on all matters except the money
question was a clever piece of character
work, while Mr. Goldie was not one whit
behind him in presentment of the over
smart young man. Lorenze and Allen
are a clever pair of dancers, and while
they do not bring anything that is partic
ularly new to the Orpheum they do their
turn "so neatly that they may be excused
in the matter of originality. Joseph Hart
and Carrie de Mar scored another suc
cess, Mr. Hart making a great hit with
his "Song of Songs." Coote and Kingsley
were as funny as ever. Falke and Se
mons, the musical comedians, were re
tained in the place of Wilton and Stack.
They have some new material. Mrs. Alice
Shaw and daughters, Fleurette and others
completed the bill.
Grand Opera-House.
"Captain Impudence," Edwin Milton
Royle's comedy war drama, was present
ed at the Grand Opera-house last night
to a well-pleased and enthusiastic audi
ence. The scene of action is during the
Mexican War, and the capture of the
Mexican fortifications at Chapultepec
by the American forces brought down the
house. A charming love story runs
throughout the play, intermingled with
Jealousy, hate and revenge. The princi
pal parts were in capable hands and were
admirably sustained. The title role was
assumed by James M. Brophy, and he
played it with dash and spirit. Fred J.
Butler as the bluff, irascible old Major
Bugg did justice to the part and gave
another proof of his high standing in
character work. The fact that Landers
Stevens met with a severe disapproval of
the "gods" was the best evidence that he
played the villainous Mexican major to
perfection. Max yon Mitzel gave a clever
interpretation of the devoted slave, Jim,
who ruled his young master. Maud Edna
Hall as Lucretia Bugg, the daughter of
the regiment, again showed that in in
genue parts she is exceedingly clever and
charming. Lorena Atwood scored a hit
as Jovlta Talamanca. with her love and
hate, and Julia Blanc as the dashing
Widow Trigg was bewitching. The piece
deserves crowded houses for the balance
of the week.
Tivoii.
The pretty little opera, "The Chimes of
Normandy," also called "The Bells of
Corneville," with Its many charming se
lections, has again made Its appearance
at the Tivoli Opera House, after having
been off the boards for a long time. The
scenery is in keeping with the music, and
the cast is as good ns usual. Edwin Ste-
I yens deserves especial praise for the very
able manner in which he enacted the dif-
I ficult part of Gaspard, the miser, in tne
I haunted Castle of Corneville. So much
; were his efforts appreciated that it was
I necessary to raise the curtain three times
j before the audience would be satisfied.
I John J. Raffael as Henri, the Marquis,
j had a fine opportunity to show what he
could do with his voice, and he did jus-
I tice to the music. Phil Branson as Jean
the Fisherman also made a hit. Miss El
via Crox was in fine voice, but unfortun
ately Miss Helen Merrill has not been
well for several days and a sore throat
prevented her from doing her best. It
was in the grand choruses that the com
pany showed to iÂ£s full power, and for
this feature, if for'ho other, the ooera is
well worth attending. "The Beggar Stu
dent" will be presented next week.
Aicaz >r.
The second week of "Faust" at the Al
cazar opened to a crowded house. Lewis
Morrison as Mephisto was at his best
and received a curtain call after each act.
Frank Denithorne, as Faust, made a
good impression, while Mis<3 Roberts left
nothing to be desired in her presentation
of Marguerite. Next Monday Lewis .Mor
rison and the Alcazar stock "company will
present the old favorite, "East Lynne."
Chu es.
One of the strongest acts ever seen In
San Francisco is that of the Tokio troupe
of Japanese jugglers, which opened at the
Chutes Free Theater yesterday. The lit
tle brown men are proverbially clever, but
these surpass anything of the kind seen in
years when it comes to top-spinning,
acrobatic feats, jugglery and oriental
magic. Last night they held a large audi
ence delighted for over half an hour, and
their tricks were applauded to the echo.
The rest of the bill was unusually good,
and the new vocalists, Dora Mervyn and
May Lannnn, were warmly received.
Colby and Way, the "ventriloquist and
the dancing doll"; Joe Hall, the female
impersonator and dancer; and Sam Friea
lander. musical comedian, duplicated
their successes of last week. The moving
pictures at the Chutes are among the best
ever shown in the city, and the constant
change of views is appreciated by the pa
trons. Cannon did not lose any of his
weight or good humor at the French cele
bration, and continues to be gazed on by
admirers of the immense.'
Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall has a b that
attracted a good crowd last night. Gibson
and Allen proved clever comedians and
Miss Flossie Nash, the singing soubrette,
ought to be a favorite. She is in good
voice and her dancing is neat and of good
execution. Neat and pretty she ought to
be a drawing card. Quazina, the Male La
Loie Fuller, Maude Rockwell, the Royce
Sisters and others completed the Dill.
STABBED IN THE BREAST.
Paul Dewsett Dangerously Wounded
by an Unknown Man.
Paul Dewsett, a longshoreman, residing
at 231 Lombard street, was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital last eveni'ig
with a dangerous knife wound in the left
breast. The weapon penetrated the lung
and the man's chances for recovery are
slim.
Dewsett, his brother George and two
friends, named William O'Keefe and
Charles Donovan, had been drinking dur
ing the evening in a saloon near the cor
ner of Montgomery and Lombard streets.
O'Keefe and Dewsett left the saloon and
crossed the street to an Italian standing
on the sidewalk. They asked him for to
bacco and matches, which he gave tht-.-n,
and then jokingly slapping his pocket said
he had no money. O'Keefe took exception
to the remark and a fight followed, in
which the Italian struck Dewsett with a
knife.
The injured man made a statement to
the police last evening in which he said
that he could not identify the man. No
arrests have been made, but the police are
on the lookout for the would-be murderer.
Prepared for a Holdup.
A man was seen skulking In a doorway
at Fifth and Minna streets early yester
day morning by Policeman R. J. Mc-
Grayan. After watching him for a few
minutes McGrayan placed him under ar
rest and sent him to the City Prison.
When searched a loaded revolver was
found in his hip pocket, and a charge of
carrying a concealed weapon was booked
against him. He gave the name of Frank
Jones, but yesterday morning he was recc
ognized as John Broger, a notorious crim
inal. He was taken before Judge Mogan
yesterday and convicted, sentence to be
passed this morning.
Justified in Shooting.
The charge of assault to murder against
John Luft, grocer, Twenty-third and San
chez streets, was dismissed by Judge Mo
gan yesterday. On July 7 William
Thomas created a disturbance in Luffs
place and drew a knife, threatening to
kill Luft. To protect himself Luft fired
a shot at Thomas, wounding him.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Minnie Bowman has applied for a di
vorce from Felix H. Bowman, alleging
failure to provide as a cause of action.
Suits for divorce on the ground of cruelty
were filed by Elfreda C. Jones against
Thomas Jones, Eve S. Hart against
George K. Hart, and Rebeka Eickhorst
against Fred G. Eickhorst.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July IS.â downward move
ment In stuck? to-day was checked before the i
close, and the level of prices brought' back ;
silently above Saturday's close. But it cannot
be said that the market was sustained by any
buying demand, for its lethargy was complete. |
The break In 44 points In Metropolitan street â 
traffic on Its line during a reconstruction period
was the main unsettling lacier in the morning.
C'ulte a heavy decrease In earnings of the New
York Central for June and the shrinkage in the
east-bound rail freight movement due to the
lively competition of the lake lines were also ;
{acton of weakness. New York Central's de
cline was, however, only fractional, and it re
covered iv; in the late dealings. In the buy-
Ing of Brooklyn :â  .pid Transrt. on the continued
Increase in earnings was jÂ«JÂ«o a â  lining fac
tor, and the recent pressure a.c&'.:i*t the coalers '
ceased, these stocks generally showing pains. !
All indications point to a coming redundancy 1
In the money market, but no evidence of an
overflew of funds into stocks was manifest to- |
day. The allotment of the Government bonds
It is felt crrtaJn will result in tH* release of
large sums on account of rejected subscriptions.

sagged rariy. bat later recovered. Total sales,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July IS.â Corn absorbed all the
Interest in the speculative pits to-day. There
was an enormous business done in corn, and
Saturday's advance was well maintained until
near the end of the session. The weather was
another factor of Importance and that was on
the side of the bulls. The corn belt was with
out rains over Sunday, and the Weather Bu
reau forecast gave promise of none for thirty
six hours. The wheat pit cased to be at
tractive to the bulk of the grain speculators, 1
â who crowded the somewhat confined area of ]
the corn pit to a most uncomfortable degree.
A shower of rain on LaSalle street had a ten
dency to create weakness near the close. There
was senerous proflt-taking by the smaller
holders on the bulges and offerings from this
source greatly aided reactions. September
closed 'Â»c lower.
Exc :llent weather for harvesting and
threshing together with good 'crop reports and
lower cables started whÂ«-M easy. The opening
strength In corn, the small receipts of the new
crop of wheat throughout the country and the
heavy decrease in the visible caused general
buying of wheat on soft spots. As a result the
early decline was moro 'han recovered. July
closed %c higher, September %c lower and De

ness of stock speculation down to the exac
tions of the new stamp law. The mining op

OAKLAND, July I s :.â Gong- Ung Chung,
a Chinaman working: at the Melrose Fuse

terrorized tonight and afraid to go to

The trouble arose over a lottery ticket,
for the purchase of which Gong Chung
claims to have given money to Hum Hi
Sing. Ho asserts that the ticket won a
drawing and that Sing refused to give
him the money. Sing, who is a well
known merchant of Alameda, denied that
the ticket won anything.
Sing, who is ."7 years old, was sitting
down leaning forward when Chung at

from the head. The next stroke fell short

This was removed l>y the physicians at I

puty Sheriffs A. W. White, B. C.

EQUALIZERS TAKE ACTION
REDUCTION DENIED CHINA
TOWN LANDLORDS.
Victim of the Gas Company Appeals
to the Supervisors for Pro
tection Against Ex
tortion.
The last meeting of the Supervisors as a
Board of Equalization was held yesterday
morning. The subject of assessing com
mercial banks on such deposits as draw
interest came up, and after a lengthy dis
cussion the board raised the assessment
on the Bank of British North America by
adding to the assessment imposed by the
Assessor interest-bearing deposits to the
amount of $731,991, which sum is bearing
interest at 3 per cent. Britt and Morton
voted against the action of the board. It
is probable that the bank will take the
matter Into the courts.
Sixty-nine owners of property In China
town asked for a reduction of their as
f-ssment to the extent of 50 per cent.
They represented through their attorney,
Mr. Ruef, that values had shrunk in that
district during the past few years from 25
to 75 per cent, while the assessments had
remained the same. The request for a re
duction was denied, and the Board of
Kquallzation adjourned without day.
board met at 3 in the afternoon as
a Hoard of Supervisors and transacted
a routlno business. A bid for lighting the
city with Kas and electricity according to
pecincatlona on file was received
from tin- Slui Francisco Gas and Electric
pany at 11 cents for gas and 50 cents
for electric lights. As this was the only
bid, the, board decided that it was the low
utd passed to print a resolution
awarding the contract.
By request of Lackmann his nlekel-in
the-slot order went over until next Sep
tember. It had been amend.-d in the judi
ciary committee so as to prohibit the use
of Blot machines that pay prizes in money.
When the bid of Scott & Magner came
before the board for supplying forage to
public institutions at $19 50 per ton, Super
visor Smith said that he had investigated
the matter and had discovered since the
tost meeting that the bid was the lowest
that the board could get. He had not suc
c.-edea in finding any one to offer hay for
less.
At the preceding meeting of a week ago
Mr. Smith announced in ope.n board that
2% cou .to buy all the hay he wanted for
$17 or $18 per ton, and that the city would
save money by buying hay in the open
market. Mr. Smith did not attempt to
explain the discrepancy between his state
ment of a week ago and his statement, of
yesterday. The resolution awarding the
contraot was passed to print. D. Keefe
â¢white man comes near. He declares that
he will remain two days.
There are two tiers of 50-pound cans of
Fiowder in fhe door which the officers
ear. They declare that were It not p>Â»
the surrounding residences they would ex
{ plode the magazine.
At midnight Deputy Sheriffs Ed White,
i r. M. White and J. C. Woodsum were dis
: patched to assist in guarding the magx-
I zinc and keeping the Chinaman from
| making his escape.
| J. H. Pitman, secretary of the powder
! works, approached the magazine to reason
! with the Chinaman, he having been a
trusted employe for many years and being
on very friendly terms with Pitman. The
desperate murderer drew a bead on Pit
man with his revolver and would not al
: low him to approach nearer than twenty
i yards.
Pitman offered to engage a lawyer, and
] to take him in his buggy to the jail, where
he would be protected, but the besieged
I coolie declined to come out. He said he
â  would think about it. and would probably
accept the offer in the morning if he did
I not succeed in making his escape before
I that time. When, in reply to a question,
! ho said that he had no money. Pitman
â  sent him $10, which the wily Moneolian
â  would not receive from the giver's hand
and which was thrown into the door to
. him.
By advice of Secretary Pitman, the
i Sheriff's guards withdrew in order to al
low the desperate Chinaman an opportu
nity of escaping from the magazine.
The injured man died at 12:35 tills morn
ing.

bridge will be done next week. In two
months" time the railroad company states
that the entire change will be completed
and Webster street and Alice street will
be deserted by the local trains. If by that
time the county and the cities of Oak
land and Alameda have not decided what
to do' in regard to Alice-street bridge the
railroad company will be forced to re
move it In accordance with their instruc
tions from the War Department.
The vacant 6pace between the tracks at
Second and Webster streets, in accord
ance with the terms of the ordinance
granting the railroad company that sec
tion of franchise, must be converted into
a public park and be kept free of all ob
structions so that passengers and teams
approaching the curve cannot possibly be
overtaken by trains which they could not
see till a collision was unavoidable. This
three-cornered park will be a great im
provement to that section of the city.
The orders for bridges to be rebuilt
were received by the county and the rail
road company at the same time, and al
though the company has its large bridge i
almost ready for use, the county has not I
yet moved in the matter. Inquiry to-day
showed that the correspondence on the
i matter on behalf of the county is now at \
i Washington and that no answer is ex- \
i pected from the War Department for sev- i
I eral weeks. The new railroad bridge Is I
i a vast improvement over the former
bridges, and the removal of steam trains j
! from the bridge occupied by teams Is \
i something that has been desired for <
years.
The Alice-street bridge matter was
brought up at the Supervisors' meeting
this morning and Mr. Roeth, who has the
matter In hand, reported progress, but
asked for more time.
J. F. Kelly Goes Free.
OAKLAND, July 18.â Judge Allen dis
missed the action against James F. Kel- j
ly, who was charged with attempting to I
kill Captain Anderson on a local train
three weeks ago. The defense showed
that the man was under the influence of
liquor when the trouble occurred, that he ;
was a friend of Anderson and that he had
always borne a good reputation. The com
plaining witness did not press the charge
and It was allowed to drop, much to Kel
ly's satisfaction.

Year.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July IS.
The Board of Equalization adjourned
sine die this evening, after the least in
teresting and most peaceable session held
for some years. Usually some extension
of time has been necessary from the
State Board, but this year there was so
little business that not one-quarter of the
time has been necessary.
The old subject of the value of fran
chises enjoyed by street railroads occu
pied the attention of the county board
to-day. E. Black Ryan, tax agent for the
Southern Pacific, asked for several reduc
tions. The Telegraph-avenue line is as
sessed at $34,500, and a reduction to $10,
450 was asked. The San Pablo line is as
sessed at $70,750, and a reduction to $11,750
was asked. The company values the elec
tric line on Telegraph avenue, at Hum
boldt avenue, in the annexed district, at
$10,200. The Assessor's figures were $36,
800. The total assessment is $214,200, and
the company asktd that it be cut to $56,
300. The Berkeley lines were assessed for
$23,750, and a reduction was asked to $0350,
and for the franchise from $0000 to $1000.
Some reductions were granted on the
rolling stock of the road, and a discussion
followed regarding the value of the fran
chises. Finally the franchises of the Oak
land Railroad Company were reduced to
$50,000.
The thirty-eight acres of water-front
property in West Oakland were assessed
by the Assessor for $221,800; the com
pany's valuation was $171,000. Mr. Mitchell
stated that he had taken expert testi
mony on the matter and was convinced
that the property was not worth more
than half of its assessed valuation, and
the application was granted.
The matter of placing on the rolls cer
tain assessments that had not been en
tered came up for discussion, and the As
sessor was authorized to put it on the
roll.

DECISIONS ON
BANKRUPT LAW
Federal Statute Ruled to
Be Paramount.
SUPERSEDES THE STATE LAW
BESTJI/T Or MANY YEARS' LEG
ISLATIVE EFFORT.
Debtors and Creditors Alike Expected
to Reap Much Benefit and to Be
Satisfied With the
Change,
Judge Belcher has ruled, In an ex
parte presentment, that the Federal
bankruptcy law has succeeded and is now
operative Instead of the State law. The
Federal law went into effect on July 1,
and is now operative in all cases, except,
as provided in the statute, that such pro
ceedings as were commenced before July
1 shall be finally adjudicated in the State
courts.
The following communication on this
subject will be found of interest:
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: On the Ist
day of July, 1898, "An act to establleh a uni
form system of bankruptcy throughout the
United States" was parsed by Congress "to go
into full force and effect upon its passage."
As it has been some years since a national
bankrupt law existed, and after August 1
this law will be the only law in force on the
subject, I deem It certain that the community
would be interested In learning some of the
provisions of this new law, and therefore send
you this communication.
The first bankrupt law in the United States
was passed April 4, ISOO, but was expressly
limited to five years' duration. It was
repealed on December 19, 1803, bo did not exist
as long as its original limit would permit.
The second was passed In 1841, but was re
pealed in 1843. It liquidated debts at the rate
of about $10,000,000 per year while in existence.
The next national law relating to bankruptcy
was approved March 2, 1867, and was re
pealed in 1878. To these various acta of Con
gresa there were objections found when they
were enforced. The objection to the act of 1867
was mainly to the enormous cost arising under
it in the distribution of bankrupt estates.
In tha present act Congress has attempted
to avoid the faults of the former act, and has
apparently succeeded In doing so.
Bankrupt and Insolvent laws depend wholly
upon statutory law. Without them unfortunate
debtors could not be relieved from their debts
and would forever be excluded from entering
Into business, however capable of transacting
it. The constitution of the United States gives
to Congress the right to enact a uniform sys
tem of bankruptcy, and when that power la
exercised the State laws on that subject are
suspended. There are several advantages to
creditors as well as debtors under the national
law. Under the national law the debtor is
discharged from hl6 debts without reference to
the place where they were contracted, while
under a State law he is only discharged frum
debts contracted In the State where he con
tracted them.
Under the State law one may be discharged
and still be unable to engage In business in
consequence of owing foreign creditors from
which the State law cannot discharge him.
i Congress has been engaged for several years
forfeited his bail last week by failing to
appear for his second trial after a dis
agreement in the first. His attorneys
claimed that they misunderstood the
date, but no effort has yet been made to
vacate the order forfeiting the bail.
Chief of Police Fletcher has decided to
have the patrol wagons covered as the
San Francisco wagons are. The Council
last week asked why they were not cov
ered as directed. The Chief was not sat
isfied with the covering and will have new
ones made.
Young People Fail to Agree.
OAKLAND, July 18.â Mrs. Nancy B.
Simon filed a suit for divorce from her
husband, E. J. Simon, to-day. The couple
were married three years ago In Ala
meda. The event was a society affair, as
the bride. Miss Nancy Culver, was well
known, popular and wealthy. The groom
was a medical student, only 20 years of
age. The bride was 18. Mr. Simon has
been East studying, and recently came
home for his vacation. It is understood
that they agreed to disagree, and no con
test will be made. There>are no children
or property rights to quarrel over.
Honored by His Late Associates.
OAKLAND, July 18.â The funeral of
Daniel Titus, the pioneer attorney, who
died last week, took place this morning
from the late residence, 956 Myrtle street.
Many of his old friends and associates
of the San Francisco bar were in attend
ance. They brought many floral tributes
to his bier. Rev. J. K. McLean, D. D.,
and Rev. C. R. Brown of the First Con
gregational Church officiated. Mrs. A. M.
Benham, Mrs. Lena Carroll Nicholson
and Messrs. P. Griswold and H. K. Snow
furnished appropriate music. The re
mains were taken to the Odd Fellows'
Cemetery, San Francisco, for cremation.
The Will Still Missing.
OAKLAND, July 18.â Mrs. Bridget Mul
doon appeared before Judge Greene to
day without the missing will of the late
Mary Sweeney. When she took the stand
the court said:
"Madam, 1 suggested to you a week ago
the propriety of bringing that will here
to-day. Have you got it?"
"No, sir; I haven't," was the reply. "1
have not seen it since the day after my
sister died, when Mrs. Johnson put it in
a box. I never laid a hand on it. Mrs.
Johnson is the only one who had it."
"Well." said the court, "but Mrs. John
son says different, doesn't she?"
"I don't know what she says," was the
reply. "I say the truth."
"Well, madam," said Judge Greene,
sternly, "I am frank to tell you that I
think Mrs. Johnson tells the truth and
that you have that will in your possession
or have it concealed."
Mrs. Sweeney was given another chance
to produce the will.

Alameda News Items.
ALAMEDA, July IS.â The Alice-street
bridge matter has been postponed one
week in order to give the cities of Oak
land and Alameda an opportunity to state
definitely what they propose to do in the
way of preparing approaches for It.
In framing- a national bankrupt law. At last,
all differences were adjusted and the present
law showed great care in Its provisions. This
law takes out of the hands of creditors the
ordinary remedial premises for collecting
debts and substitutes a comprehensive remedy
df-si^ned for the common benefit of all. Un
der this late law "Any person who owes debts,
except a corporation, shall be entitled to the
benefits of this act aa a voluntary bankrupt."
The exemptions to which the creditor is en
titled under this law are the same as under
the several State exemption laws existing at
the time of tiling the petition. So it will be
seen that it Is left for the States to regulate,
each for itself, the amount and kinds of prop
erty to which the creditor can claim exemp
tion.
The great difference between this act of July
1 and that of 1567 is that In this late law the
costs are limited, while In that of the former
law the costs were to be charged by the offi
cers of court in the ordinary way of charging
the costsâ item by item.
The present law Is particularly favorable to
the discharge of honest debtors.
It permits a petition for a discharge to be
filed after the expiration of one month and
within the next twelve months subsequent to
being adjudged a bankrupt.
It provides for a composition with creditors
on the consent of a majority In value of the
creditors and if such composition Is confirmed
the debtor Is thereby discharged from his
debts.
There are involuntary provisions also In the
act. but the limit of this article will not per
mit an explanation of them here.
Like all bankrupt and Insolvent laws the
present act is merely the framework to be
clothed by the numerous equitable principles
Involved, where property is to he distributed
to a large number of individuals, under one
execution. Instead of many. The practice un
der the law of necessity Is somewhat pecu
liar and unlike general practice. In my opin
ion the law will give satisfaction to both the
debtors and the creditors.
R. THOMPSON.
The following 1b an opinion from Oak
land on the same subject:
OAKLAND, July 18.â According to a ruling
of Judge Sam P. Hall to-day the State Insol
vency law is operative until August 1, when
the United States bankruptcy act goes into
effect. In the Federal act passed July 1 and
which goes into efTect the first of next month,
It 13 provided that no petition shall be filed
thereunder In tho interim. In his decision
Judge Hall held that insolvents could not be
deprived of the benefit of the remedy of the
State law until the Federal act was In force.
The case was that of W. A. Mackay. a grocer
of Eighth and Market streets, who owes
$2064 33 and has assets amounting to $1210 10.
ZAKREWESKEI'S CLAIM.
Suit for the Reward in the Weber
Case Submitted.
The suit for the reward offered by Gov
ernor Markham for the apprehension of
the murderer of F. H. L. Weber and his
wife, in which Chief Lees has struggled
so hard in an endeavor to prevent the
plory he purloined from being stripped
from him, haa been submitted.
The proceedings yesterday consisted of
the examination of George Levin, a wit
ness in the trial of Kovalev, murderer of
the Webers. Levin was a witness for the
State in the present action, but his evi
dence was immaterial. He succeeded in
tangling himself- up and counsel were
about to take steps to Impeach him when
the court stated that it was not worth
while, as the evidence given by Levin
was of no particular value.
The testimony given by Zakreweskei.the
claimant for the reward, during the trial
of Kovalev was then read in evidence and
the case was submitted. A decision ia
expected in a few days.
Ended the Struggle.
Frank R. Lyon, sick, out of work and
despondent, turned on the gas In his
room Sunday night and ended the strug
gle for bread. He was 40 years of age
and leaves a widow and two children, who
are now living in Oregon, and a brother,
who runs the Weekly Motor at Mllo,
lowa. The deceased formerly kept a ci
gar store on Eighth street, but business
was poor and he sold out. He was un
able to procure employment, and the
strain and despondency soon told on his
system. He was rooming at the lodging
bouse 22% Seventh street.
COAL OIL IN
THE LATHING
Peculiar Case of Arson
Being Probed.
THE GLUD HOME IN DANGER
ANGRY WOMEN DROP HINTS
REGARDING THE MYSTERY.
Detectives and Fire Warden Find
Many Suspicious Circum
stances, but Are Still
in Doubt.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 18.
Paul Glud, who resides at Second and
Oak streets, has asked the police to try
to ascertain who is anxious to burn down
his house. Last Saturday night, during
the temporary absence of himself and
wife, some one made the attempt to de
stroy their home.
An investigation made by Detectives
Holland and "Quigley and Fire Warden
Lawton showed that the plastering in a
closet had been knocked off and coal oil
poured down on the laths. Some small
sticks soaked in oil were stuck in be
tween the laths and are smoke-stained,
as though an attempt had been made to
set them on tire. Another hole had been
knocked In tho wall behind a washstand
and more oil poured down upon the laths.
After laying these plans to fire the house
the incendiary swept up the plastering off
the floor and carried it out of the house,
and this peculiar action Is very mystify
ing to the officials, who cannot understand
why an incendiary should show such care.
"We were away from the house for an
hour and a half on Saturday evening,"
paid Mrs. Glud this afternoon, "and on
our return I detected the odor of coal oil.
I traced the origin of the smell and found
the holes in the plaster where the coal oil
had been poured. In one opening a par
tially burned paper bag was stuck."
The police cannot find any evidence that
a forcible entry was made into the house,
and declare that some one very well ac
quainted with the premises must have
planned the scheme. The Gluds only re
cently moved to the house from another
house they own on Franklin street. Their
present home is Insured for $800, but is
worth considerably more. Mrs. Glud de
clared that her previous tenant, Mrs.
Baumgarten, had twelve keys to the
house, and that she only returned nine,
and that probably the incendiary got one
of the missing keys. Mrs. Glud even hint
ed that Mrs. Baumgarten could tell who
had been in the house last Saturday night.
Mrs. Baumgarten emphatically denied
knowing anything of the scheme, and she
returns the hint of Mrs. Glud with inter
est. She declares she gave up all the
keys, and further stated that If Mrs. Glud
persisted in making insinuations there
would soon be some work for the court.
SENSATIONAL ARREST
OF A RICH YOUNG MAN
ACCUSED OF BURGLARY BY MRS.
MOORE OF BERKELEY.
Prisoner Asserts His Innocence and
Declares That the Charge Is the
Outcome of a Conspiracy.
OAKLAND, July 18.â Hugo Lindeman, a
wealthy young man of Berkeley, was ar

The circumstances surrounding the arrest
are very peculiar, and Llndeman declares
he will spend $10,000, if necessary, to get
at the bottom facts in the case. He Is
well able to do it.

CALIFORNIA CLUB'S PROJECT
AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP CHIL
DREN OFT THE STREETS.
School Board Furnishes the Lana
and Professor Miehling Will
Drillâ Other "Play Lots"
to Be Secured.
The educational department of the Cal
ifornia Clubâ an organization that has
among Its membership some four hun
dred of the most public-spirited ladies of
this cityâ has taken the Initiative in ar
ranging for public playgrounds for the
children that now roam the streets.
Public playgrounds are a feature In
Boston, New York, Chicago, Denver and
at least seven other large Eastern cities;
also in London, and in each they have
proved a success.
Mrs. Lovell White, president of the Cal
ifornia Club, and Miss Julia George, cor
responding secretary, are both very en
thusiastic workers along this line of bet
tering the condition of juvenile humanity.
School Director Sam Waller has also been
particularly Interested in the scheme of
public playgrounds and through his kind
ly Influences the Board of Education has
granted the use of the old Girls' High
School lot, on Bueh street, between Hyae
and Larkin, for the purpose. The lot Is
properly fenced In and this morning a
sign will be put up designating it as
ajgublic playground.
"This will Tse the first of its kind in
this city," said Miss George last evening,
! "but It Is our purpose to secure such
grounds in various parts of the city until
every section is cared for. Then, when
j the scheme, which is deserving of public
support, has proved all that we claim, we
expect the School Board to see to its fur
therance. In London such playgrounds
are about a mile apart, and have been a
success for seven years."
Professor George S. Miehling, instruct
or at the Olympic Club and also in physi
cal culture in the School Department, is
also very enthusiastic in the matter and
has kindly volunteered his services. He
proposes to form companies of young
sters and will drill them in military tac
tics, calisthenics and field sports. He has
always devoted a great deal of his time
to charity and has consented to be pres
ent at the grounds Monday and Friday
mornings during the vacations and there
after In the afternoons after school
hours.
The grounds will be opened next Fri
day morning at 10 o'clock, and will re
main open thereafter. In the course of
time the promotors of this public enter
prise hope to have symnaÃtio and other
i apparatus on the grounds.
constable of Oakland Township, there is
not the slightest foundation for the
charge. Two nights ago Lindeman and
Koch were on Telegraph avenue, near the
former's home. They heard loud yelling
and crls of murder in a house near Forty
seventh street, and they at once ran to
the rescue of anybody that might need
their services. They entered the house
and found children running around in
their night dresses, and a few minutes
later the parents appeared in dishabille
and the household was in a state of great
excitement. The inmates shouted, "He's
gone, he's gone; it's all right!" and Linde
man and Koch departed without being
able to get any other explanation.
They laughed over tne Incident and
thought no more of it. To-day Mrs.
Moore went before the District Attorney
and swore to a warrant charging LJnde
man with burglary, alleging that he
~roke into her premises with felonious in
tentions during the night.
Officer Con Keefe arrested Lindeman to
night and he was brought to the City
Prison. He quickly found bondsmen, in
cluding Supervisors Church, and was re
leased. He says there Is a plot in his
arrest and he is determined to find out
who is responsible for his humilitation.
Hugo Lindeman is the owner of several
large blocks in Berkeley, and the family
is one of the best known In that end of
the county. The police do not believe
there is any legal foundation for the
charge and Lindeman says he never saw
or heard of Mrs. Moore before in his life.
A SOLUTION PKOPOSED.
Trustee Frame Thinks That Berkeley-
Should Lease the Alameda
Water Company's System.
BERKELEY, July 18.â A. R. Frame, a
member of the Berkeley Board of Trus
tees, has a plan of his own, which he
thinks would bring about a solution of tne
water problem. He is fully confident that
the town will, before very long, own a
Bystem of its own, but he realizes the im
minence of the present danger which
threatens the town with a water famine,
and proposes the following course of ac
tion:
"There is," he says, "one way of over
coming the perplexing dilriculty which at
present confronts the town.
"Inasmuch as the Alameda Water Com
pany can not or will not expend the
money necessary for furnishing an ade
quate supply of water, let the town enter
into negotiations for the lease of the said
company's system, and in ca.se of success
arrange with the Oakland company for a
connection with its pipes for whatever
water would be necessary, until such time
as the town could develop its own supply.
Of course, I assume that the Alameda
company would be willing to treat with
the town regarding the disposition of its
property. We should lease with the op
tion of purchasing whenever the town
should vote bonds for the purpose, the
purchase price to be determined between
the water company and commissioners
appointed by the municipality.
"It seems to me If the matter be taken
up at once, and all parties be agreeable,
that the arrangement should be consum
mated within thirty daysâ the talk of wa
ter shortage in Berkeley would then cease.
The advantage of having the water sys
tem in our own control must be patent to
any one.
"I have not time to discuss the matter
in detail, but hope the suggestion may call
forth the opinions of those parties more
able to deal with the exigencies of the sit
uation. There is no water famine in Ber
keley, and it is most likely that there will
be none, but more water must be provided
to accommodate the rapid growth of the

Lost Both Arms.
ALAMEDA, July 18.â News has reached
here that Ed Chase, who was formerly
connected with Fred Mandler's bakery
and cafe on Park street, their amputa
tion beinj? necessitated by reason of thefr
being frozen while prospecting In the gold
fields of the north. Chase met with varied
reverses before. An one time he was In
business In San Francisco and failed.
Shortly afterward he came into posses
sion of some $200,000 through the races
and by other means; but he soon lost all,
and when he left for the Klondike about
five months ago he had but $150 to carry
hinj through.
A Metcalf Meeting.
ALAMEDA, July 18.â A mass meeting
for the purpose of indorsing the candi
dacy of Victor E. Metcalf for Congress to
succeed S. G. Hllborn was held this even
ing at LJnderman Hall. Many of the
most prominent Republicans and party
workers of the city were present and
strong speeches were made.
The Climate of Cuba.
Because of frequent rains In Cuba, malarial
fevers are a common aliment there, Just as
they are in many sections of the United
States. Ailments of this kind, no matter In
what part of the globe they occur, are quickly
cured with Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. Be
sides being a specific for malarial troubles,
these Bitters also make pure blood, strong
nerves and muscles, and firm, healthy flesh.
They have no equal for dyspepsia and con
stipation.

VENUS SMILES UPON MARS.
Colonel Macdonald to Wed Miss Wolf
on Wednesday
f\ OLONEL WILLIAM MACDONALD
Is to w^rl Miss Alice S. Wolff.
I. The well known soldier and insur-
man blushlngly admitted the de
lightful story to his many friends yester
day, while his prospective bride received
BEE ADMITS
HE SPOKE
TO POPPER
Asked Him to With
draw His Suit.
WAS GIVEN MANY PROMISES
THE DETECTIVE SHIELDS THE
SCHEMING CHIEF.
Says He Was Sent by His
Fellow-Workers to Call
the Politician
Off.
The abortive attempt of Chief Lees to
Influence Max Popper to withdraw his
now famous salary suit was the all-ab-
Borbing topic of conversation of the <'ity
Hall yesterday. The sleuths of the "up
per office" temporarily abandoned their
search for the brutal murderer of Sadie
Simpson to discuss the bold move of the
cunning Chief.
The latter was in an ugly frame of mind
due to the publication of the story, and
doggedly ordered his men around.
Detective Joseph Bee. when seen at his
home yestorday, denied, of course, that
lyees had sent him to "see" Popper.
"A short time ago." he said, in explana
tion of why he had asked Popper to drop
the suit, "Captain Wittman, several
members of the detective force and my
self were discussing the subject, when
It was suggested that I should see Popper
and endeavor to have him abandon the
action.
"As they all expressed themselves in
favor of the proposition the following day
I called on Popper, who has always been
my friend. I explained to him that we
were being deprived of the additional sal
ary allowed us by the Legislature on ac
count of his action and asked him to let
go.
"He made no promise to me but told me
to see him again. I did so, and renewed
the proposition. He sold at that time that
he was busy with the charter, but if the
measure was adopted he would not press
the appeal which is pending in the Su
preme' Court. The charter was elected
and we concluded that Popper would not
further harass us. That is all there was
to it. Chief Lees knew nothing of m.v
visit to Popper, nor w:is he aware of our
discussion over the matter."
Notwithstanding Bee's denial of Lees'
action, it is positively known that the de
tective was sent by him to induce Popper
to withdraw the appeal.
The superannuated head of the police
department, fully realizing that he has
only a short time more in which to blun
der before his official head falls into the
basket, determined to call Popper off so
that he could retire on the increased pen
sion allowed him by the new salary law.
Knowing that Bee was on Intimateterms
with Popper the astute Chief, after ex
tending to him the glad but chilly hand,
told him to pee th" politician and endeav
or to influence him to wlhtdraw the suli.
"What promises were to be made to Pop
per are only known to Lees and Bee, but
It is understood that he was to have a
voice in the management of the police de
partment, providing that he consented to
a withdrawal of the suit.

Merchants have been generous in their

There is a difference of opinion regard
ing the disposal of the money between the
officers of the Native Daughters' Red
Cross Aid and the Red Cross Society. The
following letter is self-explanatory:
July 15, IS9B.
Mrs. Frank H. Mills, Acting President Xa
tlw Daughters' Red Cross Aid, San Francisco-
Dear Madam: It has been suggested to the
Red Cross Society of Pan Francisco that the
results of the or>torta!nment to be given by
the Seventh California Volunteers, under the
auspices of the Native Daughters" Red Cross
Aid Society Is to be given to the emorgency
fund of the First California Volunteers now at
Mimila.
Our sr^-lety fails to see why the Seventh Cal
ifornia should he called upon to help the First
California, we having sent the sum of $1500
to them June 25.
If this entertainment Is to be given in the
name of this society the returns must be mad*
to th<-m, otherwise no control of funds could
be had. We think you can see the Justice of
this, for It Is the basis upon which our enter
tainment committee works. Hoping we may
meet with your committee and adjust this
I matter at your earliest convenience, I remain,
very respectfully,
MRS. W. R. FCKART, Secretary.
MRS. JOHN F. MERRILL. President.
The matter has not been adjusted. "We
have had the opinions of two lawyers and
have been Informed that there is no legal
reason why we cannot give this entertain
i mont," Bald Mrs. Edward Lunatedt last
| night. "We believe we have a right to
say how the money shall be disbursed."
Mrs. John F. Merrill, president of the
Red Cross Society, paid: "We must ex
ercise supervision over all benefits given
in the name of our society. If we did not
do so thf>re would be endless confusion,
and worse. We hope this little misunder
standing will be straightened out. I met
Mrs. Mills, the president, and thought
everything had been explained to her sat
isfaction."
The entertainment will take place and
It is expected there will be no clash be
tween the two bodies.
Montana Soldiers Grateful.
The high regard entertained for the
Catholic Truth Society by the Montana
Volunteers is expressed in the following 1
words of recognition:
Wheras, Tho Catholic Truth Society has, by
its untiring efforts, cared for the sick and

The Christian Commisslrn.
The Press Club gave a most delightful
entertainment at the Montana tent last
Saturday evening, which was the last en
tertainment under the auspices of the
Christian Commission with this regiment,
and a farewell service was held Sunday
evening. Both of these services were
largely attended and greatly enjoyed by
the men.
The commission placed on hoard the
transport Pennsylvania a library of 1500
books and 600 hymn books, and presented
Chaplain Stull with a portable organ. A
library of 1500 books and 600 song books
will be consigned by the commission to

their secret that their betrothal was not
even suspected.
However, as the auspicious day on
which they were to plight their troth drew
near, both bride and groom, bubbling
over with a happiness they could no
longer conceal, took their family and im
mediate friends Into their confidence and
the interesting betrothal finally became
noised about.
Miss Alice S. Wolff, the young bride-to
be, has a large circle of friends in this city,
where she has resided for many years.
For the past ten years she filled the posi
tion of private secretary to Colonel MaÂ».
donald. and during her leisure hours has
devoted considerable attention to literary
work, much of which has been in the na
ture of contributions to the Argonaut and
Eastern publications.
Her sister. Miss Emma Wolff, is also of
a literary mind and is the author of sev
eral popular novels.
Colonel Macdonald is probably one of
the boat known men in California. He is
an old soldier and for many years was
prominently Identified with the National
Guard of California in various capacities,
latterly as colonel of the Second Artil

manager of the London and Lancashire
Insurance Company he has proved him
self one of the shrewdest local men in
that business.
The ceremony which will unite the In

WAS NEARLY TRICKED
OUT OF HIS FORTUNE
A POOB COBBLER WINS A PRIZE
IN THE LOTTERY.
Informed That the Ticket Called for
an Approximation, When It
Had Won a Thousand
Dollars.
Patrick Hyland, a poor cobbler, has re
cently become possessed of a thousand
dollars through Investment in a lottery
ticket. That amount does not represent
the full face value of the ticket which he
held and thereby hangs a tale.
Hyland purchased his ticket from A. H.
Merken, a groceryman at Hyde and
O'Farrell streets. Merken is also his
landlord, renting him the small establish
ment that does duty alike for shop and
place of habitation. Upon the day of the
drawing Merken looked over the list of
winnings and found, as he afterward ac
knowledged, that the ticket had won $1250
lie then went to the cobbler and told him
that he had won an approximation prize
und was entitled to one dollar. Hylana
took the dollar. The next day he learned
that the lea-st an approximation prize
should be was $1 25. and demanded that
amount. Merken handed over the iwen
ty-five cents to make up the deficiency
Shortly after this Hyland learned that
the ticket which he had held originally
had won $1250. He demanded an account
ing from Merken, but received no satis
faction. Ho then placed the matter in the
hands of Matt I. Sullivan, the attorney
with instructions to press it. Merken at
once tried to compromise, offering $loJ
and then took Merken's deposition. In the
deposition he secured acknowledgment
*rom him of the part he played through
out. He asked him finally what difference
')'â  paw bi-twfon his net and that of a
highwayman who stood up his friend on
the road and robbed him of all his pos
sessions. He replied that he thought oiio
was a crime and the other only a smart
trick.
The questions of Mr. Sullivan were so
pointed and contained so many references
to his act as a felony and the punishment
imprisonment In the State Prison that the
witness grew anxious to compromise.
When he offered $1000 the man champion
ing the cause of the cobbler advised him
to accept that amount. On this basis the
matter was settled some days since. Hy.
land affirms that that amount is more
than he ever possesed at one time before
and to him appears like a large fortune.
DESTROYED BY FUMIGATION.
Chinese Merchants Object to New
Methods at the Quarantine
Station.
Chinese merchants are greatly incensed
over the action of Dr. Rosenau at the
quarantine station, who, they claim, is
ruining every consignment of food prod
ucts shipped from Hongkong.
It was formerly the custom to remove
all personal effects, household goods, etc.,
to Angel Island for disinfection, but Dr.'
Rosenau rscently sent a letter to the Col
lector of Custonn, requesting him also to
hold shipments of food products. Every
ship arriving from Hongkong carries
quantities of salted eggs, limes, cab
bages, bananas and other goods of like
nature. If these are taken to the quaran
tine station and fumigated they are
ruined. One of the recent sufferers was
Wing Fung, who had a quantity of salted
eggs shipped him from Hongkong. They
were taken to the island and subjected to
the fumigating process, the result being
that all which did not burst from the heat
were ruined in other ways, and the ship
ment was a total loss.
The Chinese Merchants' Exchange has
taken the matter in hand, and, acting un
der the advice of a number of white
I brokers whose sympathies have, been
aroused, will send an appeal to the de-
I partment at Washington to have the
[ nuisance abated.

TWELVE RIVER BOATS
BOUND FOR DAWSON
MAY BE WRECKS
Left Seattle for St. Michael on June 2
and Although Long Overdue Have
Not Been Heard From.
Lowness of the River May Prevent Further Navi
gation of the Yukon-Storms Scatter a Pas
senger Fleet From the Sound and Many
Tows Are Lost.
The appalling news has reached this city that a fleet of twelve river steamers designed to ply on the
Yukon between St. Michael and Dawson have disappeared on the high seas somewhere between Seattle and St.
Michael. They are more than a month overdue, and they have not been heard from since they passed out
of sight of land on leaving the Sound. Other steamers and sailing vessels have met with misfortune on the
way up, and many of them lost the barges laden with valuable cargo which they had in tow.
The river steamers built for the Yu
kon trade have beon wonderfully un
fortunate. So far out of the dozens
that were constructed here, in Portland
and on Pupet Sound only two will reach
Dawson City this year. These are the
Louise, put together at Unalaska, and
the Leah, built at St. Michael for the
Alaska Commercial Company. Accord
ing to the report of E. Anders, Collec
tor of Customs at St. Michael, the
steamer National City lost her tow. the
James Eva; the Conemaugh lost a river
steamer and a barge, the bark Rufus
E. Wood lost her river steamer over
board, the old tug Governor S^onernan
lost a barge with a large quantity of
freight when the river broke up, and
the twelve steamers sent out from Seat
tle by the Moran Brothers were counted
among the missing when the St. Paul
left St. Michael. Apart from all this
the miners were very Indignant because
ex-Mayor Wood of Seattle had failed
to brinK on six tons of mail that had
been sent on the steamer Alliance, and
had it not been for the military there
would probably have been a lynching
bee. To add to the woes of the miners
the river was so low that it was the
general opinion of everybody who
knows the country that unless there are
some heavy rains the only boats that
will Ket up to Dawson will be those that
were loaded and ready to start when
the Pt. Paul sailed.
In talking about the state of affairs
at St. Michael when he left. Collector of
Customs Anders said yesterday: "The
pteam schooner Alliance left Seattle
about the middle of June for St. Mich
ad with about six tons of mail aboard.
Ex-Mayor Wood secured the contract
from the Government for carrying the
mail and chartered the Alliance to do
the work. Instead of going direct to
St. Michael she stopped at Dutch Har
bor and lay there waiting for her river
steamer to be completed, which she wag
to tow to St. Michael. The steamers St.
Paul, Roanoke, Grace Dollar, Bertha
and Port all offered to take the mail on
for her, but the captain refused to part
v.-ith it, saying he would deliver it him
self.
"The majority of the miners on the i
Klondike are working on shares and
u'il were anxious to know what they ;
were to do during the coming year, i
Many were anxious to come to San
Francisco and were expecting instruc- :
tions by the first steamer up. In order i
to be on hand when the steamer ar- !
rived hundreds of the miners had i
worked their way down the river and \
had been living in the hotel or wher- j
ever they could get accommodations at
St Michael, awaiting the arrival of the
mail. When the news arrived that the
Alliance was lying in Dutch Harbor j
with six tons of mail on board awaiting
the completion of a river steamer the !
wrath of the miners knew no bounds.
When told that the St, Paul and other
eteamers had offered to bring the mail
on to St. Michael and see that it was
forwarded up the river It made matters
even worse. The only explanation of
fered was that the river steamer had
to be completed In order to taJce the ,

Soon after I was taken 111 my hair com-
menced to fall, so that each day more came
out than I thought I had in my head. I was
turning gray rapidly. Finally I became afraid
to have it combed, but the nurse said that
wouldn't do, and used vaseline to keep it
In, then used beef's marrow, then quinine
tonic, and finally (Ccticttea ointment), which
. helped it immediately. Tho nurse said she
rubbed up a fine white dust from the scalp
where she could sea nothing before com-
mencing, and the scalp looked healthier and
more natural every day. Now I haven't as
many gray hairs as when I commenced using
CcncuÃA, and I have a crop of fine brown
hair all over my bead about an inch and a
half in length. I only lose a few hairs when
combing every day, and always more gray
than brown. My nurse is delighted because
the new hairs are brown. I never had very
luxuriant hair, even in my youth. It is as
thick on my bead today as it ever was, and
Cuticuka did it. Mrs. J. M. LAWSON,

I mail on up to Dawson, and that there
was no use in bringing it on to St.
Michael until the boat was completed.
, The miners wanted to compel ex-Mayor
â¢ Wood to send after the Alliance at
once, and one word led to another un
til the ex-Mayor of Seattle would have
1 been roughly handled had it not been
that the soldiers interfered. When we
left St. Michael the mail had not ar
rived and the majority of the miners
had gone back up the river again.
"I have been stationed at St. Mi
, chael for four years and during that
time I have never seen the river as
low as it was when we left, while old
residents told me that in ten years
they had never seen so little water in
the Yukon at this time of the year.
There were about forty vessels lying
at St. Michael and those who had dis
charged their freight and passengers
into the river boats would be all right.
They will get back to their home
ports. Those that had not discharged,
but were waiting for river boats to
come along, will probably have to re
main there over the winter or else come
back with their freight and passengers.
The big British steamer Garonne from
Victoria, with 3500 tons of freight, was
lying five miles outside of St. Michael
harbor. Owing to her draught she
could get no closer, and as her goods
were all in bond there was no chance
of discharging them, so she will have
to take her load back to Victoria, B. C.
"The steamer National City arrived
in port after a stormy passage. After
; getting through Unga Pass and into
j Bering Sea she had to face a regular
Arctic storm. They say that the river
steamer James Eva, which she was
tmvirg, broke in two and went down.
I Her hog chains snapped with the work
ing of the vessel, and when they went
( there was little to hold her together.
â  Captain Hatfleld. his wife and the other
1 passengers, who were on the James
j Eva. got aboard the National City in
safety. When we left St. Michael they
; were on board the bark Rufus E.
Wood, which 'he Alaska Yukon Trans
! portation Company is using as a ho
: tel."
Continuing, Mr. Anders said:
"Among the safe arrivals was an outfit
on which I wouldn't travel very far by
water. It was the river steamer Clara,
which was towed up by the Samoa on
the barge Monarch. They had a rough
time of it. but got there all right. All
the transportation companies will lose
money this year and the chances are
that very little freight will get up the
river. None of the steamers being built
at Dutch Harbor for the Alaska Explo
ration Company will be ready in time
for this year's trade, and only one of
the Alaska Commercial Company's
steamers will be ready in time. The
latter company is all right, as far as
transportation goes, however, as it has
all its last year's fleet on the river."
In a letter to the Lynde-Hough Com
pany Captain Herriman says that the
James Eva broke in two and went
down and that the steamer Port also
lost her tow from Dutch Harbor. The
captain of the Grace Dollar and the
captain of the bark Rufus E. Wood
wrote to their owners to the same ef
fect. Robert Don, who built the river
steamer Leah for the Alaska Commer
cial Company, also says that the James
Eva went down, while Captain Haynes
of the St. Paul and Captain Erksine,
the pilot, state positively that the river
steamer is lost. In the face of all this
the Alaska-Yukon Transportation Com
pany asserts positively that the James
Eva is safe and sound at St. Michael.
They say that the purser of the St.
Paul has reported her safe arrival
there to Louis Sloss Sr. ; that four mi
ners who came down on the St. Paul
saw her at St. Michael, and are hurry
ing through their business here in or
der to catch her on the return passage.
Captain Hatfield has been heard from
indirectly by the officers of the com
pany, but not a word comes from him
In regard to the loss of the vessel. This
the president of the company considers
as conclusive proof that nothing had
happened to the steamer.
The bark Rufus E. Wood had a stern
wheel steamer on her deck when she
left San Francisco, but it was washed
overboard in Bering Sea. The lashings
broke and away it went. It belonged
to the Osborn party of gold hunters
from Redlands.
The Conemaugh took on several river
steamers at Seattle. They were built
of iron and were piled up higher than
the steamer's pilot-house. They were
washed overboard in a storm and a
barge that she was towing broke adrift
and was lost.
Robert Don, who left here last Sep
tember for St. Michael, came back on
the St. Paul. While he was away he
superintended the construction of the
steamer Leah and two 600-ton barges
for the Alaska Commercial Company.
Mr. Don thinks the chances for pas
sengers and freight getting up the Yu
kon are, to use his own words, "very
slim." "If they get rain all will be
well," said he yesterday. "If they
don't there will *be no more river
steamers get up the Yukon this year.
The first boat down was the St. Mi
chael, and when she crossed the Yukon
flats there was only two feet of water
on them. The next boat reported two
and a half feet of water and the last
one down, the Belle, had three feet in
which to navigate. At that point the
river remained stationary, but will be
gin to fall right away if there is no
rain. You see, the ice went out very
early this year, and that means very
little water on the flats, or, in fact,
anywhere else on the Yukon. With
three feet of water the first lot of
steamers may be able to work over the
flats, but should the river commence
to fall there is a very poor outlook for
getting passengers and freight to Daw
son.
"We left St. Michael on July 7 and at
that time there was no sign of the
THE SAIS FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 19, 1898.
Moran Brothers' fleet of river steamers.
They were all to go to St. Michael under
their own steam and after getting into
Bering Sea they must have caught it
Everybody at St. Michael had given
them up for lost, as they were then
more than a month out from Seattle
There were twelve of them to ply on
the Yukon, but whether they all left
Seattle or not I do not know. I do
know, however, that there have been
some terrific storms in Bering Sea, and
it would require a good steamer to live
through them. Of course, the steamers
may be at anchor in some safe haven
but all I know is that the people at St!
Michael never expected tc see them."
The Call's correspondent at Seattle
sends the following in regard to the
fleet:
The fleet of twelve Yukon River
steamers which Moran Brothers of Se
attle constructed left the Sound on June
2 with St. Michael as their destination.
Their ocean convoyers were the tugs
Resolute, Captain Tom Kilton, and
Richard Holyoke. Captain Klinger, and
the steam schooner South Coast.
The steamers that composed the fleet
(each vessel manned by a full crew)
were as follows: Pilgrim, Captain
Harry K. Struver: J. H. Light, Captain
Frank Grounds; D. R. Campbell, Tap
tain C. D. Brownfield; F. K. Gustin,
Captain W. D. Dobbins; St. Michael, J.
L. Fisher; Seattle, Captain R. McFar
land; Victoria, Captain C. F. Gilmore;
Oil City, Captain S. W. Wheeler; Rob
ert Kerr, Captain F. H. Berher; West
ern Star, Captain S. Hodgson; Tacoma,
Captain J. E. Drisco; and Mary E
Graff, Captain E. E. Stanford.
The flagship of the fleet was the
steamer Pilgrim, on board of which was
Robert Moran and Captain J. E. Len
non, chief pilot, who was to direct the
course of the boats from the Pilgrim.
The other steamers were to report to
her at stated times by flag and whistle
signals.
The Resolute had no tow and waa to
act as messenger steamer betw. â â¢ i. he
Pilgrim and the remainder of the fleet.
The Richard Holyoke had in tow five
big river barges, each of which had 150
tons of coal aboard. The South Coast
was loaded with coal. At Dutch Har
bor it was the intention to pick up the
four boats that the Morans built there
for the North American Trading and
Transportation Company. They are
the J. C. Barr, Klondike, Power and
Cunahy.
The twelve river boats built by Moran
Brothers were all on the same pattern,
and each cost $50,000. In length they
were 175 feet, beam 35 feet and depth
6.5 feet. These boats are Intended for
passenger and freight purposes, having
a capacity for 250 passengers and 400
tons of freight.
"Of the river boats that went up last
year," said Mr. Don, "some of them did
not get along very well. When the river
broke up the steamer Governor Stone
man lost her tow with all Its freight
and nearly wan wrecked herself. The
old Mare Island, that used to ply be
tween Berkeley and San Francisco, is
still tied up in the canal where she
made her home for the winter and will
never come out of it. She has been con
demned and her passengers got up to
Dawson the best way they could. The
Seattle No. 1, that went up with the
Wood outfit last fall, went on a sand
bar near Tanana when the river broke
up and was nearly wrecked. Luckily
she got off again and is now at Dawson.
All in all this Is going to be a decidedly
off year for gold hunters and transpor
tation companies."
When the St. Paul left St. Michael
the steamer Grace Dollar for Kotzebue
Sound was there awaiting the arrival
of the steamer Humboldt. Among
those who were going to Kotzebue on
her were Captain A. H. Herriman, who
goes up to look after the barkentine
Jane A. Falkenberg; C. Dickey, who
goes up to look after the barkentine
Catherine Sudden, and J. L. Wilson.
Of all the vessels that left here for
Kotzebue the only one sighted was the
Falkenberg, and she was spoken on
June 18 by the revenue cutter Bear on
the east end of St. Lawrence Island.
The captain asked to be reported as
"all well."
If the river steamer James Eva Is
lost the passengers who left here on
the Dirigo will be in a bad box. It
will be remembered that when the
steamer City of Dawson, which was to
have been towed up by the Dirigo,
was attached, arrangements were
made whereby the James Eva was to
take the gold hunters up the river from
St. Michael. In the event of the
steamer's loss the miners will have to
get up the Yukon the best way they
can.

Lane, who holds an assignment from Mrs.
i M. J. Turner, a milliner on Sutter street,
against "Mrs.Amanda J. Fennell, some
times known as Mrs. Amanda J. Mar
ceau," such being the phraseology of the
j complaint. The person sued Is nÂ«ne other
j that the ex-wife of the gallant Colonel
â¢ Marceau, whose matrimonial differences
; were adjusted in the San Francisco courts
i a short time ago.
The attorney in the case is Frank Schil
i ling, and he is warm on the trail of the"
| dashing Fresno boauty, who, he says, has '.
| neglected to liquidate her milliner's bill, 'â 
I and even worse, if anything could be
: worse, from a milliner's point of view, as '
, the lady when waited on by the patient
i lawyer simply laughed loud and long in
, his face and said she. did not care fo 4
' court notoriety, and especially from the
milliner in the case, as the latter did not !
belong to the "smart" set, but rather to
â  what society people call "trash." This '
â  method of liquidating a bill for $49 55, for
I the choicest tints in ribbons and the most
[ costly tips from the plumage of pretty
birds was not quite to the liking of the
attorney or his client, and as a conse
quence the suit was commenced and thtj
power of the Sheriff's office invoked to
collect the amount, with costs, of course.
The indebtedness was created about
four months ago, when the dashing widow*
was on the eve of departing for Chicago.
She telephoned to Mrs. Turner for the
goods, which were to be delivered C. O.
D., but just then the banks were closeu
and would not open before the next day.
When that time arrived Mrs. Fennell,
sometimes known as Mrs. Marceau, was
speeding on' the way to Chicago. She re
turned a few days ago and took rooms
at 620 Sutter street, but only remained
there a short time. Her present where
abouts is unknown, much to the discom
fort of Attorney Schilling, as he is most
anxious to make the acquaintance of her
trunk, in which he believes she has her
diamonds and other valuables sufficient to
pay both himself and Mrs. Turner.
A NOTED ASTRONOMER.
Professor Geelmuyder Will Examine
Our Observatories.
A noted Norwegian astronomer, Profes
sor Geelmuyder, arrived in this city last
night from Christiania, where he is con
nected with the university of that name.
He has been sent by the Norwegian Gov
ernment to make investigations concern
ing the construction of isolated observa
tories. In Chicago Professor Geelmuyder
spent a few days with Professor Bar
nard and studied the setting of the great
i erkes telescope. He will go to Mount
Hamilton to-morrow and make a detailed
examination of operations at the Lick Ob
servatory. It is the Intention of the Nor
wegian Government to build a new ob
servatory on a mountain back of Chris
tiania about 1500 feet high, and Professor
Geelmuyder is delegated to make observa
tions on our observatories and report to
nis Government.

NO ORDERS AS YET
FROM THE CZAR
HENRY SCOTT NOT INFORMED
OF ANY CONTRACTS.
Union Iron Works Officials Have No
Information as to I. M.
Scott's Success in
Russia.
The press dispatch from Berlin on Sun
day announcing the arrival there of Ir
ving M. Scott of the Union Iron Works
of this city and that his mission In Rus
sian had been wholly successful is not
credited by his brother, Henry T. Scott,
in this city.
"The dispatch is in error when It state*
that my brother was summoned to Rus
sia to confer with the Czar In regard to
Russian naval construction," said Hen
ry T. Scott yesterday. "We saw some
time since that the shipbuilding firm of
Cramps had secured contracts from the
Russian Government and we decided that
if there were any more ships to be built
we would be prepared to bid upon them.
It was in keeping with this determina
tion that Mr. Scitt wont abroad.
"Since ho left I have had but two ca
bles from him. Both of these treated of
his health and movements, but not one
word about business. He reached St. Pe
tersburg early this month and we have
no advices of his movements since that
time. 1 do not think he has closed any
contracts for several reasons. In the first
place he would hardly close a big. con
tract without consulting us or telling of
the progress of his negotiations. Had he
closed a deal his first thought would have
been to notify us of the success of his
mission. Russia may not be in need of
any fighting ships, so that his pilgrimage
may have been for nothing."

POLICE SLEUTHS
CANNOT UNRAVEL THE
CARPENTER MURDER
Much Valuable Time Wasted in Un
necessarily Looking for Evidence to
Support the Suicide Theory.
The Watch Owned by the Murdered Woman and
a Small Sum of Money She Was Known to
Have in Her Trunk Are Missing-An
Autopsy Held.
The Police Department is hopelessly at
sea in the work of unraveling the deatn
of Mr 3. Sadie Carpenter, who was stran
gled in a room of the Hubbard House, at
139 Fourth street, early Sunday morning.
Chief of Police Lece is satisfied that she
is dead, and holds as evidence the certifi
cate of Autopsy Physician John Galla
gher. Beyond the positive knowledge that
the unfortunate woman is dead Chief
Lees is in the dark. He started off with
the theory that Mrs. Carpenter committed
suicide and when the autopsy showed
that such was not the case he turned his
attention toward securing evidence to
prove that Joseph yon Lochner, the last
I person seen with her and who was ar
i rested on suspicion, is tho murderer.
â  There is not at present the least particle
I of evidence against Yon Lochner, but still
j he is locked up in the City Prison.
1 An investigation made by Call reporters
} yesterday brought to light the fact that
Yon Lochner, as far as known, was a
I friend of the murdered woman, and that
I there was no reason for suspecting him
of the crime The same investigation
1 showed that there were two other persons
who might have committed the murder
lnere is always a motive power back of
murder. In Yon Lochner's case there is
no -motive to be found. In the cases of
the other two jealousy and an<*er play an
I mportant part. It may be tnat neither
i Jealousy nor anger prompted the murder.
| The dead woman's watch is missing and
so is a small sum of money she is known
to have had in a trunk. She may have
I been the victim of a robber, or it may
I have been that the money and watch
were carried off to blind the detectives
and cause them to work on the robbery
theory. If the latter theory attains the
! murderer unduly credited Chief Lees with
j detective ability. There was no need of
I attempting to blind him, for he has been
blinded since the murder was committed.
The fact that he first took to the suicide
theory proved that he was unequal to tho
work of probing the mystery. While
working on the suicide theory much valu
able time was lost and the murderer given
â  an opportunity of covering up i.ie clews,
i that if at once followed might have result
j ed in nis speedy capture.
The murder was committed some time
after 1:15 o'clock Sunday morning, for
roomers in the house were awake at that
time and they did not hear any dlsturb
i ance. According to the statements made
, by others, they were awakened about 1:30
! o'clock Sunday morning by screams, but
| the night clerk in the office not over fifty
; feet away from the room says that he
I did not hear the disturbance. Lizzie
i Riley, another woman of the lower class,
' who occupied the room adjoining that in
j which the murder was committed, says
I that she did not hear the screams. She
; snys that she was awakened by a scuf
fling and that a minute later she heard a
gurgling sound as If some one was chok
ing. She did not venture out of her room
1 until she heard the door of Mrs. C.irpen
: ter's room closed with a bang and as she
got out of bed she heard some one with
| creaking shoes pass along the corridor
toward the stairway leading *o tho street.
I After remaining at her room door for a
I short time she ventured out into the hall
i way, and not seeing any one In sierht. she
! hurried (tin*â to the office to notify the
1 night clerk that she believed there had
i been trouble in the room occupied by
Mrs. Carpenter. Night Clerk Alphonse
; Prieur accompanied her back and rapped
on the door. There was no response. He
then turned his attention to the adiolnlng
room occupied by Yon Lochner and
rapped on thÂ«Â» door. Yon Lochner an
swered and asked what was the matter
I Prleur requested him to get up as he
feared that Mrs. Carpenter was ill or that
something had befallen her.
Yon Lochner stepped Into the hallway
nnd remained there while Prlour went
I back to the office to get the duplicate key
!of tho snap lock on the door of Mrs
I Carpenter's room. They entered together
I and while Prieur was getting a match to
light the gas Yon Lochner stepped to the
side of the bed.
Prieur says that when he struck the
! light Yon Lochner was untying the
double knot, in a piece of shirt waist tied
I around Mrs. Carpenter's throat.
That is the-most damaging piece of evi
dence the police have against Yon Loch
ner.
Chief Lees looks wise and asks how it
j was that Yon Lochner should step to the
i bed and begin untying the knotted piece
of cloth before Prieur struck a light.
! Yon Lochner's reply is that the blinds of
the windows of the room, which face on
Fourth street, were thrown back and that
the rays from an electric light on the op
posite side of the Btreet illuminated the
apartment. Yon Lochner admits that he
1 was in the room about 11 o'clock Satur
day night atid that he assisted Mrs. Car
penter in prc-paring a flaxseed poultice.
When the police arrived the poultice was
on the washstand. This would seem to
indicate that Mrs. Carpenter had a later
visitor and before opening the door threw
oft' the poultice.
Lizzie Riley. who is better known as
"Spanish Lizzie," says that, the scuffling
in the room awoke her. It was then after
1 o'clock. When Prieur and Yon Lochner
entered the room they found Mrs. Carpen
ter in bed. The bed clothing was not dis
turbed in the least and there was no evi
dence of any struggle having taken place
on the bed. The counterpane was drawn
up close under the chin and the right arm
thrown across the chest. The piece of
shirt waist around the throat was evi
dently placed there after Mrs. Carpen
ter's death.
The only reasonable theory, judging
from the stories of the roomers in the
house relative to the scuffling, is that the
unfortunate woman was placed in the bed
after having been strangled on the floor
of the room. The cloth taken from the
throat is soft and flimsy and would have
torn had there been any resistance when
it was being tied.
There is a door leading from the room
occupied by Yon Loehner into the loom
in which the murder was committed. It
has not been locked by key for several
months. There is a screw eye on the door
and another on the jamb of the doorslll,
on the inside of the room occupied by
Mrs. Carpenter. To secure privacy when
she had company Mrs. Carpenter would
drop a curling iron through the two screw
eyes, thus bolting the door and preventing
and intrusion of any one from Yon Locn
ner's room. The curling iron was in piace
when Prieur and Yon Lochner entered the
room.
"Spanish" Lizzie says that Yon Lochner
and the murdered woman had a dispute
about two weeks ago, but that they soon
made it up. Mrs. Carpenter upbraided
him for taking a dollar out of her trunk,
and when he acknowledged that he had
acted wrongly she forgave him.
Mrs. J. O. Anderson, mother of Mrs.
Carpenter, is a strong defender of Yon
Lochner. She arrived here yesterday from
Monterey. She says that she has known
him for years and that he is a friend of
the family. "He was the best friend Sadie
had," said she yesterday, "and I think It
is wrong of the police to keep him under
arrest. lam certain that he knows notn
ing more of the murder than I do."
"Do you suspect any one?" was asked.
"I don't think it would be right for mo
to suspect any one," she replied tearfully,
"but I would like to know where Her hus
band was Saturday night. He treateu
poor Sadie in a shameful way. He marrieu
her last Thanksgiving, believing that she
had piles of money. When he dlscoverea
that he had made a mistake he deserted
her. Oh, how I would like to know whera
he WÂ£s when my poor, unfortunate gin
was murdered."
It is known that Carpenter was here
about ten days ago and that he had an
interview with his wife. The police arÂ»
now ende.avoring to locate him, but pros
ably will not do so unless he volunteers
to call upon Chief Lees.
The dead woman appears to have been
dealing largely in "future husbands."
When her effects were examined Sunday
a letter was found from Sergeant George
Gilligan of Company F. Michigan Volun
teers, stationed at Chickamauga. He
signed himself, "Your future husband."
Another of the "futures" appeared on the
scene yesterday and fell in a fainting fit
when he learned of her death. He next
became hysterical and it was fully an
hour before he could tell his story
"My name is Albert Davis of Company
A. Sixth Regiment, stationed at Alca
traz," said he, between his sobs. "I have
only known Sadie three months," he con
tinued, "and I intended making her my
wife. I am a widower and I felt after a
short acquaintance with her that she
would make a good woman if she had a
good husband. I have given her money
to help her along and only a few week's
ago gave her $60, as she said she was in
need. I bet I could put my hands on the
â  well, I'm not going to accuse any
one. I would like to know, however, Just
where Fred Carstena of Company D of
the Sixth was Saturday night. He was
jealous of me because Sadie showed me
more favors. One night about two weeks
ago she lured him out of the room when
I came in and that made him angry. If
the police are unable to find the mur
derer I will devote the remainder of my
life in a search for him. If I ever find
him I can assure you he will never be
tried."
Carstens denied all knowledge of the
murder, and claims that he was in camp
at Fort Point all of Saturday night.
The report of Autopsy Surgeon Galla
gher ought to completely dissipate the
vision which came from the befogged
brain of Chief Lees, that Mrs. Carpenter
committed suicide.
Dr. Gallagher worked for three hours
on the body yesterday morning to deter
mine the cause of death, but cannot state
definitely whether it was caused by suf
focation or strangulation, but seems rath
er inclined to think it was a little of both
He found marks on the throat over the
windpipe. Underneath the marks the lar
ynx was badly injured and the trachea
was filled with foamy blood. There was
an extravasation of blood below the left
breast and the eyes were congested
In speaking of the case he said: "Judg
ing from appearances I would say that
the woman died from suffocation, caused
either by the flow of air being shut off by
pressure on the windpipe or by something
being placed over the face which would
shut it off from the mouth and nostrils.
3? c . i , nn J ur i es iÂ° the larynx would indicate
that the hoad was thrown well back and
the muscles of the throat drawn tense.
Strangu ation and suffocation produce
practically the same effects on the lungs
so nothing can be drawn from their con
dition. The heart, liver and lungs are all
healthy.
"There are rare cases on record of per
sons strangling themselves, but they are
so Very rare that when a bona fide ense is
discovered it is generally the subject of
discussion at medical societies "
To show the utter absurdity of the sui
cide theory, which emanated originally
from the incompetent Chief of Police, a
Call representative last evening asked a
dozen or more reputable physicians of
this city to give their opinion on the case
of Mrs. Carpenter. This question was put
to the doctors: "Is it possible or prob
able that a weak, fragile, delicate woman,
weighing less than 100 pounds, could
strangle herself with a piece of cloth
wound once around her neck and tied In
a simple hard knot?"
All answered in the negative. The re
plies of only a few of the doctors are
here given, and these only to convince
the public that the senile Chief of Police,
realizing his inability to catch a criminal,
originally desired to show that no crime
was committed. Following are statements
by several physicians:
Dr. Robert A. McLeanâ lt is very un
likely that a woman could kill herself in
the manner you describe. In the first
place, she would not have sufficient
strength to draw the cloth tight enough
around her throat to suspend respiration.
It Is possible for a strong person to
strangle himself, or herself, but it is
quite improbable.
Dr. E. G. O'Connellâ From what I have
read in the papers I am sure that the
Carpenter woman could not have com
mitted suicide. The report of the autopsy
surgeon is conclusive on this point. A
person might produce self-strangulation
by using a small string, which would slip
between the rings of the trachea when
tightened, but this would also cause con
gestion far greater than that found In the
case of Mrs. Carpenter. I do not think "
It possible to produce this effect on one
self. Great pressure must be brought to
bear on the windpipe to produce strangu
lation, and where a rag or a towel in used
more strength is required than the dead
woman seems to have had. As I under
stand her condition, she was slight and
weak, weighing not more than ninety or
ninety-five pounds, and her vitality was
greatly impaired. It would not have
been a difficult task for a man of ordi
nary strength to choke her to death with
a rag, but she could not have done It her
self.
Dr. Fred d'Eve!ynâ The facts in the case
surely indicate a murder. It would have
been a physical impossibility for the wo
man to have strangled herself In the
manner described in the papers. Her vi
tality was very low and she could not
have drawn the towel tightly enough to
have prevented air from reaching her
lungs. The position of the rag and the
knot also bear conclusive evidence that
the force was applied by some person
other than herself. Then, too, the cloth
was too short for her to have got a good
grip on the ends after it was wound
around her neck. The knot being tied in
front does not indicate that she tied it
herself. It is possible that the murderer
choked the woman to death and then tied
the rag on her neck to lead to a theory
tnat she committed suleklo.
Dr. George Tateâ The suicide theory is
ridiculous. I base my oponlon on the
facts as published In the "ipers. The
woman could not have strangled herself.
Another point which the police over
looked in this case was to secure a de
scription of the missing watch which was
taken from the room in which the murder
was committed. Last evening Mrs. An
derson, mother of the deceased, gave Â«.
definite description of the watch to a Call
reporter. It was an old fashioned hunting
case lady's gold watch, key wind, s"lightlÂ£
worn, with a stork on one case, the other
being left plain for a monogram. The im
print of two baby teeth is on the rim.
A Coroner's Jury was impaneled yester
day, and after viewing the body was ex
cused pending the result of the police In
vestigation. The following: Jurors wera
sworn in by Justice Groezingrer as Coro
ner Hawkins Is out of the city: Frank
Bere, F. Schoettler. O. Brewett F J
Flynn, F. A. Lane, Paul Ruegg, H. Petti
nelli, A. Schmuliar, Paul Ottmajt.
THE TIME FIXED.
So far the police have been unable to
locate the hour when Mrs. Carpenter wes
murdered, but last evening a Call man
succeeded in doing so. The woman was
killed between 1:30 and 1:50 a. m.
When Yon Lochner and the night clerk
ascertained that she was dead both left
her room. Prieur, the cler.*., went after
an officer, and Yon Lochner went to the
Bellevue saloon on the corner oi Fourth
and Minna streets. Yon Lochner told the
bartender that Mrs. Carpenter had been
murdered. The bartender looked up at
the clock and the hands pointed to 1:50
In the statement made by Lizzie Rlley
Yon Lochner. Special Officer Gilfoy and
the night clerk, all guessed the time be
tween 1 and 2 a, m. They did not know
exactly. Dennis Linehan, who rooms In
the Hubbard house, and who goes to work
very early In the morning, was called at 1
o'clock. He came down stairs at 1:10.
At that time the halls were deserted and
all was quiet In the house. The occupant
of room 4 retired shortly after 1 o'clock.
He heard no noise when he went to his
room or arterward.
