these women were not concerned In the
crime that brought death to his wife, and

Judge Cook relents.
The trial of Mrs. Botkin yesterday â  a?
practically without a striking: incident.
Dunning appeared and had been
remand.-d to the custody of the Sheriff
the proceedings drifted into a heavy,
dreary presentation of dry facts. The
Ution was engaged in presenting
its last proof of Mrs. Botkln's alleged
nnd In gathering the odds arid . nda
- lons and complicated case. Mrs.
Louise Beeley, the sharer of Dun
ning's cheap hospitality and a partici
pant In the shameful orgies that diseraced
&27 Geary street, took the stand to tell
â what she knew of the relations between
Punning and Mrs. Botkin.
Mrs. Seeley was frank. She told what
she knew, but the information added
nothing except a confession of immor
ality to the story that had already been
to the jury. Attorney Knipht
attempted and succeeded in showing that
Mrs. Seeley is nut a friend of Mrs. Bot
kin, and Is more than a friend of
Bon. While Mrs. Seeley was on the wit
itand Mrs. Eotkin watched her close
ly and critically. The accused woman
came to court yesterday heavily veiled
to avoid t he Ftare of the morbid audi
and the criti, ism of interested ob
servers. Mrs. Seeley'a testimony was sim
â irative of the fact that Dun
ning and Mrs. Botkin lived a life that
1 them beyond the pale of decent
people. There was nothing- in the woman's
testimony to support the allegation of
â¢ . Mrs. Botkin was
jealous to the point that suggested mur
der.
t imnny was also offered to show that
Mrs. Botkin was well known as a custom
er of the City nf Paris. The prosecutors
had evidently reviewed their own case
and determined to leave not the slL
point untouched. Knight had insinuated
that a servant might have won a terrible
revenge in the rvnnington household by
poisoning its inmates. This insinuation
â was met by evidence that showed that the
Penningtons had never quarreled with the
servants in th.-ir service and there could
be no motive for the crime that brought
d^ath and desolation to the Dover home.
Much of the morning session yesterday
â was occupied with such evidence, material
from the necessity of establishing an ab
solute proof, but uninteresting in a gen
eral sense.
After the odds and ends had been gath
ered together the prosecution began the
presentation of Its :ast phase of evidence,
the .xpert testimony on handwriting. Two
experts w> â

John P. Dunning occupied a seat in
court when i>r. â  â¢ â¢gt commenced in the
morning. Ml I was apparently
â  to call another witness when Judge
asked, "V . Dunning? Let him
take the stand." Th<- r.-'alcitrant witness

Turning: to Mr. :. "Do you

"I Insist." was the laconic response.
"Mr. Dunning, ;: :ns-,.-ts upon
his question," said the court. "Are you
ready at this time to answer it?"
"No. sir!" said Dunning, "but I would
make a brief statement."
"We don't want any statement." said
Knight. "We want an answer to that

my own mind that not one of th^m ia in

Judge Cook hesitated a moment and
said: "I am afraid that Is not a leglti

mate excuse for refusing to answer the
question.
"If your Honor please, 1 ' said Attorney
Hosmer rising. "I insist that this cross
examination of the witness is going too
far. These matters were not brought out
on uir-ct examination and it is practically
carrying the cress-, lamination into a de
fense rather than its proper channel. I
hold it is not proper to compel the wit
ness to answer. The naming of Indi
viduals should not be required."
"There is a direct attack upon the

"T,his man is permitted to blacken the
character of the defendant merely be
cause the prosecution wants a motive. If
he is allowed to show his conduct with
Mrs. Botkin why not his conduct with
U/EIGHING A HUMAN LIF^E IN THE BALANCE WITH AN EXPERT'S OPINION.
Experts on Handwriting Consumed a Great Deal of Time Yesterday In the Trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. Two
Experts lA/ere Placed on the lA/itness-Stand toy the Prosecution, and Both Attempted to Convince the?
Jury That the Accused \A/oman lA/rote the Anonymous Letters and Addressed the Package of Poisoned
Candy. The Testimony Was Highly Technical and lA/as Still in Progress When Court Adjourned for
the Day.
other women? We insist upon the ques
tion."
Judp. Cook said the witness was there
t > â¢ establish facts. "His acts with de
:;t show motive and it is proper
cross-examination to show his relations
with other women, it is not the witness'
part to decide whether this is material or
not. I think the answer is necessary if
the counsel insists."
Mr. Hosmer saw a way out of the di
lemma and ;;sk<ii. "Is your refusal to an
swer based on the ground that you might
incriminate yourself?"
Knight objected to this, saying a wit
ness might take advantage of thu pi<>a
himself, but that it could not be brought
out by an attorney.
"That is st.." said Judge Cook. "He la
in contempt until the question is an
swered. Mr. Dunning, you will stand
committed until you consent to answer
the questions put to you. ('all the next
witness, Mr. Hosmer.'
Dunning having been taken from the
courtroqjn, Julian Fay, treasurer of the
City of Paris, was called. After a few
questions it developed that he was not
the man who could give the information
regarding cashing of postal orders which
Mr. Hosmer desired. He was excused.
Professor Wolf, chemist, nf Delaware,
was recalled to say that there was no
difference In the poisonous qualities of
crystalline and amorphous arsenic. Both
were deadly.
Harry Pennington was recalled. Dur
â  ing his cross-examination Attorney Hos
j mer objected to a question regarding
trouble between the servants of Mr.
Pennington and that gentleman. Mr.
Hopmer withdrew the objection and de
eired Mr. Knight to ask it again. Mr.
Knipht affirmed he had no desire to do
i so, whereupon Mr. Hosmer proceeded to
propound it to the witness. The attorney
fur the defense objected to this, and the
objection was sustained. Judge Cook hold
I that unless Mr. Knight asked the question
no one else could do so. The witness left
the stand without disclosing the lnforma-
Uon he possessed.
Mrs. Louisa L. Seeley next took the
stand. She testified that she knew Mrs
Botkin and Mr. Dunning, having met
them at 927 Geary street in the early part
of ISD7. The witness had seen Dunning in
Mrs. Botkin's room and that their manner
toward one another was very friendly.
The three of them went out together fre
quently. Asked if she had ever written
to Mrs. Dunning, she said: "No. sir. I
; flatly deny that I have ever written any
thing of the kind."
She was shown the anonymous letters
and asked if she had written them. She

â was positive In her declaration that she
had not. She was shown In turn all the
writing, and denied having touched it.
She also denied having bought chocolate
candy and shipping it to Dover.
To Mr. Knightâ She was a widow, and
met Dunning at Mrs. Botkin's house,
Geary street, in the latter part of 1896.
Her presence there was due to an invi
tation to spend a social evening. The
party was usually composed of Mrs. Bot
kin, Dunning, Beverly Botkin and herself.
She had been to the races on several oc
casions with Dunning and Mr?. Botkin.
but never alone with Dunning-. They had
pune to cafes and restaurants, where they
had dined. This took place two or three
times, where she could not recall. Asked
if she felt friendly toward Mrs. Botkin,
she said: "I haven't such a terrible ill
feeling against her."
Knight: "Have you any ill feeling
against her?"
"I don't care for her, although we never
had any words."
Knight: "She objected to your going
with her son, Beverly?"
"She never did. I was friendly with
Beverly, and I am still."
Knight: "How did you address Dun
ning?"
"I always called him Mr. Dunning. He
was a gentleman."
"How did you address her son?"
"I called him Beverly."
Knight: "He wasn't a gentleman?"
"Oh, yes; but 1 looked upon him as a
boy in comparison with Mr. Dunning."
"Didn't Mrs. Botkin object to your asso
ciation with Beverly because you wanted
to marry him?"
"1 was not going to marry Beverly. I
had no matrimonial ideas regarding him.
He was but little over 20 years, and I al
ways treated him as a boy and a friend."
Mr. Knight was about to go deeper into
the relations of Mrs. Seeley and Beverly,
the stepson of Mrs. Botkin, when Air.
Hosmer objected strenuously. Before he
could give voice to all his reasons Knight
said quickly, "Withdraw the question,
withdraw the question. No further pues
tions." This ended what gave promise of
being further exploitation of the glamour
less vice that was rampant at 927 Geary
street.
At this point J. B. Pennington was re
called. Apparently the purpose of It was
to show that he alone knew that three
anonymous letters had been received in
Dover, addressed to Mrs. Dunning. It had
previously been shown that Mrs. Botkin
had at various times spoken of three let
ters, hence the inference that she was
the author of them. Mr. Pennington said
he received the third letter and placed it
with private papers In his office desk,
when it remained until after the death
of Mrs. Dunning. He had not delivered
it to her, as she did not wish to see any
more letters in that handwriting. No one
knew he had it, he said, except the writer
and such persons as she might shown it
to.
Detective Gibson testified that Mrs. Bot
kin told him voluntarily she went to the
ferry in this city and thence to St. Helena
August 4. The arsenic-laden package
should have been mailed in this city on
that date to have reached Delaware on
the day It did.
Daniel T. Ames of New York was the
first expert on handwriting called by the
prosecution. He gave his occupation as
that of artist, editor and examiner of
handwriting. Attorney Hosmer asked a
number of questions to show the wit
ness' qualifications as an expert. Mr.
Knight broke in with: "We admit he
will qualify as an expert. Now let's get
down to it." The witness was shown ex
amples of Mrs. Botkin's handwriting ad
mitted by her to be genuine. "With these
b.3 was shown the wrapper which was
around the box of arsenic-laden choco
lates; the note in the box, and the anony
mous letters, both ink and pencil.
He was asked if after comparing the va
rious specimens in evidence he could
state whether or not they were in tne
same handwriting.
He said he could, and was asked to ex
plain to the jury how he secured the facts.
To this Knight objected, saying it was
not how he obtained his facts, but the
facts themselves.
The witness then went on to state ti.at
he found in the wrapper the writing care
fully disguised, but that it still compared
with the personality of the writing in the
samples in evidence. Knight objected
strongly to the witness' method of ex
plaining to the jury his deductions, say
ing: "He can't throw into this jury his
opinions." He asked the court to in
struct the witness, who was no novice,
and should know the lines on which he
could present the result of his investiga
tions.
Judge Cook told the expert to point out
facts on which his opinion is based, and
not the inference he had drawn from
them.
The witness went on to say: "I -call
your attention to the capital 'P' In the
wrapper. It is peculiar in construction."
This was stricken out as being an opin
ion, not a fact.
He said the "p" in the Price letter and
on the wrapper were identical and that the
same "p" occurs In the ink anonymous
letter in the fourth line, second page. Il
also appeared in the pencil letter. Th'Â«
witness drew attention to a similarity h<!
twecn it and a letter in "the note that -ivas
In the box."
Knight (savagely)â Strike that out. He
don't know whether the note was in a dry
goods box or in a candy box.
The attorney with Senatorial aspirations
does not like experts, having a keen re
membrance of the Fair will trial. In an
aside to Senator McGowan he said: "This
expert testimony is dying of slow poi
son."
Expert Ames took up the note In the
candy box, "With love to yourself and
baby. Mrs. C," and dissected it slowly,
letter by letter. His usual formula was
to select a single letter in the note and
then rummage through all the letters
of Mrs. Botkin. "I take this T In the
note," he would say, "and place it in jux
taposition with these various 'W's' In
these letters." The jurymen went at it
in a painstaking manner, discussing what
was placed before them. This was
finally objected to by counsel for Mrs.
Botkin. Judge Cook then admonished
them that they must not discuss among
themselves what was shown them, but
to reserve it for their deliberations in the
jury room. After that the expert placed
the results of his work on the rail of the
jury box and the jurors in twos and
threes examined the exhibits.
The work was painfully slow and the
throng in the court room thinned out
gradually until when time for adjourn
ment at noon arrived hardly a corporal's
guard remained.
The expert showed the "th" in the word
"with" of the note and the same letters
in "that" In one of Mrs. Botkln's letters.
He took the word "your" in the note and
placed It alongside the same word found
in various places in the Price letter and
also in both the ink and the pencil anony
mous letters.
Upon the opening of court in the after
noon Felix Raynaud, cashier of the City
of Paris, was called. He testified to hav
ing frequently cashed postal money or
ders for Mrs. Botkin. He identified an
order which he cashed on June 4, about
the time Mrs. Botkin is supposed to have
purchased the handkerchief. He did not
know her as a purchasing agent, he said
to Mr. Knight. To him he also volun
teered the information that a purchas
ing agent was one who buys for another
person and gets a discount for the work
done.
W. W. Barnes was recalled and testi
fied to Nixon, the night watchman, taking
two strangers to the Victoria Hotel.
These men were placed in the room once
occupied by Mrs. Botkin and in which
was found the bit of a seal used In Haas 1
candy store. Expert Ames then took the
stand and continued his droning descrip
tion of curves and dashes.
"I would call attention to the use of the
Greek 'E' or capital 'E' which is used
in her writing and in the word Dover on
the superscription on the wrapper," he
said. "I also draw your attention to the
quotation marks in the note and in her
writing. They appear in the Price letter
and in three instances elsewhere. Note
its marked peculiarities."
To Mr. Hosmer he said the anonymous
letters were not written in a natural
hand, although certain characteristics ran
throughout it. These were the hard pres
sure and the joining and proportioning
of letters. In the word "yours" where the
"o" finishes there is a peculiar point
going up to join the next letter instead of
going down, as natural. This Is a char
acteristic of the writer. The expert stated
that the writing in the note was not nat
ural. It was carefully disguised in the
slope of the writing and in the delibera
tion of the writer. It was drawn, not
written. The writing on the wrapper is
In a feigned hand, according to Mr. Ames.
This is shown in the deliberation of the
lines and the contradictions in the slope
of the letters. In the "Mrs." there is a
back slant. The "p" is direct while the
"J" is Indirect.
Knight to expertâ "You have gone about
as farâ we object to any more." This had
th<> effect of stopping the expert from
pointing out the differences he found in
the writing. After examining all the
known writing of Mrs. Botkin and of that
on the wrapper and in the anonymous
letters, the expert said: "There can be
no doubt whatever but that all were in
the same handwriting."
To Mr. Knight the expert said he could
not be mistaken in his deductions. He
was asked about an Eastern case where
an attorney wrote an address and he
identified it as the work of another. He
squirmed out of this dilemma only to face
a series of questions as to the compensa
tion he expected for his services. It de
veloped that his fee was $100 a day, but
he had no agreement as to what he was
to receive in this case. Mr. Hosmer had
promised him reasonable compensation.
He said he had no difficulty in arriving
at the conclusion that all the exemplars
were in the same handwriting. He could
hardly be more certain if he had seen
the work done. Mr. Knight asked him if
he had seen a letter written by Mrs. Bot
kin to Dunning at Porto Rico and inter
cepted there. Mr. Hosmer objected to a
series of 'questions on that line, and
Knight said he would ask Chief Lees the
question.
Hosmer: "You won't find any such
letter."
Knight: "It was there."
Hosmer: "It was not."
Knight: "It was there."
Hosmer: "It was not."
This snappish dialogue might have been
continued indefinitely had not Judge Cook
put an end to it. Knight then became
jocose at the cleverness shown by the ex
pert in extricating himself from tight
corners. Hosmer protested at the levity
displayed, declaring that Knight was not
following the rules of evidence.
Mrs. Price, the landlady of the Victoria
Hotel, was recalled to answer a question
propounded by Juror Hey man. It was
whether Mrs. Botkin went at once to her
room the Sunday afternoon she came in
with certain packages. The witness said
she did.
Carl Eisenschimmel, handwriting expert,
was the last witness of the day. He had
not concluded his testimony when the
hour for adjournment arrived. He spoke
of "muscular recoil," "muscular co-ordi
nation" and on other matters with which
only experts are on terms of intimacy.
MR. LONG
WILL LEAVE
THE CABINET
Has Not Yet Apprised the
President of His Inten
tion to Resign.
Secretary Bliss Will Go Out Also
and Slates for the Succession
Are in Order.
Call Office, Riggs House,

It is not unlikely President
McKinley will entirely recast his
Cabinet at the beginning of the
new year. It is stated to-night

on absolutely responsible author
ity that Secretary Long has sent
in his resignation, to take effect
when the President finds a suc
cessor.
Long's reasons for leaving the
Navy Department are entirely;
personal. He is separated too
much from his family and has
never cared for Washington life.
While deeply interested in the
work of the Naval Department,
he dislikes the social features of
official life in Washington, and
with the restoration of peace sees
an opportunity to return to pri
vate life, with all it means to him
self and family.
The health of his wife, how
ever, is the chief cause for his de
termination to relinquish an of
fice to which he devoted much
wearisome toil during the late
war. Mrs. Long and her young
son have been at their home in
Massachusetts most of the time
since^Secretary Long came into
the Cabinet. This enforced sep
aration has not been agreeable to
the Secretary, and, having con
ducted the administration of the
Navy Department to the full
satisfaction of the President and
the country, he feels that he is
entitled to release from its man
agement and can now yield to his
successor the conduct of the or
dinary routine.
Mr. Long, being a man of con
siderable means and a member of
one of the most successful law
firms of Boston, is not dependent
upon the salary he now receives.
For all of these reasons he will
signify to the President his ear
nest desire that his successor be
named as early as is convenient.
His proposed retirement will
doubtless be strenuously opposed
by the President, who relies upon
Mr. Long's wise and conserva
tive counsel in Cabinet confer2
NEW STRIKE IN THE
ATLIN GOLD FIELD
Prospects on Discovery Claim
Yield a Return of Sixty
Cents to the Pan.
VICTORIA, B. i.. Dec. 20.â J. E. Moran, a prospector of no
small experience, has just reached this city from the Atlin gold
fields. He brings news of a new strike, the gold going 60 cents to the
pan, having been made on the O'Ponnell, a feeder of Lake Atlin,
from the south. Dr. H. D. O'Donnell has Discovery, which promises
to equal anything in the district.
Moran reached the Atlin country on August 10, with the first
stampede, and his Impression of the new diggings in most roseate. He
thinks they will equal, if not surpass, any placer mining camp of the
renlury. They have many advantages. The entire district is cut up
by dozens of small streams, almost every one of which has been
found to be gold-bearing! It is easy of access, the winter trail re
quirin- only five days from Skaguay, and the summer route about
thrre. The creeks are small and easily handled. Bedrock Is, in gen
eral, near the surface. Timber is plentiful, the working season long,
the country not diflicult to travel or prospect in and the climate
perfect.
Moran says if half the claims already staked in this district are
open next summer there will be work for 3000 men. Of those which
have already been worked he has not learned of a single one proving
unprofitable. Pin- 1 ami Spruce Creeks have; turned out remarkably
well. Wright Creek is already famous, though 'iscovery claim alone
has been developed, and the same may be said of Otter, Boulder,
Birch, McKee and many others, on each of which but one or two
claims have been opened.
There is no mining this winter. About 300 people are wintering
in Atlin. All are confident that next season will be a prosperous one.
Every one is busy now building cabins and preparing for next year's
\v,.ik. Provisions are rather dear; bacon, 40 cc.its a pound; sugar,

ences, and it is well known that j
there is a strong' personal attach
ment between them of many
years' standing. This friendship
dates from their service in Con
gress together, where they sat
side by side.
The President is to-night un
aware of Secretary Long's deter
mination to resign, but there is
no doubt of his intention.
If Secretary Long's resigna
tion is accepted there is no doubt
that his successor will be Assist
ant Secretary Allen of Massachu

to-day tendered his resignation
to the president, to take effect;
January i. The Secretary so 1
announced to his friends this;
afternoon. He has no official
knowledge of his probable suc
cessor.
Secretary Rliss said to-night:
"I have nothing to say. While
my friends know what my pur
pose is, I have not said what I in
tend to do to others.
"After I see the President per
haps I will have something to
say. The story of my resignation
coming out as it did was a great
surprise to me. I have abso
lutely refused to talk for publica
tion. When Tarn ready to talk it
may be very freely and willingly."
There was considerable talk
around the department to-day of
the probable successor to Secre
tary P.liss. Several prominent
politicians, in discussing the mat
ter, said the choice for the port
folio of the Interior Department
was between Commissioner Her
mann of the General Land office
and Commissioner Evans of the
Pension Bureau. Mr. Her
mann's friends point with pride
to his great record at the head of!
the General Land Office, and ex
press themselves as satisfied he
would make a most acceptable
Secretary. He is, furthermore,
from the Pacific Coast section,
which, with the exception of
Judge McKenna, has not had a
representative in the Cabinet for
some years.

and many mines using water as motive
power had to shut down or run short
handed. The loss in this connection the
last two months is estimated at $100,000.
The town of Forest Hill, the center of
the mining region, has been in need of
water even for drinking purposes and a
few weeks ago during a fire in that
place giant powder was resorted to to
save the entire town from destruction
Never In its history has the mining
section suffered so for wafer, and never
was the outlook brighter for a large
output of gold in 1899, if backed up by
a hard winter.
SUISUN. Dec. 20.â The heavy precip
itation of the present storm, following
so closely the much needed rainfall last
week, has dispelled fear of another dry
year. Throughout Solano County the
outlook has entirely changed since the
dry spell was broken, and a marked
increase in business is the result. The
rainfall during the past forty-eight
hours was 1.30 inches. Clouds still hang
over Suisun, and a heavy downpour to
night is expected.
WATSONVILLE, Dec. 20.â During
the last forty-eight hours the Fajaro
Valley has been visited by a welcome
downpour. Up to this evening the fall
was one inch, with the prospects good
for more.
HAYWARDS, Dec. 20.â Fully an inch
of rain has fallen since 4 a. m.. making
a total of 4.22 for the season. The pros
pects ari? good for more rain.
HOLLISTER, Dec. 20.â The precipita
tion up to 6 o'clock this evening was
1.10 inches. It rained all day. and the
indications are for a continuance to
night.
WdODI.AND, Dec. 20.â The Weather
Bureau's forecast of fair weather to
day w.as evidently tlv* rosult of a mis
calculation. Rain began to fall at 2
o'clock this morning and continued at
intervals throughout the day. The pre
cipitation is light and at the present
rate it may shower for a week without
flooding the low lands. The prediction
is made by those who have studied the
seasons closely in this county that there
will be an abundance of rain before
the weathpr clears.
STOCKTON, Dec. 20.â The rainfall
here for the storm measured .94 of an
inch, making for the month 1.50 inches
and for the season 3.29, against 3.07 last
year. The indications are for more
rain, but enough has fallen for the
present and farmers who have not put
in crop? can do so as soon as the
weather settle*. It will be a merry
Christmas for the farmers here
abouts. The crops having been failures
the past two seasons, and the lands
having rested, farmers predict an enor
mous yield the next crop, and with the
usual spring rains to fall nothing can
prevent a fine season.
FRESNO, Dec. 20.â Rain began to
fall here at fi oUtlock this evening and
up to nbidnight there have been several
small showers. Indications are thot
there will be a heavy downpour to
morrow. Grain in many parts of the
county is badly In need of rain, hav
inf suffered materially of late on ac
count of the severe frosts. Many of the
farmers, fearinÃ another dry year, have
ceased plowing, A heavy rain at this
time would give work to many idle men
and â¦earns.
PAN JOSE. Deo. 20.â The rain which
began to fail last night has continued
with slight intervals through the day
and evening, making a total for the
storm of .45 of fin inoV" q n( i for the sea
son of 141 Inches. More rain Is ex
p ctcd. Green ,?rass is already show

GOMPERS IS YET
THE PRESIDENT
Remains^ Leader of the
Labor Federation.
ONLY ONE ADVERSE VOTE
SOCIALIST COWAN ENTEBS AN
OBJECTION.
All the Officers Except the Fourth,
Fifth and Sixth Vice Presi
dents Keep Their
Places.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 20.âSam
uel Gompers was to-day re-elected
president of the American Federation
of Labor by practically a unanimous
vote in the closing session of the eight
eenth annual convention of that organ
ization. The convention, which had
been in session for eight days, ad
journed Bine die at 6 o'clock. Detroit,
I Mich., was decided upon as the next
| place of meeting.
During the election of president Wll
â¢ Ham J. O'Brien of New York was in the
! chair. George E. McNeil of Boston
! placed Gompers in nomination. He
â  said he might never again attend a
convention of the federation, and he
wanted the honor of naming Gompers â 
for the place. He said: "Mr. Gompers i
' has been tried and found true. He can
i not be corrupted. When we get a good
man in a piace we should keep him
I there."
The greatest applause followed Me-
Neill's remarks.
John Kirby of Ouray, Colo., said the
miners of the West were looking more
to Gompers to aid them in their strug
gles than any one else.
There were no other nominees, and
Henry Lloyd of Massachusetts moved
that the vote of the convention be cast
for Gompers. This was done amid
great cheering. Isaac Cowan, the so
i cialist, of Cleveland, objected, and his
vote was recorded against Gompers.
Oompers declined to make any remarks
upon hiÃ re-election.
With the exception of the fourth, fifth
and sixth vice presidents, and the three
fraternal delegates, the rest of the old
officers were re-elected without oppo
sition. The remainder of the ticket fol
, lows :
First vice president, P. J. McGuire,
Philadelphia; second vice president,
James Duncan, Baltimore; third vice
president, James O'Connell. Chicago;
fourth vice president, John F. Mitchell, â 
Indianapolis; fifth vice president. Max '
Morris, Denver; sixth vice president,
Thomas I. Kldd. Chicago; secretary,
Frank Morrison, Chicago; treasurer,
j John B. Lennon, Bloomington, 111.; fra
! ternal delegates to the Union Congress
| of Great Britain. Thomas F. Tracey of
New York (Cigarmakers' Union), and
James O'Connell (Machinists' Union);
i to the Trade and Labor Convention of
: Canada, Jams F. O'Sullivan of Boston
of the Massachusetts State branch.
The convention spent most of the day
in amending its constitution and pro
. viding means for widening the scope of
its work. The federation increased the
per capita tax upon memb.-rs of trades
union organizations from three-fourths
I of 1 cent to 5 cents per month, the mon
ey to be used to support the federation.
, President Gompers himself objected to
this, but the delegates were strongly in
I favor of it. On every hand they de
; clared that an increased avenue war
: needed to carry on the work of organ
' ization so as to strengthen the labor
cause.
The resolution of J. F. O'Sullivan of
Boston, looking to a bill in Congress to
I impose an internal revenue tax against
! all factories employing women and
I children over time, was killed. The
J committee on laws reported against the
measure on the ground that it would
legalize the employment of children as
laborers. In support of his resolution,
O'Sullivan said that he had been be
fore the Legislature of Massachusetts
1 when lawyers argued that such a tax
was constitutional, and that it was gen
erally agreed that the only way to stop
factory keepers from hiring children
was to tax them out of existence.
O'Sullivan proposed that such factories
be made to pay an internal revenue tax
of 50 per cent on their gross receipts.
George E. McNeill said he had some
doubts as to the efficacy -of such a law.
"And further," said he, "it will simply
license the employment of children.
We will be put in the light of recog
nizing what we know to be an evil."
O'Sullivan said he believed that the
employment of children could never be
checked until the women workers of
the land identified themselves with the
trades unions. He was certain, too,
that women would never receive equal
pay with men until they showed a
strength united enough to force it upon
their employers.
Isaac Cowan's resolution, asking that
the discussion by affiliated unions of
the King-Blanchford and Eyer plans of
official federation be recommended by
the American Federation, was killed
without discussion, and a number of
measures not of general interest were
disposed of. â 
Before adjourning the convention dis
tened to farewell addresses by the
British delegates, William Inskip and
William Thorn.
COURT OF CASSATION HAS
THE SECRET DOSSIER
Discussion of the Dreyfus Case
Causes Commotion in the Cham
ber and Senate.
PARIS, Dec. 20.â The Courriere dv Soir
says this evening: The Dreyfus secret
dossier was handed to the Court of Cas
sation this evening under the pledge that
it should not be communicated to the
counsel for the defense or to any one out
side the court.
The Chamber of Deputies indulged in.
another Dreyfus debate to-day. Joseph
Fournier, Socialist deputy for Aisne,
moved a resolution conferring the fran
chise upon soldiers and demanded urgency
for it. He then proceeded to expound his
views, which provoked a great uproar.
The Premier, M. Dupuy, replied: "I
should have thought that the Dreyfus af
fair had already done the country enough
harm. M. Fournier's new proposal would
be most pernicious. The country wants
and has a devoted army to safeguard her
independence and we do not wish to give
its officers the means of descending to
the forum. We must rally round the
army."
The motion for urgency was then de
feated by 477 votes against 2*>.
In the Senate a stormy discussion took
Flace over a bill increasing the penalties
or espionage and treason. There were
frequent references to Dreyfus.
Eventually the bill, which prescribes
death for state officials who are guitly
of treason in time of peace, was adopted.

To the Senate of the United States: I, Liliuo

spectfully protest against the assertion of own
ership hy the United States of America of the
so-called Hawaiian crown lands, amounting to
ahout 1,000,000 acres, and which are my prop

other compensation.
Further supplementing my protest of June
17, 1897. I call upon the President and the na
tional Legislature and the people of the United

of my right and title.

EXTORTED MONEY
FROM MERCHANTS
Swindler Sexton Wanted
at Placerville.
WORKED A CLEVER DODGE
PASSED FOR A GOVERNMENT
DETECTIVE.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Doc. 20.â John E.
Sexton, a confidence operator, who. to
use a gilded figure of speech, once sold
President Cleveland a gold brick, has
been taken from the County Jail here
to answer an indictment brought by
the Grand Jury of El Dorado County,
charging him with extortion. Sexton
showed up in Placerville some weeks
ago and induced a woman to enter a
cigar store and purchase a box of
cheap cigars. Acting upon Sexton's
instructions, the woman prevailed on
the cigar dealer to transfer the cheao
cigars into a high grade cigar box. and
then she reported to Sexton with her
purchase.
Sexton remained in seclusion a- fi w
days and then made his appearance it
the cigar store, introducing himself is
a Government detective. He stated
that he had secured positive evidence
that the cigar dealer had violated ohe
of the revenue laws by transferring
cigars from one box to another. The
dealer grew pale, and when Sext-in
offered to compromise for a certain
sum of money he readily "pungled."
The merchant was so "easy" that
Sexton bethought himself of another
official who would have to be coo
ciliated, and again the cigar dealer dug
down into his trousers and paid trib
ute. After a time the dealer realized
that he had been defruded. and Sex
ton's indictment by the Grand Jury
and arrest in this city followed.
The Placerville cigar merchant has
the consolation of beine in distin- |
guished company, for a fellow victim
is no less a personage that ex-Presi
dent Cleveland. Sexton three or four
years after having served a term in
the San Francisco House of Correc
tion appeared in Washington. D. C.
and worked a sort of a "pull" for an
appointment to a Government pori
tion in Alaska. President Cleveland ,
had signed his commission when Sex- i
ton's unsavory record was disclosed to
him, and the commission was revoked.
Sexton by pretending to be a confiden
tial secretary to Senator S. M. White
had gained access to the White House,
and he was actually in consultation
with President Cleveland about politi
cal matters in California when Max
Popper, who was then in Washington,
exposed hi* character.

POLICEMEN MUST
DONATE SERVICES
Result of Boss Rule in
San Jose.
DEPARTMENT WITHOUT FUNDS
FIREMEN IN EVEN A WORSE
PREDICAMENT.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 20.â There is a short
age of funds in the police and fire de
partments of this city. As the depart
ments are now conducted the policemen
will have to work next June for noth
ing and the firemen must donate six
weeks of their time. The situation waa
considered at a meeting of the Police
and Fire Commissioners this afternoon,
who concluded this was the only way
out of the dilemma save the cutting of
salaries.
Mayor Martin presented a message in
which the commissioners were advised
to practice economy in the police de
partment. He said he suggested econ
omy when they took their seats and
asked that the police force be limited
to fourteen. Instead eighteen were
elected, making a difference of $3600 a
year. A couple of vacancies will occur
at the end of the month and he asked
that they not be filled, so that police
men could be paid in full for their
services.
If the recommendation of Mayor Mar
tin is carried out some political com
plications will arise. R. J. Langforu,
whose election as Sheriff is being con
tested, appointed Policemen Robert
Anderson and V. L. Baehe deputies
with the understanding that the com
missioners would make his brother, F.
S. La*igford, a policeman. Langford
filed his petition for the appointment
to-day. It is not believed the vacancies
will be filled in the face oi the Mayor's
recommendation and the shortage of
finances, and Sheriff Langford will hava
been bunkoed in the trade.
While the police have agreed to work
a month for nothing, if necessary,
rather than have their salaries cut. the
firemen are grumbling. They have
suggested that each company be laid
off for a month and they be given an
opportunity to work at something else
rather than donate their services for
six weeks. They also object to signing 1
an agreement relinquishinr all claim to
pay for thiÂ»t period, if at some future
time funds should be available.

WORK OF RELIEF
WELL UNDER WAY
Money Advanced by Claus Spreckels
Being Utilized to Aid Those
in Want.
James D. PhÂ»lan, Mayor of San
Francisco; F. W. Dohrmann of the
Merchants 1 Association, and A. B.
president of the State Board
of Agriculture, met as a relief commis
rday afternoon at the Palace
Hotefl. These gentlemen were appoint
ed by Governor Budd to supervise the
disbui at of $25,000 advanced by
Claus Spreckels for the relief of fann
y and San Luis Obispo
counties. The Governor at once turned
over to the commission a check from
Claus Spi â¢ : $25,000.
The commission organized by elect
ing F. W. Dohrmann chairman. A. B.
Spre> h surer -"<i L. M. King, su
perintendent, of the Merchants' Associa
tion, secretary.
The treasurer was authorized to de
posit the chuck to the credit of the re
oomznission at the Bank of Cali
fornia. Checks on t he- fund are to be
signed by the chairman and the treas
urer of the commission.
<"halrman Dohrmann offered on be
half of the Merchants' Association the
services of its officers and attaches
without charge to the commission,
which offer was accei
It was resolved that Secretary King

were directed to start for King City
:.n Friday morning.
It was r^polvd that the secretary of

assistance. The secretary is to report
on blanks to be prepared for that pur
pose any further applications for as
sistance or advance of necessities or
feed or seed, such applications to be
considered and acted upon by the com
mission.
It was further resolved to purchase
four car loads of alfalfa hay for the
immediate relief of the suffering live
stock in the distressed district. It was
directed that this hay be distributed
immediately by the secretary after con
ferring with Messrs. Melander and
Besse.
A. B. Spreekels ws pur
i chase the four car loads of hay and ship
I immediately, subject to the secretary's
I orders, to Kings >'ity.
A. B. Sprecktis. who recently return
ed from the destitute district, explain
ed that the most urgt-nt demand was
for hay for horses and cows. He re
marked that early in the season the
farmers of the Pajaro Valley had sent
in supplies â¢ : I od for the destitute
families in the vicinity of Kings City
and that further supplies of bacon, flour
and beans could be readily sent to the
people who were in actual need of food.
His observations convinced him that
the greatest need was sustenance for
the live stock. H.Â» noted while driving
through the district that the cows were
so weak that they could not get out of
the way of teams. Many of the far
mers were dependent upon their horses
to put in another crop: therefore, it
was essential that the horses should be
provided with hay in order to give
them strength to work.
The farmers who went to that region
at tho instance of Mr. Spreckels d
need hay for their live stock, as ample
quantities have been supplied by A. B.
Spr-'ckels from time To time. The big
men in the live stock business can bor
row money from the harks to buy feed,
so that a vast quantity of hay will not
be required. Thp leading merchants
at Kings City have a list of th.- desti
tute and know the families actually in
need rf immediate help.
H. E. Eppinger, president of the Pro
duce Exchange, r ceived day before
yesterday a letter from A. M. Lawrence
asking the exchange to contribute
money to enable the Examiner to send
car loads of barley and ha-- to the des
titute farmers. When the board con
vened yesterday morninsr the letter was
read and the subject brought before the
exchange. F. H. Wheelan. vice presi
dent of the Southern Pacific Milling
Company, said that the distress was
not as great as reports represented it to
be. He called the attention of the mem
bers to the fact that the State was able
t.> render all the assistance necessa-v
as Claus Spreckels had placed in the
hands of the Governor a check for (25 -
000. which amount was ample for "all
purposes of reHef. The mention of
1. lavs Spreckels 1 name elicited anplause
from the members. The soliciting let
ter from Mr. Lawrence did not receive
further attention, as the membprs of
the Produce Exchange considered that
the subject of providing relief for the
destitute was in the hands of a respon
sible commission appointed by the
Governor of the State.
TO PROMOTE A WAR
AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS
Meeting at Marlborough House, at
Which the Prince of Wales
Presided.
LONDON*. Dec. 20. - The Prince of
Waifs presided at a private meeting at
Marlborough Hou.se to-day, convened i,y
him to promote a war against tubercu
1' 'SIS.
The Marquis of Salisbury, the Earl of
Rosebory and a number of noted scien
tistfl and physicians spoke of the urgent
necessity of educating the people in the
means of preventing consumption and
checking the spread of tuberculosis
diseases among cattle. Special stress was
laid upon the importance of erecting open
uir sanitaria.
The Prince of Wales, who promised his
heartiest support to the movement said
Great Britain ou^ht to follow the g-ood
example set before her in the United
States, Germany and elsewhere in the ef
fort to stamp out the disease. He men
tioned the fact that the Queen had or
dered the destruction of thirty-six of her
dairy cows which had been found to have
tuberculosis. It was an example, he
urged, such as the farmers ought to fol
low.
ALASKANS BURIED
BY AN AVALANCHE
ON CHILCOOT PASS
At Least Six Persons Crushed
to Death Near the Summit
of the Divide.
SEATTLE. Wash., Dec. 20.â The steamer Al-Ki which arrived here to
day from Alaska brings meager particulars of an avalanche on the Chil
koot Pass, in which at least six people were killed. Five bodies have been
recovered, as follows:
MRS. DARLING, of Lake Linderman, and her two sons.
BERT JOHNS of Juneau.
HARRY SHAW of Skaguay.
The slide occurred on December 9 at Crater Lake, about one mile be
yond the summit, on the Lake Linderman side.
Mrs. Darling's husband was at Lake Linderman, and she had arranged
to join him with her two sons, who had almost reached manhood. Shaw
was a Skaguay man who had business at the Lake. Bert Johns of Ju
ntitu was about 18 years of age, and the reason for his taking the dan
gerous trip does not appear. He was a friend of the Darling boys. The
name of the sixth person had not been ascertained.
Contrary to the advice of old timers, who realized that the trip was a
dangerous one in view of recent storms, the party set out with light out
fits. It was storming severely when they crossed the summit, but they
succeeded in reaching Crater Lake, where the blizzard forced them to camp,
although it was but seven miles to their destination.
While encamped there tons of ice and snow, mixed with rocks and tim
bers, swept over them, evidently without warning, and went on down the
valley, leaving them buried under several feet of hard snow.
Their bodies were found three days later by a searching party. Thft
bodies were not bruised in the least.
A peculiar coincident is that the news of the slide was brought by the
same steamer that brought word of the terrible slide last spring, in which
nearly sixty people perished. Another coincident is that the two slides oc
curred just about the same distance from the summit, but on opposite
sides.
Just before the Al-Ki left Skaguay, G. Bald Mills of London, England,
and A. T. Smith of Melbourne, Australia, arrived from Lake Atlin with
their feet and hands badly frozen. It is feared Mills will lose both feet.
THE SAN FKAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 21, 189 S.
TELLS OF THE
EXPEDITION
TO SANTIAGO
Shatter Before War
Investigators.
CUBAN CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS
THE GENERAL PRAISES DOC
TORS AND STAFF OFFICERS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â General
Shafter appeared rather unexpectedly
before the War Investigation Commis
sion this afternoon and told his story
of the Santiago expedition. He was
supported by his aid. Colonel Mlley,
who was with him in Cuba, and flanked
by a large portmanteau of papers, to
which his aid occasionally applied for
reference.
General Shafter's story of the opera
tions around Santiago was tersely told,
but at this quite vivid in its recital
and interesting in detail. Briefly
summed up his estimate of the San
tiago expedition was that it had been
a military success and cheap at the
cost of 500 men lost in the fight. He
considered the expedition to have been
as well fitted out as the time allowed
would permit, and said that in looking
back he had no criticism of his plans to
make and would not change them if the
events had to be gone through again.
He said he had no complaints of any
sort to make and would be loath to in
trude them at this time if he had.
The commission stated that General
Miles to-day communicated to the com
mission his unwillingness to volunteer
testimony. A message was accordingly
sent to the adjutant general directing
him to request the appearance of Gen
eral Miles before the board. No reply
had been received to this communica
tion when General Shafter rather un
expectedly appeared.
After a brief preface General Shafter
went into a detailed account of his
preparations for the Santiago expedi
tion. He said his plans were changed
three times by the department. He
Bald the transport fleet was not suffi
ciently large to accommodate 17,000
men for any length of time at sea. but
all were so anxious to go that he risked
considerable crowding to take all the
men possible. He admitted that he
took chances in doing this, but said the
weather was good and there was no
mishap to regret. The men were regu
lars almost entirely, fully equipped and
he saw that they were made comfort
able as circumstances permitted.
As for medical supplies. General
Shafter said: "You know medical sud
plies are the one thing that a com
manding general or a line officer m-vor
knows anything about. The surgeon
is supposed to know what he wants.
My medical officer said he thought he
had enough medical supplies for the
temporary service to which we thought
we were destined. Events proved, bow
ever, that the surgeon was mistaken.
The ammunition supply was ample."
General Shafter said he regarded the
landing of the expedition as eminently
successful. They lost only two men
and thirty animals out of a total of
20,000 men. It was a remarkable re
cord.
"There has been considerable criti
cism from the medical officers about
getting medical supplies ashore." said
General Beaver. "Were any such com
plaints brought to you?"
"A majority of the regimental sur
geons left their medir- 1 chests on their
vessels. When I found this out, I put
Dr. Goodfellow aboard the Manitou and
had him collect these chests. As soon
as they were landed they were put on
four wagons and -"â¢â¢-' 'buted at once to
the men."
As to the care of the wounded, Gen
eral Shafter said that .they were cared
for as carefully as the circumstances
would permit. "The doctors worked
like Trojans. They deserved and re
ceived commendation from every one.
They worked till they were sick and
worn out. The doctors were mostly
young men. You can't get very old and
experienced surgeons to go on a sum
mer campaign for $100 a month. But
they were splendid fellows. Compared
with the civil war the wounded were
better cared for in Cuba than they
were then.''

TWO VERSIONS OF THE
POLICY OF EXPANSION
WILLIAMS AGAINST
IT IN THE HOUSE
He Vigorously Opposes
Holding Philippines.
FILIPINOS HARD TO CONTROL
ANNEXATION HOSTILE TO OUR
INSTITUTIONS.
One Way Out of the Difficulty, Says
the Mississippi Statesman,
Would Be to Sell the Is
lands to England.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â The House
to-day listened to the first speech on
the annexation of the Philippines. Wil
liams of Mississippi, a Democratic
member of the Foreign Affairs Commit
tee, in an hour's speech, stated his op
position to a policy which would bring
the islands under the sphere of the
United States infl-.ence. He contended
that it would be hostile to the spirit of
our institutions to assume control over
9,000,000 unwilling souls; that annexa
tion would cost us $140,000,000 a year;
that the annexation of the islands met
none of the tests which applied to our
past acquisitions of territory and would
be a mistake from a social, political and
material standpoint. Williams' re
marks received careful attention and
several times drew applause from his
Democratic colleagues.
The agricultural apropriatlon bill was
passed without material amendment. It
carried $3,6%, 322, or $187,120 more than
the current law.
At the opening of the session of the
House Cannon called up the conference
report on the army and navy deficiency
bill and moved its adoption.
De Armond (Dem.) of Missouri asked
whether the reapportionment of the bal
ance of the $50,000,000 to be expended
under the direction of the President would
in any way sanction or authorize the pay
ment' out "of that fund of $100,000 each to
Whitelaw Reid and Judge Day for ser
vices as Peace Commissioners.
Cannon said he knew nothing about it
and, on his statement that this reappor
tionment made no change authorizing
such an expenditure, the report was
adopted.
The House went into committee of the
whole on the agricultural bill. Wads
worth (R.) of New York explained that
it carried $3,696,322, an increase of $157.120
over the current law.
Williams (D.) of â  Mississippi took ad
vantage of the latitude allowed in debate
while in committee of the whole to make
an ar<urm-nt against the annexation of
the Philippines. Physically, he said, the
Islands would prove a great disappoint
ment. They were thickly populated with
peoples of heterogeneous races. They
could never afford home or opportunity
for American citizens. In the annexation
of territory of the post the area annexed
had been always coterminous, except in
the cast of Alaska, and we had in each
case increased our population and our
power of national defense. These had
been the tests in the past. The Philip
pines fulfilled none of these tasks. In the
case of Cuba, if Cuba should be willing
in the future to throw her lot with us,
the ease would be different. Sixty-six per
cent of Cuba's population was Caucasian,
a fact not generally known. Her people
could easily be assimilated. Cuba was
practically contiguous. She lay directly
within the sphere of American influence.
"We want no unwilling subjects," said
Williams. "We want no opportunity for
the exercise of tyranny. The South is
especially hostile to the absorption of a
great population alien in race, blood and
color and customs."
Annexation would project us 7000 miles
in the melee of the Orient. We would
have to hold in subjection 9,000,000 Fil
ipinos at a cost of $140,000,000 annually,
and as the House was considering an ag
ricultural bill it might be well to bear In
mind that the increased taxes could be
shifted and shifted until they reached
the farmer, who would pay in the end.
He argued that under the fifteenth con
stitutional amendment citizenship could
not be denied the natives of the islands
if they were annexed. He had been asked
why, if Mississippi had been able to deal
with the race question, the people of the
United States would not be able to do so
In the Philippines. The difference was
that the people of Mississippi understood
the problem with which it had to deal. It
came home to thorn by actual contact
The people of the United States who have
to solve it would do so theoretically and
they would fall. There must be white su
premacy. If white supremacy were not
guaranteed in Hawaii he declared that 90
per cent of the Caucasians would not re
main there.
While he opposed the annexation he
said he should not return the Philippines
to Spain. "I should leave the islands
where they were the day after Dewev's
glorious victory at Manila. I should haul
down the American flag. I am for the
flag for what it means, not for itself It
is nothing but a piece of bunting, and
whtn some one announces that it must
not come down. I care not how high his
station, he says something unworthy of
himself and his country. The flag should
come down if It Is right that it should do
so, and the American people must pull it
down. We would not let any other coun
try do It." (Prolonged applause on the
Democratic side.)
Proceeding AVilliams argued that if the
Philippines could not take care of them
selves they would fall under the influence
of 1- ranee or Germany. Our interest in
them was the commercial interest We
had in the East generally an interest In
an 'open door" policy. If any othc-r coun
try got possession of the Philippines it
would not do worse than Spain did" In any
event, our trade with the Philippines was
a more drop in the bucket, and if we re
tained possession of them we would sac
rifice the open door policy in the Orient
or go back on the constitution. There was
still another solution of the problem'
Williams said. If we do not want to give
the islands their independence or let them
fall under the sway of another country
we could sell them as a war indemnity to
England. She would bring to them civil
ization. The islands would get freedom
of religion and freedom of trade and we
would get rid of a military, political
racial, social and naval problem and an
everlasting, perpetual foreign policy
Williams' remarks were listened to with
careful attention and his colleagues gavv
h'm a hearty round of applause when he
oncluded.
No further time was occupied in general
debate, and the bill was read for amend
ment under the five-minute rule.
The provision inserted in the bill to be
used as a means of retaliating against
Germany and other countries was passed
with a slight amendment, which gives the
Secretary of the Treasury discretion in
refusing the delivery of goods adultera
ted instead of making refusal to deliver
such goods mandatory.
A provision in the bill to grant leaves of
absence to employes of the Bureau of
Animal Industry outside of Washington
wc-nt but on a point of order.
The bill was passed without further
amendments. At 5 o'clock the House ad

FAVORED BY TELLER
IN THE SENATE
Says Uncle Sam Should
Acquire Territory.
UPHOLDS RIGHT OF CONQUEST
THINKS NEW POSSESSIONS WILL
MAKE GOOD STATES.
By Giving the People of the Islands
Self-Government the Necessity
of Large Standing Armies
Would Be Removed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â 1n accord
ance with the notice given yesterday,
Teller of Colorado to-day addressed the
Senate on Vest's resolution, declaring
that under the constitution no author
ity is given to acquire territory to be
held and governed permanently as col
onies.
Teller's address was a constitutional ar
gument, which he prefaced by saying
that in view of Platt's very able expo
sition of the question he (Teller) might
omit properly much that he had intended
to discuss. He did not think there
was the slightest question of the power
of this Government to acquire foreign
territory.
"If we are a nation," he declared, "we
have ttie power to exercise the right of a
nationâ all the rights of any sovereign
power." When the country was called
upon in 1861 to meet this question it met
it fairly and settled It for all time. So
far as the United States was concerned
the question was setttled finally at Ap
pomattox.
"Then," declared Teller, "we took our
place as a nation, endowed with all the
powers of a sovereign, and we possess
those powers to-day."
Referring to the territory acquired by
the United States during the recent war,
Teller said:
"We have already acquired this terri
tory. We need, as a matter of fact, no
treaty with Spain to confirm our right to
It. By right of conquestâ a right undis
putedâwe come into .possession of Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Asiatic archipelago.
They are ours just as certainly as they
could be made so by treaty."
Teller discussed briefly the statement
of Vest that many of the deeds of cession
of foreign . territory acquired by the
United States contain clauses providing !
that the territory ultimately should be
created into States of the Union.
"We can confer statehood upon these
Territories when in our judgment it is
proper so to do. Nobody can call into
question our right to exercise our judg
ment in this matter. If we acquire terri
tory the very act carries with it the right
to govern. Who," he demanded with dra
matic force, "can govern now in Cuba or
in Porto Rico but the United States?
That Question is settledâ settled by the
very circumstances of the cas'a The
question is now, What disposition shall
we make of the territory that has come i
into our possession?"
Teller thought it a duty of our people i
and legislators to keep Jn mind constantly
the great principle upon which this Gov- I
ernment is foundedâ that the just powers
of a government are derived from the
consent of the governed.
"We ought." said he, "to extend to the
people of these possessions the power to
govern themselves as soon as they are
prepared to exercise that power. We are
coming to deal with the greatest question
the American people have met since 1861.
I anticipate much difficulty and embar
rassment, but have at no time felt the
distrusts that have been manifested by
many of our people."
"If this Government will say to the peo
ple of this acquired territory," said Teller.
" 'We will give self-government,' we will
not need an army of 50,000 men in Cuba,
20.000 in Porto Rico and 30.000 in the Philip
pines. To. say this to thosp people Is the
only way to escape a great standing army.
"I am not one," he said, further along, !
"to turn these possessions back to Spain, !
but I do believe that we ought to give I
them the opportunity to govern them- I
selves. I may say that nobody wants i
these possessions made into States now.
No public man is in favor of such a plan,
so far as I am aware, yet. in course of j
time, we may take them in."
So far and as soon as possible. Teller
believed the inhabitants of Cuba should
bâ¬ given self-government, but he did not ;
believe that the United States should i
leave the infant power thus established I
as a prey of any other nation, either i
through conquest "or treaty. He believed I
it folly to speak of "imperialism" as ap- ;
plied to this country. J*o man or Senate .
of men had any intention of establish- i
ing in this country the European policy of ;
imperialism, and none would champion
Buch a course.
Proctor here interrupted Teller to read
an extract from a letter from Admiral
Dewey concerning the character of the
Filipinos, as follows: "These people can
be governed without the slightest diffi- !
cultv They readily give in to reason. |
and"l have not had the slightest difficulty |
in dealing with them."
Proctor also read an extract from the

At 2 o'ciock the Nicaragua canal bill, j
the unfinished business, was taken up, to ;
the displacement of the registry measure, j
Caffery spoke in opposition to the canal
bill. He said the proposition to connect
the two oceans by means of a canal was
so attractive to the imagination as to
cause many people to accept it as a wise
enterprise, regardless of appeal to rea
son on its merits. He deprecated the per
sonal attacks upon the members of the
Maritime Canal Company, but indicated
his belief that the bill was an attack upon i
the treasury of the United States. He de
clared the enterprise under the bill was in
violation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
in contravention to the concession from
the Isthmian countries and In opposition i
to our own constitution. These proposi- '

A MAN CARRIED DOWN WITH
ONE OF THE VICTIMS.
Mrs. C. H. Haymond, First President
of the New York Red Cross
Society, Numbered Among
the Killed.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 20.â Three women
were killed and a man was severely in
jured to-day owing to a fire at the resi
dence of C. H. Raymond at West End
avenue and Seventy-third street. Mrs.
Underwood, a sister of Mrs. Raymond,
leaped from a second-floor window. Her
head struck the sidewalk and death
was instantaneous. William Doerr, in
trying to rescue Mrs. Underwood, sus
tained a fracture of the skull which will
probably result in death. Mrs. C. H.
Raymond followed Mrs. Underwood out
of the window and was picked up in
sensible, dying to-night, while Mr. Ray
mond was carried from the house un
conscious from smoke. After the flames
were extinguished, the body of Harriet
Fee was found on the third floor of the
house. She had been overcome by the
smoke.
A superb collection of pictures and
tapestries, owned by Mr. Raymond, was
entirely destroyed.
The fire was discovered by some one
passing in the street. When the fire
men arrived they could not get into the
building, as the flames burst out in
such volume that the men were driven
back. Mr. and Mrs. Raymond appeared
at windows of the third-story front and
Mrs. Underwood at a necond-story win
dow.
The firemen ran ladders to the upper
stories, and William Doerr, a railroad
conductor, volunteered to go up. Mrs.
Raymond and Mrs. Underwood could be
seen climbing out of the windows, and
the firemen and crowd begged them to
go back. Doerr was halfway up the
ladder, when Mrs. Underwood jumped
from the window, striking him full in
the breast and carrying him with her to
the street. Then the firemen bore away
Mrs. Underwood, while others rescued
Doerr. Mrs. Underwood was dead and
Doerr apparently dying, their skulls
having been crushed.
Meantime Mrs. Raymond, who could
not be restrained by her husband, had
jumped out of the window, and was
fatally hurt. Two firemen, who climbed
a ladder to the third story, rescued Mr.
Raymond just as he was overcome by
the smoke. Ferguson, the butler, es
caped by the rear. His face was bad
ly lacerated owing to his falling while
making his escape.
It was after the fire had been sub
dued that the body of Harriet Fee was
found. All the clothing had been burned
off and the corpse was black from the
flames.
Mrs. Underwood had come from Ohio
to spend the holidays with her sister,
Mrs. Raymond.
Mrs. Raymond was the first presi
dent of the New York Red Cross and
was also chief patron of the Red Cross
Hospital. Upon the opening of hostili
ties with Spain Mrs. Raymond volun
teered to go to any post to which the
society might assign her. The flags
carried by the Red Cross steamer
Texas when it carried supplies to the
front were the work and gift of Mrs.
Raymond. __^_______

WAR CLOUD GATHERS.
JANUARY 2Sâ The battle-ship Maine was
ordered to Havana. Consul General Lee
had reported that the situation was < . riti
<al. The proffered relief offered to the
Buffering Cubans hail aroused the spirit
of resentment, culminating In serious
riots In Havana. It was thought l eat for
the protection of American Interests in
Cuba to have the Atlantic squadron
establish a rendezvous at the Dry Tor
tug-as.
FEBRUARY 9-The publication of the
famous letter of Sc nor Dupuy de Lome,
Spanish Minister to the United States, 1< '1

Indignation, Inasmuch as, although de
signed as private c rt -c, ii con
tained a direct insult to President Mc-
Kinley.
"MeKinley is weak and caters to the
rabble," wrote this Spanish diplomatist,
"and is, moreover, a low politician, who
wishes to leave a door open for nil
and to stand well with the jingoes < ; his
party."
FEBRUARY 15â Tin- destruction of the
Maine in the harbor of Havana was the
first and greatest catastrophe expert
by the United States in all' her .
â¢with Spain. At Just 20 minutes bef
o'clock in the evening an explosion oc
curred by which the entire fon
part of the vessel was destroyed. Two
offioeff and K4 of the crew perished,
those who were not killed outright 1 ;
explosion being pinned between decks by
the tangle of wreckage and drowned like
rats by the immediate sinking of the hull.
The days that I were days of
anxious suspense. A wave of indigr.
ewept over the length and breadth of the
land. Captain Sigsbee's message asking ;
that judgment be suspended did not reas- '
sure the people. A great cry for venge
ance arose. The more impressionable
openly criticized the President's calmness.
FEBRUARY 17â The following offi
cers were appointed to investigate the
cause of the Maine disaster: Cap
tain W. T. Sampson of the lowa,
Captain F. E. Chadwick of the
New York, Lieutenant Commander w.
P. Potter of the New York and Lieuten
ant Commander Adolph Marix of the Ver

Judge advocate.

was caused in New York by the arrival of

visit of courtesy. The officers of the
Spanish vessel did not know until they
were informed after reaching the harbor
that the Maine had been destroyed. The
Vizcaya remained at anchor off Staten
Island for five days.
FEBRUARY 19â The United States Gov
ernment declined a request made by the
Spanish officials at Havana for a joint
Investigation of the wreck of the Maine.
Then "followed numerous objections from
Spain. She objected to the use of our
cruisers in sending supplies to the starv

Ip^J The Call presents its readers with this review in a form at once concise and complete. For purposes of reference, being arranged chronologically, it will be found of inestimable

require a repetition. In the first place, the United States could not, In the cause of humanity, stanu idly by and witness the reign of terror in Cub i under Campos, then Weyler, then

Kinley in his message, reviewed ths situation, and said that something would have to bs done. The President issued an appeal to the American peo pie, inviting contributions in aid of
the Cuban sufferer; The organization of a central Cuban relief committee, witn headquarters in New York, fallowed, and contneutions of money and supplies poured in. Consul General

DEWEY IN MANILA BAY.
MAY Iâ This day witnessed the greatest
naval victory in the history of the world.
The people of the United Slates were elec
trified by the news that the entire Span
ish fleet had been destroyed by Dewey
in Manila Bay and that the feat had been
accomplished without serious injury to
any of our ships and no loss of Jife on the
American side. The achievement is terse
ly told In Dewey's report:
' "Kiagship Olympia, Cavite, May 4, IS9B.
"The squadron left Mlrs Bay on April
27, arrived off Bolir.ao on the morning of
April 30. and, finding no- vessels there, pro
ceeded down the coast and arrived off the
entrance to Manila Bay on the same af
ternoon. The Boston and the Concord
were sent to reconnoiter Port Subig. A
thorough search of the port was made by
the Boston and the Concord, but the
Spanish fleet was not found. Entered the
south channel at half-past 11 p. m., steam
ing In column at eight knots. After half
the squadron had passed a battery on the
south side of the channel opened fire, none
of the shots taking effect. The Boston
and McCulloch returned the fire. The
squadron proceeded across the bay at
slow speed and.arrived off Manila at day
break, and was fired upon at a quarter
past 5 a. m. by three batteries at Manila
and two near Cavite, and by the Spanish
fleet anchored In an approximately east
and west line across the mouth of Bakor
Bay. with their left in shoal water in
Canacoa Bay.
"The squadron then proceeded to the
attack, the flagship Olympia, under my
personal direction, leading, followed at a
distance by the Baltimore, Raleigh, Pet
rel, Concord and Boston, in the order
named, which formation was maintained
throughout the action. The squadron
opened fire at 19 minutes to 6 a. m. While
advancing to the attack two mines were
exploded ahead of the flagship, too far to
be effective. The squadron maintained a
continuous and precise fire at ranges
varying from 5000 to 2000 yards, counter
marching in a line approximately parall"!
to that of the Spanish fleet. The enemy's
fire was vigorous but generally ineffective.
Early in the engagement two launches
put out toward the Olympia, with the
apparent intention of using torpedoes.
One was sunk and the other disabled by
our fire and beached before they were
able to fire their torpedoes.
"At 7 a. m. the Spanish flagship Reina
Crlstina made a desperate attempt to
leave the line and come out to engage at
short range, but was received with such
a galling lire, the entire battery of the
Olympia being concentrated upon her,
that she was barely able to return to the
shelter of the point. The fires started in
her by our shell at the time were not
extinguished until she sank. The three
batteries at Manila had kept up a con
tinuous fire from the beginning of the en
gagement, which flre was not returned
by my squadron. The first of these bat
teries was situated on the south mole
head at the entrance of the Pasig River,
the second on the south position of the
walled city of Manila and the third at
Malate. about one-half mile farther south.
At this point I sent a message to the
Governor General to the effect that if the
batteries did not cease firing the city
would be shelled. This had the effect of
silencing them.
"At 25 minutes to 8 a. m. I ceased firing
and withdrew the squadron for breakfast.
At It', minutes after 11 I returned to the i
attack. By this time the Spanish flagship I
ami almost all the Spanish fleet were In
flames. At half-past 12 the Bquadron
d firing, the batteries being silenced
! and the ships sunk, burned and deserted.
"At 20 minutes to i the squadron re
turned and anchored <>iT Manila, the ,
Petrel being left behind t>' complete the
destruction of the small'!- gunboats,
which were behind the point of Cavite.
This duty was performed by Commander
El P. Wood in thi- most expeditious and
lete manner possible. The Spanish
lost the following vessels: Sunk Relna
I Cristina, Castllla, l>"ii Antonio de (Jlloa;
burned- Doti Juan do Austria, Isla de
Luson, isla Â«u> Cuba, General Leso, Mar

Rapido and Hercules (tugs) and several I
small launches.
"I am unable to obtain complete ac- j
counts of the enemy's killed and wounded, I
j but believe their losses to be very heavy.
! The Reina Crlstina alone had 150 killed. I
: am happy to report that the damage done
; to the squadron under my command was
: Inconsiderable. There was none killed
i and only seven nv.'i) in the squadron were
â lightly wounded. Several of the vessels
were struck and even penetrated, but the
damage was of the slightest, apd the
; squadron is in as good condition now as
before th* battle.
"1 beg to state to the department that I
doubt if any command^r-in-chief was ever
served by more loyal, efficient and gullant
captains than those of the squadron under
my command. Captain Frank Wildes,
; commanding the Boston, volunteered to
1 remain in command of his vessel, al
; thouph his relief arrived before leaving
Hongkong. Assistant Surgeon Kindel
berger of the Olympia and Gunner J. C.
Evans of the Boston also volunteered to
remain after orders detaching them had
arrived.
"The conduct of my personal staff was
] excellent. Commander B. P. Lamberton,
: chief of staff, was a volunteer for that
position, and gave me most efficient aid.
I Lieutenant Brumby, flag lieutenant, and
Ensign E. P. Scott, aid. performed their
i duties as signal officers in a highly cred
: itable manner. Caldwell, flag secretary,
volunteered for and was aselsrned to a
subdivision of the five-inch battery. Mr.
J. L. Stickney. formerly an officer in the
United States navy, and now correspond
ent of the New York Herald, volunteered
for duty as my aid, and rendered valua
ble service. I desire especially to mention
the coolness of Lieutenant C. G. Calkins,
the navigator of the Olympia. who came
: under my personal observation, being on
tho bridge with me throughout the entire
action and giving the ranges of the guns
with an accuracy that was proven by the
. excellence of the firing.
"On May 2, the day following the en
! gagement. the squadron again went to
1 Cavite, where it remains. On the 3d the
j military forces evacuated the Cavite ar
i senal, which was taken possession of by
1 a landing party. On the same day the
i Raleigh and Baltimore secured the sur
l render of the batteries on Corregidor
i Island, paroling' the garrison and destroy
j Ing the guns. On the morning of May 4
! the transport Manila, which hud been
i aground in Bakor Bay, was towed off and
made a prize."

CERVERA- IN A TRAP.
MAT 26â The battle-ship Oregon arrived
in Key West in good condition after a
voyage from Puget Sound of eighty-one
days, during the course of which she had
made 17,499 miles. The achievement was a
notable one, and Captain Clark was the
recipient of much praise and honor. After
taking on coal the captain announced that
he was ready to go to sea again and fight.
Commodore Schley reported by cable
that he was off Santiago and that he be
lieved the Spanish fleet which had so long
been playing a game of hide-and-seek was
in the inner harbor. For several days
there were conflicting rnmors. Many be
lieved Cervera to be too old a warrior to
be caught in such a trap. There was only
one entrance to the harbor, through a
narrow defile in the hills.
MAY 29â A1l doubts were set at rest
when Commodore Schley approached ' the
harbor entrance close enough to verify
his suspicions. He had Cervera's fleet
bottled up. His comment, "They will be
a long time getting home," is one of the
classics of the war.

" !ii' > N'E 2â The House of Representatives
passed an urgent deficiency bill, carrying
nearly $!VOOO.OOO for war expenses.
JUNE sâ This day marked one of the
most during and sensational achievements
of the war, the attempt of Naval Con
structor Richmond Pearson Hobson to
close the mouth of the harbor so that the
Spanish vessels could not get out. That
tne attempt was not wholly successful
did not materially alter the subsequent
events, nor does It detract from the glory
of the brave nun who went to almost
certain death. Admiral Sampson's or
ftclal reporl tells the story briefly:
"United states Flagship New York,
â¢â¢iff Santiago, June 3, 1104.
"Permit me to call your special atten
tion to Assistant Naval Constructor Hob
son. As stated in a special telegram, be
fore coming here I decided to moke the
harbor entrance secure against the possi
bility of egress by Spanish ships by ob
structing the narrow part of the entrance
by sinking a collier at that point. Upon
calling on Mr. Hobson for his professional
opinion as to a sure method of sinking the
snip Me manifested the most lively inter
est in the problem. After several days'
consideration he presented a solution
which he considered would insure the im-
mediate sinking of the ship when she
reached the desired point in the channel.
This plan we prepared for execution when
we reached Santiago. The plan contem
plated a crew of only seven men and Mr.
Hobson, who begged that it might be in
trusted to him. The anchor chains were
arranged on deck for both the anchors,
forward and aft. the plan including the
anchoring of the ship almost automati
cally.
"As soon as I reached Santiago and had
the collier to work upon, the details were
completed and diligently prosecuted, hop
ing to complete them in one day, as the
moon and tide served beet the first night
after our arrival. Notwithstanding every
effort, the hour of 4 o'clock In the morn
ing arrived and the preparation was
scarcely completed. After a careful in
spection of the final preparation I w;is
forced to relinquish the plan for that
morning, as dawn was breaking. Mr.
Hobson begged to try it at all hazards.
"This morning proved more propitious,
as a prompt start could be made. Noth
ing could have been more gallantly exe
cuted. We waited Impatiently after the
firing by the Spaniards had ceased. When
they did not reappear from the harbor at
6 o'clock I feared that they had all per
ished. A steam launch which had been
sent in charge of Naval Cadet Powell to
rescue the men appeared at this time,
coming out under a persistent fire of the
batteries, but brought none of the crew.
A careful inspection of the harbor from
this ship showed that the Merrlmac had
been sunk in the channel.
"This afternoon the chief of staff of Ad
miral Cervera came out under a flag of
truce with a letter from the admiral, ex
tolling the bravery of the crew in an un
usual manner. I cannot myself too earn
estly express my appreciation of the con
duct of Mr. Hobson and his gallant crew.
I venture to say that a more brave and
daring thing has not been done since
Cushing blew up the Albemarle. â¢ â¢ *
"There were hundreds of volunteers who
were anxious to participate. There were
150 from the lowa, nearly as many from
this ship and large numbers from all the
other ships, officers and men alike.
"W. T. SAMPSON."
The men who accompanied Hobson on
this dangerous mission deserve to have
their names preserved in history, despite
the fact that Admiral Sampson did not
mention them by name in his report. The
six who were chosen were: Osborn Deig
nan. George F. Phillips, Francis Kelly,
George Charette, Daniel Montague and
J. C. Murphy. There was another, Ran
dolph Clausen, who was at work on the
Merrimac, and who stowed himself away
in his eagerness to be one of the party.
It is here necessary to go Into the
future. Hobson and his men were taken
aboard the Reina Mercedes, and from
there were confined in Morro Castle, and
later in the city of Santiago. They were
treated with the respect which their hero
ism deserved, and on July 6 were released
in exchange for Spanish prisoners cap
tured by our forces.
Mr. Hobson subsequently explained that
the reason the Merrimac was not sunk
directly across the channel, as had been
intended, was because a shot from one of
the Spanish batteries had carried away
her rudder, making her unmanageable.

Dr. John Blair Gibbs, were killed. AH
night long the firing continued.
JUNE 12â The skirmishing between the
marines and the Spaniards still continued.
The Texas arrived at Guantanamo and
landed forty men, with two Colt auto
matic guns, while the Marblehead shelled

JUNE 20â There were two events of more
than passing interest on this day. the
scene of one being Cuba, and the other
the faraway Pacific. Dismissing for the
present the arrivals of the army of inva
sion In Cuban waters, let us consider how
the cruiser Charleston took possession of
the Ladrones.
The Charleston and the three transports
of the first Manila relief expedition
steamed into Port San Luis de Apra, Is
land of Guam, and fired thirteen shells at
the fortifications. There was no response,
but two small boats put out from shore
and approached the cruiser. They con
tained the captain of the port and the
health officer, who apologized for not re
turning the salute, owing to the fact thatthe proper means were not at their dis
posal.
â¢aptain Glass of the Charleston aston
ished the Spanish officers by telling them
tha.t his guns had been fired, not as a sa
lute, but as a demand for surrender. The
Spaniards, cut off entirely from the out
side world, were quite unaware that war
had been declared between the United
States and Spain.
Lieutenant Braunersreuther, with a
force of marines, went ashore, notified the
Governor of the condition of affairs; and
demanded his surrender. This official,
Senor Jose. Marina, was thunderstruck.
H-- and his staff were taken on board the
Charleston, and the next day started for
Manila, after seeing the Stars and Stripes
â¢waving over the government buildings.
This was one of the ludicrous incidents of
the war, an incident worthy of opera
bouffe.
On June 20 the Cuban campaign may be
said to have fairly gotten under way.
General Shafter's forces arrived in the

JULY Iâ The two most important en
gagements of the Cuban campaign fell
upon this day, both being successful, al
though the American forces met with
he;<vy losses. General Lawton'a Infantry
stormed the hills of Caney, the Seventh,
Twelfth and Seventeenth infantry (Gen
eral Chaffee's brigade) leading 'in the
attack. In the taking of San Juan the
unmounted cavalry, the First ami Tenth
regulars, and Roosevelt's Rough Riders
bore the brunt of the fighting, again dis
tinguishing themselves and adding fresh
laurels to those already won at Las Gua
Â»lma.s. Our losses in these two engage
ments were 22 officers and 20s men killed
and 81 officers and 1203 men wounded.
These figures are from General Shafter's
own report.
The plan of our forces in both engage
ments was to drive the Spaniards back
trench by trench. This feat was rendered
all the more difficult because the Span
â¢ iards were using smokeless powder. That
! it was finally accomplished is a lasting
j tribute to the courage of the American

CERVERA'S FLEET SUNK.
JULY 2â Cervera's fleet was entirely de
stroyed w..ile atempting to leave thÂ«> har
bor of Santiago. An interview having been
prearranged between General Shafter and
Admiral Sampson, the laiter. In the flag
ship New York, left the fleet for Siboney.
When the flagship was about four miles
east of her blockading station and about
seven miles from the Morro the Spanish
squadron was seen steaming out of the
harbor's entrance.
The New York turned, and steamed for
the escaping: tleet, flying the signal to
elope in toward the harbor entrance and
attack vessels, but our ships had already,
in acordanco with standing orders at
once engaged the Spanish ships with the
utmost spirit and vigor, and in the course
of a running fight, which continued until
20 minutes past 1 p. m.. the latter were
completely destroyed, and the famous vic
tory, with its splendid credit to officers
und men, was won.
The movement of the Spanish vessels
In broad daylight seemed suicidal, as in
deed it was, but Adminal Cervera had
twice received order? to leave Santiago
and go to Havana, and although he well
knew he was sending his fleet to destruc
tion, he simply obeyed orders.
That evening Admiral Sampson sent the
following disnatch to Washington: "The
fleet under my command offers to the na
tion as a Fourth of July present the de
struction of the whole of Cervera's fleet.
Not one escaped. It attempted to escape
at half-past 9 this morning. At 2 thÂ»- last
ship, the Cristobal Colon, had run ashore
sixty miles west of Santiago, and had let
down h<>r colors. The Infanta Maria Te
rfM. Oiuendn and Vizcaya were forced
ashore, burned and blown up within twen

the port. Our loss, one killed and two
wounded. Enemy's loss, probably several
hundred from gun fire, explosions and
drowning. About twelve hundred prison
ers, including Admiral Cervera. The man
killed was G. H. Ellis, chief yeoman of

DUNNING AS MORfIL CENSOR.
SELDOM have the senses been shocked by the
exhibition of such foulness as is embodied in
the man Dunning, now in jail, where he
threatens the thief and the as>a>sin with the danger
of contamination. He =eems to be the essence of
depravity, a being without conscience, reeking with
the stench of the abandoned â a man who betrayed
his trust, who turned from his faithful wife to con
sort with a lewd and lecherous creature beyond the
reach of shame; who, pretending to reform, in
sulted this wife by continuing to write messages of
love to the unclean outcast who had supplanted her.
Dunning says that the morals of San Erancisco are
low. Surely it is not because they are low people
look upon* him with loathing and horror: it is not
because of this distressing failure to reach the Dun
ning standard that San Erancisco views his presence
much as it would the presence of a leper, shudders
to know that he is here, and will breathe easier when
he has gone. Dunning, presuming to lecture S^n
Francisco, would pollute a cesspool.
San Erancisco is not perfect. There is wickedness
here, as in all great cities. There are persons who
steal, who neglect their homes, who by innate de
pravity arc led into forbidden paths. But a search
of the slums, a raid upon the resorts of the criminal,
would not bring to light another man so vile as this
Dunning, who from the witness-chair, which for him
is as degraded a position as that of the prisoner at the
dock, dare> to criticize the morals of the city from
which his own indecency drove him.
TOO LOTE FOR REFORM.
THE proposition to bring Rosser back and put
him on trial for a less crime than that of which
he was unjustly acquitted is not a good one.
The man has gone. He disgraced the State
enough by once showing the inefficiency of the police
and the courts. Brought back, he would doubtless
repeat the humiliation.
Concession has been made to the Tennessee soldier
that he had a right to kill a citizen. His lawyer sob
bingly made clear this point. The Judge agreed, and
the jury stamped the decision official and final. If
Rosser had a right to kill Hildebrand. he surely had
a right to take a harmless shot at the lad Walsh.
Bringing Rosser back would entail a great expense,
and it would look like an attempt of the lax authori
ties to acquire anew the respect that they deliberately
cast away. There are better methods of accomplish
ing the same end. There are more criminals than
Rosser. and in the majority of cases their defenses
are as flimsy as that which took him from the shadow
of imprisonment.
Local jails are fairly bulging with murderers.
Probably five out of six of these deserve .to be
hanged. Doubtless five out of six expect not only not
tc be hanged but to go absolutely free. The proper
method of the authorities will be to prove to these
that assassins and thugs cannot rise superior to the
law. Let the police do their duty. They will find the
sensation novel and pleasing. Let the Chief be gal
vanized out of his senile trance. Let the District At
torney perform more serious functions than the draw
ing of an unearned salary. Finally, let maudlin and
(earful enthusiasts, loving a man-killer, be deprived
of influence, and dullards, dotards and incompetents
be barred from the jury-box.
YOUTHFUL DEPRAVITY.
A GIRL of fourteen arraigned for burglary, there
being two counts against her, pleaded naively
that on each occasion of transgression she had
been drunk. The plea was not regarded as sufficient
and she will be sent to a place where intoxicants are
inaccessible to children and the opportunities for
burglary few.
Vet youthful depravity ought to be shielded from
the consequences of error as certainly as depravity
more mature. This child stole a few trinkets and
articles of no particular use to her. Rosser killed an
innocent man, a stranger, one who could never by
any possibility have wronged him. His only excuse
was that he was drunk on a bad quality of liquor.
The jury let him go, and slobbered sympathy as he
departed.
However, a girl burglar, making the plea of in
toxication, constitutes a novel and disheartening
spectacle. A child of fourteen, properly safeguarded,
would hardly know that drunkenness existed. She
certainly would not know it through having felt with
in her its promptings to evil. It is well there exists
fÂ«.r such unfortunates place* of refuge, for' alter a
ce.ison of kindly guidance the child may emerge into
the world with some idea as to right and wrong. Her
c-.isc is a sad but, let 51 be hoped, no* a hopelcÂ«s goÂ«.
Congressman Bailey lias taken early to the war
path, and, while he may get a scalp or two, many a
tomahawk is being whetted for his own,
DROUGHT AND DISTRESS.
CALIFORNIA has never suffered as much from
perturbation in the seasons, the fluctuation of
famine and plenty, chargeable to climatic con
ditions, as other States.
Fur many years in her early settlement; ensuing
upon the border troubles, Kansas was a famine
smitten State. A succession of droughts, and of sea
sons in which growing crops were cut, down by that
poison southwest wind which is the analogue of our
hot norther, compelled her people to appeal to the
surrounding States for charity. A Kansas relief
committee was a standing organization in nearly
every town in lowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and
Ohio, throughout those years. When the seasons
again became normal their crops were reaped and
eaten by grasshoppers, that swarmed down from the
Kocky Mountains and fell upon the land, as great a
burden as they were to old Egypt. The term "bleed
ing Kansas," which had taken iis place among the
party cries of 1856. was changed to "starving Kan
sas." But the insect plague passed away, and Kansas
has since added her enormous production of corn,
wheat, beef, purk and fruit to the surplus out of
which the farmers of the United States have been able
to feed the world.
The afflicting drought of the past season has
brought about suffering in some limited localities in
California. They are where crops and the stock
ranges depend upon a normal rainfall, principally in
the valleys and the foothills of the Coast Range. A
heavy rainfall in late September or early October, by
bringing on the range forage, would have averted
most of this suffering. The early rains were lacking,
however, and their la.ck, added to the short moisture
of the preceding rainy season, exhausted the stored
resources of the people.
The sufferers do not number more than 2000 â per
haps not more than 1500. They are valuable citizens.
Every man who takes his family and settles on land,
to make it productive and add to the State's re
sources, is a valuable citizen. In supplying their
want? let it be understood that those who do it are
not giving in charity in that humiliating sense in
which the term sometimes applies. The State,
through its various organizations and boards of trade,
spends more money every year in advertising to
secure immigrants than will be needed to relieve
these good people who are with us and will stay and
labor for the commonwealth. What will be required
t. keep them in comfort where they are, if spent on
immigration, would not secure a like number of new
citizens. It is, therefore, wise selfishness and good
business to furnish the.->e folks with an abundant and
substantial ration, and to keep life in their remaining
animals, until nature's bounty, responding to their la
bor, again makes them independent.
President Dohrmann of the Merchants' Association
has the matter in hand, and it will be well to make
that organization the recipient and distributor of the
relief required. One organization is sufficient. It
can better make transportation arrangements than
many can, and there will be less waste in distribution
than if many wL-re concerned in it.
All that the people want is to be helped that they
may soon help themselves.
It is said in some quarters, that their settlement in
the destitute districts was unwise, inasmuch as stock
ranching and dairying therein must depend upon the
spontaneous forage and not on artificial production.
While this may be to a degree true, it is less their
fault than appears on the surface.
The Government has not been wise in handling its
stock range domain. It would have been better to
lease this in large tracts for grazing purposes solely.
Its natural forage plants would thereby have been
1 from extermination by over stocking, and if
experience demonstrated the fitness of any part of it
for agriculture this could have l/een finally separated
and held subject to the wants of the homestead settlen
Instead of this policy, these lands throughout the
West have been treated as agricultural, their acquisi
tion has been confined to the acreage of agricultural
holdings, and the grazing interests have sustained
themselves by resort to artifice that would have been
unnecessary under a better system.
As the Government has held these lands subject to
patent to small holders, the people must not be
blamed for assuming too much from that fact. The
first duty is their immediate relief, and then they will
adjust themselves to the conditions disclosed by their
experience.
AN EDDY IN THE MONEY MARKET.
A CURIOUS condition of affairs prevails in the
money markets of the Eastern States and of
Europe. Something like an eddy has been
formed in the channels of finance, and considerable
sums of money have been whirled around and di
verted to a course directly opposite to that in which
they would naturally flow.
A late report of the Treasury Department in re
viewing the effects of the favorable balance of trade
between this country and Europe says: "A year ago
it was estimated that the United States had a balance
of $80,000,000 to $100,000,000 in Europe, and it is sup
posed that the amount has been increased. This
money is left in the Old World because it can earn
a higher rate than in the United States. In Germany
it commands as much as 5 per cent, while call loans
are being made in New York as low as i l / 2 per cent
and time loans at 3 per cent. The great banks of
Europe have been forced to advance their discount
rates to prevent such a flow of gold to America as
would embarrass foreign money centers."
It is further to be noted that so much money has
been accumulated in the money centers of the East
that there has been a simultaneous movement in New
"i ork and New England to reduce rates of interest
paid on bank deposits. There has been a marked de
mand for bonds of all kinds, bankers and capitalists
complain of the difficulty of placing good loans, and
the opinion is freely expressed that the United States
have reached a point where they can become the
banking nation of the world, able to furnish money
for the development of Russia or Asia or Central
Africa, or any other land that may need it.
This condition is unnatural. It can hardly be more
than an eddy in the current that turns money from
New York to Germany instead of to the Western and
the Southern States. There are far better opportu
nities for investment in the United States than any
where else at the present time, and if the New York
capitalists were as enterprising as they are rich, they
would seek them out, and by building up their own
country get better rates of interest than they can ever
get in Europe.
California alone can absorb a large amount of the
idle capital of the East and profitably employ it.
Within her domain are a thousand opportunities for
investment. She has rich mines still undeveloped,
forests uncleared and lands untilled. More than that.
She has an abundance of raw material that could be
profitably worked up by the construction of factories
in her cities. The State ships fresh fruit and imports
preserves, it ships lcathor and imports shoes, it sends
I forth woo! and imports cloth.
The whole of the West and the South is in a con
dition similar to that of California. Every State and
Territory in that wide domain lying west of the Mis
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1898.
souri River and south of Omaha offers opportunities
for the investment of capital. This being so. it would
be well for the New Yorkers to bring their money
from Europe and set it to work at home. It may
gratify their vanity to assume to be the money
lenders lor the world, but there would be more busi
ness sense in upbuilding their own country.
THE STATE PRINTING MUDDLE.
THE State Board of Examiners, the Governor
and the members of the coming Legislature, in
their preparations for opening the State Printing
Office, are confronted, we may remark, by a condi
tion, not a theory. In connection with the condition
one thing may be stated with reasonable certainty:
The legislators who become responsible for delaying
the session in. order that political vengeance may be
wreaked upon somebody will be held to a strict ac
countability by the people.
It is true that Governor Budd, a Democrat, vetoed
the State Printing Office appropriation, but that is
now past history, and it need not be used by the
politicians for the purpose of damaging the Demo
cratic party. Governor Budd is about to retire from
office, and for his acts history will hold him respon
sible. What the State authorities and Legislature
should do is to guarantee State Printer Johnston a de-
ficiency appropriation and authorize him to imme
diately open his office and prepare for business. If
this is not done two or three valuable weeks of the
coming session may be wasted.
Governor Budd and Mr. Johnston have composed
their differences and are now prepared to co-operate.
It will not do for Republican Senators and Assem
blymen to disturb this entente cordiale for the pur
pose of making a little worthless political capital.
Business is business, and a State's business is en
titled to as much consideration at the hands of the
men elected to conduct it as the business of an indi
vidual.
Among other important measures whose safety will
be endangered by the refusal of certain Republican
leaders to support State Printer Johnston's deficiency
appropriation is the new charter of this city. That in
strument will demand the services of a great many
printers in its publication, and if it is not prepared
and presented promptly it may fall in the crush of
legislation and fail of ratification. This would he a
disaster which would greatly damage the Republican
party of San Francisco â an organization that will
be held accountable for the safe passage of the in
strument through the Legislature.
Besides this there is a great deal of legislation
which ought to be enacted, and if the Legislature
does not get to work promptly much of it will fail
and the remainder be crudely enacted. The Senatorial
contest is not the only interesting feature of the
coming session. The members can get together any
time and elect a Senator, but it requires industry and
i thought to enact laws. What the "leaders" should
do all around is to sink their differences and co
operate in promptly opening the State Printing
Office. If these men are not willing to do so, State
Printer Johnston should open his office regardless
of them. A majority of the Legislature will sustain
him.
WASHINGTON AND HER FESTIVAL.
AS a rule the city of Washington gives to Con
gress her undivided attention. Her people
have little in the way of business or pleasure
to distract their minds from the doings of the Senate
and the House of Representatives, and, accordingly,
not much else is talked of.
At the present time, however, Washington is com
paratively indifferent to Congress, and thinks of the
statesmen only when she wishes an appropriation.
The thoughts and the talk of her people are directed
almost wholly to the proposed celebration of the cen
tennial of the foundation of the city. This festival is
to take place in 1900, and preparations for it are ac
tively under way.
One of the means by which the Washingtonians
are arousing their enthusiasm on the subject to an
even greater fervor is by delving into the annals of
the past and bringing to light the predictions con
cerning the city that were made by the fathers of the
Republic. With the large, divine words of the
golden-mouthed orators of old. they cheer them
selves, and, looking around upon their city, they
exult in the fulfillment of those lofty ideals.
Some of these old-time words are of interest to the
whole country. When Congress assembled for the
first time in the newly founded city, November 17,
i<Soo. President Adams sent a message full of cheer
fulness, in which he said: 'May this territory be the
residence of virtue and happiness! In this city may
that piety and virtue, that wisdom and magnanimity.
that constancy and self-government, which adorned
the great character whose name it bears, be forever
held in veneration! Here and throughout our coun
try may simple manners, pure morals and true re
ligion flourish forever!"
Washington in her centennial celebration wishes to
show the world how nearly she has lived in accord
ance with this prayer of the patriot Adams. It is,
perhaps, for that reason she has for a time turned her
attention away from Congress, and perhaps after the
appropriation has been received she will put Congress
in the background altogether.
Under any circumstances the people of the whole
country will enjoy the Washington festival. We have
had celebrations of New York wealth, of Chicago
enterprise, of Omaha push, and now let us close the
century with the celebration of a city tfiat exults in
being ''the residence of virtue and happiness."
Legal technicality shines out in all its beauty in
the case of J. F. Turner. After an exhaustive trial
this man was found guilty of perjury and sentenced
to ten years. The public mind was not disturbed
by the thought that a wrong had been done him, either.
However, Turner got a reversal on the ground that
the indictment had failed to state that the perjury was
I willful. Of course, this is different. When perjury is
j accidental, or committed by a man in a hypnotic
trance or while he is sleep- walking, he is not to be
blamed.
The local columns recite the arrest and imprison
ment of a man and woman for having failed to keep
up payments on some goods they had bought on
the installment plan. If the circumstances are as re
lated an outrage has been committed, and an action
for false imprisonment would lie. The criminal
courts have more than they can do in attending to
their own business.
Perhaps some of the frightful stories told of the
torture of Spanish prisoners in the Philippines are
exaggerated, but it must be remembered that they are
not sent by Creelman, and are worth investigating.
Opposition to a proposed Senatorial junket to Cuba
comes, of course, from gentlemen who do not expect
to be on the committee, but it is valid opposition,
nevertheless.
Colonel Bryan has accomplished at least part of his
purpose. He will retain the military title to the end
of his days.
RESULT OF HOBSON'S CHOICE.
The Young Naval Hero May Become Admiral at the
Age of 40,
It is not surprising that Naval Con
structor Hobson shofcld have signified his
desire to the Navy Department to be
transferred to the line, for more honor
and emoluments await him in that branch
of his service than in his present corps.
If the original proposition regarding his
place in the line corps is adhered to Mr.
Hobson, who now has the relative rank
of lieutenant and as such takes prece
dence immediately after Lieutenant Roger
Welles of the line,- will be advanced to
the rank of lieutenant commander and
placed at the foot of that grade.
It is equal to a jump of 250 numbers or
twenty years' service and, no doubt, there !
will be some opposition made to this ad- j
vancemont, chiefly upon the ground that
such a jump is unprecedented in the ser
vice. Lieutenant Cushing, who blew up
the Albemarlo, was advanced only lifty
six numbers and made a lieutenant com
mander, and while Hobson's advancement |
of 230 numbers is unprecedented the act I
for which he is to be rewarded was also
unprecedented and would probably have

service as a naval constructor he will re- j
eeive (4300 a year. At the end of twenty 1
years he would, if still in the construe- j
tors 1 corps, perhaps have reached the
relative rank of commander, but the high- |
est position he could attain in his present I
grade would be that of Chief Constructor
with the relative rank of commodore and
a yearly salary of $5000. Ab, however,
there are twelve ahead of him as con
structor, his chances of closing the thirty
four years yet remaining before he retires
without reaching a higher relative
rank than that of commandei is more
likely than his becoming Chief of the |
Bureau of Construction and Repairs.
When, therefore, Mr. Hobson selects the :
j line corps as his future place of useful- j
ness in the navy he does so with a cl*ear
understanding of the not far-off ultimate j
result. His pay as a lieutenant command- i
er will only be $2800 at sea and $2400 while j

ARGUMENTS
THAT WON
From the Eureka Standard.
The campaign is over and the interest
in the result of the recent election has
died out, yet the history of the struggle
for supremacy in this State will be in
teresting to the people for some time
to come. The great daily papers of
i San Franciscoâ The Call, Chronicle,
! Post and Bulletinâ did much to educate
: the people and show the voters the true
1 inwardness of the situation. Maguire,
' though personally a clean man, was
! the embodiment of the worst political
â  principles that ever cursed a State, and
j his defeat was a blessing to the com
monwealth.
The paper which did the most to
bring the salient points in Maguire's
j political career to public view was The
< Call. That paper was edited during the
campaign by a masterful writer, or
corps of political writers. The publica
tion of Maguire's withdrawal from the
Democratic party and the analysis of
his political career constituted the most
powerful arguments used against him
i during the campaign.
The country press of the State has
! more inlluence in deciding an election
than the great city dailies; but the
country press In this campaign took its
cue from The Call, to a larger extent
than most people realize. The argu
ments which caused at least 35,000 old
1 line Democrats in this State to vote
against Maguire were mostly repro
duced from The Call's editorials, though
! each of the other dailies mentioned did
good and efficient work, not by any
means the least effective editorial work
being done by the Post.
The paper whk-h in the recent cam
paign did most to lead the press and
people to the conclusions which result
ed in a great Republican victory, in
the opinion of the Standard, is the San
I Francisco Call.
IN DEFENSE OF
REV. HENDERSON
To the San Francisco Call: In looking
over the contents of your worthy paper
of 14th inst. I was astonished to see
a remark made by some one regarding
the character of the Rev. J. E. Henderson.
1 feel it my duty to pen a few lines in
vindication of that gentleman's charac
\, r. The Rev. J. B. Henderson was sent
by the conference to take charge of the
Work at Angela Camp, and during his
stay on this work 1 was with him fre
quently. I can say that during the time
that I have been a member of the church
in different countries (which is over tifty
years) 1 have never met with a more
Christian gentleman than Mr. Henderson.
Mr. Henderson lives in the hearts of the
people in this little town to whom he
preached.
I am conscious that our people would
vindicate the character of Mr. Henderson
at the risk of their own lives. His name
is the household word in our town. I am
prepared to vindicate Mr. Henderson in
every way that my assistance might be
required. There is not a person in this
community but would put his signature
to this statement. Now, Mr. Editor,
would you be so kind as to insert this
simple statement in your paper? In so do
ing you will confer a favor on your sub
scribers, who wish to speak in vindica
tion of the character of a good man
and one that is beloved by us all. Hop
ing that you will comply with the re
quest of the citizens of this place I am
yours most respectfully.

Cruelty to Children.
Warrants were sworn out in Judge
Megan's court yesterday for the arrest
of John Coffey and his wife Mary on
charges of cruelty to children. Monday
night the parents were holding a drunken
orgy in their home. 310 Utah street, and
they finished up by driving their two
boys, one 10 and the other 7 years of age,
out of the house. Neighbors took charge
of the children until Policeman Edner ar
rived and he sent them to the City
Prison, where they were placed in the
care of the matron. They will he sent
to the orphan asylum at San Rafael.
he is likely to reach the grade of com
mander, with a salary of $3500. In two
years more, or about ISOS, he will be a
captain, receiving $4500 annually, and be
fore the year 1909 he will be a commodore
Mr. Hobson's place in the line is likely to
be next after Lieutenant Commander
George L. Dyer, the latest promotion to
that grade, and between Lieutenant Com
mander Hobson and the ranking rear ad
miral there will be 219 officers^ The re
tirements, however, of these officers will
be so rapid that before 1910 no less than
199 will have reached the age of b2, and
will therefore be retired, and it is quite
likely that voluntary retirements and cas- j
ualties will bring the vacancies up to j
nearly 219. In this event Hobson will be
second on the navy list, and if the grades
of admiral and vice admiral are re-estab
lished and continued, the present Lieuten
ant Commander Rittenhouse will be ad
miral and Hobson vice admiral. Barring
accidents the roster will be as follows:
Admiral, H. O. Rittenhouse, age, 09, sal
ary $13, on .
Vice admiral, R. P. Hobson, age 39, sal
ary $9000.
Lieutenant Lucien Young will be the
youngest commodoreâ only 56â but all the
rear admirals and commodores will be
gray beards, none less than 57, .and the
first on the captains list will be 57 years
of agr-'. Bj 1913 Hobson will have become
admiral of the navy and remain there, if
his life is spared, for twenty yeftTÂ». or
until 1933, when he may retire for age if
be chooses.
It i-s not to be wondered at that Hob
son should choose to enter the line again
with such a prospect. Arthur B. Holt,
who heads the list of ensigns, graduated
with Hobson; his signal number would
be 546, counting the numbers in each
grade ahead of him. and he will
be 325 numbers behind Admiral Hobson,
and will only have reached the middle of
the list of lieutenants or at the best head
the list of that grade. The presence of an
admiral for twenty years obstructing tho
flow of promotion is, of course, a hardship
to ambitious officers, but then his case is
a very unusual one and he merits all that
Congress or the country can offer him as
a reward for his heroism.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
THE TERELOâ L. R. E., Bandon, Or.
More than a hundred different methods
have been tested for the purpose of pre
venting the ravages of the teredo upon
submerged timber. The principal meth
ods now in use are creosoting, Kyaniz
ing, copper sheatlng and asphalt sheat
tng.
THE LORD RAGLAN-J. T. M., Berke
ley, Cal. The British ship Lord Raglan,
reached San Francisco the last time, Jan
uary 2, 1890. She came from New Castle
in sixty-four days, laden with coal. She
said from San Francisco for Queenstown,
October 24, IS9O, and has never been heard
from since.
WOODEN SEWER PIPE-W. 8.,
Crockett, Cal. This department has ex
amined the patent records for twenty
years from the present one and is unable
to discover any record of a San Francis
can having been granted a patent for a
wooden sewer pipe. There may be such
a patent, but you will have to write to
the Patent Office at Washington, D. C
for information.
THE PACIFIC BANK-S., City. The
amount of money returned to depositors
in dividends by the Pacific Bank amounts
to 40 per cent of their deposits, that is
up to the present time. The bank has,
however, paid about 80 per cent of its in
debtedness. Tne New York banks held
collaterals for money advanced and real
ized on the same, and in that way a part
of the indebtedness of the bank was
liquidated.
HOMESTEAD-E. V. S., Lidell, Napa
County, Cal. An individual who has
homesteaded 160 acres of land is per
mitted to take up a timber claim, or he
may purchase as much railroad land as
the railroad will sell him or he may de
sire to purchase. The latter land is not
under the jurisdiction of the United
States Land Office. There have been
no pre-emption claims since March 3,
1891.

PAINFUL REMINISCENCES OF A

Gretchen's going was a cold and pain

company Miss Lyons formerly graced
Who in a moment of sincere and violent

This smoldering of the burning EJajnea
of the tender passionâ wrapping in
icy bandages of an inflammable cardiac
had its cause and being in a Bohemian
gathering, held in the rooms of the I reds
Club a week ago last Saturday nlsht.
Miss Lyons and Hastings were among the
many the journalists delighted to honor
Miss Lyons had a good time. Hastings
Comedian Edwin Stevens of the tivoli
officiated as toastmaster and in the midst
of his arduous duties decided that
Gretchen Lyons was the most charming
girl in the room. After arriving at this
dangerous conclusion Stevens devoted the
rest 6f the evening to Miss Lyons and the
champagne. Thirteen and a half cases of
wine were consumed by the club mem
bers and their friends and the TjvoJl
fa\crite with the leading lady as his part
ner was in at the finish. i lasting tasted
neither wine nor punch but stood round
in corners with glaring eyes while he
devoured the northeast corner of his
rosy upper lip. â¢ : ' â
After the iress Club incident Gretchen
and Ernest only saluted each other
when necessity compelled. The leading
man diligently studied his lines and the
ex-leading lady packed her trunks. The
frosty covering of the Hastings heart, ac
cording to the management, has wonder
fully steadied the actor's head. For the
first time in many months Hastings was
letter perfect on Monday night and went
gayly through his role in spite of the fact
that the woman who had won his affec
tions and then trampled them under foot
was speeding to Milwaukee and hubby.

Nosed Out Horton,the

AT POST ODDS OF 12 TO 1
A SWERVE COST RUBICON HIS
RACE.
Red Glenn Won in Galloping Fash
ion â Pat Murphy a Mud
Lark â Ben Doran
Scored.
The astute Western horseman Pat
Dunne turned a warm one looso from his
barn at lngleside yesterday, and didn't
know it. Survivor, carrying his colors,
went to the post along with five other
two-year-olds in the opening scramble at
six furlongs, and so lightly were his
chances considered that the odds drifted
hack from 4 to 12. As a matter of fact,
Mr. Dunne and his friends laid their
checks on Horton. the 2 to 5 favorite, con
sidered invincible. "When it came to a
drive the last sixteenth "Skeets" Martin,
astride of Survivor, had the best of the
argument with Turner on the odds-on
choice, and gained the verdict by a nose.
Oood Hope, the second choice, also heav-
IJy played, was third. it was the initial
appearance at the meeting of the winner
and the stable naturally supposed the
Btrathmore youngster incapable of rough.
ing it with Horton.
â  The going was splashy and there were
one or two expensive upsets, noticeably
the defeats of Rubicon and Toribio. Daisy
h and Sweet William were the only wln
ning hofoes.
The downfall of Rubicon came about in
a peculiar,, way. The big chestnut horse
was a sharp favorite for the seven fur
lorfk run, in which both Montgomery and
Ben Doran were looked upon as keen
contenders. When the barrier flew up
Rubicon, with Thorpe up. and drawing
the rail position, swerved out. spoiling
his â vn and injuring the chances of
Montgomery. Spencer slipped away with
Ren Doran and though givi n an argument
by Mi ntgomery, won easily at the wire.
Rubicon came from the far rear, getting
the show, a length behind Montgomery.
In the betting on tbi Â»even starters in
the six furlong sprint, second on the card,
the ring laid 6 to 1 against I.it Murphy,
and the roan gelding won all the way.
Toribio, the favorite, was second.
The mile selling run proved an easy
thing for Daisy V. the 9 to 5 favorite.
She headed Imperious in the stretch and
won hands down. Hardly came like a
typhoon the last part, beating Imperious
out of the place. Of the other starters
Benamela was the worst disappointment.
There were only four starters in the
mile and a larter selling event, but it
was a most interesting betting affair.
Sardonic, the Corrlgan entry, and Top
mast closed equal choices, with snmr> very
heavy commissions played on Red Glenn,
cuttint his odds from 3^ to 1 to 13 to 5.
The latter gelding, with Martin up, cut
out all the running and led Sardonic over
the line by two lengths in 2:10%. Topmast
secured the show.
Going to the post a 7 to 10 favorite
Sweet William made a gallop of the final
five and a half furloner sprint. Dr. Sharp
an outsider, downed Ferrier for the place.
Track Notes.
iterday was very sloppy
on top. v.ith a good, firm footing.
Bookmal -- was one of the big
winners of the day, beating four out of
five r.'.
If Spender can furnish nn more vigorous
ride than the one he put up. on Toribio a
long-suffering public will gladly excuse
him till the weather clears up.
Despite the boosting it has received In
the East, the New Orleans game Is re
ported in a bad way. Handlcapper J. W.
Brooks of the Oakland track attended the
racing at Ingleslde and reported that Fred
Foster had wired for ton Ftalls, and was
due yesterday. In his string are such
*hifty performers as Abuse, Dr. Bhepard,
Dr. / tiice and Glenmoyne. Some years ago
Foster made a great "killing" with Dr.
Rice, when that horse won the Brooklyn
Handicap. Tommy Gritlin, it is said, is
also thinking of starting for California.
Caesar Young tried to beat 'em from the
ground yesterday, a feat he failed to ac
complish while On the block. Caesar
loined in the rush to got aboard Red
Glenn.
Pat Dunne thought so well of Horton
and so lightly of his own colt that he bet
|jOO on the former.
Eighteen bookmakers weighed in. Mose
Getz joined in the pilgrimage for wealth,
booking under the name of the Calumet
Club. Ben Selig. noted for his resem
blance to Lord Beaconsfleld, paid off the
winning tickets.
Sam woodford, the well-known Eastern
speculator, is one of the recent arrivals.
Dave Fountain, the Idaho horseman,
arrived at Oakland track yesterday with
the noted sprinter I Don't Know, the
Etake horse Tempo and a couple of others.
Tempo has quite a history. He was pur
chased in Kentucky by Ed Tipton and
Fent to Montana to wtn some coin. In
his races he displayed aoout as much
jspeed as a "yaller dawg," and was Bold at
auction to Mr. Fountain for $70. After
winning a oouple of purse races he WBM
started in the $5000 Labor day handicap,
decided at Anaconda, and beaten but a
nose by Scottish Chieftain, the Daly en
try. Later, at the Great Fall! meet, the
Whistle Jacket horse defeated Chieftain
over a mile and a quarter, covered in
2:OCV4, the Montana record. It was after
ward claimed that Tipton offered $2000 to

cuffs that the new Board of Supervisors
will refuse to issue permits to .any and all
clubs failing to pay a license of $100. This
is a good move in the right direction, for
the better interest of the sport.
Last evening Sergeant Chase, who at
tended * boxins: entertainment given by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1898.
the CaJifornia Athletic and Swimming
Club at Mowry's Hall, had to stop two
bouts which were between untrained and
im-xperienced boxers.
The first event on the programme was
to have been an eight-round contest be
tween Charles Thurston and Jim Farron.
Farron had a very limited knowledge of
the game and was being smashed ail over
the ring in the third round when the offi
cer came to his assistance.
The second bout between "Kid" Johnson
and Joe Daily was also stopped in the
third round, as Daily, who had gloves on
for the first time, was a chopping block
for his opponent.
The final event was an eight-round con
test between Charley Rochette and Char
ley Johnson, which was won by Rochette.
This was the only redeeming feature of
the show, which was far from being sat
isfactory to those who paid an admission
fee.

HAWKINS BESTS
KID McPARTLAND
Knocked Out in the
Third Round.
LEFT SWING ON THE JAW
NEW YORK LAD CARRIED TO
HIS CORNER.
Backers and Friends of the Califor
nian Cheer Wildly When the
Referee's Decision Is
Announced,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, Dec. 20.â Dal Hawkins,
the lightweight pugilist from the Pa
cific Slope, made short work of Kid
McPartland of this city, whom he met
in the arena of the Lenox Athletic
Club to-night. The bout was decided in
the third round, the New Yorker being
knocked out with a left swing on the
jaw. Hawkins opened favorite in the
betting at 100 to 80, but these odds did
not last long, and even money ruled
when the men donned the gloves.
This was the third time Hawkins has
fought before a New York club. He
won from Joe Gans in fifteen rounds
the last time he p^^ared here and was
knocked out by Spike Sullivan on his
second visit.
The men agreed to box under Mar
quis of Queensberry rules and to break
when called on. They were announced
to go twenty-five rounds. Each weigh
ed 135 pounds at 3 o'clock this after
noon.
Round Iâ After some slow work Haw
kins got in a left hook on Mac's stomach
and the Kid fell to his knees, but arose
quickly and they exchanged left hooks
on the stomach and head before the bell
sounded.
Round 2â Mac cut out the pace, with
Hawkins, on the defensive, but very little
was done by either until near the close,
when Hawkins landed a very hard left
hook in the wind.
Round 3â Hawkins was first to count,
swinging his left on the ribs. Mac replied
with a left on the head. Then both sent
left hooks to the head. Mac sent a
straight left to the face, and Dal sent his
right over the heart. This blow weakened
McPartland, who a few seconds later was
sent to the floor with a left hook on the
jaw. Mac rolled over, but got to his feet
in nine seconds. Both made passes at
close quarters. Dal sent his right and left
to the jaw and Mac landed a short left
swing on Dai's jaw. Just as Mac started
to sprint away Hawkins let fly another
long left swing which landed flush on
Mac's jaw and the New Yorker dropped
like a log, flat on his back. He lay as if
dead, while the referoe counted ten, and
then McPartland's seconds carried their
man to his corner.
He"feree Charley "White declared Haw
kins the winner, while tha backers and
friends of the Californian stood up and
cheered wildly. The time of the round
was two minutes and thirty-one sec
onds.
Frank Bradley of Philadelphia and
Billy Needham of St. Paul put up a
lively fight in the preliminary of ten
rounds at 126 pounds. Both men were
pretty well marked up at the finish. The
referee decided in favor of Bradley.

NO PAY, NO LIGHTS.
The Gas Company Begins a Tight for
Back Bills Due From the City.
The gas company considers the city a
bad debtor and has refused to honor re
quests for an aggregate of a thousand
new lights asked for during the last
month by the Board of Supervisors. And
the company has announced to the
board, though quietly, that it will not
honor further requests until Mayor Phe
lan's vpto gets the Charley horse and
goes out of business. Since October 7
every monthly bill of the gas company
that has come in has been passed by the
board, but sent back to it adorned with
the Phelan veto. Mr. Phelan has taken
this action not because he does not enjoy
the effulgence of the company's illumin
ant, but because he does not believe it
should be paid for if he can find a legal
technicality to evade it. The result is that
every payday compels a hustling for
enough votes to override his edict. Tt is
invariably done, but the bills are stopped
at the Auditor's office by an injunction
and the stream of dollars from the treas
ury effectually dammed.
The gas people have finally begun to
fight back and the threat was floating
around yesterday that "unless there was
something done in the next two weeks
Mr. Phelan would be obliged to write his
veto message? by tha light of a tallow
dip. As it is there will be no more light
requests honored until present obligations
are liquidated."

Niles Searls Recovering.
The many friends of Judge Niles
Bearls, who has been very sick at the
St. Nicholas Hotel, will be pleased to
learn that his condition has improved and
his physicians believe that he is now well
on the way to complete recovery. The
well-known jurist has been ailing: for some
time, but his condition took a serious
turn when he heard of the death of Su
premo Court Commissioner Isaac S.
Belcher. The two had been close friends
for many jre&rs and the passing away of
his associate prostrated Judge Searls.
The danger point, however, has passed
and it is expected that he will be about
in a few days.
Stuart Bobson tells how to win

Threatened His Wife.
A warrant was sworn out in Judge
Joachlmsen's court yesterday for the ar
rest of E. Delehanty, a saloon-keeper at
24 Howard street, for threatening to kill
his wife. She alleged that when he got
drunk he beat her and Monday night said
he would finish her. A year ago he was
arrested on a similar charge.

What a New Discovery in Medical Science Proves.
THE WORK YOUR KIDNEYS HAVE TO DO.
The Discoverer of Swamp-Root at Work in His Laboratory.
SWAMP-ROOT Is the Great Remedy for Kidney, Bladdef
and Uric Acid Troubles â To Prove for Yourself Its
Wonderful Merits, You May Have a Sample Bottle Sent
Absolutely FREE by Mail.
You can waste health without know-
ing it, and poor health almost always
begins in the kidneys.
The most important organs of the
whole body are the kidneys.
They filter your blood and keep it
pure.
People are apt to believe that kidney
disease is rather a rare disease, but re-
cent discoveries have proved that it is
a most common trouble indeed.
And the proof of this is, that most
diseases, perhaps 85 per cent, are
caused in the beginning by disorders of
the kidneys.
You can't be sick if your blood is
pure, free from kidney poison and dis-
ease-breeding germs.
Your kidneys should keep it so. That's
what they are there for. And as long
as they are well they perform their du-
ties with thoroughness and dispatch.
You are well when your kidneys are.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great
kidney remedy, will make your kidneys
well when they are sick.
Kidney trouble often comes from
overwork or overexertion. From ex-
posing them to cold and other weaken-
ing influences, from lifting or a strain,
worrying. From overeating or over-
drinking. All these things weaken
your kidneys and poisonous germs be-
gin to creep into your blood.

It is at just such times that Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root is needed.
When your kidneys are not doing
their work, the symptoms which prove
it to you are backache, headache, sedi-
ment in the urine, scalding irritation
in passing it, obliged to go often dur-
ing the day and to get up many times
at night; dizziness, Irregular heart,
bladder or uric acid troubles, rheuma-
tism, neuralgia, sleeplessness, nervous-
ness, irritability, sallow complexion,
bloating, dropsy, tired feeling, loss of
energy and ambition.
Swamp-Root is a vegetable remedy,
the great discovery of Dr. Kilmer (the
eminent kidney and bladder specialist),
and has truly marvelous restorative
powers over the kidneys.
You can set your whole system right
with Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root.
The best proof of this Is a trial, and
nothing could be fairer than the offer
to send a sample of this great discov-
ery for trial absolutely free to any ad-
dress.
To get the sample and a book that
tells more about this interesting sub-
ject, write to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Blng-
hamton, N. V., and mention that you
read this liberal offer In the San Fran-
cisco Daily Call.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root Is what you need, yon can
purchase the regular 50-cent or $1 gizes
at the drug stores.

moral courage of young Mr. Grant It
will not be a surpnse to know that h!s ''â 
Bilence is probably due to the fact that :
.the gentleman to whom he made the
proposition referred to is a resident of
this city. Reference would not be
n'iade to this were it not for the fact
that Mr. Grant has caused to be pub
lished in the Los Angeles .Record an
interview in which he denu-s having
made the proposition attributed to him.
While denying himself the pleasure of
making a denial to San Francisco
newspaper men, he has sought to in
fluence Bentlment in the southern part
of the Stale by giving utterance to a '
deliberate falsehood for the benefit of
the readers of a Los Angeles paper. So
much for Mr. Grant's courage and
veracity. Kuw for the facts In the
case.
The proposition attributed to Mr.
Grant was m.vie to John D. Spreckels.
Concerning it Mr. SpreckHs has this
to say:
"'Mr. Grant visited me at my office,
527 Market street, about a month ago.
He introduced the subject of the elec
tion of a United States Senator. He
talked of his candidacy and said that
;the only reason he wished to be elected
'Senator wns for the honor it would give
him. lie askt-d me to support his can
didacy urxi said that if I would do so
he would, if elected, serve only a year
or two and would then resign in my fa
vur. 1 told him that 1 was not seeking
the position, did not want it and would
not take it were it offered me wiih a
certificate of election. That ended the
matter, and Mr. Grant departed."
Here we have Mr. Grant's confession
of his own unworth. He has no desire
to serve the people of the State in
â whose borders he is practically a stran
ger. His only object in asking to be
'cent to the upper house of the Ameri
ican Congress is that he may thereby
claim the right to be called "Senator"
Grant. A worthy ambition, surely, and
fcne quite In keeping with the man who
"twill resort to falsehood to cover a re
iprehensible act. To achieve this noble
ambition this worthy son of his fattier
â was willing to barter his honor, the
confidence of the people and the friend-
Bhip of those deluded Individuals who
zÂ«re still unaware oÂ£ the fact that hÂ«m
;esty and integrity are not always
transmitted from father to son.
Some idea of the caliber of the man
.who comes from San Diego with a bi<l
for legislative votes because the acci
dent of birth happened to give him the
name of Grant may be given by the re
: lation of an incident that occurred in
the corridor of a San Diego hotel dur
! ing the progress of the recent cam
paign.
Grant was discussing the political sit
uation "with a group of politicians when
one of them asked the aspirant for Sen
.atorial honors if he expected members
, #f the Legislautre to vote for him just
because his naxne is Grant.
"That should have great weight with
them," replied the budding statesman.
"a very great weight, I should say.
especially in Washington."
'"That is wh<re you are wrong." said
his questioner, "because you are
spreading that idea and others are tak
ing it up. There is an old gentleman
in Sierra County whose name is George
"Washington. He is a lineal descend
ant. I believe, of the Father of His
Country. Mr. Washington has heard
of your claim and has come out as a
Senatorial candidate. He is Raining
.strength every day and it looks as
though he was going to be a big factor
Â«n the Senatorial fight."
"Is this a fact?" inquired Grant ex
citedly.
Upon being assured th..t the facts
v â !â â¢â  as represented he burst out with:
"You must excuse me, gentlemen. I
must ru;i upstairs and t^ll Milton
Green about this. If George Wash
ington is a candidate Mr. Green should
know it right away. I pay him $250 a
month to look after my political Inter
ests iiwi he will know how to deal with
this matter."
Just what Mr. Green told Mr. Grant
In the secrecy of their chamber will
never be known, but speculation con
cerning it did not lessen th- hilarity of
the group in the hotfÂ»l corridor.

poned Again â A Searching
Investigation Into the
Scandia Scandal.
Two English sailing vessels have been
purchased in San Francisco within thelast
few days. The four-masted ship Falls of j
Clyde Is now owned by William Matson j
and others, and the Star of Russia by J. J.
Moore & Co. Captain Anderson and the
English crew of the Falls of Clyde left
the vessel yesterday and will be sent to
England on other vessels by the BrltiÂ»h
Consul. The Star of Russia is now at
Port Townsend loading for Honolulu.
The Fails of Clyde arrived here from j
I/ondon with a general cargo on Novem- j
ber 18 last. After discharging she was
taken over to Sausallto and laid up as aj
charter could not bo obtained at reason
able rates. Her owners, the Ship Falls
of Clyde Company, Limited, have been j
trying to sell the vessel for some time, !
but as she was classed as one of the best )
of the English fleet and was in nrst-ciass ;
order a high figure was asked for her. j
There was in consequence considerable
negotiation before the sale was made.
The Falls of Clyde was built by Russell
& Co. of Port Glasgow, and is 1741 tons
net burden. She is 20G feet long, i 0 feet
broad and 23 feet 5 Inches deep. It* is said
that her new owners Intend talcing t!;e

her square rigged on the fore, main and

Jigger mast. She will go into the Hilo
trade under the same flag as the barks
Roderick Dhu and Santiago.
Before leaving England the Htar of
Russia was sold to Shaw, Saville & Co.
nnd came under that tlrm's flag to San
Francisco. Representatives of J. J. Moore
& Co. and Pope & Talbot looked the v-s
sel over with the intention of buying
her, but the figure could not be a;rreed
upon, so Captain Roberta took her to
Portland to load wheat for Europe. B<-- j

sel was ordered to Puget Sound to load]
HELD HER CLOTHES
FOR A PALTRY BILL
Dressmaker Petersen Kept the Waists
of Mrs, Bandmann's Gowns and
Now Wants Paument for Them,
MISS PETERSON IN HER GREAT COLLECTING ACT.
Mrs. Julius Bandmann lias been mad"? the victim of mispUoed kindnesses,
and her dressmaker, Miss Alice Peteraen, who owes to her her start In
business life, ha.s brought suit against her for a paltry bill of $155.
The suit was tried in Judge Qroezinger*s court and Judgment awarded
the plaintiff. Through her attorney, George T. Knight, Mrs. Bandmann
has appealed the ca-se and the suit will have a hearing; in ii higher court.
Mrs. Bandmann inserts that the Petersen claim is an illegal one, and as
it dates bark for more than two years and is outlawed, that the court
cannot take cognizance <>f the matter. According t<Â» Mrs,. Bandmann, $22
Is all that the dressmaker can Justly claim, and even that sum, she, says,
is nut honestly 'lu^, as the gowns for the making of which it represents
payments were not delivered.
"I received the skirts of those two gowns only," Mrs. Bandmann ex
plained, "and when 1 sent fur the waists I whs told that Miss Petersen had
If ft fur the East. On her return I went to her, thinking that the corsages
had been misdirected and wrongly delivered, and was confronted by the
iiiiKry rutuurierc, who declared she had them in her possession and would
not deliver them until I had paid her an old bill amounting to Jisr.. I
referred her to Mr.Bandmann for the old hill, hut she declined to negotiate
with him."
According to Mrs. Bandmann, the bill of HB> represents the making of
two gowns some two years ago. A week aft^r the gowns were finished Mrs.
Bandmann lost her daughter. and as she went into mourning had no use for
bright colored dresses. She allowed the frocks to remain with Miss Peter
sen. and asked the dressmaker to dispose of them for a price that would
cover the making. The demands of the dressmaker wore, however, so
exorbitant that do one would take the gowns complete at a figure that
merely represents the modiste's f*-e. After six months the gowns were re
turned to Mrs. Bandmann, and these are the dresses that the lady refuses to
give the cash equivalent for.
Miss Petersen. a tall, squarx*- faced woman, with a long reaching arm
ami supple fingers, says that her bill Is a just one and that she- has just
escaped the outlaw time.
"The bill dates back to December, IS9C," the dressmaker said, "and
so my suit was brought just in the nick of time. Mrs. Bandmann has always
given me a lot of trouble about her bills. 1 never collected but J2S from her,
and I got that In a very peculiar fashion. She owed me the money for a
long while, and I was finally obliged to go to her and explain that 1 needed
it to purchase furniture with. 'Why, I can let you have some furniture,'
said Mrs. iJandmann, and she sent me a three-legged bureau, a worm-eaten
whatnot and a table to match. 'How much is that furniture?" I asked the
lady. 'Twenty-eight dollars,' she said, and that Is all the money I ever got
out of her."
Mrs. Bandmann's friends are up In arms against what they declare to
he the outrageous treatment of the dressmaker. "Why, Mrs. Bandmann
started her in business," they say, "and went security for her in all the dry
goods houses of the city." Mrs. Bandmann only says, "Preserve me from
those who have enjoyed my bounty."

There was a peculiar incident on the
steamor Alameda while she was in Syd
ney. N. S. W. Among her cargo was a
large consignment of apples, and when
these came to be landed they were found
to be infected with the codlin moth. An
Investigation showed that the moths had
left the fruit and built their cocoons in
the boxes. The apples were accordingly
put In fresh boxes, and Captain Van
Oterendorp was told to take the old ones
with the codlin moths in them to sea and
throw them overboard. Another steamer
was going to sea at that time, so they
were put aboard of her, and when she
was outside of Sydney heads about ten
miles they were thrown overboard. The
boxes drifted up and down the coast,
some of them going ashore as far north
as Newcastle. X. S. W.. and for weeks the
papers were full of the wreck of a vessel
from San Francisco laden with general
merchandise. It was not until ihf vessel
which had taken the boxes to sea and
from which they were thrown overboard
reached her destination that the facts of
the case became known.

FOR HE WAS POOR
MRS. ALLISON, A RING, A GOLD

Fleeced by His Partner He Was
Thrown Into Jail ps a Default
ing Witness Against
Sharpers.
It is a mystery how John Scheek, hon
est and industrious worker In copper at
the I'nion Iron Works, arrived at old
age without the services of a guardian, if
a recent adventure of his be taken as a
sample of the manner in which he Invests
his earnings, lie has been in jail for the
past two weeks as a witness against
Grace Allison and her partner, the plaus
ible Mr. Bain, the managers and patentees
of a matrimonial bureau, warranted to
lighten the pockets of the hopeful pat
rons of the wares of Hymen. The precious
couple are- under indictments by Federal
and State Grand Juries for fraud, and
among their numerous victims was
Scheck.
Scheck is a vigorous man In the lusty
bloom of about tio years, and a few months
ago he thought it would be a good idea
to invest in a wife. So he called at the
matrimonial bureau and upon payment of
a fee of $o was introduced by Bain to
Mrs. Allison, whom Bain represented as a
wealthy widow, just dying to marry some
nice kind old man who would love her
for herself alone. Scheck was willing to
love her devotedly on these conditions,
and as an.evidence of the unselfishness of
his attentions he, at her suggestion very
delicately made, presented her with a dia
mond ring, the cost price of which was
$175. History does not record whether
Scheck received a chaste kiss from his
fiancee, but Scheck records with sorrow
that after the widow got the ring 1 on her
finger and found that he had no more
money to bestow upon her she announced
that she was tired of him and that he
would oblige her if he remained away.
Scheck iaise.l a row about the matter,
having been advised by his friends that
Mrs. Allison was a gold brick, and Bain
compromised the matter for $150.
Then Scheck met a stranger named Gus
Hall. Hall represented that he owned an
undeveloped gold mine on the Mexican
peninsula just below the town of Knsena
c!a. He (Hall) had been once bitten by a
syndicate and would have nothing more
to do with capitalists. He wanted some
honest, hard-working poor man to go in
with him. The ore exhibited by Hall was
assayed for Scheck's satisfaction and
showed a value of about $100 to the ton.
The mine was twenty feet from the ocean
hi ruling and there was an abundance of
abalone shells on the beach. They could
buy a vessel and haul shells and nuggets
to San Francisco and become wealthy in
a short time. Scheck invested his $li>o in
th<- purchase of the sloop Trilby of twelve
tons, and when he\went to go aboard he
found a woman and her baggage in the
cabin. She said that she was Hall's wife
and did not want to go, but Hall remarked
that he guessed he was the boss and she
would have to go.
At that juncture some one gave the au
thorities the tip that Sche.-k was trying
to leave the State for the purpose of
avoiding the prosecution of Bain and
Mrs. Allison and he was arrested and
thrown into jail, while Hall, with the bill
of sale made out in his own name start
ed away in the Trilby for his Mexican
mine. At Monterey one of the sailors of
the crew of two insulted Mrs. Hall and
there was a row, resulting in the return
or Mrs. Hall by rail to this city.
Last Saturday Scheck was served in jail
with a demand for $35 wages due the sailor
for one month's services, and this was
backed up with a paper purporting to
have been signed by Scheck. in which he
agreed to pay all the expenses of the trip
Bcheck denounces the paper as a forg-erv
aml now is in jail broke. Hall has disap"
pearcd with the Trilby and Scheck now
swears that he has been in jail so long
with drunken men and cranks that he has
lost his memory of the evil doings of the
Bain-Allison outfit.

REAL ESTATE
IS MARKED BY
PROGRESSION
A Marked Movement
in the Market.
ADVENT OF RAIN THE CAUSE
SEVERAL LARGE SALES OF
GRAIN LAND ARE MADE.
j*. Glance at the Records, Recent
Sales, . New Building Con
tracts â Realty
Notes.
With the advent of the long needed rain
and a decided change in the general at
mospheric conditions has come a revi
vification, as it were, in tne general re
alty market. Property values all o"Â»*r
the State will now have a tendency to
increase, particularly in the country,
where progress inevitably hinges on the
success of the crops.
"With a good year, which is now as
sured, comes the payment of mortgages
and the extension of building operations
and improvements, which give an in
creased value and complete reanimation
to the general market. Sales are already
becoming frequent, and several, in fact
many, are now in" process of negotiation.
Although in the large cities throughout
the State the absence and the lack of
rain is not felt as keenly as in the coun
try sections, still, if one looks around the
value of almost every article of commerce
can be seen to increase during a drought
and decrease markedly during a moist
season.
During the past week many sales of
good value were negotiated in the city,
but the record showed an unequal balance
compared to those made in the country.
Building operations were slow compared
I to those of last week, and the value of
I contracts was considerably lower.
I The aggregate value of mortgages ana
I trust deeds was uniform, while the rec
ord for releases and reconveyances was
unusually large.

WEDDED AMONG
THEIR FRIENDS
A Pretty Home Ceremony
Unites Miss Panno and
Walter Schranz.
The wedding of Miss Elmlra C. Panno
and Walter D. Schranz took place last
Wednesday evening, December 14, at the
residence of the bride's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Clarence Dickey, 1821 Oak street.
The house was beautifully decorated. Smi
lax hung from the chandeliers, and in the
bay window, where the ceremony was
performed, white doves, suspended, held
streamers of smilax and pink ribbon.
Back of these the windows were a bank
of ferns and pink carnations. The halls
and supper rooms were draped with red
ribbon and holly berries.
The ceremony was performed by Rev.
E. B. Church of Irving Institute, from
which seminary the bride is a graduate of
the class of 1836. Frank J. Waizman was
the best man and Miss Alice Emerson of
Stanford was maid of honor. While the
bridal party was entering the parlors Mrs.
Copping and Mrs. Pillsbury sang i'O
Promise Me."
The bride wore white moussellne de sola
over white taffeta and carried white roses.
She also wore the slippers her mother
wore at her own wedding twenty-five
years ago. Miss Emerson, the maid of
honor, wore pink mousseline de sole over
pink taffeta and carried pink roses.
After the wedding supper the newly
married couple went their way amid the
usual shower of rice and old shoes. They
will spend their honeymoon at Del Monte
and on their return will reside in this city,
where the groom is engaged in business.
The wedding presents received by the
happy couple were exceedingly beautiful |
and costly, and so numerous that one '
room would not hold them all, thereby
attesting the popularity of the bride.
Among those present were: Mr. and Mrs.
Louis Schranz, Mr. and Mrs. Clarence
Dickey, Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Brownell,
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo Keil, Mr. and Mrs.

DR. WURTH'S OPINION
OF THE NEW DISCOVERY IN MEDI-*
CINE
A Remarkably Successful Remedy for
Dyspepsia, Indigestion and Stomach
Troubles.
Dr. Wurth, in commenting on recent
discoveries in medicine, said: There la
none which Is certain to be so valuable
and far reaching in benefit as Stuart's-
Dyspepsia Tablets, the new stomach
remedy; I say far reaching, because
people little realize how important, a
sound stomach and vigorous digestion
is to every man, woman and child.
Indigestion is the starting point of
consumption, heart disease, Blight's
disease, diabetes, nervous prostration,
liver troubles; why is this so? > Simply
because- every nerve, muscle and tissue
in our bodies is created and nourished
from the food we eat. If that food is,
by reason of a, weak stomach, compelled
to He for hours, a sour, fermenting
mass of half digested food, it poisonu .
ihe blood and nervous system, creates
sas which distends the stomach "and"
bowels, causing pressure on the heart, '
lungs and other organs, and seriously
impeding their action.
He says further, the point to direct
attention is not the nerves, nor heart,
nor lungs, nor kidneys, but the stom-
ach, the first cause of all the mischief
The remedy to use for indigestion and
weak stomachs is ; not some cathartic
but a remedy which will digest the
food, Increase the flow of gastric juice,'
absorb the gases, and Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets will accomplish exactly this
result in any case of stomach trouble,
because these tablets are composed of
the digestive acids, aseptic pepsin, 4
Golden Seal and bismuth, pleasant to
taste, and not being a patent medicine,
can be used by anybody with perfect |
safety. I believe Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will cure any form of indiges- '
tion and stomach trouble except cancer
of stomach. x - 1 . . ; â¢; : , \

sia Tablets, are sold by druggists at 50

BIG MISTAKES
Deane Gains a Thou
sand Votes.
OFFICIAL CANVASS FINISHED
A. GENEROUS BUNCH. OF CON- '
TESTS PROMISED.
Commissioners Will Meet To-Day to '
Formally Declare the Result
of the Novembar
Election.
Th* nffk-U] roum of the municipal vote
nt the last election was finished yester
day, ami although It has not yet heen
p.nr.oimeed, the figures are ready for pub
lication.
The. most startling change mad* in the
figures, turned in with the Beml-offlcial
re-turns is in the vote for John A. Brown.
Democratic candidate for County Clerk.
Mr. Brawn lost just 054 votes by the ca*n- !
vass of the Commissioners, and there is
no one to explain how so large a mistake
was ever made. Michael Meagher. the
Democratic candidate, who was defeated
for the Recorder's desk by A. C. Berthier,
pained n8 votes, and \ .U contest the
seating: of his i oponent.
The half-dozen disappointed ones who
fire intending to file contests discovered I
yesterday that the forty days which the
law gives them to begin action will expire
on ther Friday ar Saturday, which day j
is just at present a question among the j
lawyers, ami tba.t it was the intention of
the Commissioners not to announce the
result of the official canvass until Thurs- !
day afternoon. As it will take them three ]
(tays to reparÂ« the papers necessary to ]
their action*, th^y saw plainly that the |
legal limit W...U.1 expire before they were !
ready and their chance of getting into j
office ' thrtmglr the courts would be lost.
They k-i.c.,1 >.i or lan'a office, and;
finally prevalfed" upon him to arrange for j
a meeting of the commission to-day, when
the vote wiLl be orficially announced and j
thÂ»? lucky ones declared elected. The i
fount of the vote on unexpired terms has
been put off until next Tuesday, and the i
shortendcrs have entered a vigorous kick !
against being thus bunkoed out of Ihelr i
olJlces.

RIFLE FOR THE SHERIFF.
Mrs, Himmelman Would Not Be Separated.
From Her Children,
DEPUTY SHERIFFS GALLAND AND APPEL had an exciting time
yesterday endeavoring to gain possession of the two children of Dr.
A. A. McLean, who have all their lives been in the custody of their
mother, Mrs. Himmelman, and although they did not know it until
danger was past, the two officers were in imminent peril of coming In
contact with a loaded Winchester In the hands of a mother goaded to
desperation at the thought of parting from her little orifs.
The trouble Is an old on<\ About ten years ago Mrs. McLean ob
tained a divorce from her husband on the ground of extreme cruelty. She
married again, but the union was not a happy one, and since being sep
arated from her second husband, she has been living in a flat at 112 Oai
street. McLean wanted possession of the children and finally obtained an
order of court giving them into his care. In his application he alleged
that his wife was not a proper person to care for the children and agreed
to educate them if placed in his care.
Yesterday afternoon the deputy sheriffs, armed with papers giving
them authority to break into the house, if necessary, started out to get
the children. They rang the bell repeatedly, but could get no response.
Galland suspected a trick and made a flank movement. Ife gut around
to the back of the house just in time to see Florence, the elder of the
two, leaving the place by the back door. He gave chase, but she led
him three blocks before he could catch her. The child commenced sobbing
wildly and Galland brought her back to the house. The mother was
watching from the front door and at. once admitted the officers. She
clasped the sobbing child to her arms and declared that they would never
be separated. No trace of the other girl could be found.
The officers at once proceeded to take Florence to a private school on
California street and the mother declared her intention of accompanying
them*. She was granted permission and on the way Informed Gal] and and
Appel that had they broken in the door before the children bad been
smuggled out the back way she would have received them with a loaded
Winchester. The child was installed in the school, but the mother refused
to leave it. She finally consented to do so, but In the meantime had
cleverly thrown off the automatic latch. The officers left the house and
Mrs. Himmelman followed them. The ladies inside, not knowing that the
lock had been tampered with, thought all was well. They went back into
the sitting room and tried to comfort little Florence. Two minutes later,
Mrs. Himmelman, who is a powerfully built woman, walked in and took
the child away. No trace could be found of the younger child, and she is
probably well out of the city by this time.
The children some time ago were given into the care of Mrs. Dwinelln
of Oakland, the widow of the late Judge Dwinelle, and by her with the

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 21, IS9B.
REV. DR. STEBBINS VERY ILL.
The WelMnown Divine Stricken With Heart
Failure Yesterday Morning.
REV. DR. HORATIO STEBBIXS. pastor of the- First L'nitarian Church
of this city and one of the regents of the University of California, is
seriously ill at his home, 1600 Larkin street. Heart failure is the com
plaint. Early yesterday morning he suffered an attack which great
ly alarmed his family and the few Immediate friends who were notified. Dr.
C. N. Eilir.wood was summoned, and the case was by him regarded as so
serious that Dr. Gibbons was sent for. Neither of the physicians would
give particulars of their patient further than that the case was serious.
During the day a number of anxious friends call? d to inquire as to
tl c health of Dr. Stebbins. and in spite of the efforts of the family not to
alarm the members of the doctor's church, the sad news spread rapidly
and caused much anxiety in all parts of the city. For the past thirty
years Dr. Stei,i>ins lias been well known here, for in addition to his church
work he has been identified with many reform and progressive movements.
His first vocation in life was that of a schoolteacher, but he gave up that
profession and studied for the church, choosing the Unitarian creed.
Upon the death of Dr. Starr King in ISG3 Dr. Stebbins was called from the
East to fill his pulpit, a place in which he has remained ever since.
Dr. Stebbins is now 88 years of age. H<; \v;.~ born In Massachusetts.
At 12 o'clock Dr. ESHlnwood went to bed, confident that his patient would
rest easily tor. the remainder of the night. At tha.t time he consld* ued
that Dr. StebbCns had rallied somewhat from the first force of the stroke.,
but was still in a very serious condition.
CLEAR WEATHER TO-DAY
Forecaster Hammon Says the Rain
Has BeÂ«n General in the
North.
Weather Forecaster Hammon, who i 9
at Mount Tamalpais station, telephoned
down from there last night at G o'clock
that the conditions were favorable for
clear weather for Wednesday. Th,- storm
which had Its- center off the- Washington
coast had reached the Salinas Valley and
that arid region was visited with a wel
come downpour. There was also a trace
at San Luis Obispo. To-day it will be
partly cloudy in the southeast portion of
Northern California, but the storm has
about spent its force.
Rain has fallen almost everywhere
north of the Tehachapi, except near the
summit, where it snowed. The storm
came very near leaving Monday evening,
but it returned and gave an additional
.32 of an inch in this city, making a total
of 1 inch for the last rainfall. The. re
turn of the storm was made easy by the
driving away of the high pressure on the
plateau region between the Rockies and
the Sierras. Conditions are better than
ever now, for if a storm should make its
appearance it would come in without the
hindrance of the high pressure.
The rain baa benefited pasturage and
enough fell in the Sacramento Valley to
start plowing. Much good to newly sown
grain will also result and the ground has
been considerably moistened by the down
pour.
Catherine Larkin's Will.
The will of Catherine Larkin, who died
in this city on October 20 last, was filed
for probate yesterday. At the time of her
death Mrs. Larkln was possessed of real
estate valued at $13,000, encumbered by a
mortgage of $6500. The concluding pro
vision, or, rather, request, in the will is
worthy of mention. Decedent directs that
after all debts and funeral expenses are
paid her remains are to be Interred be
side the remains of her husband and re
quests "that the outside box over my cof
fin be of green redwood lumber, made of
two boards nailed together, one over the
other, and that a mass be said at my fu
neral." The will bequeaths ?500 to John
Valley of Mendocino County, $500 to John
McCann, $500 to Lillian McCann, $1000 to
Mrs. Mary Rock and $1500 to Mrs. Cath
erine Larkin of Watsonville. The residue
of the estate is disposed of in bequests
of $100 to several relatives and friends.
WATSON HAS LEFT TOWN.
Disappears and His Creditors Know
Not His Whereabouts.
Wlllard S. Watson has left the- city and
there are said to be certain people who as
a consequence are- trying to rigure out
how much they are out of pocket. Me
left the Palace on Sunday, but failed
to leave any intimation of his future
whereabouts. It is said that he is In the
State, and those who ifcnow him best uo
not credit the theory that he has made
away with himself, for the reason that
they have confidence in Watson and ex
pect that he- will return and make pood
all that he owes. Watson is well known
here aud in XÂ« w York. He first came to
California about nine years ago, accom
panied by his valat and secretary.. He al
ways made it a rule to spend several
weeks at all of the prominent resorts,
and he made lavish use of his money.
On one of his visits to Monterey he bought
some fine trotting horses, which he took
back to New York with him.
Watson Is 27 years of age, and has a
brother George in New York, who is a
member of Watson & Co., in Nas
sau street. The two brothers \ver. left
a million about ten years ago by their
grandmother, and Willard did the spend
ing act. Two years ago he went to Eu
rope, accompanied by a woman from New
York. The tv.o led a gay life in the va
rious capitals on the Continent, and when
they returned Wlllard's family, to check
his wild career, took charge of his af
fairs. When he came out here this sea
son he seemed to be more stinted in the
use of his money. He lost all of in.s
personal effects in the Baldwin fire and a
large' sum of money. In the replacing of
his wardrobe he made a number of bills,
and to tide over his pressing needs he is
said to have borrowed from his friends
who knew him in his palmy days. It i' 3
presumed that his obligations became
warm, and that he skipped out until such
a time as he can get nis affairs in shape
to make good what he owes. He left no
bill at the Palace, and his effects were in
such a state that it was expected that he
would return.
A friend of Watson's says his brother
in New York will meet all of his oblig-a
ttons, even if Watson does not. He- be
lieves that he is still in the State.

HEARD ALL THE
EVIDENCE
THAT WAS ALL
No Indictments for the
School Board.
INVESTIGATION A FARCE
THE GRAND JURY WILL DIS
BAND NEXT WEEK.
Stanton Turns the Tables on Ragan
With a Warrant of Arrest
for Soliciting a
Bribe.
Nothing more than failure has emerged
from the cloud of dust kicked up by the
Grand Jury In its investigation into the
alleged crookedness of the Board of
Education. The multitudinous charges
brought against -the School Directors
have been either disproved or have fallen
of themselves for the want of testimony .
that was more than morally convincing.
The blow that finally put the jury out
was the failure to lind any evidence cor
roboratrve of that which was laid before
it on Monday afternoon by ex-Teacher
E. D. Stanton of the Business Evening
School.
Stanton's assault was directed mainly
against Director Ragan, whom he ac
cused of having solicited a bribe, but his
evidence uncorroborated carried little
weight for the reason that he has already
furnished to the public two affidavits and
a confession, each, of which contradicted
th<3 utlu-r. Finding no more solid founda
tion for the charges made, the Grand
Jury adjourned yesterday until next
wetk, when it will present its report and
ask Judge Belcher's permission to ad- i
journ.
Yesterday's proceedings held the jury
at the District attorney's office until a
late hour last evening. There were only
seven witnesses examined.- although tit-
Ceen had been subpena-ed. -Dr. Ragan
himself was the principal witness of trie
day. He came before the jury loaded down
with papers, affidavits and newspaper
clippings, which dealt in no favorable
manner with Stanton's record in different
sections of the State. Director Ragan
was on the carpet for nearly an houi,
and during that time denied that ho iiad
ever solicited $20y or any sum from
Stanton as the price of a position in ihe
Business Evening School. He also de
nied tha-t he or any agent of his had
given Stanton $C'J with which to llee
to British Columbia. He declared Stan
ton a liar, and brought to bear as proof
a number of. telegrams and letters in
which he claimed the ex-teacher had
sought to induce him to forward him
money. Stantou wafl not recalled by the
jury, "nor was Professor KilpatricQi.
Among other witnesses who wene. called
was Sol Campi, a money broker, and
Teachers V. O. Huskey, Mrs. Mulven,
Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Williams. Miss
Lan Frail' hi was not summoned, as the
jury considered none of her charges tan
Â° After Dr. Ragan had finished his testi
mony the witnesses who still remained to
be heard were dismissed and the jrjry ad
journ. -d without finding indictments in
any of the matters that have come before
it since the counts found against Peter
McGlade. and as soon as Stanton heard
of it he sought out Judge Low and swore
to a complaint charging Ragan with so
liciting a bribe. Stanton himself appeared
earlier in the day to answer to tne
charges of extortion upon which he uad
been arrested on Monday evening at the
instance of Ragan, and succeeded in get
ting a postponement of the case until to
day. , .
Last evening Ragan surrendered him
self to the police. He was at once released
on his own recognizance by order of
Judge Mogaii; '
Bidders Had No Chance.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
judgment of the Superior Court of Ala
meda. County in the case of the California
Improvement Company against George D.
Reynolds and wife. The action was
brought to recover a sum claimed to be
(in.' lor s Street assessment. In the
1, wr court the company won its suit.
The higher court bases its revisal upon
the questionable power given to the
Street Superintendent. Reynolds set up
the plea that then- was not conspicuous
notice given to the advertising of the con
tract, but this was passed by the court
as not of sufficient strength to warrant a
revisal. Thr contract specified the size
of the rock to be used in the work and
permitted "a smaller percentage of fine
material consequent upon the crushing of
the mck." Upon this the court states:
"Under, this specification the superintend
ent was at liberty, after thy contract had
been entered into, to determine or vary
the amount of fine material to be used,
and it was therefore impossible for bid*
dan to di! ermine in advance the cost of
doing the work, and competition in bid
ding was therefore restricted."
Stuart Robson tells how to win
success on the stage in next Sunday's
Call.

DRIED FRUIT IN NEW YORK.
THE MARKET IS STEADY ENOUGH, BUT
LACKS LIFE.
The New York Commercial says of the dried
fruit and raisin markets:
'There does not appear to be the life in the
dried fruit market dealers would like to see.
There is no stocking i:p nor buying for future
delivery, and business is confined wholly to
the satisfaction of present wants of distrib
utors, who are supplying retail trade. Mail
orders are not numerous, and such as do
come are principally for lots to flil broken
stocks.
"Prunes are steady, but there is no great
demand. The request for large s!z>t> seems to
be smaller for the moment, and inasmuch as
there are few more to be had, it Is quite as
well for the trade as a whole. All large sizes
are gone from Washington and Oregon and
California has had none of consequence. Buy
ers â will be obliged to take medium sizes in
the future, but at preei they are Indifferent
and apparently do not care lo make further
purchases for either prompt or future deliv
ery. Considerable quantities of medium sizes
and a few large ones are coming forward, but
they are principally on orders placed pre
viously. No dealer has made any large pur
chases recently.
"In raisins there is no change. Clusters ap
pear to be In stronger demand, but the call
for them is not as large as usual at thti sea
son. Even though it is generally understood
that all supplies now on the coast are held
by the association, which guarantees prices,
buyers apparently do not care. They are tak
ing no additional supplies. The dealers who
bought freely of four crowns early in the sea
son are trying to dispose of them at whatever
they will bring. The Shading has created
something of an uneasy feeling in the market,
but it is said that supplies thus held are com
paratively small and that the trade will not
suffer materially in consequence. Meanwhile
there Is a better feeling In foreign raisins,
though no large orders are reported.
"There Is little change in the currant situa
tion. It is definitely announced from Wash
ington that no change will be made in the
tariff. This saves the California industry from
annihilation and prevents any reduction In
present quotations. There is some expectation
that the Greek Government will secure free
admission Into Russia within a short time,
â which Will afford an outlet for practically all
â supplies now held and will have the effect of
greatly strengthening the market.
"Apricots re firm and difficult to obtain.
All Indications point to a rising market but
possibly the change will not come Imme
diately. s^pnt stocks are small and supplies in
first hands are less than usual at this time.
"Peaches are firm. No change In price is
recorded, though there seems to be a feeling
that prices will advance as soon as stock
taking is over and dealers begin replenishing
Stock."

purchasers of Federal Steel, while the purchase
of Atchlson was made in the hope of some fa
vorable action at , to-morrow's directors' meet-

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Dec. With a weak Liverpool
market and rather liberal local aad Northwest
receipts to contend with, bulls In wheat were
badly handicapped at the opening. Liverpool
failed utterly to follow yesterday's advance
here and on the contrary showed early declines
of J ,4@ftc, probably because of the increase of
3,800,000 bushels In American stocks. Buying
orders at the start were very few and far be
tween. May opened V*c lower at 67Vi!&67%c.
This price prevailed for a short time, when the
strength shown by the coarser grain market
encouraged buyers and caused a little scattered
covering by local shorts. The total amount bid
for was small, but in the almost stagnant con
dition of the market it was sufficient to cause
a reaction in the May price to 67% c. Then the
market - weakened again. All outside markets
were weaker than Chicago. New York re
ported a very Black foreign demand. As the
foreign demand has been the big prop of the
market In times of liberal recelpti, â¢ reports of
this nature had the effect of contracting the
speculative demand, and prices once more
slowly slid, off, and before. 11:30 May had
reached 67Hc The selling pressure at no time
was heavy, but there. was at times an entire
absence of bids. Bradstreet's report of â¢ the
world's visible supply, showing an increase of
5,390,000 bushels, took away what little back
bone the market had left, and late trading was
all In favor of the bears. May r-.nally got down
to C6?4@67c, and closed at 674f67V4c
Corn was rather quiet but steady. The fea
ture of the market was the large direct export
business, almost a million bushels. This and
the firm cables and wet weather made the
market very firm at times. The weakness oÂ£
wheat and the rather poor quality of corn re
ceipts adversely affected the market later and
a slight advantage was lost. May closed a
shade lower. Oats were fairly active and ir
regular. May was firm early, helped by corn
and the wet weather. December was weak and
was offered at somewhat under May without
takers. It was apparent the December short
Interests were liquidated. May closed -Â»Â»c
lower.
The market for provisions was decidedly nar
row. Around the opening some easiness was
shown, hog prices being lower and packers
showing a disposition to press sales. The
strength of corn helped the market some. Trad
ing was almost at a standstill late in the day.
and prices dropped again, the market being
heavy at the close. May pork closed unchanged,
lard 5c lower and ribs a shade lower.

THE RAISIN MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dec. 20.â Journal of Com
merce says: Although it is generally under
etood that the principal object aimed at by
the California Raisin Growers' Association is
to put the business on a profitable basis, so
every one interested in It. from grower to re
tail distributor, may make a reasonable profit,
the radical changes proposed by tha associa
tion with that end in view do not Â«eem to
meet with favor in all quarters, owing to the
fact, as stated by some of the principal dis
tributors of goods here, that commission mer
chants and others who market goods in the
East have already had a wide experience with
packing producers and found results unsatis
factory. It was not until the commercial
packers took hold and graded fruit properly,
according to representative handlers here, that
business became systematized, with resulting
confidence on the . parr of the ' Eastern . trade,
which enabled the carrying on of business .with,
: a reasonable certainty as to the future. Ac
! cording to one of the principal commission mer
chants it la one thing to buy - well-known
brands from responsible packers and another
j to buy an unknown quantity produced by a
! comparatively inexperienced element. The fact
that the association has put out two kinds of
raisins this â graded and ungradedâ
led to some unpleasant complications, we un-
I derstand,' as some unscrupulous dealers, it is
charged, have scraped the marks off boxes
designating ungraded as "Pacific" and have
substituted this stock for repacked graded
I goods. This, it is intimated, has been made
possible by tho fact that *in ' some Instances
grade goods have gone out without the In
spector's stamp, though that is not positively
asserted. Large handlers In the principal mar
kets are not likely to be deceived by the sub
stitution of ungraded for rraded ralalns, . but
offerings of these Inferior , goods as best at
lower prices than prime fruit can be marketed
at has an unsettling Influence and causes a
good deal of trouble for those who offer stock
only for what It Is represented to be by thÂ«
association.

BY CORPORAL FRED A. HEALY.
Fpecial Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Nov. 12.â Rumors of all sorts
of trouble with France, Russia, Ger
many and any other old power float
among the soldiery down here as thick
ly strewn on the tide of conversation
ag refuse on the Pasig River. "We hear
that 6000 men are now on their way to
reinforce us and that more are to come
In the near future. All this may be so
or it may not be so. The First Cali
fornia may have to take the field at any
moment or it may remain in garrison
until the end of its two-year term of
enlistmentâ all these future events are
mere possibilities and as uncertain as
the loveof a Filipino coquette. Tho boys
are sure of only one thingâ that they
have good quarters for the time being
and, whether they remain where they
BOW are for ten minutes or ten months,
they are going to get as much pleasure
out of their habitat as possible and sur
round themselves with all the comforts
jxuries known at home which are
' capable of crude imitation down in this
Go<f-forsaken island.
I "nsequent upon this determination
there have sprung up within the con
fines of our barracks various Industries
which cater to either the cleanliness, |
the conceit or the appetite of the regi- !
ment at so much per cater. Each one j
of these industries does a thriving busi- i
ness and adds not a little to the month- \
ly income of its owner or owners. A j
peculiar thing to be noted in connec- j
tlon with these evidences of American i
j rogressiveness is the fact that, in nine '
- out of ten, a man will take up a
business and do well at an employment
that he has never touched before in his 'â 
and which is entirely foreign to !
hing he has ever before experi- \
Thus the first laundry in camp was
rted by Tom Sullivan of Company ,
prominent member of the Cosmos !
â iher clubs, known at home for his j
shrewd business ability and as one of
the city's bon vivants. Sullivan's ex- i
ample has been followed by a lawyer
and an electrician in Company D and
by a theological student in Company
H. Each of these four laundries does
a rushing business, notwithstanding
the Filipino competition they are
obliged to meet.
There are already two bootblack :
stands within the regimental quad
rangle presided over by a medical stu
dent and a former bookkeeper, re
spectively, while a third is in process
of construction and will soon be oper

was a lily of the valley, leaving to
others the tasks of weaving and spin- i
ning.
A pie oven is in course of construc
tion and that thoroughly American del
icacy will soon grace the company
board, if the companies come up with
the requisite amount of dinero.
One regular tailor shop and about
twenty individual concerns, consisting
in each case of from one to three men

Journalists are counted by the hundred.
No previous experience in the news
paper office Is at all necessary. All a
man has to do is to pay for printing
and his paper is started. What he has
printed is a secondary consideration.
This applies to those journals outside of
military circles even more than those
whose editorial criticisms are circum
scribed by gold braid and stripes.
A magazine is being started by some
of the boys in C Company and will put
forth its first issue next week. One of
the proprietors told me yesterday that

The contemplated prizefight, of which
I wrote in a former letter, came off
yesterday afternoon and was a regula

lof its moneys worth. A good pro-
I gramme had been arranged, but vari
| ous causes combined to upset it com
â  pletely. To commence with two of th^
princlpal men were missing, owing to
d< :ith -McMurry of the Colorados hav
inff been drowned while swimming in
the I'asig and Cook of the California*
j having died from dysentery. Jones was
substituted for Cook and Richards took
McMurry*B place. The preliminaries
did not amount to a row of pins, savins
in the case of Porter, a former member
; of the Manhattan Athletic Club, who is
a very clever man and would have put
up a good scrap if he had been let
! alone.
When the first event was called Mona
han's second appeared and announced
that his man refused to go on until he
received his money. He was told that
I the purse was in the hands of an Ex
i aminer representative, whereupon he
j became more steadfast than ever in his
j determination not to fight unless paid.
; The event was then declared off. Mona
: han has attended baseball games at
| home.
The second event was started and
promised to be lively. The provost
marshal saw this and at once had it
stopped. He did not want the soldiers
brutalized by the sight of blood.
The third event was progressing j
[ splendidly when one man clasped his
stomach and claimed a foul a la Shark

the decision given to Cavanagh. the
man accused of having committed the
fottL This finished the first great sport
ing event in Manila and the spectators
âSpaniards and Americans, Filipinos
and Chinese, soldiers and civilians, pri
vates and non-coms, line and staff offi
cers â filed out in a trance, grasping for
the large Mexican silver dollars that
had formerly rested in the pockets of
their jeans.
But to turn from tales of carnage to
the more alluring delights of domestic
ity. The boys are now, for the first
time since their departure, comfortably
quartered, well-clothed andâ well,
I'll say nothing of the food. They oc
cupy the barracks on the east side of
the river near the suspension bridge,
which in ante-bellum days were used to
house the Infantaria Marina, Spain's
crack infantry regiment. The quarters
are large, airy and comfortable. Each
man has a bed (something to be ap
preciated when one has been for
months sleeping in mud or on anything
from a cobble stone to a bamboo) and
a mosquito net. The latter article is
well nigh indispensable in this country,
where the number of asserted species of
bugs and insects is only excelled by
the number of different species of chil
dren. Connected with the barracks is
a bathing house containing seventeen
showers and four immense tubs. This
is a perfect godsend, as we have more
than felt the want of proper bathing
facilities ever since we first landed in
Cavite. The boys fairly revel in the
' showers, so much so that there is hard
ly a fellow in the regiment who takes
not, at least, two or more baths a day.
The people at home have heard of the
patience, courage, constancy and other
soldierly qualities of the regiment
which they sent forth to uphold the
honor of their nation and their State.
â¢: There is another side to the regiment
' equally replete with honor to the dcoplo
it represents. The estimation in which
a regiment is hold can bo largely judged
from the position which is assigned to
it, everything else being equal. There
are nearly 14,000 troops now in garrison
here. Some regiments are represented
:in one department of this semi-civil
government, some in another. The Cal
ifornia boys are everywhere.
Their colonel, at present acting as
commander of the First Brigade, is the
president of the military commission
created for trying the most imr>ortant
cases against the United States Gov
ernment, such as sedition, treason, con
spiracy, etc. Two other officers of the
regiment sit with him on the commis
sion.
The general court martial, to which
; come all the cases of our division, has
â  sitting In judgment six FirÂ£t California
j officers, with .. president in the person
i of Lieutenant Colonel Duboce. at pres
, ent acting as colonel of the resriment.
The postoffice Is under the charge of
Lieutenant Seeley, who marches under
the banner of the bear. With him are
several more Californians.
The entire school and cemetery de-
I partments are taken care of by our
: chaplain. Father McKinnon.
The sanitary department, whose work
can be noticed from day to day in the
I improved condition of the streets and
j cleanliness, which is extending on all
; sides and which employs about 1000
men and makes use of a hundred carts
i and half as many barges, is superin
tended by Lieutenant Tobln. formerly
of the San Francisco health office.

â who come under the frown of justice.
Lieutenant James H. Jordan is chief
architect. In the office of the Collector
of the Port, in the custom house, in the
Board of Health, in the Captain of the
Port's office, in the commissary, in the
quartermaster's, in fact in all places
which need men of education and intel
ligence representatives of the First Cal
ifornia Volunteers will be found. En
listed men as well as officers attest by
the excellence of their work the high
standard their regiment has assumed.
Twenty-five men from Company B,
under the command of Lieutenant
Ramra, have been assigned as a guard
at the lighthouse of Pandacan. They
will be relieved in turn by details from
other companies.
Last Sunday Colonel Smith and all of
the officers not on duty took a trip to
the head of the Pasig River and acro&s
the immense fresh water lake at its
head, from which it has it 3 source.
The trip was undertaken with the dual
idea of obtaining a little relaxation
and affording the officers a chance to
acquaint themselves with the lay of
the country in case they have occasion
to look after Mr. Aguinaldo in that pun
of Luzon. The trip was an entire suc
cess and much information was ob
tained which will be invaluable in Case
we are forced to undertake a cam
paign.
Dr. O'Brien, having performed his oik
month of service in the smallpox hos
pital, has once more returned to the de
lights of Manila life and is quartered
with the Oregonians, whose surgeon
has been ordered to take Dr. O'Brien's
place in the hospital. I understand th^i
a surgeon from each command will lake
a month uf this unpleasant and danger
ous duty in turn.
Canteens have been established in
the regiment. They are two in number,
tastefully fitted with a large room and
a long bar for the men and a smaller
private room for the officers. Canteen
checks are issued to the men in an*
amount up to $5 and are charged
against them on payday when their
salaries are drawn. Tho boys each
take a turn at tending bar and wljen
the regiment returns home there will
be no lack of experienced "mixers" in
San Francisco. All sorts of liquor, both
hard and soft, is sold, cigara and
tanned goods are likewise obtainable.
In fact most anything one needs can be
obtained at the canteen, from a brandy
and soda or a box of blaokin? to v.
bobtailed monkey or a wai of spiritual
grace.
Company dining rooms have been es
tablished throughout the entire bar
racks, so now the boys who once ate
their hard tack and drank their coffee
while sitting in three inches of water
and mud experience the luxury of sit
ting on benches and eating from plates
which are white, though plain, placed
on boards which atone by their
smoothness and cleanliness for the lack
of a table cloth.
To sum up the situation in a few
words, we are as comfortable as cir
cumstances will permit and well pro
vided for in every way, save in the mat.
ter of food, which is abominable.
Before I close I must touch on one
subject which I would fain pass by and
which I have purposely left to the last
owing to the reluctance with which I
speak of it at all. I mean that portion
of the news which relates to the sick,
the dying and the dead.
Ercry precaution that humanity can
suggest is taken; every result that
science can achieve has been accom
plished, yet the hospitals are crowded
to their utmost capacity and the burial
ground continues to increase the num
ber of its headstones day by day.
Since my last article two more of rmr
regiment have been mustered out for
ever and others are hourly awaiting
the orders which will summon them to
their eternal home. The two deaths I
refer to are those of Sergeant Charles
Lemon of Company B and Private W.
D. Cook of Company F.
Sergeant Lemon was an old National
Guardsman and probably one of the
best known members of that organiza
tion in the city. He entered the First
California at the time of the reorgani
zation as a private; was made a corpor
al shortly before the call came for vol
unteers and was promoted to the rank
of sergeant during the present cam
paign. He was well known in business
circles at home and his death will be
greatly felt on the borderland of two
seas.
Private Cook was an excellent sol
dier, a good comrade and a man. He
was a crack athlete and one of the last
men we expected to lose through ill
ness. Both deaths were directly due
to that dysentery which has carried
off so many of our boys.
It is a strange fact that Death in
recruiting his ranks seems able to
choose and have his call responded to
by the- very best among us. In almost
every case those to go were the ones
we could least afford to spare. It mat
ters not whether Death's summons
comes in the shape of conflict, accident
or disease, it is invariably answered
by the very flower of our chivalry.
Hcrmita Hospital, which was
started by Colonel Smith and Dr. Mc-
Carthy, is doing splendid work under
the supervision of Dr. Farrell. It is
an ideal place for convalescents, and
the care taken of our boys who are sent
there is manifested by the condition in
which they are returned to their com
panies.
In connection with Dr. Farrell and
the work he has done down here. I hope
The Call will do him the .justice to
mention his services on the night of the
battle of Malate. In all the reports I
have seen of that affair he seems to
have been entirely overlooked. On the
night of July 31 Dr. Farrell had entire
charge of the field medical staff. Ex
posing himself with an utter disre
gard for his own safety he accom
plished the duties entrusted to him so
well that within an hour after the fir
ing had ceased there remained not a
single wounded man who had not been
attended to. In pursuance of his duty.
Dr. Farrell went further than he was
obliged to, and the hottest portion of
the fight found, him attending to the
wounded on the very top of the
trenches.
Owing to the crowding of the Red
Cross and other convalescent hospitals.
a number of our sick have been sent
aboard the Scandla'to recuperate on
the health-giving sea breezes that
sweep in from the ocean. Amnn" these
patients was Lieutenant Fred Dohr
mnn, our regimental quartermaster.
who has now returned to us looking as
strong and fit as a three-year-old, and
with not a trace of the dread typhoid
left to remind him of the narrow es
cape he had from death.

NEW ARMY BILL
House Military Commit
tee So Decides.
THE VOTE ON PARTY LINES
MINORITY WILL ALSO MAKE
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS.
Hull's Plan of Reorganization Is Ap
proved, but Many Changes in
Various Departments
Are Made.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 20.â The House
Committee <yÂ» Military Affairs com
pleted consideration of the army re
organization bill to-day and ordered it
reported to the House. The most im
portant changes made to-day were
those fixing fifty years as the age limit
for the appointment to the several staff
corps, and adding a new provision for
100 army dentists, with the rank of first
lieutenants.
Many changes in rank were made in
the staff corps, in the judge advocate
general's office the number of colonels
being fixed at five instead of two, as
first proposed. Provision also was made
that new appointees be given the lower
places. In the Quartermaster's Depart
ment the colonels were reduced from
ten to eight and the places of lower
rank increased. In the Commissary De
partment the force is increased ma
terially from that first contemplated,
particularly in the lower grades, the
captains being increased from twenty
seven to thirty-seven. There is an in
crease in rank in the Engineer Depart
ment, the lieutenant colonels being in
creased from fifteen to twenty, majors
from twenty-five to thirty-six and cap
tains reduced from fifty-seven to forty
one. In the Ordnance Department the
changes are toward the increase in
officers of higher rank. The provision
allowing 25 per cent extra pay for serv
ice in outlying islands was made to in
clude Alaska.
The age limit of fifty, which had been
fixed for appointment to the Judge Ad
vocate, Quartermaster's, Commissary
and Pay departments, was amended so
that the age limit will not apply to
those who served in the civil war or
the Spanish war or to officers now in
the regular army.
A new section was inserted making
the chief of the record and pension of
fice a brigadier general, with an as
sistant having the rank of lieutenant
colonel. Section 18 of the Hull bill was
struck out entirely. It limited the age
of appointees as second lieutenants un
der the provison of the several acts and
also placed an age limit of forty years
on chaplains.
In the pay corps forty-seven majors
were substituted for thirteen majors
and thirty-four captains as first pro
vided in the Hull bill. The signal corps
appointments weie opened to those
from civil life as well as the volunteers.
The number of chaplains was increased
from thirty to forty. A provision was
made that assistant surgeons shall pass
a satisfactory examination instead of
competitive examination as at present.
The final vote on reporting the bill
was 8 to 5, on party lines, as follows:
Ayesâ Hull Marsh, Griffin, Ketchum.
Fenton, Belknap. McDonald and
Brownlow, Republicans. Noes â Sulzer,
Cox, Lentz, Hay and Jett, Democrats.
Marsh, while voting for the bill, re
served the right to oppose some of its
features on the floor. The minority gave
notice of a minority report and a sub
stitute bill. The main feature of the
substitute bill will be a standing army
limited to that existing before the re
cent war and authority to the President,
to enlist a large temporary force, prob
ably 50,000 men, for service in outlying
territory. __ ___________

UNION FREIGHT
DEPOT SOON
TO BE BUILT
Preliminary Work Is
Being Done.
MERCHANTS WANT DEPOTS
KRUTTSCHNITT SAYS THERE IS
NO NEED OF THEM.
Contrast Drawn Between the South
ern Pacific Sheds and the
Valley Railroad
Depots.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Dec. 20.
General Manager Kruttschnitt of the
Bon them Pacific Company has conlided
to the Oakland Board of Trade the fact
that the d any Is now engaged in the
preliminary work for a large union
freight depot to be built at West Oak
land east of the railroad shops. For a
long time work has been going on, pile
driving and Riling In the marsh, and many
large jobs have been undertaken, but it
was not known with what object. In the
conference between the Board of Trade
committee and Mr. Kruttschnitt he made
known the intentions of the company,
which are of vast interest to the western
section of the city.
The Board of Trade Is anxious to se
cure adequate depots in this city in place
of the present unsatisfactory structures.
The committee having the matter in
charge consisted of Frank J. Mott, chair
man. J. F. Towle, E. W. Biarston and
Secretary Craigie Sharp. Mr. Krutt
schnitt agreed that the present depot at
First and Broadway is not what it should
be, but says there is no suitable land at
that point for depot purposes. The com
mittee also suggested that a brick and
Btone depot be erected at Sixteenth street.
â¢â¢That," said Mr. Kruttschnitt, "is out j
of the question. The railroad is not in
the business of constructing brick build
ings. Even this proposition of placing
awnings about the present old depot at
Sixteenth Btreet was regarded as imprac- |
ticable. It is not the policy of the com- j
pany to expend so much meney on depots
as it is to make outlays for perfecting
equipment. The Oakland mole is prac
tically the Oakland union depot and the
city in that regard is pretty well cared
for."
Secretary Craigie Sharp asked a few
questions which brought out the informa
tion that the big union freight depot is
to be built on flats now being tilled to the
east of the Peralta street yards.
M. J. Keller, vice president of the Board
of Trade, said the depot at First and
Broadwayi ought to be improved, "And
purely the Sixteenth street depot does not
present a good appearance. It is not good
enough for this city and is an important
Btation. It is practically Oakland's over
land depot. As to the Oakland mole, that
is as much a depot for San Francisco as
for Oakland. The traffic at Sixteenth
street warrants important improvements.
However, I believe that as a result of the
conference there will be some improve
ments."
Referring editorially to this matter, the
Oakland Enquirer says:
"General Manager Kruttschnitt tells
the committee of the Oakland Board of
Trade that the Southern Pacinc Company
is not in the business of constructing
brick or Btone depot buildings, and that
the structureâ if it can be called a .struc
tureâat Sixteenth street station, will have
to answer, although he intimates that he
may introduce a few minor improve- ;
ments. "We suppose Mr. Kruttschnitt has
noticed that the Valley railroad builds
better depots than the one at Sixteenth
Btreel at stations where there is scarcely
a house In Bight, and that in towns of
one-quarter the population of Oakland it i
puts up buildings which are really orna
mental, although comparatively inexpen
sive. The Bouthern Pacinc should dis
charge a politician from some one of its
departments and use his salary to pay an
architect."

TATIVES IN CONFERENCE. '
-
Appropriations Considered Likely to
Meet Witn Favor in All Sec
tions of the City.
â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 20.
Another united effort is to be made to
pass a bond scheme for procuring parks
for this city. At a convention of dele
gates from the various Improvement clubs
all the complaints against the features
of the issue recently defeated were
brought up and adjusted. Representa
tives from the improvement clubs of
East Oakland. North Oakland, West Oak
land, Temesca] and Peralta Heights
joined with the executive committee of
the citizens' park committee, and as a re-
Bult of their deliberations the following
appropriations were agreed upon as be
ing likely to meet with favor from all
quarters of the city. The ligures call
for the issuance of $35,000 more bonds
than the measure which" was defeated.
They are as follows:
For Ailamp Point property $240,000
Improvement of same 00.000
Improving Independence Square 10,000

Total J371.5.-.0
Auditor Snow of the citizens 1 commit
tee said that the scheme as now modified
would no doubt suggest Itself, to the
general committee as being sufflciently
feasible to justify the calling of another
election. 'We would like to call an elec
tion again." said he. 'believing it would
carry, on the same terms as before but
as that would create a controversy it is
Letter to make the desired changes."

FLEECED CREDULOUS
PEOPLE AND SKIPPED
WARRANT ISSUED FOR THE AR-
REST OF R. ANTIEFF.
Represented Himself as Agent of
Foreign Governments and
Lived in Style.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 20.
A warrant has been issued for the arrest
of Robert Antieff, alias Ernst Molkan, on
charges of obtaining money under false
pretenses. Antieff is one of the smooth
est princes of swindlers that has visited
these parts in many a day, if the charges
are correct. He Is accused of having
fleeced J. Miller of $150, Harry Bassalio
of $10, Frank Courant of $6 and a host of
others of greater or less amounts.
Antleff represented himself to Miller
j as an agent of the Russian Government
j and his business to purchase a quantity
, of wine for use in the Russian army.
i Miller knows something about wine, arid
Antieff induced him to go to Napa and
; make a purchase for him, he claiming
! that it would be advisable not to be
known in the deal. Miller ordered about
200 gallons and promised payment in a
few days. As soon as he returned Antieff
rushed up to him and borrowed $100 on
some pretext. On the other victims An
tieff worked similar schemes. All the
' while he lived like a man of wealth and
in style.
Only a short time ago Antieff got into
i trouble by representing that be was au
thorized to buy vessels for a number of
foreign governments. In this way, it Is
I believed, he also fleeced a number of cred
i ulous people.
Since Saturday Antieff has not been
I seen hereabouts, but detectives have
I traced his tracks as far as Sacramento.
i The Chief of Police there has been notl
j fled, and hopes are entertained that the
! fellow will be apprehended before he gets
j beyond the StaU- line.
Will Try for a Divorce Again.
OAKLAND, Dec. 20.â Mrs. Sophie

; but in Judge Ogden's court as plaintiff
â in a divorce suit against Herman J.
j Schoenfelder, brought on the ground of
â¢ desertion, a decree being denied, has con-
I eluded to try again. Through her attor-
I ney, Hugh S. Aldrich, she commenced a
I second divorce suit, this alleging infelicity
of a most serious character. At the re
cent trial Mrs. Schoenfelder, when called
to the witness stand, mounted the chair.
! which stands upon a platform two feet
high, and there she stood almost touching
the chandeliers, to the amusement of the
i court, lawyers and laymen. The new suit
promises to be decidedly more interesting

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1898.
MANY MEN
MENTIONED FOR
THE MAYORALTY
Much Will Depend on
Methods.
PRIMARIES ARE FAVORED
REPUBLICAN LEADERS DO NOT
APPROVE OF APPOINTING.
Declare That the Party Principles
Demand That All Have an
Opportunity to
Vote.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 20.
All political parties and pieces of par
ties are now engaged in casting about for
a suitable candidate to head their ticket.
Names are being freely suggested as they
always are in this city, and it Is very evi
dent that this year at least the office will
not seek the man. The list up to date Is
as follows: Giles H. Gray, R. W. Snow,
M. J. Keller, John F. Towle, John L.
Da vie, Fred V. Wood. A. T. Macdonough,
Arthur H. Breed, H. D. Rowe, George W.
Reed. J. W. Phillips and J. W. Evans.
Nearly all of these are Republicans, and
several of them would be acceptable to
the Municipal League. The manner In
which t)ie delegates shall be elected will
cut a large figure in determining the nom
ination for Mayor. The stalwart Repub
licans are daily declaring themselves in
favor of primaries as opposed to the ap
pointing of delegates by ward commit
tees.
The latest to declare himself is J. W.
Evans, a School Director and a prominent
politician. "1 am in favor of selecting
delegates to the City Convention at pri
maries," said Mr. Evans. "It is the prin
ciple involved that I think should be sus
tained. There is at present a good City
Central Committee, with a good man at
its head, and the appointments made
would in all probability be good ones.
But I object to this method. I fought for
primaries two years ago and I will right
for them now, and I -â 'cc no reason why
the Republican city ticket should not suc
ceed."
George W. Arper. president of the Mer
chants' Exchange, favors the selection of
delegates by primaries. He said: "Al
though there is no primary law we should
take precaution to provide against fraud.
In my judgment the Republican party
will have no trouble in electing its ticket
if good men are put on it. The Republi
can party must put up men who are not
looking for spoils, and if they do this
their victory will be overwhelming. The
business men and merchants are clamor
ing for good men. I have spoken to mem
bers of the Merchants' Exchange and they
all feel as 1 do about the matter. Even the
Democrats seem to realize that they have
no chance this time. Although we have
a good city committee 1 would not favor
â the plan of appointing delegates to the
convention. Even If they were honest
suspicion would attach to their motives.
It is better to have a primary as poor as
It is and as little protection as it affords."
Charles \V. Kellog, a prominent Repub
lican, falls to see what benefit the ap
pointing plan has over a primary, and
Bays that both schemes have their abuses.
The Republican City Central Committee
met last night, but decided to further
canvass public sentiment before arriving
at any decision as to the manner of call
ing the convention.
A Lad Loses an Eye.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 20.â Arthur Salsbach.
! a 12-year-old lad. living on Upper Park
street, lost his right eye yesterday after
noon by the explosion of a toy cannon.
He and a companion named Clark were
playing In the workshop of young Clark's
father building a cannon out of a piece of
gas pipe. They loaded an old pistol car
tridge with powder and attempted to ex
plode it Witn a fuse. It did not go off
: soon enough to satisfy Salsbach, and de
: spite of the protest of Clark Salsbach
j peeked down the barrel with his right
eye Simultaneously there was an ex
| plosion and the boy fell to the floor writh
ing in pain. The pistol shell had been
driven from the gas pipe cannon by the
i explosion, and striking the lad's eye, had
1 forced it out of the socket.
Alameda Municipal League.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 20.â The Municipal
League failed to nominate a ticket for the
spring election at its meeting last even
ing. The session was called for that pur
pose, but some of the wise ones argued
that such action would be 111-advised for
the reason that their nominees would be
exposed for too great a length of time to
the onslaughts of the opposition. The
league added a plank to its platform advo
cating the municipal ownership of water
works. The organization starts the cam
paign with a nickle in its treasury.

RESCUED BY A BRAVE
CALIEORNIA CORPORAL
/â N ORPORAL JACK BRADY of the First California Volunteers, now
! on duty in the Philippines, recently rescued a drowning comrade
â¢ as he was goin^ down for the last time in the Pasig River at Ma-
I . nila under circumstances that render the act truly heroic.
A few days before the Scandia sailed for home a party consist
ing of six members of Company E, First California, went for a
ride on the river in a native canoe. When ' near the suspension bridge
that spans the stream at an alti
tude of forty feet above the wa
ter the canoe capsized and the six
soldiers found themselves strug
gling In the swiftly running cur
rent. Five were good swim
mers and managed to dump the
water out of the canoe and
regain their seats in the frail
craft, but the sixth man. Private
"William Hogan, was not so for
tunate. He was being rapidly car
ried down the stream by the cur
rent, his companions being unable
to render him any assistance be
cause their paddles had been lost
in the upset, when his cries for
help were heard by Corporal Bra
dy, who was walking across the
suspension bridge.
Brady stripped off his coat and
sprang from the bridge without
a moment's hesitation. The im
petus he received from the jump
of forty feet carried him some
distance, and when he reappeared
ten seconds later, fifty feet fur
ther down stream, he was within
a short distance of the drowning
man, who had already gone un
der twice. A few powerful
strokes brought Brady within
roach of Hogan and he stretched out his hand to grasp him by the hair. As
he did so Hogan sank for the third time. Brady at once dived and a mo
ment later appeared with the body of the now unconscious man. By this
time Brady was pretty well exhausted with his exertions, but a native
boatman came to his assistance and rescuer and rescued were soon safe.
Brady's daring- leap from the high bridge into the swiftly flowing river
forty feet below and his rescue of the drowning soldier were witnessed by
a crowd of civilians and soldiers, who applauded the act enthusiastically.
The Manila papers highly complimented Brady, one of them saying,
"Brady's pluck is the kind that wins great battles."
Brady is a corporal of Company A, First California Volunteers. Before
the regiment was mustered into the United States service he was foreman
of the brass-molding shop in the Union Iron Works.
CASTRO, FOILED IN LOVE,
SUSPECTED OF REVENGE
YOUNG SANTA CRUZ LOCHIN
VAR ARRESTED FOR ARSON.
His Sweetheart Failed to Elope With
Him and Her Folks Afterward
Mourned a Burned Barn.
The fervent Spanish love of P. J. Castro
of Santa Cruz was thwarted, and as is
often the case of such condition in the
heart affairs of such natives and such
natures, turned to vindictiveness, and the
young- man is in jail charged with arson.
The arrest w-as made in this city yester
day evening by Deputy Sheriff W. A.
Corey of Santa Cruz. The prisoner was
taken before Judge Mogan, where his ball
was fixed at $2000. He will be taken to
Santa Cruz by Deputy Sheriff Corey this
morning.
Castro is the great-grandson of the old
Mexican whose, name is woven in the his
tory of California, and whose leagues of
land once lapped over hill after hill of
this broad State. This was before the
active "gringo" secured the title deeds of
the indolent Spanish pioneer's patrimony
and relegated him to some half-ruined
adobe building outaide of the boundary
lines of his lost estate.
Young Castro about a year ago fell in
love with a beautiful Santa Cruz girl
named Annie Perez, one of his own race,
and like him a remnant of a perishing
name. The girl is not only pretty, but
Is well educatedâ a treasure which the
youth appreciated and bent every latent
energy of his being to possess. She at
that period was 15 years old and the loves
of these two descendants of Castile flowed
on as smoothly as the little brooks across
the lost domains of the Castros.
She was attending school and young
Castro planned to abduct ihe maidenâ
needless to say with her full consent. He
was to meet her near the Institution one
night and she was to steal out from the
house and together they would elope. He
waited at the place designated with his
speedy mustang for her appearance, but
he waited In vain. No Santa <"ruz Loch
invar sped away over the valleys and
mountains of the Coast Range that night
nor any other night. No fleet steeds fol
lowed, the runaways over bracken and
A CLEVER ARTIST COMING.
C. W. SAALBURG, a Noted Black and White
Delineator, Who Will Reach This City
This Evening.
CHARLES W. SAALBURG, the noted black and white artist, will
arrive in this city this evening and repair to his parents' resi
dence, at 1220 Ellis street, where he intends to stay during his
visit. He is accompanied by his wife and child. As this is Mr.
Saalburg's first visit to his home in six years, his coming is
looked forward to by his parents with pleasure.
During his absence from his native city he has earned the reputa
tion of being one of the foremost cartoonists and black and white artists
in the country.
As chief of the Wasp's art department his work first gained promi
nence. In 1892 he accepted a position on the Chicago Inter Ocean and his
clever productions were highly commented on. Mr. Saalburg made a fly
ing visit to this city during that year to make a study of Chinese cos
tumes to use in his "Ting-a-ling." which have won him as great renown as
did the "Brownies" for Palmer Cox. The doings of his humorous little
creations were compiled and issued in book form by a London firm last
Christmas, and it is understood that, owing to their great sale, it will be
repeated this holiday.
Shortly after his marriage to Miss Grace Gove of Rockford, 111., he
went to New York and assumed charge of the color department of' the
World. He enjoys the distinction of being the first newspaper artist to
publish a cartoon in colors. This he did while on the Inter Ocean. His
work on the World was well received and he obtained many commis
sions from Europe.
While in Paris in 1896 he contributed to Le Petit Journal, London
.periodicals and the New York World.
On his return to America he again did work for the big New York
dally. Business of importance interrupted his labors a few months
ago and a Hying trip to Paris resulted. He returned a week ago and on
his arrival in the metropolis he boarded a train, and, meeting his wife and
baby at Chicago, came on immediately to this city.
Mr. Saalburg is 33 years old and is now doing his best work. He has
hundreds of friends in this city, all of whom will be pleased to see him home
again.
heather as was the case in the story of
Scott's young border ruffian and his
stolen lady. Sheâ the Santa Cruz girl
changed her mind, and the disappointed
Castro rode slowly home meditating on
revenge. Her relations had heard of the
proposed flight and had succeeded in con
vincing her that most any son of a gringo
was better than the impoverished scion
of a noble though acreless name.
Young Castro s fancies were then filled
with thoughts of revenge, and he await
ed the time when he could strike at the
Perez family. Of course he talked of the
feud and his threats were often heard by
the neighbors. Consequently when a
barn belonging to the Perezes was burned
on the sth of this month, together with
five valuable horses, wagons, farming im
plements and a Quantity of hay, suspicion
naturally fell on Castro. He had been
seen hanging around the place at all
hours of day and night, and the case
against him was so strong that a warrant
was sworn out for his arrest and placed
in the hands of Deputy Sheriff Corey,
who made the arrest.

STANFORD'S CHRISTMAS JINKS.
A Parlor of the Native Sons Has a
Jollification at the Expense
of the Sheriff-Elect.
Stanford Parlor, No. 76, of the Native
Sons of the Golden West held Its Christ
mas high jinks last night in Shasta Hall
of the Native Sons' building. It wa.s for
members only and a very limited num
ber of invited guests.
There was the trial of Henry S. Martin,
Sheriff-elect. \V. Phelps, Supervisor-elect,
and a number of other members upon
absurd charges before Police Court 4-11-44,
presided over by Justice of the Peace
Barry, with Justice F. H. Kerrigan as
prosecuting attorney. E. C. Williams,
clerk, and Sergeant Martin of the police
force as bailiff. A jury was selected and
accepted on the ground of its iack of in
telligence, and in the travesty that fol
lowed there were many sharp hits at the
judicial system. In the case of Phelps
the accused was the only witness called
and the jury after hearing his testimony
decided that the prosecuting attorney was
the guilty one, and he was ordered
locked up in a large crate, marked Jail
No. 2, until he drank three glasses of beer.
His imprisonment lasted just two min
utes. All the other cases were submitted
in a bunch and the jury fined the Judge
$1 for not knowing his business. During
the trial there were many witty sayings
and tho farce was productive cf much
amusement.
After the travesty on justice Joe Intor
venor Greenberg appeared as Santa
Claus and taking his stand under a larpe
tree beautifully dressed and lighted with
numerous tapers, distributed to each of
the members a number of gifts of the
most ridiculous character, but productive
of much mirth. During the evening W.
Finney favored with songs and the com
m'ttee. consisting of A. P. Schle'cher, K.
H. Jung, C. D. Steiger, Joe Greenberg and
Krrrison Houseworth, had a collation
served, also light refreshments. A case
of fne oranges Bint to the parlor by the
parlor in Oroville as a Christmas gift,
was distributed.

success on the stage in next Sunday's

"BRANDES IS
A FOOL," SAYS
MR. BENNETT
HIS CLIENT DENIES THAT HE KNOWS
MISS OLIVER.
The Girl, However, Reiterates Her Story, Laughs
at Brandes' Evasion and Declares She
Visited His Berkeley Home and Saw
Poor Little Lillian Brutally
Beaten by His Wife.
TV. A. Brandes' duplicity and utter lack
cf honor, further proof of which is given
toy his courtship of 18-year-old Emma Ol
lver while representing himself to be a
Fingle man, as published exclusively in
The Call yesterday morning, seems to be
only equaled by his dense stupidity.
The man who is straining every nerve
to save Ms neck from the hangman's
has heretofore been credited with
possessing n certain amount of shrewd
larp< !y because of the adroit man
ner in which he has apparently suo â¢
in explaining away various suspicious cir
cumstances tending to connect him and
the woman who bears his name with the
cruel death of his little daughter. Brandes
5s evidently not Bhrewa. He is cunning,
but his cunninjjn. \-< is apparently of the
shallow variety that serves for a brief
Space t.-> deceive the uninitiated and falls
away like a mask when subjected to scru
tiny. His net in writing a letter to Miss
Oliver after his arrest on the charge of
murder, in which he kept up the prepense
that he was single and that the man
charged with the horrible crime was his
brother, was a piece of foolishness bor
dering on the idiotic, and is so character
ized by the accused man's attorneys.
"Thaj story published in The Call this
morning was a great surprise to m<> and
â¢will prove a strong card for th<- prosecu
tion," said Attorney J. E. Bennett yester
day afternoon. "That is, ' he added, cau
tiously, "if Brandes really wrote that let
ter. 1 do not believe he could have done a
thing so supremely foolish. If he did it
â was worse than foolish; it was idiotic.
However, 1 have no apprehension that
such a letter exists and it will probably
be shown when the time comes that the
prirl's story is nothing more than a lot of
idle gossip."
Notwithstanding an attempt to be cheer
ful, however, the attorney could not hide
his disgust and chagrin at the I
development in the case It is no si en t
that Brandes' pas: is "ivinu his attorney!
a great deal of concern and everything of
this nature that is brought to the surface
makes their task all the harder.
Brandes was inclined to make light of
the story when seen in the County
l>ut he denied any knowledge of Miss Ol
iver. Hi disposed of the matter thus:
â  "My mother was a lady; my sister is a
lady, an>l ] would not say anything to in
jure a lady. I have no recollection of Miss
Oliver and I am quite sure 1 never met
any one answering her description, or of
that name."
â¢â (if course." he added, swelling out his
ehÂ» st and twirling his mustache, "I knew
a great many ladles, Inn 1 do not r^nrni
ber -ill their names. I never told any lady
J was single, but I did not show everj
I met my marriage certificate.' If Miss
Oliver says she has a letter written I
1 y me she is mistaken. I have never writ
ten to her and do not know her."
Miss Oliver did nut realize the impor
tance ar:d probable consequence of her
connection with Brandes until sn<
her name in print, and now she liv. - in
constant dread of being summoned
witness in the rase. She kept berseli s. -
eluded yesterday anil only consented to
be seen after she had been assured
the caller was a Call reporter and not a
Deputy Sheriff with a subpena for her to
appear in court.
The girl who says Brandes paid court
to her Is pretty and petite, and does not
look to be IS. which she acknowledges to
be her age, even though she wear
glasses. In fact, the glasses are decid
edly becoming. Without them she would
appear to be scarcely more than a child.
when told that Hrandes denied any i
lection of her she threw up both hands
with a little gesture of surprise.
"oh, my. did he say tuat?" she cried.
"Why. I hay.- known him a lone time

over seven months. Tt's funny that he
should say that he did not remember me."
And the mite of womanhood smiled at
the absurdity of Brandes' repudiation.
"When did you first meet Brandes?"
â was asked.
"I met him at his house when he lived
in Berkeley. I had some friends living
next door to him and went with them to
call on his daughter Lillian. After that
I called quite often to see Lillian. She
w;ts a nice, quiet girl and very affection
ate."
She said Brandes told her he was a sin
gle man and that Mrs. Hrandes was his
brother's wife. She sulil that Brandes

lian.
never whipped his daughter while she
was at his house, but that Mrs. Brandes
whipped her severely on one occasion for
a trival offei
"She took her by the shoulders - and
shook her and slapped her hard."- she
said, her eyes flashing: v.ith indignation at
the recollection, "because Lillian did- not
jump. up and do something she wanted
her to do at once,"
She repeated the story of Brandos call
ing to Bee her at her house and meeting
her on the street. She finally became
convinced that he was married and avoid
ed him as much as possible. In answer
to the alleged murderer's .statement that
he never wrote to her, she said positively:
the alleged murderer's statement that
never wrote to her. she said positively:
"He did write to me. He wrote me
since he was arrested, and I have the let
ter now."
Brandes' attorneys have evolved a
clever scheme to shut out the testimony
of two Important witnesses for the prose
cution. It is admitted that Brandes was
married to Mrs. Mary Arellanes Brandes
in Santa Cruz fifteen years ago, and that
wo important witnesses for the prose
on, it is admitted that Brandea was
;ried to Mrs. Mary Arellanea Brandes
Santa Cruz fifteen years ago. and that
there is no record of the divorce he
claims to have secured from her. Con
lently her testimony will be.obiected
to by the defense on the ground that a
wife cannot testify against her husband.
This objection would not be good, of
course, in the case of the second Mrs.
Brandes. as although it can be proved
that she was married to Brandes seven
â  or eight years ago in San Francisco, she
is not legally his wife. But as her tes
timony in the case would tend to incrimi-
n ate her. she also will l>e excluded from
the witness stand on that ground. This
is regarded as an important matter and
the attorneys for the defense, feel highly
elated at having put the prosecution in a
hole, ao to speak.
But the defense is apprehensive of the
effect Miss Oliver's testimony will have
in case she is put on the stand :ind of
the probable revelations of a similar char
acter concerning Brandes' doings that
may develop.
TO PROTEQT STATE INTERESTS.
Regents of the University Meet to
Discuss the Subject.
Tho special committee consisting of
Hems. Phelps. Hallldic and Denicke ap- j
pointed at the last meeting of the unlver- j
sky regents to consider the Question as
tn wbat might be best done through the J
university to protect the fruit, dairy and i
cattle industries and preserve our forests ;
met yesterday afternoon in the offices of
Mr. Hallldie. Secretary J. A. Fllcher of ;
the Board of Trade. Elliott McAllister of
the Sierra Club ;md President Martin
Kellogg were also in attendance, and the
various questions of momentous interest j
to the State of California were thorough
ly discussed and remedial plans were sug-
Regent Hallidie presented a resolution
which was adopted directing Chairman
Phelps to confer with the president of the
agricultural department of the univer
sity, the secretary of the Board of Trade,
the president of the Manufacturers' and
Producers" Association and a representa
tive of exporters to the end that an act
may be prepared for presentation to the
Legislature in which provision will be

made for a practical remedy to meet tho
exportation of infected fruit.
Elliott McAllister addressed the com
mittee on the forestry Interests and asked
the regents to provide for a school of
forestry similar to the one established
by Cornell University at Adirondack
Park.
Regent Denicke's resolution that Chair
man Phclps consult with a committee con
sisting of representatives from the Sierra
Club, Board of Trade. Miners' Associa
tion, department of agriculture of the
University of California and Stanford
University to prepare a bill to that effect
for the legislature was adopted.
A resolution was adopted requesting the
Legislature to appropriate necessary
funds, not to exceed $5000, for the appoint
ment under the department of agriculture
of one veterinarian and a dairy instructor
to report on the conditions of livestock
and dairies throughout the State. The
committee will recommend the adoption
of the resolutions to the regents.
WHAHF REPAIRING BIDS.
An Irregular Proposal Before the
Harbor Commission That
Threatened a Storm.
The State Senate Investigating Com
mittee on Harbor Commission affairs met
yesterday and immediately adjourned,
consequently the board went into a meet
ing of its own, President Colnon In the
chair and Commissioners Harney and
Herold on the side.
The matter of repairing Union-street
wharf brought out ten eager bidders.
Just before the sealed envelopes were
opened the representative of the Darby
Laydon Company sent in word that he
desired to withdraw his bid and imme
diately return it. His request was irreg
ular and was refused. He then stated
that the board would rind that by reason
of a clerical oversight his bid was un
signed. This brought out a vigorous pro
test from other bidders present. They
designated it as a contractor's trick, and
if that bid was found to be the lowest the
next lowest bidder would enjoin the com
ing contract. The board decided, how
ever, to open the Darby Laydon bid first.
let the agent sign it and consider the pro
posal with the others. The bid was for
$4001 92. and all who knew their own ttg
urea were above this renewed their pro
tests.
The bids ran: Cotton Brothers, $4359 10;
San Francisco Bridge Company. $4."iÃf. 30;
Healy, Tibbits & Co., $4570 50; Thompson
Bridge Company, $4035 60; Pacific Con
struction Company, $4821 43; California
Bridge and Construction Company, $4999;
P. P. Dundon & Co.. $4090; M. McCarthy,
14984 25. There was one more bid with the
protested bid of the Darby Laydon Com
pany in the lead. Injunctions were in the
air ;imi all classes of troubles were threat
ening. But the clouds wetfe happily dis
pelled, as the remaining sealed envelope
contained the bid of James McMahon for
$3814 75. This probably Saved the State
a mess of litigation, as the other bidders
were determined to protest against the
I>;irhy r.aydon proposal should It have
been the winner. President Colnon ex

A Novelty in Natural Palms.
Many a person who has admired the
beautiful decorative effect of palms
has bemoaned the impossibility of
keeping the leaves always green ami
bright. Now comes a genius who has
preserved the palms, which under his
process are always fresh looking and
as far superior to artificial cloth palms
as is gold to brass. Nathan, Dorhmann
& Co. are showing them as a delight
ful novelty and selling them at prices
from $2 50 to $5.

CAPTAIN VON
SCHMIDT SUED
FOR DIVORCE
SOME SENSATIONAL CHARGES MADE
BY HIS WIFE.
She Says He Often Threatened to Kill Her and
Once He Shot at Herâ Yon Schmidt
Says the Woman Is Not in Her Right
Mmd â Alameda Much Inter
ested in the Case.
Isabella yon Schmidt left her home, 2221
Central avenue, Alameda, yesterday, tak
ing her five children with her. While her
husband, E. A. yon Schmidt, the pilot, and
son of Colonel yon Schmidt, the civil en
gineer, was waiting for his wife and fam
ily to return to dinner there was a tug at
the door bell and a Deputy Sheriff handed
him the summons in a divorce suit. Â«
According to the statement of Mr. yon
Schmidt, although there had been con
siderable friction in his household, espe
cially over financial matters, he had no
intimation whatever that his wife contem
plated securing a separation.
"When 1 left home this morning," he
paid, "she was unusually pleasant in her
demeanor and I was taken right off my
feet when I was served with this com
plaint by way of an appetizer for my sup
per."
The Yon Schmidts have resided for
years in one of the most aristocratic sec
tions of Alameda and have moved in the
best social circles.
The divorce complaint charges the hus
band with innumerable acts of cruelty.
The wife alleges that she was forced to
flee with her children from her home and
is concealing their present abode for fear
of their lives. The document was sworn
to Monday, when Mrs. yon Schmidt was
still dwelling with her husband at 2221
Central avenue. She alleges that on Oc
tober 15. 1893, he attempted to kill her and
did discharge a pistol at her at their
home. On another occasionâ July 15, 1897â
she claims he threatened to kill her while
they were visiting at Leona Heights, and
he went to the extent of drawing his pis
tol, but did not use it. Many other al
leged acts of cruelty are specified.
Mr. yon Schmidt talked freely of the
Buit and his family affairs this evening to
a Call reporter.
"We were married about fourteen years
ago in San Francisco," he said. "My
present wife was a ballet dancer and her
name wan Isabella Hill. I was living with
my lirst wife when I met her."
He said Mrs. yon Schmidt No. 1 took a
great fancy to the young lady, telling
him she was too good to waste her life
on the variety stage and urged him to
adopt her. When the first Mrs. yon
Schmidt died Isabella Hill, the ballet
dancer and plaintiff in the present suit,
took her place. After a time Mr. and Mrs.
yon Schmidt went to Australia, and dur
ing their stay there they experienced
their first domestic discord. In several
months he had given his wife $800 for
household expenses and was astonished
to find that she had used but $10<) for that
purpose and had run bills against him for
the balance. He taxed her with lavish-
Ing the remainder of the money on Harry
Skifls, an old flame. A similar state of
affairs has existed, off and on, during the
family's years of residence In this city.
"It has always been money, money'"
said Mr. yon Schmidt. "I would give her
$100 to pay the bills and later I would be
WILL RULE THE FRONT.
Ex-Senator Percy L Henderson, Who Will Be
Appointed Chief Wharfinger.
GEORGE W. ROOT, who was elected at the last general election to the
office of Clerk of the Supreme Court, yesterday tendered his resigna
tion as Chief Wharfinger of San Francisco to the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners. It is definitely settled that the board at its next
regular meeting will appoint ex-Senator Percy I*. Henderson to fill the
'â¢vacancy caused by Mr. Root's resignation. Mr. Henderson is a capable and
popular man, who possesses the qualifications necessary for the position
in question. He represented the Twenty-second Senatorial District In the
Upper House of the Legislature and served his constituents in a com
mendable manner.
Mr. Henderson was born in San Francisco February 5. ISTO. and received
his education in the public schools of this city and the Santa Clara College.
Since attaining his majority he has taken an active interest in the public
jiffiiirs of the community. He was appointed Deputy County Recorder of
San Francisco under Recorder Glynn, and was subsequently appointed
special gauger in the United States Internal revenue service. To make
the race for the Senatorship he resigned his position in the Federal
service.
dunned by the butcher and baker for
what was owing them."
Yon Schmidt was injured in San Fran
cisco November 4 of this year, and when
he limped home that evening he found
evidence of what leads him to believe
now- that his wife is not in her right mind.
She had frequently stated, so he says,
that she would not be with him long. That
evening he found her lying unconscious on
her bed. He at once suspected that she
had taken poison. Dr. Tisdale was sum
moned and worked over the woman for
hours before she recovered from her com
atose condition. After she regained her
health she complained for weeks of hav
ing a cold place on the top of her head.
"Regarding these charges of shooting,"
Paid Yon Schmidt, "they are partly true.
The first allegation is over an occurrence
at Menlo Park. My wife shouted that
robbers were trying to get into the house.
I grabbed my six-shooter and ran to the
front door. I tried to open It, but it was
chained rind the sudden jerk it gave it ex
ploded the gun. We have often talked of
the affair and laughed over It.
"I will acimit that I did threaten to kill
her at L,eona Heights, but I had no more
idea of doing so than T have of shooting
you now with this walking stick. She
went there to associate with people whom
I did not like and whom I did
not think were proper company for
the mother of my children. She told me
to mind my own business, and I told her
that if she was going to run that way I
would send her and myself to another
country. I pulled my revolver and she
fell on her knees, implored forgiveness
and promised to mend her ways. For
months after that we never lived so hap
pily."
Yon Schmidt says he will fight the case
to the end. He is willing to make any rea
sonable provisions for his children, but
further than that he will contest any ef
fort to compel him to pay alimony. Hia
wife asks for alimony to the amount of
$100 a month and $200 for attorney fees.
The couple have four sons and a daugh
ter, the eldest of whom is 13 years of age.
We have just received about 200 16x20
colored photo panels, mounted on glass,
with large projecting corners. Comingin so
late we will have to cut the regular price
of $10 50 each to $7 50 each in order to close
them out before Christmas. First come,
