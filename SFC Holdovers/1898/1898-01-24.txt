SPECIAL TRAINS SPEED WITH THE JUBILEE CALLS.
ONE BREAKS
RECORDS TO
LOS ANGELES
Never Has Such Speed Been
Attained in the Run to
the Southern Me
tropolis.
O At the Instance of The Call O
O railroad records were lowered to O
O an astonishing mark yesterday, O
O and the Southern Pacific demon- O
O strated that it can keep pace O
O with any line in the world if the O
Â© occasion requires it. O
Two trains pulled out from the ter
minus at long wharf scarcely five min
utes apart, a few minutes before 2
o'clock yesterday morning, and by the
time the mole was reached were thun
dering along at terrific speed. Along
the east shore of the bay they dashed,
the engineer of the leading train vainly
(striving to shake off his pursuer, while
the latter soon found that the best he
could do was to keep the lights on the
leader in view without gaining an inch
on them.
A more thrilling race was never run â
a more frightened lot of journalists
never lived to record their experience.
It was all due to the Jubilee edition
of The Call. North and south, through
out the length of the State people had
read the promises of the crowning tri
umph in journalism and clamored for
it at the earliest possible moment.
The Call has satisfied their clamor
ings.
But in order to- do so special trains
had to be chartered and arrangements
I made to give them the right of way
over all other trains. More than that,
the regular trains were to be side
tracked wherever orders reached them
until the specials passed with The Call,
and orders were given that there was
not to be an r instant's delay" at any
point and that the fastest time possible
was to be made.
Two trains were made up, the first
f to be run through the San Joaquin
Valley, over the snow-clad Tehachapi
to the orange groves of Los Angeles;
the other to distribute Jubilee Calls
. to the prosperous inhabitants of the
Sacramento Valley as far north as the
State capital and "Woodland.
With the starting of the great presses
the rush began. Scores of mailing
clerks deftly wrapped the papers in
huge bundles, the wrappers having
previously been labeled with the desti
nation, the packages being loaded into
wagons and rushed at a gallop to the
Folsom-street dock, where the fast
tug Active was in waiting, steam up
and everything in readiness for a hur
ried run across the bay.
Never did a boat receive quicker dis
patch and never was a cargo so quickly
unloaded.
At the end of long wharf, which juts
out into the bay nearly a mile beyond
the mole, and therefore lessened the
bay trip that much, stood Southern
Pacific locomotive 1500, a great com
pound machine, one of the fastest on
the road. Into the train It drew was
piled the bundles destined for Sacra
mento and way stations. Engineer
Raymon fingered the throttle, while
Conductor Davis had charge of the
train.
In front of the Sacramento special
â was locomotive 1365, another record
breaking machine, presided over by
Engineer Woods. This, too, drew a
light train. Conductor Ware having its
destinies in his keeping during the first
half of the run to Fresno.
At 1:53 o'clock the last bundle was
y tossed on board, the newspaper men
detailed to accompany the two trains
clambered Into the cars. Conductor
Ware gave the signal and the Los An
geles special plunged forward. As her
lights flashed past the Sixteenth-street
station, Oakland, Engineer Raymon re
ceived the word, and he lost no time
In getting under way.
Then began the race to Port Costa,
where the roads diverge, one bearing
away to the south and the other cross
ing Carquinez Straits and on north to
Sacramento. Not a stop was to be
made by either train until Port Costa
was reached, and the driver of the sec
ond special determined to cut down
some of the lead the other had been
given. Through the blackness of the
night the trains sped like tandem me
teors, no slackening of speed however !
sharp the turns and with no percep- i
tible advantage to either until the Sac- I
ramento flyer was forced to stop at the
landing place of the big ferry-boat
Solano. Then, and only then, did the
â  pursued whisk her lights out of sight.
The stories of the two lightning runs
are told below by. the correspondents j
on board the trains.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. This after- ;
noon all Southern California is talking
of the enterprise of The Call. It has
accomplished what has never been done !
before, and the people of Los Angeles
were reading at 2:30 in the afternoon
the edition which started from the
long wharf at 2 o'clock this morning.
. Within ten minutes after the arrival 'â¢
' of the tug carrying the immense load
of papers across the bay the special
train, drawn by the fastest engine be- j
longing to the Southern Pacific, went ;
flying out toward Oakland, along the
Mole and through the city at a speed
which astonished even the railroad men j
The San Francisco Call
' who were there to see the departure.
Faster and faster It sped until a speed
of sixty miles an hour was attained,
and this was kept up all through the
night until near the dawn of day.
when an accident to the engine caused
: a delay of almost two hours. It waa
I one of those providential accidents
which prevented one that would in all
' probability have ended not only the trip
: but the lives of all on board the train.
The breaking of a small bolt caused
the engine to stop, and after remedying
this an inspection of the big machine
was made which resulted In finding a
: broken pin in the driving rod. But a
i few more revolutions of the wheels
would have thrown the rod around and
against the ties, which would have sent
, the train into the ditch.
By this accident an honr and forty
five minutes was lost between Modesto
j and Fresno, but on arrival at the latter
i point a new engine and crew took
charge of the coach, and on being urged
i to make up as much time as possible
\ the speed was increased until at times
seventy miles an hour was attained.
; As the train plunged along at this fear
ful speed the single coach swayed and
jumped as if it might leave the track
lat any moment. As the train thun
j dered by the small statkms the startled
inhabitants rushed from their beds
; only to gaze on the blackness of night.
; for the cause of the disturbance had
disappeared in the distance. As day
light approached the people were seen
gathered at th^ stations, for announee
bmM had been made that a vrild spe-jlal
was tearing along the road. They had
little time to look and no time to sÂ«e
what tt was. for before they could get
their wits collected the train bearing
its load of Jubilee Calls had flashed up
i and by and was vanishing in the dis
tance.
At Fresno a five minutes stop was
made in order to change engines, and
; there the people had an opportunity of
learning what it was that was causing
such a commotion on the road. On all
sides were h^ard commendations of The
Call for its enterprise and progressive
! spirit, and the demand for the magnifi
cent edition was so great the agent wag
j compelled to ask for more than the
quota allotted to him.
From Fresno to Goshen the run was
j made in three-quarters of an hour:
; thence to BakersfiHd the time was
: kept at seventy miles an hour almost
I the entire way. and by the time the
second change of engines was made
there was very little of the lost time to
be made up. Bakersfield was reached
in seven hours from the Long wharf,
( and in this time must be included the
two hour? lost, which makes the actual
running time between those two points
! the fastest in the history of the road.
There have been other special trains
run in a hurry on the Southern Padfir,
but none of them have made the record '
; that ha? now been set by The Call.
, From Bakersfield came the long grade
â  up Tehachapi Mountains, and this run j
was made in the remarkably short tlm?
of one hour and forty minutes. Once
I over the range, whore a heavy snow
i storm was raging:, the speed was again
i increased until seventy miles an hour
was reached, and this was continued \
until Mohave was reached at 11:25.
The engineer was spurred to greater
effort at this point, and he was asked
to make every endeavor to reach Los
Angeles at 2 o'clock. He said he would
do it if it were In the engine and we did
not go into the ditch. It was in the i
j engine and we did not go into the ditch, j
j for just as the long whistle blew an- i
nouncing the- approach \o the beautiful !
city of the south, the hand? of the
; watches marked exactly the hour of 2.
I was slowed down on entering the
{limits of the <ity. and tlv greeting ( ,f
the people of L,os Angeles to the special
train of The Call came just at 2:20,
marking the finish of the remarkable
run from San Francisco to Los An
cr.â¢]â¢ B, a distance of 490 miles, in twelve
< hours, including stops and delay of two
I hours from accident.
There are many incidents that kept
the mind busy on this long run which
! did not seem long. There was too much
excitement to permit of interest lag
ging, and during the entire distance
there was not a minute or a mile that
did not have something in it that made
: the trip an interesting one from a trav
eler's point of view.
During the night the train seemed
enveloped with a cloud of luminous
dust, and to the people who saw it
flashing through the darkness it must
have seemed something uncanny and j
unearthly. As the morning dawned
Rocks of ducks and geese rose from the j
marshes and fields along the track and i
here and there a coyote could be seen '
sneaking along on his way home
after a night's hunt for a break- !
fast. People started to run to the de
pots to see the spectacle, but before j
they reached the platform the train :
was out of sight, leaving but a cloud j
of cinders and dust to show that some
thing had gone by. At one station an
unfortunate dog was crossing the
SAX FRANCISCO, MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1898.
track, and he looked up to see what
was coming. His momentary stop was
fatal, for In an instant his body was
cut in two, while his owner shook his
fist lmpotently at the space where the
train ought to have been had it been
a regular. As the train approached
Los Angeles the roads were lined with
people who had driven out in buggies
and ridden on bicycles to see the in
coming wonder. They saw but little of
the train, and had to read the banner
on the side of the car by piecemeal, for
it went by so rapidly that they could
hardly distinguish the letters, and be
fore they could read the first word the
whole was too far In advance to be
seen.
The train was scheduled to arrive

jat the Arcade in Los Angeles at 3
i o'clock, but the good engines and the
! masterly engineers and conductors of
I the Bouthen Pacific system beat the
i schedule by almost an hour, and the
i result was that while the people were
I leisurely wending their way toward the
depot to see the special arrive, the pa
pers were being unloaded and the train
| backed into the yards. These who were
! there, however, made up for the lack
! of numbers by their warmth of wel
come, and the dusty an<i dnder-be
grimed men who went through on the
coach were taken In hand and greeted
as cordially as if they. too. had been
dressed in their Sunday clothes.
The rapid increase In the circulation
of The Call In the past two weeks will
now be further augmented If the ex
pressions heard on all sides is any cri
terion upon which to base judgment.
All the afternoon, in the streets and in
the hotels, nothing was talked of but
the remarkably fast run made by The
Call Special bearing the jubilee edition.
Nor was the train and its remarkable
speed all that received commendation,
for the handsome edition and the men
who have done so much for the im
provement of the paper, came in for
their share of the praise so generously
bestowed, and the general sentiment
was that The Call would henceforth
maintain the proud position of being
the first and best of San Francisco's
dallies.
The Call was on sale here seventeen
hours ahead of the Examiner and
Chronicle.
EARLY DELIVERY OF
THE CALL'S JUBILEE
EDITION AT TULARE.
For the First Time Residents Read a San
Francisco Sunday Paper Before Break
fast and They Praise the Enterprise.
TI'LAUE, Jan. 23.â The Call special
carrying the special Jubilee Edition
reached Tulare this morning at 7:30
o'clock, just twelve hours in advance
of the usual time of delivery. When
the news agent at this place received
the notice that the special would arrive
this morning a large crowd gathered
at the bulletin board. The train
reached Tulare nearly two hours ahead
of time and Tularans for the first time
read The Sunday Call before breakfast.
Early as it was a crowd was at the
depot to welcome the Jubilee special.
The train did not stop, but only slowed
up to permit the messenger to throw
off the hundreds of copies for this
place. F. Rosen thai, the live news
agent, put his carriers upon bicycles
and the paper was delivered to sub
scribers promptly at 8 o'clock. Xews- '
boys found ready sales for the paper
and in a surprisingly short space of
time the copies were all sold. Men of
all shades of opinion united in praising
the enterprise of The Call In thus beat
ing all record for speedy delivery in
tlrifl valley.
Said one prominent citizen: "The Call
is the livest paper in California." The
prompt delivery and superior quality
of contents were v.-idely commented
upon and unstinted and generous praise
was bestowed upon The Call manage
ment. All Tulare is reading Sunday's
Call and the special edition distances ,
' all competitors. Truly The Call speaks
for all.
GREAT SENSATION

Early Morning Delivery of the Great Jubilee
Edition an Enterprise in Journalism
That Is Loudly Praised.
VISALIA, Jan. 23.â The Calls grand
Golden Jubilee Edition made a pro- ;
found sensation in Visalia. Its achieve
meat in laying down in this city Sun- j
day morning's paper on Sunday morn- i
lag, although we are 250 mii. s from San
Francisco, is something unique In 'â 
newspaper enterprise. Many are the j
compliments that have been paid The
Call and its manager by citizens. The
.Call reached (Joshen shortly after 8
o'clock this morning, and Nate Rogers. I
the main distributor of the paper, was
on hand with his boggy to hurry the
bundles of O;il is over to Yisalia. He
had all he could carry. His Vlsalla

;:t Levy Broa.' store, where The Call is
â old, to comment on :h.- early appear- I
ance of th>-ir favorite journal.
One of th.- leading busin-ss men said
this evening that he had been reading '
Th>' C*a!l all day; that it v.as on-- of the
beat last* b he had ever handled of any
paper. Another remarked: "That is a
most excellent paper. I intend to Me
it away for future use. The Call is
taking the lead nowadays."
One of th<' proprietors of a daily '
paper says The Call is about the only ;
ettjr paper that hi!s c-erlitable news at
:-t. Ho always looks for Th.- Call
; when he wants to make clippings for !
h!s own paper. He i* greatly pleased

RESIDENTS OF MAD ERA
SURPRISED BY THE
CALL'S ENTERPRISE.
Leading Citizens ueciare mat the Special
Train and Mammoth Edition Eclipse Mil
Previous Efforts en the Coast.
MAPERA. Jan. 23.â The Jubilee Edi
tion of The Call arrived by special
train at 6 o'clock this morning:, and
was Immediately delivered by special
c-arriers through the city, and was the
first object to preet the early risers
upon the opening of their front doors.
Many expressions of approval have
been heard relative to the enterprise
displayed on behalf of The Call. R.
Roberts, president of the Commrecia!
Bank, said: 'This Jubilee Edition of
The Call found on my porch this morn
ing is a triumph In journalism and
eclipses any former effort made by that
paper; or, I may say, any other paper
on the coast. Its resume of the min
ing industries of the State is most
commendable."
C. J. Eubanks. County Clerk, said:
"While The Call Is not of my politics,
I cannot resist saying that it Is a great
paper, and its Jubilee Edition should
be preserved as a part of the history
of the State."
W. M. Hughes, son of the father of
Fresno, said: "I am. in the language
of Dave Hill, 'A Democrat," still I ad-
mire The Call for the energy displayed
in the Jubilee Edition. I regard The
Call as a great paper, full of news,
clean and decent."
E. H. Ccx, cashier of the Commercial
F-ank. said: "I have always admired
The Call, and particularly do I admire
anything enterprising and energetic in
journalism. I take nearly all the daily
papers. I read them carefully as to
financial and business reports. I have

Judge Arch McDonald picked up a

and. after glancing: through it, bought
a copy at the newsstand. He said:
"I'm a "49'er, and I think that there is

ENTERPRISE THAT IS
DULY APPRECIATED
AT FRESNO CITY.
"It is a Splendid Paper and a Great Scoop
on yellow Journalism." Say Readers
of the Jubilee Edition.
FRESNO. Jan. 23.â Before the people
of Fresno were out of bed this morning
the special train bearing the Golden
Jubilee Edition of The Call pulled Into
Fresno, the papers were delivered to
C. T. Cearley, the local agent, and The
Call special sped away to Los An
geles.
The special arrived here at 6:50 this
morning, but even then it was an hour
behind the time when it was due. ow
ing to an unfortunate mishap, as for
the last eight miles the engine had to
creep along on account of a hot box.
Another engine was obtained here and
the change was made with lightning
rapidity.
The Calls were on the street ten
hours and twenty minutes before any
of its competitors, and the papers were
delivered to the regular subscribers so
that they had them at their breakfast
table. The street sale 3 were enormous,
everybody buying a Call. The edition
here were sold out before night. It
was a boon to the newsboys that they
will never forget.
Everywhere expressions of praise
could be heard for the remarkable en
terprise of The Call and for the splen
did issue. Here are a few of the com
mendatory words heard on the streets
to-day:
Fulton G. Berry, proprietor of the
Grand Central Hotelâ lt was a grand
feat. The Call beat them all. The Is
sue was the greatest I ever saw. I've
been through ail those early day scenes
described, and they were absolutely
true. Not overdrawn, but realistic. It
made me feel like a boy again with my
pick in hand working in the mines.
Continued on Second Pass.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 23.â "Right of
track over all trains" is the way the
order read which was handed to Con
ductor Davis and Engineer Raymon
on the Oakland pier this morning just
as they were about to start out with
the special train which was to carry
The Call's Golden Jubilee Edition to
its subscribers throughout the State.
"It was a great run," said Fireman
Gibbs, as he mopped the perspiration
from his brow in Sacramento and
looked at his watch.
It took just one hour and forty-four
minutes to make the run between Oak
land mole and the foot of Second street,
Sacramento. Of course, this did not
include the stops, for the simple reason
that there were none.
From the start to the finish there
was not a slacking of speed at any
point save the interruption at the Car
quinez Straits.
The tug drew up to the long wharf
with great packages of Calls piled up
on every available foot of space found
on the decks and in the cabin.
The Los Angeles special was first ac
commodated, and although the train
and tug crews worked as fast as they
could a good half hour was consumed
in transferring the bundles from the
tug: to the coach of the Los Angeles
special.
Papers for the north were then placed
In the car of the Sacramento special,
and soon both trains were flying
along the- coast of . Alameda- -County
at a speed that was fearful.
A good stiff breeze was blowing- from
the north, but it hindered not, and
when just seven minutes out from the
mnle it reached the stock yadrs. One
minute more and West Berkeley faded
away, and six minutes later the sta
tion lights at Pan Pablo indicated that
the special had reached the mile a
minute mark, with splendid prospects
of passing Pinole at just a trifle faster
than that. The sensation of rounding
those curves between Pinole and Port
Costa in the darkness of night at such
a rate of speed was somewhat ex
hilarating, and at the same time not
entirely free from a fear that can
hardly be described.
Thirty minutes were not consumed
in passing Port Costa and from Be
nlcia to Sacramento there has never
been a faster run than that made by-
Engineer Raymon this morning.
As each station was approached the
bundles of Calls were balanced in the
door of the car and as the lights In
the station window appeared they were
tilted a bit and then sent flying
through the air until they landed on
the station platform.
One of the bundles struck a baggage
truck that was standing outside, upon
which had been left an empty chicken
coop. Whon the station agent looked
for the coon later on he found frag

apart, ami before if could be realized
the lights on the Capital told that a

earliest riser in Sacramento found his

Scenes similar to the occasion when
the New Eia Edition was distributed
took place at The rail's headquarters

The newsboys were wild over the dls
covey that The Call had arrived at so
early an hour, and some immediately
proceeded to the residence portion of
the city, where they made many sales.
Regular subscribers began to gather
later in order to secure extra copies.
The Call's enterprise was a complete
success iii every particular, and those
who participated in it besides Con

were Brakemen Coakley and EHeves,
Fireman Gibbs and Superintendent

marvelous run.
PEOPLE OF BENICIA
ASTONISHED BY THE
CALL'S EARLY ARRIVAL.
But Still Greater Surprise Was Caused
by the Magnificence of the Mammoth
Golden Jubilee Edition.
BBNICIA, Jan. 23.â The best praise
for enterprise and progressiveness is
the voice of the people; the next best
is the biased criticism of your adver
saries. Both were unstinted in the ex
pression of opinion to-day. The people
won- pleasantly astonished when they
woke up this morning and found the
San Francisco Call at their doors three
hours ahead of the other dailies, but
the greatest astonishment was at the
pap< r itself, and as of late a great deal
has been said about the early history
of the Stati it met a welcome recep
tion, for the reason that it settled all
debate by laying open to public view
the incidents and circumstances per
taining to the growth and development
of California in such a succinct and
graphic manner that all were pleased.
Much praise was given the paper for
its splenedid typographical appearance,
the half tones being the best that have
appeared in any paper yet, and the
frontispiece being both true to life and
color. Take it all in all. The Call made
many friends with its Jubilee Edition,
and as one gentleman in the crowd
said, "Boys, the other daily papers will
have to run a rapid race to be in it
with The Call."
DIXON'S CITIZENS
EXPRESS APPROVAL
OF THE ENTERPRISE.
Subscribers Receive the Golden Jubilee Num-
ber Before Daylight, and Newsboys
Do a Big Business.
DIXOX, Jan. 23.â Many were the ex
pressions of approval of the enterprise
of The Call when the citizens of Dixon
appeared upon the streets this morn
tag after having read their Jubilee
Edition hours in advance of the arrival
of the other San Francisco papers.
The special passed through at 4:50
o'clock, and the papers were distrib
uted to regular subscribers at daylight.
Newsboys also disposed of large num
bers to e?ger buyers during the fore

EAGERLY SCANNED
BY HUNDREDS OF
AUBURN'S RESIDENTS.
Crowds Congregate at the Depot Awaiting
the Arrival of The Call's Special
With the Jubilee Edition.
AUBURN, Jan. 23.â The Call has j
made another scoop over its San Fran- \
<-isco contemporaries. Its Jubilee Edi
tion arrived by special several hours
ahead of the other papers, and its
pages were eagerly scanned by the i
.several hundred pioneers, miners and
other citizens who had congregated at
the depot awaiting the train fmm San
Francisco. Words of commendation j
were heard on nil sides on the attrac
tiveness and general make up of the
paper, and The Call's enterprise
peemed to be appreciated by all. The ;
frontispiece of the horny-handed miner
in pristine costume was true to life, .
and the reminiscences of the early life
of James Marshall were particularly in- I
teresting. The Klondike map was a |
feature and the general collation of j
news well put together.
HOW WOODLAND
RECEIVED THE BIG
JUBILEE EDITION
The Call Accomplished the Greatest Feat
Ever Attempted by a San Francisco
Newspaper.
WOODIÂ«AND, Jan. 23.â "Without a
doubt The Call accomplished the
greatest feat ever attempted by a
newppaprr at Woodland this morning.
Long before the tirst gray streaks of
coming dawn were visible in the east
ern horizon ami ere they had awakened
from their peaceful slumbers the sub
scribers of The Call were served with a
copy of the paper that they might read
and enjoy the news of the day and the
tales of the glorious State's early
pioneers.
The special train bearing the Golden
Jubilee Edition was met at Davlsville.
through which place it passed with
lightning likÂ» rapidity, an: before the
startled inhabitants living near the
depot could realize what had happened
the papers were being delivered by the
local agent and those destined for the
patrons at Woodland were well on the
way. The early morning train for San
Franciboo bearing hundreds of people
to the great celebration was intercept
ed at the Woodland depot, where the
newsboys soon reaped a rich harvest
from the passengers who could hardly
realize that it was possible for a paper
published nearly a hundred miles away
to be on sale before even the local pa
per was off the press and many were
the compliments paid The Call for its
enterprise in issuing such a paper.
Every one who has seen a copy is
loud in praise and In fact, it is al
most the talk of the city. Everywhere
one goes the bright cover of The Call is
to be seen and behind It the beaming
face of some interested citizen. Suc
cess to The Call is every one's wish
In Woodland.

Stanton L. Carter.attorneyâ The Call

W. A. Neville, owner of the Marguer

train and could not believe my ears
when I heard the newsboys with The
CaJL I'm a Call man all over. It is a
splendid paper. That was a great scoop
on yellow journalism.
John Reichman, president of the
Board of Tradeâ The Call's enterprise
is wonderful. It's a big thing to get a
morning paper 260 miles from San
Francisco at the breakfast table.
John McMullin, president of the
Fresno National Bankâ A great issue
and The Call deserves credit tor beat
ing all its rivals by nearly a day.
SIX HOURS AHEAD
OF SAN FRANC/SCO
COMPETITORS AT STOCKTON.
So Welcome Were the Copies of the Jubilee
Edition of The Call That They Were
Scon at a Premium.
STOCKTON, Jan. 23.â The people of
Stockton could hardly believe thelrears
this morning when they heard a legion
of newsboys crying "The Call" on the
streets a few minutes after 9 o'clock.
The papers had hardly been unloaded
from the car till the carriers were
dispatched to the resident portion
of the city, and a swarm of bripht
youngsters were dispensing the mag
nificent Jubilee Edition on the business
thoroughfares. The achievement of the
management was applauded, but creat
ed no great surprise, as The Call for
â event! years past has been considered
the champion of this section, and offi
cial recognition has several times been
made for services in bringing to the
public notice the industrial progress of
the San Joaquin Valley. The yellow
journal arrived nearly six hours later
'. with its very tame special, and the com
parison was not without its effect upon
the thinking people. Before noon the
wagon-load of extras sent in addition
to the 1500 regular subscriptions had
been sold, and this evening there is not
a Call for sale at the newsstands.
On the historical, literary and typo
graphical and art work in the paper
there was only one comment, and that
was that it surpassed any effort ever
1 made by a progressive journal on the
Pacific Coa3t. All the way stations
profited by the time made on the spe
, cial, and to-night The Call is not only
! the most-read paper in the San Joa
quin Valley, hut a journal whose senti
, ments elicit the highest commendation
of all classes.
ONE MORE LAUREL
JUSTLY WON BY THE
SAN FRANCISCO CALL.
Grand Gala Scoop Over Presumptuous Con-
temporaries Causes Surprise and Com
mendation Among Merced People.
MERCED. Jan. 23.â The grand gala
scoop of The Call over its more pre
sumptuous contemporaries by the un
expected and highly appreciated ad
vent of a special Golden Jubilee Edi
tion on a special train at break of day
to-day is, indeed, another laurel Justly
won and of which it may well feel
proud. The populace was not slow to
find it out and made post-haste for the
news stands and the El Capitan Hotel,
where with lavish hand regular and
transient customers were served with
the superb edition, it being fully ten
hours in advance of the other big dail
ies, the general news in which had be
come second-handed by the time of
their arrival at 3:15 p. m.
The consensus of opinion was that
Tbe Call scored an impressive sweep
ing victory and got the call on its
rivals. As the frontispiece represents
a miner holding out to the world its
most precious gift, so does the entire
edition present to the State, the nation
and the world a compendium of the
mining industry of the State, its past,
present and future. Nothing like it
was ever seen in Merced before, and
an admiring public rises enmasse to
honor a scoop complete in itself, the
envy of contemporaries and the pride
of the State. As an interesting, in
structive souvenir of an occasion sec
ond to none in the annals of California
it will be treasured at home for its
wealth of news and spread broadcast
for the information it imparts. The
Call leads, others follow or try to, is
what the masses say.
PASSES THROUGH
MODESTO LONG
BEFORE DAYLIGHT.
But the Jubilee Edition Left by The Caff
Special Causes Words of Commenda
tion for the Enterprise.
MODESTO, Jan. 23.â The Call special
passed through this place at 4 o'clock
this morning. Owing to the early hour
no one was out to meet it. but when
the papers were delivered so early the
recipients gave vent to many words of
commendation of the enterprise of The
Call and of the excellent edition.
LINGERS LONG

But Residents of Bakersfield Receive the
Jubilee Edition From the Special and
Praise the Enterprise.
BAKERPFIELD, Jan. 23.â The Call's j
special train bearing the Golden Jubi
lee Edition arived here this morning
at 9 o'clock. It stole on the town like
the sudden blast of a storm, lingered
five minutes, long enough to change
engines, and then sped away to the
south like a canon ball. So unawares
did it strike the town that few people
realized what had happened until the
papers were being distributed at the
Bakersfield News Company's stand
several minutes later. First a few
came, then followed the rush and ex
citement. 200 copies going in a few
minutes. It was not long till crowds
of people were seen hurrying along
with a Golden Jubilee Edition in their
hands and a smile on their faces.
The Call's agent stated that a great

who had never before read The Call,

subscribers.

BRAVE WIND AND
SNOW TO GREET THE
CALL'S SPECIAL TRAIN.
Despite a Raging Storm Many Residents of
Mohave Gather at the Depot to Greet
the Golden Jubilee Edition.
MOJAVE, Jan. 23.â The Call's special
train with the Golden Jubilee Edition
passed Mojave at 11-30 this morning
and notwithstanding the fact that' a
heavy wind and snow storm was rag
ing a large crowd was gathered at the
depot to see the train and obtain a
copy of the paper. Many comments
were made on the enterprise of The
Call in getting its edition to the public
in these remote towns ahead of all
other dallies of the coast and all pro
nounce it a superb edition and worthy
of praise and patronage. Many re
marks were made also about the fast
time of this train, the distance from
here to Los Angelas, 100 miles, over an
uneven mountainous road being made
in two hours and fifty minutes, which
is considered fast time 00 this part of
the road.
LOS ANGELES
RESIDENTS DAZED
BY THE ENTERPRISE.
But They Soon Recover From Their Suj-
prise and Lose No Time in Securing
Copies of the Jubilee Edition,
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 23.â Many of
the people of Los Angeles thought they
had in some mysterious manner and
unconsciously lost a day out of the
calendar when they heard the news
boys shouting the Sunday Jubilee edi
tion of The Call on the Streets this af
ternoon. It was the first time In the
history frf Journalism on the coast that
a San Francisco newspaper reached
this section of th^ State on the same
day that it appeared in thÂ«> metropolis.
People were simply bewildered and it
was difficult in many cases for the lads
who were selling the paper to make
their customers comprehend the actual
state of affairs; the people were in
clined to look upon fhe boys as being
engaged in a confidence game in a
small way until convinced of the true
situation by being shown a copy of the
paper with its handsomely illustrated
cover and the date thereon. On every
side were heard remarks of astonish
ment that the run should have been
made in quick enough time to permit
(rt having The Call on the streets here
as early as 2:45 o'clock on the day of
Its publication.
And words of praise were generously
bestowed on the management of The
Call for the well directed, judicious and
honect enterprise that mad'> such a
thing possible. This Innovation was
locked upon as only one of the many
indications lately given by The Call
that a new era had dawned in journal
ism on the Pacific Coast and that The
<^all was determined to be the leader
in this new journalism that has for its
watchword 'Truth, accuracy, decency,
enterprise and progress."
It lacked but a few minutes of 2:30
p. m. when the special train contain'*ig
the many thousand copies of The Call
dt-stined for Los Angeles and the Other
cities and towns south of this point
pulled into the Arcade depot. All the
necessary arrangements had lieen made
by J. M. Cremin. the superintendent of
circulation of The Call, who is now in
Lo3 Angeles, for the prompt dispatch
of the papers to the other towns in
Southern California, and by H. W. Pat
ton, the local agent of The Call, for the
prompt distribution of the papers to
the subscribers in this city. In less
than fifteen minutes from the time the
engine came to a stop in the Arcade
depot the newpboys were selling The
Sunday Call on the streets, and before
the shades of night descend. â Â«! upon the
city many thousand copies had been
disposed of, notwithstanding the fact
that but few people are on the streets
on Sunday.
Here are a few expressions of opinion
on the enterprise of The Call in giving
to the people of Los Angeles a San
Francisco paper on the day it is pub
lished in the city at the Golden Gate:
Senator Robert N. Bu!laâ This is a
remarkable and commendable piece of
enterprise from many standpoints.
One thing of importance that it demon
strates is how much less time need be
consumed in mnking the trip between
San Francisco and Los Angeles if the
railroad company would always do its
beet. It shows that The Call is not go
ing to let the matter of expense stand
In its way when its purpose is to serve
the people; it shows that the new
management of Tho fall has adopted
a policy unfior which it intends to give
the people the best possible service In
every respect, whether inside or out-
Bide the city.
Dr. M. M. Knnnon â It Is a wonderful
performance. I never heard of such a
thing before.
Mark R. Planted, editor nf the River-
Bide Enterprise â I think this is the
first time any of the San Francisco
papers have done anything of this
kind. It he-ems to me that the new-
management of The Call is now get
tine: oat a paper that, if the present
policy is maintained, will soon leave
all others behind. The running of a
special train to Los Angeles is a groat
piece of en'trprise. It is in line with
my idea of journalism.
J. Fred Schmeispr. recording secre
tary of the Council of Labor â I think
it a groat stroke of enterprise on the
pnrt of The Call. This departure will
be certain to attract the attention of
the people generally to The Call, and
will show that its enterprise will not
fellow anything to stand in the way of
serving the people.
Milo M. Potter, proprietor of the
Hotel Van Nuysâ The Call deserves the
highest compliments for undertaking
and carrying out such an innovation.
It shows what can be done by people
of energy and enterprise. It is won
derful thai a paper can be published
500 miles i>way from here and be here
on the same day it is published. If
The Call keeps up this kind of enter
prise, the result will be that it will set
a pace for Its competitors that will
make them hustle. To my surprise
many of the Eastern people who are
stopping here remarked about The
Call's feat and paid it many compli
ments. Usually they take little or
no notice of California papers pub
lished outside of Los Angeles.
Charles H. O'Neill, secretary of the
Silver Republican Clvb â "When the
Sunday Call came to tne headquarters
of our club this afternoon, a number of
the members were present, and the
enterprise of The Call was the subject
of much favorable comment. Surprise
was expressed that the paper could be
brought down here in less than half a
day. Such a thing was never before
known. This shows The Call to be
the most enterprising newspaper in
San Francisco to-day.
HONORING THE MEMORY
OF MONTEREY PIONEERS.
Movement Started for the Erection of a
Monument to the Old Town's First
Settlers.
MONTEREY, Jan. 23.â A movement to
fittingly honor the memory of departed
California pioneers has been started
among the Monterey pioneers, having
boon suggested by the Golden Jubilee
about to open in San Francisco. Some
of the men foremost in the making of
California's history are, or were, resi
dents of Monterey, and the townspeople
now feel that in neglecting proper honors
to those who are dead they have omitted
a duty the performance of which would
have done the town great credit. The
plans on which the new idea is to be car
ried out are not yet formulated and no
definite organization haa been expected,
but already the talk has had substantial
results, and the grave of Pioneer "Jack"
Swan, th. most recently deceased of the
Monterey bund, has been honored with a
neat heacst..i ....
John A. Swan, or "Juan Choppo," as
Spanish people nicknamed him be
of his diminutive stature, came to
Monterey in im:s, and so was one of the
earliest pioneers. Being a native of Eng
land and a British subject, he took no
active part in the forming of California
Statehood, but when she became a State
he became a naturalized American citi
xen Hnd was always thereafter an active
and patriotic member of the new com
monwealth. Not having grown wealthy
with the State's growth, as so many Cali
fornia ptonecn have done he. In his last
days, became dependent on the State for
support, and. weakened in mind and body,
died at the county hospital on January
6, 189fi. at the ape of 79 years. All the
old residents of the county knew "Jack"
Swan.
Francis Doud Sr.. a pioneer of the early
Ms, and James n. Bntvely, both of whom
are amoner Monterey's most prominent
ftizer.s. have borne the expense of fenc
ing and otherwise improving the plat of
ground that surrounds the grave of Swan,
and have also, in connection with one or
two others, erected the headstone which
N'-ars the name, age, etc., of the dead
pioneer.
Tt Is believed that a permanent mem
orial organization will soon be effected,
with the surviving pioneers at its head.

TAOOMA, Jnn. 23.â Late Japanese pn
pers state that as soon as China has set

Hiogo News yays that In October a
Preach priest and two followers fell vic

It is reported that three Russians have

NEW YORK. Jan. 23.â T0 the
Editor of the San Francisco
Call: I hope that during the
next half century the Golden
State will be attended with the
great prosperity that has been
witnessed during the past fifty
years. There is not the least
bit of doubt in my mind but that
it will be. I hope that the com
ing generation will be as vigor
ous in the next fifty years as
those of the past half century.
The proposed rush to Klondike
reminds me of the rush to the
gold fields of California, except
that we had much more to rush
for in those days. And then we
had climate, productive soil and
the prospect of permanent
homes. Seekers of gold in the
far North will get what they
can as quickly as they can and
then hurry away. It was nqt
so in the "days of '49." Califor
nia proved attractive and of the
thousands who came many re
mained. California's future is
bright. It all depends upon her
people and they are certainly
going to take the best of care of
tlveir great State.
J. B. HAGGIN.
NEW YORK, Jan. 23.â T0 the Editor
of the San Francisco Call: As a very
early resident of California, watching
and participating in Its development, I
am glad to see the real pioneer times
commemorated and honored. Too much
credit cannot be given to the builders
of such a State. My unbounded faith
in its future has never slackened from
the time of first stepping on the shores
of that glorious larid early in the year
of 1R49. California is indeed a great
State, and it will assort its superiority
In climate and products. All it seems
to need Is the refinement that time is
sure to give it. D. O. MILLS.
NEW YORK. Jan. 23.â Tn the BMHtor
of the San Francisco Call: I want
to see California succeed. That big
State out there in the far West pos
sesses everything to make her future
a great one , but there must be a
change in the people. Although lam
living here, my thoughts are of Cali
fornia, which, if her people had been
more energetic in the past thirty years,
would to-day have a population of
three million. The people must change,
I reiterate, if they expect any great
improvement in the State. Not a
change for the day, but a continuing
work â all working for the interests of
the State rather than for themselves
and against others. They should or
ganize and pull together and much
good will result.
C. P. RTNTINGTON.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â T0 the Ed
itor of the San Francisco Call: I send
congratulations and best wishes to the
people of California In their celebration
commemorating the fiftieth anniver
sary of the discovery' of gold there.
California Is one of the greatest States
In the Union. It possesses many re
sources of wealth and Its climate Is
unsurpassable. Its gold and other
mining interests I believe inexhausti
ble. Its fruit and agricultural Inter
ests are surpassed by none. Some of
the most pleasant days of my life were
spent there among Its hospitable peo
ple whose belief is one that the rest of
this great nation should follow: "Live
and let others live." San Francisco
Is a great city and the recent discov
eries In Alaska will only tend to make
its future brighter.
RICHARD P. BLAND.
[Mr. Bland spent ten years in Cali

places and at Virginia City, Nevada.]
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â T0 the Ed
itor of the San Francisco Call: I
heartily congratulate the good people
of California in their commemoration
of the discoveries that fifty years ago
astounded the world, but I glory in
the thought that California is now
producing many things infinitely bet
ter than gold.

PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 23.â The steamer
Oregon sailed for Alaska to-night with
450 passengers and 250 tons of general
merchandise and bag-gage. Fifty head
of live stock was also part of the cargo.
All day long thousands of people swarmed
about the steamer's dock and so grt';it
was the crush to-night that ten police
men were detailed to handle the crowd.
No less than 300 people who applied for
passage were refused, and many hundred
tons of freight is lying on the dock await
ing transportation to the gold fields.
The rush to the Yukon from every port
in the Northwest has begun earlier than
was anticipated by the transportation
companies, and every steamer that leaves
is compelled to refuse both passengers
and freight. The demand for lumber in
Alaska is enormous, but steamship com
panies refuse to carry it, preferring to
take less bulky freight, leaving the lum
ber for sailing vessels.

brought news that a warrant is out for
the arrest of United States Commissioner
John U. Smith of Skaguay on five
charges. These are reported to be solic
iting a bribe, receiving a bribe, felony,
malfeasance and misfeasance in office.
Dr. Hornsby, a member of the Skaguay
Council, has filed three affidavits, cover
ing these charges, with Judge Johnson of
the United States District Court. The
affidavits are sworn to by Skaguay busi
ness men. The names of the prosecutors
and the details of the charges had not
been made public when the Seattle left
Skaguay.
Before filing the charges Dr. Ilornsby
told Smith what he intended to do. Smith
thought the charges should be first in
vestigated by a committee of citizens, but
Hornsby believed such a course would
not be legal, and with public feeling so
much against him. Smith could not hope
for an impartial hearing.
Reports of the commissioner's alleged
illegal actions have been received here
from time to time. It is believed by pas
sengers on the steamer who are familiar
\ with the situation that a thorough inves
, tigation will now be had. Last fall Smith
was charged with illegally demanding
! fees for registering town lots. An exam
i iner from the Department of Justice went
to Skaguay to investigate. He believed
Smith had no Intention of wrongdoing,
and no action was taken.
TWO MEN MEET DEATH
IN ANTI-JEWISH RIOTS.
Mob in Algiers Drives Merchants Into the
Streets and Wrecks Build
ings.
ALGIERS. Jan 23.â Anti-Jewish riots
â were renewed here to-da.y. The mob in
vaded the Jewish quarter and pillaged the
shops In the Rue Babazoua, driving the
Jewish merchants outinto the streets. A
squadron of chasseurs was ordered to the
sVene and charged the mob with drawn
sworris, but the mob re-formed further on
cheering for the army.
Revolvers and daggers were freely used.
One man who was stabbed in the back
and shot in the head, died on the spot,
and many WGTt seriously wounded, one,
named Cayol, dying from his wounds at
4 o'clock this afternoon. The crowd hear
ing of this became dangerously excited,
shoutlnc :
"They're murdering us. Death to the
Jews!"
The mob then resumed its pillaging.
The fronts of six shops were destroyed.
The police repeatedly charged the rioters,
but were stubbornly resisted and were
powerless to restore order until the troops
arrived. Several policemen were severely
maltreated. Many arrests for theft have
been made. The Jewish authorities rec
ommend their co-religionists to remain in
doors. Both the men killed in the riots
were Christians, and their companions
have sworn to avenge them. It is feared
there will be further riots
Standing By the Valley Road.
VISALIA, Jan. 23.â 1n the week just

went over the Valley Road, and he says
all his stock goes that way hereafter,
now that the Valley Road people have
their stock corrals ready for use. This is
only one instance out of many that show
how the farmers and stockmen are stand

PEOPLE WIN A VICTORY.
Editor Spalding Vainly Pleads to
Save His Hireling Journal From
Chastisement
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 23.â Another
signal battle in the war for complete
ownership of the water works of the
people, by the people and for the peo
ple has been fought and won. Incident
ally the forces of those Judas sheets, the
Times. Herald and Express, composing
the syndicated press of Los Angeles,
were ignobly routed and driven in con
fusion from the field.
One of these misconceptions of jour
nalism made a desperate and pitiful
attempt to obtain a truce before the
battle opened. Managing Editor Spald
ing of the Herald, fearing his position
and salary were in jeopardy, cried
"Peecavi." By means of two special
peace commissioners he sought to
withdraw his water-logged craft from
the impending conflict. He agreed to
metaphorically spike his guns and to
hereafter cease from troubling the
brave defenders of the people's rights
and to put hi? vicious pen at rest, at
least so far as the water question was
concert
Editor Spa'ding'rf misgivings proved
to be well founded. His treach
erous, venal and mendacious jour
nal was in substance read out of
the Democratic party, which it has
been seeking to betray, and hand over
to the paper's owners, the Los Angeles
City Water Company. At the same
time those whom the Herald has been
denouncing and abusing, including the
San Francisco Call, were commended
for their position and course in seek
ing to prevent the people of Los An
from being mulcted of nearly two
million dollars.
Th.- field of battle was the Southern |
â¢nia Musk Hall in the P.radbury
building, where the Democratic City
".ittee met on Saturday night to
consider the all-absorbing water ques
tion.
What Little opposition there was to
the general sentiment of the members
of the commits ed by John W.
Mitchell, who la neither a member of
the Democratic City Committee, nor a
resident of the city of Los Angeles.
He dis;,!:. urajre that would
have been sublime had it not, under
the circumstances, been ridiculous.
This veteran and valliant defender of
monopolies, true to his principles and
in consonance with his apparently in
nate principles, with oÂ» proxy in his
hand, sophistry on his tongue, hatred,
malice and treachery in his heart,
shamelessly flaunted his corporation
livery and loyalty in the face of the
people. He entered upon his task
like a raging lion seeking whom he
might devour. Ho left the hall like
a jackal who had been whipped and
driven from his prey.
As soon as Chairman Telfair Creigh
ton Issued the call for the meeting of
the Democratic City Central Commit
tee, the water company and all the
influence, individual and corporate,
that it could command was placed [q
the field with instructions to defeat
the resolution of indorsement at all
hazards and at any price. A poll of
tho committee demonstrated to the
corporation that not only would the
resolution indorsing The Call be
passed, but it also disclosed that a
two-thirds majority was In favor of
denouncing the position of the alleged
Democratic organ, the Herald, on the
â¢water question, and declaring to the
public that that paper in its course as
to municipal ownership did not voice
the sentiments of the people, and.
more particularly, of the Democratic
party of Los Angeles.
This threw the water company into a
state of alarm and the editor of its
mouthpiece, the Herald, realized fully
the position he was about to be placed
in for his treachery to the people.
Editor Spalding dispatched a special
peace embassy to Messrs. Snyder, Grl
der and others, asking them to oppose
the proposition to, by resolution, de
nounce the Herald and Indorse The
call, in consideration of this favor
.Editor Spalding agreed to humiliate
If and to grovel in tho very dust
at th>- feet of the men whom, as public
servants, he has denounced time with
out number for their course on the
writer question. He was willing to
promise that he would not again assail
them for the stand they had taken for
the people, and that in the future he
would not offend.
Mr. Grtder s;tid tn the Herald special
pleaders that if Editor Spalding would
appear before the whole Democratic
city committee and admit that all that
the Herald had said in denunciation of
the efforts of Mayor Snyder, Council
man Hutchison and himself to procure
municipal ownership for the people in
accordance, with the pledge contained
in the Democratic city platform was
false and untrue, and that it would not
be again misstated by the. Herald, he
then would ask his friends not to con
demn the Herald.
The peace commissioners could not
agree to the terms. Editor Spalding
was willing to make a private confes
sion, but his manhood is of that caliber
that no one who knows him could ex
pect him to stand up and make it to
the world. So the negotiations fell
through anr] a last dying effort v/as
made in the committee to carry out
"the water company's programme. It
failed utterly.
As early as 6:30 p. m. the members
of the committee, which includes over
seventy Democrats, began to gather at
the Southern California Music Hall.
At 8:15 there wore over forty members
of the committee present, and some
twenty more were represented by
proxy. Then Chairman Creighton
(ailed the meeting to order. He made a
few remarks, appealing to those pres
ent to take no action that would result
in marked discord, and he advised all
*â¢Â» be guided by due regard for the in
THE THIEVING YELLOW SHEET
BRANDED WITH ITS LATEST LIE.
The exposure in The Call on Saturday of the trick by which the Examiner
intended to pass off as its own a series of pictures which of right belonged to the
Placerville Mountain Democrat was promptly followed by the Examinerism usual in
such cases, now becoming common.
Caught in a steal the taker defended itself with a lie. It attempted to ex
plain away the offense yesterday first, by referring to the steal as "cribbing," as if
it were a trivial misdemeanor ; second, by calling the Mountain Democrat "an ob
scure little paper," implying that to steal from a little paper is a minor offense ;
and third, by declaring the pictures in question had been collected for the Examiner
and that the Examiner had consented to permit the Mountain Democrat to use some
of them on the day after the appearance of their publication in the Examiner itself.
Neither of these defenses will stand this morning. The pictures were not
obtained by semi-pardonable "cribbing," but by despicable fraud. The Moun
tain Democrat is not an obscure little paper, but a journal big enough to defend itself
and force the Examiner to lie in order to get out of a controversy with it; and finally
the statement that the Examiner owned the pictures by right of priority and enter
prise in obtaining them is exposed as a piece of mendacity as shameless as any
which has ever issued even from the notorious liars' den on Mission street.
The following letter from the Mountain Democrat sets forth all the facts and
leaves the Examiner once more branded and blackened with the burn and the stain
of its own fraud and falseness :
PLACERVILLE, Cal., Jan. 23, 1898.
Editor Call, San Francisco, Cal: To-day's Examiner, received here this
evening, denounces as false my letter, upon which The Call based its charges in
reference to the publication in that paper of matter belonging to the Mountain Dem
ocrat.
Whatever apprehensions I entertained that the Examiner may have been
wronged by The Call's expose, by reason of having been imposed upon in the
innocent purchase of pictures belonging to another paper, are now dispelled by its
own admissions.
The Examiner proceeds to explain that it purchased from Mr. A. Thurston Hey
don the right to use the Marshall pictures a month ago; that Mr. Heydon then stated
that he would like to let the Democrat's editor use a few of the pictures for a contem
plated jubilee edition, and to this the Examiner consented, on the understanding that
the Democrat jubilee paper would not appear until the day after that Qf the Exami
ner. No such arrangement had been made with the knowledge or sanction of the
Democrat, although Mr. Heydon had been in the employ of that paper upon its jubi
lee edition since September last
In justice to The Call and to fortify it with facts in contemplation of Mr. Hey
don's threatened interview, I will state that Mr. Heydon was employed at his own
solicitation upon the Democrat's jubilee edition on the 20th day of September. The
terms of his employment were that he should write and illustrate the articles to ap
pear in the paper and receive therefor his traveling expenses and a s:ated percentage
of all business obtained by him. Mr. Heydon's expenses paid by the Democrat in
clude the camera plates used by him.
In pursuance of his employment he delivered all the Marshall photos printed
in the Examiner to the Democrat on October 26" h, and the paper at its own expense
procured the half-tone cuts thereof on November 22. The same is true of the picture
of Marshall lying dead in his cabin, except that the cut of it was received Decem
ber 21.
Not until the Examiner had used the telephone to call down Mr. Heydon on
the day of The Call's expose did that gentleman ever acknowledge or intimate to any
one connected with the Democrat that he was responsible for the purloining of the
Marshall pictures. Then, when upbraided in the office of the Democrat for peddling
out pictures previously sold to that paper, he repeatedly and emphatically denied
any knowledge that the Examiner was to come out with those pictures on the day
preceding the Democrat, thereby branding himself or the Examiner or both as liars.
terests of the people and the party in
all that they did.
As soon as the roll had been called
Committeeman Reese offered the fol
lowing resolution:
Beaolved, That the Democratic City
Central Committee of Los Angeles city.
sympathizing with the people <>f Los An
geles <lty in their efforts to have tne.
municipality of Los Angeles own and con
trol its water supply, congratulate the
people of said city upon the course of The
San Francisco Call and Los Angeles Rec
ord in taking up the cause of the people
in their contest with corporate monopoly
and city officials false to their pledged.
Resolved, further. That we condemn the
course of the Los Angeles Times, Herald
and Express in espousing the cause of the
water com par y and opposing the inter
ests of the people The Los Angeles Her
ald is no longer a Democratic paper. Its
editor la :i Republican, and the paper,
controlled by plutocrats for the benefit of
a trio of grasping monopolies, is no long
er entitled to the support or patronage of
any Democrat.
To this resolution Daniel Neuhart
offered as a substitute a resolution
which simply commended the course of
Messrs. Snyder.Grider.Hutchinson and
Dockweller on the water question. Then
several amendments were offered and
points of order made. As the commit
tee was getting into a tangle Earl Rog
ers moved that the substitute be laid
upon the table. The motion prevailed.
Then Mr. Rogers moved that the
chair appoint a committee of five to
draw appropriate resolutions on the
subject and report back to the commit
tee within fifteen minutes. The motion
was adopted and Chairman Creighton
designated the following committee:
Karl Rogers. Daniel Neuhirt. George
YV. Retzer, if. W. Conkling and A. W.
Fisher. The committee withdrew and
a recess of fifteen minutes was de
clared.
Finally the committee was again
'ailed to order and the special com
mittee, through Mr. Rogers, reported
the following resolutions signed by
every member of the committee save
Daniel Neuhart:
Resolved, That we. the Democratic City
Central Committee, hereby do indorse the
coarse of Mayor Snyder In carrying:
out the sentiments and pledges of the
Democratic i>];itfi>rm upon the subject o?
the ownership of the water and water
systems by the city of Los Angeles; and,
further, we indorse and commend the ac
tions of all city officials who have suport
ed and Bided him In his endeavors to re
deem the pledges of our party.
Wo further commend and acknowledge
ourselves Indebted to all newspapers,
whether published here or elsewhere,
which are endeavoring to aid us in our
light to defeat attempts to obtain unfair
and inequitable settlement of pending
We condemn the course of all individ
uals and newspapers, whether claiming to
be Democratic or not. who are opposed to
the wishes and rights of the people In
this Kreat matter.
As soon as the resolutions had been
read Mr. Neuhart made a minority re
port for the "special committee, which
simply excluded the last two para
graphs of the report of the majority.
He moved its adoption.
Then arose John W. Mitchell from
the rear of the hall. Attorney Foley
made the point that Mitchell did not
reside in the city, and that it was ill
timed and impudent of Mitchell to
take up the time of the committee when
his advice had neither been asked for
nor solicited. M. W. Conkling moved
THE SAX FBAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JAXUAEY 24, 1898.
that Mitchell be heard on behalf of the
Herald. Mitchell then made a school
boy talk for the Neuhart minority re
port.
The effect of Mitchell's speech was
apparent when the vote on the report
was taken. It was overwhelmingly de
feated. Then the resolutions reported
by the committee were adopted.
Committeeman O'Brien, obtaining the
eye of the chairman, was recognized,
and offered the following resolution:
\\ - an- in the midst of a tight here on
the municipal ownership of a water plant,
and we cannot, as Democrats, overlook
assistance, no matter from what source
it may come. Therefore, as Democrats
assembled, we do take occasion to thank
The San Francisco Call and the Evening
Record of this city for the able assistance
they have rendered In the water light.
Seconds came from all parts of the
hall. The chairman put the resolution
to a vote and it was adopted with loud
acclaim.
Then followed a scene which is sel
dom witnessed in a city committee
meeting. Members cheered and ap
plauded and spectators Joined in. There
was shaking of hands and congratula
tions, and upon all sides were expres
sions of satisfaction heard. The water
company had been most emphatically
turned down in its efforts to manipu
late the committee.

CLARK NOW
RECRETS HIS
CONFESSION
The Murder Suspect
Fears Death by
the Rope.
Sorry That He Confirmed
His Sister-in-L-aw's
Accusations.
Admits Undue Intimacy, but
Swears He Is Innocent of
Murder.
HER STORY IS BELIEVED.
Nnpa County People Confident That
the Prisoner Took His Broth
er's Life.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA. Jan. 23. â George Willard
Clark's startling admission to The Call
correspondent last evening has given
him much regret to-day. He said %vhen
seen this afternoon that he was in an
excited and unaccountable state of
mind; otherwise he would not have
said what he did. Last night at 9
o'clock Sheriff McKenzle visited the
cell of the murderer to tell him what
liis victim's widow had sworn to at the
Inquest. Accompanying the Sheriff
was The Call representative, -who at
the request of the Sheriff read to the
accused all the evidence adduced at
the Inquest. Clark listened attentively,
but was nervous and uneasy. When
the reading was completed he coughed
several times and said:
"As God is my witness I am inno
cent."
Sheriff McKenzle then arose and
spoke as follows:
"Mr. Clark, I desire to Inform you, if
you are not aware of it, that you need
not speak unless you wish to. Talk if
you desire, but don't If you wish not."
The prisoner proceeded to talk, how
ever, and close questioning brought
forth the admission that he had been
intimate with his brother's wife.
"She has told me that I am the father
of one or more of her children," he
said, "but I do not know it, and I think
it is false."
This is the admission over which he
feels regret to-day.
"I was crowded last night and said
more than I should have said," re
marked Clark. A moment later he
said:
"My friend, when the critical mo
ment arrives I will tell the truth, no
matter who it hurts."
He was questioned as to the meaning
of this, but he would not explain. This
afternoon the Salvation Army corps
Visiting the prisoner in his cell. They
sang a few hymns and then invited
him to pray. He consented and in sub
stance prayed as follows:
"O Lord, thou knowest the minds of
all. Thou knowest the good and thou
knowest the wicked. Bless us this day
and do unto us as we would be done by.
Be merciful to us and forgive those
whe sin against thee. Thou knowest,
O Lord, that I, accused of a great
crime, am Innocent. Help me in my
hour of need and deliver me in the end,
from those who would wrong me. So
might it be."
A while after the departure of the
Salvationists several members of the
Adventlst faith arrived from St. He
lena and visited the prisoner in his cell.
"I sent for them," said Clark, "for in
the present trying moment they are the
dearest friends I have on earth. Ju3t
now I would prefer to see nobody but
Christiansâ good earnest Christians at
that. A few -weeks ago I was in corre
spondence with the Pacific Press Pub
lishing Company relative to canvassing
for certain books of theirs, and if this
trouble hadn't occurred I would now
have been working for them."
There remains but little doubt that
Clark is guilty. The sentiment against
him Is general. The story of the widow
Is so plausible and the circumstances
so fit her revelations that it seems im
possible for him to escape the gallows.
Last night, under the fire of several
reporters, Clark nearly broke down and
went so far as to say, "It looks as
though I must take the rope."
He was worried to-day because the
attorney who he thought would take
his case had stayed away from him.
He did not seem to know that he was
entitled to counsel whether he had
funds or not.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Jan. 23.â Next month
Colonel S. EL Wright of the Sixth Regi
ment, N. G. C, will leave for the Klon
dike, resigning his colonelcy. This
means that Fresno, after being the reg
imental headquarters since the resig
nation of Colonel J. J. Nunan of Stock
ton last winter, will again lose the
military post, which Will go back to
the Mill Cay. William Johnson of
Stockton, who was elected lieutenant
colonel a few weeks ago in tins city,
will advance to the colonelcy. John
son had been captain oÂ£ Company A
at Stockton for a great many years,
and, after the first proximo, he will
issue orders from Stockton for the
Sixth Regiment instead of the orders
coming from this city. C. O. Lemon,
first lieutenant of Company C ot this
city, will accompany Colonel Wright
and he will endeavor to obtain a fur
lough.
Colonel Wright and Lieutenant Lem
on returned from San Francis.. > on the*
midnight train last night, having made
arrangements for their northern trip.
They have a dog team and are all
equipped for their voyage. Lieutenant
Lemon will return to the metropolis
next Wednesday to complete the ar
rangements and will be joined there by
Colonel Wright next month. Colonel
Wright, upon his return last night, au
thorized the statement in regard to his
Klondike trip and his resignation as
colonel of the Sixth Regiment.
The Fresno musicians are the most
anxious about the change which will
be caused by Colonel Wright's resigna
tion. Before his promotion to the
colonelcy the regimental band was sta
tioned at Stockton, but when he as
sumed charge of the regiment he di
vided it, half the band being in Stock
ton and the other half being organized
from Fresno musicians here under
leader ('ray of this city. It is feared
that when Johnson becomes colonel he
will nsain give Stockton the full band.
It is tacitly understood that Captain
Cook of I'.akersfield, who was John
son's chief rival for the lieutenant
colonelcy at the election here a few
weeks ago. will receive the support of
the commissioned officers for the lieu
tenant-colonelcy. In fact he received
a personal assurance from Major Grant
of Stockton that he would be sup
ported for advancement at the very
first vacancy, and it was on account of
that pledge that Cook's friends sup
ported Johnson toward the close of the
fight. Should Lemon be unable to pro
cure the desired furlough a vacancy
will occur in Company C. which will
result in the advancement of Second
Lieutenant Jones of that company.
Jones is now acting as adjutant during
the absence of Adjutant O. Scribnor.
The guardsmen here are very much
grieved over the fact that Fresno will
lose the headquarters of the regiment,
particularly as Stockton has had the
post during the many years of J. J.
Nunan'a colonelcy, and a strong effort
will be made to retain half of the regi
mental band.
HAWAIIAN VOTE
WILL BE LATE
Senate Will Not Consider the
Treaty During This
Week.
Final Action on the Measure Not
Likely Until Lata in
February.
â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON*, Jan. 23.â present
outlook Is unfavorable to the Senate's
Riving much attention to the Hawaiian
treaty during this week. The agreement
to vote on Thursday on the Teller reso
lution confirming the doctrine that United
States bonds are payable in silver at the
option of the Government will, in all
probability, result in the Senate's giving
the major portion of its time until that
date to this measure, with the exception
of that necessary to the consideration of
appropriation bills. 'Senator Turpie has
given notice of a speech on the Teller
resolution this week, and It is expected
speeches for it will be made by Senator
Teller. Pett'.grew. White and others, and
that there will be some addresses in oppo
sition. Senator Nelson has offered an
amendment declaring for the mainte
nance of the parity of the two metals, but
the silver men. considering this proposed
modification hostile to their purposes, will
not accept it. They say they will insist
upon a vote upon the resolution as it
stands. - â  s *Seh
The pension appropriation bill will be
called; up. Monday, and as soon as it is
disposed of the Senate will be asked to
take up the legislative, executive and Ju
dicial appropriation bill. Each of these
will provoke some debate, but it Is not
expected to be prolonged in either case.
When the treaty next comes up Senator
Teller will be recognized to speak in its
support, and he probably will be followed
by Senator White in opposition. The vote
on the treaty now appears at least three
weeks distant.
The House programme for this week in
cludes little of interest beyond the limits
of the District of Columbia. Almost the
entire week will be devoted to the District
of Columbia appropriation bill. It is ex
pected the Indian appropriation bill. the
consideration of which was begun yester
day, will be completed to-morrow*. The
only item in the bill which is likely to
cause much of a contest is that providing
for the leasing of the gilsonite beds of
the Uncompahsrre reservation in Utah.
This provision was beaten In the last In
dian bill, and will be stubbornly contested
now. The district bill will probably con
sume the remainder of the week.

Ing. Notwithstanding the heavy storm
which delayed suburban trains In the
vicinity of Chicago half an houi the
first section of the Chicago and North
western Railroad train No. 2, known
as the overland limited from San Fran
cisco, pulled into the depot in Chicago
within twenty minutes of the schedule
time.
A distinguished party greeted the
Pretfdent of the little Island republic
on his arrival. The Federal Govern
ment was represented by Judge Gross
cup, General John C. IflflTfT. United
Slates District Attorney; Thomas E.
McMillln. clerk of the United States
District Court, and Hen. Thomas W.
Cridler of the State Department at
Washington. Chicago was represented
by Mayor Harrison and the army
and navy by Major Heistand and Lieu
tenant-Commander Fhelps respective
ly, who were resplendent in full-dress
uniform and several pounds of gold
lace. In addition to these gentlemen
the President was welcomed by Gen
eral Brooke and his staff, consisting of
captain Richards and Lieutenants
Dean and McKenna; Hon. F. A. Hatch,
Minister to the United States from Ha
waii; William Perm Nixon, Dr. Henry
C. Lyman and the Chicago Consul, Dr.
F. W. Job.
President Dole's party consisted of
himself, Mrs. Dole, Secretary laukea
and Dr. Day, his physician. The fol
lowing ladies were also present: Mrs.
Grosscup, Mrs. Harrison and Mrs.
Brooke. On arriving In Chicago the
reception committee entered President
Doles private cur and welcomed him
to Chicago. The first to shake hands
with him was Judge Grosscup, who
said:
â¢â¢President Dole, I am instructed by
the President of the United States to
welcome you here. I am pleased to in
troduce you to Secretary Cridler. rep
resenting the President, and Mayor
Harrison of Chicago."
After the exchange of courtesies and
a welcome to Chicago on behalf of the
city by Mayor Harrison, President
Dole cordially responded to the greet
ing, and seemed pleased with the
hearty reception given to him. Mrs.
Dole, who won the hearts of every one
present by her unaffected and pleasant
manner, thanked the ladies of the com
mittee for coming out so early in the
day to welcome her, and seemed to ap
preciate very highly the reception Bhe
received in Chicago.
The party at once proceeded in car
riages to the Auditorium Annex, where
suite 1102 had been reserved for the
guests. Their rooms are situated at
the northeast corner of the hotel on
the parlor floor, and are the same
apartments occupied by President Mc-
Klniey two years ago, when he visited
Chicago to address the Marquette Club.
The suite, which was decorated with
La France roses and draped with a
Hawaiian flag, consists of a drawing
room and three bedrooms.
On arriving at the hotel General
Brooke extended an invitation to Presi
dent and Mrs. Dole to visit Fort Sheri
dan on Monday morning, where a
parade of the garrison will be given in
their honor. The invitation was ac
cepted, and the party will leave Chi
cago to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock
by special train on the Chicago and
Northwestern, returning to Chicago at
noon.
This morning President and Mrs.
Dole attended the Church of the Mes
siah. At 1 o'clock to-morrow a lunch
eon will be tendered the distinguished
guests at Kinsley's by a number of
former residents of Hawaii and other
friends. Dr. Henry Lyman has charge
of this affair, which promises to be a
very pleasant reunion of old acquaint
ances At 3 o'clock a formal reception
will l>e held at the Union League Club,
to which invitations have been for
warded to all the clubs in Chicago and
which will give President Dole an op
portunity of meeting a representative
body of Chicago citizens.
While the arrangements are not en
tirely completed, it is probable that
President Dole will leave Chicago at
10:30 a. m. Tuesday morning for Wash
ington by the Baltimore and Ohio road,
this company having tendered him the
use of the finest private car in its serv
ice.
One of the attentions most appreciat
ed by the visitors has been the offer of
Manager Stevenson of the Long Ins
tance Telephone Company of the free
use of their wires while in Chicago.
WORST STORM IN YEARS
SWEEPS THROUGH THE EAST.
Railway Schedules Demoralized Through the
Breaking Down of Telegraph
Wires.
CHICAGO. Jan. 23.â The snowstorm of
last night and this morning was the
worst in this city for years. The great
est damage was caused by the breaking
down of telegraph and telephone wires.
The police telephone system was badly
crippled and there was much trouble
with the city fire alarm system. The
street-car service which last night was
badly delayed and totally suspended on
some of the lines was in better running
order to-day. Snow plows and sweepers
were kept going all night. All the inconu
ing trains on all the roads were from one
to four hours late. Station Master dith
ers of the Union depot said that Saturday
night was one of the worst railroading
nights he had ever known. On account
of the breaking down of the telegraph
wires they were totally at sea as to the
whereabouts of the trains.
Reports from Important points East
South and West tell of unusually severe
storms.

Joined the fleet. An important mes
sage was received here at 11 o'clock for
Admiral Sicard, but there Is no way
of transportation to the fleet.
Telegrams received from Havana
last night state that oxtra guards had
been placed around General Lee's of
fice for protection. Circulars were
distributed around Havana, calling on
the volunteers for the protection of the
American colony. There is no news
of an attempt to assassinate Lee.
The commander of the naval station
at Key West received, a message from
General Lee this afternoon. He says
the city is safe, but there is suppressed
excitement in the American colony. The
white squadron is anchored at Key
West and will sail for Dry Tortugas
early to-morrow morning.
A special to the Times-Union and
Citizen from Key West says: There
has been excitement in this city during
the last twenty-four hours, due to an
alarming telegram from Havana stat
ing that the streets had been Hooded
with an anonymous ultra-Spanish cir
cular, calling upon all anti-Americans
to mobilize and raid the American
colony. Captain-General Blanco, fear
ful that the rabid element of the city
might attempt such violence, placed an
extra military guard around Consul-
General Lee's office. Many of the
Americans of th>- < ity who believe that
they are in real danger have prepared
their affairs in any emergency. This
news is what gave rise to the rumor
that General Lee had been assassinated.
The Spanish Consul here was uneasy
over the repeated rumors td the effect
that General Lee had fallen a victim
to assassins, and wired to the authori
ties of Havana for the truth.
MADRID. Jan. 23.â The report that
American warships have been ordered
to Cuban waters has caused great ex
citement here. The Imparcial, in the
course of a violent article, says: "We
see now the eagerness of the Yankees
to eeize Cuba."
A grand banquet was given at the
palace this evening in honor of the
name day of the King. The members
of the cabinet and the principal mem
bers of the diplomatic corps were pres
ent. Tho Cabinet met afterward and
decided, so it is reported, to address
a manifesto to the country. One Min
ister, in the course of an interview,
the Government was quiet and
tranquil respecting the movements of
th" American warships, which were
fully known to the Minister of Ma
rine.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â 50 far as
could be learned the administration has
no advices from Havana to-day. Both
the State and Navy departments af
firmed that nothing had been heard
from General I,ee. and professed to
look upon the lack of news as a sjood
sign. On the other hand, the city was
full of rumors, ranging in importance
from the statement that the white
pquf.rtron had sailed from Key West
to that of Lee's being assassinated at
Havana. Inquiry, however, failed to
reveal any basis for sensational re
ports.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALGIERS, Jan. 23.â Anti-Jewish
riots were renewed here to-day. The
mob Invaded the Jewish quarter and
pillaged the shops In the Rue Baba
zoua, driving the Jewish merchants
out into the streets. A squadron of the
Chasseurs was ordered to the scene
and charged the mob with drawn
swords, but the mob reformed further
on, cheering for the army.
Revolvers and daggers were freely
used. One man who was stabbed in
the back and shot in the head, died on
the spot, and many were seriously
wounded, one, named Cayol, dying
from his wounds at 4 o'clock this after
noon. The crowd hearing of this be
came dangerously excited, shouting:
"They're murdering us. Death to
the Jews!"
The mob then resumed the pillaging.
The fronts of six shops were destroyed.
The police repeatedly charged the riot
ers, but were stubbornly resisted and
were powerless to restore order until
the troops arrived. Several policemen
were severely maltreated. Many ar
rests for theft have been made. The
Jewish authorities recommend their
co-religionists to remain in doors.
Both the men killed in the riots were
Christians, and their companions have
sworn to avenge them.
Disturbances atid the looting of Jew
ish shops continued throughout the
evening, despite the efforts of the
troops to quell disorders.

persons being injured. At the moment

rioters are reassembling on the quays
and setting fire to the Jewish spirit
stores. Troops are being hurried to
the spot. Already there have been 150
arrests to-day. The maintenance of or

tary.
ALGIERS, Jan. 24.â 8y midnight the
town had become more quiet and the

guished. The streets are patrolled by
the troops.
SLIGHT DISTURBANCES
DESPITE THE POLICE.
Noisy Anti-Dreyfus Meeting at Paris, From
Which the More Boisterous Are
Expelled.
PARIS. Jan. 2".â ln anticipation of the
prohibited anti-Dreyfus demonstration
to-day, under the direction of the organ
izing committee of the anti-Dreyfus
meeting at the Tivoll Vauxhall last Mon
day night, stringent measures were taken
by the authorities to preserve order. The
Place de la Concorde and the garden of
the Tuileries were held by a detachment
of cavalry and infantry and a large force
of police. Nothing happened until this
afternoon, the time announced for tlie
meeting to protest against the pro-Drey
fus agitation in the Salle dcs Milles sec
tion and in the Mont Parnesse quarter.
The approaches to the hall were occu
pied by the police and mounted Republi
can guards, while the precaution was
taken of removing all the chairs from the
interior. The police refused admission to
known anarchists, but many of the less
prominent evaded police vigilance, gained
admittance and created disturbances.
M. Thiebaud was elected to the chair
and the noisiest disturbers of the pro
(â â¢â¢Â»-iHngs were expelled from the hall. M.
Thiebaud proposed that a wreath be laid
on the Strasbourg statue and the pro
posal was greeted with cries of "Vive
l'Armec" and "Vive l'France."
As tho disturbance continued, M. Thie
baud got a motion adopted to close the
meeting. The wreath was then placed In
a carriage, but the police refused to al
low the crowd to follow it In a body, and
divided it into smaller groups. In the
meantime, the anarchists tried in vain
to organize a fresh meeting. Tho wreath
was placed upon the statue at 4:30 o'clock
this afternoon amid perfect order.
Later in the evening the police dis
persed large bodies of anti-Jewish dem
onstrators in the Rue de la Fayette and
at the office of the Aurore, but nothing
serious occurred and there were few ar
rests during the day.
It is agreed on all sides that Saturday's
scene in the Chamber of Deputies waa al
most without precedent, except the re
cent disturbances in the Austrian Relehs
rath. Curiously enough. Count Baderil
(former Austrian Premier) witnessed it.
He must have felt quite at home.
After the Chamber was cleared 125
torn-off neckties were picked up, togeth
er with many coats that had been torn hy
Deputies from each other's shoulders. M.
Clovls Hugues, one of the Deputies of the
Department of the Seine, had a door
slammed on his fingers, which were so
mutilated that he is now in the hands of
a surgeon.
The scene of fighting around the tribune
was unparalleled. Comte de Bernis is a
retired cavalry officer, and has the rough
manners of the bull-fightir.g town of
Nlmes. where he will be a candidate at
the next election. M. Jaures is thickset,
florid and hairy. M. Gerault Richard is
wild looking. The latter was hustled and
knocked about like a football in his at
tempt to deal Comte de Bernis a blow.
Some eighty Deputies were in the fight.
During a lull in the fight M. Gerault Rich
ard was seen in tatters, his cravat torn
off, his shirt front torn open, while his
sympathizers patted him on the back. Sud
denly Comte de Bernis bounded up the
stairs of the tribune on all fours like an
animal, dealt M. Jaures a heavy blow on
the back of the head and kicked him on
the legi. If, Jaures was knocked over
and stumbled down the stairs. Picking
himself up. he saw Comte de Bernis mak
ing off with a crowd of Deputies, while
the remainder of the house hooted him,
crying." "Coward" and "Traitor."
M. Juares threw a knotted handkerchief
after him. Comte de Bernis seemed par
alyzed and the house cheered M. Juares,
while a body of socialists made another
rush at Comte de Bernis, and the melee
was renewed as furiously as before.
M. Brisson, president of the Chamber,
finding it hopeless to restore order, de
parted and the military entered, at the
request, it is said, of a questor. who
feared loss of life Jf the scenes were enn

Islands That Could Never Be Turned
Into a Desirable State or the
Union.
Bpscla! Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 23.â The Herald
has obtained the viewÃ of many Gover
nors of States outside of New Tork on
the subject of the annexation of Ha
waii as follows:
Topeka, Kans.â l believe the Ha
waiian Islands should be annexed by
the United States for these reasons:
Within a short time, perhaps not more
than forty years., a canal will be built
across the Isthmus of Panama. This
canal should be controlled and gov
erned by the United States. The nation
having possession of these islands will
command the road to that canal, and
will also possess the key to the Pacific
Ocean from a maritime standpoint. We
do not know what the naval architec
ture of the future will be, but at pres
ent the best vessels we have are so
heavily armored they can carry only
enough coal to keep at sea for a short
time, and it is absolutely essential to
provide harbors of refuge and coaling
stations within reasonable distances.
My belief is if we allo* Hawaii to slip
out of our fingers now, within fifty
years our necessities would compel us
to fight to get possession of the islands,
and, therefore, it seems to me to be
good policy to get them while we can
in peace. In my judgment, it will be
no departure from the Monroe doc
trine, as these islands are on this con
tinent and adjacent to our shores, and
it would certainly be folly to allow any
European nation to take possession of
and fortify them, which seems likely to
be the case if we permit this opportun
ity to pass. J. W. LEEDY,
Governor of Kansas.
Cheyenne, Wyo. â My opinion is that
the annexation of Hawaii is desirable
on acount of the effect its control will
have upon the Nicaragua canal ques
tion. The islands are of such great nav
al importance that some strong govern
ment is sure to possess them very soon,
and they belong geographically to this
country. The interests the United
States now own in the islands can be
best protected and our trade extended
by annexation. W. A. RICHARDS,
Governor of Wyoming.
Montgomery, Ala. â I don't believe
much in our Government adopting a
policy of acquiring foreign territory. I
apprehend it would be an excues for
establishing a large army and for a
great increase in our navy. We have
domain sufficient for our people for
generations to come. I think the an
nexation of Hawaii might increase our
commerce and possibly aid in showing
the necessity for completing the canal
across the isthmus, work that I am
anxious to see accomplished as soon as
possible. JOSEPH. F. JOHNSON,
Governor of Alabama.
Denver, Colo. â While not enthusias
tic I believe the future commercial wel
fare of the Lnited States would justify
the annexation of the Hawaiian Isl
ands. But a hundred fc-ld more import
ant move would be the building of the
Nicaraguan canal as a guarantee of
future power and empire. We need
both, but first of all the canal.
ALVA ADAMS,
Governor of Colorado.
Salt Lake, Utah â I am in favor of the
annexation of Hawaii with a terri
torial form of government, such as
Congress may prescribe, because I re
gard it as a political and military ne
cessity that the islands should not pass
into the control of any other nation;
because the regularly constituted gov
ernment of Hawaii is seeking annexa
tion; because we have a stronger
equitable claim to the island than any
other nation, and because the opportu
nity is now ripe to annex them with
out serious trouble.
HEBER M. WELLS,
Governor of Utah.
Pierre, S. D.â Governor Lee said:
"The first duty of this country is to
Cuba, to stop the butchery in that isl
and at any cost. After that if Hawaii
is of any strategic value to this country
and its citizens desire annexation it
would probably be good policy to take
them in."
Annapolis. Md.â Governor Lowndes
said: "I should be guided in the matter
entirely by the views of the adminis
tration. I think they are best ac
quainted with all the facts and know
what is best in the circumstances."
Olympia, Wash.â Governor John H
Rogers said that he most emphatically
favors the policy of annexation of
Hawaii. He did not care at this time
to give his reasons.
Nashua, N, H.â Governor George \
Ramsdell said: "You may say I fa
vor the annexation of Hawaii "
Salem. Ore.â Governor Wiiliam P.
Lord said: "I am favorably dis
posed toward annexation for MVttrml
reasons. I feel that whether it is the
best thing it is a necesisty to which, as
a nation, we are forced and cannot well
evade.
_ Lincoln, Neb.â Governor Silas A
Holcomb said: "I am opposed to
the annexation of Hawaii For a
century it has been a Well-defined pol
.lcy of this country, handed 'down l>v its
founders, to avoid a line of notion lend
ing to entanglements and complications
with foreign nations. Hawaii is no
part of the Western Continent in a
political sense, and annexation of these
islands by.the United States would
place our Government in an incon
sistent, absurd and embarrassing atti
tude in the enforcement of the princi
ples of the Monroe doctrine, which can
not be surrendered : without menacing
the very existence of our nation An
nexation would be used as a pretext
to appeal to the spirit of militarism of
the people of our country. It would
JThe Rosy Freshness I
Ana a velvety softness of the skin is inva- I
nably obtained by those who use Pooosi'i I

entail larger expenditures for the army
and navy, increasing the burdens of
taxation, and disturbing the spirit of
peace and good will which should al
ways characterize the American peo
ple. The greater part of the inhabi
tants of the Hawaiian Islands are in-
capable of self-government and we can
give them no proper form of govern
ment without doing violence to our na
tional spirit of democracy and to the
right we maintain of self-government.
It would inject into our citizenship a
most undesirable population, which
would breed trouble and discontent. It
would be a severe blow to the rapidly
developing American beet sugar in
dustry, especially in the West, where
its development has been marked dur
ing the past few years."
Jackson, Miss.â Governor McLaugh
lin said: "I oppose the annexation of
Hawaii. It is opposed to the spirit
that breathed our Government into ex
istence in the last century.by which we
should always, as much as possible be
guided. We should never annex terri
tory that cannot be made a State, and
we should not make a State beyond tha
seas. Annexation would deprive us of
their duty on sugar, and they would
soon clamor for a sugar bounty. There
are a hundred other objections.
Austin. Tex.â Governor Culbertson
said- "My views on Hawaiian annex
ation are outlined in the platform on
which I am to make the race for the
United States Senate. I am in favor
of the recognition of belligerent rights
of lovers of freedom wherever under
organized governments they may be
struggling for home rule, and the great
cause of local self-government: but I
am opposed Jo annexation to the Uni
ted States of any territory not nat
urally and geographically a part of
this continent."
Little Rock, Ark.â Governor Dan W.
Jones said: "I am opposed to the poli
cy of the acquisition of foreign terri
tory by the United States. Nothing but
a commercial or strategic necessity
would justify the annexation of
Hawaii. I am not in a position to know
where this necessity exists."
Tallahassee, Fla. â Governor Bloxham
said: "I am opposed to the annexation Â«
of the Hawaiian Islands. My reasons
are numerous. It would be a danger
ous departure from the history of the
country and prove a veritable Pan
dora's box."
Jefferson City, Mo.â Governor Ste
phens said that he is opposed to the
annexation of the Hawaiian Islands.
He feels, however, that he cannot ex
plain his position satisfactorily in an
interview.
Baton Rouge, La. â Governor Foster
said: "I am unalterably opposed to
the annexation of Hawaii. I can see
no justification or benefit in extending
our territory in that direction."
Richmond, La.â Governor J. Hope
Tyler said: "My immature opinion is
that from a naval standpoint in th^
event of future war the annexation of
Hawaii is desirable, while in a com
mercial, social and political aspect my
mind is not so clear that it would be. The
diversified interests of our nation are
now so great as to make national legis
lation very complex and difficult. I
can see possible injury to some of our
southern interests, therefore I would be
willing to trust the settlement of the
question to the wisdom and patriotism
of our national representatives, be
lieving they would do what is for the
best interests of the whole nation."
Pt. Paul, Minn. â Governor Clouph
said to-day: "Hawaii is a case of goh
ble or see it gobbled. If we don't ta
the Sandwiches the British will. Un
cle Sam sees the pearl glistening at his
feet, and he has not the astuteness I
ascribe to him if he does not pick it
up."
Helena, Mont. â Governor Robert B.
Smith said: "I favor the annexation
of the Hawaiian Islands for theso rea
sons: Our commercial relations and
interests in these islands, demand a
stable and permanent Government
there, and without annexation these
islands are the object of prey for for
eign nations and of Internal dtecnrd
and anarchy. Attain, in time of war,
if in the possession of an enemy, they
would prove a splendid basis of supply
and operations, while if annexed such^
opportunities would not be present." y

A Fieet of Steamers and Soiling Ves

North xv ester.
The Ptrontr northwest winds that
have prevailed for the last few days
have brought In a fleet of south-bound
coasters. Quite a number of them
made port during Saturday night and
Sunday after quick passages. Among
those that got in were the ship Lucile
and bark Alexander McNeil from Seat
tle. The former made the run down in
seven days and a half and the captain
of the McNeil announced his time as
eight days. As the McNeil left Seattle
en the 12th ins=t. the bark must have
been at anchor in Clallam Bay and
Captain Jorgenson must have reckoned
his run from the time he left that
point.
"The Alexander McNeil was going
out when I was going under the bunk
ers at Seattle," said Captain Anderson
of the Lucile yesterday. "I told Cap
tain Jorgenson I would report him in
San Francisco and I did so. as I was at
anchor when his vessel came in." The
Lucile made the round trip, in less than
twenty-five days and Captain Ander
son sailed her from Seattle right into
Kan Francisco while the McNeil was
towed to sea."
The Lucile brought in 20S1 tons and
the McNeil lso3 tons of coal. Other
coal laden vessels that got in were the
ship Columbia from Tacoma with 2265
tons, steamers Washtenaw from Ta
coma with 4 1 tons for the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, the Wil
lamette from Seattle with 2: ? <X> tons,
the Bristol from Departure Bay with
2500 tons and the Burma from Xa
naimo, B. C, with 4233 tons. This will
relieve the coal famine somewhat, but
â  - â  there will not
be an ounce of the supply left.
TVhile the northwester favored the
south-bound l^eet it did not suit the
vessels that wanted t" sret out at all.
It was blowing forty-six miles an hour
at Point Reyes during the day and at
Point Lol n with twelve miles
and wound up with fifty miles an hour
at sundown. In consequence the

French bark Ville de Rouen, bound for

were to have been towed out at 11 a.
m. y but their captains de
cided that they could make better time
by remaining in port for another twen
ir hours.
A ferry service between Juneau,
Dyea and Skaguay is to be established.
The steamer Chilkat has been placed on
that run, her owners thinking they
would have that route to themselves.
They have been outgeneraled, however,
as the Pacific Steam Whaling- Company
leaned of th-Â» intended move some. time
ago and has sent instructions to the
captain of the steamer Wolcott, now at
Orca station, to go to Juneau and put
his vessel into the ferry trade between
that point and Dyea and Skaguay.
Therefore, when the Chilkat arives on
the ground she will find her rival in
possession.
This is The last trip of the ship Luclle
to this port Cor some time to come.
She has been chartered by peoi

she will have passenger accommodation
put in and then the tug Tyee will be
her side partner for at Wst four
months. The Lucile will carry about
800 passengers and the Tyee will tow
her between Seattle, Dyea and Ska

nn n p <* the Inward bound fleet did
considerable damage Saturday night.
The Kirk Columbia from Port Rlake
ley (the ship Columbia from Tacoma
also got in) sailed in and Captain Gove
hmuETht his vessel to an anchor off
M^lggs wharf. The tide was running
like a mill race and it took charge of
the bark before the anchrrr held and
carried h^r down on the schooner
Charles E. Falk. The impact set the
schooner adrift and both bark and
schooner drifted down on the pilot
boat Lady Mine. Before any serious
damage was done to the latter vessel
the tugboat Active appeared on the
Bcene and towed the Lady Mine out of
danger.
In thp meantime, while trying to get
away from thp Columbia, the Falk had
passed under her stern and ranged up
on the other side again. The tug S*>a

BRILLIANT PROSPECTS CONTINUE.
1""HE improvement in trade already noted shows
DO signs of diminishing. Several lines are
lagging, but as a general thing the demand for
goods 1- heavier, factories are better employed and
the outlook is more satisfactory than for years. The
bank clearings of the whole country showed a gain
bust week of 361.5 per cent over the same week in 1897,
and the failures again fell off, being only 309, against
4-0 in ISO 7.
From no section of the country is business re
ported really dull. In fact, the distribution of mer
chandise and manufactured products is good every
where. The tendency in prices is steadily upward,
though do marked advances have been reported of
late. The railroad earnings thus far In January arc
10 per cent larger than during the same period in
1807, and exports of American products to foreign
countries are remarkably heavy. The iron trade.
winch has for years been accepted as one of the best
barometers of business, is enjoying a pronounced
boom. The demand for finished products is un
precedented, including 1,200,000 tons of steel rails
thus far this year, and the Pittsborg works are send
ing orders away to other concerns, being unable to
fill them. This extraordinary demand of course af
fects prices, which are firm in consequence. With
the exception of cotton, which continues dull, the in
dustrial situation is extremely gratifying. The woolen
trade is stimulated by higher prices for wool abroad,
owing chiefly to reports of a short yield, and the de
mand for clothing has been brisk for some time.
Wall street has lately been the weakest spot in the
country, as speculation in securities has been un
favorably affected by the Congressional agitation
over Cuba and silver, as well as by the political dis
turbances in Asia, which have rendered English in
vestors cautious in placing their funds. This cau
tion has indirectly affected American shares, of which
the F.nglish are the best and most frequent buyers.
At the close, however, more tone was exhibited by
the market, tor all American securities are inherently
strong and would probably be active were it not for
the disturbing political causes mentioned.
The cereal situation, while irregular, is rather firm
than otherwise. Shipments of corn to Russia and
F.^ypt, the very countries from wh?ch. next to the
United States, Europe draws the bulk of its sup
plies, have imparted considerable strength to grain
in general. Indeed, the exports of corn from the
United States have been remarkably heavy of late.
Prices have not fluctuated widely, but they have har
dened somewhat, and breadstuffs may be classed as
firm with a slight upward tendency.
The Pacific Coast is enjoying its share of the pros
perity. Trade is good all over the State. Dealers
in provisions say that they never before did so much
business in January- as now. The demand is for all
distributive points, from Alaska to the equator, and
it is expected that hams, bacon and lard will advance
in the near future. Hogs have already gone up and
are firm and in rather light supply at the advance.
Beef and mutton rule firm at the good prices. Hay
has again advanced; barley, oats and corn are quoted
higher, and every few days a rise in beans is re
ported. The deficiency in grass is giving more firm
ness to the butter market. Dried fruits are looking
up and prunes are quoted at a fractional advance, with
an improved demand for Eastern account. Prices
for wool, hops and hides are maintained, though all
of these lines are quiet. Merchandise is in good
movement, and rluctuations are few and generally
in the direction of higher prices. In fact, the ten
dency in everything is upward, just as it was down
ward a year or two ago.
The outlook for crops is still uncertain. Except
in one or two section of the State there is plenty
of moisture in tbe cr> und thus far. and the grain
crop is reported all right, though free rains in the
spring will be needed. Prospects for a good fruit
yield are excellent, as the long period of cold weather
has kept the fruitbnds back, thus minimizing the
danger from frost Liter on. As to the future of the
local grain-, q WC kept on the anxious seat
by the raj â¢ -c weather, but the fact that there
has thus Ear been no sharp ri^e in prices is good evi
dence thai acy is feared at present.
In brief, wherever the eye is cast the commercial
outlook is cheering, and unless all signs fail we will
have one of the best years for the farmer and mer
chant that California has ever seen.
If the United States intends to keep up with the
times it must send a gunboat to Hayti to demand
indemnity for something. It may or may not have
a CMC, but this is not n â  consideration. The rule
seems to be to but action upon the fact of having a
punboat.
The Supervisors say they have viewed many fen
ders and found few worthy. The public does not
care if there are only a few. One good one is all
it has been asking for.
Dole is reported to be talking about failure. With
out doubt he is doing so. His usual theme is an
nexation, and if tint isn't failure there isn't such a
thing.
THE DAY OF JUBILEE.
SAN FRANCISCO awakes this morning to ex
tend on behalf of California a welcome to all
who come to take part in the rejoicing of the
Golden Jubilee of the land of gold. The splendor
and accomplishment of fifty years of activity are be
fore the eyes of the visitors. The city is radiant
with colors, the streets are adorned with banners and
arches, and the people are buoyant, joyous and jubi
bnt All things tend to make the day the greatest
festival in our history and all things promise a week
of pleasure both to the citizen and the visitor.
It is a striking coincidence that the jubilee year of
the discovery of gold in California should find the
people <'f the United States excited by another gold
discovery on the Pacific Coast. By that fact the
public mind is brcught into perfect harmony with the
celebration. It is easy for us to understand the fer
\or of the Argonauts of '40 when we feel around us
the fervor of the eager adventurers who are pre
paring for the Klondike. The glamour of gold is
upon us to-day as it was upon our predecessors of a
half century ago, and we can celebrate with sym
pathy as well as with pride the discovery of that
wonderful nugget at Sutter's Mill.
The Call has done its share toward the celebration
by the publication yesterday of a grand special edi
tion devoted to the memory of the Argonauts, the
history of gold mining in California and the condi
tion of the industry at this time throughout the Pa
cific Coast from Alaska to Mexico. That edition
serves as an introduction to the week of jubilee and
to the mining fair that is to follow. This morning
The' Call has no more to do than to utter the general
voice of San Francisco in a cordial welcome to vi>i
tcis and a wisli of joy for all.
Through streets made gorgeous and glorious with
all forms of brilliant decoration, will move the stately
procession that with civic pomp will mark the pub
lic appreciation of what Marshall's discovery of gold
meant for California and the world. It will not be
forgotten that others before Marshall knew that gold
existed here. The merit of his discovery over their
knowledge, is that he made known what they kept
hidden. The moral is the advantage of publicity
over privacy, the benefit that comes from sharing
good fortune with the world at large.
This moral will be in our minds to-ctay. We have
a golden land; let us make it known. We have re
sources richer even than our gold fields: let us make
them known. We have a city superior to any other
on earth in natural advantages, in beauty of location,
in mildness of climate and splendor of possibilities:
let us make it and its glory known. We hold up
our city and our State to-day, as of old Marshall held
up the golden nugget, and invite the- world to share
the treasures and the prosperity they will yield to all
who rightly work for them.
In this spirit we welcome our visitors, and cele
brate the day. The accomplishments of the past are
the prophecies of the future. What we have done is
the guarantee of what we yet shall do. Our joy to
day is not wholly derived from memories of the by
gone fifty years. We rejoice also in the future,
whose prospects gleam along the horizon even more
golden than those that drew to California the brave
host of pioneers of '40.
A FREE PUBLIC MARKET.
ANEW step is to be taken in the movement to
bring about the establishment of a free public
market in this city, in accordance with the law
enacted at the last session of the Legislature. The
Board of Harbor Commissioners has formally in
vited the producers of perishable products who would
be benefited by such a market to appoint a perma
nent committee to co-operate with the board in ar
ranging for its establishment, and the San Fran
cisco Farmers' Club has called a convention of pro
ducers to meet in this city February .23. for the pur
pose of electing and instructing the proposed com
mittee.
When the movement for a free public market was
first undertaken it found almost universal approval.
It was generally recognized that the market would
be of great benefit to both the producers and the
consumers of fruit, vegetables and other perishable
articles of commerce, and the desirability of provid
ing it promptly was conceded. The more the sub
ject was discussed, however, the graver appeared the
difficulties in the way of establishing one that would
be adequate to the needs of the trade, and at last the
enterprise seemed so hopeless that the agitation was
temporarily suspended until plans feasible and prac
ticable should be put forward in its support.
The call now issued by the Farmers' Club of this
city and the renewal of the agitation give promise
that some definite plan, practical in its nature, has
been devised by the promoters of the scheme and
will be submitted to the producers' convention. In
the expectation of such a plan the public will await
the meeting of the convention with no little interest,
and will be ready to give approval and support to
any wisely directed movement toward the accomplish
ment of the desired object.
That San Francisco needs a free public market is
beyond question. It is equally unquestionable that the
producers of perishable products throughout the State
should have some means of selling their produce in
the metropolis of the State under conditions that will
enable them to get something like tTie real value of
their goods to the consumers of that market.
At the present time our trade in fruit, vegetables
and poultry products is done in the most expensive
and wasteful manner possible in a civilized commun
ity. The State produces vast quantities of fine fruit,
the climate renders a fruit diet agreeable and health
ful at all seasons of the year, the general prosperity
of the people enable'; them to pay fair prices for it,
but such is the inefficiency of our commercial sys
tem that large quantities of the fruit are wasted, tons
oi it being thrown away. While the producer hardly
receives a price sufficient to pay him for his labor
the average citizen finds the price fixed for the con
sumer so hich that he can hardly afford it as a luxury
much lesÂ« as a staple article of food.
No ordinary market place will serve the require
ments of a city so large as San Francisco, and a
trade so extensive as this. In that fact lies the dif
ficulty in the way of providing the market. All dif
hculties. however, can be overcome by wisely di
rected effort, and it is to be hoped something of the
kind can be assured by the Harbor Commissioners
and the committee of producers that is to be ap
pointed to assist them.
The Rev. Foute has destroyed an illusion. He
says the armor of the Merrimac was not composed
oi railroad iron, and having fought inside of it he
doubtless knows. But nobody can fail to experi
ence a pang of regret at letting that railroad-iron
story go.
The latest gentleman to report having been held up
by a footpad had. it appears, merely run against a
poker game. The two experiences do not of neces
sity differ widely. There are poker sharps who. be
coming footpads, would justly be regarded as having
partially reformed
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1898.
THE HONOR OF BEING DISLIKED.
IT may be K^thered from a casual reading of the
Los Angeles papers that their newly acquired habit
of disliking The Call grows apace. For this a
small measure of gratitude is due, and hereby ten
dered. One of the cheering possibilities of life v
that of winning the disapproval of rogues. We de
cline to take these papers seriously and, indeed, fai!
to sec reason why they should be taken at all.
One Los Angeles daily says virtuously that the
leading papers of that cit> are in favor of exposing
and punishing corruption. Then, why the row?
They should not regard their own corruption irr
niure, but rejoice that the way to lead a better liie
i^ being puinted out to them. There is naught of
malice in the assistance they are receiving from this
city. The Call would be glad to know that its seeth
ing contemporaries of the Southland had concluded
to become decent, and would hasten to commend
them. When they shall emerge from the serfdom in
which they are held by the water company, when
they shall begin to fight the battles of the people in
stead of doing the bidding of monopoly, and no
longer have occasion to hide their rascality by a
frothy clamor of words, not judiciously selected, these
facts shall be proclaimed. They shall be proclaimed
as freely as the unpleasant facts at present existing.
As to having "lost the respect" of Los Angeles' peo
ple we must decline to believe it. There are people
in that fair city neither holding' shares in the water
concern i;or accepting its bribes. The respect of
thc-e i> WO."th having.
Another paper remarks, we fear with something
approaching rancor, that no assistance was asked of
The Call. This is an error which tuny be ascribed
to a wrong point of view. Assistance was asked,
not by the robbers, but by the robbed. Tbt foot
pad engaged in thottling a wayfarer lot rnly does
not request the aid of the police, but resents the mere
presence of the police as a detriment and an impo
sition. Yet haled into court, the footpad would
hardly have the nerve to enlarge upon the circum
stance that the police had no business to interfere.
At least he could only have acquired such nerve by
a preliminary course of training on a Los Angeles
water organ. It is true that a paper is not officially
a police agent, yet any citizen has a right to arrest a
criminal caught in the act.
One of the writhing victims of exposure laments
that The Call is simply rotten. The expression lacks
elegance. Neither does the important element of
truth lend to it a benign and redeeming presence.
However, it is quoted to show that decayed journal
ist!., nipped by the frost of fact, is sloughing vigor
ously and imagines its own taint to have got into
general circulation. '
In justice to the Los Angeles Record it must be
Bftid that it is not included among the papers that
the water company is running. Particular refer
ence has been intended to the Herald. Times and
Fxi'i-ess, a three-headed corruption suffering from
water on its several brains.
SURVEYING AT NICARAGUA.
REPORTS from Nicaragua concerning the work
of the Canal Commission do not give encour
agement to any hope of speedy action. The
Commissioners, it is said, have decided to ignore the
work of the commission of 1895 altogether and to
make a complete survey of their own. This is per
haps the best course to pursue, but it is further an-
nounced that the new commission will take a longer
time than the former one in making surveys, and that
apparently means an indefinite delay.
To make the matter worse the season has been un
favorable to any kind of survey work along the route.
It is announced that heavy rainfalls have interfered
with the progress of the workers, and on one occa
sion the Newport, with a number of laborers aboard,
was kept from landing for three days, and was finally
compelled to seek safety in a port thirty miles dis
tant from the point where the landing was to have
beet* made.
It is further reported that as a result of the survey
thus far accomplished the commission may recom
mend a change in the proposed location of the en
trance of the canal. This threatens a further
complication, as the suggested recommendations
would rai?e a dispute with the engineers who selected
the original site for the entrance, as well as with the
commission of 1895. which also had its own ideas
where the entrance should be fixed.
In the meantime it has been announced that a
group of capitalists, including the contractors who
cons#ucted the Chicago drainage canal, have sent a
surveying party of their own to go over the Nicar
agua route and estimate the possibility of construct
ing it by private enterprise. It is said that Chief En
gineer Coolie, of drainage canal fame, has expressed
the conviction that the Nicaragua canal can be com
pleted at a cost not exceeding $25,000,000.
The constructors of the Chicago drainage canal
have had more experience in canal work with im
proved mechanical appliances than any other set of
men in the world. They completed the Chicago
canal at a cost much less than the original estimate,
thereby breaking the record of large municipal enter
prises. They know what modern science, mechanism
and explosives can do in the way of blasting rock,
dredging rivers, removing earth and building em
bankments, and how superior the implements and
methods used at Chicago are to those used at the
Suez canal or at Panama.
It has been asserted all along that the Nicaragua
canal would cost from $80,000,000 to $100,000,000. and
much of the opposition to the enterprise has been due
to a dislike to have the Government guarantee the
bonds of the company Tor Â«o large a sum. If the
Chicago contractors offer to do the work for $?-.000.
000. or even for double th.it si:m. there will be a
greater willingness on the part of Congress to tinder
take it. Under the circumstances the country will
wait for the reports of the two surveying parties with
a great deal of interest, and it i* to be hoped neither
of them will be long delayed.
11. \V. Patton is not winning the regard of the
water company's papers at Los Angeles. As bitter
as this may be. there is even.- reason to believe the
experience does not come as a surprise to Mr. Patton.
When a man yells "thief and displays the evidence
that he knows what he is talking about, the thief
seldom pauses in his career to express a ser.se of ad
miration and gratitude.
There is unnecessary distress unless war come upon
the lar.d and find the Government's stock of powder
small. There is a large quantity of powder in pri
vate hands, and rather than be licked by a foreign
toe Uncle Sam wouid doubtless go to the length of
buying some of this.
Two young men in lilinois. having been walloped
by their school teacher, waylaid him and beat him
if death. Day by day the problem of education in
this country presents new difficulties.
Perhaps the declaration of Brazil that it is pleased
with Bryan for Minister grows out of an idea that he
is another Bryan.
SIGHTS AND SENSATIONS AT THE PLAY
BY ASHTON STEVENS
ABOVE and beyond the uninspired
idiocy of John J. MeNally "Court

There is hope and consolation in
Miss Dressier; it is good to know that
she i 3 in the land. In case anything
ever should happr-n to May Irwin we
have Marie Dressier to fall bark on.
Not that things are likely to happen
to May Irwln'B sensational health â not
that! â but she might some day take it
into her genial head to retire; she
might â who knows what these good
natured women will do? â marry her
self to some proud prince who could
not bear to see her work: or she might
stay away from San Francisco alto
gether. It has been a long time since
Miss Irwin westward hoed, and there
is nothing In our immediate horoscope
to point her on the way. New York,
you know, finally has "discovered"
May Irwin. She can stay there now all
the year round with any old kind of a
piece and nothing to do but work night
in and night out, with never a care of
transportation or advance agents and
grow stouter and richer while we wait.
Miss Dressier mak< s hope deferred en
durable. She is nil but May Irwin and
a magnetic considerable of her own be

ACCORDING to the cant supersti

tain Marie Dressier is not beautiful.
But she has a fascinating way of being
plain; in her physiognomy there ife
something of a homely Hading, and
she shows all the warm, womanly cor
diality that Hadingâ if she has any at
all â conceals under a mask of snow.
Also she is probably a better McN'ally
farce-comedienne than her contempo
rary of the Comedie Francaise. Have
you heard Marie Dressier sing? Her
voice is the superlative of plump joy;
it has the real essence, the snuff-col
ored tone, the just-throw-myself-away
quality that finds the true temper of
the modern coon song. Her "Ram-a-
Jam, I Want That Man" is the most
momentous Amerioo-Ethiuplc songr
burst that has happened here since
May Irwin sang "The New Bully."
â¢ â¢ *
I WONDER if Miss Dressier has the
same attraction for women that she
has fcrr men. Possibly not. She is the
most popular person, from the mascu
line estimate, that 1 have seen in four
teen months. All the men about the
town are intoning her praises. I have
heard but one woman mention the mat
terâand then It was to say she thought
Miss Dressier a trifle bumptious and
rough. Never mind about the rough
ness, but the bumptiousness I admit*
there Is no word which better than that
describes the physical attributes of this
large unique young woman. She Is
bumptious to be lovable. She revels in a
vast clumsy grace that is vivid, personal
and magnetic: she deals in a sort of
convivial hypnotism that is Immediate
and fatal. But she is as gentle as a
man. You. If you are a woman, may
not consider it gentle in Miss Dressier
to lift Mr. Lyon by the scragg: of the
neck and Joust him against the floor
and poke him in the waistcoat and
titillate him on the solar plexusâ but I.
who can feel the 'fluence of this Brun
hilda of MeNally, know that these are
mere and monetary concessions to a
depraved play writer â episodes In
which the artist's physique Is imposed
upon by an acrobatic author. You may
not think that Mr. Lyon deserves his
share of this scrimmage, either: you
would, perhaps, prefer to see Mr. Rice

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
A batle-ship of BSSO tons in course of
construction at Nicolaiff, In the Black
Be*, has received the formidable name of
Prince Potemkin Tavrlcheski.
Since IR9O Great Britain has built 199
vessels of 690.523 tons for the navy. Of
these 63 of 374,375 tons were built in the
dockyards, and 136 of 316,148 tons were
built in private yards.
Two armored cruisers of 7700 tons have
been ordered at St. Nazaire and Bordeaux
for the French navy. They will be 433
feet 4 inches in length, by 59 feet 4 Inches
in beam, and are to have triple screws
and a speed-, of twenty-one knots. Their
armament of twenty-six guns will be en
tirely of the rapid-fire type.
The Petropolawsk, turret battle-ship of
the Russian Baltic fleet, has had an un
successful trial . her engines falling short IS3
horsepower in the guarantee of 10,600. The
engines were built in England, and the
contractors have been notified to make
such changes in the machinery as will
develop the requisite power and to have
another trial of the ship.
The Proserpine, third-class cruiser, Is to
be completed by June 30. She is one of
a class of eleven in course of construction
for the British navy, and was launched
at Sheerness December 5, 1596. These
vesels are of 2135 tons displacement and
are to develop 5000 horsepower and 18.5
knots under natural draught, and 7000
horsepower and 20 knots under forced
draught. Both hull and engines were
built at dockyards, but the ship is to un
dergo trials similar to those to which con
tract-built ships and engines are sub
jected. The battery consists of eight
4-inch quick-firing guns, eight 3-pound
ers and three Maxim machine-guns.
Two drydocks at the Portsmouth dock
yard have just been completed. They are
known as Xos. 14 and 15, and the folowing
are the dimensions and data of No. 14:
Length extreme at copings "63 feet
Length on flocr 550 feet
Width extreme at top 120 feet
Width on floor , 75 feet
Depth from top to floor 43 feet 6 Inches
Width"of entrance S2 feet
Water over sill 33 feet 10 Inches
Capacity In gallons 12,621.000
Dock 15 is of like dimensions, except the
entrance, which is 94 feet wide. The work
of building these docks has been accom
plished in less than two years, and upon
its completion the Government showed its
appreciation of the services of the engi
neer in charge by promoting him.
One great defect in most of tho iar<?
French war vessels is their limited coal
supply, especially the armored ships. The
armored cruiser Amiral Pothuau. recently
commissioned, is of 5360 tons displacement
and has a normal cop.l Funply of only SSS
tons. The Eruix. of 4754 tons, carries only
406 tons; the Charlemagne, of 11,275 tons.
M tons of coal; the Massena. 11,924 tons,
only 630 tons, and so on through -.he
whole list. Everything has been sacrificed
to get protection and abnormally heavy
armament. In the first -American battle
ships the same defect existed; but in th.3
Alabama. Illinois and Wisconsin, of HJ535
tons displacement, the normal coal supply
is SOO tons on 25 feet maximum draught,
whereas the Indiana. Massachusetts and
Oregon, on a displacement of 10.288 tons
on S feet draught aft, carry only 400 tons
of coal.

ARREST OF
HIS WIFE
Mrs. Dora Albright
Charged With Be

An Attractive and Well-
Dressed Woman Is
Thrown in Jail.
Locked Up in a Cell With Sev

Vagrants.
ACCUSED BY HER HUSBAND
He Gets Her Into an Intoxicated Con
dition and Then a
Policeman.
A rather prepoeessing, well dressed
â woman was arrested last night and
charged at the city prison with being
drunk. Amid tears she begged Desk
ant Brown not to cast her in a
eel! as she had never been arrested be
fore. The woman gave her name as
Mrs. Dora Albright.
"My husband got me drunk." she
tearfully declared, 'and then had me
arrested."
In answer to the questions of the
sergeant the fair prisoner said she was
married several years ago to George
Albright, a roofer.
"We could not agree," she remarked,
"and I was forced to leave him. Yes
terday afternoon I met him or Market
street and he took me to a French res
taurant on Ciay street. He induced me
to drink a bottle of wine, and after
feeling its effects I begged him to take
me home. Instead of complying with
my wishes he took me out of the res
taurant and meeting a policeman he
told him t'"> arrest me for drunkenness.
I pleaded with the officer not to ai
me. although I admitted to him that
I was under the influence of liquor.
My husband stood by, apparently en
joying my discomfiture. He ordered
iliceman to arrest me and prom
to appear at my trial if neces
sary. As the patrol wagon drove up
were standing my hus
band assisted the officer in placing me
In :t."
Touched by her tearful appeal Judge
Campbell, who stood listening to the
Fad story instructed the d?k sergeant
to release her as soon as she recovered
from the effects of the liquor.
A friend who heard of her arrest
subsequently visited the prison and
offered to furnish any amount of money
t'i secure the release of the unfortunate
woman. He claimed he was rela.l
her and severely criticized her husband.
PREACHES OF DUTY.
Fatber BurKbard Points Out the ,
Strength of Unity in Re
ligious Offerings.
The Rev. Fther Burkhard of the So
ciety of Jesos addressed the members nf
the Sodality of the Immaculate Concep
tion, at their regular meeting yesterday
morning in the students' chapel in St.
Ignatius Church, on the subject of the
ir.p-Itution of such a sodality and the du
ties implied in its individual members.
Rrfr-rring to the feast of the day. "The
Holy Family.'' he pointed out to the boys
why this family is set up as a model to
all Christian families, briefly showing
that it was the virtue they practiced and
the pure lives which th--y lived. He said
the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin was a.
holy family, where Its members strove by
filial devotion to please her divine son
and combat the snares of the devil and
the seductions of the world. To accom
plish this two-fold blessing alone he
claimed was almost impossible; but be
ing united as they were in a sodality,
where the prayers said in common bene
fited each member, a"nd where the en
tire body was under the protection of the
â¢d Virgin, it made itpossibletowith
stand the ravages of sin from making
rapid Inroads into the eoul thereby caus
ing its damnation.
The sodality at present numbers about
200 members. From this membership
have been chosen the following boys to
act as the governing influence of the so
dality: Prefect, 6. G. Fox; first assist
ant. Percy Henessy; second assistant,
Henry Fanning; secretary. Leo Lennon;
treasurer. W. Breen; censor of first di

SAD END TO
A HONEYMOON
E. H.Seaver of Santa Cruz
Locked Up in a
Padded Cell.
He Was Married in Siskiyou
County a Month Ago to
Pretty Ida Reid.
The Fact That He Kept His Wedding a
Secret From His Mother Drove
Him Insane-
The honeymoon of E. H. Seaver and
his young wife has been brought to an
abrupt termination by the Insanity of
the groom, who la now confined In a
padded cell In the Receiving Hospital.
The story is a cad one. Beaver about
a year ago, while on a visit to Slskiyou
County, met and fell In love with Ida
Reid, the daughter of a well-to-do
rancher. He remained there for a few
months and when he returned to his
home In Santa Cruz he was the ac
cepted suitor of Ida. Last month he
again paid a visit 'to Slskiyou County
and the day before Christmas he and
Ida were married.
After the ceremony they left for Be
nicia, where they spent a few days
with a friend of Seaver's, and then
they came to this city and engaged
rooms at 17 Sixth street.
There was one little cloud on their
happiness and it seemed to worry Sea
ver. He told his wife after they came
to this city that his mother did not
know of their marriage and he was
afraid she might cause trouble. He
worried continually about what his
mother would nay until he began to
act queeriy. Saturday he insisted up
on keeping the window blinds in their
room down and when his wife asked
for an explanation he said a man was
coming to hang him because he had
I ild his mother that he was going
to get marri- J.
Yesterday morning he acted in such
a strange manner that the landlady of
the house advised Mrs. Seaver to com
municate with the police. She did so
and Seaver was taken to the City
Prison. When searched $311 50 was
found in his pockets and he said that
a friend had a number of notes be
longing- to him in his possession on
which he was drawing interest. As it
was evident that his mind was un
balanced he was sent to the Receiving
Hospital and locked up in a padded
cell.
Mrs. Heaver, who is only a girl in
years, called upon Chief Lees and the
chief sent a dispatch to h^r father ex
plaining the circumstances and ur^insr
him to come to the city to look
his daughter and son-in-law. Detective
Anthony was detailed to see that the
young wife was properly taken care
of till the arrival of her father. Th^
poor girl was heartbroken over the sad
ending to their honeymoon. Seaver
will be taken before the Insanity Com
missioners to-morrow morning.
REMEMBERED BY
THE CHINESE
Ex-Chief Crowley Presented
With a Beautiful Silk Em
broidered Banner.
The Token Accompanied With an
Address Eulogizing the Veteran for
His Able Administration.
Ex-Chief of PoHoc Cruwley was plea=
ant'.y surprised Saturday night, when four
of the leading Chinese merchants, accom
panied by the vice-consul, called at his
house on Sacratnentu Street find pr
ed him with a beautiful silk banner suit
ably Inscribed in Chinese characters and
and address, which reads as follows, and
explains It!
"The leading Chinese merchants here
have instructed me to present to you, in
their behalf, a gold and silk embroidered
banner as a token of their respect for you
and your able administration of affairs as
Chief of Police during the last twenty
four years or so. During your twenty
four years of faithful and splendid ser
vice to the public, especially the Chinese
community, there was not a sign of dis
satisfaction among them about your te
dious and difficult work. And when your
resignation was announced every con
scientious Chinaman felt with sorrow the
loss of an able, honest and faithful pro
tector and friend. The American public,
too. must have felt the loss greatly. No
matter where you may be and what you
do. you shall always control the Chinese
sympathy and that their constant wish
and prayer will always be for your sound
health and well-being. It is with the ut
most pleasure and respect that I hereby
hand you over this banner on behalf of
the Chinese community. I beg to remain,
with our highest regards and considera
tion, yours respectfully, HO TOW,
"Chinese Vice-Consul."
The reason for the delay in making the
presentation was that the banner was ex
pressly manufactured in China and only
arrived a few days ago.
"The Nc;cÂ£S:ty of Capital Punishment."
Oliver C. Miller, pastor of the Church
of the Holy Spirit. 2127 Jackson street,
made that his theme at the â¢vealat
vice. His test was from Gen. ix:6: "Who
so sheddeth man's blood, by man shall
his blood be shed: for in the image of
Qod made he man." The speaker said in
part:
"These are God's own words spoken to
Noah in his covenant after the deluge,
an<l they have | We
find them confirmed In the covenant made
with Moses nearly a thousand rears, later,
in these word*: 'He that smiteth a man
so that h' |y put to
death.' And still later in Leviticus Â»>
'He that Idlletta any man shall
surely b<: put to death.' The sum>- testi
mony is confirmed by our Savior, who be
gan his teaching as a rabbi sent from God
with the declaration that he came not to
destroy, but to fulfill the law and the
prophets. When he took the place of all
murderers and criminals to the end <>f
time, we hear him pray the Father as the
cup of death was set before him. 'O. my
Father, if it be possible, iet this cop
from m*.-; nevertheless, not a* I will, but
as thou wilt.' But it was not possible, for
Divine Justice demanded that he who
took the sinner's place must suffer the
sinner's penalty; the wages of sin being
death. To the question. 'Are murderers
or other condemned criminals saved?" we
answer. 'Yes.' if they sincerely repent and
c in the Lord. Christ saves theÂ»mur
throogh the gallows, not from it.
The demands of justice must be satisfied,
even if Chftat most be manifest in thÂ«Â»
building of the gallows* ami nerving the
hand of the hangman. All the talk of
banishing capital punishment is not th^
resuit of true humane feeling, but a mor
bid sentiment that in the end is inhuman
because it throws down the safeguards
the Creator placed about the lives of his
creatures.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 24, IS9B.
BOREAS AGAINST
THE BULLSEYE
Shooting at Shell Mound
Under Natural Dis
advantages.
However, the World's Pistol
Record Was Beaten by
J. E. Gorman.
Unusually Low Scores on Account
of the Prevailing Wind and
Cold.
The knights of the trigger and target
had very unfavorable natural condi
tions to work against yesterday, a
strong wind and a decidedly coid at
mosphere making good scores difficult
for all and impossible for most of the
marksmen. The leading clubs were
represented, but there were fewer par
ticipants in the various contests than
there would have been had the weather
been more auspicious for the trials of
the marksman's 6kill. As a natural
consequence of existing conditions the
scores were unusually low, and many a
crack shot grumbled at the showing he
made and got what small satisfaction
he could by taking it out on the
weather.
But If the scores in general were poor
there was some shooting; done which
rendered the day notable in the annals
of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club.
This was the pistol shooting of J. K.
Gorman, who made a fifty-yard ten-
Bhot score of 29 as follows: 3-3-5-4-4-4
3-1-1-1. In points this ties the world's
record score of 29 made by C. M. Daiss
of the same club last October, but Mr.
Gorman's score beats that one on the
Creedmoor count, thus making a new
worlds record in this class.
The club's pistol medal shoot for the
day presents the following score- J F
Gorman, 29-38-45; F. O. Young, "47. " In
the rifle shoot for the Bushnell trophy
the score was: F. O. Young, 46-46-46
46; J. E. Gorman, 46-43; E. Jacobson.
46-45.

PLENTY OF ROOM IN JAIL.
Fewer Inmates in the County JdJl
This Winter Than Has Been for
a Hurnber of Years.
Whatever may be the cause, there are
fewer Inmates in the San Francisco jails
this year than has been at a correspond
ing period for the last ten years.
At the Broadway jail there are now only
107; at the corresponding period last
year there were 131. At the branch No. 2
(formerly House of Correction;, there are
only 260. whereas last year at this time
there were 386, and at the branch No. 3
(women's prison; there are 66, when last
;here were 82.
The total number of prisoners now un
der the keeping of the Sheriff between
time-servers and those waiting trial in
the Broadway bastile. under the keeping
of Chief Jailer Battler, is 433, a? against
519 for the month of January. I
This condition of affairs leaves plenty
of spare room at the Broadway jail for
those burglars and nleht prowlers who !
manage to evade the detectives.
JUBILEE BILLS

ised in "The Girl
From Paris."

at the California Another
Week.
English Melodrama at Morosco's.
Cruiidy Revival at the Alcazar.
Orpheum Stara.
"The Girl From Paris," which com
mences an engagement of three weeks
at the Baldwin to-night. Is one
of the most popular attractions
of the lighter order that has been pre
sented in years. It haa a record of 1000
nights at the Duke of York's, London,
and another edition of it is now play
ing at the Herald Square Theater, New
York, where a run of 300 nights was
recently completed. We are promised,
as nearly as possible, the production
which Edward E. Rice first gave New
York. Of course all of the originals are
not in the cast â several of them made
such reputations that they are now
"out en their own"â but the present
company is said to be compact and
valuable in every particular. The pro
duction will be under the hand of
Frank Smithson. whom Mr. Rice se
cured from London, end the dancing,
which plays an important part in the
finance, will be directed by H.
Fletcher Rivers, a ballet master of rep
utation. The elaborate scenic equip
ment is the work of La Fayette W.
y. an artist who needs no intro
duction.
The piece itself is said to be almost
a r>al comic opt-ra, w.th catchy music
by Ivan Caryll and a smartly humorous
book by George Dance. The presenta
tion requires a castof fifty. .Miss Mamie
Gilrojr, whose clever work in Hoyt's
farces la well remembered, plays the
part of "the girl"; William Blaisdell is
the comical French spy; Edgar Hal
stead is the Ebenezer Honeycomb, a
"shining light"; Harry Hermsen has
the part of "it-is-to-laugh ' Hans, which
in his hands is said to be quite as
clever as the original creation of
Mann's; J. C. Marlow impersonates the
dandy Major K< MMI/h â¢ of the Batter
sea Buttert'.y Shooters: Phiiip Thomas,
recently of the Bostonians, will appear
as Tom Orerleigh, the British barris
ter; Mi=s Carrie Bahr will appear as
Ruth, the slavey, and sing the now fa
mous "Sister Mary Jane's Top Note."
Clara Lavine will have the chance to
sir.s^ in the role of Nora Honeycomb,
ar.J Mile. Fieurette, a distinguished
dancer, will exploit her newest crea
tion. "La Parisienne." Rice may be de
pended upon for a comely chums and a
good orchestra leader.
"Courted Into Court" promises to
have a crescf-ndo second week at the
California. Th>- town is just awaken
ing to the fact that Marie Dressier.

the redoubtable Sissurieta Jones her-
The fifty members of the com
pany are born all that way â not col
ored â and are eaid to reach the limit
of emancipated song, dance, specialty
and spectacle.
"The Arabian Nlgrhts," one of the
best of Sydney Grundy's adapted farces,
will be revived at the Alcazar this
wreck. The adventures of the unsophis
ticated but sporty Hummingtop with
his fair deceiver and his mother-in-law
are too well known to require ampli
fication at this time of day. "The
Arabian Nights" has always been a
safe piece in Pan Francisco since its
Introduction years ago by Joe Holland
and Georgia Drew Barrymore. It was
one of the most successful of the many
Frawley productions and did well at
the Alcazar last year.
The opening performance will take
place on Monday afternoon. & "Jubilee"
matinee being the vrder a t the Alca
zar.
Whether the i.ther theaters are offer
ing good shows or baa, yÂ«.u are always
sure of finding something that is worth
the while at the Orpheum. The house
has a standard and lives up to it fairly
well. Now and then bad turns mar a
programme, but on the whole tht-r- is
not a variety house in the land that
offers as good a bill year in and year
out.
Tht-re are several new features on th
bill for the new week, prominent among
which is Carletta, who styles himself
" ' Th - Human Lizard, and is said to be
practically boneless. Dolline Cole, an
other newcomer, claims to be "Ameri
ca's greatest female barytone." Mon
day night will mark her Initial bow to
a San Francisco audience. The comedy
portion of the bill will be contributed
by Al Wilson, the famous Dutch come
dian, and Orirr.mins and Gore in their
screamingly funny sketch, What Are
the Wild Waves Saying." The biograph
will have an entirely new set of views.
The Knaben-Kapelle has been re
tained for another week, but this will
positively be the last.
The hold-overs will include Gallando,
clay modeler; Almont and Dumont in
musical specialties, and Rice and
Elmer, horizontal bar performers. A
Jubilee matinee will be given to-day.
This week will be the last of "'Brian
Bont" at th>' Tivoli. The management
had hoped for a better success with an
opera that was such a tremendous go
in New York, and spared no pains in
the production. There are several con
certed pieces and one or two of the
â Oloa that are worth hearing. The cast
is a lon* one, including Arthur Donald
son in the part of Brian. Thomas C.

lieve his first wife dead, remarries,
only to discover that his second mar
riage is void and his son illegitimate.
However, the ending is happy, as
Crane finally relents sooner than" live
up to his revenge.
ThÂ«Â» pathos of the plot Is relieved by
considerable comedy and sensational
scenes of a great foundry in operation
and a ifvely fire. All the favorites of
Morosco's company will be seen In
characteristic parts.
A programme of modern pieces has
been selected by Mr. Pcheel for Thurs
day's concert at the Tivoli. The sym
phony will will be Dvorack's "New
World": the ballet music, Dellbes'
"Coppelia," and the overture Gold
mark's "In Springtime." Robert
Franz's version of the old Hebrew
melody, "Kol Nidre," will also be
played.
Arrangements have just been com
pleted by which Henri Marteau, the
young French violinist, will be the
soloist at one of the Symphony So
ciety's concerts of an early date.
The Olympia Music Hall, at the
corner of Mason and Eddy streets, was
formally reopened Saturday night with
a musical and vaudeville entertain
ment, chiefly contributed to by Kirch
ner's "Lady" Orchestra. Among the
other attractions were Anna Killian,
violin poloist; Ma Belle, a serio-comic:
Jessie Millar, cornet operator, and sev
eral specialists in song and dance.
Out at the Chutes Free Theater Chi
qulta, the condensed Cuban patriot. Is
ptill the biggest attraction of her
inches on record. She draws the crowd,
even in cold weather. For the week a
big vaudeville bill is announced.
The orchestra at the Oberon will have
a new and lively programme for the
week.
WITH GAS AND ACID.
Two Young Women Deadâ One
Accidentally, the Other by
Her Own Hand.
Two cases of sudden death were report
ed at the Morgue yesterday forenoon;
both were of women agM 23 years.
The first case was that of Miss Glo
vanna Stornitta, who was a domestic at
the residence of Mrs. S-.atena, at 604 Fil
bert street. She had been employed only
three days when her death occurred
through asphyxiation. The lady for
whom she worked is of the opinion that
the unfortunate girl left the gas jet
turned on. either through a mistake or
not being acquainted with the use of gas,
a.s she had but recently come from the
country. She has some relatives residing
at Xapa Junction, who have bet-n no
tified of her death. They telegraphed to
the effect that they would arrive in the
city this morning. The deceased was a
native of Switzerland.
The other woman swallowed a dose of
carbolic acid at a lodging-house at 7 Ma
son street. To her acquaintances she was
known aa Mrs. M. L. Leighton. Her
death appeared to have been deliberate
and premeditated.
Surrendered Himself.
Martin Â«avin. the hwiiwi young man
who escaped from the R''O>lvir.sr Hospital
Saturday morning. Dttdc his appearance
yesterday afternoon and politely asked
â hown to his oelL He said he had
slept in a freight cr.r all nitrht and he
thought he would prefer the c.-M. He will
be taken bark to th<* Whit well private
asylum to-morrow noming.
NEW TO-DAY.
Coughs and colds need not
be endured; they can be
cured, s^d that quickly.
Many mixtures are tem-
porary in effect, but Scott's
Emulsion of Cod-liver Oil
with Hypophosphites is a
permanent remedy.
The oil feeds the blood
and warms the body ; the
hypophosphites tone up the
nerves; the glycerine soothes
the inflamed throat and lungs.
The combination cures.
This may prevent serious
lung troubles.

SAD PLIGHT OF A CLERK.
Falls A6leep and Is Relieved of His
Valuables by a Chinese
Thief.
Frank Coursen, a clerk, had a des
perate encounter with a footpad late
Saturday night. Coursen was walking
along Pine street, and. when near
Mason, he was accosted by an evil
looking st rancor, who pretended to be
acquainted with him. Convinced that
he intended to assault him Coursen
started to walk away, when the robber
seized him by the throat and threat
ened to strangle him if he made an
outcry. Coursen, realizing he was in
the hands of a desperate man, deter
mined to make a fight. Breaking the
hold which the robber had on his
throat Coursen struck him a blow in
the face. The desperate stranger at
once drew a slung-shot and struck
Coursen across the left cheek, cutting
a deep gash. The force of the blow
knocked him down, and, while lying
prostrate, the robber proceeded to
Bearch his pockets. Determined to pre
vent him from robbing him Coursen
lustily shouted for the police.
Evidently fearing arrest, the robber
left his victim and ran down Pine
Ptreot. Coursen subsequently ap
peared at police headquarters, where
he told the story of the robbery to Cap
tain Wittman. After his statement
was taken he was escorted to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where the wound in
his cheek was dressed by Dr. Thomp
son. He described his assailant as
being about 40 years of age and rather
shabbily dressed, He wore a dark
slouch hat. which was pulled down
over his eyes.
An old man named M. Coetello. liv
ing at 3557 Twenty-first street, was at
tacked by several men at Twenty-first
and Dolores streets at 1 o'clock yester
day morning, and after being beaten
into insensibility was robbed of $1 50.
Ho received a severe scalp wound.
which was dressed at the Receiving
Hospital.
John O'Brien, who lives in Oakland,
complained to the police last evening
that he was held up by two men on
Ecker street last Friday night and
r<<bbed of $1 35 in money, a silver watch
and a bunch of keys. One of his rob
bers, he says, wore a mask.
Lee Wallace, a bookkeeper, overcome
by the effects of liquor, fell asleep on
the sidewalk at Pine and Jones streets
late Saturday night. A citizen who
was passing at the time saw a Chinese
In the act of going through his pock
ets. He immediately summoned a
policeman, but before the latter ar
rived the- Chinese made his escape.
"Wallace was arrested on a charge of
drunkenness and locked up in the City
Prison. After being released he claimed
he had been robbed of a gold watch
and chain and a small amount in
money. I>ast night he visited police
headquarters and gave Chief Lees a
description of the stolen property.

Now Annoys tbe Widow.
Mrs. Mary Parenti. living at 7 Vincent
Ftroet. notified the police at the Califor
nia street station last evening that Luigi
Palo, a bootblack, had threatened to kill
her.
A little over a year ago Ausrustine Pa
renti. the husband of the woman, was
taken to the Kecciving Hospital suffering
from poisoning. He died, and before his
death he made the statement that Palo
had forced him to take the poison. The
bootblack was tried on the charge of mur
der, but was acquitted.
Mrs. Parent! says that the man has
been bothering her now for some time and
has made threats to kill her. Thursday
night Mrs. Parent! went into the cellar
of her house and found Palo there. He
had broken the lock of the door and when
she entered knocked the candle which she
carried from her hand. He threw him
self on his knees before her and handing
her a hatchet said:
"Mary. I killed your husband; now you
kill me."
A Medlurt) Dead.
Professor Charles A. Mingo, a spirit
ualistic medium, died at his home, 834
Mission street, yesterday. He was born
In Staten Island fifty years ago.
CAPTAIN HENRY S. HEALEY DEAD.
Tie Clerk of tie Chief of Police Passes Away After a Lou anil
PaMil Illness.
Captain Henry S. Healey, clerk to the
Chief of Police, died last night after a
short illness.
Several weeks ago Healey was stricken
with pneumonia, and despite the efforts
of Drs. Shumate and Kecney he grad
ually grew worse. Shortly after 7 o'clock
last night he breathed his last, surround
ed by several of his intimate friends.
Healey was born on December IX, 1535.
In Klgin, Huntingdon County, Qu<
â¢ 'anada. He was appointed a memb* r <if
the police department on May B, lv
account of his ability and strict attention
to his duties he was promoted to the rank
of sergeant on January 1, 18S8.
Since July 1, I}<94, when he was made a
captain, he has been acting as the Chiefs
clerk.
ROSETTE TOOK
THE MONEY
The Famous Santa Clara
Puppy Shows Her Met
tle at Ingleside.
Fleet Diana Easily Won the
Purse in the Consola
tion Stake.
A Large and Interested Crowd
Looked On and Played Its
Coin.
Although It was cold and bleak at
the Ingleside coursing grounds yester
day a large crowd visited the park to
witness the card drawn up for the all
age and consolation stakes. As a rule
the long-enders carried away the
money, but two or three neglected
hounds surprised the talent In a very
decided way. Tod Sloan, who is nearly
always looked upon as a slow dog,
walked off with short money, winning
at 4^i to 0. The Eclipse ran a bye with
Duke of Oak Grove and was beaten
with the pools selling at 5 to 3.
Once again Curtis & Sons carried off
the purse with the now famous Santa
Clara puppie Rosette, and the talent
played their money that way. There
was probably never more even cours
ing than that between Sylvia and
White Chief in the second ties. Twice
the hc-unds were returned after a no go
had been declared. In the third White
Cloud showed his mettle by winning a
long, hard fought course.
There is much talk concerning the
split among the dog factions and the
poisoning of the celebrated field trial
champion Glenbeigh, who died at
Bakersfield. Glenbeigh was a brother
to many field trial and bench show
winners and was sired by Grouse V..
dam Rita. No cause can be assigned
for the poisoning, but it is thought by
some to have been spite work. The
thought of building a new coursing
park has developed some rather start
ling points. It is rumored that the
Board of Supervisors are determined
to step the selling of pools either on the
race course, at the coursing grounds or
in pool rooms in the City. If this idea
be carried out it is admitted the Ingle
side grounds will be placed at a great
disadvantage, as the new park, which
Is at present being thought of, will not
come under the orders of the Super
visors, as It will be built acrr.-ss the
county line, thus blocking the ordi
nance, if passed, completely.
But others contend that the ordinance
will never be passed and that th" Ingle
side grounds will not be injured by the
new park, as it is thought that much
larger purses will have to be given by
the new comers than are given at the
present, and it is thought it will be a
difficult matter to give larger purses
and escape bankruptcy.
The longest and prettiest, as well as
the closest course <rf the day, was wh.-n
The Bell of Moscow started in a bye
with Sweet Music. Bell opened a
strong favorite, but odds evened up
slightly toward the close. The hounds
slipped to a good hare and after a
closely contested course the judge de
clared that Sweet Music had w<m.
Considerable money changed hands on
the result.
This is how it all happened:

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1898.
Healey was one of the most popular
men In the department. Always courte
ous and kiwi, he endeared himself to
everybody with whom he came in con
tact. Captain Splllane was perhaps his
warmest friend. When young men they
served in the army, Healey occupying a
responsible position. In all probability
nt Cassias Wright will succeed the
late captain. Wright enjoys the confi
dence of Chief i-e(>s and the iiiwubeis "f
the Police Commission, and Is highly re
garded by . very man connected with the
rtment Since Healey was taken ill
Wright has beea acting in his place.
The appointment of the late captain's
successor will bo made at the meeting of
the < - ommissinners which will be held
next Wednesday night.

MINISTERS ON
THE JUBILEE
The Theme Chosen by Two
Divines of This
City.
What Revs. Locke and Ford Have
to Say Regarding the
Subject.
Rev. Frank S. Ford. at the First Chris
tian Church, was inspired by the Jubilee
for his theme. He spoke as follows:
The lawn of the Jubilee are given in Le- '
viticus 2.":5-.">. They are that it should be
celebrated every fiftieth year, beginning
on the tenth day of the seventh month; j
that at the beginning of this year all Is
raelites who had become slaves should go
free; that during this year the land
should remain fallow; that all unre
deemed land, houses in the country and
villages, and also Levitical houses in the
cities should, at the beginning of this j
year, be restored to their original owners. i
That "the earth is the Lord's and the I
fullness thereof " and that we are tenants
in the things that we think we possess;
that we are dependent on God and be
cause of this dependence are under cer- i
tain obligations to him is suggested both
in the fact and in the requirements of the
Jubilee. It bears in itself its evidence of
divinity. That any legislator would have
ventured to propose such a law, except
upon the fullest conviction on both sides
that a peculiar providence would con
stantly facilitate its execution, is incred
ible.
The Mosaic law and the evidence of
Mo>es" divine mission arc coeval. The
vtry existence of the law Is therefore a
monument that Moses spoke from Gou.
Its history through many stormy cen
turfes is an assurance to us that what he
has saiil he is able to accomplish. He
knows all about this earthâ ile created
it. He knows all about the laws of pro
duceâHe ordained them. He knows all
about us and our possibilities, and when
we stand in his word we know of the end.
As Car as legislation could go the Ju
bilee tended to restore the equality which
existed lr. the first allotment by Joshua.
But as a part of the divine law "appointed
for the chosen people, its practical bear-
Ing was to vindicate the right of each Is
r,o lite to his part in the covenant of his
fathers.
Dr. Charles Edward I>ocke. pastor of
the Centra] Methodist Church, j>reached
last evening on the subject of "A Motto
from Our Golden Jubilee." Dr. Locke, in!
announcing his text, said he begged to I
suggest it as the motto for the Golden
Jubilee. The text was "Seek ye first the
kingdom of <;<â¢â¢! ami his righteousness.
and ail these thinns shall be added unto
you." The sermon was followed by nn
impressive revival service, during which
many persons bowed at the altar. M
Ings were announced for each evening
this week c-xcept Saturday.
Where Is Mrs Davis?
Alfred Davis, 549 Howard street, report- ;
ed to the police yesterrtny that his wife !
had left home Saturday morning with
their baby and had not returned. She
was last seer, at the Central House 52
Second street, Saturday night. She re- :
mnlned there for a short time and left,
not saying where she was going. Since
then nothing had been seen or heard
of her or the baby.
LABOR UNIONS
READY FOR WAR
"Recognition in the Char
ter or Defeat" Their
Ultimatum.
Temporary Organization Ef
fected and Various Com
mittees Appointed.
P. H. McCarthy Outlines the Plan of
the Appronching Campaign â Trib
ute to a Friend.
The labor unions of this city want
some notice taken of them In the pro
posed new charter: In fact, they are de
sirous of considerable notice and If they
don't get It they intend to do their best
to defeat the purpose of others who are
eager for its adoption. They have so
announced themselves. In the language
of one of their speakers, "We have
come to stay."
Yesterday afternoon delegations from
the various unions assembled at Slaty
Market street and effected a temporary
organization, which will be made per
manent next Sunday. There were three
delegates present Irom each of the
unions. The meeting was called by the
Building Trades Council.
The delegates proceeded first to or
ganize temporarily as a charter con
vention, electing EL C Hinken chair
man and W. M. Page secretary. A
committee on credentials was selected
In the persons of J. T. McCann, W.
Goff, L. Vizr.ier, C. Hussey and J. Jor
gensen.
The matter of permanent organiza
tion was laid over until next Sunday
at which time it is expected all the la
bor organizations will be represented. A
committee on permanent organization
was appointed by Chairman Hinken as
follows: F. Cranford, T. Mulaney, W.
Goff, John Miller, \V. Brunsfield. P.
Hannon. P. Lenncn, H. j Skeen, and
G. Lafayette. This committee may be
Increased until a delegate from each
union is a member.
P. H. McCarthy. President of Carpen
ters' Union No. 22. urged vigorous ac
tion >>n the part of the convention. The
purpose of the body he stated to be that
of appointing a committee to frame
clauses for Insertion in the charter,
which shall favor the workmen of the
community.
"We have existed for about forty-six
yo :i rs under that old crazy quilt, the
Consolidation Act," he declared, "and
if we shouid have to live that length of
time under the proposed charter we
want it properly framed beforehand. A
charter is supposed to be a grant of
power and not a code of laws. That ts
the reason why the charter was de
feated last y> ar. The labor unions hold
the balance of power in this city, over
15,000 votes; they defeated that charter
and they will cause this one to be laid
on th>> shelf if they are not treated
justly."
B. L. Mallshurv of the same union
asserted that the Inhering classes suffer
under the present Consolidation Act.
but not more than capitalists. In fact,
he believed the latter class to be the
worst sufferers, and that they must
recognize the labor unions in the pres
ent instrument In order to attain their
own ends.
McCarthy further urged that Influ
ence be concentrated on the legislative
committeee of the Convention of One
Hundred. Dr. Jerome A. Anderson's
name w;is suggested as the only friend
the unions had there, but the speaker
denied this with emphasis, declaring
that one member had been so interested
in the clause favoring labor that he. had
tnkHn it to a lawyer and had it
couched in terms that would stand a
contest nt law.
BUSHNELL ALERTS
REMOVE A HOODOO
California Markets Are Unable
to Cope With a Lucky
Charm.
A Larfie Number of Errors Does Not
Prevent the Photographers
From Winning.
The hoodoo that has pursued the Bush
nell Alerts durlnp the past few months
took wln^s yt-Fterday and once again for
tune smiled on them, and the California
Mnrkt-ts were taken into camp.
Whether or not the change of luck was
caused by a charm that Manager Bob
MttchoH wore on his person, the fact re
mains that they won, even though ten
large errors were made in the attempt.
To Moskin:an is dvÂ»; some credit for the
victory, as he pitched a strong, steady
game, only allowing the Markets five
hits, strikink out five men and giving no
bases on halls. Ilierg was an easy mark
fof the Alerts, ami was batted in all di

* â ( -- _ J
The cnarges made against" the con
tractors who built the New City Hall
dome were the talk of the city yester
day, especially in political circles. It
seemed to be the general opinion that
if Grand Juror Daniel O'Sullivan was
correct in his minority report there
ought to be a number of indictments by
the present Grand Jury.
County Clerk Curry did not care to
express any opinion except that he
was well acquainted with O'Sullivan
and thought he was a good man. He
thought it was rather late to make the
charges, however, and felt that there
must be some great mistake in the
whole matter.
"If O'Sullivan is correct." said Au
ditor Broderick. "he ought to have the
old Grand Jury indicted by the new
one. I take no stock in the charges.
It was the duty of the commissioners
to examine all the work and pass on it.
I can say in a general way that the
city never lost a cent in all that con
tract. It may be true that all the speci
fications were not curried out, but
wherever there was an omission there
was a substitution of an equal amount
of work in some other department of
the contract. O'Sullivan was angry
because he did not get some plastering
contract and half of what he says is
evidently the result of malice and pet
ty spite. The charges are ridiculous
all through."
Mayor Phelan said: "While all this
took place before I came into office I
understand there was an exchange of
work. Things which the commission
ers considered unnecessary were
omitted and other more pressing things
were done. I do not know all the de
tails of the work, but it is my gen
eral understanding that the city
profited by the changes. I am not
passing on the legality of what the
commissioners did. I do not know
whether (key had the right to make
the changes and substitutions in the
work. That is a matter for the lawyers
to settle, but the case is not as raw as
the story of O'Pullivan makes it."

BRAVE MEN
OF OAKLAND
Beaten Years Ago They
Always Return to
the Fray.
One of the Peculiar Things in
Politics Across the
Bay.
Time for the Council to Put Its Foot
Down on Some Park
Humbugs.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Jan. 23.
There are some brave men in Ala
ir.eda County. They never know when
they are beaten, and they never seem
able to realize that they are not in de
mand and that the public is not tumb
ling over itself in frantic efforts to do
them homage. Of course, these indi
viduals are politicians, or they so esti
mate themselves, and it is hard to con
vince them that, as a matter of fact,
they were on the shelves when they
â¢were born so far as politics Is con
cerned, and will be till the end of their
days.
Just at this time this band of the
afflicted is very numerous. They have
figured out that there is a "prospect"
for them this year much nearer home
than the Klondike. They live by the
methods known to leeches for many
months prior to an election, and how
they keep from starving at other times
the world knoweth not. As convention
time approaches they are able to beg
or control enough credit to get a feu
hundred cards printed with their faces
on them, and they duly appear as can
didates for any old thing, of course
"subject to the Republican (or some
other) county convention. " In some
Instances they are enabled to get their
cards printed in the county press, but
as this branch of advertising is gener
ally paid for in advance, these brave
fellows depend mostly for publicity on
electric light masts and country fences.
This kind of thing goes on every
where, but in other counties they seem
eventually to learn that they are not
sr, demand. In Alameda County these
warriors never learn, and the fact that
some of the old-time itchers for office
are not now in the field is due to the
fact that death has intervened since
the last election. It would be impos
sible in one edition to print the muster
roll of these political braves in this
county, and to individualize would be
L They are not strangers, unfor
tunately, and are known from Corral
Hollow to the bay.
No one can heÂ»p admiring their pluck
as they return to the inevitable defeat
with unfailing promptness. They are
sincere too. with that sincerity that is
the child of desperation. They are â¢be
ing mentioned" now at the rate of
about four a day, though it would be
a hard task to find out who is doing
the mentioning. They are also to be
pitied. They have to live and as a rule
they would never have commenced to
chase a forlorn hope but for the fact
that they have failed in all business
they ever engaged in. Yet they are
never aware of the fact that their big
Â£^st and most continuous failure has
been in politics. They are amusing
while they are with us, but they should
not be looked upon too harshly. Sooner
or later, like a good many successful
politicians, they find a shelter in a
State hospital or the county infirmary.
Xext Monday night if the City Coun
cil can read the trend cf public opinion
It will entertain and pass a resolution
to lay the whole park matter on the
table. There is no desire for a park
and never was. The people have not
i for one and do not seem to ap
preciate the fact that the controversy
arose when a real estate man offered
to sell a large tract to the city for a
generous price. Then every other real
estate dealer who had any kind of an
old section to dispose of calleu it a
tract, gave a free picnic to the grounds
and generously offered it for sale at
any number of prices. The proceeding
has been a farce from beginning to end
and has now become so ridiculous that
its further discussion is beneath the
dignity of the city government. Any
body that thinks the people of this city
will vote bonds for half-a-minion dol
lars" worth of srhemes and jobs is piti
fully ignorant of the truth.
OaJcland is ready for the next bubble.
If New York is bad politically and
morally because of the principles of
Crokerism, for the same reason Oak
land is immaculately pure. Croker be
lieves in doing everything possible to
keep his party intact and not a street
sweeper can live in the great metropo
lis who does not bow to the crouched
tiger. In Oakland we go to the other
extreme. There is neither party pat
ronage, civil service nor any other sys

tem prevalent In politics except that '
which exists under a halo of suspicion.
As a result everybody admires the
party discipline of New York although
BODM cavil at it on general principles,
and those who know Oakland are
amused at the political clowns masking
Ml "party" men. The only explanation ;
to be offered is that those who are re- |
sponsible for the present incompetency ,
and tomfoolery in the different depart
ments realize that they are politically
dead and intend to take as much selfish
benefit as possible before retribution
is meted out to them.
The chameleon politician is already
on deck. This peculiar brand is indige
nous to Oakland, and his existence is
only made possible by the fact that
this city is so split up by factional and
personal political strife that any one
of his prevailing hues can always find
some mirror to reflect it.
No matter what the dominant ques
tion be in politics, whether religious, a
water company fight, an anti-railroad
spasm, or any other of Oakland's ail
ments, this clever fellow can always
don a suit that seems to fit the oc
casion, and the peculiar part of his ex
istence is that no one ever calls him a
hypocrite, but refers to him as a smart
fellow.
There are several of thÂ«=se to be
found Just now. but they are undecided
what to do next. Many projects are
in the wind, but it Is not safe at this
early date to make a wild jump toward
any" particular platform, neither is it
safe to deny any particular affiliation.
The chameleon politician for the next
few weeks is badly tied up, but more
interesting than usual on that account,
everybody wondering which way he
will jump.
The curious are asking these political
factotums what kind of argument it is
that causes them to change their ideas
and they will continue to ask. for the
"arguments" in such cases do not see
the light of day. but rhanere hands

HE USED HIS REVOLVER.
Officer Murcell Loses hfis Head
and Shoots at a Scboolboy.
OAKLAND, Jan. 23.â Officer Murcell
* one of the newly appointed policemen'
fired his revolver at a schoolboy this af
ternoon, whose worst misdemeanor was
train-jumping. His poor aim or his cx
i citement is the only thing that kept him
from injuring the boy.
John Arrouge. of Z>l Sixth street and a
i companion, rode down on the Narrow
gauge train to Seventh and Webster
and jumped off. Officer Murceli took
them into custody and walked to the pa-
I trol box to ring for the wagon. As he
let go of Arrouge's companion to open
i the box, the little lellow darted away on
a run. â¢
â¢â¢Stop or I'll shoot." exclaimed the of
, ficer, pulling a revolver out of his pocket
This made the lad go the faster and Mur
cell took a shot at him. at the same time
starting after him. dragging the Arrouge
! boy along. The little fellow turned a cor
ner immediately after the shot was fired,
; but as the officer turned the corner, it is
said, he shot again, but this is denied.
He took his prisoner into the City
i Prison, where Captain Wilson was clos
; eted with him for som<? time. He then
resumed his beat, and Miss Arrouge
bailed her brother out, putting up $6.
Girls Said to Have Fought.

I round fight last Thursday in a ring near

girln. it is said, quarreled over a suitor.
! and Miss Neal proved the winner. No'

ASSAULTED AT
HIS DOORWAY
Strange Attack on James
A. Joyce, an Oakland
Merchant.
Peculiar Story of the Man Who
Claims to Have Assisted
Him.
Tolls of a Mysterious St--anger, but
His Tale is Regarded as
Fictitious.
OAKLAND. Jan. 23.â James A.Joyce,
one of the best known merchants In
this city, whs found unconscious on the
sidewalk late to-night on Thirteenth
street, between Clay and Washington
streets. The unconscious merchant
was found by Mr. Gard Just outside his
place of business. Gard says as soon
as he saw Joyce he went to his assist
ance, and while trying to lift him. a
stranger came up and gave him a stiff
blow in the face, knocking him down.
The stranger then ran away, and noth
ing is known of his Identity.
Gard notified the police and Joyce
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where an examination showed that the
base of his skull was fractured. He
was bleeding from the ears and uncon
scious and his injuries are very serious,
although from present Indications the
doctors do not think they are likely to
prove fatal. Mr. Gard told his story
at the police station. He was not badly
injured, although he received some
bruises on his face. He cannot explain
how Joyce came to be on the sidewalk,
and was so surprised when struck him
self that he cannot give a clear account
of his assailant.
Boon after the accident Miss M. Mac-
Miller, residing at 716 Ninth, reported
to the police that she had seen all the
trouble, and her story differs materi
ally from that told by Gard. She says
that she was on a car and saw two
men on Thirteenth street struggling.
She saw one knock the other down
and told the conductor she thought he
was killed. She is positive that there
were only two men in the block and
that no one ran away. Officer McCar
thy was sent to her house to investi
gate, and she repeated the story to
him.
Captain Fletcher says that when Gard
went to the police station he had a cut
on the chin, his hat was smashed and
he looked as though he had passed
through a severe struggle with some
one.

Central Cbristian Church,
Resigns.
OAKLAND. Jan. 23.â Rev. Edwards
Davis, pastor of the Central Christian
Church, presented his resignation to the

announced that Rev. J. H. Garrison
editor of the Evangelist of St. Louis, Mo.,
would occupy his pulpit next Sunday.
"This is the last sermon I shall preach
as pastor of this church," said Mr. Davis
at the opening of his service to-night. I
am mindful of all the kindnesses shown
me and the support of the membersmp
in the past. I am not going to say good
by to you. for I have no intention of
leaving Oakland. I can assure my friends
that I am not going on the stage â
the stage of life, on which I have been
acting for some years."
Elder James M. Wiphart. chairman of
the church officers, presented the resigna
tion of the pastor, and at to-night's serv
ice said he felt, from the looks on the
faces of those in the congregation, that
they were at a funeral. lie felt bo him
self. "Our Brother Davis is one of the
grandest orators in the pulpits of Cali
fornia." he said, "and the prayers of this
church will go with brother Davis wher
ever he goes or whatever he does." Â«

COLD BLOOD
Arrest of a Murderer
Who Is Wanted in
This City.
F. C. Cretzer Apprehended
by the Sheriff of
Vallejo.
He Is Charged With Killing
Charles Koelling With
a Brickbat.
WILL BE BROUGHT BACK.
Taken Into Custody Upon a
Dispatch Sent From
Fresno.
F. C. Cretxer, who is wanted In this
city for murder, is under arrest at Val
lejo. He was arrested there several
days ago on a telegraphic dispatch
from Fresno, charging him with burg
lary.
Last night Chief Lees was notified
that the much-wanted murderer was
safe in jail.
On the night of May 13, 1895, Cretzer
engaged in a row with a man named
Charles Koelling. and getting the worst
of the encounter he threatened to re
turn and kill his adversary. He then
left the saloon, but returned In a
few minutes armed with a brickbat.
Walking up to his victim he hurled the
brick at him. striking him in the head.
Koelling's skull w;is fractured by the
blow and he died a few days later.
Cretzer left the scene Immediately
after the assault, and. despite the ef
forts of the police, he managed to elude
arrest.
He was traced to Fresno, but before
he could be apprehended he skipped
out.
Shortly after being thrown in Jail the
Sheriff of the county recognized him as
the man who was wanted for the mur
der of Koelling. He at first denied hlB
guilt, but finally admitted that he was
the man for whom the police of this
city had been looking for nearly
two ypars. He asked that the Fresno
authorities be first notified, as he
wanted to be tried for the crime com
mitted in that city. The Sheriff re
fused to listen to him, and. after satis
fying himself that he was the assailant
of Koelling. he at once communicated
with Chief Lees.
Last night a picture of the prisoner
was pent to police headquarters, and
he was at once recognized as the brutal
murderer of Koelling. To-day an offi
cer will leave this city to bring the
fugitive back.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate maximum temperature
for the days: those underneath It, If any. the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in Inches
and hundredth^ during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In the interior an.l low
along thÂ» coast, and the isobars extend north
and south alone the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
rever** of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

Militia. 422. These litmus will not vary
a dozen from the official figures which
will be published In the next report of the
aojutant-general.
It iias now been several months since
Captain Carrinprton. U. S. A., inspector of
the National Guard of the State nf Cali
fornia, fileil his report of the condition of
the guard nndtho several camps held,
and the officers and men of the guard
have been anxiously looking for the pub
lication of the same; but in this they
have been disappointed, for the document
presented by the Inspecting officer has
been sent to the oftire of the adjutant
general, and there it has been ever since.
The excuse for its non-publication Is the
want of an appropriation for the same.
An effort has been made to obtain B vi.-w
of the document to make extracts for
publication in this department, but it was
not possible to obtain a glance at the
papers. If the guardsmen are patient,
they will have an opportunity to read the
comments in the official report, which is
issued every two years.
There has been considerable comment
in the guard during the past week upon
the fact that the division commander, N.
T. James, who is a graduate of the
United States Naval Academy and
deeply Interested in war vessels, was not
one of the invited guests at the launch
ing of the Japanese war vessel, the
Chitose. and upon the further fact that
he and his staff will not be iv th>- prand
jubilee parade to-day. In the past the
division commander and staff wore promi
nent features in the parades in this city
Tt is stated that Major-Genera! James
and staff were invited, but that the invi
tation was declined on the eround that it
was received too late to admit of the pro
curing of horses for the commander and
staff. There are men in the guard who
declare that that is. of course, a good
excuse, but that one excuse is as good as
another, and they intimate that the de
clination was on the ground that there
is not the best of feelings at this time
between the major-general and the com
rnander-ln-chief, pnrticularly since the
Naval Militia was taken from the juris
diction of the division commander.
In the parade to-day the naval militia
will occupy a position it never before has
ocupied. Heretofore it always turned
out as ah Independent organization and
by a recent order taking it out of the
command of the division commander it
became officially separated from the land
forces and consequently should take the
position at the extreme left of the Second
Brigade, but by special orders from head
quarters at Sacramento it will. f<, r to
day, be attached to the Second Urignrle
and will parade. as infantry, taking posi
tion on the left of the First Regiment
and be followed by the cavalry.
Colonel Fairbanks of the Fifth Infantry
being the senior colonel of the Second
brigade, his regiment will take the right
of line in the procession to-day. The ma
jority of his companies not being provid
ed with full-dress uniforms will parade
In service uniform, while the First Regi
ment will shine with all the splendor of
full dress.
THE FIRST INFANTRY.
During the past two weeks Colonel
James F. Smith was too much occupied
with his duties a s chief of staff to the
Grand Marshal of the Jubilee parade to
devote much time to the regiment, conse
quently the command devolved upon
Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce.
The State shoot for decorations by the
companies of this regiment commenced
at Shell Mound Park last Saturday and
will be continued during: this week. The
field officers, staff and band, as well as
the cadet company will shoot this month.
Captain Thomas J. McCreagh of Com

CLAIMS INSURANCE
LAWS ARE VIOLATED
Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance
Company and A. J. Clunie
at Outs.
The Former, Clunie Says, Refuses to
Obey Orders and Trouble Is
Expected.
Several differences of varied degrees of
importance exist between the Fidelity Mu
tual Life Insurance Company of Phila
delphia and Andrew J. Clunie, Insurance
Commissioner of the State. In conse
quence the Fidelity Company is doing
business without a license, a condition
which the law does not sanction and by
statutory provision states that a fine of
$20 is due the State for e%-ery policy writ
ten while such a condition exists. ThÂ«
latter fact, however, seems to bother the
company but little, and according to
Commissioner Clunie it is taking its time
about preparing its statement to be pre
sented with its application for a new
license.
The existing misunderstanding or rather
difference of opinion between the com
pany and the State Commissioner came to
pass last June. Under the law the Com
missioner notified the company as it was
an assessment company it must insert
in its policy applications used by solici
torsâwhich is the original document
signed by an applicant for insurance â
clause stating that the policy was not
limited to a fixed premium, and that the
pollcyholder might be called upon to pay
any premium decided upon by the direc
tors of the company.
"George A. Rathbun, local manager of
the company demurred to the order, :
said Mr. Clunie last evening, "and stated
that in his opinion it was sufficient that
the clause directed to be inserted in the
application blanks be included in the
policy. Notwithstanding his opinion I
informed him that the law required that
the clause be inserted" in the application
blank and tnat the order must be regard
ed. A few days later I addressed a let
ter to L. G. Fouse, superintendent of the
company at Philadelphia, stating that the
order had been issued, and requested him
to see that the law was complied with,
Â«â¦ h *i Ue }u me 1 rec eived an answer
stating that the order would be regarded
In the answer a blank was folded con
taining the clause provided for by law
and a statement that the blank would
be v^ d â¢ s satisfied me that my o?der
would be complied with, and I let the
m .n= ter^ op - In the meantime the il
cense of the company expired.
Being informed that the order regarding
the premium clause had not been in*
?hÂ» te . d in the cation blanks, I visited
the local manager a few days ago I
informed him regarding the statement
for a license, and then asked why mv
order regarding the premium clause had
not been compiled with. 1 presented the
etter of L. G. Fouse. and Mr Hat h bun
ssjtissiS j-jsssaa& 'a?
law gives me as Commissioner", the
law gives me. as Commissioner the
power to revoke a license when the com
pany holding it does not comply with the
statutes enacted for its government but
as this company has no license at present
I have not as yet decided as to what
course I will pursue. An application for
a renewal of its license was made by tne
company some time ago. but as the rules
regarding the required statement had no?
been made, the license was refused
"Another difference existing between my
self and the company is regarding what
is known as the retaliate^- law The
statute or law provides that when an
other State imposes an increased tax or
license on companies existing undÂ«r the
laws of this State all companies existing
under the laws of other States and do ng
business in California shall be taxed n
excess of the regular license figure to the
same extent that California companies
are taxed in the States where tne foreign
companies have their headquarters Ac
cording to the laws of Pennsylvania all
foreign companiesâ meaning " companies
having: headquarters In other Statesâ are
taxed IJt in excess of the regular license.
This being the fact, the law of this State
Imposes a tax of $25 a year on the Fidel
ity Company. This law has been over
looked by my predecessors, and, in conse
quence, the company has not been com
pelled to pay this tax for something like
seven years. In consequence, I propose
to tax the company for the lull amount
due. and see that In future the law is
complied with. The insurance laws have
been disregarded in this State for some
time, and an effort will be made to see
that the will of the Legislature predomi
nates over the pecuniary interests of
foreign insurance companies."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1898.
IDLE HANDS
SEEK RELIEF
To the Public Unemploy
ed Labor States Its
Case.
Officers and Organization to
Insure Better Future
Results.
A Statement Which Shows the
Local Situation in Its
Detail.
There has been a great deal of ac
tivity in the ranks of tne unemployed
during the past week. There was an
organization of the unemployed women
yesterday. Their permanent head
quarters now will be at 102S Market,
where Miss May Murphy will reside as
secretary.
There was an organization of the un
employed generally at the same ad
dress a week ago. The following ap
peal and explanation has been promul
gated for the benefit of the order:
To Organized Labor and the Business
Community of San Francisco, January
22. IS9S.
Gentlemen: We, the undersigned, repre
senting the unemployed men and women
of San Francisco, appeared before the
Board of Freeholders last Friday even
ing and presented to them the follow
ing document to be Incorporated in the
proposed charter of and for the city and
county of San Francisco as ' a section
of the law.
Section â . There shall be inserted in the
regular annual tax levy for said city and
county each year. the item of three hundred
thousand dollars, which amount shall be laid,
levied and collected by said annual tax levy,
as and for a specific wmerKency fund, for the
purpose of employing the unemployed upon
public works of said city and county In such
manner and under such rules and reflations
as shall be prescribed by the Board of Super
visors of said city and county; provided, al
ways, that no person shall be so employed who
has not been at least six months continuously
next immediately preceding his employment a
bona fide resident and inhabitant of said city
and county: and, provided further, that two
dollars per day shall he the minimum wage
paid for labor to any person working upon mu
nicipal works for eight hours labor per day.
To organized labor this is a matter of
the most vital importance, inasmuch as
at least many thousands In the ranks of
organized as well as unorganised labor
are Idle in this city, not to say that many
millions throughout the United States are
to-day without employment, from various
causes, such as displacement by machin
ery and kindred things, and are now
forced to beg from door to door and ask
alms from the more fortunate.
To illustrate:
The Mergenthaler typesetting machine
has displaced 20.000 printers, the various
inventions in the shoemaking trade have
displaced fully 100.000. and the various
devices in the laundry, cigar, canmaking,
agricultural and the hundreds of other in
dustries, as reported by the United States
Labor Commissioner. Carrol D. Wright,
have displaced at least 5.000,000 mechanics,
thereby making dependent upon public
charities of at least 25.000,000 human be
ings, at an average of five to a family. In
the city and county of San Francisco
we have at all times from 10.000 to 30.000
on the unemployed list, a third of whom
are members in good standing of your
own labor unions. Now is your oppor
tunity. Twenty years may elapse before
such an advantage may present itselt.
Let each individual trade unionist in this
city take this home to himself in a heart
felt interest for his own family and rela
tives. It is our earnest desire that you
instruct your delegates to the various
central bodies of this city to stop for one
moment and seriously consider the nature
of a proposition that is paramount in
the interest of men that exist in enforced
idleness from no cause that can Justly
be attributed to their own neglect and
we humbly petition the leaders of the
various trade unions of this city to devote
a few moments in their sessions to the
consideration of this, the most vital ques
tion of the age. The insecurities of sit
uations may leave you Idle at any mo
ment--\?u must realize what a power
your 75,000 membership is in this com
munity an ?,, what an influence vou'r com
mittees will have with the considerate
element of our citizenship, and It Is due
to us that we shall do so much as we can
to relieve the mass of suffering humanity
The condition of the times imprests
upon us the truth of that philosophy so
long since cx Pressed to man. viz â ' "The
evils that afflict humanity will never be
eradicated until man's reason has ma
tured the theory of man's relation to man
and taught its significance." ll n lo man
Nine hundred and fifty men can be em
ployed by this amount six months In the
year, thereby furnishing sustenance for
not less tUan 5000 persons, and at the
same time distributing $300,000 among our
business men per year. The retail grocer
and the dry goods man and the various
other local tradesmen of this city can
easily realize the great benefit to be de"
rived from the distributing of $300 000 In
the community, not one cent of which will
go beyond the limits of the city and coun !
ty. In concluding our appeal we can
cv^ d by th BB e vu S rr e ns b r UtlfUl Sen Â«â fs
See yonder poor o'er labored wight
So abject, mean and vile.
Who begs a brother of the earth
To give him leave to toil.
And see his lordly fellow worm
The poor petition spurn.
Unmindful tho' a weeping wife
And helpless offspring mourn.
If I'm your lordllng's slave,
By nature's laws designed.
Why was an independent wish
Implanted in my mind?
If not. why am I subject to
His cruelty and scorn?
And why has man the will and power
To make his fellow mourn.

ARE YOU TO LIVE IN ALASKA?
Sonjc Requirements Tbat Will Be
pound Indispensable.
The universal article of diet In that
country, depended upon and indispensa
ble. Is bread or biscuit. And to make
the bread and biscuit, either in the
camp or upon the trail, yeast cannot be
usedâ it must be baking powder; and
the powder manufactured by. the pro
cesses of the Royal Baking Powder
Company, miners and prospectors have
learned, is the only one which will
'Btand in that peculiar climate of cold
and dampness and raise the bread and
biscuit satisfactorily.
These facts are very important for
every one proposing to go to Alaska
and the Yukon country to know, for
should he be persuaded by some out
fitter to take one of the cheap brands
of baking powder, it will cost Just as
much to transport it, and then when
he opens it for use, after all his labor
In packing it over the long and diffi
cult route, he will find a solid caked
mass or a lot of spoiled powder, with
no strength and useless. Such a mis
take might lead to the most serious re
sults. Alaska is no place in which to
experiment in food, or try to econo
mize with your stomach. For use in
such a climate, and under the trying
and fatiguing conditions of life and la
bor in that country, everything must
be the best and most useful, and above
all it is imperative thai all food sup
plies shail have perfect keeping quali
ties. It is absurd to convey over such
difficult and expensive routes an ar
ticle that will deteriorate in transit, or
that will be found when required for
use to have lost a great part of its
value.
There is no better guide to follow in
these matters tha.n the advice of those
who have gone through similar ex
perience. Mr. McQuesten, who is called
"the father of Alaska," after an ex
perience of years upon the trail, in the
camp, and in the use of every kind of
supply, says: "We find in Alaska that
the importance of a proper Kind of
baking powder cannot be overestimat
ed. A miner with a can of bad baking
powder is almost helpless in Alaska,
we have tried all sorts, and have been
obliged to settle down to use nothing
but the Royai. It is stronger and car
ries further at first, but above all
things it is the only powder that will
endure the severe climatic changes of
the arctic region."
It is for the same reasons that the
United States Qovernment, in its relief
expeditions, and Peary, the famous arc
tic traveler, have carried the Koyal
Baking Powder exclusively.
The Royal Baking Powder will not
cake nor lose its strength either on
board ship or in damp climates, and is
the most highly concentrated and effi
cient of leavening agents. Hence it Is
Indispensable to every Alaskan outfit.
It can be had of any of the trading
companies in Alaska, but should the
miner procure his supplies before leav
ing, he should resist every attempt of
the outfitter to palm off upon him any
of the other brands of baking powder,
for they will spoil and prove the cause
of great disappointment and trouble.
land. By the time that the last echo of ',
the palute dies away the fifteen divis
ions of the parade will be forming at
the foot of Market street for the great
parade. At 10:30 the great procession
will begin to move. The route will be j
up Market to Montgomery, then to
Montgomery avenue, to Kearny, to i
Market, to Van Ness avenue, to Jack- !
aon street, where the parade will turn
and countermarch past the reviewing j
stand at Golden Gate avenue and Van
Ness. There the procession will be dis
missed.
Yesterday the mining division of the
parade was assigned to a place more i
fitting to it in the procession. It was
arranged to put that division nearer |
the front. The Grand Marshal and his
aids had not been notified of an effort

miners would make much of an effort
to fill the ranks of the procession and
they were not given a place as promi

miners drew the attention of the Grand

promptly remedied. The miners will
now join in the parade immediately

City Hall, which is the highest dome in
the United States connected with any
public building, open during Jubilee
week. A limited number of persons
will be admitted to the upper staircase,
and from there they can ascend by
two spiral stairways to the top. This
WiH afford them a magnificent view of

At a meeting of the executive com
mittee held last night a motion was
unanimously carried to make S. C.
Irving a special guest of the executive
committee and to accord him the
privileges of a member of the com
mittee. This was due to the fact that
Mr. Irving was the originator of the
idea of the Golden Jubilee. One day
last October, when ask^d some ques
tions in geography by hi? son, he sud
denly discovered that the semi-cen
tennial of the discovery of gold would
soon arrive. The same night at a meet-
Ing of the lOners* Association he made
known his discovery. A committee of
threeâ W. C. Ralston Jr.. A. W. Scott
and S. C. Irvingâ was appointed to
confer with the Society of California
Pioneers in regard to a jubilee celebra
tion. The result of that conference will
be seen during the coming week.
At the Jubilee ball to be held at Na
tive Sons' Hall to-night a novel and
unique species of decoration will be
seen. From the center of the ballroom
will be suspended an arrangement pre
pared by P. Ifartoich, whnsÂ» sons are
Native Sons of the Golden West. This
piece of work consists of two cones,
one enveloped in th- other, compos. .1
of strings of silk twine knotted in the
form of a fish net. The strings are of
different colors, and are so knotted as
to form throughout the work the flags
of all the nations of the world. The
outside cone is snmo twenty feet In
depth and thirty-five feet in width and
from it are suspended fringes and
trimmings of bright colors. Three
years of work have been required by
the maker in <-ompletlng his design,
and on Monday night it will be ex
hibited for th- first timf.
During the evening of the reception
to be given by the Native Daughters
of the Golden West at Native Sons*
Hall on Tuesday, the following pro
gramme will be given in addition to
the dances: Address of welcome.
