Evidence is. at .hand .to- show that
there are but two members of the Leg
islature who favor the Senatorial can
didacy of D. M. Burns and are not

convened. â â '"
Two days ago The Call sent a tele
gram to each of the Republican mem
bers of the Legislature, asking them if
they favored the candidacy of D. M.
Burns for the United States Senate, it
being expressly stated that the query
was put with no desire to learn the feel
ing nf legislators toward any other Sen
atorial candidate.
Forty-one replies were received, and
of those but two expressed a desire on
thp part of the sender to aid in seur-
Inc the election of Colonel Burns. Both
. f these were from members of the San
Francisco delegation. Of the remain-
Ing thirty-nine, eighteen were opposed
to Burns' candidacy and twenty-one
were non-committal.
A few of the telegrams sent out re
main undelivered, as the legislators to
â whom they were addressed/were away
fmm home and could not' be found.
Many who received the telegraphic
query either neglected to answer as re
quested or ignored it entirely.
Enough replies were received, however,
to give a fair idea of the condition of
mind of the average legislator as re
gards the candidacy of .Colonel Burns.
His lieutenants claim that a majority
of the members of the Legislature are
pledged to vote for him. If this is so,
then all but two are either ashamed or
afrMd to acknowledge that they even
look upon his candidacy with favor.
Thp replies received are published
here in full that there may be no mis
understanding as to their purport. A
perusal of them will perve as a useful
object lesson to those who have the in
terest and welfare of the State at
heart.

SWALLOWED A TOOTHPICK-
Serious Accident to Captain Curtin,
the Detective.
Captain Curtin, the well-known detec
tive, is lying ill at his home on Turk
street from the effects of an operation,
recently performed to remove a piece of
toothpick which had lodged in his sys
tem. About a week ago Captain Curtin
enjoyed some fish balls at luncheon, and
when later he was taken sick it was
found that some foreign substance was
creating the trouble.
An operation was performed and it was
found that a piece of toothpick was re
sponsible for the trouble. It was re
moved, and since that time the patient
has been recuperating, but slowly, on
account of complications following the
operation.

who denied the writ of mandate sought
by the petitioner to compel the Board of
Election Commissioners to count the
votes for the office of Judge of the Supe

Garret McEnerney, on behalf of the
board, argued that Pistolesi had not been
valldly elected because no proclamation
calling for the election of Superior Judge
for the unexpired term had been made by
the Governor and because the name of
the office was not printed on the ballot.
Attorney Robinson argued on behalf of
Pistolesi, but at the conclusion Judge
Hebbard denied the writ and the case was

Pistolesi was not through yet, however.

WRIGHT HAS MADE
NO APPOINTMENTS
HE DENIES ANY ONE IS SLATED
FOR ANYTHING.
Anderson Not Promised a Chairman
ship, nor Has He Been Seek
ing Any.
Howard E. Wright, who will ho Sponkor
of the next Assembly, is InceÃMd over
an insinuation contained in an expose of
a supposed scheme to be run through the
next Legislature. It is declared that As
semblyman A. Anderson of Bolano is
"slated" as chairman of the Committee
on Elections, and it leads to the inference
that Wright has his committees already
fixed.
"My committees are not decided upon,"
said Mr. W r right, in speaking of the para
graph, "nor will they be until I get to
Sacramento and am elected as Speaker.
I have made no promise to Mr. Anderson,
and I will make no promise to him, for
the elections or for any other committee.
He has sought no favors at my hands,
and I have offered him none, and it is
untrue that he or any one else is slated
for that chairmanship, or, in fact, for any
other. I have considered my committees,
but I will make no promises or appoint
ments until the Legislature opens. Mr.
Anderson needs no defense at my hands.
He has already served a term in the Leg
islature and his record is above reproach.
In making up my committees his qualifi
cations will certainly be considered."
Assemblyman Anderson, who was in
the city last evening, confirmed all Mr.
Wright had said about the statement that
he was "slated" for the Committee on
Elections.
"I have had no conversation with Mr.
Wright regarding his committees." he
said. "I have asked no favors of him
and he has extended none to me."
MRS. BOTKIN WEPT
WHILE THEY ARGUED
Deeply Moved When Both the Prosecu*
tion and the Defense Pictured
Her Life With Dunning.
George A. Knight Makes a Virulent, Aggressive and
Personal Plea for the Accused â Pillories Chief
Lees and the Police Department â An
Orator From Delaware.
np HE arguments have commenced in
I the trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,
i- charged with murder. Attorney Gen
eral R. C. White of Delaware occu
pied all the forenoon yesterday In the
opening argument for the State and At
torney George A. Knight performed a
like service for the accused woman in
the afternoon.
The representative of the people traced
in a painstaking manner the links in the
chain of evidence prepared by the prose
cution. One by one the links by which it
is expected to connect Mrs. Botkln with
the murder of two estimable women in
Dover, Del., were fashioned into the
chain which the prosecution has submit-
ted as its case. All the strong circum
stantial evidence that has been brought
out from a host of witnesses was care
fully gone over and the salient features
presented to the jury for its considera
tion.
The close of the Attorney General's ar
gument found the accused woman in
tears and apparently unoonsolable. No
one disturbed her for a time until her
sister finally went to her and spoke com
forting words. Throughout the afternoon,
while her representative was pleading in
her behalf, she sat apart from her rela
tives and riveted her eye's upon the
broad shoulders of her defender. Many
times during his address she apparently
had difficulty in restraining her feelings.
Tears came to her eyes only to he brush
ed aside as though she had determined
not to give way to her feelings. Neither
of the speakers minced their words when
speaking of the illicit relations main
tained by Dunning and herself for a
considerable period.
The methods of the opposing counsel
were entirely different. Attorney General
White made no pretensions to oratorical
ability and did not present a heroic
figure. Attired in a simple suit of brown,
he attacked the work before him after
the manner of a provincial lawyer. His
voice, when pitched in a high key, would
frequently break, and at other times
would sink lower and lower untU the
conclusion of a sentence would be lost
entirely to his attentive auditors. He
alluded frequently during his address to
"the mass of intelligence I see in the
jury box before me." Attorney Knight
did the same thing, but in a different
manner. Mr. White asked the jury to
decide the case according to the evidence
and not to be swayed in their judgment
by the eloquence of the opposing counsel.
He said the law, both human and divine,
was that "whoso sheddeth man's blood,
his blood shall be shed."
George Knight made a much more im
pressive appearance before the jury. Cast
in heroic mold, he accented this by dress
ing in keeping with the occasion. He
was fashionably clad in a Prince Albert
coat of the latest design. He made an
Impassioned address, quoting the Bible
freely toward the close of his remarks.
He was eloquent and forcible, and the
I comment in the courtroom when he
closed was that he had so punctured the
j case of the prosecution and had created
so much doubt that either an acquittal
or a disagreement of the jury would re
sult. There was also much comment on his
bitter arraignment of Chief Lees and of
the Police Department generally. He cited
the Rosser case and other Instances
where through the negligence of police
officials Justice had been cheated, but said
he would not permit a vicarious sacrifice
of this defenseless woman to atone for
the dereliction of the police in the past.
He charged Chief Lees with suppressing
and destroying evidence favorable to the
defendant, and said "his infamous old
gray head has been seen day after day |
in the City of Paris, where he has been |
looking for evidence with which to bolster '
up his case." He dwelt on Chemist Wolf '
of Delaware finding only lump arsenic I
in the candy submitted to him, while j
Chemist Price of this rfty found only i
powdered arsenic. Lees then took ten
lumps, he said, that had been in his pos
session, and upon these being analyzed |
both kinds of arsenic were found. The j
thought of this seemed to overcome him, !
and all the comment he could make was, j
"What do you think of that?" He spoke ]
of the ironing of the wrapper by Chief j
Lees as an "infamous thing." That no \
Chief of Police ever had undertaken to j
make a change in the original piece of
evidence. He alluded to him as "this old j
sunbonneted, decayed, senile fossil, who
could take a fiatiron and blot out from a
portion of the evidence something that
might prove the innocence of my client,
but he would not dare take a knife and
detach anything."
The speaker explained his anger at po- I
lice methods by saying that he. stood by \
a defenseless client and saw the men of >
the department doing things not in keep
ing with justice.
He returned to the charge on the aged j
head of the Police Department later This
time his anger was aroused at the idea
of the bit of seal being found in Mrs. Bot
kin'B room some time after her depar
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ture for Stockton. He said this trie*
was as old as time, but that modern de
tectives would not practice such a subter
fuge. They would scoff at a detective in
Chicago or New York who would be guilty
of such a clumsy trick. He then inuulged
in a bit of prophecy regarding Chief Lees,
saying: "The monument of this old gray
haired man as the head of the Po
lice Department is about to be completed.
Another will soon take his place and this
decrepit man will retire. That will be the
end of a man who has never borne a
good reputation in the profession with
which he has been connected. This is tne
last time the spectacle will ever be pre
sented in a court of justice in this city
of that man ironing out testimony and
thus changing its appearance."
Mr. Knight said he was making no ap-
peal to the jury for merry; it was only
justice he had asked for. and said he
had raised his voice against the infa
mous practices of an infamous police de
partment. The speaker descended to vi
tuperative abuse in his handling of the â¢
witnesses for the prosecution who had tes
tified to matters vital to the case of
his client. Mrs. Harris, who throughout
the trial has been his pet aversion, he
called "a catâ a degenerate female with
a peculiar mentality like that of the
Sweet Pea girl, whose only desire was to
gain notoriety at any cost."
He paid his respects to Expert Ames
thus: "If ever a brutal wretch lived on
this earth it is that old pen-harlot Dan
Ames. There is ;i man who would have
no compunction in swearing away a hu
man life. So infamous have these pen ex
perts become that the lawyers of the East
are taking steps to protect themselves
from these men they cull hired liars for
pay."
Mr. Knight dwelt long on the alibi
proved for Mrs. Botkin. in which it was
shown that she was in Eureka when one
of the anonymous letters was postmarked
in this city. He then questioned the box
of candy ever having gone across the
continent, and suggested that possibly Dr.
Bishop had inserted the poison after his
patients had died in order to take the
attention of the public away from â 
himself. He was disgraced in his
own city for allowing two pa
tients to die under his hand without
knowing what had caused their deaths.
The doctors had permitted Mrs. Dunning
to die and did not know what was tiie2
matter with her until Dr. Wolf had ana- :
lyzed the contents of the box of candy
and found therein arsenic.
He then hinted at the possible enemies
old Mr. -Pennington might have developed
in a lifetime as an attorney and as a Con
gressman. If he had made no enemies
then his life had been in vain. He direct
ed suspicion toward the Postmaster and
finally upon all the women who at one
time or another had been the companions
of Dunning in his revels. He railed at
The "fettered fingers" of the press and
asked that the .fetters be removed and
that all said in the courtroom bo spread
broadcast to the world.
Throughout his address Mr. Knight
claimed- that no motive had been shown.
That Mrs. Botkin had Dunning to her
heart's content without the death of his
Wife, and there was no reason to stoop to
murder. He attacked Dunning bitterly.
Baying in mock heroics: "They attacked
Mrs. Botkln's character because of her
life with- Dunning. This was only, per
mitted in such a case to show motive.
what say you of the other nine women
who have shared his bed and charms and
whose names have not been mentioned?
we don't know whom he has defended,
this line man, who would go to jail rather
than toll the names of these women That
â¢It- talking about gentlemanly conduct
and â¢Rearing. Because this woman share i
his i.e.! she murdered his wife, could not
that be said of the others?"
The courtroom was thronged during the
afternoon. t. Judge William P. -,-Lawlor oc
cupied a seat upon the bench as the guest :
of Judge Cook, while Garret McEnerney,
I>. M. Delmas- and other celebrities lent'
their presence to the brilliancy of the as
semblage.
Whatever the result of the present trial
of Mrs. Botkin may be, an acquittal or a
disagreement, she will not be brought be
fore the bar of justice again. In the
event of a verdict of guilty, which the de
fense declares is not possible, the case will
ero to the Supreme Court and the juris
diction of California courts will be denied.
In such a contingency Mrs. Botkin will
necessarily remain in jail until a decision
is rendered. '
Should the jury disagree the defendant
will not" again be placed on trial, because
the Delaware witnesses emphatically de
clare they will not remain here nor "will
they return to testify at a second trial.
iJrs. Downs, Bishop and Wolf are exceed
ingly Anxious to return home, and they
will probably leave for the East to-night
or to-morrow. They have received from
Chief Lees the money they are entitled
to Lor transportation, hotel expenses and
witness fees and have made all prepara
tions, to depart. These "professional gen
tlemen, are not particularly impressed
with the methods of our courts, and they
assert their belief that if a conviction of
the defendant is not secured now it never
will be and they would be only wasting
time and. making useless personal sacri
lice by returning or remaining here.
"Dunning, the principal witness for the
prosecution, .also desires to get away as
quickly as possible and as Boon as he can
do so he will depart. From here he is
gping direct to Havana, where he will
net as correspondent for the. Associated
Press. '
John B. Pennington and the other Dela
ware witnesses believe it would be futile
to attempt to try the" case again if this
trial results favorably to the defendant.
Before the case opened, the prosecution
announced that Mrs. Botkin would be
tried for the murder of Mrs. â¢ Deane if
she was acquitted of the charge of kill
ing Mrs. Dunning, but the evidence in
both, cases is the same* and if the de
fendant cannot be convicted of- one mur
der it is not within the bounds of possi
bility she would be found guilty of the
second. . '
In opening his argument Attorney Gen
eral whit( counseled the jury not to let
their sympathies influence them in reach
Ing a decision as to the punishment to. be I
meted out to the defendant. â¢" She was not
to be considered in" the matter, and they !
were not to think they were doing wrong ;
In taking a human life. If she were guilty ,
they were bound under their oaths to
administer the laws. He then told of the
chain â¢ â :" evidence that reached from the
Golden Gate to Delaware, the Diamond
State, and encircled, the.' "woman then on
trial. He traced the 'box' of candy from
the moment of its. receipt' at the post
office until It was delivered at the Pen
nington' homo, and partaken t)f/b.v the la
dies ipf the household and.- their' guests..
He then told of the death of the two
women with .all the f-yinptoms of arsgn-
Ical poisoning- attending their '. demise.
Ho then turned to the various .articles
that form exhibits in 'the case and pointed
out the .parts, they played in the great
tragedy. 'â¢. -â¢â :â¢>â ' ..â :.*:"â '... ..u: c â¢-.. '. .
He said . three methods of identification
had been, given all mankind -by; God in his
wisdom. Thes* 1 were .the features of " the
face, the . k : .hand writing and the human
voice. The Identity', of r the- guilty one in
this case was to 6e shown by. the hand
writing, and with the specimens before
them the jury could have no difficulty in
fixing the responsibility, he said. He told I
them not to examine the writing as ex>-
Verts, but as business men, and he held
they couiu not tell the various exemplars
one from another, a* the writing was all
the same. . â  Â«Â§Â£*Â£â  '
It was here the Attorney General made j
the on.- weak point of his argument. He
Bald Mrs. Punning undoubtedly, recog- I
i leed the writing on the wrapper that en
circled the box of candy as being that I

Interest In her aa to write anonymously
to her regarding the conduct of her hus
band. It has been testified to repeatedly
that Mrs-. Dunning did not .look upon this |
writer as her friend and had given or
ders that nothing in that handwriting be
>Miv< red to her. The sneaker went on
to connect Mrs. Botkin with the purchase
of the randy as another link in the great
rhain of circumstantial evidence. He then j
reminded th>' jury of the statements made
to Miss Livernash and to Mrs. Ruoff by
the accused woman when the deaths of
women were first made known to
her and the effect it had on her. He laid
particular stress on the fact that Mrs. j
Botkin discussed repeatedly the fact of !
there being three anonymous letters, j
W-hen no one except the sender of th<\m i
MTr. Pennlngton knew there had been i
three received.
He asked how the defendant knew- there
were three letters and how she could de
tail ti> Mrs. Ruon* their contents.
At this point the speaker Introduced
Druggist Green's testimony, but Mr.
Knight objected to anything being quoted
from it regarding the purchase dv Mrs.
3<.itkin of lump arsenic. Dr. Terrill was
then held up as one witness for the de
fense who had his dates mixed.! it being
claimed he visited Mrs. Hot kin either
Monday or Tuesday, and not Sunday.
Ho spuki at the alliance between Mrs.'
Potkin and Dunning as being born only
of the devil. "Take him when he lays
bare his life." he said. "It makes man

the defendant and the child of the dead
woman and her surviving relatives.
Mr. Kinght told of the responsibilities
of a juror and of a man defending a per
son charged with the crime of murder.
He said that the very charging of a
woman with murder by the use of poison
prejudiced people against her and half
convicted her. He dwelt on the heinous
ness of the present crime and then passed
to the Florence Maybrtck and the Drey
fus cases as samples of innocent persons
convicted of crimes in which they took
no part. France, he said, was tottering
in the balance because of the outrage
done to Dreyfus. He ppoke of "the fumes
of the Rosser trial stinking through the
door," but did not Want the dereliction
of the Police Department In that case to
be made up for at the expense of his
client.
"The police," he said, "may say things
have occurred near here, but they cannot
on their own wrong build a monument on
this woman." He went fully into the mat
ter of a motive in this case. "It was not
for Dunning, the dissolute brute," he said,
"She had him. He was an incumbrance
upon her. She nourished him, fed him.
Ho came to her in the dead of night and
she warmed, fed, clothed and pittied
him. Did she want him? She had him.
Like' Elizabeth of, old, she pledged
the jewels in her crown for him."
There was a left-handed compliment for
Mr. White. "The Attorney General of
Delaware touched but lightly on any
phase of the ea-se." H* also warned the
jury not to construe the evidence toward
guilt, but toward innocence. Proof abso
lute was what was required, and he
claimed not a scintilla of proof had t>eÂ«n
offered to connect this woman with the
crime. He let .fly at Expert Ames, again
calling him "that scoundrel Ames, the
maggot-breeding fly."
"Chief Lees," he said, "was going to

ALLOWED A LOW
TO GET CONTROL
A STINGING NORTHER HURRY-
ING TO DAKOTA.
Its Spiral Path Includes This State.
All Moisture Following It
Along.
There is something wrong with the
weather sharps In the interior. They have
let a "low" settle down In Montana or
Idaho or Dakota, and as a consequence
the little rain California has had is get
ting licked up by a stinging norther blow
ing cold and sharp from a "high" off the
Oregon coast. Wind blows from a "high"
spirally toward a "low," and that is why
this coast is Buffering from the negli
gence of the interior weather makers.
Eureka announced the coming of the
norther first. Then it picked up Point
Reyes and the Sacramento Valley, and,
spreading over the State, it swept down
the San Joaquin Valley, speeding for Te
hachapl and the desert beyond.
The "low" was a British production. It
started north of the line and should
never have been allowed in here at all,
but it slipped past the weather offices
and first gave warning by twirling the
wind vanes until they whirred in protest
against overwork. Then Nevada became
infected and arranged a little "secondary
depression" â an incipient low â of her
own, and the wind turned toward the
sage-brush plains and is now carrying
large clouds of Nevada over into adjoin
ing territory. Seventy miles was slow tor
Nevada for a good part of yesterday,
and unless she gets rid of her low she
wilt get it worse to-day.
Here at home the storm will last all
day to-day,' and there will succeed a cold
snap that will raise the price of over
coats. The souiii will be in a windy up
roar until to-morrow and then the cold
wave will visit there. But there will be
no rainâ and what little moisture Is in the
State will fly along with the hurrying
wind.
Forecaster Hammon says this ia the
worst norther of -the season, but he does
not think it will do any damage on the
bay.
Mr. Hammon is still on Mount Tamal
pais, but he is coming down next Satur
day or SundaV. He has prayed for rain
and threatened, and scattered salt around
his door and has fondled black cats, but
he can see nothing ahead but clear skies,
so he is coming home to await develop
ments.
Snipping along the front was warned
to look out for the norther, and accord
ingly all the vessels at the wharves be
tween Market street and Meiggs Wharf
got out extra mooring lines and prepared
hay fenders. At Point Lobos at 6 a. m.
the wind was blowing eight miles an hour
from the south, at 8 a. m. It was six
miles an hour from the northeast, at
noon thirty miles from the northwest and
'at 3 p. m. forty-four miles from the north
west. At Point Reypp the wind opened
up at thirty miles an hour from the
northwest at 8 a. m., and at noon had in
creased to fifty-five miles. At 3 p. m. it
was howling at the rate of seventy miles
an hour.
There was v slacking down of the gale
on the bay at 7 o'clock and a sudden in
crease of the wind force at 9. Along the
seawall at Meiggs wharf the storm fairly
hummed, kicking up a heavy foam-capped
swell that pounded against the dock pil
ing with tremendous power. The only
vessel at the seawall was the British ship
Fannie Kerr, which tugged at her seven
wire hawsers till they were tentioned like
fiddl-e strings. Fortunately she lay bow
on to the w4nd, which prevented her from
banging against the wall and damaging
herself.
The little quarantine steamer Sternberg
at Meiggs wharf rolled and beat against
the spring piles as if Bhe would shake the
smokestack out of her. The gasoline
launch Brink, bound out to the steamer
WeyfleM with a party of customs offi
cers, shipped several heavy seas and came
near being swamped.
At 10 o'clock the wind suddenly died
down and the air grew perceptibly colder
but the lull was but a temporary one
AN AGED MASON DYINGh
J. T. Jennings, Now in His Ninety- !
Second Year, Not Expected
to Survive.
j J. T. Jennings, residing at 43 Van Ness ;
j avenue with his daughter, a Mrs. Alex- [
I ander, is lying at death's door, and is
! given up by his attending physician, Dr.
Charles V. Cross. Jennings Is now in his
ninety-second year, and up to Christmas
day had never known what it was to be
confined to his bed by sickness. He was
born in England, and on attaining his
majority joined the Masonic fraternity.
i and remained an active member for over
; seventy-one years. He is probably one of
j the oldest master Masons living. The '
: last time Jennings participated In any of
: the craft's festivities was on October 12 ,
last, when the Grand Lodge dedicated i
( the widows' and orphans' home at De- !
. coto. On that occasion, notwithstanding
j his advanced age, he marched at thÂ«
â  head of the procession from the railway,
â¢ where the cars stopped, a dlstahce of ;
; three miles, to the site where the building
stands.
Jennings arrived in California in 1850, j
and settled In Sacramento, where he ob- |
tamed work in. the stores of the future
railroad magnates of the Stateâ Stanford,
Huntington, Crocker & Co. While in the
I employ of this firm he acted as the col- |
I lector for the house, and when they gave
the store business up he entered the
service of Senator Stanford as his private
collector.
Jennings' wife died about three years '
ago, and at the time of her death the :
aged couple had the honor of being great- 'â 
gfeat-grandpar.ente. . At a late hour last i
night Dr. Cross' considered Jennings' case
almost hopeless, as he had had a relapse.
His trouble is an attack of pneumonia, i
which he contracted on Christmas eve
while out with the younger members of
his family making holiday purchases.
Suspected Counterfeiter.

a deserted house near San Rafael. Irwin
is well known to the police here, having
been arrested several times on serious
charges. Ab.oyt ten years ago he was

BOXER JEFFRIES MATCHED.
Will Meet Joe Kennedy Before the
National Club Late in
January.
The proposed match between Jim Jef
| fries, the big Los Ang-eles boxer, and
i "Denver" Ed Smith has fallen through
and In its place has been arranged a
meeting between Joe Kennedy, the local
heavy weight, and the hard hitting man
I from the south. This match was in the
; air for a time, but was lost sight of when
negotiations for a match between Cor
bett and Jeffries were pending.
The men will meet in Woodward's Pa
vilion on January 27. under National
Club auspices, and will box twenty rounds
1 for a purse made up of 60 per cent of the
; gate receipts. This will be divided 65 per
, cent to the winner and 35 per cent to the
! loser.
Kennedy was Sharkey's sparring part
ner for a long time and Stood a lot of
punishment at the hands of the burly
sailor. He is a clever two-handed fighter,
and possesses a cool head and has a
punch that should stop any man's gallop
if it is landed. There will not be much
difference in the weights of the two men,
Kennedy scaling over 190 pounds.
Jim McDonald will referee the bout.
The men have agreed to hit with one
arm free, thus having to protect them
selves in the breakaways.

A TURKEY FOR A PUNCHING BAG.
Arthur Kohler Seeks to Become a Pugilist and
Amateur Athlete.
THE California Market possesses
one of the most novel exponents
of pugilism that ever attempted
to tread the paths of glory.
Arthur Kohler, a young, husky
German, who is employed in the
official capacity as "chief chicken
executioner" in one of the various
poultry stalls In the old market on
Pine street, has mapped out a well
defined course whereby his namo
will undoubtedly descend to poster
ity as one of the most notorious If
not one of the greatest of amateur
pugilists of the century. During
the intervals of time that necessar
ily elapse In the operation of de
stroying the lives of harmless
chlckenÃ according to the demand
for the palatable carcasses Kohler
has improved every moment In de
veloping his biceps and other mus
cles that are brought into play in
putting an opponent "out." Un
noticed by his companions he has
attempted, with considerable suc
cess, to further his ambition to
become a star "pug." Knowing that
he could not devote as much time to
his gymnastic education as he
would like, he has devised a novel
method of muscle development
which has proved an admirable sub
stitute for the punching-bag and
other paraphernalia used in the
gymnasium.
His sense of ambition Is so keen
that his nights are spent in sleep
less anxiety as to the uncertainty of
future fame. The watchman on duty
FOOD INSPECTORS
GIVEN A HEARING
CLAIM THAT DOCKERY HAD
POLITICAL LEANINGS.
Another Leper Arrives From Hono
lulu and Is Quartered at the
Pesthouse.
The Board of Health met last night to
consider the charges preferred by Chief
Food Inspector Dockery against Inspect
ors J. J. Flannlgan and William Brannan,
who were suspended on the loth lnst. for
falsifying their time slips. ,
Inspector Dockery introduced as evi
dence the time slips for December 13 and
14. According- to these slips the two In
spectors reported at the Health Office at
midnight and did not leave until 8 o'clock
in the morning. Mr. Dockery produced
witnesses who swore that the men did
not report at the hours named and also
that they had left the office before 8
o'clock In the morning.
The accused men then took the stand In
their own behalf. They admitted that the
slips were falsified, but alleged that Dock
ery had at former times Instructed them
to falsify their slips when they wanted ,to
leave early, and Flannigan openly assert
ed that the whole thing was a conspiracy
and that Dockery had trumped up the
charges because Flannigan had worked
against Dr. Clinton during the last cam
paign. He said that Inspector Lehaney
had warned him that if he worked
against Clinton he would be sorry for It.
The matter was taken under advisement
and will be discussed at the next meet
ing of the board.
A communication was received from
Dr. Heresford notifying the board that
another leper had been admitted to the
Twenty-sixth Street Hospital. She is an
English woman by birth, 56 years of age,
find arrived from Honolulu by way of
Vancouver, taking the overland route to
avoid the. quarantine. She. was pro
nounced a leper by the Health Board of
Honolulu in IMÂ»4 and claims that the au
thorities gave her permissoln to leave the
Island provided she could get Into some
other country. She claims to have con
tracted the disease while nursing small
pox patients in the pest house In this
city in 1592. She says she prefers the
local pest house to the island of Mo
lokal.
A communication was received from
Superintendent Reddy acknowledging a
donation of $250 from Mrs. Phebe Hearst
to the Almshouse and a vote of thafiks
was tendered Mrs. Hearst.

101 has elected the following named: Cap
in the market has repeatedly com
plained that Kohler has made his
way secretly Into the market in the
dead of night to practice his
strength and develop his muscles
on the chickens that have been
killed during 1 the course of tne day.
One instance in particular is cited
whore the watchman was given no
end of trouble by one of these mid
night visits. He claims that Koh
ler stole into the market the night
befora Christmas eve and rained
havoc among the poultry generally.
How long he was there or when he
i-ame is unknown to him. The only
Indication of his presence was had
about 1 o'clock in the morning, when
he was startled by a number of re
sounding whacks delivered on the
breasts of the dead chickens and
turkeys hanging on the hooks in
front of the poultry stand in the
Pine street aisle of the market
and violent muffled whisperings of
enmity and wrath uttered by Koh
lor of "Take tnat, find that, and
that: I can lick anything that
walks. See!" although the birds
were possessed of anything but ac
tion.
At first the watchman thought
somebody was being murdered. He
ran for his revolver that was se
creted in his coat pocket at one end
of the passage way. He began a
roundabout course among the dif
ferent stalls to obtain a position of
vantage over the murderer, who
ho was well convinced was beating
some employe to death. X T pon gain
ing a good position on top of an
ice-house attached to a fish stall
opposite the poultry stall he raised
his head above the boxes on top of
the house and took a survey of the
aisle below before finally command
ing the intruder to throw up his
hands.
Instead of a bloodthirsty footpad,
however, he beheld nothing more
than a confused mass of maimed
chickens nnd turkeys strewn in dis
order on thf> floor and the indistinct
form of Kohler leaning over a mam
moth turkey which he had just
knocked off one of the hooks. He
was bareheaded and had his sleeves
rolled up to the elbows. The per
spiration was literally pouring from
his forehend as he breathlessly
counted bis antagonists out. All
nround him were scores of dead
chirkons. some with broken breast
bones and others with their bends
nnd other parts of their anatomy
completely lopped off.
After exclaiming to the turkey
that he was the fifty-second man he
hnd "put out" within the short
spnee of time of two hours, Kohler
with a supreme air of victory un
rolled his trousers, which had been
turned up above his shoetops, and
started to pick his way through the
mass of dend turkeys, chickens,
ducks, etc, that covered the floor In
all directions.
Tpon finally extricating himself ho
pinned on bis Innumerable electric
diamonds to the most conspicuous
positions on hifs necktie and vest and
walked over to a deserted chicken
coop. In the hidden recesses of which
he unearthed other articles of jew
elry which be deemed the most val
unbie and had hidden there purpose
ly that they might not be lost dur
ing his pugilistic encounters with
the poultry.
After these had been carefully
stored away on his person he start
ed to crawl under one of the guard
gites erected at the northern end of
â¦he Pine street aisle of the market.
He hadn't gone n dozen steps, how
ever, when the watchman heard him
say, "Mv God. T forgot me leg de
velopment!" He retraced his steps
to the chicken coop, where he again
deposited his valuables. He then
d'srobed entirely, with the exception
of his under gnrments. and started
to circuit the entire market on a
dend run.
The watchman wishing to have a
hand In the fun, secreted himself
behind a huge section of beef in
front of a meat stall and await Â«vl
Kohler's arrival from the opposite
end of the mnrket. As he passed
panting like a frightened deer the
watrhmnn lumped into the nisle,
"squared off" nnd tolu Kohler to
come on: thnt he would jrlve him
more real fighting in a minute than
he has ever seen during his entire
career as nn amateur pugilist.
Down Kohler went on all fours,
pleading like a frightened school
boy for the watchman not to hit,
him. and he would make it all right
with htm. He protested that he
just wanted a little exercise and
didn't mean to harm the chickens.
The watchman gave way in his
determination, but demanded that
Kohler pick up every chicken and
restore it to its original position on
the hooks. After about an hour's
work he succeeded in getting them
back to their original positions. He
wns then allowed to dress himself
and make his escape through the
guard gate. unon. gaining which he
started on a dead run toward Cali
fornia street.

GHOST OF THE BLYTHE CASK
Mrs. Florence Hinckley Will Have to
Pay an Old Debt.
In the early part of 1892 Mrs. Florence
Blythe-Hlnckley and her husband made
out two instruments in writing by which
they promised to pay to Thomas I. Ber
gin the sum of 115.442 for moneys, etc., ad
vanced by him during the contest for the
estate of Thomas H. Blythe. The promise
made was to pay the moneys a year after
the case was determined by the courts,
and Florence was placed In full possession
Of the property of her father,
â ci v. 6 Ber B in w a 8 obliged to sue the
.Blytnes for the money, and they contest
ed his right to do so on the ground that
the case had not been finally settledâ at
least It had not been settled one year be
fore the beginning of the action.
In the lower court Bergin was success
ful and judgment was given in his favor.
The Blythes appealed the case to the Su
preme Court. That tribunal reviewed all
of the cases branching out of the main
cause and decided that they had all been
disposed of at the time the action by Ber
gin was begun. Hence the judgment of
the lower court was affirmed and the
Blythes will have to pay the money and
interest.
BONDS ARE ALL RIGHT.
Broderick Will Accept Corporations
as Sureties for County Officials.
Auditor Broderick denies the claim set
Up by Mayor Phelan that newly elected
county officials must find personal sure
ties for their bonds, and he says he will
accept all bonds brought to him with cor
porations or surety companies named aa
the sponsors. The announcement that
Mayor Phelan would accept no such se
curity raised a good bit of a storm yes
terday among the officials his decision
affected. Most of them had applied to
the surety companies, and as they had
only three days more in which to file,
their papers they were at a loss to know
what to do in the matter. Mr. Broderick
came down to his office in the afternoon
and after looking over Mr. Phelan's law
and that in the codes he discovered that
section 66 of the county government act
upon which the Mayor based his decision
is not operative in this county for the
reason that it has never been applied, and
the present government is not working
under its provisions. Basing his opinion
upon the consolidation act, he announced
to all who were interested that their
bonds would be accepted whether they
were backed by corporations or individ
uals, so long as the sureties were respon
sible. Mr. Broderick also says that the
bonds do not require war revenue stamps,
and in this he has relieved another worry.

ASSERTS HER CLAIM
UPON THE DEAD
UNKNOWN WOMAN DEMANDS
THE BODY OF H. M. PEARCE.
Says the Deceased Is Her Long-Lost
Father â Complete Mystery Sur
rounds Her Identity.
PEARCE âIn this city, December 26, IS9B.
Henry M., ilearly beloved husband of Mary
Pearee, and father nf Mrs. JoÃeph Mclls, Mrs.
B. A. D. .Jones and Nelllle O. Pearce, a na
tive of England, aged 63 years 10 months and
9 rtnys.
(TT Friends are respectfully Invited to at
tend the funeral to-morrow (Thursday), at 11
o'clock, from his late residence, 1625 Oak
street. Interment private.
Around the above death notice is woven
a mystery. Early yesterday afternoon an
elderly woman called at the Morgue arid
asked to see the dead body of Henry M.
Pearee, who, she claimed, was her long
lost father. She presented the above no
tice and stated that she had vfsfted the
late home of he:r' father on Oak street,
but his relatives denied that he was
there. She again visited the Morgue and
the officials told her to go to police head
quarters and tell her story to Chief Lees.
Whether fche d-- this or not is un
known, but up' to a late hour last night
no effort had been made by the police to
force the Pearce family to comply with
the wish of the woman to view the body.
The Morgue officials seem to think that
the claimant is a demented fiend, whose
momanla is that- of reading the various
published records of death and imagin
ing that she bears a relation to different
people whose names appear in the death
notices. Others seem to think the wo
man's Btory is true and credit it abso
lntely.
At the late residence of the deceased,
however, they refuse, absolutely to allow
any stranger in the house.
The funeral, as the notice states, In
strictly private. Where it will be held is
unknown. These and other circumstances
consequent upon the death of Pearce lend

Special Cable io The Call and the Xew York Herald. Copyrighted, 1898,

MANAMA, Dec. 28.â Ecuadorian political exiles here have received
a telegram through the Colombian frontier saying that Tulcan was
taken recently by invading revolutionary forces under General Riva
denevia, defeating the government troops.
The Call-Herald correspondent at Guayaquil confirms this news.
The invaders pretended to march on Ibarra with the intention 01 In
tercepting the artillery on the way from Quito for General Arellano's
forces in Tulcan.
To frustrate the revolutionists' strategic plans General Arellano
abandoned his military positions around Tulcan, marching out all his
forces to prevent the artillery falling into the enemy's hands. Imme
diately after the rebels had occupied the town General Arellano re
turned, trying to reoecupy hia lost positions, which at laat accounts
were still held by the invaders.
Important details of the significant battle are momentarily ex
pected. The invading army is said to be largely composed of a
Colombian contingent. Tulcan is situated on the Colombian frontier.
It is the capital of Carchi province and is well fortified. Ibarra is
situated between Quito and Tulcan.
NEW YORK, Eec. 28.â A recent special cable to the Call and

over the country.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 28.â George
W. WiljiÃ, one of the best-known min
ing brokers and promoters on the coast,
who came here from San Francisco
about two years ago, has left home
and a host of creditors to try Ms for
tune elsewhere. This fact has been no
secret for a week, but not until to
day, when some of his creditors became
clamorous, was It announced at his
former place of business that he had
"skipped." This evening Willis' flight
is the talk of the streets. It appears
that before leaving he made a clean-up
from two trusting friends. His manipu
lations were so glaring that it is dif
ficult to see how even his intimates
were duped, but they were, to the ex
tent of many thousands of dollars.
A chronicle of Willis' different
schemes worked to obtain money and
keep out of the law's clutches would
make a long story, but he relied for
safety on the intimacy of those closest
to him, who allowed sentiment to im
pair their judgment. Willis seems to
have made a canvass of the biggest
merchants in the place.
The affair has created a great sensa
tion here, ' as Willis was a free liver
and as a man about town was a "hail
fellow well met" with every body, but
he traveled the pace that kills. Mr.
Willis attempted to borrow money at
nearly every office on the street, but,
failing in this, he turned to his friends.
Two intimate friends, it is said, lost
$1000 each and several others from $200
to $500 each. In every case the money
was obtained through false representa
tions and shady transactions.

EAN '.FRANCISCO, CAUAMERICANS MAY YET
HAVE TO FIGHT THE
REBEL FILIPINOS
Otis and Deweu Instructed to Maintain
United States Authority at Iloilo
"at All Hazards."
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, Dec. 28.
TCall correspondent has the highest authority for the statement that the President has instructed General
Otis and Admiral Dewey to maintain United States authority in Iloilo "at all hazards."
This means that If the Filipinos refuse to surrender the town is to be taken by force of arms, and that
the Baltimore will aid by bombarding. It is hoped and believed, however, that the good sense of the Fili
pinos will prevail to prevent bloodshed.
A prominent army officer who saw the instructions wired to Otis says that General Miller will march
Into the city and take charge in the name of the United States.
The news of the evacuation of Iloilo by the Spaniards and its capture by the insurgents has given fresh en
couragement to the opponents of the Paris treaty, who point out that trouble with the Filipinos will be never-ending
unless we grant them independence.
The President has been studying the Philippine situation in connection with the peace treaty. He is satisfied the
treaty will be ratified by the Senate, and that no amendment will be adopted declaring that it Is not the policy of
this country to exercise sovereignty over the islands. He has received assurances from a number o-f Democratic Sena
tors that they will not oppose the treaty, but will reserve the right to develop their position later as to the future of
the islands.
The President believes that no man can at this time form and hold a settled conviction as to what should be
the future relations of the islands to this country. That is a question over which he believes there may be much dif
ference of opinion. Never by Word or indirect allusion has he given anybody to understand that he will favor the
annexation of the islands, or that he will recommend their Independence. He is listening to the views of others, and
is acquiring all the Information he can get. When public men approach him and ask why such and such a thing
is not done he promptly asks them to give their views as to how it ought to be done. The responsibility is shifted to
their shoulders.
Brigadier General Miller is in command of the expedition sent to Iloilo. The troops consist of the Eighteenth
regular infantry. Fifty-first lowa Volunteer Infantry and a battery of regular artillery.
It is said at the Navy Department that no instructions have been sent to Admiral Dewey to dispatch vessels
to Iloilo. No doubt is felt over the ability of the American forces to compel the insurgents to evacuate Iloilo by the
use of the Baltimore's guns, but there is a hopeful feeling that bombardment may not be necessary.
General Miller's detachment numbers about 2100 men, and it is believed the insurgents have not a greater
force.
When the Raleigh paid a visit to Iloilo the officers were received coolly and suspiciously by the officers of the
Filipino army near the town, who had received orders from Aguinaldo not to have any dealings wfth the Americans.
It is this stubborn and defiant attitude of Aguinaldo which causes the greatest concern. The Government officials
believe that if he were removed from power there would be no difficulty in arranging for the disbandment of the
Filipinos under arms. Should he make up his mind to enter into a contest with the Americans for the control of the
islands, the Government may find it necesary to dispatch heavy reinforcements to both Otis and Dewey. It Is said
even now, despite denials at th* Navy Department, that the orders to the Oregon and lowa were changed since the
receipt of Otis' dispatch, and they will proceed directly to Manila by way of Honolulu, instead of coming to San
Francisco, as had been the plan.

ESTIMATED COST
NICARAGUA CANAL
Preliminary Report of
Commission.
THREE FEASIBLE ROUTES
MAXIMUM FIGURES SUBMITTED
ARE $124,000,000.
Senator Morgan, However, Believes i
That One Hundred Million Will
Cover the Entire
Expense.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â Copies of
the preliminary report of the Nicaragua
Canal Commission, of which Admiral
Walker is chairman, have been fur
nished to Senator Morgan and others
interested in the bill now pending in
Congress on that sublet.
The commission has not fully worked
out all the details of construction of
the proposed canal, but the report
simply presents briefly the views of the
commissioners as to the feasibility of
the work and the maximum cost at
which it is believed the waterway can
be constructed.
Three routes are spoken of, viz.: The
old low level, the high level, or Menocal
route, and an intermediate route, and
all of these, Senator Morgan says, the
commission considers feasible of con
struction.
For the purpose of arriving at an
estimate of probable maximum cost the
commission submitted figures on the
low level route, which the Senator says
is considered the longest and most ex
pensive. For this route Admiral Walk
er estimated the cost Avould be $124,000,
000 and Professor Haupt ?123,000,000,
while General Haines added 20 per cent
to the figures because of various con
ditions, chiefly the question of the cost
of labor, which it was thought impos
sible to figure with absolute definite
ness.
The report, says the Senator, shows
conclusively that, the project is an en
tirely feasible one, and that in its con
struction the Government has the
choice of any of these routes. It shows
further, Senator Morgan stated, the ab
solute accuracy of the survey made by
Engineer Menoc.al some years ago.
The Senator believes, however, that
all these figures are too high and ex
presses the opinion that $100,000,000 will
cover the entire cost of construction,
basing the belief on what has been done
in the case of the Manchester, the Kiel
and the Chicago drainage canals, and
on the reduced cost of material and
labor to-day, as compared with what
would have been necessary in the ear
lier discussion of the building of the
proposed waterway.
PANAMA CANAL SEEKS

LONDON. Dec. 29.â The Paris corre

At the annual meeting of the new Pan

long report was read, in addition to show

adopted for the completion of the canal.
The report refer? to the American inter
est in the Niearaguan Canal since the
Hlspano-American war, and indicates the
means taken to acquaint the United
States Government and the American peo
ple with the position and prospects of
the Panama canal. On this point it Bays:
"We have offered to place at the dis
posal of the United States every f aril it v
for examining our works and plans, which
will readily convince them of the superi
ority, from all points of view, of the Pan
ama route. They will find in the treat
ies existing between them and Colombia,
and in the facilities allowed by our stat
utes, all the guarantees and advantages
which their national interests can rea
sonably require. The Panama route is
undisputably the maritime highway, which
can be opened to navigation in the short
est time and at the least expense."

DUSTERS BOUGHT
San Jose's Extravagant
School Board.
PATRONIZING ITS MEMBERS
PARLOR FINERY FOR THE USE
OF JANITORS.
Because of Recent Treasury Raids the
Streets of the Garden City Will
Not Be Lighted Next
Month.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 28.â The extrava
gance of the San Jose School Board
continues to attract attention. While
funds have been so short as to cripple
the schools the trustees have gone right
on buying the most costly supplies. In
fact the janitors have been given al
most carte blanche, and what extrava
gant tendencies they lacked in purchas
ing have been supplied by members of
the committee on supplies.
A bill allowed Supervisor F. M. Stern,
who deals in harness, saddles, etc.,
shows the nature of the board's ex
travagance. The Items amount to $150
and the purchases were delivered be
tween August 1 and November 30. The
principal charges are $5 for feather
dusters :ind $4 50 for floor brushes. The
dusters are made of ostrich feathers
and are of the very finest kind. Other
articles are chamois skins and sponges,
but the expensive dusters and floor
brushes make up the major part of the
bill. At this rate it will cost the city
several hundred dollars a year for dus
ters and brushes. A cheaper and as
serviceable article could be purchased
for half the money.
The expose by The Call a few months
ago of Trustee Graham drawing $15 a
month from the city for rent of the
Cottage Grove Kindergarten building
under the assumed name of J. N. White
has been apparently verified. When
the bill was presented for the six
months ending December 16 Graham
gave orders to have the warrant drawn
in the name of Mary McDonald, his sis
ter-in-law. The warrant for $90 was
cashed by Miss McDortald, who ap
parently has an interest in the build
ing and lot. Previous to his having
been exposed Graham always drew the
money himself and indorsed the war
rant.
The City Board of Educationâ that is.
Trustees Graham, Langford and Ken
yon â are endeavoring to open the kin
dergartens, which were recently or
dered closed because of a shortage of
funds. The opening of the kindergar
tens will plunge the school department
into an indebtedness of from $10,000 to
$12,000 at the end of the fiscal year. It
is proposed to draw on $16,000 that will
be available from the State funds in
June. Opposing this action are Trus
tees Wemple and O'Neil, but they axe
unable to hold the others in check.
The streets of San Jose will be
shrouded in darkness for the next six
months and the belated business man
will have to grope his way home. This
condition is brought about by the fail
ure of the two electric lighting com
ranies to put in bids for lighting the
streets for the rest of the year. At
present the Electric Improvement Com
pany has the contract for street light
ing at $1510 a month. This expires at
the end of the year. Owing to the
shortage of funds the Council decided
to dispense with half of the lights, cut
tins down the cost of lighting the city
to a little over $700. No bids were re
ceived to-day from the lighting com
panies, and Mayor Martin says th<s
streets will not be lighted next month.
Unless new bids are called for darkneus
will prevail until after June 30. A year
ago the same difflcul:y overtook the
city and rhc streets were not lighted for
several months.
This condition arises from the ex
travagance of the old Council.

Before His Marriage to the
California Heiress Is Sol
emnized.
Brutal Diipatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â Since Miss
Virginia Fair, sister of Mrs. Her
man Oelrichs, was introduced
into New York society a few
seasons ago gossips have been
busy engaging her in marriage to this
or that desirable party. Indeed, al
though her sister promptly denied the
various reports they were so quickly
supplemented by others setting out on
their travels with merely a new name
attached to that of the young lady that
when it was recently told over 5 o'clock
tea cups that Miss Fair was really en
gaged and to William K. Vanderbilt
Jr. it hardly caused an incredulous
â¢'Really!" from those who had heard
an oft-repeated, unfounded tale.
For once, however, gossips were right.
The young lady is to marry the eldest
son of William K. Vanderbilt, and the
engagement was formally announced
to-day. The news was not believed at
firet even in usually well-informed
circles, but when it was confirmed at
Mr. and Mrs. Oelrichs" home the tidings
flew like wildfire up and down Fifth
avenue and good wishes began to pour
in upon the young lady and hearty con
gratulations upon the young fellow who
had won the hand of one of the wealthy
and most popular society girls in New
York.
There was a certain satisfaction, too,
in the knowledge that neither of thnm
had gone abroad in making the choice
for life, but would be identified with
New York as their future home.
While the fortune of Miss Fair is not
to be mentioned â large as it is â in con
nection with the prospects of the future
husband, it is still a great sum, as she
inherited both from her father and
mother a sum variously estimated, but
presumed to be over $3,000,000.
What William K. Vanderbilt Jr. will
Inherit cannot be told. His father's
fortune long since was said to be $75,
000,000, and it is well known that It
has been increased more than once by
millions â how many only Mr. Vander
bilt can say. Were he displeased with
any match his son might make of
course it would result in the latter re
ceiving less favorable consideration In I
his father's will, but Mr. Vanderbilt
pere Is In entire accord with his son's
marriage to this young lady.
If proof of this were needed It Is
shown In the fact that Mr. Vanderbilt
already has arranged a small house
party In honor of his son and Miss

GROSS MALCONDUCT
OF ELECTION OFFICERS
Ballots of One San Jose Precinct
Dumped Into the Jellar of the
Courthouse.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 28.â The recount of the
votes cast in the late election took a sen
sational turn this afternoon when the
Ninth Precinct of the city was reached.
The startling disclosure was made that
the ballots of that precinct were not re
turned to the County Clerk after having
been counted, but found their way into
the cellar of the courthouse, where they
were fished out by Janitor Fitzgerald and
returned to the Clerk's office. After prov
ing this by three witnesses, Attorney
Campbell moved that the vote and re
turns of the Ninth Precinct be thrown
out on account of the gross malconduct
of the election officers and the violation
of plain and mandatory provisions of
the law.
Most of the afternoon was spent in ar
gument. Attorney Campbell, for the con
testants, insisted that the ballots could
not be counted, for they had not been
properly returned, and asked that the pre
< Inct be thrown out. Attorney Leib eon
trnded that the official count should be
taken. Campbell said if the official can
vass were taken, i rooked election boards
would have no difficulty in covering up
their frork by burning the ballots. Judges
Kittredge aii'l Hyland took the matter un
der advisement. The Ninth Precinct
will be passed until a decision is ren
dered.
If the Ninth Precinct be thrown out
Langford, for Sheriff will lose 33 more
votes than Lyndon, Lotz for Treasurer
38 more than Conant, and Gass for City
Justice 12 more than Aggeler. This will in
sure the contestants' election.
Owing to irregularities an attempt will
be made to throw out Guadalupe Pre
cinct also.
The Eighth Precinct showed no change
for Lyndon or Conant. Aggeler gained
two. This makes Aggeler's net gain 21.
An unofficial canvass of the vote for Dis
trict Attorney showed that Campbell
gained 8, making a total of 65 not counted
for him in eight precincts.

FATHER PRENDERGAST
Telegram That Is Believed to Have
Contained News of Her Be
trothal.
Father John J. Prendergast. vicar
general of the Archdiocese of San
Francisco, yesterday received a tele
pram from Miss Virginia Fair. Father
Prendergast was for years the adviser
of Miss Fair and is still her most
trusted friend. Therefore the receipt
of the telegram, coming so closely after
the report that Miss Fair was be
trothed to William K. Vanderbilt Jr..
gave rise to the belief amone the
young lady's friends in this city that it
related to her engagement and that she
was seeking the advice of the reverend
father. The vicar-general would not
divulge the nature of the dispatch, but
he did not deny that it related to the
engagement of Miss Fair and Mr. Van
derbilt.
"Until the lady gets ready to speak
I must hold my peace," he said. "As I
have always advised her as to any im
portant move she was about to make,
it w4uld be perfectly natural for her to
seek my advice in this affair of the
heart. However, It would be violating
a confidence should I reveal the con
tents of the message I received from
Miss Fair."
Father Prendergast was asked If It
were not likely that Miss Fair would
come to San Francisco, and that her
marriage to Mr. Vanderbilt would be

PLACERVILLE, Dec. 28.â Rob V. Rob

Mr. Robertson was one of the best
known of the younger journalists of the

INHUMAN CRUELTY ALLEGED.
Seeker for Divorce Files a Sensational
Complaint.
TACOMA, Dec. 28. - Startling charges
are made in the complaint in a suit for
divorce filed here by Julia E. Rowe
against Lucien E. Rowe. The couple were
married at Centralla, this State, ten
years ago. The wife makes allegations of
fiendish cruelty and a willful course of
neglect when she was ill. She claims the
defendant refused to provide for her,
but when pressure was brought to bear
by relatives he assumed a better attitude
for a while. The acme of cruelty was
reached when, in May, 1895, according to
the complaint, Rowe, for the purpose of
frightening his wife, seized and held
her on a railroad track while a passen
ger train was rapidly approaching, Tne
wife by desperate efforts and the use of
extraordinary strength, it is alleged, re
leased herself from her husband's grasp
and jumped off the track just in time to
save her life.
Another demonstration of his cruelty
took place in June, 1886, it is claimed,
when the husband drew a pistol on her
in a pantry. When she reproved him he
excuspd himself and his conduct by say
ing he thought she was a burglar.
The Rnwes have lived on a farm, which,
Mrs. Rowe claims, was purchased with
her money before their marriage. She
at'ks for $300 temporary alimony and that
Rowe be restrained from disposing of tins
property.
GIRL BURNED TO DEATH.
Horrible Fate of an Inmate of the
Whittier Reform School.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 28.â 1t has just

j tier Reform School named Lydia Brown
I was burned to death. She was at work
I near a range in the kitchen and her cloth

out hesitation that it was not and that '
the wedding, should It occur at all. j
j would be celebrated in New York after !
j Mr. Vanderbilt left college. He sooke ;
| so emphatically in this regard as to
I convey the impression that he had been
let into all the secret plans of the j
young people whose names are con
nected in the reported engagement.
The estimated value of the Fair es- |
tate is 512,000,000, half in real and half
personal property. The late Senator j
i Fair in his last will left his entire es- j
tate in trust for his two daughters and :
â  his son, Charles Fair. During their '
j lives they were each to receive a third ,
lof the income. Upon the death of either j
daughter a fourth of the estate was to j
go to her children and after the death
of both daughters half the estate was
to go to the brothers and sisters of the
late Senator Fair, or their heirs.
Charles Fair was cut off with only a i
third of the Income and neither he nor
his heirs were to receive any of the j
principal of the estate. This was be- j
; cause of his marriage, which his father
I opposed. Superior Judge Slack of this I
j city in a decision declared the trust
clause, in so far as it related to real
estate, invalid, but the trustees of the |
will have appealed to the Supreme |
Court from this decision. The children I
of the late Senator are endeavoring to i
have the trust clause relating to the |
personal property also invalidated.
Virginia Fair, on the death of h.^r
J mother, received $1,500,000. This, with
her share of her father's estate in trust j
makes her fortune about $5,000,000.
Miss Fair was educated in the con
vent of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart
in this city. Her trusted friend during
her school days was Vicar General
Prendergast, and since her departure
for the East he has kept in constant
communication with her. She is about
I 26 years of age.

TRINIDAD, Colo., Dec. 28. â The
Santa Fe eastbound California limited
train, No. 4, was wrecked ten miles
east of this city at 7 o'clock this morn-
Ing. The accident happened on a curve
and it is supposed to have been caused
by the spreading of the rails. The en
gine, one Pullman and the dining car
passed over all right, the observation
car, two drawing-room sleepers and
composite car leaving the track. The
wreck immediately caught fire from
an explosion of the gas in the com
posite car, and the entire four cars were
burned up.
Those in the composite car are re
ported badly injured. *^o one was
killed.
The injured are:
CONDUCTOR C. D. BOUCHER, Las

burned by gas explosion.
FRANK BOPE, brakeman Las Ve

hands.
C. C. FAIRBANKS, Pullman porter,

CHARLES L. HEVEREN, New York
City, slightly bruised on the he id.
A corpse which was en route for
Philadelphia was cremated in the fire.
Physicians from this city were im
mediately taken to the scene of the
wreck and cared for the injured peo
ple, after which they were taken to La
Junta.
The passengers in the first sleeping
car and those connected with the din
ing car service immediately set to
work to rescue and make comfortable
the passengers in the overturned and
burning cars. The injured were all
taken out through the windows and all
were rescued alive, although Brakeman
Frank Bope of Las Vegas was burned
so badly and otherwise injured that his
recovery is considered doubtful. Many
heroic acts were performed in extricat
ing the passengers from their perilous
positions. The composite car was en
veloped in flames within a few minutes
after it was overturned and had it not
been for the timely assistance of the
more fortunate passengers and a part
of the train crew, many would have
suffered an awful death.

with all her might until she got him

his overcoat, shoes and hat, and his
wife, who worked so heroically to save
his life, lost all her wraps in the fire.
Mrs. M. B. Rosenberger of Ontario,
California, received a slight contusion
of the right arm. She lost some money
and also some jewelry in the fire. Mrs.
Rosenberger was on a sad mission to
Philadelphia, accompanying the re

DR. H. SEWARD WEBB
MAY SUCCEED MORRILL
Is a Member of the Vanderbilt Fam
ily by Marriage and Very

CHICAGO, Dec. 28.â A Washingtrr spe
cial to the Post says: Vermon crs in
Washington think the new Senator from
that State will be Dr. H. Seward Webb,
member by marriage of the Vanderbilt
family. Dr. Webb became a resident of
Vermont several years ago, built himself
a splendid mansion arid takes a great in
terest in politics. He was originally a St.
Louis physician. Of late years he has
been actively and prominently identified
with the management of the vast Vander
bilt interests, Ills special assignment being
to look after the Wagner Palace Car
Company.
With Dr. Webb and Dr. Chauncey M.
Depew in the Senate of the United States
the Vanderbilts will be well represented
in the upper walks of national politics.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â There is much
speculation as to who will succeed Sena
tor Morrill as chairman of the Senate
Committee on Finance. The committee is
generally considered in some respects the
most important in the Senate. It cer
tainly is so at times when financial or
tariff legislation is under consideration,
hut it has Jiot heretofore been of the con
tinuing importance as the Committee on
Appropriations.
Senator Allison, who is now chairman
of the Appropriations Committee, has
since Senator Sherman's retirement stood
next to Senator Morrill on the Finance
Committee, and under the unwritten rules
of the Senate he would succeed to the

it should be decided, as it probably will
be, to advance money, charging it against
the revenues of Cuba, to pay the Cubans
part of the money due them for their
services in the Cuban army. Pending the
establishment of a permanent govern
ment, there is no authority responsible
for the payment of these soldiers, and
unless this Government advance the
money as a loan they will have to go
for an Indefinite period without pay for
services already rendered in the war for
independence.
The special deficiency appropriation bill
carries an item of $3,000,000 as an emer
gency fund which the Government may
use for any purpose, and the idea is to
advance the money for the payment of
the Cuban soldiers out of this fund. It
is understood, however, the President has
not yet consented to this arrangement.
MAJOR GENERAL GREENE
OUT OF THE ARMY
Resignation of the Officer Accepted
With Regret hy the War
Department.
WASHINGTON', Dec. 2S.â Major Gen
eral Francis A. Greene arrived in Wash
ington this morning from New York, and
reported at once at the War Department
to Secretary Alger. He came to resign
his commission as an officer of the volun
teer army, preparatory to his return to
private life.
General Greene has been of exceptional
service in the past war, being one of the
first officers of rank to take part in the
campaign in th<Â» Philippines, and he per
formed most t-ffective work in Havana
after the death of Colonel Waring in re
forming the sanitary conditions there
and assisting the United States Evacua
tion Commission in effecting the change
of property interests. It is with regret
that the War Department accepts his
resignation.
ARMY SANITARIUM
AT A JAPANESE PORT
Surgeon General Sternberg Favors
the Establishment of One at
Nagasaki.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2S.â The Secretary
of War has received a recommendation
from Surgeon General Sternbe-g for the
establishment of an army sanitarium at
Nagasaki, Japan, for the use of the
United States troops at Manila. The rec
ommendation has not yet been approved,
but it is looked upon with much favor,
owing to the desirability of having such
a sanitarium wt-ll away from the Philip
pines and from any possible epidemics
which may arise there. It would re
quire the consent of the Japanese Gov
ernment, but little doubt exists that this
wuuid be given.
SUGAR BEET SHORTAGE.
Market in Germany Stronger Than
for Some Time.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â A deficit in
the German beet sugar crop of at least
350,000 tons 1b figured upon by United
States Consul Diedrich, at Magdeburg.
He says that the backward season re
sulted In a small deficiency. A number
of manufacturers sold fully one-half of
their last year's product at very low
prices before they realized that there
would be a shortage in material, and
the end of November found a number of
factories closed on account of the diffi
culty In getting material.
All the old stocks of sugar in Europe
having run low, the market has been
stronger for some time, with upward
prices. The estimate of the beet sugar
crop for the world accepted in Germany
as accurate is 4,775. f>55 tons, Germany
loading with 1,847,018 tons, and Cuba being
set down as producing 3iKÂ»,000 tons, against
2,537,571 tons In the previous season.

BRUTAL ASSAULT
UPON A WOMAN
Santa Rosa Thug's Das
tardly Crime.
HIS VICTIM ALMOST KILLED
FELLED WITH A BLOW FROM A,
SLUNGSHOT.
Police and Enraged Citizens Search
ing the City, Intent on Wreak
. ing Vengeance Upon
the Culprit.
Special rÂ«sr>at(-h to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. Dec. 28.â The polic*
of this city, aided by enraged citizens,
are out in a body searching for the au
thor of what was the most dastardly
assault ever made upon a woman in
Santa Rosa. This evening as Mrs.
G. E. Hollister, wife of the pastor of
the First Adventist Church, was reÂ«
turning to her home on Upper Fourth
street, she was attacked by a footpad
and it was only by a narrow chance
that she was hot killed. The affair oc
curred just at the corner of Fourth
street and McDonald, the spot wherÂ«
the mysterious choker who operated
here last winter attacked two well
known young ladies. The place is
dark and well suited to the perpetra
tion of a crime of this nature.
Just as Mrs. Hollister passed into tha
shadow cast by a huge oak. tree tha
ruffian stepped out from behind a bill
board and struck her behind the right
ear with a heavy s.lungshot made from
two cobbles tied in the corner of a large
linen handkerchief.
The blow almost severed the ear from
the lady's head and cut her frightful
ly, but, strange to say, did not knock
her senseless, as the villain must havi*
intended. Instead of falling prostrate
she began to scream at the top of her
voice. Henry Matthias, who lives next
door, heard the cries for help and
rushed out. He immediately gave
chase to the thug, who had started to
run up College avenue. Matthias was
joined by other neighbors, but owing
to the darkness the pursuit had to be
abandoned. The police were notified
and began a systematic search.
The description given by Mrs. Hollis
ter of her assailant is very meager, as
she was too badly frightened to pay
much attention to his appearance. Dr.
Ross, who was called to attend the in
jured lady, says she had a very nar
row escape. At present she is delirious
and he fears the injury may prove
very serious.
It will go hard with the thug if he
be caught to-night. In his haste he
dropped his improvised weapon, which
was found by the officers. This may
lead to his detection, as the handker
chief is of a peculiar pattern.
Torpedo Boat Storm-Bound.
PORTLAND. Or., Dec. 2S.â The torpedo
boat Davis, which left this port last Fri
day for Mare Island Navy Yard, is storm
bound In Tillamook Bay. The Davis en
countered heavy weather after going to
sea and put into Tillamook, where she
probably will remain until the weather
moderates.

BALLOTING AT SANT* ROSA
SACBAMENTo GETS THE NEXT
CONVENTION.
Noted Educators Address thÂ« State
Institute and Participate in
Bound - Table Dis
cussions.
Special Dlsi>atch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 2S.â The clerk of
the weather seems to be making a
special effort to win the pood graces of
the educators of the State gathered
here in such numbers this week. Every
day has been almost like one in spring
time and this morning was no excep
tion. As a result it seemed to have
become the proper thing to take a long
constitutional, or at least a short walk
of some kind, every morning before
starting for the convention hall. Both
men and women, sometimes alone but
often together, seem to have adopted
the custom.
Tie session this morning was called
to order at 9 o'clock by State President
C. W. Childs of San Jose. Owing to the
p<">r facilities provided for heating the
Athenaeum the place of meeting had
been changed to the Fifth-street Meth
odist Episcopal Church, just across the
street. The edifice is large, commo
dious and in every way suited to the
needs of the association. It is de
cidedly more cheerful and comfortable
than the theater building and all the re
maining morning sessions will be held
there.
As soon as the assemblage had come
to "rder an invocation was delivered by
I :Â«v. L. D. Rathbone, pastor of the
First Congregational Church, after
which a trio consisting of Mrs. TV. S.
-Mrs. R. J. Pye and Mrs. Dr. K.
Gale of this city rendered a beautiful
lion.
Professor William Carey Jones of the
University of California delivered the
initial lecture of the morning session.
subject was "Some Prospects of
Californian Civilization." The address
. ed and during the course
Df his remarks the speaker drew an at
tlve picture tending to show what
Improvements the future might be ex
â¢ 1 to present in the field of educa
tion.
An interesting paper was next read
bj Miss Jane Seymour Klink of the
'. "rancisco Teachers' Club upon the
subject of "Teachers' Clubs." She
Sly advocated the formation of
such crKar.izations in every city in the
land, saying that their existence tended
to promote aristocracy of intellect and
the general intellectual advancement of
al! fortunate enough to come within
th~ sphere of thfir influence.
Miss Eliza D. Keith, also a member
of the San Francisco Teachers' Club,
read a splendid paper entitled
'â¢The School and the Home," which
Bhowed much care in its preparation
and also a keen insight into the con
ditions surrounding both the home and
the schoolroom. She urged the greatest
le co-operation between the
mother and the teacher, and showed
clearly that a close relationship should
always exist -between the two.

followed with hi? address upon the sub
jprt "Coming Education." He out
lined many improvements which might
with benefit be introduced into the
pre=ont lucational system of the State.
Aftor a short recess President Childs
again called the association to order,
and, after listening to a selection by a
vocal trio from the Etude Club of this
city, short addresses on behalf of the
ting of the National Educational
Association to be held in Los Angeles
next July were heard from Dr. Pierce,
Hon. J.->hn Swett, J. W. McClyrnonds,
D. C. Clark, F. L. Burke and S. Fashay.
At the conclusion of their remarks a
resolution was adopted by a unanimous
vote endorsing the meeting of the Na
tional Educational Association and
urging al! teachers in the State to at
tend it.
a committee on resolutions was ap
pointed by President Chi Ids as follows:
W. H. D. Raymond. Superintendent
Barr. Washington Wilson, and Miss
Kate Ames of Nfapa. The appointment
of this committee was followed by the
announcement that the next thing in
r>v<]'-v would be a business meeting, held
for the purpose of electing officers for
the ensuing year and the choice of the
next meeting place. The announcement
created quite a stir of excitement.
K<>r the office of president Frederic
L. Burke, principal of the Santa Bar
bara schools, was placed in nomination,
as was also J. W. M'-ciymonds of Oak
hind. When the ballot had been taken
It was shown that Burke had received
a majority and he was declared elected.
A. S. Barker of Salinas and Richard
r j Fau!kem-r of Ran Francisco were se-
I its vk-p-presidents; Mrs. M. M.
San Francisco was re
â¢i secretary, as was F. K. Barthal
of s,m Jose, assistant secretary, and
F ;â '. Hunker of fanta Rosa as
railroad secretary.
p Prior of San Francisco was
made I reasurer.
It ha I been understood that when the
tim> ' c for selecting the next place
of meeting a pretty fight would de
velop. Clark of Santa Cruz was said
to be out for the city by the sea, and
the Snn Jos'- poople were believed Jto
want it again, but when it came to the
actual point Sacramento was the only
point proposed, and she was given the
honor by a unanimous vote.
At this Juncture J. W. McClymonds
akland arose and offered a strong
r^s' luiion providing for a change in the
tltution of the State associations
whereby each section of the State
niicht havp an equal chance in the
matter of securing the meetlnes of the
associations and the benefits derived
from them. He reported upon behajf
of the special committee appointed at
thp last meeting, and tho change sug
gested was that a fourth district be
created and that hereafter one meeting
be held in each district in succession.
The northern part of the State was
selected for 1900, the San Joaquin Val
ley for 1901, and the bay section for
Iftn2. ;md so on. The matter will be
passed upon latrr.
Great interest was manifested in the
addresses by Dr. G. Stanley Hall, pres
ident of Clark T T niversity, recognized
aa the greatest American authority on
child study. His first paper was read
before the kindergarten department at

NOVEL EXPERIMENTS
WITH LIQUID AIR
Chunks of Atmosphere Thrown
About the Floor at a Chemical
Society Banquet.
NEW YORK. Dec. 28.â The various won
ders of air when It is Hauefied were
shown to visiting members of the Ameri
can Chemical Society to-night at the Col
lege of the City of New York by Charles
E. Triplar. Liquid air, which has a tem
perature below 200 below zero, was passed
around the room in cups, thrown about
on the floor and experimented with as
the chemist's fancy dictated. They were
cautious in handling it, however, as such
temperature is productive of frost bite
on short notice.
Some interesting experiments in burn
ing were shown, a diamond being con
sumed in liquid air, giving forth a fierce
light, a hole being burned through a
steel cup in which the experiment was
made In a few seconds. Experiments
with liquid oxygen and a magnet showed
that thf- substance was highly suscepti
ble to magnetic influence.
A banquet followed at the Waldorf-As
toria, attended by 200 guests. This con
cluded the eighteenth annual convention
of the society.
POOLROOMS CLOSED.
Continued Balds Have Their Effect
at Louisville.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 25.-For the
first time in the history of the city the
poolrooms to-day are closed permanently.
For some time a bitter fight has been
waged upon the poolroom interest?,
which resulted in the threo rooms in this
city being raided on Saturday, over 125
men being arrested. These were dis
missed at a preliminary hearing, but as
the Grand Jury had announced its inten
tion to continue raiding them, the pro
prietors came into the criminal court this
morning and stated that they had deter
mined to close their doors permanently.
They said that they surrendered uncondi
tionally. In view of this fact all peml
ing indictments against them have been
dismissed.

TROOPS THAT MAY
BE MUSTERED OUT
No Change in Plans Owing to Threat-
ening Outlook in the
Philippines.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â 1t is said at
the War Department that no change In
plans as to the mustering out of troops
will be made as a result of the threaten
ing outlook in the Philippines.
The Secretary oi War has made some
progress in designating the volunteer
regiments to be mustere^ out, but no
announcement will be made until the list
Is completed. J. Is â¦â¢'Heved, however, that
the list will include the Thirty-first Mich
igan, now at Knoxville; tne Second Ten
nessee, at Columbus. Ga.; the Third Ten
nessee, at Anniston: the Third North
Carolina (c010re..,, at Macon: the Siy'n
Virginia (colored), at Macon, and the
First West Virginia, at Columbus. Ga.
These resrlmpnts would constitute a
good part of the volunteers to be mus
tered out, for the entire number will not
run very high, owing to the purpose to
first muster nut the volunteers at Manila
and reducp the regulars down to the num
ber contemplated by law when the war
closed.

SNAKE RIVER BARS ARE RICH IN GOLD.
TACOMA, Dec. 28. â Extensive placer mining operations are being con
ducted on Snake River, in this State and Idaho, according to ex-City
Clerk Smythe, who has returned from a summer's work there. But
few claims are regularly located, because the gold is found chiefly in small
bars that are soon worked out. The miners then move to other bars of
which many are constantly forming. A majority of bars produce about $500
each. This free mmmc is carried on for hundreds of miles up and down
Snake River, and is open to everybody. Several hundred miners were
engaged this year, making from mere wages U] to $20 a day. The Klondike
rusli caused many Snak^ River miners to leave, but they are now coming
back.
Several big placer mines are located on the banks Â«.f 'ie Snake. The
largest of these is the Cariboo mine, in Blngham County, Idaho, owned
by John Thomas & Son of Chicago, who took out $35,000 this season in eight
days. They have twenty-eight miles of ditches and having corralled all
the water in their locality, they control about 10,000 acres of placer ground.
They have 10,000 feet of iron pipe and use eight nozzles. Their gravel runs
from six to twenty feet in depth. They get many $50 nuggets and from
that down to fine gold, which is worth $19 50 an ounce.
BRAVE SPANIARD SLAIN BY CUBAN THUGS.
HAVANA, Dec. Â£B.â This afternoon a Spaniard named Fernandez, a
member of the municipal police, was surrounded by a mob of Cubans
in Bombay street. Cuban and American flags were waved in his face,
his rifle was twisted out of his hands and half a hundred men yelled to
him:
"Shot 'Viva Cuba Libre.' or die."
Fernandez threw v-> his arms as if to assent and then when the mob
had quieted down to hear what he had to say, he cried in clear tones:
"Viva Espana!
Three knives were thrust into him and to-night he is dying.
It is a favorite sport among the Cuban young men to stop in the streets
persons supposed to be pro-Spanish r.nd make them kiss the Cuban flag and
cry "Viva Cuba libre." To-day a fight was started by some Cubans car
rying American and Cuban flags, who declared that thty had been insulted
by Spanish marines. A Cuban drew a pistol and, declaring that he would
defend the American flag, fired. Othei shots followed. According to an
unofficial report a Spanish solodler of the Calarava battalion was killed, a
Spanish marine fatally wounded and at least one other, if not several, hurt.
LIVES SAVED BY A PREACHER'S COOLNESS
PEORIA, 111., Dec. 28.â During the Christmas exercises In the German
Methodist Episcopal Church at Pekin, 111., the large tree laden with
gifts and lighted by hundreds of candles caught fire and blazed up
fiercely. The church was packed to the doors and women screamed and
several fainted. The pastor, Rev. William H. Traeger, commanded the au
dience to be seated. He said the emergency of fire had been provided for
and that there was no danger if every one kept still. Then he gave out
a familiar hymn, directed the organist to play up good and strong and or
dered the choir to sing loud. His cool attitude restored confidence and the
people began to sink back into their seats.
Meanwhile, as the fire roared and crackled, the music grew louder. The
pastor nicked burning emb -a from the tree that alighted upon his hymn
book to the floor and stepped upon them, at the same time singing at
the top of his voice. The fire brigade improvised for service in case of
fire threw a heavy wet tarpaulin over the tree and the fire was stamped
out. Then, despite the fact that the church was filled with smoke, the
exercises proceeded, minus the gifts, but with plenty of music.

INVOKES AID FOR THE
PEACE MOVEMENT
William T. Stead Asks Christ: an En
deavorers to Furt-ier the
Czar's Idea.
BOSTON, Dec. 28.â The United Society
of Christian Endeavor has received the
following 1 message in regard to universal
peace from William T. Stead. London,
for the Christian Endeavorers of the
world:
The year 1899 brings with It a great oppor
tunity. In the last nine years Christian gov
ernments have spent upon armaments for war
a sum far exceeding $5,ft00.000,000. To abate this
gigantic waste of the resources of civilization
the Russian Emperor has summoned all govern
ments to a conference. That conference will
fall unless vigorously supported by demon
strations of enthusiastic approval all ruund
the world. I appeal to thf Christian Endeav
orers to do their part in evoking more enthu
siasm anrl giving it practical shape. Now Is
the time to act. Let each society be con verted
Into a local peace conference. Otherwise the
responsibility for the failure of this great op
portunity may rest on your hands.

POISON SENT IN A PRESENT

Contents of a Eromo Seltzer Bottle
in a Medicine Case Prove to
Have Been a Deadly
Powder.
SiÂ»eclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â Mrs. Kate J.
Adams, a widow of 63, died at 61 West
Eighty-sixth street this afternoon, a
half hour after having taken a dose
supposed to be bromo-seltzer. The
medicine was given to her by her
nephew, Harry Cornish, a well known
athlete and physical director of the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club.
Immediately after the collapse of
Mrs. Adams, Cornish, alarmed at the
effect of the medicine upon her, took a
teaspoonful of it himself. He was un
conscious for more than an hour, and
Dr. E. F. Hitchcock, who was sum
moned, was also rendered ill by tasting
the contents of the bottle, although he
took less than one-eighth of a grain in
the effort to discover the nature of the
poison mixed with the bromo-seltzer.
He was so ill that he was unable to
give either of the other sufferers at
tention, and at his direction Dr. K.
Stiles Potter was sent for.
Dr. Potter gave Mrs. Adams power
ful emetics, but was unable to save
her life. He used a stomach pump on
Mr. Cornish with successful results, al
though for a time his life was de
spaired of. Dr. Hitchcock was able to
assist Dr. Potter after having taken an
emetic, and is in no danger now, al
though it was said at his house to
night he was so weak from the effect
of the poison that he had been obliged
to go to bed.
From the story told by Cornish it
is evident an attempt was made by
some person or persons to poison him.
The bottle of bromo-seltzer was sent
to him at the Knickerbocker Club on
Saturday night in a silver medicine re
ceptacle, which bore the "â¢Tiffany"
mark and the number 810. There was
no name attached to the package, and
Cornish made several efforts to find out
who his generous friend was.
Purely to gratify the curiosity of his
aunt and her daughter, Mrs. Florence
Rogers, to whom he had mentioned the
gift, he took it home with him late
Tuesday night from the club and
showed it to them. They admired it
and this morning when Mrs. Adams
complained of a headache Mrs. Rogeis
thought of the little bottle of bromo
seltzer and went to Cornish's room to
get it. Mrs. Adams was the innocent
victim of some person or persons who
meant to murder Cornish.
If Cornish has any suspicion as to
who sent him the medicine he will not
i make it known. He has placed all the
I facts in the hands of Assistant District
| Attorney John T. Mclntyre, who is his
I personal friend, and at Mclntyre's sug
gestion he refused to see all callers.
Mclntyre made several statements
| about "the case this evening, but in none
j did fee give the slightest intimation of
a clew and his Invariable answer to
questions on this point was that the
' case had not developed sufficiently to
', warrant making public any suspicions
: that might be entertained.
Cornish is divorced from his wife,
j who is said to live in Boston. Cornish'g
| parents live in Hartford, Conn. They
i declare they know of no one who would
be interested in causing their son's
' death.
In many ways the case is similar to
the Botkin-Dunning case, which is
being tried in San Francisco. Mr. Mc-
Intyre and District Attorney Gardiner
both said to-night that they had no
doubt the methods used in that case
had suggested the method adopted by
whoever sent the poison to Cornish.
Just what the mixed with the
bromo-seltzer was is still a matter of
conjecture. Doctors Hitchcock. Pot
ter and Coroner's Physician Watson
agree it was either cyanide of potas
sium or strychnine. Its instantaneous
effect on those who took it led the
physicians to believe at first that it
was prussic acid, but after a careful
examination it was decided there was
none of that poison in the bottle. The
bromo-seltzer and the poison it con
tained are now in the hands of Chemist
Lederle of the Health Department and
It will be known definitely to-morrow
just what the poison is.

LAUNCHING THE LIFE-BOAT.
There are greater dangers than those of
the angry sea. That dread disease
sumption, kills more men and women in a
generation tha-* the sea has swallowed up
since the earliest history of navigation.
There is a sure and safe life-boat ever
ready to be launched for men and women
who suffer from this merciless destroyer.
It is Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discov-
ery. It cures 98 per cent, of all cases of
consumption, bronchitis, asthma, laryn-
gitis, weak lungs, spitting of blood and
throat and nasal troubles. It acts directly
on the lungs, driving out all impurities an
disease germs. It soothes and heals the
mucous membranes of the lungs, bronchial
tubes, throat and nasal cavities. It restores
the lost appetite, makes digestion and as-
similation perfect, invigorates the liver,
and purifies and enriches the blood. It
fills the blood with the life-giving elements
of the food that build new and healthy
tissues. It tears down, carries off and
excretes the diseased and half dead tissues
upon which the germs of consumption
thrive. It checks the cough and facilitates
expectoration until the lungs are thor-
oughly cleared. It is the great blood-
maker and flesh-builder. Unlike cod liver
oil, it does not build flabby flesh, but the
firm, muscular tissues of health. It does
not make corpulent people more corpulent.
Thousands have testified to their cure
under this great medicine after they were
given up by the doctors, and all hope was
gone. An honest dealer will not suggest
some inferior substitute for the sake of a
little extra selfish profit.
rA man or woman who neglects
constipation buffers from slow
poisoning. Dr. Pierces Pleasant
Pellets cure constipation. One
little "Pellet" is a gentle laxa-
tive, and two a mild cathartic.
All medicine dealers sell them.
No other pills are "just as good."
Out of the Race!
It is a dismal thin,? to be dropping: out of the
race of lifeâ to stand aside helpless while others
aro crowding to victory â to be gloomy where
others are cheerful and gay â to hunger where
others are feasting â to have no part or reli.-h in
the life-blessings that were intended for all.
This break-down in simply a result of Nerve
Starvation, and is accompanied or will soon
be followed by other symptoms by headaches,
Irritability, languor, stomach and intestinal
troubles, and general debility and prostration
of the syÃtem. If you want to be in the race
again, you MUST FKEIJ YOUR NERVES.
There is no other way consistent with natural
law. If the nervo mechanism be made right the
whole human machine will resume Its powers
â nd functions. Happily our latest science has
found a way to do this. There is a pure and
perfect nerve-food embodied in

THE CEMETERY QUESTION.
AT Tuesday's meeting of the Board of Super
visors the ordinance fixing January I, 1902, as
the date on which further interments shall
cease in San Francisco was placed on its final passage
and defeated. Devany, Sheehan, Dodge and Clinton
voted to pass it: Haskins. Morton, Britt, Smith and
Rivers voted against it, while Lackmann and Rottanzi
visited the lobby and dodged. No reasons were as
s:gncd for the action of the individual members. Ac
cording to all accounts there was no debate, and the
order failed because the Supervisors had private rea
sons in each case for voting against it.
However, the promoters of this movement need not
despair at the result of their efforts so far. They
have called public attention to the subject in a man
ner that cannot fail to bear fruit in the future. Four
Nipervisors in a board full of dodgers, politicians,
trimmers and boodlers have put themselves on record
as being in favor of the reform, and this, too, at a
period when all public measures usually go by the
board, namely, the last hours of the legislature.
The people of Richmond and its vicinity have every
reason to feel encouraged at the prospect. What they
should now do is to prepare for a movement in force
upon the new Board of Supervisors. To that body
ilie subject will be frcMi and interesting, and there is
no reason why, with a strong public sentiment be
hind them, they should not succeed in getting
through an ordinance. The actual date of closing is
immaterial. The point is to fix a day on which burials
in these cemeteries shall cease. That accomplished,
the rest will be easy. As soon as the cemetery lot
owners get accustomed to the idea of a change they
a ill cease to oppose the reform.
Eventually, of course, cemetery extension in San
Francisco will have to come to an end. Within ten
years property in the vicinity of Lone Mountain will
be too valuable to justify its use for burial purposes.
Some of it is already a loss to its owners. Therefore,
the only tenable argument that can be brought
against the position taken by the people of Richmond
is that they have begun too soon. On this point,
however, there is much to be said. For one thing,
it cannot be successfully established that the time will
ever come when the cemeteries can be moved more
cheaply or with less difficulty than at present. Since
they must inevitably be movW some time, it would
seem to be good business sense to begin on them at
once.
The people of Richmond should continue their agi
tation. While working for themselves they are also
working for the best interests of the entire city.
WIDBER READY TO GO.
AT last ex-TreaÂ«urer Widber has bowed to the
inevitable instead of longer hiring legal talent
to make faces at it. Seeing that he must go to
the penitentiary, he expresses an anxiety to go soon.
This is not hard to understand when it is considered
that the County Jail presents a paucity of charms to
the discriminating senses, and that time spent there
does not count as part of the period forfeit to the
State.
Widber is still a young man. He can fairly build
hope of a comparatively short stay at San Quentin,
for the deductions for good behavior are generous,
and there is always, for the gross offender, whose
stealings have been of impressive size, the prospect
of pardon. Neither is the future all dark. It may be
that when he shall emerge from confinement his fel
low citizens will want to thrust political honors upon
him. What more probable than that he will be
deemed fitting candidate for the place of boss, and
Jr.ter find that if he desire a toga all he has to do is to
ask for it?
However, an experience in one jail only will hardly
I-lace him on a footing such as Burns now occupies.
Burns, it must be remembered, has been the inmate
of three jails, for three separate crimes, and in two
republics. Widber can only plead that while his va
riety of experiences is more limited, he has done a
longer stretch, and perhaps he will be regarded as
suited to the emergency. '-' .
The Memphis shoplifter sentenced to three years
should sue her attorney. His neglect to establish her
as the possessor of a case of; kleptomania cannot be
excused.
It can hardly be said that the Kansru Legislature
1-s been called in extraordinary sessio. . Any ses
sion of that Legislature is recogni7ed as extraor
dinary.
Colonei Bryan had not been a civilian more than
twenty-four hours before he was under fire, an. ex
perience which six months in the army failed to give
him.
As ardent as he is in support of anti-expansion, it
must pain J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska to find
himself agreeing with Bryan.
In his inability to keep a Cabinet together, Aguin
aldo exhibits the statesmaulike qualities of an Old
World diplomat
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1898.
OUR SEMI-CENTENNIAL.
LAST winter The Call editorially suggested the
holding of a great exposition in this city in
1900-1901 in celebration of the semi-centennial
anniversary of California's admission into the Union.
Acting thereupon a committee on preliminaries was
appointed and organized, and many prominent citi
zens came to the front with their approval of the
project, expressed in interviews published in our
columns. The subject is now renewed by members
of that committee with a spirit indicative of the
growth of determination and set purpose to push the
project, to a conspicuous success.
Pride in personal record and family history is a
manly sentiment which safeguards the good order of
society. Pride in the story of one's State, in the
recollection of its distant beginnings, in the men who
laid its foundations, in the workers who have wrought
to convert its natural resources into wealth, is a high
element in the progress and prosperity of a com
monwealth.
Surely no State more deserves such pride than ours,
and no people are more capable of giving to' it the
most impressive expression.
When, the variety of our resources is considered,
there is no part of the world with such a field of pro
duction to illustrate. Minnesota builds an Alhambra
cf ice, lowa a palace of corn, Illinois a castle of coal,
Pennsylvania one of iron and steel. These illustrate
either an object of novel interest or the great industry
which is the main dependence of the people of those
States. If that industry fail, or that resource cease,
their foundations are disturbed and their people dis
quieted by the agonies of a change to something else
that will support population and commerce.
It is not so with California. Here we can build
palaces of the cereals, of coal, of gold, silver, copper
and quicksilver, dug from our mines; of wine of
many vintages and varieties; of oil ripened in our
olive orchards. We can raise walls of onyx, marble,
granite, sandstone, slate, basalt, soapstone and
asbestos. We can build of the greatest variety of
coniferous woods found in association and growing
from the same soil, in any part of the world, and we
can ornament them with the greatest variety of ve
neering woods found anywhere together. We can
pile up pyramids made of 400 different varieties of
grapes, luscious in many colors, and can fringe and
ornament the structure with the guava. pomegranate,
date, banana, loquat, medlar and the Japanese kaki,
the fruit of the gods. In association with these may
be shown our great commercial deciduous fruits, the
peach in fifty varieties, the apricot, nectarine, cherry,
prunes and plums of so many sorts that they need
a separate catalogue. We can build a miniature city
of twenty varieties of the orange, lemon and lime, the
shaddock, grape fruit and citron, and can scent the
scene with the cinnamon shrub, the camphor tree and
the bay. California licorice and ginger, cotton and
honey, our apples, almonds, walnuts, wine berries, and
bewildering variety ot what field and garden yield,
can be added to show the vast reach and range of our
resources and prove to the world that here is a
laboratory in which* nature enables man's labor to
produce from the soil and from the mine so much of
use in commerce that no man can say which industry
in the future may lead the rest, where so many offer
themselves to the varying tastes and capacities of
man as a means of making a living and supplying the
wants of distant people.
Add to these the foreign production in which we
deal and for which we exchange our surplus, and the
handiwork of our mechanics and shipbuilders, and
the products of the sea, from herrings to whales, and
the mind is almost stunned by the display made pos
sible in this fifty-year-old State. Rightly managed
such an exposition will draw people from all over the
world, and will fix California more firmly than ever
in the attention of the nations.
When political turmoil needs a vacation in the
Legislature this subject should be brought to the at
tention of that body, and along the lines of a definite
plan it should extend such preliminary encourage
ment as is needed, and the mighty project should be

EXPANSION MENACES WHITE LABOR.
ON Monday last The Call invited public atten
tion to the fact that it had been asserted by the
Chronicle that the Philippines would neces
! sarily become a part of the territory of the. United
' States, and the inhabitants "not subjects, but citi-
I zens," and "on an equal footing" with ourselves. As
| a consequence of this status of the Filipinos it was
. pointed out that they would have a constitutional
I right, of which they cauld not be deprived, to travel
| to all parts of the United States, and that the Chinese
; exclusion law would thus be virtually repealed and the
' whole country open to cheap labor.
The Chronicle of Tuesday contained a long
; answer to our brief exposition of the situation, in
; which our legal position is admitted, but its conse-
q uences denied, on the ground that the Filipinos
: will not avail themselves of their right to migrate, but
I will stay at home. This is a practical confession of
the substance of the article to which the comment of
the Chronicle is directed, and an illustration of the
numerous inconsistencies with which the expansion-
S ists are confronted. "They can migrate, but they
j won't," is the pith of the argument. The main con
tention being thus conceded, the prediction will have
but little weight with citizens who realize that where
: cheap labor is wanted and cannot be lawfully ex
.; eluded it will be speedily obtained. Capital has
never yet failed to provide for the transportation of
: laborers when the national bars were let down.
It is said that the Mexican peons do not cross the
! boundary line and invade the United States. In the
! first place it is not true that "the peons are the same
I kind of people as the Filipinos." But, in the second
j place. Mexico is not a part of the United States, and
therefore the attempted analogy is absolutely false.
jlf Mexico were conquered and annexed, then the
' question of the peons would come to the front.
The proposition that there has been no "inrush of
Chinese. and Japanese from Hawaii" is equally un
sound. The number of the Asiatics there is limited,
and Hawaii lias not yet received a territorial organi
zation, and, therefore, it has not passed under those
guarantees of civil rights applicable to territories,
which are permanently secured by positive law. When
the work of the late commission has resulted in legis
lation and the: new territory is finally organized, and
not before, there will be an opportunity to determine
whether the Chinese and the Japanese will avail them
selves of their right to migrate to other parts of the
Union.
It has been repeatedly shown that there are more
inhabitants to the square mile in the Philippines than
in the United States. If, with our comparatively
limited population and with our enormous wealth, ac
cumulated under the constitution, we need outlets so
badly' that to secure them even the destruction of our
form of government can be condoned, how much
greater reciprocity of advantage would the Filipinos
gain in their new capacity of "fellow citizens!"
But the Chronicle doubts the sincerity of The Call
and betrays its old infatuation for "sugar." Its di
version among the canes, however, in search of the
sweetness which is so agreeable to the palate, does
not meet the plain truth that its attitude on the ques
tion of the acquisition and government of the Philip
pines is false to protection, which is a method of
keeping up wages, and false to the laborers and me
chanics of the country, who are unwilling to have
Chinese, Malays, and all the other elements of the
dense population of the Philippines enrolled as com
petitors among their "fellow citizens," with polygamy
and paganism as social and religious institutions.
This is an American and not an Asiatic republic,
which has not so far been deprived of its constitution
and converted into an empire, nor made subordinate
to the colonization policy of Great Britain. The de
vices of the speculators who are willing to subvert
their own government and to ruin their own country
in order to drain the pockets of nine or ten millions
of Asiatic pagans and polygamists have not yet quite
succeeded, and the flag still waves "o'er the land of
the free and the home of the brave."
THE DEATH OF SENATOR MORRILL.
SENATOR MORRILL'S death will not strike
the country with such a sense of loss as would
have been felt had it occurred when he was in
the prime and vigor of his life. He had lived far be
yond the ordinary period of human life, and doubtless
seemed to many younger men to be a veteran lagging
superfluous on the stage. Under such circumstances
his death does not come as a shock. He has passed
away full of years and honors, his lifework fully com
pleted, leaving behind a memory which will long be
cherished by the people he served.
Notwithstanding his great age, however, the death
of Senator Morrill is a distinct loss to the nation at
this juncture. He was one of the conservative and
constructive statesmen of the Senate. His political
sagacity and wisdom had ripened with his years, and
to the last showed no signs of decay. Such men are
always needed under all forms of government, and
they are particularly needed at this time in the United
States, when so many radical innovations from fiat
money to imperial extension are threatening the wel
fare of the nation and have so much support in Con-
It was the fortune of Senator Morrill to act a con
spicuous and important part in the great epoch of our
history which transformed a Federal Union of more
or less discordant States into a true nation; a period,
moreover, marked by such progress that the popu
lation increased from 28,000,000 to upward of 70,000,
000, and the wealth and industries of the people ex
panded to a magnitude that was never dreamed of at
the time he entered public service.
During his career he was an able leader and a wise
counselor in the settlement of all the complex is
sues of the war or growing out of it. His main work,
however, was along the lines of financial and tariff
legislation. On all questions of that kind he was one
of the most learned experts in Congress and spoke
with authority. His influence was potent in uphold
ing sound principles of finance, and it is in this re
spect he will be most missed, for the currency prob
lem remains to be solved, and his continued presence
h< the Senate would have conduced strongly toward
a rightful and sagacious conclusion of the issue.
A great and good and wise statesman has been
taken from the council of the nation, and Vermont
will find it difficult to replace him with an equally
worthy successor. The country, however, remember
ing past services, will not be forgetful of his
teach. .ig, and his influence will remain for many years
in the Senate as a conservative and patriotic force. He
is, therefore, not wholly lost to the nation he so ar
dently loved, so devotedly served, and from his tomb
he still directs the people into the safe paths of peace
and prosperity.
BOTKINESE EMOTION.
A CONTEMPORARY has taken to portraying
for the edification of its readers daily the emo
tions which surge through the bosom of the
Botkin woman when witnesses make remarks per
sonal to herself. Without the least desire to discour
age enterprise or handicap a harmless form of lunacy,
we are bound to say that the information is not
valuable. Botkinese emotions do not concern the
public. In fact, it is callous to them. Its desire is
to learn whether the woman is guilty of murder, and
this is not to be ascertained through conning any
vapid comment of her own.
Tuesday there was on the stand a woman who is re
puted to have stolen from the prisoner the valuable
affections of the male Botkin, and the prisoner freely
expressed distaste for the person, presence and gen
eral tone of the lady. All this the contemporary sets
forth at considerable length. Well, who cares?
There is more than a suspicion that the plump Mrs.
Botkin has done some stealing of a similar sort. If
her family was invaded, so was the Dunning family.
If another had borne away as a prize the love of Bot
kin, she swiped that of Dunning, such as it was, and
dishonors would seem to be easy.
The prisoner talks too much. She does not seem
to realize it, but every display she makes of her tem
i perament increases the prejudice against her. If she
lack the judgment to keep her mouth shut she should
hire one more lawyer to give her advice on this point
alone.
South Dakota cattlemen killed a sheep herder, were
acquitted on the ground of self-defense, and then pre
sented the widow with $1000 in gold. It is impossible
to judge whether this was considered by her as suffi
i cicnt recompense, but in some instances it would have
been a palpable excess.
Merchants are right in their opposition to the
hideous signboard surmounting a one-story building
at Bush and Kearny. The building, even stripped of
the lumber monstrosity, would be bad enough to keep
down the price of realty.
As there are fifty-nine prisoners in the Kansas peni
tentiary under sentence of death, and as a bill is to be
introduced forcing the Governor to sign the death
warrants of all, it may be judged that there is a flutter
along murderers' row.
For the offense of being a "badger" a New York
criminal has been sentenced to nineteen years, but
as to his female accomplice, the jury disagreed, a cir
cumstance demonstrating the utility of having a
pretty face.
The saloon-keeper who sold whisky to three boys,
the liquor nearly killing one of them, deserves to be
deprived of his license and put in a place where a
license would be useless to him if he had it.
The San Qnentin guard who followed the injunc
tion, "Search the Scriptures," and found them packed
with opium, didn't do much to forward missionary
work at the penitentiary.
The actress whose sealskin was torn to rags by a
rival seems too displeased to be grateful for the fact
that she was not inside the garment at the time.
There is something to ponder over in the fact that
Jockey Sloan has a bigger income than the President
of the United States.
PASSING OF THE PEOPLE'S PARTY.
Thomas I Cator Writes Its Valedictory and Tells Why He
and Others Have Returned to the Re
publican Fold.
To the Editor of The Call: So many
of those who have been voiing with the
People's party, but who at the last
election, with myself, supported the Re
publican ticket, have asked me whether
I intended to take steps to reorganize
the party, that I deem it best to an
swer all such inquiries at once through
your columns. That party was com
posed of men previously identified with
other political parties. The attempt in
1898 to finally annex it permanently to
the Democratic party was equivalent to
dissolution and fully warranted all who
like myself were former Republicans
in returning to and renewing their al
legiance to the Republican party. It is
apparent that the main support of the
People's party came from those who
thought free coinage of silver at the
ratio of sixteen to one a desirable
policy. A re-examination of this matter
has led me with many others to modi
fied views upon the subject. The chair
man of the Omaha convention, Hon. H.
D. Loucks, has returned to the Repub
lican party. Statesmen, jurists, and
even scientists, find it necessary to re
vise or reverse their former opinions.
To abandon error when it is seen is a
virtue, a duty. To adhere to it is a
T. V. CATOR.
vice and a lack of true murage. Mr.
Bryan says that the fundamental or
scientific basis of independent free coin
age at sixteen to one consists in giving
to the debtor the option to pay debts in
either coin; that if he have this op
tion he will pay in the cheaper mer.a!,
and by thus increasing the demand
raise the price and draw the value of
the metals together, and ktep them at
a parity; but if the creditor have the
option to demand the payment in gold
this, by increasing the demand, draws
the value of the metals apart. This
proposition has not been proven to be
sot.nd, but it does not require discus
sion here, for we find Mr. Bryan, in
his celebrated Chicago convention
speech, stating that it is not the pur
pose of the free silver advocates to pay
gold debts in silver. Right here we
have a paradox. There are several
thousand millions of private debts in
the United States, written payable
specifically in gold. If these debts are
not payable in silver (and it is admitted
they are not) then it is impossible that
the debtor as to this enormous indebt
edness should have the option. The op
tion remains with the creditor and
upon Mr. Bryan's own statement or die
trine this must draw the metals apart,
send gold to a premium and thereby
j suspend its circulation and place us at
I once upon a silver basis and contract
i the currency by the amount of gold in
use. The country has decided against
free coinage of silver and has justified
the position taken by the National Re
publican party upon the question of
coinage. Free silver men frequently
! urge that gold and silver are equally
; recognized as money by the constitu
! tion. A limited amount of silver can
: be used as money at the present ratio
without driving out gold, but no coun
try where there is independent and un
limited free coinage of silver is able to
maintain gold in circulation as money.
Such countries have silver monometal
i lism. This would be the case in the
! United States. The conclusion is ir-
I resistible that the cause which pro
duces this must operate alike in all
countries regardless of their volume of
commerce As such free coinage would
therefore drive out gold the constitu
tion, in recognizing gold and .silver,
must have contemplated the use of sil
ver in a manner whicli would keep gold
in circulation as money and experience
has shown that this can only be done
when gold is the standard.
l'l>i>n the question of maintaining the
national banks of issue the Democratic
party is seriously divided, but those
who favor abolishing such banks a3
banks of issue favor a return to the
system of issuing currency by State
banks. The Chicago platform of 1596
was upon request of Mr. Bailey of
Texas purposely modified in committee
so as to permit this construction and
I the Democratic Legislature of Georgia
' has recently authorized the issue of
' currency by State banks and directed a
j test of the national tax which prevents
I such issue. This is a retrograde policy.
As between the Republican policy fa
voring national banks of issue and such
Democratic policy the Republican poli
!cy should be supported. As to issues
iof additional greenbacks redeemable
upon demand, such a policy must con
template a suspension of specie pay
ments or a perpetual increase in bonds
! issued to obtain means for redemption.
We have had abundant opportunity to
observe tha. such legal tender notes
which any holder may present to the
treasury at once for redemption con
stitute an endless chain which com
pels the Government upon occasions to
constant iesue of bonds and purchases
of gold to keep the pledge of redemp
tion. This is bound to occur as often
as there is the least suspicion that such
legal tenders may not be equivalent to
j gold. There can be no doubt that the
I legal tender notes have for a long time
! been maintained at a parity with gold
j only by the policy of the treasury to
i pay gold for legal tenders upon de
j mand therefor. This action of the treas
ury is warranted by the express policy
of the law as declared in the act of
1893 to maintain the parity between
gold and silver and it is not apparent
â  how this policy can be safely changed
j while such legal tenders remain out
! standing and subject to such redemp
tion. As to such other schemes for the
j issue of money as do not contemplate
\ coin redemption they could not be law
fully adopted without an amendment to
the Federal constitution. The legal ten
â  der cases at utmost have only decided
! that when the Government issues its
promise to pay in coin it may impress
i legal tender quality upon such a prom
i ise. Such system of money cannot he
i adapted to the competitive system, of
industry and commerce. The system
of money based upon a fixed standard
of redemption accepted by com::
is logically adapted to the estab:
system of industry. The present order
of industry and its means of exchange
have grown and developed together for
centuries and have reached their pres
ent position by the consensus of the
commerce and industry of the leading
nations of the world, and are so adapt
ed and cemented together that they
cannot be separated without revolu
tion in the order of industry. It is for
this reason that the gold standard is
an accomplished fact. The movement
for free coinage of silver and new sys
tems of money grew out of failing
prices and the increase of the unem
ployed. Now a more careful examina
tion of this matter has led me to con
clude that the money question la
the important factor in such results,
but that falling prices and displace
ment of labor are to be attributed al
most entirely to improved methods cf
production and distribution, of pro
ducts, and this brings me to consider
the question of production by corpora
tions or associations employing im
mense capital.
The managers of the Democratic
party are dropping the silver issue, and
iiuw propose to pretend to the people
that the Republican party is respons.
ble for the fact that business enter
prises whi^ch employ large capital can
produce and distribute products more
cheaply than can bÂ« done by concerns
with small capital, and that the Demo
cratic party will reverse this matter.
This claim is wholly unfounded. The
Democratic managers call these busi
ness associations "trusts." As a mat
ter of fact, most of them are simply a
single corporation with large capital.
Where separate concerns agree tv act
in restraint of trade they can be en
joined, and the Republican party has
been active in making and enforcing
laws to this effect, like the Sherman
law, under which some great combina
tions have been dissolved, but this can
not prevent the same persons from con
solidating their capital and business in
one corporation or partnership to do tho
very same thing, and for this reason
most so-called "trusts" are no longer
such, but are in lawful form, and :tll
may easily assume the lawful form;
nor is there any method by which men
can be prevented from so doing unless
it be proposed to enact laws absolute
ly forbidding individuals from engag
ing more than a small amount of capi
tal in any given business or enterprise.
This would be retrogression, and th<Â»
p^'sical destruction of all great enter*
prises; it would be industrial and com
mercial anarchy. The Republican party
is not responsible for the development
of those so-called "trusts." It has done
all that statute law can do in the mat
ter. It might as well be said that
party was responsible for a department
store; or for the fact that a man, o*
men, who purchased 10,000 acres or land
and by the use of steam plows, com
bined harvesters and large capital can
produce wheat more cheaply than a
farmer without capital or improved
machinery can produce it on a small
farm. The fact is, that great capital
by producing practically the entire out
put of a product can utilize land, labor,
machinery, material and distribution so
as to undersell any small producer, and
this inevitably leads to such combina
tion. This is clearly not the result of
any statute law. or any party policy.
It is the natural evolution of industry
and the course it thus takes under in
dustrial law has been long seen and
predicted by great thinkers of the
world. It is apparent from this that
the proposed declaration of the Demo
cratic managers against so-called
"trusts," or combined capital in pro
duction and distribution, is to be a
mere empty political harangue, an
other effort at a new and false issue.
It often happens that persons of a
generous nature believe that the hard
ships of life that so many undergo can
be easily remedied, and under this im
pulse it is easy to mistake the mani
fold causes of a condition and to seek
to apply a false remedy and to arraign
conservative organizations as the causa
and protector of existing evils. But it
is not easy to find remedies for these
things. Notwithstanding the excellence
of natural law, nature presents many
enormous evils, or things that so ap
pear. The best efforts of labor ares
at times destroyed by floods, droughts,
hurricanes, blizzards, frosts, disease of
herds and destructive pests. Famines
ravish nations and valuable cargoes are
Phi-wrecked by the elements. We see
nnd lament these things, but who can
suggest the remedy?
If we observe in the evolution of so
ciety and industry a natural law so
operating that great capital by produc
ing more cheaply than small capital
advances to the entire control of a
given line of business it is unjust to
charge any political party or class of
men with "this result. It is not true
therefore that the Republican party is
the friend of syndicates or combined
capital in any sense save that it de
clines to promise that which no party
can perform, or to attempt to move
against the laws of industrial evolution
and by false remedies produce reac
tion and enormous injury without ac
complishing any good whatever. It is
not certain that this evolution of in
dustry is unfortunate. Evolution is
scientific. Science is true, hence the
evolution of industry cannot be bad in
a universal view. It must not be for
gotten that good frequently evolves
through things apparently evil. In
progress along the line of -natural law
apparent evils find their own remedy.
One thing is certain, repression of evo
lution is no remedy, but is an impossi
bility. But it is claimed by Democrats
that free trade will prevent these vast
enterprises. This claim is without
merit. These so-called trusts exist in
England. Free trade will permit for
eigners to seil goods in our markets
made by cheaper labor, at less than
cost of production here, and this could
destroy these large industries or reduce
the wages of labor, but it could not put
concerns with small capital upon their
feet again, for these have already been
displaced by the fact that combined
capital produces more cheaply than
they could. How then shall they exist
under free trade in the still cheaper
production from other countries? The
Republican party has elevated to the
Presidency men who have sprung from
the ranks of labor and many of these
have commanded a world-wide admira
tion for wise statesmanship. It is a
party of progress and within its ranks
there is liberty of thought and expres
sion. Manifestly when its highest coun
cils have spoken its policy for the time
is defined and its members acquiesced
Its platform pledges can be realized
because impossible matters are not
promised and the party is not rendered
impotent by fatal division. Great
questions are pressing for solution
which require ability, patriotism, cour
age and patience. That the country
must look to the Republican party to
solve these questions in their proper
order seems beyond doubt. That party
is not lacking in sympathy for poorly
paid toilers or the worthy unemployed.
The masses which compose the party,
including the wealthiest in its ranks
are full of compassion for all suffering
or injustice, and while properly declin
ing to arouse false hope or to attempt
dangerous impracticable remedies, they
are willing and desirous that the very
best possible conditions may be reached
and to this end I believe they are ever
ADVEBTISEMENTS.
Lady Londonderry
Has had quite a reception in
Pattosien's great two-acre store
the past weekâ and you wouldn't
think it! Yes; Lady Londonderry's
"Rory O'More" Rockers have
taken this town by storm, and
indeed the State by storm, for
that matter, for the wholesale
orders are coming in so fast that
it keeps the shipping clerks busy
all the time on "Rory O'Mores."
And why it is hard to see. The
"Rory" Rocker is in mahogany
or golden oak finish, trimmed or
plainâ that's all. The price runs
from $1.50 to $9.50; several de-
signs, to be sure; but Pattosien's
don't boast of it. They have
rockers just as good, but nobody
wants anything for 51.50 but a
"Rory O'More." The company
is sorry they ever mentioned it,
though, because it cost consider-
able money to get the beautiful de-
signs of Lady Londonderry. Now,
to think it over, they find that the
"Rory O'More" Rockers are
standing in the way of all the
other rockers of high class, but of
course not of the same unique and
correct design, for be it known
that the "Rory O'More" is the
most reposeful rocker ever human
form fell into.
The Pattosien Company directs
very particular attention this
week to their stock of Carpets â

The more I have studied society the

the managers of vast enterprises are
more worshipers of money. They man
age their industries upon the same
principle adopted by every man who
does any business. They seek to ob
tain a good profit. Every man v/ho

is not a matter of choice with an em

It is against our policy to acquire ter

- Gunst will here be told. Those
w ho read cannot fail to believe, and if
discredit attaches to the gentlemen
whose names have been mentioned
\ they have only themselves to
blame.
In brief, the situation, is that (Jov
ernor-elect Gage has undertaken, at the
request of Colonel Burns, to continue
Mr. Gunst, Burns" gambling partner, in
offloe. To do this he has found it neces
sary to disregard the provisions of the
law and the dictates of common cour
by fixing the date of his inaugura
tion for January 4. thus shortening
â¢-rnor Budd's term by six days. Mr.
<iunst's term of office as Police Com
missioner expires January 5. Gov
ernor r.udd has declined to reappoint
him. Governor Budd's term of office
expires January 11. Thus tt becomes
necessary for Governor-elect Gage, In
order to carry out his promise to Dan
Burns, to resort to measures that may
be considered somewhat questionable
from the standpoint of law and good
taste. The manner In which he has
about the task is partly made
plain in the following statement made
y.'sterday by Governor Budd at the
Palace Hotel. The Governor at first
declined to discuss the subject, but
when pressed for an answer he said:
"'A few days ago I received a message
from Mr. Gage, through my private
â¢aiy. Mr. Gape wanted to know
if I intended to appoint a successor to
â¢ Commissioner Gunst."
ntinuing, Mr. Gage said: 'Colonel
Burns has been very kind to me, and
1 feel that I am under obligations to
him. He wants Gunst to continue in
office, and now that I am in a position
indie this matter for him I feel that
1 ought to do it. I am in no hurry to be
inaugurated, and would prefer to let
matters take their i ual course, but if
it becomes necessary I can be inaugur
ated in time to handle this appoint
ment. Unless I get the proper assur
ances I feel that I ought to take such
trse as will prevent any mistakes.'
"I sint Mr. Gage a reply, assuring
him that I would take the matter un
.l'lvisement."'
"'Have you ever been solicited by any
one concerning this appointment?" was
asked.
"By no one except Mr. Gage and
Mr. Gunst himself. Mr. Gunst came to
me some time ago and said that he de
eired to be reappointed. I gave him
no definite reply, but he may have
gathered from what I did say that I
was not favorable to his reappoint
ment.
"Mr. Gage called on me on Tuesday
and announced that he had fixed the
date of his inauguration for January 4
at the request of the executive com
mittee of the Republican State Central
Committee. I presumed that ended the
r, and so expressed myself. I
was sogiewhat surprised to read in the
: s this morning a number of inter
with members of the executive
, ittee in which they state that
there has been no meeting of the ex
ecutive committee since the election,
and that the matter of the date of Mr.
s inauguration has not been dis
( ussfd by its members.
"This is the first time in the history
of the State where a Governor's term
of office has been shortened to less than
f..ur yean. Governor Markham was
inaugurated on January 8, 1891. My
inauguration occurred <>n January 11,
and on January 11. ISW. I will have
held office four years. The appointment
of a Police Commissioner for San Fran
cisco is the only appointment of any
importance that will occupy the oon-
Btderatloo or demand the attention of
the Governor of this State between
January 3, 1899, and January 11, 1899."
Some days ago The Call obtained the
information that Governor-elect Ga?e
had srnfc a message to Governor Budd
announcing his intention to reappoint
Police <'<immissioner Gunst. Acting on
this information John D. Bpreckela hold
â a. conference with Mr. Gage. \Vhat oc
curred at that conference and the pur
tor which it was held is set forth
In th' 1 following statement made by Mr.
>ls yesterday:
When Mr. Gage and I met I
broached the subject of the appoint-
of a Police Commissioner for San
co for the purpose of learning
what action he intended to take regard
ing t: reappaintntt&t of Mr. Gunat. I
was deairoua of preventing him making
th" same mistake made by Governor
liarkham when he nppointed Gunst ami
which r- suited in the holding of mass
meetings in this city at which promi
nent citizens denounced the appoint
ment as a disgrace put upon the city.
"Mr. <;age evaded the point and de
clared that he had not yet given the
matter serious consideration. I rhen
v Id him that I wished him to appoint
tlfl to the position. I did this for no
other reason than a desire to force him
to say, if such had been the case, that
he could not do so because he had al
ready promised the place to Mr. Gunst.
Instead of doing. this he asked me why
I did not seek the appointment at the
hands of Governor IJudd. I replied thit
being a Republican I would not aeek
an appointment at the hands of a
I x-mocratic Governor.
"Mr. Gagre then said that he felt him
self to be under heavy obligations to
me, but that he would be forced to live
up to a rule he had adopted of declin
ing to make any promises in advance
of his inauguration. I saw that noth
ing would induce him to disclose his
Intentions regarding the reappointment
of Mr. Gunst, so I let the matter
drop."
The meeting between Governor Budd
and Governor-elect Gage at the Pal
ace Hotel on Tuesday was prearranged
by appointment. When Mr. Gage went
to the hotel to keep the appointment
he went upstairs, but instead of going
direct to Governor Budd's apartments
he went into a private room in another
part of the building, where he was soon
closeted with Colonel Burns. The con
ference was strictly executive and last
ed almost an hour. When it was final
ly brought to a close Mr. Gage visited
Governor Budd and made the surpris
ing announcement that he had been in
structed by the executive committee
of the Republican State Central Com
mittee to fix upon January 4 as the
date of his inauguration.
In order to bring about the inaugu
ration of Governor-elect Gage on Jan
uary 4 the preliminary business of the
Legislature will have to be rushed
through with such haste that many im
portant matters will be neglected. The
Legislature will convene on January 2
and permanent organization will not be
perfected until January 3. After per
manent organization has been effected
a committee from each house of the
Legislature will wait upon Governor
Budd and formally notify him that the
Legislature is in session and ready to
proceed with the transaction of busi
ness. The Governor will then tranbmit
his message to the Legislature and af
ter it has been read both houses will
adjourn for the day. On the following
day, January 4, the vote for Governor
and Lieutenant Governor will be can
vassed, after which Governor Gage will
be notified of his election. The can
vass of the vote requires considerable
time and it does not now appear how
it can be accomplished in time to al
low for the inauguration ceremonies
on the same day. As the matter at
stake is the saving of Mr. Gunst's of
ficial life it may be that decorum will
be thrown to the winds. The spectacle
will no doubt be interesting and in
structive.
Democrats in this city are indignant
j at what they are pleased to call the
j high-handed proceedings of Governor
elect Gage. They point to the fact of
Governor Budd's attitude regarding
the appointment of a member of the
Board of Equalfration to fill the va
cancy caused by the recent death of
Member-elect J. G. Edwards. Although
he possesses the right to make this ap
pointment. Governor Budd, out of a
feeling of delicacy, had declared his in
tention of allowing Governor-elect
Gage to name a Republican to fill the
vacancy. This fact is recalled by the
Democrats, who are now protesting
against what they term the indecent
action of Mr. Gage in anticipating the
lawful date of his inauguration in or
| der to be able to take out of the hands
! of Governor Budd the appointment of a
Police Commissioner for San Fran
cisco, to whom it rightfully belongs.
Those Democrats who were willing to
discuss the subject yesterday declared
that Governor Budd should now assert
his rights and appoint a Democrat to
fill the vacancy caused by the death <;f
the late J. G. Edwards. They say that
Mr. Gage, having seen fit to ignore
ocinmon courtesy as well as the law in
the matter of his inauguration, can
have no fault to find with Governor
Budd If that gentleman seos fit to ap
point a Democrat to a place c-n the
Board of Equalization.
TRIED THEIR GAME
ON THE WRONG MAN
TWO MEN OFFER STOLEN GOODS
TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER.
Believed to Be the Famous Showcase
Thieves and Will Be Held
for Burglary.
Officer \V. J. Smith last night arrested
Roy Allen and Albert Mont for attempt
ing to dispose of stolen goods. It is con
fidently believed by the authorities that
they are the same men who have been
breaking open showcases south of Mar
ket street for the past two months.
The young men were noticed along tho
street attempting to dispose of a gold
bracelet to passers-by, and officer Smith
wntchrd their movements closely. Finally
they met a man named .Marks, who keeps
a jewelry store at T.Yi Fourth street, and
offered him the bracelet at a low figure.
He examined it closely and recognized it
as one which had been Stolen from his
etore a few days ago. li> ;it once gave
the men into tho custody of Officer Smith,
who took them to the Central station,
where they were charged with burglary.
The two men answer the description
exactly of the men wanted by the police
f<>r breaking showcases and robbing
them of their oontents, and several other
charges will be placed against them to
day.

TROPIC BIRD
CAUGHT IN A
SOUTHEASTER
The Chitose Departs
on Her Trial Trip.
TWO VESSELS IN HARD LUCK
REPUBLIC IN AUSTRALIA AND
P. M. SMITH HERE.
Ship Eaton Hall Had Her Decks
Damaged and Boats Swept
Away in a Storm Dur
ing Her Voyage.
The barkentine Tropic Bird arrived from
Tahiti Tuesday night with the French
malls after a long passage of forty days.
She was scheduled to sail again on the
first of the year for Papeete, but as Biie
will have to go on the drydock and be
overhauled she will be late in getting
away. Captain Jackson says that he had
lan exasperating passage until the coast
:of California was reached. It was a suc
cession of light winds and calms through
out, and fifty miles a day came to be
i looked upon as a good run. On December
i 21 and 22, in latitude 34 degrees 5 minutes
i north, longitude 138 degrees 10 minutes
i west, a heavy southeast gale .was run
into. There was a nasty northeast sea
on, and wave after wave broke aboard
the barkentine. Sail was shortened down
to topsails, but before that could be done
the topgallant sail was blown out of the
gasket. Christmas day on the Tropic
i .Bird was spent in latitude 37 degrees 10
minutes north, longitude 130 degrees 20
i minutes west. The sea was as smooth
as glass, and there was not a capful of
i wind. â  .
The only passenger on the Tropic Bird
was H. Hoppenstedt, German Consul at
! Papeete. He Is up here on a business trip.
| The barkentine's cargo consisted of cocoa
: nuts, copra, vanilla and vanilla Deans, and
fifty-five toa logs.
A couple of San Francisco vessels are
- having a hard run of luck. The ship
! Republic is following hers up in Aus
tralian waters, while the river steamer
i F. M. Smith is having hers right here in
! the bay. The Republic went from here to
I Puget Sound and loaded lumber for Aus
! tralia. After leaving port she was caught
j in a heavy storm and had to put in here
iin distress. She was leaking badly and
! had to be thoroughly overhauled be
fore she could proceed. She reached Aus
tralia, and after discharging her lumber
cargo was sold and put under the Chilean
; flag. She then went to Newcastle, N. S.
\V\, and loaded coal for Honolulu, but
soon after putting to sea she sprang a
] leak and had to put back to Sydney. For
i months the underwriters and owners
I have been squabbling over the insurance,
I and yesterday the Merchants' Exchange
! received word that the cargo of coal had
i to be discharged and the vessel dry-
I docked for repairs.
The F. M. Smith was formerly the 11.
C. Grady. She came here from Portland
I and went into the Sacramento River
trade, carrying fruit and vegetables for
the Oakland market. The venture did not
pay, and the vessel was soon plastered
i with libels and tied up. She was sold
by the United States Marshal and pur
chased by F. M. Smith, who fitted her out
for the Klondike trade. When the bot
1 tom fell out of the boom she was put on
' the Alviso run. During one of her runs
: she got caught across the creek, and the
! tide leaving her high and dry, she nearly
! broke her back. In spite of one or two
! other mishaps she was doing well, how
i ever, and was a favorite with the travel
! ing public, but her bad luck had not for
i saken her. Last week while moving from
Washington to Jackson street wharf she
backed into the latter structure and not
only broke her fantail, but cracked the
shaft. She was moved to the south side
1 of the Mail Dock and there beached for
repairs. Yesterday afternoon a tire broke
I out in the galley, and at one time it
j looked as though the steamer was
i doomed. The Fire Department was called
â  out and after some trouble the fire was
I put out.
The British ship Eaton Hall arrived
from Swansea yesterday after a long pas-
I sage of 180 days. During the latter part
! of August the ship ran into a terrific
i storm. The waves broke aboard in such
i a volume that the decks were damaged
I and all the boats were washed away.
Captain Lourison decided to run for Rio
de Janeiro, and arrived there on Septem
ber 3. It took a fortnight to make the
necessary repairs and then the Eaton Hall
! made another start for San Francisco.
The Japanese cruiser ChLtose made an-
I other start for the Santa Barbara chan-
I nel yesterday morning. It is blowing a
gale of wind behind her, so sho
i should make a record run down the coast.
I If all goes well and the gale has blown
itself out. she will probably have her trial
trip to-morrow, but if anything has to be
done to ship or machinery it will be Sat
urday before she has her race against
I time. _^__â â^â â

Twenty-Four Japs Landed.
The National Commissioner of Immi
gration notified Commissioner Hart North
by wire yesterday that the appeal recent
ly taken from his decision in the case of
twemy-four Japanese had been decided
in their favor. The Japs shipped from
Honolulu on the Alice Blanchard under a
two years' labor contract to gather guano
on the Cllpperlnn Islands. At the expira
tion of that period they were to be re
turned to Honolulu. They went to the
islands and worked for a few months un
til the supply of food gave out, and they
were taken to this port and dumped on
Eiecember 16 of this year. Commissioner'
North refused to allow them to land, his
refusal being based on the fact that their
fare had been paid by the corporation em
ploying them, and that they were, there
fore, assisted immigrants under the
meaning of the law.

PAID ALL
POLITICAL
OBLIGATIONS
School Board Jobs Easily Slip
Past Lane's Suit for an
Injunction.
Directors Create Principalships and Stuff
the "Day Unassigned List" With
Useless Teachers From the
Evening Schools.
MARK LANE'S injunction has not
enjoined.
Despite its ironclad prohibi
tions and its ingenious phrasing
the ready wit of the shifty
crew that manipulates the Board
of Education has found a way to evade
its provisions, and the debts, political
and financial, of the past year have been
paid off with interest and with neither let
nor hindrance.
No new teachers have been appointed
for the reason that it was not necessary.
No promotions have been made from the
"extra substitute class" for the simple
reason that no such list exists in the de
partment. Against both these things
Lane's injunction warned the board, but
it said nothing against transfers nor
against the creation of vice principalships
at fat salaries, and of this little oversight
the board took advantage to the extent
of recognizing every request made upon
it from whatever source or upon what
ever consideration. Six vice principal
ships were created and filled and two
that were provided some weeks ago were
assigned to favorites of the gang. Night
school classes were consolidated and the
teachers transferred to the "Day unas
signed list." In fact, the unassigned list
played the biggest part in yesterday's
disgraceful meeting. It was used to put
beyond the reach of the incoming board
favorites of the Directors who might lose
their jobs through the abolition of night
schools. The shaky ones were all consoli
dated out of their positions and stuffed on
the unassigned list, where no such word
as fired is known. From that list they
can be transferred only to the day
schoois, and when that glad day comes it
will mean an increase of from $2 50 to $v
in the monthly stipend and no more night
school work.
President Barrington was not present
when the meeting opened. He had been
there earlier in the afternoon, but his
daughter was lined up for one of the vice
principalships, and the strain was more
than he could stand. To the disgust of the
rest who were "on" he turned up missing
when his vote was wanted. Miss Har
rington, however, got her job. Director
Head was also absent at the roll call,
but he got in shortly after Director Wal
ler, as chairman of the Elementary Com
mittee, had got his report through. It
was Waller's report that started the ball.
It is a self-explanatory document and
needs no foot notes. It recommends as
follows:
That Mrs. J. D. Cooper be transferred from
the Franklin Grammar School to the day un
asslgned list.
That Miss E. F. Baker of the day substi
tute list be elected a probationary teacher and
assigned to Miss Cooper's class In the Frank
lin School.
ThAt Miss McGreevy of the South End School
be transfererd to the day unasstgned lint.
That whereas the three receiving classes of
the Marshall Primary School are In a con
gested condition and contain a surprlus of
puplli far in excess of the rules; therefore, be
it resolved that a new class be formed at said
Marshall Primary and that Miss Mlchener of
the Spring Valley Grammar School be trans
ferred to that class In the Marshall Gram
mar.
That Miss Alice Dunn be transferred from
the Hancock Grammar School to a class in the
South End School.
That Miss McGough, having been transferred
to the 1-incoln School by mistake, be trans
ferred back to the Hancock Grammar School.
That Mrs. Ostram be transferred from a
class In the Horace Mann School to one in
the Crocker.
That Miss I. Roberts be transferred from
the John Swett School to the Horace Mann.
That the following schools, possessing the
proper requirements according to the rules, be
raised to the ranks designated: Everett, from
second to first-class grammar; Denman, from
second to first-class grammar; Fairmount. from
primary to Intermediate grammar; Richmond,
from primary to intermediate grammar:
Halght. from primary to Intermediate gram
mar; Humboldt, from primary to Intermediate
grammar; Hawthorne, from second to first
class primary; Irving Scott, from intermediate
to second-class grammar.
That Miss I>. Cm be transferred from the
Fairmount Intermediate Grammar School to the
day unafslgned list.
That Miss R. Harvey be transferred from
the Crocker to a class in the Fnlrmmint School
and elected vice principal of said Fairmount
Intermediate Grammar School.
That Miss J. B, Hinds be transferred from
the Richmond Intermediate Grammar to a
class in the (Jnoper Primary.
That Miss M. H. Lannlgan be transferred
from Cooper Primary to a class In the Rich
mond Intermediate Grammar School and elected
vice principal of said school.
That Ma F. Harrington be elected a vice
principal of the Everett First Class Grammar
School, In which Khe id now a teacher.
That Miss S. C Farwell be transferred from
the Denman Grammar to the John Swett Gram
mar.
That Mlpb Alice Brees* be transferred from
the John Swett Grammar to the Dudley Stone-
Primary School.
That Ml.Â«s M. R. Carew he transferred from
the Dudley Stone Primary School to the Den
man Grammar School, and elected vice prin
cipal of said Denman Grammar School.
That Miss L. Orr, a teacher of the Halght
Grammar School, lie elected a vice principal of

That M!rs \j. F. Simon, a teacher of the
Hawthorne Intermediate Grammar School, be
elected vice principal of said school.
That whereas, the course of study requires
the teaching of elocution, rhetoric and debate
In the high schools of the department, we re
commend that E. Knowlton, vice and acting
principal of the Lincoln Orammnr School, be
elected n high school teacher and transferred to
snid department of elocution in the high schools
of the department under the direction of the
committee on secondary education.
0 That MHdiFon Bahrork. a regular teacher In
the department. bc> and is hereby elected prln
cliinl of the Lincoln Grammar School, vice E.
Knowlton transferred.
"I move the adoption of my report,"
said Mr. Waller.
"T object." rolled Armor. "It is noth
ing but a scheme to evade that injunction
and stuff this department with teachers,
and I won't sen Waller paying political
debts that way."
Waller insisted, and the injunction was
pulled on him. but, with the aid of Gal
lagher, he proved conclusively that Judge
Belcher's restraining order dealt with
the "extra substitute, list," and that there
was no such list known to the depart
ment. The report got the necessary
votes, including Hammond's, though he
waa for a time afraid. Head got in at
this point, and upon discovering what was
before the house said. "Mr. President, I
want to talk on this report. There are
two or three little jokers in it that this
board ought to know about. Take sec
tion 16, for Instance. It makes Miss Ca
rew vice principal of the Dudley Stoneâ"
Gallagher attempted the rescue of Di
rector Carew, who was in the chair, at
this point, by trying to stop Head from
dealing any further with the Director's
daughter, but Head would not be stopped
nor would Carew have it, but insisted
that he go on with what he had to say.
But Head let Miss Carew alone.
Head also dealt with section 23 and
claimed that ft gave Professor Baneock
the prineipalship of the Lincoln Grammar
School in payment of a political debt
owed him by Dr. Ragan. and he said
that there was no more use of a teacher
of elocution in the high school to which
Know! ton had been appointed to make
room for Babcock than there was for two
Boards of Directors. He finally changed
his vote and gave notice that he would
move for a reconsideration at the next
meeting. He was promptly headed off by
Dr. Ragan. who moved as an amendment
that the question be reconsidered then
and there. After a hard fight the amend
ment carried, and when the question came
up again It was promptly killed.
Dr. Racan then called attention to a
little resolution which he had sent to Sec
retary Walsh's desk. It was calcu
lated" to care for all of the teachers who
were teaching special classes and make
their jobs solid by making them regrular
teachers of the department. The resolu
tion was as follows:
Resolved. That the teachers of special
classes, now In the department and drawing
salaries as such, holding regular certificates,
be, and the same are hereby elected regular
teachers in the department for grades cor
responding to the grades of their certificates,
their assignment to remain as at present.
That in accordance with the resolution the
following special teachers be and they are
hereby elected regular teachers in the de
partment: Mrs. Spencer, stenographer in
Mission High School; Miss Estelle Carpenter,
music; Miss D. Moran. cooking; Miss M.
Coyle, cooking; Miss M. Miel, sewing; Mrs.
J. Cashman, sewing; Mrs. Hattie B. Steele,
stereopticon; Miss Mahan, Spanish; Miss M.
F. Dowling, Spanish; Miss K. Maguire. book
keeping; Miss L. Graham, bookkeeping; Miss
Rae Cohen, bookkeeping.
Then came the report of the Evening
School Committee. It was couched in
most ingenuous terms and was as redo
lent of virtue as a grammar school grad
uate. But it did the business. It put
fifteen Evening School teachers in safe
berths on the day unassigned list and it
robbed the incoming board of its thun
der by consolidating a dozen of the Even
ing School classes. It also offered an op
portunity to get back at Louis de F.
Bartlett for the active fight he has made
in behalf of the teachers who insist upon
being paid their salaries. Mr. Bartlett
was kicked out of his job as an Evening
School teacher and put on the rather
shaky evening substitute list.
The report of the Committee on Even
ing Schools recited that there has dur
ing the last year been a falling off in the
nightly attendance of the evening
schools and ingenuously says that a "ju
dicious, careful consideration of clnsses
should be made at this time." It there
fore recommends:
That a class in Fairmount Evening School
be consolidated and Miss Mary Mangan be ,
transferred to the day school unassigned list.
That the class* taught by Mlbb Carle in the
Franklin Evening School be consolidated and
Miss Carle be transferred to Miss Cohen's class
in the Horace Mann Evening School.
That the class taught by Dr. F. G. Baird in
the Franklin Evening School be consolidated
and Dr. Baird be transferred to the Horace
Mann Evening School.
That the class taught by Miss Taylor in the
Franklin Evening School be consolidated and
Miss Taylor be transferred to the day un
assigned list.
That Miss C. Friedlander be transferred to
the day uÂ»asslgned list from the Hamilton
Evening School.
That the class taught by Miss M. Lowei In
the Hamilton Evening School be consolidated
and Miss Lowel l>e transferred to Miss Fried
lander's class in the Hamilton Evening School.
That Miss Julia Sullivan of the Horace
Mann Evening School be transferred to the
day unassigned list.
That Miss Katherine Lavylor of the Hor
ace Mann Evening School be transferred to the
day unassigned list.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2S.â Contrary to its
course for some weeks the stock market
showed a pronounced decline on the day's
trading and this was opposed to the tendency
abroad. London having bought some 25,000
shares, on balance. The volume of business
â was large, although not up to yesterday's
record-breaking figures. The greater part of
the business to-day was during the morning
rise, while the afternoon's decline was also
accompanied by a burst of animation. There
was no change in the favorable tenor of the
news marketwise, except that the Vanderbilt
reports were not considered up to bullish ex
pectations. The regular dividends were de
clared on Vanderbilt stocks and American To
bacco. Traffic reports were generally gratify
ing. Burlington's surplus for November in
creased nearly $238,000, and the net increase of
Northern Pacific for five months was over
$393,000. While stocks were strong at the
epening New York prices were not up to those
of London, where Americans were buoyant.
International paper, General Electric and some
other Industrials made ne - v high price records.
The Grangers and Coalers were strong. The
advance in the latter stocks, a great part
of which was retained throughout, was per
haps explained by a subsequent announcement
that anthracite prices had bt-wii ordered ad
vanced at Buffalo and Chicago. It became
evident that there had been large realizing
sales on yesterday's and to-day's bulges in
prices and traders attacked the general list
with considerable success. Call money was
advanced to 6 per cent, but subsequently it
eased off to about yesterday's quotations.
Sugar was weak, owing to the trade situation
In the early dealings, when the .rest of the
list was strong and at the close was an ex
ception to the general weakness. Federal
Steel early manifested weakness and late in
the day assumed prominence in the reaction,
offerings being on a large scale.
The bond market was irregular in spots, but
active Issues suffered somewhat In the late
transactions. Total sales, $7,460,000.
I'nited States old 4s coupon advanced 'i in
the bid price.
Total sales of stock to-day 812,700 shares
including: Atchison, 7145; Atchison preferred.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dec. 2S.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were buoyant to-day, par
ticularly In home rails and Americans. Lon
don bought the latter freely. New York took
profits, causing a relapse of 4 to *i of a point,
but the close was very active and the tone
good. There was heavy Continental buying,
but investors were holding off. The favorite
was Norfolk and Western preferred. Union
Pacific was weak. Continuations were stiff, at
54 to 6, closing at 6& to 7. The carry-over
was not completed.
The banks are not letting- out fresh money
and are charging 4*4 per cent and 5 for new
loans, suggesting a ragged account. Copper
shares were strong. One hundred and thirty
thousand pounds gold In bars were bought by
the bank. The price then relapsed to 77s 114 d.

The metal market generally continues to
make long strides In the way of Improvement
In business and prices. The changes noted
to-day were most gratifying to sellers, copper
and tin in particular scoring further gains on
urgent demand and light offerings. News
from the mines was very encouraging and
the general prospect is all that could be de
sired. The London market continues to show
a ready response to change's here. At the close
the Metal Exchange called:

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Dec. 28. â For the first fif
teen or twenty minutes of trading in wheat
It looked as -If the market was in for a wild
day of It. The bull sentiment carried over
from yesterday was augmented by sharp early
advances in the Liverpool and Paris markets,
which caused shorts some, anxiety and drove
hesitating bulls to action. May started at 71@
71V*c, or %@^jc over yesterday's closing price.
But "wise" dealers who had been accumulating
wheat for over two weeks for just such a de
mand pounred in such quantities uf the cereal
that the market broke with a crash,- May be
ing driven back to 70-V3?~04c iinaer the flood
of offerings. Later cables, however, continued
to show strength and early figures indicated a
decrease in the world's visible supply. Before
10:30 the market had quieted down greatly.
Liquidation became insignificant and traders
who still had .faith in higher prices bought
enough to cause a gradual improvement in the
price. The visible Hgures proved a disappoint
ment, showing a moderate increase. In- the last
hour's trading the market again became weak,
liquidation becoming quite heavy, partly under
the influence of a late break in corn. May
broke to 69^. but before the close it rallied
to 70Â»Â»c, and that was the final price, Vie beiuw
yesterday's close.
' Corn was fully as irregular and active as
wheat. Cables were up sharply and this' and
the opening strength of whÂ«at started the
market irregular but strong. But so general
and heavy was the profit-taking that an im
mediate a-nd sharp decline resulted. The mar
ket later became qoleter anil stronger and part
of the decline was recovered. May closed Wit
lower.
There was a fairly large trade in oats, with
the market, much more steady than wheat and
corn. May closed a shade lower.
Trading In provisions u'as very large. The
market in the main followed the trend of
grain, opening strong and higher, but closing
lower and rather weak. Jt was a case of
: profit-taking. At the dose May pork was 15c
lower and lard and ribs 5c lower.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. Dec. 2S.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
wool trade: ' â¢ ".
The last week of the year haa been charac
terized by a good Inquiry for wool and with
fully as good a. feeling as has been noticed for.
months. All eyes are now turned toward the
goods market. All are looking for an im
provement "In the demand for fabrlos, which, if
it develops, will bring a large volume of
business into the wool market in the course of
the next month or two. ' â¢
â¢ The demand for domestic wools during the
past week has run principally to territory.
Texas and pulled wools, while in foreign wools
the chief features have been the sales of some
â round lots of Australian wools. In unwashed
quarter and three-eighths blood wools a fair
movement is also noted: Fleeces., as a rule,
have been quiet.
â¢ â¢ The sales of the week in Boston amount to
â 2 750000 pounds domestic and 1,015,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 3,795.000, against a
total of 6.624.000 for the previous week and a
total of 7,396,000 for the corresponding week last
year Sales since January 1. IS9B. amount to
141,132.510 pounds, against . 369.025, 100 last year
at this time..
REVIEW OF THE WOOL, SITUATION.
BOSTON, Dec. 28.â The Wool and Cotton Re
porter in Its annual review which comprises a
purvey of the wool siuatton In the United
States in IS3B in all its. features, will say to
morrow: . â¢ ' . â  ' .
To briefly summarize, there are 279,319,017
pounds of wool In the United States to-day,
outside of .manufacturers' hands, against 223,
719.29*"' pounds at the close of 1897. The amount
in the three principal markets Is 144,571,446
pounds, apainst 158,754,296 a year ago, and 144,
831,788 two years ago. It will be noted that
while the stocks In the three leading markets
are 14,152.55u pounds smaller than a year ago,
the stocks throughout the entire country' are
56,567,721 pounds larger. Wool has crime for
ward from the West much more (Jowly than
usual. This may be illustrated by the fact
that the receipts of domestic wool at Boston
this year have amounted to only 80,969,000
pound's against 150.916.400 pounds in 1897, a
Jailing off of practically 50 per cent. In fact,
the sales In Boston during 1897 were 15,540,456
pounds larger than the total receipts of both
domesttc and foreign. The sales In Boston
were 141.132,510 pounds, against 361,632,100
pounds in the previous year. The sales in the
three leading markets of the country were 23",
456.355 pounds, against f.27A r >5,375 in 1Â«97. The
sales In 1898 were the smallest so far during
the last decade of the nineteenth century, ex
cept thoee for 1893, which amounted to only
199,504,383. The average weekly sales in the
three leading markets were about 4,500,000
pounds, compared with over 10,000,000 pounds
in 1897.
Nominal quotations on wool were fairly well
maintained during the larger part of the year,
but in the last quarter there was a decline to
a lower level. In which even foreign wools
shared.
At the opening of the year fine and fine
medium territory was. quoted on a clean basis
of GOc, against 42<f?43e at the close of December.

Harrison's circular says: "Since the Moana
left the following cargoes of coal have been
delivered here from Australia, vlx. : Jeanne
d'Arc, ISI9 tons; Cardiganshire. 2045 tons; JuleÃ
Verne, 2175 tons; Cromdale, 2560 tons; total,
5989 tons. Thin makes a total delivery for two
months of 15.650 tons, being an exceptionally
small amount, so that the Colonial fuel now in
yard amounts to but little, and besides all
that can possibly arrive here prior to March
next will not amount to over 17,000 tons. This
will insure full values for the first half of
1899. The total engaged tonnage now en route
and yet to load coal at Newcastle and Sydney
for here foots up about 80,000 tons capacity, in
all thirty-three vessels: some of these will not
arrive here before August next. The latest
cabled freight rates from Newcastle for coal are
lSs to ISs 6d per ton for immediate loading,
and 16s 6<i to 17s for March-April loading.
These appear to be pretty stiff rates, but in
the absence of a seasonable rainfall there is
no reason for any reduction, as this Is a very
poor port to seek for any profitable freight busi
ness for the present. After January 1 the ad
vance of 1 shilling per ton on Newcastle coal
coes Into effect. This advance, combined with
high freights, will establish a delivered price
here, which w(U drive consumers to seek
cheaper fuel."

Drift of Arctic Currents.
Captain W. F. Milne of the Dundee
whaler Eclipse has for many years taken
a deep interest in the question of ocean
currents, and his experiments have fre
quently met with recognition from the
British meteorological authorities. On
the voyage from which he has just re
turned Captain Milne took occasional op
portunlties of throwing overboard sealed
botties containing a note of the latitude
and longitude of the . particular spot,
along with any other information, and re
questing that the tinders should forward
same either to the American or Urltisn
authorities. Nothing has yet been heard
of his half-dozen bottles so consigned to
the deep on the last voyage of the
Eclipse; but it is somewhat curious that,
immediately on Captain Milne's return to
Dundee this week, he should have re
ceived one of a number of messages
thrown overboard by him during his pre
vious cruise.
On October 29, 1597. Captain Milne gave
to the waves a bottle containing the fol
lowing message: "Whaler Eclipse. To
the firider. Please forward this to the
Meteorological Office, London or Wash
ington. Put over in latitude 63 degrees, 22
minutes north, longitude 65 degrees v
minutes west." The Eclipse was then
210 miles to the north and fully more than
that distance to the west of Cape Fare
well. Generally sneaking, she was at the
mouth of Davis Strait. The bottle was
picked up on August 4 by Angus Mc-
Intyre between Barra Lighthouse and
Hueskar Lighthouse, and not far from
Ardmlle Point. Instead of forwarding the
message as requested, Mclntyre, who
lives at Boisdale, South Uist, sent it on to
Captain Milne at Dundee, and the cap
tain Intends forwarding it nimself. The
bottle in which the message 'was con
tained had drifted about lv- miles ere It
found a rocky restinr place on tne shores
of the Hebrides. It had probably been in
the water for nine months and some days,
so that it had been borne along at, as
near as possible, live and a halt miles a
day. Perhaps the bottle might have been
lying where it was found for a consider
able time, but the possibility is that it
was found soon after reaching the islands.
In 1897 Captain Milne had sent to him
from Norway a similar message to that
picked up at Uist. It was thrown over
board from the Eclipse during the home
ward voyage of 1596 at a point as near as
possible half way across the Atlantic.
Then again three years ago another
Eclipse bottle was picked up at Egedes-.
munde, in Disko bay, on the west coast
of Greenland. The curious thing about this
message, however, was that it was
thrown overboard from the whaler when
she was away to the south and east or
Cape Farewell. This bottle must have
been carried in a northwesterly direction
to double the promontory, and then north
erly to reach Disko. Why one bottle con
signed to the water to the west of Cape
Farewell should travel almost, due east,
and ultimately be picked up on the Scotch
coast, and another, thrown overboard to
the southeast of the cape, should seek
its way up the coast of Greenland is a
mystery which only those well versed In
the study of ocean currents may be able
to explain.â Dundee Advertiser.
For His Legs.
When Sir Francis Grant, the portrait
painter, was at his zenith, he had a hunt-
Ing box at Melton. An Inquisitive Scotch
baronet was Invited there for the hunt
ing. Sir Francis had another guest, as It
appeared, on a visit. He was a dull, flat
old man, who took snuff and looked the
other way when the table talk ran on
hounds and horses. The sight of a fox's
brush awoke no enthusiasm. He seemed
to taJce no earthly Interest In anything
but his snuff and his meals. The Scotch
baronet at last could contain no longer
his excited curiosity. "I say, Grant," he
said, "what motive have you In keeping
Mr. X. on a visit? There are so many
good chaps who would like to come down
here just now. My fellow-guest does not
seem to care a farthing for the things
you are so keen on. The smell of a fox's
earth to-day made him quite sick. I find
that he does not know the difference be
tween a thoroughbred and an Irish hunt
er, nor does he look a person to fancy
your potraits." :
"You are puzzled, my dear fellow," ro
turned Sir Francis, "to know why I keep
him here. I brought him down" for his
legs." "For what?" "For his legs. You
see. I am doing a full length of the Duke
of Rutland (the late). He is weak in the
knees and shrunk in the limbs and lazy.
He will not be at the trouble of Pitting for
them, so I have secured X. to sit: his legs
are exactly like the Duke's. The poor
fellow is glad to earn a little money, and
to be out at grass here for a short time."

Field â Imperious Beaten
Out by Hohenlohe.
The air was piercing and frosty at Oak
land yesterday. Everybody moved about'
all muffled up and tempting prices failed
to thaw them out. It was perhaps for
tunate. If the bookmakers could have
stirred up a lively play they would all
have retired millionaires. Guilder was the
lone Winning choice and that gelding was
not a popular one.
Although the card was not possessed of
much class the coast record for one mile
and a quarter, 2:06%, was reduced half a
second by Robert Bonner, a cheap s<Mllng
plater. The latter horse was one of four
starters in the fourth event; for which
Veloz ruled a prime favorite. Veloz was

made all the running and led to within
a lVw \anis of the wire, only to be beat
en a nose by Bonner, piloted by little ilal
Brown. The winner was backed from 12
down to 7 to 1.
Wyoming, second choice in the betting,
with Piggott up, took the opening scram
ble over the Futurity course from a big
band of platers. Cavallo, a 20 to 1 out
was second, a head in front of
Glen Anne. The favorite, Captive, was
fourth.
The fast filly Midlove once more proved
a grievous disappointment. She was au
odds-on choice for the two-year-old event
at mx furioufe's. but could not last it out.

said to a friend yesterday that he had a
lighting feoling, the result of good and
hard training, and that he will make a
Dewey battle by going right at his quarry
from the tap of the gong and hammer
pway until a winner is announced.
"We have had two Australian losers In

think it's tim- to shake the hoodoo, and
I feel that 1 can perform the trick if the
referee will give me a square deal."
Green Is, as ever, confident of success.
He feels strong at his present weight,

not underrate his opponent in the least

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1898.
Friday afternoon at 15? pounds. Creedon
finished his work on Monday and is now
resting at his training station. Judging
by the rapid salo of first class seats with
in the last few days the National Club
will again be favored by a large house.
The preliminaries should prove particu-
clfic Coast will be held, and in April the
preliminary rounds for the middle-weight
and welter championships. In May the
final round? will take place between the
best two men in each class. The winner
in each class will receive a silver belt
valued at JUK), presented by Herman Oel
richs, and also a gold medal valued at
$.% from the Olympic Club. An order for
the belts has already been placed with
Hammersmith & Field. The entries for
the feather-weight championship close on
January 28.
According to the schedule prepared for
the water polo tournament, the Polliwogs
and the Water Dogs should have played
their first game against each other last
night, but the latter team Having had no
larly Interesting, as the fighters who are
becked to appear belong to the graduate
clans of claret drawers and eye painters.
Mcsc La Fontise, the Canadian light
weight pugilist who recently arrived in
this city, will engage in a ten-round argu
rrem with Charles Tye. a clever local
boxer and champion of the Reliance Club
of Oakland. The winner of this bout
will probably meet "Cocker" Tweedlo in
tho latter part of January. Some few bets
have been made on the main event at
even money, but it is thought that Green,
who is a local favorite, will sell on the
long end when the sports will commence
to play favorites.
Green and Creedon and the presidents
of the National Club met last evening and
agreed upon Jack Kitchen of Oakland, as
referee of their fight. Tom Tracey and
Jimmy Rik-y will be In Creedon's corner,
and Bob Me Arthur, Frank Foster and
Patsy Corrigan will look after Green.
practice together It was agreed to make
last night's contest a practice game, and '
to hold the first game of the tournament
between these two teams on some early
date. The Polliwogs, with Hinkel as
cuptain, had (the best of the game, scor
ing four goals to their opponent's two.
The handball try-out will be continued
on Friday night, when Mallon and Duffy
will play against Morton and Eagan. and
Bush and Bowman will try conclusions
with Harrison and James. The try-out
is held to decide which two teams shall
represent the Olympic Club in the tourn- ,
ament to be held In January between rep
resentatives of the Acme, Encinal, Rell
ance and Olympic clubs. Each team rep
resenting a club will play every other j
team (except the one also representing :
its own club) at both Its own and its op
ponents' courts. The schedule will be ar- |
ranged In such a manner that the two
teams of one club shall visit one of the
other clubs on any glvon night, and there
play both teams of the home club, mak
ing four games of 51 points each during
the evening's play. The home club on
this occasion will on a subsequent even- i
ing visit its opponent's club.
It is proposed to hold a ladies' night at
the Olympic Club in February of next
year. An indntir baseball game will be
one of the attractions presented.

on Christmas he presented each with a I

a bank with two dimes already in It, and
the clerk, to more deeply impress on the ;

offered a half-dollar reward to the boy j
who first filled his bank.
These banks were given to the boys
exactly at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
Eight minutes later by the clock one of
the boys, who is known never to have
caved a cent in his life, walked up to the
counter and turned his bank in to the
dumfounded clerk. It was full to the
limit with genuine dimes, and the as

Hardly had this boy left the counter be
fore another rushed breathlessly up with
his bank full; but he was too late. The
clerk forgot to put any qualifications on
the method or manner in which the
money was to be saved.
It turned out that the lucky boy bor
rowed $5 in dimes from the keeper of the

The clerk has calculated that if the boy
could save $5 in eight minutes he would

CONSPIRACY IS
SAID TO HAVE
BEEN HATCHED
Rogers' Attorney Tells
Some History.
LISTENERS WERE SECRETED
DR. DERRICK THREATENED TO
BRING CONTEST.
Should the Case Ever Come to Trial
There Will Certainly Be a
Terw Sensations Ex
*"â ' ploited.
Oakland Â«OfnVe San Francisco Call,
906 Broadway. Dec. 28.
The somewhat 'sensational contest filed
by San Heller against the seating of
Sheriff-elect Rogers has brought out a
secret of the campaign that was suspect
ed, but which i'ould never be proven.
When Heller withdrew a.; an Independent
candidate it was no surprise. Conserva
tive politicians figured that if he could
receive 500 votes in the entire county he
would be lucky. He had gone into the
fight with considerable display and na
turally sought to retire with the loust
poÃsiole chagrin.
After an aUeged discussion between his
friends and the friends of Rogers it was
announced by Mr. Heller personally to the
newspapers that he had withdrawn "in
favor of Mr. Rogrrs." Now it appears,
according to the statement of Rogers' at- ,
torney, that a little conspiracy was form- i
â¢d In which Heller was to be the gainer [
and Rogers the victim. There was the us
ual hiding behiind portieres to lis
ten to momentous conversation, a:,d.
according to Hteller's story and
Attorney Church's explanation. Dr. i
George H. Derrick took the part !
of the mysterious man. Derrick
is frequently heard of in local politics,
having been mentioned for State Sena
tor and for Mayor. H,e was at one time i
State president of the American Protec
tive Association.
Lin S. Church, attorney for Sheriff
elect Rogers, has made the following
statement: "Dr. Derrick wrote to Rogers I
recently reminding him of his alleged '
promise made at their interview and Bta-j
ted that everything had bern taken down
in black and wniie. He further stated. j
that if the promise were not kept he
would be called upon before lie took his '
seat.
"Rogers says he never made any prom
ise to Dr. Derrick thut he would make
Heller a deputy, though he said he had i
agreed with the doctor that it might.be'
a good idea as it might influence a good !
many votes. This was in my presence,
and he called the doctor's attention to
the fact that the purity of election laws
would not permit the promising of a dep- !
utyship.
"I think it is a conspiracy pure and
simple. They have instituted a contest,
but they are too late., as a contest must
be brought within forty days after return ]
day. The Supreme Court has just handed j
down a decision that rÂ«>turn day is the
lirst Monday after election, which in this
case would be the 14th, therefore :the
latest a contest could have been insti
tuted would have been on the IMth of De
cember.
"l>r. Derrick refused to show the state
ment to me, saying it would be shown at
the proper time. He said. also, that lie
fÂ»lt justified in having some one behind
the folding doors to take down the con
versation, as his past experience in such
matters had taught him that it was i.t-st
to have a witness on such occasions.
"1 do not accuse l>r. Derrick of being a
party to this conspiracy, or attempting to
do anything -wrong. 1 am satisfied that
It will be thrown out of court."
The petition for a citation was brought
up In Judge- Ogden'a court to-day, and
District Attornej Snook stated that the I
time within which the citation could be !
Issued had lapsed. This view of- th*- mat
ter was opposed by Attorney Sawyer, on
bfhalf of Heller, and after argument the ;
case was continued until 10 o'clock Fri- |
day morning. .
J. B. Lanktree. who was one of the man
agers of Rogers' campaign, says that the
scheme of Heller is merely u> annoy |
Rogers. He declares that owing to bis
intimate knowledge of Rogers' light he
is positive that the latter never made any '
promise to Heller, but on the contrary ,
fie issued orders that Heller should not]
be given any cards or money to use in j
furthering RogerV campaign, in cam
Buch actions might be misrepresented, i
"Heller used to come to us every few I
days," said Lanktree. "while the cam
paign was on. and ask for a few dollars
to go out In the country with to In Ik up
Rogers. He bothered us so that we shut i
down on him completely. 1 know abso
lutely that promises of positions to a.
number of other deputies were not made
till long after the election, because I was
largeh instrumental in having Rogers
recognize them."
WARM CONTEST OVER
A PRISONER'S LEGACY
T. W. SINCLAIR MAY HAVE A
GUARDIAN: â¢ .
Transferred All His Interest in His
Mother's Estate to Attorney
F. W. Sawyer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Dec. 28.
Some sensational developments are ex
pected In Judge Ellsworth's court next
Tuesday, when the petition of Fred Sin
clair to be appointed guardian of his
brother, Thompson W. Sinclair, aged. 50
years, comes -on for hearing.
It appears that Thompson. Sinclair, who
is at present serving a. "sentence in the
County Jail for ?omÂ« i rival offense, has j
a $700 interest in the estate of his mother J
back in Michigan, and recently he con
veyed all his interest to Attorneys F. W.
Sawyer and J. E. Bennett, -for what rea
son no one seems to know, and, according
to petitioner, without consideration.
Attorney Sawyer appeared before Judge
â¢ Ellsworth to-day and. stated that T. W.
Sinclair had engaged him to protect his ;
interests in the mother's estate and that
simply a contingent fee had been; agreed j
upon. However. Judge Ellsworth desired
to look into the case thoroughly,- and !
hence next Tuesday was fixed Upon as]
ihe day for hearing the brother's peti- '
tion.
The prisoner is a single man, who has'
lon much through spells of incumpetency
brought on by the evil effects of Uqdor,
and his brother now asks that a guar
dian be appointed to protect him in his
expected legacy.
On the other hand. Attorney Sawyer
insinuates that the petitioner Is aiming
to have his brother declared incompetent
and committed to an asylum and also
have control of the legacy.
Among the heirs of. the late Mrs. Sin
clair are the petitioner, the prisoner, also
Dave Sinclair and a sister, and in each
case the Inheritance does not exceed $700,
and they claim there 1b no contest over
the estate nor any controversy that re
quires the attention of an attorney here.

HIS GOOD NAME
MORE VALUABLE
THAN RICHES
Novel Will of Luther
P. Fisher.
â 
AN HONEST MAN'S BEQUESTS
.
1 DIRECTS OLD OUTLAWED DEBTS
TO BE LIQUIDATED.
His Agency to Be Sold to Highest
Bidder and All He Leaves to
Children Is His Good
â ".;..*- ' Name.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
*is Broadway, Dec. 28.
According to the olographlc will of the
late Luther P. Fisher, dated November
13, ISM. and filed far probate this after
noon, all ha leaves his children is his
good Dame Tho will Is a. remarkable
document, and provision is made therein
for the payment of several debts long
since obliterated by the statue of lim
itations. But what seemed uppermost in
testator's mind was a good name. In his
will he writes:
"The words of Solomon, 'A good name
is rather to be chosen than great riches,'
have my hearty indorsement. I have no
doubt my children will be in full accord
with me in this matter and will faithfully
and sacredly carry out my wishes con
cerning them. My good name is all 1
have to leave them, and I want to leave
it untarnished."
Testator then directs that three princi
pal debts of long standing be liquidated.
Fir,st, a debt of $500 due to Henderson
Davison, contracted in 1851, when testator
was a route agent on the San Francisco
Picayune, long since deceased. According
to the will testator has for years tried to
locate Davison, but believes him dead.
Hence Mr. Fisher directs :hat the money
be paid to the Y. M. C. A. of San Fraii
cisco, to be placed in a fund to be known
as the Henderson Davison contribution
fund and to be devoted to- the care and
education of poor boys; but in no event
is the money to be used In liquidating any
of the association's indebtedness.
The Becond debt, another of $500, due to
Jacob Hardy of tli-e island of Kuai of the
Hawaiian group, is to be paid. "This
debt," reads the will, "ought to have
been paid in 18G7." The other debt, also
of $500, in directed to lie paid to the family
of George Tate. living in Alameda.
â¢'TIT-se debts.." recites the will, "were
the result of moral weakness â a strong
anil clear perception of right and wrong
was wanting or not strong enough to
overpower selfishness- which was
stronger.
Testator further dire.cts that his busi
ness-^the well known advertising agency,
with headquarters in San Franciscoâ be
sold to the highest bidder. Hope is ex
pressed that H. \V. Knoll, Mr. Fisher's
associate for years, be the successful
bidder, but no partiality is to be shown
in.' the matter.
â \Villlam A. Fisher, a son, is named as
executor, but he, as well as Lucy B.
Fisher, in a petition fileu to-day, asks
that letters be 'issued to David Hewes.
The estate will just about liquidate the
debts mentioned.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1898.
MERCHANTS
FOR MUTUAL
INSURANCE
Legislators Afraid of
Cinch Bills.
BRETZ SUPPLIES FIGURES
EXCHANGE READY TO PUT UP
FOR EXPENSES.
Some Member of the Alameda Dele- f
gation Is Pledged to Present
the Measure at Sac
ramento.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 28.
Is the mutual insurance bill which has
been passed by the Legislatures and suc
cessively pocketed by Governors Irwin,
Waterman and Markham a cinch bill, or
is it a measure that can be introduced
with propriety and free from all taint of
suspicion?
This is the question that is worrying
the Alameda County legislators. The
bill has been argued many times at Sac
ramento and has received the support of
both houses, but it has always failed to
meet with the favor of the executive. It
is the one measure that President Arper
and the directors of the Merchants' Ex
change are anxious to have parsed by the
next Legislature and approved by 'Gov
ernor Gage. The bill was onginally
drawn by ex-Assemblyman Bretz, and the
exchange has just received a report made
at its request from Mr. Bretz on the
standing of mutual insurance companies
in other States.
The exchange has discovered that the
average rate of tire insurance in Oakland
is at present Jl 47 on $100. The average
in Pennsylvania and other States where
mutual insurance prevails is about 50
cents. This report has been placed before
the Alameda delegation, and the mem
bers, or most of them, confess that they
are practically convinced by the argu.
ment, but they do not wish it to appear
that they are fathering a bill that is not
practicable and that may bring upon
them the odium of trying to cinch the
stock insurance companies. The members
of the delegation have stated that they
do not want to be misunderstood, and
consequently no one has volunteered so
far to introduce the bill, but the delega
tion, through its chairman, has declared
that should the bill be sent to its head
quarters at Sacramento they will arrange
among themselves how and by whom it
shall be presented.
President Arper has given notice to the
legislators that in addition to the bill
they will be supplied at the expense of
the exchange with all the reports and
data in a handy form necessary to force
fully present the question to the Legisla
ture.
GRANTED A NEW TRIAL.
Sherman May Still Escape Punish
ment on a Charge of Em
bezzlement.
OAKLAND, Dec. 28.â John L. Sherman,
convicted ten days ago by a jury of em
bezzling $500 belonging to Mrs. A. Small,
a widow, was granted a new trial late
this afternoon on the ground that the
verdict was not In accord with the evi
dence. Sherman was to have been sen
tenced this afternoon by Superor Judge
Ellsworth, but his attorneys, Judge J.
D. Sullivan and Colonel T. F. Garrity,
moved for a new trial. Judge Sullivan
contended that if Sherman, at the time
of the alleged crime, had been acting as
agent between Mrs. Small and San Fran
cisco parties, the accused having agreed
to purchase from the latter a cigar stand,
then embezzlement had been committed.
But the testimony showed that the widow
had agreed to take a promissory note for
the money. Again. Judge Sullivan con
tended that if the intent to defraud Mrs.
Small had been conceived by 3herman at
the time, the crime would not be embez
zlement but larceny, and If he misrepre
sented that the money was to be used
In purchasing a cigar stand it would be
obtaining money under false pretenses.
In granting the motion for a new trial.
Judge Ellsworth stated that there was
no question, in his opinion, that the Jury
had found accused guilty on general
principles of his rascality. "In my opin
ion, there is no meaner form of crime,"
said Judge Ellsworth, "than that of
which this man Is undoubtedly guiltyâ
that is. to prey upon the affections of a
woman and then rob her."
The matter will a^ain come up next
Wednesday to be set for trial. It Is.
however, now considered doubtful
whether, In view of the foregoing facts,
Sherman can be convicted of embezzle
ment.
MURDERERS' DAY IN
OAKLAND'S COURTS
Mrs. Mentel, Frank Cheese-
man, J. W. Lynn and Mrs.
Brandes on Exhibition.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 28.
This was murderers' day. ThlÃ morning Mrs.' Anna Mentel, accom
panied by her attorney, W. W. Foote. appeared before Judge Ellsworth
to be arraigned. Her attorney explained that he was not yet ready to
proceed and his request for a continuance of one week was granted. Mrs.
Mentel is charged with the murder of her husband.
Frank H. Cheeseman, the man who shot Thomas H. Brooke, and who
has admitted that he conveniently loses his mind when he commits mur
der, entered a plea of not guilty and the date of his trial will be set next
Wednesday morning.
John W. Lynn, who shot several times at his wife and also with tem
porary success assumed the demeanor of a lunatic, pleaded not guilty and
his trial will commence on the 16th of next February.
In Justice Cliffs court Mrs. Etta Brandes had her preliminary hearing
on a charge of murdering her stepdaughter Lillian. Deputy Sheriff Albert
White testified that in the presence of a reporter Mrs. Brandes had told
him that she and not her husband had beaten the girl with a short piece
of hose and also a hickory stick. She was not then under arrest. Mrs.
M. Godfrey testified that Mrs. Brandes had said that the child was of a
peculiar temperament and a liar and admitted that Lillian had been
whipped on Tuesday evening for stealing.
Other witnesses were J. S. Harvey; Dr. H. N*. Rowell, who testified
that the girl died from being beaten; Dr. L. Whit worth, who was called to
Llilian while she was yet warm; Deputy Coroner Streightif and Mrs.
Mary Kennedy. The stories they told have been several times published.
Large blocks of testimony from the shorthand notes taken at the examin
ation of W. A. Brandes were admitted in evidence and when the prose
cution closed Mrs. Brandes' attorneys asked for a dismissal on the ground
that no evidence had been introduced tending to incriminate the prisoner.
Justice Clift will render his decision to-morrow afternoon, but it is
practically certain that the motion of the defendant to be dismissed will
be denied by the court and that Mrs. Brandes will have to stand trial in
the Superior Court.
MUCH LABOR TO
DIVIDE A COUNTY
MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE NOW
PLACING PETITIONS.
Senator Stratton Will Present a Bill
if It Be Drawn Constitu-
tionally.
Oakland Office San Franci6co Call.
908 Broadway, Dec. 28.
The question of consolidating the city
and county of Oakland Is to be placed
i before the people of the whole county In
I a methodical way by the Merchants' Ex
! change. Petitions are now being placed
i In all the towns and cities for the pur
pose of obtaining an expression of public
sentiment regarding the advisability of di
viding the county.
The Alameda legislative delegation nas
expressed its willingness to present the
necessary bill or bills to the Legislature
providing for the division of counties un
der such conditions as would enable Ala
â  meda County to be cut in two. Senator
: Btratton has informed the leaders of tne
movement that there are constitutional
questions involved, and that it will be
: necessary for an able attorney to draw
up the bills if they are to be constitu
j tional. The Senator expressed his willing
1 ness to prepare such a bill if he had time,
i but he says that it means a volume of
work and" research in order that it will
stand the test of the Judiciary Commit
tee of the Legislature.
Chairman Soh.-t of the Consolidation
Committee declares that he has offers of
all the money necessary to pay for draw
! ing up such a bill, and for preparing the
1 data necessary for argument at Sacra
| mento. The matter has been agitated tor
several years, and at present there are
I two schemes being considered. One is
, to make a city and county out of the bay
clties, and to this Alameda. satisfied with
her own government, vigorously objects.
Should the bill be framed so as to favor
the absorption of Alameda in one form or
another it will certainly be opposed by
Senator Taylor and Assemblyman Kinnv
land, both of whom come from Alameda.
They have already served notice on the
rest of the delegation to this effect.
In the Interior of the county there is a
i strong development of the sentiment in
favor of cutting the county in halves and
placing the new county seat somewhere
' between Hay wards and Livermore. It
has been pr ved by City Auditor Snow
! and the flgi j s and facts obtained by the
i Hoard of Trade ?.nd the Merchants' Ex
change that there could be a reduction in
taxation of from 20 to 30 per cent if there
' were a consolidated government instead
! of as at presentâ city and county govern
ments. Attorneys John R. Glascock and
! Cary Howard, who have been consulted
in this matter by the merchants, have
stated that in addition to a general bill
covering the consolidation question it
would be necessary to have another bill
applying the principles of the general bill
to Alameda County. These measures will
be drawn an soon as possible, and Sena
tor Strntton, chairman of the Alameda
delegation, has informed the promoters
of consolidation that everything possible
would be done to properly present the
views of its constituents at Sacramento.
THE COURT QUESTION.
Berkeley to Secure Appropriate Legis
lation for a Local Judiciary.
BERKELEY, Dec. 28.â A1l efforts on
the part of the Board of Trustees to se
cure a Police Court for the university
town by an appeal /to the votes of its
residents has been dropped. The major
ity of the board feel convinced that how
ever an amendment to the city's freehold
charter might be worded, whether pro
viding for an elected or an appointed
Judge, the measure would certainly en
counter opposition serious enough to pre
vent its success at the polls. They ac
cordingly intend to seek a remedy at the
hands of the State Legislature and to
put an end to . the peculiar conditions
under which the city, now labors of hav
ing no available means of enforcing law,
by so altering the Code of Civil Proced
ure as to make the establishment of a
Police Court here a legal necessity.
At the Instance of Town Attorney
Brenton A. Hayne three measures are
being prepared which will be brought be
fore the next Legislature. As the whole
question is fraught with legal difficulties
it is expected that one of the three may
cover the requisite ground. They are be
ing formulated by Attorney W. H. Waste,
Attorney Brenton A. Hayne anil Sena
tor-elect E. K. Taylor of Alameda. At
torney Waste has already framed his and
it will be Introduced into the Assembly
by Assemblyman Howard E. Wright. It
is intended as an amendment to section
103 of the Code of Civil Procedure and
provides for one Justice of the Peace in
every town or city of over 10,000 and-un
der 34,000 inhabitants. If successful the
measure will provide the town with its
much-needed judiciary, as its present
population numbers over 12,000.
The amendment is to read as -follows:
In every city or town, having 10,000 and not
more than 34.000 Inhabitants, there shall bo one
Justice of the Peace. . . . Every Justice of
the l'eace in any city or town having more
than 10,000 and not more than 15,000 inhabi
tants, shall 1)0 entitled to charge and receive
for his services Buch fees as are, or may be.
allowed by law. Provided, that in said cities
or towns, having more than 10,000 and not more
than 15.000 inhabitants, every Justice of the
Peace shall lif entitled to receive for his ser
vices in criminal prosecution for the violation
of city or town ordinances, only such fees or
salartr as the Board of Trustees or City â¢"'oun
cil of such respective city or town may by
ordinance prescribe.
Meade Gets Two Years.
â¢ OAKLAND, Dec. 28.â Richard Meade
pleaded .guilty this morning in the Su
perior Court of burglarizing the resi
dence of John W. Swift. Meado married
only a few months ago, and claimed that
he entered the Swift residence to steal
rugs, which he sold to raise money with
which to buy food for bis young wife.
There were two charges against Meade
and it was suggested that the second
charge be dismissed, but Judge Ellsworth
stated that he could see no reason for
such action and regarded the plea as
flimsy. Pie sentenced Meade to one year
at San Quentin In each case.
HIS CHILDREN MUST
NOT BE THESPIANS
YON SCHMIDT FEARS HIS WIFE
WILL REAR THEM WRONGLY.
Has Determined to Fight for Their
Custody in the Divorce Pro
ceedings Now Pending.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 28.â E. A. yon Schmidt,
who is defendant in a divorce suit, is not
only going to combat the plaintiffs claim
for alimony, but he is going to strive to
secure the guardianship of their five
children. When the suit was tiled Mr.
yon Schmidt gave out the statement that
his wife had been a ballet dancer. Now
he is going to use that fact in his plea
for the custody of their offspring. He
does not want his children to shine as
stars of the stage. He asserts that his
wife's tastes run that way, and that if
she secured control of the children she
would shape their futures in the wrong
direction.
Mrs. yon Schmidt took quite an inter
est in amateur theatricals here and never
hesitated to allow the children to take
part in entertainments where their dra
matic abilities might be encouraged. \ll
this was contrary to the Ideas of the
father.
"1 am not willing that my wife should
have the determination of the future of
our children," said Mr. yon Schmidt
' Kven if I should be indifferent on my
own account. I am not willing that th*e
grandsons of my father shall go on the
stage or enter into the careers of shop
keepers or haberdashers. Mrs yon
Schmidt's predilections for the stage
would, it is natural to suppose, cause her
to prepare the boys for that life instead
of sending them to college and fitting
them for a career in keeping with that of
thÂ»ir grandfather and great-grandfather
For that reason I shall fight bitterly for
their guardianship. 1 must have it in
my power to say -that they shall not be
prepared for the doubtful careers of
actors."
Obsequies of Susan Barlow.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 2S.â The funeral of
Mrs. Susan Barlow took place this morn
ing from the Loyal Oak Hotel, which had
been the home of the deceased for over
thirty-five years. Rev. p. S. Brush of the
E irst Presbyterian Church conducted the
services. The pallbearers were John H
Nobmann Sr.. George N. Grey, Frank
Cory and Ed Schultis. The body was in
terred at the cemetery at San" Lorenzo.

was treated by some of the very best physician*,
who pronounced it contagious, blood poison,
through whom I spent hundreds .of dollars-trying :
to get relief, but it seemed to get worse. All the
time I was suffering untold agony ;-*ad finally
bad to give up work entirely. . 1 grasped at every,
thing I saw advertised, and listened to every Bug- .

my case. The burning, itching fix I vras in seemed
to be aggravated by every effort to relieve myself ;
but, thank God, relief came to me at last.- Ocm-
cura Remedies were suggested t.o me, and 1
immediately procured the Cuticdra (ointment).

From the first, I experienced a soothing. relief,
notwithstanding my intense pain. The -warm -

first. I improved right along, and in If .than

Barclay received the money, for which
he gave a receipt, to which he signeti ttm
name of Cator. Barclay hurried, from th-e
bank to the nearest livery stable and
hired the best rig in the establishment
with a driver. He was driven to San
Mateo. where he dismissed the rig and
took the. train for San Francisco..
Cashier Parkinson had received a tele
pram from the Los Angeles bank . two.
days before Instructing him to pay a
well-known citizen of Palo Alto $500, and
the Cator telegram, written on the same
line^, appeared all straight. But the.
driver or the rig had his. suspicions
aroused by the actions of Barclay. The
latter insisted on stopping at every road
house oh the trip and otherwise conducted
himself in a queer manner, â so that as
soon as he arrived home the driver hunt
ed up Mr. Parkinson and told him the
man was a crook. The cashier at once
telegraphed to the Los Angeles bank and
a reply was promptly received stating thar
the Cator telegram was a forgery. .Par
kinson telephoned the facts to- the Central
Police Stanon in this city at 2 o'clock yes
terday morning, and Lieutenant Birdsali
was at once detailed on the case. . The of
ficer found his man two hours later in a
Bush street lodging-house in company
with a dissolute woman and placed him
under arrest. He was taken to the Cen
tral station and $72 and a diamond ring
were found on his person. He admitted
that ho had purchased the ring for $225
the afternoon of the day previous. Yes
terday afternoon the officer, who had
been given the case, recovered $500 which
Barclay had given the landlord of the
lodging-house to- keep, for him.
Barclay was ruojected to a severe
questioning and confessed all. According
to his story Mickler had handled the
genuine telegram in regard to the pay
ment of $500, and evolved the scheme to
swindle the institution. As he bad ac
cess to the receiving blanks of the tele
graph company and was familiar with the
form used by the bank the scheme gave
every promise of success.
Mickler arranged to meet Barclay at
Fourth and Townsend streets in this city
on Wednesday night to divide the spoil?.
He was on hand at the appointed time,
' but Barclay had concluded to keep all the
money and did not show up. MickW,
thinking his companion in crime had been
arrested and the game was up,- skipped
the. town.
Both Barclay and Mickler are young
men, and are said to belong to highly re
spectable families in Oregon.

A New Bill on the Subject WillÃe
Introduced at the Next Legis

The question of a free market on the
San Francisco' water- front for farm,
garden, vineyard and orchard produce
will be heard again In the Legislature.
At the last session a bill was passed '
authorizing -the -Harbor Commissioners to
Bet apart wharf space for .the receiving
of marketable produce and Its sale there
on. The promoters of this measure,. how
ever, complained- that certain influences
had mutilated trie bill prior to' its passage,
leaving out all provision for a rot of space
â 'on the State land â¢ that was absolutely
needed for the "project. ' This they alleged
was brought, about by the Pacific Coast
Steamship. Company, which Is occupying
the space desired by. the free market
people. . ' â¢ .". . â¢
â¢They are now working on a new bill,

Messrs. Adams .a : nd â¢ Moore went over
the ground fri the advocacy of the mar
ket-. The Senate committee did not mani
â  fest any expression regarding the infor
mation given .and' the meeting closed.
The' questions asked by the Senate com
mittee demonstrated the fact that the
idea. was. running through the Senatorial
composite brain that some merchants or
middle men would get free- offices or
stores at the State's expense, and that
the plan was not practical enough to
bring a lasting-, benefit to the producers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1898.
SHAKE-UP IN
THE POLICE
Chief Lees Stirred to
Action.
RESULT OF CALL'S EXPOSE
QFFICEB& IN GAMBLING DIS
TRICT GO TO OTHER BEATS.
They Are Said to Have Given Warn
ing to Friendly Saloon-Keep
ers Instead of Arrest
ing Them.
Chief Lees has at last been compelled
to admit .that -I'he Call was telling the
truth when it published the list of faro,
crap and roulette games which were being
operated in the Palace. Hotel and else
where . throughout the city, under the
very nb.ses of the police, and apparently
with the sanction or connivance of men
high in authority in the Police Depart
ment^ :
As a direct result of The Call's expose
a ghake-up in the- police of the Southern
station has taken place. Officer Driscoll
has been transferred from the corner of
Third and Market streets to lower Third
street, between Folsom and the railroad
tracks. Officer Harrison has been.trans
ferred from Third to Folsom, Officer
Netting taking his place. Officer Fraher
has been â¢ taken from, the beat on upper
Market street and sent to lower Third,
while Officer Riley goes from the latter
beat 'to. the Market-street beat. Officer
Phelan is also' transferred, from Folsom
stn-et to Market street. Fraher's trans
fer, is directly due to the Palace Hotel
scandal. The other changes are : also
caused by the alleged failure of the otfl
cera along Market street to report the
existence of gambling games on their
beats, and their further failure to execute
the orders of the- Chief. '
Several days- ago the Chief, issued or
ders for the arrest of a nunroer of saloon
keepers who were operating- nlckel-in-the
slot machines; paying money to winners.
Instead oY.. arresting the saloon men the
officers noil tied them to get rid of the ma
chines. Then the Chief concluded that
the officers .were rather too well ac
quainted with the lawbreakers and issued
ord-ers for their transfer. At police head
quarters it Is officially denied that the
changes are due to the gambling scandal,
but among the men themselves ii is- no
secret tha.t the Chief has been very much
perturbed by The Call's â  criticism, and
that his .sudden activity is attributable
to no other cause.
The first intimation that the Chief was
beginning to come, out of the trance into
which. h<? had fallen was when he made
his great, raid on the saloons where the
nefarious slot machines were, being oper
ated to rob the- public of its nickels last
Saturday night. At lTrst it Was .feared
that this was but a spasmodic attempt on
the part of the head of the Police Depart
ment to prove to the citizens of San
Francisco, that he was alive and that he
would, after having gathered in a fair
exhibit of these gambling devices, settle
back in his chair for another long, remin
iscent doze. '
But The Call's story of the big gambling
layout .in the Palace, operated under the
very-nose of the ' Chief himself, with the
mass of evidence offered to prove all that
was alleged, struck deep into the very
soul of the aged sleuth. He tried to deny
the truth, but he soon found that it was
useless, as the gamblers themselves ad
mitted the facts as-published. The subse
quent publication of a list .of other places
where gambling games were allowed to
run unmolested and the criticism of the
Police Department which . was entailed
thereby rankled in the breast of the
Chief- until he determined to act. The re
assignmrnt of officers followed.
If the Chief, will now detail, an officer
whom he ran trust to stand behind his
chair and pinch him whenever he falls
into a. doze, it is barely possible that he
may keep fairly well posted on what is
going oh in police circles and know
whether or not his subordinates are doing
their duty. : Otherwise it is more than
probable that things will soon get back
into the same old ruts and the cruel duty
of applying a galvanic battery to the
venerable official in order to awaken him
will again have to be resorted to.
WATER WAS LOW IN
THE WALKER'S BOILSRS
AN IRON FLUG WAS T7SED IN
STEAD OF A FUSIBLE ONE.
Ship's Officers Suspended for Neglect
of Duty in Not Reporting to
; the Board of Boiler
Inspectors.
Captains John K. Bulger and O. F.
Bolles, United. States Local Inspectors of
Steam Vessels, completed their report
yesterday afternoon in the matter of the
explosion of the steam drum of the T. C.
Walker on November 2? of this year as
..the. steamer was leaving Turner's Land
ing at a quarter' past 4 o'clock in the
morning:
' The report states that all the engineers
agreed . that owing to the distance from
'the engine-room to the flreroom it was
not possible for the single engineer to
give the attention due to the boilers with
out, at the same time, neglecting his duty
in the engi-ne-rroom.
"For reason of this," the report goes
on- to say, "we will issue an order to the
owners of steamers where like conditions
obtain to place licensed engineers on
each." . .
The Inspectors found that the tubes in
the starboard wing boilers showed cvi
' deuces of having Tbeen overheated, and
the metal in the fusible plug was about
melted out, which facts, say the inspec
tors, are conclusive of low water in that
particular boiler.
"It is our opinion," proceeds the re
port, "that the explosion of the steam
drum was owing to the rapid generation
of steam and from water coming in con
tact with the overheated tubes of the
starboard wing boiler, thereby causing a
.great- and instantaneous rise of pressure
in the drum far exceeding its capacity
to withstand. "We are unable to attach
the blume of this explosion to the en
gineer in charge at the time, nor to any
other licensed officer of the steamer. It
is evident to us that in many cases the
licensed officers of steam vessels fail to
report occurrences on board which It is
their duty to make known to the Inspect
ors of Steam Vessels, for fear of dis
missal from employment, and that this
fear likewise causes them to withhold
things known to them concerning tne
steamers upon which they are employed
when testifying in investigations held by
this board."
The board then imposed the following
sentences:
The license of Chief Engineer Charles
Sampson to be suspended for three
I months for using an iron plug instead of
: a fusible plug.
Richard J. Murray, engineer in charge,
I suspended for two months for falling to
report the Iron plug incident to the in
spectors.
William H. Douglass, assistant engineer,
suspended for two months for similar neg
lect of duty.
The inspectors found that the damage
to the steamer was $2500.
James Ross Jumps Overboard.
James Ross, a man. about sixty years
o.f age, jumped from the Folaom street
wharf about- 1 o'clock Tuesday afternoon
and narrowly escaped drowning. Had It

HIS CLUB WAS LITTLE
PROTECTION.
Policeman Pete Gillen Removes a Broken Wire
With Surprising and Unexpected Results.
A GOOD many policfmcn -are im
bued with the idea that their
clubs are non-conductors of
electricity, and when they see
a broken wire on the sidewalk or
roadway they use their club to re
move it out of danger. About two
months ago Policeman McGee made
an attempt of this kind on Golden
Gate avenue, and he was not able
to leave his bed for several days.
He will not now touch a broken
electric wirp with a ten-foot pole.
Early Tuesday morning Policeman
Pete Gillen was patrolling his beat
and at McAllister and I,nrkln streets
he came across a broken telephone
Wire on the sidewalk. He at first
thought of removing it with his
hand, but fortunately changed his
mind and pulled out his club. Just
his working clothes, and succeeded in res
cuing the wouia-be sulcid â . Ross was
conveyed immediately to ;:n; Harbor Hos
pital 'where, after considerable effort on
the part of the doctors, he was resusci
tated' A number of those who stood on
the wharf are now endeavoring to get the
credit which rightly belongs to Brodie.
PLEADING THE BABY ACT.
W. K. Hearst Exhibits Rare Humor
When Accused of Violating
a Copyright.
William R. Hearst yesterday filed his
r answer in the United States District
Court in the suit of A. L. McDonald vs.
W. R. Hearst to recover $82,729 damages
alleged to have been sustained by the
plaintiff by reason of the Examiner hav
ing pirated his map of the Klondike and
having published it in the edition of the
i Examiner of August 22. 1897. According
]to the Examiner's own statement the
! circulation of the paper on that date was
1 82,729 copies (Including those sent to the
city garbage crematory) and McDonald,
under the law, assessed the damages at
$1 for each copy..
The answer is sworn to by T. T. Wil
liams, and al'tfcr making a general denial
to all the allegations of the complaint
goes on to say: "Defendant denies that
on or about the said or any
Sunday or the said 22d day of
August, 1597, or at any other
time, or at all, there were found or were
j- in fact discovered In the possession of
i the said defendant 82,729 sheets of the
I issue of said newspaper known as the
! Examiner on the day of Sunday, August
| 22, 1897, or of any issue."
The defendant also avers that at no
). time within the said year 1897 was he in
' the State of California and that the map
i mentioned and in fact everything else in
I the paper, including the fakes, were pub
lished wlthofit his Knowledge or consent.
It therefore appears from the answer
that Mr. McDonald committed a grave
error In having failed to procure the
searching of Mr. Hearst's person in New
York for the 82,729 copies of the paper
of the date of August 22. 1897. If Mr.
Hearst had been searched and the papers
discovered on his person there can be no
doubt, under Mr. Williams' humorous in
terpretation of the law. that Mr. McDon
ald would have had the diamond cinch
on the absent editor whose paper In San
Francisco is published without his knowl
edge or consent.
Gustav Walter's Estate.
Two applications for partial distribu

as the club touched the wire Gillen
was enveloped in a blue flame, and
something struck his wrist so hard
that he turned a somersault and
remembered nothing more for sev
eral minutes. He got a citizen to
notify the Central police station,
and he was taken to his home in the
patrol wagon. He suffered intensely
from the shock,- but was able
to report for duty yesterday
afternoon. He ascertained yes
terday that the wire was charged
with 50i) volts, and surprise was ex
pressed that he was not killed. If
he had touched the wire with his
hand, as he at first intended, he
would have been instantly killed.
Gillen is very popular among his

BLACKMAN HAS
MYSTERIOUSLY
DISAPPEARED
Fails to Answer to His
Name.
BONDS DECLARED FORFEITED
SALOON-KEEPER ROOD HELD TO
ANSWER.
The Disgraced Policeman's. Bonds Are
Supposed to Be Worthless and
the Police Are In
dignant.
CasÃlus H. Blackman, the disgraced po
liceman, charged with grand larceny, has
disappeared and yesterday Judge Mogan
declared his bonds forfeited and Issued a
bench warrant for his arrest.
Blackman and Frank H. Rood, a sa
loon keeper at Sixteenth and Valencia
streets, were arrested for stealing $180
from Cornelius Cronln, an old man from
Nevada. At Blackman's request he de
posited $255 with Rood, and a few hours
later when he was taken back to the sa
loon by Blackman Rood gave him only
$75. alleging that was all the money he
gave Into his charge.
The preliminary examination of the de
fendants lasted for several days, and the
evidence for the prosecution was very
damaging to them. The case for the de
fense was to go on at 11 o'clock yester
day, but Blackman failed to respond to
his name. Rood was present with his
attorney, and the Judge was informed
that no evidence for the defense would
be submitted. The Judge thereupon heid
Rood to answer before the Superior Court
in 32000 bonds, which were promptly fur
nished.
Attorney Wilson, on behalf of Black
man, asked for a continuance till 2 o'clock
as he could not understand the non-ap
pearance of his client. The Judge con
sented, but ordered a bench warrant is
sued for Blackman's arrest. Sergeants
Perrin and Griffiths were handed the war
rant and they made diligent search for
him, but failed to find him. Mrs. Black
man told them she had not seen her hus
band since 8 o'clock Tuesday night. Po
lice Corporal Gills saw him on McAllis
ter street, opposite the City Hall, about
11 o'clock yesterday morning, and Bond
Inspector Newman saw him a fow min
utes later in Judge Conlan's court. Noth
ing was seen of him later.
Judge Mogan waited till 3 o'clock, and
as Blackman had not appeared he de
clared his bonds forfeited, but at the re
quest of Attorney Wilson, said that if
Blackman was found meantime he would
recall the forfeiture of the bonds. The
case was continued till this morning.
The Judge said he considered the bonds
worthless. They were accepted by Jus
tice of the Peace Barry while acting for
Judge Conlan on December 15. The sure
ties are Blackman's codefendant, Rood,
who qualified on stock and fixtures in
his saloon and on mining property in
Plumas County, but no State was men
tioned. The other surety is William Ken
nedy. 44 Brady street, who qualified on
lots on Brady street and a lot on Eigh
teenth and Denver streets. Inquiry made
by Captain Seymour elicited the fact that
the Brady-street lots are assessed at $1090
and they were mortgaged to the Hibernla
Bank for an equal amount. There is no
such street as Denver. Nothing was said
in the bond as to the properties being in
cumbered or unincumbered.
Captain Seymour, in speaking of tha
bond, said: "The bond was only filed to
day. Judge Barry having kept It in his
pocket since accepting it. Bond Inspector
Newman had in consequence been unable
to pass upon it. I consider gross care
lessness has been shown in accepting
such a bond, and when the next Grand
Jury meets I shall take the matter before
It. When a bond is accepted by a Judge
for a case in another court it should be

â¢ Miss Nance O'Neil is making out an
excellent week at the California. She
will play the part of Meg Merrilies- to
night in "Guy Mannering," repeating the
performance to-morrow night. The Sat

ance on Sundey night Miss O'Neil will
give her remarkable impersonation â  or
Nancy Sykes in "Oliver Twist."
West's minstrels are doing a standing
room-only business at- the Columbia' and
presenting one of the cleverest shows of
this kind ever seen in San Francisco.

houses are the order of the week. An
other Hoyt play, "A Temperance Town,"
follows.
In fact, all the theaters are having a
lively holiday week. The Tivoli has a
genuinely festive attraction in "The Yel
low Dwarf," which will soon go into a
second edition.
Even standing room Is hard to find af
ter 8 o'clock these nights at the Orpheum.
Golden, the monologist, .-till hoMs the
crowd, and the rest of the bill is valuable
and versatile.
The news that old Morosco's is to be a
thing of the past after this week has
served to pack that temple of melodrama
nightly. A hugely sensational melo
drama, "The White Squadron," is the
play In which the old favorites are say
ing* adieu. The company will go on the
road next week and Hi Henry's min
strels will take the Morosco stage for a
couple of weeks. Then the house closes
for repairs and alterations against the
coming of Melba and the opera.

scene from "Die Walkure." "Waldwe
ben" from "Siegfried," "Dre%ms" and
"Albumblatt." Mendelssohn's "Scotch"

brilliant season for Rosenthal. the great
