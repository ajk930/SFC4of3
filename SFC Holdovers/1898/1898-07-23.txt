SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 21, by the Call-
Herald dispatch boat to Port Antonio, Jamaica,
July 22.â Great excitement was caused in San
tiago to-day by a story brought in by Cubans to
the effect that 4000 Cuban insurgents,
comprising General Garcia's army of the east
ern department of Cuba, have been routed in a
fierce engagement with a detachment of Spanish
ops bound for Santiago to surrender. In this
battle, which is reported to have taken place at
a point several miles to the north of this city,
forty-one Cubans were killed and many more
w^ere wounded. The Spanish loss, I am in
formed, was much smaller. I was unable to
verify the story and give it as the army here
heard it.
Nothing happening in this vicinity recently has taken the
American "officers and troops so completely by surprise as this
reported battle between Cubans and Spaniards. Our troops had
come to look upon the insurgents as eaters rather than as fight
ers, and they scarcely believed that Garcia's men had laid an
ush and had opened the fight by attacking the Spanish
troops.
I have been unable to learn as yet whether General Garcia
was aware of the number of the enemy he was attacking. If he
rht he had encountered a small force of Spaniards t and
overpower them easily it was a grave mistake. There
: at least 5000 Spaniards in the body, according to the ac
â¢unt. and they drove Garcia's men into full retreat a few hours
after the battle began.
This defeat of the insurgents, if the report is true, is the first
il Garcia's petulant disagreement with General
h after and of his decision to no longer co-operate with the
American forces. When the Cuban general withdrew his troops
to the mountains, as already has been told in these dispatches,
he resolved to move on to Holguin, about sixty miles to the
northwest of this city. If the Americans would not allow them
to wreak vengeance on the Spaniards in Santiago, the Cubans
proposed to storm some other important place and take posses
sion of it on their own account.
It was with this object in view that General Garcia withdrew
his troops from the American lines and refused longer to act as
an ally of General Shafter. He decided to capture Holguin, if
possible, and to there set up an insurgent government, making
that place Cuban headquarters for the eastern department.
It is not related how far to the northwest of Santiago
General Garcia's army had proceeded upon this mission when
the Spanish troops were encountered. They had been march
ing for many hours, however, and must have been well started
on their journey.
I am told it is a question as to which were the most sur
prised, the Cubans or the Spaniards, when the two bodies of
troops met on the road between Santiago and Holguin.
The Spaniards had been gathered from fortified towns in
the vicinity and were proceeding to Santiago under the terms of
surrender agreed upon by General Toral. They were seeking
to carry out in good faith the agreement made with General
Shafter. They were not looking for a fight and were caught off
their guard.
General Garcia ordered his men to form so they would be
concealed in the chaparral, hoping to annihilate the first sections
of the Spanish troops. His plans were promptly put into execu
tion, but the Spaniards, quickly recovering from the demoraliza
tion caused by the opening shots, fought fiercely, and General
Garcia's ambuscade was a failure.
Although unsuccessful in his plan to entrap the Spanish,
General Garcia sent word to them demanding that they surren
der forthwith. To this demand the Spanish commander re
turned an emphatic refusal.
"General Toral," he notified General Garcia, "has surren
dered to the American army, not to Cubans."
Despite the information that these Spanish troops were part
of those included in General Toral's surrender, General Garcia

thereupon ordered his troops to prepare to fight. The Cubans
quickly took the positions to which they had been assigned, and
the order to fire was passed along the line.
General Garcia had decided to attempt to carry the Spanish
position by assault, and his troops pressed forward when the
word was given. Their progress was firmly resisted at every
point by the Spaniards, who, after several hours' fighting, put
the Cubans to rout with the loss of forty-one killed and many
wounded. The Spanish suffered smaller loss.
This battle, with its disastrous results, has greatly excited
the Cubans. They are demanding vengeance and cannot, under
stand why the Americans do not annihilate their Spanish pris
oners of war.
General Garcia, prior to this reported exploit, had been caus
ing great trouble for General Shafter, the American commander
having been met at every point by the Cubans with claims for
precedence. All the Cubans violently opposed the terms upon
which General Toral surrendered to General Shafter. These
terms were dictated by General Shafter,. but the Cubans ever
since the city formally surrendered last Sunday have done
everything in their power to render the carrying out of the
terms difficult or impossible.
This reported exploit of Garcia in attacking a detachment of
American prisoners of war is regarded here as characteristic. It
is in line with the course he has pursued ever since he discov
ered that he was powerless to interfere with General Shafter's
plans about the Government of Santiago and the treatment of
the Spanish troops who had surrendered.
NO CONFIRMATION
AT WASHINGTON
NEW YORK, July 22.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs
the following: No official confirmation
has been received here of the report
that General Garcia attacked a body
of Spanish troops on their way to sur
render to General Shafter under the
terms of capitulation agreed upon with
General Toral.
Such action on the part of the Cuban
commander would be so totally foreign
to all usages of civilized warfare that
the authorities here are reluctant to
believe the report, and should it be con
firmed it would bring about a total
change in the relations between the
American forces and General Garcia, if
not between them and all the Cuban
insurgents on the island.
Even though General Garcia's course
should be disavowed by General Gomez
and other Cuban leaders, the American
commanders would not be able to re
pose confidence in them agaÂ£.
If Generar Garcia has taken any such
action he has greatly damaged his
cause and that of all Cubans in the
eyes of the administration and has
Justified General Shafter in neglecting
to consult him as to the surrender of

MANILA BAY, July 19, via Hongkong, July 22. â The disembarkation of the second
expedition of American troops from the transports is fairly under way to-day. ' The troops are
being landed at Paranaque, two miles south of Manila. The Boston and Callao have moved
across the bay to a point as close to the shore as they can go, and are covering the landing of
the troops with their guns.
It is strongly suspected the presence of the warships is intended to influence the rebels
more than the Spaniards, as there have been serious disagreements between General Anderson
and Aguinaldo. Although the rebels still are nominally friendly toward the American troops, I
have seen enough of their spirit to make me doubtful of their attitude toward us. in the near fu
ture.
The voyage of the second ex
pedition of American troops was
without any incident of impor
tance after leaving Honolulu, ex
cept the stop at Wake Island, on
July 4, to hoist the American
flag.
General Anderson and General
Greene early this morning went
to Paranaque in a launch from
the- Olympia. They examined
sites for the First California Reg
iment. After selecting a spot for
the camp and when the troops
were arriving the generals recon
noitered along the Spanish lines
at Malate, where a hot fight was
in progress.
The rebels evidently were los
ing more men than usual, for the
wounded have begun to pour
into our lines for treatment. Our
surgeons have established a tem
porary hospital under a large
mango tree, where several seri
ous operations have been per
formed.
The wounds of the rebels were
made by Mauser rifle bullets and
are very clean and merciful. Out
of a dozen severely wounded men
who were brought in while I was
there none had bones badly shat
tered. One captain was shot in
the left side just above the hip,
but he probably will recover. A
very young man was struck on
the left cheek and the bullet
lodged in his head. He also
probably will recover, though he
walked a half mile in the burning
sun to camp.
Arm and body wounds gener
ally do not prevent the victims
from walking to the hospitals. In
very serious cases the wounded
are carried in canvas hammocks
attached to a bamboo pole which
is borne by two men.
After leaving camp the launch
passed along the water front,
passing so close to the Spanish

docks that the soldiers could eas
ily have killed all of us with one
volley. Lieutenant Calkins, who
was in charge of the boat, headed
up the beach, expecting the gen
erals would tell him when they
had seen enough. But the army
officers were evidently unwilling
to change the boat's course as
long as the naval officer se
lected it.
The Spaniards watched us cur
iously. Twice squads of solcUers
came from behind the sancroag
works into full view, as if to fire,
but finally we passed close under
their guns without drawing a sin
gle shot. As we approached the
famous Lunetta batter)-, where
the Krupp guns are mounted,
General Anderson said that a half
mile out was close enough to it.
This battery was examined
through glasses, and then the
launch returned to Cavite.
The fighting around Manila2
has been more serious during the
last three days than at any time
heretofore. The Spaniards have
a strong outpost at Santa Ana,
cast of the city, which is now al
most cut off from the main lines.
If the rebels can carry this post
i hey will have the whole city in
vested. The fighting there is
likely to continue several days
longer. There was a continuous
fusillade all around Manila on
Saturday and Sunday morning,
but the Spanish and rebels
hugged their trenches and little
damage was done.
The Spanish loss at Santa Ana
was between twenty and thirty:
at Malate, five, and at Baliebalic,
eight to ten. The rebel loss prob
ably was heavier, as the Span
iards, when they retired from Ba
liebalic on the north side of the
city, found the bodies of twenty
rebels close up to the Spanish
trenches.
The Spaniards still maintain
their outposts at Malate, Singa
lon, Santa Ana, Santa Mesa. Ba
liebalic and Gagalanguin. Sev
eral citizens were killed and
wounded at Malate by the rebel
artillery. One projectile struck
the cable company's house; an
other just missed the English
clubhouse. The rebels have ta
ken the blockhouse at Morypago
at the north end of the town,
greatly weakening the Spanish
position.
The Spaniards are throwing' up
earthworks into which to retire.
Their troops do twenty-four
hours' trench duty. Within three
week? it will all be over.
Five hundred men have gone
into the hospital with fever. The
hospitals are overcrowded, but
they are clean and well arranged
and amply supplied with sur
geons. Skilled English naval
doctors, who were invited to wit
ness some of the difficult surgi
cal operations, have reported fa
vorably on the work they wit
nessed.
The health of the naval crews
is excellent.
The Japanese cruiser Manila
has just arrived, bringing news of
Admiral Sampson's great victory.
As the signal went up on the flag
ship the seamen on all the vessels
in the harbor gave rousing
cheers. Their ardor was tem
pered only by the news that Ad
miral Camara was not coming to
Manila.
A curious accident is reported
from one of the outposts. An ar
tilleryman was loading a field
piece with a 4-inch shell when a
rebel bullet struck the shell, ig
niting the fuse. The shell ex
ploded and the gunner's head,
arms and face were shattered and
his legs terribly injured. He is
still alive, and the English sur
geon says he may survive.
The insurgents under General
Xoral have turned the left flank
of the Spanish defenses at Malate
and they now say they have a
firm grip on that place. The
Spanish still hold Malate arsenal,
which Xoral threatens with two
13-inch smooth bores. The
rebels are also strongly en
trenched at Santa Ana. The
Spanish have burned off the
brush and native huts, and any
advance into Malate must be
made under a heavy fire. When
I was on the beach within a mile
of Manila on Thursday, b.etween
the lines, I could see the positions
of both forces. Heavy firing has
taken place every day since, and
on Thursday it was particularly
heavy.
The insurgents to-day evident
ly are trying to drive the Spanish
from Malate and execute a final
flank movement on the farther
side of the city, but the Filliponos
will hardly be able to drive the
Spanish from their trenches.
The stories told by Spanish
prisoners make it evident that
little resistance will be made to
the Americans.
Three insurgent barges, on
ivhich were mounted four smooth
bores and one Armstrong gun,
were towed close to the shore in
front of Manila, and the rebels be
gan a heavy fire, the Spanish re
plying from the shore batteries.
Aguinaldo is permanently es
tablished at Bacor. one battalion
of American troops thus being
placed between him and Manila.
It is probable that the land at
tack upon Manila will be made

NEGOTIATIONS
FOR PEACE
IN PROGRESS
Premier Sagasta the Authority
for the Important State
ment.
Minister of Public Instruction Gamazo Makes a
Most Significant Utterance on the
Subject.
LONDON, July 22.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
Penur Sagasta told a representative of
El Imparclal to-day (Friday) that the
Government had already entered upon
the preliminary stage of peace negotia
tions. General Polavieja has arrived
and will have an audience with the
Queen Regent to-morrow.
MADRID, July 22, S a. m.â The Min
ister of Public Instruction, Senor Ga
mazo, is authority for the state
ment that peace, honorable to the
Spanish army, will shortly be con
cluded.
In an interview in the Correspon
dencia Militar, the organ of the army,
Senor Gamazo is quoted as saying:
"The suspension of constitutional lib
erty cannot be agreeable to the press,
because It abrogates freedom and pre
vents the publication of news which
costs much. But at this moment what
can the Government do but check the
hostile campaign waged against it? I
was the first to beg the Cabinet to
treat the question as urgent, and I do
not regret my action. I will say from
my seat in Parliament that I am con
vinced that I did a service to my
country.
"At the same time I can give you
news which will please the press. The
suspension of the constitution will not
last long, for several reasons. One of
them is the calmness displayed by the
people and the army. It is not for me
to conceal the intentions of the Govern
ment, which are to conclude an honor
able peace, which will, in the first
place, satisfy the aspirations of the
army. After then, if Senor Sagasta
should think fit. he will ask the Queen
Regent if she still has confidence in her
present advisers."
LONDON, July 22.â The statement
made by Senor Gamazo, the Spanish
Minister of Public Instruction, to the
effect that peace, honorable to the Span
ish army, will shortly be concluded,
Is regarded in I^ondon more as an indi
cation of personal opinion or hope than
as reflecting any general decision of
the Cabinet. Nothing showing any
move in the direction of peace has been
received here from any quarter likely
country in front of Malate being
little adapted to the movement of
troops. One thousand insurgents
left here yesterday. It was re
ported they would go to Cama
rinos Island and capture a Span
ish force there.
Three Spanish prisoners cap
tured at Guam have offered to en
list in the American artillery.
CABINET DISCUSSES
MANILA SITUATION
WASHINGTON, July 22.â There were
several events of interest, if not of im
portance, at the War and Navy de
partments to-day.
General Anderson at Cavite sent a
message saying that Aguinaldo had de
clared a dictatorship and martial law
over the Philippines, something that
gave the Cabinet food for consideration
at its regular meeting to-day. There
was no disposition to force any issue
with the insurgent chief at this time,
but it is pretty well understood that
he will not be allowed to commit the
United States Government in the fu
ture treatment of the Philippines ques
tion.
The visit of the German Embassador
to the President and the Secretary of
State was a basis for the belief that he
had called to make some representation
on the subject, and perhaps as well on
the question of peace as aftected by
the programme laid down by Watson's
projected voyage to European waters.
If so no official confirmation was ob
tainable, and "a friendly visit" was
the only explanation offered by Secre
tary Day for the appearance of the
German Embassador in the dogdays in
Washington. The embassy people were
no more communicative, so if anything
of importance passed during the meet
ing between the President and Dr. Yon
Holleben it probably will be revealed
only in the shape of action later on.
AGUINALDO CERTAIN
TO CAUSE TROUBLE
WASHINGTON, July 22.â The fol
lowing cablegram has just been re
ceived at the War Department:
."Hongkong. July 22.â Secretary of
the Navy: Aguinaldo declares dicta
torship and martial law over all the isl
ands. The people expect independence.
I recommend China ponies.
"ANDERSON."
Colonel Anderson was the senior
army officer at the Philippines when
the dispatch was sent, probably several
days before its Hongkong date. The
reference to China ponies means that
Colonel Anderson desires that kind of
cavalry animals.
HONGKONG, July 22.â Letters re
ceived here from Cavite, dated July 19,
say Aguinaldo refuses to be subordin
ate to the United States. He does not
seem to realize his position, as is evi
denced by his appointment of a cab
inet, his declaration of independence
and the formal hoisting of the insurg
ent flag. _
ABSURD PROCLAMATION
ISSUED BY AGUINALOO
LONDON, July 23.â The Hongkong
correspondent of the Daily Mail says:
"The latest mail from Manila reports
that the rebels have lately suffered
several reverses and have lost territory
south of Malate. General Aguinaluc
has issued an absurd proclamation,
dealing chiefly with official insignia.
He, as president of the Philippine Min
istry, is to wear a gold collar, a gold
triangular pendant, engraved with the
sun and three stars, and to carry a gold
whistle, as well as a stick with a geld
handle and a tassel of gold. The badges

to be well informed on the subject.
The Spanish Ambassador, Count Ras
con, who was questioned on the sub
ject, said:
"We have no news from Madrid, and
we have no reason to believe any such
decided step has been taken as Senor
Gamazo's statement would indicate."
At 1 o'clock this afternoon a promi
nent official of the British Foreign Of
fice said lo a representatice rf the As
sociated I'ress:
"We have nothing confirmatory of
Senor Gamazo's alleged statement. We
wish we had, and we hope it is true;
but so far as we are advised the signs
do not seem propitious for early
peace."
MADRID, July 22.â 1n talking over
the situation of the Queen a Spaniard
who knows a good deal about the pri
vate life of the court said:
'"To-day and ever since the war be
gan the great preoccupation of the
Queen has been to find the quickest
way to its termination. At many of the
Cabinet councils of late the Queen has
wept, begging and urgin.e her Ministers
to find some solution for terms of
peace. Little by little the Queen has
finally managed to bring the Cabinet
round to her view and thoughts of
peace.
"Since the commencement of the war
palace life has altered considerably,
and still more so since the illness of
the little King. Now her Majesty re
ceives as little as possible. Everything
the King eats is given him by his
mother, who previously tastes it,
imagining that the illness of the King
is owing to poison."
LONDON, July 23.â A special dis
patch from Madrid says: The arrival
of General Polavieja has increased the
persistent talk of a Cabinet crisis. The
Queen Regent is credited with exclaim
ing "Thank God!" when she knew he
was coming.
Opinions differ as to whether a semi
military Cabinet would be for peaca
of for a continuance of the war, but all
are agreed that it would at any rate
put an end to the present invertebrate
policy.
The belief is current in Madrid that
the delay in Commodore Watson's
starting is due to a desire to give
General Polavieja time to form a Cabi
net and to sue for peace.

nutely dealt with in the proclamation."
RUMORED AGREEMENT
REACHED BY THE POWERS
LONDON, July 23.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Daily News says:
"The powers, with the exception of
Great Britain, have agreed not to al

pines or an Anglo-American protector

WONDERS ACCOMPLISHED
WITHIN NINETY DAYS
Nearly Three Hundred Thousand
Men Recruited, Mustered and
Equipped.
WASHINGTON, July 22.â A consoli
dated statement prepared by Major
John A. Johnston, Assistant Adjutant
General, shows that of the 277,500 men
authorized by Congress to be enlisted
in the regular and volunteer armies,
254,479 up to this time have been mus
tered into the service. Of the 23,031
yet required to complete the authorized
quota 13.30S are regulars, 8000 are vol
unteers under the second call, 862 are
immunes and 851 are engineers.
The recruiting, mustering, equipping
and placing in the field of the present
great army of nearly 300,000 in less
than ninety days, nearly every man
having to undergo a strict examina
tion, is regarded by army experts as a
wonderful achievement. Officers re
presenting the great armies of Euro
pean nations have been amazed at the
work accomplished and admit frankly
that Europe contains little such fight
ing material as is to be found in
abundance in the United States.

VICE-PRESIDENT CAPOTE
REPUDIATES GARCIA'S COURSE
Will Go to Cuba and Endeavor to Undo the Mischief
Wrought to Freedom's Cause bu the Insur
gent Leader,
NEW YORK. July 22.â Senor Domingo Mendez Capote, Vice I
President of the Cuban republic, will leave New York within a day or i
two, bound for Cuba, where he will strive to undo the mischief done by <
General Calixto Garcia since the fall of Santiago. (â 
Senor Capote to-day conferred with T. Estrada Palma, Benjamin *
J. Guerra and Horatio S. Rubens, at the headquarters of the Cuban Junta. *
It was decided at this conference to take immediate steps to re-estab- *
lish friendly relations between the American and Cuban forces, so *
abruptly terminated by General Garcia. *
Vice President Capote, who has been in this city for several weeks, *
was requested to take the matter in hand. After the meeting Senor
Capote made public a statement in which he practically repudiated Gar- t
cia's course and renewed the pledge of the Junta that the Cubans would j
co-operate with the Americans at all times. The Vice President said )
in part:
"We will certainly fulfill the pledges we made as to complete co- (
operation, and will do all in our power to expel the common enemy as /
quickly as possible, following such plans as may be suggested by the (
American commanders, and in every way assuming our part of the con- <
flict. I shall return to Cuba as soon as possible and there on the i
ground will fully investigate and report as to the existing differences, i
if any.
"President McKinley has been very careful to state that the native <
constabulary and judges shall continue exercising their functions, but <
it is only natural to suppose when the Military Governor finds these <
to have been implanted by the Spanish crown and not by the munici- (
pality, that he will proceed to substitute others in their stead. <
"According to the spirit pervading the President's proclamation the (
only authorities will be a Military* Governor and his aides and the mv- (
nicipal authorities of the locality â that is to say, 'acquentamiento.' r
"We ourselves recognize the necessity of continuing ad interim in ,
operation all the laws other than political, for I have myself, with other
lawyers, been engaged in formulating these laws, with certain changes ,
necessary to the new regime." *

ON BOARD U. S. S. OREGON, off
Santiago de Cuba, July 6, 1893.â Owing
to a grave mistake that has been made
in regard to that naval battle that was
fought and won by the American navy,
and in which the battleship Oregon took
such an active part, I am writing this
letter in behalf of the crew of the
above-named battleship, and to give
the American people a true account
in as few words as possible, of this
great naval victory, and red letter day
in the history of America,
To commence with, about twenty
nine minutes after nine on the morn
ing of July 3, 1898, I was standing on
the bridge of the Oregon, when the
signal quartermaster sung out that the
Spanish fleet was coming out of the
harbor. All of the crew and officers
were in their best uniforms waiting for
quarters, as it was Sunday morning
and it was to be general muster. The
first one to catch the wo'-d was Cap
tain Clark, and he did not lose any
time in getting upon the bridge. I took
my station at .ne slx-pounder gun No.
17 forward on the starboard side of the
bridge. Captain Clark told me to go
ahead and fire the gun so as to get
the first shot in on them, and to have
it the chall nge shot. I loaded up and
fired just as the bow of the first cruis
er 'had cleared the corner of Morro
Castle. The shot went clean across
her and dropped in the channel so the
remainder of the cruisers would know
that we Were there and ready to give
them battle. After this first shot, the
battle was on, for the minute this
cruiser had got clear of every hing she
fired her whole broadside at us, but
thanks to God and our gallant captain,
the shell all went over us without do
ing any damage.
At this time there were none of the
other ships of tlie American fleet closer
than four miles, so the Oregon had to
give battle to four of Spain's .rst-class
cruisers and two torpedo boats all
alone, and until the Texas and Brook
lyn came up. From the time the Ore
gon started until she sunk the last ship
she fought the battle all the way
through. Our secondary battery put
the two torpedo boats out 01. commis
sion in about twenty minutes. The
fact is ...e Orsgon had all of these
cruisers completely disabled when the
lowa, New Indiana and Vixen
came up to assist us; they were up on
the beach and could not move, they
were so badly damaged. "We kept on
going, so as to head off the Cristobal
Colon, as she was going right ahead
and steaming about seventeen knots,
but the Oregon soon fixed her with her
eight and thirteen inch shells. We
fetched her to a dead stop and made
her surrender.
Now the lowa, New York and Indi
ana want to claim the honor of sink
ing the Vizcaya and Infanta Maria
Teresa, also the Almirante Oquendo,
but I can take an oath, so can every
one of our crew and officers, that the
lowa, Texas, New York and Vixen
were ten miles behind when the bat
tle-ship Oregon ran the Vizcaya and
Cristobal Colon on the beach. Com
modore Schley had declared the Viz
caya and Cristobal Colon surrendered
to the Oregon. I was an eye witness
to the whole battle, because I was
standing on the forward part of the
bridge, firing my 6-pounders. This
statement can be corroborated by every
officer and man on board the ship, and
I don't think it is fair for Captain
Evans to make such a statement, when
he knows the Oregon did the fighting.
The Oregon fought from beginning to
end, and- Captain Clark deserves pro
motion for his clever and skillful ma
neuvering of the ship, and only for
the speed of the Oregon the Cristobal
Colon would have got away. Ours is a
fighting ship, and all the other captains
know it, and are jealous of us, and
another thing, the captain of the Cris
tobal Colon said that only for the Ore
gon she would have given battle to the
Texas and Brooklyn.
The Oregon fired about three thou
sand shots, and every one was effec
tive. The decks of the Vizcaya were
completely torn out from the firing of
our secondary battery. That is all
I have to say in behalf of the crew,
but I hope you will remember us and
give the Oregon what she deserves and
what she has earned.
The writer of this fired the first shot
in that gr^at battle. If you will please
publish this statement you will do a
great favor for the crew of the Oregon
and right a great wrong.

tho friendship of the insurgent Cu
bans, and they should be made to know
that the only purpose of the United
States in waging a war agal-ist Spain
was to secure for the people of Cuba
relief from the oppression of Spanish
rule and a stable and satisfactory srov
ernment established by the people
themselves.
Of course, it was added. It was not
the intention of this Government to
drive the Spaniards out and then form
ally turn th.> island over to the insur
gents or to any other particular class
or faction. This Government had never
such a purpose; but, on the contrary,
it was well understood that a stable
government for and by all the people
of Cuba was the only purpose and end
sought to be attained.
The details incident to the estab
lishment of such a government it was
said, had never been discussed by the
Cabinet at any great length, but there
could be no difference of opinion as to
the general plan. All of the people of
the island, it was declared, must be
given an opportunity to express their
views as to the character of the con
stitution under which they were to
live and also as to the men who should
make and execute the laws.
The insurgent Cubans certainly could
not consistently ask for more than
this.

EXPEDITION UNDER
GENERAL MILES
CommaQder in Ctytef of the Army
Ser)ds a Cable From Mole
St. Nicholas
Ships Bearing the Invading Army Are Well
on TY)e\r Way Toward tt)e Porto Rican
Coast.
WASHINGTON, July 22.â The TVar
Department to-day received a telegram
from General Miles, a* follows:
"PLAYA DEL ESTE. 7 p. m.â Secre
tary of War: The following troops are
with me aboard transports in Guanta
namo harbor, enroute to Porto Rico:
Four light batteries of the Third and
Fourth Artillery. Lonic's Battery B
(artillery), the Illinois, the Sixth
Massachusetts, 225 recruits for the
Sixth Corps, t-ixty men of the Signal
Corps and seventy of the Hospital
Corpsâ 3l4s men all told. MILES."
Later came the following:
"MOLE ST. NICHOLAS, HaytiâSec
retary of War. Washington: Am dis
a}T"inted in non-arrival of Colonel
Becker with Construction <v>rps.
: .^1 Black arrived without snag
l its or lighters. Please send at ieaM
four strong sea-going liuht-rs and
tugs; also General Stone's boat at
Jacksonville, if not already sent, as
soon as possible. Moving along well.
â¢MILES."
It was calculated that General Miles'
military expedition against Porto Rico
was this morning somewhere off the
northern coast of Hayti. Secretary
Long says, according to his advices,
the fleet of transports, with the naval
gruardships, got away from Siboney at
half-past 3 yesterday afternoon, and it
is believed spent the night traveling at
about the usual naval cruising speed in
(Irons of ten knots an hour. The
question of guardships settled Itself
with the departure of the expedition,
but the naval officials are still of the
opinion that the warships sent are en
tirely disproportionate in strength to
the needs of the case, and the demands
laid upon the North Atlantic fleet to
supply them have interfered consider
ably, "it is stated at the department,
with the plans of the Naval War
Board. This is supposed to relate to
the departure of Watson's expedition,
but on that point the naval authorities
decline to say anything further, simply
pointing to the statement given out last
night by Secretary Long as expressive
of their views.
Although General Miles reported by
cable to-day from Mole St. Nicholas,
Hayti, that "he was moving along
â¢well" with the first detachment of the
military expedition against Porto
Rico, the body of the dispatch pre
ceding this, statement gave rise at first
to the apprehension that, like General
Bhafter at Santiago, General Miles was
threatened with a costly delay in land
ing his expedition on Porto Rican soil
:>\ving to the absence of lighters and
:ugs. Ii *.vns said at the War Depart
ment later on that some of the lighters
were already on their way from New
Orleans and New York, and that no de
lay would arise on that score.
ANNEXATION DESIRED
BY THE PORTO RICANS
NEW YORK. July 22.â The Herald
has Becured the following expression of
opinion by Dr. Julio J. lienna of this
city, who has bf-en named president of
the Tort.. Rican republic since the jun
ta was organized in 1595:
"I have always been personally an
annexationist, and although I am the j
president "f the Revolutionary Junta j
I should be pleased to Bee my country !
Joined io the United States. All I have j
ever asked the "Washinjrton authorities
is to take me to the island that I may >
Ifpu'- a manifesto informing the Porto j
Kicans that the United States is not i
going There on a war of conquest, but j
to free them from the Spanish yoke. :
giving them as much liberty as they
desire under the Stars and Stripes. In
this way I think a great deal of blood
shed oould be avoided."
Senor P. DÂ» Castro, one of the promi
nent members of the Porto Rican Jun
ta of this city, when asked as to the
attitude of the Junta, said:
"When that Junta was organized we
were pledged t>> secure the independ
ence of the island. That was more than
two years ago. Such a thing as annexa
tion was not discussed, because Spain
was not at war with America. Since
this war, however, all our people are
with America. At a meeting on July
12 we decided to assist the United
States unconditionally. The majority
of us are in favor of annexation. Any
talk of the revolutionary party of Porto
Rico resisting the invasion of the
Americans is nonsense. I was at the
meeting'Wid on July 12 in this city and
never heard such a threat. '
"I have grave doubts of our ability to
make a republic of Porto Rico, fearing
the effort would mean Internal strife,
but annexation would be successful.
The majority of Porto Ri^ans in this
country are heartily in favor of it.
There are some few against annexa
tion, but none who would counsel re
sistance to it by force of arms."

WATSON'S MISSION
IS TO LOOK AFTER
CAMARA'S FLEET
Our Government Has No Intention
of Bombarding Spain's Coast
Cities*
Momentous Questions Confronting the Nation
With Regard to Conquered Terri
tory.
WASHINGTON. July 22.â A signifi
cant statement was made to the Asso
ciated Press to-day by a gentleman in
a position to speak with knowledge
and authority as to the plans of the
Administration with reference to fu
ture Avar operations. In substance the
statement was as follows:
"Commodore Watson, In proceeding
to the Spanish peninsula as soon as the
Porto Rican expedition is gotten under
way, is not to bombard the cities on
the Spanish coast. No such idea of
bombardment of the coast is enter
tained. While there may be other in
cidental purposes, the main mission of
Watson is take care of Camara's fleet.
The movement of this fleet and the
fears and apprehensions caused by re
ports concerning it are to be stopped
for all time. The ships under Camara
will be located by Watson, finally met
and engaged. The talk occasionally
indulged in as to the Canary Islands is
utterly without foundation. This Gov
ernment has no plan to take the isl
ands and does not want them.
"Despite popular expectatJon that
Porto Rico operations will be followed
immediately by action against Hav
ana, it can be said that Havana will
not be attacked while yellow fever
conditions exist. This is certain. It
would be the height of national folly
to engage our troops in and about the
fever pesthole. Consequently, it wfll
be left until the climate lends its aid in
the autumn. Shatter will hold his own
in the eastern strip now surrendered
and may gradulally push his way over
some other districts, and if there
should be any particular need of im
mediate aggressive action at any point
he will move against it, but Havana
will be left until yellow fever dangers
are past.
'"Meantime, in the next two months
there will be enough to keep this Gov
ernment busy. We will have to cope
with the most serious problem yet
that of providing for the government
and the future of the lands Involved in
this war. The hauling down of the
Spanish flag and the hoisting of that
of the United States means more than
on its face it Indicates to the popular
mind. No more important matter is
to engage the attention of the Govern
ment than the details to be arranged
for the disposition, control or tempo
rary possession, pending final transfer
of possession of these additions to our
domain.
"There are questions of the most in
tricate and far-reaching character to
be decided. Porto Rico, whose fall is
likely to be recorded within a week or
ten days, will have to have a military
Governor. Porto Rico, of course, is to
be kept permanently by this Govern
ment, but this must be a military gov
ernment first, and many preliminary
details will have to be worked out.
There must be a rehabilitation of ex
isting systems of government where we
have carried our arms, and, while local
schemes and conditions will form the
basis of the general system for the con
trol of the land, there must be numer
ous changes, abolishing such laws as
may be oppressive. Laws will have to
be very thoroughly gone over and the
tariff system revised in some way, but
in general and as far as possible the
system of government which now ex
ists Is to be followed.
"All this means work of the most se
rious character, and in the absence of
existing laws to govern such matters
the President has to go ahead on his
own responsibility. Next winter, how
ever, when Congress convenes, the ne
cessity for laws covering such matters
will be recognised by recommendations
to Congress to that end, to be sub
mitted by the President, and it is very
probable the shaping of the destinies of
Porto Rico and similarly circumstanced
accessions will be left to a commission
or commissions to be appointed to
draft the laws for adoption by Con
grress. The Government is likely to be
busy from now on considering all
these matters of governmental detail.
"It is a certainty, as far as now can
be foreseen, that Guam, the island In
the Ladrone group that was captured
by this Government, will be perman
ently retained as a coaling and supply
station. For these purposes It Is valu
' able from Its location between Hawaii
and the Philippine Islands, but on the
point whether the rest of them will be
kept, lam not sure. They may be and
they may not be. The disposition of
the Philippines Is unsettled and de
pends upon circumstances.
"As to the attitude of Garcia and the
insurgents in Cuba, there is no change
in our intention. This Government has
not been misled in its estimate of the
Cuban forces. With the oppressive
hand Spain has put on them so long
contending against the conditions im
posed by Injustice and oppression, there
would have been little expectation of
greater abilities than are now shown
This government will have to treat
| them kindly but firmly. It has made a
pledge to establish a firm and stable
government and that must be carried
out. It. therefore, may be, In the light
of present circumstances and condi
tions, many years before affairs there
have so shaped themselves as to en
trust the Island to the Cubans and we
I finally yield our possession of them
i The transition must be gradual step
! by step, and the final general change of
; control effected only after a thorough
training with the trial of the leaders in
at first minor capacities. This Is what
is to be looked for and the gradual
transition will consume a length of
time considerably at variance with
what the people now expect."
FEAR A SEVERANCE OF
RELATIONS MUST COME
Disaffection Among Garcia's. Men
Becoming More Pronounced
Every Day.
- WASHINGTON. July 22. -The War
Department has not yet been informed
that General Shafter's Cuban allies have
quit the American lines fc. the reasons
sent out in the printed letter by Gen
eral Garcia, but it is scarcely doubted
that such is the case, for the friction
has been growing more pronounced
every day since the fall of Santiago,
and it is feared that a severance of re
lations cannot be longer avoided. That
the Cuban Junta is still hopeful of
avoiding such a measure is evidenced
by the confidence shown by Senor
Quesada, one of the Cuban Legation
here, in an amicable settlement

Santry of Chicago in a 20-round mill at

not show a mark. Tom Sharkey, Tim Mc-

CZARINA TABOOS
THE CIGARETTE
LONDON, July 22.â The Daily
Telegraph to-day publishes a
dispatch from St. Petersburg
which says the ladies of the Rus
sian court are greatly upset at
the fact that the Czarina has
forbidden cigarette smoking in
her presence. The dispatch adds
that the ladies have petitioned
her Majesty to withdraw the
prohibitory ukase, pointing out
that ladies smoke cigarettes at
all the courts of Europe and that
there are smokers among the
crowned heads and the prin
cesses of blood royal, including
the Dowager Czarina, the Em
press of Austria, the Queen of
Roumania, the Queen Regent of
Spain and the Queen of Portu
gal, while, they allege, the great
est devotee of all is Princess
Henry of Prussia, the sister of
the Czarina.
HOBSON VISITS

BESIEGED BY BIG CROWDS
ACCORDED A RECEPTION TRULY
DEMOCRATIC.
The Young Officer the Bearer of Dis
patches Regarding the Raising
of Cervera's Sunken
Ships.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 22.â The most
agreeable event of the day was the
arrival at the Navy Department of
Lieutenant Hobson, the hero of the
Merrimac. The officials were not in
formed of his approaching visit except
through the newspapers. Consequent
ly, when he reached the railway sta
tion here, at 2:38 o'clock this afternoon,
there was no official there to meet him
and his reception was truly democra
tic. He succeeded in escaping 1 observa
tion as he passed through the train
shed, coat and umbrella in hand, and
followed by a porter proudly carrying
his baggage, but before he emerged
from the station, some one spied him
and in a moment the station resounded
with vociferous shouting. The cry of
"Hobson! Hobson!" rang out, and the
crowd closed in about him, shaking his
hand and pushing him about until he
was rescued by the police and escorted
to his carriage. He stopped long
enough to announce that all of the
men who formed the crew of the Mer
rimac were safe and in the best of
health and that after he had made his
report to the Navy Department he ex
pected to return immediately to New
York.
The officer was driven at once to the
Army and Navy Club and after brush
ing himself up. he drove over to the
Navy Department. This time he car
ried with him under his arm a large
official envelope, which bore in the cor
ner the inscription, "North Atlantic
squadron."
As he approached the office of the
Secretary of the Navy there ensued
another demonstration. A large crowd
had gathered abeut the doorway and
the hearty welcome it gave the young
officer brought blushes to his cheeks.
Secretary *-.ong came out of his private
office and, grasping Hobson with both
hands, said with sincerity:
"Lieutenant, I am glad, very glad,
to see you."
Then he drew him Into his office,
where the lieutenant was introduced to
Assistant Secretary Allen and was
greeted by Captain Crowninshield,
Captain Bradford and Pension Com
missioner Evans, who happened to
drop in. He spent a half hour in con
ference with the Secretary and then
returned to the club for rest. Secre
tary Long stated that Hobson did not
bring the long-expected report from
Admiral Sampson and his brother offi
cers on the destruction of the Cervera
fleet. The exact purpose of his visit
was explained by the following order,
under which Lieutenant Hobson had
come to the United States:
United States Flagship New York.
First Rate, off Santiago de Cuba, July
17, 1898.â Sir: You will proceed north on
the St. Paul to#New York, thence you
will proceed to Washington and report
to the Secretary of the Navy and ac
quaint him with the object of your visit,
as set forth in my letter to him of this
date, regarding the work upon the Cris
tobal Colon. Explain to him fully the
position and condition of that ship and
receive his Instruction regarding it.
2. Be as expeditious as possible in
bringing the matter to a termination in
order that, if it Is practicable to do so,
this fine ship may be saved to the United
States navy.
3. When this dutyJs completed you will
ask for orders from the Secretary of the
Navy. Otherwise you will return to duty
on board this ship. Very respectfully,
W. T. SAMPSON.
Rear Admiral U. S. N.. Commander in
Chief, U. S. Naval Force, North Atlan
tic Squadron.
Naval Constructor R. P. Hobson, U. S.
Navy, U. S. S. New York.
About 5:30 o'clock Lieutenant Hobson
went to the White House to pay his re
srects to the President. Secretary Long
accompanied him. The President ve
ceived them in the Cabinet room. He
gave Lieutenant Hobson a most cor
dial greeting and paid him a high trib
ute for what he regarded as one of the
most conspicuous acts of gallantry in
the history of naval warfare.
After remaining with the President
for half an hour the Secretary and
Lieutenant Hobson left the White
House, the former going to his home
and the latter to the Army and Navy
Club. While at the White House Hob
son gave his autograph to a half dozen
or more solicitors, although, he re
marked, he could not imagine why they
desired it.
He is enthusiastic in his efforts to
save the ships and, declining to remain
in Washington for over a day, to-night
hurried back to New York to take up
the subject of his mission with the
wrecking company.
NEW YORK. July 22.â Lieutenant
Hobson, who took the Merrimac into
the channel at Santiago" arrived here
to-day on the St. Paul, and proceeded
at once to Washington. Lieutenant
Hobson said that he had inspected the
wrecked Spanish warships and he is
certain that, if prompt action is taken,
two of them, the Cristobal Colon and

Maria Teresa, may be saved. The
Oquendo is a total wreck. The Vizcaya
is not quite as bad as the Oquendo and
some of her guns may be secured.
"Should a gale spring up," added
Lieutenant Hobson, "all the work of the
wreckers would go for naught and the
Colon and the Teresa would be lost to
us. That is why I am hurrying to
Washington to explaiji to the officials
there the necessity of making contracts
at once for the raising of the warships.
They doubtless will do so when they
understand the situation as I can ex
plain it."

THE JUNIORS.
The National Council at its recent ses

for the home and 15 cents for general
purposes. The next council will meet in
Indianapolis. An effort will be made to
have the convention in California in 1900.
It was decided that whichever of the two |
Giants are those who are full of power. Power is another nama
for manliness. All men are given power when they are born. But many
men abuse nature's grandest and most valuable gifts. Have you been
guilty? If you have "Hudyan" will make up for your folly. "Hudyan"
restores to men who have been gluttonous a new digestion. To men
who have been wasting away it brings fresh vitality. To men who ara
weak it brings grand manly strength. It has done that, and never failed
to do it with an array of 21,000 patients. Circulars and testimonials
about it are sent to all who will ask for ihem. Medical advice on all
subjects is sent free. Will you have it? Why should you not be a phys.
ical giant, even if you are not one in stature? You can be, if you will
but try. Ask about "Hudyan." No cost to you.

OF SANTIAGO'S FALL
Issues n Proclamation Predicting
Disaster lor Americans if They
Attack Havana.
HAVANA. July 22.â Captain General
Dlanbo hM Issued the following proclu
mntlon, announcing the capitulation of
Santiago. It Is dated Havana. July
17:
"After three months' heroic defense
nnd many bloody combats, owing to i
si-.-uvlty of ammunition and victuals,
the |%ITtSOII of Santiago do Cuba has
boen forced to cnpltulate under houor
nble conditions and with the honors Of
war. This occurred on the 11th day Of
July% when it was jvcojsrnlsod by the
brsive Spanish froneral of the vllvlslon
Who whs acting commander Of the
I place that resistance, \\:\s useless and
that he could no longer hold the place.
Notwithstanding that reinforcements
had been possible, and though he
should receive such from Mansanlllo
and should still suffer further losses
and bloody combats; and might put the
city In a better condition of defense,
he was still face to face frith the tact
that reinforcements would only make
I further Inroads upon the already great*
iy consumed nnd nearly exhausted
{stonÂ» of provisions of tha Spanish jar
rtson. The city was thus placed In â 
| very lamentable condition. The situ
ation was anticipated, and caused creat
[depression to the Spanish tore i
I "The occupation of the elf of Santl*
jajro by the military forces of the A "'.i â :â¢
i leans is lacking in strategic importance
owini to the fact : that the city had
i previously been blockaded for a long
I time by thÂ« American ships, and will
I have little or no effect on the develop
ment of the Spanish campaign which
Ms to decide Spain's fate. The Spanish
j army is Intact and tacer for glory. It
;It willing to measure arms with the
(Americans, and on this army the King
lof Spain, the Spanish Government and
i the hole country i lac i the trust of
.defense at any cost of the integrity of
) Spanish territory and the honor of
I Spain's Immaculate flag.
'This army Is sun to be triumphant
jan I victorious. At the last, In spite
of so man] dangers and Impedimenta,
I that it will show puce more the Indom*
I Itable spirit and vreU-knovrn military
talents .-'. our people is the hope and

DARK PLOT OF
THE REA GANG
School Superintendent
Their Victim.
TRY TO RUIN HIS CHARACTER
THE CUNNING TRICK PROVES A
BOOMERANG.
Sau Jose Citizens of All Parties Unite
in Condemning This Latest
Rascality of tho
Biitfttan.
SAX JOSE. July 81.â The attempt of
BOM Reii to besmirch the character of
County Superintendent of Schools L. T.
; Chi] man by Insinuations of dishonesty
, li proving i boomerang; and the best
olttsens of the city and county are con
demning this last move of the boss.
For twenty years Chipman has been
Superintendent of Schools, and In all
: that time not one breath of dishonesty
has been uttered against him. The
proceedings at Tuesday's meeting of
the Board of Supervisors was â  revela
tion to the good people of the city, for
In the transaction they say that the
gang that rules our schools will stop
at nothing to carry their purpose.
The bill of $"4 TO for expense ac
count, presented by Chipman, is just
and correct, and he can present the
bills of those with whom the expense
was Incurred to support It- There is
some doubt now as to whether Chip
maÂ» is not entitled to bis salary as sec
retary of the Board of Education every
time thÂ« board meets whether he is
present or not, as he has to perform
certain duties after each meeting. it
wks on his bill for $120 for services as
secretary that Boas Ken, with the .v.d
of Supervisors a..<: Stern, ayes and
Rea, tried to show that there was dis
honest Intent on Chtpman*s part to
draw money from the co-juty for work
not performed. Chipmaa had made a
mistake In copying his bill, .--â . ; . had
charged traveling expenses for visiting
county schools on the same days that
he had charged for his services is sec
retary of the Board of Education.
The attempted expose was prear
ranged and was the culmination of one
v' the most cunning pieces of political
work ever done in the city. The Su
pervisors did Rea's bidding, and SO did
H. M. Bland. EJmer Brownell and Miss
F&tt*y, members of the County Board
of Education. The gang had been
Wailing for an opportunity to "roll 1 "
Chtpman. because in Â»1! his years In
ofik-e he has held aloof from them and
has not taken orders, Mis* Farley and
BrovrseH .... similar charges in
their tails, ... they were allowed to
correct them. Not so -with Chipman.
When he examined the law and found
there was some dwabt as to being en
titled to seven days' â MS â he want
ed to reel -". by deducting this
smount from the $1W charges! Instead
the members \ce.re cste-d to appear and
testimony was taken .-.?'. whether

EXTENSION OF
THE BLOCKADE
Now in Effect as far East
as Nipe
NORTHERN COAST GUARDED
COALING STATION SOON WILL
BE ESTABLISHED.
Flagship San Francisco Reports the
Need of Light-Draught Boats
to Cruise in Among the
Cuban Keys.
Special Dijpntch to The Call.
KEY WEST, July 22.â The San Fran
cisco arrived at Key West at I o'clock
this morning She will coal and return
to her blockading duties. The flagshfp
came directly from Nipe, the blockade
having been extended along the north
ern coast of Cuba to that point- This
has been done in accordance with or
ders received on July 11. On that day
the flagship, together with the Prairie,
Badger, Topeka and Maple, started
from Off Havana in order to extend the
blockade. It was a foregone conclu
sion at the time that Santiago would
"capitulate shortly. It was thought
Pan would probably tall back to Hol
e.::" and make bis way from there to
Nipe or Nuevitas and thence go by
boats along the keys that stretch
along the northern coast to Sagrua la
Grande or Cardenas and then by rail to
Havana, la order to prevent supplies
reaching Pando and to cut off his re
treat the extension of the blockade was
determined upon.
It Is the intention to establish a coal
ing station somewhere: along the east
ern â¢ art of the northern coast and a
point near Klpe probably will be se
lected. There is urgent need of some
light river boats which could be sent
Into the keys between Xuevitas and
Cardenas in order to destroy commerce
that is carried on under their protec
tion. It Is supposed Pando has left a
number of shallow water boats within
these keysâ the boats which he used as
transports In going- to Santiaco and
which he will us again should he at
tempt to retreat to Havana.

CASTOR I A
LIST OF LOST
IS SHELLING
Effect of That Storm on
Fraser River.
WORSE THAN WAS EXPECTED
TWENTY-FIVE FISHERMEN ARE
MISSING.
Fully Three Thousand Boats Caught
in the Gale of a Few Days Ago.
Great Destruction of
Property.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. July 22.â The
disaster which overtook the salmon
fishers near the mouth of Fraser River
has turned out to be even worse than
first expected. A reporter to-day visited
the scene and learned that fully 3,000
boats were caught in the gale of t^ree
days ago. The whole Fraser River
rteet was out at the time and it appears
â : that the storm came up without a mo
ment's warning. Many of the boats
were strung together and when i the
! storm cloud burst over them they, were
dashed against each other with such
force as to either demolish them out

BRIGADIER GKNERAT, HARRI
SON GRAY OTIS, accompanied
by his superb staff of young and
capable officers, went aboard the
steamship Rio Janeiro yesterday, but
will return to dry land early this morn
ing to hold a conference with Major
General Merriam. commanding the De
partment of California. The Depart
ment commander will Impart to Gen
eral Otis the customary instructions
and suggestions and then express the
wish thut thÂ»> Brigadier and his men
may have a delightful voyage to the
Philippines.
At the conclusion of the interview
General Otis will return to the ship.
According to orders the sailing hour is
P (.â .Mock this morning, but little over
sights h^r<> and thore may prevent the
Rio fr.mi sailing promptly at that hour.
Two battalions of the South Dakota
reg'mont of volunteers sail on the Rio

sail on the St. Paul next week.
SOUTH DAKOTA MEN.
Two Battalions March From
Camp Merr.tt and Embark
on the Rio Janeiro.
Colonel Frost, with the Second and
Third Battalions of the First South Da
kota Regiment, marched forth from Camp
Merrltt at 8 o'clock yesterday morning,
and by noon had his men carefully stowed
away aboard the Rio Janeiro, lying at the
Pacific Mall dock. The march to tho
dock was devoid of incident, excepting
that the same enthusiastic cheers and
farewells greeted the boys as they
marched along the line. To this day
no finer or better disciplined regiment of
men has marched out of camp.
A detachment of fifty-three men from
th<- signal corps followed Colonel Frost
and his command along the line of march.
The route taken waa as announced in The
Call of yesti rday; along California to Cen
tral avenue, down Post street "v Market
and out Second street to the Mall dock.

Before the Rio dropped out into the

that Genera] < 'tis knocked out the par

f rnewhat contracted the accommodations

tnpted his quarters by direction of
"'."neral Otis. Colonel Frost Insisted on
â¢:hts under the original order issued
by Major General Merriam. and after a
short parley carried his point and sus
tained th*' dignity of his rank.
It was explained to Colonel Frost that
tho order reassigning the quarters was
Issued by Adjutant Edward Murphy with-
OUt the knowledge of General Otis, but
this was denied and the statement made
that General Otis dictated the order. The
Incident did not provoke any bad feel

toward getting the regiment out on tar

Of the State are members of the regiment
and the officers want to get all of the
men familiar with their guns before they
have to use them In battle. Something
like 900 new Springfield rifles wee re
ceived to-day by Quartermaster Lieuten
ant Heller, and they will be issued to the
men at once. The captains have been or
dered to pick out all of their good shots
and report them to regimental headquar
ters, while the untried are to be taken
out for target practice.
The various companies of the regiment
have an average of about IT>OO rounds of
fixed ammunition which is available for
target work. The Alameda range near
Bay Farm Island has been secured and in
a short time a company will use it each
day. Recruits will tire at 100 and 200 yards
until they get the necessary practice to
pull the trigger without moving the gun,
after which they will be instructed in
long distance firing at the target. Only
about twenty out of each 100 have rifle

Major Ruhlen, quartermaster of the ex

Philippines this morning on the City of

more needed hf>re than at Manila. Major
Ruhlen has proved himself a Very en< r

of the fleets that have left this city he
has done an immense amount of work.
He may be able, however, to close up

NEW TIMBER LANDS.
The President Has Enlarged the
Southern Forest Reservation.
President McKlnley has evidently marl*
a careful study of the subject of forestry
on the Pacific Coast and concluded that
In the preservation of timber lies the
future of the West. Several times since
he has been at the head of national :if
fairs he has taken out of the public do
main large tracts of land, which he has
added to the forest reservations. In dis
cussing this matter with several of the
representatives of this State, the Presi
dent has said that he knows that once
the lands of the State are stripped of their
timber the Western slope will be as bar
ren as that of Peru and the. South Ameri
can countries. It Is well known that
wherever the forests are thickest the
rains fall most freely and the adjacent
country is sure of an abundance of water
for crops. He proposes to do all in his
power to preserve the timber of the We.st.
In keeping with this policy, he has set
aside a number of new tracts recently for
forest purposes. The latest enlarges the
Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake forest res
ervation in the southern part of the State.
The President's proclamation has just
been received by Surveyor General
Cleaves in this city. The reservation be
fore being 1 enlarged comprised 1,159/(00
acres, and the addition increases it by

on the St. Paul are the Third Battalion
of the First South Dakota, recruits for
the First Colorado and the Thirteenth
Minnesota, and a detachment of the
Signal Corps, but It having been found
that this assignment is somewhat too
large for the vessel a rearrangement is
being made.
The troops that are to go on the
Arizona ;u:d the Scandia have not yet
been named, but the matter is under con
sideration. Both the Seventh California
and the Fift-y-first lowa hope to be as
signed to these vessels. The Arizona will
be docked to-day.
The Centennial, which has been twice
rejected, has again been offered as a
transport, and has again been examined.
The report of tho examining board has
I'cen forwarded to "Washington by Major
Long, the depot quartermaster, who is
not at liberty to state tho conclusions ar
rived at by the board.
The City of Peking was chartered for
seventy days, with the understanding
that if she was not returned to her
regular run at the expiration of that
pi rlod she was to be employed by the
' ". â¢ rnment for another seventy days.
In case she does not return here in time
to resume regular service she will there
fore very likely make another trip as a
transport to Manila.
TROOPS AT THE PRESIDIO
Brigadier General M. P. Miller
Takes Command of the
Post.
Lieutenant Colonel Louis T. Morris
formally resigned from the service of the
army at 11 o'clock yesterday morning,
when he turned over the Presidio to
Brigadier General Marcus P. Miller, who
will havo temporary command. There
was no formality or ceremony attendant
upon the transfer of the post. General
Millar and Colonel Morris met in the
office of the latter, and the necessary
papers were signed by the former officer
receipting for all the Government prop
erty of the post. In less than twenty
minutes the transfer had been made, and
Colonel Morris' responsibility as an offi
cer was at an end and General Miller
had assumed command. He will make no
507,000 acres. The bulk of the addition is
on the eastern end of the original, and it
now forms the connecting link with the
San Gabriel forest reservation. This
makes ;t complete chain of reservations,
extending along the Coast Range Moun
tains from the southern part of San Luis
Obiapo County to the middle of San Diego
County. These reservations, in their or
der, arp; I'ine Mountain and Zaca Lake,
San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San
Jacinto.
It is learned that in the very near future
the President will set aside several more
timber tracts in the eastern and north
eastern parts of the State, but the exact
locations are not now known. This taking
from the public domain of so much land
is likely to bring the lieu-land settlers to
the front. There were quite a number of
settlers on the Government lands recently
Withdrawn for forest reservations, and, of
course, these will be looking all over the
State for desirable places on which to
locate again.
GOLDEN GATE LODGE WINS.
Judge Seawcll Declares It a Legally
Incorporated Organization.
Golden Gate I,odge No. 6 of the Benev
olent Protective Order of Elks secured a
victory In Judge Sea well' a court yester
day. A decision was handed In the fruit of
tli<' people in the relation of Lewis C.
Weathefly against the lodge, which was
brought some time ago to terminate the
existence of the corporate powers of the
organization on the contention that it
was never legally incorporated. Judge
Beawell held, boweyer, that the lodge was
legally incorporated under section 594 of
the Code, which is specially applicable
to nil fraternal organizations.
Tho suit was the culmination of a con
tention which occurred several years ago
and resulted in the lodge being expelled
from the National Order of Elks. The
charter of Golden Gate Lodge was trans
ferred by the officials of the. national or
dÂ«-r to Ran Francisco Lodge. "Golden Gate
Lodge was not to be outdone, however,
and in order to give it legal existence ar
ticles of incorporation were filed. Judge
Seawell has determined that, notwith
standing the fact that the national order
does not recognise 'iolden Gate Lodge, it
is a legally incorporated body and enti
tled to all the benefits thereof.

of the Presidio post, drew an exceedingly
large crowd yesterday afternoon. The
concert was at 3 o'clock, under the di

were rendered by the band in a highly
artistic manner. Guard mount, which is
held at the post every morning at 10:30

NEW CYCLING WONDER,
CHAMPION FRANK GIBSON PECK-
BY his performances at Sacramento
on July 4, Frank Gibson Peck
stamped himself as the most prom
ising amateur cyclist on the coast.
Without any of the care that a crack
racing man should have had he met and
defeated John E. Wir.g, the champion of
the coast, and others. There seemed no
limit to his speed, as he sailed away from
his opponents without apparent effort.
The new cycling wonder was born in
Yuba City, and is not yet 18 years of age.
He grauated with honors from the
Marysville High School last month. He
took to cycling three years since and
proved a natural rider, soon showing that
he was possessed of a remarkable turn
of speed. It was not long until his fame
had spread beyond his own district. The
prominent clubs of this city, eager to
strengthen their racing teams, soon made
overtures to him.
He cast his fortunes with the Bay City
Wheelmen and has ever since sported the
Maltese cross of that organization. He
has raced with varying success, but par
ticularly distinguished himself In the an
Heuer, of the engineer corps. In charge of
the San Francisco harbor mines, in re
gard to removing the explosives that have
been placed In the, bay under his super
vision. "I have received no Instructions
In regard to removal of the mines," said
Major Heuer yesterday, "and, therefore,
shall proceed to finish the work which I
was ordered to do. The war is not yet
ended."
EIGHTH ARMY CORPS.
Efforts to Collect Alimony From
a California Recruitâ Brigade
Court Martial Ordered.
Since the 20th of the month searching
inquiries have been made at Camp Merritt
for Private George Aubertin, a recruit of
the First California Volunteers. The In
quiries were instigated by the divorced
wife of Aubertin, who is shy two months'
alimony.
Mrs. Aubertin, who '.3 in destltute~cYr"
cumstances, brought"her troubles before
the Humane Society. The society re
ported the matter to General Merrlam
who sent down, through General Miller
to Brigadier General King instructions to
search Aubertin out.

fastest ten miles in the race. His most
notable performance was the reduction
of the half-mile coast record on May 30.
The trial was made on the Marysville
track, which was far from being fast.
He covered the distance in 57 seconds, a
clever performance. With ordinary op
portunities for competition it Is thought
that Feck would rank with the great
riders, both amateur and professional,
who have made names for themselves on
the race path in this State.
POLHEMUS CASE
IS ADJUDICATED
JUDGE SEAWELL DECIDES IN
DEFENDANT'S FAVOR.
The Claim Lacked Merit and the
Statute of Limitations Had Run
Against the Plaintiff.
A decision In the case of Charles R. j
Polhemus against Antonio Borel, executor
of the estate of Charles Moyne, was
handed down by Judge Seawell yester
day. The suit was brought for an ac
counting of the transfer by Polhemus
to Moyne in June, 1869. of 4365 shares of
the stock of the San Francisco and San
Jose Railroad Company, standing in the
names of Donohue, Newhall & Polhemus.
At a subsequent date another transfer of
fiOO shares of stock was made, for which
Moyne advanced Polhemus $20,000.
Many years later, when Moyne was still
alive, however, Polhemus brought suit
and alleged that a satisfactory settlement
had never been effected, and that the
transfer of the stock was brought about
by fraud and misrepresentation. Since !
that time the case has been constantly !
before the courts, and was finally sub
mitted about five months ago. Many of
San Francisco's most brilliant attorneys
appeared in the action, which involved
several hundred thousand dollars. Dur
ing the long trial the books and docu
ments of Donohue. Newhall & Polhemus
and those of the San Francisco and San
Jose Railroad Company were produced
In court, and many days were occupied
in their examination. From the facts
gathered by the musty volumes the court
found Its decision.
It was held that the argument of plain
| tiff's counsel to the effect that the trans
fer had been made to facilitate business
was inconsistent with the allegation that
it had been obtained by fraud. The evi
dence in the case also pointed to the fact
that a complete settlement had been
reached by the parties as far back as
1867; that Moyne held certain notes signed
by Polhemus, and that on receipt of the
shares of stock at the time of the trans
fer he gave them up. Afterward, in order
that further litigation might be avoided,
THE HONOLULU GARRISON.
Colonel Barber, Who Is to Be the Commandant,
Will Probably Be Made a Brigadier
General.
It Is very likely that Colonel Barber, of the First New York Regiment
of Volunteers, who is to be commandant of the new military post at Hono
lulu, will soon be made a brigadier general, probably before his departure
for the Hawaiian Islands. In addition to his own regiment, he will have
under his command the Hawaiin troops, numbering over 500 men,
and the Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of United States Volun
teer Engineers. This battalion of engineers numbers about 400 men, and
Has been stationed for some weeks at the Presidio. It is in command of
Major Langfitt.
The order assigning the battalion to duty at Honolulu came from the
War Department yesterday, and was made upon the recommendation of
General Merriam. It will sail with the first detachment of the New York
regiment and will at once be put at work upon arrival in preparing the
new post. The command is composed of Company I of Denver. Company X of
Salt Lake, Company Li of San Francisco and Company M of Portland, Or.
The colonel of the regiment, Willard Young, is in Chicago, where the regi
mental headquarters and the First and Second battalions are located.
General Merriam has ordered the purchase and shipment of lumber
necessary for the Honolulu post. Among the New Yorkers are several
architects, civil engineers, carpenters, painters and mechanics of all kinds,
â whose services will, no doubt, be called into requisition in erecting the
buildings and doing other work incidental to the establishment of the
post.
Captain Philip Lydlg of New York, who was recently appointed chief
purchasing agent at Honolulu, arrived in the city yesterday morning and
reported for duty to General Merriam. He has been in the volunteer ser
vice two months, and was transferred from Chiekamauga. At Honolulu
he will tind plenty to do for a few months, as a great many purchases
are to be made for the military post that is to be established there. Cap
tain Lydig is a well-known New York society man, and had the honor of
performing the duty of groomsman at Clarence Mackay's wedding.

c "MEfISLEY" MISTAKE.
BY one of the curious errors which sometimes
excite grief in a newspaper office, the types got
mixed in the making up of yesterday morning's
paper. A part of an article about the local military
camp and the sickness among the soldiers got an
nexed to an account of the jolly time the League of
the Cross Cadets are having at Camp Montgomery at
Santa Rosa. The consequence was the statement that
there were eighty cases of measles among the boys,
whereas there are no measles, have not been, nor any
sickness of any kind, and the boys arc enjoying the
lest of health.
Similar instances of confusion will occur in every
printing establishment, and the rarity of them, consid
ering the haste with which work must be done, is a
marvel.
YELLOW JOURNALISTS EXILED.
YELLOW journalists have, by order of General
Shafter. been expelled from Cuba. The com
mander of the American forces there could not
have taken a single step which would have been more
to his credit. Into exile and disgrace must go every
representative of the New York Journal and the San
Francisco Examiner. Their presence at the seat of
war had been borne with wonderful patience. Their
malign falsehoods, their impertinent meddling, their
spread of misleading information, designed to be
wilder the army as well as the public, had become
an intolerable nuisance. They have richly earned
the humiliation. Liars, michief makers, a reproach
to civilization, a blemish upon the profession they
pretend to follow, it is well that they should have
received a lesson.
Xo excoriation reached them. They were appar
ead to all sense of shame, but to be pronounced
unfit to associate with soldiers and gentlemen, to be
ordered away like unclean hangers-on of the camp,
is an experience so degrading that it must touch
even them. Traitors to their country, seeking fur
ther to embroil it, to stir strife to new bitterness, to
insult officers and the dignity of Government,
they have been stripped of their power for ill. If
they have latent within them some lingering instinct
of decency they must feel as did Dreyfus when, be
fore the assembled troops; he was shorn of his weap
ons. We congratulate Hearst that he had enrolled
himself among the precious band. We commiserate
the people of the United States that the exiles must
come back to these shores. However, they will
no more be able to annoy the public and harass the
army.
Now let a fresh wreath of laurel be placed above
the picture of General Shafter over the door of the
Examiner; yes. make it two wreaths. A great moral
victory has been achieved.
According to General Garcia the report that Gen
eral Shafter refused to permit Cubans to enter Santi
ago for fear there would be massacre and looting is
too ridiculous for belief. According to an unbiased
view from a distance there is nothing ridiculous about
it, and it has every aspect of solemn truth.
An evening paper makes known the important fact
that the indigent dead are to escape the war tax.
Possibly the dead not indigent will regard this as
special legislation, but no protest has yet been heard
from them.
Blanco claims that he did not consent to the sur
render of Santiago. A little later, however, he will
consent to the surrender of Havana, and there will
be no opportunity for squirming out of it.
Up to the time of going to press the latest infor
mation from Wells-Fargo was that the company ex
pected the public to continue paying the corpora
tion's war tax.
A Spanish cruiser "on a secret mission" is reported.
No secret about it. The only possible mission of a
Spanish cruiser is to keep out of the way of an Amer
ican cruiser.
"A London dispatch to the New York Journal
says," etc. But what possible difference what a dis
patch to that sheet from London or anywhere else
may say?
If Spain divide the remnant of her navy as she now
insanely threatens, the American battle-ships will at
tend to continuing the division to the fragmentary
stage.
It is to- be hoped that the report that Spain intends
to add to her shame by court-martialing Toral is un
true. The general is not to blame for not being a fool.
Another man has jokingly pointed a pistol at his
own breant and died with every evidence of the most
absolute earnestness
THE PINTO COMMITTEE.
WHEN the Inopportune State Committee
adopted the advice of the Examiner that the
Democracy of San Francisco could not be
trusted to hold an open primary, it was evident that
authority was to be usurped to carry out v Pinto
programme for the production of a piebald ticket.
There followed the arbitrary appointment of the
committee of one hundred and its usurpation of all
party authority in this city, with power to appoint
delegates and nominate tickets. There was in ex
istence a regular party committee, with title derived
from the people, but this was set aside. Among the
solemn oaths of the one hundred was an engagement
to not instruct for any candidates, nor advance any
personal fortunes.
There was opposition among Populists and Demo
crats to fusion. A Populist convention, representing
one-half the counties of the State, met, divided
nearly evenly and split into two parties. One nomi
nated Maguire for Governor on a Populist platform.
The other nominated Shanahan on the same platform.
In the coming Democratic convention San Francisco
will hold the control. The vote of her delegation
will nominate candidates and install programmes.
That delegation will be appointed by the committee
of one hundred. That committee was not "in
structed" for Maguire. It has merely "indorsed"
him. It will appoint a solid Maguire delegation, of
course. So the Pinto programme is pushed. The
party is to take its candidate from the Populists. He
is to be chosen without primary reference to the peo
ple who are expected to elect him.
It would be difficult to invent a series of intrigues
and incidents more at variance with popular govern
ment, more at war with every consideration of party
honor. It is a brazen advertisement that a party
which is not fit to be trusted within reach of a pri
mary ballot-box, and is condemned by its leaders,
is fit to control a State and local administration of
public affairs 1
The Call does not think that meanly of the Democ
racy of this State, for the party has not yet indorsed
its leaders' verdict of dishonesty and unfitness. If a
ticket so nominated is supported heartily by the
party, that verdict of guilty will be self-indorsed and
the people will be warned against an organization
which confesses its unfitness to govern itself and at
the same time affirms its fitness to govern the State.
It remains to be seen what the old liners will do.
When Dr. Glenn was the candidate of such a Pinto
combination General Jo Hamilton was requested to
stump the State for the ticket, and he replied, "I
have stumped the State many times Tor a Democrat,
but never for a half-breed." The men who were
Democrats from principle may feel a good deal like
the old war-horse of Placer.
DISCONTENTED CUBANS.
GARCIA'S letter to General Shafter announcing
that he had tendered his resignation as com
mander of the Cuban army at Santiago, and
that pending the action ot the Cuban Government
upon it he would withdraw his troops to the interior,
was the first important step on the part of the Cubans
in a course destined to bring them into conflict with
the United States. A more decisive step was taken
latter, when an attack was made upon a detachment
oi Spanish troops marching to Santiago to sur
render.
Garcia stated his reasons for resigning with clear
ness and considerable force. He was appointed to the
command of the Cuban army of the east, as he says,
with instructions from what he calls "the Government
of the Republic," to co-operate with the American
army. That duty he claims to have fulfilled as best
he could, but he complains that he was not consulted
by General Shafter with regard cither to the sur-
render of Santiago or its administration since. He
protests against leaving the city under the civil con
trol of the former authorities appointed by the Span
ish Government, and asserts that since it is impossible
for him to co-operate with the United States army
under such conditions, his resignation becomes im
perative.
The letter and the protest would have been more
effective if Garcia or his Cubans had ever genuinely
co-operated with our army before the capture of
Santiago. It is a matter of common fame that they
were expected to do so, but completely failed to ful
fill the expectation. They took no part in the fight
ing of the skirmish line as it cleared the way for the
main body of our troops. Neither did they join in
the direct attack upon the Spanish entrenchments
when the battle began in earnest. Nor would they
aid in the toilsome work of constructing roads for
the passage of the artillery from the coast to positions
on the hills from which they could command the
lines of the enemy.
These offenses of omission, however, are as noth
ing to the crime committed in the attack upon prison
eis of war. It is now difficult to see how Garcia can
be treated as other than an outlaw. The United
States cannot tolerate attacks upon prisoners who
had surrendered to its arms. Garcia has violated the
law of nations and of civilization and must pay the
penalty.
It is the fault of the Cubans themselves, therefore,
that they have lost the right to co-operate with our
army. Neither the people nor the troops of the
United States were prejudiced against them. On the
contrary, all the preconceived ideas of our people
were in their favor. Congress, in fact, came very
near recognizing their independent nationality and
sending an army there to uphold it. Had Garcia and
his followers shown any merit whatever this country
would have been only too glad to recognize it. Their
own acts have been the causes that have made co
operation impossible.
It must be borne in mind, moreover, that citizens
of the United States have great property interests in
the province of Santiago, and it is the duty of our
officers to provide a safe government for their pro
tection. As has been pointed out, our army landed
at a dock built by an American mining company; the
Bethlehem Iron Works own the railway from San
tiago to the manganese mines at San Luis; the
Juragua Mining Company is a Carnegie enterprise;
the Sigua Iron Company is American, and so on
through a long list, including railways and sugar
plantations and other properties. Mr. Rubens, the
Junta lawyer, estimates the American interests in the
surrendered territory at over $30,000,000.
This is more property than the Cubans own in that
province, and it is too valuable to be exposed to the
danger of civil disturbance. If the Cubans desire recog
nilior from our Government the way for them to ob
tain it is to march against Havana, and by action
in open and honorable war show that their troops are
capable of constructing military roads, fighting
battles, maintaining discipline, and performing other
deeds that are required of the armies of civilized na
tions.
The fact is worthy of note that several prominent
Republicans have not announced themselves as can
didates for the governorship. With nothing but
Magnire in the way, the prospect is tempting.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 23, 1898.
BUILDING AND LOON ASSOCIATION
COMMISSIONERS.
THE California State League of Mutual Build
ing and Loan Associations should lose no time
in taking energetic steps toward reforming or
abolishing the present worthless and expensive State
Board of Building and Loan Commissioners. The
league should be prepared when the Legislature as
sembles, next January, to have a Dili introduced
which will amend or repeal the present law, under
which a building and loan association secretary, like
Alsip of Sacramento, can rob shareholders without
danger of detection or exposure from the salaried
State officials, under whose supervision these associ
ations are placed.
At the second annual convention of the State
League of Mutual Building and Loan Associations
one of the delegates predicted that the position of
Commissioner would be sought for and filled by poli
ticians utterly incompetent to make an expert exam
ination of the books and affairs of a building and
loan association. The bill prepared by Mr. A. Sbar
boro of this city, and adopted by the convention in
October, 1802, provided for the appointment by the
Governor of only otu Commissioner, who should be
thoroughly competent to discharge all the duties of
the office.
Several delegates in the convention commented
upon the difficulty the Governor would experience
in discovering a man properly equipped by ex
perience and talent to fill the role of Commissioner.
Governor Markham, instead of being appalled by
the difficulty of finding on* expert in the business,
suggested that the bill should be so amended as to
make it two Commissioners, and also a secretary,
which was accordingly done, and he thus found snug
berths for three of his political friends, whose ca
pacity and fitness for the office time alone would de
velop. Politicians' ways of solving problems are not
likely to improve (as officers and stockholders of
building and loan associations have, no doubt, by
this time discovered), and so it will continue that
twa#Commissioners who know little or nothing of
the business will draw comfortable salaries for per
mitting their secretary, an expert with half a Com
missioner's salary, to do nearly all the work of the
office. No wonder then that the secretary is tempted,
when in the discharge of official duties, to add to his
salary by accepting remuneration as a non-official ac
countant from the party whose interest it is to ob
tain a favorable or whitewashing report. The law
should be amended so that no one could be ap
pointed Commissioner unless competent to expert
books and accounts of building and loan associations.
One Commissioner is enough to do the work, be
cause experience has shown that the secretary is prac
tically the commission. He should be compelled to
give his undivided attention to the duties of his
office, and not be permitted to engage in any other
business during his term.
These amendments are right in line with the ideas
of the men who drafted the original bill, which self
seeking politicians subsequently altered to suit their
purposes.
The expenses of this commission are saddled on
the building and loan associations of the State, and
stockholders are chafing under the burthen. They
feel it the more when they realize that their money
does not bring them the protection or results ex
pected.
The stockholders of the building and loan associa
tions of California can count upon the earnest co
operation of The Call in their efforts to remedy ex
isting abuses.
THE OGNEWS SCANDAL.
OUR efforts to let the light in upon the scan
dalous management of the Asylum for the In
sane at Agnews has, as usual, brought the
$30,000 railroad contract organ to the front as a de
fender of corruption. This is not at all surprising,
since that boodling sheet would be out of its element
without some unsavory job of throwing dust in the
eyes of the public on hand. The fact that the con
tract organ is now belittling the charges against Dr.
Sponogle and his subordinates, and charging their
accusers with corruption, is only an additional evi
dence that its genius for chicanery in compelling it
to engage in every dirty mess on the wrong side is
overpowering.
To those who have perused The Call's exposures
of the Agnews Asylum rottenness we need say noth
ing. Extreme care has been taken in preparing the
articles to publish only verified facts, attested by com
petent witnesses. Nothing resembling prejudice or
interest has dictated the course we have pursued.
Our purpose, as the work itself shows, has been to
illuminate a regrettable scandal, which has long
been public property, for the purpose of bringing
about a reformation. The statement of the organ that
somebody's interest has effected the exposure is
characteristic of a sheet which blackmails railroad
corporations, and, after receiving $22,000 for twenty
two months' silence, sells out to some other party and
repudiates its contract. A boodler who will not stay
bought is capable of any infamy.
It is not necessary to comment extensively upon
the treatment accorded to the Agnews scandal by the
contract organ. The degraded position it assumes
could only be the result of a corrupt motive, and there
is reason to believe that it has been sold out again.
The organ stamps the scandal as the result of a "po
litical quarrel" between two Democrats, and inti
mates that one of the Democrats has a little the bet
ter of it because he has been able to call a few Re
publicans to his assistance. Its attempt to create the
impression that Boss Rea of San Jose is taking sides
with The Call in this matter is dictated by the same
spirit. The sheet desires to belittle the charges as
as preliminary to a whitewashing investigation, the
foundation of which it is laying in its usual
boodlesque style.
The charges published by The Call, however, can
not be brushed aside in this way. They disclose
scandalous management at Agnews, and somebody
will have to give them attention or other reputations
than that of Dr. Sponogle and the contract organ
will suffer. If they are left for the next Legislature
to investigate a great deal of embarrassment may be
experienced in keeping politics out of the asylum. In
our opinion the Governor and State Lunacy Com
mission should give the Agnews institution a fair
and honest overhauling, notwithstanding the cold
water that will from now on be thrown upon the
affair by the railroad contract sheet. A thorough
cleaning out will be best for the people and all par
ties concerned.
Oakland survivors of the recent explosion object
to the rebuilding of a death factory In their midst,
and perhaps with some show of reason. Everybody
recognize* that bodily dissolution . is inevitable, but
the prejudice against being dissolved all over the
country is universal.
If Americans fail to remember the Maine now they
will be obliged to put in some time wondering what
we are fighting for in Cuba.
THE POLICE TORTURE CHAMBER.
T OCHNER was under a flre of
I cross-examination all day yes-
I terday, but he stuck to his orig-
I 4 Inal story of the tragedy. Last
night he was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, and given a
narcotic to settle his nerves."
This is not a passage from one t)f
Gaborleau's famous detective novels,
nor is It even a quotation from one of
Zola's eloquent denunciations of
French judicial methods. It Is simply
a piece of plain, every-day journalese,
taken from the columns of The Call.
Similar statements have appeared In
other newspapers in this city. For sev
eral days this Informal and Illegal ex
amination has been "going on, and even
the police themselves can hardly deny
the fact.
Let me state at the outset that I
have nothing whatever to do with the
guilt or innocence of Lochner. "Wheth
er he did or did not strangle Mrs. Car
penter, whether his character be clean
or unclean, is not the question to be
considered here. In the light of true
justice, every man is innocent until
he is lawfully found guilty.
What I want to know is â Who ap
pointed of Police Lees a Judge
destruction? It Is significant that
there is no English word to express the
office, the institution being peculiarly
French. By what right, moral or con
stitutional, does a mere Captain of
Police assume the authority to Intro
duce, into this free land, one of the
most pernicious of the many bad feat
ures which so markedly distinguish
the Latin from the Anglo-Saxon sys
tem of judicial administration?
More than seven centuries ago the
barons of England met at Runnymede
and wrested from an ignore and un
willing King, the Magna Charta, which
through all these centuries has been
the mainstay of Anglo-Saxon liberty.
True, it was but a victory of the nobles
over the Monarch, the great mass of
the people still remained in the same
wretched and enserfed condition. But
the lesson was not lost upon the na
tion, and from that day forward every
modification of the unwritten English
constitution meant the imposition of
further limitations upon the kingly
power. And so, three hundred years
ago, the great habeas corpus principle,
which was but rudely outlined In the
Magna Charta, was crystallized into an
Act of Parliament, to which the faith
ful Commons, using their power over
the royal purse as a lever, wrung the
reluctant consent of the weak Charles
11.
Thus, through the ages, our Anglo-
Saxon race has ever been in the fore
front of freedom, has ever been first,
and often alone, in the task of ennob
ling and raising the enslaved of the
world to a sense of their oÂ».n manhood.
To-day Europe notes with astonish
ment, not unmlngled with awe, the
fact that this rreat nation has entered
actively upon the same noble crusade.
We are risking the lives of our noblest
and best, we are pouring forth our
treasure like water, in a cause which
seems to the Latin races Quixotic, be
cause, forsooth, they have never learnt
the true mear ig of the word liberty.
These nations, crushed under their
weight of military despotism, look on
in sullen protest, yet none dare inter
fere, for they know that it is not only
the United States which they will have
to fight when the cause of humanity is
at stake.
By the side of the great struggle
which is now going on, the case of a
miserable wretch like Lochner may
seem about as important as a worm on
j Mount Shasta. Yet his treatment by
I the police, and the treatment of many
others like him, indicates a growing
danger which the people of the United
States cannot afford to neglect. Hav
ing never known the burdens of tyr
| army, having never been oppressed by
I cruel and unscrupulous despots, the cit
! izens of the Union are apt to be lax
jin the watchfulness wnich alone can
i purchase true freedom. When the thir
teen States of the new world wrested
their independence from England, it
was with the view of increasing rather
than restricting the liberty of their
citizens. All the best features of the
English constitution, and among them
the great habeas corpus principle, were
embodied in the American law, there
to remain for all time, as a significant
tribute to the nation from which we
inherit our laws and our language. And
i 6ince the creation of the American con
stitution nearly all its best features
have become part of the law of
j land, so that to-day there is practically
no distinction between the freedom
which each State grants its citizens.
The difference is one in name only.
How is it, then, that the people of
this State sit quietly quiescent, while
j an irresponsible police official violates
at his own sweet will the first princi
; pie upon which the individual freedom .
|of each citizen is based? It is not the
! first time that Chief Lees has done it.
We read of the same thing whenever
the Police Department, in its bungling
way, is striving vainly to unravel some '
great criminal mystery. We hear of
this method, which is commonly known
as the "sweating process" being tried
every time a miserable being, who may
or may not have had anything to do
! with the case, is unlucky enough to fall
into the hands of the police. If the
President himself were to openly vio-
I late the constitution in such a flagrant
j way the whole nation would rise in re- j
i volt, and, therefore, I can hardly see i
i why the license should be allowed to a
petty police captain.
Apparently, Chief Lees' one idea of
detecting crime is to select some lndl
| vidual whom he vaguely thinks might
; have had something to do with the
; case. He openly defies the law by
j keeping the man under arrest without i
I bringing any formal charge against ;
' him, and then, from sheer inability to I
conceive any better detective plan, re- j
sorts to the sweating process. Day j
after day the suspected individual is j
brought from his cheerless cell to the i
captain's cozy office. There he is bul- j
lied and brow beaten, cross examined
in every possible way, in the hope that â¢
he may at last be induced to drop some
phrase which may be twisted into a
confession; or to give some hint which I
may furnish the detectivesâ groping ;
blindly in their inability to do their
own work for themselves â with a clew '
\ to the real identity of the murderer, i
For the suspected man is rarely the j
i real offender, and the police, in most
! instances, know it.
Except for the fact that Chief Lees '
does not use the thumbscrew and the i
rack, the red hot pinchers and the boil-
Ing oil, the plan Is really a revival of
the barbarous "Question under Tor
ture." It was the duty of the tor- j
mentor, by the employment of every j
cruelty which diabolical ingenuity
could devise, to wring some sort of
confession from his victim. Chief
Lees, t employing the more humane
modern methods, does much the same
thing, and worries his victim with
questions, cows him with threats, until,
as in Lochner's case, the man's mind is
wrecked, and he is reduced to a condi
tion verging on insanity. The only
difference is that the tormentor of the
medieval dungeons was a properly ap
pointed official, holding his office in a
perfectly constitutional way. What he
did was wrong, horribly wrong, from
our point of view; but still, judged by
the standard of his times, it was leg
ally right. Chief Lees, on the other
hand, is adopting medieval methods
without a shadow of justification, his
torture chamber is more alien to the
spirit of the nineteenth century than
the dungeons of the Bastile were to
that of the sixteenth.
If we are really going to adopt this
French system of secretly examining
prisoners and suspects before a Judge
d'lnstruction, let us do it legally and
with all proper checks against abuse.
Let us appoint able, upright men to
conduct the examinations, and let us
above all, repeal the portions of our
law which provide that every man ar
rested has a right to be tried in open
court at the earliest possible moment
after his arrest. Let us give Chief
Lees, by a formal statute, the auto
cratic power he now illegally assumes.
Let us give him the right to arrest any
man he chooses, and to keep him in
the tanks as long as he likes. Let us
do all these things openly, so that all
the people may know what is going
on, and may realize the despotic power
which they have unheedingly allowed
the Chief of the Police to assume.

uniform, and resplendent .in . braid and
tinsel promenaded about the Palace Hotel
court to the admiration of men, women
and hotel clerks who form a class of their
own. The colonel was dressed for the
flag raising at Camp Barrett. It has been
some time since the colonel regaled him
self in all his military finery, and he felt
uncomfortable. He himself confessed to
a mal d'aise feeling which, hoover, did
not last long. At first "Chad" hid behind
the massive wooden pillars that decorate
the west end of the court. He soon dis
covered that he only invited notice by
trying to avoid it, so he came out in the
open and braved the raillery of his
friends. In the midst of a personal and
silent narration to himself of great and
heroic deeds performed on the battlefield,
the colonel was interrupted by a stranger,
who, spying the insignia on his shoulder
straps, addressed him in an apologetic
manner and inquired about the army and
when the colonel expected to get away to
Manila. The colonel did not have time
to disillusionize the stranger, who was
flattered by the pliant affability of the
distinguished officer. The military man
was invited to drink. He replied that he
seldom drank, and then only on occa
sions. The stranger begged that this be
one of the occasions, and the colonel re
lented. "â  ,
Then followed an invitation to lunch.
No, the colonel rarely lunched except on
occasions. This proved to be one of the
occasions. The stranger knew of a" par
ticular vintage that he was positive would
please the refined taste of such a con
noisseur as the colonel must be. A goodly
quantity of objections were in order from
the military chair, but they were swept
nside by the other. Lunch finished the
two started to walk down the "line"â
the colonel happy with all things and con
scious of the fine figure he exposed to all
the Market-street world, the stranger
elated and overjoyed that he could be
seen arm in arm with such a distinguished
looking man, and a colonel at that. Mr.
Chadbourne had a very pleasant after
noon. He was not allowed to separate
himself from a shekel. He will wear those
glittering spangles soon again.

LOCHNER IS
NOW LYING
Carpenter Suspect De
nies Statements.
SADIE WAS SMOTHERED
PRISONER GOES TO PIECES WHEN
PUT ON THE RACK.
The Rag Was Tied Around Her
Throat After Deathâ New
Developments.
Chief I.cc? and Captain Seymour no
lnnpfr hesitate to express their belief that
Joseph Lochner is the murderer of Sadie
Carpenter. Each day's developments
ppom to demonstrate beyond a doubt
that he is the guilty man.
The Chief said last night: "This is a
most mysterious case, but we are grad
ually getting some light on it. It looks
to mÂ» that Lochner is guilty, but I cannot
tell at this time whether we will be able
to get a strong enough case against him
to secure a conviction. Everything we
have gathered -will be submitted at the
Coroner's inquest Monday."
It is now positively known that Mrs.
Carpenter was not strangled with the rag
found knotted about her neck. It was
tiod on in Buch a manner that no force
could have been applied, or it would have
torn in two. Recent developments indi
cate that she was smothered either with
a pillow or the bed clothing, and the rag
jÂ«larfd on her throat by the murderer to
indicate suicide. Lochner is not bearing
up well, and his memory is failing him.
Uf> now contradicts statements he made
earlifr in the week, and then seeks to
In. All these things count against
him. Witnesses who have previously
made statements are returning to the po
ll' o headquarters and voluntarily giving
additional information which further
blackens the character of the suspect.
No formal charge has yet been made
against Lochner.
The whereabouts of Carpenter, the
missing husband, is still unknown, and
the police are unable to get any trace of
him. The letter from Los Gatos. alleged
to have been written by him and pub
lished In a morning paper, was a hoax.
Captain Seymour put Lochner on the
rack again last night, and during the or
deal the suspect became greatly confused
ana made many contradictions to his own
statements in former interviews which
â¢were taken in shorthand.
l nder cross-examination by Captain
Seymour Lochner said that when he went
Into Mrs. Carpenter's room he saw her

view with the oaptaln Lochner told, for
the first time, thru a portion of Mrs. <~"ar
penter'a hair was between the cloth and
her throat, and that the knot was tied
over the hair. Captain Seymour asked
him sharply why he had not mentioned
this dftail before. Lochner stuttered,
hesitated, and then muttered, "I did not
think It was nerppsary."
The captain then asked him, "Why did
you go so fiuiekly to the bed when Prieur
opened tho door, and before he struck a
match to light the pas?"
His reply in a hurried manner was,
"Well, you see, she was a particular
friend of mine."
"But in view of Lizzie Riley's remark
that 'there was trouble in room 10* would
It not have been natural for a man to
hesitate a little?" said the captain.
Well, I suppose so, may bo," answered
Lochner.
The rag found around Sadie's neck was
then handed to Lochner. and he was
asked to tell how it was tied around the
murdered woman's neck.
He seemed to lose his self-control for
a moment and nervously fumbled the
rag. After turning It in an undecided
manner for a moment or two he attempt-
Ed to explain how it was fastened, but
seemed unable to do so. Captain Seymour
took the cloth from Lochner's trembling
hands and placed around his neck. He
seemed quite starteld and drew back.
Recovering himself with a visible effort
he took hold of the ends of the rag and
illustrated the knot as he found it. â¢
In this incident the suspected murderer
again contradicted his original story and
gave the poUce another point, which will
le used against him. Until last night
he has said the rag was twisted compact
ly and then knotted, when as a matter
of fact it is only long enough to encircle
a man's wrist when tied in the manner
he described. Seeing his mistake Loch
ner then took the cloth, which is almost
square, with a tear half through the mid
dle of it. and said the two ends were tied
around Sadie's throat, leaving a large
flap under her shoulders.
Lochner's demonstration clearly estab
lished the theory of the police, referred
to above, that Sadie Carpenter was not
strangled, but that she was smothered.
In whatever manner she came to her
death the rag found around her throat
had nothing to do with the cause there
of, and was used by the murderer as a
blind. Lochner's knowledge of all these
details, which are "pweated" out of him
by degrees, has forced the police to the
opinion that he is a murderer.
After the interview with Lochner Chief
Lees, Captain Soymour and the newspaper
men working: on the case went to the
Hubbard House to test the truth of his
rnents that he saw Sadie's face and
the rag on her neck before the gas was
lighted.
All the investigators were satisfied that
he had lied. It was an impossibility for
him to have seen anything when he went
into the room under the conditions he
himself describes. He said all the blinds
were closed except the upper half of the
middle window, and that the light fn>m
a saloon across the street penetrated the
room, giving sufficient light for him to
discern the rag.
Two electric lights, which are extin
guished at midnight every night, were
burning brightly when the Investigation
was made last night. (These lights were
out when Lochner and Prlcur went into
the room Sunday morning about 1:30.)
The blinds were closed and the hall door
opened, as he described, and there was
not enough light in the room to distin
guish anything in the corner in which the
bed stood. That was another link in the
chain now being forged against Lochner.
From the Hubbard House. Chief Lees
and Captain Seymour went to the Belle
vue saloon, and searched in all the crev
ices and corners of the back rooms. They
were looking for the dead woman's miss
ing watch. Nothing was found which be
longed to the woman. The saloon will be
thoroughly searched to-day.
Darby Glynn, who was in the saloon
Sunday morning when Lorhner came in
there and announced that Sadie had been
murdered, was questioned as to Joe's ac
tions. He said he was standing at the
end of the bar, nearest the Fourth-street
door, when Lochner came in. Joe told
him of the murder, and Glynn replied,
"That's too bad, Joe; you will be ar
rested for it." Glynn says he was only
joshing. The bartender and Glynn con
tradict Lorhner as to the length of his
Ptay in the saloon. Joe says he went in
and told the news to the bartender, and
wont right out and returned to the Hub
l;ard House. Glynn says he remained ton
mlnutee, and the bartender says he re
mained about five. While he was in tho
saloon Joe talked with several men who
wore there. Another new point against
him. Chief Lees has not received the offi
cial report of the autopsy surgeon, and
Is not. therefore, wholly familiar with the
condition of the body when taken to the
Morgue.

was riding along Brannan street yester
day morning and at Second street his
horse's feet went from under it and it
fell on top of him.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospi

his left leg was ruptured, his left wrist
was sprained and his left elbow was con
tused and abralsed. It will lie some time
before he is fit for duty again.

WORMY FRUIT
CONFISCATED
Thirty-Five Boxes Cast
Into the Bay.
SHIPPERS WERE WARNED
ACTION OF HORTICULTURAL
QUARANTINE OFFICER.
Damaging Work of the Codlin Moth
and the Way It Affects Ship
pers and Commission
Men.
Quarantine Officer Alexander Craw of
the State Board of Horticulture is keep
ing a sharp lookout and condemning all
infested or wormy fruits received in ship
ment for the local market. Yesterday he
and his assistant, Mr. Isaacs, chopped up
fifteen boxes of Bartlett pears and
dumped them into the bay. The day pre
vious a seizure of twenty-five boxes was
made, and out of this lot all but five
boxes were subjected to similar treat
ment. These shipments were from up the
Sacramento River.
The quarantine and confiscation work is
being done under rule VI of the State
horticultural regulations, which prohibits
the offering for sale, gift or distribution,
within the State, of any fruits found in
fested with any insect, or with any fungi,
blight or other diseases injurious to fruit
or trees or plants.
At the Fruit-growers' convention, as
sembled at Riverside, April 15 last, a reso
lution was adopted, the preamble of
Which pointed out the shipment of wormy
fruits to this and other cities as being
detrimental to the interests of growers;
as lowering the price of good fruit and
disseminating the codlln moth afresh all
over the State. It was recommended that
the State Uoaxd of Horticulture take such
steps as shall stop the transportation and
exposure for sale of such infested fruit.
The regulations, although being strictly
inforced, are not being closely complied
wnn.
All the transportation companies and
commission houses have been notified to
warn their shippers that any infested
fruit will be seized and quarantined, but
it appears that such notification has been
ignored in most instances, with the above
result, and just now fruit is coming in
abundantly.
As a consequence of the Quarantine Of
ficer's execution of the law there is liable
to be a damage suit brought by L. Sca
tena & Co., wliose fifteen boxes of pears
were dumped into the bay. Scatena
claims that the officers had no right to
confiscate his personal property. The
matter has been called to the attention
of Attorney General Fitzgerald, and will
be thoroughly investigated.
Generally speaking, fruit is in better
condition this season than for several
years past. A few years ago fruit was
very scaly, but where orchardlsts disin
fected their trees sinre there has been
but about 2 per cent bad. where formerly
the percentage stood at 32.
Commenting on the two seizures, Quar
antine Officer Craw said: "We do not
expect much trouble, for as soon as the
shippers learn that infested or wormy
fruit will surely be confiscated or con
demned they will cease shipping fruit
that ought to be fed to the hogs or manu
factured into vinegar. They can get no
price for wormy fruit. Moreover, it af
fect's the price of good, sound fruit, and
outsiders lose confidence in the local mar
ket Such fruit cannot be shipped to Ore
gon and Washington, for the commission
men there will not have it at any price,
and shipment after shipment has been
returned in the past. These same ship
pers send their best fruits to the East.
Orchardists could prevent all this wormy
fruit by caring properly for their trees."
The codlin moth, which has caused all
the trouble, was introduced in this State
from the East in 1573, by a grower. The
fruit infested was exhibited at a State
fair, at a time when no one had a right
to interfere. The very next year the fruit
in that section was infested, and this
state of affairs reached Los Angeles trees
three years later, through fruit sent there
from up the Sacramento River. The cod
lin moth deposits one egg on an apple or
pear, as the case may be; the egg hatches
For four hours the Injured Thespian lay j
on the roof without any clothing but his
pajamas, pierced by the cold winds and j
suffering excruciating pain from the j
broken limb. Unable to move and too
weak to call assistance, he remained
there, cursing and muttering until mid
night, when, through good fortune, Mies
Hettie Cornelius, his friend, discovered
his predicament and called assistance.
The Receiving Hospital ambulance was
sent for, and for an hour or more the
stewards worked hard to bring him to the
sidewalk. In their efforts to get him down
they were compelled to pass him through
a skylight, over obstructions, through
passageways and down numerous flights
of stairs, during all of which the groans
and cries of the unfortunate man were
heard.
Luckily for him, he was Inebriated, and
his senses were partially dulled to pain.
The proverbial good fortune of the in
toxicated man was exemplified again.
Had he, instead of walking down two
passageways, jumped from the window in
the hallway leading direct from Miss Cor
nelius' room, he would have struck the
ground five stories below and been in
stantly killed.
The young lady above alluded to Is the
daughter of Mrs. Cornelius, a spiritualist
at 1033 Mission street. She visited the
police station earlier In the evening, wildly
excited, and breathlessly inquired of those
In charge whether they had found a man
wandering around minus his clothes and
shoes. She was assured that no such per
son had been found, and she returned to
her hotel and renewed her search for the
missing man. Fortunately for Winters,
she looked out of the window, or he would
not have been found until the next day.
Accompanied by a youth named Jannette,
she followed her friend to the hospital,
carding his habiliments on her arm. She
was solicitous about Winters' welfare, but
was not allowed to comfort him while his
injury was being attended to, owing to tne,
childish remarks of her escort. Both
were compelled to wait in another room
while Dr. Bunnell repaired the broken leg.

numerous bumps and bruises to remind

Railroad Facilities Wanted.
The residents on Ashbury Heights, as
also those of the southeast section of the
Mission, embracing Potrero and Bryant
avenues and the San Bruno road, com
plain of the unjust discrimination made
by the Market-street Railway Company
against the people traveling in these di
rections.
To reach the park from tha City and
County Hospital or any of the streets on
the southeast side of the Mission requires
two fares, as there are no transfers given
or taken from the Sixteenth-street cars
to any of the cars running southeast of
Folsom street. A transfer to and from the
Howard-street line would be hailed with
much delight by all who travel in either
direction. This will be made more apapr
ent as soon as the Affiliated Colleges get
under way with the work designated for
that branch of the State University.
From this place students and physicians
will visit the hospital in the interests of
the public and that of their profession
and they will, under the present system
be compelled to pay two fares.
Another cause of complaint comes from
the traveling public on the line of Leav
enworth street and streets adjacent there
to. In this case no transfers are given to
the Ellis and Fourth street cars, which
go direct to the San Jose depot. A chronic
complaint is on record in the manager's
office from the traveling public on the
Geary-street line because the railroad
company refuses to give transfers at
Kearny and Third streets, which would
enable people going to the depot at Third
and Townsend streets to get there for one
fare.

Of the season and the crowds still wonder
how it is that there never seems to be
a crowd when once Inside the grounds at
El Campo. The place is so vast and so
beautiful and there are bo many cool re
treats that there is no probability of dis
comfort.

THE ATHLETICS
PLAYING
GREAT BALL.
BY JOE CORBETT.
With another good pitcher to assist
Fltxpatrlck the Athletics will be nigh an
Invincible team.
Such ball us they have been playing !
of late bids fair to eclipse even that of
the famous OUt Edges, and that they will j
cut <iuit*Â» a figure in the pennant race is
a fact that 1 am afraid will not bear j
dispute. The form which this club dis
played on Saturday last reflects great
credit on Its numbers as well as Its man- .
agers.
Their Improvement hns been really phe
nomenal, when one considers that but a
short time ago they, like most of the
other teams, were putting up at times
rather ragged ball.
Tin- first question that presents itself
In connection with this club is, Are they
capable of keeping up the pace? Timo
alone, of course, will tell, but if the
methods employed to bring them into
their present form be adhered to it is al
ni"st a certainty that the teams ahead of
them will have to hustle.
They put up on lasi Saturday the fast
est and most perfect game of ball seen
here this Beason.
To defeat the Gilt Edges something of
this sort had to occur, but the simple
tin t of th.-ir winning from this great
team does not alone give them their pres
ent high standing among the baseball
public.
The Stocktons, a collection I dare say
Inferior even to the Friscos, defeated the
Gilt Edges, which only goes to demon
strate ti--i.it at times the best teams must
imb to the luck of Its Inferiors. It
was not, as i mentioned previously, the
fact that the Athletics defeated the Gilt
Edges which prompted me to comment
on their great work. It was the manner
lr. which each player acquitted himself
from the catcher dear out to the rield
ers.
They evinced a spirit which bespoke
alacrity and demonstration, went about
their work in a truly baseball manner.
â  i at all times every point of the
game, at bat, and in the field, save in
i>ne instance, and, in a word, displayed
all the characteristics of a complete, up
to date ball team, which is bound to
be successful.
So perfect was their work that I find
it impossible tv entertain the idea that
it was lurk, pure and simple. Some peo
re Inclined to conjecture in such a
manner, but their work was too steady
and even all through tha contest to leave
a doubt as to its genuineness in my mind.
In only one instance did they fail, and
as this same mistake is visible during all
the games I shall take advantage of this
opportunity and touch on it.
The offender was Mr. Hilderbrandt, a
good player and earnest worker, yet this
fact lives aot exempt him from criticism.
The exact inning in which the mistake
â¢red I have forgotten, but it makes
but little difference. Hilderbraiuit was on
second base and the batter singled to cen
ter field. Instead of dashing immediately
for third and thence to the plate he kept
watching the ball until he had passed
third. It w;is thrown to the plate and
Catcher Stanley actually had it in his
hands, when Hilderbrandt was at least
feet fn m the plate. By a clever
Bllde, intermingled with a painful gush
of stupidity on the part of Mr. Stanley,
he was. enabled to umke the plate in
safety.
I!.- should have be^n put out easily, but
the fates were smiling propitiously, and
in consequence a miserable play was per
mitted to pass unnoticed.
Now. when a bater hits a ball he should
nev.-r for an Instant look to -see where
it is going. The moment it leaves the
bat he should think only of getting to
nrst base, and a.s quickly as possible.
Wh^n a player Is on the bases and it
is obvious to him that a batted ball is
â¢ Bafe, or has gone safe, as was the
rape with HUderbrandt. he should think
only of moving around those bases at a
breakneck speed. To hesitate means very
that you are lost, and to deliber
ately watch a ball after it has passed
safely Into the outfieldâ well, such a mis
take is really terrible. There was no rea
son In the world why HUderbrandt should
â ;,â¢ to watch that ball after it had
passed through the Infield. If it had been
a By things would be different, or if he
thought some one of the Infielders would
Intercept it, his actions would have been
proper.
But in his case there was no chance to
conjecture. The ball was hit very sharp
and passed directly over second base.
When he saw this much he saw all that
was necessary, and should have made
for the plate Just as fast as his legs
rould carry him. Had he done this the
Elate would have been passed before the
all had reached its destination, and all
chances of a close play dissipated. By
his watching the ball, however, he easily
lost twenty feet, and wrnld have been
put out had not Providence been ex
tremely kind.
Such are the disadvantages which en-
Bue when the simplest rules of the game
ar-' disregarded, and it very often hap
pens that a game is lost by players being
bo negligent.
When you hit a ball never mind looking
to see whero it has gone, but get down
that first base line. If it be a long, safe
hit the eoacher will send you on and on,
passing first to second. It 1h then time
to locate the ball and figure whether or
not you can make the base and take in
another. If you are on the bases and a
Vail is hit. one glance Is sufficient to en
lighten you as to whether it Is going safe
or not. The moment your mind is made
up act instantly. If you think the hit is
going safe lose no time in securing the
next cushion, and watch the eoacher, as
he is there to tell you what to do next.
Entirely too much valuable time is wast
ed by players in this manner, and as It
is a case of stupidity rather than mis
judgment there Is hardly any excuse.
This mistake, as I said before, was the
only one visible In that game, and even
â¢with thi? fault the Athletics played
wonderfully. They must, however, con
tinue to practice. If they neglect to do
bo It will show in their play, but it Ik
hardly possible that they would so far
forget themselves. At present many of
thr- fans place them on an equality with
the Gilt Edges, and it really looks as
though that team, which has had full
eway for so long a time, is going to ex
perience great difficulty in winning that
championship. At the present rate warm
games will be in order, and whether the
leaders are headed or not the fight for
th<Â» pennant promises to be an excellent
on*\
The game to-day the managers say will
b<"- B good one, and a large crowd will no
doubt attend. The line-up is as follows:

contest on Thursday. The wager was j
a dinner for themselves and two friends, !
but owing to darkness the match was not

(fames were all deuce, and the set was
10â S. The second set was won by Rob- !
crt N. Whitncv. This set was not of

the first two games. Then George got !
a game, and Robert N. took the next
two. A burst of speed by the under i
man resulted In a score of four all. Then '

The number of entries for the barge

pointingly small. The Ariels and Dol- j

! have no Junior crews. None of the clubs
I has entered an intermedia te crow. The
| Pioneer intermediate crew, having no
' competitor in the intermediate class, has
(entered in the senior class with G. Lar
sen as afterwalst instead of Conrad Ochs.
, The Dolphin intermediate crew, consist- i
'ing of A. W. Pape, \V. O. Patch. F. j
Schwartlng and Victor Caglieri, Is brok
i en up, Patch wanting rest. Pape being
I out of condition and Schwarting absent '
,on a vacation. The Dolphin junior crew,
made up of C. M. Farrell, bow; F. Woer
ner. forwardwaist; T. J. Hopkins, after-,
waist, and E. Bart man, stroke, is strong,
but has not had much practice. F. Woer
. ner is a new man, but is very willing.
Last Sunday the Ariel captain tried out
two of the lunior crews, the Turners and
the Lynches. The latter crew beat the
former decidedly. On Thursday evening
the Lynch crew rowed against the Wil
son crew, the latter winning. The Wilson ,
i crew will carry the Ariel colors in the
Junior barge nice to-morrow, and should
win without much difficulty. The Wilson
crew was originally mm.li- u[> thus: 11.

ably one of these entries will be scratched

The South End Rowing Club intended to
enter a senior and a junior crew for the
barge races to-morrow, but the junior
crew has been â¢ withdrawn owing to the
lack of condition of Paul Sturdevant, the
Olympic man, who occupied the after
waist seat. In the senior crew George
Kates is afterwaist in the place of R. Mc-
Arthur. who was protested against by
th<- Pioneers on the ground of profes
slonailsm. Dan Dougherty, the old pro
fessional who coached the * Midget
barge crew, has been coaching the senior
crew for the past two weeks. There was
a large crowd of members at the South
End boathouse last Sunday; every boat
was kept in constant use all day. Dr. C.
C Dennis was out sculling. He will row
against A. W. Pape when the new skiff
to be built by Al Rodgers is ready.
The Alameda senior crew has been do-
Ing good work lately and has consider
ably improved under coaching. It should
give a good account of itself to-morrow.
Three members of the Alameda Boat
riul) D Greenleaf. G. A. Rosenberg and
Qeorge H. Millar, have bought a launch
which has a towing propeller. This will
be taken out, a new one put in and tne
launch put in thorough order. At the last
meeting of the club Harry Nelson and
Charles E Pesoli were elected members.
Some members of the regatta com
mittee arc determined to bring the Pape-
McCaUsland fiasco before the Pacific Ath
letic Association and have an investiga
tion made. The result will probably be
the suspension of MeCausland for several
months. At present some blame seÂ«ms to
rest on everybody connected with the
event; McCausland should have come
fully prepared with everything needful
for a race. Pape should have refused to
pull in a match in which he had no com
petitor, and the regatta committee, know
ing that the public wished to see a race
between Pape and McCausland, should
have used every effort to bring them to
gether. Excluding the shell race, which,
in the absence of the Stockton man, was
a row-over, there were only three events
on the programme, and the order in
which these events were pulled off was
immaterial to the spectators. By defer
ring the special match till after the senior
skiff race, McCnusland could have had
Patch's sculls, and would hnve been left
absolutely without excuse; he must have
either pulled or definitely refused to pull
against Pape. Determination in carrying
out a programme is an excellent thin?,
but In this instance It deprived the
spectators of the event they came to see.

THE FIELD OF SPORT
DEER HUNTERS
RETURN
WITH BIG GAME.
Trap shooting is about ended for this
Beason. With the exception of a few ex
ceedingly enthusiastic members of the
Olympic Gun Club, who delight in
pulverizing Inanimate birds at all sea
sons of the year, presumably for the
pleasure of seeing mud feathers flying,
the great majority of sportsmen forsake
the traps when the season for deer and
dove shooting arrives, and journey to the
haunts <'f wild game.
At present there are large numbers of
hunters camped in the valleys and can
yons under the shade of the old oaks and
reriv ood,s.
Ig aqjo Martinettl bagged a spike buck
last Monday near the Bohemian Club
grouifds, on the banks of Russian River,
which dressed ninety pounds.
Frank Marcus shot at what he thought
â  was a black bear, and was horrlfie<l
when he discovered that instead of a
bruin he had killed a fatted hog, the
property of a farmer who resides near
Russian River station. Marcus is now
living on pork and black bass.

ers have not yet recovered from an at
tack of what is called "Gallagher's nip,"
but that they expect to be up and doing
on Saturday. Venison stakes are expect

headquarters.
Lou Carrigan and party had a most
successful deer shoot in the hills nortb
east of Point Reyes last Sunday. Suffi
cient to say that their friends enjoyed
juicy steaks during the week.
Sportsmen of the Tamalpais Club are
endeavoring to figure out the number of
prongs which Billy Brown secured from
the heads of three deer which he recently
grassed on preserve territory. Frank La
Coste Is authority for the statement that
Brown shot bo accurately and with such
rapidity that two of the deer were minus
horns when the hunter reached hits game,
but that's only one of the yarns spun by
a jealous rival on Billy B.
John Berges has received from Paris
a beautiful pair of ileld glasses, which will
aid him to distinguish at long range the
difference between a forked norn and a
spotted fawn.
Frank Vernon bagged a seventy-flvÂ«
pound buck in the Point Reyes hlns la*Â»t
Sunday when dove-shooting. The deer
broke cover on the approach of the hunter
and was bowled over with a charge of
buckshot.
Van Sickle and Billy Kittle are credited
with having killed eight deer in the Coun
try Club since the season opened.
J Maxwell and a friend, residents of
Oakland, returned last Monday with three
fat bucks which they killed near Mount
Diablo.
Messrs Tlalght. Maynard and Avers re
turned from Hanford last week with an
immense bag of doves which they bagged
near that place. They were cooked a la
Dave Thorn, and tickled the palates of
several sportsmen who were Invited to the
feast at a downtown restaurant. Ayern,
alia- "the Doc," is said to have ground
sluiced thirty-five birds at one sitting
with his Antioch canvas-back annihil-
H Golcher and J. Greene had a very
successful dove shoot recently near
Pleasanton.
Dave Thorri is taking very little interest
in dove-shooting. He says that the sport.
so called, is only child's play when com
pared with snipe-shooting.
E Bosqul and R. Bolton had a very
pleasant dove-shoot recently in Monterey
( j UI1 r' ! " N>nlr>n killed two fine deer last
week on Ryan's ranch, near Novato.
The Board of Supervisors of Monterey
has ordained that owing to the dry sea
son and scarcity of young birds quail-
Bhooting in that district will be limited to
five days this year, commencing October 1
and ending October 5. Supervisors of other
counties where birds are scarce should
emulate the example set by the good
fathers of Monterey County.
Th<- sportsmen In and about Sacramento
are enjoying excellent sport with the
doves T'hi; shooting is chiefly to the
hud in the foothills, in which direction
the birds have gone in search of water.
\t the present time the birds are not
large. Last Sunday L. S. 1 pson and a
companion bagged ninety-four between
them without difficulty A party headed
by Vincent A. Dodd and James Little will
start this morning on a two days shoot.

All lovprs of cricket on this coast will
hear with regret of the death of A. E.
Coates, whlrh took place a few days ago
at Ix>Â« Angeles from hoart disease. As
Captain of the Placer County eleven and
for several years one of the vice-presi
dents of the California Cricket Associa
tion A. E. Coates was one of the most
ardent supporters of the game in this
State. When teams from San Francisco
visited Penryn and partook of the gener
ous hospitality of the citrus colony club
A. E. Coates was untiring In his efforts
to make the outing agreeable.
At a meeting of the California Cricket
Association held July 19 at the office of the
secretary, 50S Montgomery street, it was
decided to carry out the match set for
to-morrow at Golden Gate â Banks and
Insurance vs. All-Comers. R. B. Hogue,
captain of the Alameda team, undertook
to get together the All-Comera and
George Theobald of the Pacifies took
charge of the Bank and Insurance men.
Owing to the absence of several cricketers
on their summer vacations, it has not
been easy to make up the elevens, but the
All-Comers team will be chosen from the
following: R. B. Hogrue. J. H. Saunders,
F. V. Croll, J. J. R. Peel, V. Seebeck, I.
11. Splro, 11. Bird, B. Bird, C. Banner, J.
H. Harbour, G. J. Baugh, F. Stahl and
T. W. G. Wallace. The Banks and In

from the folowing: J. J. Moriarity, J.
Myers, F. C. Driffleld, C. I. Coles. E. F.
Musson, Fane Sewell, Charles B. Hill,
George Theobald, J. McGaw, R. H. Dela
field, H. P. Gordon and Henry Ward.
Mr. Christian, who lately visited this
city from Honolulu, informed several cric
keters whom he met that the lovers of the
game in Honolulu were desirous to send
a team to play against the clubs of Cali
fornia. The secretary of the California
Cricket Association has written to Hono
lulu offering to arrnnge several matches
for the Hawaiian visitors and to do all in
his power to render their visit pleasant.

structions to the delegate were that he
should vote in favor of the proposed new
rules with certain modifications.
The members of the Pacific advisory
board have received notice that at the
meeting of the executive committee of
the American Kennel Club, held on the
14th inst.. a decision was reached that
certain members were removed from of
fice for cause and the vice-president of
the A. K. C. was requested to appoint
a special committee to act as a board un
til the election of a new board is held in
compliance with article XXII, section 4,
of the constitution.
Another official communication from
the secretary of the A. K. C. states that
at the same meeting of the executive
board the complaint of the San Francis
co Kennel Club against J. B. Martin for
conduct prejudicial to dogs and dog
shows wan thrown out of court for want
of evidence.
An unofficial letter was received from
tha same source Intimating that the new
rules propusi-d by the San Francisco Ken
nel Club, even if adopted and recom
mended by the convention, would receive
no consideration from the A. K. C.
It has been decided by the new rules
committee of that body that no further
modification of the classification will be
permitted, with the exception that cer
tain large shows will be designated as
the only once at which championship
honors will be conferred. On the Pacific
Coast San Francisco will be the only one
entitled to this honor. I
Of course, this means a declaration of
open war on the coast and will be so
accepted. The convention of konnel clubs ;
will meet, adopt the rules as now for
mulated or amended, and send them to
the A. K. C. thus indorsed. If, an fore
shadowed, the proposed rules are reject
ed it Is more than probable that th<
c.lubn of the coast will execute the oft
threatened Becession and form a local
kennel league. There can be no doubt
that the league will be a strong one and
will be on a firm basis.
Osmond Van Every of Oakland has sold
his well-known Great Dane, Don Caesar,
by Kix'H Prince, out of Princess Dagrnar.
to George L. Bralnard of Berkeley. This
young oog promises to be a high flier,
having the grandest body of any pane
on the coast. He will enter the circuit
in September and will prove a hard nut
for the old stagers to crack.
GOSSIP CONCERNING
THE FAST TROTTERS
Dlrectum Kelly, the winner of the rich
Merchant Manufacturers 1 stake at De
troit, Is still another to the credit of Cali
fornia, being a product of the now de- I
funet Pleasanton Stock Farm and bred j
by that astute horseman, Monroe Sails- j
bury.
Once before it fell to a California trot- |
ter when the late John Goldsmith landed j
it with Siva in IS!>5, but Directum Kelly |
is but a 4-year-old, and yet has trotted
the fastest heat in this stake's historyâ!
3:ll\i, the third heat. He came right ]
back the fourth in 2:13V4i and had them
all trotted to a standstill.
The "much touted"' Percy, as he has
been railed, won . a neat victory at De
troit, and, too, stepped a heat in 2:13.
Ed Geers" ankle is mending rapidly, and
he will soon take up the lines behind
Village Farm's trotters and pacers. â¢
"Nick" Hublnger paid $4000 for John
Nolan, by Prodigal, 2:16, and he won
him out the first race after he purchased
him.
Joe Patchen will do exhibition sketches
over in New England this season, and
forsake the grand circuit tracks.
Dione. 2:11%; Searchlight, 2:05%; Klata
wah. 2:06^4; Stamboulette, 2:12%, and Miss
Logan, 2:10Vl, all reflect credit on the Cali
fornia trainers now campaigning in the
Bast,
Horsemen should try to render the pro
posed breeders* meeting at Santa Rosa a
banner meeetlng. .
Marcus Daly owns Ponce de Leon; sire
of Percy, 2:13, and Prodigal, sire of John
Nolan, 2:14, two recent winners at De
troit.
Flying Jib, 2:04, Is stepping quarters to
a heavily freighted wagon at Cleveland
regularly In 30 and 31 seconds.
Andy McDowell now has Nettle Jeffer
son, 2:10%,, in his string, > and will race
her along the line of the grand circuit.
HOUNDS OF NOTE
OUT FOR
GAME AND COIN.
Distinguished dogs and dogs that have
yet to earn distinction will course at the
! two parks to-day and to-morrow. East
| crn dogs, coast dogs, local dogsâ all will
I be represented.
At Union Park two stakes will be run
offâ an open contest including forty-eight
candidates and a puppy feature. From
the make-up the sport at both parks will
be unusually warm. The running begins
at the usual hour and continues through
to-morrow.
A glance over Gladiator's record shows
him to be something of a breadwinner.
Since January 1 he has run fourteen
times, winning three stakes, dividing the
stake once, winning third once and fall
ing to annex some of the money only
twice. His total stake winnings during
the period named aggregate $610.
The puppy stake at L'nionPark this week
embraces the largest entry of youngsters
ever made in any similar event on the
coast.
E. V. Sullivan has an even ten candi
dates at Union Park to-day. Curtis &
Son and the Pasha kennels are close up,
J. Tiernan has a new puppy at Tnlon
Park to-day that is said to have shown
phenomenal work In nrlvate. It is
known as Yost-mite, and in appearance
looks to be a clinker.
Santa Clara County Is particularly well
represented at I'nion Park to-dayâ Curtla
& Son with six, Jim Monkhouse with two.
Portal with three, and Charlie Wlllett
and Henry Spring, each with one.
The broken leg suffered by J. Byrne's
Semlnole has knitted and seems as strong
as of yore. Jim, however, fears to give
it undue strain as yet, and will probably
breed Seminole before running him again.
After next week the Interstate Club
will hold Its drawings for Ingleside on
Thursday evenings, as In the past.
Lowe & Thompson expect a new dog
out from England early in August,
y.nckstitch, the dog lately brought out
by them from the Kust, will hardly be In
shape to run for several weeks. Patria
and High Horn Lady are also enjoying
temporary retirement.
Lynch <!fc Biaher received an addition to
their kennels a few days ago. In the
shape of a new one from the East. He
will be tried out next Monday, and If
the showing made is favorable will at
once be placed in training.
Considering the enormous entry of
young dogs for the meeting at Union
Park to-day. It is somewhat hazardous
to make a selection of the probable win
ners, but judging from breeding qualities
and private hints the pups that should
give good accounts of themselves are:
Maid of Erin, Belle of Seville, Golden
Kussett. Sheridan, Needham, Walt a Lit
tle. Master Mat, Washington, St. Ger
trude, Minerva, Liberty Bell. Jersey
L..v Fly Away, Miss Skyrockets, Lalla
Rookh. Miss Skyball. Riot Act, Beauty
Spot, Sunburst and Morning Glory.
All-age stake, the most probable win
ners: Hadiwlst. Flying Buck, Millers
Maid, Commodore. Minneapolis, Laurel
wood. Theron, Sweet Music. Magnet, The
Gossoon, Lady Blanche, Bendlgo. Pre
tender, Maud S, Vanity Fair, Mountain
Beauty, Douglass, Lord Byron, Ix>rd
Lonsdale, Obadlah. Jester, Chartist, Jesse
More. Green Valley Maid.
Vida Shaw whelped seven youngsters on
Tuesday last. They are by the great
bread-winner Emm Pasha, and, of course,
have a promising future.
Joy Bells also increased the stock of
"fliers" by seven a few days ago, among
which are four dogs. Emm Pasha is also
the papa of this litter.
It is said that the fast Eastern bitch
Winning Style, Donald MacCrory-Princess
of < 'range, property of Bartel & Barrow of
Cripple Creek, will soon journey in the
direction of the setting sun. So much has
been said and written of thi3 grand repre
sentative of the fleet-footed family that
much curiosity has been aroused among
the leashmen of this State as to her future
on this coast. However, she may be soon
afforded an opportunity of measuring
strides with some of the local bread-win
ners at Union Coursing Park.
I-ieashmen should not forget that entries
for the great Produce stake which will be
run on September 0 will positively close on
next Monday evening with Secretary
Scott. Already letters have been received
from Illinois, Colorado and North Dakota,
with inclosed entries for this meeting,
which promises to be the event of the year
in local coursing history.

ing men may be away.
The road racing officials of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling Clubs expect large
entry lists for the annual twenty-mile
event on September 18, and the annual
ten-mile handicap on October 9. this year,
as there ha* bren little track racing and
many of the men are feeling the need
of a good, stiff road ride.
The beautiful cup presented to the Cali
fornia Associated Cycung Clubs by its
official organ, the Cycling West of Den
ver, has been received and Is on exhibi

Land Along Owens Lake.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
decision of the Superior Court of Inyo
County In the case of Mrs. Flora M.
Sherman against L. F. J. Winkle, who
lays claim to a large piece of land upon
the shores of Owens Lake. An old act
permitted a citiaen to file upon land
formed by receding waters, but only C4O
acres can be thus secured. One survey
showed that Wrinkle's piece was less than
this amount, but a second survey showed
that there were 642 acres. Mrs. "Sherman
made application to purchase the land
and the point in her complaint to get
Wrinkle off the land was that he held
more than allowed by law and should be
dispossessed of The whole. She was suc
cessful In the lower court, but the Su
preme Court took the position that Wrin
kle could not have known the exact
amount, and that He could not be accused
of filing on more than the law permits.
A Philippine Heroine.
One of the Philippine insurgent leaders is a
beautiful woman whose life seems to be
charmed. She has often rushed bravely Into
the very teeth of death from guns and cannon,
but has never been wounded. Frequently we
see people in this country who live so long that
their liven seem charmed also, but the only
charm about it Is that they keep up their
strength and vitalize their blood with that cele
brated remedy, Hoatetter's Stomach Bitters.

A FOOTBALL TEAM
FOR THE OLYMPICS
The outlook for the football season a
few weeks back was very discouraging.
It then seemed as if there would be but
two first-class elevens in the field, those
wearing the blue and gold of the Univer
sity of California and the cardinal of
Stanford. But now comes the intimation
of the Olympic Club to form a team.
Without one of the athletic clubs repre
sented on the gridiron there would be but
one football game of any consequence,
the intercollegiate match on Thanksgiv-
ing day.
Two years ago when the Olympic Club
withdrew from the Pacific Athletic As
sociation of the Amateur Athletic Union
it divorced itself from all possible com
petition with the big universities on ac
count of stringent prohibitions issued by
that body against all competition with
clubs or organizations outside the pale of
their jurisdiction. The Olympic Club has
now seen the errors of its ways and will
make an attempt to re-enter the Pacific
Athletic Association.
Pete Smith, the great organizer of ath
letic elevens, is back from Anaconda, and
it is very likely that the task of formation
will again fall to him. Smith has just re
turned from Montana, where he put in
a season of play and work. The Reliance
Club will not put a team in the field If
the Olympic doesâ that is the agreement
that has been reached between them.
This is due to the paucity of football
material in and about this city. Butte
and Anaconda have depleted the local
ranks to such an extent that the search
for sufficient material to fill out a sin
gle strong eleven will be fraught with
labor. The last graduating classes of
the universities will furnish a few play
ers and there are still some of the old
men left.
Anaconda has taken six of our best local
football talent. McHugh, Arlett, Oliver,
Thlerkauf, Wilbur and Edmondson are
playing under Anaconda's banners. Butte
has Benson and Mahoney, one of Reli
ance's players.
The University of California -will begin
its fall semester in two weeks, and the
preparatory work of the season will be
gin at once. Cochran will be there to
coach the blue and gold men. Stanford's
season will begin at least weeks later.
Cross will be their instructor.
Dr. Shrady, president Bed Cross
Society, writes about the chances of
our soldiers in war, in next Sunday's
Call.

CONVENTION DATE PROPOSED
STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
WILL MEET TO-DAY.
The Projected Apportionment Calls
for Seven Hundred and Fifty-
One Delegates Based on
Number of Votes.
The executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Committee met at the
Palace Hotel last night to outline a call for
the next State convention. Over three
hours were spent In the discussion of
party affairs, an<i after all those present
heir views a sub-commit
!â¢â¢â  was appointed to prepare the call and
present it for indorsement this afternoon
at a meeting of the State Central Com
rnltee.
The meeting was called to order by Ma-
jor Frank McLaughlin of Oroville, and a
rail of the roll Bhowed that the following
members were pit Bent: F. P. Flint, Los
Angeles; W. F. George. Sacramento- Al
len B. Lommon. Santa Rosa; F. A. Miller,
KiA-side: 11. Z. Osborne. I-os Anp-1.-s;

and John D. Spreclcels, it. N. '"ray. M. R.
Higgins, Paris Kilburn Charles \V. Main-
J\irii>K, A. Ruef and \V. \Y. Shannon of
â iin Francisco.
The first busings taken up for con
sideration waa the manner of selecting
or electing the delegates to the State con
vention.
Some of the oommitteemen favored the
appointment of delegates by the several
county committees, while others -were
strongly opposed to such a course.
It was argued on the one side that
primary elections should be held to allow
the voters an opportunity of expressing
their choice of representatives. Against
the primary plan was urged the fact that
in some of the counties of the State it
would be impossible to hold primaries, as
the voters were so located that a central
election place could not be selected.
After a lengthy debate it was decided
to recommend that primaries be held in
all counties embracing three or more As
sembly districts. This moans that
primaries will be held in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Sacramento
and Alameda counties. In the other
counties the manner of selecting the dele
gates will be left to the discretion of the
county central committees, but none of
the delegates are to be appointed.
The apportionment of delegates to each
county was next .taken up. and it was
decided to recommend that the apportion
ment be made on the basis of one delegate
for each 200 votes cast for D." H. McKin
ley, who headed the list of Presidential
Electors in the last Presidential cam
paign, and one delegate for every fraction
of 100 votes and over. , Counties having
less than 100 votes will be allowed one
delegate. Alpine County will come under
this provision.
The committee decided to recommend
that the State convention meet at 1 p. m.
on August 23. The place of holding the
convention will be left to the State Com
mittee.
The delegates to the State convention
will. In addition to nominating thp regular
State tirket, also nominate Railroad Com
missioners and members of the Hoard of
Equalization. If the recommendations of
the executive committee are accepted.
there will be a separate pet of delegates
elected to nominate Congressmen.
A. B. Lcmmnn of Santa Rosa, H. Z.
Osborne of L<OB Angeles. A. Ruef of San
Francisco and M. R. Higginfl of San Fran- !
Cisco were appointed a subcommittee to !
draft a call, containing the recommenda-* '
tions of the i-ommittee, and present it to |
the executive committee at a meeting to ,
be held at 11 o'clock to-day.
After the Republican committee had ad
journed a member of the State Demo- ;
cratic Committee said that the conven
tion of his party would be held either
on the 2d or 9th of Augast.
He tafd he knew this was the pro- ;
gramme of his party. It would be fol- |
lowed out, and tho Democrats would have j
the advantage of placing their platform
and candidates first in the field.
James H. Barry, the editor of the Star,
has announced himself as a candidate for !
Congress on the Populist-Democratic
ticket in the Fourth District, to succeed
Magulre.

TOOK BOUGH ON RATS.
E. J. Nelson Ends His Life With No
Apparent Cause for the Act.
E. J. Nelson, a peddler of laundry sup
plies, committed suicide yesterday even
ing by taking a dose of rough on rats at
his home. 847 Florida street. His wife
says that the relations between herself
and husband were amicable and that she
can think of no reason for his act.
Nelson was out in a buggy with his
7-year-old son all afternoon and the two
made a number of purchases. Nelson
went into a drugstore and on his return
to the buggy the boy asked him what
he bought. Nelson replied that he had
purchased some poison. The boy thought
nothing of this until on their return home
his father called him into a room and
told him he had taken the poison.
The little fellow ran to his grandmother,
Mrs. Dingle, who lives next door to the
Nelsons, and informed her of his father's
action. Dr. Lagan was summoned, but
the man died before he could do any
thing for him. At the request of the
widow Deputy Coroner Tyrell did not
take the body to the Morgue, but turned
it over to the undertakers.
The deceased was 40 years old, a mem
ber of Mission Parlor of the Native Sons
of the Golden West, and leaves a widow
and three children.
This Week's Wasp.
The crack New York Regiment of Volunteers
Is the special illustrated feature of the Wasp
this week. Colonel Barber. Lieutenant Colonel
Stacpole, the field offlrers and a number of the
members of that regiment were photographed
especially for the Wasp. A flashlight picture
of the scene in the Pavilion on the morning of
the New Yorkers' reception there was also
taken by the Wasp's enterprising photographer.
The fourth Philippine expedition and the trans
port Pennsylvania are other interesting sub
jects of illustration. The harrowing scenes of
the damage done by the explosion at the pow
der works in Melrose, Alameda County, are
fully shown, the engravings being from actual
photographs. There are besides views of the
arrival of transports at Honolulu and some

MAIDENS FIGHT OVER
A YOUNG MAN'S HAND
LAUNDRY GIRLS WHO WERE
JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER.
One Is Lacerated With a Hatpin and
the Other Severely Cut About
the Face With a Knife.
May Murphy, who resides at 370 Eighth
street, and who earns a livelihood as an
employe In the Empire Laundry, is in
dignant and a4so .severely cut. Both In
juries were the result of a disagreement
with a lady friend over the hand of a
blushing youth who works in the same
establishment. Like the fickle lovor that
he is he estranged two fast friends by
bestowing his affections on both, much to
their dissatisfaction. This state of things
continued for a time, and while both la
dies were presumably friends yet they
were jealous of each other. The youth
unaware of the trouble that was brew-
Ing, continued his- uneven course until
the sparks of jealousy In the one time
friends burst into flames.
Some few nights ago. while Miss Mur
phy was leaving the laundry, she waa
brought to task by her rival and a
"scrap" ensued. Both girls forgot the
rules usually governing such contests
and used everything within reach. In
protecting herself from injury Miss Mur
phy pulled her hatpin out and allowed her
locks to fall around her. She then made
a vicious stab at her foe and suc?Â»eded
In inflicting a laceration of the eye.
Friends parted the combatants and hos
tilities ceased for the time being. They
met again lust night and in th.^ fight that
followed Miss Murphy sustained a deep
gash across the chin and a cut beneath
the right eye.
Accompanied by the cause of all tho
trouble she visited the Receiving Hospi
tal, where Dr. F. Timothy Fitzgibbon p.nl
lantly repaired the damage, winning the
everlasting gratitude of the wounded
n-aiden.
What the outcome of the trouble wi!! bÂ»
is hard to say, as Miss Murphy, by her
pitiful condition, has pained a strong
hold on the youth's affections.
She refuses to give the name of her as
sailant.

ENGLISH DEATH DUES.
The fatness of the English national j
purse is largely owing to the increase
of the death duties, which has exceeded
all expectation. The part of the act re
lating to the death duties came into op
eration on the expiration of the Ist day of
August, 1894, in the middle of a financial
year, and the experience of the second
half of the year 1894-95 was insufficient to
give any clear Indication of the financial
effects of the' changes which it intro
duced. The increased revenue from all
the death duties during that period was
Â£1,138.000, and it is estimated that Â£960,
000 of that sum was attributable to the
new act.
The financial year 1895-96 was the first
complete year during which the statute
was In force; the net gain to the ex
chequer was Â£2,885.000, as compared with
1894-95, and Â£4,023,000 as compared with
1893-94, the last year before the passing of
the act. Thus, In eighteen months, in
stead of in several years, there were real
ized the anticipations of Sir William Har
court that the ultimate net gain to the
revenue from the provisions of the act !
would be about Â£4.000.000. In July, 1896,
the finance act of 1890 came into opera
tion. ,It contained certain clauses relat
ing to the death duties, the objects of
which were not to depart from the prin
ciples of the act of 1594, but to remove
some cases of hardship which had be
come manifest in the working of the
original act. '.. *>-
Owing to the alleviations introduced by
those clauses the death duties fell slight
ly for the year IS9G-97, yielding Â£13,963,000,
as compared with Â£14,058,605 In the pre
vious year; they, nevertheless, exceeded
the Chancellor of the Exchequer's esti
mate for the year. In 1897-98 the yield has
been Â£15.328.000. an increase of Â£1,3*55,000,
and Â£1,400,000 above the estimate.â

THE REVOLUTIONARY FURY.
Theroigne de Merleourt, dressed in a
riding habit of the color of blood, a
sword by her side and two pistols in her
belt, was the first who broke open the
gates of the Invalides. She was one of the
firsi to attack the Bastile, and as a re
ward a saber d'homme was voted her on
the breacb by the victors. She, on horse
back, led the women of Paris to Ver
sailles. She brought back the King to
Paris. In proportion as the Revolution
tx came more bloody, she plunged deeper
and deeper into it. But the end of the
beautiful creature was awful in the ex
treme. When she sought to stay the
progress of the Revolution, the women
called the "Furies of the Guillotine" re
sented her oonduct, stripped her of her
attire and publicly flogged her on the ter
race of the Tulleries on May 31. 1793. This
punishment, more terrible than death,
turned her brain, and she was placed in
a madhouse, where she lived twenty
years. Alphonse de Lamartine, in his
"History of the Girondists." says:
"Shameless and bloodthirsty in her de
lirium, she refused to wear any garments,
as a souvenir of the outrage she had un
dergone. She dragged herself, only cov
ered by her long, white hair, along the
flags of her cell, or clung with her wasted
hands to the bars of the window, whence
she addressed an imaginary people, and
demanded the blood of Suleau."â Notes

Dramatic End of Fred
Adams.
ACCUSED OF A GRAVE CRIME
TBAGIC SCENE IN A THIRD
STREET BARBER-SHOP.
Stepped to a Closet to Get His Coat
and Before He Could Be Pre
vented Sent a Bullet Into
His Brain.
A tragic scene occurred in a barber
shop at 260 Third street, near Folsom,
yesterday afternoon, Fred Adams, the
proprietor, preferring death to the dis
grace of being arrested on a serious
charge.
Several men and boys were mixed up
In a scandal in connection with five
young girls, whose ages ranged from 12
to 15 years. The case was intrusted to
Officer McMurray of the Society for the
TRAGEDY IN A BARBER SHOP.
FRED ADAMS, Proprietor of a Third-Street Shaving
Parlor, Shot Himselt When an Officer Came
to Arrest Him.
Suppression of "Vice, and he made sev
eral arrests. He learned about two weeks
ago that an old man who was a barber
was concerned in the scandal, and on
July 8 Katie Tracey, one of the girls,
swore to a warrant for his arrest on the
charge of criminal assault.
The girls did not know Adams' address,
but yesterday Officer McMurray was in
formed by Tessie Bartelson that he had
a barber shop at 260 Third street. About
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon McMurray
accompanied by Tessie went to Adams 1
shop. They passed the door and the lit
tle girl pointed to Adams, who was seat
ed in a chair in the shop.
McMurray met Policeman Chase and
asked him to go with him while he served
the warrant. They went inside and Mc-
Murray, approaching Adams, said: "I
have a warrant for your arrest." and he
pulled the warrant out of his pocket
"What am I charged with?" asked
Adams, and McMurray told him.
"That's ridiculous," coolly replied
"'That, may be," said McMurray, "but

"All right," said Adams, as he rose
from the chair, and pulling off his linen
jacket went to a closet as If to get his
coat and hat. He was standing with his
left hand toward the officers, and in an
instant they were startled by the report
of a shot, followed by the collapse of
Adams on the floor. He had a revolver
clutched in his right hand and blood was
pouring from a gaping wound in his right
temple.
McMurray rang for the ambulance and
Adams was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Drs. Bunnell and Maher
found that the bullet had penetrated the
brain and death was only a question of
minutes. He died shortly before 6 o'clock
and his body was removed to the Morgue.
The coolness with which Adams delib
erated before sending a bullet through
his brain was marvelous, and is best told
by Z. Lewton, who has been h.s helper
for the past three years. Lewton was
seated in one corner of the shop honing a
razor, when the officers walked into the
place.
"Adams was seated in one of the barber
chairs," said Lewton. "when Officer Mc-
Murray asked him his name. He told
him frankly, and when imormed of the
charge he said there must be some mis
take. He did not seem moved. He asked
what the bail was. and when told ?zOOO
expressed no surprise.
"The officer then told him to put on his
hat and coat. Adams unconcernedly
walked to a clothes closet at the rear of
the room and after disappearing from
view we heard a sharp report of a pistol.
When we reached him he was leaning
against the wall and bloo^. was flowing
porfusely from a wound near the right
temple. 'We laid him on the floor and he
was afterward removed to the Receiving

never accumulated any property or

always neatly attired, and is spoken of
as of a kindly and generous disposition

POLICEMAN
HOSTETTER
IN TROUBLE
Accused of Insulting
a Woman.
HE ASKED HER TO MEET HIM
FORMAL CHARGES TO BE PRE
FERRED TO-DAY.
Lena Peterson, a Servant, Has a
Thrilling Experience With the
Offending Patrolman.
' Serious charges are to be preferred
against Policeman Hostetter of the O'Far
rell street station to-day. He is accused
of insulting Lena Peterson, a servant in
the employment of Howard Vernon, the
well-known court reporter, who lives on
Hayes street, near Devisadero.
According to her story, which was told
to Chief Lees last night, Hostetter ac
costed her as she was getting off a Hayes
street car, and asked her where she was
going.
She replied that she was on her way
home, whereupon, it is claimed, the offi
cious policeman caught her by the arm
and started to drag her along the street.
Hostetter, it is alleged, after releasing
her arm, attempted to make a "date"
with her. Miss Peterson claims that fear
ing violence at his hands, she consented
to meet him at some future date. Evi
dently thinking she would keep her word
Hostetter allowed her to go. Miss Peter
son lost no time in reaching the home
of her employer to whom she told the
story of the encounter with the police
man.
After satisfying himself that her story
was true. Vernon started Out to find Hos
tetter, intending to ask him for an ex
planation.
After a diligent search he failed to lo
cate him, but meeting Sergeant Duke, he
apprised him of what â¢ had happened.
Duke, it is claimed, was anxious to im
mediately bring charges against Hostet
ter before the Police Commissioners, but
as the woman hesitated, he decided \ to
make an investigation.

A young gentleman, whose character is above reproach, promf-
aent in the religious circles of a Pennsylvania village, an exhorter of
the M. E. Society there, Secretary of the Quarterly Conference, and
at one time President of the Christian Endeavor Society, has long
been a user of Ripans Tabules, and says of them : " They keep nay
bowels open, they do not gripe, they do not purge, and I do not have
bad pains in my stomach any more, which I had, with dyspepsia and
constipation, for years^ â in fact, up to about three days after I began
taking the Tabules. There used to be some kinds of food my stomach
! would sicken on â pork, for instance. I could not eat it without having
a distressed feeling. Now everything goes down, pork and greasy
food, that used to make me sick to think of. I always have a few of
the Tabules in my pocket for use if occasion arises."
he asked him what he meant by insult
ing Miss Peterson. In explanation of his
conduct he said that the woman was in
the habit of getting drunk, and that fre
quently she returned to the home of her
employer In an intoxicated condition. A3
Miss Peterson is religiously abstemious
she is indignant over the accusation made
by Hostetter. Her employer keenly feels
the insults heaped upon Miss Peterson, and
to-day he will filed charges against the
officious patrolman.
The woman, in her statement to the
police officials, says that she promised to
meet Hostetter after he had grabbed her
by the arm because she feared that he
would injure her.
WHAT SPAIN'S MISRULE MEANS
Official data which have lately come to
hand serve to throw increased light upon
the subject of Spain's oppressive misrule
in Cuba.
Prior to the last revolutionary outbreak
the amount of yearly tribute which Cuba
was forced to pay into the treasury of
Spain fell little short of the average sum
of $25,000,000. In view of the comparative
ly small number of people living in Cuba
the enormous burden entailed upon them
by this exaction becomes at once ap
parent. In ISB4 Spain extorted from Cuba
in the way of revenues the outrageous
sum of $34,269,410. She applied 512.574.455
of the money thus collected to the pay
ment of old military debts incurred <n
subduing popular outbreaks in Cuba;
$5,904,084 to the use of the war department
in carrying out needed improvements, and
$14,595,096 to the payment of salaries,
pensions, etc., to Spanish officers and
clergymen. Out of the immense revenue
collected from Cuba in ISS4 only $1,193,745
returned to Cuba in the way of benefits.
This fact in itself, without the prolonged
effusion of Mood which drenched Cuba's
soil in consequence of her efforts to free
herself, more than vindicates the right
eousness of that cause which the United
States has assumed in undertaking to
expel Spain from the western hemisphere.
Such is the vast material wealth which
belongs to Cuba that she is destined
within the next few years, under the be
nign influence of free institutions, to be
come one of the richest and most pro
gressive centers of the globe. In reward
for what she has suffered, Cuba will soon
find herself in the fullest enjoyment of
freedom's recompense.â Atlanta Constitu

SPECIES OF BACTERIA.
The bacteria known now number 560
species, according to a London Institu
tion lecture by Professor N. B. Bot
tcrmley, and practically our entire
knowledge of these has been worked
out since 1830 through the influence of
Pastour. Of the harmful species there
are only about forty. Bacteria are
found everywhere in the air and in our
homes, they are so minute that 250,000.
000 could be accommodated on a penny
postage stamp and they multiply with
incredible rapidity. It is estimated that
a human being takes in by respiration
30,000 germs each day. or 100,000,000 a
year. Not only are most of them harm-
] < as, but they give flavor to butter,
cheese, game, etc., and they are the
scavengers of nature. They are abso
lutely necessary for the "round of life."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 22.â stock market
continued in the hands of the small room
trader? -!.-â >. who dealt mostly In Industrial
specialties. They advanced the prices of these ;
early and this held up the standard railroad |
Btocks. Realizing in the specialties later in the
day caused a sympathetic decline- in the rail
roads, carrying prices in many cases slightly
below yesterday's close. Except where stocks
were influenced by individual ca^es. the total
change in prices was narrow and without sig- I
nlflcance. The" dullness may be quite equally |
Interpreted as indicating a disinclination to
buy at the present level or as an unwilling
ness to sell. The future of the international
trade situation is still so obscure that specu
lators are not ready to commit themselves..
Very little light was thrown on the probabili
ties by the day's grain markets, which were
not very active and were hesitating in tone.
There was a weakness in the Continental
grain market and there was selling for for
eign account, indicating the opinion that for
eign crops as well as our own are likely to
yield largely. There were evidences of a pres
sure of funds seeking investment, but they
manifested themselves in bonds rather than in
stocks. The large demand for the new Gov
ernment bonds which were traded in on the
Stock Exchange "when issued" had a favor- !
able sympathetic effect all through the market.
This bond sold to 104%. the last sale being at
that figure. Bids were for small as well as
for full-share lots of $1000. The advance in
other Government bonds was called sympa
thetic. The advantages of the new issue for !
purposes of circulation make a keen demand |
for them from the banks, though the present |
prospective cheapness of money tended to di
minish their value for this purpose. Railroad I
mortgages were absorbed on a large scale to- j
day. The well-secured bonds of reorganized !
ronds whose value under reorganization has !
been clearly fixed were the favorites. There I
was also more demand for the more specula- !
tive Issues of the roads still to be reorganized j
or whose payments of interest are contingent
on earnings. The plenlitude of money also
found reflection in Wall street In talk of syn- !
dicates preparing for financial ventures In
Eastern Cuba. Time loans were made for six I
months at the rate of 3 per cent and sterling i
exchange continued heavy under offering of '
grain bills. London also bought stocks here in !
eplte of a stiffening of the London discount !
rate in sympathy with the fall of London ex- i
change here. Total sales railroad bonds par

A large amount of Americans bills was or- ]

FINANCIAL REVIEW. ,
! NEW YORK, July Bradstreefs Finan- |
cial Review to-morrow will say: This has been I
â  speculatively, an extremely dull week. The
market for several days has been reduced to .
' dimensions of less than 150.000 shares a day. j
i Commission business has been at a standstill |
; and the operations of the professional element, |
i large and small, have been on a restricted I
i scale. It has been, In short, a case of mid
summer dullness of the most pronounced kind.
The war news has been less effective than ever,
so far as the spirit of speculation is concerned,
though at the beginning of the week there was
some accession of bearishness on the reports ;
concerning yellow fever among the troops in
Florida and Cuba, while the idea that Spain
would sue for peace, and the allegation that
Germany had assumed a satisfactory attitude ,
in regard to our operations in the Philippines ;
had a share in creating the stronger undertone,
i which finally asserted itself. The market was
: dull and heavy in the early part of the week i
' but on Wednesday it became more firm in
! tone, with slight advances in the general list
and some more marked appreciation in some
of the industrials. This was in a measure
founded on the drift of the war developments,
I but it would have seemed to have grown out ,
! of the favorable impression by the reports of
I the crops and the harvest; by the reported
success of the efforts to restore and maintain
railroad rates, in view of the large tonnage in |
sight for the autumn months, and by the j
weakening of foreign exchange rates, mainly
or. prospective large foreign purchases of our
! products. These as well as the indications of i
1 active autumnal trade and the abundance of '
! capital in the country, have apparently pro- :
duced a more confident temper among large j
financial interests, though the absence of any
public speculative participation is a bar to pro
gress in the direction of manipulation for higher j
prices. Current earnings have also made fa
vorable comparisons with the results of last
year, which tends to check active speculation
in railroad properties, though it is understood
that preparations are being made for active
traffic on a large scale as soon as the present
crops begin to move. While the feeling of the
professional element, which at present monop- ;
oiizes the market, is bearish for the moment,
there is an underlying sentiment to the ef- j
feet that prices are likely to Improve In the â 
future.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July Wheat started a trifle '
'' higher and light on Argentine shipments and
the slow movement of the new crop. The Liv- !
erpool market showed little change, which, j
considering the weakness here yesterday, was ;
deemed encouraging. Strength in corn and j
firmness of spot wheat sustained the specu- (
lative wheat futures for a while. Later, how- I
ever, the general weakness abroad and the |
near approach of new wheat deliveries In Eu
rope started some selling here. This resulted
in a steady decline until the early advance was
, more than lost. Receipts at Chicago were |
sixty cars. The total of the primary Western i
i receipts was 7000 bushels. Exports from the ;
; Atlantic ports were equal In wheat and flour 1
to 151,000 bushels. Minneapolis and Duluth .
j stocks of wheat were estimated to show a de- ;
crease for the week of 1.400,000 bushels and the
visible increased â¢ 708.000 bushels. September

BRADSTREET*S%IEVIEW.
NEW YORK. July 22.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Midsummer conditions still gov
ern most lines of trade and manufacture, but
the volume of business as Indicated by bank
clearings shows little decrease and is evidently
considerably in advance of previous years at
this time. A feature of the trade this week
is the better demand reported for wool East
and West, largely confined, It Is true, to a few
grades of wool. This appearance of activity
has given a decidedly more hopeful tone to
I this business, which, however, is not heard
from In the manufacturing branch.
Eastern wool markets are relatively the low
! est in the world, and stocks now held, it Is
I claimed, cannot be replaced at lower prices
I here or abroad. Indications that important de
velopments may shortly be witnessed in the
iron trade accumulate. This is partly the re
sult of expected good orders from railroads for
rails, of a larger export business and of a
good volume of small orders for various
classes of steel. The statistical position of
rip iron has been strengthened by the curtail
ment of production and the reduction of stocks,
f.l!. wing a production of an average of nearly
'Â« tons a month since January 1, but
i some shading, especially of Southern iron
! prices, imparts an air of Irregularity to the
: trade. Effects of the reported advance In
I prices by the Bessemer Iron combination have
not been measured, and the result of this an
nouncement Is awaited with interest. Dull
ness has been a feature of the cereal markets.
Old wheat supplies are rapidly decreasing.
I while the new crop movement, although in
excess of last year, does not reach the propor
tions expected. The shipping of Texas wheat
: to California Is one effect of the shortage of
supplies reported. Another feature of the
\ business situation is the active preparation
i making in the coast shipping trade for the
j large business with West Indian points, which
i.= expected to develop as a result of military
j and naval operations. The renewal of sailings
' by coastwise vessels and the practical disap
pearance of war risks are accompanying
j features.
: Rather more attention is given the Klondike
as a result of reported heavy arrivals of gold
at the coast points, and estimates of a sea
sons' output valued at $20,CK>0,000 are current.
! Rather more animation is looked for In the
j outfitting trade as a result thereof, but ad
1 vices from Alaska are not wholly favorable.
I as la proved by reports that large numbers of
: unsuccessful prospectors are anxious to get out
â  of the country.
Following the usual semi-annual crop of
small business embarrassments failures have
again dropped to normal summer proportions.
. the total number for the week just closed be
| ing 188, 50 fewer than last week. Â»Â» fewer than
1 in this week a year ago. 92 less than in this
week of 1898, 51 less than in 1595 and 49 less
j than In 1894.
I Cereal exports continue to "be of a satlsfac-
I tory volume. Wheat shipments for the week
j (flour Included as wheat) aggregate 2,303.469
bushels, as against 2.910.527 bushels last week
; and compared with 1.97K.R28 bushels In the cor
responding week of 1K97. 3.007.050 bushels in
1896, 1,265,096 In 1895 and 3,388.000 In 1894.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. July 22â R. G. Dun & Co.. In
their Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will
say: A state of war does not disturb business.
But reaction after a phenomenal movement of
grain causes relative loss, which many mis
take for decrease In the volume of trade. So
much grain has been required and shipped dur
ing the past twelve months that a decrease
was Inevitable and the granger and Pacific
railroads show a loss In earnings, even com
pared with 1892, though not much yet, com
pared with last year.
After the surrender at Santiago, barely a
week of rest has preceded the sailing of the
Porto Rican forces, but meanwhile the procla
mation opening Santiago to trade on terms sin
gularly favorable to the Inhabitants there and
.the effortÃ to build up business In Eastern
Cuba, are occupying the thoughts of many en
terprising firms. Reduction of one-half In the
tax heretofore paid, with honest instead of
Spanish administration, brings home to Cubai.
residents the meaning of the change and they
also learn the use of money, of which a paper
dollar is as good aa gold, which for them Is a
long step forward.
In the stagnant midsummer season, with
business larger than ever before, the great
manufacturers nearly all share the gain. Once
before, in 1*95, with an extraordinarily small
movement prior to July, the shipments of boots
and shoes were larger than this year, but in
no other year have shipments in three weeks
of July been as large. Only 5,253.200 pounds of
wool was sold last week, and In three weeks
only 12,879,900 pounds at the three chief mar
kets, of which 8,720,700 pounds was domestic,
against 34,124.700 pounds last year, and 23,347,
650 pounds in the same week of 1892, 18.509,000
pounds being domestic.
The iron manufacture seems to be at the
verge of another revolution, since Bessemer pig
is held by curtailment of production on the
Shenandoah and Mahonlng valleys at $10 25
at Plttsburg, and yet some steel works have
made enormous sales of billets, 100,009 tons
to the great wire association at prices un
known; 20,0*0 tons to parties at Chicago at
$15 75. and 20,000 tons at Plttsburg at $14 75.
The demand for structural forms keeps all the
works busy and includes for the week 3500
tons at Chicago in the contracts and 7800 at
Plttsburg in four others, while the plate mills
are everywhere crowded, sheets and bars ore
both In better demand than heretofore, and the
prolonged weakness in cast iron pipe, which
usually requires nearly 700.000 totis of piglron
In a year, may presently be cured..
Heavy sales of lake copper have fixed the
price at lHic and the .output of the last half
year has been 120,447' tons American, against
4840 tons foreign, although three years ago the
foreign output considerably exceeded the Amer
ican. Tin at $lf. 55 and lead at $3 92*^ are
both a shade weaker.
With abatement of foreign needs and pros
pects of excellent crops in many foreign coun
tries, wheat has declined during the week 3c
In price, notwithstanding exports from At
lantic ports amounting to 1,397,020 bushels,
against 1.516,937 bushels last year and from Pa
cific ports 67,755 bushels, against 8H.923 bush
els last year. Total exports for three weeks
have . been 7,399,259 bushels, flour included,
against 5,194.488 bushels laa,t year.
Failures for : the week huve . been 207 In the
United States, against 227 last year, and 17 In
Canada, against 2S last year.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The Hay market seems to be getting estab
lished. The heavy consumers, who have been
holding off so long waiting for a break, have
apparently become tired and have started in
to lay in their stocks. The first large buyer
opened the ball on Thursday and the others
will probably fall in. as the heavy receipts of
the past two or three days have not depressed
values, though the .feeling is naturally easy.
Prices for all kinds are now well defined, ex
cept for fine wheat, and nobody seems to know
exactly what that is worth, as there is little or
none coming in. It will probably be very scarce
this year, as the district that produces it has
a very short crop. Dealers quote it all the way
from $1S(S;19 50, but our quotations probably rep
resent a" fair medium between the extremes.
It is the general opinion that prices will stay
about where they are, with occasional fluctua
tions, for some little time. ;

Hides are weak and dealers say that If it
were not for the strong competition existing
among the local dealers values would decline
still further. .
The Eastern market is weak. The Shoe and
Leather Review, Chicago, of "July' 16, says:
"Conditions are all in the buyer's favor and
there is for the moment but one way to dis
cover the lowest price. That way is to make an
offer."

FUNERAL OF
THE VICTIMS
All the County Honored
the Brave Deputies.
EULOGY BY DR. CHAPMAN
CHILDREN'S SOBS BREAK JHE
SILENCE IN THE CHURCH.
Largest Attended and Most Impos
ing Cortege Ever Seen in
the County of
Alameda.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 22.
All business was suspended this after
noon during the time occupied by the fu
neral services over the five deputies who
lost the-tr lives in Monday's catastrophe.
Not since the birth of the city forty-six
years ago has there been such a general
demonstration of respect as was shown to
the remains of the brave fellows who died
doing their duty. To the solemn music of
the bells In the flrehouse tower and
through tho streets, on either side of
which were displayed many drooping flags
at half-mast, the cortege proceeded from
the courthouse to the church. Thousands
of people lined the sidewalks, and had the
First Congregational Church been many
times Its size It could not have held all
â who wished to be present at the final
ceremonies. ' V ' '
No procession in this county ever. more
truly represented the various elements of
Its official and social life. It was the most
positive evidence of the respect in which
the deceased were hold that could possibly
be put forward. The cortege was headed
by a line of police officers, in command of
Chief Fletcher and Captains Wilson and
Carson, in full but draped uniform. Fol
lowing them were three Superior Judges
who are at present on duty, Judge Oeuen
being away on a vacation. This is the
first time that the bench of Alameda
County has ever marched on foot at any
public funeral.
After the bench came the Supervisors,
â with the exception of Mr. Roeth. Then In
separate lines marched the. heads of the
different departments of the county gov
ernment and their deputies. After the
officials marched a body of Oakland
most prominent citizens, numbering sev
eral hundred, and then came the three
hearses, abreast, with the remains of
Charles White in the middle, J. J. Lerrl
to the left and George C. Woodsumon me
right. Large delegations of Order of Na
tional Union, Knights of Pythias, Odd
Fellows and Woodmen of the World were
also in line, all with draped flags and in
signia The procession ended with a vast
string of vehicles reaching several blocks,
in which were people from all parts of the
county. _j_ â¢ 'â  'â¢Â»";
The First Congregational Church was
filled before the procession arrived. The
organ loft and the choir were one mass
of floral offerings, the most prominent
being a piece pent by the county officials,
which stood nine feet high and consisted
of a floral board on a floral easel. On a
white background was woven in purple
immortelles the following inscription:
"Brave and true, C. M. White, George
C Woodsum, D. C. Cameron, J. J. Lerri.
Gus Koch." J-arge floral pieces of beau
tiful design were also sent by the different j
lodges with which the deceased were con
nected and by friends of citizens from
all parts of the county. ...-;
When the services opened every aisle
and every corner was Jammed with peo
ple, while thousands were forced to re
main outside. The three caskets were
placed in front of the choir and were cov
ered with flowers before the ceremony
commenced. The relatives of the deceased
v. â¢ re present and nothing broke the pain
ful stillness except the mournful tolling
of the bell and the occasional sobs from
the younger children of the late Deputy
Sheriff Lerri. ,- â 
The church choir sang Lead, Kindly
Light." In such tender tones that at its
close hundreds of handkerchiefs were be
ing pressed to sorrowful eyes. Rev. C. R.
Brown invoked a blessing on those who
were left behind, and Rev. C. 11. Hill
prayed in the same spirit. The Masonic
quartet, composed of friends of the de
ceased, sang Beyond the smiling and the
weeping." after which Rev. Dr. Pierce of
BerKeley made a short address as the
representative from the late George
Woodsum's lodge. He referred briefly to
the Incident which had caused the de
ceased to lay down their lives at the call
of duty, stating that they had done it
that the safety of others might be pre
served.
Rev. Dr. Dille spoke a few words on the
great lesson taught by death In this in
stance, saying: "It has wiped away all
differences of sect, of opinions and of
caste. These noble fellows gave all they
had to give, and surely God will ac-

Building Operations on

A BRIGHTER ERA PREDICTED.
OF THE GENERAL
REAL ESTATE MARKET.
Review of the Records, New Build
ing Contracts, Recent Sales
and Other Note* of
Interest.
The sole business of the real estate
market at present seems to be absorbed
In a Roneral effort of brokers in fathom
ing the present stagnation and deducting
and advancing some encourageing and
satisfactory conclusion as a sort of pro
phecy for Rood times in store for the Im
mediate future. Some advanced the the
ory that the Hawaiian annexation treaty
is one of the coming and destined sources
of salvation, others to still other sources
of like nature; but before any beneficial
effects can -be had In this or other direc
tions the market shall, in all probability,
have worked Its own destination to suc
cess.
The opening of the new ferry depot,
however, will have an immediate and
salutary effect In improving the valua
tion of property around and in the imme
diate vicinity of the water front. Exten
sive building improvements have already
been planned by property-owners and will
be In keeping with the general surround
ings. After the old buildings now in
front of the new depot are demolished the
aspect of the general water front will
hftre assumed an entirely different ap
ijfarance.
Building operations are still steadily
increasing throughout the city generally
and reality brokers predict an era of
prosperity in this department of their
business. Hayes Valley and vicinity
knowledge our obligations to them. These
men belong not to their immediate fam
ilies alone, they belong to us and to the
world. It is such men as these who leave
a legacy more precious than gold. They
have done their duty and have died for
It, and no man can do more." ;"Cr â 
In conclusion Dr. Dille drew a compari
son between the dead officers and the
heroes that have been brought into promi
nence by the incidents of the present
war. â¢ . â¢:â  .
Dr. E. S. Chapman, who was, chosen to
deliver the eulogy, was the next speaker.
He said:
In all the history of our city such a seenÂ©
as this was never before witnessed. No
funeral train so vast, bo thoroughly
representative of all classes of society and
so truly and deeply sympathetic, ever be
fore blocked our streets and taxed to its
utmost our largest auditorium. A church
altar so crowded with somber caskets all
enwreathed and bedecked by floral tributes
of love and esteem has been heretofore un
known.
There ie a- deep significance in all this
solemn and impressive pageantry. It means
more than an ordinary tribute of regard for
the recently departed. It is not the court
we pay to what is known as worldly great
ness. We have not met to Bound the praises
of those who have attained great eminence
in fields of learning or of statecraft or on
the field of battle, or of those who have
been favored with large natural endow
ments. Our fallen brother* were plain,
common men like ourselves. And yet we
bow In reverence In the presence of their
silent remains to-day, and honor them with
our tributes of appreciation and esteem.
It ie our tribute of regard for true, manly
courage.
". Our fallen brothers were each an em
bodiment of such manly courage. They
knew and appreciated the danger which
confronted them. They were not unmindful
of It; they were not Indifferent to It. They
â¢ realized it in all its unwelcome aspects, and
yet they faced the peril with nerves of steel
and hearts that would not shrink. But that
courage shines with a brighter glow when
we remember that it was exercised In un
faltering fidelity to a sacred public trust.
Into the hands of these men we commit
ted the Interests of human society. It waÂ»
theirs, at every sacrifice and in the face
of every danger, to ferret out and bring to
just and righteous ; Judgment all whose
character and deeds endangered the peace
and security of the community. They rec
ognized the sacredness of that trust, and
at the peril and even the sacrifice of their
lives they were unfalteringly faithful. "A
public office is a public trust" are the great
words of a great American statesman. It
seems so easy for many in these days to
forget this truth, and when exalted to high
stations and made the custodians of great
public interests to consult their own selfish
ends at the sacrifice of public trust. A
true and faithful public official is entitled
to the profound admiration and esteem and
confidence of all his fellow men. Nowhere
does manhood shine with a brighter luster
than In the faithful public official. God
give us men, men whom the lust of office
will not kill; men whom the spoils of office
cannot buy; men who possess opinions and
a will; men of honor; men who will not He.
We pay our tribute â¢of regard to the
courageous, manly fidelity of our fallen
brothers, and commend their heroic example
to all who may come after them. What a
lesson do we here learn respecting the ter
rible price at which our peace and security
are purchased. In the mad act of this Mon
golian maniac we see an illustration of the
perils with which the Interests of human
society are constantly assailed, and in the
red glare of this early morning explosion we
read the etory of the perpetual peril which
besets the guardians of our security and
peace. ' We are too wont to overlook or for
get these things. We sleep securely on the
ocean steamer, unmindful of the man on
guard whose constant vigil secures us from
the perils that environ our way as we pass
on securely over rugged- rocks where, lean
and gaunt, death leers beneath the glassy
sea. We ride securely on the flying train,
rocked to sweet . repose by Its rapid move
ments, forgetful of the man whose eye
constantly rests on the shiny track
through all the weary watches of . the
night. We rest securely in our homes and
rejoice In the value of our possessions, too
often Indifferent to the dangers which con
front the men whom we have placed on
guard and by whose unfaltering . fidelity In
the midst of every peril our interests are
kept in security. â¢. â  .

County Officials Express Their
Regard for the Dead
Deputies.
The committee appointed by the county
officials to draft suitable resolutions to be
sent to the families of the deceased, pre
sented the following to the officials this
morning, and their report was unanimous
ly adopted:
Whereas, Through a most intimate acquaint
ance with the deceased, we had come to ad
mire them, not only fur their manly courage
and fearless and faithful discharge of their
official duties, hut also for their kindly, cour
teous and gentlemanly conduct in their MClal

and honor to the memory of the deceased, that
we hereby extend to the families of each of
the deceased, and especially to Sheriff ('ilvin
B. White, our sincere and heartfelt sympathy
for them In this occasion of grief and afflic

bear evidence how much we. each and all of us,
mourn the untimely and heartrending end of
men who were held in the highest regard and
esteem, both as officers and gentlemen, by all
who knew them; be it further
Resolved. That we do attend in a body the
services to be held this day over the remains
seems to be the section affected, as over

HERMIT DIES
IN HIS HIT
Orrin Dunham Had Been
Dead Many Days.
LIVED FOR NINETY YEARS
A CHARACTEB IN OAKLAND
FOR HALF A CENTURY.
Made Himself Very Conspicuous by
Wearing a Cloak Fastened
With a Chain and
Padlock.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, July 22.
Orrin 8. Dunham, the aged hermit of
Franklin street, was found dead in his
hovel this afternoon. There Is no doubt
that he died several days ago, although
he was not missed till to-day.
For probably half a century Dunham
had been a well known character In this
city. He is supposed to have been about
90 years of age, and was known to every
body. For many years he resided in a lit
tle hut on Franklin street, near the water
front. Â»He lived all alone and showed
much eccentricity in the collection of lit
tle curiosities. His shanty is a veritable
museum, though it is difficult to imagine
what interest any one could take in
three-quarters of the stuff he col
lected. Probably eacn one of the rusty
pieces of iron work, crockery, wooden or
naments and a thousand other things are
Invested with an interesting little history,
but all such knowledge has died with the
old man, and the labors of many years
now represent nothing more valuable than
a cartload of old junk.
Last Saturday night some residents on
the water front saw Orrin Dunham, and
since then he had not been on the street
nor in any of his old haunts. To-day the
suspicions of some of his neighbors were
aroused and they forced an opening and
discovered the eorpoÂ» of the oÂ»a man l"ing
on the bed. The condition of the body
caused the Coroner to believe that Dun
ham had died shortly after being last
seen on the street.
The deceased is supposed to have been
born when this century was but a few
years old. One of his daughters was the
wife of Ned Thayer, and it is believed he
had other relatives in this State. The
body was taken to the morgue, where an
inquest will be held.
Dunham had lived In the same house
for forty years. One of his peculiarities
was In his manner of dress. He fre
quently wore a lady's cloak fastened at
the throat with a padlock and chain.

SCHAEFER A FREE MAN.
A Peculiar Telegram Causes Him to
Hunt Up His Children and Wife.
OAKLAND. July 22.â Owing to the death
of Deputy Sheriff White, the only eye
witness to the assault by Alfonso Shaefer
to murder J. J. Hurt, the Wyoming cat
tleman, in the Superior Court room, the
charge against Shaefer was dismissed in
the Police Court this morning.
It was during the sensational trial when
Hurt was trying to secure the control of
his minor children that Schaefer drew a
revolver. Deputy Sheriff White unex
pectedly opened the door behind him, and
seeing what was about to happen, threw
his arms around the man, drawing the
gun to his side, with the remark:
"None of that in here."
White almost threw the man out of the
door and took him to Jail. Hurt was
not aware of his danger until told of
it afterward. Without the testimony of
Mr. White there was nothing to con
vict Schaefer.
Just before his discharge Schaefer re
ceived a telegram signed "J. J. Hurt,
train 3." It was dated at Omaha this
morning, and was addressed: "Alfonso
Schaefer, City Hall, Oakland." It read:
"If they turn you loose, go and live with
your wife, and if they arrest you, sue
them for $50,000."
Schaefer claims to be at a loss to know
what it means. He feared that Hurt had
taken the children and Mrs. Schaefer
back East with him, but a telephone mes
sage to Mills College brought a reply that
the children were still there. He then
started for San Leandro to ascertain if
his wife was at home.
Mrs. Schaefer was at home, and now
the two are wondering what was the
meaning of such a message.
J. F. Evans Withholds Papers.
OAKLAND, July 22.â Joseph F. Evans,

They are statements of her standing with
W. J. Dingee. and are valued at $25,000.
Mrs. Sather gave the papers to Mr.
Evans on Sepetember 21, 1?97, and yes
terday she demanded them, but failed to
get them. Mr. Evans has recently been
appointed Collector of Customs for Ma
nila.

LILLIAN BLAIR SHEDS
SOME REAL TEARS
OBLIGED TO BID A HIGH PRICE
FOB, HER PRESENTS.
Goods Sent Her by General Barillos
Auctioned Off to Pay Custom
Duties and Storage.
The regular auction sale of unclaimed
goods held In the custody of the United
States for over one year took place at the
Appraiser's building yesterday morning,
and among them was one lot, the sale of
which created a great deal of comment.
It was listed in the catalogue as lot 17,
consisting of 2 lady's silk suits, 3 lady's
wool suits, 3 lady's silk hats, 1 straw hat
and 1 bonnet. The goods were purchased
In Paris and shipped in bond by General
Barillos of Guatemala to Lillian Blair at
San Francisco. They were appraised at
$404 3fi and home value $650 86, leaving a
duty of $14fi 50. This, with the transporta
tion, storage and incidental charges,
would bring the amount to be paid before
delivery close to the $300 marlfi
Lillian evidently did not care to pay
such a price for her presents, and accord
ingly let them lie in the storehouse until
they would be put up at auction, when
she might take her chances of getting
them for a song.
When lot 17 was put up she was on the
ground, accompanied by Ford Thomas, a
prominent broker. She at once bid $10 on
the lot, which was raised to $23 in small
bids. When her opponent found he was
bidding against a lady he quit, but the
bidding was kept up by other parties from
time to time until it reached $100. when all
dropped off with the exception of James
Feore, who kept things going at a lively
pace until the price was up to $200. when
he dropped out and Lillian got her silks
for $202.
The bidding interested everybody in the
crowd, as with each bid the lady became
more excited, often making blunders and
lowering the price instead of raising it,
and several times her lips quivered and
tears would force themselves into her
eyes as she saw the handsome presents
of the man from Guatemala slipping
away. Between whiles she expressed
opinions regarding the gallantry of her
opponent which would do anything but
flatter that gentleman.
After the sale Mr. Thomas denounced
Feore for bidding against a lady, and said
W. H. FRIEND
WILL RESIGN
Must Not Do Politics in
a Federal Office.
IS CONGRESSIONAL CHAIRMAN
TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE
NEXT WEEK.
Now Manager for Mr. Hilborn and
Will Succeed J. J. White as
Postmaster of Oakland
Next Sunday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 22.
William H. Friend decided this even-
Ing that he will resign from the Third
District Congressional Committee at the
meeting next Wednesday.
On Sunday next Mr. Friend will formal
ly take charge of the Oakland Postofnce,
succeeding the Democratic incumbent, J.
J. White, whose term of office expires this
week. Mr. Friend has been chairman of
the Congressional committee for the past
two years and it is possible he may re
sign before next Wednesday if any of
those interested in the contest between
Congressman Hilborn and Victor H. Met
calf should decide that after entering
upon his Federal duties Mr. Friend ia
debarred from taking an active part in
politics.
There is on the part of both candidates
however, a decided inclination to take
no notice of the matter, as it is not gen
erally considered to be opposed to the
spirit of the statute. The law provides
that no person holding a Federal office
shall take any active part for or against
any individual or party In the political
campaign. Mr. Friend has called a meet
ing of his committee in Attorney Ed
gar's office for next Wednesday .and as the
proceedings are In no way partisan, but
purely perfunctory, it is not believed
any objection can be raised to his action.
He is the acknowledged leader of Mr.
Hilborn's political interests in the Third,
District, but it Is said there will be no
politics at next Wednesday's meeting, but
merely some formalities to be attended
to in connection with settling the date,
time and place of the Congressional con
vention. At that meeting Mr. Friend has
decided to resign, and as there will be no
more business for the committee his suc
cessor may not be named, as a new Con
gressional committee will be named by
the convention.
Efforts are already being made to se
cure the Congressional convention for
Oakland. Vallejo and Martinez, and as
there will be about 120 delegates, many
of them from the interior portion of the
district, it is probable that the convention
may go to Vallejo. it being the most cen
tral locality in the district.
Next Thursday the Alameda County
Central Committee will meet to carry out
whatever instructions may be issued by
the Republican State Committee, which
meets in San Francisco to-morrow.
AID FOR MELROSE SUFFERERS.
Alameda Ladies Hard at Work.
Proposition to Call a Mass-
Meeting.
ALAMEDA, July 22.â A committee of
Red Cross ladies, though not acting
under the immediate auspices of that or
ganization, is hard at work relieving the
pressing necessities of the sufferers by
the explosion at Melrose. Already they
have made considerable collections of fur
niture, bedding and food, and have given
it to the worst sufferers. But a great deal
remains to be accomplished. All those
who lost by the catastrophe are poor,
and some of them have lost homes and
furniture and have no means to replace
either. It is pro Dosed to call a mass
meeting and see if enough cannot be
raised from charitably disposed people to
repair the wrecked houses and replace
the furniture which has been destroyed.
The committee which is at work con
sists of Mrs. O'Neill (chairman), Mes
dames Colburn. O'Kell, McGurn, Otis,
Clay, Hickox. White, McLaughltn, Fox
and Miss Kennett. An urgent appeal ia
made to all who have housekeeping arti
cles to spare to communicate with these
ladles, who will see that they are given
to the sufferers.
Cannot Put Out Fire.
BERKELEY. July 22.â The residents of
Lorin are much alarmed over the fact
that they have virtually no protection
from fire. The old truck, once used by
the volunteer firemen, proves to have out
lived its days of usefulness and unless
some action Is taken by the Board of
Trustees to have It repaired the fire com
pany declares that it will disband.
moreover that he had no business to bid.
as he holds the position of janitor in the
building where the goods were stored and
knew their value. Mr. Feore explains his
position by stoutly denying- that- he knew
he was bidding against a lady, and also
says that he has no access to the room
where the goods were stored, and his
knowledge of the contents of lot 17 was
confined wholly to the description of the
goods given In the catalogue, which is
public property. The price paid for the
goods will not cover the duties, cost of
sale, storage and importation.
In spite of Mr. Feore's denial as to his
knowledge of the present value and con
dition of the goods, it is believed that he
knew, all about them, otherwise he would
not have bid $200 on articles that might
have been spoiled by a year's storage. It
is understoood that his action will be in
vestigated. '

ASSESSMENT IS ILLEGAL.
Injunction on the Hale & Norcross
Mining Company Still in Force.
A decision was rendered yesterday by
Judge I^unt In which the court refused
to dissolve the injunction prohibiting N.
W. Fox and other directors of the Hale &
Norcross Mining Company from col
lecting a third assessment on the shares
of the- corporation. It was held that the
assessment was illegal, as the second as
sessment levied by the corporation had
not been completely collected at the time
the third one was called for.

that the defendant has removed a por

It seems that the Board of Trustees
have their own opinion in the matter,
and they say that the truck is not worth
repairing. As no assurance has yet been
given that a new one will be bought
Lorin residents consider that their fire
problem may prove a serious one.
Grocery Store Robbed.
ALAMEDA, July 22.â The grocery store
of H. Hauch on Park street was entered
and robbed three separate times during
June. About $70 in coin was stolen, with
a silver watch, a box of cigars and other
goods. The burglars gained entrance by
prying a board off the back of the store
and then replacing it for future use. No
clew has been obtained to the thief,
though it appears to have been some one
familiar with the premises.

condition for speeding, but the weather
rather cool for fast going. Pointer's time
by quartet's was :3u^, 1:01%, 1:32, 2:01%.

With the League of the Cross Cadets'

the entire regiment drawn up in a
long, straight line, with sabers at "pre

deep interest in the welfare of the regi

him of his contemplated visit to the
camp. President Foster of the San
j. rancisco and North Pacific Railroad
had kindly tendered Life Grace the use
of his private car "Donahue," for the
occasion.
The Rev. Father O'Ryan, regimental
chaplin of the cadets, and the Rev.
Father Grant, accor-panied his Grace
on his short visit.
Immediately upon Archbishop Rior
dan alighting from the train, he was
received by Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr.
and his staff, and escorted to a hand
some conveyance drawn by a fine team
of horses, which had been specially en
gaged for the use of the honored guest.
The command, "Forward, âarch!"
was then given and lo the inspiring
music of the band the regiment com
menced its march to camp. The Arch
bishop rode in the center of the regi
ment, directly behind the regimental
colors.
On the arrival in Camp Montgomery,
the archbishop was driven through
the entrance, while the guard turned
out and saluted him as he passed. The
regiment was then dismissed and
Archbishop Riordan held an Im
promptu reception to the officers in
Colonel Sullivan's headquarters tent.
After spending a few hours in camp
his Grace was driven to the residence
of the Rev. Father Cassin, -.here he
was entertained at luncheon.
Later in the day his Grace drove over
to Freestone where he was the guest
of F. S. Wesinger.
Soon after dr ss parade this evening

field and staff officers, the band and
thirty vocalists, left for Sebastopol to
help in an entertainment that was giv
en at Janson's Hall in aid of the new
church that will shortly be constructed
there, through the energetic pf. jrts of
the Rev. Father Rogers. Several of
the cadets rendered banjo solos, and
the Glee Club made a big hit in their
vocallstic efforts.
To-morrow will be "Field Day."
There are over fifteen events to be
competed for, and the company pain
ing the most points will presented
with a handsome trophy, donated by
Mayor James D. Phelan. The games

MISFORTUNES OF AN
AGED SALINAS COUPLE
Robbed of Their Savings by a
Stranger, They Are Found in
Filth and Poverty.
SALINAS, July 22.â A sad easeV>f desti
tution was brought to light this after
noon. In an old house constructed of
lumber nnd burlaps were, found an old
man named Jacob Prohasta, aped 70, and
an old woman named Charlotte Kaska,
aged 68. In an Interview the woman said
that several years ago her husband died,
leaving some little property, real estate
and money. Jacob worked for her hus
band before his death and afterward re
mained with her. This was at Berkeley.
A short time after Kaska's death a
stranger visited her and, she says, pre
sented a paper which he claimed was a
legal document in connection with her
husband's death, and asked her to sign
it. She could not read and, believing the
man, she signed, only to find out a few
weeks later that It was an order on the
bank for all her money, nearly $2000. For
tunately, she held a note for $400, which
she had loaned to a friend, but this will
not be due for a long time, and she may
never get it.
Sick and disheartened she drove to Ne
vada City and Grass Valley in an old
spring cart with Jacob, only to be ad
vised to come here by the doctors. She
was six weeks on the road in the cart,
which was drawn by an old white horse.
The interior of the hut revealed a state
of lllth that beggars description. Dirty
unwashed dishes were scattered around,
the ground Is littered with dirty clothes,
dishrags, remnants of victuals and ashes.
Two beds, unmade, were covered with
filth, and the whole scene would put to
shame the foulest pigsty. The pair will
be sent to the County Hospital.

Society, writes about the chances of

Preparations for Establishing Huge
Hydraulic Plants and Build

Large Scale.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., July 22.â W. G.
Whorf, who went to Cooks Inlet from
San Francisco three years ago, is here
purchasing hydraulic mining machin
ery with which to work claims owned
by himself. William Lenox and Wil
liam Hunter in the new Kenai dis
trict, sixty miles south of the Cooks
Inlet district. This district is being
opened up this year by hundreds of
miners, mostly Californians.
Claims on Copper Creek are being de
veloped by thirty Santa Cruz and San
Jose men, who are spending $10,000 in
putting in two hydraulic giant plants
and a mile ot numlng. This syndicate
is headed by the Towle brothers of San
Jose.
The Sheokleford syndicate of Los
Angeles is spending $20,000 putting in
three giant plants on Juneau creek and
building a thirty-mile wagon road
from Resurrection Bay to Skeloelak.
The same company is taking in teams
to haul ninety tons of machinery and
supplies over this route.
Another San Jose party, consisting
of thirty-one men who went north last
March In the schooner Bowhead from
San Francisco, has secured good
ground on Copper Creek. They are de
veloping It this year and will be sluic
ing next season.
Whorf says Cooks Inlet will produce
$500,000 this season, most of It coming
out in October. The Polly Mining
Company, in which Amador, Cal., men
are largely interested, will take $125,
000 of this out of one claim. Whorf de
clares that miners not afraid to work
can make money in the Cooks Inlet
country, which will eventually produce
millions annually. Its systematic pros
pecting has not yet commenced.
NORTH PACIFIC COAST
ROAD HAS A HEARING
Reduced Assessment Asked on the
Ground of Falling Off of
Business.
SACRAMENTO, July 22.â J. B. Stetson,
president, and W. F. Russell, a director
of the North Pacific Coast Railroad, opor
ated in Marin and Sonoma counties, rep
resented that road to-day before the
State Board of Equalization. The road's
trackage In Marin County Is 63.75 miles
and in Sonoma County thirty-six miles.
For the year ending December 31 last, the
earnings", of the road were $356,993 60, and
expenses $245.8*5 73. The Interest payment
amounted to J80.724 80.
The road last year was assessed by the
State Board at $R50,000. Stetson and Rus
sell contended that the assessment this
year should be reduced. They said that
the business which prompted the con
struction of the road has been about ex
hausted. The timber along the line of
the road had all been taken off, until
there is really no traffic to draw from.
The upper end of the road has no re
sources whatever, and has about outlived
its usefulness.

CHINESE FROM
HAWAII WILL
BE EXCLUDED
Assistant Secretary Howell Over
rules Collector Jackson's
Opinion.
A Prominent Lawyer Says There Is No
Warrant in Law for Admitting
the Mongols.
Call Office, Biggs House,
Washington, July 22.
Assistant Secretary How
ell was asked by The Call
correspondent what action
would be taken by the
Treasury Department if Chi
nese arrived in San Francisco
from Hawaii after the Amer
ican flag had been raised
over the islands.
"The Chinese exclusion
act now in operation will be
strictly enforced by this de
partment," said Howell,
"until Congress meets next
December, when this depart
ment will ask for legislation
on this subject. No Chinese
without a certificate issued
in the United States will be
allowed to land. They will
be sent back to Hawaii until
Congress by law decides
what shall be their status
under the annexation of the
islands."
"That settles the whole matter," said
Collector J. P. Jackson yesterday when
shown the above dispatch from Wash
ington. "If Assistant Secretary Howell
issues instructions to me in accord
ance with the foregoing there is noth
ing left for me to do but to follow
them out to the letter. No, I shall
not make a test case by permitting
one Chinaman from Hawaii to land and
having the matter carried Into the
courts. The Assistant Secretary says
they cannot land, and that is all there
is to It. Not one Chinaman from the
islands can enter this port, and if any
attempt it they will be sent back."
This statement by Collector Jackson
is directly opposite to that made by
him the day before and published in
The Call yesterday. Then he was of
the opinion that Hawaii, being a part
of the United States, Chinese residents
of those islands had a perfect right to
pass from one portion of the United
States to another without hindrance.
He thought that if any Chinese should
HE SHIES HIS CASTOR.
L. B. ELLERT, Who Has Declared Himself EepuWican Canfli
ilate for Governor.
There la a new Richmond In the field to do battle for the honor of
bearing the standard of the Republican party In the coming campaign in
this State. He is none other than L. R. Ellert, twice Supervisor and later
Mayor of San Francisco. It is due to the friends of Mr. Ellert that he
has been brought forward as a candidate. Their declared reason for
bringing him to the fore is first, his record 86 an officeholder, and sec
ond, the fact that they believe it necessary for the success of the Re
pubiican party that the candidate should come frrm this city and not only
be strong in the metropolis but in the interior. They declare that the man
who heads the ticket should be able to successfully meet the Populist-
Democratic nominee in his stronghold, which they assort is San Fran
cisco. Another theory the advocates of Mr. Ellert have, is that unlike
Maguire. he has no official misdeeds to explain to his constituents, and
that for this reason and many others he would lead any Populist-Demo
cratic nominee a merry race in the agricultural districts and finally launch
him upon that river the source of which is political eclipse. As a
clincher they aver that Ellert would poll more Democratic votes than
Maguire would take from the Republican ranks, and that he is equally
strong in the Populist districts.
Mr. Ellert was quite reticent when questioned as to his alleged can
didacy for the high offlce of Governor of the State of California. He
did not deny that, he had such aspirations, but stated that they would
bo governed by conditions that might develop in the future. If when the
grand battle was lined up it appeared that it was a free fight for all,
he would be found in the contest and would take his chances with others
who desired the same honors.
"Now that the subject of my candidacy is a matter of public discus
sion," said Mr. Ellert, "I desire to place myself properly before the peo
ple. It is true that I am a candidate, under certain conditions. For
some time past I have been asked by my friends to enter the lists in the
tournament for the offlce in question. My answer to them has invariably
been what I will say to you, namely: that if the primaries are open and
the delegates from San Francisco go to the convention unpledged, I shall
certainly be a candidate. Whether or not it will be decided that a San
Francisco nominee will be required to meet the conditions that now exist,
I do not know. That is a question for the convention to determine. I have
heard that it has been stated en several occasions that I am in the hands
of my friends. In this connection I wish to say that while I most thor
oughly appreciate their earnest interest in me and am fully grateful
therefor. I shall feel it my duty to wait until the political conditions
are such as I have mentioned. Whether or not that time will come re
mains to be seen. In conclusion I have only to say that my official record
as Supervisor and Mayor Is recent history, and I hope the people are famil
iar with It."
apply for admission here he would be
in duty bound to allow them to land.
Assistant Secretary Howell's position
is indorsed by a leading attorney of
this city who has devoted his atten
tion for years to handling: Chinese
cases, and is thoroughly familiar with
every phase of the exclusion laws.
Speaking of Collector Jackson's opin
ion, as given in yesterday's Call, this
attorney said:
"In the first place, it has been con
ceded from time immemorial almost
that every sovereign power has the
right to regulate foreign immigration
"as it sees fit. It can say who shall
and who shall not come into its terri
tory, and can even go so far as to ex
clude such aliens as it chooses after
they have entered its borders. With
this principle fully recognized by every
civilized nation it only remains for the
legislative power of a country to adopt
such restriction measures as it may
deem necessary.
"In the case of the Chinese in Ha
waii, they are subject to direct control
by the National Congress, for like the
other Territories, the islands are gov
erned directly by Congress.
"The Chinese there are all under con
tract and every contract contains a
clause that they shall be returned io
China at the expiration of a stated
period. They are not residents of the
Hawaiian Islands; they have no domi
cile there in the strict meaning of the
term; nor do they expect to remain
there permanently. Having entered
those islands on such terms prior to
their becoming United States territory
the Chinese cannot claim the right to
enter any other portion of the United
States in violation of the existing ex
clusion laws passed by Congress and
ratified by treaty with China.
"One thing is certain; Congress has
full power to pass any law regarding
them it may think proper, even to ban
ishing them from the islands, and I
have no doubt that legislation will 'je
enacted bearing on the Chinese in Ha
waii soon after Congress convenes. In
the meantime, I know of nothing in the
present laws that would give Collector
Jackson authority to admit them to
this port. If he thinks they are en
titled to land let him make a test case.
It is an easy matter to bring up one
chinaman from the islands and the
Collector can order his landing. The
Chinaman could be arrested and
the case taken into court. lam will
ing to stake my reputation as a prophet
that the court would deport the China
man in short order, for the law is ex
plicit that all Chinese must be provid
ed with certificates of registration to
entitle them to land."

KNOCKOUT
DROPS IN
HIS POCKETS
Arrest of a Suspected
Robber.
DARING ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
FRED CLAYTON, ALLEGED POI
SONER, LOCKED UP.
The Police Think He Is One of the
Men Who Have Been "Doping"
Gullible Strangers. ,
A well-dressed young man, giving his
name as Fred Clayton, was arrested yes
terday afternoon by Detective Wren and
locked up in the tanks of the City Prison.
Clayton is strongly suspected of being one
of the men who have been administering
"knock-out" drops to gullible strangers.
Shortly after 5 o'clock last evening
Wren, who was on the lookout for Clay
ton, saw him on Kearny street, noar
Washington. He was accompanied by an
other man, who is supposed to be his
partner in crime.
Catching a glimpse of the detective the
two men darted into a saloon, Clayton
taking refuge in a rear room. Wren fol
lowed them and placed Clayton under arm
rest. His accomplice escaped, presuma
bly through the connivance of the bar
tender. The detective took his prisoner
to the California-street station, where hia
name was entered on the detinue book.
Subsequently he was transferred to the
City Prison.
An examination of his clothing revealed
two phials â one large and the other small
âcontaining the deadly knock-out drops.
When confronted with the evidence of his
guilt Clayton, who is unknown to the
police, smiled, but persistently refused
to tell where he got the stuff.
During the past seven weeks a number
of strangers have been "doped" by knock
out drops, which were dropped in their
liquor while drinking with strangers, and
their money taken from them. Clayton, it
Is claimed, has been hanging around an
auction house on Kearny street, passing
as one of the proprietors. Several days
ago a stranger, whose name the -ollce re
fuse to divulge, went to the auction house
?,nd was met by Clayton and his pal. They
nvited him to have a drink, and after
partaking of it he fell asleep. When he
awoke he found that his purse, contain
ing a small sum of money, was gone, as
well as a silver watch, which he carried
in his pants pocket.
The police are morally certain that
Ciayton is one of the mon who adminis
tered the knock-out drops. He will no held
until his accomplice is arrested, when for
mal charges will be made against them.
ENTERTAIN SOLDIERS
FROM TENNESSEE
MIZPAH CHARITY CLUB PLAYS
THE PART OF HOST.
A Delightful Evening Spent by the
Boys in Blue From the South.
Music and Refreshments.
The members of Company H, Tennessee
Regiment, were the guests last night of
the Mizpah Charity Club in the assembly
hall of the club, O'Farrell street, near
Webster. The members of the organi
zation, under whose auspices the enter
tainment was held, are all prominently
identified with the Red Cross Society
work.
This was their first essay Into the en
tertainment of a large body of men, and
the selection of Company H was brought
about through the heroic conduct of some
of its men. A group of ladies from the
club was witnessing the men drill in
Golden Gate Park, when a runaway horse
dashed into view. Two ladies were In the
buggy, and their position was a perilous
one.
Sergeant Stacker took in the situation
at a glance, and at great risk stopped the
runaway. When the discussion as to
what men should be invited was in prog
ress the recital of the part they played
In this instance readily carried the day in
their favor.
The full company was present last night
under command of Captain Gaston

Second Lieutenant Stacker: sergeants-
Stacker, Rolls, Kaufman, Ewing and

and Akers.
There was nothing formal about the af
fair. As Captain O'Brien said in a little
grateful speech of thanks: "Your kind
ness makes us feel more like home folks
to-night than at any time since we left
our homes in Tennessee."
Miss Violet Rulofson was the first con
tributor to the programme of the evening.
She sang several sonps and was encored
many times. A quartet of Tennessee boys
âSergeant Jackson. John Jnckson. Ser
geant Coulter and Buck Forbesâ proved
themselves possessed of well trained
voices. The Jackson brothers followed
with a duet.
Miss Salda Dealey made the hit of the
evening by reciting Robert Ferral's poem,
written upon the arrival of the Tennes
seeans in this city. She was recalled sev
eral times during the course of the even
"a. trio of ladies, composed of Miss Clara
Rulofson, Miss Louise Howland and Miss
Juliet King of Honolulu, sang Hawaiian
national songs to the accompaniment of
native instruments!.
An elaborate supper was then served
the soldiers by the ladies of the society.
The evening was brought to a close with
the singing of the national anthem.
The officers of Mizpah Charity Club are:

WELLS-FARGO
MUST PAY
THE WAR TAX
Suit to Be Commenced in the
United States District Court
on Tuesday.
Indignant Merchants Will Compel the Com
pany to Bear Its Allotted Share of
of the War's Burdens.
The stand taken by Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s Express Company, in an endeavor
to shirk the payment of their portion
of the war tax, will be tested at once
in the United States District Court. The
position of the company has been
brought to the attention of United
States Attorney H. S. Foote by the of
ficers of the Merchants' Association.
The complaint filed by them some days
since elicited the following response
yesterday:
Merchants' Association, Mills Build
ing, San Francisco, Cal.â Gentlemen:
I am in receipt of your communication
of date the 120 th inst., calling my at
tention to alleged violations of sche
dule A, stamp taxes, subdivision ex
press and freight under the war rev
enue law of 18U8, by certain express and
transfer companies doing business in
this city.
You further request me to institute
such prompt proceedings against said
companies for the failure to comply
with the war revenue law as will
bring this matter to a speedy deter
mination. You also say to me, "Please
consider the officers of this association
at your service."
In reply I have to say that It will
give me pleasure to receive from the
officers of your association, or any of
them, at my office in this city, 61 Ap
praisers' building, any facts or evi
dence which may go to show any. vio
lation of that law, as also the names
of the persons or corporations who are
engaged in such violations of law.
If 1 should not happen to be in my
office on the occasion of your coming
to see nic, my assistant, Mr. Schlesin
ger, who is familiar with the law, will
be at your service.
Hoping to receive a visit from some
of the officers of your association on
this subject, I am yours most respect
fully, H. S. FOOTE,
United States Attorney.
Complaints had been made as to the
passive attitude of the United States
Attorney in this matter of such vital
importance to the business men of
San Francisco: "We have not been
able to proceed in this matter, as no
complaint has been filed with us," said
United States Attorney Foote yester-
day. "Having: no information on which
to base a suit we were powerless. Of
ficers of the Merchants' Association
called on me to-day and have agreed
to supply the necessary evidence upon
which suits can be brought against
Wells, Fargo & Co.
"We will take the shortest way to
attain the desired relief for shippers.
Under the tax act the company is lia
ble for a fine of $50 for each shipment
they refuse to accept until the stamps
have been affixed by the consignors.
We will probably institute five suits on
this ground."
The officials of the company recog
nize the awkward position in which
they have been placed. For forty years
they have enjoyed the confidence of the
business community and now see their
prestige in danger of being swept
away. Merchants are incensed at the
petty stand taken by the rich corpora
tion, in trying to evade payment of
their share of the tax upon the people,
made necessary by the war with Spain.
President J. J. Valentine appreciates
the situation keenly.
Hardly had the conference between
United States Attorney Foote and of
ficials of the Merchants' Association
ended than Mr. Valentine sought an
audience with the latter. He asked
that action in the matter be deferred
on the ground that the company offi
cials were preparing a large communi
cation, setting forth their stand in the
premises. He urged that the question
was now being tested In the courts of
the East, and it would not expedite
matters to commence addtional suits
here.
Thp Information required by United
States Attorney Foote in the bringing
of the suits will be supplied him on
Monday.
"The attitude of the Southern Pa
cific Company in the matter of the
payment of war taxes has been mis
represented," said General Manager
Kruttschnitt, yesterday. "When the
tax was levied the officers of the com
pany conferred with our legal repre
sentatives and our position in the mat
ter was outlined. We at once decided
upon a liberal policy, placing the wid
est possible construction on the work
ings of the new law, notwithstanding
the expense. We have never found it
necessary to even estimate the num
ber of bills of lading we issue. I am

The War Tax.
Collector Lynch has issued the following
notice to all who ere required^to take
positive that in this city alone the
number will run into tne millions.
This takes no account of those issued
at all our stations throughout the
country.
"This is not our only contribution to
the war tax. We pay on the thousands
of telegrams that we send out during
the day and also on the great number
of checks we issue.
'"We believe our position is similar
to that of any merchant. We sell
transportation. A bill of lading is a
receipt for goods that we agree to car
ry from one point to another. We have j
at no time endeavored to shirk the
payment of the tax imposed upon that
original bill. If a customer asks for
additional copies of a receipted bill for
his own convenience, however it Is but
reasonable that he be asked to pay
for that convenience. The law does
not exact it from us. The clause in
the law covering our company follows:
Express and freightâ lt shall be the
duty of every railroad or steamboat com
pany, carrier, express company or cor
poration or person whose occupation is to
act as such, to Issue to the shipper or
consignor, or his agent, or person from i
whom any goods are accepted for trans- I
portation, a bill of lading, manifest or
other evidence of receipt and forwarding
for each shipment received for carriage
and transportation, whether in bulk or
in boxes, bales, packages, bundles, or not
so inclosed or included; and there shall be
duly attached and canceled, as is in this
act provided, to each of said bills of lad
ing, manifests, or other memorandum,
and to each duplicate thereof, a stamp of
the value of 1 cent; provided, that but
one bill of lading shall be required on
bundles or packages of newspapers when I
inclosed in one general bundle at the i
time of shipmenft. Any failure to issue i
such bill of lading, manifest, or other
memorandum, as herein provided, shall
subject such railroad or steamboat com
pany, carrier, express company, or cor
poration or person to a penalty of $50 for
each offense, and no such bill of lading,
manifest or other memorandum shall be
used in evidence unless it shall be duly |
stamped as aforesaid.
It will be noted first that the law
makes it obligatory upon the part of tbe
carrier to issue, upon d^nand of the
Fhipper. at least one copy of a bill of lad
ing, manifest or other evidence of receipt [
and forwarding. It does not require the ,
carrier to issue more than one copy of
such evidence of receipt for transporta
tion. It provides in the second place that
for each copy issued, whether one or
more, for the same shipment, but one
stamp shall be affixed. This requirement
is attached to the issuance of ordinary
shipping receipts, as well as bills of lad
ing. When a temporary shipping receipt
is issued, to be by its terms exchanged I
for a bill of lading, the latter is the In
strument required by the act to be taxed.
In such cases no stamp need be affixed
to the shipping receipt, but each shipping
receipt so Issued shall provide In plain
terms upon its face that it is issued for
the purpose of being exchanged for a bill
of lading of regular form, to which the
stamp required by law will be affixed.
SUED IN LOS ANGELES.
Leading Commercial Bodies
Attack Wells- Fargo Com
pany's Stand.
LOS ANGELES. July 22.â The unnatrf
otic attitude of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s ex
press in refusing to attach one-cent rev
enue stamps to consignments offered It
will be taken up in united action by the
Board of Trade and Chamber of Com
merce, backed by the Merchants' and
Manufacturers' Association, which has
already begun suit against the corpora
tion. The plea of the corporation for not
affixing stamps is that it has joined a
compact with other express companies,
and that it has no power to act inde
pendently.
Frank P. Flint. United States Attorney,
who brought the recent suit against the
company at the request of the Merchants'
and Manufacturers Association, is quoted
as saying:
"Since the law went into effect the
members of the Merchants' and Manufac
turers' Association have offered Wells,
Fargo & Co. 200 packages, of which they
have kept a record. In each case the
company has refused to attach the stamp
to the regular receipt. I have filed suit
against the officers of the company for
$50 penalty for each infraction of law,
and will at the same time prosecute them
criminally, the penalty for the latter be
ing a fine of $500 to $1000. imprisonment for
six months, or both, in the discretion of
the court.
"I consider the position of Wells, Fargo
& Co. as being utterly indefensible. There
is no right or reason in it. There will
doubtless be a large number of suits
brought against the company, and it will
not only be put to great expense, but will
make itself unpopular throughout the
country, losing a large amount of busi
ness thereby."
out a special license under the war rev
enue bill:
I desire to call the special attention of all
taxpayers who are required under the internal
revenue law to take out special tax stamps (li
cense) for carrying on business under the old
as well as the new war revenue bill that they
must make application for their license dur
ing the month of July, IS9B. A failure to do so
will Incur a penalty of 50 per cent additional,
which accrues on the first day of August, IS9R.
The office of the Collector of Internal Reve
nue is open from 9 a. m. to 3 p. m. every day
for receiving applications for licenses and pay
ment for the same.

RISKED LIFE
TO SAVE HIM
E. Alexander Gallantly
Rescues W. Williams.
OLD FERRY SHACKS VANISH
NEW DEPOT TO APPEAR IN ALL
ITS GLORY TO-MORROW.
Sudden Death of Chief Officer Milne
oÂ£ the British Steamer Ning
chow From Heart
Disease.
There was a narrow escape from drown
ing and a gallant rescue at Sausalito last
Thursday evening.
When the heat and burden of the day
were over, E. Alexander, manager of
Parrott & Co.. and W. Williams, note
teller of the Hibemia Bank, determined
to have a swim. They Fought a secluded
spot In Rlchardsons Bay and then pre
pared to enjoy themselves. Alexander
was the first to cry "Enough!" and was
partly dressed before Williams showed
any signs of coming out of the water.
Just as he turned shoreward he was
seized with cramps, and had barely time
to yell before he sank. Without a mo
ment's hesitation Alexander plunged into
the water, half-dressed as he was, and
swam out to where his friend had goi^e
down. Williams showed no signs of com
ing up again, so Alexander dived and,
after a great deal of trouble, got him
ashore. Some smart rubbing and a quan
tity of stimulants brought the half
drowned man around, and yesterday he
was able to be at his post as usual, a
little bit shaky, but still in the ring. A
handsome medal is to be presented to
Mr. Alexander in recognition of his heroic
act, and Frank Cummings and others are
now taking up subscriptions with that end
in view.
The wooden shanties that have hidden
the view of the new ferry depot are dis
appearing as if by magic. To-night will
probably see the last traces of them re
moved, and by to-morrow all who visit the
water front will be able to enjoy a free
and uninterrupted view of the magnifi
cent-looking building. Visitors to the
water front should visit the grand nave
in the new depot. There is nothing finer
in any ferry building in the world, and it
is sure to impress people who come to San
Francisco for the first time.
The contractors had marly a week in
which to remove the disfiguring old build
ings, but they put an extra force of men
at work, with the result that last night
the structures were leveled with the
ground, and by to-night all the debris will
be removed.
The bell in the new depot is a failure,
as it cannot be heard outside the building.
It rings five minutes before the departure
and again as each steamer is leaving the
slip. This is to notify the passengers that
there is still another five minutes, while
the other teils them that if they are still
on the crossing they are too late, and also
tells the crew of the steamer that all is
clear. From where the bell is now no one
except those In the waiting-rooms and
those on the feiry-boats can hear it, and
It therefore fails in its mission. If a bell
is necessary it should be in the tower,
away above the clock, and then every
body could hear it.
The British steamer Ningchow had her
flag at half-mast yesterday out of re
spect to the memory of Mate Milne, who
dropped dead Thursday night. Mr. Milne
had served a long time on the Ningchow,
and was well liked by all on board. When
the vessel docked under the Spear street
bunkers he complained of being ill but
no one thought it was serious. He was
?3"l he i,? te * in .? r all of Thursday at
tending to his duties, and in the evening
went uptown for a stroll. In the morning
he was v* de ad -.,. Ningchow went over to
Oakland to discharge the remainder ol
her cargo yesterday -afternoon. '
.TlL^orwegianisteamerUra. that came
in from Japan a few days ago, has gone
on Hunters Point drydock for an over
hauling, r She is under charter to load
lumber at Puget Sound for Delagoa Bay
and is to be cleaned up before making 'a
start. It was at first thought that she
was being docked prior to being exam
ined for a transport, but Uncle Sam does
not want her. as he has now all the trans
ports he requires.
Henry Suss had his right leg fractured
by a Third, street electric car yesterday.
He was crossing Third, between Market
and Mission, and the car was on top of
him before he saw it. He was removed
to the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Zabala set the limb. He was then
taken to the French Hospital.
A bevy of Red Cross ladles was in at
tendance at the Harbor Receiving Hospi
tal yesterday afternoon to receive in
structions in the handling of emergency
cases from Dr. Stafford. From 1 to 3
p. m. they thronged the hospital and
were allowed to view the treatment of
whatever cases were brought in:
Chief Wharfinger Root is having con
siderable trouble in providing a suitable
berth for the big steamer Arizona. She
draws 28 feet loaded, and it is not every
wharf on the front that has a sufficient
depth of water to accommodate her. The
chances are that she will dock at Fol
som street wharf. The Arizona has. a
Chinese crew, but as she is now a Gov
ernment vessel these will have to go and
white men will take their places. In the
case of the Mail Company's steamers the
owners controlled the Chinese, so the
Mongolians s went out on the transports.

Examining Public SurveyÂ»-
Surveyor General Gleaves started last
! evening on a tour of inspection of sur
veys in the vicinity of L*ke Tahoe. The
j particular tract is located in township 12
| N.. range IT E.. M. D. M. As it is fertile
I settlers have already begun to look in that
! direction for homes, and the correctness
of the survey should be determined as
soon as possible. Under the United States
Revised Statutes the Surveyor General
must make a personal examination of all
surveys made by his deputies.
Another Till Robber Arrested.
Captain of Police Gillin of the Seven
teenth street station is well pleased with
the work of Detectives Fitzgerald and
Graham in arresting Edward Burns, an
ex-convict, for his participation in tlll
robbing in the Mission with Arthur Math
ews. Burns, when found in his room at
Sixth and Bryant streets at 1 o"clock yes
terday morning, showed fight to the offi
cers, but was finally cluDbed into submis
sion and lodged in the Seventeenth street
