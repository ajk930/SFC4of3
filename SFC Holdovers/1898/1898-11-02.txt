R.H. McDONALD JR. IS A PRINCELY THIEF
BY THE AUTHORITY OF HIS OWN SIGNATURE
Cipher Dispatches That Prove
the Robbery of the
People's Bank.
The Savings Institution Was
Bled to Save the Pa
cific.
When Disaster Threatened Frank Was Ordered
to Handle the Savings Bank or
Hang Himself, i. ..
The startling expose of the wreckers
ftf the Pacific Bank and the People's
Bank which The Call published yester
day morning has created widespread
Interest. For the first time since the
ruin of the banks the public has learned
of the existence of the gigantic con
spiracy that destroyed the institutions.;
Every one of the 13,000 depositors in the
People's Home Savings Bank is vitally
interested in knowing that the wreckers
did not squander the money of the peo
ple from lack of judgment, but de
liberately stole It. It is this proof that
The Call intends to establish in order
that the robbed depositors may recover
some of their stolen property and that
the robbers may be punished for their
crimes. In the establishment of this
proof the record of the guilt of R. H.
McDonald Jr. naturally comes first.
The crime of this man is established In
his own handwriting, in cipher dis
patches that were written long after
the banks were ruined, but before they
had closed their doors. ; .
In the startling correspondence of the
wreckers of the I ac-lflc Bank the let- j
, c r: of Richard H. McDonald Jr. have,
with very few exceptions, little Import
ance in themselves. Dick's letters are
reflected far more thoroughly In. the re
markable answers he received from his
father, his brother and the parasites
that surounded the McDonald family. '[
Even after the father had fled from this
State and Frank McDonald, D. S. born,
M. H. Sherman, TV. H; Eastland. D, M.
Tomblln, George M. Mitchell and others
were touring the eon.tinent and invade
ing even London and \ Paris â¢in a ' wUd:
search for money, the letters of Dick
are still reflected better in the answers
he receix-ed. It was only '-when the
banks were actually crumbling, when
disaster was inevitable, that â¢ : . Richard
H. McDonald Jr. entered the â â¢cbrr^-
epondence as a criminal. In cipher dis-.
patches written shortly before:- tne
banks went down Dick McDonald ex
pressed his desperation, his terror and.
his torment of mind and begged- ... his
brother Frank not to neglect him in the
hour of need, but to give him one last,
opportunity to be a thief. ; ..â  ".; ..â¢'â '.
Richard H. McDonald Jr.- :is perhaps.
the strangest figure in the strange
coterie that ruined the two | big } San.
Francisco banking institutions... ' .'ikf.
had the wildest dreams of . unnatural:
finance â the most peculiar notions v .of
banking success floated" through 1 his.:
brain. He was _, absurdly 1 arhbitio.uis
and saw himself elevated on Â°a .pinnacle
of financial greatness second." to nqnein
the country. His personal egotism Â«a?
monumental. Through the Pacific
Bank, and with the assistance of crafty
flatterers, he believed that he was to
become the greatest man in California;
If not one af the greatest in the United
States. He established a Californlah.
Illustrated Magazine and organized a
San Francisco Printing Company in or
der that he might advertise himseFf.
That advertisement cost" , the" ; Pacific
Bank $60,000. He employed JO^S. Dorn
"THE PEOPLE'S OUR ONLY RESOURCE NOW."
R. H. McDonald Jr. sent a frantic dispatch to his brother to return immediately from New York and handle the People*
Bank, to save the Pacific. Dick feared that in the cloning days ;of the institutions D. 8. Dora and J. E. Farnum werÂ«
plotting against him. This telegram of distress. In his own handwriting:, is given abova.
The San Francisco Call
as his attorney and permitted Dom to
enter Into almost every crazy scheme of
the bank because Dprn promised to
make him Governor of the State of
California. â 
\ln 1892 the attorney had some polit
ical influence and suggested to ' Dick
that in that campaign 7 they capture the
School Board of this city and use it as.
a lever to gain the influence of every j
school teacher, and 'through . them a
power that certainly would be felt in
the .gubernatorial campaign of 1894.
Dorn went so far in his" scheme- as < t to
secure * the nomination of A. F. Johns
and James A. Pariser, who was then at
the head, of the San Francisco Printing
Company, another expensive 'luxury of
Dick McDonald that, the depositors
paid for. These candidates and others,
fortunately for the community, were '
defeated. = Dick . McDonald then had
other .schemes of. political and j financial
ambition. He bought the Panorama, at
Eddy, arid . Jones streets, to illustrate
himself. He purchased ; stereopticons
at great cost, and â under a Â£ mask ,# of
sanctity^ loaned them to ministers- and
congregations in order that his pic
ture 1 might be projected (on the j screens
to , admiring throngs as the coming man \
of affairs California. He hired Pro

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, NOT-EMBER 2, 1898.
DICK PLANS HIS LAST ROBBERY.
When X H McDonald Jr. realized that the Pacific Bank" and it* feeder must soon close their doors he sent a series of
Shir dispatches to his brother Frank. These dispatches are of the most criminating character. Die* : con vie * him
" â¢ self of theft in his own handwriting. The cipher must be read from left to right. The left hand column of. words was
â  â¢ sent by the Postal Telegraph .Company, and the right column by the Western Union Company. Transla ed out of
â¢ â¢ cipher the above telegram . reads as follows: "If you fall with Chemical, telegraph, as I wlshto save a little to defend
"'â¢â¢ â me if arrested. Should Chemical not accept Pa's indorsement make S. and D. also. Keep cool.' â¢
bonds of the Blue Lakes Water Com
pany, each bond having, a face value of
$1000. â¢ The company desired to call In
these bonds and by canceling them re
lease the mortgage for which they se
cured the payment. It was. the pur
pose of the company to place another
mortgage, but to make it a first mort
gage. ' This could not be done until the
â¢first issii-e. of bondr had been canceled.
If any had â¢ been left outstanding they
wouJd have constituted v claim against
the "company. ' Dick- McDonald wanted
to keep "the first bonds,' and through a
lying letter obtained twenty' more, thus
â¢making $20,000. He declared in hjs let
ter that the. -bond's had been mislaid,
but on the very, next day the Pacific
â¢Bank delivered these very bonds to M.
â  ja-gper McDonald/ the uncle of R. H.
McDonald Jx.' It was perhaps very for
tunate for the Blue Lakes Water Com
pany that they would not accept Dick
Mcponald's lying letter. â¢ The twenty
bonds that M. Jasper McDonald re
ceived were burned by the trust com
pany on the very day UiafM. Jasper
McDona-ld received them. Dick. Me-.
Donald's letter to the -trust company
is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO* Cal.,
April 13, 1893.
the California Safe De
posit and Trust Co., City-
Gentlemen: We beg to in
form you that we have in
our possession, but which
unfortunately have been
mislaid, twenty bonds of
Biue Lakes Water Compa
ny, numbers 342 to 361,
consecutively and inclu
sive, each for the sum of
$1000, dated 81st of De
cember, 1891.
As we are unable to de
liver these bonds sit pres
ent we hereby agree and
promise to deliver same to
\ou as soon as they are
found.
. We hereby further ; con
sent : and C request that you
release . the mortgage >by
which the payment of f said
bonds is secured, and in
doing this we hereby agree
to hold you harmless and
indemnify you against all
cost and expense should
you incur any in the prem
ises* ' . ,
By doing this you will
greatly oblige. Yours truly,
r. h. McDonald jr.
' On the very next day a receipt for
these bonds was made out on one of
the letterheads of {he Pacific Bank, and
was as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.,
April 14, 1893.
Received of Pacific Bank
twenty bonds of one thou
sand dollars each of the
Blue Lakes Water Compa
nyâfirst mortgage bonds,
No. 342 to 361, both inclu
sive M. J. MCDONALD.
By C. E. Anderson.
As already indicated, Dick's corre
spondence becomes of vital importance
only at the time when the banks are
crumbling, and Dick believed that he
haa been caught in a trap. His father
had fled from the State. Frank Mc-
Donald was in the East planning a gi
gantic manipulation of the bank books
which Dick carried into effect. The
banks were being robbed In every pos
sible way, but Dick was committing
the crimes. His situation finally be
came desperate. The Bank Commis
sioners would no longer tolerate delay.
Eastern banks were demanding the
money that the McDonalds owed them.
Money was not coming into the Peo
ple's Bank fast enough to make th.Â»
stealing at the Pacific Bank sufficiently
profitable. The managers, of the Peo
pie's Bank were becoming fearful of
the prospective action of the Bank
Commissioners.
BLEEDINGTHEPEOPLE'SBANK
TQ SAVE THE PACIFIC.
.Attorney General Hart had acted
most shamefully,' 'but it seemed as if
the Bank Commissioners,, for the sake
of their own personal honor, would not
permit him to delay longrer. For these
reasons R. H. McDonald Jr., caged like
a. rat behind the screened counter's of
the Pacific Bank, dispatched to his.
brother Frank a series of most inter
esting cipher teleerams. The cipher
u3ed by R. H. McDonald Jr. was a very-,
simple one and at the same time a most
effective one. He would write out
each dispatch in full, then divide it into
two parts, sending every alternate
word by one of the two great telegraph
companies and the other word by the
other telegraph company. Or, to put
it more plainly, the 'rst word of the
dispatch was sent by the Western Un-.
ionÂ° Telegraph Company and the sec-,
ond word by the Postal Telegraph.
Company, and so on in alternation to
the end.
R. H. McDonald's first cipher dis.
patch was" a frantic cry for $50,000. He
UNCLE JASPER RECEIVES THE BONDS
The above receipt shows what became of the twenty Blue Lake water bonds that Dick McDonald declared to the BafÂ«
Deposit Company had been mislaid in the vaults of the Pacific Bank. The receipt was given the day after R. H. Mo-
Donald Jr. sent "hla lying letter.

asked his brother to see If that sum
could be borrowed from New York
banks or could be realized from electric
railroad bonds or the John Brown col
ony. If these avenues were closed
Dick declared that he would demand
the amount from Farnum, the manager
of the People's Bank. There could be
no clearer proof than this cipher dis
patch of the fact that the People's
Home Savings Bank was being bled to
put life into the decaying- body of the
Pacifltf Bank. The dispatch, after the
cipher has been removed, read as fol
lows:
Cash low. Within a week
must have fifty thousand.

Colony will give that don't
THE BANKER'S LYING LETTER TO THE SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY.
R. H. McDonald Jr. attempted, two months before the Pacific Bank failed, to re
. tain twenty Blue Lake Water Company bonds that should have been sur
rendered. To do so young McDonald deliberately declared that the collateral
could not be found. On the very next day he delivered them to his uncle, M.
Jasper McDonald.

Try Chase and then Park,

er, five thousand amount.
DETERMINED TO COMPLETE
THE ROBBERY OF THE
PEOPLE'S BANK.
In the next ciDher dispatch R. H. Mc-
Donald Jr. wires his brother in sub
stance that all hope is lost unless they
can keep Farnum, the manager of the
People's Bank, from diverting any of
the sums of the People's Bank away
from the Pacific Bank. Frank Me-2
Donald, as his letters show and this
telegram indicates, had determined to
return to San Francisco and rob the
People's Bank. In the cipher Dick
urges him to have, all of the conspira
tors remain in the East, so as to lull
Captain James McDonald into a false
security and, prevent him fr.om draw-
Ing out his nioney. The dispatch is*
dramatic in the extreme. The broth
ers and th'^ir coconsplrators were at
last forced to ttie wall and the McDon
ald brothers saw the gates of the peni
tentiary before them. The dispatch
read as follows:
Telegraph Winterburn
confidentially to oppose
making loans until you
return. Farnum is de
sirous of making one
hundred twenty thousand.
Dyer is three thousand
more overdraft. Young
Johns 1 have stopped steal
ing. He, Dorn, young Johns
here together. Unless
Johns must return make
him and all hands remain
East or Captain will think
we are doing nothing and
pull out his money. Norton,
the thief, makes large Mo
hawk drafts. Don't tarry
too long en route. Be cour
ageous. We will win.
For a clearer understanding of the
foregoing telegram certain explana
tions should be made. Winterburn, to
whom reference is made, is the local
printer and was then one of the most
influential directors of the People's
Home Savings Bank. Farnum, as al
ready indicated, was the manager of
that institution. Young Johns is the
son of A. F. Johns, The young man
had been the superintendent of the
John Brown colony. He had attempted
to secure from Dick McDonald an edu
cation at Harvard. Failing in that, he
then took to the stage and is now "Billy
Elmer," the prizefighter. The 'â¢Cap
tain" is Captain James McDonald,
against whom Richard H. McDonald Jr.
vented all his venom and whom
he attempted to rob. Norton, to
whom Dick makes anything but
pleasant reference, was president j
of the Mohawk Improvement and
Canal scheme, into which thou
sands and thousands of dollars were
sunk without getting one drop of water
in the canal. Dyer is O. T. Dyer,
who was then Imanager of the River
side Bank. He knew he had the Mc-
Donalds by the throat and time after
time demanded overdrafts on the
ground that if he did not obtain them
his bank must go down and carry the
Pacific Bank with it in the crash.
DICK FEARED THAT FARNUM
AND DORN WERE PLOT
TING AGAINST HIM,
When R. H. McDonald telegraphed
again to his brother he was in dire dis
tress. He commanded his brother im
mediately and, as he shamelessly ex
pressed it, "handle the People's Bank
at once." He was fearful, he wired,
that Dorn and Farnum were plotting
to keep his hands out of the vaults of
the People's Bank, and that he would
soon be powerless. He suggests an
other scheme against his uncle, "Cap
tain Jim," and cries out in distress that
Dyer's overdraft is still going up. The
cipher telegram is as follows:
Learn for first time
Electric deal, an option
till January first when
two fifty may or may
not be paid. I consider ;
same impossible. Come j
home immediately and hair
die People's. Our only re
source now. Soon DornÂ»

misfortune. Dyer overdraft

forty since your absence.
Must meet 24th. Park fifty

THEPEOPLE'SBANKTHELAST
RESORT OF THE THIEVING
BANKERS.
The next dispatch of R. H. McDonald
Jr. to his brother Frank would indicate i
that the thieving banker at this end
*of the line was on the verge of insan
ity. He commanded his brother to re
turn at once or take upon his should
ers the responsibility of having de
stroyed the very foundation of the
bank. Dick begged his brother to save
him from the impending action of one
Eastern bank and to make his father
protect him from the other. Dyer had
made another overdraft. The People's
Bank had loaned out $40,000, which
Dick said should have gone to the
vaults of the Pacific Bank. The af
fairs of both institutions were nearing
the end. Dick McDonald had ceased
to be a banker and had become a high
wayman without taking any of the
highwayman's chances. His frantic
dispatch was as follows:
You must come immedi
ately after fixing Chem
ical. I demand it of you. D
bank has run up overdraft

Keep all quiet and be here

rible on me.
DICK DEMANDS HIS BROTH
ER'S IMMEDIATE RETURN.
When R. H. McDonald Jr. . sent an
other cipher dispatch to his brother it
was practically to reiterate the. warn
ings and the pleadings he had uttered
before. The condition of the' Pacific
Bank was hopeless^ but R...H. McDon
ald Jr.., his brother and his father be
lieved that by fobbing- the P.eople's
Bank they might save the commercial
bank. The sons had already, with the
selfish thought of their own future, pro
tected their father's property from the
attachment that they knew would fol
low the failure of the banks. In the
dispatch that follows Dick McDonald
sought to save his father's reputation
as well. The telegram read, through
the assistance of the cipher, is as fol
lows:
Our only sure independent means of
safety now is for you to return imme
diatelyâyes', Immediately. Have' Peo
ple's supply Pacific funds they have or
can easily raise. Before leaving with
pa, immediately renew Chemical Park
loan- due twelfth twenty-nine, plus
fifty at Park. Be suave. Determine
they "will yield. If not, scour around
other banks. Large loans require long
time. Am too weak- to wait. Dyer ras
cally keeping us on string to increase
overdraft. Now nearly one fifty thou
sand. Augmented yesterday five thou
sand. To-day four. Pa should remain
unless health forbids. Looks better
and may be useful to us. Let S. play
with Electrics as long as he likes. Pa
alone knows yon return. Sherman's
knowledge our weakness. Now it is
pulling for time to save ourselves.
" USE THE PEOPLE'S BANK OR
GO HANG YOURSELF."
The time was" growing rapidly short,
however, and Dick realized that a des
perate measure was the only thing to
relieve a desperate situation. The
Bank Commissioners had forced At- j
torney General Hart to take some action
111 connection with the Riverside Bank,
and the Attorney General, with the in
stinct of self-preservation, went to R.
H. McDonald Jr. and informed him
that the notice that had been served
upon the Riverside Bank would be is
sued for the Pacific Bank. This no
tice made the following cipher dispatch
imperative:
To run bank money neo i
essary. If Chemical is not re- j
"HANDLE THE PEOPLE'S MONEY OR 60 HANG YOURSELF"
The above is one of Dick McDonald's important cipher dispatches to his brother.
When read from left to right and translated it reads as follows: "To run bank
money necessary. If Chemical is not renewed Monday" next must .close Tues
day. Have .again and again told you impossible to sell exchange. Our credit
nearly gone. One moment one thing delays electrics. Now you must await
directors' action and time for resolutions to reach you. Dorn and, I regard
Johns' sale a fake. Your electrics a delusion. Come home and use People's
or hang yourself. Again a fool examiner reported us to Hart insolvent, w"ho
visited me Wednesday and to-day. Soon to serve legal notjce on us as he
did Dyer."

Waukcha Lady Changes
Her Will.
â WAUKESHA, Wis., Nov. I.â Carroll
College in this city is Just $5000 poorer
through a game of football. Miss Anna M.
I Sackett, who died last week and who had
lived here maay years, had watched the
work of Carrml College and decided to
assist the work to the best of her ability.
She made her will, giving a legacy of
15000 to the trustees of Carroll for the
benefit of that institution. Last summer
she heard and read so much about foot
ball in the school that she decided to see
the game for herself and ascertain what
it was like. She drove out one day to see
a contest between the college and a
I visiting eleven. She was horrified at
what she saw. She had no sympathy at
all for authorities who encouraged what
she thought was brutality under the
name of sport. She went home and sent
for her lawyer. Under her directions he
drew up another will, which contained no
legacy for the college, and she signed it,
the former will being destroyed.

"I WISH TO .SAVE A LITTLE
TO DEFEND ME IF
ARRESTED,"
It took more than cipher dispatches
to prevent the end. R. H. McDonald
Jr. could no longer avert the crash.
His crafty dishonesty had proved with
out . avail. His glorious dreams of
power had vanished in thin air. The
funds of the Pacific Bank had been dis
sipated in wild schemes. The pockets
of unscrupulous conspirators had been
lined with the hard earned savings of
thousands of poor people. Failure af
ter failure had come to the absurd am
bitions of the McDonalds. The father
and one son were practically fugitives
from justice. Another sat tremb
ling -in his office at the Pacific Bank,
waiting for the crash of the institu
tion and the arresting hand of a police
officer.
Still,' with a -determination to fight
with the money of the people he had
robbed, he begged his brother for at
least that expression of fraternal re
gard which would warn him in time
to commit one more robbery. Utterly
crushed and in terror of the conse
quences of his crimes he sent to Frank
V. McDonald the following cipher dis
patch:
If you fail with Chemical tel
egraph as I wish to save a lit
tle to defend me if arrested.
Should Chemical not accept
Pa's indorsement make S. and
D. indorse also. Keep cool.
These are the dispatches that prove
to the public of San Francisco that the
People's Home Savings Bank of this
city was deliberately robbed by .the
managers of the Pacific Bank. â  There
can be no question that Frank McDon
ald had it in his power to rob the Peo
ple's Bank, and had not only done so,
but was expected to do so again. The
documents also prove that J. E. Far
num, the manager of the People's BanTc,
offered no objection to this robbery. It
is the purpose of The Call to trace the
method of the gigantic series of thefts
and to trace every detail of the con
spiracy from Its inception to its con
clusioh. With that purpose in view and
to present the facts as clearly as they
may be The Call will publish to-morrow
morning the confidential letters of
Frank V. McDonald. These epistles
will Involve more than one character
prominent in the affairs of this city and
State. They will reveal more than one
man in an attitude that he does not
now maintain.
SLAPPED THE FACE OF
A MAJOR OF RLGULARS
Fracas in a Jacksonville Hotel Over
Rent Due by the Gov
ernment.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. I.â At the
Windsor Hotel last night C. C. Robertson,
a prominent citizen of this city, slapped
the face of Major Pilcher of the regular
army, who has been in charge of the
medical supply depot of the Seventh
Army Corps here. After the assault
Major Pilcher ran up the staircase of tho
hotel and threw a cuspidor at Robertson.
Robertson then ran up to the second
landing and vigorously struck Major Pil
cher several times with a light cane.
Guests then separated them.
In the afternoon, the combatants had
some words about rent due on the build
ing used by the uovernment as a medical
supply depot. Pilcher ordered Robertson
out of his office and called upon a sentry,
to put him out. Robertson walked out,
the sentry refusing to interfere in the
matter. Meeting Pilcher at the hotel in
the evening, Robertson .asked for an ex
planation of his conduct and an apology.
Pilcher, according to Robertson, moved
along without replying and he (Robert
son) caught him by his coat and drew
him back, slapping his face twice. â¢ Pil
cher had Robertson arrested.

ored from the Territorials.
The second witness was General J. C.
Bates, who testified as to the Santiago
campaign, the camps at Mobile and at
Chickamauga. He went to see Gen
eral Brooke regarding the lack of
equipment, clothing and other sup
plies. He said:
"The day before we left Mobile we
got pretty well supplied. There were
supplies for recruits. At Santiago we
had bread and meat always. Montauk
Point was not the proper place for a
camp of sick soldiers at his time of
the year. At Montauk Point I learned
that the Long Island Railroad Com
pany had an exclusive contract to haul
the soldiers to the city.
"I issued orders to all the other rail
roads to come in and help take off the
sick.
'*In Cuba medical supplies were woe
fully short. The medical officers said
that they could not .get them. This
was especially true at Siboney. In go
ing over we had enough medical sup
plies, but we were cut down. We had
trouble in getting ambulances taken to
Cuba. We got one for each regiment
and one for each squadron. I 1I 1 think the
ambulances I took were the only ones
ashore when the Rough Riders fight oc
curred on the 24th of June."
When asked what, in his opinion,
was the weakness in the medical de
partment, General Bates said he
thought a great mistake was made in
! not sending medical officers In suffi
cient number with the regiments or
dered to the field. Additional trans
portation should have been furnished
for medical officers and medical sup
plies, ambulances and horses.
â¢What do you think of the propriety
of -allowing female nurses to accom
pany an army into the field?" asked Dr.
Conner.
"I think it would be perfectly proper
to have them at large hospitals, but
not at regimental hospitals."
Replying to a leading question by Dr.
Cpnner, General Bates said that, with
modern arms, danger in removing
wounded from the line of fire was
greatly increased; that it would be
difficult for ambulance men and litter
bearers to live in the increased zone of
fire. In Cuba it was difficult to set
oatmeal and other delicacies for the
sick.
"I think there is rfot sufficient ex
cuse for the medical â¢supplies being
short in Cuba," he added. "Better
preparations could have been made for
transporting We had no way to shoe
horse and mules. I have no recom
mendations to suggest as to the im
proVentent of War Department regula
tions, nor regarding the rations. These
matters have been subject to cpnsld'
eration of boards of officers, and I do
not care to" offer an opinion."
General Bates was then excused.
Lieutenant Colonel James Parker,
Twelfth -tew York, said that when the
troops arrived at Chickamauga the men
had to sleep on the wet ground, with
only one blanket and no change oj
clothing. â¢ He said that the First South
Carolina regiment did not receive their
rifles for a month after their arrival
at the park, the men being compelled
to do guard duty without guns. The
Twenty-flrst Kansas also had to do
guard duty for two weeks.
"When the volunteers first arrived at
Chickamauga," said Colonel Parker,
"their tongues were literally hanging
out for want of water. For three weeks
they could not get wa.ter enough to'
quench their thirst Then the pipe
lines were laid but the water the men
got was not pure, in my opinion. There
'were wells left at the park as land
marks which contained water that .was
bad for them to drink. The usual pre
cautions that are taken with troops in
camp were taken there. I have spent
six years of my life in tents, having
been a captain in the Fourth Cavalry,
and I think any regular army officer
will agree with me that the camp was
established on the proper plans.
"General Breckinridge, when he took
command, did more to change for the
better the sanitary conditions than had
been accomplished 'altogether before.
He had Jumber, which had been applied
for in vain before, furnished the hos
pitals. He provided lime in great
abundance, he had new tentage sup
plied, he gave medicines when needed.
Upon my inspections I found the hos
pitals of the First Division, Third
Corps, of the Third Division, First
Corps, and of the Second Division,
Third Corps, very dirty. The first. was
placed alongside a dump heap. The
dirt in most cases, however, was due tfo
the over-crowded condition of the hos
pitals. The surgeons were worked to
death and too sick themselves to look
after the cleanliness properly. So far
as I knew neither General Brooke nor
General Wade ever made a sanitary in
spection of the camp.
"I think there was disinclination on
the part of the Government to purchase
lime. It could have been secured easily,
or even burned by the troopH. The
Quartermaster's Department might
have accomplished much during this
war that it did not seem inclined to.
It' would have been just as easy to es
tablish at Chickamauga the ideal con
j ditions that prevail here at Camp Ham
! ilton at the cost of not more than $1
j per man."
The night session began at 8 o'clock,
! Lieutenant Frank Strange, quarter
j master of the Third Kentucky, being
j the first witness called. He was at
Chickamauga Park from June 1 until
the 17th of July, when he took sick- and
left. He testified that while at Chick
amauga his regiment was badly
equipped. His regiment was unable to
j procure quartermaster's supplies, con
siting of clothing tentage, etc., because
the supplies were not on hand but in
small quantities. They had so many
regiments to equip that when they had
supplies on hand they, were distributed
among all the regiments. Often the
quartermaster did not have equipment
from a lack of knowledge as to what
was required. Then, when the regi
mental quartermasters went to the
depot they were made to wait for sev
eral hours.
Next were called seven non-commis
sioned officers and privates, who stated
j generally that the rations and clothing
| furnished were good. The witness
Ryan, from whom Dr. Connor expected
to obtain valuable testimony, was a
former private in the Third Corps sig
nal service, who was sick in the first
division hospital at Chickamauga. He
had sent written statements of a se
rious nature to the board, but was un
able to substantiate but few. He stated
that the surgeons were guilty of crim
inal neglect by not seeing that the or
ders they issued were obeyed; that the
medicines prescribed were not admin
istered; that on the day of General
Brecklnridge's review no surgeons vis
ited the hospitals when men were dying
from want of attention; that the water
was bad; that on frequent occasions
meals were eaten when bedpans were
sitting in the rooms, rendering the air
foul; that the sinks were in bad order
and that on one occasion a man was al
most drowned in one.
.To-morrow General- Sanger, Major
Griffith, acting chief surgeon of the
First Corps, and Major Slocum wilL be
called before them, when the commis
sion will have completed this "work-

in his effort to bring Harney and Rainey

news was received with a shout of delight
and when the â¢ last cheer had died away
Judge Murphy continued on the issues
and probable result of the campaign. As
Judge Murphy was concluding Charles L.
Patton entered the hall. He was greeted
with the greatest enthusiasm, - and al
though Henry N. Clement had been pre
sented, that, gentleman gave way to Mr.
Patton, who said: ;
"The hour is growing late so I will not
detain you long. Your chairman has in

ing and note the increasing enthusiasm
I know that, indeed, I have a very good
chnnce. This is due largely to the wise
platform upon which my party is waging
its fight and largely through the charac
ters of the Republican candidates." There
is a provision in the platform to which I
wish to make special reference, the pre
vision providing that ; .all laborers in- the
City's c-aiplov shall I labor but eight hours

which I wish to speak is regarding the
continued statements of my opponent that
all railroad clubs are banded: together to
vote the 'Kelly-Crimmins ticket,' a
ticket, It- Is, claimed, formed against the
friends of labor. Such a statement is an
insult to the intelligence of members of
such clubs. I believe that if the orders
were given out to the members of such
clubs to vote for me they would not, un
less In their hearts they felt that I would
make the best Mayor. I will do my ut
most to give a businesslike administration
and there is one thing I 'can assure you,
that I will. count the money in the City
Treasury and not 'heft' it. I will aJso
attend the meetings of the Supervisors
and Health Board and wherever my pres
ence Is required. I will not be controlled
by any boss, but will be a Mayor of the
people and if any patronage belongs to
that office the people may come to me to
receive it, not to the bosses. There are
no strings to hold me from ray honest
duty."

REPUBLICAN
RALLY, JINKS
AND SMOKER
Representative young citizens, wearing
the red ribbon of the Young Men's Re
publican League, to the number of near
ly 1000, attended the biennial ante-elec
tion rally, high jinks and smoker at
B'nai B'rith Hall last evening. T.he
greatest enthusiasm prevailed and the
young men, who are all zealously working
for the triumphant election of the Re
publican State and municipal candidates,
evinced the utmost confidence in the re
sult when the ballots are counted.
The league has fifteen branches in the
city with a total enrollment of over 3000
voters, and- -every individual member is
doing yoeman's work for the party.
Justice of the Peace Frank H. Kerrigan
presided at the meeting and introduced
General A. L. Hart, who delivered the
principal address of the evening. He said
in part:
"In the pas-t we had two great political
parties, made up of statesmen and pa
triots, who differed only on governmental
policy. To-day in California we have on
â one hand the grand old Republican party,
faithful to its principles, striving to main
tain a stable government and protect
American Industries. Closing us is the
party of Fusion and Confusion, made up
of discordant elements, appealing for the
votes of our citizens to gratify selfish
ambition and lust for the spoils of of
fice.
"At the head of the Republican ticket
we have Gage (applause) who boldly as
serts the principles of the party of which
we are all .proud. His opponent, Ma
guire, represents fusion, which is treason
to our constitutional government. Ho
represents a spotted combination which is
trading principles of government for the
emoluments of office. If this 'party' is
successful the temple of justice will fall.
"Maguire is called the 'Little Giant'
by his supporters. The only giant power
I can see in him is his ability to swallow
three inconsistent political platforms in
one gulp, without a grimace. He be
lieves in and advocates the single tax,
which would undo the people if adopted,
and is only a phase of Socialism, which
strikes at the foundation of American
liberty."
. The remainder of the programme con
sisted of short speeches and vocal and in
strumental music and at the close re
freshments were served in the lower hall.
Tho smoker which followed the speech
making was a jolly success and between
puffs the local and State political situa
tion was thoroughly discussed. Every
voter present expressed a firm conviction
that Patton will surely be the next Mayor
of San Francisco and that the State Re
publican ticket is sure to win by a big
majority. * . , ,
Several candidates on the municipal
ticket visited the hall during the evening
and received hearty welcomes.
ESTEE AND
LOUD ARE
APPLAUDED
Irving Hall was packed last night with
people from the Mission for the purpose
of listening to the speeches of the candi
dates before the Republican Club of the
Thirty-fifth Assembly district. Thomas
Maher presided.
Hon. Morris M. Estee spoke of the lead
ing issues of the present campaign and
presaged a great victory for the Republi
can party, nationally, in the State and in
the Â«lty. He said it would be a travesty
on justice and reason and a shame to
America to send to Congress a man who
did not sustain the administration and
uphold the policy of President McKlnley
who, in this stormy time, has taken the
helm with a strong hand and carried the
ship of state to a safe port. After com
mending the work of Congressman Loud
he said that he felt sure that the people
of the Thirty-fifth would do all in their
power to return him to Congress.
Eugene F. Loud spoke, confining him
self to national affairs and the great and
growing needs of this State. He pledged
himself to labdr incessantly for the best
interests of the State.
William H. Cobb, the Republican candi
date for Assemblyman from the Thirty
fifth District, spoke for a few minutes, re
ceiving hearty applause from his follow
citizens. During the evening a number ot
municipal candidates attended the meet
ing and made addresses on local ques
tions. =
CANDIDATES
WELCOMED
CORDIALLY
The Republicans In the Forty-first Dis
trict were afforded an opportunity at a
reception held last evening at Pixley Hall.
Pacific and Polk streets, of hearing the
sentiments of nearly every- candidate In
dorsed by their party for high office on
the municipal ticket.
Among the speakers were Judge Mur
phy Attorney General Fitzgerald, Judge
Troutt, Martin Fragley, Thomas Graham,
Judge Carroll Cook and a host of others.
The addresses delivered were concise and
dealt mainly with the same topic-the
Keoublican platform and the character
of the men nominated to support it.
The initial address of the evening was
delivered by Attorney General Fitzgerald.
u p briefly outlined the principles upon
which the Republican platform Is ground
ed and which every man elected to office
is expected to maintain. He spoke of the
many reforms which should be inaugu
rated during the coming year for the
city's good. The most important of these
will be the purchase of many of the now
overbearing and crushing monopolies,
such as street railroads, gas and electric
P During the course of the address the
several candidates on both the municipal
and State tickets were mentioned and rec
ommended to those presents as men
worthy of the suffrages of every mem
ber of the Republican party.''
During Judge Murphy s informal re
marks on the subject of the approaching
election, the old subject of the Chute
habeas corpus case was introduced. It
was fully explained to the satisfaction of .
those present so far as the Judge's stand
was concerned in siding as he did with I
Chute and overruling the decision of the
Grand Jury. r . .._.
He explained how, after being severely
criticized for his action in the case, the
Supreme Court confirmed his decision as
the only just and, in fact, only legal
method of procedure.
The various speakers followed in the
course outlined by Mr. Fitzgerald. They I
described the merits of Republican can- |
dldates and outlined the noble and liberal,
principles upon which Republicanism is
cased.
"What Happened to Phelan ?"
Friends of A. C. Berthier assembled at i
Scottish Hall last night and formed an

Mayor Phelan Addresses a Small
Gathering of Democrats Out
Near Camp Merritt.
Mayor James D. Phelan addressed
about 500 Democrats In Richmond Hall
last night, at the corner of Fourth ave
nue and Clement street. This is in the
Richmond District beyond Camp Merritt.
The Mayor did not arrive until after 10
o'clock, and pending his arrival the meet
ing' was addressed by Franklin K. Lane,
Barclay Henley, Dr. Washington Dodge,
T. F. Bonnet and others. Each of these
speakers told his own little reason as to
why he and not the other fellow should
be elected. Mayor Phelan was well re
ceived by the crowd. His speech was
identical with the kind that he has been
making all through the campaign. He
spoke a great many words and advanced
a lot of misfit information as real farts.
At stated intervals the crowd cheered,
then the Mayor paused, after which he
spoke some more words. A number of
the candidates for the minor offices also
spoke.
Golden Gate Republican Club.
The members of Golden Gate Republi
can Club met last night at their head
quarters, Third street, M. H. Morgan pre

had been maintained on the part of the
Republican speakers. This was more

Without Strings.
The independence, efficiency and fear
lessness of a man in office depends, to a
gTeat extent, upon the method of his
nomination. Captain Freese for Pub
lic Administrator has been placed be
fore the people by his friends, and is
not tied to any influence, or bound to
any affiliation' that would prevent the
most faithful service to the public.
Freese and victory have been close
friends in the past and his canvass
seems a winning one at present.

| STRYCHNINE TO END TROUBLE.
, Henry Baker Because of Domestic
Estrangement Sought Suicide.
i Henry Baker, aged 2S years, a native of
England and lately from Australia, while
' estranged from his wife, swallowed one
j eighth of an ounce of strychnine at the
I residence of Mrs. Smith at 172 Hyland
avenue, yesterday afternoon.
As soon as Mrs. Smith discovered her
roomer's condition she notified the Seven
teenth-street Police station and the pa
trol -wagon w-as sent "to the place and
Baker was .removed to the City and
County Hospital, where Dr. Hillman
j pumped him out: yet the deadly drug
i had taken so deep a hold on his system
t that' it Is doubtful if his life caji be saved.
j Baker's wife had left him and went to
I work in a restaurant on Third street.
The intended suicide is an engineer by
profession, but has failed to find employ
! ment in this city, hence the domestic dis
agreement, which led to his attempt
upon his life.

United States transport Peru
ed port last evening and anchored
eiggs wharf for the night. The voy
age was made from Manila in twenty
five days, including a short stop at Na
gasaki. The run from that port was made
in eighteen days.
On board the Peru are some twenty
soldiers and sailors who have been sick
but are now convalescent. Part of them
are home on leave, but the time of en
listment of a number of them has ex
pired, and these are here to await mus
tering out. The purser of the Peru and
the captain retired immediately after the
vessel reached port, and the officers on
watch refused either to give the names
of the returning soldiers themselves or
get them so they might be published as
soon as possible for the information of
the soldiers' relatives.
It was learned, however, that the only
Californian on board is Surrey R. Johns,
a corporal in Company E. First Volunteer
Infantry. He has born in the hospital
suff/ring from dysentery, and not improv
ing, he was sent home. There is also on
board Captain Lee Lynn of the commis
sary department on his way to Washing
ton on special duty; Captain A. B. Petit
and Color Sergeant Harry Palmer of the
Pennsylvanias.
At half-past 6 o'clock Monday morning
a vessel was sighted about nine miles
from the Peru, and at that distance was
taken for the transport Morgan City,
which left Manila two weeks before the

â Prior; ;io this meeting Mr. ' Phelan,
Qoyernor. P,udd and others held a con
ference in the Palace Hotel and agreed
upon the terms of the contemplated
:I>F(.>poÃal.
V As a result of the meeting at the resi
dence of Major Harney that gentleman
called a meeting: of his campaign com
mittee to consider the proposal. This
meeting was held last Sunday in the
'â¢offices of the Harbor Commission in the
New Fejry building. lÂ»i. F. Tarpey ap
peared before the committee as the au
thorized agent of W. R. Hearst, pro
prietor of the Examiner, Mr. Phelan's
personal organ. The proposition to de
liver one-third of the patronage of the
e-lty government ahd the control of the
party organization to the Harney-
Rainey people was made by Mr. Tar
pey: He declared that Mr. Hearst guar
anteed the faithful fulfillment of the
offer in. case of its acceptance, and that
he (Mr. Hearst) would put up his per
sonal check as an additional guarantee.
On this showing Major Harney agreed
to call a meeting of the committee for
last night and submit the offer to it for
its. acceptance or rejection â first prom
ising to do all in his power to secure the
ratification of the agreement.
Surh is a brief history of the circum
stances attending the attempt of Mr.
Ptieianand his friends to sell out to the
people whom the Mayor has so fre
quently referred to as the scum of the
earth, the curse of the city and the
tools, and political agents of the allied
corporations. Mr. Phelan's complicity in
the scheme 1b apparent even to those
who will not see. That the committee
of -450" repudiated him was because of
no lack of effort on his part to induce
the members to come to his arms -and
.be treated as long lost brothers.
It was apparent from the beginning
of the meeting last night that the mem
bers of the committee were determined
to listen to nothing that savored of a
compromise with- the silk-hat boss. As
a matter of fact the few members who
had been induced to favor the compro
mise offered by Mr. Phelan were not
permitted to bring the matter before
the meeting.. An attempt was made to
do so, but the opposing members would
not listen to it. A motion was at once
made to adjourn and it was insisted on
in such a vigorous manner that Major
Harney, after nearly precipitating a
riot by his efforts to secure a hearing
for Mr. Phelan's scheme, was. finally
forced to listen to the voice of the ma
jority and put the motion to a vote.
This was the test vote. Those who
wished to favor the compromise voted
against the motion to adjourn and those
who were opposed to Mr. Phelan and
his methods voted in favor of adjourn
] ment. When it was announced that
j the vote stood 340 for and 80 against ad
| journment a mighty cheer went up.
This outburst of approval was supple
mented by three rousing cheers for
Charles L. Patton and three more for
Henry S. Martin, the Republican can
didate fop Sheriff.
It was nearly 8:30 o'clock before Ma
jor Harney succeeded in hammering
his committee into sufficient order to
hear him in his opening explanation.
It was his object in calling the com
mittee together that he wanted to set
forth, and he did so in a ripping speech.
He wanted to emphasize the fact that
it was solely the best interests of the
party that moved him and no oonsid
eration or "insignificant matter" of
patronage or party control.
"Upon the suggestion of the cam
paign committee," said Major Harney,
"I have called this meeting for the wel
fare of the Democratic party of this
State and of the city of San Fran
cisco. The Democracy of the State of
California appeals to this committee
that the Democracy of San Francisco
shall be united and shall present a
united front at the big battle on the
Bth of November.
"As chairman of this committee I ap
peal to you to throw aside all feeling
and abide by the decision of the Demo
cratic Convention that was held in
Sacramento. It was against us and as
good Democrats, loyal to our party, we
should, abide by that decision, for it was
made by the highest tribunal in State
Democracy. Gentlemen, as the first
business of the evening I announce the
roll can."
"I move we suspend the roll call." â "I
object," "Sit down."â The flght was on.
From all over the hall came motions to
suspend and counter objections.
Charles Reynolds rose to a point of in
formation, but the chair ruled him out
of order. Instead of retiring gracefully
he insisted upon remaining on his feet
to demand recognition. Mr. Harney
put the Question and the roll call was
carried, but its operation was delayed
by Fenton of the Thirty-ninth, who
rose to Insist that Reynolds, who had
remained standing, be forced to take
his seat- Instead, Reynolds proceeded

gangsters are making a hard fight to
capture this city at the coming elec
tion to offset the majority the refQrm
forces will get in the country district*.
A glance at the list of election officers
appointed by the Board of Supervisors
will convince even the most skeptical
of this. Out of the 160 election officers
in the twenty precincts of the city flfvy
three are not on the assessment roll
and a number of then! are city officials.
Among the latter are Police Commis
sioner William Carmichal and Deputy
City Clerk John Varcoe. Besides, there
are firemen, school janitors and city
employes among the appointees. This
is contrary to the law, which says that
electi&n officers shall be on the assess
ment roll, and prohibits city, county
and State officials from acting on elec
tion boards. Nearly all the officers
who presided at the late Republican
primary, where ballot-box stuffing and
other disreputable tactics were em
ployed, have been appointed by the Su
pervisors. . a
The Good Government League has
prepared a list of these illegal ap
pointees and steps will be taken to have
them taken off the boards.
Voters have been colonized, both In
this city and suburban districts. These
offenders will be watched and kept
from- voting, and in this manner the
gang will be weakened.
The gang Is in desperate straits. De
feat is staring it in the face and mem
bers deserting. The members them
selves believe the anti-gang ticket will
be elected, and many of the gangsters
holding deputyships in the various city
and county offices are beginning to

to the platform and leaped up to a po
sition beside Harney, where he re
mained through the roll call, when he
again demanded the attention of the
chair. Harney ignored him and gave
the lloor to Fenton, to whom had been
delegated the task of presenting to the
convention the resolution favoring a
compromise with Phelan and his man
agers.
Fenton's motion never found utter
ance. Just as he had got nicely start
ed Jerry Welch of the Twenty-eighth
moved that the meeting adjourn, and
a. deafening chorus of seconds an
swered him. Harney tried to stave it
off by declaring that Reynolds had the
floor by right of previous request.
"My motion takes precedence," yelled
Welch, and a hundred other voices in
the hall backed him up. The Harney
faction had gathered round the speak
er's desk and sent back an answering
yell. Fenton and his supporters added
to the din and bedlam* broke loose
again.
Above the racket sounded Harney's
gavel. He wanted to explain his posi
tion, but they wouldn't hear to it.
Antone Flynn of the Forty-second rose
to a point of order and announced that
the motion to adjourn had been sec
onded and took precedence over all
other questions before the commfttee.
He was ruled out of order.
"How much is Phelan paying you for
this, Harney?" shouted BUly Maxwell.
"Who?" asked Harney.
Rea and Mackenzie and these leaders
are threatening their followers with
dire vengeance unless they remain firm.
Rea's conviction of slander has had a
wholesome effect. It has resulted in
citizens throwing off the boss" collar
and at the same time robbed the Rea
itea of their favorite weapon. It has
proved that the majesty of the law is
above Rea, and that he and his crowd
must answer to the people for their
acts.
The Police and Fire Departments
have been put at Rea's service, and
Chief of Police Kldward and Fire Chief
Ford are doing yoemen's work for the
boss. Assessments have been levied
on the firemen, and it is stated by those
claiming to know that firemen holding
Bteady positionsâ such as- engineers and
driversâ have been assessed $35 apiece.
It also is probable the police have been
assessed.
Many employers of workingmen have
been visited by Rea and the Macken
zles and urged and threatened to make
their men vote the gang ticket. The
Supervisors and city and county offi
cials have put extra men at work In
order to get theirvotes. The gang or
ganization has left nothing undone to
get voters in line, and they will stop at
nothing on election day to place their
candidates in office.
' Rea has even blocked business in the
Council in the hope of making votes.
When fhe ordlnaace compelling the
Southern Pacific to abandon switching
cars across North First street came up
yesterday it was opposed by Council
men Spring and Macauley, and went
over for two weeks. This was at the
request of Rea, who, it is said, told
Macauley such action was necessary in
order to get the votes of the employes
of the railroad.
The people have tired of gang rule
and will throw the yoke of bossism off
next Tuesday. The reform forces pre
sent a solid front, and the Democrats,
Good Government League and Popu
lists are arrayed against the ganp. ThÂ«

became excited and leaped upon the
platform. Shaking his hand in the face
of the chairman he demanded a vote
on Welch's motion and the house j
cheered him. Seeing the predicament
that Harney had got into Sammy Cole
ma'n, one of Harney's numerous lieu
tenants, got on the stage and attempted
to whisper some outside advice to his
leader. He was tossed off the stage into
the arms of a crowd who did not sym
pathize with his end of the fight and
was bandied good-naturedly about un
til Sergeant Michael Joseph Conboy and j
his squad interfered. Conboy went up i
against Maxwell and for a minute it j
looked as though trouble would result,
but Maxwell's friends pulled him back!
Into the crowd and the police retired I
with Coieman in tow. . '
Reynolds remained upon the stage
through all the racket, and after Max- |
well had subsided again set up a clamor !
for recognition. Welch and his sympa- j
thjzers again began to Insist upon the j
motion to adjourn and Antone Flynn i
complicated matters by moving to ad-
Jouro sine die. His motion found plenty â 
of seconds, but it was ignored by the j
chair, who escaped it by announcing \
that he would put the original motion j
to adjourn.
It was put to a viva voce vote, but j
the result was not satisfactory and a

The election of the ticket means a busi

BEAVER DAM, Wls., Nov. I.â Adam
Hemmer of this city became suddenly In
sane to-day and, securing a gun wounded
nine men and was finally shot himself to
prevent his dQing further Injury.
Hemmer was employed in the machine
shops of the J. S. .Rowell Manufacturing
Company. He was a good worker, but at
times had spells of supposed insanity, the
result, it is said, of religious excitement.
His peculiar ways made him the butt for
practical jokes.
To-day some one placed some tacks on
a stool where he worked and this angered
him. He left the shop, went to a hard
ware store where he rented a shotgun
and, taking up his position south of the
main building of the plant, kept every
one at bay for over an hour and shot
several employes through the windows.
The list of thÂ» wounded is as follows:
Theodore B. Powell, shot in the face
and head.
William Chatfleld, shot in the leg.
Marshal Edward Powderly, shot in the

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. Lâ
Word was received here this evening of
the appointment of Dorey A. Lyon, of
demand for a roll call was made. Judge
SpiJinetti. suggested that two additional
ballot clerks be called by the chair and
after this had been done the tallying
commenced. After a dozen votes had
been called it became apparent that to
get anything like a genuine vote each
delegate would have to rise to his
name. This every one agreed to, a
number of them accommodating the
chairman to the extent of rising to a
half a dozen namÂ£s apiece.
The Harneyltes gathered In a bunch
round the platform and distributed
themselves generously through the hall
and set up a yell at the first rote that
went against them. Through the whole
roll call, which took the better part of
an hour, they kept up the same tactics
and on several occasions the police had
to rout them from the passageways
where they had gathered to prevent
the casting of votes contrary to their
plans.
The turmoil quieted for a moment
and Harney was about to announce the
result of the ballot, when a yell for
Henry Martin, the Republican nominee
for Sheriff, went up in the back of the
hall and was taken up by every roan in
the building. Three cheers were called,
for for Charles L. Patton, and they
were given with even a greater will
than were those for Martin. After three
more for Patton and the same for Ma
guire, Harney got his voice, and above
the laughter of his audience announced
that the vote stood 340 for and 80
against adjournment.

LETTERS FOR THE BLJND.
All modern philanthropy in France, a*
concerned especially with the blind, muÂ»r
be traced back to Valentin Hauy, whose
name ought to be but is not well known
in England. He was born in 1745, the son
of a poor weaver in Plcardy. His own
intelligence and the devotion of his par
ents helped him on from school to col
lege, and while stUl young he was earn
ing his living in Paris by teaching an*
translating. The philanthropic spirit of
the time seised upon him; he grew up la
a world passionate for doing good, either
In theory or practice. Diderot had writ
ten his "Letter on the Blind"; the Abb*
de l'Epee had founded his school for the
deaf and dumb, and Valentin Hauy. at
25. only wanted an opportunity to throw
himself Into some work of the sort. His
choice was made for him by the spec
tacle of the blind men performing at the
fair of St. Ovide.
From that time he set himself to study
the blind, to find out what they werÂ«
really capable of in the way of Instruc
tion. It was a difficult subject, for there
was little or no existing experience to
help him. At last, having satisfied his
mind that something at least was possi
ble, he set to work to teach a blind boy
who sat begging at the door of Saint-
Germain dcs Pres. In the course of In
structing this boy, Francois Lesueur by
name, he half accidentally discovered by
n.eans of some letters printed In relief
on a card of Invitation that his pupil could
feel the shape of those letters with his
finger ends, and so describe them. This
was the beginning, the origin, of the
Braille system, the root idea of all that
has been done in educating tbe blind,â â¢

HOAR SPEAKS AGAINST

\Â°Â° WORCESTER, Mass., Nov. I.âSena

after making reference to local .issues
in the campaign, said: . : >,'*'-' I .
This year has been - .crowded with his
tory and crowded with glory. It-Is also,
". to my mind, crowded with danger. The
flag of Spain, formerly the proudest power
on earth since the day of the Roman, has
gone, down in darkness and in blood be
ore - the victorious navy and army of
the United States. The flag of the United
Â°Â° States has arisen in the eastern sky like
a new constellation. Let us not accept
i the duties and responsibilities of this vic
tory In any temper of vulgar vainglory,
till less of a vulgar greed of power and
gain. The United States comes to these
â  oppressed people, .east and west, as a
great deliverer. To deal with this great
occasion by talking about coaling sta
tions and trade advantages degrades and
belittles it. â¢We have ' not overthrown
Bpain, we have not periled â¢ the precious
lives of , our sons that we may add to
our possessions, or that we may make
money out of our new relations. '
But yet the first duty of the American
people is to themselves,' and when <I say
this 1 say It in cno spirit of selfishness
or of Indifference to the welfare of man
kind. On the contrary, I believe that the
highest service the American people can
render to mankind and to liberty is ; to
preserve unstained and unchanged the
republic as it came to us from the fath
ers. It Is by example and not by' guns
or by bayonets that * the great work of
Americans for humanity is to be accom
plished. : And in my opinion we' are to-day
In a great. dangerâ a greater danger than
we have encountered since c the Pilgrims
â¢landed at Plymouth.' The danger is that
we are to be. transformed from a republic
founded on - the , declaration of independ
ence, â¢ guided by .'. the â ; counsels of. Wash
ington, into a vulgar, commonplace em
pire -founded upon physical force.
I for one am not dazzled by the example
of England. 1 The Institutions of England
which have enabled her to govern suc

with the consent of her own Governmentâ¢
the only government capable of maintain
ing-, itself, there .for v any considerable
length of time. z In the case of the Philip
pines we, are asked to subject â¢- a nation
and to hold it in subjection. We got them
by conquest and bold them by force. In
the case of the Hawaiian Islands we get
them by compact made with their lawful
Government.
Some of our good friends have said
thoughtlessly in their zeal that where the
American flag goes it must stay. But
surely they cannot wish to commit the
country to that doctrine. We planted it
in the city of Mexico, but no man de
manded that it should stay there. If the
war goes on we shall plant it on the
coast of Spain, but we have no desire to
hold permanent dominion there.
If the Philippine Islands become ours,
then under the late decision of the Su
preme Court every child hereafter born
in them becomes an American citizen, free
to come and free to go. Are you going to
hold them as subjects? Are you going to
have a trained and governing class? Are
you going to have the national tax gath
erer the most frequent and the beet
known visitant to every American house?
Are you going to increase many fold your
national debt? These things are involved
in this wild and impassioned cry for em
pire. For myself, I disbelieve and hate
the notion that the American people are
to submit to such a transformation.
MINERAL RESOURCES
OF THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, Nov. I.â Admiral
Dewey has forwarded to the Navy De
partment a memorandum on mineral
resources. oâ¬ the Philippines, prepared
at the admiral's request by Prof. G. F.
Becker of the United States Geological
Survey. Professor Becker made con
! siderable researches and consulted all
the available authorities. Only about
a score of the several hundred islands,
he says, are known to contain deposits
of valuable minerals. He includes a
table showing the mineral-bearing is
lands and their resources. This table
is as follows:;
Luzonâ Coal, gold, copper; lead, Iron,
sulph-ur, marble, kaolin. â 
Cataanduanes, Sibyuan, Bohol and
Panaoanâ .Gold only.
Marimduqueâ Lead and silver â¢ â¢ â¢
Carraraybatan, Bapu Rapu, Semarara,
Negros,-Coal <?nly. ; â¢ ..' '
Masbeteâ Coal and copper.
Romblonâ Marble. . â¢
Samarâ Coal and gold. . "
Panayâ Coal, oil. gas, gold, copper. Iron
and perhaps mercury. .
' Blllriamâ Sulphur only.
Leyteâ Coal, oil and perhaps mercury.
Cebu-r-Coal, oil, gas, gold, lead, silver
and Iron. â¢ â¢ ,
Mindanaoâ Coal, gold, copper ana
platinum. '_
Sulu Archipelago^Pearls.
I Of the coal, Mr.- Becker says that It
lis analogous to the Japanese coal and
i that of Washington, but not to
j Welsh or Pennsylvania coal. It might
i better be characterized as a highly car
bonized lignite. likely to contain such
sulphur as iron pyrites, rendering it
apt to spontaneous combustion and in
: j.urious to boiler plates. Nevertheless,
he says, when pyrites seams are avoid
ed and the lignite is properly handled,
it forms a valuable fuel, especially for
local consumption.
OPERATIONS OF THE
RAILWAY MAIL SERVICE
Interesting Annual Report Sub
mitted by the General Su
perintendent.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. I.â The annual re
port of the general superintendent of the
rail-way mail service shows that at the
close of the year there were 8074 clerks
employed and that. With the closed pouch
and express pouch service, the grand
total of. miles traveled in the service was
285.565,343.
Matter so illegibly addressed as to re
quire special attention before delivery
could be effected, or which could not be
delivered at all, amounted to 13,500,000
pieces for the year, 7,655,000 pieces of
which were returned to writers or cor
rected and forwarded, the rest being
turned into the dead letter office for dis
position. . , ..
The general superintendent deplores the
fact that the number of casualties last
year exceeded the record of any previous
year though the amount Of f atalftles was
not so great. There were 595 casualties,
in wblcn seven clerks were killed, thirty
four seriously injured and 146 slightly. It
is urged that some provision be made by
Congress for the relief of the families of
the clerks killed while on duty and for
the creation of a railway mail service re
lief fund for the benefit of mall clerks
totally disabled or injured in the line of
duty.
It is estimated that $8,982,118 will be re
quiTed for salaries of railroad postal
clerks for the year ending June 30, 1900,
and $4,204,500 for railway postofflce cars,
exclusive of subsidized lines.
WOUNDED BY AN EXPLOSION.
Four Soldiers Badly Powder Burned
at Fort Wayne.
DETROIT, Mich.. Nov. I.â Four privates
of the Nineteenth Infantry, who were left
at Fort -Wayne when their regiment went
South, were badly Injured to-day by the
explosion of a quantity of powder which
they were transferring from the basement
of the guardhouse for transshipment to
the regiment in Porto Rico. Following are
the men hurt:
Private Fred Fisher, Company G.
Private Archie Miller, Cofnpany E.
Private Robert J. Lavall, Company L.
Private Fred Crow, Company v.
With the exception of Miller, who was
badly burned In the thigh, the Injuries
were confined to the men's heads and
faces. Comrades of the injured threw
Duckets of water over them to extinguish
the blaze. It is not thought any or the
burned men will die, but all will be dis
figured.
The explosion occurred just as the men
had arrived at the top of the stairs lead
ing from the basement. It is believed that
the powder was ignited by a spark from
a cigarette which a soldier was smok
ing. _

FRANCE HATES
ENGLAND WORSE
THAN GERMANY
But Will Relinquish
Fashoda.
COMPENSATION NOT ASKED
HUMILIATION CAUSES BITTER
NESS AGAINST BRITONS.
Notwithstanding the Backdown as to
the Nile Valley, Great Britain
Continues to Push Naval
War Preparations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 2.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says:
France will, retire from Fashoda un
conditionally and without asking com
pensation.
Baron de Courcel, whose term as
French Enibassador in London expired
long ago, but who has held on to con
duct negotiations affecting Egypt, will
not be recalled and no haste will be
shown to appoint his successor, with a
view of showing French resentment at
British action, for England has almost
taken the place of Germany as the ob
ject of French hatred.
The Paris correspondent of the Times
says: Baron de Courcel gathered from
a conversation had after the last Brit
ish Cabinet- council that Lord Salis
bury's attitude had undergone a
change, the British Premier insisting
that It was impossible to disregard
public opinion in England and that
nothing, could be done until Fashoda
was evacuated. So far as French pub
lic opinion is concerned there is not the
slightest idea of going to war for Fa
shoda and any government doing so
would be regarded as a government of
imbeciles.
The Dally Graphic says this morn
ing: "We learn from an official source
in Paris that Captain Baratler bears
Instructions to Major Marchand to re
turn to Fashoda and then to withdraw
his expedition in the direction of the
Upper Ãbanghi River, north of the
Congo, evacuating Fashoda and the five
posts established by him east of the
frontier indicated in the Anglo-German
agreement.
"The Egyptian Government will be
invited to send troops to accompany
Major Marchand as he retires from the
Bahr-el-Ghazal territory and .to re
occupy the posts as they are evacu
ated by the French officers, thus solv
ing the difficulty concerning Major
Marchand's revictualment.
"When Major Marchand's retirement
is fully accomplished, negotiations
based on proposals submitted by Baron
de Courcel to Great Britain will be
opened. France is disposed to recog
nize frankly that the reconquest of
Omdurman completely changes the sit
uation as it existed when Major March
and was instructed to proceed to the
Nile. The French Government will
even state that, had Major Marchand
been aware of the Khedival advance,
he would not have pushed his mission
so far east.
"These intentions have not yet been
officially imparted to Great Britain, but
they probably will be before Major
Marchand's evacuation commences."
FRANCE DECIDES

Fisher, one of the Junior Lords of the
Treasury, member of Parliament for
Fulham, and a ministerial whip,

ment has decided to recall the March
and mission from Fashoda.

WARLIKE ACTIVITY
OF BOTH NATIONS
LONDON, Nov. 2.â The war office has
issued a semi-official notification lnj
which It sayÃ It does not object to the
papers announcing military and naval
preparations in general terms, but
points out that It would be "unpatriotic
to publish specific details that might be
useful to a possible foe."
There Is no noticeable cessation in
England's preparations, and the offi
cials are confident of the country's
ability to meet all emergencies. There
were large shipments of guns, Bhells
and war stores to Malta and Gibraltar
"yesterday.
The dispatches from Prance announce
equal activity at Toulon, Brest, Mar
seilles and elsewhere.
The Rome correspondent of the Dally
Chronicle says: "France Is making
preparations at Bizorta, about forty
miles northwest of Tunis. Guns and
ammunition arrive dally, and men are
strengthening the forts, working day
and night. The object is said to cut
communication between Malta and
Egypt in the event of hostilities with
Great Britain. *
BOTTLE OF POISON
INCORRECTLY LABELED
Kern City. Woman Loses Her Life
Through Some One's Care
lessness.
KERN CITY, Nov. I.â Mrs. Lee Why
e-rs, wife of a railroad man, is deadâ a
victim of accidental poisoning. Several
days ago Dr. Taggart of Bakersfleld was
called to treat Mrs. Whyers, who was
Buffering from a mild form of malaria.
He gave two prescriptions, one providing
for a comparatively large quantity of medi
cine to be taken at one dose, the otherâ a
tonicâ containing strychnine, to be given
in small doses at stated intervals.
Dr. Taggart claims that the labels on
the bottles were accidentally transposed
by the druggist and that when the patient
took the strong compound, resulting in
her death, It was due to the wrong direc
tions. The druggist who compounded th<Â§
medicines is C. A. Morris of this city.
He says ho is ablo to prove himself not
at fault.
Dr. Taggart demanded an inquest and it
was held at a late hour' this afternoon.
The prescriptions and labels were intro
duced in evidence, showing the physi
cian's contention to be correct.

Loss of Men and Ships
Off the Banks.
BOSTON, Nov. I.â A special to the
Globe from Gloucester, Mass., aays: The
past season has been very severe on the
fishing fleet. The reckoning for the year
is fourteen vessels a total lose, eighty-two
men drowned, twenty-three wives widows
and fifty-five children made orphans.
The total losses will approximate $170,000.
The terrible gales which raged on the
banks during October, 1897, are undoubt
edly responsible for the losses of three
vessels and their entire crews, while the
series of gales which prevailed during
the winter al6o sealed the fate of many
a Gloucester fisherman.

MADE HERSELF
A BURNT
OFFERING
Awful Case of Self
immolation.
NEW YORK WOMAN'S PENANCE
WAS A CATHOLIC AND MARRIED
A HEBREW.
Crazed by Her Friends' Reproaches,
She Poured Coal Oil on Her
Clothing and Then Ig
nited It.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YOKK, Nov I.â For the faith of
her fathers and the distorted image of
it that troubled her brain, Mrs. Charles
Munday now lies dying in a hospital.
There was. in. her act the blind zeal of
a Christian fanatic and the horrid rites
of heathenish self-immolation. Be
lieving that she had outraged her relig
ion by marrying one of another faith
she, while her little children looked on,
lighted her clothing and made herself
a burnt offering to appease the judg-
ment she feared. Even while she pre
pared for the sacrifice by p<rtiring oil
on her -gown to feed the flames she
muttered formulas of her religion and
fingered her string of beads, telling off
her last prayers before she should seek
rest In the flames from the terror of v
her doom after death. -
She was yoked with an unbeliever,
and not all the kindness of her hus
band, the comfort of a good home and
prattle of her children could redeem the
fact to her mind. She was married
more than five years ago, when she was
a Catholic. No one was more devoted
to her faith in outward ceremony and
Inward conviction. But even this
deep rooted reverence for her religion
yielded when her heart was concerned.
Charles Munday, a Hebrew, met and
loved and pressed his suit in defiance
of the unsmilinp faces of her family
and her friends' plain disapproval.
When she was alone they pleaded with
her to forsake her sweetheart, but she
would not listen. She saw no sin In
giving her heart to an honest man,
though he was beyond the pale of the
church, io she was married to him.
After the marriage the attitude of her
friends did not change, nor did they
cease to impress upon her at every op
portunity that she had wronged her
church by wedding one whom her faith
placed in outer darkness. She brooded
over these matters, and at times she
spoke of expiating her error and win
ning absolution, but they paid little at
tention to these vague threatenlngs.
Mrs. Munday for the last few days had
been more silent than usual, and had
spent much time kneeling before her
little shrine and counting over her
beads. When her husband had gone to
day to business she seated herself in
her ropm and called her little ones
around her. While they stood there In
awed silence she fingered her beads
swiftly and muttered prayers with her
eyes closed. Then she gave the eldest
child some money and sent her to a
store for some kerosene. When the
child returned her mother was still
seated, whispering her prayers with dry
lips.
She took the oil and poured it over
her gown, as though anointing herself
for a sacrifice. ' The children looked on
In silence with wide-opened eyes- Still
praying in broken whispers, the woman
saturated her skirts with the oil. Then
she struck a match and touched it to
the hem of her dress. Instantly the
flames leaped up and the children fled
screaming. The mother, the beads slip
ping swiftly through her finders, still
prayed as the fire licked up toward her
face. In the scorching flames the fa
natic's zeal was swept away, and the
broken words of prayer turned to
shrieks of anguish. When neighbors re
sponded to her cries and had succeeded
In extinguishing the flames, there was
little left of the image of a woman in
the sufferer, but she was carried to a
hospital where the doctors said there
was no hope that she would recover.

TABLETS.
They Cure Stomach Troubles and Indi-
gestion Anyway, Whether You Have
Faith In Them or Not.
Mere faith will not digest your food
for you. will not give an appetite, will
not increase your flesh and strengthen
yqur nerves and heart, but Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets will do these things,
because they are composed of the ele-
ments of digestion, they contain the
Juices, acids apd peptones necessary to
the digestion and assimilation of all
wholesome food.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest
food if placed in a Jar or bottle in water
heated to 98 degrees, and they will do it
much more effectively when taken into
the stomach after meals, whether you
have faith that they will or not.
They invigorate the stomach, make
pure blood and strong nerves, In the
only way that nature can do it, and
that is, plenty of wholesome food well
digested. It is not what we eat, but
what we digest that does us good.

COUNT HENLEY, COME FORWARD.
\A AYOR PHELAN'S Mexican ' candidate for
J \ District Attorney, Barclay Henley, some time
* * ago remarked in a card to the public that the
story of his connection with Maximilian's Govern
ment was an ancient tale. "Every time my name was
presented as a candidate," he said, "the affair referred-,
to by The Call was charged against me, and every
time I was elected." But, added the Mexican can
didate, "I shall have more to say about these matters
further on." ; â¢. :! . .;.;.".
The period designated by Maximilian's old subject
â¢as "further on" has now arrived. We are -withiaa few.
days of election. What has become of the things
Henley was going to say about, his Mexican citizen
ship? Is he playing the old dodge of i. man : who is
full of defenses, but is too busy to make them, or who
' hopes that the people will forget his bluff? ..â¢
Mayor Phelan's Mexican candidate may have been,
elected on other occasions, but unless he explains'
"these matters" he is going to be defeated this time.
How about Maximilian,. Count Henley?.. Speak out.
JUDGE MURPHY'S SLANDERERS.
AMONG the victims of the Dem.6cr.atic an
archists, one of whose principal campaign
cards is slander of Judges and misrepresehta-'
tion of the courts, is ex-Judge D.J. Murphy, Repub
lican candidate for District Attorney. It is charged
against Mr. Murphy that while sitting in Department'
12 of the Superior Court a few years ago he released
a politician named Chute on habeas corpus.. Chute
had been called to testify before the Wallace Grand-
Jury and had refused to appear. He was committed'
for contempt and applied for a writ of habeas .corpus
to test the right of the jurors to question: him, .alleg-'
ing that they constituted an illegal body.
The matter was enjoying some public :attentip.ri at
the time. Judge Wallace had impaneled a .Grand
Jury for the purpose of bringing to hi-s judicial mill
a number of legislative boodlers, and the court was
playing the same part in its creation that. he played
last year in the petition of George K. Fitch for the
removal of the Board of Supervisors. The lawyers
were divided as to the legality of the unusual process
by which the Grand Jury in question had been, sum
moned, and the matter was being iiotly discussed by
the politicians and the newspapers. â¢. At the most ex
citing stage of the difficulty Chute was summoned
and refused to testify. " He unfortunately . selected
Judge Murphy as the jurist to wham he desired to
submit his case.
The latter heard the evidence and listened to the
arguments of the lawyers. Then he wrote an opinion,
which, if our memory serves us, filled a page of the
newspapers. He discharged Chute on the ground
that the Wallace Grand Jury was an illegal body and
had no power to punish for contempt.
Perhaps it will do no good to point out to the
Democratic anarchists of this period that Judge
Murphy's view of the law was subsequently upheld
by the Supreme Court. H, however, they desire to
inform themselves they will find the opinion of the
latter tribunal in the ninety-second volume of the
California Reports, on page 239.
This vindication of his motives in the Chute case
is all that Judge Murphy needs at this late day. He
declared the law as it exists, and it can make no pos
sible difference whether Chute was a good man or a
bad man, a railroad hireling or a saint. If the Wal
lace Grand Jury was an illegal body it had no right
to summon Chute or send him to jail for contempt.
It was afterward declared to be an illegal body, and
so, in discharging Chute, Judge Murphy followed the
law.
It is unnecessary to refine the law points involved
in the Chute case at this time. The purpose of the
Democratic anarchists is to use against Judge
Murphy their old political resource â abuse of courts
and slander of Judges. It is not easy ordinarily to get
away with this sort of political "argument." The
people do not understand law and are prone to look
upon decisions which offend their prejudices as un
just or corrupt. The anarchists know this and make
the most of it.
But no sensible person should vote against Judge
Murphy for upholding the law in the Chute case.
It wouy have been his duty to do that had Chute
been a highbinder instead of a politician who had in
curred the enmity of a few Democratic purists. The
fact is, Murphy is a fine criminal lawyer, a matchless
prosecutor and a brave man, who, if elected District
Attorney, will be a credit to the people and the city.
Because he sent the sandlotters glimmering while
District Attorney in 1879 Â»s no reason why he should
be defeated now.
A combine of the collar factories of the country is
announced, but it is not believed to include the Phe
lan output, . .
THE WRECK OF THE PACIFIC BANK-
WHEN the panic of 1893 was laying waste com
mercial institutions, throwing railways into
the hands of receivers, closing the doors of
private banks, tumbling national banks into insol
vency and laying the cold hand of lost confidence
upon every industry, California stood the storm with
remarkable courage and unquenched hope. There
were a few minor bank failures, which paid out in
liquidation and are now so forgotten that no one
can recall them.
Only one significant bank failure occurred, and that
was such a gigantic crash, such a widespread ruin
and involved so many thousands of people ill able to
bear their losses, that the history of its investigation,
of the attempts. to liquidate the affairs involved, made
up a tragedy that was so long on the boards that it
will be remembered for years, , and the misery it
brought to thousands will long cry out for ven
geance upon the guilty.
The ramifications of this failure of the Pacific
! Bank, the intrigues which preceded it, covering the
I wide distance between the organization of a savings
! bank and the corruption of a Legislature to create a
â  new county, in the wild hope of infusing life into dead
assets and moribund ventures, all make .up a story of
sui passing interest. It involves political ambition,
: intrigues with women, excursions into pseudo litera
j ture, attempts to. control school boards, the seeking
I of alliance with the reputable principles of moral re
form, the effort to serve the devil in the livery of
heaven, the engagement of the honorable profession
of the law not to do justice but to deny it, all to the
common end of betrayal of confidence and robbery
of the innocent and unsuspecting.
The commercial and financial interest of California
requires- 'that the story should be told, to the end that
the world may see how few men there were in our
State capable of making such a .wreck, and that the
â j wreck itself was not caused by any weak or evil con-
ditions in our business methods, arid should cast no
suspicion upon our sound financial\institutions.
The Call has introduced this story in a simple
statement of the case. The tale will follow as told in
the letters, checks, memoranda, records, receipts and
exchanges of confidence, made by the conspirators
themselves.
.We present it in the interest of business morality
and as a warning to others who may be seeking
financial confidence to betray it for their profit that
their sins will find them out, and that past success
:in silencing a newspaper by letting it share in the
robbery cannot prevent final exposure.
. We do this also in the interest of about 13.000 de-
j.pcsitors, whose savings were stolen by conspirators,
â  .in the hope that this revelation may put them in the
way of a partial recovery of their losses,
j All this is not done for the purposes of newspaper
sensat'on. It is done in judicial temper, as an act of
justice not only to the despoiled but to the despoil
er.s, and in this spirit ft -will be exposed to the last
jot and tittle of evidence furnished by the reeking
record made by the guilty themslves, and not by us.
The ground to be covered may be estimated when
we say that its publication in our columns will re
quire many days, and every scrap of it is an original
document created by the parties to the crime, with no
other text than is required to properly head and give
it chronological connection.
TAXATION VS. LAND CONFISCATION
THE CALL recently referred to the movement
in many Eastern States for reform in the
methods of taxation.
In Ne\V York the discussion of this question harks
back to the report made to the Legislature in 1871 by
a commission consisting of the eminent economist,
David A. Wells, add Edwin Dodge and George W.
Cuyler.
â  These gentlemen were appointed by" Governor
Hoffman to revise the Jaws for the assessment and
collection' of taxes, under authority of the Legisla
ture. Their report is a textbook on the subject of
assessment and taxation of property .for public rev
enue. If was printed by Harpers, and is very scarce,
as all the official copies were destroyed when the
State Library was burned at Albany. References to it
have caused, some readers to think it recommended
the Maguire plan of land confiscation. This is a
mistake. As published by Harpet the report is en
titled, "Wells, Local Taxation."
The report recommends that all railroads be taxed
by State authority, and that the sole assessment be
upon the franchise at a valuation equal to the aggre
gate market value of the stocks and funded and float
ing debt, less cash in hand, exempting such corpora
tions from all other taxation. The revenue so derived
to be taken for the general fund, as in Pennsylvania,
or be distributed to the towns and cities in whtch the
line runs. Mr. Wells says that to take it for a State
tax is fairer, since the franchise is given in the name
of all the people, " and every city through which the
line runs has had the valuation of its property and
the trade and convenience of its citizens increased
by reason of the road's construction."
Secondly â The commission recommended taxation
of land, exclusive of buildings, at a uniform valua
tion of 50 per centum of its true marketable or fair
value.
Thirdly â Tax the house or building as real estate
separately, at the same rate of valuation as the land,
50 per cent, and then, assuming that the value of the
house or building, irrespective of its contents, be such
contents furniture, machinery or any chattels what
soever, is the sign or index which the owner or oc
cupier puts out of his personal property, tax the
house or building on a valuation of 50 per cent ad
ditional to its real estate valuation, as' the represen
tation of such personal property, or, in .other words,
tax the land separately on 50 per cent of its fair mar
ketable valuation, and tax the building separately
from the land as representing the owners' personal
property, on a full valuation.
These propositions rest upon the fact that the mar
ket value of real estate is always proportionate to and
dependent on the amount of personal property, or
rather productive capital placed upon it, or in its
immediate vicinity. Land in itself has no orignal
value, as it cost no man anything to produce it. If
there is no personal property or productive capital
connected with it or reflected on it, it will not sell in
the market or only at a nominal value. If by chance
any buildings should be on such land, they will pos
sess no rental value. Only as personal property or
productive capital is brought in connection with land
does its value become appreciable and augment. The
report continues: "Applying the proposed system for
taxing personal property through buildings or rentals
as its representative, we should find that the aggre
gate of taxation would be lowest in the most sparsely
settled agricultural districts of the State. Property
here is mainly in land, whose low marketable valua
tion would be still further reduced on the tax li.=t if
a valuation of 50 per cent was taken as the stanc'ird
for assessment. The marketable value of t"he b ild
ings is low also; and. what should be especially borne
in mind is this circumstance, that here, and, in fact,
in all agricultural districts, the value of the buildings
Je much less than the value of the land with which
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, 1S T OYEMBEB 2, 1898.
they are connected. As we leave the sparsely settled
agricultural districts and rise through the more
densely populated portions of the State, from the
villages to the towns, from the towns to the cities
and from the cities to the great metropolis of the
continent, we shall find that the value of land, of
buildings and the aggregate of taxation valuation will
increase, as the amount and accumulation of personal
property increases, until land and buildings attain
their greatest market and tax valuation in Wall
street," Broadway and Fifth avenue, where, the accu
mulation of personal property is greatest. It is also
to be observed that, starting at the bottom of aur
scale, with the value of land greatly in excess of the
value of the buildings connected with the land, this
difference, as we progress upward through the more
densely populated districts, gradually diminishes un
til the value of the building greatly exceeds the value
of the land ftn which it. is situated."
As an alternative the commission proposed to tax
buildings as part of the real estate, and then tax
three times the rental or rental value of the whole, as
an equivalent of -the personal property.
Taking the rate of taxation at 4 per cent, as it was
at the date of the report, in Brooklyn, Troy, Albany
and Rochester, on land worth $2000, with, a building
of the same value, the method of assessment, by
bringing personal property into taxation, would re
duce the rate to 2 per cent.
Under the old system at 4 per cent the $4000 prop
erty pays $160 tax. Under the commission plan the
real estate assessed at 50 per cent would pay $20 tax.
The building, at 50 per cent as real "estate and 50 per
cent in equivalent of the personal property, would be
assessed at $2000, and at 2 per cent would pay $40,
and the building and land together would pay $60, in
stead of $160.
By the alternative plan of assessing land and build
ing together at 50 per cent they would pay on $2000,
or $40 tax; the rental value being assumed at 10 per
cent, or $400, three times that would equal $1200, as
sessed as the equivalent of personal property, and
would pay a tax of $24,. the whole tax being $64,
or slightly in excess of the first plan.
It will be seen that under either of these plans the
taxes of the land-owner will' be much less; the total
assessed valuation of the State, through an unevad
able inclusion of personal property, would be so in
creased as to cut the rate of taxation in two.
The plans of that commission presented consoli
dated taxation' of realty, buildings and personalty, and
assessment of railway franchises, as a simple system,
economical in its operation. The amount of revenue
required for public purposes fixes the rate of taxa
tion.
Under the Maguire land confiscation system no at
tention is paid to the amount of money required for
public purposes. It proposes that the State take as
tax the entire rental value of land, thus rendering
land valueless and destroying "it as private property.
In the illustration cited, of property with a rental
value of $400 per annum, the Maguire plan takes the
whole of that for tax.
By the last report of the Board of Equalization
land in California was valued at $761,348,980. Putting
its rental value at 5 per cent, or one-half the New
York estimate, the State, by confiscating rents,
would take as an annual tax $38,057,449, whether it
needed the money for public purpose or not. But
George and Maguire have both said "the rate of tax
ation must be high enough to take the whole of that
rental * * * or the owners of the land will
pocket it."
Now, the total tax levy in California for State and
county purposes is $18,908,806, while the Maguire
plan will take annually $38,057,449, or $20,000,000
more than the State and counties require. When
Henry George was asked at St. Louis (see "National
Single Taxer" for December 15, 1897) what would be
done with this excess over the public needs, he an
swered:
"You might give every girl when she comes of
marriageable age something to marry on. You
might give every man when he reaches a certain age
a pension. If you still had any left you might give
everybody a trip to Europe."
THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE PLACE.
AMONG the members of the California delega
tion who have attained a distinguished rank and
prestige in the House of Representatives is
the Hon. John A. Barham of the First District, who
is now serving his second term and has been re
nominated in recognition of his services to his con
stituents and to the State and the nation.
While his career in the House has been short in
comparison with that of many members from the
Eastern States, his personal strength as a worker and
a debater has been such as to win for him the chair
manship of the Mileage Committee, and membership
on the Arid Lands Committee, the Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and on the sub
committee having charge of the bill providing for the
construction of the Nicaragua canal.
In the course of the Congressional labors by which
he achieved these honors he has accomplished much
for the State, and has been at all times active and
zealous in looking after its interests. Among the
measures of special benefit to California which he
urged in the House are bills making available $250,
000 appropriated by Congress for the improvement
of the Sacramento and the Feather Rivers, appro
priating $300,000 for Eureka harbor, bills for the im
provement of Napa River, Petaluma Creek and es
tablishing a life-saving station at Point Arena. He
also introduced and had favorably reported a bill to
creaie a department of mines and mining, under
charge of a secretary of Cabinet rank.
As Mr. Barham has become identified with the
Nicaragua canal bill in the House, his return to
Congress is a matter of prime importance to the
State. It is not too much to say that his defeat
would be taken by Congress as an evidence that Cali
fornians are not favorable to the construction of the
canal by the Government, as Mr. Barham's bill pro
vides. Certainly no new member of the House, no
matter how much inclined he might be to promote
the enterprise, could give it anything like the val
uable service which can be counted on from Mr.
Barham.
It is further to be noted that to Mr. Barham is due
the adoption of the amendment to the bill of Sen
ators Morgan and Wtiite for the settlement oi the
debts of the Central Pacific road, which provides
that unless the settlement shall be perfected within
one year from the passage of the bill the President
shall at once foreclose the mortgage. This amend
ment thoroughly protects the interests of the Govern
ment and materially improves the bill of the Demo
cratic Senators.
So excellent have been the services of Mr. Isar
ham, and so valuable to the whole State is his pres
ence in Congress, that his defeat would be a loss to
every interest which California has at Washington.
Fortunately, there is no danger of his defeat. He re
ceived his renomination from the Republican conven
tion unanimously, and all reports justify the predic
tion that his re-election will be given by an over
whelming majority,.
WHAT HAS HE DONE?
NUMBER ELEVEN.
Dear Sir: The plain citizen like you and me wishes to judge a man
by his actions. It is true, we may have our own thoughts about his pol
icy and his designs, but,, after all, we may be mistaken in our surmises and
suppositions. You and I wish to be judged by our own actions, not by
what other people say against us. Therefore, it is only just that we should
apply to Mr. Phelan the same rule by which we wish to be measured our
selves.
Mr. Phelan appeals to the plain titizen, to you and to me, on his
record. He says and his friends say that he has made a good Mayor, the
best the city has had. They tell in general terms and in glowing words
the benefits San Francisco has received from his administration. They urge-,
against his opponent that he is an untried man, and they urge in Mr. Phe
lan's favor tfiat his knowledge and experience -in the City Hall will save" us
"uncounted" dollars. .
The plain citizen listens to" all these fine phrases and then he asks him
self,
WHAT HAS MR. PHELAN DONE?
It is all very well to speak of his great achievements in glowing terms.
but you and I like to come down to particulars. In reply to all his friends'
encomiums we simply ask, What has he done? , .- j. â¢
The San Francisco Examiner supports -Mr. Phelan's candidacy. In,
last Sunday's issue, it had a long piece entitled, "What Mayor Phelan Has
Done for the City." In the course of seventeen .paragraphs Mayor Phe
lan's good deeds are set forth. ' No one can accuse the Examiner of spar
ing talent or money in honoring those whom it wishes to honor. There
fore, we may take this summary of his good deeds, as an official state
ment of Mr. Phelan's record, the record on which" he appeals to the plain
citizen, to you and to me. â¢ . â¢ â¢ ..
It would be too long, and distinguished authorities have complained
that these letters are entirely tQO long, to deal in one com munication with
the whole record. The plain citizen likes to take his knowledge in small .
doses, and we can deal with Mr. Phelan's. achievement most instructively in
bits. - . : â¢ .?â â â¢â  ';â â¢
The record opens with . â . >â¢ â¢". â¢ â â¢
GOOD DEED NO. i. :. /
"He has administered his office as a public trust and has succeeded
when other Mayors failed." â¢". â¢ .. ..â¢"â â  .".â¢'
The plain citizen like you and I is disappointed at the general char
acter of this statement. No particulars are given as to what constitutes a.
public trust and how it should be administered. Mr. Phelan went into of
fice once and is striving to get into office a second time on the cry of busi
ness administration. He says that the public business should be transacted
as carefully as private business. He promised to take care of the interests
of the city as conscientiously as he takes care of the interests ot the rhelan
estate. These promises are certainly very consoling to the plain citizen, to
you and to" me. If "the public servants will attend to public matters as
thoroughly as they attend to their domestic concerns we shall have an ideal
administration. This we may therefore suppose is the meaning of the
statement that Mr. Phelan administered his office as a public trust.
But the plain citizen knows well that public, affairs are not adminis
tered in the same manner as private affairs. It is not according to human
nature that a man should attend to other people's interests as closely as he
attends to his own. Hence we are not so very 'hard on our officials when
we find a certain slackness and negli-gence.- As long as we cannot prove
downright incompetence or dishonesty we are willing enough to pay for thjs
slackness and to put' down this negligence to the credit of profit and loss.
But Mr. Phelan does not wish to be judged by such slipshod methods.
He is the exponent of business methods. He demands that the city busi
ness be conducted as the business of a -private firm. Therefore, we can
not judge of the administration of his office on the ordinary terms we ap
ply to the ordinary politician. He has made his own terma and he de
mands that we try him by them.
The plain citizen knows that it is absolutely necessary. to count cash on
hand at frequent intervals if accounts are to be kept straight. The city has
cash on hand and that cash has to be counted from time to time. The law
lays down the persons who are to conduct that count, how often it is te be
made and prescribes the various essential circumstances.
Among those whose duty it is to count the cash is the Mayor. Mr,
Phelan, when he was confronted with this duty, was by his own terms
bound to perform it as carefully as he performs the same operatiQn for his
own cash on hand. Mr. Phelan's success as a business man is testimony
to the care with which he watches every cent and dime of, his family fortune.
It is not likely that any of his employes would have a chance, were they
so minded, to abstract any of his cash.
BUT IN COUNTING THE CITY MONEY
Mr. Phelan appears to have forgotten his principle of doing the' public busi
ness in the same careful manner that he performs his private basiness. He
continued a bad habit inaugurated by Mayor Sutro and excusable in an old
and failing man. He trusted 3 to his delicate appreciation of the force of
gravity and relieved himself of the laborious task of counting the cash by
"hefting" the sealed mint sacks.
The result, of course, was inevitable. The plain citizen knows that
temptation is close to Treasurers. It has double power when methods for
checking the Treasurer are lax. The city of San Francisco was robbed, and
though the larger portion of the money was recovered frorh the surety com :
pany, the city is still out some $16,000. â¢
Of course this is not a very large sum to a wealthy municipality, and it
is very easy to get careless in attending to public business. If Mr. Phelan
stood on the same ground as other men, the plain citizen like you and I
would not judge him too heavily. But Mr. Phelan is not content to stand
on the same ground.' The reason why he asks for office is that he stands
on quite other .ground. He will attend to public busiaess as carefully, as
he attends to his private business. The plain citizen, therefore, is compelled
to take him at his word and to judge him by his own standard. Tried by
that standard Mr. Phelan has not attended to his public Â©usiness as care
fully as to his private business. He has in such an elementary proceeding
as counting cash employed methods so slipsKod that the city money has been
stolen from under his very nose. Facts do not warrant us in saying that
Mr. Phelan has administered this portion of his office at -least'' as a public
trust. It is true that the second portion of the paragraph is justified: "He
has succeeded where other Mayors have often failed." All our other
Mayors, with one or two exceptions, have failed to allow their Treasurers
to run off with the city funds. Mr. Phelan has succeeded admirably.
This one example brings home to the plain citizen, to you and to me,
the value of Mr. Phelan's professions and the worth of this great and gob 4
deed as a reason why he should be re-elected. As far as you and I can see,
Mr. Phelan has administered his office not as a public trust, but as a lever tQ
his own advancement in politics. By means of it and of the prestige at
tached to it he .has obtained supreme control of the machinery of the Dem
ocratic party. He has nominated a ticket composed of men who owe their
nominations to him, who have promised him 80 per cent of the o patronage Â°
and who are pledged to do his bidding. He has a personal power that no
boss ever befoce attained in an American city, or dreamed of attaining. His
office has made him ruler of a great political party, and sole ruler. -He
has cast out all pretenders to his throne. If he wishes to buy them back
he can buy them in open market, so that every paper knows the negotia
tions, and even as he buys them he can afford to treat them with contempt.
Henry VII made one of the defeated claimants to his crown a scullion in
the royal kitchen. Mr. Phelan accelerates the progress of Rainey and Har
1 ney and Buckley toward the sacred asylum of the plug hat with a royal kick.
Of a truth, Mr. Phelan has administered his office as a public trust. The
trust crushes <fut all competitors or buys those it cannot crush. Mr. Phe
lan to-day is the Pemocratic trust, and no citizen dare be a Democrat in
this town without his leave. A PLAIN CITIZEN.
COM/WENDS
REV. P. C. YORKE.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1, 1898.
To the Editor of The Call: In a prom
inent article in the Bulletin of to-day
the statement is made that Father
Torke's remarks "are not sanctioned
by the church." Please let me state as
a Catholic layman that the Catholic
â¢church is not in politics. Father Yorke
two years ago made an earnest, de
termined and successful fight against
the A. P. A. faction in their attack on
Catholics. As the result of that fight
'Mr. Phelan was elected Mayor of our
city by the votes of all right-thinking
citizens. The fight that Father Torke
made then was for principleâ the fight
he makes now Is for principle. Mr.
Phelan, throwing aside principle "for
votes," placed men in nomination who
by their votes or their indorsement
rfhowed a leaning to those who claimed
Catholics were not entitled to all the
rights and privileges of American citi
zens. The same reason that caused
Father Yorke to enter the lists against
bigotry and intolerance then actuate
him to-day. Don't let the public be
misled. Father Yorke is well known
by the people of this city and by the
Catholics of the whole United States
as a good priest â and a good citizen.
They know that when he denounces
fraud and hypocrisy he is right and
that he can count upon their support.
Money, position, rewards, have no
temptation for him. The record of hav
ing done his duty is the only reward he
claims. This he has done in the past
and is doing now and will always con
tinue to do. Had Mayor Phelan cared
more for principle than votes he would
not now be driven to the corner he is
in. I, as an American citizen, Bee
nothing to condemn in the position
taken by Father Yorke, on the con
trary I heartily approve of his past and
present course; I feel confident that
the support which was given to him
u two years ago when he fought bigotry;
openly will not desert him now that
he fights the moral cowardice that
truckles politically to that same bigo
try. EUGENE P. MURPHY.

This department lias . not been able to
learn of any Governor of a State of the

WILLIAM THE CONQUERORâ A. S.,
Kerby, Or. William the Conqueror, call
ed the Duke of Normandy, was born in
Falalse, a town in France, department of
Calvados, 1027 or 1028. In 1047 he gained a
victory over Guido of Macon at Val de
Dunes, and in 1064 he defeated another ri
val, Guillaume, Count of Argues. He was
aided in both contests by the French.
When he became conqueror he had as
followers men of Flanders, Anjou, Tor
raine and Brittany.
THE SAND LOTâ M. L. N., Oakland,
Cal. To give a history of the sand lot
agitation, Denis Kearney and others con
nected with the agitation in 1877 would
take more space than this department can

ON A. RANCHâ O. X., Wheatiand, Qal.
If Brown tells Jones that he may go on
his (Brown's) ranch and that he can have
all that he can make on it until he
(Brown) gives him notice that he wishes
to return to his property, provided that
Jones, during the time, will make the
necessary repairs and pay the taxes,
Jones is bound by the terms of the con
tract, notwithstanding the fact that It
was not a, written one, for the verbal con
tract is a matter of proof. Jones under
such a contract would not, after twenty
or any number of years, have the right
to claim the ranch as his own by reason
of the fact that he had had undisturbed
possession of it. He Js a tenant at Will
and May be ousted at any time that
Brown may desire to re-*Â»nter in his jmjb

FLOW FROM A SPRINGâ A. E. S. de
W., Hopland, Cal. The question as asked
cannot be answered for want of sufficient
data. To compute the velocity of flow
in. pipes of any diameter, when the volumo
discharged per minute is given in cubic
feet and the area of the pipe in square
feet, divide the volume by the area and
the quotient divided by sixty will give
the velocity in feet per second. When
the volume is given in cubic feet and
the area in square inches, divide the vol
ume by the area, multiply the quotient
By 144 and divide the product by sixty.
When the volume is given in cubic inches
and the area in square inches, divide tho
volume by the area and again by twelve
and by-sixty.
To compute the flow or volume of diÂ«
charge â when area is given in square
feetâ multiply the area of flow by its
velocity in feet per second and the
product multiplied by sixty will give thej
volume of cubic feet per minute. Wheiji
the area is given in square inches multi
ply the area by its velocity and agaljn
by sixty and divide the product by 144.?
To compute the power of a fall *>f
waterâmultiply the volume of flowing
water fh cubic feet per minute by 62.5
and this product by the vertical height of
fall in feet. m J

Aplda from the wins of Forwerts and
Ban Mateo, the favorites over at Oakland
track traversed a very bumpy road yes
terday, and this pair were : backed only by
the smart ones. Stepabout; Bernardillp
and Horton each in turn stepped to the
plate and struck out. William G'B could
be numbered among the beaten choices
also, for he opened a pronounced favorite.
"Butch" Fisher and "Daggle" Smith
untied a spicy piece of horseflesh in For

long bout for maidens, about as she
pleased. Her backers accepted sto 1

had the mount and, away first, was never
headed, winning- somewhat easily, from
Stan Powers. Inverary II came down
from the clouds in a parachute, captur
ing the show. c "" .
It was said that Stepabout had been
reeling off some nice work in private
trials and on the strength of this inform
ation, was installed a 4 to 5 choice for the
6lx furlong selling sprint that followed. |

Turf Gossip.
J. "W. Brooks. handTcapper at Oakland
track, takes exception to an item pub
lished which states that the conditions
of the races, in which Shasta Water and
Bliss Rucker were starters on Monday
were framed for those two animals. He
defies any well posted turfmaji to show
him one clause in the conditions of the
racee that could be construed as favoring
either of them. Mr. Brooks furthermore
cays, though, that if he at any time
should make a race up for any particu-
lar horse, he will bet a round sum that
the horse wins. That being the case, It
look? as if Shasta Water and Bliss Rucker
â¢were in the enjoyment of nothing -more
than an even break.
The contract Dick Clawson hoLds with
Sydney Paget for next year, calls' for a
salary of $7500. This sum is only a.re
tainer, the jockey being paid for winning
and losing mounts, and outside mounts.
There will be no combination book at
Oakland. President Williams thinks the
price on many a horse is spoiled by the
r 'cheese and cracker" stand, and wisely
dispensed with it.
Charley Fair again touched the ring up,
getting several hundred down on Forwerta
at top price.

Saturday he found that his wife had left
and learned that she was in the company
of Fagan. Not being able to care for the
little ones, aged 9, 7 and 3 years, he had
them placed in the home and the officers
of the society put on the track of the

THE SAN FBAISTCISQO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1893.
j&. PLEC3-A.TTj^. OFF OAPB HEQR.IT.
Nine vessels were In company off the cape of storm from September 1 to September 3, and. according to Cap
tain Shapland of the Peleus It was "Just like a regatta." They all got around in a bunch and then there was a
lively time making sail and getting away on the run up the South American coast. The French bark Persever
ance ran away from the other eight vessels, but the Peleus made the best run to San Francisco.
FIRST REGATTA
EVER HELD OFF
CAPE HORN
Nine Vessels Were in
the Race.
A STRANGE COINCIDENCE
\
CAPTAIN AND SON DIE ON SUC
CEEDING VOYAGES.
Two Melancholy Trips to Montevideo.
The Mariposa Delayed by the
' Non-Arrival of tha
English Mails.
Captalr* Shapland of the British ship
Peleus. which arrived from Newcastle,
England, yesterday, describes an event,
the like of which has probably never been
seen before. He calls it "a regatta oft
Cape Horn," and such an event was sure
ly never recorded before as having oc
curred off the cape of storms. Nine deep
water vessels were engaged In it, and the
American ship EdwaVd O'Brien worthily
upheld the honor of Old Glory by arriving
in port a few hours after the Peleus.
On September 1 all the vessels were off
Staten Island. Among them Captain
Shapland enumerates the British ship
Algburth. from Philadelphia for Hono
lulu; British ship Machrihanish, from Rio
de Janeiro for Taltai; British bark
Norma, from Antwerp for San Francisco;
British bark Merioneth: and Captain Ban
field of the Edward O'Brien gives the
British ship Falls of Clyde from Lon
don for San Francisco and a large four
masted French bark bound for the west
coast nitrate ports.
â¢ "It was a wonderfully pretty sight,"
said Captain Shapland yesterday. "We
wore all off Staten Island together on the
night of September 1. It was clear, but
as cold as Greenland. Plenty of ice was
in sight, but as it was blowing a strong,
fair breeze we did not pay any attention
to it. Every one of the fleet had colors
set, but we could not spare the time to
make them all out.
"We all rounded the Horn on the night
of September 3, and in the morning we
had our regatta. All the nine vessels
packed on sail and trimmed ship, and v.c
went at it hammer and tongs. The
Frenchman- was light, however, and ran
right away from us. The rest of us kept
in company during the day, but during
the night "we got widely apart and he
next day the Peleus was alone on ..ie
ocean. This was the most expeditious
passage I have. ever made around the
Horn to. the westward."
The Peleus had variable weather to Oc
tober 31, when she got a strong northwest
breeze which carried her to the bar.
Then it died away and she had to anchor.
Yesterday morning she was picked \ip by
the tug Pea Queen and towed into port.
A few hours later the Edward O'Brien
w"as towed in, so the Algburth, Norma
and Merioneth have still to be h<^ard
from. The latter vessel holds the record
between Swansea and San Francisco and
should be along any day now.
Captain Banfleld of the Edward
OvÃrienO v Ãrien reports the French bark as the
Perseverance, from South Shields. Eng
land, for Iquique. During the last two
days of the passage the O Brien lost and
split nearly a whole suit of sails in a
â¢lorthwester.
The steamer Acapulco arrived from
Panama and way ports yesterday with a
large cargo and a few passengers. The
day before she left the isthmus Don
Ricardo Araugo, Governor of the depart
ment of Panama, died, and was succeeded
by Dr. Facundo Mutis Duran, president
of the Supreme Court. Don Araugo wasa
Cuban by birth, was educated in th*
TTnited States, was a naturalized citizen
of Colombia and fought in the war of in
dependence. He was a powerful factor
In the politics of his country and will be
very mr.ch missed.
The American ship^R. R. Thomas, from
Hongkong ior Boston, put into Monte
video yesterday with the captain dead.
Two years ago precisely the same thing
happened. Captain Blanchard was in
command then, and the. vessel was on her
way home from Hongkong. The captain
died and the son. who was chief ottWr,
took the vessel into Montevideo for orders.
He took the Thomas to Boston and was
made master. Now he. like his father,
has died while homeward bound, and the
ship is again in Montevideo for orders.
Captain W. K. McMurtry is back in
town for the winter. He was master of
Â»the Alaska Exploration Company's
steamer Linda on the Yukon, and made
two trips during the season. A splendid
performance, when the short time he had
to make them is considered.
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
decided to charge the Oceanic Steamship
Company $250 a month for the use of Pa
cific-street wharf.
The Oceanic Steamship Company s mail
steamer Mariposa will not get away for
Australia, via Hawaii, Samoa and New
Zealand to-day. The English mails are
delayed, so the steamer will not sail until
to-morrow at 2 p. m.

Took Advantage of Her Condition.
Catherine Raffa has sued Patrick F.
Benson and Martin Tahaney to recover
possession of an Interest In the estate of
John Burke, valued at $800, which, It is
alleged, was procured by the defendants
through fraud and conspiracy. The plain
tiff alleges that In March of 1894 she was
adjudged Insane and committed to Ag
news asylum. In October of 1897 the de
fendants Informed her that they could
secure her release, but It would require
considerable money. In consequence, she
assigned them her interest In the estate
of John Burke, which they disposed of,
placing in her hands the sum of $390. The
plaintiff, having recovered, was released
from the asylum, and now contends that
the defendants are not entitled to the
money they withheld. She states that
their labors In her behalf were only worth
$50. and she asks that all the moneys re
ceived from or through her, with the ex
ception of $50, be returned to her.

THE INDIAN PLAY.
Success of the Piece Written for
Lewis Morrison.
The comedy-drama "The Indian," no-w
on the boards at Morosco's Grand Opera
House, is a play that pleases and fascin
ates a large number of theater-goers. It
is a play of contrasts, the well-appor^
tioned drawing rooms of civilization, sup
posed to be in Washington, giving place
to the rough stockades and Indian camps
in the lava beds of the far West. Pa
thetic scenes are followed by situations
that provoke laughter. The play was
written for Lewis Morrison, but it has re>
quired James M. Brophy's tact and
ability to bring out the strong points of
the leading part or parts.
Rex Sterling, lieutenant of the Seventh
Cavalry, U. S. A., and Red Feather, the
chief of the Ogalalas, are brothers whom
the author has separated in early life
only to bring together again as enemies.
This dual part is taken by Brophy. who
is obliged to make several rapid shifts of
costume to represent the two opposite
personalities. It is a trying and difficult
part, but successfully filled.
Landers Stevens as Allen Leech and
Fred J. Butler a3 War Eagle are well re
ceived in their respective characters.
The character of Gladys Sterling is care
fully handled by Lorena Atwood. The
scenery, costumes and stage settings are
artistic and appropriate.
EXPERT EXAMINES
BLOCK'S BOOKS
FINDS THE CALL'S CHARGES
SUBSTANTIATED.
Judiciary Committee Will Hear His
Report at a Special Meeting
This Week.
The Judiciary committee of the Board
of Supervisors met yesterday to consider
The Call's charges recently made against
Tax-Collector Block. It was found that
considerable data were needed in official
form and Expert J. C. Solomon was ac
cordingly employed to gather the neces
sary facts for presentation at another
meeting of the committee to be called
later in the week. Mr. Solomon at once
began his investigations of the military
rolls in Collector Block's office and with
in half an hour had secured sufficient
data to completely prove The Call's
charges.
lie found that nearly an even hundred
of Chinamen were upon the rolls as liable
for military service in the army of the
I'nited States. There were also several
hundred dead men who were enrolled as
liable to serve Uncle Sam in case of war.
Blind men, lame men, the aged, the city
officials and scores of others who are
pxempt were found Inscribed upon the
books as subject for military service and
for each name Mr. Block collected five
cents from the City ana County Treas
ury. So far the expert has found some
where near 8000 names improperly record
ed ln the roster and there is no telling
how many more will be unearthed.
It Is thought that the judiciary commit
tee will meet next Friday morning. Mr.
Block will then be cited to appear and ex
plain. .

Sharkey Will Not Fight to Rule
When Corbett Jabs Him on
the Nose.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
hold an entertainment this evening- at 319
Sixth street. William Condon is matched
to box Charles Pritchard six rounds and
A. H. Vahan will meet Jim Webster in
an eight-round contest for the heavy
weight championship of the club. Apart
from these bouts there will also be sev
eral four-round Â» ontests between athletes
who ars toleraÃly proficient in boxing.
The proposed twenty-round contest be
tween Lavigne and Tracey has been post
poned from November 22 to November 25.
The reason given by the managers of the
National Club for postponing the contest
is that in view of the fact of the Corbett
and Sharkey fight, which will take place
on the 22d inst., local Interest in the
Tracey and Lavigne light might be af
fected.
Sever-al of the leading sporting men of
this city expect to hear nt the Sharkey
and Cerbett fight being stopped by the
police. They contend that feharkey can
not fight fairly when he is punched on
the nose, and that as soon as Corbett
will commence to jab the sailor then
Queensberry rules will be cast aside and
go-as-you-please rules will govern until
such time as the authorities will call a
halt. Sharkey can stand a punching- on
the head and body, but when his nose is
touched then is the time that his oppo
nent will have to look out for squalls and
hip-locks.
The Jeffries and Kennedy heavy-weight
contest will be decided before the Excel
sior Club some time in the latter part of
this month or in the early part of Dc
cciiibtr.

SHE LAUGHED AT
FATHER TIME.
Death of Mrs. Eliza Cooiey, the Aged Coquette
'. of the City and County Almshouse,
Saturday.
Mrs Eliza Cooiey, the oldest inmate of the Almshouso, passed away
â at that' institution on Saturday last at the age of 101 years, The death of
the old lady revealed a peculiar trait of vanity. Though she had passed
the century mark the aped efquette confessed to but 90 years, and when
Mrs. Wilson, a sister of the deceased, gayÂ« her yean "away" there was
much possiping among the old ladies who are the guests of the city. The
fact that Mrs. Cooiey was 101 years old has dimmed just a little of
"Grandma" Dodd's glory. "Grandma" confesses to 94 summers, and Is
rather amused at Mrs. Cooley's coquettish drop uf eleven years.
"She thought she was young." said Grandma. "She felt young and
prohably thought she looked young. But I knew phe was older than she
said she was. Yes, indeed. She couldn't fool me," and the knowing
"Grandma" clucked a pleased little chuckle, smacked her toothless gums
and begged pretty, kind Mrs. Reddy for "a pass to go to town."
Mk: Cooiey at the time of her death had been an inmate of the Alms
house for about ten months. In appearance she was comely, and a pair
of bright black eyes glanced shrewdly out of the wrinkled, strong old face.
Old age was, given as the cause of her death.

â¢ 'â 'â¢â ' Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
"fijW: . . â â  90S Broadway, Nov. 1.
As the election approaches it is evident [
the" Republican candidates have less op- j
position to meet than existed at the com
mencement of the campaign. Little by
little but very decidedly, the many par
ties"'are falling apart and politics are re
suming their normal condition. Some of
the county candidates are daily becoming
stronger, and if ever a doubt existed re
garding- their party . support it certainly
exists no longer. " Â° Â°â â 
One of the candidates who is rapidly
adding to the majority he will receive is
Recorder Spear. His gataois the direct
result of the 111-advised opposition â¢ of
some of his opponents.
A K. Grim made a most unfortunate
move for himself when he went to San
Francisco to discuss his candidacy with
Colonel Dan Burns. He made a greater |
mistake when he c publicly told of his ap- |
plication to a o San Francisco politician,
for help in this county. Mr. Grim says
he went to Colonel Burns because he was
told the, colonel could 9o something for
him This confession has seriously in
jured Grim's candidacy. He has o the sup
port of a majority, of the street car men
on account, of Â° the manner in which he
treated them while superintendent of one
of the systems. . Apparently he ha* no !
other support, and Â«it. will surprise, the |
knowing ones if he succeeds in polling
4500 votes. "During the past few -days the
Grim fight has been far less in evidence
than it was a month ago. â
Recorder 'Spear will divide the remain
ing 16 000 votes with the Democratic can
didate', and he will probably receive be
tween 9000 and 10,000 of them. "Billy
Schmidt, the Berkeley contractor who Is
having quite a little fun with himself, and
presumably afhis own expense, making
an alleged campaign for the Assembly,
has, unfortunately for his ambition, at
tempted to say unpleasarlt things about
Mr Spear. ; Mr. Schmidt's campaign
Btory, however, has proved the truest kind
of a boomerang.' It has .sent skeptcal
people to the records where they naive
discovered that Mr. Schmidt's story, like
all other stories, has two sides, and the
brightest" side reflects toward Mr. Spear.
Schmidt exhibits a note drawn In his
favor by Spear, and goes about proclaim
ing that the County Recorder does not
meet his obligations,, The facts as es
tablished by the records in Judge Cliffs
office are these: Spear did owe Schmidt
1100 Spear also held an account against
Schmidt for $100. As Schmidt would not
agree that one debt should cancel the
other Spear brought matters to a head
by suing Schmidt for the bill. Schmidt's
defense ,was the note he held against
Spear and Judge Clift ordered that one
debt cancel the other, and gave judgment
to this effect, which is on record. Con
sequently the Schmidt story is simply that
of a plain petty business transaction hon
orably and legally settled. â

CRANK ASKS JUSTICE
OF JUDGE WALLACE
HE LIVENED UP THE BECKER
CREEGAN CASE.
When Arrested and Taken to the In
sane Ward He Sues Out a Writ
of Habeas Corpus on
His Cuff.
Matters livened t}pÂ° considerably yester
day in the trial of Becker and Creegan,
charged with having swindled the Neva
da Bank. A crank put in his appearance
just as court was adjourning at the noon
hour, and, advancing 'as close to. the
bench as possible, threw his arm over his
head and said: "Most wise and honored
Judge, I want justice; I come to seek
justice, I demand justice." Judge Wal
lace left the bench and started for "his
chambers, Â when" the o crank advanced
closer and repeated: "I want justice,
most wise Judge."
"\Vhat does he say," said Judge "Wal
lace. â  :â¢ â  Â° â¢ â¢
! "I want Justice," wailed the insane
man. But before he could say more Bail
iff Whelan grappled with him . and led
him from the court to the insane ward.
.-After howling and shouting for Justice
for several minutes the prisoner, who re
fused to give his name, asked for paper
and pen and wrote the following note:
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1. 1898.
Any Judge who is able to do me Justice will
please be so kind as to do me Justice by leaving
me out for to-night, - and J. will . appear at 9
o'clock litany court. I am my own bondsman.
- Â° s N. B. â¢
He then busied" himself drawing up a
writ of habeas corpus, in his own behalf,
on his cuff, all the time mumbling for
jus|ice. : That he is insane there is no
question, but who he is is the puzzle. On
his watch there is engraved the name B.
Bierbaum, but whether or not that Is
his name he f refuses to say. He will be
examined by the Insanity Commissioners
to-day. â¢ ' . - â¢ ',
McClosky, an alleged confederate of the
defendant, was on the stand yesterday and

prosecution will close Its case to-day or

BETRAYED THE
TRUST OF THE
WORKMEN
What Maguire Did
With the Eight-
Hour Bill.
SOMETHING ELSE WAS UP
HE HELD IT OTJT FOR FEAB, IT
WOULD HTTRT OTHERS.
Another Bill for Eastern Men. Was
on Hand and Congressman.
Maguire Gave it First
: â ' Chance. â  . ,
On more than one occasion Judge Ma
guire has rent the air with protestations
of esteem for the workingman and prom
ises of support whenever possibl-e, but his
actions speak even louder than his words
and the thoughtful union member learns
more from Maguire's record In regard to
Congressoinal measures to help labor
than from any high-sounding address
from platform or paper.
There was a time when, had he been
so disposed, Maguire might have had a
measure of inestimable value to the labor-
Ing classes brought up before Congress
and passed, but he didn't. It was a hill
to effectually limit the hours of a day's
work upon public contracts, and it fol
lowed the decision of the Kelso case,
which practically nullified the then exist
ing law. Maguire expressed the greatest
regret for this and severely criticized the
construction of the law. His own organ,
the Examiner, of September IS, ,1897, quot
ed him in this way:
I find no fault with Judge Heaeock. He con
scientiously followed, I think, a little tuo
closely a well-settled and very lust rule which
requires that criminal statutes be strictly con
etrued. I regret that he did not see his way
clear to send the matter before the court In
order that we might have had a more authori
tative judicial decision to present to Congress
next winter In asking for an amendment to the
act but of course he would have had no right
to hold the. defendant for that purpose merely.
The penal provision of the act is so wretch
edly drawn that I cannot possibly understand
how its crudeness escaped the attention of the
lawyers In Congress at the time of its passage,
unless Indeed, the act was passed as a piece
of Jugglery to satisfy the demands ->f organ
ized labor for the time being, while Incorpora
ting ambiguities and limitations which would
be likely to enable Its violators to escape pun
ishment. Howevrr, Its sufflclfncy to hold and

! spired with the corporation to commit the of
fense regains to .be tested. , .
That the new Postoffice should be built under
the conditions imposed by Mr. Kelso upon
his workmen is a disgrace to those who have
control of the work.
The Kelso case was one of the first
brought in the local courts under the
eight-hour law-. The Kelso company had
the contract for excavating the new Post
office, site and it was compelling It 3 men
to work nine hours a day. John Kelso,
the president of the company, was in
dicted for violating the law and the case
came befor Commissioner Heacock. It re
sulted in the dismissal of Kelso on the
ground that the company and not he was
the contractor, and so he could not be
tried.
The law was so drawn that it admitted
of only this construction, and it was this
that Judge Maguire so deeply deplored. To
prevent a repetition of the Kelso fiasco
Assistant United States Attorney Knight
compiled an amendment to the law by
which not only contracting corporations
but those who directed them would be
liable to punishment, and this amendment
was sent on to Washington to Judge Ma
guire. He promised to look out for the
bill and that was the last the working
men of California heard of it.
Maguire's Inactivity finally caused com<
plaint and letters were sent to him de
manding an explanation of his course.
June 15, lÂ»ys, he answered one of his in
quirers as follows:
Dear Sirâ Your letter of May 13, Inclosing a
copy of your letter to Samuel Qomiers and
others came duly to hand. The unfortunate
situation here with respect to the eight-hour
law has been that It could secure consideration
In Congress only as a compromise measure. As
such the legislative committee of the American
Federation of Labor made an' agreement with
Mr. Gardener, chairman of the committee on
Labor, and the other leading represeniatlves of
the Republican party now dominant In the
â¢ House of Representatives, which Involved the
passage of the act, which was passed by the
House of Representatives without amendment.
Upon no other terms could the bill have re
ceived consideration In the House. Contest over
an amendment would have enabled members
of the House who were willing to carry out the
agreement reached, but who are not at all
friendly to the eight-hour law or any similar
legislation, to defeat the entire bill by consum
ing the time allowed to the committee for its
consideration. The bill had to be brought up
In what Is known as the committee's hour, the
committees being called In turn from time to
time and presenting for the consideration of the
House such bills as are practically uncontested
to be passed within the hour or returned to
the calendar, where they are never llkelv to be
reached. Under those circumsance^. at the
earnest solicitation of the committee on the
eight-hour law of the American. Federation of
Labor, I refrained from either presenting my
own bill or urging amendments to the bill
which they had agreed upon and which secured
passage through the HouÃe Bolely on that
agreement. To have pressed my own bill or to
have pressed an amendment to the compromise
bill upon the floor of the House would have de
feated the eight-hour bill for the present ses
sion. Had I taken such action as would have
involved that result the committee on the
plpht-huur law and the entire American Fed
eration of Labor would of course have held me
responsible for the failure of their measure,
and while thoy fully realized that the measure
In defective they feel, and have felt, that It
was all that they Could possibly obtain at the
â present session of Congress, and that an at
tempt to eecure more would have resulted in
utter failure. They have pimply been obliged
to bow' to conditions which they could n>t con
trol, and to accept such improvements in the
eight-hour law as th? solid phalanx of a hos
tile majority would yield to them.
With kindest regards. I remain, very truly
yours. t\MES G. MAGUIRE.
Replying to another eager correspond
ent Maguire wrote on June 22. 1898:
Dear Sir: Your letter relating to the eight
hour bill reached me lome time ago. It con
tained the first intimation I had that there
was any disagreement between the Huilding
Tradea Council of San Francisco and the Na
tional Federation of Labor on the question. I
Immediately looked Into the matter and had
President Gompers of the National Federation
write to the Building Trades Council stating
the facts of the matter. The fact Is that the
National Federation of Labor made an agree
ment with the Committee on Labor of the
House of Representatives and with other ne
publican leaders In the House by the terrn^ ( o
which the bill passed the House of Representa
tives, wae accepted by the American Fenera
tlon and was to be passed through both nouses
of Congress. I had an amendment to tne ex
isting eight-hour law, which was drafted
and agreed upon before I left San Francisco,
but I was earnestly requested not to P res8 * n ,r
bill nor to attempt to amend the federation
bill in any particular, because euch an at
tempted amendment would prevent the passage
of the bill in the House and defeat all legis
lation on the subject On that request so eiy
I withheld action. I supposed at that time
that the Building Trades Council of San Fran
cisco was acting in harmony with the federa
tion on the subject. Truly yours,
JAMES G. MAQUIRH.
To assist a measure antagonistic
to them, Mr. Maguire killed a bill that
would have been' one more step toward
industrial freedom for the workmen of
California. The fact that he represented
Callfornian workmen, not those of the
East, did not occur to Mr. Maguire, and
so he shelved their bill, because to in
troduce it was to jeopardize something
in his eyes more important than the
length of a day's work in California. And
the other bill for which Mr. Maguire was
willing to sacrifice so much failed to pass
either house. Mr. Maguire had cleverly
evaded both the East and the "West and
had still not antagonized any corpora
tion. His explanation was glib and ready
and tinged with the same sorrow that
welled so copiously from his breast just
after the Kelso case, but still the work
men of California are working under the
same law as that which faced Kelso, and
the possibility of extra hours and no re
dress is a stronger argument than any
Mr. Maguire can make to the contrary.
WTFE-BEATEES PUNISHED.
John F. Healey and Joseph .Antone
Get Six Months Each.
Two wife beaters were punished to the
limit of the law yesterday. The first was
John F. Healey, 121 Fourth street. His
wife, who is several years his senior,
owns some property and he was in the
habit of demanding money from her to
satisfy his appetite for drink. When she
refused he beat her. A week ago he
blackened her eyes and broke her arm,
and she had to be taken to the Receiving
Hospital. Judge Low gave him six
months.
The other was Joseph .Antone, 237 Ship
ley street, who has for years taken a say
age delight in beating his wife and chil
dren. Last Sunday he was unusually se
vere in his castigations and a warrant
was Bworn out for his arrest. Judge
Mogan gave him six months and ex
pressed his regret that he could not make
It six years.
Suit on Water Bonds.
Albert Walte filed a suit in the Circuit
Cofrt yesterday against th"c city of Santa
Cruz and others to recover $66,450, alleged
to be due on water bonds issued by the
city of Santa Cruz. Waite has recovered
judgment in the Circuit Court for a large
sum due on similar Santa Cruz bonds,
and the present suit is brought on bonds
which matured since the filing of the first
suit.
Tapped a Telephone Box.
O. E. Prowse. a boy 17 years of age. was
arrested yesterday afternoon by Police
man Cooney on a charge of burglary. He
went Into the saloon of Bon Brothers, 101
Sixth street, and forced open the tele
phone receiver with a pair of tweezers
that were found in his pocket. Unfor
tunately for him a buzzer was attached to
the box, and as soon as it was opened the
buzzer gave the alarm to those in the
bar.

gift, for which he was sure the German
Catholics would be deeply .grateful.
â  . .The Emperor, at the close of the cere

prayer that "God grant that confidence

â¢ CONSTANTINOPLE, ; Nov. I.â lt ap
.pears that Emperor William made a
mistake jit the reception which preced
ed the gala. banquet given in his honor
by the Sultan at the palace last Fri
day.. -Evidently mistaking Mrs: Oscar
Strauss, wife of the United States Min

diplomatist,, the Emperor said he knew
her Queen very well.

Emperor William was evidently very

Two Skaguay Railroad
Men Killed.
PENALTY OF CARELESSNESS
EXPLOSIVES HEATED ON AN
IRON WHEELBARROW.
Great Hole in the Earth Marks the
Spot Where the Workmen
Conducted This Opera
tion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. I.â News comes from
Skaguay by the steamship Farallon
that two employes on the Skaguay and
White Pass Railroad were killed in a
peculiar manner ten days ago. They
were working beyond the summit,
where heavy rock work is being done,
necessitating constant thawing of
giant powder and dynamite. . This was
found to be a slow process, the usual
method being to dig a hole in the
ground and build a fire in it. The
dynamite was placed in the ground
some distance from the fire, and as
the ground got warm the frost was
drawn out.
Several employes finally hit upon the
scheme of placing their dynamite in an
iron wheelbarrow and building a fire
under it. This proved much quicker
than the old way and was repeated sev
eral times. The experimenters gradu
ally grew careless, making the fire hot
ter each time.
One day the iron become redhot and
there was a great explosion, which left a
big hole where the fire, wheelbarrow
and dynamite had been. The men who
had charge of the thawing operations
were instantly killed, their bodies be
ing torn Into shreds. Work was
stopped on that section and the frag
ments of the dead men were gathered
up and buried. The names of the un
fortunates are unknown, but one is
said to have been an Italian.
The foreman of the railroad has been
strongly criticised at Skaguay for al
lowing dynamite to be thawed by such
a dangerous' method.
To date 250 tons of powder and dyna
mite has been used by the Skaguay
Railroad.
CONFIRM THE REPORT
OF THE JOHNSON'S LOSS
SEATTLE, Nov. 1. â Navigation on
the Upper Yukon, between Dawson and
the lakes, has closed for the season,
and all the river steamers have gone
Into winter quarters. Thirty Klon
dikers who left Dawson on October 10
on the steamer Flora arrived to-day.
They report that the Flora was the
last boat to leave Dawson. The Yukon
was filled with running Ice, and It
would bÂ© impossible to make another
trip.
Frank Sullivan of Mexico, Mo., re
ports a rich placer on Thistle Creek,
about twenty miles above Stewart
River. A number of claims had been
staked out. One man Is reported to
have taken out sixty-nine ounces of
gold In four days. It is about twenty
five feet to bedrock. There will be
quite an exodus from Dawson as soon
as the river is sufficiently frozen.
The schooner General Siglin arrived
here to-day from Cooks Inlet, Alaska,
with about forty miners. They confirm
the report of the wreck of the sloop
Johnson and the drowning of nine men.
Although searchers have watched the
beaches of Turnagaln Arm no bodies
have been recovered.
Among the passengers was the Elm
City Mining Company expedition, com
posed of six men, headed by P. C.
Rhodes. E. W. Smith, Walter Miller
and M. E. Skinner and wife, of Albany,
who unsuccessfully tried to dredge
gold on the Beluga River, also re
turned.
TALES OF NEW STRIKES
IN THE YUKON REGION
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
RUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. 24.â Still the
at Interior of Alaska is pouring its
vvds over mountain summits and
ra to the coast, but few people from
Dawson are among the last throngs.
Most are from the lakes and tributa
ries this side of Fort Selkirk, where
some prospecting has been done with
indifferent success. As usual, the story
is that many colors and some good
prospects were found, but the amount
of development work possible after the
locations were made produced a quan
tity of gold of lees "heft" than has been
consonant with the ambitious Eastern
idea that has come up here .embodied
in so many men. This idea has now
changed so completely that it would
not be recognized in any kind of
clothes. While among "the faithful"
and. sensible the question of making a
fortune by finding it in Alaska is as
luxuriant and well rooted as Dewey in
Manila, it has weakened sqmewhat in
regard to finding it in two or three
months, where a spade is thrust down
or the rock fractured. The crowd of
steamboat men has nearly left the
river. They are in numerous evi
dence in Juneau and Skaguay. Their
boats are "cached" on the Lewis River
somewhere between Bennett and the
mouth of the Pelly for the winter, and
all expect a big business next season
to Dawson and Lake Atlln.
A sensational new strike is reported
near Lake Atlin. but nobody has yet
been found who knows any of the par
ticulars of what, where, when and how
much. One story is that another lake,
almost as large as Atlin, has been
found beyond the swamps at the lower
end of the Atlin, the two being con
nected by a steady current through the
ewamp. The report says that encourag
ing pan prospects were found by a small
party which got Into the section by
losing its way. If this Is true, it
opens up a new country which there Is
an yet no reason to believe Is not as
promising as Atlin is at the present
time. There is plenty of room in the
country indicated for a flock of lakes
as big as Atlin, and the extreme south
ern end' of the section brings it very
close to the coast between Juneau and
Skaguay, Just over the coast range, but
still in British Columbia. This situ
ations opens up a possibility of new
mountain passes to the headwaters of
the Yukon, one close to Skaguay and
two Just north of and close to Juneau,
Indians are known to go in and out
over these mountains. As a matter of
fact, all the passes to the interior are
of original Indian discovery, subse
quently utilized and advertised by
white men. No explorations have ever
been made that amounted to much
practical result for mountain passes to
the interior.
SANTA CLARA IS
STRONG FOR GAGE
Republicans Solid as to
State Ticket.
FALSE STATEMENTS PRINTED
THE EXAMINER ATTEMPTS TO
CREATE DISCORD.
Seeks by Prevarication to Stampede
Voters to the Fusion Can
didate for Gov
ernor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. I.â For the past sev
eral days the Examiner has endeavored
to stir up strife in the ranks of the Re
publicans of Santa Clara County in re
gard to the State ticket and stampede
to Maguire. It asserts that the
Good Government League will oppose
the legislative nominees and the State
ticket of the Republican party and also
refuse to vote for Congressman Loud
because of his animosity toward Rea,
This is false and thÂ«" vituperations of
the Examiner are solely for the pur
pose of causing dissension in the Repub
lican ranks. The Good Government
League members are strong In de
nouncing the statement as untrue. The
league's 2500 votes will go solidly for
Gage and Loud and these two will re
ceive the largest vote ever cast in Santa
Clara County for Governor and Con
gressman.
In speaking of the attitude of the
Examiner, E. A. Hayes, president of
the Good Government League, to-day
said:
"The Examiner is mistaken and the
articles in which we are mentioned as
opposing State and Congressional
tickets are false. So far as I know â
and my position is such I think I would
know, if there were any great disaf
fection â the members of the Good Gov
ernment League are going to vote to a
man for the State and Congressional
tickets. I have not heard of one of our
members who would make exception to
a single candidate. We are all loyal
Republicans and are working for the
success of Gage and Loud. As to the
county candidates in this election, our
motto is: 'Good men for county officials
regardless of party affiliations, who will
serve the people and not the bosses.' "
Mitchell Phillips, chairman of the
campaign committee of the Good Gov
ernment League, is confident of the
success of the State ticket. He said:
"When substantial men conduct a
campaign so thoroughly at their
own expense. and have the
largest meetings of any party
in the field, furnish, their own speak
ers, and their members come in Satur
day after Saturday to the number of
several hundred, it certainly must im
press those people who are lndfferent
to politics that something is wrong.
Before the Good Government League
indorsed its non-partisan ticket it was
given such a thorough scrutiny that It
certainly must be an exceptionally
strong ticket to have stood the test.
There are no offlceseekers in the league
â the pledge and membership forbid it.
The following list of men will show the
high character of those who comprise
the membership of the organization,
and unless the movement had the wel
fare of the county at heart it would be
impossible to identify them with us:
"W. 11. Wright, Dr. W. D. McDougall,

"Owing to the shameless frauds and
outrageous tactics employed by the
ring at the last Republican primary, at
tention was attracted to the league,
and we received a large accession of
members, who heretofore did not inter
est themselves in politics except to vote
for the ticket that was the product of
the gang. The dictum of Renublican
State Convention that no partisan is
bound by the decision of a dishonest
primary will be the means of taking
from the gang many of Its voteÃ cast
at San Jose's disreputable primaries.
Reports from all over the county indi
cate the success of the Republican State

POSTAL WAGONS
FOR THE COUNTRY
Novel Scheme Adopted
at Washington.
GREAT BOON TO THE FARMER
TEST TO BE MADE IN SANTA
CLARA COUNTY.
Will Distribute and Collect Mail, Is
sue and Cash Money Orders
and Register the Letters
of the Rustics.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, No. L
The Postofflce Department Is about
to inaugurate a most novel scheme in
the way of rural delivery and collection
of maiL A "postal wagon" has been
invented and adopted by the depart
ment. It is designed to travel in rural
districts, starting from a central point,
passing through various villages en
route and stopping at fan.ihouses. The
mail will not only be delivered and col
lected, but this wagon will issue money
orders and cash them as well as regis
ter the letters of rustics. It is a sort
of postal "huckstering" wagon.
A contract has already been made
with its inventor and promoter to serve
patrons on the Maryland route for one
year, and another wagon will soon be
operated in Santa Clara County, in the
vicinity of Campbell, which locality has
always been considered by the Post
offlce Department to be an ideal one
for a free rural delivery experiment.
Boxes will be distributed along the route
where farmers may deposit and receive
mail matter.
Postmasters of small officers on the
route will be provided with money-or
der blanks, and these blanks the post
masters Will have the applicant nil out.
He can either Walt for the postal
wjLgon or leave the blank and money
â¢with the postmaster, who, upon the ar
rival of the postal wagon, will hand to
the clerks the blank and money, and
upon receipt of the same the clerk will
Issue money orders.
It will be understood among: farmers
that at any point on the route where
the postal wagon is met by an applicant
money orders will be issued or cashed,
and if they have their letters already
written the orders can be mailed at
once on the postal wagon. The num
ber of money orders to be cashed on
the route would be very small in com
parison to the number of orders to be
issued, owing to the fact that a vast
amount .of money is sent through the
mails in ordering goods from city stores
or sending off for subscriptions to
newspapers, magazines, etc. Large
quantities of seeds are purchased by
farmers by sending money through the
mails, and thu3 thousands of dollars
are risked by country people because
they have no other facility for sending
their money that is convenient, but if
.they could have the conveniences of a
money order system on postal wagons
they would apply for money orders and
this would bring in quite a revenue to
the department as well as being an ac
commodation to those living in the
country. Letters and parcels can be.
registered with the postal wagon as
well. This would be an additional reve
nue, as frequently country people will
not go to the trouble of visiting Post
offices to register mail matter.
Each of these wagons will be
equipped with a "strong box" and the
carrier or driver will be provided with
arms for his own defense as well, as
Uncle Sam's mall.
GOING HOME TO VOTE.

DRIED FRUIT AND RAISINS IN NEW
. YORK.
V The New; York Commercial says, under date
of October .26: '"There is a somewhat better
; feeling In the market and prices tend upward
in a number of departments. Business Is bet
â¢ ter. Buyers are more numerous and mall or
der* are doming in more liberally. Short sup
plies stimulate demand., atid prices appear, to
' be on the point of advancing. "-... ' â  .:
"There is no change in the California raisin
â ltuatlon. Buyers still hold off. waiting . for
â¢ome change in the position rwhlch. will relieve
â  the strained relations now existing. It Is said
that nearly one-half the, crop available- for â 
shipment has already come forward. Whether
- the association will modlry tne existing condi
- tlons remains to be seen, but it is thought
.'that no concessions can be. secured. The man
agement seems determined to hold to lto present
course regardless of the Influence oh the trade.
;â ."â  It is certain that prices will range high and
that supplies can scarcely be secured below
pteiaent quotations. . â â 'â¢.-.":
-â '-â -."Prunes are steady. Large sljee are .scarce
and held firm at present. flguFes. Very few
such are obtainable, and are sold only to move
less desirable goods. They :cannot be bought
by themselves. Supplies are coming forward
from Oregon and Washington In considerable
quantities and are proving more satisfactory
than was anticipated. Large sizes are scarce
there also. No French prunes a#e coming as
yet and few are expected. The price in France
Is too high. . â  :
. . VAprlcots are steady at high range. Export
â  demand Is Increasing, but supplies are scarce.
; and.trade restricted in consequence. There are j
no stocks procurable from # first hands, and all
are held firm in second and third. The result
' Js a firmer position than the trade has known
for some time. â  . â  â  â .
. 'â . "Peaches are steady at high range. Fancy
are up to 22c for selections. Lower grades are'
. steady. There are but few to be had at any :
price. Some increased inqulrj' for export is.
iÃoted, but otherwise the market is unchanged."

EASTERN MARKETS.
; NEW YORK STOCK MARKET. .
NEW YORK. Nov. Iâ The trust stocks, con
tinued to absorb their share of attention ln.|
Wall street to-day. The fluctuations wÂ«re ylo- j
lent and at times conflicting, but owing- to the
predominant Influence of Tobacco In this class
of securities most of the group .closer!- at net
losses. The trading in all of them was' full- of
life, and there was no conclusive reason known
to the public either for the early advance or
S* subsequent decline. Probably the Inherent
weakness. of Sugar, In view or the formidable
trade war in prospect, was the roof of the
difficulty,, which was precipitated by the- an-
nourieement that one of the new rival .com
panies had commenced melting sugar to-day.
There has been support of Sugar for several
days, with the obvious intent of aiding: the
rise in Tobacco,, and when it proved too heavy
to-day Tobacco took a sudden drop of over
Bix point? and fluctuated feverishly, for tfie Vest
of the day. It is quite possible that Tob.acco
was allowed. to fall with a view to shaking off
an undesirable speculative following, but what- \
ever the purpose the movement of the price was
purely manipulative and under control. The
Federal Steel stacks fell off from the best In
sympathy-, but the fluctuation In these- wn's
tnuch narrower and the support, apparently,
more substantial. The always vulnerable coal
ers came In for severe raps on the. grounds of
the unfavorable September statements of Read- i
Ing and New Jersey Central and .general â¢ de
pression In the anthracite trade. Extreme de-i
cllnes ranged from 2 to 3Vi In the group, whirh
uncovered stop loss orders, but which was fol
lowed by a rally on covering of shorts. A xlse .
' of 1% In. Manhattan on talk of new and power
ful interest* in the company aided the harden
ing tendency of the market In the late dealings...
Changes In the railroad list are very small ,a.s
a rule. There was more activity shown In I
railroad bonds than in stocks, and though
prices as a rule were easier there were excep
tions on the side of gains. Total sales, $2,110,
000.
United States 3s registered an 4 the old 4s
registered advanced % in the bid price. The
3s coupon sold as high at 105* i ex-interest, |
which is equivalent to the best preceding .price
w.lth the Interest on.

The Oakland avenue .Methodist Church
in Milwaukee has > -en successfully '
moved on rollers over seven city blocks
of pavements. The church had to be di
vided into three parts, of which its tall â¢
tower is one and its main auditorium an- â¢
other. The three portions have just been
reunited on the new site, and by October
1 the church is expected to be in as good
condition as ever. ' â  â 
The march of civilization In Burma is
full of interest and amusement, even to
the most casual observer. Young Burma
cannot now go forth as his father did, in*
loose but comfortable sandals; he must
have fancy colored socks, held in rigid
order by fancy garters worn 'about the
swell of the calf, while Cromwellian shoes
with large steel buckles have caught on"
famously.

land from the Water Front Company and
agreed to present it to' the city if the city
would undertake to provide for the dredge
â  ing of Lake Merritt. The city has agreed
| to do this, and the dredging from the lake
will form " the new park. - This improve-,
. ment is one of " great Importance, for all
- time there has been ' a ' 'dirty, sluggish
s stream trickling through this twenty'
acres of mud in the heart of the". city be
tween Lake Merritt and the estuary.' It
has always been more or.. less 'offensive;
and of " late the lake has become more
polluted on account of theincrease in .the
sewage emptying into it. The plans for.
â¢which the dredging provides - embraces
the building of bulkheads, the making of
: the park and the i construction of a
seventy-five foot channel sufficiently. deep

Just two month ago William B. "Ward j
was divorced from his wife. .' The story.!
leading to the separation was â  a very!
pathetic one. The Wards are. elderly pieo- j
pie. They have lived together until their i
family has grown up. Ward held an im-'J
portant position of trust in Sari Fran-"|
Cisco, but certain practices were indulged
in by him which led to his wife seeking
a permanent separation. " â¢ .j
When the testimony was taken In the !
divorce caae Mm. Ward was so solicitous j
of the husband from whom she felt she had
a moral and legal right to be separated as- 1
to cause comment. She was anxious that
tile elderly man should not be left with
out a home or provision and was ex
tremely anxious that he should have a
just share of their property. Pending the
negotiations Ward went to his wife's
home and smashed in a window, for
which she very reluctantly had him ar
rested.
After the granting of the divorce the
Wards realized that they could not close
their lives apart. The husband expressed â 
a willingness to be all that his wife de- j
sired, and nothing else was lacking toj
legally reunite the husband and wife, who j
had practically never been separated. \
They desired to remarry, but found that -i
the law of California forbade them mak- !
insr amends for past unpleasantness by
taking such a course. Undeterred by this
obstacle they journeyed to -Reno, and the
code of Nevada offered no resistance to
them, being reunited and they were mar
ried a' week ago.. They have returned to.'
Oakland and are now living the evening
of their lives in the same old home. at

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

John W. Lynn, who about seven months
ago attempted to murder his wife by
shooting her five times, and who was
subsequently committed to the Insane
Asylum at Uklah, has recovered his
reason sufficiently to be discharged as
cured. He will be brought back to this
city for trial.
The circumstances of the shooting are
still fresh in the memory of many. The
wife had refused to live any longer with
â¢Lynn and was stopping with her sister
on fcovcnth street, near Bush. One day
Lynn called there and tried to persuade
her to ro-turn with him, but she refused,
whereupon he whipped out a revolver and
shot her five times. Thjs wifo recovered

preliminary examination that he had al
ways acted ]K-rf<ctly sane until the
Fhooting. Lynn, however, fejgned In
sanity to such perfection, having at one
time been an attendant at the Agnewa
Asylum, that he -was finally declared in
sane and committed to Tkiah
It is quite probable that when tried his
attorney will make evÂ«ry effort to secure
his acquittal on the ground that he was

round match between Jim Riley of the
Ban Francisco Athletics and Charles Tye

a draw, but proved one of the cleanest

The men were very evenly matched and
both put up an excellent fight. As pre

A LIFE SAVED BY A ROCK.
Miraculous Escape of a Child From
Being Run Over.
OAKLAND, Nov. I.â The four-year-old
child of Peter Strogan had a miraculous
escape from death to-day. Strogan drives
a wagon for the Renton Coal Company,
arid while driving down Franklin street
this afternoon he had his child by his
side- on the seat. In some manner one
of the forward wheels slipped off, and
father and child were violently thrown
upon the macadamized roadway.
. The elder Strogan sustained numerous
severe -bruises about the head and face,
.for Which he was treated at the Receiving
Hospital.
The -child, on the other hand, had fallen
in front of the . rear wheel and would
sumy have been crushed to death, but a
huge-, rock intervened between the child
and the wheel. Over this rock the wheel
bounced, and the child's form was thue
avoided and escaped uninjured.

â  Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
-....- â¢ 908 Broadway, Nov. L '
"It is â¢ a good thing for posterity that
these people have no children." These
wefe the concluding remarks of Superior
Judge Ogden when he denied a decree of
divorce this morning in the suit of Mrs.
Susan L. Hpllocher against Michael iiol
locher.
\ Judge Ogde,n took occasion to pass some
severe strictures upon the couple. Hol
locher had admitted on the witness stand
that he had told his wife he would blow
out his brains, but that such a thougnt
riever was farther from his mind. He
said, too, that "he was tired of listening,
night after night, to half a dozen women
talking about Brother So-and-so,'' and,
therefore, had left his home many even
ings."
In summing up the case, Judge Ogden
stated that the" charges of willful negiect.
extreme cruelty and failure to provide had
certainly not been borne out by the evi
dence" at hand. According to his Honor's
view, -"the -natural family conditions had
been reversed and Hollocher wore skirts
Instead of the conventional pantaloons."
Hollocher's thfeats as to taking life the
court considered as the "mouthings of a
man of inferior powei and scarcely of any
consequence."" The court intimated that
he had. once held an interesting conversa
tion with a leading scientist on the sub
lect of- tree love, in which, his Honor, at
that, time, did, not believe; but in the pres
ent case the court wa3 inclined to the
belief of a- -tendency toward free love as
a. result; of -such family disputes.

OAKLAND, Nov. 1. â The contest of
John Schneider and George Metzger over
the $'200,000 estate of the late Christopher
Streitberger was ended in the Superior
Court to-day, when Judge Ogden ordered
letters of administration Issued to D.
Bruns and T. F. Graber, the executors
named in the will of April 14 IS9B. Schnei
der and Metzger were named as executors
in a will made prior to tne one admitted

test, â¢ however, will now be taken upon

DISCOVERED HE
COULD HEAR
Peculiar Case of Abe Sherman, Who
â¢ : . Was.T hought to Be. a Deaf Mute.
.Over in Berkeley, at the Institute ror tne Jueai ana Dumb ana the Blind,
the peculiar case of little Abraham Lincoln Sherman ia attracting unusual
attention. Little Abe Is 9 years
old, and it is only a few months
ago that the fact that the little
fellow could hear was brought to
the attention of the authorities.
Abe comes from a family of
deaf mutes. Both of his parents
are deaf and dumb, as are also
his three brothers and little sister.
The authorities at the institute
are at a loss to explain the little
Sherman fellow's case. It may be
a case of latent development, they
say, or else It is the direct out
come of parental neglect and
cruelty. Abe's father Is not the
noblest of men, and when the
little fellow and his two brothers,
named respectively Daniel Weo
ster Sherman and William Te
cumseh Sherman, were placed in
the institute it was at the in
stance of the authorities, who
rescued the little ones from begging upon the streets in Southern Cali
fon Abe's father, the teachers at Berkeley agree, may have known
that he could h<-ar, and found in that fact a drawback to his begging
career. It is known positively that he was not allowed to associate with
hearing children, and it is surmised that he may have been threatened if he
attempted to talk.
Miss Moffltt, the teacher of articulation at the institute, first maae
the discovery that little Abe could hear. Eapecial attention was imme
diately given to the little fellow. Speech at first developed but slowly,
but within the past six months the boy has developed quite a vocabulary
and speaks freely with his teachers and his blind fellow-pupils. The au
thorities of the institute are at a loss Just what to do with the little fel
low To turn him over to his people is to deprive him of the elevating
moral tone of the school, and yet to develop his latent speech it is aoso
lutely necessary that the child should associate with children who enjoy
ihr> Rense of sound.

908 Broadway, Nov. 1.
"Sale of tickets temporarily postponed."
This little notice posted in the cars of the
East Oakland street railroad system this
morning caused much surprise to the pa
trons of the road. It simply means that
instead of paying four cents foi\ a ride
they will have to pay five cents at pres
ent.
I For a long time the syndicate railroad?
[ have been selling books of tickets at the
! rate of twenty-five for a dollar, good on
! any of their lines in Alanaeda, Berkeley
or Oakland. By a system of transfers by
\ which passengers could travel from Bay
I Farm Island to the university, or from
! Frultvale to West Oakland, for one fare,
j or one four-cent ticket, a larfee travel has
been built up. Hundreds of working peo
ple have purchased books of tickets, and
especially since the rearrangement of the
higher grades in the public schools have
pupils been forced to do much traveling.
Without any notice the privilege of four
cent rides has been cut off.
Inquiry at the office of the syndicate
to-day brought out the Information that
the suspension of the sale of tickets is
! temporary and will depend on certain in
formation which the company is attempt
ing to learn by withdrawing the sale of
tickets.
There is competition, the only competi
tion across the city between the syndi
cate and the Haywards electric road.
The Haywards road also sells tickets for
four cents, but there has been no agree
i ment to raise the fare between the roads.
; "It is a surprise to us," said a director ot
! the Haywards road to-day, "that the
I syndicate has suspended the sale of tick
ets. At the same time we do not believe
it to be good policy to Bell cheap tickets
when roads are not paying expenses. Few
I other cities in the country sell tickets for
less than a nickel. In New York the four
cent ride is unknown, and there, on ac
count of the immense population, cars
carry four passengers On each trip to
every one that we carry. In San Fran
cisco, "where the average ride i 3 much
shorter than In Oakland, everybody pays
a nickel. Although the syndicate has not
attempted to enter into an agreement
with us, I cannot say that we are op
posed to the straight five-cent fare."
A report was current that the book
tickets had bean counterfeited, and that
spurious tickets have recently been taken
in. One of the managers of the company,
when spoken to this afternoon, partially
confirmed this story.
"The discontinuance, of the sale," he
said, "is only temporary. - W& want to
get in the tickets which are out, or most
of them. There may be some out which
we did not sell, and we want to discover
that. If it is so. We want to find just
where we stand on the ticket business. I
think the sale of the books will recom
mence In about a month."
A PECUIiIAB LITIQATION.
Ex-Husband and Ex- Wife Fight to
Hold Property for Which tb.3
Former's Sister Sues.
OAKLAND, Nov. I.â A most peculiarly
complicated litigation 1b on before Su
perior Judge Greene, wherein Mrs. Bertha
M. Hall sues William H. and Abble E.
Clarence, married Abbie E. Halt,
cated in Alameda.
The plaintiff and William Clarence are
brother and sister, and with the money
left them by their late fp.cher, Henry Clar
ence, who died in San Francisco about
eleven years ago, they, in May, 1886, pur
chased the Alameda lot, which was placed
in William's name. At that time Mrs.
Hail was Mrs. Hamm, but she became di
vorced and married Hall on September
15, 1888, on which day her brother, William
Clarence married Abbie E. Hall.
In 1894, out of love and affection. Clar
ence deeded the Alameda lot to his wife
Abbie, who has since obtained a divorce
from him. The property now stands in
Abbie Clarence's name, and Mrs. Hall is
seeking to regain possession. The most
peculiar part about the litigation is that
the ex-wffe and ex-husband are mutually
striving to have the title remain where It
isâ in the ex-wife's name-he testifying in
her favor. The lot is worth several thou
sand dollars.

"Water-Front Case Closing.
OAKLAND, Nov. I.â The defense in
the now famous water front case this af

ALAMEDA, Nov. I.â The closing week

speakers of the evening.
The club' will meet Saturday night at

908 Broadway, Oct. SI.
L. C. Jones, alias Frank Thompson, thÂ«
bicycle thief, when informed about noon
to-day that Detectives Shorey and Hodg
kins had discovered the particulars of his
unsavory career and antecedents, tried to
commit suicide in his cell at the City
Prison by hangirfg, and almost succeeded.
The detectives, ever since the arrest
last Thursday, have been investigating
the record of the young man who claimed
his name as JTrank Thompson and his
residence as Alameda. They discovered
that he had served time in San Francis
co's prison for the very same offenseâ
that of bicycle stealing. There he went
by the name of L. C. Jones. Strange as
it may appear the first of the eighteen
bikes stolen in this city disappeared on
the day after Jones' release across the
bay.
When confronted with the facts of his
career remorse took possession of him,
and later, when Detective Hodgkins
passed through the corridor, he heard
heavy breathing. Investigating, the pris
oner was found hanging from the grating
over the cell door. As a rope he had used
his blankets torn in strips. He was
unconscious but soon recovered.
To the detectives he gave as a reason for
his desperate attempt at suicide that he
was unable to secure opium In the prison,
and without which he could not live.
The detectives and police are now more
confident than ever that they have In this
prisoner one of the boldest thieves ex
tant.
Incidentally they have learnpd that
Thompson, or Jones, has been intimate
with a young woman in West Oakland.
They have not yet discovered in what
manner he disposed of the stolen wheels.
Miss Duffy's Play Accepted.
BERKELEY. Nov. 1.-The committee
of the junior class of the University of
California appointed to select the farce
to be acted next junior day met last night
and decided upon one. From the seven
plays handed in under the competition

to have the most merit. The farce is en
titled "His Wife's Will." It will be pre
pented by a cast composed of members of
the Junior class early in December. Miss
Duffy, the successful competitor is on
the editorial Staff of this year's Blue and
Gold, and has already made quite a repu
tation in college as a story writer.
GRAND JURY ON
ELECTION CASES
WILL INVESTIGATE UNITED
LABOR PETITION.
Also Making Preparations to Sue the
Bondsmen of the School
Trustees.
The Grand Jury will be called upon to
investigate the persons concerned in the
scheme to get the United Labor ticket
upon the official ballot for the coming
election through the use of fraudulent
signatures to the petition presented to the
Registrar. Mr. Biggy is now at work col
lecting evidence, which is said to be di
rected toward the promoters, YV. P. Grace
and others. It is intimated that the of
ficers of several political clubs will be
brought before the Grand Jury to explain
how certain fraudulent signatures hap
pened to get upon the petition.
The cases of the members of the School
Board charged with unlawful overexpen
diture of the school funds is now before
the Grfind Jury, and the attempt is to bo
made to reach their bondsmen, through
civil suits, as already outlined in The
Call. Martin Kelly, charged by the Ex

the Grand Jury concerning the gas and
electric light contracts recently entered
into, and which it is alleged are fraud
ulent.
CHAMPIONSHIP BEGATTA.
A Good List of Entries Has Been Re
ceived for the Various Events.
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Athletic Association is hard at work pre
paring for the championship races to be
held at Long Bridge next Saturday. At
a meeting held on Monday night it was
decided to extend the time for making en
tries for the events until last night and
to defer until Thursday night the task of
choosing the officials who will have the
regatta in charge. The first race is to
start at 11 a. m., and the subsequent races
are to follow at intervals of thirty min
utes. It was suggested that the starter,
referee and Judges should be experienced
oarsmen, familiar with the rules of the
association. Considerable discussion en
sued as to the necessity of registering
contestants, but no definite conclusion
was reached.
Last night the committee held a meet
ing, at which the following were present:
W. C. Espy of the Pioneers (in the chair),
J. R. Bockman of the Ariels, S. J. Pem

pital. Now that the hospital cannot be
constructed we have some extra money
and it is certain that the Health Departr
ment will get what it wants, some $10,000
0r^15,000. Then there will still be a snug
sum to expend for the further improve
ment of Market street with bitumen. In
fact, I think we are going to have all of
the cash that is needed for various ob
jects. It seems highly probable that the
proposed incineration of garbage by the
city without the collection of the same,
will operato to reduce the cost so we
will not have to* use more than one-half
of the $150,000 set apart in the tax levy
for that purpose."
A Big Failure.
August Herrime of this city filed a peti
tion in insolvency In the United States
District Court yesterday. His liabilities j
are $138,851 and his assets $2990. Hft heavi- |
est creditors are F. S. Wesinger of
San Francisco, $74,454 borrowed money,
and Mrs. Arthur Rodgers of San Fran
cisco. $26,738. Hemme has been interested
in land and orchards in" this State and
Mexico, and the petition is the culmina
tion of business embarrassments that i
have been public property tor a long timje. )
Joseph Wilson of Oakland also fileq a pe
tition. His liabilities are $4977 and, his as
sets none.
Williams. Will Recover Damages.
Judge Belcher handed down an- opinion
yesterday denying, a motion for a new
trial in the case of John H. Williams
against the Southern . Pacific Company.
Williams was injured in a smash-up near
San Ardo station, and sued to recover
damages for the injury he sustained The
jury awarded him a judgment of $14,000.,
The company made a motion for a new
trial on the ground that the judgment
was excessive and on various points of
fact and law. The court, however, re
fused to entertain the motion for a- new.
trial, and in consequence tHe case will in
all probability be taken Fefore the Su
preme Court.

SAN JOSE, Nov..!.â Hirtiry. T. Qage,
the Republican candidate for Governor,
boarded : the 7. o'clock train at Santa
Cruz this morning, and .arrived . h!ere a
few minutes "before- 9 o'clock. He was
a trifle pale when tie. addressed-, the
meeting at Santa : Cruz last night and
had apparently little.. strength to. spare
at the conclusion .of the effort. . This
morning, after ,a five, hours': sleep, he
was in good form, owing to. his splenr
did constitution.. ...... "\ . : :
The return trip over the mountains
to the Santa .-.Clara Valley :was delight-;
ful. At Glenwood, Los Gatos and
Campbell he was greeted &y the; cheeFS
of ardent, supporters; . Many of the peo-"

The booming :of ; cannon . and the
strains . of patriotic music heralded the
arrival of the next â â¢: Governor ; at. the
narrow-gauge railway station in this
city. This was the/ opening or-: begin T:
ning of the ': greatest daylight.' ovation
ever accorxjeda caiididitein California:
In more than one regard-, the. demon T
strations in this: city to-day were rec
ord breakers.: : The Y magnitude of the
throng, the enthusiasm manifested and
the confidence of ..victory, inspired by
the Ovations : were topics of general
comment among all. classes. ' Thfi Re
publicans of. San Jose expected- a great
turnout and rally equal. to the- best ef}
forts of previous ; campaigns, -but th.ey
did not expect such a tremendous out
pouring of the masses as that which j
has made this . day remarkable tn the
political annals Of: Santa- Clara County.
'It was arranged that the Army and
â Navy Republican League; . composed or
veterans of the -war which preserved,
the Union, should have the honor ;
along with the ladies pf the Women- s
Relief Corpse of receiving the next
â Governor on his arrival here, and the
pleasure of entertaining him during; the
forenoon. It Svas arranged in advance,
also, by the Republican National
League Club of; Saa Jose that an after
noon reception and two dayligh.t meet
ings be held under the auspices of the
â¢national organization. .'; . â¢ " '
According to the : plans the veterans
were at the depot to. welcome . with
cheers and music the champipn of the
people. The line of:, veteransâand i,he
. alignment was excellent-^extended the
length of the entire depot. : As. Mr. Gage
walked along the lint:, escorted by the
reception committee, such' cheers .as
only veterans can. give saluted him. He
passed along, raising . his . hat in recog
nition of the salute.. With the : stars
and stripes floating over them. the.vet

Since the day San Jose crave welcome
to.U.'.S. Grant there has been in the
valley no patriotic ovation equal to the
reception which the Army and Navy
League gave to-day to the standard
bearer of the Republican party of Cali
fornia. . â  â â â â â â 'â â '.'â¢ . â¢ . '
When the head of the marching col
umn reached the hall the ranks were
opened, and the carriages containing
the distinguished guests passed
throusrh the line. Again the cheers of
enthusiastic men who had borne the
flag on many a field of battle greeted
the manly leader of the Republican
legions in the contest for good govern
ment, law and order. Alighting from
the carriage, to which four superb black
horses were harnessed, Mr. Gage and
his escorts ascended the broad stair
way leading to Grand Army Hall. The
ladies of the Women's Relief Corns
were first Visited. When the desire -of
the loyal ladies to see ; the next Gov
ernor had been gratified, the veterans'
reception began. The gallant old sol-,
diers who had been on duty since early
morning crowded around Mr. Gage and
gave him the cordial pressure of their
hands. The occasion demanded a
speech, and the standard bearer, who
Ras shoSvn in this arduous campaign
that he is equal io any occasion, re
sponded in a patriotic vein. He ac
knowledged -the compliment of the
greeting. He referred to the long march
of the veterans, and observed that it
had a meaning higher and graT.der than
a personal tribute to a candidate for
office. It signified renewed determina
tion upon the part of the veterans to
uphold the honor and defend the con
stitution of the country. Mr. Gaice ex
pressed the belief that so long as these
veterans survived, and so long as their
example should * speak, the anarchy
doctrine of Maguire could never find
lodgment in this country. The ap
plause responsive to this sentiment
shook the building.
At the conclusion of the exercises at
Grand Army Hall Mr. Gage met many
hundreds of the citizens of San Jose.
One hour's rest at the St. James Ho
tel gave him strength for the duties
of the afternoon. Meanwhile the peo
ple were coming from Nlles, Gilroy, Los
Gatos. Palo Alto, Saratoga, Milpitas
and the farms, vineyards and orchards
which have made this region of Califor
nia famous. They came to attend the
daylight meetings and Judge by per
sonal, observation what kind of a man
the Republican nominee for Governor
was. Hon. E. F. Preston came from
San Francisco and Hon. T. B. Hutchin
gon came from Napa to join Henry T.
Gage in these meetings.
Fifteen hundred people assembled at
Turn Verein Hall. The audience was
called to order by Dr. McGraw, who In
troduced as chairman Senator H. V.
Morehouse. The eloquent Senator
opened with a speech which aroused
the greatest enthusiasm. He paid a de
served tribute to the honor, integrity
and ability of the Republican nominee
for Governor.
When Mr. Gage stepped forward in
response to the introduction the cheer-,
ing was tremendous and prolonged. He
spoke for nearly one hour and com
manded the undivided attention of the
audience. He talked with unusual vigor
and animation, attaining heights of
oratory that evoked shouts of approval
from the audience. He handled the
railroad settlement question in a mas
terly and convincing manner.
He spoke of the United States Senate,
mentioning by name many of the emi
nent men of that distinguished body,
and invited the attention of his coun
trymen to the record that every Sena
tor of that great body had voted for
the railroad settlement .which Maguire
had pronounced Â« infamous. The infer
â¢ ence was drawn that Maguire was so
I small in comparison with the able men
I who supported the measure that a
{ microscope was needed to reveal him.
The Congressional Record was pro
duced to show that Maguire was now
dqing the demagogic act in declaring
against the settlement.
Mr.. Gage paid a noble tribute to the
gallant soldiers and sailors who rallied
around the flag at Santiago and Ma
nila. A mighty shout went up when he
proclaimed with firmness and ardor
that not one inch of foreign territory
acquired by the heroism and blood of
.American soldiers and sailors should
ever be surrendered and that the flag
should forever wave where brave
Americans had giveta their life blood to
plant it.
In conclusion Mr. Gage spoke of his
early struggles in California, mention
â¢ ing how he came to this State thirty
years ago a mere boy, friendless and
"broke." He did not recount his strug-
I .gles and hardships to show that he
! should be â  made Governor because he
had overcome obstacles, but he did cite
the fact as an offset to Maguire's claim
for' gubernatorial honors on account of
blacksmithing for a brief period.
In closing Mr. Gage, who had won
. the favor of the audience by his cour
age and manliness, spoke a few words
in which he promised ta render the peo
ple the best service in his power should
he be elected Governor. He repelled
Maguire's assault on the honor of the
Republican State convention, and in
this connection embraced the oppor
tunity toreturn thanks for the support
which Santa Clara County gave in
making the nomination unanimous.
Senator Morehouse, in presenting to
the audience Hon. E. F. Preston, called
forth another volume of applause. Mr.
Preston's speech justified the Senator's
eulogy., as it was logical, eloquent and
incisive. Without meaningless phrases
or mincing of language Mr. Preston
exhibited and commented on Maguire's
un-American, unpatriotic and unprin
cipled attitude in Congress and in this
campaign. The "Little Giant" was de
servedly roasted for endeavoring to ex
cite class prejudices, hatreds and dis
sensions among the people of this coun
try. Mr. Preston demonstrated by ex
amples the promotion of men from the
humblest walks of life to the highest
public station and logically asserted
that there were no oppressed classes in
the United States.
Mention was made of the wise and
beneficial measures which have ren
dered the administration of President
McKinley so acceptable to all the people
of the land. Great applause attested the
logic and eloquent force of Mr. Pres
ton's speech.
Simultaneously another great day
light meeting was cheering Republican
orators at the Auditorium in another
part of the city. This meeting was
called to order by W. A. Beasly, vice
president of the National Republican
League Club. J. R. Patton of the Good
Government League was named as pre
siding officer. He performed his duties
in a most acceptable manner. While
Mr. Gage was speaking at Turn Verein
Hall Hon. T. B. Hutchinson. one of the
most brilliant and persuasive orators
of California, held the earnest attention
of 2500 intelligent citizens at the Audi
torium. He spoke for one hour, dwell
ing upon the achievements of the Re
publican party and the exalted patriot
ism displayed by party leaders in peace
and in war. Maguire's opposition to
the war revenue measure came in for
deserved comment. Mr. Hutchinson
Justified the expectations of the vast
assemblage. At the Republican State
Convention he made one of the three or
four really able and eloquent speeches
of the session, so public desire to see
and hear him was great.
The reception accorded to Henry T.
Gage by the vast assemblage at the
Auditorium inspired the standard bear
er to his greatest oratorical achieve
ment of the campaign. He spoke with
an ardor and fluency tEat animated the
great audience to the highest pitch of
enthusiasm. Mr. Patton introduced
him to the people as a man of superb
moral courage, a man of integrity â a
man chosen by the people, from the
people, to lead the people.
A great wave of applause was the
response to the eloquent words intro
ducing the standard bearer. When si
lence was restored Mr. Gage began,
and spoke for one hour and thirty min
utes without betraying any signs of
fatigue. He touched on single tax and
other isms of the fusion nominee. He
ventilated Maguire's war record â
speaking of the "Little Giant's" hesi
tation to provide supplies and support
to the American troops in the field at
Santiago and Manila.
In reviewing the cheap demagogy
of Maguire on the railroad question Mr.
Gage came very nearly saying in so
many words that Senator White knew
that Maguire's tactics on the pretended
Issue were those of a demagogue.
Allusion was made to the Senator's
argument that Maguire, having held of
fice for a long time, should continue in
the service. The logical inference,
therefore, was that no one but a con
firmed office-holder should aspire to
serve the people. The argument was
advanced by Mr. Gage that here was
an effort to establish a privileged class
I of office-holders.
The remarkable daylight meetings
dissolved with rousing cheers for Gage
and Neff. In all the speeches of the
head of the ticket high tributes were
paid to the noble qualities of Jaco-b
Neff.
To-night the Republicans of this city
are confident that Gage and Neff will
carry Santa Clara County by a major
ity approximating 1200. Senator More
house predicts that the majority will
be 1500.
Mr. Gage left San Jose at 5:35 p. m.
for San Francisco. A great throng
went to the depot to give him a good
send-off. It is estimated that In his
receptions and meetings to-day he ad
dressed 5000 people. Every one con
cedes that he gained votes.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1898.
SAN BERNARDINO'S
GREATEST RALLY
Senator Perkins Talks
to Thousands.
MARCHING CLUBS IN LINE
CBOWDS POTJB IN FROM THE
NEARBY TOWNS.
Monster Demonstration, Removing
All Doubt as to Political Senti
ment in That Part of
the State.
Special Dispatch to Thfc Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. I.â The
Republicans of San Bernardino showed
their true strength to-night in the big
gest rally ever seen in this city, even
surpassing in point of numbers and en
thusiasm the one addressed by Gage
and Barnes last month. If there were
any doubt in the minds of the people
that a great majority here are inter
ested in Republican success it was ban
ished to-night.
Senator Perkins arrived this morning
and was received by Judge F. F. Oster,
C. C. Haskell, F. L. Holcomb, Colonel
A. Wood and Seth Marshal, the recep
tion committee. At 6:10 this evening
the celebrated Americus Club of Pasa
dena arrived and was taken to Repub
lican headquarters. Crowds were al
ready on the streets in such numbers
that passage was almost impossible.
After the arrival of the Colton and Riv
erside delegation a procession was
formed with the Americus and Truman
Reeves Marching clubs, the latter, do
ing its beautiful fancy drills, and
marched to the depot to meet the
Chino and Ontario Flambeau clubs.
Along the line of march to the
there was a continual ovation. On each
corner red fire burned; the people
cheered and the clubs cheered back.
The pavilion was crowded and it was
with difficulty that reserved seats for
visitors were kept vacant. Judge F.
W. Gregg called the meeting to
order, and, after music by the band and
a glee club, introduced Senator Perkins.
The gentleman took the floor amid a
storm of applause that was hard to
still.
Senator Perkins opened with the good
news that he was positive of Republi
can success in every department, and
asserted that he spoke from personal
observation made on a campaigning
tour of Northern California. He said
that he could tell that the people are
thinking this year of political methods;
and when people think it means Repub
lican success.
The speaker .dwelt upon local affairs
for a time, noting the wants of this
valley and the plans of the Republicans
to relieve them. He complimented
every club and section of people pres
ent. He illustrated the influence of the
women in a family for the Republican
cause, drawing the conclusion that its
principles must then be the most nearly
right because there were more women
Republicans than women in all the
other parties combined.
Senator Perkins reviewed the Repub
lican administration; told of the bene
fit of the Dingley bill; the immense
balance in trade now realized in favor
of this country, and spoke of the pro
tection of citrus fruits, of wool, cattle,
etc., and the benefits derived-. The Sen
ator claimed there would hardly have
been a Democrat or Populist in- the
State had we had a good sort of a year;
"but," said he, "we must look ahead
and see good times and insure them by
voting the Republican ticket."
Senator Perkins said he believed Ma
guire started out in this campaign hon
est in his intention to fulfill all pledges,
but he has now found there are too
many of them in the platforms of three
parties he represents, some being dia
metrically opposed to each other. It
will be physically and morally impossi
ble to satisfy them all. Mr. Gage can
fulfill the promises in the grand old
party platform.
The Senator discussed the national
issues and the war. His talk was
thoroughly appreciated.
MARYSVILLE WARMLY
WELCOMES DE VRIES
Congressman Speaks of the Record
He Has Made in the Lower
House.
MARTSVILLE, Nov. I.â With the zlp
boom-ah of skyrockets, the pop of the
roman candle and the glare of red nre
galore, the people of Yuba and Sutter
counties gave to Congressman Marlon de
Vries a warm reception this evening on
his arrival to deliver an address in the
Marysville Theater on the issues of the
day. There were music and enthusiasm
such as has characterized few rallies in
this section during the present campaign.
Attorney W. H. Carlln was chairman
of the meeting, and the following promi
nent Democrats were named as vice presi
dents: Hon. H. P. Stabler, Harry Dalton,
A P. Lipp D. P. Donahoe, H. E.
Schmidt, K. S. Mahon, H. McGuire, Dr.
G. W. Stratton. Dr. C. E. Stone, Dr. E. E.
Stone, F. Dubarry, J. W. Watson, S. D.
Hicks, William Lowery, F. B. Crane, W.
P. O'Brien, C. B. Andross, I. G. Cohn, Dr.
E Hanlon, J. P. Herbert, Amos Lelande,
E. P. McDaniel. D. Gettins. L. P. Farmer,
N. B. Kirtley, George Stearnes.
The speaker said he had no explanation
to make or apology to offer for anything
he had done or advocated in Congress.
He had fulfilled all pledges and was will
ing to stand on his record. He spoke elo
quently of the war with Spain and of the
unanimity with which Congressmen of all
parties stood by the President.
He voted for the 150,000,000 initial
appropriation for the public de
fense, for the declaration of war with
Spain and for every aproprlatlon called
for and every measure looking to the suc
cessful termination of the war. He voted
for the Hawaiian annexation measure, aa
he considered Hawaii necessary from a
strategic standpoint.
Mr. de Vrles discussed the Nicaragua
canal, favoring Government construction
and ownership of the waterway. If a
measure to that end were not passed dur
ing the ensuing short session the building
of the canal probably never would be ac
complished by this Government, as the
concession to which the United States
would succeed would expire by limitation
and the work then be taken up by some
other Government.
He did not consider Speaker Reed a
Czar. No request made Dy him was de
nied by Reed.
The Congressman touched on the cur
rency question, the railroad issue and tne
necessity of California returning him am
Congressman. He was followed by 8. D.
Hicks, local nominee for the Assembly.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
VALLEJO, Nov. I.â James G. Ma
guire, the Democratic candidate for
Governor, addressed the citizens of
Vallejo at Farragut Theater to-night
and was accorded a rousing reception.
He was accompanied by E. L. Hutchi
son, candidate for Lieutenant Gover
nor; Will S. Green, for State Treasurer;
H. A. McCraney, for Clerk of the Su
preme Court; J. Aubrey Jones, for Con
gress, and H. M. LaÃue, for Railroad
Commissioner. They were met at Val
lejo Junction by a reception committee,
headed by Edward McGettigan, who
later acted as chairman of the meet
ing, and were escorted to the Bernard
House.
At 7:30 o'clock the streets were
thronged by people. Bonfires in dif
ferent parts of town were lighted and
the inspiring strains of the Independ
ence band were heard. The hall was
filled in a few minutes, nearly every
one having a small American flag. At
8 o'clock the party was escorted to the
hall, where John W. Sweeney called the
meeting to order, stating that an over
flow meeting would be held at the bank
corner.
Edward McGettigan was introduced
as chairman and presented Judge Ma
guire.
Judge Maguire claimed that the is
sues were clearly defined between the
monopolies on one side and the people
on the other. He lauded the fusion of
the Democratic, Populist and Silver
Republican parties. He claimed the
last named as the legitimate successors
of Lincoln's policy as the Democracy
was of Jefferson's.
Passing to the State ticket, he spoke
highly of his associates, advocating
their election. He spoke more espe
cially for the candidate for Railroad
Commissioner, claiming that the South
ern Pacific Company opposed him. He
urged the election of a Democratic
Legislature.
The money question'was discussed at
some iength, the speaker reaffirming
the vagaries of free coinage.
The action of Republican speakers in
making the Spanish war a subject of
political discussion was criticized, and
General Barnes came in for a share of
the adverse comment.
The increase of the navy, was fa
vored, and the speaker devoted con
siderable time to explaining his posi
tion on the funding bill. He refused to
discuss the single tax, but claimed that
neither Gage, Barnes nor Preston knew
anything about it. In conclusion the
Hpeaker pledged himself to impartially
discharge his duties If elected. He was
followed by several other candidates.
The overflow meeting on the street
was addressed by Messrs. Jones, Hut
chison, McCraney, Mulholland and Ma
guire. It was not very enthusiastic,
and all the speeches were brief.
ALABAMA MINISTER
HANGED IN EFFIGY
Made Himself Obnoxious as Chaplain
of a Regiment Just Mus
tered Out.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.. Nov. I.â Rev. O.
P. Fltzslmmons, rector of St. Mary's
Church, a fashionable Episcopal congre
gation, and chaplain In the First Ala
bama Regiment, which was mustered out
yesterday, was hanged in efflgry from a
post in front of the Commercial Club last
night while enjoying a banquet at the
Morris Hotel tendered by him and other
officers of the regiment to Lieutenant
Colonel J. B. McDonald.
The chaplain had offended the privates
in the regiment by taking a rigorous
stand against mustering 7 out several
months ago, and in addition to that had
created a breach between Colonel Higdon
and the rest of the commlsaioned of
ficers. Colonel Higdon siding with the
privates in their desire to quit the service.
On the stuffed figure which represented
Fltzsimmons were placards reading:
"Chaplain O. P. Fitzsimmnns. First Ala
bama Volunteers"; "He wanted to be a
major, but he got left"; "He talked about
our mothers and lied out of It"; "He
never visited, he was too good;" "He
liked good whisky and a quiet game."
When Chaplain Fltzsimmons was in
formed at the banquet table of the Indig
nity, he denounced it in round terms.

Editor Call: When I spoke on Mon
day night In Oakland I did so with a
olear understanding of the seriousness
of my action. I spoke In obedience to
â what I considered the call of con
science. â '. â "â â â ' â  . . ' .
I knew by experience that the Ingenu
ity of the politician would misrepresent
my position and that the malignity of
tie unprind -d would blacken my mo
tives. For this I was prepared. I was
not prepared to be attacked with a
mendacity so reckless that only Its
Utter idiocy prevents us from admlra-
tion. â¢ :".-.;;.; â -.-. .j
I am not sorry, however, that the at
tack has been made. It gives me an
opportunity to state my position, my
reasons over again. Writing letters to
the papers is no easy task, but the labor
Is well spent. I have now no power in
this city and I have never had any
power except a righteous cause and ar
guments that appealed to reasonable
men. In all my controversies I have
ever striven to address myself to men's
minds and not to their prejudices. In
this, which â¢---omises to be my la^t con
troversy for a time, I should be
ashamed to trust to any sentiment ex
cept the sentiment of equal justice to
all men. I ask no man to follow me for
personal friendship or for private ends.
I rest my case on the facts and ar
guments which I present to the public,
and if these facts and arguments are
not weighty enough to sway the pub
lic mind I haye no desire to influence it
by other means.
This (Tuesday) evening's edition of
the Bulletin contains three articles
dealing with my utterances of last
night. The first Is a semi-editorial, the
second a letter signed James D. Phe
lan, and the third a communication
"In Defense of Stewart Menzies." With
each of these articles I will deal in or
der.
The semi-editorial is headed "Father
Torke's utterances not sanctioned by
the church. He sperÂ«:s only for hln.
self. As such he has no authority in-,
politics. Does hot represent those who
are the source of his influence. Hia at
tack on .Mayor Phelan was. a bojiibj
which exploded harmlessly. Having
ceased to edit the Monitor his politic-kl
course has no public interest. General
sentiment that his remarks last nignt
â were imprudent and ill-advised."
In the body of the article I am solr
emnly admonished that I am of no ao
count, and the Bulletin is sadly coirir
pelled to part company from me. If I
am of such little account the manaee
ment of the Bulletin has shown Door
Judgment in , devoting so much space
to my condemnation, and if the. Bulletin
has been with me in the past, it is .the
first time that I was aware of being In
such Questionable .company. *â¢ ,
These things aside, I beg to offer In
the very beginning my protest against,
the assumption that underlies the
whole article. That assumption is that
the Catholic church is in politics, and
that up to this my authority has con
sisted in the fact that I have been' the â 
official representative of the Catholic,
church in political affairs. Now, "Bays,
the Bulletin, I have severed my connec
tion with the Monitor, and therefore I
am entitled to no more weight than
any other politician. When the B.ulle
tin says I have severed my. connection-,
with the Monitor, the Bulletin says
what is not true. I am as much editor
of the Monitor to-day as I was a year
ago. It is true that I am preparing to
take a vacation from my duties, and
that the labor of settling many details
has left me no time to write for the
paper, but I am still Its editor, and the
Bulletin is merely saying the thing
that is not. . â¢ ' : .'â¢
Now let me inform the Bulletin:
that the Catholic cnureh is not in
politics in this city or in any. other
American city, and. that neither as
an officer of the Catholic church nor
as editor of the Monitor have I any
"authority in politics." ; â  ' ; / . -,
The accusation that the . Catholic
church is in politics is one. of-. the" old
calumnies of the A. P. .A;, arid as. such
Is at home in the columns of the Bulle
tln. In the Canadian habitat pf. its edi
tor such calumnies are bred in the
bone. They are imported over the
border to serve the purposes of preach
ers who preach bigotry for money,.and
of Journalists who support candidates
for cash. â  '"â  . ' : -
The Catholic church is not In politics;
in this city. She dictates to none of her
children their party affiliations; , she
commends no man to their suffrages.:
Catholics are as free as the people, of
other denominations to vote as they
please â nay, they are far more free. :No;
political sermons are heard from Cath
olic pulpits as political sermons axe:
heard from non-Catholic pulpits. It Is.
our immemorial custom to reserve our
churches solely and entirely for the ser
vice of the Lord. - â¢
Therefore I resent the ignorant as
sumption of the Bulletin that the Cath-;
olic church is in politics in this city.
I resent it in the name of the tens of
thousands of my Catholic friends who
glory in their political liberty â aye, and
I can resent it in the very name of my
enemies whose strongest, loudest,
angriest cry against me is. Away with
clerical dictation.
At no time during my residence in this
city have I been in politics. If any man
should question my right to take part
In political affairs I should indignantly
ask him who gave him the commission
to curtail my citizenship. But of my
own free will I have abstained from
participating In political affairs. I be
lieved I could do more service to the
Catholic people by standing for those
principles that transcend politics. For
nearly five years I have spoken and
written incessantly not for political
parties, not for ambitious candidates,
but for the principle of religious lib
erty. I took the stand that religious lib
erty and equal rights were more to all
true Americans than party measures or
personal success.
I took the stand that every man who
denied me and mine equal rights was
unworthy of the suffrages of a just peo
ple. I took the stand that every man
who profited by bigotry or approved of
bigotry should be treated afteF the
same manner as the bigot himself.
These were high principles and drastic
measures. I was told that I should have
mo-e policy, and that such lofty aims
could not be attained In politics. I pre
ferred to believe in the people. I hate
policy, and as long as the Lord leaves
me strength to think, to speak, to write,
may I never make compromise with
dishonor.
My tactics were successful. I re
ceived no help from the newspapers;
I received no help from the politicians.
The Bulletin says that it was the first
and only great secular daily to declare
itself against the A. P. A. The Bulletin
is a fraud. The Bulletin came out
against the A. P. A. when the A. P. A.
was, as an organization, shattered and
broken, and then it came out only
when the discarded cashier of the
Shortridges thought it a <*ood chance
to gain Catholic subscriptions. Boyle,
who drew his salary cheerfully from
the A. P. A. gang that once employed
him, was, when he was kicked out, Just
as willing to create his salary by pre
tending to serve the other side.
The fight against Apaism in this
city was not a political fight. It was a
fight for the highest principles em
bodied in the American constitution.
We, who made the fight, asked help
from no politicians and received none.
From the papers we received Just such
publicity as they thought it would be
profitable to give. It was a fight made
by the common people and carried on
to a successful conclusion by the votes
of the common people.
When two years ago it became my
duty to oppose Taylor on the Republi
can ticket, some Republicans talked of
clerical dictation and declared that it
was a political device to help the Dem
ocrats. They said: "Taylor is not a
member of the A. P. A. He has no
sympathy with them. He does not
think it good policy to throw away
their votes." When I stood for the
principle thai no man who accepted aid
and comfort from Apaists was
worthy of freemen's votes, I was ac
cused of doing politics for the Demo
crats. I was not accused by Mayor
Phelan and his supporters. They were
glad to profit by my action. Then
they thought it Just and laudable and
proper, because it helped them to attain
the object of their ambition.
Now the situation is changed. Mayor
Phelan stands to-day where Taylor
stood two years ago. It is now my
duty' to deal with the Democrat as
then I dealt with the Republican. I
were the veriest coward did the differ
ence .in party -make me. .change my
course. I were worthy of every evil
thing said against me did I sing dumb
because Mayor Phelan is a rich man.
I were a traitor to my people did I
condone in the soi-doisant Catholic the
crime I denounced in the Protestant.
If I am in politics now, as Phelan and
his purchased Bulletin contend I was
in politics two years ago; if it is a
crime for me to be in politics now it
was not a virtue to be in politics then.
The crowd that now denounce priest
riding and clerical dictation were the
same hangdogs' who sniffed about my
feet- when they thought my footsteps
led along the pathway to power.
I No man will dare hold that Mayor
iPhelan can , do .no wrong. He has
grasped within these few months many
of the attributes of royalty, but not
even the most sycophantic lickspittle
in his train will declare that he is al
ways right. It is quite possible that
he has pandered to : bigotry. It is
quite possible that he is a moral,
coward. It is quite possible that his
mind is built on the same exiguous
as its' corporeal habitation and
that he .cannot grasp what principle
means. ' These things his followers
must admit- and admitting tMem their
course is not to .howl about my power,
not to yelp about clerical dictation, not
J.to snarl at -the priest In politics, but to
face the facts and to sift the evidence.
If my contention is right then I stand
where I stood in 18S6, where I stood in
1894.- The fact that a rich man now is
â the culprit does not alter the principle.
The fact that the ninety-nine nonenti
ties who pose as the Democratic party
â¢ are the sufferers does not change the
merits of the case. Either Phelan is
supporting men who have denied equal
rights- to Catholics in this town or he
is not. If he is not let Clinton, Lack
mann, podge and Menzies purge them
selves :before the people, and if he is
then as a- traitor who has profited by
the struggles of those who with a sin
gle heart sought religious freedom he
deserves to be relegated to the lowest
round of political damnation, even as
Judas is placed by the poet in the* bot
tommost circle of the hob of hell.
. The question of fact brings me to the
second .artfcle In 'the Bulletin, namely,
the letter signed by James D. Phelan.
In that letter Mr. Phelan purports to
jjive the history of the negotiations in
the- case of the Sailors' Home. Either
the mental effort of speaking his little
campaign pieces has disabled Mr.
Phelan's me.meory or he Is guilty of de
liberate mendacity and .'misrepresenta
tion. He : tries to make It that the
original trouble between the Sailors'
Home and myself was caused by my
desire to have Mrs. Theall's society get
control of the institution.
Mr. Phelan is the last man in San
Francisco who should mention Mrs.
Theall with disrespect. The ."'distri
bution of the literature" at which he
now sneers was the means that made
him Mayor of San Francisco, and the
cowardly little cad only a tew weeks
ago tried to bribe that same Mrs.
Theall with the promise of a petty
office if she would make his losing
fight. â¢
Luckily, however, I am not dependent
on Mayor Phelan's memory or on Mayor
Phelan's veracity for a correct descrip
tion of my attitude in the case of the
rival societies that were looking for
the Sailors' Home. In the Monitor of
January 15 I wrote:
"As to the ultimate disposition of the
Sailors' Home we have very little inter
est. Whether it should be or could be
conducted by any private society is in
our minds a very doubtful proposition."
On January 22 I wrote:
"We have no desire to mix ourselves
with the affairs of societies. We deal
simply with the exterior question, Is
the home under sectarian control?"
Therefore when Mr. Phelan calls the
new society Father Yorke's society he
is simply lying. He knows it was not
my society. He knows that I had no
desire that that society should obtain
control of the home, because my pri
vate opinion was that no private so
ciety could run the home honestly. He
knows that my sole desire was to put
an end to the sectarian character of
the old societyâ a character which is
burned into it by the unchallenged fact
that never in forty years was a Catho
THE SAIST FE AX CISCO CALL, WEDKESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, . 1898.
lie priest asked to cross Its threshold.
Mr. Phelan goes on to say that "as
long as there was opposition when the
lease came before Mayor Phelan for
his signature he communicated with
Father Yorke, and Father Yorke replied
that in his Judgment the sectarian fea
tures having been eliminated there was
no further point in the opposition."
Mr. Phelan is merely telling an un
truth.
Does he think the people of this town
have no memories? At the very time
he was signing the lease I was on
record in the Monitor and in the daily
papers as to my belief in the sectarian
character of the "home. When he plead
ed that the Board of Supervisor's would
pass the lease over his veto and prom
ised to gain some more concessions, I
told him half a loaf was better than no
bread. I did not profess myself satis
tied, but I was satisfied, and over and
over I have stated publicly that I was
satisfied with the Mayor's action. I
have never called him to account for it,
because I thought that it was the best
I could get from such a knock-kneed
champion of religious equality.
But the Mayor's innocence did not
exculpate Clinton and Dodge and Lack
' mann. The Mayor's innocence in the
matter of the lease did not assail them
for their treachery in voting for Chria
Reis, the indorsee of the A. P. A. They
stood before the people as men, who, by
their votes, had declared that public
property should be turned over to- a sec
tariaji society, and that public office
should be bestowed on a man who ap
proved of the bigots that swore on
Bible and crucifix to deprive the Catho
lic of his daily bread.
When Mr. Phelan says that my sole
reason for my present action is per
sonal pique against Dr. Clinton, again
Mr. Phelan is telling an untruth. If
personal pique were my sole cause
would I have promised to have with
drawn my epposition if the men in
question could give any explanation of
their vote that would hold water? If
personal pique were my object I might
have received and been satisfied with
the treacherous proposal of Mr. Phelan
made in this office not two weeks ago
simply to oppose Dr. Clinton and to
let Mr. Phelan go free, as Mr. Phelan
himself was unfriendly to Dr. Clinton
and had refused him permission to
hang his banner from the Phelan
building, and all Mr. Phelan's friends
were out with knives against Dr. Clin
ton as the cause of all the row.
My personal feelings in this matter,
far from being an incentive to action,
have been a detriment. I am not so
stupid as to imagine that my enemies
will not be ready to impute personal
and unworthy motives to me. I am
not so ignorant of the ways- of the
world as not to know that the suspi
cion of personal animosity would de
stroy all my best efforts for principle.
Therefore, instead of urging me on,
the personal attacks made on me by
Clinton held me back. I was willing
to do anything if he, as leader of the
combination, could give an honest ex
planation of his vote.
But when that explanation was not
forthcoming, what was I to do? These
men, Clinton, Dodge and Lackmann,
were precisely in the same case as Tay
lor two years ago. If I had kept silent
about them because they had Mayor
Phelan's powerful protection then I
would betray the people who two years
ago had voted for religious liberty, and
who this year. were looking to me for
light and leading on that all-important
point.
Mr- Phelari pretends that he has no
personal responsibility for nominating
Dodge, Clinton and Lackmann. Months
ago Mayor Phelan announced that
Dodge was to be Assessor. In the pres
ence of his secretary, Mr. Sullivan, he
informed me that he could have stopped
the nomination of Clinton if he wished
to do so. Lackmann's nomination was
an attempt to secure the nomination of
Clinton by the Republicansâ a pretty
little trick which would enable Mr.
Phelan to tell those who disapproved of
Clinton's course to beat him if they i
could. Every one knows that the com
mittee of one hundred is Phelan's pri
vate property; every one knows that he
was especially concerned in his Board
of Supervisors. It is too late now for
Mr. James D. Phelan to evade the re
sponsibility. Let him stand to his guns
like a man and make his fight as best* \
he knows how. Then we may have some
respect for him. No one can have re
spect for the man who tries to escape
the consequences of his own acts by
disingenuous pleas and excuses based
on untruth.
The committee of one hundred knew
the real reason why Clinton and Dodge
and Lackmann were opposed. They
knew that these men were accused of
voting against the rights of Catholics.
They were afraid to take up the ques
tion. One member who was described
by Mayor Phelan as a "pestiferous
little chap," E. P. E. Troy, said that if
Clinton were not nominated he would
get on the floor of the convention and
say that the members were priest rid
den. This decided Mr. Phelan. He said
he could not afford to go before the
people on the question of religious lib
erality and equal rights. He might
lose votes. Cowardice triumphed be
cause above and beyond everything
else James D. Phelan is a moral cow
ard.
But this was not the extent of Mr.
Phelan's offending. The third docu
ment in the Bulletin is an alleged com
munication in defense of Stewart
Menzies. It says: "Having perused
the Rev. Father Yorke's speech of last
night, permit me to correct one of his
statements in regard to Mr. Stewart
Menzies and his being indorsed by the
A. P. A. In the first place, Mr. Men
zies has never been a candidate for
office during the existence of the
A. P. A." This is merely another un
truth. In 1894 Stewart Menzies was a
candidate for Freeholder on the Non-
Partisan ticket. He received the
A. P. A. indorsement. Mr. Stewart
Menzies was willing to accept that in
dorsement In 1894, when the A. P. A.
was strong; he is willing to repudiate
it now that the A. P. A. is no more.
Now, Mr. Editor, I close. I have
again put before the people the facts in
this case. Mr. Phelan and his asso
ciates will not Improve their position
with the people by Imputing personal
motives and shouting about clerical
dictation. Again let me say I am not
in this matter for personal reasons,
and most emphatically I am not in it
for politics. If I were anxious for my
personal comfort, for the friendship of
the rich, for my peace of mind, I would j
have left town quietly without warning I
the people of Mr. Phelan's treachery.
Perhaps it would have been policy for
me to have done so, but God forbid
that the day shall ever come when I
shall mislead the people that trusted to
my word and made sacrifices in my
cause for the sake of my own peace or
for consideration of policy. Principle
belongs to men; policy, is the watch
word of cowards.

"You're no good! In my opinion ycra

Thus spoke P.olice Commissioner Gunst,

disengaged hand slapped his face. As
Neuberger begged for mercy Gunst re
leased his hold on his nose and gave him
a parting kick. Neuberger offered no re
sistance and seemed satisfied to get away
with his life.
The trouble between Gunst and Neuber
ger dates back to several months ago
when the Police Commissioner ordered
him to keep away from his cigar store
on Powell street. Neuberger swore venge
ance and eagerly awaited a chance to
get even with Gunst. This opportunity
arrived when Porter Ashe was nominated
for Senator in the Twenty-fourth Dis
trict. Leon Dennery, his opponent, is a
Â§ersonal friend of the Commissioner,
eeing a chance to cause trouble for
Gunst the revengeful attorney Informed
Ashe that the Police Department was
working against him. He claimed that
Captain Wlttman and Sergeant Martin
had been Instructed by Gunst to do all
in their power to elect Dennery. Con
vinced that Neuberger was telling the
truth, Ashe, at a meeting Monday night,
bitterly denounced Wittman and Martin
and claimed that they had been ordered
by Gunst and Chief of Police Lees to con
centrate their efforts in electing the Re
publican candidate. He also paid his re
spects to the head of the Police Depart
ment and Commissioner Gunst, roundly
scoring .them for being too friendly with
his opponent, as he claimed.
Convinced* that Neuberger had inspired
the "roast, Gunst determined to "call
him down." While walking along Market
street yesterday afternoon with a friend,
the Commissioner espied Neuberger
standing at the corner of Kearny street.
Gunst accostedÂ»him and asked him what
he meant by saying that he was making
a fight against Ashe.
"I'm dead on." declared the attorney,
his breast swelling with pride. "You
can't fool me, and I want you to know it."
"I think you are a dirty cur," replied
Gunst, as he reached for Neuberger's
nose. He held the nasal organ between
his fingers for several seconds and then
slapped Neuberger's face with his disen
gaged hand.
lf l didn't say anything about you,"
? leaded Neuberger. "You know I'm your
riend."
Gunst at this juncture released his hold
on the attorney's nose, and as the latter
started to walk away he gave him a kick.
"I'll see you later," retorted Neuberger
from a distance. ''You can't bluff me,
even if you are a Police Commissioner.'
Accompanied by his friend, Gunst left
the scene and walked to his store on
Kearny street. When seen last night he
said that Neuberger had angered him,
and he determined to pull his nose.
"He is always getting somebody In
trouble," remarked the Commissioner. "I
did not particularly object to him saying
that I was out for Dennery, as those who
are acquainted with him know that he is
given to the habit of talking too much.
When I learned, however, that he was
going about the city abusing me, I con
cluded it was time for me to call him
down. I saw him standing on Kearny
street, and walking up to him I pulled
his nose. He pleaded so that I released
my hold on his nose and affectionately
Bmote him on the cheek. He then ran
away, evidently fearing that I intended
to wreak further violence on him."
Neuberger is the individual who sued
ex-Captain of Police Douglass for heavy
damages for throwing him out of the Po
lice Court during the examination of
Theodore Durrant for the murder of Min
nie Williams. The suit was dismissed, as
it was shown that Neuberger was to
blame. Subsequently he was arrested for
breaking into a stall at the racetrack and
getting away with a valuable horse. Neu
berger had a claim against the owner of
the horse, and failing to collect it he re
solved to take the animal. He was ar
rested and charged with burglary, but
the case was dismissed in the Police
Court.

will be avoided by the construction of
larger stands, the purpose of which is not
in contemplation of a larger attendance
but for the greater accommodation of the
vast crowd.
The inclined plane that is built along
the south side of the gridiron will be
about the same width as that of 1837, but
it will be of much greater length. The
management is- determined this year to
sÂ«li no more tickets than will comfort
ably fill this standing space. The over
crowding of this section in the game last
year was no less than criminal, the spec
tators who paid for general admission be
ing herded in this plane with almost fatal
results.
The plan of construction is similar to
that of preceding seasons. There win tie
a stand erected on the Harrison-street
side of the grounds which will connect
with the present grand stand and continue
to the west end of the field. The east side
of the gridiron will be bounded by bleach
ers. The north side will be blocked by
a long set of bleachers running the entire
distance of the field. This will be re-
Berved for the Stanford and California
students and their friends, each college
being set apart In sections. Nothing has
as yet been done In regard to the re
served sections for the University Club.
It is very likely that they will get their
usual sections on the south side of the
field. The boxes will be built above the
stands on both sides of the gridiron. The
total seating capacity will be 9500; stand-
Ing room for 3000.
The prices to be charged for admission
will be as follows: General admission
which means standing on the incline >I
reserved seats, $1 BO and $2. The |2 seats
will be choice, situated close to the center
of the field. The box seats will be $2 60
The returns of last year's intercollegiate
game amounted to $16,000. The crowd was
the greatest ever collected at a football
match in the West. While It Is not ex
pected that a larger gathering will see
the match this season, It is anticipated
that there will be a gate receipt of fully
$16,000.
At the game next Saturday between the
Olympics and Stanford the Stanford
alumn! will be present In large numbers
Cards are being Bent out to the gradu
ates of that university who reside in this
city to meet on the field and cheer their
team to victory.
TO KEEP THEM SOBER.
Check to Be Placed Upon Election
Officers.
The Board of Election Commissioners
has paased a resolution which is intended
to prevent drunkenness among election
officers at the polls next Tuesday. Here
tofore it has been a common practice for
some of the officers to sell their demands
on the treasury early on election day and
to use the proceeds in drinking.
The resolution reads as follows:
Resolved. That no assignment of election de
mands upon the treasury of the city and county
will be recognized by the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners or Registrar of Vot
ers for iiervlces rendered as officers
and clerks of election, and demands
allowed by this board will be delivered
only to the persons In whose names they are is
sued and who have performed the services to
which they were appointed.
