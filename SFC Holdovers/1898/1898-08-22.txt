CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 21.â 1t is not tÂ»o much
â¢to say that there were several dplega
: tlons -which left San Francisco with an
jaea that they would carry all things
before them, and it naturally follows
that some people are to be disappointed.
There was Gage, for instance. Mr.
. Cage has a large following. He is a
man, who has the advantage of a pleas
ihg, presence. He is still young, but
,' he has the gray hairs which bespeak
â¢ wisdom. That Gage enter? the Sght
â¢ -.with a full knowledge of what awaits
/him is evident. He doe? not think that
. : the : *yay is clear. He realizes that there
..are- other aspirants, and that some of
â¢them: have a reasonable chance. While
'.Gage comes into the conflict reasonably
. confident he knows there are others.
Mr. Pardee came to Sacramento on
an .earlier train. There were th<>se who
call-ed it a special train, but no matter.
If Pardee can afford a special train, he
has ' a. right to it. Certainly the matter
Is o*ie between himself and the rall
â¢ roaci and whether or not he pays the
bill is a subject of no possible interest
â¢ here. Of course there were on each
â¢train no end of aspirants for nffloe.
S< :-rie of these had been heard of be
. -fore,- or some will never be heard of
again, and yet â¢â¢ is interesting to watch
their courses.
. There was, for instance, Willis G.
fitter who arrived in Sacramento to
. night &*bd save out the declaration
that he wanted to be Attorney-General.
Witter was onoe Assistant United
States District Attorney. He has been
practicing law in San Francisco for ten
rs and he is out to pluck the plum
from Ford and Guy who seem to be his
most formidable opponents. Of course
th.-r-e is no telling yet what might hap-
pen.
The streets of Sacramento are
thronged to-night. During the Demo- I
â¢cratic convention there was nothing j
like it. lam unable to say what the â 
.result may be, but surely the Demo- j
crats who were here last week never |
had such hope as inspires the candi- |
dates now in evidence. At least the
present aspirants hope that they will
â¢be elected if nominated, while those
here last week had nothing to hope for
beyond the doubtful glory of a nomi
nation. _ , . _ __
Sunday was observed in San Fran
cisco. About the quarters of Gage and
Pardee there was an air of quiet which |
indicated a regard for churchly tradi- j
tinris. " On the way to Sacramento, !
however, things were somewhat dif
ferent," but of course this is a subject
â¢iiot: to be mentioned here lest some
question arise as to the standing of the
principals, a delicate matter not to I

handle now. Pardee may be very
pious and Gage particular as to the
carrying on of the campaign, but as
the thing Is started they cannot help
themselves.
Charles L. Patton was aboard the
Gage train. Patton is a candidate for
Governor, although he has not said
much about it, and possibly might fall
into the place of Lieutenant Governor.
Of course there was much political gos
sip throughout the train which brought
the chief aspirants to the capital, but
of course it had no particular value and
is not worth recording. Another day
and the story may be known.

READY FOR THE
BIG CONVENTION
Delegates Assembling and Candidates
for the Party's Recognition Lining
Up Their Forces.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. Sacra
mento, Aug. 21. â All is in readiness for
the big Republican convention, whl-.h
Is to convene here on Tuesday next.
Secretaries Hlpgins and Steppacher of
the State Central Committee and a
corps of assistants labored hard yes
terday changing the appearance of Ag
ricultural Hall, in which the Democrats
held forth last week.
High above the platform from which
the eloquence of scores of speakers has
been heard, and in position of promi
nence, the features of President Wil
liam McKinley gaze down on the tiers
of seats which will be occupied by
scores of delegates of every portion of
the State. Beneath the splendid like
ness the prophetic words "Advance
agent of prosperity" have been placed
as a reminder of what the administra
tion has accomplished.
The pictures of Governor Budd, Sena
tor Stephen M. White and Judere Ma
guire, the stalwarts of the Democratic
party, will give way to such beloved
standard bearers as Lincoln, Grant,
Blame and Sherman. About the con
vention hall. Old Glory will be seen in
greater profusion than at the preceding
gathering. The festoons that beauti
fied the hall will remain, but further
charm will be added by numerous
plants gathered about the structure.
The pictures of modern heroes â Schley,

evergreen and about the fountain
in the center of the hall larfe
paintings of the Maine. Olympia
and Oregon will be placed. The
seating arrangement will be . en
tirely different from that of the preced
Ing convention. Secretary Hlggins has
so arranged it that the smaller coun
ties will be closer to the speakers' stand
than at the Democratic convention,
where the large counties were given the
preference. To the left of the delegates
chairs have been placed for the speci
ally Invited members of the fair sex,
and close to the platform a band will.
: discourse patriotic melodies. A quar
j tet has also been engaged to sing th*
j national air. and it is expected that the
i delegates will join in swelling the an
j them.
Candidates and delegates are begin
j nig to arrive. The evening trains
brought an influx of both, and immedi
| ately the Golden Eagle Hotel became a
j scene of activity. The strength and
I desirability of those in the race were
i discussed, and over the refreshment
'â  counter of that famous hostelry prom
ises of support were freely exchanged.
I That there will be livelier times
I durii.g the next * few days tha"
were seen during the Democratic
State Convention is already ap
parent. The Los Angeles delegation
has engaged a half dozen rooms at the
Golden Eagle as headquarters. The
rooms will be used in making Henry
T. Gage's fight for the Republican
nomination for Governor. Near by Dr.
Pardee of Oakland has established
headquarters, as has Thomas H. Flint
Jr. John P. Jackson, Collector of the
Port, has engaged rooms at the same
hotel. He will set forth the fitness of
his son Charles for Attorney-General.
Colonel D. M. Burns has established
headquarters at the Golden Eagle. R.
J. Waters, who is a candidate for the
Congressional nomination from the
Sixth District, has also a suite of rooms
there. John C. Lynch. Collector of In
ternal Revenue, is quartered at the <
same hotel. Three other headquarters ;
have been established by friends of |
"dark horses," who are likely to be
come known to-morrow. i
C. W. Childs of San Jose is quartered
at the ' State House, where he will make ,
his fight for the nomination for Super- ,
lntendent of Public Instruction.
At the Capitol Hotel, immediately op
posite the Golden Eagle, Secretary of
State Lou Brown, has headquarters.
The room is profusely decorated in the
national colors. and pictures of
leaders of the Republican party are
displayed.
Other candidates who have taken
rooms at the Capitol Hotel are W. R.
Guy for Attorney-General, J. M. Wal
ling of Nevada for Associate Justice,
T. J. Kirk of Fresno for Superintend
ent of Public Instruction, E. B. Edston
for Railroad Commissioner, John F.
Ellison for Associate Justice and Alex
Brown for member of Board of Equali
zation. Grove L. Johnson who is a
member of the Sacramento delegation,
declares himself unalterably opposed to
the candidacy of Tlrey L. Ford for At
torney-General. He says Mr. Ford is
a nice gentleman, but he wants a law
yer for Attorney-General. The Sacra
mento delegation, he says, will caucus
at Metropolitan Hall on Tuesday morn
ing at 11:30 o'clock. According to the
ex-Congreesman, the delegation is fav
orable to Judge W. C. Van Fleet, Judge
T. B. McFarland and Judge A. J. Buck
les for the office of Supreme Justice.
No opposition haa as yet been de
veloped a gainst the names of M. J.
Wright for Purveyor General or E. P.
f'olgan for Controller. Robert Nixon
of Treka and Samuel Donati of San
Luis Obispo are prominently men
tioned for the nomination for State
Treasurer.
The 8 o'clocok train brought a great
many candidates and their assistants.
Delegates Paid Respects to Ga&e and Pardee, Then Hurried to the Sacramento Train.
! Immediately upon their arrival they
i went to their hotels, where they regis
i tered. They then spread themselves
among the delegates and began secur
ing the promises of support of men who
are early on the ground. T. H. Ward,
incumbent of the office of Supreme
Court rlerk, who is desirous of being
again placed in nomination, is on the
field of action. George Hoot and his
chief Sid, Charles Johnson, are work
ing for the same end, as is also Louis
H. Jacobs, I. E. Sheehan and W. P.
Reynolds, all of San Francisco. The
fight for the nomination of Supreme
Court Clerk will be a warm one, judg
ing by the number of candidates in the
field.
Dr. Pardee's forces are already here,
arriving on the same train which
brought Guy Searl, Jim Oliver, Miles
Doody, Cal Ewing and others, all wear
ing a large white badge on which was
printed "Our choice for Governor,
George C. Pardee."
T. H. Selvage of Eurega and Frank
McGowan of San Francisco are work
ing hard for the nomination of Lieu
tenant Governor. The former has had
printed a card, on which Is his photo
graph and place of residence. Mc-
Gowan and his friends are quietly
button-holing delegates and looking
wise.
Charles F. Curry, County Clerk of
San Francisco, and Paul Austin of San
Jose, are looking for the nomination of
Secretary of State, and in their effort
to land the nomination are doing a
great deal of lobbying.
William Beckman and George H.
Clark of Sacramento and E*'B. Edson
of Siskiyou are in the field, making a
fight for the nomination for Railroad
Commissioner of the First District.
PARDEE IS HOPEFUL.
Expects the I^epublicao Party
Will See Justice io Alameda
County's Request.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 21.â There is not much to be said
about the situation. As is usual just before the meeting of the con
vention matters are in confusion. Alameda County hopes that
the Republican party will see the justice of her request, and that
it will concede to her what she has justly earned "by her magni
ficent services to the party.
So far the contest has been a friendly one between all the
candidates. There has been no unpleasantness developed, and no
doubt there will be none. GEORGE C. PARDEK
George Arnold of Los Angeles reached
the capital city early this morning and
is quietly working to succeed himself
on the State Board of t Equalization.
His opponent is Frank' Mattison of
Santa Cruz. The struggle for the office
of Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion is keen. Thomas J. Kirk of Fresno
is in the fight and hopes to get the
plum. S. T. Black, the incumbent, and
C. W. Childs are also in the race. Mr.
Childs arrived early this morning and
is hard at work.
COMMEND WHITE'S STAND.
Delegates to the Republican Conven
tion Praise His Defense of
Henry T. Gage.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS,- SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 21.â One, of the principal
topics of discussion among the delegates
to-night is the manly letter -of United
States- Senator .Stephen M. /White, pub
lished in to-day's Call, wherein he vindi
cates the honor and good name of Henry
T Osier o "
The letter of Senator | White not only
serves as an answer to an ill-founded ru
mor but sustains its author In the high*
esteem in which he has always been held*
by the people of California, irrespective of
political differences. . The fact that f Sen
ator; White is a personal and political
friend of James G. Maguire and also that
he seconded. the nomination of Judge Ma
irulre for Governor adds additional weight
to his unequivocal testimony.
Result of Nevada Primaries.
RENO, Aug. 21.â The Silver party pri
maries.of Washoe County resulted in the
election of three delegates for and ten
against the Sadler-Bergsteln faction. The
election provided a hot contest and a
close vote.
Candidates for Party Fa
vors Are Rounding Up
Their Supporters.
MANY DARK HORSES IN THE
BACKGROUND.
M. M. Estee and George A. Knight May
Come to the Front After the First
Ballot.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 21.â The signs clearly
proclaim to-night that this Republican
State convention. In point of attend
ance, animation and expression of pa-
trlotlsm, will equal If not surpass any
meeting of Republican leaders ever as
sembled in California. The forces are
gathering on the field to-night, and al
ready more interest is manifested in the
work outlined than was displayed in all
the proceedings of the late Democratic
gathering. The electric lights were on
in Dr. Pardee's headquarters in the
Golden Eagle shortly after the arrival
of the delegate-laden train.
Fred Campbell and Samuel K. Thorn
ton, who are old-timers, alert observers
and adroit campaigners, were on hand
to greet the delegates from the inter
ior. Dr. Fardee arrived on the train
due here at 9:45 o'clock. Henry T.
Gage, the favored son of the sunny
south, came on the same train with
Pardee. Phil Crimmlns likewise came.
Martin Kelly also came. Colonel Dan
Burns arrived earlier in the day. In
the list of notables arriving this even
ing were Judge A. J. Buckles of So
lano County, post commander o-f the
Grand Army of the Republic. Judge
Edward Sweeney of Shasta reinforced
the throng. These two Judges are can
didates for the office of Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court. Charles L.
Patton of San Francisco is here.
Events may take such a turn that
Mr. Patton will be placed on the ticket
as the nominee of the convention for
Lieutenant Governor, although he has
been prominently mentioned for the
higher office of chief executive. Par
dee and Gage were not the only leaders
of men who came to the front to
night. Among others were E. F. Pres
ton of San Mateo, John Fravis of Ama
dor and E. O. Hale of Santa Clara, all
of whom are at home at convention
speaking.
On the way here from San Francisco
many incoming delegates had the
pleasure of meeting and exchanging
a few words with Mr. Gage. The can
didate from Los Angeles was assured
that the Solano County delegation was
unpledged and free to cast its strength
for the best man in the list of nomi
nees. Word comes that the Santa
Clara delegation is ready to fall in line
under the standard of Henry T. Gage.
Judge Slack. M. M. Estee and Joseph
C Campbell, who were at the Palace
court early in the afternoon, did not
board the 'train. Mr. Estee said that
he would not attend the convention.
Judge Slack did not contemplate visit
ing Sacramento during the convention,
but it can be said on the "highest au
thority" that one of the Campbells is
coming. The expected Campbell is
Joseph C, who was the Phoenix Club's
candidate for Governor. Mr. Campbell
hails from the Forty-first Assembly
District. The delegation numbers
twelve and will caucus to-morrow
morning to organize. No one can tell at
present exactly how the delegation will
vote. Mr. Campbell himself is solid for
General John H. Dickinson. In the
district from which Campbell halls
dwells Colonel William Cluff. who was
formerly in politics and also on the
staff of General Dickinson before the
war. The friendship, cordial and sin
cere, which bound Dickinson and Cluff,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
has been handed over to Campbell to bÂ«
treasured and kept pure and fresh.
.Thus it is programmed that Campbell,
who so aptly presided over the Republi
can State convention that nominated H.
H. Markham for Governor, is coming
here with a programme.
The indications to-night point to a
large vote from San Francisco for
Gage, but there is no claim of a solid
delegation. It is figured by an old
timer, who is not in sympathy with the
aspirations of either Pardee or Gage
that the delegation of 156 will scatter
In many directions. Colonel Burns, ac
cording to the figures of. the old-time
guesser, can handle thirty votes which
will be cast for â the Colonel has not
named the man. Martin Kelly, by
reason' of some pull gained when the
county committee was enlarged, can
rally twelve or fourteen delegates, who
are now slated for Attorney General
Fitzgerald. Phil Crimmins has a fol
lowing and an estimate that it num
bers as high as eighty votes is made.
The claim is made^to-night by the
Gage boomers that the Crimmins fol
lowing w'ii rally to the support of the
Los Angeles candidate. It is known
that at least nineteen of, the San
Francisco delegation hay
determine 1 to resist all trading propo
sitions and to vote on the merits of the
candidates.
The friends of Gage estimate that
they can bring* 281 votes to their can
didate on the first ballot. The num
ber necessary for a choice is 391. Of the
280 delegates. 170 come from the region
south of Tehachapi. It iB obvious to
the ordinary observer that Gage is
gaining in strength. Influences may be
exerted that may bring about his nom
ination on the first ballot, although
Secretary of State Brown and Thomas
Flint Jr., are positive that they can
hold their own delegates so well in
Ik c that no one can be nominated be
fore seven or eight ballots are taken.
Many people say: "Keep your eye on
George A. Knight."
In the country and among the younff
men of California especially. Knight is
immensely >pular, but he has no as
piration for gubernatorial honors.
George -"-earns to go to the United
States Senate. Mr. Knight told the
Humboldt delegation that he was not
a candidate for Governor. If Knight's
name should get before the convention,
nothing could restrain Humboldt
County from casting its votes and in
fluence in his favor.
At midnight Dr. Pardee opened a bar
relâa barrel at claret punchâ to in
spire his workers and refresh the call
ing delegates. Fred Campbell, sta
tioned at the elevator entrance on the
main floor of the hotel, indicated the
chart by which the delegates could
steer for the port and find the claret of
Alameda's enterprising son.
Joseph Spear, Surveyor of the Port
of Sa"h Francisco, is a delegate to the
convention. He surveyed the field of
politics to-night. At midnight Lou
Brown. Secretary of State, expressed
confidence in the firmness of the dele
gates on his list of followers. He said
they could not be stampeded by a boom
for Gage or Pardee. At the midnight
hour Thomas Flint Jr. was serene and
confident of his ahility to hold his own
against the wiles and stratagem of the
Los Angeles and Alameda raiders.
The fifteen delegates of the Solano
delegation, Ray B"enjamin. chairman,
will caucus to-morrow to determine
what can be done to promote the nom
ination of Judge Buckles for the Su
preme bench. At the caucus the dele
gation will make a strong effort to
gation will make a strong effort to
agree on some candidate for Governor,
so that the entire block will go to one
man. The Twenty-eighth District del
egates of San Francisco have agreed on
Jacob Levy Jr. for chairman. The
Thirty-seventh District delegates. San
Francisco, the delegation to which Ly
man Mowry belongs, will caucus to
morrow and elect a chairman.
MAKES A QUIET CAMPAIGN.
Quakerlike Canvass of M. J. Wright,
Incumbent and Candidate for
Surveyor General's Office.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 21.â During the cana\aas
four 1 years ago an unassuming, unpreten
tious and silent individual passed over thÂ«
State as quietly as a Quaker parson would
move among the members of his flock.
Without the slightest warning he would
suddenly appear in a city or town, and in
many instances it would be a day or two
before the object of his visit would be
known.
He appeared to be no more anxious to
leave than he was noisy in coming. He
moved around leisurely and had a pecul
iar habit of gently holding on to your
hand after he had been presented in an
introduction. About the fourth day of his
visit he would prepare to take his depart
ure, and just at the time the train or stage
was about to pull out he would incident
ally drop the information that he was a
candidate for Surveyor General on the
State ticket and would appreciate It very
much if his newly formed acquaintances
would keep it in mind. Some pitied the
old fellow, as they were pleased to call
him: others laughed and a few suspected
that there must be something wrong with
a man who would take such a course In
the pursuit of an office. When the voting
day came the vote for the silent man was
up" in the figures which call for an election
certificate and for four years past M. J.
Wright of Tulare has been holding the of
fice of Surveyor General. He seems to be
fallowing the same course again in the
matter of securing the nomination for a
second term, and as there is no one
against him he will be given anocher op
portunity of traveling through the State
again in search of votes after the fashion
of a Quaker parson mingling with hit
flock.2
THE GLAD HAND EXTENDED TO ALL
READY FOR THE
RECEPTION OF
THE DELEGATES
Assembling Hosts Enthusiastic and
Ready to Support the Chosen
Candidates.
A Party United by the Success of the
National Administration With Many
Candidates to Choose From.
r.w.L, HEADQUARTERS, Sacra- I
nHMito, Aug. 21. â This is the time when !
the song of the candidate is heard in
the land. On the theory that the early !
bird catches the worm, many of the j
vote chasers are already on the ground,
and are prepared to give the glad hand
to all comers.
Among the few who are sizing up the
Bituation is Arthur L. Levinsky of
Stockton, who has entered the race for
permanent chairman of the conven
tion. "Before I entered upon an active
canvass for the place," said the Stock
ton lawyer to night, "I had a consul- â¢.
tation with Frank Short of Fresno and I
Jacob Neff of Placer, and each of those j
gentlemen assured me of his hearty :
support. I now understand that Short
has again announced himself as a can
didate, and I am told that Neff is not j
averse to accepting it. However, I in
tend to go right along and put up the :
best fight I can. My people from
Stockton will arrive to-morrow, and
will go to work in my behalf. If I win j
the fight, it will be done without en- :
tering into any combination or trade. I
I do not thrnk that Â« candidate for
chairman should resort to such tactics, ;
as he should in no manner be bound j
when it comes to the selection of his i
committees."
P. A. Buell of Stockton is also on the
ground, but declared that his presenc?
here is significant of nothing as he has
no fight to make on any one man or
any one proposition.
"All our people want in San Joaquin."
said he, "is a man to beat Ma-mire,
and from what I hear there is by no
means a lack of material."
John C. Lynch, ex-Congressman
James McLachlan, John C. Wray,
James Clark, John W. Wood. J. H.
Taggart and George W. Holbrook were
among the first to arrive from the
south, and appear in the lobby of the
Golden Eagle.
Charles J. Jackson, candidate for the
position of Attorney-General on the
Republican ticket, is moving quietly
among the delegates, and declares that
his aspirations will be realized some
where along on the first ballot.
Amon- the first to arrive at the
Golden Eagle to-night were Colonel
D. M. Burns and daughter, who were
immediately joined as they entered the
lobby by Mr. and Mrs. Paris Kilburn.
Charlie F. Curry, Frank W. Leavitt,
who is a candidate for the State Sen '<
ate from Alameda County, and Frank
Marston were the next to elbow their
way through the crowd of Saeramen- \
tans who stood waiting for the arrival
of the new comers.
The Alameda delegation no sooner ar- I
rived than they commenced an active
canvass of those who will have a voice
in the convention. Indeed they did not
confine their missionary work to thi
delegates alone, but circulated among
the crowd promiscuously and pinned a
Pardee badge upon the lapel of every
coat-owner 'vho was willing to carry iÂ«..
R. X. Risdo/i was particularly active in
this sort of work, while Sam A. Thorn
ton looked on approvingly.
Colonel Dan M. Burns will open head
quarters to-morrow at the Golden Eagle
Hotel. He says that he is here to as
sist in nominating a ticket that will
bring out the full Republican vote of
the State. He also says that he has no
candidate to send to the front, but
there is a lurking suspicion among
many of the delegates that if the op
portunity is afforded he will endeavor
to secure the gubernatorial plum for
M. M. Estee. The admirers of Estee
say that he is not in the fight, but when
asked If their favorite would decline
the nomination if it fell in his political
bark yard they look wise and say noth
ing.
Estee is not a candidate in the sense
that he is making an open fight, but
there is no doubt that should the politi
cal thunderbolt strike him he will re
ceive the blow with bared head and a
pleasant smile. There are not a few
of the delegates who look upon Estee
as a dangerous dark horse. If at any
time in the strategic play Colonel Burns
finds that there is a chance of turning
the tide in the direction of Estee lie
will not lose the oportunity. There are,
however, other forces more potent than
that supposed to be wielded by Burns,
and it is not generally anticipated that
if he is favorable to Estee the final re
sult will be materially affected.
County Clerk Curry of San Francisco
la accompanied by quite a number of
his deputies. Curry is of the opinion
that he can break through the lines and
carry off the nomination for Secretary
of State despite the fact that Jim R?a
and the majority o* the Santa Clara
f]Â» -legation are out in force for Paul P.
Austin.
Rea is willing to trade to secure the
PROSPECTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN.
The Best Men of the Party Will Be in Attendance,
and the Enthusiasm Has Never Been
Equaled. *
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 21.â The prospects for success In the coming cam
paign were never better or brighter. One of the best indications is the in
tense interest taken in the convention by the members of the party. The
enthusiasm displayed by the delegates has not been equaled in years. The
most flattering reports are brought to us from every county. The person
nel of the convention augurs well for success. The best men in the party
are In attendance. This is attributable to the fair primaries and caucuses
held throughout the State; the open fight for Governor and other high
places on the ticket; the absence of "programme"; the importance of the
issues before the people, and the magnificent success of the McKinley ad
ministration together with the unparalleled victories on land and sea of
our boys in blue, in which California's sons have borne sb conspicuous a
part. California will remain in the vanguard of Republican States,
where she was so firmly placed by the victory of 1896.

nomination for Austin, but Curry says
that he is not afraid of any combina
tion that may be made. He is of the
opinion that with the support he vnl
receive from San Francisco he can off
set the Santa Clara delegation and
make an even fight in the country.
RAILROAD OFFICIALS
ON DELEGATES' TRAIN
Many of the Old-Time "Push"
Thought the Company Was
Again Doing Politics.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 21.â The friends of all the
I Republican aspirants for the Governor
i ship who happened to be aboard the cen
! tral overland train bound from San Fran
; Cisco to this city last night, were aston
j lshed to Bee the palatial private car
! "Francisco," belonging to the officers of
: the Southern Pacific, attached to the
'â  train. The political strikers fancied for a
time that the pood old days were to come
againâ that the railroad was to go into
politics once more and make life worth
living.
Inquiry was instituted to ascertain the
meaning of the attachment, and the fact
was brought to light that W. G. Curtis,
engineer of maintenance and way, was
the only high-grade occupant, of the pal
ace on 'wheels, and that he had no sack
nor programme aboard. The old forms
of the corporation it Â«-ems .still survive.
Mr. Curtis is en route to Ogden to meet
and greet the newly appointed United
Stages Commissioner of Railways, the il
lustrious General Longstreet. By some
process of official dispensation the honors
and responsibilities of United States
Commissioners are bestowed on celebrat
ed generals who served in the Confeder
ate army.
These gallant old soldiers are affable
and confiding. General Longstreet's -pre
decessor in the office of the commission
was that illustrious South Carolinan Gen
eral Wade Hampton. His trips to Cali
fornia were delightful excursions, ami he
must recollect with delight the many
happy hours he passed in the private pal
ace cars of the Southern Pacific, with Mr.
Curtis as the host. The monotony of con
tinental travel was relieved by fishing ex,
cursions among mountain streams.
At San Francisco entertainments were
provided. -ac beautiful red room of the
Bohemian Club was decorated to the owl' 3
taste. Whenever Curtis gave a banquet
to General Hampton the rarest of wines,
the choicest of blossoms and the sweetest
of music made the feast enchanting. The
hard work. too. of preparing the official
report of the United States Commissioner
was performed fn urtis' office by the
obliging attaches of the corporation, so
that the representative of the Federal
Government had notning to do but sign
the report.
The same old style of doing things is to
be put up for General Longstreet's enter

Curtis' abilities as host have not been

PARDEE MEN SEEK
TO START A STAMPEDE
Circulate the Beport that Gage's
Strength in the South Is Fast
Slipping Away From Him.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 21.â At midnight to-night
Dr. Pardee started his runners out to cir
culate the alleged information that the
solid south has been broken, and that
Henry T. Gage's strength was fast slip
ping away.
It was asserted that San Diego and Or
ange counfcs had deserted the banner of
their favorite son, and that other counties
would follow. An investigation proves
that the report was manufactxired out of
whole cloth, and was being circulated for
the purpose of creating the impression
that Pardee had gained a foothold in the
south, an impression that Dr. Pardee
hoped would induce some of the northern
counties to come into his camp.
CONTESTS AMONG DELEGATES.
ThÂ© Committee on Credentials Will
Have Many Disputes to Adjust
Before tlie Convention.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 21.â When the committee
on credentials meets there will be a hotly
contested fight for the seat as delegate
at large from Nevada County. Nat P.
Brown, eaitor of the Nevada Transcript,
and J. Kidder, Debris Commissioner, will
be the contestants. Brown was elected
by the County Central Committee, and
Kidder was elected at a primary.
Kidder now contends that under the
call of the State Central Committee he is
entitled to the seat, and If his fight prove?
successful there will be trouble as to the
seating of the other delegates who re

THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 1898.
THE CALL'S REPORT
OF THE CONVENTIONS
The Republicans of California will convene at Sacramento to-morrow for the purpose
of nominating the men who will be elected to fill the various State offices next fall. Last week
the Democrats met to ratify the action of the Populists at an earlier convention. Recogniz
ing the fact that the people of the State are deeply interested ii the political conditions of the
day, The Call spared no effort to place before its readers the me st complete, record of the
Democratic meeting obtainable. With a staff of writers, artists and newsgatherers superior
to that of any other newspaper in the West, The Call has on all occasions shown itself to be
the leading journal of the coast, and in pursuance of its usual policy of giving all the news
all the time, it presented not only an unequaled synopsis of the proceedings but also gave
the first verbatim report of a political convention that has ever been published in Califor
nia. With a network of telephone and telegraph wires leading directly from the conven
tion hall in Sacramento to The Call office in San Francisco, the news was gathered, while
with special fast trains the papers carrying this news were laid down on the breakfast tables
of those who had made history for their party during the previous day.
Having no axes to grind, no ambition to serve, no injuries to avenge. The Call
was the only paper that gave a complete and unbiased account of the Democratic Conven
tion. Having no candidates except those of the Republican party, no desire except the
success of that party and no political interests to serve but those of its party, The Call
will this week in its report of the convention surpass that of last week, having strength
ened its service in all points and being better prepared for the task it has set for itself and
from which all other papers shrink.
The Call promises to its readers this week the most complete story of a convention
ever presented by any newspaper on the Pacific Coast, giving not only a stenographic re
port of every word uttered in the proceedings, but also such concise and graphic resumes
as will place the whole to the mind as a picture before the eye. The best artists in the
West will depict the scenes, trained writers will tell the story, unexcelled wire service will
carry the report to San Francisco and matchless trains will speed forth in the early morn
ing hours taking to the people such a compendium of news as is only possible in a news
paper that has the facilities possessed by The Call.
THE NORTH SHOULD HAVE AN OFFICE
T. H, Selvage Believes the Voters About Siskiyou
Should Have Representation.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 21.â r or the last eight years there has been no
candidate from Northern California on the Republican ticket. The people
of the north think at this time they should have representation upon the
ticket. The northern counties will unite in their support of my candidacy
for the office of Lieutenant Governor.
The probabilities are that nearly all of the nominees will come from the
middle and southern portion of the State. This we gladly accord them,
but we think we should have some little representation from the north,
especially as Humboldt County at the last election turned out 650 ma
jority for McKlnley, when the State was very much in need of Republi
can votes. It may be that the convention will not see fit to grant* us our
wish, and, if It fall to do so, wo will make no complaint. We will simply
acquiesce in the action of the convention, but there Is one right we will
not surrender, and that is the right to turn out a first-class Republican
majority to the ticket which is nominated by the middle and southern
portion of the State. T. H. SELVAGE.
mittee will also be called upon to settle
the fight in Santa Clara County. The
good government people will oppose the
seating of the Jim Rea delegation, and
will urge that they should not be recog
nized, as the primary was carried by re
peating and ballot box stuffing.

THE DOCTOR
How Alameda Intends
to Prove Unity.
EXODUS TO THE CAPITAL
POOR, INDEED, MUST BE THE
MAN WHO REMAINS.
John A. Jo :es Issues a Couple of
Documents That Do Justice to
a Follower of Ma
guire.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, OAKLAND,
Aug. 21.â 0n the eve of the great Repub
lican battle Alameda County is a unit for
the man woo won such an overwhelming
victory at the primaries over a week ago.
Had this spirit of unanimity been mani
fested to the State three months ago that
which is now doubtful might have been a
certainty. Should Dr. Pardee fail of nomi
nation it cannot be denied that such a
misfortune would be entirely due to the
protracted and bitter contest that has
been waged for nearly a year between the
two Alameda County men who desired to
head the Republican ticket. Much regret
is now being expressed that the contest
did not end earlier than the primary.
As a matter of fact, it could only have
ended by the withdrawal of either of the
men. But each had gone into it with a
large and influential body of supporters,
to whom they had pledged that there
should be no backing down and that if the
right did not end at the primary it should
not be abandoned until the voice of the
convention was heard at Sacramento.
Under this disadvantageous load, Ala
meda County struggled along-, demanding
the nomination for Governor, but being
unable to place before the State the name
of the man to whom the honor should be
awarded. Eight days have elapsed since
it was determined that Alameda County
was nearly unanimous for Dr. Pardee,
and during those eight days the doctor's
workers have done heroic service in his
cause It is, however, an enormous task
to undo in such a short time the work
of as many months. The Pardee men are
as confident as ever and the doctor's faith
in his own campaign has not swerved a
particle. Siace he rirst proclaimed his de
sire to be nominated for Governor he has
attended personally to his own campaign, j
It is true that he has had a hundred activÂ©
and loyal lieutenants, but he has directed
their efforts and has left nothing to any
one else that he thought he could do bet
ter for himself. The result of the prim
ary shows that he is an active fighter and
a "successful campaigner, and had there
been no one else in the race from this
county a vastly different complexion
would now be worn by the great contest
to be decided at the capital next week.
There will be no lack of Alameda lung
power at the State Convention. During
the past week about one-half of the doc
tor's efforts have been engaged in making
new friends in San Francisco and the
other half in organizing his following of
workers on this side the ba-, so that thj>y
can render the best possible service at
Sacramento. Mayor Thomas said a few
nights ago that he would lead a little
company on his own account, and his ex
ample is to be followed by many others.
The Mayor knows something of politics,
and in addressing the Republican League
narrated a portion of a conversation that
he had with a San Francisco delegate.
The Mayor told how the south would
stand together and yell for Gage; how
San Francisco's vast delegation would
vote for every fly-by-night candidate for
the first few ballots and how Alameda
and other counties would roar for Pardee.
He prophesied that this would be main
tained for some time on the floor of the
convention, and that the least split in
either faction would be fatal. The Mayor
then in solemn tones assured the League
that "the little boss" from San Francisco
would raise his finger and the. horde from
the metropolis would swing their votes
in line and Alameda County, if she wa
vered, would be left. This is the spirit
that seems to pervade the Alameda dele
gation. They will stand pat and yell for
Pardee, as well as vote for him, and un
less present plans are changed they will
vote for no other candidate for Governor
so long as they are in the convention.
There is some doubt as to whether Ala
meda is likely to win or lose a point by
having her name at the head of the list
of counties. It is argued by some that
with her large delegation committee*! to
Pardee at the very outset of taking the
vote, and with Los Angeles also having
voted before San Francisco is reached,
a computation can be made before
the metropolis announces her choice that
will enable it to pick the winner. Should
Alameda be the last to be called the bal
ance of power might be kept in doubt and
decided by its vote. One Alameda County
editor has suggested that the committee
on order of business at Sacramento re
port in favor of a plan by which the
names of the counties be put into a ballot
box and that their respective votes be ta
ken as the names come from the box. It
Is hardly likely, however, that this in
genious Innovation will be adopted.
There are no factional lines in the
crowd that will leave Alameda County
to-day and to-morrow and Tuesday for
the seat of war. Hilborn men, Davis men,
Metcalf men will fall in line with the Par
dee men. and all will try their hardest to
bring home the coveted nomination. Many
of the Pardee Clubs, a large delegation
from the Young Men's Republican
League, a coterie of the Pondink
ies, probably every Republican of
fice-holder, certainly an army of
candidates for county and legis
lative offices, and most assuredly, wheth
er invited or not, a fair representation of
the "push" will be included in the exodus.
If lungs can win. George Pardee will be
the next Governor of California.
As soon as Victor Metcalf saw the
practical end of his own campaign yes
terday, he started in to work for the doc
tor, and with him are Associated all of
that powerful element and or
ganization that caused Mr. Metcalf to
win such a pronounced victory over Mr.
Hilborn last Wednesday. It rtiay alnmxt
be prophesied with a reasonable prospect
of fulfillment tnat if any Republic.! mm
other than a few police officers are In Ai
ameda County next Wednesday mornitiK,
it will be because the fare to Sacramento
is beyond their means, or because no
good Samaritan has offered them a freÂ«
pasteboard.
Some of Dr. Pardee's f deads during the
past week have been arguing on the pÂ«.
culiar ground as to whether a po
candidate is helped more by his f
than by his honest opponents. Had r>
Pardee met with no opposition since he
announced himself as a candidate, and
had everybody oiled the wheels of bin
campaign chariot it would have slipped
through Alameda County so smoothly
and noiselessly that many would have
been unaware of its passage. But those
who differed from the doctor and f-orn
something he had said and done came
to the front, voiced their sentiments in
no uncertain tones and gavr- t nf . oppor
tunity that was most needed. Th<
tor wanted no other excuse to launch
out and broaden his campaign. From
Alameda the State took a hand in the
interest attaching to the controversy.
and in a short time every one knew that
there was in Alameda County a candi
date named George Pardee, and conse
quently all the State was led to lnok
for the result of the great contest. When
it was over the name of Pardee was
known from the borders of Oregon to
the Gulf of Mexico.
John Aubrey Jones, whom I do not
think will fill the seat In Congress re
cently vacated by Mr. Hilborn, has a
very short-lived memory. Althfiuph Mr.
Jones is a very affable citizen, he is f>n
tirely new to nearly everybody in the
district. His politics, according to his
frequent communications to the news
papers, is a mixture of Silver Republican
ism, Populism, Democracy, Bryanism,
and whatever may be meant by what he
terms "the coalition arrangement made
between duly accredited representatives
of the Democratic party and the People' 3
party at Sacramento on the 13th of July.".
It is nnt, however, Mr. Jones' politics
that interest me just now so much as his
lack of the ordinary method of doing
politics. On August 15th â Just a week
ago â I received a printed circular from
Mr. Jones, in which occur the following
sentences: "I do most respectfully so
licit indorsement of my candidacy by
your district convention. To this end I
ask that you will honor me with your
vote. 1 indorse undeservedly the Chicago
Democratic platform of 1596. I would
an earnest, systematic canvass and
would work hopefully to win. I would
earnestly support all legislation, etc. I
would give diligent attention to securing
appropriations, etc. I would zealously
oppose any attempt to pasÃ. etc. I would
draw some support from the Republi
cans, as I have the assurance of many,
etc. Yours truly. JOHN A. JONES '
In this morning's Call I read the fol
lowing: "It is with profound gratification
that I accept the honors that have been
heaped upon me by my fellow-citizens.
While my oponent has during weeks and
months â¢ â¢ â¢ Â« â¢ j have without
any effort and almost wholly unsolicited
secured two nominations. Dull, insensate
and unappreciative indeed would I be â¢
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ JOHN AUBREY JONES."
Dull, insensate and unappreciative In
deed must be the mind that faf;s to see
the joke in Mr. John Jones' two docu
ments.
The prospect of those who live largely
on "practical politics" is particularly
roseate. They have enjoyed pie for many
months, and the end of the banquet is
not yet in sight. Week after next the
county campaign, which, after all, is
one of the most productive of that which
makes politics, will open. Already a legion
of candidates is arranging slates, pro
grammes and combinations, geographical
and personal. This will last until Novem
ber; then the politicians will only have
to tide over Christmas when the new
year will bring on a full municipal cam
paign with almost the certainty that the
water companies will be "an issue," from
which may issue much that will be grati
fying to those who are neither taxpayers
nor hysterically anxious for political re
form and purity.

The two trains which were In col- !
lision were usually combined into one
â¢long train, but as the traffic to-day was
h-avy it was divided, the first section
running as a local accommodation,
while the second, which started from
Mansfield fifteen minutes later, ran as
an express. The local train, due at
Sharon at 7:02 o'clock, was thirteen
minutes late. It left Mansfield on time,
.making two stops, and had lost the
thirteen minutes between Mansfield and
Fharrm. It was due in Canton Junction,
. the next station beyond Sharon, two
minutes ahead of the express train,
which should have passed it there.
Sharon is situated on a curve and both
the outward and inward tracks are pro

' ' â¢ Every one of the killed and injured

'â¢lily explanation of the fact that the

that the passengers were all in the for

arrived soon sifter the accident and im

about that portion of the track where

were compelled to do their work in al

were on hand.
Quite a number of the patients were
taken in charge, but the greater num

forty square miles of territory have

MANILA, Aug. 21.â The city is quiet.
Banks are now open, and business has
been resumed. Armed rebels are not
allowed in the city. General Merritt
has ordered that all armed rebel forces
retire ten miles from Manila within j
three days. Representatives of A.^ui- i
naldo agreed to these terms yesterday, j
asking on their part for employment j
under the American Government for
the leading rebels, which was granted.
The rebel forces declare that if Angui
naldo orders them to retire they will
refuse and will attack Manila. The re
sult would be disastrous to them, as
Manila is amply protected by 10.000
American troops.
The Custom-house, administration
bureau, postofflce and port are now ad
ministered by American officers. Cus
toms duties on goods detained in the
Custom-house amount to 2.000,000 Mex
ican dollars. The treasury which has
been handed over to General Merritt,
contains a large amount.
Aguinaldo has sent rebel troops to
j attack Iloilo, and has dispatched
I agents to induce the southern islands
to rebel. In Iloilo there are 4000 troops.
Sergeant Burns of the Thirteenth

received in the final assault on the city.

have died from typhoid fever. All the !
wounded are doing well, and will re

Major Reeve has been appointed

OUR LOSSES AT MANILA.
Forty-Six Killed and One Hundred
Wounded.
HONGKONG, Aug. 21.â Officers of the
steamer China from Manila, which has
arrived here, report that it was evident i
that the resistance of the Spaniards !
when Manila was attacked by the j
Americans was merely nominal and ;
was made solely Ur maintain the honor :
of Spain. The officers talked with ex- ;
press the belief that the escape of j
Governor General Augusti was pre
arranged and was well understood by
Admiral Dewey.
A dispatch from Manila, dated Au
gust 18, says the total number of killed
on the American side during the attack
upon and capture of Manila was forty
six and the wo-unded about 100. The
Spanish losses were about 200 killed
and 400 wounded. The fire of the
Americans did practically no damage
to the town nor to the non-combatants.
The Americans haa considerable diffi
culty in keeping the insurgents out of
the city, only admitting those who- were
without weapons.
Five Insurgents were shot while loot
ing at Tondo. An insurgent officer be
came involved in a quarrel with a Span
iard in the Escolta, in the Binondo sub
urb, during which the Spaniard lired
upon the insurgent, inflicting wounds
in the latter's legs. The Spaniard was
arrested and imprisoned.
General Merritt has issued a procla
mation decreeing that the provisional
Government and the local authorities
shall retain their offices and that every
thing shall remain unchanged for the
present, except su far as the supreme
jurisdiction is concerned. The procla
mation further declares that any na
tive who resists the present authorities
shall be treated as a lawbreaker.
General Jaudenes, in the course of an
interview had with him by the repre
sentative of the Associated Press, said
he knew the fight was a hopeless one,
but that he intended to resist the Amer
icans in the name of honor, but was
persuaded to surrender for the sake of
the non-combatants. He eulogized the
Americans for the humanity they have
shown.
The last official act of General Jau
denes was to fine a Journalist for speak
ing the truth. The journalist requested
the correspondent to state that he had
loyally done his best for the country.
He had thrice been punished, had
fought bravely as a volunteer, had been
captured and released, and, further,
was ready to fight again, but was "ut
terly disgusted with a Government and
a nation which tolerates and welcomes
the Americans."
Serious trouble is threatened by the
insurgents because they were prevented
from having their own way. They as
sert that they are able to render the
islands untenable for anybody.

ONLY THE CITY SURRENDERED
BELIEF THAT THT ARCHIPEL

Merritt's Cablegram Throve No Light
on the Construction He Places
Upon the Terms of Capit
ulation.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.â Among the
war officials the terms of the capitu
lation of Manila, as cabled by General
Merritt, were a topic of discussion. No
light has been thrown upon the terms
by General Merritt. He cabled the
terms themselves, expecting probably
to forward by mail the construction
placed upon them by the American and
Spanish officers at Manila.
Unofficial advices from Manila re
i reived previous to the arrival of the
text of the terms indicated that the
capitulation of the city included the
.surrender of the Philippines, and that
Spanish sovereignty over the entire
archipelago was,' temporarily at least,
at an end. " This view is not sustained
Rthe conditions of the surrender as
led by General Merritt; and, it may
said, it is not the view taken by the
t informed officials of the admlnis
tion. While some of the war au
thorities last night were inclined to the
opinion that the articles of capitula
i tion, necessarily and naturally some
i what elastic in their phraseology,
! might be construed to mean the sur.
: render of Spanish control over the en
tire Philippines group, the prevalent
opinion now is that they mefn precise
ly what they say, and that the sur
render includes only the city of Ma
nila and its immediate surroundings,
or suburbs, as it is expressed in the
articles.
It can be said authoritatively the
President is quite satisfied with the
terms as made by General Merritt and
Admiral Dewey. Their instructions af
forded them considerable latitude for
individuality of action, the President
feeling confident that they would se
cure the best possible terms in the
circumstances. That they have done
6O he is certain.
It is pointed out that the terms of
the capitulation of Manila can have
but little effect upon the action of the
Paris peace commission, in any event.
The protocol as signed by the accred
ited representatives of the governments
of the United States and Spain pro
vides for the cession of the city, bay
| and harbor of Manila to the United
States, and leaves it to the peace com
â  mission to determine the disposition
< and government of the Philippine Is
lands.
Whether, therefore, Spain is to re
; tain her sovereignty over the islands
is a question to be decided by the
! Paris commission. The action of the
: commission is circumscribed by the
! provisions of the protocol, while the
terms of the capitulation of Manila,
it is suggested, can have very little
more serious effect upon the commis
sion'fl work than those of the surrender

SWITCHING YARD
II THE STREETS
Southern Pacific Impo
sition at San Jose.
OUTGROWTH OF GANG RULE
CONSTANT MENACE TO LIVES
OF TRAVELERS.
Two of the Principal Thoroughfares
of the City Recklessly En
croached Upon by the
Monopoly.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 21.â As a result of
being in the toils of a corrupt political
gang San Jose is being imposed upon
by the Southern Pacific monopoly. Two
of the principal streets â First and San
Pedro â are being used as a switching
yard at the broad jjauge depot. This is
a detriment to tho city. It decreases
the value of property in that vicinity,
besides being a menace to travelers.
Teams are frequently frightened, and
hardly a day passes but some serious
accident is not narrowly averted.
North First street is one of the finest
thoroughfares in the city. The same
can be said of North San Pedro street.
Both lead to the center of town and are
the thoroughfares of much travel. Be
tween Julian and Washington the
Southern Pacific Railroad crosses the
streets. Trains on the coast division
and Niles route cross these streets
many times a day. But not satisfied
with this, the railroad company
switches cars across these driveways
all day long. A flagman is provided,
but even then there is danger from the
continual switching. The street is
blocked by teams waiting to cross, and
First and San Pedro streets are virtu
ally pre-empted for railroad yards.
North First street contains some of
the finest residences in the city, and but
a block beyond the railroad crossing is
the Hotel Vendome. The hostelry is
filled by guests from all over the United
States, and that the city's main thor
oughfare should remain in such a con
dition is a disgrace to the municipality.
People living in the neighborhood have
protested time and again against the
condition of the streets, but the City
Council has never done anything.
Public opinion is unanimous that the
Southern Pacific Company should be
compelled to remove its freight yards.
It owns ample ground a mile from the
city, in the Polhemus tract, that is suit
able for railroad purposes. Prom time!
t<> time it has been reported that the '
freight business of the company would j
be removed there, but the indifference j
of gang-controlled City Councils has |
allowed the railroad imposition to con
tinue unmolested.
Some time ago the Bnard of Trade
took up the matter. It was discussed
and a committee appointed to wait
upon the company, but that was all
that was done.
The manner In which the street is
used is condemned by the entire city,
but in its gang-ridden condition San
Jose seems powerless to resist this en
croachment of the Southern Pacific.
NATIONAL SENTIMENT
FAVORS EXPANSION
President McKinley Deluged With
Letters Urging Retention of
the Philippines.
NEW YORK, Aug. 21.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Secretary Alger was much interested
this morning as to the contention in
different quarters as to whether the ca
pitulation had included the Philippines.
A very prominent and observant official
said to-night that if the word "su
burbs" mentioned in the terms of
agreement was translated back into
Spanish a clearer idea might be
formed. He was conversant with the
fact that the Spanish word was pliant
and many-sided and more may have
been meant by what was translated
into "suburbs" than is contemplated by
our term "suburb." And yet other
opinion here opposes the suggestion
that the agreement was received with
General Merritt's perfect knowledge of
the word "suburbs," and that, there
fore, the claim that the Philippines
were meant is out of the question.
President McKinley and his Cabinet
are being made aware of the fact that
the sentiment of the country is strong
ly in favor of holding all of the Phil
ippines. Each day the mail brings to
the President and to each member of
the Cabinet many letters from all over
the country. Even before the capture
of Manila by Admiral Dewey and Gen
eral Merritt a great majority of the
writers of these letters urged that all
the islands should be held. Since that
victory the proportion of the writers

PBOMISES MADE BY A FRENCH
COMTANY.
Sought in Every Possible Way to

Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Aug. 10.â As far back
as February 11 The Call published In
this correspondence an item in refer
ence to a proposition for a French
trans-Pacific cable connecting with
Tahiti and Honolulu, which created a
sensation in the United States and
Europe and received the honor of an
equivocal contradiction from persons
interested in suppressing the informa
tion on behalf of rival schemes then
practically pending before the Govern
ments of Hawaii and America.
In the throes of the dissolution of the
Hawaiian republic and the personal
unpleasantness thereby engendered, the
true secret has reluctantly oozed out
in sjijte o.f the secretive manner in
; whi.-h It has been handled by the rnori
j bund Cabinet.
It appears, from reliable authority,
that The Call was correct in its state
ment. The French warship Duguay
Trouln at the same time that it brought
the proposition for making Honolulu a
port of call for the steam is <>f the
Messageries Imperiales Line brought
a request to the Hawaiian Government
that no special or exclusive franchise
be granted to any trans-Pacific cable
company until a proposition fur a
French cable connection with Tahiti
had been fully considered by the Ha
waii;: n Government, even although the
United States Government had to be
first considered in any negotiation for
landing a foreign cable on Hawaiian
shores.
Upon three subsequent occasions did
the representative of the French Gov
ernment and the prompters appear be
fore the Executive Council and plead
his cause and strenuously oppose the
granting of any exclusive franchise to
any Hawaiian, American or foreign,
company. It was this opposition that
induced a section of the Cabinet and
its supporters to make so strenuous a
fight in the Legislature against the ex
clusive franchise of the Pacific (Scrym
ser) cable bill, which subsequently
won its fight in so extraordinary and
mysterious a manner as to compel ad
miration of the ability which en
gineered it and comment on the sudden
docility with which votes flocked to it.
If I am correctly informed, there will
not be found among the archives of the
Government of the republic of Hawaii
a single line of documentary evidence
in the way of contracts, letters or even
pieces of conversations to mark this in
teresting episode of the cable fight; but
this is not surprising w^en the se
cretive sympathies in the transaction of
public affairs by the Gevehmgericht of #
Hawaii become more fully appreciated.'
as they will be in course of time when
tongues become loosened in discussing
reminiscences. It is even now intimat
ed "on the dead quiet" that Franca
stood ready to tender diplomatic as
sistance in aid of the preservation of
Hawaiian independence had the slight
est approach to an entente cordiale
been made. If this be so, then one can
appreciate more fully the policy that
brought, upon more than one occasion
during the annexation campaign, firm
but delicate pressure upon the United
States with threats of looking else
where for political alliances, and the
motive which actuated the annexation
correspondents most closely allied with
the syndicates in suggesting that un
less the United States took Hawaii
some other nation would.
It also explains that lingering hope,
which even now, on the very eve of the
consummation of the marriage between
the greater and the lessor republic, still
â  tni-frozen breasts of the
uians â that rescue and restoration
of the national honor will yet arrive
from Europe. Unfortunately, perhaps,
no arguments on the. futility of the
hope can for the present prevail against
that deep-rooted sentiment of the pr-o
v.ho conscientiously oppose an
nexation. They will drift down the tide
of time like the Legitimists of Europe,
whose thrones know them no longer as
occupiers, but merely as transient
ghosts of dimly remembered grandeur.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 1893.
FULL PROTECTION
FOR CATHOLICS
Archbishop Ireland Is
Highly Pleased.
ASSURED BY THE PRESIDENT
NO TROUBLE ABOUT OUR NEW
POSSESSIONS.
Church Interests, His Grace Says,
Will Hiourjsh Better Under
Our Flag Than Ever
Before.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.â Archbishop
Ireland, who has been in the city for
several days, left to-night. During his
stay he has had several conferences
with President McKinley, with whom
his relations are of the most cordial
character. The Archbishop has declined
to discuss the significance of his calls
upcn the President, but it has been gen
erally understood that he was acting
in the Interest of the Cathcrlic church
for its protection in our new posses
sions. Archbishop Ireland dismisses as
without foundation the statements that
church matters are liable to cause dis
sensions. To the Associated Pre3s to
night he made the statement which fol
lows:
, "The church question in our new pcs- I
sessions offers no difficulty whatever. .
Two principles are already settled by
the constitution and laws of America:
There will be no union of church and :
state, such as !â¢> established by custom
or concord in certain Catholic countries
of Europe, but there will be complete
protection of all properties and of all
persons.
â With such principles Catholics in the
United States are satisfied, and Catho
lics in our jiew possessions will be sat
isfied. The so-called church question
need not be considered by military or
peace commissions. It is fully regu
lated the moment the nag of this coun
try is raised over a territory. The peo
ple of our new possessions understand,
I am sure, this matter very well and
will loyally accept the situation. It
may not be very easy for them at first
to adapt themselves in all cases to this
situation, but the embarrassments felt
will be temporary.
"The people will soon realize that It
is their duty to support religion by ;
voluntary and personal contributions. ;
In the greater number of parishes, <
moreover, church properties yield :
| ample revenue to meet all expenses.
The church everywhere in our new cos- j
sessions is thoroughly organized: it
wears no missionary or experimental
aspect, but has the full form and the
full 'strength of complete organization
â  and is well prepared to care for all her !
j interests without the help of state or !
! charitable aid. It demands no favor,
no privilege â naught but liberty and
i the legal protection of the natural and ,
civil rights of its members.
"Certain people who talk of these ter
ritories as fields for missionary efforts
â¢ from the United States do not know
what they are talking about. They !
might with as much sense organize
j missions for the conversion of the j
' Catholics of Santiago, Havana or San i
i Juan â and their labors would have as |
much prospect of Buccess in Washing
ton as in those cities of Cuba and '
Pojrto Rico. The separation of the !
countries of South America from Sbain
and Portugal brought no change of re- \
ligion, nor will the separation of Cuba I
and Porto Rico from Spain bring any.
! Indeed, the Catholic church will flour- ]
'. ish better in Cuba and Porto Rico than
| in other territories formerly colonies of ',
' Spain, because in Cuba and Porto Rico j
| there will be the liberty and stability
I of order which our flag guarantees.
"Cuba and Porto Rico form an ec
j clesiastical province, with the Arch
1 bishop of Santiago as metropolitan and
: suffragan Bishop of San Juan and Ha
i vana. This province will take its place
| in the American heirarchy, just as does
! the province of Baltimore or that of St.
I Paul, making the fifteenth eccleslaa
| tical province in the United States, and
| bringing to our Catholic population an
addition of two and a half millions, nnt
to talk of islands in the Pacific; so,
I whatever else will come to America
from the late war, considerable in- j
i crease of numbers and power will rome
jto the Catholic church. As a Catholic
; I am very much satisfied with the way
things have been going â and as an
\:>vrican, I am, of course, thoroughly
satisfied. P.ut if I were to speak at
' length of my feelings as an American. |
I the interview would be too lengthy and I
I I stop at the religious feature of the
| situation."

DAWSON CITY, N. W. T., Aug. 6.â
By order of Major Walsh a census of
the city of Dawson was taken last
Wednesday and 16,000 souls were count
ed within the town boundaries on that
day. The work was done by the
northwest mounted police, the city
being divided up into small districts
and the count was completed within
a few hours, so that, despite the un
settled condition of things, the fact
that four-fifths of the inhabitants live
in tents and nearly that proportion are
camped in such confusion as might be
expected to attend a stampede or the
retreat of a beaten army, it is believed
to be very close to the actual number
of people here. Five thousand more
are camped at the mouth of the Stew
art River, a few hours by the river
current from Dawson. Other thou
sands are camped at Little and Big
Salmon and the Pelly rivers.
I have been here a few more days
than six weeks and the scene
of this big bivouac remains un
changed. Thousands have gone
out, but other thousands have
taken their places. Building is going
on at a tremendous rate, but in pro
portion to the number of people who, if
they remain here, are yet to be housed,
it is nothing at all. The days are
shortening very rapidly. The long,
cold and dark winter is rapidly ap
proaching and still this big crowd sits
as in a trance, waiting for the L.ord
knows what. Eve,ry up-river boat
carries away as many as its decks will
hold, the passengers being stowed away
in any old way, fur the live days' trip,
there being no room for b-.'ds. The
earlier down-river boats are crowded,
but since the demonstration of the
practicability of the up-river route,
which is so much shorter, must of those
hurrying homeward go that way.
There are three small boats plying
from here up the river. They run
from here to White Horse Kapids,
where they connect (with a portage to
above the canyon) with boats to Ben
nett. They make the round trip in
about ten days. Their beat efforts
from now until the river closes will
scarcely make an impression on the
camp, although they will be more and
more crowded as the margin of the
summer nakrows. Nine-tenths of this
big crowd that is camped and idling
here does not know. what it is going to
do. Being asked they will plainly tell
you so. They came into this faraway,
isolated country with vaerue notions of
what they were to do and how they
were to do it when they, got here; ar
rived and face to face with the hard
conditions and the tremendous strug
gle for fortune that is going on here,
their uncertain plans are dissipated
and they sit in their tents and cook
their meals and sleep, drawing their
blankets a little closer about them as
the night grow colder and wait and
wait.
With the first fleck of snow, less
than six weeks hence, there will
probably be another such sailing of the
great flotilla as took place at Bennett
and La Barge less than six weeks ago.
The destination this time will be St.
Michael. But it takes money to get
"back to the States," even from St.
Michael, ani a great proportion of this
crowd lacks the required amount. Out
fits are being sold in every direction,
auction sales are in progress in al
must every block, afternoon and even
ing, and the prices of the great mass
of stuff that is sold is little if any above
that at which it was purchased away
back in some city of the States, and
the dragging of it over that terrible
"summit," over mountains and lakes
and rivers and through freight and
customs offices goes for nothing. This
sacrifice will go on and increase until
the time limit for getting out is
passed. ; /i â 
The price of certain provisions re
mains high, these being scarce and
especially desirable here, such as on
ions, potatoes and vegetables, that may
be obtained fresh. , Onions readily sell
at $1 a pound and potatoes at 50 cents.
Beef was offered to-day at 60 cents, it
having fallen from $1. The run of
salmon has begun and although the fish
are not in the finest ' condition after
their swim of 2000 miles from the sea,
they sold readily for $1 50 a pound at
first, but have since been bought at 25
cents. The price of meals at restau
rants is still kept up to Jl5O and $2 50.
A meal may be had for $1, but it is
scant and of a quality below that
served for. 5 cents in San Francisco. .
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Bella has made the run to St.
Michael and return and brings little en
couraging news, concerning the new
boats upon which so many have under
taken to reach Dawson this summer. It
is reported that there are twenty-two
boats in various stages of construction
at and near St. Michael, and that some
twenty others are being built at Dutch
Harbor or Unalaska. Some of the com
panies operating these boats are mak
ing big preparations here to do busi
ness through them, but they do not
come. The Empire Line and the Alaska
Exploration Company are both building
big warehouses, but the boats that were
relied upon to bring the goods to store
in them are not even reported in the
river. Very many plans that were based
upon the arrival of these boats have
already gone to smash and It is freely
predicted that very many of the boats
will be unable to get their passengers
up the river, and that the experiences
of last winter, suffered by the passen
gers of the Hamilton, Seattle No. 1.
Merwin, Governor Stoneman, Hettie B,
the Dwyer and others, will be suffered
again by very many mare this winter.
It is almost a fixed superstition of the
river that no boat can make the ascent
above the flats from St. Michael at its
first attempt. But four boats have done
so this summer, demonstrating the ab
surdity of. that saying. Two of them,
the Monarch and the Sovereign, Â be
longed to a company wholly new on the
river, the Columbia : . Navigation Com
pany, and the boats were In charge of
men who had never seen it before.
White men were in the pilot-houses.
Thus were destroyed at once all the set
tled beliefs of the river concerning the
navigation of this treacherous stream,
for it has long. been 5 held that only the
Indian who had grown familiar through
a life upon it could be trusted to pilot
a boat : through 5 its 1 shifting: ? channels.
It was shown that all that was neces
sary was tc be ready to take the water
while it was high enough and to put
competent boatmen in charge. The fail
ure to do- this by the men ,who have
enticed passengers to sail with them
by false statements and accepted
freight which they will be unable to
deliver will result in great suffering and
disaster and no doubt develop another
big cloud of damage suits next year.
The Seattle No. 3, which is long over
due, is not reported anywhere in the
river, and the eighteen tons of United
States mail which is in her care, or the
care of the company, is causing great
anxiety and disgust because of its non
arrival.
On the little steamer Flora of the
Bennett .Lake and Klondike Navigation
Company, which leaves for White Horse
Rapids to-night, Major Walsh, Com
missioner to the Northwest Territory,
is a passenger. He is the highest offi
cial in the Territory, and, going to Ot
tawa, he will make his report and re
tire from the service. Major Walsh has
profound faith in the great richness of
the Territoryâ believes it to be the rich
est camp in the world. He says that he
will urge upon Parliament the imme
diate betterment of many of the con
ditions here. The waterway will be
cleared, he says, of the rocks that have
caused so many wrecks at White Horse
and in Thirty-mile rivers. He thinks
a telegraph line will connect Dawson
with the rest of the world before an
other year, and that po-lice posts at in
tervals of thirty miles will make it a
comparatively easy matter to travel be
tween the "out" and "inside" this win
ter. He believes the camp is a fixture
for many years. The departure of Ma
jor Walsh is very generally regretted.
Before leaving the major commissioned
D. W. Davis, Dr. Richardson, Captain
of Police Sterns, Captain lilies and Pro
secuting Attorney Wade to serve as a
town committee, with full powers.
The Anglian, a small steamer of the
Canadian Development Company, ar

LIVING SKELETONS
CARRIED ABOARD
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Aug. 9.âTo
ri;: y the first of our Spanish prisoners
were put on board the transport we
hay* hired to take them home. Ten
thousand of the men have been in
camp for more than three weeks, just
outside the city limits. They were
much nearer to the palace than our
own men. They were our prisoners and
we, one and all, avoided the roads that
led' near their camps because of the vile
odors that arose therefrom.
To-day, as the Spaniards passed
through* the city on the way to ihe
docks, we saw sights that brought
tears to the eyes of men who are not
readily moved to tears. Down on the
clocks, in the narrow stiiu of shade at
a warehouse, some 200 Spaniards
waited orders to move on to the lighter
which would convey them to thy mucn
talked-of Spanish hospital ship Ali
cante. These men were of a sickly pal
lo- hollow-cheeked, weak and thin.
"We are the men who haw brought
the sick into the town on litters," they
explained.
Down on the wharf, being loaded on
the steam lighter Bessie, we~e long
lines of stretchers, each with its pitl.tl
burdenâ faces that looked like death's
heads, every line of the skull marked
on the yellow skin, protruding- teeth
over which lips would not close. One
man grasped, in a claw that had crush
ed them, three American hardtacks.
Others had food hidden under their
Bcant covering. Their weight was as
nothing, yet four well men staggered
under the burden of one stretched
Down the city streets came other
processions of stretchers. Vanquished
und sick, moaning, staggering, they
drifted into the town ill day long.
When the city surrendered the pros
pective return to Spain brought joy to
many hearts. The fulfillment of the
promise was sad.
The American ambulances have been
detailed to help carry those unable to
walk, and we have erected tents on the
docks where the sick can wait until the
lighter is ready for them.
"It was not a camp out there," said a
Spanish officer, "it was a graveyard.
Between two and three hundred" went
into the hospital daily. It was not a
hospital â there were no medicines, there
was no attendance. Forty men were
dying every day, and the trenches are
full of the dead. We have saved you
many a $20 for passage money to
Spain. There are 9000 out there yet â
nnly a thousand came in to-day â but
thiy won't last long. Dysentery â camp
dysentery we call it. and it 's worse
than the plague â is carrying them off."
A white-haired officer, with stars and
bands on his sleeves, but so thin and
weak and pale that he looked more like
a skeleton than a man, walked down
the wharf, supported by his wife, who
was as much in need of support as he
was himself. Over a loose board they
both trippod and fell. There are two
young children in the party who cry
almost continuously. Finally they all
got on board, the women to spend ten
clays on a filthy, horrible troop ship.
There are many women going thus,
wives of officers, who cannot pay for
a passage.
These Spanish troop ships bid fair to
rival old-timo slave ships in the mis
ery and sufferings that will be con
fined within their sides on the voyage
back to Spain.
Our own soldiers were sick, but the
conditions of th.c Spaniards are many
times worse than those of our men,
who seem strong and heaithy compared
with thorn. The Spaniards were not
in this condition when they moved to
their death camp just three weeks ago.
Just how far we are expected to pro
vide care for a vanquished foe is a
question now being discussed in this
town. Kvery one admits and has ad
mitted that the Spaniard has been a
good enemy, a good fighter, and the
Americans who took off their hats to
the Spanish on the 17th of July did so
with true homage to brave men. As
the pitiful lines of Spanish prisoners
stagger through the streets of the city
for the next week or so, feebly step
ping out of the way of -edestrians.

In sad contrast to our strong men in
brown, the American? who see them
will be inclined to again uncover their
heads, prompted by the same feeling of
homage to brave men.

Talks of the Motive Which Prompted

to Win the Amer

Special Dispatch to The Call.
QUEBEC, Aug. 21.â Hon. Charles
Russell, the son of Lord Russell of
Killowen, is here, the bearer of a chal
lenge from Ireland to all yachtsmen in
America for the America's cup. Mr.
Russell arrived in Quebec on Friday
and is the guest of Solicitor General
Charles Fltzpatrick. He will leave to
morrow for New York, where he will
be the guest of Bourke Cockran. The
challenger is confident the details of
the race will be speedily arranged. To
the Associated Press representative he
said:
"The desire to challenge for the cup
Is not a new idea with Sir Thomas
Lipton. Twelve years ago he made
the proposition to the Cork Yacht Club
to challenge with an Irish yacht, but
at the time there were difficulties in
the way and the contest was not
brought about."
"Does Sir Thomas intend to put his
own yacht into the proposed contest?"
Mr,. Russell was asked.
"No," he said. "Sir Thomas does
not own a racing yacht at the present
time, but he has always taken a lively
interest in yacht racing and is a mem
ber of several yacht clubs. In fact,
he has always been in all forms of
sports."
'What is his motive for issuing the
challenge at this time?"
"Sir Thomas' view is this: England
and Scotland have had repeated oppor
tunities to compete for the trophy and
have failed, but Ireland has had no
chance. He thinks Ireland should no
longer remain the Cinderella of the
family, and, in yachting at any rate,
should take her proper place among
the nations of the earth. The yacht
will be built in Ireland and she is to
be called the Shamrock. Her crew
will be Irish and she is to be built in
the yards of Harland & Y\'olf, Bflfast.
Right Hon. W. J. Pierre, the chief part
ner, is taking the greatest possible in
terest in the matter. His firm is the
builders of the White Star liners."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Aug. 21. â Returning
steamers from Alaska to-day brinar
news of new gold finds and stampedes.
On the Dirigo was George Alexander
of Dungeness, Wash., who has just re
turned by the rivers from the Klon
dike. He says:
"Just before we left rich discovert
were reported from the north fork uf
Forty Mile Creek, on the American
side. On August 2 and 3 a stampede
of fully 500 men left Dawson in small
boats for the new diggings. They were
mostly newcomers, on the verge of
desperation. They welcomed the re
port as a godsend and immediately set
sail for Forty Mile. It is believed that
several thousand men will leave Daw
son for the district that in 1896 was al
most deserted for the Klondike dis
trict." -Â
Passengers on the steamer George W.
Elder bring the news of a new find at
the foot of the glacier on the east fork
of the SXaguay River, about 229 miles
from Skaguay around the trail. A. \Y.
Davis, formerly from San Francisco,
says:
"On August 1 two prospectors named
Noyes and Patchen came into Skaguay
with $1000 in gold of the highest qual
ity, and which, they claimed they took
out in a few days from the east fork
of the river. A stampede immediately
followed among those left in Dyea and
Skaguay."
Mr. Davis states that the most en
couraging reports are received from the
new diggings on Pine ('reek. The day
before he left a miner came into bka
quay with $1400 in gold from the creek.

FUMES DEVASTATE
SHASTA COUNTY
The Mountain Copper Company
Roasts Ore in the Open
at Keswick.
Poisonous Vapor Destroys Forests and
Ruins Orchardsâ Ranchers in
Despair.
SOa_it is only a simple little chemi
â  cal formula, looking quite innocent and
â â *â¢ harmless in print; yet, when let loose
â¢'fey man's agency upon an unsuspecting
â¢ vegetable world it means terrible mis
: chief. This compound, sulphurous acid,
is capable of destroying tree and plant
and shrub, every living thing which
â¢. tfomes in its way. Flowers may not
â¢'. bloom nor fruit ripen within the sphere
V of its dread influence, while the flrs of
â¢'-..{he" forest, which once coated the hill
' side' with beautiful evergreen, sink into
..ugly withered insignificance.
These things the people of Shasta
: County are beginning to find out and
' their indignation grows daily.
:. . Some three years ago a great English
corporation possessed of inexhaustible
- means took possession of a mine which
â  ' -was being worked with but indifferent
" success on the Iron Mountain. The
".ore was wonderfully rich, it contained
not only copper and iron, but also sil
\ r â¢ and gold. But the former pro
. jprietbr's, for lack of proper appliances,
; -had contented themselves with merely
â .â .extracting the two precious metals,
â¢leaving the more valuable copper and
.'lron behind.
..'.:'â¢ The English company, possessed of
. ample capital and every appliance
.'.known to scientific mineralogy, soon
changed all this. Keswick, a little town
' . a few miles north of Redding and some
seven miles from the mine, was select
ed as the site for the smelting works,
and Keewick to-day bears awful testi
mony to the triumph of ruthless capital
ov.er innocent nature. I do not know
..whether Keswick was ever a pretty
- place, or whether it was even a place
at* all before the smelting works came
' there, but to-day it certainly looks as
if the Deity had learned to ignore its
.existence.
â¢ Imagine the hideous newness of a
-mining camp combined with the noisy
â¢tinkling vice of the Barbary Coast.
: Bare unpainted wooden houses and
'â shahties are scattered all over the bar
.'â¢ ren 'hillside without any apparent ar
â ': rangement, for as yet there are more
'! vacant allotments than dwellings in
â :â  the. township. The place centers upon
;-a high v/ooaen fence, which marks the
â  -boundary of the smelting works. Upon
.'.the gate is announced, with true Brit
*â¢ ish: conservatism, the fact that the
: â¢ground within is private property and
â¢'â  that- no trespassers will be permitted.
: .V.B.tJH, .despite the threatening inscrip
â¢ ii'en, the gate stands wide open, and
..anybody who chooses may walk in
: .4hd out.
Â».. ;- Close to the entrance Is a long line
' ' : .p'f" wooden shanties, each of which is
â¢â -..a"-g in mill of. the lowest description.
â¢".Though it is not yet high noon, beery,
â¢' :.Airishaved.men lounge about the side
' ,h'va-lk, and stagger in and out of the
'.dens', holding, after the manner of
â¢'. drunken men, loud and aimless discus-
V. sions upon nothing in particular. The
â  works run day and night, consequent
; ly there are always a number of men
â¢ oft duty, and the saloons are never
V.erhpty. Occasionally, to vary the mo
. â  notony of everlasting beer, there is a
' free fight, and the one doctor, who lives
: . in the only decent hotel the place
.-.â¢.possesses. Just over the way, is called
â¢ : "upon to patch a broken head, or to sew
â¢up an ugly jagged wound caused by
.'a. bo trie. Shooting cases are rare. The
..'.bottle or the knife is the favorite
'.- .-weapon. The pop, pop, pop of a shoot
â¢ i-ng gallery indicates the only form of
â¢'â¢, innocent recreation available, while
.'.farther down the hill, where the com
v party's fence rises to double its usual
"height, is a large wooden building, in
-.''â¢which the scarlet woman holds sway.
-.:-th'e midday sun shines with overpow
â¢eri'ng heat on the unsheltered place.
. .There is not a flower or a green thing
=-. to' be seen; even the firs on the hill
side .hang their withered brown tassels
; In. despair. No form of vegetation can
.-..jgrow in such an accursed spot. Only
. â  man. impelled by need or greed, strives
.'.to drag on a miserable existence there.
â¢ â 'â¢: Though the air is clear, there is a
â¢ 'noticeable smell of sulphur everywhere,
.'. just as if some one had struck a match
under your nose. The residents don't
-.notice it. "This is nothing." said a
.; drled-up looking man. as he tilted his
. -chair back on the veranda. "It's a
â¢dry day. Walt till we get some wet
:.. weather and then you will see the
"fumes settle down on the town like a
.....spall, .and almost choke the life out of
â  you." .
. : .:I 'declined the invitation, for even on
\a- clear hot day there was quite as
.â¢".much sulphur about as was pleasant.
The hill slopes sharply down from the
: .town Into a deep canyon, and here,
. ; irestling round the banks of what was
-'..once a clear mountain stream, rise
.huge sheds and tall iron chimneys. The
s.tream has long since disappeared.'
â¢Viscid pools of ugly looking yellow, and
. â¢ gray slime have taken its place, but it
"Is worth noticing that the gully drains
â¢"into .the Sacramento. When the rainy
.season y sets in, and a Hood of water
rushes down the canyon, all this refuse
â¢ must' bo washed down into the river,
polluting the beautiful stream and de
stroying the fish for many miles.
From the tall chimneys of the smelter
clouds of blue vapor pour forth day and
! night. But this Is not the worst of it.
High up on the opposite hillside,
clothed only with the stems of dead flrs,
rises another cloud of smoke. This is
i the real source of the trouble, for here,
; by the primitive process of open-air
; roasting, are produced those sulphur
ous fumes which are rapidly blighting
the whole countryside. Any one who
! has been in the manufacturing States
of the East or in England has seen
what is generally termed a "black
country-" A place of barren desolation,
; of slag heaps and ore dumps, where no
I green thing grows, and where day and
: night the furnaces and factory ctaim
| neys pour forth their poisonous smoke.
This is what Keswick looks like to-day
and in ten years' time, if something is
'â â  not done, the greater part of Shasta
County will present a similar appear
ance.
To understand the reasons for this
iwe must look into tne process cm
i ployed by the Mountain Copper Com
pany. The ore is brought from the mine
! by a private line of railway and in the
: first instance is dumped down on the
. hillside. Its main constituents are
| copper and iron sulphides, as well as
I a small percentage of gold and silver.
j Before smelting the ore the sulphur
: must be extracted by roasting. Re
| gardless of the welfare of the country
jor the health of the residents round
! about, the company has adopted the
] simplest and cheapest method of doing
this. The ore is just burned in the open
i air and SC2 in enormous Quantities
1 set free to devastate the land. Sulphur
j ous acid, it may be remarked, is of no
j use to the company, it has no com
; mercial value and cannot be turned
i Into dividends. Consequently while it
â  keeps the gold and the silver the cop
j per and the iron for the enrichment of
i its shareholders in England it gener
j ously presents the poisonous residue to
California, The bargain is rather too
one-F : led to be fair.
A spot is selected on the hillside and
a thick layer of firewood put down. A
great pile of ore is dumped on top of
this, making a mound some six feet
high and of any length desired. When
I the fire is once properly started the
ore will go on burning itself, smold
i ering away for a month or more. Flow
i ers of sulphur, hideous travesties of
| nature's fairer work, form on the sur
' face, the fumes which rise are almost
| suffocating. One cannot stay in the
i neighborhood. Of course the men work
i ing there get somewhat used to the air. j
| though none of them can endure the oc
cupation for long. There are any num
ber of these poisonous fires scattered
about the hillside, and as the works
' put through from five hundred to seven :
; hundred tons of ore per day some Idea ]
\ may be formed of the amount of sul-
p hurous acid given off. Down below !
the finer portion of the ore is treated
in a Ropp calcining furnace, but the
result Is much the same, for the fumes i
i all escape into the open air through i
1 chimneys.
There are from 1000 to 1200 men em- J
! ployed at the works, yet it is a sig
i niflcant fact that few of them remain :
at the occupation continuously. The
foremen, the mechanics, the better j
paid class of skilled workmen, may ;
marry and settle down in one of the i
company's little cottages, but the great j
I bulk of the labor is of the vagrant !
! type. Men of all nationtlities. Dagos '
i and Dutchmen, Irishmen and Cornish- j
i men, drop in here, and as long as a [
j man is strop- enough for the trying :
i labor he is rarely refused employment.
! Workmen of this class are never too
i plentiful, and the company is glad to j
secure whom it can, at a wage of about ,
$2 50 a day. But hard labor under j
such conditions soon saps a man's vi- ]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 22, 1898.
tality, the miserable wrecks one sees
about the beer saloons bear eloquent
testimony to the fact. Nearly every
man with whom I spoke told me that j
he was only waiting until he had saved j
enough money to get away. For the
credit of the State, it should be men
tioned thatHhere are very few Cali
fornians engaged in this degrading la
bor. Our men are above this kind of
work, and are to be found only in the
ranks of the skilled artisan.
Travel around the country anywhere
within a radius of ten or twelve miles
and you will find ample evidence of
the destructive effect of thes^ fumes.
The fir trees on the slopes are with- j
ered and brown, even the oaks, which j
have stood the visitation longest, are i
giving way. The manzanita bushes
and the chaparral of the undergrowth
are dried up, and it only requires the
slightest spark to start a destructive
bush fire. Consequently during this
dry weather fires are of daily occur
rence. It may be the carelessness of
a camper, who leaves the embers un
covered; it may be the design of a
prospector, who wishes to lay bare the
ledges and render his search for the
precious metal easy. But whatever
the reason, the spark to start a fire is
rarely wanting, and the hills around
Shasta are rapidly being denuded of
their timber.
Naturally the residents of this old
established mining town, which is only
some three miles from the smelters,
1 are extremely indignant, though, for
I reasons which can readily be under
! stood, they are very cautious in giving
expression to their indignation. They
'â  will talk freely enough in confidence,
i but they Invariably extort a promise
! that their name shall not appear in
i print. A good many people from the
; works live in Shasta; there are local
! and business interests to be considered,
and no one cares to declare himself
the pronounced enemy of such a great
corporation. "I will give Shasta just
I ten years to become as barren as Kes
wick," said one resident, "that is, if a
bush' fire does not destroy it before."
"There is more sickness in the town
than was ever known before," says an
other. "People get carried off by
some mysterious complaint, and we j
j can only attribute it to the fumes."
Between Shasta and Iron Mountain
! there was formerly a prosperous ranch
i kept by a man named Welsh. He had j
â  a fine orchard and supplied Shasta with
I all the fruit it required. But as soon j
i as the smelters started his whole crop
was destroyed, even thf fruit which
! had already ripened on the trees was
! found uneatable, being strongly im
pregnated with sulphur fumes. He had"
to abandon the ranch and brought an
action against the company for dam
apes. The corporation, following its
! usual policy, bought him out, and noth
| ing more was heard of the matter.
Another still more pitiful instance
! occurred just outside Shasta. Two
j old residents. Messrs. Stolberg and
Mauser, cultivated an orchard there for
' many years. But the trees grew old,
â¢ the fruit trade was no longer profitable,
j so they decided that almonds would
ROASTING ORE IN THE OPEN AIR.
'be the thing. They dug up their old
i trees and put in almonds, and for a
i time all went well. The trees were just
beginning to bear, and the prospect of
large quantities of salable nuts cheered
j the old men's hearts. Just then the
i smelter came along, and with the first
I fumes their hopes vanished. The al
i mond trees, from which so much was
J expected, withered as soon as the dead
! ly blight fell upon them, and the old
: men were ruined.
Though the busy town of Redding is
i some seven miles from the works It
,' feels the effects of the fumes even more
markedly than Shasta. Redding is a
: strictly commercial place; its citizens
i derive profit in many ways from the
; smelters and the men who work them.
So they don't like to say too much,
but they admit that on a -wet day, if
the wind happens to be in the right
direction, the shrubs and flowers in
their gardens shrivel up under the
poisonous fumes. The sulphur even at
j tacks the paint on their houses, fruit
growing in the neighborhood has been
I abandoned, and more than one neg
i lected and deserted ranch gives mute
' evidence to the destructive effects of
I SO2.
Whether the small amount of busl-
I ness brought them by the smelters is
! sufficient compensation for the destruc
| tion of their orchards and farms is the
i question now agitating the citizens of
; Shasta County. Outside the storekeep
ing element there is only one answer.
The agricultural development of Shasta
has been rather backward, owing to
the fact that most of its residents were
; absorbed in mining pnrsuits. But dur
ing the last few years, when prospect
ing ceased to be profitable, a new era
i began. Many small ranches were
I cleared and planted, orchards were al
| ready beginning to bloom, and a great
] expansion in the legitimate trade of the
I district was looked for. Shasta has
! abundance of rich land which will well
'â . repay culture, and it was expected that
i the fruit-growing industry would find
j a home there, covering the land with
' verdant orchards. This forward move
! ment was already under way when
| came the smelters, and the future of
Shasta vanished under the blight of the
i sulphurous fumes.
The county rejoices In a magnificent
1 climate, having neither the excessive
cold of the mountains nor the wither
ing heat of the valleys. Pretty well
I everything in the way of fruit and
, vegetables could be grown profitably,
: and there is abundance of timber in the
; ranges, sugar pine, yellow pine, spruce
j and fir, which might in time be brought
jto market. At present this lumber is
, too far from the railway, is too inacces
sible, to be worked profitably, but when
j the more easily reached forests have
; been used up its value will be enor
mous. That is, if there is any left after
the fumes from the smelter have put. in
; their work. A tree once touched by this
j poisonous breath not only closes its
; leaves and dies, but its very trunk de
j cays under the foul Influence, and the
I wood becomes useless, even for fire- J
wood. It is no wonder that the resi
dents despair; unless the e,yll is
checked there is nothing before the
country but barren desolation, over
hung by a cloud of sulphurous smoke.
The matter has not altogether es
caped the attention of the Government,
for some time ago H. C. Cullom, a
brother of the Senator, was sent here
to inquire into the condition of affairs.
His report was decidedly adverse to the
smelters, and in consequence an injunc
tion to restrain the company from its
death-dealing operations was applied
for in the Federal courts. But some
how or other the matter has got hung
up, and while lawyers are still wrang
ling over tedious questions of jurisdic
tion the poisoning of the countryside
goes on unchecked. In some mysterious
way it has become remarkably difficult
to procure witnesses who will testify to
the evil effects wrought by the fumes,
and it is quite evident that the corpo
ration is going to make a strong fight
for the privilege of devastating one of
the most fertile portions of California.
If the State benefited to any extent
by these operations we might possibly
consider whether it was worth while
to give up a certain area of land to
the destructive smelters. But, as far
as I can gather, California gains but
little by having this industry settled
in her midst. The capital employed is
wholly foreign, and the dividends
earnedâ no one knows how large they
are _ n ecessarily go abroad. Most of
the stores required by the company are
Imported. It spends as little as possi
ble in the land whence It derives
its wealth. Even the refining of the
ores Is not done here, for the matte is
sent to the company's works at New
ark N. J-, for treatment. What re
turn then, does California receive for
the damage done to her forests and
orchards?
The corporation can only point to the
town of Keswick, the offspring of the
smeltersâ and I have already said
enough about its character to convince
any impartial observer that the State
would be much better off without any
town of the kind. Also the corpora
tion gives employment to several hun
dred vagrant laborers, who never
would be missed if they left us for
ever In return for these concessions
the company takes all that is of value
in the Iron Mountain ore and exports
it, leaving only the poisonous element
behind.
The solution of the problem is easy.
If the smelters are to continue work
ing at Keswick they should be com
pelled to absorb their own fumes.
Chemical science has made the task
possible. It is a pure matter of ex
pense. I asked Mr. Freeland, the
smelting superintendent, why some
steps were not taken to condense the
fumes and prevent their widespread
distribution over the country. His
answer was evasive. "It could be
done," he replied, "but only at prohibi
tive expense. That is to say, the
scheme is not commercially practica
ble. If we had to condense our fumes
it would not pay us to smelt the ore
at all."
If this Is so. and the matter is by no
means certain, then California would
be much better off without any smelt
i ers of the kind. But probably, if legal
pressure were brought to bear, the
company might find that there were
, means available for condensing the
fumes without ruinous outlay. Per
haps the dividends paid to the English
shareholders might be a trifle less, but
i still, if the thing had to be done, It
would be done. That it will not be
done, except under absolute compulsion,
is equally certain. If the law courts
fail to grant an injunction, then the
pressure of public opinion must be
I brought to bear, and legislation en-
I acted which will force the company to
I abandon its assumed right to devastate
! one of the fairest portions of the State.

PARIS, Aug. 21. â The thermometer Is
not the only thing that has risen this
week. The death list also is higher
than usual. For the past few days the
figures have been between 200 and 220

average. Yesterday, for example,
there were 212 funerals. As may be
imagined, infants have formed the bulk

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Aug. 10.â One day last
month there appeared In The Call an
elaborate Interview with Representa
tive and Congressional Commissioner
Robert R. Hitt, in which Mr. Hitt was
reported as having said in reference to
the Chinese problem:
"This is a most difficult problem, but
I trust not an insoluble one. My un
derstanding is that most of the China

to go back to their homes when the

How very little even Intelligent Con

illustrated very briefly. There were
at the last census (1896)â and the num

10,941 unskilled Chinese laborers in the

1896, there were employed on the sugar

ber ever engaged as such, were con
tract laborers. As no Chinese were im
ported since that date the number of
contract laborers has been materially
reduced, and in the ordinary course of
events, and unless advantage is taken
of Minister Cooper's bill of the last j
session to introduce other large i
batches, their three-year contracts will
rapidly expire. The other ten thou
sand (roughly speaking) Chinese are
divided, like other aliens, among other
pursuits, especially raising rice, fruits,
vegetables, pigs, ducks and fowl and
fishing, and in all the mechanical
trades. They are also deserting their
contracts in large numbers to join the
coffee planters.
It is not so much the number of the
Chinese coolie laborers that we dread
now as the possibility of being swamp
ed with more who, in course of time,
will follow the example of their pre
decessors and overcrowd the cities and
compete, as they are even now most
disastrously doing, with mechanics,
artisans and tradesmen. We would be
willing to concede to the sugar, rice
and coffee industries well regulated
coolie labor if it is conclusively proved
that respectable white labor cannot be
obtained at reasonable rates of wages,
but the people feel that no honest ef
fort has been made to solve this prob
lem, owing to the cost of importing
competent labor and the necessity, as
the planters claim, of paying wages
which insure to them commensurate
profits. All will admit that no coun- ;
try has ever expended so much money
on labor experiments as has Hawaii
in proportion to her wealth and pop
ulation. Whether Congress will solve
the knotty problem remains to be
seen.
Another interesting matter for the
Congressional Commissioners to con
sider will be the status of the Hawai
ian Chinese. Seven hundred and over
have been naturalized, for under the
old laws no alien could marry a Ha
waiian woman without first becoming
a citizen of the country, and recently
no less than 1600 Chinese children have
been registered in the Chinese Bureau !
of the Foreign Office as having been
born in Hawaii, and curiously enough j
the eldest of four of these children was
1 born thirty-seven years ago. The first
recorded Chinese naturalization was in
1845.
The view that the Chinese in Hawaii
take of themselves may be foregathered
from a memorial which they will pre
sent to the Corr" issioners and in which i
they thus speak of themselves in art- ,
vocating an impartial consideration of
their future status under the American
flag: They will assert that under the
laws of Hawaii they have, notwith
standing the fact that there never have
existed treaty relations between the
empire of China and Hawaii, fully and
freely enjoyed the same rights and
privileges in regard to person and prop
erty as the citizens or subjects of the
most favored nations having treaty re
lations with Hawaii, with the exception
that they have not openly enjoyed the
privilege of political representation In !
the conduct of the affairs of the coun- j
try; they have been admitted to clti- !
zenship by naturalization; they have
intermarried with the natives of the
country and have had children born to
them in the land; they have expended
large sums of money and much labor
In the reclamation of waste and bar
ren lands and have done much to fos
ter and insure the commercial and in
dustrial resources of the Hawaiian
Islands; they have learned your lan
guage, and many have adopted your
civilization, religion and dress; their
children have been educated in your
churches, schools and colleges; they
have established and aided in establish
ing Christian churches, schools, hos
pitals. Young Men's Christian Associa
tions and other kindred societies; they
have watched over their own sick and
poor and contributed generously to the
wants of other nationalities, and aided
in all public enterprises for the henefit
of Hawaii Nel; they have contributed
very largely to the revenues of the
country and their progressive influence,
from knowledge gained here, has been
beneficially felt in their own land. To
them is largely due the prosperity of
Hawaii to-day through their labor de
veloping the sugar and rice plantations,
the fruit farms and vegetable gardens
and the great shipping business and
commercial relations with the Orient
of which they were the pioneers. To
them Hawaii has become endeared as
their adopted home by the kindness and
fair treatment of many years, and their
long sojourn here has been marked with
amity and the absence of all discord
ant influences. In commercial and so
cial life tt\ey have been respected and
esteemed, and as obeyers of the law
they have been the equals of any other
nationality.
Some men are always out when their
country calls.

ANOTHER CYCLE OF COMMERCIAL
ACTIVITY.
WHILE the war with Spain did not decrease
business in any way, its close has caused a de
cided increase in many directions. This in
crease cannot be traced to any sudden development
of trade with our new possessions, for it is too soon
to look for any such expansion, though it will come
later on. It seems to be purely local, if such a cir
cumscribed term can be applied to a country as vast as
the United States. Indeed, the conclusion of the war
may have nothing to do with it after all, for it may
be simply the awakening of the usual fall trade, which
is expected to be lively this year. But whatever it
proceeds from there is certainly a marked increase
in the volume of business throughout the country.
The improvement is remarkably general and char
acterizes a large variety of products. The West and
South continue to lead the other sections of the coun
try* as fÂ° r some time past, the East showing only a
moderate gain. The Northwest is a little slow with
collections, but this condition is expected to disappear
when the movement of the spring wheat crop begins.
The distributive trade of the country west of the Alle
ghar.ies is widening everywhere, and the leading
staples are going out of first hands with gratifying
fluency.
The individual items of improvement are a steady
increase in the country's bank clearings, those for the
past week being n.6 per cent over those for the same
week last year. The failures were 195, against 221.
Railroad earnings continue to increase, and as the
movement of crops to market is not especially heavy
at the moment, the gain is ascribed to free shipments
of manufactured products to the agricultural districts.
An immense business is reported in iron and steel,
with advanced prices for many descriptions. Indeed,
business in this line is so active that the general run
of works cannot fill all their orders. The electrical
concerns are also far behind in their engagements.
All the western centers report a large influx of buy
ers, with a brisk demand for hats and caps, boots and
shoes and dry goods. The inquiry for wool and
woolen goods is only moderately active, but these
lines have been lagging for some titne. The improve
ment in cotton mentioned several weeks ago con
tinues, but trade is .not especially lively. The wheat
shipments from the Atlantic Coast show a falling off,
. being 3.796,000 bushels, against 5.317,000 for the
corresponding week in 1897. Hides and leather are
also quiet, and prices have ruled rather weak than
otherwise.
The most pronounced awakening, however, is in Wall
street. Here it comes pretty close to a boom. The
public have re-entered the market, and the buying last
week was almost reckless. In fact, we are told that
it was so sharp that the professionals almost lost con
trol of the market. Railroad shares led in point of
preference, though the demand for sterling bonds
continued good. The general sentiment in Wall street
is that the demand for investment has come to stay,
and that there will be an active market for some time
to come. The only condition now visible which would
be apt to check the buying desire is the possible sus
pension of peace negotiations through the haggling
and quibbling of Spain, a condition which is even at
this day menaced by that stubborn and disappointed
Government. At present, however, everything is
lovely in Wall street.
In the weekly commercial reports California is
specified as the one particularly quiet State in the
Union. This, of course, is due to the decreased yield
of fruit and cereals on account of the deficient rain
fall last winter; but considering that we have enough
of both to eat ourselves and considerable to sell be
â  sides, we are not in such a bad way after all. The fact
is, California has been such an enormous producer in
â¢the past that when a year of decreased production
comes along the contrast is sharp. We shall prob
ably have 100.000 tons of wheat for export this year.
and are already sending canned and dried fruits to
Europe, though we cannot satisfy her calls upon us
this season. There is not a single line of produce
short enough this year to work a hardship on any-
body, and what we have produced is bringing un
usually fine prices, except cereals, though even they
are selling at quotations away above the cost of pro
duction. It would be a strange year indeed which
caught California without anything to sell, and it is
.hardly probable that such a year will ever be wit
nessed. It is generally the other way.
As for the rest, business is not at all bad here, even
. though the State is specified as "quiet." We have
abundance of money at the normal rates of interest,
the merchants report themselves satisfied with the
condition of trade, and the farmers are doing bet
ter on the whole than for a number of years back.
Collections are average, failures are few and small and
no complaints are heard from any quarter.
Judged by the arrogance of the Spanish at Manila
they put up the white flag before they had been
whipped half enough.
There's many a slip between the signing of a peace
protocol and the perfecting of a peace.
Th|E REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.
1""* HE convention which is to meet in a few hours
has upon it the responsibility of naming not only
the next Governor of California, but the leader
who will take his party into a victorious action that
will give to it public power and authority for the next
four years. Past experiments have somewhat shown
to this coming convention the way in which it should
walk. Attempts to put leadership in the hands of men
who have in the past failed in their party fealty have
usually brought disaster. Just now all the people are
looking for stability, strength and consistency in a
State administration, and there is in men an instinct
which teaches them that these are not to be found
in any one subject to political hysterics, or one erratic
and uncertain in his party allegiance.
The Republican party is rich in men qualified for
this great office, and with a record that entitles them
to the confidence of the party and the people. It is
not necessary to go outside of this list and select any
one whose sole experience in public life has been
gained by bolting the party and elevating himself by
its defeat, or who has been silent in its great crises.
Within the eligible are many who will not seek the
nomination and who would regard its acceptance as a
personal sacrifice too great to be justified by any but
the gravest emergency.
At this moment the candidate who easily leads as
the preference of delegates from all parts of the State
is Mr. Henry T. Gage. It is significant, too, that he
is the choice of most of those who might be his com
petitors if they chose, but who abstain in the pres
ence of his merits of address, culture, genius and
record.
All free societies are directed by their best elements.
When these in a party indicate their choice it is safe
to accept it as reasonably sure to command the popu
lar approbation. The best elements in the Republican
party are those who seek the best conditions for all
men, that life may be crowned with the happiest re
sults for every citizen. These elements staad, first of
all, for the rights and dignity of labor, from whose
ranks the strong and wholesome brains and bodies,
the richest possession of the State, are derived. These
best elements in the Republican party, mindful of their
own origin, know that the first political duty is to
keep affluent the fountain whence they came. There
fore the men in the ranks of the party who so highly
guide its destiny seek a candidate and leader who can
lead a successful fight for power that is to be used
in the interest of the great masses whose prosperity
and happiness are the impulse of the State's progress
and greatness.
That these elements in the party, men too strong to
be governed by any but themselves, in whose pres
ence no boss issues a command, have after mature
reflection cast their influence for Mr. Gage, goes far,
not only to indicate his nomination, but to give as
surance that his campaign will be a march to victory
if he be the choice of the convention.
The Call has no candidate. It questioned the candi
dacy of Mr. Gage in order that its strong points and
weak points might be found. The resulting examina
tion has cleared many questions, the mere raising of
which brought to him the vindication of political
friend and foe.
His candidacy has been put by thi9 examination
upon a plane to which that of any other must be
raised to put its merits in competition. This is un
derstood by the wise men who are in the interest of
other candidates, and they elevate their favorites to
his level, since it has proved impossible to pull him
down.
If he be the nominee the party will be united upon
the candidacy of a man who never trieW to divide it,
against whom no one holds a grudge generated by
defeat caused by bolting and kicking at a local ticket,
and in that union goes an invitation to the large con
tingent of independent voters to seek the best good of
the State by supporting a man who is the choice of
the best men in his own party.
OFFICIAL DIGNITY AT WASHINGTON.
THE retirement of Mr. Day from the office of
Secretary of State on the express ground that
he is not rich enough to maintain the social
prestige of the position, affords a striking illustration
of the extent to which Washington society has drifted
away from the Republican simplicity of its early days.
It is likely it will also give rise to a movement toward
increasing the salaries of members of the Cabinet.
It was clearly the intention of the founders of our
Government that the highest offices should be not
only within the reach of the poorest citizen, but that
they should carry with them salaries large enough to
admit of their acceptance by men who had no private
fortunes. The fathers of the Republic, however, ex
pected Washington society to continue on a plane of
Republican simplicity of manners and living. It was
not foreseen by them that social leaders at the capital
would ape the customs of London and Paris and that
State officials would be required to live like princes.
A member of the Cabinet receives $8000 a year. The
law does not require him to maintain anything in the
way of social state. He may live at a hotel or in a
modest flat if he chooses. Neither does the sentiment
of the country at large require him to keep a man
sion, a carriage and a retinue of servants. It asks of
him no elaborate dinners and no grand receptions.
In fact it does not require of a Cabinet Minister as
much in the way of hospitality as of the Governor of
a State. Clearly, therefore, there is nothing in the
conditions of the office that necessarily entail a lavish
way of living, and if there is a demand for that sort
of thing the demand is a factitious one created solely
by Washington society itself.
It is to be regretted that any American should feel
lr'nifelf debarred from the service of the nation by the
1.-.ck of a private fortune. It will be a bad day for this
country when, by reason of our social customs, none
but the rich can afford to hold high offices at Wash
ington. That fact is recognized at the capital itself,
and it is for this reason some papers there are now
busily engaged in creating a sentiment favorable to
an increase of salaries. Their idea is that since our
society has advanced to the style of living at imperial
capitals the salaries paid by the Government should
also be imperial.
The members of the British Cabinet receive $25,000
a year. They maintain stately homes in London and
entertain \>n a grand scale. Washington people would
like that style adopted by us. It would enliven Wash
ington winters and help Washington trade. Inci
dentally it would boom Washington real/Â«state by
making the city a desirable place of residence for the
I rich as the social center of the nation.
There are, however, serious objections to the plan
proposed. A raise in salaries under prevailing con
ditions would simply mean a raise in the general style
of Washington living, and ere long there would be
a demand for another raise. Even with a salary of
$25,000 a year no man without a private fortune can
I maintain the position of a Cabinet Minister in Lon
â  don. Social prestige is like an open poker game â
there is no limit to the amount of the raise.
Any man who has the moral courage to defy the
demands of a luxurious society dominated by idlers
can live at Washington, perform all the duties of a
Cabinet officer and save money on $8000 a year; and
a man who lacks that quality ought not to be Secre

tary of State. This is a rich country, but it would be
better to vote more money for river improvements

ONE HOLE IN THE PLATFORM.
WHILE the Democratic platform is marked by
several singular gaps, due to omissions for
which apologies will have to be made during
the campaign, there is none more singular than the
neglect to offer sympathy to the soldier and sailor,
and to express condolence for those whose sons or
brothers have given up their lives for the country.
At this time the impulses of patriotism are particu
larly acute. Our troops are returning victorious
from distant shores. The flag of the Union floats
over territory where its presence had hardly been
known. But where it waves it casts its shadow across
the graves of our patriot dead; it falls upon those
who suffer on beds of pain and turn longing eyes
back to a land they are never more to see. Yet the
Democracy of California in convention assembled for
got these brave boys, living and dead, forgot the
stricken at home.
Never was there a convention marked by so vin
dictive a spirit of greed. The speeches were bitter,
the character of the proceedings sullen and the ad
dresses all shaped upon some personal ambition.
There was not a broad and statesmanlike utterance.
Yet in the compilation of a platform there should
have been attention paid to the sentiment of the coun
try. It seems that for an hour asperities might have
been laid aside and an open and manly meed of praise
awarded to the young blood of the land.
But no. The convention could not rise above the
petty bickering for preferment. Selfish aspirations
could not for an instant be allayed. The platform
was made in heedlessness of humane issues, and by
that assemblage which had failed to recognize the
"Star-Spangled Banner" adopted with no thought be
yond the fact that to adopt something was a necessary
form.
The hole in the platform is a large one. Somebody
will fall through it.
| â \ ETURNING peace has brought with it clear-
King skies in every direction. We no longer
receive from Europe dispatches announcing
the hostility of Governments and peoples against us.
On the contrary, all reports from the great capitals
are to the effect that public sentiment has changed
and that our victory is accepted as an event tending
to the welfare of all.
During the early days of the war reports from
abroad teemed with statements of German antago
nism to the United States. So repeatedly were such
statements put forward that a suspicion arose that
some power was at work striving to create hostility
between ourselves and the Germans. Whether the
suspicion was well founded or not it is gratifying to
note that the irritating reports have ceased and that
we are now receiving from Germany as well as from
other European countries evidences of satisfaction in
the results of the war.
In the foreign news of yesterday considerable space
was given to friendly expressions on the part of lead
ing newspapers in Germany. The Cologne Gazette
highly praised our naval forces at Manila, declared
j that under our control the business and industries of
i the Philippines would rapidly revive, and added:
"Now that the star-spangled banner waves all danger
to German commercial interests is past." The Ber
liner Tageblatt was equally complimentary in its
| comments and commended Admiral Dewey on the
i tact with which he had preserved friendly and correct
i relations with the German squadron at Manila during
the continuance of the strife.
These statements undoubtedly express the abiding
sentiments of the German people. They are of more
value than the sensational reports of hostile expres
sion so frequency sent out during the last three
months. The skies in fact have cleared and we are
beginning to see more accurately the attitudes of the
various nations toward us. Moreover, the foreign
Governments and peoples are beginning to see us
more clearly and to have a better understanding of
our purposes and our power to enforce them. Peace
has brought with it a restoration of our friendly re
lations with the great nations of the world, and it is
evident if we have made any enemies outside of Spain
by this war, they are not very influential or else are
keeping discreetly silent.
PUBLIC interest in the national side of the polit
ical contests this fall will be mainly directed
toward the efforts of the Republicans to win
a sufficient number of Senatorial seats to give them
a safe working majority in the Senate when the next
Congress assembles. The fight for the control of
the House can hardly be called interesting since it
seems a foregone conclusion that the Republicans will
easily retain a majority in that body. Nothing but
gross blundering on the part of Republicans in mak
ing Congressional nominations can give the Demo
crats any chance of success, and such blundering is
not likely to be committed.
As the Senate stands to-day it consists of 44 straight
Republicans, 3 Silver Republicans, 2 who are classed
in the political nomenclature of the day as "straight
silverites," one Independent. 5 Populists and 34 Dem
ocrats, making a total of 89; there being one va
cancy in the representation from Oregon. The terms
of thirty Senators expire next March. Maryland has
already selected a Republican to succeed Gorman,
and it is accounted as reasonably sure they will win
seats now held by Democrats in Wisconsin, New Jer
sey, West Virginia, California and New York.
Success in the fight for Senatorships would give,
the Republican party complete control of Congress
and enable the enactment of legislation in the direc
tion of currency reform and the adoption of other
great measures of Republican policy. The adminis
tration has been largely hampered in its work thus
far by the fact that the balance of power in the Senate
is held by a small clique of Populists and so-called
Silver Republicans, who stand in the way of the ac
complishment of any systematic monetary legislation
on a sound basis.
The importance of this phase of the contest is
everywhere recognized, and the contest for members
of the legislative ticket in States where Senators are
to be chosen will be keen. In California this issue of
the elections will not be overlooked. Whatever may
be the result elsewhere California must send a stanch
Republican to succeed White in the United States
Senate.
If all the stories of the mismanagement on board
the transports are true, there is nothing surprising in
the number of desertions except that it is so small.
Apparently the people of Porto Rico are so glad to
get from under Spanish rule that they may necessitate
the calling out of the police.
General Shafter is to be congratulated that yellow
journalism still attacks him. He can be certain of
ultimate popularity.

A UNITED STATES BILT.TONâ An Old

in error, and that it Is written thusly,
1 000.000,000."
Had An Old Subscriber carefully stud
ied the answer given he would have noted
that the answer was as to what an Eng
lish billion and a Spanish billion are. The
answer Is strictly correct, and had his
knowledge of billions been more extended
he would have known that in England
and the greater part of Continental Eu
rope a billion is a million of millions
(1 1Â»00,000,000.000), and not ten hundred mil

THE MANAGEMENT OF
THE BELL ESTATE
EXECUTOR STAACKE DENIES
VARIOUS CHARGES.
He Maintains the Petition for His
Removal Is Full of Erro
neous Statements.
In a petition filed in the Superior Court
by Attorney William H. Schooler the re
moval of George H. Staacke as executor
of the will of Thomas Bell is asked for
on the ground of mismanagement of the
estate. Beveral charges are mode against
Mr. Staacke, who. in explaining or deny
. ing them. Incidentally pays Mr. Schooler
"seems to have a prejudice against him."
"Neither I nor any of the other
' executors have ever made any but a ver
bal report on the Progreso mine or any
; of the assets of the Bell estate," said
Mr. Staacke. "That disposes of the charge
1 that 1 hurriedly filed a report Immediate
ly following Maxwell's resignation.
"Mrs. Bell's attorneys have had full ac
cess to the books, and full information
has been given to Fred Bell.
"As to the charge that the executors
I failed to account for $UÂ»S,2SU worth of
; stocks, bonds, etc., the statement Is per
fectly ridiculous. The court appoints the
appraisers, who Inventory and appraise
tin- estate.
"Now about that debt of $12,708, oved
by Maxwell, and which the petition say.-;
was never paid. There is no evidence of
indebtedness other than the account in
the books. Bell agreed to pay Maxwells
assessment in the mine, amounting to
about $17,0)0. He â was given credit for
the payment of $5100, and after Bell's
death. Maxwell was unable to pay his
share on a quarter interest In the mine,
i and thereupon turned the mining property
: over to the estate. The estate has since
: paid the assessment on the interest of
! both Bell and Maxwell.
"As to my indebtedness of $8600, as
charged in Schooler's petition, it is true
| that 1 put in a counter claim of $5400, but
1 it was not allowed by the court, the ref-
I tree deciding against It because there
were no witnesses. It was for keeping the
\ individual books for Bell for eleven years,

two years prior to his death. For
two years' services I charged $5400.

works of the revenue collectors. Oh, yes, I have
stamped them, but it is not logical, and anything I
abominate is an Illogical person or act. Pretty soon we

Every time a glass is raised to your mouth a new

Maxwell is one of the directors of the
mine. The property has been well man
aged since Maxwell put In a new super
intendent in May, 1595. The trouble with
the estate is that the assets are hard to
realize on.

DEWEY TO BE CONSULTED
AS TO THE PHILIPPINES
Appointment of the Peace Commis
sion to Wait Till the Reception
of the Admiral's Report.
NF.W YORK, Aug. 21.â The Herald's
Washington corespondent teleiErraphs:
The President remarked to-day In con
versation with Senator Proctor that he
wished Rear Admiral Dewey was near
enough at hand so he might be freely
consulted relative to the Philippine
question. The President spent nearly
half an hour discussing Admiral Dewey
and his admirable qualities as an offi
cer and American citizen and diplomat.
While it may not be feasible for Ad
miral Dewey to leave Manila and come
to Washington for consultation with
the President, it is said the President
has requested the hero of Manila to
submit in writing his views on the
Philippine question, and the delay in
announcing the peace commissioners is
dependent largely upon the reception
of such a detailed report and such sug
gestions as he may see tit to offer to
aid the administration in framing its
policy for the government of the far
away islands in the Pacific.
The President values the practical
observations of such men as Dewey,
Sampson and Schley in constructing
his foreign policy much more highly
than he does the suggestions of design
ing politicians.

Standing on a board which was placed

Ferdinan directed the efforts of the
"grave diggers" in removing the earth
which covered the box in which reposed
the "hypnotic freak." j After considerable
trouble the earth was removed and Ferdi

The burial of Ferdinan took place short- j

a vacant lot at Market and Larkin

by a brief address on hypnotism by Fer

dancer and magician. She attributed the
power that Ferdinan possessed of sus

that, like all great men, he was born
under the star Jupiter.

coffin, kissed his wife and extending his
arms began to twitch his fingers. Then he

perintending all the arrangements. Be
fore the lid was screwed down Dr. Bunnell
was permitted to feel his pulse and it
registered 90. Some time was taken up
in fixing a tube through which the elec
tric wire runs, giving the light to see
Ferdinan's face down a well about a foot
square, which was constructed on top of
the glass on the coffin and through which
the people look, and then the earth was ;
shoveled in and the performance was
over. The grave has a tent for a cover
ing
Ferdtnan was attired in a dark suit of
clothes, white shirt and white tie. He was
supposed to remain in the state of sus
1 pended animation until Saturday night at
9 o'clock, not receiving any food or drink,
during the week. He could get a little
air from the tube and the well if , he
was able to remove the glass on the
coffin. Some people who saw the perform
ance were skeptical and remarked that
there was nothing to prevent Ferdinan
from being resurrected and a wax figure
substituted when no one was around ex
cept his friends. That and similar scoff
ing suggestions were resented by Ferdi
nan's friends, who were willing that relays
of citizens should watch day and night
! in the tent."
Just three hours after the freak had
been buried his wife, who had not left the
grave, happened to look down the tube j
and was startled to see Ferdinan gasping
for breath. Tearing, her short chemical
locks she pleaded with the few men pres- j
ent to dig him out. The work of removing
the earth which covered the coffin was too
slow to suit the excited woman, and she â 
vainly pleaded for somebody to get her a
shovel. ,
"I knew something would happen, she
tearfully remarked. "Poor Albert will
never leave there alive."
Sergeants Conboy and Brophy, Detec
tive Anthony and Policeman Phil Fryer
kept the crowd back while the "grave-dig
gers" worked hard to extricate Ferdinan
before it was too late. After the earth
which covered the coffin was removed
Ferdinan's voice could be distinctly heard
calling upon his rescuers to "hurry up."
"Get a move on," he loudly shouted, "or
I am a dead one!" i
During the, work of removing the earth
Mrs. Ferdinan. dressed in a duck suit, her
head uncovered, stood at the side of the
"grave" tearfully pleading with the shov
elers to lose no time. Hearing her hus
band's voice she bent her head toward the
coffin and in tremulous tones asked him if
he were all right.
"It is pretty hot down here," replied the
freak; "tell them guys to get a move on
and let me out."
Just then a small portion of the bank at
the head of the "grave" gave way, partly
covering the coffin.
My God, he is smothered!" cried Mrs.
Ferdinan. again tearing her straw-colored
hair. "Albert, dear, do you hear me?"
Ferdlnan faintly replied that. he could,
and In a sort of whisper asked her to "get
the hobos away" as they interfered with
the shovelers.
The undertaker who had loaned the box
in which Ferdlnan was. buried appeared
at this juncture and suggested that the lid
be raised by means of straps.
"To with the straps," shouted For
dinan. "youse fellers will send me to the
Morgue if you don't get a move on. De
spite his objection the straps were at
tached to the lid. but failed to raise it.
Sergeant Conboy, in his anxiety to rescue
Ferdinan. fell into the hole, and it was
with difficulty that he was pulled out.
After considerable trouble the lid was
finally raised and Ferdlnan extricated.
Ho presented a sorry spectacle as he wa>i
helped out of the hole. His face was cov
ered with dirt, his collar was torn from
its fastening and his Prince Albert coat
was steaming with perspiration.
"What fool arranged that electric
lifht?" he angrily asked of his wife.
"That guy must have wanted to send me
to the Morgue." '
His wife, amid tears, cautioned him
against getting excited, and tenderly
Wiped the dirt -.from his face/:
'.'Let me alone," roared the angry freak.
"Somebody turn me loose."
Ferdinan evidently thought he was be- 'â 
ing lionized by a crowd after, a successful
test of suspended animation, but in this i
he was greatly mistaken. The few people ;
who were present laughed fit his failure, !
and the cry of fake was frequently ut
tered. After awakening from a short
sleep Ferdlnan explained. that the electric
light was placed too near his face, which
had the effect of arousing him from his
hypnotic state. The heai , generated from
the light was Intense, and as he was
about losing consciousness, he claims, his
wife discovered his 1 condition. '
"I guess it would have been all off with
me in a short time longer." he remarked.
"I felt myself goiner rapidly. The ; guy i
that placed the light in my face came
near cooking me. I suppose the people
will say I am a faker, but it was not my
fault that I was dug out. If they had
waited a short time longer they r would
have had a chance to go to my funeral."
As the pate receipts amounted to only
$1" BO Ferdlnan 'does not intend to give
another exhibition of suspended anima
tion in this city. .'"- .:- :â 
Emporium Fishing Club's Catch.

by the club was seventy-two pounds, con
sisting of sea trout, red tail and perch.

RETURNS TO
HIS SAD HOME
Is Completely Broken
Down With Sorrow.
WILL REMAIN HERE A WEEK
HE IS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS
WIFE AND BROTHER.
A Requiem Mass Will Be Celebrated
For His Deceased Parents'
Souls To - Morrow
Forenoon.
James J. Corbett arrived In the city late
last night on the overland train from New
York to attend the funeral of his deceased
parents. He was accompanied by his wife
and his youngest brother. Tom. Corbett
is greatly ostrated with grief, and It
will be a long time before he will recover
from the shock.
Early yesterday afternoon Harry and
Frank Corbett, brothers of Jim, with
Charles King, their brother-in-law, went
to Benicla to meet the sad trio. Joe Cor
bett met them at the Oakland pier. Im
mediately on their arrival on this side of
t..e bay they were driven to the Corbett
residence on Hayes street, where the rest
of the family were assembled.
Corbett showed great emotion last
night, and had very little to say to news
paper representatives.
"Everybody knows why I am out here,"
said he. "I do not know how long I shall
remain here, but shall certainly be here
for a week. Before Igo away I may have
something to say to the papers, but at
present you must please excuse me from
taking.
No reference was made to his match
with McCoy, but it is more than probable
that the contest will be postponed In
definitely.
Solemn requiem mass will be celebrated
to-morrow at 10 o'clock at Sacred Heart
Church by Rev. Father Flood for the re
pose of the souls of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Corbett, at which all of the friends of the
deceased are invited to attend. The Inter
ment at Holy Cross Cemetery will be
strictly private.
Two Boy Thieves.
Rofe and Philip Moroso. 11 and 8 years
old, respectively, were arrested by Offi
: cer Silver last evening and booked at the
i California Street Station for petit lar
1 ceny. The boys were seen coming out of
the New Clay Street Market, and they
had in their possession two automatic
i stamps, two padlocks and a ball of twine
; which had been taken from the Market.

ROSETTE IN HER
OLD-TIME FORM
Crack Greyhound From
Curtis' Kennel Wins.
SHE DEFEATS A STRONG FIELD
J. H bossetee;s metallic THE
RUNNER-UP.
Brilliant Sport at Union Coursing
Park Spoiled Toward the End
by a Very Heavy
Fog.
Rosette, the speedy black daughter of
Emm Pasha signalized her return to
form by winning the open stake handily
at Union Coursing Park yesterday.
Among the dogs she retired in various
rounds of the stake were: Grasshopper
Douglas. Magnet, Maad S (her kennel
mate) and finally Metallic, the imported
English dog, property of J. H. RÂ°sseter.
Coupled with the manner with which
Rosette performed throughout the day,
was the remarkable consistency shown by
all the dogs sporting the colors of Curtis
& Son. Of the four dogs left for the next
to the final round three represented their
kennel. As an illustration how blod will
tell, it is only necessary to say that these
are' all brothers and sisters, being by
Emm Pasha-Rockette.
J. H. Rosseter pinned his faith to Firm
Friend, who, however, was hardly in the
running. He worked his way into the
third round where he was retired by
Miller's Maid. The hare favored the Maid
and after an extremely long course she
secured the decision. --Â.,. Â« ,
For a time it appeared that the nnal
course would not be necessary, as it was
thought Cavalier would retire Metallic,
thus leaving the three dogs of Curtis &
Son in. When the dogs met, however.
Metallic led to the hare, secured the turn
and won, shutting out Cavalier. Tho
etuke then lay between Rosette and
Metallic. They opened at evens in the
betting, but Rosette was soon installed
favorite, the odds lengthening to 5 to 3.
The result was never in doubt from the
moment the dogs left the slips. Rosette
led in a straight run up and killed, win
ning the stake. The latter part of the
day's sport was marred by the fog which
obscured most of the running. The de
tailed results were:
Open stake, second round â Curtis & Son s
Cavalier beat Pasha Kennel's Rich and Art

LOTTIE M WINS.
The Champion Stake Was Postponed
at Ingleside on Account of
the Fog.
Thpre was a larpe crowd In attendance
yesterday at the Ingleside Coursing Park
to witness the competition for the cham
pion and non-winners' stake. The hareÂ«
were unusually fleet, the weather in the
earlier part of the day fine, and had it
not been for the big banks of fog that
rolled in from the ocean toward the
close of the day's sport it might have
been one of the most successful day's
coursing- this year.
The non-winners'' stake was captured by
Lottie M in handy fashion, but the finals
in the champion stake between Conne
mara and Billy Gladstone were post
poned by Judge Grace until next Sunday
on acount of the fog. Mr. Grace refus
ing to judge the champion final round
unless the weather waa clear and the
betting public able to view the race. The
betting public yesterday broke about even,
as in the earlier part of the day the
short ends won and toward the last the
favorites secured all the money. Billy
Gladstone was the surprise of the day,
being runner up against such good dogs
as Rosie R, Johnny R and Hadiwist.
me results were as follows:

ROGER B. CORNELL
BESTS SID CAVILL
DEFEAT OF AUSTRALIA'S CHAM
PION SWIMMER.
The Contestants Raced Around the
Seal Rocks â Good Programmes
at the Park, Cliff and
Chutes.
Sutro's Baths was the Mecca of pleas
ure-seekers yesterday. The park, the
Cliff House and the Chutes all had their
attractions, but the swimming contests at
the baths drew the crowds. The feature
of the programme was a swim over a.
course of something over a mile, which
carried the contestants far and beyond
the Seal Rocks. Sid Cavill, champion of
Australia, and Roger B. Cornell, cham
pion rough-water swimmer of the Pacific
Coast, were billed to make the swim, and
thousands of spectators assembled at the
bathe and along the beach to witness the
match. It was about 3 o'clock In tho -Â»f- j
ternoon when arrangements were com
pleted. Both men, attired in light cos- j
tumes, met at the west side of the baths.
In the belts worn by the swimmers keen
edged dirKS were secured, arms with
which to fight off inquisitive seals and
combative sea lions. The contestants
plowed their way through the surf to the
starting line, and when they were abreast j
of it Edward Mowry, judge of aquatic |
contests, nred his revolver and the race i
was on. Cavill, who defeated Cornell in
a 220-yard dash the preceding week, was a
strong favorite. He was "leary" of the
currents and eddies, however, and fell in
behind Cornell in order that the local man
might pick out the proper course and
avoid danger. When opposite the Seal
Rocks a number of seals dropped with a j
splash into the water and swam rapidly i
toward the contestants, who. in accord
ance with a prearranged plan, closed up
in order to assist each other in case of an
attack. Morris tfehn, a boatman, whose
services were secured to follow the swim
mers, also shot his skiff up in order to
lend a helping hand, but it was not re
quired. The seals were simply inquisitive,
and after following for fifty yards or so
turned and swam back to the rocks. Cor
nell then took the lead again. Both men
swam splendidly in the swell, but Cavill
seemed to be taking things easy. When [
within a hundred yards of the shore he !
easily closed o- the gap between himself
and his opponent, and looked as though :
he would prove an easy winner. The
swimmers neared the beach, and Cavill
turned to await an incoming breaker to
carry him to s..ore. Cornell did not He
struggled on. When the breaker lifted
Cavill up onto the sands Cornell was eight
or ten feet ahead, and was declared the
winner. Cornell's victory was applauded
by thousands of spectators, many of
whom expected to see him left far in the
wake of the Australian champion.
Next bunday Cavill and Cornell will
swim 830 yarns in the big tank in the
baths. This will be the deciding contest.
Cavill won the first. Cornell came out
victor yesterday, and to which the medal
and purse will go will be known next
Sunday.
In the fifty-yard dash handicap race for
novices E. Denny won and H. Searight
took second prize. R. Dahl won the un
der-water swimming contest, and was
awarded a silver medal for his victory.
In the aerial diving contest, open only to
professionals. Fred Green of this city car
ried off the purse.
The programmes at the Park, Cliff and
Chutes were exceptionally good.
America and the Philippines.
"America's Privilege in the Philip
pines" was presented by Rev. H. T.
Shepard at Olivet Congregational Church,
Seventeenth and Noe streets, yesterday
morning in an interesting sermon, in
â which he held that the American people
owe it to the Philippines that they shall
not be returned to the merciless arms of
their false and unnatural foster mother,
Spain. , .
"This is the least we can do. he said,
"and be true to ourselves. We have en
couraged the Luzon insurgents to expect
freedom from Spain's misrule. They, like
the Cubans, have been oppressed. If
starvation has been less in the Philip
pines than in Cuba, extortion and moral
degradation have been greater. The
American people will be criminally false
to their trust and morally weak if they
consent to a return of the islands to
Spain, thus leading them back to the
door of commercial and moral death."

THE RAILWAYS ACTION
IS APPRECIATED
.:â  BERKELEY TO RETURN THE
COMPLIMENT.
' They Will Buy a Stand of Colors for
' â  the Ferryboat Named After
Their Town.
BERKELEY. Aug. 21.â is now under
. stood from the officials of the Southern
f Pacific Railway Company that the new
ferryboat, to be launched in September, is
: -to be called the Berkeley. The merchants ,
.and' residents' of 'ttf? university town feel
â¢ much gratified over the railway com- ]
.pany'e action in this regard, and they are !
â¢ -preparing to return the compliment. Presi
dent J. \V. Richards of tne Board of Trus
' tees has suggested that the new steamer j
be provided with a handsome stand of col
ors, and the suggestion has been received
very favorably so far. If the present plans
â¢are carried out, the flags will be ready for
r.tation in time to be used on the j
boat as it slips into the bay.
President Richards would like the Board |
of Trustees to take official action in the j
matter, but seeing this to be impossible, j
he'intends to appoint a citizens* committee
to carry the proposal into effect. This
committee will be composed of two mem
bers from each precinct In the town. They
will be asked to solicit public subscrip- â¢
tions from the residents of their own pre
cincts, the subscriptions not to exceed $1
each. As soon as sufficient money is ob- .
tamed the committee will be charged with
the -duty of selecting and purchasing the |-
â¢colors, and they will be officially presented
/to- the Southern Pacific Company.
"" "Regent J. B. Reinstein of the University !
â¢-'of California is also known to be lnterest
ed In .the naming of the new steamer, and
.â¢he is planning to return the compliment
/*p behalf of the State University. He
.would like to have the panels of the in

"Views- of the different buildings on the
â¢â â Co-liege campus as they are to appear

As evidence that the purported interviews with ex-Queen Lllluokalani
printed in the Chronicle and Examiner were the baldest sort of fakes, the
subjoined letter from the dethroned ruler of Hawaii is ample and suf

The results of the contests of the first

Important to breeders of light harness
horses in California. So extraordinary
was the racing from a time standpoint,
so exciting from a spectacular point of
view, that the greatest of enthusiasm
prevailed, and the immediate revival of
the great American sport, contests be
tween trotters and pacers, looks cer
tain.
The performance of the "new" three
year-old trotting gelding Who Is It was
a record-breaking one, for when he
trotted In 2:12 he took a second and a
quarter off the best on record. His
owner, A. G. Gurnett, president of the
San Francisco Stock Exchange, Is so con
fident he possesses a champion that he
offers to match his young gray ghost for
$5000 against any three-year-old gelding
in the United States, provided the race
comes off upon a California track within
sixty days. Who Is It was trained at
Pleasanton, and late last spring capable
judges pronounced him the coming cham
pion, notwithstanding he had never
"come up for the word." He made his
mark of 2:12 in the second heat of the
2:18 trot, defeating May B and Myrtle
Thorne.
Mr. Gurnett, owner of Who Is It, Is an
enthusiast over fast light harness per
formers, and is one of the directors of
the Pacific Coast Trotting Horse Dreed
ers' Association, under whose au.spices
the Santa Rosa meeting is held. Much
Better's three heats in 2:1O 1^ in the 2:13
class pare was another notable showing,
and I. Direct, by Direct, 2:OSVi, paced a
second heat in 2:13 in the 2:19 class race.
Peter Williams' chestnut horse beat Zom
bro and Mamie Griffin in the free-for-.'Ul
trot in 2:11, 2:11, after Zombro had taken
the first heat In 2:13.
The Hat of entries to the trotting and
pacing races at the State Fair meeting,
which begins Monday. September 5, is
exceedingly gratifying to the manage
ment. Ail the events are well tilled. The
first day there will be the 3:00 trot, 2:17
trot, 3:00 pace and 2:IH pace. On Wed
nesday, September 7, the 2:12 class pace,
mile and repeat, comes off, with such
good ones in it as Hi jo del Diablo, Flora
cit.i, Betty Gentry, Prince Almont, Beach
wood, Sophia X, .Bernard, Fitz Lee, Hex
Alto, Little Thorne and the Santa Rosa
winner, Much Better. On Friday, the
9th, Toggles, Zombro, Monterey, Galette
and Mamie Griffin meet in the 2:10 class
trot, and Monday, the 12th, a big Held of
good nries comes up for the word in the
2:15 class pu'.tv. and on the 14th many in
the 2:15 pace meet in the class pace.
On Friday, the 16th, a grand programme
is presented, consisting of the free-for-all
trot, 2:16 trot, 2:20 trot and 2:23 pace.
The stakes for the gallopers at the
State Fair meeting filled pretty well,
though the entries are not as numerous
as Last year or in 1596. Among the events
we note the Dewey and the Shafter
stakes, and in the list of entries are such
onÂ«B as Jiuckwa, Scarborough, the
once-great Qilead, Colonel Wneeler, Shas
ta Water, Harry Thoburn, Cromwell,
Wheel <;f Fortune and Grady among the
older horses. In the two-year-old stakes
are Magdalenas, Bonibel, Ucorona, Cross
melina, Obsidian, Midlove, Hauler, Fever
sham, Ann Page, Jennie Held, Casdale,
Llmewattr, Modwena and others, many
of unknown ability, making matters all
the more interesting. Among the three
year-olds entered are Marplot, El Moro,
Miss Rowena, Arbaces, Plan, Charles Le
Bel, Racio, Barney Schrelber, Valen
cienne, Los Prietos and Highland Ball.
John C. Humphrey secured the betting
privileges, paying $12,500 for the twelve
days.
Tod Sloan rode out one winner on Fri
day at Saratoga and three on Saturday.
On the afternoon of the latter day there
were five races, Clawson piloting the first
winner, T. Sioan the next three, and
George' Cochran the successful one in the
jump (Forget). This certainly gives a
strong California flavor to the racing at
the Springs.
The California and Oregon horses did
well at Buffalo. N. V.. on Friday and Sat
urday last. On the first-named day Che
hallis paced the third, fourth and fifth
heats in 2:06, Frank Agan winning the
first and second in 2:OSVi. t.vih*. On Fri
day at Anaconda, Mont., four of the six
races were won by California-bred horses,
and in another great event one was sec
ond at the finish. Saturday at Anaconda
the winners, Torlblo, R. Q. Ban. Charlotte
M. and Miss Rowena. are from the sta
bles of California turfmen. Charlotte M.'s
was a Btake win. She belongs to the es
tate of B. C. Holly. At Buffalo on Sat-
urday Anaconda, the pacer, barred in the
betting on account of the race being con
ceded to him. won in three straight *ieats;
time, 2:07. 2:08, 2:08%.

To the surprise of thousands of people,
there were no more raids at Hawthorne,
and the meeting closed Saturday without
further trouble, though everything. looked
ripe for a genuine battle on Monday after
noon. August 15. . The defeated deputy
constables were anxious to get even, and
Corrigan and his crowd had made prepa
rations to hold the fort at any cost.
Leading turfmen having the interests of
the turf at heart took the matter in hand
in time however, and. It is said, com
pelled the combatants, Corrigan and
Brenock, to talk over their troubles. Then
the argument on the injunction was con
tinued. Finally Justice Prindiville was
seen, and he called in the fourteen war
rants for the arrest of Corrigan's hench
men After all loopholes for trouble had
been closed the horsemen prevailed upon
John Brenock to give in first, because he
was the one who had begun the legal pro
ceedings. . ... .
Brenock claimed It "was his friends who
had stirred up the pot of trouble. Fur
ther he swears he ordered his men on
the unlucky 13th not to flo any fighting,
telling thpm if they could not. get inside
the Hawthorne Park gates to quietly go
away Monday night Corrigan, Brenock.
their lawyers and several turfmen met In
the Monadnock building, and as every

STOLEN IN SINGAPORE.
Korea Is to Be Surveyed and Amer

Employed to Do the
Work.
The officers of the British steamer Glen
farg, which arrived from Hongkong last
Saturday, gave some interesting informa
tion of happenings in the Orient. An
American ship captain was in jail at
Canton awaiting trial on a charge of
murder before the United States Consular
Court; the Sultan of Sulu. a vassal of
Spain, was robbed of his crown and the
crown jewels at Singapore; Captain Sel-

mer of the steamer Chamroeri was mur
dered by a coolie In Siam and the Korean
Government has derided to survey the en
tire country and is making arrangements
through the United States Ministers to
have the work done by Americans.
The rebellion in South China resulted in
the defeat of the imperial troops, and
over 1500 of the latter were killed. For
days the dead bodies of the latter were
floating down the river, and over a thou
sand of them were taken out of the water
and buried. When the Chinese Govern
ment heard of the defeat it immediately
dispatched 1000 soldiers up the river from
Canton to Wuchau, where the fighting
ha.i taken place. Some of these soldien
went on the American sieamer loosing,
Captain Thurlmann. On arriving at Vu
chau, the captain asserts, there was a
mutiny among the crew and an attempt
made "by the sailors and the Chinese
ashore to butcher the soldiers. The Chi
nese compraiiure, who was looking after
the vessel's cargo, got mixed up in the
row, and Captain Thulmann snot him
Then there was trouble. The friends of
the dead man were furious, ami offered
$5000 for the Yankees head. Tnited States
Consul Bedloe at Canton was telegraphed
to and he at once issued orders for the
murderer to be brought to Canton. This
was done, and Captain Thulmann for
safety was put aboard the British
steamer Kong-pak and locked up in
an iron cage. The Chinese are
very much wrought up over the matter
and assert that they will demand indem
nity from the United States for the mur
der of their countryman. They have sent

DEPARTURE OF THE
TRANSPORT ARIZONA
WILL ARRIVE AT MANILA IN
SIDE OF 19 DAYS.
C eneral Miller Boards the Vessel and
t Receives Instructions From
General Merriam.
At 11:20 yesterday morning the trans
port Arizona weighed anchor and began
moving slowly toward the Golden Gate.
The big ship was an object of much inter
est to the crowds that lined the wharves
along the water front. The Arizona will
reach Honolulu next Friday and will
probably not remain there over one day.
Rhe will arrive at Manila inside of nine
teen days from San Francisco.
The departure of General Merriam for
Honolulu leaves General Marcus P. Mil
ler in command of the remaining expedi
tionary forces. In addition to this re
sponsibility General Miller has the affairs
of the Presidio and the First Brigade to
administer. General Miller said yester
day regarding the order in which the
troops will be sent to Honolulu: "Those
to go to Manila on the Scandia have
been assigned, and General Merriam has
ordered that the Seventh California shall
be designated for Honolulu on the next
transport that is first ready to sail after
the Scandia gets away. The order In
which the remaining troops are to be
sent is left entirely in my power and as
yet I have not decided upon which will
go first."
General Miller and staff, and a number
of the commanding officers at the Pre
sidio went out on the McDowell and met
the Arizona at Goat Island and accom
panied her to the Golden Gate. General
Miller went aboard the transport and had
a conference with General Merriam, from
whom it is presumed he received final
instructions regarding the administration
of military affairs of the department.
War Incidents.
The incident of the Tennessee regiment
and the Thomas family is practically con
sidered closed. With the preferment of
charges by lieutenant Fowler against
Privates Davis, Scruggs, Anderson and
Clarke, General Miller appointed a court
martial to try the men. This court will
convene this week and the men will be
tried Immediately. General Miller ex
pects the reply of Colonel Smith to the
complaint of the Thomas family asking
for damages, which was submitted to
him. It will probably be sent in l>y
Colonel Smith to-day, and then the board
of officers to assess the damages will be
appointed by General Miller.
The following deaths occurred at the
division field hospital yesterday: Private
Liouis Georgeson. Company D, First Ne

SAND CRABS
IRE SHUT OUT
Athletics Win Another
Victory With Ease.
PLAY VERY FAST BASEBALL
JOHNSON WHACKS OUT A HOME
BUN OFF BALZ.
An. Interesting Game in Which the
Santa Cruz Team fails to
Connect With the
Plate.
The Athletics put another feather in
their cap yesterday by defeating the
Santa Cruz team with the score boards
reading 7âo. Two games in a week and
the very finest ball is their record. Not
an error blotted their column Saturday,
and but three were made in the game
yesterday, which was full of life and
ginger, pleasing the crowd of enthusiasts
who filled the bleachers and grand stands.
For a brief moment it looked as if the
men from the sea beach were going to
assert themselves and send a blue jacket
over the plate, but, alas, they died be
fore that roal was reachedâ Burge with
his linger tips straining to touch the rub
ber and Balz by not knowing the dan
gers of careless base running. The credit
of the yictory belongs, in a great measure,
to the steady pitching of Fitzpatrick.
But four hits were made off his delivery
and they were practically the work of an
inning. Balz was touched for ail varie
ties of hits until the seventh, when It
was deemed best to substitute E. Dau
benbis. This proved a wiM stroke, as
but a single run was added to the column
after the change.
The Athletics started out well, sending
McLaughlin across the plate in the -first
inning. Johnson, the first man up In the
second inning, nonchalantly swung his
bat at the ball and it was seen no more.
It rests on a roof of one of the houses
on a line with second base. Ford scored
the second run in this inning. In the
third Stulz made the score read 5 to 0.
Then nothing of any importance was done
by the Athletics until the sixth, when
Hlldebrand whacked out a double. Ford
followed and was given his base on balls.
Hildebrand stole third and Ford went to
second. A passed ball took Hlldebrand
off the base? and soon after Ford fol
lowed in his footsteps, taking advantage
of a sacrifice hit by Peters.
The sixth was the banner Inning for
the visitors. Burge werit to first nn an
error of Hildebrand. Then Balz hit to
center and Burge took second. Mclntyre
hit to left field safely and Burge attempt
ed to score on it. He was put out at
home. Then Peters threw to second to
stave off Mclntyre, and Balz forgot him
self in his ardor to reach a haven, and
he was caught coming home. But the
blow which hurt was when Deveraux
batted out a sure double, but he was
thinking of the Maine and forgot every
thing else, even the fact that there was
such a thing as a first base, which ho
did not touch, and the umpire accord
ingly counted him out. nullifying the run
of McTntyre. who had already crossed the
plate.
The score is as follows:

"SUGAR BEETS" LOSE.
They Were Badly Handicapped by a
Substitute Pitcher.
WATSONVILLE. Aug. 21.â An immense
audience was present to-day to witness
the contest between the Watsonvilles and
Oaklands. Previous to the game Pitcher
Donlin, who bore signs of having lately
had a tussle with John Barleycorn, ap
proached Manager Baxter and demanded
$15, which he claimed was due him. Bax
ter informed him that he was paid to date
and even ahead. Donlin in return abused
Baxter in a vile manner and refused to
play ball. Baxter then suspended him for
thirty days without pay. Afterward Don
lin wanted to play, but it was too late
Manager Baxter's action is unanimously
Indorsed by all patrons of the game. Dur
ing the six months Donlin has played here
he has been royally treatedâ ln fact far
better than he deserves. While he is a
good pitcher and an all around ball player
his conduct Is against him. He has been
no sooner out of one local scrape than he
hns got himself into another. Hayes, who
lays no pretensions to being a pitcher,
twirled for the Watsonvilles to-day. Both
teams put up excellent ball, particularly
the "Sugar Beets," considering the dis"
cou raging circumstances of the morning
with Donlin. The fielding of both nines
was excellent. The Watsonville club is
going to be heard from in the League. All
they lack is a reliable pitcher, and that
they propose to have. The score follows:

DR, J. F. MORSE,
THE SURGEON,
IS NO MORE
The Noted Physician
Died Yesterday.
HIS FAME WAS WORLD-WIDE
DEATH DUE TO HEMORRHAGE
OF THE BRAIN.
Overwork Broke His Constitution.
The Career of a Man the State
Can 111 Afford to
Lose.
Dr. John F. Morse, the eminent physl
cian and surgeon, and chairman of the
State Board of. Health, died at 4:30 o'clock
yesterday morning. The cause of death
â was hemorrhage of the brain, superin
duced by overwork and nervous strain.
For two months prior to his last illness
his friends and physicians had advised
him to rest before he broke down. This
he promised to do when nis "patients
c <\-Ad spare him." The occasion came
â with his untimely death.
Deceased was the son of the late Dr.
John P. Morse, a pioneer and founder of
the c.rder of Odd Fellows in Germany and
elsewhere in Kurope. The young man
graduated In the year of his majority
from the Medical College of the Pacific as
valedictorian. He .later studied in the |
Heidelberg University and the University
of Berlin, where he took his degree In
1881, and thereafter visitea the principal
hospitals and clinics of the lar~e Euro- j
pean cities, returning to San Francisco in |
1882. He began practice at once with the :
eminent surgeon, the late Dr. William A. j
Douglass, and assisted Dr. Doiglass as a i
visiting surgeon of the City and County
Hospital for six years. In the year 18S3 he
became surgeon of the German Hospital
of this city and remained such till his j
death.
On account of his skill and popularity :
the demand on his energies was enor- I
mous, but he stood it bravely to the last. !
During the past few years he has per- |
formed from four to five capital opera
tions daily, and In the three weeks prior
to his illness he executed n'me operations â 
for appendicitis. The great surgeon al- :
most fainted at the last two operations, :
and went to his bed of death on the Bth :
in.st. He failed rapidly, the vital machin- j
cry seeming to have been totally worn I
out. and the efforts of his friends and
physicians to relieve him were futile. He j
was attended by Drs. De Vecchi. Baum. i
1- rzgibbons, Kerr and McMonagle.
Dr. Morse's fame as an original, quick,
bold and successful surgeon was world
wide. When but 29 years of age he per
formed the first successful operation for
aneurism of the abdominal aorta. This
brought him congratulations from the
greatest surgeons of the world, especial
ly from Professor Czerny of Heidelberg
and Verneuil, the eminent surgeon of
Paris. This operation was but one of !
many unique and marvelous perform
ances. One of his secrets of success was
that he personally watched every detail i
which might effect success and never left
his patient while anything could be done i
to afford relief. No sacrifice of time or
labor was too great for him, and as a
consequence he had a great host of warm
friends, who will sincerely mourn his
111-timed death. One of his marked char- i
acteristics was diffidence and the great I
Verneuil, on recording in his celebrated j

San Francisco County Medical Society,
a member of the State and American
Medical Associations and has held of

president of the Board of Health he made
a tour of the Eastern cities last year to
study and report on the methods of the
various boards of health. Ho would

Dr. Morse was prominent in many civic
organizations. Including the Odd Fel

A GREAT RUN.
Olympic Cyclers Enjoy Their Annual
Outing at Uncle Tom's Cabin.
The Olympic Cyclers reveled in a day's
outing yesterday and the hundred partici
pants were unanimous in pronouncing it
the most enjoyable run In the history of
the club. Starting at 9 o'clock under the
leadership of Captain Shay, the riders left
the club building at a fast clip, which was
sustained until they reached the scene of
Jollity, Uncle Tom's Cabin. Those who
did not accompany the bikers went down
on the train to San Bruno and were driven
over to the Cabin in teams.
Once at the resort the fun began. Bicy
cle races of an impromptu order, baseball
games and general athletics engaged the
attention of all until noon, when an elab
orate lunch was spread on the verandas
of the club house. In the afternoon an
entertainment was furnished by the com
edians of the club. Bob Mitchell did his
portion of the work and Ed Holland was a
close second. An orchestra producing
every variety of musical composition and
a quartet of exceptional vocal ability were
the features of the afternoon's entertain
ment, which ended in time for the cyclers
to return to the city at a seasonable hour.
Another social run will be held by the cy
clers in the near future, with the resting
place somewhere in the far end of Marin
County.
First Baptist Church Peace Service.
Dr. E. A. Woods presided at a peace ser
vice in the First Baptist Church laat
night. Captain Schliemann of the Twen
tieth Kansas Regiment delivered the
first address of the evening. Af
ter giving thanks for the peace
which had come over the land he referred
to the brilliant achievement of Admiral
Dewey. "God has given this great victory
to these glorious United States," he said,
"and it is for us to make the best use of
It. Chivalry, that most beautiful precept
which actuates the heart of man, has
been well exemplified in. the American na
tion, although I note with sorrow its de
cadence in Spain. We have seen a coun
try rise up in behalf of an oppressed peo
ple and say, 'We do not want your terri
tory nor your money, but this inhumanity
must cease.' Spain had never learned the
lesson of humanity until we taught It to
her, and I say there must be peace in
Cuba if we have to whip her again to get
it. This example of the United States will
make forever Impossible the atrocities
which have been comitted by Spain in her
possessions. We have extended our own
empire. Whatever new lands we may ac
quire we must see to it that the Prince of
Peace shall dwell there, for there can be
no true peace until righteousness is es
tablished on this earth. Our mission must
be to do away with oppression on those
islands and to give them self government.
The natives shall not only be free physic
ally but spiritually."
Chaplain Lelnnd of the Tennessee regi
ment and Private J. B. Creighton of the
New York Volunteers also addressed the
congregation in a similar vein.

GRIM DEATH
IS HOVERING
OVER HER COT
Madeline Bouton Not
Expected to Live.
PERITONITIS HAS SET IN
MUST UNDERGO ANOTHER SUR
GICAL OPERATION.
Rallied Somewhat Yesterday, Al
though for the Past Week Her
Condition Has Been
Most Precarious.
Dashing Madeline Bouton is not expect
ed to live. Peritonitis has set In and
the actress is pronounced by her physician
to be in a most precarious condition.
The last resortâ another operation â is
now but a matter of a day or so, and
must depend entirely upon the strength
of the patient, who unfortunately at pres
ent, is in a very weak state.
Miss Bouton, late leading lady of the
popular Frawley Company, injured her
self while rehearsing her famous dance,
which she introduced in "Lostâ 24 Hours."
Instead of immediately seeking the aid of
medical assistance, the actress continued
to pursue her professional duties, until
her health was broken.
Only after fainting dead away upon
the stage did the lady consent to heed
the admonitions of her medical adviser
and go to a sanitarium for complete rest
in the hopes of recuperating.
Dr. Winslow Anderson had charge of
Miss Bouton's case and counseled an oper
ation, which was performed at the Mc-
Nutt hospital on Sutter street about two
weeks ago. After the operation, the pop
ular actress began to mend rapidly until
a week ago, when she suddenly had a
reaction. Since then she has gradually
grown worse and yesterday her physician
decided upon another operation as the
last resort.
When seen yesterday Dr. Anderson had
not lost all hope as to the possible recov
erey of his fair patient. While admit
ting that the lady's condition was ex
tremely critical, a slight change for the
better, during the day, was hailed by the
doctor as a good omen. He affirmed the
report that another operation would have !
to be performed, and declared that even
with every chance in her favor it would
be many weeks before the beautiful ac
tress could be pronounced convalescent.'
No one is allowed to see Miss Bouton,
and no message from the outside world
Is carried to Tier. Her mother is con
stant in her attendance, and she, the
doctor and her pretty, saint-I!ke nurse
are the only persons permitted in the
sick room where one of the most beauti
ful women of the American stage lies
tossing on her bed of pain and possible
death.
LANDING OF THE FRENCH.

J. P. DOING'S
BLONDE FRIEND
STILL ELUSIVE
She Is a Pretty Widow,
Once From Chicago.
HER NAME IS MRS. SEELEY
MURDERED WOMAN'S HUSBAND
TELLS OF OTHERS.
He Wrote Loving Letters to His
Wife and Mrs. Botkin WhilÂ©
He Was at the Seat
of War.
The escapades of John P. Dunning, ex
manager of the Associated Press in this
city, are being investigated to discover, if
possible the identity of the person who
sent the box of poisoned candy to his wife
infDover, Del., by which means two un
suspecting women were foully murdered
Late last night a Call reporter learned
the name of the mysterious blonde woman
who was one of Dunning's intimate com
panions. She is Mrs. Soeley, a widow,
who formerly lived In Chicago She was
at one time a very warm friend of Mrs,.
W. A. Botkin, another of Dunning s boon
companions. ,
Mrs. Susan M. Moore, who was the land
lady at No. 927 Geary street when Dun
ning and Mrs. Botkin boarded there, gives
some interesting information concerning
Mrs. Seeley. ,
"This Mrs. Seeley came very frequently
to my house to play cards with Mr. Dun
ning and Mrs. Botkin," said she yester
day "She was a pretty woman and looked
quite young, although Mrs. BotKin aner
ward told me she was about 37. 1 acci
dentally met Mrs. Seeley one evening
when going into Mrs. Botkin's room witn
a pitcher or water. Mrs. Botkin's son and
Mr Dunning were there. After Mrs. see
ley had been introduced to me sho talked
a few minutes and told me that she came
from Chicago and was out on the coast to
spend a winter and to have a good time.
Sne was a blonde, with light bfown hair
and blue eyes. She was tastefully dressed
and seemed to have money. I do not know
where she lived, but she came to visit
Mrs. Botkin quite often. I think she wad
originally a friend of Mrs. Botkin.
"Later on the two women had a violent
quarrel over something and never made
up. They did not speak. Then came
something queer. Mrs. Seeley tried to
marry Mrs. Botkin's son, who was only
22. Mrs. Botkin said to me that it was
only for spite. The son went to Stock
ton last year and Mrs. Seeley followed
him. It was announced that they wore
to be married. Mrs. Botkin hurried after
them and the marriage did not take
place. The way that I understood it was
broken off was thiit Mrs. Seeley found
that young Botkin had no money. That
\v;is what she was after, I think. Since
then I do not know what became of her.
"But I tell you she was altogether too
lively! Why one night I had to go up
to the door of the room where they were
having a card party and tell them to
be quiet, as the other roomers were com
plaining. Theyâ Mrs. Beeley, Dunning and
Mrs. Botkinâ were laughing at the top of
their voices. Mrs. Seeley was amusing
thorn by climbing up on the shoulders of
Mrs. Seeley'a son, standing up straight
and then leaping off upon the floor! The
floor shook and a boarder down stairs.
Mr. Craft, told me he was afraid the
chandelier would come down on his head."
"Was Dunning mixed up in the quar
rel?" was asked.
"I don't know what it was all about.
It was very bitter, however. T)unning
and his lady friends used to drink largo
quantities of whisky. They would leave
whisky bottles scattered around In their
rooms after a card party. They drank to
OTCmro I was glad when they went away.
They never could have remained in my
house if I had not needed the room rent.
Mrs. Botkin had a room on the Fame floor
with Mr. Dunning and they were much
together. They went out frequently to
gether. In the evening with Mrs. Seeley
they enjoyed themselves usually in Mrs.
Botkin's room. No other women ever
came, so far as I knew. Nor were there
any other men, except occasionally Mrs.
Botkin's son. Once in a while they would
invite Mme. Thompson, a music teacher,
who roomed across the hall, to partici
pate In their card games. She was a per
fect lady and never took part in any of
their boisterous doings. She was only in
there with them once or twice. One day
I went into the room nnd saw a photo
graph of Mr. Dunning's little girl and I
said to him. 'It's too bad that you have
to be separated po much from your fam
ily.' The time that Mrs. Botkin remained
with me was about three months. After
Mr. Dunning left Mrs. Botkin sajd that
she didn't caro to stay longer, and soon
packed up and departed. I did not keep
track of her after that. I was too glad
to have them leave."
Dunning traveled the "primrose way" at
a lively pace after his wife went East
about "two years ago. He played the
races, drank heavily, associated with
women and finally lost his position. Dur
ing this period of dissipation Dunning's
friends and acquaintances frequently saw
him at the races and elsewhere with a
short, middle-aged woman, who is de
scribed as an "English brunette." She
was apparently about 40 years old. and
was not a familiar figure around town.
Mrs. W. A. Botkin, a married woman
living apart from her husband, fits the
above description. She is known to have
been a very close friend of Dunning. They
roomed at the same house and frequently
visited the racetrack together. Mrs. Bot
kin has been living In Healdsburg with
her sister for some time. Last week, when
she learned of the murder of Mrs. Dun
ning, she went to Stockton, where her
husband resides. Whether or not she has
any knowledge of the tragedy Is not yet
known.
Prior to his wife's departure for her
home about two years ago Dunning' s
chief vices were drinking and gambling.
His wife endeavored by every means in
her power to reclaim him. but succeeded
only to a limited extent In checking his
downward career. She Induced him to
spend his evenings at home by inviting
friends to dinner and to play cards. It
is not known that he had any demoraliz
ing alliances at that time; he was simply
a victim of appetite and the gaming craze
was strong within him. ....
Freed from all restraint by the depart
ure of his wife, he soon found ties whic
alienated his affection from his family t
such a degree that he allowed his inamor
ata to read his wife's letters.
The theory of the murder which seem
plausible is that one of the women he ha
associated with, who was infatuated wit
Dunning, learning that he had reforme
and was about to return to his fam 1\
sent the candy to the unsuspecting wife
Intending to murder her, hoping subse
quentlv to wed the object of her affection
The 'only information the police ha\
on the double murder Is that which has
been published in the city newspapers.
"So far I have received no worl .from
the police authorities of Dover regardfn
the Dunning poisoning case,' said Chic
Lees yesterday. "They have not sent m
the wrapper that was around the candj
letters, or anything else."
"Have you not detailed an officer to look
into the "case?"
"We have nothing to work on except
what has appeared In the newspapers. I
did have an officer investigate stories of
Dunning's escapades, the interviews with
friends of Mr. and Mrs. Dunning which
appeared In The Call and other papers,
and found the statements In the main cor
rect. It strikes me. however, that Mrs.
W. A. Botkin. who was so well acquainted
with Dunning, according to her own re
ported admissions, ought to be ablo to tell
a sood deal about this case."
Mrs. Harry C. Good of IWS Ellis street,
who was one of Mrs. Dunning's most In
timate friends In this city, said yesterday:
"Mr. Dunning and his wife had a disa
greement of some sort about two years
ago. The Dunnings were very intimate
with our family and usually spent two
evenings each week at our house. Some
times they took their Sunday dinners
with us. W r hen Mrs. Dunning west East
in the fall two years ago. It was the un
derstanding that she would return about
Christmas. She told me she would be
back. About the holidays Mr. Good asked
M.T. Dunning -when his wife was coming
home, and he laughed and said, 'Oh, next
month, I guess.' But she didn't come,
and month after month went by with the
same statement from Mr. Dunning.
"Whatever the difficulty was between hus
band and wife, it was evidently patched
up lately, for I received a letter from
Mrs. Dunning, dated July 15 of this year,
in which she speaks happily of her hus
band's expected return from Porto Rico,
and that she expected to go to housekeep
ing with him in New York. She stated
that he had been offered a good position
on a New Yorw paper and would accept it.
"Please say for me that I do not believe
a word of the story that Dunning was at
tentive to Mrs. Corbaley. as might have
been inferred from a recent publication
of the Examiner. I have known Mrs.
Corbaley for years and the idea is pre
posterous. Mrs. Corbaley never attended
the races. She never went out with Dun
ning. She has been acquainted with the
Dunnings for a long time, which ac
counts for the fact that when her young
est son, J. C. Corbaley, was seriously in
jured in an explosion in San Francisco
three years ago he asked to have Mr.
Dunning notified. As Mrs. Corbaley was
out of town Dunning had the boy taken
to his own houso, paying to Mr. Good
that it was the best thing under the cir
cumstances. When Mrs. Corbaley ar
rived the next day she, of course, came
to minister to the son. The Litter wai
sick for three months at the Dunning
home. Some evil-minded busy-bodies
ma#r have made remarks, but there was
nothing in Mrs. Dunnlng-'s conversation
to indicate that she was displeased. My
theory of the case is that the person who
sent the poisoned candy to Mrs. Dun
ning knew of the friendship existing be
tween the Dunnings and Mrs. Corbaley
through statements made by Dunning
himself, and that the poisoner took ad
vantage of this knowledge when mark
ing the candy "From Mrs. C." to lead
Mrs. Dunning to suppose that Mrs. Cor
baley sent it. I know nearly all of the
former friends of Mrs. Dunning and
many of those of her husband, but none
of them can suggest any solution of the
mystery."
DUNNING'S STATEMENT.
He Gives the Names of Three "Women
With Whom He Was on Terms
of Intimacy.
DOVER, Del., Aug. 21.â John P. Dun
ning-, husband of the younger of ex-Con
gressman Pennlngton's daughters, who
were murdered by eating poisoned candy,
has at last consented to make a state
ment that will surely throw a great deal
i of light on the hitherto Impenetrable mys
j tery. There are three women In San
| Francisco with whom Dunning admits he
was intimately acquainted. The chief of
these is Mrs. W. A. Botkln of Stockton,
with whom Dunnlng's relations were
closer than either of the others. He ad
mits having written letters to her that
were full of pretty confidences and ex
pressions of love since leaving San Fran
cisco. This was at the very same time
j that he was writing the most affectionate
j letters to his wife here in Dover.
"I know ..Irs. Botkin very intimately,"
! he said to-day, "but I will not say now
: whether she was acquainted with my
wife. She did know, however, that I was
a married man, and it was with this
knowledge on her part that many letters
| passed between us from the time I said
good-by to her in San Francisco and came
Kast to go to the seat of war.
"I do not doubt that she still has many
I of those letters in her possession."
When questioned with reference to the
past that he proposed to live down, Dun
ning said:
"That is a matter that rests entirely
! between myself and the Associated Press
i and it cannot possibly have any connec
tion with the sending of a box of poi-
I soned candy to my wife. I must decline
to discuss it."
Of the history of his relations with Mrs.
Botkin Dunning said:
"Our first meeting was entirely the re
sult of an accident. It was a year and a
half or two years ago. I was riding my
bicycle in Golden Gate Park, San Fran
cisco when the wheel broke down near a
bench where two women were sitting. One
of thorn was Mrs. Bntkin.
"While I was making the necessary re
pairs to the bicycle I got into a conversa
tion with them, and went so far as to sit
down and talk with them after the wheel
had been mended. We simply introduced
ourselves without the slightest formality,
and as there was no objection on Mrs.
Botkin's part the acquaintance that was
begun there was continued."
He was then asked if he had any inti
mate acquaintance with a Mrs. Louise
Seeley or Ceeley in San Francisco.
This he tried to evade, but finally ad
mitted he had. He would not go into any
details of their relations to each other.
Another woman with whom Dunning
admits acquaintance in San Francisco is
Madame Thompson, a teacher of French,
who frequency sat in the card parties in
Mrs. Botkin's rooms. Of her he said to
night:
"It was at one of those card parties that
I met Madame Thompson. I saw her quite
often there and sometimes at the race
track."
"Have you any reason to suspect that
any of these women was connected with
the sending of poisoned candy?" Dunning
was asked.
"That is a question I shall not answer
now." was his reply.
"It Is something for the detectives to
work out, and my suspicions can have no
weight in the matter."
There has been frequent mention of a
blonde woman, thus far nameless, for
whom the San Francisco police are said
to be looking in connection with this case.
When asked about her. Dunning said:
"I have no recollection of any woman of
that description who could have any in
terest In the death of my wife."
Dunning has sent several telegraphic
messages to-night and there is reason to
believe that he is in communication with
friends in San Francisco who are inter
esting themselves in the case. He will not
admit, however, that such is the case, nor
that the mysterious "Mrs. C." is being
looked for by the police of San Fran
cisco. "He says he has had no consulta
tion with the State detectives or any of
the officials. He does not know how long
he may remain here, but says he may
leave within a day or two.
That pteps have been taken to exhume
the bodies of the two victims of the candy
Is certa;n. Mr. Pennlngton Is reconciled
to this measure, in the hope that some
light may be thus thrown on the mystery.
Deane strenuously opposes this plan, bat
the authorities, it is understood, will take
the case in their own hands and submit
the bodies of the two women to a poison
analysis.
SISTER COLUMBO CHOSEN.
Is Appointed Directress of St. Mary's
Hospital as Successor to
Mother Russell.
Sister Columbo has received the ap
pointment, through a unanimous vote of
the members of the various associate
communities of the Sisters of Mercy, as
successor to the late Mother Russell, as
the representative superior of the order
at St. Mary's Hospital.
The election, which was held under the
supervision of Archbishop Riordan. was
conducted by secret bauot. the sisters at
St Mary's Hospital, the Magdalen Asy
lum' St Peters School and St. Anthony's
School at East Oakland participating.
Mother Columbo arrived in this city
twenty years ago from Ireland to enter
the order of which she is now superior.
Soon after her arrival she took the veil,
the vows implied in the acceptance of
which she has strictly adhered to. leading
a life of piety and spreading the influence
of her good work to those who came un
der her care at the hospital and to those
of the outside world who were personally
acquainted with her.
The Fender Saved Her Life.
Freda Hahnn. a tiny maiden, 6 years of
age, narrowly escaped being ground to
death beneath the wheels of an electric
car of the Sutro line yesterday afternoon.
The car left its terminus shortly after 3
o'clock, and was on its way toward the
transfer point at Sutter street, and hod
reached Fourth avenue when the accident
occurred. The child ran onto the car
track at that point, and aparently the
clanging of the car gong bewildered her.
She turned first one way and then the
other in her endeavor to escape, and then
it was too late. H. W. Williams, the mo
tor-man, saw that his car would surely
strike the chli' and ho rapidly reversed
the current and dropped the fender. The
car stopped within a distance of about
fifteen feet, but the little girl had dis
appeared beneath it. The motorman. con
ductor and score of frightened passen
gers sprang on. expecting that it would
be their misfortune to have to drag a
little lifeless form from beneath the
wheels- but all were mistaken. The fen
der had done its work well, and the child
was lyto" across it. badly bruised but far
from "fatally injured. She was picked up
and carried to the offices of Dr. Cleary.
where her iniurles were dressed. She was
then taken to the home of her parents. No
one was to blame for the unfortunate ac
cident.
