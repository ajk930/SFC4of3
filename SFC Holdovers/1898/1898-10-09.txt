Commar.viery No. 1, of ?an Francisco,
the first visiting delegation of the
Knights Templar to reach Piusburg
to attend the twenty-ptrwnth Tri
ennial Conclave. arrived at 11:05
o'clock this morning on thÂ« i'
special train via the Pennsylvania
lir.es. There are 107 persons in the
party, includiriE; representatives >'f the
Golder. Gate, Oakland. Sacrament I
San Jose commanderies, and forty
three ladies. At Union station the Sir
fhts were met by A. J. Kd.vards,
W. 1. Mustiri and Jmsvl'li M
behalf of the r<<n.'kiv- j â  com
mittee, and Eli Edmundson and Herman
Junker, representatives of I'ittsburg
Commandery No. 1.
The visitors were escorted to their i
headquarters at the Hotel Henry by
Pittsburg Commandery No. 1, with
twenty-five mounted men and seventy
five on foot In full uniform. The proces- j
sion was headed by the Allegheny
Knights Templar brnd with thirty- five
musicians. The line of march was
down Liberty avenue to Wood, to Fifth
avenue to the hotel. Thousands of
persons crowded the sidewalks and :
greeted the Knights with enthusiastic
cheers. "When the train pulled into the
depot the first man to alight was Very
Eminent Deputy Grand Master Reuben
H. Lloyd, lie said: "Of course I am
glad to get here. "We have had a long
trip, with few incidents or adventures
to relate. It is too soon to say what I
think about the conclave. So far as my
own personal observations are con- j
earned, I can say, though, that we have ;
tit>%r~?i p&t.'hJr>&. but- <--l>urg- for the 1
past few months and the splendid ar
rangement you are making for the tri
ennial gathering. I feel as much inter- j
ested in the city itself as in the con- j
clave, and we have come here prepared â 
for a pleasant visit and a great deal of
sightseeing."
When questioned concerning the
election of Grand Master, Mr. Lloyd
laughed and said that other candidates
would probably appear.
"Only the votes will tell," he said.
"In our elections we have no speeches,
no caucuses and no slates, and we can
not tell at this time who the lucky
Knight will be."
After they had visited their rooms
and changed clothing in the Hotel
Henry the members of California No. 1
went across Fifth avenue to the Car
negie building, where they established
headquarters in the large, well-lighted
storeroom.
For some days decorators have been
at work on the place, and by Monday
it will present an attractive appear
ance. The building is located between
Smithfield and Grant streets, opposite
St. Paul's Cathedral. The members of j
No. 1 will hold a grand reception
Thursday, from 10 a. in. to Â« p. m. After
8:30 o'clock Thursday evening they will
assist the Grand Commandery of Cali
fornia in receiving the new Grand Mas
ter, Reuben H. Lloyd, and the other
new officers of the Grand Encamp
ment. The large storeroom is well
adapted for the purpose. To guide the
weary pilgrims to the place a large
electric sign with the words "Califor
nia No. 1" will be placed over the door.
The headquarters is centrally located
and among the best in the city.
The Californlans made rapid time
across the continent. On all divisions
of the railroads used the best engineers
were placed on the fastest engines for
the accommodation of the special train,
and at the end of each division the en
gineer who had finished his work was
presented with a case of wine. With
th* party was Adjutant General Bar
rett of California, who is going to
Washington to collect from the Gov
ernment 5180,000 due California for the
equipment of her soldiers mustered
into the United States services some
months ago.
After the conclave the members of
Commandery No. 1 will make pilgrim
ages through various parts of the East.
Many of them are former residents of
New England, and that section of the
country will attract most of them.
Captain William R. Heckert, who hag
charge of the commandery drills at
Sehennly Park next Wednesday, an
nounces that there will be no competi
tive exhibition, the late war with
Spain having called many Knights Into
the volunteer service. This fact cornea
as a great disappointment, to the
Knights, as the competitive drills have
always been a feature of every con
clave.
The programme for the Schennly
Park exhibition next Wednesday will
b*' as follows: Drill by bicycle corps;
Swift's brigade of Allegheny; Detroit,
No. 1; St. Bernard. No. 35; Chicago;
Louisville, No. 1; Handieman, No. 12;
Cincinnati; Damascus, No. 16, Detroit.
Two other drill corps may take part.
Three drill instructors from West
Point will act as judges. To each com
mandery will be presented handsome
badges. The commanders are the
most fxp^rt of the order. St. Bernard
of Chicago has captured prize after
prizf in drills all over the country and
has the reputation of being the most
perfr-ftly handled body of Knights In
the United States.
Boomers for Louisville as the meet
ing place of the twenty-eighth con
clave arc- perfecting plans for a viK^r
ous Pittshure- campaign. Two large
rooms In the City Hall will be devoted
to the use of the Bourbon State Knights
as "boom headquarters." The Grand
Commandery of Kentucky will have
the support of De Molay and Louisville
commanderies jointly and the assist
ance of othor representatives from all
parts of the State.
Los Angeles Commandery No. 9 is
scheduled to arrive at 9 o'clock to-mor

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct B.â A New Orleans
the Herald says: New Or
mmercial interests are thor
oughly stirred up over the move of the
hern Pacific in transferring its
New York steamships from this
- ibine Pass, Tex., owing to the
Ing quarantine regulations result
ing from the jtllow fever scare.
It means tht. practical abandonment
of the immense terminals of the Mor
gan Company at Algiers, just across
the Mississippi.
The long wharves and train sheds of
the Southern Pacific to-day presented
the scene ot a deserted village. As
sistant General Manager Thornwell
Fay assures the shipping men of this
city that the move is only temporary,
and that it is the result of the Texas
health authorities refusing to allow any
more freight loaded from New York
steamers on cars at Algiers from pass
ing through the State of Texas.
But for all these assurances the sit
uation is regarded as a very significant
thing in the commercial relations of
this city and of Galveston. Already the
Koutze syndicate at Sabine Pass, which
is a N'" - .v York concern, and which
practically owns everything in and ad
jacent to Sabine Pass, has made great
capital over the movement. They are
proclaiming that Sabine Pass, Texas,
is now destined to become one of the
most important shipping ports on the
Gulf of Mexico.
ASSUMING VERY
GRAVE PROPORTIONS
MEMPHIS, Oct. B.â The yellow fever
situation throughout the State of Mis
souri is assuming grave proportions.
The infection may be said to be gen
eral, as there in no section that lias a t
been visited.
Three interstate railroads have prac
tically suspended business and several
short lines are on the verge of a tem
porary shut-du\vn, due to the lack of
trade. Twenty thousand or more peo
ple have hurriedly left the State and are
refugees in Northern cities, eagerly
awaiting the approach of cold weather.
The disease continues to increase
steadily in Jackson, the State capital.
Since September 27 there have been
forty-four cases there, twenty-four of
the patients being negroes. Only five
deaths have been reportfnl since the be
ginning. The weather for the past
thlrty-=ix hours has been considerably
cooler throughout the State.
RAPID SPREAD OF
THE YELLOW FEVER
JACKSON, Miss., Oct. B.â ln Jackson
the area of Infection is increasing.
There is now one case within 100 yards
:of the State Capitol. The State Board
: of Health to-day issued an appeal for
; aid from the general Government, the
Governor telephoning his approval
'â  from Brandon, where he is transacting
public business.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. B.â The faculty and
students of the Mississipi Agricul
tural and Mechanical College, located
at Starkville. have arrived in St. Louis.
They are yellow fever refugees, and will
I remain in this city until frost stops the
I ravages of the fever. The president of
' the collecre is General Stephen Lee. a
cousin of General Fitzhugh Lee. No ef
fort will be made to carry on the school
in St. Louis, at least for the present.
SELMA, Ala., Oct. B.â The board of
censors of the committee on public
health of Dallas County has established
j a quarantine against the States of
Mississippi and Louisiana.
EVACUATION WILL
BEGIN AT ONCE
Special cable to The Call and the Npw York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS&S, by James Gor
d Bennett.
HAVANA, Oct. B.â General Clous and
Colonel Hart called on Colonel Girauta
to-day to ascertain the boundaries of
Manzanillo, which will be formally
evacuated on Monday, leaving Ameri
cans in possession of the whole eastern
end of the island with the exception of
Hoiguin.
Colonel Girauta told General Clous
that General Parada had received cable
dispatches from Madrid stating that
the demands of the Americans for evac
uation by December 1 cannot be com
plied with. It is now believed that the
matter will be settled by an agreement
for the evacuation "on December 1, or
as soon thereafter as possible," leaving
an opportunity for elasticity.
I am not able to give the ex
act language of the communication
sent to the Spanish commission yester
day Each paragraph began, "We in
sist," and to this phrase exception was
taken. _ ' ,-
After insisting upon December 1 as
the final date for evacuation the com
munication continued: "We insist, too,
that the evacuation shall be more than
a military measure. It must be com
plete and mean the relinquishment of
Spanish sovereignty over Cuba, regard
less of the date of peace as arranged
by the Paris Commission. We insist
that while Spanish soldiers may carry
their arms and all movable property
belonging to the army all immovable
property shall remain, i The immovable
property shall mean all movable prop
erty having to do with that which is
immovable." "&>. â¢ .
The Monserrat is expected to arrive
here from Spain to-morrow and will
immediately take on board many offi
cers and soldiers, and will then proceed
to Gibara, where she will ; take on a
full load of soldiers and proceed at once
to the peninsula. This will make the
beginning for the evacuation of West

BIG FORCE OF REGULARS IS
PLACED NEAR LEECH LAKE.
Owing to the Vigorous Stand o* Min

Be Given Ample Pro
tection.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL. Minn., Oct. B.â Nearly 200
additional troops will be scattered
about the scene of the disturbance near
Leech Lake within a few hours. Two
batteries of National Guardsmen were
pent up to-day by the Governor for the
protection of Cass Lake settlers.
At midnight a special train with
ninety additional regulars from the
Third Regiment at Fort Snelling
started for the north. They will be
there by morning and will be placed by
General Bacon where they can best pro
tect the country- This will make 400
regulars in and about Walker and
Leech Lake.
Reports from the scene of the trouble
to-night indicate considerable uncer
tainty. The dancing in Bear Island is
kept up and it is looked on as one of
the principal causes for apprehension.
Many Indians have been seen going
from other parts of the reservation
toward that island. Whether they will
join with the comparatively small
number of the Bear Island Indians is
not known.
The Bear Islanders are claiming a
victory over the soldiers and this may
bring recruits. Some of them un
doubtedly are going peacefully to the
agency, as ordered to, for they are ac
companied by their families, which
would not be the case were their In
tentions hostile. However, a small
number of Indians could do much dam
age before being captured or killed, for
the swamps and lakes are so numerous
and the general conditions such that
soldiers unacquainted with their sur
roundings would be unable to cope with
the savages.
An Indian is authority for the state
ment that their loss in the fight of
Wednesday was six killed and two mor
tally wounded. This same Indian says
they want to fight the soldiers, but not
the citizens.
GOVERNOR CLOUGH ANGRY.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. B.â The Govern
ment has notified Governor dough that
It has revoked the order putting the com- j
panics of the Fourteenth Minnesota Vol- I
unteers at Duluth and at St. Paul un
der his orders. He had all preparations
made to send the Duluth companies to
the front at once and protect the settlers,
and was arranging to mobilize the re
maining companies at St. Paul. He sup
poses the revocation is due to General
Bacon's message saying that the troublt
was over and that there was no mort
danger. He added:
"I shall pay no more attention to the
War Department. If necensary, I will ,
issue a call for volunteers, arm them with
such guns as I can pick up and let the
Government go to the -devil. I am tired
of doing business with Washington.
The^l is too much red tape about It. Or
ders are issued one minute and revoked
the next. I am not an alarmist, but it
is the safe thing to be prepared. It will
reassure the settlers and perhaps prevent
an outbreak."
The Governor has received a message
from Mayor John H. Nvers of 13rainerd,
saying:
"I have just returned from Walker. In
dians are concentrating at Leech Lake
In large numbers. Think they held a
council last night. Situation looks
grave."
W. F. Street wires the Governor from
Bemidji, west of Cass Lake:
"While I do not regard the situation
here as alarming, our people are much
disturbed. If you cou.d send the author
ities 200 stands of arms they would be

'Ph.- following telegram was sent by
Governor Clough to-day:
"H. C. Corbin. adiutant general: No
one claims that reinforcements were
needed at Walker. 1 have not been asked
fur assistance from that quarter, though
I do not think that General Bacon has
won the victory he claims. The people
generally say so. The Indians claim that
they have won, and that is my opinion.
The people all along the Rosston branch
of the Great Northern Railroad are very
much alarmed ami are asking f'<r the pro
tection a.^ked of the War Department.
The soldiers are here and are willing and
ready to go. but as you have revoke <1
your" order of yesterday, you can do what

in the future.
"A. CLOUGH, Governor."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. B.â Upon re
ceipt of -Governor Clough's message
General Corbin visited the White
House and showed it to the President.
An order was sent to General Bacon,
directing him to confer with Governor
Clough and to station troops along the
line of the railroad, In the vicinity of

OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC.
WASHINGTON, Oct. B.â The Inte
rior Department officials toojc an opti
mistic view of the Indian situation in
Minnesota to-day and Secretary Bliss
and others asserted their confidence
that the uprising is practically over. No
dispatches have reached the depart
ment since last evening, but the feel
ing of assurance is based on the devel
opments as reported in the published
official dispatches to the War Depart
ment and the press dispatches from the
scene of the trouble. The private dis
patch that reached Commissioner of
Indian Affairs Jones last night, indi
cating that the Indians on the warpath
hardly numbered more than twenty
five or thirty, is considered authentic.
INDIANS NOT YET WHIPPED.
ST. PAUL, Oct. B.â A Walker, Minn.,
special to the Dispatch says: General
Bacon has placed sixty men of Com
pany No. 1 for guard duty in town.
Bacon says that while the Indians re
treated to Bear Island after the fight,
he is not at all satisfied that they have
had enough. In case of a general upris

the Indians would not put up much of
a fight during the cold weather, and
that they could be then subdued or cap
tured.
PRAISE FOB THE SOLDIERS.
WALKER, Minn., Oct. B.â General Ba
con speaks in the highest terms of praise
of the conduct of his men in their fight
with the Bear Island Indians.
"No soldiers ever put up a gamer fight,"
he said, "and, considering that four-fifths
Of the men were recruits, their showing
was one of which every American soldier
may feel proud. The new men were en
tirely unfamiliar with the Krag-Jorgen
sens. ami when we were attacked it de
veloped that many of them actually did
not know how to load their pieces. But
they fought like veterans."
Of the entire company but twelve or fif
teen were old soldiers. The men are as
full of praise for their officers as the offi
cers are for the men.

HAVANA (via Key West), Oct. B.â
The Spanish censor has received in
structions from General Blanco to be
exceedingly strict during the crisis
brought suddenly about by the unex
pected show of determination by the
American Government in the demand
for the immediate evacuation of Cuba,
All dispatches were vigorously cen
sored last night and one intended for
the Herald and The Call was stricken
out completely. An appeal was taken,
but the censor was upheld in refusing
to allow anything to be said about an
incident which ended when Captain
Eaton of the Resolute defied General
Blanco and Admiral Montero to fire
upon the American flag. The matter is
now several days old, but was only
heard of when the Resolute returned
yesterday. The trouble all arose over
the steam yacht Alfredo, which brought
Benjamin F. Guerra, treasurer of the
Cuban Junta, from New York to Ha
vana. The Alfredo is alleged to have
been engaged in several filibustering
expeditions previous to the declaration
of war and is one of those vessels hate
ful in the sight of all loyal Spaniards.
For this reason the Alfredo had no
sooner poked its nose between Morro
and La Punta before it was boarded by
officials, who proceeded to find grounds
for detaining the vessel and assessing a
fine of $50.
The Alfredo had been detained nine
days when it was learned that she was
being held on a charge of having en
tered the harbor with improper papers.
An appeal was made to Captain Eaton,
who was advised by Admiral Sampson
that, being in command of the only
American war vessel In port, he had
much the same power as a Consul,
whereupon Captain Eaton wrote to
General Blanco, complaining of the
illegal detention of the Alfredo.
General Blanco referred the matter to
Senor Montero, secretary-treasurer of
the Autonomist Cabinet, upon whom
Captain Eaton called. Senor Montero,
with many shrugs, said he was sorry
to cause so much trouble, but the Al
fredo had offended the laws of Spain
and would have to suffer. Captain
Eaton promptly replied that the Alfredo
was a private yacht, her papers were
correct and her detention an outrage.
Moreover, he declared, unless clearance
papers were -ranted at once he would
go immediately aboard the Resolute,
which would tow the Alfredo out of the
harbor. If Morro cared to fire on the
American flag General Blanco would be
held responsible.
Senor Montero asked for time for
consideration, which was not granted.
He then said he would send clearance
papers. Captain Eaton stood firm, say
ing he must either have a remission of
the fine and clearance papers at once
or the Resolute would take the Alfredo
in tow.
Senor Montero ordered clearance
papers drawn and the incident ended
without burning powder.
THERE IS MUCH FEVER
IN HAVANA HARBOR
One Great Reason Why American.

There at Present.

HAVANA, Oct. B.â The Scorpion ar
rived at noon. Lieutenant Commander
Turner went at once to report to Ad
miral Sampson, but was unable to do so
on account of the latter's illness. Ad
miral Sampson was better to-day, but is
still unable to see any one.
On the French gunboat Fulton in this
harbor are sixteen light cases of yellow
fever. There have been two deaths. The
city is growing- healthier every day. but
there is much fever in the harbor, which
is one of the great reasons why Ameri
can warships should not be sent at this
time.

CAIMANERA," Cuba. Oct. B.â Naval
Constructor Hobson, accompanied by sev
eral divers, left last night to make an

CHARGED WITH MURDER.
WALKER. Mirin., Oct. S.â At the In

answrr the charge of murder.
Marshal O'Connor and 250 troops com
manded by General Bacon will move to

The Sound Money Issue Expected to
Counteract the Customary
Apathy in Off Year
Elections.
NEW YORK, Oct. B.â There was an
important conference of Republican
national leaders in this city to-day in
regard to the election of the next
United States Senate and House of
Representatives. Some close figuring
was done, and it was the opinion of
those who participated in the meeting
that they could insure the continuance
of Republican control in the National
; Legislature.
Senator Mark A. Hanna, chair
man of the Republican National
Committee; Representative J. W.
Babcock of Wisconsin, chair
man of the Republican Congres
sional Committee; Representative J.
jA. T. Hull of lowa, secretary of the
I committee; General Charles H. Gros
j venor of lowa, political statistician of
i the administration; Vice- President
! Hobart, and Senator John M. Thurston
jof Nebraska took part in the con
j ference.
From the figures set forth by the Re
j publican manners it is deducted that
the next United States Senate will bo
Republican by from six to ten votes;
i that the next House of Representatives
will have a working majority, hut not
j so large a majority as the present ona
of fifty-one votes, and that New York
is a doubtful State so far as the Legis
lature, which will elect a successor of
Senator Murphy, is concerned.
"Speaking generally," said Chairman
I Babcock, "the situation from our
I standpoint is much more satisfactory
than it was a few weeks ago. We ex
pect to elect enough Republican Repre
sentatives to give us a good working
majority in the House. We figure on
i losing. go.mÂ£_ of th* present majority . ?
I flity-one. Our losses will be in the
! Eastern, Middle and so-called border
' States, and will result mainly from
local causes. We do not anticipate any
loss but instead are figuring on gains
on national issues. The Democratic at
tempt to make capital out of the criti
| cism of the conduct of the war will be
| futile.
"On the sound money issue we will
gain. The trouble in off year elections
when times are good has always been
that the people are apathetic, and the
party in power has suffered. This year
we believe that the importance which
the people see in the maintenance of
sound money will remove this apathy."

the recent stories as to the suicide or as
sassination of the Emperor.
"No one has been killed in Peking ex
cept six natives, who were beheaded for
attacking Europeans. The Emperor has

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. B.â The War
Investigating Commission examined
two witnesses to-day. They were Dr.
Giffin, who was in charge of the Stern
berg Hospital at Camp Thomas, Chick
amauga Park, Ga., and Captain .Bald
ridge, a brigade commissary of subsis
tence at Camp Cuba Libre, at Jackson
ville.
The commission has practically de
cided to stan on the night of the 16th on
its round of the., various camps. It
will go either to Camp Meade or to
Jacksonville first. Ail#t.he camps will
.be* visited in succession.^but the under
standing is that the ' trip to Camp
Wikon! will not be made until some
time in November. Next week will be
given largely to the inspection of offi
.. cial reports and to other statements
that have been furnished in answer to
â  letters. â ' â¢
Major R." Emmet Giffin ..told of his i
visit to the Second Division Hospital in i
July last, when he said it was over
crowded. In each tent and under its ;
Hies there were eight or nine men when â 
there snould have been but four to six. :
There was a sufficiency of physicians j
and Major Giffin was sure they were )
competent men. The majority of pa- j
tients suffered from typhoid fever and |
venereal diseases, about 20 per cent be
ing of the latter class. He thought the j
crowding of the hospital was from lack i
of sufficient tentage, a fault due to the
Burgeon in charge.
Dr. Giffin has no complaint of neg
lect to make against any of the offi
cials of the War Department, and he j
had heard of only one complaint. There
were no matches for twenty-four hours. ;
He thought that the contract surgeons
should have been examined before they
â¢were appointed. They were not so ex- j
amined to his knowledge. The doctor
"expressed the opinion that the com
. plaints of starvation had arisen from
the fact that it was "necessary to put
- convalescents from typhoid fever on a
sparse diet. He thought many deaths
had been caused by overfeeding after
convalescents returned to their homes.
Orders were given to his knowledge
for prompt measures looking to the sup
pression of the fever when it broke out,
but the orders had not been obeyed. j
.He knew of more cases in which the
sinks were to the last within twenty
feet of the kitchens, and in the cases
of the Fourteenth Minnesota and Ninth
Pennsylvania regiments the sinks were
crowded near the kitchens when- there j
â was a quarter of a mile of .open field j
back of them. He thought that it had i
been a mistake to locate so,many men
together as were at Camp Thomas.
Requisitions had been honored prompt
, ly. â â¢-- -Xr
Captain James C. Baldridge, commis
sary of subsistence for the First Brig
ade of the Second Division of the Sev
enth Army Corps, now at Camp Cuba
'Libre, Jacksonville, occupied the com
s .mission during the afternoon. He
reached the camp on August 2 and
made an immediate inspection of the
kitchens. He found some of them not
'â¢well managed, as all of. the army cooks
were not experts. He believed that for
an army in camp green coffee was pref
erable to the roasted, as it was stronger
and fresher. The meat he considered
good.
The men were liberally supplied with
food and the location of the camp was
.good. Still there had been an increase
of disease, which he attributed to the
â  climate and to the assembling of a
large body of men. He also thought
decaying fruit and the canteen beer
had had an influence in producing dis
ease. Much of his testimony related
to complaints from the Second New
Jersey Regiment. He said there had
been many complaints from this regi
ment, and investigation had shown the
trouble was due to the fact that the
officers were without experience.
WEYLER WORKING
ON A NEW SCHEME
MADRID, Oct. B.â General Weyler,
whose recent arrival here from the
&alea'riO Islands , causes considerable un
tasiness in circles friendly to the dynasty,
is believed to have at last made nls
choice between the Carlluts and Republi
it,il to have cast his lot with the
latter. It is learned from sources that
have hitherto proved trustworthy that
â  r is zealously working with a newly
formed commission whose sphere of ac
tivity 1b Portugal as well as Spain, and
whose aim is to proclaim, after the sig
nature of peace, an Ifiorla.ii republic,
uniting the whole peninsula, with Weyler
as President.

AT THE OMAHA EXPOSITION
UNITED STATES AND GREAT
BRITAIN WILL RULE.
Conflicts Between Labor and Capital
Are to Be Things Only
of a Barbarian
Past.
OMAHA, Oct. B.â lf New York had
had a day made to order it would not
have secured more delightful weather
for its celebration at the exposition.
There was a large crowd in attendance,
with a fine delegation of the Empire
State's representative, citizens, includ
ing Chauncey M. Depew, chairman of
the State committee, and other prom
inent citizens. Senator Warner Miller
presided at the formal exercises at the
Auditorium, at which Mr. Depew was
the principal orator.
Mr. Depew spoke of the far-reaching
benefits the nation received from the
World's Fair, and said:
This exposition at Omaha is to vastly
enhance the interests of the country by
! bringing nearer and in better understand
ing of each other the different sections of
our own country.
i New York has been too content with
i being the Empire State and with having
its chief city the metropolis of the con
! tinent; the West too eager for an empire
I independent of the East; the South living
I too much upon its traditions and in its
l-ast; and the Pacific Slope resting too
i severely upon its boundless possibilities
and great expectations. The war with
Spain has superbly restored the senti
ment of nationality and eliminated sec
tional jealousies. But this exposition is
a healthy educator for commercial union.
The concentrated capital of the East is
the fruit of 300 years of settlement and
trade. It is needed In the West for rail-
I roads, irrigation, mines, water power,
i furnaces and mills. But capital is both
] selfish and Intelligent. It never deserts
i a territory because the investment has
| failed through bad judgment. It seeks
other sources for profitable employment,
and finds its remuneration in other and
needed work for the development of the
country. The honest investor believes in
legislation which extends the supervision
of the Government over the corporation
and the trust. He knows mat his safety,
as well as the public Interests, require
protection. It is only when a community
foolishly thinks that by having confiscated
to-day non-resident permanent invest
ment it has gained without effort the
capital for its future that the investor
withdraws and stays away. Money Is both
timid and modest. It seeks to keep out
of sight; It hides in stockings or nkh.-.s
In the wall or burrows in the ground. It
requires high civilization and great guar
antees to bring it out, put it in circulation
and make it useful. In times and In places
of panic and distrust it disappears and
increases the distress. With the return
of confidence it moves the machinery of
society and makes possible varied indus
tries and prosperity. The State which so
legislates as to take away all earning
power from the monej* It has invited or
borrowed soon learns that It has gained
a temporary advantage and lost its cred
it, which is the most fruitful source of
profit and prosperity.
Education is the remedy for our
troubles. The school Is the preparatory
department of the college, and the col
lege fits boys for the greater university
of the world. The school and the college
teach; they canhot educate. The colle
gian can become as narrow as his village
playmate who graduated at the common
school if both remain for their life work
In the Isolated environment of their local
conditions, prejudices and misconceptions-
Both of them come to this exposition.
The encircling horizon which made con
fident their physical and Intellectual vis
lon expands with their minds and em
braces states and cities, arts and indus
tries. They see the vastness and inter
dependence of our national commerce.
They learn that the more Intelligently
selfish any business may he the more pa
triotically it encourages every other in
dustry and contributes to the general
weal. The solution of the century-vexing
problem of capital and labor grows sim
pler. They see that even a railroad presi
dent may be a public-spirited citizen
without betraying the interests or lessen
ing the business of his company; that the
money power Is the concentration of the
capital of the many at convenient centers
of financial operations and contact with
the world, where it lire idle and useless in
times of distrust and is easily drawn to
the beneficent purposes and productive
energies of the community which can give ,
It profitable employment.
When Nebraska shalJ have reached the
age of New York there will be a popula
tion of over 200,000,000 in the United States.
Our domain will be sufficient for their
support and our Institutions elastic
enough for their orderly government and
their liberty. Intelligence will be keen
and high and the State will be very close
to the daily life and Industrial activities
of the people. Co-operation will be work-
Ing to an extent now thought chimerical.
There will alway be differences of condi
tions, as God has endowed His children
with degrees of gifts, but the much
abused doctrine that the world owes
every man a livingwill be in general vogue
and "practice. The lazy, the shiftless and
tho improvident will grumble and suffer
then as now, but there will be a place for
all, according to the talents beatowwi up
on them and wisely perfected plans for
the care and comfort of the aged and the
helpless. The English language will be
thÂ»* speech of diplomacy and the tongue
of a quarter of the human race. The
T'nited States and Great Britain, having
worked harmoniously together for a long
period, will dominate the world. Their
rule and example will be for the promo
tion of commerce and the spread of civil
ization with its requirements and benefits
In Asia ar.d Africa. Tear by year will
come nearer the realization of Ihe oromise
which began and has Inspired the Chris
tian era of "Peace on earth and good will
among men."
Hon. Jacob Amos of Syracuse also
spoke. The Buffalo Pan-American Ex
position Commission was strongly rep
resented by President Brlnker, Secre
tary Hill and Treasurer Lautz.

THE SAX FEA^ CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1898.
SAXTON'S SLAYER
NOW INDIFFERENT
Mrs. George Admits Her
Deadly Threats.
NOT AFRAID OF THE GALLOWS
HAD OBJECTED TO HIS VISITS TO
MRS. ALTHOUSE.
Canton, Ohio, Deeply Moved by the
Sensational Assassination of
the President's Brother
in-Law.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. B.â The city is
Intensely moved by the shocking trag
edy that so deeply affects the home of
its most highly esteemed citizen, the
President of the United States. It turns
out that Mrs. George had been around
the residence of Mrs. Althouse fre
quently, and when Saxton was about
to enter there last evening he was shot
dead on the doorstep.
Mrs. George had frequently threat
ened to kill him if he persisted in call
ing on Mrs. Althouse.
An interviewer at the City Prison
told Mrs. George he was not surprised
to find her locked up after what she
had threatened, and added:
"You remember you said you would
kill Saxton if he did not keep away
from the Althouse place?"
"Yes, I remember that I told you
that," said Mrs. George.
"And you remember that I told you
that if you did you would be hanged?"
"Yes" said Mrs. George, "and I re
member saying that I did not care if I
was."
Marshall Barber, President McKin
ley's brother-in-law, whose residence
!is at the old Saxton homestead, re
f ceived a telegram from the President
[ to-day saying that Mr. and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley and Mrs. Barber and her son,
John Barber, a Cuban and Porto Rican
soldier, who has been very ill at Wash
ington, will leave for Canton to-night
at 7 o'clock on the Pennsylvania road.
The funeral of Mr. Suxum will be held
Monday afternoon.
The post-mortem examination shows
two superlicial shot wounds; also that
a third bullet entered the left breast
and a fourth the left side, five inches
below the third, passing through the
lower abdomen and supposedly causing
death. The body was removed to the
Barber residence to-day.
Several persons allege that Mrs.
i George had threatened to shoot Saxt"ii.
'. She engaged Mayor Rice and Attorney
James Sterling for counsel to-day. An
affidavit charging murder in the first
degree has Deen filed against her by
Prosecuting Attorney PomerenA, in
Justice Reigner's court. It is signed by
Lawyer J. J. Grant, who was the per
| sonal friend, as well as legal counsel of
| Saxton.
Mrs. George was taken into the Jus
; tlces 1 court for arraignment, but her at-
I torneys, after reading the affidavit, an
| nounced that they were not ready for
i arraignment, and the proceedings wore
â  postponed until Mdnday. The prisot^i-r
I was thereupon remanded to the County
! Jail.
M. C. Barber, the brother-in-law of
j President McKinley, received a tele
[ gram from Washington to-night stat
ing that 2 o'clock would best suit the
President and Mrs. McKinley as the
hour for holding the funeral services.
Acordingly that hour on Monday af
ternoon has been selected. The ser
vices are to be private for th,e family
and immediate friends, and will occur
at the Barber home. The Washington
message also announced that the Presi
dent and party would reach Canton at
10:25 Sunday morning.
Mrs. Annie E. George is closely con
fined, so far as communication with her
friends is concerned, although she is
not restricted in her consultations with
her attorneys. She seems to be com
fortably established, and the officers
say that neither her appetite nor her
rest is disturbed by the conditions in
which she is placed. She Is cool and
collected, and still maintains silence on
every feature connected with the
tragedy.
Officers have been making- special ef
forts to find the weapon with which the
crime was committed by searching all
round the scene of the shooting, the
field through which she Is said to have
walked last night, and other places she
is thought to have been, but to no
avail.
There is some gossip that Saxton may
have been enticed to the Althouse resi
dence by a decoy letter. This Is based
on the statement of Mrs. Althouse that
Saxton knew she was not at home that
evening and that she did not expect to
be, and that, therefore, he had no rea
son to call. '
The Coroner began taking testimony
this afternoon and examined half a
dozen or more neighbors who heard th^>
Shooting or saw the dead man. The
only development of the inquest so far
Ib a statement by Henry Bederman
that he saw a woman in black In front*
of the Althouse home fire several shots
at a man. After the first shot she
walked away, and then there came
from the man a faint call for help. Phe
turned abruptly, walked b^ck and fired
several more shots, and then ran away.
He could not tell who the woman was.
IMPROVEMENTS FOR
THE SOLDIERS' HOME
Congress Will Be Asked to Supply
New Barracks and Repair the
Old.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. B.â Major W. H.
Bonsall of this city, member of the board
of managers of the National Soldiers'
Home, has just returned from the East,
where he visited all the homes and at
tended the meetings of the board. In tne
estimates prepared by t*e board for pres^
entatlon to the coming session of Con
gress Major Bonsall secured some im
portant changes for the Santa Monica
home which. If Congress grants the al
lowances will secure for the home greatly
improved facilities. The home is crowded
at preseni and there are 400 applicants
waiting for admission. The estimates
provide for two new barracks and furni
ture to cost $45,000 and a church to cost
$14 000, with $7500 for improvements in
the present quarters.
MISSING FROM GILROY.
Aged Thomas Dougherty Disappears
From His Home.
GILROY, Oct. B.â Thomas Dougherty,
an old resident of Gllroy and a former
City Marshal, has disappeared. He left
yesterday afternoon, leaving his purse
iind othor valuables at home, and took
with him a revolver. He walked west,
through the Hanna field, and when last
seen was passing Ousley's. three miles
from town. His omestic life was happy,
and it is believed he wandered off while
temporarily deranged. Searchers have
traversed the adjacent hills without find
ing the missing man. It is feared he has
ended his life.
Kicked by a Horse.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. B.â Thomas A. Kf
ser, lately of Loa Angeles, died this
morning Crom the effects of injuries re
ceived last night while attending a
horse. Uhe animal kicked him on the
head, fracturing his skull. Deceased was
employed by a hardware firm here.
SPANIARDS WILL
BE OBSTINATE
Not Ready to Accede All
Demands.
AMERICANS REMAIN FIRM
DIPLOMATIC CONTROVERSY IS
FAST APPROACHING.
Soon the Philippine Question Will Be
Taken Up by the Two Boards
of Peace Commission
ers at Paris.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. B.â The United States
Peace Commissioners began their usual
three-hour session at 10 o'clock this
morning. They are understood to have
taken Into consideration direct propo
sitions and counter-propositions from
the Spaniards. It may be regarded as
quite likely that the Spaniards have al
ready outlined their apparent expecta
tions, and that they are beyond the line
of possible acquiescence by the Ameri
cans.
The latter are now acting along well
considered lines, consistently and with
a definite end in view. They have, to
some degree, disclosed their expecta
tions and determinations. The Span
iards, however, seem unable or unwill
ing to understand or believe that the
Americans may have, at the outset, set
furth their requirements, and that they
are destined to remain virtually un
changed by finesse or counter-diplo
macy- Therefore it is not unlikely
that the Americans, following a course
of fair and thorough consideration of
all the original and counter proposi
tions, will, to the limit of possibility,
accord patient consideration to any
thought projected by the Spaniards.
While the Philippines have not yet
been reached in the deliberations, the
question is doubtless relatively not far
distant, and at that point is likely to
come the full stress of diplomatic con
troversy.
Referring to the Philippine phase of
the negotiations the Gaulois to-day
says: "The question was somewhat
touched upon though not discussed yes
terday, but there was enough to indi
cate serious difficulties when it does
come up."
The first session lasted two hours.
President Faure, through the United
States Embassador. General Horace
Porter, to-day invited the American
commission to visit the Longchamps
racecourse on Sunday, in order to wit
ness the race for the Prix Municipal.
The Americans, through the Embassa- ;
dor, thanked the President, but declined
his invitation.
RARE BIRD CAUGHT
BY A TOURIST'S DOG
papture in New Zealand} of a Wild
Fowl of a Species Thought to
Have Been Extinct.
VANCOUVER, Oct. 8â Advices were
received from Auckland by the Warrimbo
to the effect that a species of a very
rare bird has been discovered on one of
the southwest coast fiords of New Zea
land. It ft the mantelll, the takahe of
the Maoris, supposed to have been ex
tinct. Until a few weeks ago there was
only three specimens of this bird in the
world, and for many years no trace of
others had been seen. The specimen just
secured will probably be worth its weight
in gold and perhaps a good deal more.
It was caught by a dog owned by a

Information hitherto unknown has been
acquired through the capture of tiiis
strange creature. It is a handsome bird
of heavy gait, and absolutely unable to
use its wings for flying. It is about the
size of a goose, and has beautifully col
ored feathers. On the back, wings and
tail they are olive green of almost ire
tallic luster, 'and below the short tail
feathers are white, The legs and to< 9

with one angle directed forward, while
on *he upper side of the base of tha
beak is a rudimentary comb.
STRANGLED BY A NEGRO.
George Randall Arrested for the
Murder of Mrs. Voght.
DENVER. Oct. B.â George Randall, a
negro, has been arrosted on the charge of
having murdered Mrs. Julia Voght, who
was found dead yesterday in her apart
ments, where she had been strangled to
death with a towel. Randall, who fre
quently called on the woman, made some
damaging admissions while under the in
fluence of drink. It is believed he killed
the woman because she refused to give
him money. A memorandum book found
among her effects showed she had fre
quently given him small sums. No evi
dence has been discovered to connect
.Randall with the four murders by strang
ling that were committed here in 181 M.

TO FIX SAMPSON'S
RIGHT TO PROMOTION
NEW YORK, Oct. B.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: That there may be no question when Congress meets
of the right of Rear Admiral W. T. Sampson to the promotion that
has been given him, and to settle for all time the positions occupied
by the armored cruiser New York and the armored cruiser Brooklyn
during- the battle with Cervera's fleet, Secretary Long has directed the
assemblage of a -board at Tompkinsville to make a thorough investi
gation of the matter.
Friends of Rear Admiral Sampson claim that the investigation will
show conclusively that he was more in the fight than has been be
lieved.
NOW CONSIDERATE
TOWARD AMERICA
Germans Favor Reten
tion of Philippines.
WILL LET UNCLE SAM ALONE
MERCHANTS INCLINED TO AN
ANNEXATION.
Count yon Goetzen Praises the Valor
and Dash of Americans in
vie Santiago Cam
paign.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Oct. B.â There has been a
great change in German public opinion
on the subject of the retention of the
Philippine Islands by the United States.
The feeling toward America generally
is much more favorable than a couple
of months ago. The news from the
United States that the Government at
Washington is seriously contemplating
holding the Philippines is commented
upon dispassionately in the German
press, and it is significant this week
that two papers of such standing as
the Kolnische Zeitung and the Vos
sische Zeitung have published long let
ters from German merchants settled in
the Philippine Islands, in which Ameri
can annexation is strongly advocated.
A correspondent of the Vossische Zei
tung even vigorously combats Germany
making any attempt to secure a por
tion of the islands, citing weighty rea
sons therefor. Another significant fact
this week was a delegation representing
German and German-Swiss firms in
the Philippine Islands called at the
United States embassy to express hopes
that America will not relinquish the
islands, and, above all, not return them
to Spain, which, the delegation claimed,
would mean a recurrence of the revo
lution and the perpetuation of commer
cial troubles.
The delegation also asked if it might
go to Paris and lay its views before the
United Statt-s Peace Commission. The
United States Embassador here, Mr.
White, advised the delegation not to do
so. Mr. White does not anticipate Ger
man inteiference, directly or indirectly,
even if the United States insists upon
retaining the whole of the archipelago.
Privy Councilor Schwartenstein, for
merly of the German Embassy at
Washington, declares that Germany
does not dream of putting obstacles
in America's way.
Mr. White had a long conference on
Wednesday last with the German Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, Baron yon
Buelow.
Tin 1 Imperial Government last winter,
goaded by the agrarians, drew up a bill
to regulate the Inspection of American
meat exports. The bill practically
meant the death of the American meat
trade, and, luckily, it could not be
made ready for production in the
Reichstag before that body adjourned.
Since then the situation has changed.
The charges against American meats
have invariably proved to be ground
less, so that the violent press attacks
have ceased. The Government, there
fore, has considerably modified the bill.
which is now much less stringent, but
some of its provisions are still highly
prejudicial to canned meats and sau
sages.
It is expected that the measure will
be introduced into the Reichstag soon
after its convening next month. The
entire Right and a majority of the Cen
trists favor the measure, so its pass
age is virtually assured.
Mr. White has again taken up the
cause of American insurance compa
nies who have been forbidden to do
business in Prussia.
Count yon Goetzen's report of the
Cuban war operations is in the hands
of the Minister of War, General yon
Grossler. It is deemed confidential.
The Emperor has carefully read it. Yon
Goetzen first made a verbal Y-eport to
the Emperor, who specially inquired as
to the morale of the Americans, the dif
ference between the regulars and the
volunteers, the commissariat and medi
cal arrangements and the relative cour
age and spirit of the Americans. Since
then his Majesty has put many per
sonal questions to the Count. The lat
ter, in the main, reported favorably,
dwelling particularly on the dash and
valor of the Americans, the superior
ity of the Mauser rifle and the poor
generalship displayed on both sides.
The former German military attache at
Washington also severely condemned
General Toral's surrender at Santiago.
Dr. yon Holleben, the German Em
bassador to the United States, stopped
with the Emperor yesterday evening
and dilated upon the patriotism and
war fever of the American people. His
Majesty repeatedly expressed astonish
ment.
Dr. Miguel, the Minister of Finance
and vice president of the Council of
Ministers, through his mouthpiece, the
Politische Nachrichten, has issued a
denial of the newspaper statements to
the effect that the recent epidemics of
sickness in a number of German regi
ments was due to American meats. He
also denied that 150 cases of trichi
nosis at Sandersleben, near Beinberg,
were caused by American pork. All
the cases, he pointed out, were due to
home grown pork.
At the Socialists' annual conference
at Stuttgart this week Herr Liebknecht
made a speech, In which he declared
the Socialist party was the only one
capable of freeing the world from an
archism and war. He further asserted
that Prince Bismarck, "who had more
power than any one man since Napo
leon, was smashed by the Socialists."
Herr Liebknecht added significantly:
"And after we have overcome Bismarck
there is no opponent we fear."
The speech of Emperor William
heralding the anti-strikes bill furnished
material for inflammatory speeches.
The proceedings of the Socialist Con
gress brought out clearly the develop
ment of the Socialists into a parlia
mentary party of practical reform. A
feature of the congress was the promi
nent part taken by the workmen dele
gates, whose speeches in nearly every
case were of a revolutionary character.
They scouted compromise or caution.
The case ojf the newly elected Chief
Mayor of Berlin, Kirschner, and Magis
trate Kauffmann, whose appointments
have not been confirmed by the Em
peror, although the period In which
they should have been confirmed has
elapsed, promises to become sensa
tional. The Emperor, whose sanction is
necessary, objects to the two person
ages named, owing to their political
convictions, and the Tageblatt says:
"A series of conflicts between the crown
and the municipality, like the so-called
conflicts seen in the early sixties, seems
inevitable."
Some 150 persons who served in the
United States navy during the recent
war with Spain, are now in Germany on
leave of absence. They are creating
quite a sensation in the streets.
A semi-official denial has been issued
of the statement that the Emperor ex
pects to postpone his journey to Pales
tine.
The Empress of Germany, who Is an
ardent photographer, will take a com
plete photographic outfit with her for
use during her Eastern trip. Knack
fuss, the well known painter, and Salt
zemann, the marine painter, accom
pany the party. The latest item of the
Emperor's programme is a religious
ceremony on the Mount of Olives on
October 30. The imperial party will
number 128 persons, the horses and
mules will total over 8000 and a thou
sand Turkish troops will escort their
Majesties.
It is reported here that the North
German Lloyd Steamship Company in
tends to extend its East Asiatic service
to Manila.
PERRIS BONDS INVAL/D.
Important Decision Affecting the Im-
migration District.
RIVERSIDE, Oct. 8.-Judge Noyes of
the Supreme Court to-day rendered an im
portant decision in the case of Hogg vs.
the Ferris Irrigation District. Action was
brought to have the bonds declared in-
valid, and in a decision on the point that
the proper notice of Intention to form the
district was not given by the Supervisors
the court says:
Firstâ That the notice in question was
not sufficient to invest the Board of Su
pervisors of San Bernardino County with
jurisdiction to organize of to conduct any
proceedings for organization of the irri
gation district.
Secomf^-That the decree of confirmation
is Ineffectual for the purpose of legalizing
such organization, upon grounds that the
district was never organized; that all pro
ceedings had for such purpose were
wholly void; that to give efficiency io
such decree would be to violate the con
stitutional rights of land-owners of tne
said district in the same manner as uid
the order of the Board of Supervisors in
the first instance in attempting to organ
ize the district.
In A'iew of these conclusions, it is not
necessary to pass upon the many other
questions presented, find they will, tnere
fore, be dismissed without comment.

VALLEJO, Oct. B.â Commodore John
Crlttenden Watson, the new command
ant at Mare Island, assumed command
t"-day at 2 o'clock. He had been the
puf-st of Captain Kempff on the Inde
pendence and arrived at the navy yard
gate on the launch from that ship. He
was met by Captain Cotton and the
heads of departments and officers of the
yard, who were drawn up on the gang
way leading to the float. The entire
marine guard was drawn up on the
main avenue as Commodore Watson
di â  ye past.
Just as the new commandant stepped
on the lioat, the senior officer's pennant
and "cocoawhip" were hauled down
from the Independence and a commo
dore's blue pennant, with its single
white star, hoisted at the main truck,
while a salute of eleven guns was
â  modore Watson drove to his of
fice, whore he remained a short time,
uishing the command temporarily
t Captain Cotton. This action was
taken on advice of surgeons, as the
Commodore had been badly shaken up
when the car he was in was derailed
at Cclfax. His head was iut and a
slight injury to his left hand is covered
by a bandage.
-'Â«f*er leaving his office he returned to
the Independence and at 4:25 left for
San Francisco. He will return and as
sume hi? dfuti* s lay.
Commodore Watson wa.Â« seen by The
representative as he was about to
take the boat for San Francisco. He
said that he was very glad to come to
A are Island, as he had many friends in
V'ailejo and San Francisco and lik<*s the
"As long as the war is over," said he,
change from that hot climate is
very agreeable."
Commodore Watson was in command
of the eastern division of Admiral
2am; tin Cuban waters, and
hauled down his Hag from the Newark
off the coast of Jamaica just before
starting for Mare Island.- He has been
on duty here three times before, once
as ordnance officer, again as senior aid
to Admiral Rogers and again as Cap
tain of the yard. He left Mare Island
to command the flagship San Frar
l aking a cruise to Europe and South
America. For three years he was ffOV
oi the naval home at Philadel
phia, leaving there to join the fleet off
Santiago.
Tht Hartford will leave the dock to
morrow, ail work on her below the
water line being completed. Her boil
ers have been secured, and mechanics
are busy connecting them.
ThÂ». Yorktown will be placed in the
dock on Tuesday, using the blocks that
have supported the Hartford. She will
be cleaned, her sea valves, strut bear

THE COMMODORE'S PLANS.
Many Important and Expen-
sive Improvements for
Mare Island.
Commodore "Watson came down from
Mare Island last evening: and went di
rectly to the home of his relative. Judge
Thornton, at 2908 Jackson street: His
head and hand were still bandaged as
the result of the injury received in the
train wreck near Colfax, and a piece as
big as a quarter was missing from his
forehead. Although badly shaken up by
the accident he was in good spirits. Seat
ed around him his relatives listened to
his interesting: talk on the late war.
When pten by a Call representative h<:
stated that important improvements
would soon be under way at Mare Island,
and that they would be extensive and
permanent. This will mean the expend
ing of many thousands of dollars and
give employment to many hundreds of
men.
"The officers' quarters ruined by the
last earthquake," he said, "will have to
be rebuilt. Several of the workshops, a
eection of the seawall and an additional
drydock will probably be constructed."
He also thought that considerable work
in the lint of construction and repair
â would be done at the island and a great
deal of money would be disbursed. In his
opinion the yard would be put in the
highest state of efficiency.

JOSEPH SIMON
CHOSEN SENATOR
Elected by the Oregon
Legislature.
END OF A LONG STRUGGLE
CORBETT COULD NOT SECURE
THE NECESSARY VOTES.
The Successful Man Is a Well-Known
Political Worker and Has Held
Many Positions of
Trust.
SALEM, Or., Oct. B.â The nominee of
last night's Republican caucus, Joseph
Simon, was to-day regularly chosen
United States Senator by the Legisla
ture in joint session. He received the
full Republican vote, except that of
Senator Kuykendall, who was absent.
All the members recognized the binding
force of tbe caucus and there was no
attempt to evade or disregard it.
The election of Senator Simon is well I
received. In nearly all quartern it is 1
welcomed as a very satisfactory con
clusion of the contest. A few of the ,
most confirmed factlonists, those who !
still worship at the shrine o-f ex-Senator
Mitchell, or who seeing Simon's elec
tion a check to the influence that has
been operating through Senator Me- j
are sullen and heartsore over
their defeat. They cannot fall to pee
that the election of Senator Simon is a
y far the gold standard forces,
and they aiv correspondingly saddened.
one of their greatest contentions was i
really to have chosen a man who would
be in entire accord with or even sub
servtent to McÃride, in which particu
lar their plans miscarried most dis
tressingly. All others, however, feel
good over the election, and it is surpris
ing to see how general and evidently |
sincere are the indorsements of Sena- |
tor Simon.
The ballot stood: Simon 64, Klncaid
23, Bennett 2, absent 1.
The contest which ended to-day by
the election of Mr. Simon has been car- j
ried on for two years. The Legislature |
which convened in January, 1897, should
have chosen a successor to Senator J. '
H. Mitchell, whose term expired in
March, 1597, but the lower house was
never organized and consequently the
session expired beyond limitation and
no vote was taken for United States
Senator.
Governor Lord appointed ex-Senator
H. W. Corbett to the vacancy, but the
United States Senate refused to admit ;
him.
The Legislature which was elected
last June was overwhelmingly Repub
lican and Mr. Corbett was recognized
;ts the leading candidate for Senator.
Governor Lord called an extra session
of the Legislature, which assembled
September L' 6. Corbett received the
caucus nomination for Senator of a ma
jority of the members, but lacked the
ten votes of a majority of the Legisla
ture. After voting four days for Mr.
Corbett his Mends became convinced
that he would not be elected.
A caucus of all Republicans was
called last night, at which a letter of
withdrawal was read from Mr. Corbett.
A ballot was taken for Senator and Mr.
Simon received 101 votes or five less
than a majority of the Legislature, lie
fore another ballot was taken a mo
tion making Mr. Simon the unanimous
choice of the caucus was put and car
ried.
PORTLAND, Pr., Oct. B.â Joseph
Simon, who was to-day elected United
States Senator to fill the vacancy j
caused by the failure of the Legislature j
to elect a successor to John H. Mitchell, \
has been for years one of the â¢ most
prominent men in Oregon politics. He j
was born in Germany, of Jewish pa- j
rents, in 1851, and came to Oregon with i
his parents In 1857. He was educated !
in the public schools of this city,
studied law, and in 1872 was admitted j
to the bar, since which time he has !
practiced his profession in this city.
He became a member of the City
Council in 1877, serving three years, be- i
ing for a portion of the time President |
of the Council and Acting Mayor of the '
city. . As secretary of the Republican j
State Central Committee, in 1878. he
managed the campaign so successfully i
that In 1880 he was made chairman of j
the committee, in which capacity he
served for six years. He represented
Multonomah County in the State Senate
from 1880 to 1891, and again since in I
1893.
He was president of the Senate dur
ing the session of 1889-91 and since 1893
has been repeatedly re-elected to th;it
position, at present acting in that ca
pacity. He is one of the best presid
ing officers that body ever had. In
Mr. Simon was a delegate to the
National Republican convention in
Minneapolis.
He was then elected to represent Ore
gon in the Republican committee. For
eight years Mr. Simon was a member of
the Board of Police Commissioners of
Portland. He was a law partner of the
late Senator Dolph, being a member of
the firm of Dolph, Bellinger, Mallory &
Simon. Mr. Simon is a gold standard
man.

MERIDIAN, Miss., Oct. B.â Twenty
cases of yellow fever are reported from
Hattiesburg. Miss., a town of about
3000 'nhabitants, 110 miles north of New
Orleans on the New Orleans and North
eastern Railroad. The fever was
brought here by W. G. Rich, a wealthy
lumberman, from New Orleans about
fifteen days ago, and the nature of the
disease not being known a large num
ber of people were exposed and an
epidemic of the plague is the result.
REORGANIZATION OF
THE NATIONAL GUARD
Second Brigade to Have Eighteen
Companies and the Third Brig
ade Seven Companies.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. B.â An order was
to-day Issued from the adjutant general's
office regarding the reorganization of the
National Guard. The plan Is to admit
eighteen companies of infantry in the
Second Brigade and seven companies in
the Third Brigade.
Preference will be given to those locali
ties whose companies have been accepted
into the United States service. The seven
companies in the Third Brigade whl
probably be attached to the Second In
fantry, and thus bring it up to its regi
mental strength.
Woodland will be given one of these
companies. Preliminary examinations of
recruits will be held under the direction
of Major General Pickinson.
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBEH 9, 1808.
JOSEPH SIMON, U. S. SENATOR-ELECT FROM OREGON.
SALISBURY IS
DISGRUNTLED
Much Concerned Over
China and Fashoda.
WORRIED OVER THE FAR EAST
ENGLAND SENDING WAR MATE
RIAL TO HONGKONG.
Cruiser Terrible Ordered to Join
Her Sister Ship, the Power
ful, on the China
Station.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by thp Associated Press.
LONLx >N, < 'vi. S.â The Marquis of
Salisbury resumed his duties at the
â¢ Foreign Office in an unusually dogged
\ mood, a complete antithesis of his or
' dinary, gentle treatment of the officials.
j He was extremely disgruntled at the
i "-way official matters concerning China
i and Fashoda have been coming out. al
j though publicists of all shades of
l opinion have been bitterly complaining
at the almost complete ignorance in
which the country has been left re
specting all foreign questions. This was
' especially the case with Fashoda. and it
j bred want of confidence in the Govern
i ment among its own supporters, which
: has been amply demonstrated by the
| daily outcry of th>- conservative press
I against the climb-down upon the part
of Great Britain, which they evidently
forsee.
The reversal of the order of things in
China has also been a theme for lamen
tations at the Marquis of Salisbury's
invertebrateness. The dispatch of Cos
sacks and field guns to guard the Rus
sian Legation at Peking, in addition to
marines, as sent by the other embas
sies, is considered very significant.
The British Premier, however, seems
allze that trouble is brewing in the
Bast, as large quantities of war stores
are going to Hongkong, while the first
class cruiser Terrible has been ordered
to join her sister ship, the Powerful, at
the China station as soon as some re
pairs are completed. These cruisers
are the largest in the world.
Disquieting news from the Transvaal
has reached the British Foreign Office.
President Kruger has commanded Brit*
Isfa subjects in the Transvaal to join
the Burgher force sent against the re
bellious Chief Mofeu, who is preparing
for battle tin a large scale. All the
roads in Northern Transvaal are held
by armed Kaflirs and the Boers are
likely to have a difficult task.
President Kruger has the letter of the
law on his side in ordering British sub
jects in the Transvaal to join the
Burgher forces; but the British de
clare they will refuse to fight for thÂ»?
Boers while they are disenfranchised. '
The political side of Emperor Wil
liam's visit to Palestine is attracting
close attention here. Germany for the
past twenty years has had an eye on
Asia Minor as her part of the spoils
when the Ottoman empire collapses,
and the German Emperor, since the Ar
menian trouble, has obtained a strong'
foothold in that part of the world.
Germany has obtained railroad and
land concessions in Asia and is gener
ally showing a disposition to settle
those permanently. The English news
papers express the conviction that Em
peror William's idea is to foster this
German settlement and when Turkey
collapses, Germany will justly claim a
slice of Asia Minor, from the Aegean
Sea to Arabia, where there is room for
10,000,000 German immigrants who
would otherwise go to the United States
or British colonies.
The Spectator points out that Em
peror "William's first idea of German
izing the Transvaal. Southern Brazil
and parts of Africa failed. The project
led in Southern Brazil owing to the
ad In Berlin that it might lead to
â¢ with America. The Spectator adds:
however, America had been par
zed with a European war, as seemed
a few hours possible during the
lezuelan dispute, Germany's oppor
ity would have arrived. The ques
tion of the possibility of permission to
acquire Cuba met with an angry nega
tive answer, leaving little doubt that
| Washington has been asked to con
! ciliate Germany with a share in the
Philippine Islands."
The Spectator concludes with remark
ing: "Emperor William's change of ob
j ject accounts for his non-success, while
j his efforts in different directions have
i aroused or are armiÃing the sleepless
! distrust of Great Britain, Russia and
! the United States."
The Times is publishing a series of
letters from Manila describing the
I American achievements there. Ks cor
respondent, referring to the American
volunteers, warmly praises their work,
but adds that there is no question that
'< the men now are most anxious to go
i home. He says: "Their brief experi-
I ence in actual warfare established a
i notable fact. It proved them courage-
I ous. decent, high-minded soldiers,
worthy of every confidence, and cheer
ful in all circumstances. If the laurels
they have gained are small in compari
son with those which rewarded the
I heroism of their comrades at Santiago,
they are none the less honorable, for
men rould not have endured more or
worked harder than they, or shown
more valor."
Under the heading, "Another Ameri
can Triumph," the newspapers point
out that Mr. I'nwkins. the new Finance
Minister of India, has an American
wife, who is a cousin of former Krrtms
sador Eustis, and they declare that
Mrs. Dawkins will be a great acquisi
tion to Calcutta and Simla society.
The Field this week devotes its lead
ing article to contrasting British and
American race riding, and for the first
time In its history It indorses some
thing American. The Field says:
"There was a time when Englishmen
thought themselves supreme in every
thing concerning the. horse, but that
idea is being very surely knocked in
the head, for American horses have
won some of our host races, and now
Sloan comes among us to show our
jockeys lie has a style apparently su
perior to theirs."
The Field characterizes as absurd
and unsportsmanlike the published
suggestion that owners should boycott
Sloan, as his victories are won by trick,
and asks what would Englishmen have
said If similar treatment had been
meted out to English Jockeys on Ameri
can racecourses. In conclusion the
Field remarks: "Not a single word was
ever brought up about unfairness in
Sloan's riding, and he is entitled to full
praise for his victories. It should be
equally unjust and ungenerous to
deny him full credit for what he has
accomplished, for It is not sportsman
like to attempt to explain away defeat."
MISSiONAKY WORK AT
HOME AND ABROAD
An Interesting Feature of the Report
to the Episcopal Council Relates
to New Territory.
WASHINGTON, Oct. S.â The triennial
report of the Board of Missions has been
submitted to the Episcopal Council. It
reviews the whole Held of mission work,
domestic and foreign. An interesting
feature is- a reference to Cuba, Porto
Rico, Hay-ail, etc., aÂ» follows:
"It can only be positively stated at this
time that by reason of the action of Con
gress, approved by the President of the
United States, Hawaii has become United
States territory, as Porto Rico will be
come also such territory upon the con
clusion of the treaty of peace with Spain.
What will occur with regard to Cuba, the
Philippines and one or more of the La
drones it is premature to say. It is cer
tain, however, that the accession of terri
tory means increased missionary respon
sibility.
"Questions that may arise with regard
to Hawaii are different from those that
will come to the front with respect to
other localities. Since 1861 the English
church has been represented there By a
Bishop, a small staff of clergy, and by
one or more educational institutions in
Honolulu and elsewhere. The Bishop has
approached the board of managers more
than once fur assistance In this work.
but feeling inconsistent policy It has been

day* difcusalon, resenting many of the.
arjn ments made against the change, and
m;l; it an earnest appeal for the incor
poration into the constitution.
Strong appeals in favor of adoption
were made by Rev. Morgan Dix of New
York, thf chairman of the revision com
mittee of the deputies, and others, and
the motion to stride out the amendment
of the committee was lost by an over
whelming viva voce vote.
An amendment offered by Rev. Dr.
Jewell of Milwaukee was adopted, chang
ing the phraseology of the section under
consideration to make the. language con
form to the canonical law. A number of
other amendments wore proposed, but all
were rejected, and then article II of the
constitution, as reported and amended,
was carried by an almost unanimous vote.
This article relates entirely to the seleel
tlon, ordination and jurisdiction of Bish
ops.
Article 111 of the new constitution was
adopted almost unanimously. It elim
inates the provision In the existing con
stitution which prohibits Bisnops of
churches in foreign lands from having a

them Ineligible to a diocesan office in the

RETURNING TO
THE PARTY FOLD
Silver Republicans Are
for Cage.
SITUATION IN LOS ANGELES
FUSION NOMINEE IS LOSING
VOTES DAILY.
Dr. W. M. Johnston, Who Voted
Against McKinley, Tells Why
He Is Back in the
Ranks.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. B.â The Silver
Republicans of this county are rapidly
nocking to the standard of Henry T.
Gage. In 1896 Los Angeles County cast
a large Silver Republican vote fur
Bryan. The club here claimed to have
on its roll 4000 names, and it is esti
mated that at least 3500 Silver Republi
cans did vote with the Democrats on
the Presidential issue. This vote was
partially offset by the 2500 gold Demo
crats who voted for McKlnley.
This year in Los Angeles County the
Hold Democrats are opposed to Ma
guire for the reason that he stands for
all the elements they voted against in
1896 and is running on a platform that
indorses the Chicago pronunciamento
of the Silver Democrats, made two
years ago by Altgeld and company.
On the other hand, half of the Silver
Republicans have returned to the
straight Republican party as far as the
State is concerned. Many of them will
vote for Gage and a mixed State ticket.
The sentiment of these Silver Repub
licans is ably set forth by Dr. W. M.
Johnston, who in IS;<6 and 1597 was one
of the most active Silver Republicans
in this city. He was one of the execu
tive committee of th- Silver Republi
can Club, and was prominent In the
club management.
In giving his reasons for supporting
Henry T. Gage for Governor Dr. Juhn
ston said:
"I have known Mr. Gage for a long
period, and I know him to be an hon
est, and, in every way, an honorable
man. He is fully competent to fill the
position of chief executive of the State
â this we all know. The story that the
Southern Pacific or any corporation or
individual can control his policy as
Governor of the State is all bosh. I
personally know of at least 200 Silver
l;> publicans who are going; to vote for
Gage, and a major portion of the Re
publican State ticket.
"I am convinced that the Silver Re
publican organization here could not
accomplish what it was organized for.
and I left it. I am now back in the
Republican party, where 1 belteve I
can accomplish more for the principles 1
believe in and for the good of the State
of California. With hundreds of for
mer Silver Republicans this same sen
timent exists.
INVENTOR MAXIM
ARRESTED FOR BIGAMY
Claims It Is an Attempt at Black
mail by Helen
Leighton.
NEW YORK. Oe%. B.â Hiram S. Maxim,
the inventor of rapid-fire guns, was ar
rested last night in Poughkeepsie. N. V.,
on warrants for bigamy and abandon
ment. He says that the whole thing i? a
blackmailing BCheme. Maxim said that
the woman causing him the trouble is
Helen Leijjhton. He said that fifteen
years ago he met the woman on the Bow
ery in this city. He said that he was then
living on Uni<m street in Brooklyn with
his wife and children. He stated that the
same kind of a suit was Instituted against
him In Philadelphia at that time. The
case, hfi said, was dismissed because the
Leigbton woman failed to appear in
court.
Mr. Maxim said thnt the Leighton
woman, after the Philadelphia episode,
appeared In London and sought him out
In his apartments. He said he had to
forcibly eject her. At Poughkeepsle. to
day Maxim ['leaded not guilty and was re
leased on $-000 bail to appear next Fri
day.

Ante-Mortem Statement Made by
Thomas Cook's Victim.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. S.â John Grisby.
the farmer who was shot twice yesterday
by Thomas Cook, died this afternoon, but
not before he had told the story of the
shooting. Grisby says that when he met
Cook in the road he told him he did not
want to tight as? he was not armed, but
Cook swore he would kill him any way
as he was the person who had cut his
(Cook's) wire fence. Then Cook began
tiring. A year nun Cook got into trouble

WHITE SPEAKS
IN FAVOR OF
JUDGE MAGUIRE
His Acts in Congress
Defended.
SECRETARY ALGER SCORED
RAILROAD QUESTION SAID TO
BE THE ISSUE.
Senator White Says That if the Peo
ple Are True to Themselves
They Will Elect tha
Democrats.
Metropolitan Hall was scarcely largo |
â¢nough to accommodate the audience that
od there iast night to hear Senator
Stephen M. White champion the candi
dacy of James >;. Maguire for Governor.
Senator White spoke for nearly two
hours, devoting the most of his time to â¢
the war w;;h Spain, and arguing that the |
railroad question is the main issue in the
present ( ampaign. The. meeting, which
was held under the auspices of the exec
utive committee of the Union campaign :
committee, was called to order by W. P.
Lawlor, who. after announcing that the
bullshead breakfast of the lroquois Club ,
advertised v. take place at San Leandro [
to-day had been pi stponed and that there j
would be a ratification meeting of the
Democratic municipal candidates in the
hail Tuesday evening, introduced Henry
C. Gesford as chairman of the evening.
Mr. Gesford spoke but briefly. He said ;
that never before since the close of the j
Civil War has there been less spirit of
partisanship and more spirit of patriotism
than during the past few months. "We j
are in a new era of politics," eaid he, I
"and while William J. Bryan went down
in defeat two years ago. a new era of
freedom dawned on the American Repub
lic. Although Bryan was defeated, the
principles he represented will never die.
The principles he represented are
represented to-day in that noble exponent
of Democracy, James G. Maguire. The
forces that were marshaled to defeat
Bryan are at present massed together to
defeat James G. Maguire. He is the foe
of monopolies and trusts and a friend of
the people and of the American Govern
ment. We owe it to ourselves and to the
State in which we live that we elect him
on the Bth day of November.
The Columbian quartetâ consisting of
J. C. Flood, F. A. Griffing, J. C. O'DonrWl
and S. J. Dalyâ rendered several cam
paign selections in an acceptable manner,
and were repeatedly eneored^
K. L. Hutchison of Loa ILngeles, the
Populist, Democratic, Silver Republican
candidate for Lieutenant Governor,
then introduced. He followed the ex
ample of Chairman Gesford and content
ed himself with a five-minute talk. "I
did not come here to-night to make a
speech," paid he, "and I know that you
didn't come her.- to listen to me. I will
briefly tell you that 1 have traveled the
entire southern portion of the State with
Judge Maguire, and the enthusiasm he
hae aroused is simply marvelous. The
papers of the opposition tell you that
there was no enthusiasm at any of his
meetings. That is untrue. Why, at San
Diego fully 7000 people gathered in the
plaza to hear him."
Mr. Hutchison then predicted the elec
tion of Congressman Maguire. "This is
an important fight," said he, "and the
people will win it. The Governorship of
California is the most important Gover
norship in those United States. Why?
Because out Legislature only meets four
months out of every four years, and it
is necessary to have an experienced man
at the helm to handle the important mat
ters that necessarily come up between
sessions of the Legislature. Henry T.
Gage is inexperienced in affairs of State,
while Congressman Maguire, from his
long experience in public life, is thor
oughly conversant with them."
When Senator White was introduced as
the speaker of the evening the audience
rose and cheered, while the band played
"He's a Jolly uood Fello 1^." It was .sev
eral minutes before Mr. White was able
to proceed. He prefaced his remarks by
saying that he Intended dealing with the
issues of the campaign in a plain,
straightforward way, and without indulg
ing in any flights of oratory. "I care lit
tle for rnetoric," said he, "but I want to
make himself thoroughly understood.
This is a Democratic assemblage, and we
are to solve and render to the people a
true statement of the condition of affairs.
I am here as a uemocrat, commissioned
by my party to perform the solemn duty
of enlightening the people of this great
commonwealth on the issues of the time.
I am here to show every free born and
independent man that he should support
in this campaign the ticket headed by
James G. Maguire. I do not intend in
dulging in any personalities, but I will en
deavor to prove to you that you cannot
consistently support the Republican
ticket.
"Judgre Lawlor advertised that I was to
answer the arguments of General Barnes
and Henry T. Gage. That has placed me
in a nice position; for I have never
learned that during the - present cam
paign they have Indulged in any argu
ments. (Laughter.) I have read and re
read their printed speeches in the hope
of finding at s. â time during the can
vass they had advanced an argument, but
I failed.
"Now both gentlemen are able lawyers
and dangerous in the forum, but in this
campaign they are not in the least dan
gerous. I have read their speeches in
The Call and Chronicleâ and, by the way,
let me see; Isn't the Chronicle running
for Governor or Senator? (Laughter.).
"You see I've been away from here two
weeks and I wasn't just certain what the
Chronicle was runing for. But that
do< sn't make any difference or bear on
what lam here to say. I see that Gage
and Barnes have been announcing 'We
Republicans declared the war, we rescued
the Philippine? and we took Cuba away
from the Spaniards.' That is the whole
cry. It is true we had a war with Spain
and won it. Was it the Republican party
that won the victory. A thousand times
no. The war was won by the true
Americans. Who was it that first shed
blood on the Wtnslow? They were Amer
icans. They did not belong to any po
litical party. They belonged to the en
tire American people. But do not let
us bring them and their valiant deeds
into this political controversy."
Senator White then paid a glowing trib
ute to the Seventh California Regiment
encamped at the Presidio. He said that
the members were all disappointed at be
ing unable to go to the front and, also, at
the treatment they received. "One of
th.-m told me," said the speaker, "that
they were digging a trench. They had
only gone down three feet when they
came across the decomposed body of a
Chinaman. Was that a fit camping place
for as brave a body of men as ever
donned a uniform?"
Senator White next devoted considerable
time to the miserable sanitary condition
of the camp grounds, and said that ty
phoid fever had caused more havoc in the
ranks than the Spanish bullets. He
charged the awful death rate to the stu
pidity of General Alger, Secretary of War.
"McKinley cannot be held responsible,"
said "White "unless it be for not kicking
Alger out of the Cabinet."
White then denied the charge made that
he and Congressman Maguire had refused
to vote to give the Government money to
curry on the war. "I confess that I pre
fer peace to war," said he, "for strife,
has never done much for the struggling,
toiling masses of humanity.
"The gentleman who says that Judge Ma
guire and myself did not support the Gov
ernment is â well is not a student In the
avocation of telling the truth. We did
not vote against a war tariff, but we
did vote against having the entire taxa
tion placed on the shoulders of the weak,
the lowly, the poor and overtaxed people
of the country. We claimed that the tax
should be so distributed that the burden
would be equally borne, instead of raising
nearly 50 per cent of it l.y taxation on
those luxuries, tobacco and beer.
"Why didn't they tax the champagne of
the rich man? It was only after a hard
fight that we managed to get a tax placed
on the oil companies, the sugar trusts
and the Pullman Palace Car Company.
We never opposed giving the President all
the money he required to conduct the
campaign, but we were opposed to the
Republican party's manner of raising it.
The war tariff was made in the interests
of the trusts. The Republican party
sought to make the poor pay all the tax.
Was that right? Why should not the cor
porations pay something to support the
war? The war happily is now over, but
the Republican party has no right to
claim the honor of the victory. That
honor belongs to our American soldiers
and sailors."'
In conclusion Senator White said the
question of the day Ik "Can the people
run this State without asking the per
mission of the Southern Pacific Com
pany?" The Republicans tell us that the
railroad is not an issue of the campaign.
It is an issue, and the real issue. In an
indirect v/ay the men on the Republican
State ticket are the serfs of the rail
road, for not one of them would have ob
tained a place on the ticket unless the
railroad wanted him there. They are be
ing supported by the railroad. I don't
mean to say that they are the slaves of
the railroad, but I do Challenge them to
dispute me when I say the railroad Is sup
porting every cancL^ate on the Republi
can ticket. I do not, nor would I wish
to do, the railroad company an Injustice
or an injury, but I do object to it run
ning the politics of the State of Califor
nia. Under these circumstanced will you

allow the railroad to throw down the
man who has for so many years hon
estly and fearlessly championed your
cause? Will you allow him to be defeat
ed at the behest of the money kings, the
trusts and corporations? If you do, then
you are not worth living."
TICKET REFUSED FILING
UNITED LABOR PARTY TURNED
OUT BY THE REGISTRAR.
Mayor Phelan Headed the Candidates
That Sought a Place on the
Official Ballot.
Registrar Biggy yesterday refused to
file the ticket of the United Labor party.
His reasons for such action are set forth
In the following letter addressed to James
Bmiley, chairman of the United Labor
party:
"Dear Sir: The certificate of nomina

me by you Is refused filing upon the fol
lowing grounds:

"Secondâ The candidates upon said
ticket have not offered for tiling the
names of five persons citizens and elec
tors of the State, together with their
written acceptance and consent to act as
an auditing committee, as required by
law.
"Thirdâ The affidavits attached to the
riuminating papers are not in the form
provided by section 1188, Political Code.
"Fourthâ The nomination papers or cer
tificates are not subscribed and sworn to
by one of the signers of each such paper,
as required by law.
"Fifthâ Two-thirds of the purported sig

T. C. SPELLING'S FIGHT.
The Supreme Court Will Pass Upon
His Congressional Nomination.
The petition of T. C. Spelling, who
wants to be elected to represent the
Fourth Congressional District, was ar
gued yesterday before the Justices of the
Supreme Court. His petition was to com
pel Secretary of State Brown to place his
name on the. Democratic ticket and to re
mnve the name of James H. Harry there
from. His contention was that be was
the regular Democratic nominee for Con
gress in that district and was entitled to
the party name. In his argument before
the court he admitted that he was not
nominated by the convention that was
held in Sacramento, but for al! that he
did receive his nomination for Congress
at the hands of a legally constituted con
vention of and in the district.
Secretary of State Brown was repre
sented by'E. S. Van Meter, who argued
that Spelling's nomination was by an il
legal body of men who had no connec
tion with "the Democratic party and cpn
sequently their action was illegal, with
out authority and invalid. This was es
tablished, he contended, by the fact that
th<- body of men who nominated Spelling
had not been call-d together by the Dem
ocratic State Central Committee, nor rec
â â â â â ] by the State convention, and no
convention could be legally held without
the recognition of either at these bodies.
The matter was taken under advisement
by the Supreme Court.
GAGE AND PRESTON.
San Joaquin Valley Tour Opens With
a Meeting at Bakersfield To-
Morrow Night.
Henry T. Gage. Republican nominee
for Governor, accompanied by Hon. E. F.
Preston, will leave San Francisco to-day
for the San Joaquin Valley. They will
address a Kern County mass-meeting at
Bakersfield to-morrow evening. The ap
pointments for the remainder of the week
are: Tuesday evening. Visalia; Wednes
day afternoon, Lemoore; Wednesday
evening, Jlanford; Thursday evening,
Fresno; and Friday evening, Merced.
The Maguireites claim that their great
stronghold in this campaign is the San
Joaquin Valley, but the reports from that
region of the State indicate that the Re
publicans are active, enthusiastic and
confident.
The Chamber in Politics.
The Chamber of Commerce is likely to
take a hand in the coming campaign, at
least in one matter. Yesterday its officers
sent to all of the candidates in every Con
gressional district, without regard to
party, a letter asking their position on the
construction of the Nicaragua canal. The
letter concludes: "The Chamber of Com
merce of San Francisco has long and
earnestly labored that this great work
may be accomplished. It is not necessary
for us here to present the valuable feat
ures of this enterprise, already well
known to you; but we would be greatiy
obliged if, at your earliest convenience,
you will kindly present us with your
views upon this subject, so important to
our country and coast."
The members of the chamber have la
bored long and earnestly in the cause of
the canal, and the letter means that if the
answers of any are not satisfactory, or if
not answered at all, preference will be
given to those who are known to ue
friends of the project.
William A. Deane Club.
A large meeting of the friends of Wil
liam A. Deane, Republican nominee for
County Clerk, was held last night, at
which it w^s unanimously resolved to
form a William A. Deane Club. The
greatest enthusiasm prevailed and all

MAGUIRE AND FUSION
STRONGLY DENOUNCED
The State Executive Committee of the middle-of-the-road Populists, who
repudiated James G. Maguire and fusion at Sacramento, met in conference
yesterday afternoon with several other well-known members of the party.
When they withdrew from the fusion convention and selected T. W. H.
Shanahan as their standard bearer and nominated a full State ticket. It
was in the firm belief that the courts would decide that they were entitled
to the Populist party designation on the ballots. The Supreme Court de
cided, however, in favor of the fuslonlsts, and the middle-of-the-road
men withdrew from the field. They made a gallant fight to save the
party name and when the adverse decision was filed there remained noth
ing- for them to do but wind up their affairs and adjourn. Nothing would
have been accomplished by going on the ballot by petition and the fight
was to save the party name, but it failed.
The conference was called to order yesterday afternoon by Douglas
T. Fowler, chairman of the convention that nominated Shanahan, and
Carleton H. Johnson, secretary of the executive committee, was at his
post. After going over the situation, and discussing the party treachery
of those who aided in the fusion deal the committee drew up the following
address and then adjourned sine die.
To the Straight People's Party Voters of California: We desire to submit the
following as a report of the executive committee of the reorganized State Central
Committee as created by the convention of delegates who withdrew from the fusion
State convention at Sacramento and on July 14, 1898, nominated T. W. H. Shanahan
fcr Governor and a straight People's party ticket in opposition to J. G. Magulre and
the fusion People's party ticket. Through the chairman and secretary of our State
convention a certificate of nomination of the various candidates nominated was pre
sented to Secretary of State L. H. Brown on September 10. IS9S. At the same time
a certificate was presented by the fusion Populists. After deliberation the Secretary of
State on September 14 decided that In his opinion the straight People's party con
vention was the truly representative convention and accepted our ticket and filed the
same and rejected the fusion ticket as a pretended People's party ticket and not en
titled to receive the party designation.
The fuefonlsta appealed to the Supreme Court and the case was argued before that
body on September 20. with Thomas V. Cator as counsel for your committee and the
Secretary of State. On September 30 the court handed down a decision reversing
the ruling of the Secretary of State, ordering him to strike the straight People's
party ticket from the file and to file the fuslnn tirket In Its stead in the name of
the People's party. The court held that the fusion convention was the regular con
vention, and that Its identity was not destroyed by the withdrawal of the minority.
The court says in pnrt:
"The factâ lf it be a factâ that some or all of the delegates who remained were
violating pledges or sacrificing party Interests in nominating Judge Mosul re and
adopting the plan of fusion aforesaid presents a question with which neither the Sec
retary of State nor the court has the slightest concern. That ie a matter to be settled
between them and their constituents. Delegates to political conventions are no doubt
trustees in a large sense of the word, but they discharge a trust with which the
courts do not meddle."'
The circulation of a petition for the placing of our ticket on the ballot was not
considered by your committee, as no such action was contemplated by the straight
People'e party State convention. We considered that we were delegated to make an
effort to secure the People's party designation, and, being unsuccessful, nothing fur
ther was to be done. The People's party State organization is in the hands of the
fusionists, and the same Is true in most of the counties. In addition the present
fusion agreement made at the Democratic State convention and signed by the com
mittees of the three parties binds the Populists to another fusion in 1900. Under the
existing laws affecting political parties a violation of a political trust cannot be en
forced by the courts and the only way in which the members of a party can punish
desertion or abandonment of the party or party treason is by defeating It at the bal
lot box. It Is evident that there is no remedy against fusions other than to defeat
them. Having done all In our power tÂ«> preserve the party we find that we have
gained the respect of all fair-minded men In all parties whose respect is worth hav
ing, and as under the present laws we ar? deprived by the fusion managers from
having a People's party ticket, all those who are opposed to fusions and believe
they ought to be defeated will judge for themselves how to cast their votes most
effectually to secure that end.
In conclusion we urgre that all whn believe In our immortal principles stand by
their convictions until their final establishment.
By order of the executive committee. DOUGLAS T. FOWLER, Chairman.
CARLETON H. JOHNSON, Secretary.
After the conference adjourned, L. H. Chester, chairman of the local
county committee of the middle-of-the-road men, expressed himself fully
and unqualifiedly concerning the fusion deal. "We worked hard and faith
fully," said he, "to build up the Populist party and make it a reform or
ganization. All our work is now undone, for fusion was never contem
plated by those who entered the party with sincere motives. There is one
remedy, however, and that is the ballot. If the straight Populists will
only rem;iin true to themselves they will work hard and earnestly to de
feat the f unionists. I, for one. Intend starting my ballot with the name of
Henry T. Gage and going down the whole line, stamping optwsite the name
of every Republican candidate. In 1596 over 21,000 Populists, who were op
posed to fusion, voted against the Bryan fusion electors. I am convinced
that fully 90 per cent of that 21,000 will cast their ballot next election day
for Gage and the entire Republican ticket."

city after a tour lasting about eight
months in Europe. During his absence
Mr Dohrmann has visited alj>m the prin

to observe and make a study of the
municipal conditions of the cities of other
Another matter to which the local mer
chant has paid not a little attention was
the colleges of commerce, the desire be

of Commerce is to a great extent in
debted to the Merchants' Association for
its existence, as this branch of learning
has for years been one of Mr. Dohrmann's
hobbies, hence his interest in similar es
tablishments elsewhere.
On the subject of municipal improve
ments the traveler is not yet ready to
talk, as he proposes to make known his
views through the association over which
he presides. He would not even make
comparisons, although he admitted that
San Francisco will stand many improve

ARE AFRAID LEES
IS A KIDNAPER
MRS. BOTKIN'S CASE AGAIN BE
FORE THE COURT.
George A. Knight Accuses the Chief
of Threatening to Spirit His
Client Out of the State.
George A. Knight is fearful that unless
some disposition is made of Â»the habeas
corpus proceedings in the case of Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin she will be spirited away
by the overzealous Chief^of Police, Isaiah
Lees. The woman charged with the mur
der of Mrs. John P. Dunning and Mrs.
Deane appeared in court yesterday morn
ing, accompanied by her counsel, and a
lively half-hour session followed. Knight
addressed the court and stated that he
did not propose that any further delay
should take place in the matter of the
habeas corpus proceedings.' and demand
ed that the writ be returned immediately
for the court's decision. Judge Cook
failed to view the matter in the same
light, and stated that he would be ready
and willing to take the case up im
mediately after the Governor issues the
warrant for Mrs. Botkins extradition.
This did not please Knight. He said
unless the court made some protective
order Lees might take the law in his own
hands and spirit his client out of
the way. "What is there to prevent L< ea
from kidnaping Mrs. Botkin and spirit
ing her out of the way?" said Knight. It
is understood that he has openly boasted
to Gc vernor Budd that he was willing
to take the risk; that it merely involved
a fine of $500 and imprisonment in the
Oounty Jail for five days in the event of
conviction for contempt of court, and he
thought he could 'stand that.' On thia
statement Judge Cook made an or
der holding Mrs. Botkin in custody until
Tuesday next. By that time it 1b ex
pected that the Governor's warrant will
nave arrived and the way made clear for
the consideration of the writ of habeas
corpus.
Lees was present in court when Knight
intimated that he (Lees) might walk out
of the State with his client, and he took
exception to the remark. Lees said it
was true that he had made the remark
attributed to him, but it was only made
to a counter threat made by Knight that
there were fifty-two counties in the State
and that Lees would be hauled before
the court in each and every one before
he would be allowed to extradite Mrs.
Botkin on any warrant from Governor
Budd or legal paper whatsoever.
Governor Budd will issue a warrant on
the requisition of the Governor of Dela
ware for the arrest and transferrence to
that State of Mrs. Botkin. charged with
murdering Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane
by means of poisoned candy sent to them
through the mail. Yesterday the
Governor caused the warrant for the ar
rest of Mrs. Botkin to be filled out, after
which Secretary of State Brown affixed
his signature to it. The Governor, how
ever, did not affix his signature to the
document, but he will do so as soon as
he considers that the proper time has
arrived.
PHILADELPHIA REACHES PORT.
Admiral Miller Returns After Rais

SCORES JUDGE MAGUIRE
The Unflattering Washington Record of the
Pinto Nominee for Governor
Laid Bare.
A Great Concourse of Voters Assembled at Odd Fellows'
Hall Last Evening to Listen to the Ora
torical Efforts of Republican
Statesmen.
Fifteen hundred people listened last
rlpht with an attention that wa' taken
only by round upon round of applause
as each telling point was developed to
the undoing of James Gallagher Maguire
by Congressman Eugene F. Loud, who
has. since the Fifty-second Session, so
ably represented the Fifth District and
the State in Congress.
With the skill of a surgeon the speaker
cut away the beauty skin of the three
pronged fusioniet's record and laid it
quivering and unlovely in the sight of
his hearers; with all the force of hard
Anglo-Saxon he stripped the facts of Ma-
grulre's Congressional career of the floss
of fine verbiage and uncorroborated state
ment that the "people's nominee" and his
adherents have woven round them, and
grave to the laughter of his audience the
CONGRESSMAN EUGENE F. LOUD.
puny skeleton of truth that survived the
operation.
"With Maguire's Congressional record
many well-informed speakers have al
ready dealt, but not until L,oud. who has
been associated with him through all his
Washington career, took the rostrutn last
evening was the story clearly and con
nectedly told. So little remains of the
blacksmith's badly memorized story that
the remains cannot be identified.
The speaker of the evening was intro
duced by Irving M. Bcott in one of that
gentleman's characteristic speeches* Af
ter summing up the public life of Mr.
Loud and paying him many pretty com
pliments he referred to him as a ma.i
â who, he was sure, "had no relatives in
either Delaware or Jersey and had never
been known to advocate a tax theory of
any description."
Three hearty cheers greeted Mr. Loud
whÂ«-n he threw aside his coat and bowed
himself pleasantly into the k<Â»><l graces of
â¢â  â  people to whom he was to speak. "I
am gratified," he raid, "at this welcome,
not alone because it pleases mo person
ally, but it is an echo of the goodwill that
Is bei.nÂ« shouted in and about every Re
publican gathering in the State to-niath>.
"When Mr. Maguire returned to Cali
fornia !"r..m Washington he at once began
to abuse my colleague, Mr. Barham. Ha
alleged that he hud been recreant to his
trust in not voting for what Mr. Magulre
wi a pleased to call a funding bill, and
charged him v.-ith about everything Â«lso
that sounded well to Maguire through the
newspa] ers. He also charged me with
the same crimes In the political category
and, until to-day, I have attempted no
explanation.
"He said that some day I might explainâ
I Bhall, and I shall find no need for sac
rificing truth even to the ends of politic*.
(.Applause.,)
"If Maguire had told the whole truthâ
and he knew he did notâ he would nave
told you that In Congress we have, for the
betterment of our work, a system known
there as pairing. That Is, we find some
other man of our. politics aud belief and
strike up a partnership with him. If- I
should leave my 'pair' represents me on
the floor and my interests do not suffer.
When the funding bill, bo called, came up
my 'pair,' Congressman Richardson of
Tennessee, had been called home by the
serious sickness of a relative, and I stood
In his place upon the floor of the House,
and for him I was obliged to vote, and
not for myself. I think that disposes of
that proposition.
"Mr. Maguire Is pleased to call this
amendment to deficiency bill a 'funding
bill.' It â was draughted to suit thÂ« times
by the biggest and brainiest men of Con
' gress, and had he wanted to Maguire
could have killed It In Its conception by
a Pimple objection and In this way: When
the- bill was being prepared Senator White
asked me one morning to tell Magulre to
come over and fix it up with the rest of
the committee. I told Maguire and he
went, and all that was necessary to de
feat it then was an objection from him.
"Why didn't he make it? I don't know,
unless he saw himself slipping from the
hobby horse on which he had ridden into
six years of prominence.
"When that bill came on th* floor Sen
ator White, who Is head and shoulders
above every other California Democrat
In Washington, voted for it, as did every
one of the eighty-nine Senators with him.
"Must we assume that all of the vested
virtue and brains In Congress are pos
sessed by Maguire?
"Maguire has had the credit out here
in California of having defeated every
funding bill that has come up since 1892.
In Congress each Representative Is al
lowed to speak for Just five minutes on
measures under consideration, and it Is
the custom for each side to select the
man who can most clearly and concisely
and without bias present the case.
When the so called Reilly refunding bill
came up in 1892 they thought so much of
Magoiire that he s#oke for just five min
utes. And, gentlemen, In that five min
utes Mr. Maguire defeated the funding
bill.
"In 1894 the Powers funding measure
came up, and upon its first consideration
Maguire was offered another five minutes.
He reserved It for the debate, when he
had five minutes more. An<l, gentlemen,
in those ten minutes Mr. Maguire defeat
ed the Powers bill.
"This last bill he could have defeated
at the start, but in committee there are
no newspaper men, so he waited till he
had the floor. Then, by hin vote, he
alleged possession of more brains than
Steve White and almost all the rest of
California's representation.
"In a recent ispue of the Examiner Ma
guire refers to 'the revenue cutter now
lying in San Francisco Bay.' built by vir
tue of an act promulgated by him which
has Bince become world famous; also to
the 'postofnea appropriation and bill for
re-examination of the postofflce site,' and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOREB 9, 1698.
to numerous other bills which he men
tions to illustrate his services in Con
gress.
"That postoftlce appropriation was
made four years before either of us went
to Congress, and as you well know, the
're-examination' of the postofflee site* re
sulted in nothing but more delay.
"In the first session of the Fifty-third
Congress Mr. ~-aguire introduced a bill
to provide a revenue cutter for San Fran
cisco harbor. The bill was favorably re
ported by Mr. Maliory. and on October
23, 1893, Mr. Maliory called up a mil in the
House to provide revenue cutters for me
great lakes, and I" offered a substitute for
this bill providing for a revenue cutter
for San Francisco harbor, making an ap
propriation of $50.jw, and in practically
tne same language as in the Maguire
bill. After some debate, during which
much opposition was shown on the part
of the men having the great lakes bill, in
charge to the adoption of the substitute,
I announced that the bill which I had of
fered as a substitute had been introduced
by Mr. Maguire, and that Mr. Maguire
had requested thnt it be withdrawn,
which was therefore done. Nothing more
was done with the measure during that
session of Congress. O" July 26, 1894, dur
ing the second session of the Fifty-third
Congress, Mr. Wis*, chairman of the
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, called up the bill, and with
out any debate it was passed. It went to
the Senate, was referred to the commit
tee, and on July 30 reported to the Senate
by Senator White without amendment.
On August 8, 1E94. it was called up by
Senator Perkins and passed by the Senate
without donato. It was signed by Presi
dent Cleveland on August 15. 1594. Bills
providing for a revenue cutter service at
San Francisco were also introduced in
the first session of the Fifty-third Con
gTess by Senator White (S. 904) and by
Mr. Unborn (H. R. 271).
"In Washington all that Mr. Maguire
has credit for is drawing his pay and
jogging round the country preaching sin
gle taxâ and for the passage of the Dun
don bill.
"This leader of the Democratic party
also claims that the Republicans claim
the late war as their own. We do not.
It was a war that confronted every' party
and every man of this country. It was
every man's war until it was declared.
Then you could see where the line was
drawn. Why! Mapiiire and his ilk would
not vote the money to pay our soldiers
and sailors or to feed them as they lay
in the trenches because the bill proposed
to raise the money from the people on the
country's bonds and. he thought we were
pirates anyway. They voted bonds at 6
and 4 per cent before, but it was against
their principles to vote them at 3 to feed
a lot of soldiers."
With Maguire and his "common people"
and the wrong the revenue tax has
worked upon them, Mr. Loud dealt at
length. Said he: "You'd think that these
'poor people' had nothing else to do than
?end telegrams and packages by Wells-
Fargo, or fix their names to checks. The
tax is one upon the rich who have to
and can afford to use those things."
With an eloquent exposition of the par
ty's platform and a plea for a solid vote
and one that will hold up the hands of
President McKinley In these troublous
Limes, the speaker gave way to Judge R.
B. Carpenter.
With his usual combination of depth
and wit Judge Carpenter added to the
calling down of the "People's own" with
the knowledge that he had gained of his
subject in years of active politics. He
closed with a eulogy of Congressman
Loud that was approved by every one of
his hearers by three lusty cheers and a
tiger.
Before the applause had subsided W.
H. Barnes, grand scribe of the Odd Fel
lows, was introduced by Irving M. Scott.
It was Mr. Barnes' maiden effort at polit
ical speech-making, but his splendid tes
timonial to Congressman Loud was but
the stronger for that. He spoke from
the knowledge that twenty years of fra
ternal association with the man that he
was seconding had given him, and in
closing he said: "If for twenty years a
man has been true to his fraternal vows
and has never faltered in giving his
time, his heart and his money to the
needs of the widows and the orphans of
hie brothers and to nis Drothers them
selves; if he is a man that can be trusted
in these things, then I have no fear In
trusting him in Congress. Such a man
Eugene F. Loud has beÂ«n rttj *Â»*â¢*â  â¢â¢"

FLATTERING RECEPTIONS
GIVEN TO CANDIDATES
Henry T. Gage Fittingly Closes a Week Marked
by a Succession of Grand
Ovations.
The Standard-Bearer, Hon. Charles L. Patton, the Next Mayor,
and Other Republican Nominees Address Two
Gatherings of Enthusiastic
Citizens.
If there was any doubt In the minds
of residents pf this city that the Mis
sion will not cast a Bolid vote for Ua*!i
F. Fragley, Judge D. J. Murphy, I. J.
Truman, and in fact the whole of the
Republican ticket from Henry T. Gage
to the lowest office, that doubt would
have been speedily removed had they at
tended the mass meeting held by the
Thirty-fifth Assembly District Republi
can Club last evening in Stanford H ill,
at the junction of Valencia and Mission
streets.
The hall was overcrowded with the vot
ers of the district, who took every oppor
tunity to cheer the name of every candi
date present and every sentiment of the
gentlemen who addressed thorn. In the
audience were many ladies who were not
less warm in their signs of approval.
H. T. Smith, who presided over the big:
meeting; made an ideal officer. He not
only Infused enthusiasm in those present,
but introduced each speaker in a manner
that made him feel at home.
W. H. Cobb, candidate to the Assembly
from the district, was first introduced.
His appearance was the signal for
hearty cheering, which was Intensified
as the evening wore on, Mr. Cobb de
voted his time to a discussion of the grand
â work done by the Republican party. He
â was frequently interrupted with applause.
During his speech, Charles L. Patton,
Judge Murphy and William A. Deane en
tered the hall, and as they moved toward
the platform they were greeted with the
wildest cheering. Judge Murphy mag
nanimously pointed to Mr. Patton as de
serving of their applause, and his act
brought forth more cheers.
At the conclusion of Mr. Cobb'a address
the Republican Glee Club, headed by the
only Sam Booth, sang about the Demo
cratic-Popocratic party going up Salt
River on the Sth of November. The words
and music made such a favorable impres
sion that the quartet was induced to tell
in song the good traits of their party's
standard bearer, Henry T. Gage.
Chas. F. Curry was next Introduced, and
made a happy speech, in which he said:
"All I Intended saying was, 'How are.
you?' and 'Good-night,' as there are so
many able speakers to follow me. There
are one or two words I have to say. I
have listened with a great deal of pleas
ure to Mr. Cobb's speech. The Thirty
fifth District has been wasted two or
three timÂ«s in the past, but it is not go
ing to be wasted this time, as I am sure
Mr. Cobb is going to be elected. (Ap
plause.) I wish also to impress on you
that you want to elect Mr. Loud to Con
gress. (Applause.) And Mr. Patton will
make that false alarm, James D. Phelan,
go before a notary public on the 9th day
of November and swear that he was run
ning. Good-by and good luck." (.Hearty
applause.)
In presenting Mr. GagÂ© to the voters of
the district Mr. Smith said that on the
Sth of November when James G. Magulre
"gages" up his votes he will find that
he will be short some 3000 which should
have come from the Thirty-fifth District.
As the Republican candidate for guber
natorial honors stepped forward the
crowd rose to their feet and for three
minutes cheered and waved thetr hats
for him.
Mr. Gage thanked the audience for its
kindly reception and said: "1 have been
campaigning now for many days. I have
spoken, although the Examiner says I
have not, sixteen times these last seven
days. They tell you soirre other fellow
has spoken, and that is like the man who
says his headache hurt by reason of the
bad whisky his neighbor drank the day
before. (Laughter.) My voice is in
good repair now and I hope it will con
tinue so. At all events, it will not De
Interfered with on account of any abuse
of any candidate that parses through my
throat. 1 set that example for others to
follow.
"I am Just now impressed with the Blb
ical doctrine that we should rest one day
in seven, and I promise you, Mr. Chair
man, I shall assume to-morrow is the
seventh day.
"With all joking aside, gentlemen. thl3
magnificent demonstration in this part of
the city indicates to me that the people
in this region of the country have care
fully weighed all the facts in this con
troversy and have decided in favor of the
Republican party." (Applausi.*
Mr. Gage then discussed the single-tax
hobby of his opponent and explained
some of the dire results that would en
sue If the anarchistic laws Mr. MagulrÂ«
advocates are foisted on the country. lie
then addressed himself to the charges
that have been repeatedly made against
him that he was a railroad hireling.
"A more foul and infamous calumny,"
he said, "was never asserted against a
man than that declaration In re
gard to myself. (Applause.) I say now
that there is not an honest man who has
been with me and knows my relations
with corporations would make that as
sertion, unless he was guided by a cor
rupt and infamous purpose. Most of the
scoundrels that I have known to have
aspired for office have howled against the
Southern Pacific Company to get there.
The Southern Pacific has been and is
guilty of sins and we can restrain it by
law, and Jf ever I get the gubernatorial
chair, I will see that it is the right of the
people to regulate fares and rates by
law."
Mr. Gage entered into a glowing de
scription of this city as being a big com
mercial center, and tlKinked his listeners
for their attention. They cheered and
called him back and he talked ten minutes
longer on what the people would get If
he was elected. The cheers that greeted
him at the conclusion shook the hall. HÂ«s
then walked down the aisle, shaking
hands with every one.
Mr. Patton's reception was not less en
thusiastic than the Governor's, and his
clear cut sentences were loudly applaud
ed. He was followed in turn by Hon. D.
J. Murphy, I. J. Truman, W. A. Deane
and Martin F. Fragley. All made short
addresses and were enthusiastically re
ceived. The reception accorded Mr. Frag
ley was a feature of the meeting. He.
like Judge Murphy and Mr. Truman, was
among his neighbors and they showed
their love and appreciation of the candi
date for Superintendent of Streets by
cheering him en the least provocation.

GAGE AT THE BEACH.
He Addresses an Enthusiastic
Meeting Under the Shadow
of Telegraph Hill.
The noisiest, most demonstrative meet
ing of the present Republican campaign
was held last night under the auspices of
the Forty-fourth District Club in Bersag
llcrl Hall, over against th-e shadow of
Telegraph Hill. The hall was crowded
chiefly by representative men of the L;itin
ra< os, and each speaker, in his turn, was
greeted with the wildest enthusiasm.
Henry T. Gage did not arrive until late
in the evening, and it was thought those
in attendance had exhausted their ener
gies. This was not so, however, as they
made the auditorium ring again and again
with their cheers. Hats were thrown in
the air amid the wildest excitement. The
greeting was so kindly and so warm as
to touch Mr. Gage deeply.
He told ~of the strain that had been
placed upon his voice by his efforts in the
campaign, and apologized for his inability
to speak at any length. He expressed his
deep feeling of gratitude for the reception
accorded him, which he said was merely
a reflection of the people's devotion to the
Republican party and Â»the interests for
Which it stands.
At the conclusion of his addres? he held
a levee upon the floor of the hall, and
all those In attendance pressed forward
to shake him by the hand.
Many had left the hall when Charles
L,. Patton. the candidate for Mayor, came
in, attended by Justice Frank H. Kerri
gan and others. Judge Kerrigan was
hidden under the shade of a black som
brero such as Mayor Phelan now affects.
With the announcement of Mr. Patton's
arrival, the hall filled rapidly again and
a speech was demanded from him. He
was introduced by Henry Martin, the
Herculean candidate for Sheriff. At first
he would onr>- gay that as the meeting
had been dismissed he would come at an
other time. This was not considered a
valid excuse by his auditors, so he told
them of his candidacy, saying that he
knew he would win the fight "in a walk,"
and that every man on the Republican
ticket from Governor Henry T. Gage
down to Justice of the Peace Frank H.
Kerrigan, would be elected. He assured
them that the Republicans would give
them an honest, fearless, business-like ad
ministration of which they could be proud.
His sentiments struck home and he was
applauded repeatedly and given an ova
tion when he went among the people.
The meeting, over which Dr. Campbell
Ford presided, was rich in speakers, al
though few of them attempted any flights
of oratory. Their sentiments regarding
the work of the Republican party during
the administration of President Mclvin
ley and of the promise for the future,
never failed to bring a cheer for the Re
publican party and for Old Glory. The
speakers included, besides Mr. Gago and
Mr. Patton, Thomas F. Graham, Julius
Kahn, A. B. Treadwell, A. C. Berthler, C.
A. Low, D. J. Toohy, A. Meyer, Charles
F. Curry, A. Ruef, Judge E. C. Hart and
Henry Martin.
Mr. Ruef spoke strongly against the
candidacy of Mayor Phelan, saying the
people resent his assumption of author
ity, not desiring one man to run the
Democratic party. He ha 3 taken it out
of the hands of the people and practically
says to them that he Is the entire Demo
cratic party. Mr. Patton will "wipe the
floor" with him on election day, because
of the Republican principles for which he
stands.
County Clerk C. F. Curry paid his re
spects to the Democratic boss also, es
pecially as to his attitude toward the
workingmen in advocating the cutting of
their wages.
Julius Kahn called upon the voters to
indorse the administration of President
McKinley. saying they owed it as a duty
to their city, their State and their coun-
try.
D. J. Toohy, one time strong in t,ho
Democratic party, indorsed each of the
Republican candidates who had addressed
the meeting.
The meeting was enlivened by a brass
band, which supplied music whenever the
spell-binders present afforded it an oppor
tunity. Jabez Swan also provided some
incidental divertissement in the guise of
campaign songs set to popular music.

REAL ESTATE MEN
AGAINST BOSSISM
WILL ASK PROPERTY OWNERS
TO SUPPRESS IT.
An Organization Already Called Into
Existence â Signatures of Those
in Favor of It.
The real estate firm of A. M. Speck &
Co., together with a number of realty
brokers, have organized an action against
political bossism which they will en
deavor to have enforced regardless of
party fealty. The main purpose of the
scheme is outlined in the following reso
lution and has already found many ad
herents:
To the Voters and -Owners of Real Property
Â«f the City and County of San Francisco:
Political parties In San Francisco have be
come vile barterers.
Laws are not honestly enforced, the money of
the tax payer is squandered through the so
called political bosses that dominate the par
ties.
We believe the time for action has come;
that good citizens Irrespective of party fealty
should unite in a strong and determined ef
fort to suppress these practices by becoming
members of the Real Estate Agents" and Prop
erty Owners' Association.
This Is a self-protection proposition that re
quires our earnest attention; it Is a movement
at the present time that will mold the destiny
of this city. We want to place ourselves In
the hands of honest, reliable men and improve
the advantage that we now have within our
grasp: We should prepare ourselves for the
reception of the new business opportunities
now thrown open to us by the now probable
acquisition of the Sandwich and Philippine
Islands, also by the construction of the Nicara
gua canal. Wharves should be constructed for
the accommodation of commerce. Workshops
and factories should be constructed and oper
ated for supplying the wants of trade In those
countries.
Our desire Is to create such conditions In
this city that all idle houses shall be filled by
happy and prosperous families and induce idle
capital to Invest here and in the vicinity. To
the above end you are invited to Join in con
vention to select such persons for office as will
bring the above much-desired results.
We, the undersigned property owners of this
city pledge ourselves to become members of
the Real Estate Agents' and Property Owners'
Association, and we agree to meet In a con
vention to indorse worthy municipal candidates
from the nominations of the respective parties,
and promise to use our best efforts in securing
the election of such men as shall be indorsed
by the Real Estate Agents' and Property Own
ers' Convention, which Is to be held on Octo
ber 10. 11 and 12, at a hall selected by the
PI The 'obligation of this agreement is volun
tary no fees are to be received for such serv
ices ' With the object of good government we.
the ' undersigned, have subscribed our names
to become members of this association:
J X Prior. John McNally, W. O. Watson,
A - F Lejeal. Ralph Harding. M. I. Johnson.
Â£ H. SW. A. M. Speck. E. K. Clarke. Daniel
Kelly, Charles Sladky. L. Metzger. E. L,. At
kinson, Captain William Ede, I. Harris, Ben
jamin Lichtensteln.
According to A. M. Speck, the prime
mover In the enterprise, the organization
will not be simply called into existence
for the present political campaign, but
will be a permanent proposition. The ob
ject is to get the principal property own
ers in the city interested and thereby
bring about a crushing defeat to bossism
and the tyranny of the Board of Super
visors It is considered absolutely neces
sary that something should be done to
prevent real estate from totally depreciat
ing in value, and if this combination of
property owners against the prime evils
which are threatening the future of the
market can be effected, the salvation, as
it were, of the "realty world" will bo
speedily insured.
It is expected that at least fifty or more
names will be added to those already on
the list' next Monday afternoon at the
meeting which is called for that date.

didate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cati,
908 Broadway. Oct. 8.
A search of the political record of the
past four years shows that the Populist
and Democratic parties are fast disap
pearing in this county. In 1594 Budd re
ceived 6"St> votes, M. M. Estee 8150 and J.
V. Webster (Pop.) 4531. This shows a to
tal of 11,317 fusion votes against Estee'a
8150.
In 1896, when there was fusion, the Peo- '
ple's party polled 192 votes for its Presi- i
dential Electors, the Democrats 8202, whilÂ« .
McKinley was given 13,429 votes, or a ma
jority of 5035. These figures show that in I
the two years prior to 1596 the anti-Re- -
publican vote uecreased 3000, while the
Republican vote increased over 6000. Sine* j
that time there has been in this county
a further split in the ranks, and although
the total vote may not be so large as in
a Presidential year it is expected that
Gage's majority over Maguire will be at .
least double that of Estee over Budd.
This would give Gage a majority of about
31110.
The vote of the Socialist Labor party
Is being watched with considerable inter- .
est, as much work has been done by local
organizers since 1896, which was the first
year the party name . a^ieared on tha
ticket. The President'al Electors of the
Socialistic Labor men received 101. votes
in Alameda County, ana this year the
leaders are claiming at least 1200 votes.
At the meeting a month ago at the Taber
nacle there were present about- 1500 neo
Â§le, who listened to Job Harriman, the
ocialist candidate for Governor, and
from the amount of support claimed for
him as a result of that demonstration the
figures mentioned have been arrived at.
The Independent Republicans are very
anxious that they should not be accred
ited with lack of enthusiasm for the State
Republican ticket. They have opened
their headquarters in the same building
as the regular County Republican Com
mittee, and each is vicing with the other/
in decorating the approaches to their re
spective headquarters with pictures of
Gage and Neff. After entering the builq
ing it is a matter of guesswork which /
the* headquarters is that of the Sim*
pure Republican party, although a glarÂ«
at their respective county tickets does
leave any doubt on that score. . /
A. W. Bishop, for a long time secrecy
of the Republican County Central f?
mittee, has filed his netiaon to go m"9
ballot as a candidate for the office o/, 3
Justice. Mr. Bishop is one of the o/ In 8

THE DISTRICT OTTORNEYSHIP.
rOK the enforcement of law in San Francisco,
for the prevention or the punishment of crime
by a feai ient prosecution of crim
inals, ther â  ed in the office of District Attorney
ix lawyer well versed in criminal law. strong of will
and ;.' .. devoted to the faithful performance of
his duty. All citizens are aware of the importance
of the office, and none can be ignorant of the impera
tive need of electing the right man to the place.
The Republican party presents as its candidate
the District Attorneyship Judge Daniel J. Mur;
The Committee of Due Hundred, a- self-constituted
representative I ised factions of Democracy and
Popul c nominated against him Barclay Hen
ley. Both men are well known. Their records and
the salient features of the character of each are
familiar to the people. Under such circumstances
there ought to be no doubt as to which will be
elected. The vote for Judge Murphy should include
the ballot of every citizen who does not belong to the
criminal element or who is not athliated with political
sorer.^
The course of Barclay Henley has been erratic and
â le. to say the best that can be said of it. He
has in times past, when it suited his caprice or the
interests of his personal fortunes, bolted his party and
even his citizenship. He has been ty turns a so
called independent in politics or a Mexican in citi
lip, as it suited him. In none of his various
phases, however, has he ever rendered service to the j
city or won honor for himself.
The career of Judge Murphy is a striking contrast
to that of his opponent. He rose from the rank? of
the peopie to his present eminence in his profession
by honest steps and by a straightforward course. His
progress has been consistently upward, and every
test of difficulty or responsibility has proven the ster
ling â  if ljis intellect, his manhood and his
patriotism.
His fitness for the office to which he has been nom
inated is indisputable. The proofs of it are to be
found at every sta.qe of his carter. He ranks among
the foremost criminal lawyers of the State. While
serving some years ago as District Attorney he
showed himself to be one of the most resolute prose
cutors of crime in the annals of American law.
Called to the office of Superior Judge, he demon
strated in that field a mastery of all the complexi
ties of our criminal law. precedents and practice, and
a Roman firmness in enforcing them.
The trial of the Durrant case afforded the public a
striking illustration of Judge Murphy's wide knowl
edge of criminal law, and his impartial justice in ad
ministering it. As is well known, the prosecution of
Durrant was fought by able attorneys with every
legal weapon and by every strategy of court practice
known to our law. Exception after exception was
taken by the counsel for the defense; every ruling
of the Judge to which their ingenuity could find a
possible objection was noted. Yet when all these ex
ceptions and objections were carried on appeal to the
Supreme Court that tribunal sustained Judge Murphy
on every point. It was a vindication of his judicial
course of which any magistrate might be proud, and
stands to-day a* a convincing evidence of his honor
able record on thr. bench.
The people of San Francisco should account it an
honor and a good-fortune to have the opportunity to
obtain the service of this able lawyer in the office of
District Attorney. The conditions of the time call for
just such a man in that office ; and the voters will be
false to themselves and the city if they fail to elect
him.
RIGHTS OP PUGILISTS.
WHEN in active pursuit of his calling the pugi
list is a lav.--breaker, but so is every one who
promotes a ring event or views the spectacle.
Between times the pugilist is apt to be a loafer, often
an actual vagrant, and in many instances a bully.
Nevertheless, a pugilist, while conducting himself
properly, has rights.
Not long ago Corbett and McCoy engaged in a
runian encounter in a New York hotel. Naturally
the proprietor was displeased. Several days later
Fitzsimmons entered the place, decently clad, wholly
sober, quiet as any other guest, interfering with none,
and to all outward seeming a gentleman. The propri
etor refused to permit him to dine, and ordered him to
leave. This Fitzsimmons did, and, be it said to his
:rcdit, without assaijing the solar plexus of the man
ho had publicly insulted him and humiliated him.
To an unbiased judge it would seem that the pugi
f. showed signs of better breeding than displayed
the proprietor. The matter will be tested in the
M:s. If there was justice in excluding Fitzsim-
n s on the ground that somebody else had misbe
"i, justice in New York is a peculiar thing. The
P 1 etor should have assumed the lofty ground that
,1 hair of the fighter did not harmonize with the
lm of the dining-room.
MAGUIRE ON THE MINERS.
IN his speech at the Woodward Pavilion Mr. Gage
read from Maguirc's speech in Congress the ex
tension of his land confiscation theory to the
mines. The Judge regards the prospector who finds
a ledge or locates a placer as a monopolist who is
taking from God's children that which is intended for
the good of all. This cant, indulged in by Judge ila
guirc and the defender of his defense of anarchy, Mr.
Preble, is one of the conspicuous features of the cam
paign against law and order and the rights of prop
erty which the Judge has carried on for years.
His present speeches for the masses against the
classes are in line with the opinions he has heretofore
uttered against property and its owners. To him
every successful man is in a "class." Having quit
labor himself in early life and begun holding office
and drawing a salary when he began to vote, if not
a couple of years before, and having never lived since
that time except upon a salary as an office-holder, his
accumulations bridging him over between offices,
Maguire has but little knowledge of the practical ex
periences of life.
He has made up his mind that it is good politics
to conclude that every successful man has succeeded
at the expense of some one who has failed. He does
not consider the element of personal character as a
factor in failure or success. To him the successful
man is a "rich man" and the enemy of the "poor."
He sees only the failures in the social state and not
the successes which vindicate the social order. He
has succeeded in becoming the candidate of failures.
It is not employing invective at all to say that he
shows a venemous temper against such property
owners as he believes to be in the minority and there
fore helpless against the majority, which he urges to
despoil them. The land-owner and the mine-owner
are the special objects of his venom and vengeance.
They are in hi? mind and mouth the enemies of God,
as he characterized them in his letter to McGlynn.
They have no property rights to their lands and mines
which Maguire feels bound to respect. Using his own
language, they are "monopolists, cunning robbers
who have despoiled the weak and undesigning," and
what they call their own, their lands and mines, must,
under his policy, be taken away from them.
It is true, lie says that his land and mines confisca
tion theory is not in issue in this campaign. But, not
long ago. he said that when an amendment is pro- j
posed to give the people of each county the right to j
put all taxes on land and so confiscate it "the fight
will be on in earnest."
Well, that fight is on, for that is the purpose of
amendment No. 2 to the State constitution, which his
single tax junta lobbied through the last Legislature.
That amendment and his candidacy put land confisca
tion in issue. Suppose that Judge Maguire had said
in print and speech, in addresses to the Delaware
Legislature and in Congress: "If an amendment to
the constitution of California gives the Governor
the power to hang every land-owner and mine
owner and give his property equally to God's chil
dren, and I am ever elected Governor, the fight will
be on in earnest," and then when he became a can
didate with such an amendment pending, would any
land-owner or miner believe him if he said
that matter was not in issue? Would any land-owner
in California risk hanging by permitting ,Maguire's
election? No matter how much he might protest
that hanging them was not an issue, they would not
trust him.
Is he any the more worthy of belief when, after ad
vocating the confiscation of lands and mines for
years, and having foretold what would bring on the
fight against that form of property, and the precise
situation is upon us. he says it is not in issue?
All that a man hath he will give for his life, and his
life depend? upon what sustains it. The despoiling of
property-owners is in issue in Maguire's candidacy,
and if this is forgotten the State may suffer the most
serious misfortune that can befall a commonwealth.
PHELAN AND WIDBER.
IT is, for the ambitions of Mr. Fhelan, an unfortu
nate circumstance that just now his name should
be linked with that of a felon guilty of a gross
and inexcusable crime. Widber stole funds of which
he had been made custodian by reason of the confi
dence of the community in the honor of the family,
a confidence inspired by the probity of his father, to
whose official position he succeeded. Thus to theft
was coupled the baser crime of ingratitude.
The Mayor's connection with the looting of the
treasury was nothing to make him appear as in the
slightest degree a willing accessory. To so much as
hint at this would be both impolitic and untrue.
Doubtless the knowledge that the wrong had been
done came to the Mayor as a shock. It must have
come with the shock accentuated when the Mayor
had to realize that his own carelessness had made the
felony of Widber possible. This matter has been ex
plained many times, but it is one of the old, old
stories, ever, ever new.
One of the duties of jhe Mayor is to supervise the
counting of the money in the municipal vaults. Mr.
Phelan did not do this. The money was not even
weighed. It was "hefted." A dishonest Treasurer,
noting this method, could see at once that the oppor
tunity to steal was at hand. He could open the sacks,
remove the gold and fill them again with anything of
requisite weight. He adopted the plan thus suggested
by the Mayor's course, and now he goes to the peni
tentiary, while the Mayor wants to continue in a po
sition which will enable him to "heft" some more.
A defender of the Mayor, a paper given to yellow
spasms, explains blithely that only an insurance com
pany lost. What a complete, vindication! "Hefting"
is all right so long as the burden of the consequent
theft falls only upon a soulless corporation. The
reasoning does not seem good, but the implied state
of morals very bad indeed.
The dismissal of two policemen for cowardice
seems to have been just, so far as it went. There are,
however, two others who were as much in need of
dismissal and did not get it. They must have lucky
stars.
Perhaps the members of the Widber jury may
know why they were so slow in bringing in a verdict.
There has never been from the moment of the pris
oner's arrest the slightest doubt as to his guilt.
There is no doubt that if the pawnbrokers want
sympathy in the affliction of having received a set
back at the hands of the court, they will be obliged
to condole with one another.
At least the little trouble with the Indians in Min
nesota will demonstrate to the civil authorities that
even a red man should as a matter of policy be treated
decently.
Whatever may be the merit of the claims of ex-
Queen Liliuokalani. there is a certainty that a person
ousted from a throne has a right to feel sore about it.
Some day Widber may grow confidential and let
somebody know what he did with all the money he
stole.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1898.
FOR THE NATION'S WELFARE.
SUPREME among the issues submitted to the
votes of the people of the United States this
year is that of returning Republican majori
ties in both houses of Congress. We have in Califor
nia an important local issue in the contest against
the fused factions of discontent led by an erratic
politician, the advocate of land confiscation and the
apologist and defender of anarchy, but that should
not cause us to overlook or underrate broader affairs
of the nation.
We must not only defeat Maguire, but we must
send to the House of Representatives a solid Repub
lican delegation, and elect a Legislature that will
choose a stanch Republican to succeed Senator
White.
The national contest involves many issues, each of
which is of far-reaching importance not only to this
but to succeeding generations. The session remain
ing for the present Congress is short. It will hardly
be able to solve the great problems that confront the
country. It is, therefore, to the Congress to be
elected this fall that we must look for a settlement of
the currency on a safe basis, the construction of the
Nicaragua canal, the increase of the army and the
navy so as to make them equal to the requirements of
the nation, the extension of our commerce, the up
building of our merchant marine and the solution of
the many complex problems arising out of the war
with Spain.
With such momentous issues at stake a failure to
elect Republi&ins to both houses of Congress would
be as disastrous as would have been a Democratic
triumph during a critical period of our Civil War.
The administration needs the support of Congress,
and the country needs perfect harmony in all
branches of the National Government.
A feeling of apathy or of over-confidence on this
subject in California might be widely disastrous. We
must not let Congressional and legislative elections
go by default here in the expectation that Republi
cans elsewhere will make up for any falling short on
our part. We must do our share in assuring a Re
publican majority in both the Senate and the House.
From ail reports that come to us the success of the
State ticket seems certain. Mr. Gage has proven him
self to be a campaigner of the first rank. He has in
a high degree the faculty of winning the confidence of
the people and of making and retaining friends. His
personality and his clear record when compared with
the evasive tactics and demagogue career of Maguire
have virtually won for him the victory at this early
stage of the canvass. If the voting took place to-day
he would be elected, and his strength will increase as
the campaign progresses and the issues become bet
ter understood by the people.
Such being the outlook for the State ticket, all that
is needed in that direction is a continuance of the
energy and vigilance already displayed in its con
duct. In the fight for Congressmen and for members
of the Legislature, however, there is wanted more
activity, more vim, more earnestness. We must
send no free-trader nor free silver man to Congress
from California. We must have a delegation that will
truly represent our people, steadfastly maintain the
interests of our industries and uphold the adminis
tration in the great work that is before it.
Most important of all, from a national point of
view, is the election of a Republican to the United
States Senate. That is the danger point in the politi
cal situation. The Senate at present is virtually in a
state of deadlock. Every Republican vote gained in
that body will count immensely for the national wel
fare. At best the Republicans can hope to control the
Senate in the next Congress by but a small margin.
Every energy, therefore, must be put forth to gain
a Republican Senator wherever such gain is possible.
That fact should be impressed upon the mind of
each voter. A Republican Legislature and a Repub
lican United States Senator are necessities of the
crisis.
GENERAL WHEELER, who has returned
from the war with praise for all who took part
in it, from the officials of the War Department
to the colored troops who helped to win the fight at
Santiago, has not omitted the women from his com
mendation. He has suggested that the Government
should in some way show its appreciation of their
services, and confer honors upon those who nursed
the wounded in the hospitals as well as upon the men
who fought in the field.
The General did not undertake to define the form
of the honor which should be conferred. He ad
mitted that the difficulty in the way of providing suit
able recognition and reward for women who serve the
country in time of war was more than he could over
come. All that he has done is to suggest that some
honor should be given, leaving it to others to deter
mine the extent and the manner in which it should
be carried out.
The proposition has fallen upon fruitful soil. A
considerable number of persons and newspapers have
taken the subject under consideration and have in
some instances suggested plans for making the re
wards. Most of these advocate the granting of
medals of honor to the women whose work was of
distinguished merit, and pensions where money is
necessary to repay the sacrifices made by army
nurses.
This is a curious outcome of a short campaign
which began with a peremptory order from head
quarters that no women would be permitted to attend
the army. The service which was rejected at the be
ginning of hostilities by the war officials has at the
end come in for the highest praise from the most
popular of the commanding generals. It is another
triumph for womanhood over prejudice, and that in
itself will probably be regarded by most of the brave
women who won it as a sufficient reward for all they
endured and performed.
Whether the proposition of General Wheeler will
pass away and be forgotten before Congress meets
remains to be seen. It is more likely, however, that
it will lead to some attempt to obtain from Congress
a recognition of the heroic services of the women
and a suitable reward for those who, like Miss Clara
Barton and Miss Helen Gould, accomplished really
important work for the relief of the soldiers. If
medals and pensions should be out of the question, a
vote of thanks would be better than nothing. America
owes much to her women, and an official recognition
of the fact would do as much honor to the Govern
ment as to the women themselves.
Mississippi has no particular reason to be proud of
her Governor. At the first alarm of yellow fever he
fled from his post of duty and went into hiding. It
would serve him rightly if a few discerning microbes
were to search him out.
If Mayor Phelan's intention of vetoing a gas bill
is correctly reported, some of the Democratic orators
may justly tremble for their pay.
General Bacon's course has been marked by a total
absence of hysterics, and doos him credit as a
soldier.
HONORS FOR WOMEN.
WITH ENTIRE. FRANKNESS.
A correspondent writes from Red
ding to ascertain if the author of this
column is really and truly Jesse James
writing under another name. Perhaps
the query should have been answered
by mail, but there is* no stamp at hand.
If the secret is out there is no use of
pleading anything except the statute
of limitation. It has certainly been a
long time since I have robbed a train,
and, ever since the experience of hav
ing been killed by the Ford boys, noble
gentlemen who shot me in the back,
I have been addicted to less violent
pursuits. I only beg of the correspond
ent that she will regard this communi
cation as confidential.
It has never seemed to me a proper
thing for a minister of the gospel to
make violent love to the members of
his congregation. In a measure it de
stroys his usefulness, because others
of the members are apt to become
jealous. No, Rev. Briggs, do not think
I have you in mind. You have secured
a glorious vindication. I was impelled
to make the remark by a recollection
of the late C. O. Brown.
There is sometimes a disadvantage
in writing a bad hand. Joaquin Miller
writes one so bad that he cannot read
it himself, and why he should expect
anybody else to read it passes all un
derstanding. A young lady whose gra
cious presence ornaments the staff of
this paper is in a sad quandary over
his chirography. She has a letter from
the poet. For several days she has
pondered upon it. She has decided that
it is an invitation to dine at the heights
in the shadow of Joaquin's funeral
pyre, the description of an Alaskan
sunset or a recipe for cooking gum
boots. At other times she wavers and
believes she holds a treatise on "How
It Feels to Lose an Ear," or "The
Razor as a Curse to Civilization." I
would help her if I could, but she
showed me the letter, and I can't.
It befalls that sooner or later we all
feel the sting of ingratitude. With best
intent I have sung the praises of the
Delta Muser. Now he declares I know
nothing about poetry, and see in it no
point to admire but the ingenuity of
the author in making the words rhyme.
Yet I have seen much more in the
poetry of the Muser, and have pro
claimed It. To get it in the neck this
way is scant reward. I have a feeling
that the Oozer would not thus tear up
the feelings of a friend, and hereafter
pin my faith to him.

Of course It was a Kansas court
which was called upon to decide
whether a young man escorting a
young voman to a place of amuse
ment was legally bound to take her
home again. The court decided that he
was, a gallant decision from which
there will be no appeal. Yet supposing
the young couple went to a dance and
the lady flirted with everybody in sight,
! that it was a festival and she ate ice
cream with everybody but the one who
had paid the price of admission, that it
was a corn-husking and she declined
to accept the responsibility when her
escort stripped a red ear. There are
i two sides even to this question. When
I a girl accepts the protecting arm of
i the male Kansan there Is an implied
i contract by which both are bound. He
I undertakes to shield her and she to ap
! preciate the delicate attention. If she
throws him over the minute another
male appears on the scene it seems
to me the contract is broken, and when
she expects him to resume his place at
her side for a walk home she has more
cheek than becomes one of her lovable
sex. The real puzzle, however, is as to
; how such a matter ever got into court.
It should have been left to the query

There could be nothing more wicked
than the suggestion of dividing Swit
zerland among the robbing powers, ex
cept the act itself. France, Italy and
Germany would like a slice each. The
shamelessness of a larcenous nation is
beyond all comprehension. When a
safe-cracker has designs upon a bank
he hesitates about taking the world
into his confidence. When an organized
band of raiders ruled over by a mon
arch and of sufficient number to be
recognized as a Government decides to
â¢steal, it is rather inclined to boast
about it. The burglar has fear of the
police; civilization has no police to
cope with a gang of thieving nations.
In all excepting magnitude Switzerland
is vastly the superior of any of the
precious trio which proposes to despoil
her. France has for years been acting
as though on an absinthe debauch.
Italy has been steadily retrograding,
the King unable to control Its dissatis
fied people. Germany, under the
Kaiser, h;is been in constant danger
through that eminent gentleman's ten
dency toward the war-lording industry.
Meanwhile Switzerland has followed
the arts of unobtrusive peace, attended
to business and been rewarded by
prosperity. Each one of the decaying
or turbulent nations now threatening
the little republic could well take a
lesson from it in manners, morals,
bravery and patriotism.
From time to time people have been
reading of the brutality of the attaches
of the pound, to whom falls the duty
of corraling the errant dog. That no
particularly high-minded gentleman
would adopt this calling may
readily be believed, and yet it is
hard to understand why, after brief as
sociation with vagrant canines, the
pursuers should sink to a moral and in
tellectual plane below that of the pur
sued. As an individual the dog catcher
is most obnoxious. He is hated by
everybody. To* observe a dog escape
gives the beholder joy. For the small
boy, who, seeing the cart of the catch
ers coming, runs ahead to give warning
and shoo rash pups into the back yard,
the common heart goes out warmly.
He may be a naughty boy, too, and
playing hookey at the moment. Doubt
less the dog catcher is a necessity, but
this does not impose upon anybody the
duty of loving him. Several of these
fellows have lately subjected women
and children to violence. Most of them
seem to need a term in Jail and the
rest might be tamed by a sound
thumping. The strictest justice would
have them clapped into the pound and
fed on moldy dog biscuit.

Sometimes the Intelligence of an
Eastern paper, its wealth of informa
tion, is a pleasing surprise. In a re
cent number of the Cincinnati Commer
cial Tribune note was made of the fact
that Portland, Or., desired to buila one
of the new monitors, and the editor
added: "Go on. If the Olympia and
Oregon are fair samples of your work,
give the country a few more like
them." An impression had prevailed
here that the ships mentioned were
samples of the work done at the Union
Iron Works of San Francisco, a con
siderable city of California. Indeed,
this impression got abroad, and at
Washington was so trustfully accepted
that the Secretary of the Navy sent a
long letter of congratulation to the
management of the Union Iron Works
on the excellence of its product. Tha
people of San Francisco saw the Olym
pia and Oregon launched, saw them
steam proudly away, and still enter
tain the notion that they were built
here. What sort of a place is Cincin
nati anyhow? Is it the same seat of
culture which glories in the tradition
that once it packed more pork than any
other city in the Union?
Observing the progress of the Investi
gation into the management of the
medical and commissary departments
of the army one is not impressed by
the evidences of sincerity. It seems
to me that to question some of the sol
diers would be the way to ascertain
the truth. Let a few of the boys who
came back from Cuba, gaunt, ex
hausted, starving and neglected, take
the stand and tell about it, and then
let the responsible officers explain. No
body has ever charged that the offi
cers' mess was infected with rotten ba
con, or that an officer in need of a dosa
of quinine had to wait a week for it.
The allegation has been that the priv
ate soldier, a boy in many instances
as tenderly reared as the epauletted
gentleman commanding him, of as good
a family, as thorough a patriot, was
permitted to lie in the trenches before
Santiago with nothing to eat, although
there were stores at the wharf; that in
the hospital he lacked delicacies, not
withstanding the Red Cross had for
warded a plenteous amount. People
would like to know the truth about
these things. So far as the investiga
tion shall tend to souse Alger in a sea
of whitewash, I shall take the liberty
of regarding it as a fraud. No admir
ation for McKinley can make me think
his Secretary of War was ever fit to
hold the position.

Once more there has bobbed up the
old question as to the relation between
a newspaper man and a journalist.
There is a habit of regarding the term
"journalist" as a sign of affectation.
This habit is founded on a lack of
knowledge, and is in itself an affecta
tion. A man who earns his living by
writing for the daily press is a jour
nalist or a mistake. He has a right
to all the distinction the title affords.
It must be remembered that every em
ploye of a newspaper regards himself
as a newspaper man. The employes
who run linotype machines, make
stereotype plates, send out the mail,
sweep the office or stand in attitudes
of impressive dignity behind the coun
ter of the business department are all
newspaper men. They are as useful
as the people who write, but, neverthe
less, the people who write are not pre
sumptuous in asserting themselves to
be journalists. I know this is not a
popular view, not fashionable, not in
accord with the fad of insisting upon
being known simply as a newspaper
man. I strive to be a journalist. The
people with whom I intimately asso
ciate are journalists. When a writer
has a specific place to fill in the per
sonnel of a paper he may be otherwise
classified. There are the reporters, the
telegraph editors and the other editors.
Nevertheless the man whose implement
of toil is his pencil and whose business
is to make "copy," whatever may be
his temporary position, is a journalist,
and it is silly for him to deny it. If
he doesn't like the Job, there are others.
It Is strange that J. J. Valentine,
president of the Wells-Fargo Express
Company, cannot issue a circular with
out giving a Salvation Army twist to
it and slavering the document with the
exudation of a profound yet bubbling
piety. In a recent circular to employes
regarding the care of horses he gives
utterance to many humane sentiments.
If Valentine cared as much for the
welfare of patrons as for the livestock
of the concern he directs and adorns
he would be all right. He introduces
the circular with a quotation from
Proverbs: "The righteous man re
gardeth the life of his beast." So he
does, and the unrighteous, too, if he
has any sense and owns a beast, par
ticularly if said beast is entered for
a race and the stakes are worth hav
ing. Still, his advice is good. It is
almost goody-good. Then follow in
structions as to the care of property,
these also enforced by a proverb of
great antiquity and merit. The joker
is at the bottom. It is an allusion to
the dissatisfaction of customers at the
policy of the company in sticking them
for the war tax, which the law specifies
the company shall pay, and counsels
employes to be ao polite as to insure
the recovery of any business lost by
the momentary dissatisfaction growing
out of what he is pleased to term the
"stamp unpleasantness." My dear Mr.
Valentine, there is nothing momentary
about that unpleasantness. When a
man is being robbed the actual process
does not last long, but the memory
rankles, and peace of mind is not fully
restored until the purse has been. You
can circulate proverbs until the cows
come home, and it will not alter the
fact that your company, under your
specific direction, has deliberately bun
koed the people upon whom it depends
for support. In this connection I copy
from your beautiful and touching cir
cular: "There is that scattereth and
yet increaseth, and there is that which
withholdeth more than is meet, but it
tendeth to poverty."

A notorious woman named Fuhrlg
has again been accused of killing an
unfortunate of her own sex. She has
been similarly accused before, and, as
a contemporary remarks, in going back
to her practices shows a supreme con
tempt for the law. I do not see how she
could possibly entertain any other feel
ing toward the law, so far as It is sup
posed to apply to her.

Richard Harding Davis is another of
the great men whose name must be
printed in full. It is difficult to imagine
a Richard EL Davis. An R. H. Davis
would be positive sacrilege, while to
term him Dick would simply be to
break the upper literary circle into a
confused jumble of segments. All this
is to show that I hold Richard Harding
Davis in proper esteem. He inherited
greatness, and even if it is a misfit, far
be it from me to decry the value of it.
If the greatness toted by Mr. Davis
could be transposed to some one who
matched it, the combination would
make a hit. Davis wi-ites a clever short
story, a passable long one, in which the
illustrations are apt to be fine. In con
sideration of the privilege of project
ing the impressive Davis mug into
every picture illustrative of American
life, Gibson does his best while setting
forth the heroes and heroines of the
Davis imagination. The heroes are al
ways broad-shouldered and smooth
shaved, each one. in fact, a miniature
Davis, while the heroine invariably has
an aristocratic nose tipped skyward, as
if suspecting onions on her neighbor's
breath. However, these few remarks
are preliminary, and as the wise reader
has skipped them there is no occasion
for apology. Davis was over in Cuba
during the war. He is not a good, re
porter. In the recital of actual events
I know a dozen men any one of whom
can write all around him. He tries to
make word-paintings, and the result is
a daub. The impressionist style may
be all right in the subdued light of the
art gallery, but in description people
want bold and accurate lines. Davis
did not send out of Cuba one good de
scription of anything occurring there.
Nevertheless he did as well as any
body else. Creelman forwarded a few
stirring paragraphs, but Creelman is
such an unconscionable liar that these
went for nothing. From a newspaper
standpoint the action in Cuba was a
failure. There was a chance to do
much, and nothing was done. There
fore would it beseem Richard Harding
to sing small instead of attacking
Shafter. Doubtless there were errors
in the conduct of the Santiago cam
paign. If ever a campaign devoid of
mistake was carried on under the di
rection of mortal history failed to rec
ord it. If ever a man achieved bril
liant victory and missed having his
methods and motives traduced I cer
tainly never heard of It. The bald
truth remains that a victory was
achieved speedily, splendidly, with a
comparatively trifling loss of life. Vast
difficulties were overcome, and a war
which promised to drag on indefinitely
was brought to a speedy close. It is
too bad, of course, that Davis is not
satisfied. It is possible, however, that
Shafter had in view something fully as
important as pleasingthe distinguished
gentleman. Shafter is fat and choleric.
He was too busy to tip his helmet to
Davis, too engrossed to divulge his
plans, and had too much sense to coun
sel with the reporter. Thereto", c has
he been Impaled, and is even now sup
posed to be wriggling or\ the tip of the
Davis pen. I trust the gallant old war
rior will survive, and perhaps tell the
world some time what he thinks of
Davis as a correspondent, an exchange
of compliments being suggested by the
circumstances.

DUBLIN. Sept. 24.â The '98 celebra
tions steadily continue. To-morrow
the scene will be changed from the
â west to the great plain of Kildare in
honor or Hamilton Rowan, William
Aylmer and other local leaders of the
'98 movement In the province of Lein
ster. Rathcoffeyâ the spot on which
the meeting will be heldâ has been se
lected as the trysting place not only
because it was for many years the res
idence of. Hamilton Rowan, but be
cause, apart from its connection with
Rowan, it Is historically interesting to
all Nationalist Irishmen and is the cen
ter of a district in which some of the
most horrible of the British atrocities
of a hundred years ago were perpe
trated. Rathcoffey was formerly the
residence of a distinguished family
named Wogan, which furnished two
British viceroys, on the one hand, for
the persecution of the Irish whom it
had been brought from England to
chastise; but, on the other hand, it fur
nished leaders for more than one Irish
insurrection, who became known even
outside the bounds of Ireland. In 1641.
for instance, ivhen Rorey O'^oore
raised the standard of revolt in Kil
dare, Nicholas Wogan of Rathcoffey
Castle was a member of his council of
war, and on his defeat not only was
that stronghold confiscated, but the
seventy prisoners found in it were all
massacred by the English commander.
Colonel Monk. All that remains of the
old castle now is the barbican. Rath
coffey House, which took its place, was
built at the close of the last century
by Hamilton Rowan and was the scene
of many stirring incidents during the
nod.
As 1 wrote at length some time ago
about Archibald Hamilton Rowan's
connection with the United Irishman, I
need not say anything on that subject
now. But there is one incident in his
career which 1 did not mention, and
the scene of which was the district in
which the meeting to-morrow will take
I I refer to his escape from Rath
coffey House, whither a party of sol
diers were sent to effect his arrest on
a charge of treason. While the sol

managed to close the door against their

seen upon it. From the round room he
rushed into the library, and, seeing that

his hat and hid himself in a secret
chamber which escaped all notice. Not

INSCRIPTION ON THE TABLET ERECTED ON THE OUTSIDE OF

treated by Squire Browne, his host. To
morrow this incident and others will be
recalled to the minds of many thou
sands of men from Kildare and all the
adjacent counties, and the recollection
will not serve to breed loyalty to Brit
ish rule ir. the multitude.
In addition to the demonstration in
Kildare there will be a demonstration
In Dublin on the occasion of unveiling
a tablet which has been erected on the
outside of Oliver Bond's house, on
Lower Bridge street. Oliver Bond was
an eminent woolen draper of Dublin
and a kindly, though shrewd, man who,
being a Protestant of English extrac
tion, might have attained to the most
Influential, social and political po
sition If only he had taken
the side of the English tyrants
of his country- He joimd the
United Irishmen, and he was tried for
high treason on the 24th of July, 1798.
Three days before the brothers Sheares
had been sentenced to death for the
same offense and hanged; the second
day before, John McCaner had experi
enced the same terrible fate; Thomas
Byrne, the very day before, had been
tried and sentenced. The principal
witness against all was the infamous
informer, Thomas Reynolds, of Kilkea
Castle, in the county of Kildare. He
had been a silk mercer in Dublin and
joined the United Irishmen at an early
period in their career. In 1797 he was
treasurer and colonel in the insurgent
society for Kildare, and soon afterward
he became one of the trusted delegates
of the society from that county. He
dedicated himself to a career of crime
and treachery. He stole Jewels and
silks belonging to his mother and ap
propriated the proceeds to his own use.
He swindled a servant out of a pum of
Â£170. He was accused by his brother
in-law, under circumstances of the
strongest suspicion, of having poisoned
his wife's mother for the purpose of
robbing her of Â£300. He then turned
his attention to earning money from
the English Government by betraying
his fellow men. Into whose political
confidences he had wormed himself. Ho
had been benefited by Lord Edward
Flfzgerald, and he sold him. He not
only took all the United Irish oaths
but then swore that he was "loyal,"
and sought to get one Felix Rourke
hanged for his own treason. His latest
act of infamy was to give evidence
against his fellow merchant, Oliver
Bond.
The trial of Bond was, however, fa
mous for more than the appearance of
Reynolds, the Informer, In th*Â» witness
box. It waÂ« famous, also, for the mag
nificent and courageous speech of the
great lawyer and orator, John Phil pot
<~"urran. for the defense. The court
was crowded with armed military and
yeomen who, drunk with power and
liquor, frequently interrupted Currar.
with their shouts and threats, and the
clashing of their swords and carbines.
In spite of such demonstration, which
called forth but the pretense of an ef
fort from the Judges to put them
down, Ourran persevered and held up
Reynolds to the scorn of mankind
while vindicating the patriotism of his
client. But the jury had been duly
"packed," and Bond's sentence to death
may be said to have been pronounced
the moment after he had been ar
raigned. He wae not, however, hanged.
It was said at the time that he died
in prison of apoplexy, but tlvre is much
evidence to show that he was murdered.
The memorial now erected to him con
sist? of a tablet, telling in the Irish
language and In the English of his ar
reÃt in the house on Bridge street. It
may be added here that on the morn
ing after Bond's death (the insurrec
tion being suppressed), negotiations
were opened between the United Irish
men th<>n in custody and the Govern
ment for a treaty, the terms of which
were that the prisoners would tell the
real state of affairs on the insurgent
side without implicating Indvduals
and that the Government on their side
should take no more lives. England,
as usual, broke the compact. One man
was hanged, and â what the patriots
thought worse of â the indemnity act
which was passed described the United
Irish leaders as confessing guilt and
craving pardon, neither of which they
did; and, finally, instead of being al
lowed to go at once abroad, the pris
oners were kept in jail for a year in
Dublin and then thrust into Fort
George, from which they were not re
leased till the peace of Amiens in 1802.
All this is another story, the telling:
of which to-morrow will not, it may
easily be imagined, tend to make loyal
citizens of the people of Dublin.
But thY; commemoration of the men
of "98 and of their sacrifice? is not the
only thing of the kind which is now
engaging the attention of Irish Nation
alists. The ParneU anniversary is ap
proaching, and, as usual, the most ex
tensive preparations are being made
for it by the political followers of the
late Irish leader. Parnell died on the
6th of October, 1801. and that day has
now come to be known as Ivy day. from
the fact that the Ivy leaf has come to
be worn on the anniversary of that day
in honor of Parnell, as the primrose is
worn in England on the Beaconsfleld
or Disraelinn anniversary. But the
public demonstration in honor of Par
nell does not take place then, but al
ways on the following Sunday, when
special trains are run from all parts of
the country for the purpose of bring
ing Parnelfites to Dublin, there to join
in the annual pilgrimage to Parnell's
grave in Glasnevin Cemetery. Hitherto
every successive year from IK9I has
witnessed that annual Pilgrimage, and
generally speaking it has been a won
derful sight. This year it promises to
be an equally remarkable spectacle. All
the usual preparations are being made
for it, and from the indications to hand

GHOST OF MARINES
JAIL IDENTIFIED
Peter Nelson Encounters
the Wraith.
STRANGE MIDNIGHT VISITOR
UNIQUE ATTEMPT TO EXTORT
A CONFESSION.
The Brooks Murder Suspect Declares
His Caller Weighed 200 Pounds
and Resembled Sheriff
Harrison.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. B.â The Court
house ghost â the mocking, gibbering,
chain-clanking ghost that has Infested
a cell in the County Jail and struck
terror to the hearts of Weary Willies
and Tramping Trilbies for four long
yearsâ has at last materialized in the
flesh.
Peter Nelson, the former deckhand
on the yacht Chlspa, who was arrested
on suspicion of having murdered Cap
tain J. Moss Brooks, is the one who
made the discovery. According to Nel
son, the ghost weighs nearly 200 pounds
and has a voice so nearly resembling
that of genial Sheriff Harrison that, to
the deckhand's mind at least, the
ghost and the official sustain to each
other the relation of a Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde.
Yet who will believe for an instant
that the renowed slate* for Sheriff 01
the late Democratic convention could
have been the midnight visitant who
made the local Jail famous as possess
ing a "ghost cell"; who frightened a
Chinese so badly that he commuted
suicide by hanging himself in the cell
with a strip of .blanket; who drove an
Indian from Marshalls, insane; who
forced a man, against whom there was
hardly any evidence, into a confession
of murder, and who has caused tramps
to go down on their knees and beg to
ue released as if their lives were at
stake?
Nelson was placed in this same
"ghost cell," and he asserts that the ef
fort to frighten him into a confession
not only was a dismal failure,, but that
he is satisiled in his own mind as to
the identity of the visitant whose pe
culiar method of extorting a confes
sion would have done credit to Chief
.Lees himself.
"You see," said Nelson, who was re
leased from prison yt-sterday, "the first
thing they tried on me was to take me
at night up to Coroner Eden's and into
the room where Captain Brooks' re
mains lay. They had a light thrown
on the face that gave it an awful
ghastly tint. I was carefully watched
to see if I would make any sign, and
then Sheriff Harrison said In sepulchral
tones:
" 'Nelson, this man's clay calls for
vengeance. Can you say you are not
the murderer in this awful presence?'
"And then District Attorney Marti
nelli chipped in with:
" 'Yes, purge your soul of Its black
stain by telling the story of your ter
rible crime.'
"I said I guessed I would stick to
my original story, and they took me
back to the 'ghost cell.' About mid
night I hoard stealthy steps climbing
up on the cell from the rear. In a mo
ment there was a fearful groan and
Iron chains were clanked on the steel
roof of the cell. You bet I was scared
at first, but I concluded a ghost's isteps
weren't taken according to Hoyle when
they could be heard. So I waited and
at the next groan I was sure I had
my man. I walked to the door where
my voice could be heard and shouted:
" 'Sheriff, come down off there. You
can't work that old ghost chestnut on
me.'
"There was silence and then another
groan, but I distinctly heard the ghost
crawl down and he never had the nerve
to brace me again."
So much for what may itself be only
a fairy tale.
With the release of Nelson poos the
last hope of finding the murderer of
Captain Brooks. The authorities hay*
literally accomplished nothing. For
some time District Attorney Martlnelll
has been too busy doing politics with
Trustee Sylva of Sausalito to find time
for such a small matter as seeking a
murderer, and Elk and Burke, the
other men suspected by the authorities,
have furnished a complete alibi.
Elk has proved by a friend named
Harry Killion that he was at the OrÂ»
ph'Mim Thpater in San Francisco on the
nijtht of the murder and did not go
h<Â«me until nearly midnight. Burks
was at the Model Hotel on Mission
street, between Third and Fourth.
Mrs. Elk proves by Mrs. Killion that
Burke wrote the letter to Captain
Gutte, asking for her husband a posi
tion as captain of the yacht, and that
there was nothing strange in his know-
Ing it at 8 o'clock in the morning. Mate
Johnson or the ferry-boat San Rafael
met Burke at the wharf in San Fran
cisco on the morning: of the murdar and
told him. Burke then went to Mrs.
Elk's house and wrote the letter.
DR. SAMUEL FARRAR
STRICKEN BY APOPLEXY
Expires Suddenly While Training a
Horse at His Montecito
Home.
SANTA BARBARA. Oct. B.â Dr. Samuel
Farrur died late yesterday afternoon of
apoplexy, while training a favorite horse.
His death was sudden and came as a
great shock to his friends, for the doctor
was apparently In the best of health.
Dr. Farrar came to this city about a
year ago and built a beautiful home in
Montecito Valley, two miles distant. He
was an active citizen and a prominent
club man, having been a member of both
(Vf> Santa Barbara Club and the Country
Club. His loss will be seriously felt by
the city. His home before coming to
Santa Barbara was in Quincy, Mass.,
where he accumulated a large fortune at
his profession. He was well known
through the New England Â£ts.ies as a.
sportsman and athlete. Since his arrival
here he has spent much of his time with
his fine stable of horses and has trained
several animals himself.
Dr. Farrar leaves a large fortune to a
sister In Boston. He was forty-four years
old.

Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Oct. B.â The
Chinese population of Kootenai is in a
state of deep agitation over the kidnap
ing of a Chinese girl, the chattel of an
Oriental merchant named Lun Foo,
who purchased her several days ago
from Wah Chung for $1000. Lun Foo's
newly acquired property was a pretty
little maiden, soft-eyed and white
skinned. Lun locked his prize in his
house yesterday and w r ent uptown on
business which kept him until late in
the afternoon. When he returned she
was gone.
There was wild jabbering and China
men gathered from all quarters. Luh
set about investigating and found that
three Chinese, new to the city, had ob
tained entrance to his house, dressed
his pretty slave in a boy's suit of navy
blue and taken tickets for San Fran
cisco or Seattle. The wires were kept
hot with messages to officials along the
line to detain three Chinese and the
Chinese girl dressed in English clothes
and looking like a Japanese boy. Lun
went further. He offered $200 for the
return of his valuable chattel.
At Wong Kong's store in the Chinese
quarter the statement was made that
the girl had been taken to San Francis
co for immoral purposes. The police of
that city will, it la understood, be com
municated with at once.
The social purity societies in the
province are shocked by the fact that
Chinese girls are still being sold like
cattle and will have the matter Investi
gated.
BUSINESS PLACES BURNED.

ATLANTIC CITY, Oct. B.â The most

of ex-Minister Sewall. who reported to
Admiral Dewey that the Monadnock had

would reach Manila on August 13, that

time the vessel should /each its destina
tion. The ship did not enter Manila Bay
until August 16.
It was hinted that the reason for thÂ»
delay at Honolulu was that Captain
Whiting's family lived at Honolulu and
that he tarried with them, regardless of
his duties elsewhere. Whiting: married
Miss Afong, the daughter of a wealthy
Chinese merchant in Hawaii, who return
ed to his Asiatic home after settling a
large fortune upon his brilliant and beau
tiful daughter.
The court of inquiry has made a report
which Admiral Dewey forwards to Wash
ington with his approval. It is round that
the delay at Honolulu was not longer
than was absolutely necessary, and that
no wrongful action attached to Captain
Whiting in his command of the ship. The
department will probably approve the
finding.

Wins the Pace at Los
Angeles.
BETTORS ROUGHLY HANDLED
OVERWEIGHTED WITH JOE
WHEELER TICTKETS.
Marplot Has a Walkover for the
Derby and La Goleta Takes
the Santa Mortice
Scramble.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES, Oct. The crowd at
the track this afternoon was the largest
of the meeting, fully 2500 people being in
attendance. The sport dragged along
vearily, and the last event on the card
had to be postponed. The special trot for
named horses proved a gift for Iran Alto,
hut the free-for-all pace was a spirited
contest. It was captured by Little Thorn,
against which the books laid 50 to 1 for
his first winning heat. The gilding was
not backed, however, to any great extent,
and the ring escaped luckily. Marplot en
joyed a walkover for the Los Angeles
Derby, appearing with Piggott In the sad
dle. In the other two running events
both the Baldwin statle's pair, Los Mo
denos and Rev del Rio, coupled in the
betting, and Rubicon, a . to 2 choice, were
bowled over.
For the first heat of the special trot
Our Lucky was backed to favoritism, but
a break In the stretch cost him the heat.
Iran Aito, driver, by Charles Bunch, won
us he pleased, as well as the following
two heats. Our Lucky was lame, and in
the second heat got the distance flag. It
was a very tame affair.
Much Better received the nomination for
the first heat of the free- for-ail pace,
and, scoring for the word a 2 to 5 favorite,
was in front of her field the entire way.
winning- handily in 2:104. Joe Wheeler
was a very shifty third. The cut was
then shifted and the latter horse was
pounded down from 2 to 1 to 7 to 10 to
take the next heat. Much Better broke at
the turn and Wheeler had It all his own
way, strolling: In leisurely five lengths in
advance of Bc-c-hwood in 2:I4 1 ;. The first
heat winner was !ast, and never cut much
of a figure thereafter. The wise ones then
loaded up with tickets on Joe Wheeler
to win the race, and to-r.ight they are all
overweight. The Fresno ~horsÂ» did take
two heitts and then his onward career
was checked. Little Thorn, the Stockton
gelding handled by J. Thompson, winning
the next three heats and the race.
The four and a half furlong scramble
for two-year-old maidens was an enjoy
able affair for the bookiea. The Baldwin
pair, Los Modenos and Rey del Bio, had
a strong following, being played down
from 8 to 5 to 4 to 5. Carmenita, piloted
by Builman, made all the running and at
the wire won with something in reserve
from Los Modenos.
Three fast lea lined up at the barrier
for the Santa Monica scramble at five
furlongs. Rubicon had a host of friends
and went to the post a 1 to 2 chance
The big chestnut horse ran a smashing
good race, but at the end was beaten a half
length by La. Goleta. the Baldwin filly
covering the distance in 1:00 flat. The
winner was ridden by little Devin the
most promising boy in this section. Amasa
appeared outclassed. Summary:

Escape With Their Lives and Return

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CaJl.
VANCOUVER, Oct. B.â A. C. Peck, a
tall, powerful-looking Californlan, -who
halls from Los Angeles, has arrived in
this city, after having spent seven
months on the Ashcroft trail and in the
Peace River country vainly searching
far the precious, yellow metal. Mr.
Peck, with three partnersâ F. W.
Troop, J. J. Shields and M. A Long.
ail of Los Angelesâ bought supplies in
Vancouver last March for a long stay
in the northern gold fields. They took
their supplies to Ashcroft by train and
started from the latter place on
March 27.
Mr. Peck informed a Call representa
tive that his experience over the prac
tically unknown route had been awful.
The party encountered bugs and mo
rasses every few miles on the trail, in
which their horses sank up to their
necks and were lost. Some of the pack
animals strayed Into the dense forests
of that district and were never seen
again.
The party had prepared for a long
sojourn In the north and carried heavy
outfits. After losing most of their ani
mals and putting to death some which
were starving, they hired Indian guides
and started out in small boats from
Quesntlle, proceedings by Summit Lake
and Crooked River to Fort MacLeod.
They then, after many hardships and
hair-breadth escapes, succeeded in
reaching Findlay and Peace rivers, and
finally Fort Graham, a Hudson Bay
port. At this point they rested. Long
having given up and the other members
of the party being completely discour
aged. The country for miles around
was prospected by them, but no gold
was found.
Some of the members being then
broken in health and pocket, and sick
ened at the sight of so much distress on
the trail, decided to return, Mr. Peck
being among the number.
Speaking of his trip, Mr. Peck said
emphatically that the two Canadian
routes to the Klondike â the Ashcroft
and Edmonton trailsâ were simply
death traps, and he wonders now that
they escaped with their lives. Their
escape may have been due to the fact
that their Indian guides took them by
a new route around a part of the trail
where many men are now said to be
stranded and starving. In regard to
the much-talked-of Edmonton route,
Mr. Peck said:
"It was terrible, from what I could

Sanden Electric Belt " I am an engineer on the Southern Pacific Railroad, and have been suffering greatly for the last
O three or four years with lumbago, dizziness, faint and blind spells and a general brokendown feeling, which made it al- O
O most impossible for me to make my run, which is one of the longest on the road. I was advised to try one of your q
Belts and did so. It has completely cured me of all my troubles after two months use, and I can now make my run n
O with 'the greatest ease. I have never had a pain or a bad feeling after five days' use of the Belt, and I have more life V
O in me now than I have had for years. On meeting my friends they always congratulate me on looking so well. I al- U

hear. I met one manâ named Kegwin,
of Fresno, Cal.â who, with a party of
twenty men and fifty pack horse?,
started out over it a year ago last Ju;y,
and it took them a year's hard travel
ing to reach Fort Graham. They must
have experienced a terrible time. Start
ing out in the summer they, of course,
took pack horses. Then winter over
took them and they saw their poor ani
mals die off one by one through starva
tion and cold. The party could get no
fodder, and the stories about good pas
ture lands proved myths. Kegwin told
me that when he reached Fort Graham
he had only one horse left out of fifty.
The expenses of the party must have
been enormous. They winter at Fort
Graham and early the next spring will
strike west to prospect P-^lly, Black
and Liard Rivers, where they think
they will find gold enough to pay them
for their terrible trip. Their great
complaint about the Edmonton route is
the great distance and the innumerable
small lakes and streams that have to
be crossed. Kegwin cursed the route
as a fraud and a delusion.
Mr. Peck ar.d his party lost nearly
everything in addition to experiencing
the many horrors of the trail. They
started fur Los Angeles to-night. Many
Americans, including two large Cali
fornian parties whose names they can
not recollect, are. they say, stalled on
the Edmonton trail and will have to
get help before winter sets in or die
like dogs, as they have lost most of
their outfits.
ARRIVES WITH BAWSOjSTITES.
Steam Schooner Rival Brings Miners
and Their Gold.
SEATTLE, Oct. 8. â The steam
schooner Rival arrived this afternoon
from St. Michael, Alaska, with 125 pas
sengers, of whom about fifty were from
DawÃon City. Nearly all had small
amounts of gold dust, ranging from a
few hundred to a few thousand dollars.
F. J. Teeter, who will tell no one
whence he came beyond the fact that
he was away up in the Arctic, is sup
posed to have a lot of gold. Accord
ing to Stewart Brown, he spent a gTeat
deal coming down on the boat.
Thomas Barker, who is accompanied
by his wife and two children, is the
owner of some claims near Circle City.
He is credited with $10,000.
John G. Green, who has been In
Alaska since 1881, is the owner of a sil
ver mine nt-ar Golovin Bay. Mr. Green
does not have a very favorable opin
ion of the recent goid discoveries on
Golovin Bay.
One of the most interesting passen
gers on the Rival was Frank J. Dun
levy, who has visited all the big min
ing camps of the world. Dunlevy wa3
the organizer of the Miners' Associa
tion, formed for the purpose of secur
ing what they considered needed re
forms in the administration of the Yu
kon. Dunlevy pays that he will visit
all the principal cities in Canada, with
the purpose of arousing the electors to
the necessity of a Parliamentary in
vestigation. "When shown the dis
patch from Ottawa stating that Gold
Commissioner Fawrett had been re
moved. Mr. Dunlevy said:
"That will be welcome news to the
miners, who. although they do not im
pugn Fawcett's honesty, regard him as
inefficient and lacking in executive ca
pacity."
Continuing, he fbM: "The removal
of Fawcett, however, will not satisfy
the miners. If certain abuses in the
way of granting concessions to indi
viduals are not corrected I predict that
not to exceed J1.000.w0 in gold will b*
taken out of the country next year."

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. B.âRe
ports to-night from Cuban leaders state
that many cases of outlawry have oc
curred in Camagruey district. Owing
to lack of food among the Cuban sol
diers the commanders cannot restrain
the soldiers, who are leaving the ranks
for the hills in great numbers. Band 3
of brigands infest the district, robbing
and destroying plantations. The situ

stating that famine exists there and
that many are dying from : f^â¢" o^
He sends an urgent appeal for food and
clothing. Colonel Garcia will ha\e a
conference with General Wood to-mor
row and see if it is possible that re
lief can be sent. Even if it is decided
to allow supplies, the greatest difficulty
will be in the transportation, as the
rainy season has now set in In the
province, rendering the roads impass
able. Although he has been Promised
the position of Chief or Police in the
semi-military police force contemplated
in the province, Colonel Garcia is un
decided whether or not to accept, ow

the province. . .
General Wood this afternoon ordered
the lighter Los Angeles, which took a
battalion of the Third Immures to
Manzanillo on Thursday, to return im
mediately and take 100,000 rations to
Guantanamo to relieve the distress
General Wood proposes to institute
immediately a system of ration distri
bution by which destitute Cubans in
the eastern part of the island can be
reached. He will send the rations reg
ularly to Baracoa, Sagua de Tanamo,
Guantanamo. and, later, to Manzanillo
by boats. He will have food sent to
the interior by pack trains.
The suffering of poor people is acute
and it is General Wood's purpose to re
lieve the distress as far as possible.
The food will go to the women and
children and pacificos only. No armed
Cubans will get anything. Ten thou
sand rations will be sent to Cobre to
morrow in charge of Lieutenant Regri
of the Third Immunes.

SAX RAFAEL, Oct. B.â The Demo
cratic County Convention held in the
Fupf-rior Court room of the Courthouse
to-day was an example of what can be
accomplished by practical politicians In
the way of preparing a slate. There
were only two Instances in which the
semblance of a contest took place â in
the nominations for Coroner and Pub
lic Administrator and Auditor and Re
corderâand then the daring interlopers
were well punished for their temerity in
trying to interfere with the ambitious
plans of the local Board of Political
Strategy.
The convention was called to order
by J. H. Wilklna, and James W. Coch
rane was placed In the chair. S. Her
tog, George D. Shearer and James

Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
SALINAS, Oct. B.â Such an outburst
of enthusiasm, genuine and sponta
neous, as greeted the Republican cam
paign orators to-night, had never be
fore been witnessed in Monterey
County. General W. H. Barnes on his
arrival was met and welcomed at the
depot by a large crowd and escorted to
a hotel, where a reception for over an
hour was held to permit citizens to
grasp his hand. Over three hundred
visitors came from Monterey, and a
procession of 500 men, with banners,
torches and fireworks, escorted the
Bpeaker to the pavilion. The streets
were illuminated with red fire, while
cannon boomed. At the pavilion the
crowd was so dense that the street out
side was packed.
There were over ISOO present. Two
bands discour: rl Âiusic for the assem
blage. A telegram from the State Com
mittee chairman was read, mentioning
the sacrifice General Barnes has made,
as his son was about to leave for Ma
nila.
In opening. General Barnes dealt with
the platforms and principles of the par
ties. It.- spoke of the glories achieved
under the Republican banner, the
greatest of which was the obliteration
a few months ago of all sectional feel
ings, as was evidenced by the sons of
Confederate sires marching under
Old Glory and singing Union hymns.
Referring to present platforms, he said
the Republicans had one, the others
none.
As to Gage, he was known as being
honest all through; the people irrespec
tive of party in Los Angeles spoke thus
of him. The general, Bpeaking of
Gage's opponent. Baid:
"I don't like to talk about Judge Ma
guire, but he talks so much about me.
I'm Maguir*' 1 .-: nightmare. He does not
gv to bed without talking and praying
that he be delivered from Barnes. When
he dreams he sees me sitting on his
bosom like a hideous joss and beating
out his brains. He Is unjust. He says
I'm a railroad man â a human locomo
tive that shrieks and whistles when the
railway company pulls the throttle.
Magulre, when he says this, says what
Is untrue. He knows that before either
of us had anything to do with the rail
road I was, as 1 am now, a Republican
lawyer. He knows that the Southern
Pacific nor any o-ther corporation hu^i
ever owned one hair on the top of my
head."
General Barnes then paid Magulre an
excellent compliment, speaking of him
asÂ» a Judge, saying, however, that since
Maguire left the bench he had as many
fads as a lunatic In the Stockton Asy
lum.
"Maguire," said the speaker, "does
not like Gage nor his style. He says
Gage keeps his hands In his pockets.
That is true. We can't say the same
of Maguire, who has had his hands in
the treasury for over twenty years."
< '"Titinuing, General Barnes spoke In
favor of the Nlcaraguan canal, the an
nexation of Hawaii and the holding of
every inch of ground fought for and
gained by our brave soldier and Bailor
boys in the war with Spain. He denied
that Gage was now or ever had been in
any manner, directly or indirectly, con
nected with the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company. He urged all voters to
stand by the party and vote to sustain
the administration by electing only
good and true Republicans.
General Barnes spoke for two hours
and held the immense crowd's close at
tention, despite the fact that when at
about the middle of his speech an alarm
of fire was sent in from an outside box
by some miscreant, supposedly with the
purpose of creating a panic and con
fusic-n in the pavilion. A few calm
words by the general and others stilled
the commotion and the meeting pro
ceeded quietly.
People still throng the streets, cheer-
Ing for Gage, Neff and the Republican
ticket from top to bottom.
ENTERS THE CAMPAIGN.
Stanford Wants the Tax on Its Prop-
erty Abolished.
STANFORD, Oct. B.â ln San Frnnclsco
the Alumni Association of Stanford Uni
versity has been agitating the <|ueHtion
of taxation of Stanford University prop
erty for some time, until now the work
lias centered in the students and faculty
of this place. The three factors are
thoroughly aroused. A mass-meeting has
been called for Thursday night, and in
dications are for an energi-tlc campaign
throughout the coming political light.
Dr. Jordan, in speaking of the matter
this afternoon, said: "This is the only
State in the civilized world that requires
such a thing, and it ought to be aban
doned. Emerson says: 'A dollar in a
university is worth more than a dollar
in a jail,' and we believe this should be
considered at all events. At present we
are fighting for Stanford, although I be
lieve all such institutions should be
freed."
Republican Rally at Eureka.
EUREKA, Oct. B.â The first Republican

GAGE'S NAME FIRST
ON THE BIG BALLOT
How the Several Nominees Have
Fared in the Make-Up of
the Official Ticket.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. B.â The official draft of the State ticket to be voted
at the November election was completed this afternoon by Secretary
of State Brown. The names of the candidates are arranged alpha
betically, and this places Gage first on the ticket. Maguire's name is
third.
This morning an effort was made to have the arrangement of Ma
guire's name changed, so that his party designations would begin with
"Democratic." E. M. "Wardall, chairman of the Populist State Central
Committee, contended that party designations should proceed in the order
in which the nominations were filed with the Secretary of State. He as
serted that the filing of Maguire's People's party nomination had been pur
posely held back, so that the Democrats would get in first.
Secretary of State Brown replied that he placed the designations on the
ticket in the order in which the nominations were received, without regard
to the time of filing. He said that Maguire having been nominated first
by the Populists and later by the Democrats designations were so given.
The names of candidates, with numbers, party designations, etc., will
appear on the official ballots exactly as follows:

1. Henry T. Gage of Los Angeles, Republican, United Labor Party.

PROUD RECORD OF
THE ADMINISTRATION
Senator Perkins at Marysville Re
views the Good That Has Been
Accomplished.
MARYSVTL.I.E, Oct. B.â The Republi
cans of Yuba and Slitter counties Joined
to-night in extending to United States
Senator Perkins a rousing ovation. The
seating capacity of the Marysville Thea
ter where the meeting was held, was se
verely taxed. Many persons were com
pelled to stand in the aisles. The assem
blage was called to order by Wallaca
Dlnsmore, chairman of the County Cen
tral Committee, who introduced Gavin
W Hutchins as president of the meeting.
Mr Hutchins named the following vice
Presidents- J F. Barrie. J. H. Jewett. D.

Senator Perkins opened with a refer
ence to the days when Marysville was
his home, and the kindly fee ing he has
ever held for the place and its citizens.
The Republican party, he held, had no
promises to make, and Republicans could
point with pride to the record of th^ new
administration which took charge on y
eeventecn months ago. The Dingley bill,
though handicapped by the war. had done
an that was expected of it Exportation?,
for the year endtnsr June 30, IS9B, exceeded
those oPthe previous year by $180 000,
while the importations in the same time
were $l-"i 000 less. Since January 1 of the
nYesent year to June 30 $100,000 000 worth
of ' gold was imported, putting more
money into circulation than would all
the mints if open to the free coinage of
silver for three years. The wool interests
of the State were greatly benefited under
the bill. Thirty-three million pounds pro
cured last year meant an advance to Cal
ifornia alone of $2,000,000. Cattle and sheep
were worth 50 per cent more since the re
turn of prosperity. The present Congress
had done more for the laboring class than
had any previous Congress in twenty
years The speaker cited the adoption of
the Non-Partisan Labor Commission bill,
the railroad arbitration and the eight
hour bill. Â _ __
Senator Perkins was followed by W. M.
Cutter, nominee for State Senator, and
C G. Raub, nominee for the Assembly.
Music interspersed the speeches, and the
meeting adjourned with three cheers for
Gage Neff and the Republican party.

It Is popularly held that what the

is to the human system â the center of
life and energy. And so, coined in our
common speech, are a multitude of
sayings, which recognize in the heart
the center of mental, moral and physi-
cal life. Thus we speak of the "de-
sire of the heart," of heartache and
heartbreak. We say of a man he is a
hearty man and that he is a hearty
eater, so associating both cordiality
and appetite with the heart.

when the heart gives an uncom-
mon pulsation, or when it beats
too quickly, or seems to miss
an occasional beat, nothing will do but
an Immediate examination.
Yet physicians affirm that organic
disease of the heart is rare. Perhaps
only once in a hundred times where
there is derangement of the heart is it
found to be due to a disease of the or-
gan itself. In the other ninety-nine
cases it is functional. Functional dis-
ease of the heart means that the func-
tions of the heart are interfered with
by an abnormal or diseased condition
of some other organ, and this organ is
generally the stomach.
Through the sympathetic and pneu-
mogastric system of nerves, which are
distributed to the heart and stomach in
common, the heart at once sympathizes
with any disturbance of the stomach.
The great organs of the body are de-
signed to occupy a certain space in the
cavity of the trunk in which they are
so nicely arranged.
When the stomach is overdistended
by eating, or when Indigestion causes
the gas from the fermentation of half
digested food to innate that organ, the
stomach extends outside its allotted
bound, the heart is encroached upon
and crowded, and then follow short-
ness of breath and irregular, palpitat-
ing action of the heart.
Now in ninety-nine cases out of one
hundred, supposed heart disease Is
functional and curable, and in every
such case no other medicine will so
quickly effect a cure as Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery. It is an
axiom that diseases which originate in
the stomach must be cured through the
stomach. It is in line with this axiom
that the "Golden Medical Discovery"
works its logical and legitimate cures.
By strengthening the stomach, by pro-
moting the flow of the digestive Juices
the digestion is improved, the stomach
restored to its normal condition of
health, and the functional disturbance
of the heart thereby corrected. Thou-
sands of people who believed they had
heart disease have been radically cured
by the "Golden Medical Discovery." It
cures indigestion or dyspepsia, weak-
ness of the stomach and all affections
of the nutritive system, except cancer
of the stomach.
Among the commonest symptoms of
these derangements and weaknesses of
the digestive and nutritive system are
frequent attacks of bilious or sick
headache, bitter taste in the mouth,
tongue coated white or covered with a
brown fur, "backache" and tired feel-
ings, lassitude and a sense of debility.
There is generally depression of spirits
and a decided tendency to be discour-
aged, and despondent; there Is loss or
irregularity of appetite, uneasiness or
undue fullness In region of the stomach
after eating; sometimes sour Btomach,
"heartburn," nausea and "water-
brash," flatulency and acrid or sour
eructations or "risings" soon after eat-
ing; the bowels become Irregular, us-
ually constipated, and occasionally
subject to diarrhea, attended with
colicky pains. Not often Is there any
pain experienced In the region of the
liver, but it is sometimes accompanied
with "sideache." The foregoing symp-
toms are not all likely to be present
in any one case, nor are any two cases
alike in every respect.
"1 never took any medicine that did
me so much good as Dr. Pierces,"
writes Mrs. Sophronia McCrea of Cas-
tleton, Hartford Co., Md. "When I
wrote to you I was Buffering from such
a pain between my shoulders I could
not draw a long breath at times, and
DR. PIERCES REMEDIES
had a soreness across my shoulders and
breast upon rising in the morning. I
suffered off and on for eight years, try-
ing different physicians and asking
different doctors what caused this, but
with no satisfactory results. I took
medicine, and at last I said I would
not take any more. I couldn't even do
light work with any ease, nor do much
of anything that caused me to bend
over; couldn't sleep at night, had terri-
ble headaches and numbness in my
arms and hands. I was taken with a
pain around my heart while eating din-
ner one day, but thought it would pass
away. It did not, however, so I felt
compelled to rail in the doctor. He
said, 'Why, you have no heart trouble.'
I said it must be â I could not lie down
my heart beat so (as I called it)
through my head. He left me medicine,
and it lulled the pain for about three
weeks. The pain annoyed me at times
for twenty-one nights; I had not slept
nor did I want much to eat. All I
seemed to want was rest. Some said I
knew how I had suffered."
Such results as these are not obtained
by stimulation. There Is no alcohol in
"Golden Medical Discovery." and It
contains no whisky or other stimulant.
The secret of its healing power lies in
its prompt and powerful action on the
stomach, the organs of digestion and
nutrition and the blood-making glands.
Another specimen case is that which
follows where years of suffering could
have been saved by a timely use of the
"Discovery."
"Six years ago my stomach and heart
troubled me so much I had to do
something, as the doctors could not
help me," writes Mrs. S. A. Knapp of
San Jose, California (Box 392). "I went
I to San Francisco and had treatment
and was better for some time, then it
came back. I then used Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery and 'Pleas-
ant Pellets.' These medicines cured my
stomach. I do not have the pain and
indigestion as I did. It is very hard
for me to tell you what I suffered be-
fore I commenced taking your valu-
able medicine. I recommend it to all
the sufferers whom I meet."
Although sweet to the taste "Golden
Medical Discovery" contains no sugar
or syrup, and does not favor fermenta-
tion, but tends to check it. Its sooth-
Ing effects are promptly felt and ac-
knowledged by the irritated organs,
good rich, red blood is produced, the
nerves are nourished and become quiet,
the body puts on muscular flesh, lurk-
ing poisons are cast out of the circula-
tion and the entire system is estab-
lished on a plane of sound health.

Self-interest prompts the dealer
sometimes to offer a substitute as "Just
as good" as Dr. Pierces Golden Medi-
cal Discovery- If it is only "just as
good" there's no object In taking an
untried medicine In place of one with a
record of countless cures. There is
nothing made by an even trade and no
boot. The medicine should be better
than "Golden Medical Discovery" to in-
duce you to purchase it. The record
shows that there Is no better, medicine
for all diseases of the stomach and
nutritive system, or which have their
origin in faulty digestion or mal-as-
similation than the "Discovery." So If
the dealer offers "something better"
you can be sure he means better for
himself and not for you, because it
pays a better profit. Nu;

WILL ARREST
FOUR MEN FOR
CONSPIRACY
Grand Jury Is Now
Fighting Mad.
AFTER THE SCHOOL BOARD
SAYS THE THEFT OF LUMBER IS
PROVED.
Unable to Indict Burns and Others,
but Will Prosecute Them
in the Polica
Court.
Sensation follows sensation in connec
tion with the lumber frauds charged
against the School Board. The Grand
Jury, having found itself powerless to
indict several persons whom It believes
to be guilty of gross frauds, as was
foreshadowed in The Call two days ago,
has stripped to the waist, so to speak,
and casting aside all regard for prece
dents, will enter the arena of the Police
Court In an attempt to punish the guilty
parties.
The Grand Jury is mad all the way
through, and while it is about thÂ« job
proposes to make a clean sweep, arrest
Ing four culprits instead of two, as was
the original Intention. With a grim de
termination, like that which was char
acteristic of the old '49ers, when they
wanted justice administered," the pres
ent jury will not stop on the order of
Its doing, but will go and do. Although
unable through legal technicality up to
this time to indict the culprits connected
with the ferry depot steals, it has by no
means abandoned its efforts, and there
Is a strong probability that something
new will develop in that direction very
soon. Having found evidence sufficient
to catch other culprits in the School
Board swindle, it has undertaken to
swiftly do them up through the Police
Court, and will then turn its attention
to the Board of Supervisors, concerning
whose alleged misdoings the jury has
had information of late. It will con
sider a damaging report concerning them
from a special investigating committee
within the next few days. Another com
mittee has the registration frauds in
hand, and will probably report in favor
of two indictments. Before the Grand
Jury closes its efforts next January a
number of guilty officials and contract
ors are expected to be in the toils.
Rumors were abroad Friday that the
Grand Jury would report two indictments
in connection with the School Board lum
ber frauds, but these were mislead
ing. Assistant Prosecutor Dunne had
made a convincing statement to the jury ,
that while the evidence was sufficient in j
two of the cases to prove guilt, it was ;
all of a nature showing misdemeanors j
and not felonies under the law, and !
therefore only the Police Court had ju- I
risdictlon.
The jury therefore proceeded Saturday S
morning to Presiding Judge Belcher's |
court for further information. There a
remarkable scene took place. Foreman .
Hecht addressed the Judge as follows:
"I would like to know if it is proper"
to submit to this court and to make a
part of its records the minutes of the :
last meeting of the Grand Jury?"
"No, it Its not," replied Judge Belcher,
"although the jury is really a constitu
ent part of the court."
"Well, then, I would like to give you
an oral report," returned the foreman.
"This Grand Jury has been investigating
the lumber scandal in the School Depart
ment, and has found the subject a most
fruitful one. Evidence so direct and de
cisive has been secured that the Grand '
Jurors are unanimous in their opinion as
to the guilt of Contractor Swift and
School Board member Burns. There is
no manner of â  doubt about the matter.
Before we reached a conclusion the most
exhaustive testimony was taken. We
found that these two men deserved to be
indicted. In one case there was a clearly
proven conspiracy to defraud the city j
and in another a felony was committed. ;
The District Attorney, however, has pro- j
pounded the law to us and has shown, â 
that in order to draw proper indictments !
it will be necessary to name dates and
places. This we could not do with the
evidence in hand. To get such we will
probably have to go all over the matter
again. We have further been informed
that a conspiracy cannot be recognized
by the Grand Jury. One of the guilty men
was a conspirator. We cannot recognize
the guilt of the other officially because it
was a misdemeanor. Judge, we were be
tween the devil and the deep blue sea,
and almost reached the conclusion that
these guilty men would have to go free.
so far as this jury was concerned. - In
view of this condition of affairs and the
obvious inadequacy of the law, 1 would
like to report upon the uselessness of the
present Grand Jury system. It is a howl
ing farce. The evidence was so simple
and straight in these cases that no court
in the land could have failed to bring in
a conviction in either one, yet we are
powerless to act. I would respectfully
suggest that the Grand Jury be abol
ished." N
When the Judge had finally recovered
the breath that had temporarily forsaken
him during this onslaught, he replied:
"The Police Court only has jurisdiction
In misdemeanor cases, as the prosecutor
has stated, and you cannot indict for con
spiracy. However, as you say you are
sure of the guilt of the parties mentioned,
I would declare that it is your duty, hav
ing the evidence in hand, to Instruct. the
chairman of your School Board committee
to at once swear out warrants in the
Police Court and push these cases to a
conclusion. If you can possibly find a
felony indictment in one of the cases it
is your duty to continue labors to that
end. I agree with you that the Grand
Jury .is an out-of-date institution and
ought to be abolished."
At this Interesting Juncture -Prosecutor
addressed the court, saving that*
a way had occurred to him in which one
felony Indictment might be brought by
following out a new line of evidence, and
he would ask that the matter be held in
abeyance until Home future time, so as
to give the jury an opportunity for fur
ther consideration.
The jurors were given leave to retire
and did so, with much more cheerful
countenances th.an when they filed into
the court room. Once in their quarters
the question of pushing the cases in the
Police Court was disposed of by instruct
ing Chairman Irving to get out the neces
sary warrants. Later in the day the
prosecutor and Mr. Irving met and dis
cussed the question of issuing warrants
before night. Then it developed that two
more men than the two already mentioned
might be arrested for complicity In the
conspiracy to steal lumber, provided a
little time was allowed in which to ob
tain certain evidence. It was accordingly
decided not to secure any of the war
rants before next Tuesday.
The prosecutor resolutely refused to
give any information as to the Identity of
the third and fourth persons Implicated
In the Job. In fact, he would not say that
other arrests were contemplated, Irving
â was also reticent, but the facts leaked
out nevertheless, all of the grand Jurors
being cognizant of them.
Prosecutor Dunn, speaking of the mat
ter said: "Within a few days everybody
will know what we propose to* do. i may
state, however, what has actually tran
spired up to the present time In connec
tion with the lumber steal. At the outset
the Grand Jury took testimony on twÂ»
lines â one against Swift for felony in the
collection of false and fraudulent claims*
the other against Swift and Burns for
conspiracy to commit a felony, by ar
ranging to file and collect false "and frau
dulent claims. I suggested tnat so far as
Swift was concerned the law was simple
and that there were no difficulties in the
way. As against the other the law was
in such shape that it was possible to in
dict, but I was still in some doubt as to
the Jury's jurisdiction. The Â«_rrand Jury
â was anxious to have me draw up indict
ments forthwith, and on last Friday I
prepared to write out one against Swift
and another against Burns and Swift to
gether for conspiracy. Then I discovered
that the statutes would not permit of the
recognition by the Grand Jury of the con
spiracy charges against the two men. as
the same constituted misdemeanors and
were only subject to police court action.
I at once telephoned to Chairman Irving
of the Committee on Schools, and when
he came to my office I informed him as
to the facts. We spent two hours to
gether in going over the whole ground,
and finally decided that it was best to lay
tho difficulty before the Grand Jury Sat
urday morning. This was done. At the
same time I advised the Jurors not to
rely altogether upon my opinion, but to
go Into Judge Belcher's court, state the
cases to him and ask whether or not I
was right. This suggestion was adopted
and the Judge sustained my views.
"I will further state that the Grand
Jury tried hard to frame a charge against
Swift on lumber frauds at the Hamilton
Grammar School. Judge Belcher has
suggested that we had better not return
an indictment for felopy against him just
at this time, but try to get further evi

DEAF MTJTES IN COURT.
The Charge of Battery Against J. P.
Howard Dismissed by Judge Low.
"This is the quietest and most peace
able case I have ever tried," remarked
Judge Low yesterday morning after he
had delivered his decision dismissing a
charga of battery against J- F. Howard,
a deaf mute.
Howard was accused of striking Mrs.
Anna Sherman, a deaf mute, on July 5
last. The witnesses in the case, Including
the defendant and complaining witness,
were all deaf mutes, and Sergeant John
Green performed the duty of interpreter
with his usual skill. There was dead
silence in the court room, the only voices
heard being the Judge's when asking a
question, and the serg-t^uit's when relat
ing the answer.
The evidence showed that there was no
battery, and Howard, who Is a respectable
young fellow, was promptly discharged.
When the deaf mutes left the court room
all except Howard held an indignation
meeting In the corridor, and the way
their fingers were manipulated was a
source of wonder.
FIGURES FROM ASSESSOR'S RECORDS
REFUTE STATEMENTS MADE
REGARDING FAVORITISM
IN ASSESSMENTS.
JOHN D. SIEBE,
Republican, Non-Partisan and Popu
list Nomine* for Assessor.
John D. Siebe, the Republican nomi
nee for Assessor, has had a very flat
tering tribute paid to his administra
tion of the affairs of that office dur
ing the past eight years by having nis
candidacy Indorsed by both the. 2son-
Partisan and Populist parties. It Is a
part of the political creed of Populism
to denounce corporations and to claim
in a general manner that these insti
tutions are usually the recipients of
more than their share of favors from
public officials. The municipal con
vention of the People's party did not,
however, find aught in any of Mr.
Siebe's official acts that showed unjust
discrimination on his part in the as
sessment of corporations, and for this
reason, as ',\Â»-ll as his demonstrated fit
ness for the position, they indorsed him
as their unanimous nominee.
During the eight years Mr. Siebe has
served as Assessor he has conducted
the affairs of the office in an upright
and businesslike manner, and in mik
ing assessments has been Just and con
servative in his treatment of both rich
and poor, aimir- as nearly as possi
ble to equalize the burdens of taxation.
In the matter of assessing banks and
franchises of corporations having spe
cial privileges Mr. Siebe's political ene
mies have endeavor* 1 at various tim-'S
to question his Judgment, and some
even have gone so far as to question
his honesty in this respect.
A few figures taken from the recirls
of the Assessor's office demonstrate
that Mr. Siebe has exercised sound
judgment in dealing with the subject
of assessments of banks and franchises
of corporations, and they refute en
tirely the assertions uf those who ac
cuse him of assessing with prejudiced
judgment any class of property.
In 1890, the last year of Mr. Siebe's
predecessor in the Assessor's office, the
assessment of banks was J0, 14ft, 321,
while for the present year the assess
ment of the banks is $10,319,256, being
an increase during the eight years of
Mr. Siebe's administration of $5,169,-
Â»35. In 1890, the assessment of the
franchises of corporations having spe
cial privileges was $4,831,250, and for
the present year the assessment is $11,
026,400, an increase of $6,195,150. This
shows a total increase in corporation
assessments from 1890 to 1898, the pe
riod of Mr. Siebe's incumbency, or $11,
305,085.
In the year IS9O the personal prop
erty assessment roll footed up $66,082,
372, and in ISSB it amounted to $68,695,
110, showing an Increase of but $2,162,
738. When it is considered that there
is an increase in the assessment of
banks and franchises of corporations
having special privileges of $11,365,085
from IS9O to 1898, it certainly disproves
the assertion that the burden of taxa
tion has been increased on the poor and
lightened on the rich.
It shows conclusively that personal
property has decreased materially with
the manufacturer, tradesman and
householder, and has been increased to
the amount of $11. 365, 0^5 with corpora
tions. This increase has been a grad
ual and orderly one, spread out over
a period of eight years, and it demon
strates the wisdom of Mr. Siebe in an
eminent degree.
To have made a radical and exten
sive increase in these assessments
within a period of one year would have
been fraught with great danger to the
city. Thst any radical increase in the
assessments of banks and corporations
would have been bitterly contested in
the courts goes without saying. The
expense of litigation would have been
heavy and would have been an extra
burden upon the taxpayers. During
the time the matter was pending in the
courts, and the litigation could and
doubtless would have extended over a
period of several years, the city would
have been forced to get along without
a dollar of taxes from any of these
banks or corporations. The outcome
of any such proceedings would be prob
lematical, but the chances are that the
city would in the end be beaten.
Mr. Siebe's course has the approval
of a majority of the taxpayers, and
this approval will undoubtedly be man
ifested in a splendid majority for the
Republican nominee when the votes
shall have been counted after the elec
tion
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1898.
A HANDSOME FOUR-MASTER.
n~*HE new schooner Just launched at Eureka has been named James H. Bruce, in honor of the respected marine surveyor
lof the Fireman's Fund. She is I>X feet long, -87 feet broad 12.5 feet deen and will carry 725.000 feet of lumber. She is
1 owned by H. D. Bendixsen, James H. Bruce and others, and from Eureka will go to Port Blakeley to load lumber ror
Newport. Captain Lnristian Petersen, who has been master of the 6chooner Ethel Zane ever since she was launched,
eight years ago, will command the Bruce.
TRANSPORTS

LAST OF THE DERELICTS
TUG MONARCH BRINGS IN A
PORTION OF A RAFT.
Captain Friis of the Bark Martha
Davis Arrives Too Late for His
Wedding, but Neverthe
less It Took Place.
The transport Ohio reached port early
yesterday morning. She was oft the
heads last Friday night, but Captain
Boggs would not take any chances, so he
anchored his vessel until daybreak. The
Ohio came via Nagasaki and Kobe, mak
ing the run from Manila in thirty-four
days. She brought up the following- dis
charged soldiers: H. A. Abbey. Eben L..
Boyce, John F. Gardner, A. Hill, D. L.
Parsons/ Charles J. Roth and Wade H.
Spencer. As the vessel required fumigat
ing, she was sent to the quarantine sta
tion, and was not released until late in
the evening.
Three transports are now in port, and
th.' Newport is hourly expected. The
Valencia, which got in Friday afternoon,
is in splendid shape, and could start back
I again to-morrow. The Ohio is covered
' with barnacles below the water line, and
will have to go on the drydock. The
Senator Is being overhauled at the Union
Iron Works, and will not be ready for
sea before the 16th inst. By that time the
Ohio, Newport and Valencia can be got
â  ready, and the chances are that all four
vessels will go out together.
The Indiana, which sailed from Manila
two days before the Ohio, and which,
when last heard from, was coaling in
i Yokohama, is hourly expected, and may
yet get in before the Newport. Should
she do so, she will, of course,
be added to the fleet. In that
event, about 4500 troops could be taken.
General Miller and his staff will go on the
Newport, so that vessel will be the flag
ship.
After the Indiana and Newport none of
the transports are expected until the 20th
inst The City of Rio de Janeiro sailed
from Kobe on the 4th Inst. She brings
bac-k all the invalided soldiers, and will
not hurry here from Japan. After the
men have been landed she will be re
turned to the Pacific Mail Company, as
she is urgently required for the Chinese
| trade The City of Puebla. which left
! Nagasaki on the 3d inst., will go back
again as soon as she has been over
hauled, however, as will also the Penn
sylvania, St. Paul and Arizona. It will,
therefore, be the end of the month be
fore the tast of the men at the Presidio
will get away for Manila.
There are no more derelict rafts float
ing around the ocean. The last of the
menaces to navigation was brought in
by the tug Rescue yesterday afternoon,
and only a few floating piles are left as a
remindeV of what nearly sank the steamer
Santa Rosa and her couple of hundred
Dissenters The portion brought in by
thÂ£tu# was the last of the lumber raft,
! and is claimed by the crew of the steamer
: Whitesboro. The latter vessel picked up
' the derelict off Pigeon Point and towed it
I into Santa Cruz. There it was left in
charge of watchmen, who only gave It up
o an agreement that all their rights were
to be ?fpoeâ¢ed. There will be litigation
over bothrafts before the claims for salv
ag A e rth r ur Se'waU & Co. of Bath. Me., have
laid the keel of a fine steel ship, which
Is to be the largest American merchant
man afloat She is to be named the Ar
thur SewSa in honor of the head of the
fi The Marlon, Chilcott and the/^rskine
M Phelps left Baltimore within a few
da'vs of each other for this coast, and a
small watrer depends upon the outcome.
The Dirigo is the only steel ship of all
American make afloat, and is on her mai
den voyage. The steel ship Dirigo was
built at Bath, Me., but her steel plates
were rolled in England, while the Phelps'
were completed In the United States. The
Marion Chilcott was formerly the Brit
ish ship Kilbrannon. She was wrecked
in Puget Sound, and purchased by Seat
tle parties, who repaired her and gave
h< r the name of Marlon Chilcott. She
Is a fast vessel, but Captain Graham of
the Phelps is confident that he will over
come the Chilcott'6 start of four days
and reach his destination first.
Another four-masted schooner has been
added to the coasting fleet. The Daunt
less was launched at Hoquiam a few
days ago, and will shortly load lumber
for this port. She is 173 fe*t long, 37 feet
broad and 12 feet deep. She is owned
by a San Francisco Joint stock sompany. i
Captain H. A. Friis of the bark Martha !
Davis has become a benedict. Wednes- ;
day last he was married to Miss Carrie I
C. Cohnick. and will return from his hon
eymoon tour in time to take his vessel to
sea this trip. The Martha Davis seems to
know when there Is a marriage ahead of
her and acts accordingly. When Captain
Soule was master of her he made up his
mind to get married, and the date was
set. It was set for such a date as would
give him ample time to navigate the
bark here from Honolulu and have a few
days to spare In which to buy weddin?
presents. What did the Martha Davis do
but get becalmed and not show up until
a week after the wedding day?
Exactly the same thing happened in the
case of Captain Frils. The day for the
wedding was set and the bark knew It.
so Instead of coming up from Honolulu
in sixteen days and less, as she has done
dozens of tinies. she was thirty-two days
on the passage, and Captain Frils was
late for his wedding. It was at first In
tended to postpone the ceremony until
the return of the vessel on her next trip.
but the gallant skipper was afraid the
Martha Davis might play him another
trick, so he got married at once. No bet
ter '.iked or more able shipmaster come?
into the port of San Francisco than Cap
tain Frii.s and his many friends on the
water front Join in wishing him many
happy year? of married life.
Captain Allen of the Bteamor Del
N'orte was badly bruised by a tiling- full
of goods falling on him. He will be laid
up for pome time, and Captain Stock
fl< th of the Crescent City wil take his
vessel out.

MEN WHO "SQUARE"
POLICE COURT CASES
JUDGE MOGAN DENOUNCES A
LONG-STANDING EVIL.
Grafters Who Hold Court in the Cor
ridor to Be Looked After by
the Police.
Judge Mogan took occasion yesterday
morning to speak from the bench about
an evil that has existed for years around
the Police Courts, and he said he proposed
to put a stop to it, as it was becoming
an Intolerable nuisance.
A woman named Maud Nelson was ar
rested Tuesday night by Policeman Joy
for being a disorderly person. She was
released on $20 cash bail, but when the
case was called Friday morning she
failed to appear, and the Judge declared
her bail forfeited and ordered a bench
warrant issued for her arrest. The
woman Is said to have gone to British
Columbia.
Yesterday morning Attorney Mack ap
peared before the Judge and asked that
the bench warrant be withdrawn, and the
bail- forfeiture declared off. Mack said
that the "woman was outside the court
room Wednesday morning and she was
told that It was all right, that it had
been arranged she would plead guilty and
would get off with a fine of $i.
The Judge declined to accede to either
request and remarked that the evil of
people trying cases in the corridor was
altogether too common, and he would
call the attention of the police to stop It
by arresting the persons who "squared"
cast s. He wanted these persons to un
derstand that all oases must be tried in
open court.

ANOTHER GOLD
BRICK TO OFFER
Will Be Co -Tenant
With the City.
GETS A CYCLERY RENT FREE
THE LATEST SCHEME AS TOLD
BY A BICYCLE AGENT.
Though the City Pays All the Rent
the New Police Station Will
Have but Half the
Building.
Supervisor Devany is about to present
to the city and county of San Francisco
another handsome thing in the gold brick
and the specimen that will be laid
before the admiring eyea of the Board of
Supervisors upon the next most auspicious
occasion is of the pure quill and a good 900
fine. He has no alloys nor afflnltive met
als, but is just one golden, dollar-marked
proposition, from the Devany standpoint.
It consists of simply this: Devany in
tends to be co-tenant with the city in the
new Btanyan-etreet police station, the city
to pay rent for the whole of the present
Devany cyclery and to occupy something
like half the space.
The a&sayer who fused the proposed De
vany brick with this result happens to be
a special agent of the Pope Bicycle Manu
facturing company. He has been in the
city fur some days looking into the bi
cycle situation in general, and more
acutely into the situation out near Goldea
Gate Park, where the Columbia people
and Devany have been running opposition
cycleries. When it was announced that
Devany was going to cycling pastures
new and tnat the police w,ere to take nis
place on Stanyan street the Popes also
thought it might be well to seek another
location where business would bo better.
Steps to this end were taken, and the
Pope cyclery might have been moved
downtown within a few weeks, but sud
denly the evacuation proceedings came to
an abrupt end. The special agent had as
certained that Devany was only playing
possum. According to this agents Btory,
which he sent East to his firm last
ing, Devany is going to reopen his cyclery
in the rear part of the Kagan building,
just behind ihe new police station. The
plan is to partition off the building into
two sections, leaving Devany a 37x107
room, opening on to Page street, east of
Golden Gate avenue. The police station
would thus have a room of only 50x100
feet. Devany has a lease on an adjoining
seventy-nve-"fout lot on Page street, so
that he would have ample room for his
cyclery and riding school. The agent of
the Pope company saw all of these things,
and wrote to his concern in the Last, ad
vising that it should keep open its estab
lishment near LVvany's and "right its
principal competitor."
This little business spat, in which the
public has no Interest, indirectly brought
to light the gold bricks which the city is
to be offen.-d.
The story is told by an admirer of Su
pervisor Devany as follows: "You see,
the bicycle business has been somewhat
dull of "late, and with winter coming on
it promised to be duller than ever. Dev
any had a monthly rental .o pay of Ji6o
to" Ragan. 80 Devany he goes to the ;
owner and says: 'Ragan. I can t afford i
to pay r* a so much money each month.
Mv least- has two years yet to run. "W hat
do* you say to a change? I'll undertake to I
get* the city as a tenant at $IC6 per month,
you giving up say half of the building |
for a police station. The city will take
a two years' lease and spend so much â .
â¢ nn improvements that when the |
lease "expires there will be no difficulty in
renewing it. You will get. a profitable and
a permanent tenant. As for me. I will
want a place for my cyclery. What la
the matter with locating me in the rear
end of the building on Page street? There
is plenty of room. As for rent, why you
will recollect that I have secured you a
fine tenant and as muon money as you
could ever expect to get for the whole
building. One good turn deserves an
Â°t"*l)oan you want it altogether free?'
quoth Ragan, doubtfully.
â¢' 'That's a strange question, replied
Devany "How much money do you ex
pect to gÂ»t for the old shack, anyhow?
ftehin' for more, eh?'
" 'But is $2F. too much for you to pay?
â ' "See here. Ragan, is it a gold brick
that you're tryln to give me? Drop it
now. "You've g<n enough.' "
Ragan dropped it. and it is he. It is
Bald whom Devany with becoming mod
esty will push forward to makf this new
est'presentation when the board and Cap
pun Delany have shaken off the moral
spasms that they were thrown into when
through The Call the public got its first
glance at the original Devany brick.

WORSE THAN
THE CASE OF
FONG SUEY WAN
Mr. Foote Turns Two
Slaves Loose.
CAN ASSIGN NO VALID REASON
THEY SAID THEY WERE NA
TIVE BORN.
Entered a Nolle Pros Without the
Request or Knowledge of the
Attorney for the
Women.
There has been considerable adverse
: comment upon the dismissal by nolle proa
of two Chinese women captured In the re
1 cent raid by Federal officials.
Last Friday morning Mr. Foote appear
1 ed in the United States District Court
' and informed Judge Hawley that he was
I convinced from evidence in his possession
that Kan Tal Sue and Ho Sue Kam, Chi
nese women detained at the Presbyterian
Mission by order of Judge de Haven, were
I entitled to their discharge, and he there
[ fore would enter a nolle pros. This was
I done and the women were released from
i custody by order of the court. The women
were not brougnt before the court for
I identification.
It was taken for granted that the
women had produced certificates on
which they had been landed. But when
Miss Cameron, matron of the Presbyte-
r ian Chinese Mission, visited the Ap
praiser's building yesterday morning to
make inquiry about the affair, and stated
j that the women had no certificate or
j other papers entitling them to land, and
j that they claimed to be native-born Amer
icans, comment became very pronounced.
The situation was not bettered when
shortly after Miss Cameron left the build-
Ing Lawyer A. H. Yordi, attorney for the
' women, 'visited the office of the United
! States Attorney and informed the report
i ers that he had not requested Mr. t oote
I to make the motion, and that the case
i had been dismissed without his having
I been notified. ._....Â» .Â» .
Miss Cameron said she had Intended to
i take the witness stand whenever the case
should be brought up in court, as she and
every one else expected that it would be,
and she was prepared to give Important
j evidence in the matter. She had no doubt
that the girls had escaped from the
! Omaha Exposition. One of them was not
! more than 15 years old They had not
been out of the mission since the morning
after the raid, a weeK ago last Wednes
day, on which day they appeared in court
for the purpose of having their names
taken down. She regretted she had not
been notified that the motion was about
: to be made, for if she had been she would
â  have appeared in court and opposed it
These two women were the strongest
Â° &"I& "I alone am the responsible party."
said District Attorney Foote. 'I; there
! Is anybody to be roasted In the matter
I am the" man. I nolle prossod- that
case on my own motion, and I have a
-ight to nolle pros any case I see tit
I am responsible t only to the Attorney
General of the United States , _
"I did It because I was satisfied from
evidence . in my-. . -possession, thai the
women are native born." ,_^_ â¦ >,
"Did you get the evidence from the
court records?" was asked
"Did you get the evidence from the
Chinese Bureau?"
"Yes "
Chief Meredith of the Chinese Bureau
said in answer to a reportorial question
that he had furnished Mr. Foote with the
statements of the women taken in the
Presbyterian Mission Immediately after
their arrest by the Federal raiders. That
was the only evidence the bureau had
taken or given In the matter.
When Chinese claiming to be native
: born are brought before United States
Commissioner Heacock several wit
nesses are required to prove the asser
tions of the applicants, and they are sub
! jected to the most rigid cross-examina
tion. The women should have been
brought before Commissioner Heacock,
I where they would have been required to
produce witnesses to prove their state
ments. ;â '; ;. '
Why Mr. Foote accepted the uncorrob
orated statements of the two slaves and
why he did not bring the women before
Commissioner Heacock instead of turn
ing them loose on their bare word would
make very interesting reading.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1898.
EVA HESS IS
SEEN EN ROUTE
TO VICTORIA
The Missing Girl on
the Walla Walla.
A YOUNG FRIEND WITH HER
ON ARRIVAL SHE JOINS A
WOMAN AND DISAPPEARS.
Information Given by One of the
Passengers â Attracted by Her
Youth and Strange
Actions.
At last what seems a aeflnite clew to
j the whereabouts of Eva Hess, the young
gir! who so suddenly disappeared from
! this city a short time ago, has been ob-
I tallied. It promises to determine where
j the girl is either in hiding with her own
I volition or being hidden by her abductors.
The Information comes from a passen
â  ger who sailed aboard the Walla Walla
I on the last trip made by the vessel to
] British Columbia. He claims that he can
positively identify her, as he saw and took
especial notice of her. He says that on
i the day the vessel sailed he noticed the
i missing girl in company with another
â¢ girl, also of Immature years. He remarked
to a number of friends at the time that
the girl was unusually young to take such
a journey, practically alone and unpro
! tected, her only escort apparently being
j the young girl who accompanied her.
When asked as to whether an older per
son was with her, the informant was at
a loss to declare himself positively, ;i_s lie
had seen no other companion except the
girl alluded to.
What attracted the attention of fellow
passengers to the young traveler was that
she setmed unusually restless and en
deavored at every opportunity to Inter
mingle with the merrymakers on board
the steamer and sing and dance as li' she
were afraid, or for some oilier reason dis
liked to be alone. Her every action was
Birange in the extreme, ana it is now
thougru that she either n-pented her
folly after she boarded the steamer or
was fearful that some one would recog
nize her and possibly prevent her from
landing at Victoria.
From the description given, the girl is,
beyond a doubt, Eva Hess,
As the steamer neared Victoria the
Informant who furnished the present clew
decided to watch the girl and ascertain
where she went after going ashore. As
the wharf was approached it was noticed
that the girl began to scan its entire
length, evidently expectant of gaining a
sight of some one to whom she had bt?Â»>n
directed and whom she was to accompany
upon leaving the boat.
L'pon landing she immediately joined a
woman, th<- same undoubtedly that she
was bo restless about meeting,
after she was lost in the crowd to uiose
who had been keeping an Inquisitive
watch over her.
At lirst sight of the woman who met
the girl the immediate Impression con
veyed to the author of the present state
ment was that -she was in bad company,
and with a woman from whom she could
expect to derive no good, but on the con
trary by whom she would be forced to
imitate the life which Wius so legibly
written on every Itae of her escort glace.
Thf- mother of the girl .tas placed her
confidence and hope for the recovery of
the girl in the hands of Dorn * l>om the
attorneys. The police are still searching,
but blindly and without a tangible ciow
to work upon.
GRAIN MARKET ACTIVE
DURING THE PAST WEEK
WHEAT WAS IN DEMAND AT
FULL PRICES.
Barley Sold Above Its Actual Value.
Corn Tried to Advance but With
Little Effect.
V.'heat prices hero have been fairly ac
tive during the past week, December sell
ing from $1 23% to $1 15%, closing on Sat
urday at $1 17%. There has been a fair
demand for spot at full prices. English
markets have rather favored buyers
Milling demand at home has been good
yet not urgent. Washington and Oregon
offerings have been somewhat restricted.
Farmers continue to hold their crops,
selling about enough to keep the market
moderately supplied. The Oriental de
mand for flour continues to increase.
Continental and European bids are out of
the question, inasmuch as there is little
or no wheat In California for export, at
least for the present.
Local operators are disposed to favor the
short side on rallies, sometimes pressing
their bets on declines, generally resulting
in a quick reaction forcing shorts to cover
at a lo*s The market reHponds to bull
news very easily, showing the nervous
ness of the market. There appears a
Btrong under-current to the market which
may soon show itself more fiercely. It be
trins to look as if wheat pries have seen
about bottom for the present at least.
Barley has been king for the past,
month, December going to $1 26%. The
enthusiasm of the corner crowd was bad
ly warped during the latter part of the
week when it was given out that the rail
road rates had been sufficiently reduced
to admit of the importing of Eastern
barley to California. There is now en
route one train load of twenty cars of
barley destined to California polnta. An
other consignment of thirty-six cars is
now being loaded. The free movement of
oats from Oregon and Washington consti
tutes another factor of weakness in bar
ley The time of delivery is rapidly ap
proaching those who have been holding
on to long barley bought around $1 35 to
$1 40 These will be disappointed as they
have never wanted the actual stuffâdif
ferences was their goal. It surely looks
as if they would get real differences m
9tÂ£>f arlev is the one commodity selling
above Its actual worth. Such conditions
are unnatural and cannot prove success
ful December barley at $1 20 will look
clear within ten days" time.
The Chicago wheat market during the
week has shown considerable strength in
Ismail way. December sold at 61% cents
on Tuesday up to 63% cents on 1- riday.
The trade is Inclined to take the long
Bide around 62 cents. The good foreign
and home consumptive demand keeps well
apace with offerings.
The Northwest receipts are gradually
growing less, showing a fair sized de
crease as compared with last year. This
does not argue of a small crop, rather
that holders are not selling and will not
until more favorable prices are offered.
Indications would suggest 60 cents the low
point this crop year. While no material
advance may come at present, the chances
are favorable to a gradual upward tend
ency The Government report on Monday
will probably reaffirm its last review.
Corn seems trying hard to advance.
The queerest of all things is the bullish
ness of professional traders who have had
their horns on for two years and in no
way do they seem able to bolster up the
price. Arguments of the most convincing
character are given out, yet corn hovers
around 30 cents. The Government Agri
cultural Department estimates the crop
of 1898 at 1,900,000,000 bushels, the Cincin
nati Price Current, 1,750.000,000, and the
average bull speculators claim these esti
mates are about 300,000,000 too high. Who
ever is right there seems plenty to go
around for present wants. Cribbers are
talking bullish and selling freely, showing
they nave every confidence in getting
their money out of their holdings so that
speculators may receive some benefit.
The situation is one that does not argue
well for any material advance.
Provisions have had a hard time fight
ing yellow fever, which must soon cease.
January short ribs are considered very
cheap. Packers are quietly buying* on
declines, trying not to affect prices. Re
ceipts of hogs must soon show a large
decrease. Hog products are low and can
not be manufactured at prices now in
effect. R. E. MULCAHY,
CONNOLLY BENEFIT.
It Drew a Large Crowd to Union
Square Hall.
An entertainment was given at Union
square Hall last night under the auspices
of El Dorado Parlor No. 52 of the Native
Sons of the Golden West, the , South End
Rowing Club and Golden Gate Council
No. 34 of the Young Men's Institute, for
the benefit of the parents of the late
Daniel D. Connolly, a popular oarsman
and singer. Alfred J. Fritz, Democratic
nominee for Justice of the Peace, acted
as master of ceremonies.
The programme contained twelve num
bers, but, for the convenience of the per
formers, the order of these was some
what changed. After an overture by
Grennan's orchestra the Columbian quar
tetâJ. C. Flood, nrst tenor; F. A. Grif
fing. second tenor; J. C. O'Donnell, first
bass; and S. J. Daly, second bassâ opened
the entertainment with glees. Then fol
lowed a vocal solo by Mrs. E. W. Burns,
a fancy dance by Violet Hanna, and "My
Honolulu Lady" by John Cathcart. Fred
Lewis gave a graceful exhibition of club
swinging, the hail being darkened and
the clubs enveloped In flames. A sailor
dance by Miss Ida Bradbury, a vocal solo
by A F. Medley, an excellent clog dance
by the Kavanaugh sisters, a recitation in
Swedish-English by Joseph Hansen, and
a song by William Donaldson led up to
the last item on the programmeâ a three
round boxing contest between R. Mc-
Arthur and Frank McConnell. The boxers
set to with a will and gave a very lively
exhibition. After the entertainment.
which was remarkably well attended, the
floor was cleared for dancing.
THE COMING INDUSTRY
OF VENTURA COUNTY
BEET SUGAR FACTORY ERECTED
AT OXNARD.
All the Farmers Are Getting Mag
nificent Returns From Small
Acreage Seeded Last
Season.
C. Leonardt of Los Angeles, now stop
ping at the Palace, gives some valuable
information in regard to the present
status of sugar-beet growing in Ventura
County. He is more especially interested
in the recently completed factory at Ox
nard, of which he is one of the con
tractors.
"The new factory," he said, "is both
designed and constructed by the Oxnard
Construction Company of New York. It
is 100 feet In height, over 400 feet long and
120 feet wide. It is constructed entirely of
brick and steel with expanded metal, lire
proof floors. A large power house, up
right and rotary lime kilns, a four-story
brick orflce building and a beet shed cap
able of receiving 2000 tons of beets, com
pose what is, in every way, a model plant
âthe equal, I believe, of anything of its
kind in either this country or In Europe.
It cost $1,500,000 and when running full
b'last will give employment to about 4uo
men."
"How about this season's crop? he was
asked.
"Splendid, but small in the aggregate.
I must explain. Owing to the light rain
fall of last winter the farmers, generally,
were exceedingly apprehensive in regard
to this season's crops, and did but little
planting. The small average which was
planted, however, gave magnitlcent re
sults, proving conclusively that sugar
beets do not require as much moisture as
moist growers believe. In one instance
thirty acres put in by a farmer named
Rose yielded about thirty tons to the
acre, from which he will clear, over and
above all expenses of cultivation, nearly
$;iOOO. A. Carr, who rented 100 acres of
good beet land, agreeing to give one Quar
ter of his crop to the owner of the land,
cleared up as his share $5500. Charles
Dunlan also got very large returns from
what In 1 planted. These men wore all
obliged to ship their beets to Chlno this
year, but will In future patronize the new
plant. â¢
"The beets this year yielded from $4 to
$5 per ton, according to their saccharine
character. There are 40,000 acres avail
able for the cultivation of the beets.
"Now, as perhaps you may imagine
little is thought of but the sugar beet, of
which the factory will handle about 200,000
tons next season, but every dollar em
barked in the industry is of greater bene
fit to the country than if it wore im
in the Philippines or Cuba. I believe in
keeping money at home."

YIN MARIANI (MARIANI WINE) is invaluable
at this season of the year, when, owing to trying
climatic changes, the system is especially suscep-
tible to attacks of maiaria and la grippe.
iIARIANI WINE is especially indicated for
General Debility, Weakness from whatever causes,
Throat and Lung Diseases, Overwork, Profound
Depression and Exhaustion, Consumption, Malaria
and La Grippe.
fIARIANI WINE as a general tonic and invig-
orator is unequaled. It gives power to the brain,
richness to the blood, firmness and elasticity to the
muscles, and strength to the entire nervous sys-
tem. Therefore is it described as a promoter of
good health and longevity. It contains absolutely
no injurious properties, as any conscientious physi-
cian or chemist will certify.
fIARIANI WINE is an adjuvant in convales-
cence and a powerful rejuvenator. For Overworked
Men, Delicate Women, Sickly Children it works
wonders. It soothes, strengthens and sustains the
system.

THE CALIFORNIA title insurance AND
trust company
Issues policies of insurance upon realty titles, '
which guarantee purchasers and their heirs
against losses from defective searches.
The company has a paid-up capital of $200,000 .
and a reserve fund of $25,000, which amply j
guarantees every policy.
The leading banks accept Its policies and loan
money upon the property of which the title is
Insured without other search.
Having a complete abstract plan the com- ;
pany is able to make and continue abstracts for
u?e of attorneys at shortest possible notice.
The advantage of a policy when a man j
wishes to convert his property into cash quickly
or to make loans upon it has been proven â 
again and again by experience. The man with j
a guarantee title finds that he can borrow ;
money with an much ease as if he had stocks ;
and bonds."â Chicago Tribune.
"The guarantee of such companies protects
purchasers of property and mortgages against
risks which, though remote, always attend real
estate transactions. The most experienced j
lawyer may err, especially where the law is un- j
determined an ! fraud Is an element of danger."

THE SAN FHAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1893.
ROCK ISLAND
BOY WAS IN
GREAT FORM
Should Win the Stake
at Ingleside.
TOD SLOAN DEFEATS SKYBALL
THE OPEN STAKE BRINGS TO
GETHER CRACK HOUNDS.
The Tavorites Had It All Their Own
Way and the Pikers
Went Home
Broke.
The recent rains have put the Ingleslde
Coursing Park in first-class condition
for ideal coursing, and the runs of yes
terday demonstrated this fact on several
occasions. The Ingleeide Club entertained
its patrons yesterday with an open stake
that will be finished to-day. From the
present outlook it certainly should go to
Rock Island Boy on his performance ol
yesterday, the great puppy defeating 1...
S. Conley with ease at the score of 24 to
5. Rock Island Boy has been on the sick
list from a bite he received about two
wi-eks ago, yet yesterday he seemed none
the worse for his injury and literally ran
rings around L. S. Conley. who Is consid
ered somewhat of a dog himself when
he gets down to work and gives lurch
ing a wide berth.
Patria did stand a fair chance to se
cure prize money, but the clever little
bitch was certainly out of form yester
day, and it took three courses for Judge
Grace to decide that Patria was winner
over Eclipse. Brilliantine and Mayflower
ran excellent courses, the latter bltcl
showing plenty of speed and demonstrat
ing that her lay-off and rest for a couple
of weeks was what she needed, Tod Sloan
made a good impression on the public,
defeating Skybali after he had lead up
and had things for a while all his own
way, but Sky ball is not the dog he was,
and he gradually died out, leaving all
the work to Tod, which he did gamely,
killing the hare near the escape after a
long and fast course.
Bean Pup was played all over the ring
by the short-endera as a good thing, the
dog at one time being as good as 24 to
1 but he was never beard from and was
defeated handily by Bonita.
The day throughout was the talent s
matinee, and short-endera were set down
hard. Among the few that landed were
Tod Sloan at 5 to 3, Maid of Hill at 2Va
to 1, Jack of Spados at 3 to 1 and Coun
terfeit at 2 to 1.
The results were as follows:

GOOD RUNNING HABES.
Dogs That Won and Lost Yesterday
at Union Coursing Park.
Coursing at Union Park yesterday WU
excellenVowtn* to the late rain wh h
made soft the ground and unproved the
running qualities of the bares.
in the puppy stake there were cjuJte a
number of surprise. The ; defeat of Bt
Gertrude by Maid of Bah, after a no
course, made sad many of the knowing
ones who swamped the pool boxes at
odds of 5 to 1. with St. Gertrude the fav
orite Those who had seen the grueling
courses which St. Gertrude had had last
Sunday at lngleslde doubted her ability
to cope with Maid of Bail, a young bitch
which has greut speed backc-d up by good
the Maid did not allow
her opponent to score In a courae to the
farthest escape. , ,
CandaJeria, In a short course to a. tricky
hare defeated the favorite. Bit. ot 1- ash
ion Arab, a favorite in the betting, was
bowled over by Beauty Spot.
In the open stake the betting opened
with odds of 25 to 1 on Forgive winning
a flag from Riddle (late I'arnell). This
was certainly a cinch, an Riddle was
never allowed to get near to the game.
McKlnley. one of the fastest dogs pn the
coast, sold at $20 as against Jl on Gulden
Eaele. The last named doy r;m well, but
not well enough to defeat the President.
The first short end in this stake ap
peared in the thirteenth course, when
Little Delight beat O'Grady, a 2 to 1 shot.
Vigilant Peaceful Glen and Prince of
Fashion were fortunate in getting byes
Magic aent Wayfarer to his kennel, much
to the chagrin of the longenders. Winged
Foot made nervous the "highflyers" who
watered 40 to 1 that Rosette would win
in a walk. Winged Foot led to the hare
and scored two turns before Rosette took
possession, then the bitch held her game
until she fcored Just enough points to
beat her opponent.

two "tenderloin toughs," were yesterday
held to answer before the Superior Court
by Judge JoachlmÃen on a charge of
grand larceny. Several days ago they
induced Alexander Wheatley of Los An

ey boasted of being a lighter, and when
they got him there he whs knocked out
by a blow on the Jaw and robbed of his
money and Jewelry.'

DEATH UNDER CAR WHEELS.
Hans Hansen Horribly Mangled and KjHed
on the San Mateo Street Line.
Hans Hansen. a bootblack, about 50 years old, was run over and in
stantly killed by car 10 of the San Mateo street line at the corner of How
ard and Steuart streets at 15 minutes of 10 o'clock last night.
The bootblack was crossing Howard street with a friend, when the car
came up Steuart street on its way to the turntable at the ferry end of the
line Hansen stopped shortly before the car reached the crossing and
then attempted to cross the track. The motorman, thinking Hansen would
wait till ho had passed, did not try to stop the car, and the bootblack
was struck. He was rolled for some distance under the car before it could
be stopped. In order to secure the body it was necessary to remove the car
from the track.
The body was horribly mangled by the collision. Both arms and legs
were nearly torn from the trunk, hanging by shreds of skin. The roar
portion of the skull was crushed in and the face so badly lacerated that
recognition was hardly possible.
Owen Cunningham, who was with Hansen at the time of the accident,
was the only witness of the circumstances. To Deputy Coroner J. G.
Tyrrell who took the body to the Morgue, Cunningham attempted to make
a Statement, but was under the influence of liquor to such an extent that
he could give no clear account of the affair.
Tlie motorman, Arthur Watts, stated to the Deputy Coroner that he
waÂ« going up Steuart street at the usual rate of speed, when he noticed
Hansen near the track. "The man stopped." said Watts, "and I thought
he would not try to cross the track until I had passed. To me he seemed
to be Intoxicated, and inquiries from people who came up after the acci
dent showed that my suppostion was correct."
Watts was arrested I>\ the police from the Harbor station, and was
Immediately transferred to the City Prison, where a charge of man
slaughter was placed against him. He was Immediately released on his
own recognizance by Captain Spillane of the Southern station.
CLIPPERTON
ISLAND AND
ITS JAPS
Trouble With Labor
ers Explained.
CAPTAIN FREETH'S STORY
THE ISLAND NOW WORKED UN
DER MEXICO'S FLAG.
Guano Deposits Will Last for Eight
Years â Wharves Erected and
Every Convenience Pro
vided for Shipping.
Cllpperton Island is acquiring? rather
too much reputation for a louety. eruano
covered. crab-infested reef. Situated off
the coast of Mexico, it has had quite an
International history. First it was dis
covered by the English, then the French
laid claim to it. Later on it was thought
that the United States had a right to the
Isle, and a citizen of the Union actually
hoisted the stars and stripes. Now It ap
pears finally settled that the place bo
longs to Mexico, and, under a concession
from our sister republic, J. T. Arundel,
representing a great English syndicate,
is busily engaged in depriving the island
of its one marketable commodity, the
guano, which has been deposited there
for centuries.
Captain Freeth, Mr. Arundel's man
ager, who has just arrived in San Fran
cisco fresh from the briny guano de
posits, pooh-poohs all the stories of trou
ble with the Japanese laborers which
have recently been published by some
sensational newspapers in this city.
"We had no serious difficulty with the
Japanese," he said yesterday, "beyond
what might be expected from these cun
ning sons of the East. We took down
seventy-live Japs in the Alice Blanchard
last June. They were supposed to be
under the charge of a man caned Wll
burton, who proved totally unable to
manage them. Why, he had only been
on the island ten days when he came to
me and asked to be released from his
contract, which bound Iv.m for a year.
Some of the Japanese ringleaders organ
ized a strike because they objected to
the hours of work stipulated in their con
tract, but eventually an agreement was
arrived at.
"We have brought up two cargoes of
guano in the Alice Blanchard to San
Diego, and when I left the island on Sep
tember 17 everything was quiet. Then
had been some talk of another strike, and
one man, who declined to join the dis
contented faction, imagined himself in
danger and swam off to the steamer. We
brought him on to San Diego, and at the
same time we offered any of the Japs
wh<> did not like the work a passage
back to their homos, but they refused
to accept. They had good food, better
than they ever had before in their lives,
and not too much work, so they were not
anxious for a chanjie.
"Clipperton Inland is not exactly a
pleasant place to live on, and I do not
intend to stay there permanently. Mr.
Burlelgh, the secretary, is at present in
charge. We have put up a good wharf
and permanent moorings, so that we can
ship a hundred tons of guano a day.
There is no longer any danger about the
work. It will take. I expect, about eight
years to exhaust the guano deposits on
the island.'"

oeasfol benefit sale ever organized in aid
of St. Peter and St. Paul's Church. The
fair will be opened by Mayor Phelan on
October 17, at the Washington Square

The ladies of the executive committee
deserve great credit for the zeal and ener
gy with which tney sustain their arduous
labors. Nothing is left undone to make
the hall and the various booths as at
tractive as possible for the occasion. Ow
ing to their efforts, in a comparatively
short time several booths have been pre
pared and richly furnished with prizes and
attractive specialties. A select committee
1h preparing an interesting series of en
tertainments, and is doing itÃ work so
well that the programme, when published,
cannot fail to draw large crowds to the
fair.
With so much activity and intelligent
zeal on the part of the lady directors the
enterprise may be looked forward to aÂ»
one of the social attractions of the sea
son.

STRIPES OF
A FELON FOR
A. C WIDBER
Found Guilty of Felony
Embezzlement.
HUNG ON THE CONFESSION
IT WAS RE-HEAD AND THEN A
VERDICT WAS REACHED.
The Prisoner Was Unmoved When
His Fate Was Determined â Sen
tence Will Be Passed
Next Saturday.
Augustus C. Widber must wear a felon's
stripes for his crime of looting- the vaults
of the city treasury. Yesterday morning,
at 11 o'clock, after having been out for !
over twenty hours, the jury selected to
determine the fate of the defaulter hand
ed In a verdict of guilty as charged, and
the prisoner was returned to his cell in
the County Jail to await the. day of sen
tence, next Saturday.
There were many in the court when the
verdict was announced, and all plainly
showed that their sympathies were with
the convicted defaulter. Many openly ex
pressed the opinion that they did not be.
lieve that he alone stole and caried away
the entire amount of the shortage. Others,
accepting the theory that he did, sympa
thized with him for the reason that the
temptation offered was so great. They
held that had Mayor Phelan desired to
do his honest duty and count the money,
as the law strictly stated he should do,
Instead of seeking some pretext through
which he could pose and play to and gain
the plaudits of the gallery, the young man
who, not many months ago, had a bril
liant future before hir^ would not now
occupy the cell of a feion.
Widber alone was unmoved when the
verdict was announced. At 10 o'clock in
the morning he was removed from his
cell to the courtroom to await the return
of the jury, which had passed the night be
hind bolted doors in the St. Nicholas
Hotel. Evidently the prisoner was or the
opinion that the fact of the jury having
been out all night meant a favorable de
cision; but if any such opinion occupied
his mind it was an erroneous one Half
an hour after the jury had returned Irom
the hotel the ringing of the bell an
nounced that it had either reached a ver
dict or wanted Instructions. It was seek
ing further instruction, and when it had
been seated in the courtroom the foreman
asked that the jury be permitted to again
read the confession made by the Prisoner
the day after the arrest, if Judge C.OOK
had any doubt regarding the propriety
of again submitting the confession to the
lurv it was removed by WJdber. w ho per
sonally admitted the right of the Jury to
become better acquainted- with its con
tents On securing the confession, the
jury again retired for further deliberation
3 A few minutes passed, the bell again
rang and the foreman announced that a
verdict had been reached. "We find the
defendant guilty of embezzlement, an
nounced the foreman "but are unable to
fix the amount of his defalcation. It
was the opinion of some that the amount
of his defalcation should be fixed at $11S,
536 97, the exact amount known to have
been taken from the treasury while oth
ers held that he should be charged only
with the embezzlement of $76,242 04, the
amount set forth In the indictment. In
reply Judge Cook informed Foreman Mli
lei' that it was solely within the province
of the jury to fix the amount of the de
falcation but called attention to the fact
that Widber was charged in the indict
ment upon which he was tried, with the
embezzlement of $76,242 54. This was suffi
cient, and the jury retired to fix the
amount of the defalcation. Within a few
minutes the jury again returned and
found the defendant guilty of having em
bezzled the amount set forth in the in
dictment. Widber remained as unmoved
as the Sphinx when the verdict was an
nounced. After the jury had been dis
charged he rose from his seat and accom
panied his guard from the courtroom and
was immediately returned to his cell in
the County Jail. â â â ' â â â - >â  â¢

determined that Widber must pay the
penalty for his crimes are: W. E. Love

i the human body these germs of

lerfect digestion of food; the result
ndigestion or dyspepsia,

sadden mass which ferments (the first
process of decay), poisoning the blood,
making it thin, weak, and lacking in
red corpuscles: poisoning the brain,
causing headaches and pain in the eyes.
Bad digestion irritates the heart.
causing palpitation and finally bring-
ing on disease of this very important
digestion poisons the kidneys,
causing Bright's disease and diabetes.
And this is so because every organ,
nerve, depends upon the stomach
alone for nourishment and renewal,
and weak digestion shows itself not
only in loss of appetite and flesh, but in
weak nerves and muddy complexion.

said the best start in life is a sound

proper quantity of digestive acids .

WILL HAVE TO
MAKE A NEW
TAX ORDINANCE
Reason Why the "Six"
Ignored Thomas.
KNEW OF HIS INTENTION
WOODWAED AGAIN COMES INTO
PROMINENCE.
President Heitmann Says He Will
Discuss the Question When
a New Levy Is
Proposed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 8.
President Heitmann of the City Council,
when asked this morning for his reason
for not attending the conference on the
tax levy called by the Mayor last even-
Ing, said: 'i read in the papers that the
Mayor intended to veto the ordinance,
and consequently I could see no purpose
in discussing the matter. "We could not
change the ordinance without it going
back to the Council, being passed to
print and going through the routine of
such matters, and in the Council cham
ber is the proper place under the circum
stances to discuss it. Had the Mayor not
said that he intended to veto it 1 might
have been present, but it was no use
wasting time, and 1 stayed away. I do
not know why the others did not attend."
Foreseeing such a deadlock as has oc
curred. Councilman Cuvellier secured the
passage of a resolution a week^ ago ex
tending the time for tixing the uix levy
one month from the first Monday in Oc- i
tober. This will give ample time in which :
to prepare another ordinance.
Everybody at the City Ha.l is now at
sea regarding the tax levy. They are all
spending money in their various depart
ments on the presumption that they will
be [owed as much money as last year,
whereas if the ideas of the S..lid Six
Couneilmen prevail, they will have spent
all their income by January, and the city
will have to close down its business for
the remainder of the fiscal year.
The amusing Incident in the affair is
the position of Mr. Woodward. This un
fortunate gentleman, although only one
of the Solid Six and no more reprehen
sible than the other five, always sue- j
ceeds in occupying the position of being
the man on whose vote all depends. His
fellow-supporters of the obnoxious tax
ordinance were expressing amusement i
to-day that he had attended the Mayor's
meeting last nisrht and shown some .
Vacillation reg; ling his position, es
pecially as Woodward took the trouble
last Monday night to read a lengthy
typewritten report in support of his vote. i
The Mayor has not yet vetoed the ordi
dinance, and sent it back to the Council,
but it is presumed he will do this before
next Monday night.
Councilman Woodward Issued the fol
lowing statement to-day:
I propose to stand by the proposition of maJc-
Injr these grand Improvements for the city. I
think they will benefit the entire people.
The lake certainly ought to be dredged and
cleansed of inÂ« filth ami sewerage it now con- ;
tains end trtut i>- constantly -twins dumped into
It. The sewerage of KS people Is drained Into
Cemetery Creek. This creek should be diverted
and the sewerage matter run int'j the main >
lake sewer. We already have rights of way
granted for this improvement.
As I am In favor of these public improve- j
ments provided for in the levy of 51 21 I pro
pose to stand by the measure unless something â 
-better Is submitted to me.
I am not in favor of crippling the depart
ments of the city, but I flrml> believe that
tlie.^e improvements can be made with the $1 21
levy if rigid economy is practiced in the ad
ministration of the city government.
In conclusion. I firmly I eve, from a:: the ,
information 1 can secure, that the whole of
Lake Merritt can be dredged by June 30. 1599.
Th- best citizens of this city, larK-? property
owners as well as small one*, are one and all
Interested to see nur city cleaned up and im
proved. Mr. Prini Cuuncilman-at-large from
the Seventh Ward, la In favor of the appro
priation of { SO. 000 to Improve the lake and
dredge it at once. E. W. WOODWARD.

made on evidence secured by Krueger,

MAYOR THOMAS has been

that the Mayor was given the

it.
"It happened this way," said the
Mayor, li: telling of tho unph
ent: "A few weeks ago Mr.
Schilling was advised by Dr. Wool-
Bey that the condition of his liver

groat benefit to Mr. Schilling's dl
gostion. None of these recom
mendations appealed to Mr. Scml
ling's idea of what was acceptable,
so he and Dr. Woolsey started in to
invent a shaking machine. They
succeeded admirably, and in Mr.
Schilling's garden there Is now one
of the best liver and Reart regulat
ors that I ever heard of. It looks
like a box on the top of which is
a platform covered with a leather
mat. Alongside this tricky box is a
gauge, by which you can set the
electricity and regulate the amount
of the shake. The other afternoon
I was there and was invited to take
a shake. I mounted the box bravely
and Mr. Schilling set the gauge.
"No man yet born can describe
what followed. An earthquake is
nothing by comparison. That
platform can shake enough
to reduce a man to dust.
I understand Mr. Schilling is
losing a little flesh by taking a dally
shake before breakfast. I shall not
wonder in the near future if I hear
that Mr. Schilling has disappeared â
been literally shnken out of sight.
There is no doubt it is a great ma
chine. You start very gently, and
it reminds you of the sensation of
being kicked downstairs. Turn on a
little more electricity and you think
of a violent railroad collision; turn
the dial still farther around and you
don't think at all. But put the ma
chine at full speed and it isâ it isâ"
and the Mayor coughed.
The shaker works by electricity,
and the motionâ or commotion â is
produced by a series of wheels of
different diameter and different
shakes rattling underneath the plat
form. The victim iÂ« at n<> tim'>
shaken more than two inches in one
direction, but the feeling is such
that he thinks he is being tossed
around frfim one side of the street
to the other.
"No on* needs to be told that it
shakes up a man's system," says
the Mayor. "It shakes up his every
thing "and makes his blood run
around till he loses track of it. I
tell you that there are more un
pleasant things in the world than
being given the shake by a friend,
and one of them is the shake that
Mr. Schilling- gave me."

BERKELEY WINS THE GAME.
University of California and Wash
ington Volunteers Line Up
the College Campus.
BERKELEY, Oct. B.â The college team
of the University of California and a
team from the Washington volunteers
faced each other tills morning upon the
college football field. Unfortunately the
rain had completely spoiled the ground.
Playing went on in an inch or two of
mud. The army men showed up in good
form against their opponents, the differ
ence in weight being largely in their
favor. They failed, however, to carry on
a strong aggressive game, and as a result
the ball most of the time was in their
own territory. During the first half
Berkeley managed to get the ball over
the line once, but after that no points
were made. The game at the close stood
sâ(i5 â (i in Berkeley's favor.

GRAND JURY'S
LABORS ABOUT
TO CONCLUDE
Not Pleased With the
Showing.
SOME SCANDALS OF JUSTICE
ENOBMOUS SUMS PAID TO PETTY
OFFICIALS.
Constables and Justices Alone Tax
Every Registered Voter
One Dollar Per
Head.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
, 908 Broadway, Oct. 8.
The Grand Jury now in office enjoya tne
distinction of having served a longer term
than any other Grand Jury In this county.
The law requires that two grand Juries
shall be drawn each year, and as the pres
ent jury was impaneled December 27, ISS97,
it will soon have to quit, although there
Is a lot of work which It would like to
take up.
For several weeks the members have
been trying to reach a final report, but
matters of importance have always pre- !
vented It. At present they are delving |
Into the affairs of Justices and Constable* !
and some astonishing facts have come to
light. A report of all the costs of Con
stables and Justices in Alameda County
for the last fiscal year shows that these
petty offices cost the county the enormous
sum of J24,38t>, and this, of course, is inde
pendent of the civil business done by
these offices. This large amount repre
sents a tax of $1 per head on every voter
whose name appears in the Great' Regis
ter. The cost of the four departments of
the Superior Court for fhe same period
was $12,477, and some members of the
Grand Jury are outspoken in their opinion
that it is high time some legislative action i
was taken.
And yet, in spite of the great amounts
paid to these petty officials by the county,
there la evidence to show that even the
bail money and fines in some instances are
not turned into the county treasury
Many additional scandals have been laid
before the Grand Jury than those which
have been made public through the issu
ance of indictments and the subsequent
trials. In the Justices' Courts of Oakland
and Hmoklvn Township* especially much
underhanded and criminal work has come i
to light, although great difficulty has been !
experienced In locating the responsibility
for it.
"We are not at all satisfied," said one
of the grand jurors, "with the result of :
our work. We have investigated many ;
Berloua affairs, including the water rate!

LIGHT CONTRACT VETOED.
The Mayor Says It Contains Evi
dences of Fraud.
Mayor Phelan yesterday vetoed de
mands on the city treasury aggregating
$24,626, for lighting the streets in August.
His reasons, are set forth in the follow
ing communication, which will be present
ed to the Supervisors next Monday:
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7-, 1533.
To the Honorable, the Board of Supervisor*
of the City and County of San Francisco â Gen
tlemen: I herewith return to you without my
approval authorizations Nos. 211* and 220 (sec
ond series) and demands on the Treasury cov
ering the same, drawn in favor of the Ban
Francisco Gas and Electric Company for an
aggregate sum of $24,625 06, being the first pay
ment under an alleged contract made and en
tered into between the Board of Supervisors
and the lighting company for two years from
August 1, IMS. The reason for my objection
is ati follows:
The contract Itself was vetoed by me on
August 5 of this year on the ground that there
was a case pending in court to determine the
rights of the Mutual Electric Light Company
which, if determined in favor of the company,
would give the city and the citizens the benefit
of a competitor lor public and private light
ing; saving the city at least $40,000 per year
and the consumers $100,000, and that case, sub
mitted in June last, has not yet been decided.
'The veto was overridden by the votes of nine
members of the Board of Supervisors, includ
ing Supervisor Rottanzi. whose vote was nec
essary in order to override th-; veto, and against
which I protested at the time. There is a
grave question as to his right to vote as a
member of the Board of Supervisors, because
he has accepted and holds a lucrative office
under the United States, as- well as an offlce
of profit under this city and State, which is
inhibited by section JO, article IV of the con
stitution. 1 find this, language In Desty's "Con
stitution of California," page 250: "The ap
pointment to a second incompatible office is
not absolutely void, but the first office Is ipso
facto vacated." (Blencourt vs. Parker, 27
Texas, 655.) ; " V-:.- '. I
As a further objection I desire to point out
that the contract is Illegal, as it should have
been let under the provisions of the act of
March, 1805. That act requires a ten-day publi
cation and posting of a notice inviting propo
sals and limits the power of the city to let a
contract of this kind for more than one year.
The Supervisors in this case gave but five
days' notice and have undertaken to let the
contract for two years.
Furthermore, the specifications prepared by
the Supervisors show internal evidence of a dc
sir* to suppress competition, which is con
trary to the very letter, purpose and intent of
the law. (Santa Rosa Lighting- Company vs.
Woodward, 119 Cal., page 34.) The city Was
subdivided Into districts supplied exclusively
by one company, and from which all other
companies were barred by the refusal of the
board to grant equal privileges t/ competitors,
who made application In good season, as early
an the 10th day of last April. Bidders were
called upon to supply both gas and electric
light, whereas there was no possible compe
tition except in the matter of electric light.
When, as in the case of San Francisco, mu
nicipalities do not own their own lighting
plant, the only protection of the city and the
consumers is in the fullest and freest competi
tion. The act of 1595 and the Consolidation act
before it have amply provided for this, but you
have, without legal authority and against what
I believe to be the public Interests. Ignored
them; and, if you have done so with an er
roneous idea* of your powers and duties, this
veto, if It is sustained, will give you. an op
portunity to correct your mistake. Respectfully,
JAMES D, PHELAN, Mayor.

HERO OF THE BRIDGE.
Charles Emlay Has Saved Twenty-Seven Lit
tle Fishers From Drowning.
OAKLAND, Oct. B.â With the saving from drowning of Roy Syble,
Charles A. Emlay, the Webster-street bridge tender, has rescued twenty
seven people from watery graves. Emlay has only been fourteen months
in h!s present position, but he has made a splendid record. The Webster
street bridge is the favorite resort of children, who fish In the estuary and
quite frequently they fall from the dolphins, and then Emlay's heroic
work is needed In a hurry.
Among those whom he has saved are Frankie Silva, Clarence Ouster,
A. Rnoney. Fred Thomas, Clyde Hamilton, Roy Syble, Clarence Deming
and John Levy. It is a peculiar fact that although he has dived intd the
estuary whenever a child was in danger, not a single parent has ever
Best him a single word of thanks, much less anything more substantial.
â¢â¢1 wish somebody would tall In some day," said Emlay to-day, "who
would send a/suit of clothes around. I have ruined every suit I have,
and whenever I dress up to go off a few hours, I always hear some one
crying for help. The hardest job I have had was that of Clarence Deming.
Thu boy fell off the furthest dolphin while a strong tide was running,
and I had great difficulty in keeping him up until I could make the foot
of Broadway, which is a long way from the bridge. I once saved John
Levy, who has been bridgetender for seventeen years, and who cannot
.swim. I jump into the estuary every morning, no matter how the
weather is, and no I am always in training to jump when a call comes."
NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
COMPANIES TO BE MUSTERED IN
AS FAST AS ACCEPTED.
Some Important Legislation Is Pro
posed â The Signal Corps Wants
Field Appliances â Naval
Militiamen to RÂ«port.
The work of reorganizing the two regi
ments of the Second Brigade particularly,
and the other brigades generally, is going
on this time In earnest, and the indica
tions are now that within six weeks the
National Guard of California will make
a respectable showing. Last Wednesday
Governor Budd, commander-lfr-chlef, and
Major General Dickinson, division com
mander, who in the absence of Adjutant
General Barrett, now in Washington, D.
C, comprise the board of location, held a
meeting and it was determined to muster
in without delay, on application, such
bodies of men properly qualified for mili
tary duty in the several brigades as may
make application therefor in proper form
and number, not exceeding the number of
companies in the brigade now in the
volunteer service of the United States.
Preference will be given to localities tha;
have furnished companies now in the voi
unteer service.
It was further determined that all ap
plicants for formation of such new com
panies shall be physically examined ac
cording to the United Slates army stand
ard, to which standard they must con
form as well iae to the laws of the State
and National Guard as to age, residence
and other qualifications.
The men who will offer themselves will
have to comply with the rules determined
upon before their applications shall be
considered with a view to mustering
them in. .
lieutenant Colonel Hansen, surgeon of
the staff of Brigadier General Warfleld,
commanding the Second Brigade, has
brpn detailed to make the physical ex
nminntlnn, of the men who will be pre

SENT FREE TO MEN
The State Medical Institute Discovers a
Remarkable Remedy for Lost
Vigor.
ARE SENDING FREE A TRIAL PACKAGE
TO ALL WHO WRITE.
Free samples of a most remarkable
remedy are being distributed by the State
Medical institute. Fort Wayne, Ind. It
cured bo many men who had battled for
year? against -the mental and physical
suffering of lost manhood that the insti-
tute has decided to distribute free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment and all men who suffer with
any form of sexual weaknr resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varlco-
cele, or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy ha.i a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it Is needed
It cures all the ills and troubles that
come from years nf misuse of the natural
functions and has been an absolute suc-
cess in all cases. A request to the State
Medical Institute. 193 First National Bank
Building, Fort Wayne, Ind.. stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will be complied with. The institute
is desirous of reaching that grÂ«at olasÂ»
of men who are unable to leave home to
be treated and the free sample will en-
able them to see how easy it is to be
cured of sexual weakness when the
proper remedies are employed. The In-
stitute makes no restrictions. Any man
who writes will be sent a free sample,
carefully sealed In a plain package so
that its recipient need have no fear of
embarrassment or publicity. Readers axe

probable that he will enter upon the dis
charge of that duty within the next three
or four days. A mustering: officer will
be detailed, but he has not yet been
chosen. The mustering will proceed as
fast as the men are accepted in accord
ance with the suggestion of Major Jan
sen, brigade inspector. Surgeons and
mustering officers for the other brigaded
will shortly be. announced.
At the coming session of the Legis
lature there will be considerable legisla
tion proposed for the advancement of the
Guard and the placing of it on a basis
equal if not superior to any National ]
Guard in' the Union. There will be a
proposition to codify all the laws in re
lation to the Guard #o that it may have
an intelligent text book, the laws of the
several States of the Union being
examined with a view to cull from them
and incorporate in the State laws much
that has been found to be of advantage
in other States.
There will be a proposition to do away !
with the biennial election of officers and I
in lieu thereof men, when -elected, are to
hold during good behavior and : compe
tency and to be retired for age, as in the
regular army. It is argued in favor of
this that the officers will be far more effi
cient than when changed every two years,
as is often the case.
It is proposed to apply for an appropri
ation of about $1000 to secure a field out
fit for the signal corps so that it may
have the same appliances for field work )
that there is for that branch of the ser
vice in the regular army. This will in
clude a wagon with reels of wire for tele
graph service and for telephone service,
gas pipe poles In sections and such ap
paratus as la requisite in the telegraphic
branch of signal work.
An effort will also be made to provide
for the payment of the men when ordered
to a camp of instruction. In the past
men have been ordered to an eight or ten
day camp and the majority of them have,
during that time, had to lose their wages
or salary. It in proposed to have the
Legislature do as is done in Massachu
setts and other States, allow the men $2
per day for every day that they perform
the duties that will be required of them.

A stenographer for a large law firm in Boston had a rather
common experience: "My work," she said, "is very nervous and ex-
acting, and^ I used to leave the office utterly exhausted. At night I
would often have the most horrible dreams, and sometimes wake up in
a cold sweat. Once I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed clutch-
ing the bed clothes frantically with both hands. I became so dis-
heartened that I finally told my employer I must give up my position,
but he laughed, and said he wanted me to stay, and then suggested
that I try his remedy for such troubles. He gave me half a dozen
Ripans Tabules and told me to take one after dinner and another
before going to bed. I did so, and rested better that very night
Now, whenever I feel nervous, I take just one Tabule before retiring
and I sleep right through till morning, and get up thoroughly rested
and ready for business. For a sleep-producer and a auieter of thÂ«
nerves, these Tabules are simply wonderful."
A, held last week. Major Jansen presided.
Lester U. Burnett, first sergeant and
brother of the captain of the troop, was
chosen to nil the vacancy occasioned by
the resignation of Lieutenant Penniman.
At thÂ»> meeting of Companies C and Q
at tlu> Ellts-street armory last week, there
was a great deal of enthusiasm at the
prospect of reorganization. Business was
transacted with much more spirit than,
has been noticed since the departure of
the First Regiment for the front. These
two companies have filed applications to
be admitted under the new order of
things.
Captain L. H. Turner, commanding: the
naval militia, is < enrtned to his home by
an attack of fever and during his absence
Lieutenant C. C. Dennis is In command.

visiting at Salt Lake City.
An order will be issued this week to all
men who were in the auxiliary navy to
return to their respective divisions by tha
time their leave of absence- shall have ex
pired. That will be with the close of the
current month.
CRICKET MATCH OFF.
All-Comers Will Not Play Banks and
Insurance Men at Alameda
To-Day.
The third match of the season, which
was to have been played on the Webster
street ground at Alameda to-day be
tween banks and insurance men and all
comers, â¢will not take place. R.
B. Hogue, captain of the all-comers'
team, has been seriously indisposed dur
ing 1 the week and is still too weak to be
able to play cricket. J. H. Harbour, J.
McLean, A. Price and T. W. G. Wallace
being also not desirous of playing, the
match has been called off.
It is possible that the game may be
played next Sunday, which is an open
date on the schedule of the California
Cricket Association, but the Interest in
the sport seems to have waned so much
that this is hardly likely. The visit of the
Citrus Colony team from Placer County
will revive the crickecerj' enthusiasm for
a few days, as the Placer County men
are strong-" players and the representatives
of the clubs round San Francisco will ba
anxious not be defeated on their own
ground. If. ad set-ms likely, the San
Jose cricketers comt- up to this city to
play thilr match against Placer County,
a good town versus county match could
be urraiiÃfd. With the departure of the
Citrus Colony men for their own homes
cricket for the season of IS9S will be en
tirely over, and nothing more will be
heard of the game until April. 1599.
One More Pioneer Gone.
Death has claimed one more of the old
California pioneers in the person of
James R. Welsh, who for a number of
years was janitor of the old Pioneer
building on Montgomery street. The de
ceased was born ia Aberdeen, Scotland,
teventy-seven years ago and left his na
tive heath when Quite a boy. He ar
ri%ed in California In '49 and, like all of
the pioneers, he tried the mines for a
number of years. Finding but fleeting
luck he came to San Francisco, where he
was a bookkeeper until old age caused
him to retire. On the removal of the of
fice ot the society from Montgomery
street to its present location, he was
placed in charge of th:> old building,
where he remained until about two
months ago, when he was sent to St.
Luke's Hospital. He died there yesterday
from heart trouble.
His funeral will take place from Pioneer
Hall to-morrow forenoon and will be at
tended by the members of the society.

Lrfsadlng men of California who are In a
position to acquire Inside Intelligence re
garding- certain enterprises for the exten
sion of the commerce of the Pacific Coast
assert that arrangements have been per*
fected between the North German Lloyus
Steamship Company and the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe system of. railways for
a through line by rail and steamer from j
New York via San Francisco to Japan j
and China, This steamship company, one j
of the largest In the world, has long con- j
texnplated the establishment of new lines
on the Pacific, but owing to the lack of
desirable railway connections at San
Francisco, wus not in shape to compete
â¢with the O. and O. and Pacific Mail lines,
â which are controlled by the Southern Pa
cific.
The extension of the VaJley road from
Bakersfleld to Los Angeles will give a
through line independent of the Southern
Pacific system from New York to San

to The Call be correct, the enterprise of
the North German Lloyds StÂ«unship
Company and the Santa Fe system will
rive the finishing stroke to the monopoly
of the Southern Pacific.

The Big Combination of Theaters

The great theatrical syndicate which
Ftretchts its tentacles from the far East
to. the far West has at last reached thi3
city. A few days ago Friedlander, Gott

this city, with leases on the Columbia,
Baldwin and California theaters, joined
the great combination of the East.
It seems as if the syndicate were to em
brace every theater in the country. At
present there are only two theatrical com
panies in the country that have refused
to come within the charmed circle. The
latest addition of note is the local cor
poration which controls the three princi

is said that Mr. Oelrichs has been devot
ing his time In San Francisco for several
months in aid of the new enterprise. The
decision to extend the Valley road re
moved the last obstacle to the consum
mation of the gTeat plan of competition.
Many persons supposed that Mr. Oelrichs

that his prolonged pojourn on the Pacific

The buildlns of the Valley road from
Stockton to Bakersileld emancipated the
merchants and farmers of the great San
Joaquin region from the tyranny of the
Southern Pacific. It is not an idle asser
tion to say that the construction of this
competing line did more to relieve the
industrial depression in California than all
the political speeches ever uttered by the

STANFORD IS VICTORIOUS.
The College Men Go Through and Around the Line of the Olympic Football Team
for Four Touchdowns.
Stanford 23, Olympic O.
THE second gridiron battle of the sea
son proved very poor football, with
a score that must make the Olympics
wince and the Stanford men not too
jubilant, although they heaped up a hill
of 23 points. The Olympics were woe
fully debilitated and Stanford was not
abnormally strong. It was not on account
of the very fine playinsr of the college
men, but the very poor work of the club
men.
Were It not for the rows of slouch hat
ted soldiers who filled tne bleachers on
the soutli side of the Held there would
have been a very small crowd to watch
the game yesterday. To them it was a
holiday, and the opportunities to shout
were not lost. Murphy took the fancy of
the bluecoats, and his splendid runs from
one end of the field to the other provoked
the wildest of war whoops from the
bleachers. Burmeister, the cardinal full
back, encircled by a halo of bright red
hair that is a perfect match in shade to
Manager Prltchard's carmine locks, was
the new man of the day, and he showed
up in thoroughly good style. His line
bucking was of the right sort, and his
dash and quickness of getting Into the
play will make him a strong back before
the season is over. Parker and Smith of
Stanford played a steady and gingery
game on the ends. Nothing much can be
said of the Olympics' playing, if nil nisi
bonum is followed as a motto of elocu
tion. They seemed not *n realize that a
football game was in progress. Stanford
went through their line at will for gains
of all denominations and circled the ends,
particularly the right, for stretches of
territory that would make even a Gov
ernment surveyor shake with palsy In
their measurement.
The game began its eccentric career
when Murphy kicked off deep into the
Olympic field. De Ballister, with the ball
dangerously near his own po^ts, fumbled
the pigskin and Smith of Stanford assim
ilated it. Stanford then had but ten yards
to cover for a touchdown, which they
failed to do, however, for when Burmeis
ter was pushed across J:he line Code of
the Olympics appropriated the ball and
all the cardinal got for its pains was a
touchbackâ a point of honor without any
score. Then the ball was taken out to
the 25-yard line and Weldan kicked to
Murphy, who returned vie compliment.
The Olympic? relied on another kick after

Murphy tucked the sphere away under

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1898.
"The syndicate is now composed of
Klaw & Erlanger, Charles Frohman,
Nixon & Zimmerman of Philadelphia,
Washington and Baltimore; Rich &
Harris of Boston and Prledlander, Gottlob
& Co. of San Francisco. Our booking will
be done by Klaw & Erlanger, just as it
has been done in the past year. There is
really no difference in the management
and regulation of things since the new
change. We have been dependent upon
the courtesy of Klaw & Erlanger, and
now they will be obliged to look out for
the Interests of the new member, it is
no different than if we paid them a com
mission for booking. The gain is that
we will have the best of everything that
comes along, and the public will see bet
ter shows. There will be no conP.icts
under the new order of things, such as a
comedy at the Baldwin against a comedy
at the Columbia, or a tragedy against a
tragedy. That will all be obviated as the
big companies which the syndicate con
trols will all be placed so that ava;ety
is obtained, and not conflicting cards of
the same general nature."
VAMPIRES PRACTICE.
The Vampire Association football play
ers met yesterday afternoon on the Gold
en Gate ground for the first practice
game of the season. Only ten men put
in an appearance, among them being G.
T. S. White, captain; J. J. R. Peel, C. P.
Coles, H. Punnett. H. W. Dye, J. D. Rob
ertson, J. McGaw and W. G. Selwood.
After some kicking and running, sides
â were formed and there were two ten
minutes halves of play. Most of the
players, while in fair physical condition,
found the exertion somewhat trying, but
a few weeks' practice will make the
work comparatively easy. Next Satur
day the Vampires play the first match
of "the season at the Presidio against a
team of regulars and volunteers.
The Vampires will play regularly on
the ground at Golden Gate, upon which
goal posts have been set up, the limits
being marked by flags. During the sea
son matches will be played with teams
from Oakland, the Presidio, Keswick and
Placer County. It is proposed to play
at Keswick on Thanksgiving day, and to
have a return match against the Keswlek
team on Washington's birthday. Two or
thiee times during the season matches
will be aranged between the Vampires
and teams of apprentices from British
ships In the harbor.

TROOPS LEAVING ON FURLOUGH
Many Officers and Soldiers Being
Mustered Out.
Numbers of the volunteers are now
leaving the army on furlough and will
soon return home to rejoin their
friends. They will naturally wish to
present a good appearance to their rel
atives, wives and sweethearts, and
they could not do better than pay a
visit before leaving here to Charles
Lyons, the celebrated London tailor.
Lyons has the largest stores and car
ries the largest stock of fine cloths in
the city.
He makes clothes to order at all
prices and has an immense assortment
of suitingrs, from $lv 50, to order. Lyons'
main store and wholesale warehouse is

2"<-yard line and another run for Murphy,
which was followed by a rataplan of
bucks and end runs of tne cardinal team
until Fisher scored the first blood of the
day. Murphy kicked a goal and the score
was 6 to 0. The first half lusted a few
minutes after this and then the whistle
blew.
The second half showed prettier pic
tures of football than the first, albeit the
play was of the most ragged order. Ers
k!ne kioked off for twenty-five yards to
the Stanford twenty-yard line and James
brought the ball up a pace when Fisher
Sizzled along for too many flve-yard
Bpaces to rount. Then Burmeister and
Dole and Fisher again shot through and
around the Olympic line and Dole scored
the second touchdown. Murphy failed at
goal and so the game progressed until
everybody on the Stanford team was
hopeful of scoring a touchdown. Murphy
broke <>ut of a bunch, crossed the field
fur about seventy-five yards, unhindered,
and scored the third touchdown, which he
polished off with a goal. "When the fourth
touchdown was added to the Stanford
score the game looked a little one-sided
and the awful tension that was noticeable
during the earlier part of the play disap
peared suddenly. It was a tension that
usually means murder in Oklahoma.
The Olympic team was weaker than
Di.it of last week and the Stanford eleven
waa a fairly strong one for this time of

TO MT. OLIVET CEMETERY.
Handsome Car Run From the Lines of the San
Francisco and San Mateo Railwau to the
New Burial Ground,
THE first car to be put in operation between the line of the San Fran
cisco and San Mateo electric railway and Mount Olivet Cemetery
passed over the rails yesterday. It is of Pullman color, trimmed and
lettered in g-old. A number or railroad and cemetery directors were
aboard for the trial trip, which extended from the junction of Market
and Steuart streets over the additional 2500 feet of new sidetrack to the
entrance of the cemetery. The party was composed of: James T. Boyd,
George L Center, A. K. Stevens, John V. Hunter, William Warnke, Mr.
Warmbold Mr. McAllister, Samuel Center, John H. Brady, M. C. Waken.
M. C. Waken Jr., George C. Luce, S. W. Powell, George A. Loring, Mr.
McNutt and W. Clayton.
The directors of the Mount Olivet Cemetery say that public favor and
patronage are at last smiling on their efforts to make the new site the
largest and most beautiful burial ground In California. Traveling facili
ties have been, in the past, limited, but the extension of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Electric Company's lines will remove all barriers in this
respect.

diers are now afraid. The trip will bÂ«
made over the Southern Pacific.
The arrival of the transports A alencia

among the men as to what tn>. :>s will
go first. No orders have been Issued by
The victory was a hard earned one,
and was witnessed by a large crowd of
students of both sexes, who yelled and
cheered their representatives. The wear
ers of the cardinal played hard fr< m the
kick-off, and although they repeatedly
had the ball in their opponent's territory,
were only able to score one touchdown
and a safety. In the first half Rice, the
young captain of the Palo Alto contin
gent, suffered injuries and reluctantly
left the game. Frisselle and Carson also
succumbed and gave way to substitutes.
Rooney of Lowell and Geissler of Stan
ford distinguished themselves in the ini
tial hall' by long runs. The second half
was a repetition of the first, both teams
playing hard and fast. Symmes kicked
to the five-yard line, and the ball was
run in ten yards. An end run netted
six yards, and Stanford bucked to the
45-yard line, when it lost the ball on
downs. Lowell was given fifteen yards
on off side play, and Stanford again got
the ball on downs. Geissler was given the
ball and went around the left end twice
for gains of fifteen yards. A number of
bucks brought the pigskin to Lowell's
45-yard line, when it was lost on downs.
Lowell advanced the ball a few yards on
the first play, and then Hooper kicked
into Stanford's territory. Geissler, who
was playing fullback, ran through his
field to Lowell's ten-yard line before
being tackled. Downing was then pushed
over for a touchdown. Geisslor kicked
a pretty goal from near the side lines.
When time was called the ball was in the
center of the field.
The most notable work of the Low
ell team was performed by Symmes,
the right tackle. He repeatedly brok3
through Stanford's line and nailed his
man in his tracks. His tackling nnd
kicking was noticeable. Rooney and Kidd
also did good work. Ellenwood was a
trifle weak at left end, many gains being
made around him. Qeiasler, Downing and
Rudolpne were the cardinal's stars.

Has Invited His Neighbors to Be Cremated in the Same Place Provided They Do Not Bring Brass Bands and Carriages, The Stone Funeral Pyre is Only One of a Group of
Monuments Intended to Harmonize With the Natural Beauties of the Home Site.
JOAQUIN MILLER has just completed the granite pile which will be
his own funeral pyre. "With a poet's generous heart he has published
to the wide world that the pyre is not designed solely for his own cre
mation, but that any one so desiring may make use of it and have his
ashes scattered to the four winds from the same spot. The only restric
tions to this broad invitation are:
"Don't bring a brass band with the corpse," and "Don't come in car
riages."'
The very pertinent reasons for these restrictions you will find in the ao
panying article.
Those who object to cremation and prefer burial may select a plat and
be comfortably interred. The brass band and carriage restrictions hold
good in the case of burial as in the case of cremation.
It may surprise a few friends of the poet to learn that a woman has
already been cremated on the Heights. Some time ago she expressed a
wish to have her ashes scattered on a funeral pyre there. When she died
in Paris the poet sent for her body anl religiously carried out her wishes.
"To the Unknown" carved on a rock is all that tells her story.
This funeral pyre is only part of a harmonious architectural composi
tion that the Poet of the Sierras has designed to connect his place with the
surrounding beauties of nature. The place is composed of gentle undulat
ing slopes. On the one beyond the monument will rise a pyramid to
Moses. Farther on a tower of Robert Browning. The why and wherefore
of these memorials is lucidly explained below by the poet.
Joaquin Miller has just finished
building- his own funeral pyre. It
stands out a bit of gray stone against
the green of the hills and the blue of
the sky. You forget it now and then
driving up the winding road, forget
everything: save the broad expanse of
the bay and the stately sweep of the
hills of San Francisco, a dazzling pic
ture veiled by the sun-filtered foliage
of the trees that dot the way. But a
n turn in the road and it thrusts
itself into the landscape and projects
itself into your thoughts.
'Twelve years ago," said the driver
to me, "Joaquin Miller bought this
land. There was not a tree, not a
shrub on the place then; bare undulat
iiills, scooped out like the hollow
c hand for the house to nestle in.
Now there are trees and flowers and
â¡ pasture lands for the cattle. But
even the cows and chickens are eccen
tric: every one says so!" And the
driver pulls up his speech and his
â  s and I alighted.
I found the "'Poet of the Sierras" ly
ing on a bed covered with furs and
Bkins. Three of the four walls of the
room were studded with photographs
and clippings fr.>m pierodicals. /Over
Gen, Fremont naming the Golden Gate from The Heights, JoaqiaM Filler's Home,
From an original painting.
the fourth wall, at either end hung
two faded curtains with an air of past
elegance still clinging to them. Be
side the bed stood a bureau and a chair.
The floor was bare uf covering.
The "Poet of the Sierras" observed
my puzzled look and said: "When I
first bought this place I had a number
of Portuguese at work here- for me. I
built thorn this chapel for their devo
tii.ii:.". Behind those curtains are the
altars where burned the candles to 'Our
Lady.' I use this for my room now.
The cottage on the right there," and he
indicated a structure near by, "I have
given to Nagvuchi. the Japanese poet.
The cottage on the left my daughter
occupies and the little house on the
slope is mother's."
"The monuments?" Joaquin Miller
looks at me under shaggy brows with
a direct gaze. "Yes, I will tell you
a bout them," he says, finally. "But
first, go talk to the flowers and birds
for an hour and then I'll take you up
there. 1 want to finish some work."
On the stroke of the hour he ap
peared. In to his high-top boots he
had tucked his faded blue trousers.
over a gray lianncl shirt was a tan
colored corduroy velvet vest and in
placeof a belt the ends of a crimson
cloth Ha^h ifiaunted proudly in the
breeze, over his back he had thrown
a bear skin and in his hand he carried
a shotgun. From under his big black
slouch hat es.aped his long, light
brown hair streaked with gray. The
long beard and mustache were entirely
â white.
Why the bearskin? Why the gun,
on such a day. in such a place as this 9
I was asking myself when bang-.' :t
squirrel lay dead in the pathway.
The carrying of the gun wag thus
realistically justified. The crimson
taÃh, the heavy bearskin flung over
the shoulder, the diamond ring, gift of
an Indian prince, gleaming on a little
finger, these oddities seem to fit the
man ax easily and lightly as his years.
THE CALL Sunday Edition
We walked up the shaded avenue
which skirted the hill to the level spot
where the monument stands.
I call this way the 'Bishop's Path,' "
explained the poet. "After Bishop
Taylor of Africa, who pronounced a
benediction here. After I bought this
place the very first thing I did was to
select the spot for this monument. Then
I sent for mother. She does not like
the idea of cremation so close beside
the monument she has picked out as
the spot for her grave. Hush! These
cedar trees are the sentinels that guard
the way to the pyre. Walk slowly and
solemnly."
I fell Into his measured, funereal
pace without a word. In absolute
silence we reached the monument.
Three steps lead up to it. Near by is
a small bowlder on which, dea^i black
against the ash-colored stone, stand
out the words:
"To the Great Unknown."
The stones of the monument are
square-cut and neatly cemented to
gether. Standing on the highest step
I looked down into the crater-like top
of the monument, where will be piled
the wood to reduce the soulless frames
to ashes.
"And you wish to be cremated here?"
I asked.
Joaquin Miller silently and slowly
pointed out across the waters of the
bay toward the beautiful Golden Gate
gleaming in tl;e far distance.
"Yes, in sight of all this beauty," he
answered. "But it is not for myself
alone that I have built this pyre. All
the people in the wide world are wel
come to have their ashes laid to rest
here. All I ask is that they do not
come in carriages. Let the friends
carry the corpse to the funeral pyre.
A carriage is hard on a live man let
alone a corpse. And there are other
ways to get a man to his grave besides
with a brass band. Dead men need
no carriages; very few living men re
quire them. I do not ask that they
be cremated. there are people who
are averse to cremation they can be
buried on this slope. The Vanderbilts
and Mackeys have built beautiful
tombs for themselves. Why cannot a
poor man build a pyre that is not only
for himself, but all others who wish to
come ?
"When I first bought this place there
was a lady here a friend of mine. She,
too, wished to be cremated on this
spot. Later she went to Paris and died
there. I had her remains brought out
here and quietly burned. Her ashes
lie at the foot of this monument for
it was not then finished."
When asked her name the poet rev
erently removed his hat and silently
pointed to the bowlder.
I read my answer there; "To the
Great Unknown."
From the funeral pyre, a monument
as the poet calls it. we walked to the
apex ' the next hill, where stands the
half-completed pyramid to Moses.
"What suggested this?" I asked.
"The law of eternal harmonies. Note'
the shape of the hill and that of tht
pyramid. See how the contour of tht
one suggests the other. I had to build
the pyramid, for ever since I came here
this pyramid-shaped hill has kept say
ing to me, 'Finish me.' The world will
never know, the world will never admit
how much it owes Moses, so to whom
could I more fittingly dedicate the
pyramid?
"On the topmost peak of all I shall
build a round tower to Robert Brown
ing. His poem 'Childe Roland to the
Dark Tower Came!' suggested the idea
of a round tower.
The Czar's Peace Union and
the Anglo-American Alliance.
LONDON, Oct. i. â Great Britain, the country which has always anc
consistently stood for peace, is the one in which the Czar's peace mani
festo has attracted the least attention, favorably or otherwise. In
Paris the mention of the man whose name two years ago was received with
almost worshipful enthusiasm is now treated with contempt, and the pa
pers everywhere refer to the manifesto as the Czar's encyclical. In Englanc
there is no contempt and likewise no enthusiasm for the Czar's peace pro
gramme. The Peace Society has, of course, received the message with de
light, which it has promptly expressed, but the public men who have given
utterance to an opinion on the subject have been for the most part decid
edly unfavorable to England's participation in any such conference as that
proposed by the Czar.
Sir Charles Dilke is the latest of these to give expression of his views
At his house in Sloane street the other day he presented the matter as fol
lows:

peace programme seem dubious, to say
the least.
But of course If such a suggestion as
this were to be made to the world it is
eminently fitting that Russia should
make it. She is the ally of France,
whereas if the manifesto had come from
Germany, whose attitude has more than
suggested it on several occasions, it
might have appeared as hostile to
France; in other words as a plan to
make France acquiesce in Germany's

WHERE ARC THE ASHES OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS?
RUDOLPH CRONAU, o Member of the American historical Association. Who Has Carefully Investigated the Disputed Question, Declares That the Ashes Removed to Havana and Entombed With Such Great Ceremony; Were
Not, Those of the Great Admiral.
FROM Cuba comes the news that
the Spanish authorities are ore
paring to remove the so-called
remains of Christopher Colum
bus from the cathedral of Ha
vana to Spain. .This acain
awakens interest in that oft-discussed
question, "Where are the remains of
Columbus?"
Two cities. Pan Dominsro and Ha
vana, strenuously assert th^ir p
Bion of the mortal remains of the great
verer of the New World. Hot dis
putes have arisen over the subject, and
at different times it really became an
international affair. Having taken an

â 
L 506, at Vaila
flolid, in Spain. A few days before his
departure he expressed -h*- wish to be
buried in Espanola. the island he loved
most. Before this wish could be ful
filled many years passed by. San Do
mingo, the capital of Espanola, had no
place to enshrine the precious ashes.
The cathedral was not yet begun and
v.as not finished till 1540.
Meantime the remains of the gTeat
admiral were deposited at the Chartu
sian Monastery at Sevilla. When Diego,
the son of Columbus, died, in 1526, his
remains were also deposited there, to be
transferred later to San Domingo. Em
peror Charles V had granted permission
that the great chapel of the cathedral
at San Domingo be used as sepulture of
the Columbus family.
At what time the removal of the
ashes of the great admiral and his son
took place we don't know. As the ca
thedral at San Domingo was conse
crated in 1541 it may be that the trans
ference occurred in the same year. We
know that in 1549 the first Archbishop
of San Domingo wrote: "The tomb of
Don Cristobal Colon, which contains his
bones, is much venerated in this cathe
dral." In later documents we hear that
when Sir Francis Drake invaded San
Domingo the Archbishop Francisco Pio
ordered the tombs in the cathedral to
be covered with earth, to prevent their
profanation, "especially that of the old
admiral, which is on the gospel side of
my church and chapel."
Again, in 1653, the Diocesan Synod
states: "The bones of C. Colon are
there in a leaden case in the Presby
tery â¢ â¢ â¢ according to the tradi
tions of the old inhabitants of the is
land." This last sentence, "according
to the traditions," indicates undoubted

ly that the site of the admiral's resting
place had no mark whatever and was
known only by tradition.
When, in I~^2. and again in ITsT. the
celebrated French historian, Moreau de
St. Mery, endeavored to determine the
exact location of the grave, he ex
pressed his disappointment in these el
oquent words: "What a subject for
the reflection of the philosopher!
Scarcely are three hundred years past
since the discovery of the new world
and already we hardly know what are
become of the precious remains of the
sagacious, enterprising and intrepid
discoverer. We see him expressing an
anxious solicitude that his ashes may
se in the capital of the immense is
land which first established the truth
of his opinion with respect to the ex
istence of a western hemisphere; they
are transported hither posterior to the
ruction of the principal edifice,
the cathedral, and yet â oh supine in
difference for all that is truly noble! â
not a mausoleum, not a monument, not
even an inscription to tell where they
lie!"
A few years after the French writer's
visit, in 1795, Spain was compelled by
the treaty of Basle to cede San Do
mingo to France. The Duke ofÂ«Vera
gua, a descendant of the Columbus
family, now remembered the ashes of
the great admiral. Arguing that it
would be unworthy to Spain that the
bones of Its greatest admiral should
rest under a foreign flag, he requested
the removal of the remains to the ca
thedral at Havana. As the treaty of
Ba.sle gave to Spain the right to remove
from San Domingo such property as
she might desire, on December 20, 1795,
the Spanish Lieutenant General Aris
taxabaJ appeared on the island with a
group of distinguished Spaniards in Jhe
cathedral, to receive the remains, un
the right or gospel side of the altar,
where, according to traditions, Christo
pher Culumbus had been laid to rest,
a small vault was found. The official
document Mritten at the same day
states:
"A vault was opened, which is in the
sanctuary on the gospel side, main wall
and piatform of the high altar, one
cubic yard in size, and therein were
found some thin pieces of lead about a
third of a yard wide, showing that there
had been a box of said metal and pieces
of bones, as it were of shin bones or
other parts of some deceased person;
these were collected in a salver, into
which was rilled also the dust, which
from the fragments of some small bones
and its color was seen to belong to that
corpse. The whole was placed in a
gilt leaden case with an iron lock, etc."
After a high mass had been cele
brated with great ceremony, the re
mains were taken to Havana and de
nosited in a niche opened in the wall
of the presbytery of the cathedral.
Later the niche was closed with a slab,
showing an entirely imaginary portrait
of Columbus, and beneath the inscrip
tion in Spanish:
"Oh, remains and image of
the great Culumbus, for a
thousand ages rest secured
in this urn, and in the re
membrance of our nation."
Eighty-one years massed by. Then
the conviction that the ashes of Co
lumbus were at rest in Havana sud
denly was shaken. In the year 1577
some repairs and changes were under
taken in the sanctuary of the cathe
dral at San Domingo. During the prog
ress of this work on the left or epistle
side of the sanctuary a small vault was
discovered containing the remains of a
leaden case with an inscription indicat
ing that the human bones Inclosed by
the casket were those of Don Luis Co
lon, the grandson of Christopher Co
lumbus.
This discovery invited the authorities
c-f the church to extend investigations
the whole ground of the sanctu
ary. On September 9, at the right or
presbytery side, the vault was found
which had been emptied by the Span
iards in 1T95. The next day the space
between that vault and the wall or the
cathedral was sounded and resulted in
the discovery of another somewhat
larger vault, covered by a large, rough
stone slab. After breaking away a
piece of that slab an object could be
seen in the box like a square box.
At this 6tage Archbishop Cocchia,
under whose directions the investiga.
tions had been prosecuted, was nonlied.
and by introducing, his arm into the
opening he discovered that the object
in the vault was a leaden case having
an inscription upon its top. Not al
lowing any one to go further, the Arch
bishop summoned the President and
Cabinet of the Dominican Republic, aÂ»
well as all foreign Consuls and civic
and ecclesiastic dignitaries. In the
presence of this high assemblage the
stone slab was removed, the box taken
out and carefulh- examined. As it
had rested in the absolutely dp' vault
upon two bricks.it proved to be in a state
of fair preservation, but dull in color
and covered by a coating of oxide, un
mistakable indications of old age. The
closed box was nine inches high, six
teen and three-quarters Inches long and
eight and one-half inches wide. The
hinged and overlapping cover had
on Its top an inscription, which
was interpreted to mean "Descu
brldor de la America, primero Almi
rante," that is, "Discoverer of America,
first admiral." On the left side, and
in the front side, of the box the
letter C was engraved, and on the right
side the letter A. They are believed
to be the initials of the words "Chrls
tobal Colon, almirante."
After opening the hinged lid on the
insidf of it another inscription ap
peared, which was interpreted to
mean "Illustre y â¢ esclarecido varon,
Don Cristobal Colon" â "Illustrious and
famous man, Don Christopher Colum
bus."
An examination of the contents of the
box revealed human bones, with thte
exception of a few parts reduced to
dust. Later, during a more careful ex
amination of the bones, among the
mold and dust a bullet of lead, two
small iron screws and a litt!# silver
plate were found. The screws and
corresponding holes in/he silver plate,
as well as in the back of the case,
proved that in former times the silver
plate had been affixed inside of the
case, but had become loosened there-

from. The little plate contained in
scriptions un both sides.
Without doubt both Inscriptions were
intended to give the same idea, but it
seems the author, not satisfied with the
two meager first abbreviations, tried to
give in the second inscription a fuller
expression of his meaning, as if he
would take care that the abbreviations
might be better understood. The mean
ing of the abbreviations is as follows:
"Ultima parte de los restos del pri
mero Almirante Cristobal Colon Des
cubridor" â "Last part of the remains
of Christopher Columbus, Discoverer."
The news of the important discov
ery, which seemed to indicate that the
remains removed in 1795 to Havana
were not those of Christopher Colum
bus, and that his grave had been found
undisturbed, created a great sensatipn
in the scientific world, especially when
Spain, finding that its claim to the true
relics of Columbus was endangered, ac
cused the Archbishop, Cocchia, and the
other dignitaries of the cathedral at
San Domingo of being the "authors and
accomplices of a pious fraud."
Spain stoutly denied that any mis
take could have been made in 1795.
when Lieutenant General Aristazabal
undertook to remove the remains of
Columbus. The Archbishop of San
Domingo, of course, rejected the ac
cusation of fraud with great heat, and
firmly maintained that a mistake had
been made by Aristazabal, and that
only those remains newly discovered
were those of Christopher Columbus.

The result was a hot controversy, last-

doubt.
When, in IS9O, I began to edit a
work about the discovery of America
("Amerika, die Geschlchte seiner Ent
deckung." Lelpsig, 1592) I concluded
to visit. In the Interest of my book, the

tries. Besides. I intended to try to
solve, among other questions, that of
the true resting place of the bones of
Columbus. San Domingo I visited
during December, 1890, and January,
W'l. Highest credentials from the
German Government opened me a wayj
besides, the ecclesiastical and civil au
thorities of San Domingo consented
v that a foreign and entirely dis
interested scholar might Judge upon
their case. Since the discovery of the
remains such an investigation had
never been made nor permitted, as only
a few days after the first investiga
tion the remains, together with their
leadt-n case, had been placed in a glass
case and sealed up with many official
seals of the Government and the
church, as well as of all the foreign
Consuls.
My investigation took place Sunday,
January 11, lSyl, in the cathedral, in the
presence of all the ecclesiastical digni
taries. Consuls and military and civil
officers. After each of them had been*
convinced that his seal, stamped upon
the glass case in 1877, was untouched,
ail seals were broken an<l the leaden
case taken out. My examinations were
continued for several hours. It seemed
to tne the most important object to ob
tain exact copies of all inscriptions to
be found on the casket, as Spanish au
thorities had declared the character of
those inscriptions to be quite modern,
and therefore unmistakable proofs
of imposture. It should be stated,
however, that most of those authori
ties based their opinions upon pc/or and
very inexact copies, which served as
illustrations in one of the first reports
upon the discovery. Those copies I
found differed very much from the orig
inals, and therefore I made with most
scrupulous care the copies, reproduc
tions of which are presented herewith.
The question now arises, Doea the
character of the inscriptions resemble
the writing of the first half of the six
teenth century, the time when the
casket and its inscriptions are sup
posed to have been made? I give here
a few autographs of celebrated Span
iards who lived in the first half of the
sixteenth century. Other autographs
from the same period may be found in
Winsor's "Narrative and Critical His
tory of America." Very easily the
reader may point out every letter of the
casket inscriptions in the autographs
i also. A peculiar shape the letter r has
in the inscriptions upon the top of the
casket. It resembles a modern x. We
find the same x standing for the letter
r in the accompanying reproductions of
the autographs of Francisco Pizarro
and Hernandez de Biedma. It is also
to be found in autographs of Hernando
Cortes. King Ferdinand and others.
A few words about the Inscriptions in
general: When the removal of the re
mains of Christopher Columbus and his
son Diego took place the ashes of both
men were transferred from the original
coffins to two small leaden cases of the
same make. Now, can it be imagined
that the case of such an illustrious man
as the discoverer of the New World had
been left without any visible marks or
inscriptions by means of which mis
takes might be avoided? This thought
must be strongly rejected. It is only
natural that the case In which repose
the remains of the great admiral was
distinguished by fitting inscriptions
which might enable easy identification
also in later centuries. As in no official
document is it stated that the leaden
tablets taken by the Spaniards out of
the vault UÂ» 1795 had any mark or in
scription, it must therefore be regarded
as strongest proof that the tomb emp
tied at that time never inclosed the pre
ri"us ashes of the discoverer of Amer
ica.
Mention should be made of the ball
which was found, together with the
small silver plate, among the mold and
dust in the case. Nobody has hitherto
given great importance to its being
there. But it seems to me that some
weight must be attached to It. Describ
ing the awful hardships of his fourth
and last voyage, Columbus says: "My
wound opened again, and for nine days
all hope was gone to keep me alive."
This shows that Columbus in some
former days was wounded. At what
time this happened we do not know; it
was probably during his earlier voyages
in the Mediterranean Sea or to Guinea.
It may be that during: those adventur
ous trips he received a gunsnot, and
that the ball remained in his body till
his end.
If, as the Spanish authorities would
have us believe, fraud was committed
by the Archbishop of San Domingo,
what reasons could have induced him
to put such a ball into the casket, which
ball, up to my investigations, never
before was brought in any connection
with the above mentioned passage of
Columbus* letter? Furthermore, j what
interest should lead the Archbishop and
the other dignitaries of the cathedral
at San Domingo to commit such grave
fraud, by which neither they nor their
church had any profit?
To sum up. all reasons point most
strongly to the probability that Lieu
tenant General Aristazabal, in 1795.
when he dug for the remains of Chris
topher Columbus, made a mistake and
opened not the vault of the admiral but
that of his son Diego, buried only a few
inches distant ; from his father. The
error of the Spaniards lay in their igno
rance that . there were two vaults close
together, and i that, as Moreau de - St.
Mery only a -few years before â >* had'
stated, "not a mausoleum, not a monu
4
ment, not even an inscription" indi
cated where the true resting place of
Christopher Columbus was.
There is not the slightest reason to
doubt that the remains of the discov
erer of the New World are still at San
Domingo, the place he himself selected
for his last resting place.

visited th< Pacific Coast. There is no record of any other cyclone

es are that it was only a violent hurricane. The
kton storm was only #00 truly a cyclone. A veritable Kansas
twister. Its antics were most strange and in a few instances almott
unbelievable. Its power seemed to be exerted in all direction? and
n-hon it struck a certain dwelling it displayed an explosive force that
k: <>eked the building into kindling wood. The only casualties were to
chickens, dogs and cats. That no human beings were killed seems mi
liOUS.

electric s
tern, a comes for
ward with the claim to '-->!ng
the â¢!â  of Cal
nia. S being the
only city on the Pacific i r vis
ited by a twister from over the
Rockies.
It was not a very big cyclone that
struck Stockton about noon last Sun
day, but what there was of it was of a
most vigorous kind. Everything it
struck it either demolished or injured.
It displayed a most erratic mode of i
progress, and altogether must take '
rank as the strangest meteorological
disturbance of which there is any red?
ofd in the annals of the Pacific Coast.
While the Stockton cyclone only
caused damage to the extent of a few I
thousand dollars, it is almost inex- I
plicable why it came to this part of
the world at all. Cyclones, the ter
rible visitants of the Mississippi Val- j
ley, have no place in the weather zone ,
of sunny California. They do not be- ;
long here.
The fact that little damage to prop
erty resulted from the cyclone's visit
must be accredited to good luck. Had
It traveled a mile or so west from
â where it did it would have cut a
â wide swath of destruction and death j
through the residence portion of
Stockton. As it was it merely swept |
its course over a vast area of farming'
land and removed buildings, trees and
such other objects as happened to lie in
its path. A few dogs, cats > .1 chickens
were killed, and a horse was injured,
but there were no casualties to human
beings. This in itself seems miracu
lous when all the other facts are con
sidered. ,
The path of the cyclone was about |
200 feet in width and it spent its course j
over about four miles. It came i rom
the northwest and took a general di- â¢
rection toward the southeast, although j.
its path was most erratic and in one;
instance at least it doubled on its own
track. This one instance would set
beyond dispute any doubt as to the :
possibility of the twister being a true
cyclone.
While the people in the center of
Stockton did not feel the least disturb
ance, except a heavy rain, the people
near enough to know what was hap
pening went through a reign of ter
ror. Women screamed and men were
frightened. All felt their utter help

Then came the rumble of distant

Then it war that those who happened

and for a moment the thought came
that it was merely a fantastic cloud
format ion.
In a few moments, though, all doubt i
of its character was removed. The iun
nei-shaped cloud began to turn and
then to leap. It rose high in the air
and came down with a reaching mo
tion. After it had risen and fallen a
few times, all the time coming nearer,
spectators saw that its trail was
with all sorts of flying debris. It
was t^i^n that terror seized them, and

The iron bulldi ig trembled from end
to end. and the terror-stricken men on
the Inside thought that their end had
come. But the cyclone contented itself j
with lifting off only a corner of the Irc-n ,
roof. The steel rivets were, snapped
like matches, and as the roof went
whirling through th.- air it emitted a'
sound like the Bcreeehing of a steam
whistle.
After finishing its work at the Am
brust vineyard the cyclone moved in a
sf.-uthnnsterly direction, apparently]
stopping here and there to do some ;
â damage, until ii reached the suburbs
of Fair Oaks, where it melted away 1
and left the air delightfully cool.
The cyclone demolished every struc
ture in its path that it struckâ a dozen
chicken houses, any number of small
sheds, about twenty windmills and one
small .dwelling.- The latter house was
simply reduced to kindling wood. For
tunately there was no one at home dur
ing the fury of the storm.
Along the cyclone's course was left an
array of the strangest freaks. of storm
fury that any man ever saw. There
were" traces of the most grotesque hap
penings and almost unbelievable Bigns
of thÂ« eccentricity of the cyclone's path
of motion.
Near the West vineyard stood an I
enormous windmill, its wheel being I
about 75 feet above the ground. The!
cyclone picked up the wheel, broke it i
from its fastenings and carried it about!
200 feet, depositing it uninjured against!
a barn. The tower, on which it bad
been placed showed no signs of having i
been even touched by the cyclone. \
. At the Broschi place there were three i
small buildings and a dwelling house |
all in a line just in the storm's path. i
On one side, about 150 feet from them,
was a windmill. The cyclone in its
course first struck a barn that was at
one end of the row of buildings. Then
it swept to the right and turned, over
a windmill. Instead of continuing on
that course it turned, describing a
rmall circle, and came back, demolish
ing a chicken, house, leaving the dwell
ing and a email shed uninjured. At,

the Broschi place everything the storm
touched was carried away.
A few hundred feet further along its
course the cyclone Btruck a windbreak
of trees with a collection of chicken
houses and small sheds on the inside.
Naturally it would be supposed that the
trees would Buffer as much as the build
ings. Such was not the case. The
cyclone jumped over the trees, went in
side the incloÃure and reduced the
chicken houses to kindling wood, killing
all the birds as well as a doe: ;:nd a cat,
and continued on Its course leaving the
windbreak uninjured.
Just after leaving this place the
cyclone's path lay across an almost
bare field. Here it cleaned off the stub
ble and weeds as if a reapc. had passed
over them. It then struck an old tree
standing alone and stripped off all the
limbs by pressing them down and piling
them around the bottom of the trunk.
This was one of the most grotesque
eights to be found along the cyclone's
path and it is impossible to conceive of
the complexity of the forces that caused
It. The tree trunk stands up like a pole
with its limbs and leaves littering the
ground about it.
A horse belonging to Simon Moore
was unfortunate enough to stand in the
cyclone's way. He was so badly fright
ened and bruised that hiÂ» hasn't yet
been able to realize what struck him.
First his hind legs were seized, then he
was lifted bodily off the ground and
turned over in the air several times.
He kicked in all directions, but all to
no purp ise, for the cyclone carried him
about 200 feet and then dropped him
down in a Leap. No bones were broken,
but the horse will not be able to work
for several weeks so badly bruised
is he.
At a vineyard close to the edge of
Stockton several hundred empty
fruit boxes were nicely piled up.
These were seized in a bunch and
lifted high in the air. After being car
ried several hundred yards they were
dropped to the ground, where the back

OFFICIAL FORECASTER HAMMOND'S EXPLANATION OF
THE CYCLONE.
THE causes which led to the groat atmospheric disturbances near
Stockton were of the usual kind that produce such phenomena in
other parts of the country. On Saturday night the storm center
was on the coast of Oregon and I sent a rain warning up to Stockton.
There was a good deal of shifting of atmosphere and evidently great dif
ference in the temperature of the different strata.
The electrical features that are the usual accompaniment of violent
atmospheric disturbances are not sÂ« easy to explain, but the generally
accepted theory in that in some manner a layer of cold air gets on top
of the underlying layer of hot air. A mountain range In between the two
wind currents could cause this. The hot air naturally attempts to rise
and finds a hole through the layer of cold air through which it rushes.
This causes the rush and swirl of the funnei-shiped cloud. The moisture
<if the warm air coining in contact with the cold air causes the hail
that is the usual accompaniment of these disturbances. While the hot
air is rushing up the storm is traveling at its highest speed and the
mnibination of all does the work.
It would be a difficult matter to tell at just what points the storm of
last Sunday generated. But the points are all there and no doubt could
be worked "lit to an accuracy. As usual it was the southeast quadrant
of the storm center. â¢
But why do people call these storms "qycloies?" They are "torna
dos." The cyclone is th.' heavy storm of long duration that travels in
a circle. These short, terrible twisters that they have in Kansas and
through the Mississippi Valley are tornados. The difference in the two
words is very great and people should learn to use them properly. The
Btorm at Stockton last Sunday was a tornado ai there is no particular
reason why such disturbances should not be plentiful here. It is
largely luck and chance that there have been none since the State has
b?en inhabited by Americans. If the conditions ,come about they will be
Just as plentiful here as iv Kansas.

These are only part of the queer an
tics played by the cyclone. Almost
every hour for several days after the
occurrence something new turned up
just as unbelievable as any previously
found.
Of all the people who saw the cy
clone and Btood by helpless while It
raged, John Borsoi's experience was
the most thrilling-. He is not ashamed
to Bay that h.p was almost frightened
to 'teath, and the effects of the shock
to his nervous system will not pass
away for many days.
"When I first .saw the black cloud
coming up." said Mr. Borsol "I did
not know what to make of it. You see
I was not born in this country and I
never heard of cyclones.
"All morning it had been so hot and
Close that I almost fell sick. There
was no air in the house and T came
out to sit on the woodpile and was
watching the sky. I could see the
clouds moving every way, and was
surprised they moved so fast.
"While I was watching the sky I
suddenly saw it begin to grow dark,
all the bright, white clouds suddenly
disappeared and the sky became misty.
Even while I was looking the sky got
almost black. Then came a roll of
thunder, and I thought we would have
some rain. Then I saw a greenish light
come and spread over the trees down
by the Calaveras.
" "I must go into the house or I'll get
wet,' I said to myself. Just as I started

nel-shaped cloud. The top part was as
black as ink. and the lower part was
turning round and round like light
ning. Now it bounded up in the air
and then came down.
"To say that I was frightened does
not describe it. I was simply stupe
fied with fear, and stood rooted to the
.spot. Perspiration broke out all over
me and I could not move if it had

simply looked and looked and heard

TAKING A TENNESSEE
SOLDIER WAY BACK HOME.
Eventful experience of a Red Cross nurse, who took a sick private from a San
Francisco hospital back to his folks in the Tennessee Mountains.
MISS NELLIE CLOSE, a Red
Cross nurse in St. Luke's Hos
pital, has just returned from
accompanying a sick soldier
back to the wilds of Tennessee,
and a very exciting time she had of it,
according to her own story.
When the soldiers from near and far
began to gather here in San Francisco
St. Luke's, together with the German
and French hospitals and nearly all
kindred establishments irr the city,
opened its doors to as many of the boys
in blue as it could accommodate out
side of its regular patients. These
'â¢camp capo's" came from nearly all
parts of the country and were of all
grades of refinement, education and
personal charm.
Amhng these beneficiaries of St.
Luke's was one young fellowâ a boy of
only twenty yearsâ who after a severe
and well-nigh fatal attack of pleuro
pneumonia exhibited no positive signs
of return to health. The disease had
run its course, leaving him but a
shadow of his former self, but he
seemed to have reached a stationary
stage in his convalescence which was
as likely to lead back to illness as for
ward to complete recovery. To add to
the difficulty of his case the young sol
dier was a constant sufferer from acute
nostalgia (homesickness).
After a six weeks' stay in the hospital
It was plainly seen by the attendant
physicians that there was absolutely no
hope of his recovery in this climate
even if his longing for home had not
been so overmastering as it was. It
was abpolutel:' necessary that he
should go back to his people, but how
to send him there was the puzzle, since
he needed care and attention that could
be by no means given him by unskilled
hands. In this dilemma Miss Close
came" to the front with an offer of her
"ratuitous services during the time
necessary to accompany the boy home
and return to her hospital work.
The permission of the hospital au
thorities being secured Miss Close
started promptly forth on ncr mission
of mercy and has Just returned to her
regular duties. Her story of the trip
is interesting from many points of view.
"Through the kindness of tho rail
road people," she said, "I was furnished

I with dust and felt a breath of afr as
cold as if it had just come from the
! north pole. Then torrents of rain and
several hailstones fell around me, the
wind moaned a bit and it was all over.
"I could see the storm as it moved
off, tearing down haystacks and up
setting windmills. The air was very
cold for some minutes and I went into
the house to get warm. But I was
more than cold â I was sick â and it
took me several hours to recover from
' my fright with a cyclone's tail."
home. Sam stood the trip pretty well,
though I had to be in attendance upon
him night and day and snatched my
own rest as I could, which, together
with the oppressive heat, made it a
little hard for me.
"It was wonderful the power that the
Red Cross on my sleeve had over all
whom we met. Every one from the
train boys up to the occupants of pri- j
vate cars tried to help us along and I
make the way pleasant for us. Noth
ing that could be done by any one was
lacking to our comfort and Sam was
the pet of the entire train the journey
through.
"We arrived in Jonesboro in the
middle of the afternoon, and Sam. who
had not thought of such things pre
viously, suddenly made up his mind
that he must not return to his home
empty handed, but must buy his
mother a 'dress pattern' in one of the
stores. No sooner were we started out
on our shopping expedition than the
news of our arrival was spread through
the town and the store which we en
t- red was soon full of people pushing
and crowding with each other to see
the 'Red Cross woman' and the soldier.
Many came from other motives than
curiosity, for they had relatives or
friends in the Tennessee regiment and
took it for granted that I was personal
ly acquainted with every one under
Colonel Smith's command and could
give news <>f them at first hand. It was
hard to disappoint them and see them
go away in n-ars, but I tried to make
as good a story out of the little that I
kiyw of the regiment as I could and
convince them that it was not care
lessness nor indifference on my part
but sheer inability to attend to my hos
pital duties and learn all about the
Tennessee boys as individuals which
made rue come without a special mes
sage for every one of them.
"That following four hours and a
half ride out to Hawes' Crossroads â
Sam's horne â I shall never forget. We
went in a surrey with two horses and
a small darky driver, and started so
late that darkness overtook us before I
we accomplished half the distance. The !
road, because of the heavy summer
rains, was the worst I ever rode over.
There were creeks to cross where the
water came up within an inch or so of
the floor of the carriage, and the road
was full of deep gullies and rocks
washed down from the hills. There
was no moon, and I exnected to be
overturned or drowned almost any
minute, but at last we got into Sam's
'neighborhood,' that is, within six '
t
Crushed a House Flat.
miles or so of his home, and then I
forgot my worries in the novelty of the
welcome he received. It was nearly 9
o'clock by this time and every one in
the ranch houses that we passed was in
bed, but Sam halloed lustily at every
door and out of it almost instantly
would tumble one or more unkempt
men, who would rush up to the wagon
with a 'Howdy. Sam?' and a volley of
questions which Sam tried vainly to
answer.
"They were all tremendously glad to
see him and they evinced it by forming
themselves into an impromptu body
guard and walking along with us. By
the time we reached Sam's home we
had an escort of about forty men, many
of them bareheaded and barefooted, as
rough a looking crowd as one could
well imagine â though their only weap
ons were watermelons, with which, be
ing eager to do something to show their
hospitable .feelings, nearly every one
had loaded* himself in order to have a
watermelon feast on our arrival at the
end of our ride.
"I found Sam's he/me to be a little
whitewashed hou.se of three rooms,
with a log kitchen outside. In thi3
abode were Sam's father and mother,
three married sons and their â¢wives,
two unmarried sons, three daughters,
and s^ven children under four years of
age. They were all wildly glad to see
us and Sam's meeting with his mother
was worth the whale trip to me.
"Sam held a regular reception until
nearly midnight and the whole neigh
borhood turned out in his honor and sat
around eating watermelon and listening
to his stories of the wonders of San
Francisco. The tales he told them were
something dreadful to hear, for he â
having spent most of his spare time in
the Park and the Chutes before his ill
ness â talked mostly of the animals that
he saw and fully convinced them that
buffaloes and elks and bears and pea
cocks and monkeys and lions roved the
streets at will here, and that our man
ners and customs are so-mething simply
astonishing. You must understand, of
course, that Sam himself can neither
read nor write, and that all his impres
sions are gained from what he sees and
hears, and such impressions passed on
to others become nothing short of as
tounding, especially, as in this case,
when the recipientr, are quite as igno
rant as he who gives the information.
"There were two beds apiece in two
of the rooms and one bed in the other,
and I was given the semi-privacy oÂ£
this shared with a girl of nineteen who
was Jupt up from an attack of typhtrid
fever. I spread the sheets thoughtfully
given me by the Red Cross over the
hard straw mattress and retired. leav
ing Sam still telling his wonderful I
of San Francisco and St. Luke's, where
they gave him clean clothes every day.
I stayed ther^ Â«. week, and Sam
talked the whole time to admiring au
diences, the feminine portion of which
solemnly dipped snuff while the mas
culine portion chewed tobacco. "We
lived on string beans, fried dry salt
pork, watermelons and hot biscuits.
Sam had cried about these same bis
cuits of his mother's at the hospital
and declared that they were the best
things in the world, and he acted up
to it after he got home, but I found
them to be "beaten biscuits." with
which the beater was far too lenient.
They were like baked paste, and I ab
solutely could not eat them at all.
"Everybody was more than kind to
me, and their kindness was accentu
ated by their utter poverty and ignor
ance. It was a poor white neighbor
hood,' and the one negro resident,
Aunt Milly. felt herself far superior to
them all. Not one scrap of
matter ever comes to their houses,
and their only news of the world is
gained from some one like Sam, who
has managed to get away for a time.
It would be heart-breaking were they
not so contented and happy among
themselves. As it is free from
outside influences, they have an hon
est affection for each other which is
remarkable, and share each other's
joys and sorrows in a way which
might be a lesson to many of us who
think ourselves above them.
"My journey home was rather ex
citing, as I went to a friend's in Sa
vannah just in time to encounter a
cyclone which struck that pretty little
city just two hours after my arrival.
The wind blew at the rate of seventy
five miles an hour and did $250,000
worth of damage to the riace during
the short time that it lasted, while it
made me think lonpinsly of San Fran
cisco, where the breeze is chronic in
stead of acute.
"Taken altogether it was a hard
trip, but it is one which I shall n*>ver
regret haviner made."
It is estimated that close upon 100,003

Dr. Jaffa of the University of California Is

She Muttered Some Sort of Formula as the Magic Herbs Began to rew.
PROFESSOR ATWATER. who is in charge of the Govern
ment's food experiments, says we make a fourfold mistake in
our food economy.
1. First, and foremost we use excessive quantities of food.
This" is true not only of the well-to-do but of many people in
moderate circumstances also. Part of the excess which is bought is
thrown away in wastes of the kitchen and the table, so that the in
jury to health from overeating, great as it may be, is doubtless much
less than if all the food we buy were actually eaten.
Not everybody eats too much; indeed, there are some who do not
eat enough for healthful nourishment. But there are those, and their
name is legion, with whom the eating habit is as vicious in its effect
on health as the drinking habit.
2 We purchase needlessly expensive kinds of food. we U3e the
costlier kinds of meat, fish, vegetables and the like, when less expen
sive ones are just as nutritious and when rightly cooked Just as pal
atable Many do this under the impression that there is some pe
culiar virtue "in the dear food materials, and that economy in their
diet is somehow detrimental to their dignity or welfare. And, unfor
tunately, those who are most extravagant in this respect are often
the ones who can least afford it.
3 Our diet is apt to be one-sided. It often does not contain the
different nutritive ingredients in the proper proportions. We consume
relatively too much of the fuel ingredients of foodâ which are
burned In the body and yield head and muscular power. Such are the
fats of meat and butter, the starch which makes up the larger part of
nutritive material of flour, potatoes and sugar, Â»of which such enor
mous quantities are eaten in the United States. Conversely we have
relatively too little of the protein or flesh-forming substances, like
the lean of meat and fish and the gluten of wheat, which make
muscle and sinew and which are the bases of blood, bone and brain.

the world in process of construction at the shipyard of H. M. Bean.
The frame is up and she is rapidly being timbered.
The vessel will be five masted, and is being built for Captain John
G. Crowley of Taunton, Mass. Some idea of her size may be had when it
is stated that she could easily contain the former five masted and now four
masted schooner Governor Ames. The Governor Ames was at the time of
her construction the largest schooner in the world, but this new vessel will
carry over a thousand tons more than she.
She is the heaviest timbered and contains the heaviest material of any
vessel ever built in Maine, and she will be the largest fore and aft vessel
ever built or new building. The dimensions of this massive craft are as
follows- Her keel is 282 feet long; from taffrail io forward knlghtheads on
deck she will measure 318 feet; she will be 44 feet and 4 inches in width, and
21 feet and 6 inches in depth. She will have two whole decks and a four
foot poop, running to one berth aft of forward hatch.
The frame is of Virginia oak, and her planking inside and out will be
of Georgia pine. The cabin will be finished in ash, mahogany, cypress
and sycamore. She will have five Oregon masts, the forward one being
29 inches and the remainder 2S inches in diameter, each 112 feet long, and
the other spars in proportion.

sults of his experimenting during the
pa?t year are now being tabulated. The
data was obtained from the study of
the diet of a training football team,
and the diet of an infant during one
year. This is simply preliminary work
in the wide field designated to be cov
ered.
Dr. Jaffa is looking forward with
much pleasure to the coming dietary
work among the poor. "The only draw
back," he said, "is an inadequate
amount of money to carry the research
to a practical conclusion. Scientific de
ductions must be made in the labora
tory and to conduct these properly wi.ll
require more money than has been ap
propriated.
"By an act of Congress experiment
stations have been established all over
the Union, and provision has likewise
been made for a central bureau in con
nection with the Department of Agri
culture in Washington for the scientific
co-ordination of the work. Professor
Atwater is at the head. The object of
the work is to Investigate the^nutritive
value of foods.
"Since more than half the incomes of
the bread winners of Christendom are
spent and must be spent for their food,
then any information that enables the
laborer to select his food according to
its nutritive value, and to prepare it in
the most advantageous manner, must
result in much saving of his hard
earned money.
"The amount of money that falls to
the share of California from this gen
eral appropriation is necessarily small.
In some States the Legislature has ap
propriated additional sums for the car
rying on of tfie work. In other States
private individuals have assisted by
generous donations. A man's nourish
ment is such an important factor of his
producing power that the subject of
nutrition is of vast and vital import
ance.
"In studying the diet of the poor we
shall find out exactly what kind of nu
triment the people eat, and by compari
son of their actual food consumption
with physiological standards, show how
their diet might be improved."
It has not yet been decided who will
assist Dr. Jaffa in this work, but in all
probability it will be Mr. R. S. Louis
of the chemistry department, who has
made a special study of diets and has
worked on these lines with Dr. Atwater
himself.
Dr. Jaffa will conduct the work in the
same manner as the food experts who
have studied New York slum life, as
applied to the question of food.
These experts have learned from con
stant association that poverty is often
the offspring of ignorance. They have
discovered that the poor are still poorer
because they do not know what sort
of food to buy. Poverty is due to un
wise expenditures rather than to small
ness of income.
The practical work in New York city
was done by Mr. Charles D. Woods, a
food specialist, who is one of Dr. At
water's principal assistants. The great
er part of the study was made in the
lower east side tenements. Persons
GOOD STORIES OF THE ENGLISH COURT.
"When the Queen came to the throne
her first public act was to go in state
to St. fames' Palace to be proclaimed.
She naturally wished to be accom
panied in her state- coach only by the
Duchess of Kent and one of the ladies
of the household; but Lord Albemarle,
who was Master of the Horse, insisted
that he had a right to travel with her
Majesty in the coach, as he had <tione
with William IV. The point was sub
mitted to the Duke of Wellington as a
kind of universal referee in matters of
precedent and usage. His judgment
was delightfully unflattering to the
outraged magnateâ "The Queen can
make you go inside the coach or out
side the coach, or run behind like a
d d tinker's dog.' "
Lord Shaftesbury told the following
story of his uncle. Lord Melbourne:
"When the Queen became engaged to
Prince Albert Bhe wished him to be
made King Consort by act of Parlia
ment, and urged her wish upon the
Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. At
first that sagacious man simply evaded
the point, but when her Majesty in
sisted on a categorical answer, 'I
thought it my duty to be very plain
with her. I said, "For God's sake, let's
hear no more of it, ma'am; for if you
once get the English people into the
way of making kings, you will get
them into th^ way of unmaking
them." "
Very interesting are the anecdotes
which throw a distressingly white light
on the state of society at the close of
the last century, when from all the evi
dancÂ« of notable people who had been
were selected from the tenements as
subjects for the study. The investi
gators spent about a week with each
family.
During this time they carefully re
corded the qualities and quantities of
food eaten at each meal, the prices paid
for It, the weight of the food actually
eaten, and the amount rejected as
waste matter, the percentage of the
various food nutriments contained in
that eaten and wasted, and the age.
nationality, income, occupation, ex
penditure and physical condition of
each member of each family. Separate
accounts were kept of the food eaten
by each person living in the houses as
well as the visitors.
The food bought for each meal was
weighed before being eaten. Every
morsel wasted in the kitchen or left on
plates or dishes was carefully account
ed for after each meal, and when the
weight of this was deducted from that
of the food as originally purchased, the
difference represented that actually
consumed. Samples of all food were
carefully analyzed. The analysis show
ed the proportions, fat and carbohy
drates contained in each food pur
chased. It being known exactly what
weights were consumed, the amount of
nourishment In the food eaten by each
person could readily be learned. Ex
amples of extravagance as a result of
ignorance were found In each family.
For instance, it cost about $31 a month,
or about one dollar a day, for the food
(exclusive of beverages and condi
ments) of a family of five, a father,
mother, two little girls and an infant.
Dietary experiments have shown that
food sufficient to meet the demands of
one j,rown man at moderate work need
cost but from fifteen to twenty cents a
day if proper management be used in
its purchase. At such a rate the poor |
mechanic and his family might have
purchased their food for a very much
smaller expenditure. The childish taste
of the eleven-year-old girl who did
most of the marketing led her to buy
peanuts. Mr. Woods said that, though
unconscious of her wisdom, in buying
the peanuts she did very wisely. Though
difficult to digest, ten cents' worth of
peanuts contained more nutrition than
an equal value of any other food eaten
by this family.
The same criticisms were passed upon
every case studied. The main cause of
poverty in almost all of these was that
weight or bulk was sought in food
rather than nutrient value.
These criticisms passed upon the
food consumed in the slum tenements
apply as well to the average person,
according to the dietary experts. An
ordinary housewife is apt to have more I
knowledge of the actual value of dress
goods or carpets than of food. She
knows little concerning the actual
sources of nourishment which ordinary
food contains. Many valuable lessons
from dietary studies of the prosperous
classes as well as of the poverty
stricken are being learned by Govern
ment experts.
A number of interesting standards
are used in these studies. One is that
of the food required by the average
man. The average woman Is found to
require about eight-tenths; a boy of
14 to 16 years old about the same; a
girl of the same age seven-tenths as
much; a child 10 to 13 six-tenths as
much; a child 6 to 9 one-half as much;
in contact with it Mr. Russell is ob
liged to conclude that "religion was al
most extinct In the highest and lowest
classes of English society."
Here are some quotations from an
unpublished diary of Lord Robert Sey
mour, who was born in 1748 and died
in 1831:
"The Prince of Wales declares there
is not an honest woman in London, ex
cepting Lady Parker and Lady West
moreland, and those are so stupid he
can make nothing of them; they are
scarcely fit to blow their own noses."
"The P. of W. called on Miss Vaneck
last week with two of his Equerries. On
coming into the room he exclaimed:
'I must do it; I must do it!' Mlsh V.
asked him what it was that he was ob
liged to do-, when he winked at St.
Leger and the other accomplice, who
lay'd Miss V. on the Floor, and the P.
positively wipped her. The occasion
of this extraordinary behaviour was
occasioned by a Bett wch I suppose he
had made in one of his mad Fits. The
next day, however, he wrote her a
penitential Letter, and she now receives
him on the same footing as ever."
In these days, and even later, only
sixty years ago, "Hard drinking was
the indispensable accomplishment of a
fine gentleman, and great estates were
constantly changing owners at the
gaming table."
"The scene was the Master's own
dining-room, and the moment that the
ladies had left the room one of the
guests began a most outrageous con
versation. Every one sat flabber
gasted. The Master winced with an
noyance; and then, bending down the
table toward the offender, Â»aid In his

Of protein, called the "body and soul

tritious constituent, a man without
muscular exercise is found to require
100 crams daily, a man doing light mus
cular work 112 grams and a, man doing
moderate muscular work 125 grams.
Mr. Woods summed up his sugges
tions for reforms in the slums of New
York as follows:
It is impossible to lay down any hard
and fast rule which shall govern the pur
chase of food by a family. This must to
a very great extent be governed by the
different local conditions of supply and
demand, by individual peculiarities, and
by the different circumstances surround
ing the family life.
In many families studied no attempt
was made to set the table. The food was
left standing on the bare table and the
different members of the family took
hasty meals when it suited their conve
nience. Such cases should be remedied
by a complete change in the family cus
toms and by the education of the person
who does the marketing, so that more Ju
dicious selections of food will be made
and the tables set.
Throughout all these dietaries there
was shown very little comprehension of
the nutritive value of food purchased, se
lections being made according Wo some
whim of taate, the presence of certain
food materials in the market, or because
the housekeeper had become accus
tomed to purchasing certain foods. The
families spent more than they could really
afford for food, and yet frequently re
ceived insufficient? nourishment.
How these people could have obtained
more nutriment for the money expended,
or even for less, can only be answered in
general terms. In the first place the
cheaper cut of meats for stews and pot
roasts might have replaced almost en
tirely the more expensive steaks and
Some of the Queer Things the Seeresses Guaraotee for Love Charms.
roasts without impairing the nutritive
quality. Then the amount of eggs and
butter might have been reduced to the
minimum amount that would give the
food relish. Eggs at more than sixteen
cents a dozen began to grow expensive
and at twenty-five or thirty cents should
be entirely eliminated if it is desired to
cut off unnecessary expense. The money
saved by the purchase of cheaper meats
and less butter and eggs could be profit
ably expended for flour and other cereals,
bread, rice, beans or potatoes.
One of the best and purest ways to Im
prove the condition of the poor is to give
them practical instruction and object les
sons In the preparation of attractive yet
simple and cheap foods. Unless it can
be demonstrated that the changes pro
posed will give a more attractive
and palatable diet, as well as a cheaper
and more nutritious one, people of the
character of many of those whose dietary
has been studied -will scarcely trouble to
follow any suggestions that may be made
toward cheapening their food and con
fining it to the most nutritious food ma
terials.
From slum workers here who are toil
ing to better the condition of that class
it is learned that the same errors are
committed as in the New York tene
ment districts â namely, weight or bulk
being sought in food rather than nu
trient value, and marketing and pre
paring to poor advantage.
However, not until Dr. Jaffa has
made his investigation can we have any
positive knowledge of the dietary meth
ods of the poor of this city. It will be
interesting to learn whether our poor
display more intelligence In the selec
tion and preparation of food than that
which is shown by the dwellers in the
slums of New York city.

a stroke of genius thus both to termi

without violating the decorum due

"At dinner at Balliol the Master's
guests were discussing the careers of
two Balliol men, the one of whom had
just been made a Judge and the other

'You be hanged," but a Bishop can
say, "You be d d." ' 'Yes,' charac
teristically twittered the Master; 'but

In his collection of repartees Mr.
Russell has many old friends, but all
are good. Here are a few examples:
"Lord Bowen is immortalized by his
emendation to the Judges' address to
the Queen, which had contained the
Heep-like sentence: 'Conscious as we
are of our own unworthiness for the

REDDING, Oct. I.â Miss Alice
Swasey returned from her suitk
mer outing in the wilderness of
the Trinity Mountains with a
reputation of being one of the
best markswomen in the northern part
of the State. Besides squirrels and
pigeons galore, the record of her suc

buck, as seen in the accompanying il
lustration.
In an outing party composed of the
family of ex-Assemblyman D. G. Reid,
now of Redding, and Mrs. A. H. Mar

from Douglas City to North Fork by
wagon, thence by pack train and horse
back by way of Cox's Bar to Corral
Bar. Here, in the wildest portion of
Trinity County, the party went into
camp.
One morning late in August Mrs.
Reid and Mrs. Marshall came in from a
stroll and reported they had seen a
deer on the mountainside.
Dropping her dish-washing task. Miss
Swasey grabbed a heavy rifle and put
off to the mountain. With her sleeves
rolled to her elbows, just as she had
left the dishpan, away she sped, lug
ging a gun whose weight almost
equaled her own.
Not more than half a mile from camp
a spike buck sprang into view. Before
she had time to catch her breath, with
a bound the buck crossed her path in
direct range.
As the deer paused to look back, Miss
Swasey raised the heavy rifle, took
6teady aim and fired. The deer turned
a somersault in the air and fell with a
broken neck.
Later Miss Swasey brought down a

ficance- of the outbreak cannot be over
estimated, for, although apparently but
a provincial uprising. It is the child
play that must soon grow into a man
affair, all of which means the over
throw of the present power. Those who
are at the bottom of the trouble are
members of the young China party,
which during the last few years has
sent emissaries abroad wherever there
an- numbers of Chinese. They have
succeeded most wonderfully in enlist
ing sympathy. This party has sworn
noi only to have a new government and
policy, but new rulers and officials on
every side. To accomplish this young
China has gained the sympathyâ much
of it being paid sympathyâ of the Tai
pings, a great many of whom are in
the Wuchow district. It has been said
at Hongkong and other settlements
that the rising is but a local affair, and
that importance is attached to it only
on the ground that it began in the same
province as the old Taiping rebellion.
There are some, too, who, hearing the
rumors, dismiss them, for they know

Mr. Weiner was at Wuchow on the
memorable Saturday when messengers
arrived, announcing 1 the news that the
rebels were advancing with their ban
ners and the terrible "Black Flag"
waving in the fore. On receipt of this
information, which was mouthed about
the city, all were thrown into a panic.
Bullock carts were at a premium and
long trains laden with goods and val
uables were soon on their way to Can
ton. Boats, Junks and sampans were
hired bj every one who could afford
them, and as" fast as possible th?lr
money and valuables were shipped to
escape t h.- tooting and pillage which

dus, for ho had no desire to be prew nt
at the fall of Wuchow.
"If I had remained another day." he
said, "I might not have been able to
reach here and tell you the tale."
At Canton he found the Chinese au
thorities had taken flight and were
hastily making preparations to repel
the invaders. But Chinese methods are
notoriously behind the times, and the
rebels were allowed to gain a fast hold
on many districts before the authori
ties were prepared and the chance of
nipping the revolution in the bud was
lost.
The authorities purchased 3000 Mau

guns which were sent to Wuchow, but

"Rebellions in China," Mr. Weiner
continued, "generally come to grief

most attention was that of Professor
Tiversidce of the New South Wales
ttoval Society, who found that the sea
water off New South Wales contained
from five-tenths to ten-tenths of a
grain of gold to the ton. or from two to
four cents' worth. Professor Liversidge
estimated the bulk of the oceans of the
world at 307,710,679 cubic miles. He
figured it out that on this basis and

world's oceans held in solution $48,000.

bagatelle compared with all the gold in
the earth's composition and awaiting
prospectors and assayers. It illustrates
the universality of this hard-to-get
metal, which a smart assayer can now
find in almost every brick and cobble-
St-OTIG
S At only three cents a ton the gold in
the waters of San Francisco Bay would
be worth over $328,000,000.
"I find the gold in the ocean water
proper." said Mr. Pack, "only in solu
tion and amounting to about 0.5 of a
grainâ in value about 2 centsâ while
the gold in the San Francisco Bay. is
probably about twice that amount, but
coated corpses after being horribly
mutilated, were cast in the SI Klang
and for days after the people above the
Tower dam gloated their morbid curi
osity by watching the dead drift down

When Mr. Weiner left Canton the in
surgents were pressing forward toward
the city, but it was not thought by Eu
ropeans that they would dare essay its
capture, for the leaders know full well
that such a course would result in for
eign intervention. There is, however,
in Canton much sympathy for the
rebels.
It was in 1644 that the Mings, whom the
present insurgents are endeavoring to
reinstate, were ousted by the Manchu
rians. This revolution began with a
rebellion in the province of Honan and
Shenshl. The rising spread, and in
1645 Peking was captured. The Empe
ror escaped with his daughter, but
finding capture inevitable, stabbed her
r.nd hanged himself. With the capture
of Peking the power of the rebels
waxed very strong and all the impe
rial forces surrendered, save the army
of Manchuria, which was commanded
by a general named Woosankwel. Fail
ing to capture the city, the rebels se
cured the brave general's father, bring
ing him in chains before the walls,
where they threatened to put him to
death by horrible torture unless his son
surrendered. Woosankwel refused and
the old man perished. To avenge his
father's death, Woosankwei made an
alliance with the northern tribes, and
together they defeated the rebels. Af
ter the conquest the Manchurian mon
arch, who had meanwhile joined forces
with the victors, remained in Peking,
where he pronounced himself ruler of
China, thereby founding the present
dynasty against which the rebels of
to-day are fighting.
INSURGENT SOCIETIES
In San Francisco.
EXCITEMENT in San Francisco's
Chinese quarter over the rebell
ion in China is more intense
than has ever before been no
ticeable, even during the periodi
cal highbinder riots. Placards written
on gaudy colored paper are posted in
every conspicuous place, and the usual
ly stoical faces of the Llongols actually
exhibit something like interest in the
more than serious news that is being
tossed about from mouth to ear. The
various "tongs" (secret societies) are
crowded both day and night, and all
the members are anxious to hear some
thing in the way of confirmatory news
of the Emperor's death. At the Con
sulate little can be learned save the
fact that they consider the situation
very serious, but all are convinced that
the death of the Emperor means an
end to the rule of the Manchurian.
The merchants seem more willing
than usual to express opinions on the
grave political condition of China. All
seem to realize that the time has come
Â-v^r, tho noonle are to be heard, and
largely in a finely divided state, only
a portion being in solution.'
This additional value is due to the
gold in its natural or pure state which
floats in infinitesimally small particles
in the water and is mixed with its
muddy elements after having been
borne downward from the gold fields
of the interior valleys by the rivers.
The purely ocean waters of the bay
present only the normal amount of
gold in solution as a bromide, iodide
or chloride of gold.
In the practical process of evapora
tion at salt works the salts of the vari
ous mineral elements crystallize out of
the solution at different periods. The
calcium drops out first and then the
water is drawn off to another vat where
the chloride of sodium or salt crystal
lizes as evaporation proceeds. Before
all the salt has crystallized out of the
solution and before other salts crystal
lize and spoil the salt the solution is
drawn off leaving the pure salt in the
vat. The residue or "bittern" contains
in a highly concentrated solution all
the mineral elements except the cal-
TÂ»)e Black Flags KiU'OS the Remnants of ar> Imperial Eatta;;oQ
oium and sodium. The magnesium
would crystallize next if the process
were continued. The gold which is
present is not discoverable by the or
dinary processes of chemical analysis
and if it is not specially sought, gen
erally by electrolytic process, it es
capes observation.
When the residue or bittern is run
out of the vats in which the salt has
crystallized it ha: been reduced in vol
ume about 100 times. If the original
sea water contained 2 cents' worth of
gold to the ton this residue would con
tain $2 worth to the ton.
The problem set by Mr. Pack is the
invention of a process which will prof
itably recover gold from a solution of
bromide or iodide of gold carrying
values of $2 a ton or a little less. There
will be no element of speculation in the
reduction because the values will be
constant.
No process for getting gold from its
a few sanguine ones are confident that
the fall of the hated northern Tartar
is near at hand, all of which means a
return of the Ching family to tha
throne, or the organization of a
stroneer and more liberal form of gov
ernment. Either change would be con
sidered a distinct gum for the people,
for they all declare themselves tired of
the corruption and misrule of the party
in power. Li Hung Chang is thorough
ly hated by the Chinese of this coun
try, and they have less confidence in
the wisdom of the Dowager Empress.
At the offices of the Ghee Kung Tong
â the simon pure revolutionary society
of this country â the excitement has
about reached the boiling point, and
its members do not hesitate to say that
they think the Emperor has been as
sassinated, and even intimate that the
murder was done by one of their num
ber. They claim to be thoroughly fa~
miliar with the visit of their agent to
Victoria, and say his mission to that
British province is to collect funds, and
aid the Ghee Kung Tong in every pos
sible manner in its attempt to over
throw the present imperial Government
of China. They say that shipments
of arms from the port of Victoria has
been going on for some time, and will
continue so long as it is deemed neces
sary, or they are called to a halt by
the English Government.
Eli Tia Kee, a member of the firm of
Wing Chong Wo & Co., and a very in
telligent man, born in this country but
educated in China, gave his views on
the subject as follows: "'We are very
much in the dark as to what has been
done in China during the last few days.
We all feel that something serious ha 3
happened, but we are unable, so far, to
get anything like satisfactory news
through the regular channels. The
Minister at Washington, in reply to
our telegrams, sa'-^ 'I have not been
officially notified of the Emperor's
death,' and we can't get another word
out of him. We all know that the in
surgents are 1 aking it very lively for
the imperial troops in Southern China,
and from all we can learn through
private correspondence the rebels seem
to have a shade the better of the game.
"Yes, I think every Chinese who has
seen anything of the world would very
willingly take up arms against the
present dynasty. Of course you know
that we do not consider them even
countrymenâ l say we with considera
ble reservation, for I am a native of
Californiaâ but I moan the Chinese peo
ple. The Manchurians are in power,
however, and have been for a few hun
dred years, during which time the
country and its people have been stead
ily deteriorating, and I believe any
change of rulers would be warmly wel
comed. Could we but have something
in the way of a liberal and progressive
government for China, you would see
one of the greatest'booms in trade that
the world has witnessed for many a
year.
"The empire is rich in natural re
sources, and could be made the great
est mining and agricultural country on
earth. Its many rivers offer the cheap
est of all means of transportation. All
that is needed is steam, iron and a lot
of Yankee enterprise to make China a
great commercial power."
bromide, iodide or chloride on an In
dustrial plan and scale as is now done
with its cyanide has ever been sought
until Mr. Pack began.
Most of the silver now produced is
a by-product of copper, lead and gold
mines which are not worked for the
silver.
"To me it is simply a practical busi
ness proposition." said Mr. Pack, "and
I shall experiment as I am abl^ to in
a practical way and without forming
any companies. As a business proposi
tion I now regard this bittern as worth,
from 50 cents to $1 50 a ton. An elec
trolytic method appears to me most
promising."
Almarin B. Paul, the well-known pio
neer mining engineer and writer on
mining themes, was the first to intro
duce the cyanide process En this State
a few years ago and he has given
much study to this subject, which is
kindred to Mr. Pack's problem. In dis
cussing Mr. Pack's idea he said:
"I have read Mr. Pack's article and
I consider his suggestion worthy of
consideration and experiment. If there
is $1 50 worth of gold in the material it
can probably be recovered with profit,
but the discovery of a process is a mat
ter for experiment and probably of loss
in the early I ges of development.
"Everything depends upon how
cheaply gold may be recovered from
its bromide or iodide and upon the
quantity that can be worked at once.
Processes are constantly getting cheap
er. The cost of operating the cyanide
process varies from 50 cents to $3 a ton
according to conditions. A process that
will profitably handle bittern for its
gold' must have a very low cost in
power, labor, time and so on. I regard
Mr. Pack's idea as a practical possi
bility as well as interesting in a scien
tific way."

Ramon Rpyes Lela, who is now in New York. Is the only native of
the Philippines in the United States with the exception of the two dele
gates who ire on their way to present the cla ms of the nattvi before
the Paris Peace Commission. Mr. Lela is a member of a wealthy and in
fluential native family. He was educated in St. Johi â¢ London,
and was for many years- prominent In the business and social 111
Manila. As a result of his interest in th â  revolul â¢ the
natives, h^ was compelled to change his residt States
a few years ago. He is a representative of : ntelHgent and
high-minded Filipinos, :md his remark sting as giving
the views of the people most interesi : hilip
pines. Mr. Lela is at present engaged In writing a history of the islands.
SO much has been written about
the Philippines in a purely de
scriptive way that I presuppose
some knowledge of them.
This article has to deal with a
few of the problems that will soon ask
for solution at the hands, of the con
quering Americans.
I believe America has an unparalleled
opportunityâ an opportunity not only
for wealth and commercial advantage,
but also for humanity and for civiliza
tion.
Though Manila is at present in the
hands of the Americans all the rest.
of Luzon and most of the other islands
are held by the insurgents, who have
also taken lioilo and Cebu, the two
other chief ports. The Peace Com
mission appointed by the President If
to decide, it is said, what is to be done
with the islands. This at least seems
to be the idea of the administration;
but whatever the commission may de
cide, I, as a Filipinoâ with a thorough
knowledge of my countrymen and of
the conditions, assert that the decision
of this commission can in no way af
fect the destiny of the archipelago.
This may seem a strange statement,
but it is nevertheless true. Suppose
that the Americans decide to keep the
islands, which are now virtually theirs
by right of conquest and possessionâ
the natives will receive the exchange
of Spanish tyranny for American lib
erty ail too gladly. There will be no
opposition; for this is the logic of des
tiny and in line with -the trend of
events.
Should, however, the commission de
cide that the Southern Islands shall be
given back to Spain while .Luzon alone
is retained by the United States be
lieve me, this decision will be rendered
impossible by the attitude of the na
tives themselves for the Visayas, the
inhabitants of the Southern islands,
are even more fierce and warlike than
the Tagalos, the natives of the North,
and will surely not brook Spanish mis
rule while their brothers are enjoying
the benefits of American civilization.
Suppose, furthermore, that the commis
sion decides to give S>l the islands back
to Spain, the United States to retain a
coaling station, and to receive indem
nity for losses incurred while in the
Orient?
The money might be paid and the
coaling station would probably be
given up; but the islands can never
again come Into Spanish possession. I
will tell you how I know this. Even
in 1896 the Society of the Katipunan,
founded by the Philippine martyr, Dr.
Rizal, whose sw >m object it was to
drive the Spanish from the
archi; [mbered 300,000 members.
Within thi months this order
has grown trei â  . after
victory over th ared Spaniard
was won by Aguinaldo and his en
thusiastic followers. The back of th->
Spanish power was broken and tho
morale of their army was forever de
stroyed. The natives found that when
equally armed a Filipino was as good
as a Spaniard any day. Thus the
of the insurgents has been
strengthened, and the Katipunan now
numbers 600,000 members, all of whom
have sworn that their country shall be
free from Spanish rule.
This is not commonly known, but it
â  â¢-, and I do not believe that even
I 3 laniards will now be able to
conquer my country and keep it In sub
jection. The Filipinos have tasted the
sweets of liberty and the fruits of vic
tory. They will not and cannot be de
prived (" them.
The Spaniards have broken every
promise that they have ever made and
they can no longer be trusted. Far
different is the feeling toward the
Arre. leans, who are now regarded by
th.? natives as their deliverers from
Spanish bondage. Rut if the Ameri
cans give the islands back to Spain,
they, as well as the Spaniards, will in
cur the eternal hatred of the islanders.
Now this is what the Filipinos want,
and this I know is what they consider
themselves entitled to haye â fact, it
is commonly understood in the islands
that the following has been guaran
teed them by their American allies:
Independence from Spanish rule
shall be proclaimed.
A protectorate shall be established
with a government designated by
the American representatives and
approved by the insurgent leaders.
This government will recognize
such temporary adjustments as may
be made by the American or Euro
pean commissioners.
If a protectorate be established, it
will be of the same kind and nature
as arranged for Cuba.
The ports of the Philippines shall
be opened free to the commerce of
the world.
Precautionary measures shall be
adopted against Chinese immigra
â¢ tion, so as to regulate their competi
tion., with the natives, who at pres
ent suffer severely thereby.
The corrupt judicial system at
present existing in the islands shall
be promptly reformed â such reform
to be intrusted to competent Ameri
can officials.
The complete liberty of speech, of
association and of the press shall
be declared and maintained.
'Religious toleration must be made
general throughout the islands: but
the friars or religious corporations,
of whom there are about 5000, who
I have been a cancer in the body poli
tic, and who have ever ruled the
provinces with an iron hand, de
moralizing the civil administration
and blasting every reform, must be
expelled root arid branch. . . .
The parish priests, whose pres
ence is most necessary and bene
ficial. must remain undisturbed in
the performance of their sacred
calling.
Ihtea'sures conducive to th<-> dis
covery and development of the great
natural resources of the country
rrmsi be adopted and at once en
forced.
The existing obstacles to the
forming of commercial enterprises
and investment of foreign capital
shall be take.n away and encourage
merit shall b* given tc every induS*

The new government shall keep
puMic order and prevent every act
of reprisal against Spaniards.
The development of the public
wealthshall be facilitated, together
â¢with the openin" of roads and road-

the latter. .
No arrest without a Judge's war

. Abolition of the fifteen days' com

The Spanish officials shall be al

These are the reforms that my coun
trymen demand and expect True, all
of this ay not be attained at a
bound; nor is it reasonable to expect
it. but they fee! that they at least have

shall sooner or later be done.

On account of the great . number of

between whom there Is a strong feel

native republic at present would end
in failure. But give us. a Philippine
protectorate and a congress at/Manila,
to which representatives from every
race and from every province can be
sent â so that every Filipino will have
his own representative â and this prob
lem will be on the way to a proper
solution. Let Americans control the
archipelago, and within â¢ twenty-five
years thousands of investors will
flock to the colony, a network of rail
ways will be spread over the principal
islands, and new ports will be opened.
The result will be that the productive- 1
ness of the colorvy will be greatly aug
mented, and its trade with the outside
world v.'Hl be -increased tenfold. At
the same time the natives themselves
will have learned , self-reliance and.

a hearty co-operation on the part of my
countrymen â who will as a rule be
fuund docile and obedient.
It will, however, greatly simplify
matters if some one with tact ami
firmness be appointed governor of the
colony, for there are many petty jeal
- to be overcome â many things to
be avoided.
Furthermore, it is not to be expected
that my countrymen will accept at once
an Occidental civilization and West
ern self-assertiveness in its entirety.
Such acceptance must be gradual, and
will be a work of many years; but if
Americanism â modified by the native
character and by the complex condi
tions of the East â flourish there 'after
being carefully nurtured for a century
the United States will have accomplish
ed a great work for the good of the
world.
I have already spoken of the material
benefits to be derived from American
control, and vet 1 have heard it assert
ed that it will require a standing army
of 25,000 Americans to keep the natives
from murdering each other, and that
this will entail an expense which will
neutralize the commercial profits of the
Americans.
This can in no event be true. Such
an army may be necessary for a year,
but tlie natives themselves will event
ually'form th<- guar<! for civil protec
tion and for defense against foreign as
gTession, and such army can be sup
ported entirely by home taxation. Nor
need such tax be onerous. With an ef
ficient and economic administration the
colony should be self-supporting in five
;ifter the Americans assume en
tire control. Even under the inefficient,
ipt and disastrous Spanish regime
(before the recent revolution had made
a large army necessary) the colony was
administered with but little aid from
the home government.
I would suggest that the American
Government appoint an administrative
advisory council or cabinet of nine
teen, composed of a native trom every
civil province who is conversant with
the conditions there.
Let the provincial governors for the
present also be Americans â not politi
cians, but jurists of ability and renown,
for the office combines Judicial as \v*Â»li
as executive functions, and much re
vision and application of law will be
found necessary, should the ofnce of
provincial governor, as well as that of
representative to the congress, be made
elective, when the natives shall possess
the franchise, which I believe should be
based upon both an educational and
property qualification. The minor
offices should all be filled by natives.
Hy this system the skeleton of the pres
ent government would be maintained
and there would be no violent changes.
A democratic despotismâ if such a
paradox is permissible â is what the col
ony needs before it can be made ready
for all the functions of true democratic
government.
The church should be left alone where
it does not interfere with the functions
of government. I have heard that con
siderable activity has been manifested
by some of the American Protestant
churches, who are getting ready for a
â¢Christian propaganda" among the
"heathen Filipinos."
This activity. 1 think, is entirely un
called for. We are, and profess to be,
Christians, and it is just as nect-ssary
and as logical for American Protest
ants to christianize American Catho
lics as the Catholics of the Philip
pines. Indeed, it is my belief that
Catholicism, with its ritualism and
ous ceremonials, is more suited to
the character of the natives than the
colder forms of Protestant belief,
which have never flourished on Oriental
soil.
The friars should be expelled, for
they are religious corporations that
have no soul and that are unassailable
and irresponsible, but the church, with
its excellent system of parish spiritual
government and Its gentle, refining in
fiuence on the native character, should
'intained Inviolate, though the
- aration between church and state
should be made complete.
I will conclude by saying a few words
about my countrymen. We have had, as
all the world knows, but few opportuni
ties, and yet I challenge any other na
tive colonial race â the people of Java
and of British India not excepted âto

From conversations he had with natives on the subject of cannibalism
Explorer yon Brenner came to the conclusion that except among the very^iow
est and most degraded of the savages with whom he came in contact, canni
balism was caused not so much by the liking for human flesh as by tseae
sire to complete the humiliation and destruction of enemies. Many curiou ?
customs and strange legends are reported by Yon Brenner as the result or
his journeys through a country inhabited by more than 200.000 primitive sav
ages, but there is nothing in all his notes quite so extraordinary asms mtei
view with a cannibal on cannibalismâ the first ever publisneu.
I SET out on my trip to the land of
the Bataks after having secured
by inducements, which to them ap
peared extraordinary, a caravan of
thirty-six carriers. There was but
one European in the party besides my
self. We were conducted by a native
guide from one of the hill tribes, who
was recommended as a thoroughly
trustworthy man, and who indeed
proved invaluable ;is time went on.
Our course lay over the high mountains
which lie a few miles back from the
at Deli, and beyond which is the
land of the Bataks, in which, as far as
I have been able to find, no European
had hitherto set foot For the purpose
of Ingratiating myself with the blacks
I carried a large supply of all kinds of
glass beads, mirrors, knives and vari
ous colored%;loths, especially a sort of
red cloth with gold border, which the
blacks esteem very highly.
The partially civilized tribes that I
came across in the earlier stages of my
journey afforded many opportunities for
iteresting study, and our progress was
therefor." slow, Cor 1 reasoned that the
thoroughly I understood the cuÂ«
toma and ways of thes- people the bet
ter I should be able to understand those
in the wilderness beyond, which was
our ultimate destination.
One peculiar custom, which was na
turally among the first to impress itself
upon me and which apparently prevails
among all the natives of the island, is
the method of preserving the dead. The
body is burned but the head is placed in
a small basket on top of a bamboo pole
as thick as a man's arm, and thatched
over the top with the leaves of the
sugar palm. Here it is left to bleach
and dry and the sight of these ghastly
sign posts w"hich we frequently came
across was anything but reassuring. In
some places the head is not detached,
but the entire body is hung up in a
sort of wicker-work wrapping, suspend
ed between two posts several feet above
the ground, and It is possible to view
through the Interstices in the basket
work the ghastly remains which the
breezes awing to and fro us they would
a hammock, with a most uncanny ef
fect.
Among the natives whom I first en
countered I was an object of mild but
intensely curious interest. It seemed to
give them great delight to gather in
crowds and watch me whenever I went
in bathing. The sight of a man bathing
was not new to them, but it was ap
parently the first time they had ever
seen such a thing as a cake of soap, and
the lather produced by it was a marvel
to all beholders. But it was impossible
to get any of them to try its effects.
The natives laughed at my custom of
eating with a knife and fork, and ex
plained over and over again that it was
much easier to use the fingers.
By using the passport provided by
many gifts of cloths and beads to the
tribal chiefs, my progress was com
paratively easy, until we entered the
territory of one tribe which was at war
with its neighbors. These would not
permit our caravan to pass until the
Impending battle was fought. This gave
me an excellent opportunity to observe
the native manner of carrying on war.
and I watched the battle in company
with the women and children o-f the
tribe, from the top of a neighboring
hill. It was a strange sight, several
thousand naked Malays advancing in
irregular lines, in semicircles, to meet
upon an open plain. Each party had
guns bought from native traders, who
had introduced them from the Dutch
settlements, but they were used almost
as effectively as the Spaniards use
theirs.
The savages advanced with terrific
shouts, trying to frighten their t.-ppo
nents. Each man had loaded his gun
with a tremendous cnarge of powder,
which he fired when he was ready. As
the gun went off he fell howling to the
ground from the "kick" of the heavy
load. This noisy firing, harmful to the
owners of the guns alone, continued for
about half an hour, when a shower
came up and all the combatants
rushed back to their huts for shelter.
The battle was over.
Although the tribe with which I hap
pened to be admitted itself beaten by
the greater noise of the enemy (there
was not a soul killed or wounded), they
returned as if they had been victorious
and gave up the night to singing and
feasting. The battle was to be renewed
next day, so a war dance took place,
but the women, not the warriors, did
the dancing. When the whole tribe had
gathered a middle-aged woman rose
and began to stamp the ground in time
to the rude music of the drum and cala
bash. Her movements became quicker
and quicker, she loosened her hair, her
eyes flashed, she seemed to be a raging
witch. The chief joined the dance for
a few minutes, and as he resumed his
seat three other women dashed forward
and joined the wild dance, shrieking
and jumping as if possessed. Suddenly
the music ceased, the dancers paused,
deathlike stillness prevailed. The lead-
Ing dancer was given a mixture of palm
wine and camphor to refresh her. She
danced again more wildly until she fell
exhausted to the ground, where she lay
repeating visions of victory on the mor
row.
At the village of Lontong I was made
a prisoner, along with my carriers, The
chief had been very friendly when we
first appeared, and we had no means of
knowing why he had made us captives,
but the prospect was very discouraging.
From where I was seated in the native
hut which served a-s a prison, and which
was guarded by two stalwart blacks
armed with j;igge<l w;ir clubs. I could
overhear an earnest discussion going on
among tht- warriors who had gathered
a short distance away.
The guide who was beside me told me
that they were discussing the fate of
their prisoners, and as the babble oZ
conversation went on he interpreted
such remarks as "We must overcome
them while they sleep, slay and eat
them." It is needless to say such a
prospect was sufficient to banish every
thought of sleep. The guide inform
ed me that there were two parties to
the discussion; one wished to kill and
eat us and the other to let us pass. We
had no means of knowing which would
prevail, and we sat all night with our
seven guns loaded and ready for in
stant use. and <>ur pistols by our sides.
There was a tumult in the early morn
ing and we gripped the guns, ready to
sell our lives as dearly as possible.
There were cries of "'The enemy! the
enemy!" and soon it appeared that a
neighboring tribe had attacked the vil
lage, carrying off two of its women.
A little later the chief called to see
me and said: "What if we keep you to
work in our fields for a year or two?"
I answered. "You would not do such a
thing, " and to prove that I did not fear
him, 1 grave the chief a handsome pistol,
which delighted his savage heart and
apparently restored him to the great
est friendliness. Seeing that I had
made an impression. I added: "If you
dare to touch a hair of our heads, our
brothers will come and kill all of you."
The chief immediately declared that he
had no intention of injuring me, that,
in fact, he took me under his protection.
The next tribe that we fell in with
was the one I had come so far to study.
They received me goc-d naturedly be
cause their chief had just overcume the
head of a rival tribe, and they had en
joyed a great feast.
These natives in the interior of Su
matra are, I believe, as degraded can
nibals as ever lived. A man wiU steal

with a sharp, scimiter-like sword, strike
off his head at a single blow. The:: n-
will strip the head of flesh and bury it
on some trail, so that even the friends
of the. dead man will step upon him
and lose his good will in the other
world. Afterward the skull is dug up
and kept as a trophy, the rank of each
prince being fixed according to the
number of skulls he can display.
During my stay I saw one man eat
en. He had been made captive in a
raid against a hostile tribe, and when
I saw him he was bound to a. tree. The
rajah, or chief, first approached the
victim and cut off the flesh from the
inner side of the forearm and the
cheek, two portions esteemed a great
delicacy. The chief drank some of the
blood and then roasted the flesh slight
ly by the fire and ate it. Thereafter'the
rest of the warriors fell upon the victim
and stripped the flesh from his bones,
roasted and ate it.
Generally, cannibalism is an act of
vengeance upon captured enemies, but
among the Popaks the taste for human
flesh has become so much developed
that they often eat harmless slwea and
Old women. A Popak Prince in Pen
ganibatan told me that he had just
given a feast at which eleven Chinese
had been eaten, and he added that they
were very good. This Prince, by name
Si Gallak, was very rich, having his
teeth gilded and wearing a ha sd.swme
jeweled collar, in the center of which
a tooth was set, the tooth of an enemy
whom he had slain and eaten. But he
himself soon fell a victim to his foes.
as evidenced by the skull and half
burned hand which I found some weeks
later in possession of a Batak chief.
Then a conversation took place some
what after this fashion:
"Where did you get that skull and
hand that you carry?"
"They belonged to an enemy who fell
into our hands."
"Did you eat him?"
"Yes. My brother-in-law and his peo
ple ate him. His namn was Si Kemnt Si
Gallak. He had fled from his country.
in which he was rajah, with his brother,
his wife and his mother. He called
himself a wizard, and sought to become
ruler of Pantjo, where my brother-in
law was chief. My brother-in-law de
clared war against him and captured
him."
"Was there a battle?"
"No. We took him prisoner. "We lay
in ambush in the rice fields, and when
we saw him pass through alone we
leaped unon him and brought him to
the rhief."
"And his brother?"
"We shot him at night while he was
asleep. The ball hit him in the right
arm, and he stood up holding a knife
in his left hand; but we were victorious,
for we were many; we knocked him
down and sent his head to the chief.
Don't you call that war."
"What happened to his body?"
"Thatâ we ate it. The head? Our
chief put that in front of Si Kemat that
he might know what to expect."
"Couldn't he ransom himself?"
"Ransom? Impossible; he had to die."
"Didn't he cry?"
"Oh, yes, but that did no good; he
was bound fast."
"And then?"
"We ate him up, of course. The next
day when the sun ceased to rise and
had not begun to set (noon) we brought
Si Kemat out, threw him on the ground
with his face down, and my brother-in
law cu| his head off. He received the
heart and as much of the flesh as he
wanted, and whoever else wanted any
took and roasted it over the flre. What
was left we cooked with pepper and salt
and ate it at home. The large bones
were tied together, and on the follow
ing day we buried his head in the path
so that even his friends should tread
on It and make him their enemy."
"What happened to his wife?"
"I sold her at market for my' brother
in-law. Afterward we ate her too?"

There is a great mass of fiction about
the fatal effects of the breath of a Gila
monster, and any amount of senseless
traditions among- the Indians and old
soldiers of the Southwest concerning
the blighting effects left by the crawl
ing of the reptile over any living plant
or animal. The reptile gets its name
from the Gila River region in Arizona,
where the soldiers stationed at old
Fort Yuraa found hundreds of them
years ago before the war. The Pima,
Apache, Maricopah and Yuma Indians
of the Southwest, who have little fear
of the bite of ._ Mexican centipede or a
rattlesnake, will hunt a Cilia monster
cautiously to its death and will even
go many miles to - i* I the country of one
of these reptiles, which they regard as
the most to be dreaded of anything
that crawls. Among the Cocopahs of
Southern California the tribal belief Is
that the most fearful vengeance that
may come to the spirit bodies of bad
Indians after this iife is to be bitten
by a red Gl-La minister that roams, un
seeji.by mortal eyes, over the adobe
plains waiting to snap at the red
sKinned savages inimical to the great
spirit chief.

One of the few authentic cases of re
covery from the bite of a Gila monster
is that of Walter H. Vail of Phoenix,
Ariz., who is one of the best-known
and wealthiest cattlemen in the Ter
ritory. While Mr. Vail was engaged in
a round-up of his cattle in the Gila
River region o' Arizona in IS9O he took
luncheon one day in a chaparral. He
went to resaddle his horse after the
meal and while picking up a saddle
cloth from the hot earth his hand was
bitten by a Gila monster that had
crawled there a moment before. Of
course Mr. Vail knew instantly that he
was probably a doomed man. His
ranchmen came to his aid at once. The
reptile was killed and the jaws were cut
away from Mr. Vall's hand.
Quicker than it takes to pen these
wolds the man's arm was bound tight
at the elbow to check the flow of blood,
the wound \vas cut open and strong
ammonia was poured in. while very co
pious draughts of whisky were poured
down Mr. Vails throat. He was put
â in a horse and accompanied by his
cowboys roile like mad for fifteen miles
to the home of a pnyslcian in Tucson.
Several brief stops were ma* t > force
more liquor down Mr. Vails throat and
to pour ummonia on the wound in the
hand. For three weeks Mr. Vail lay
almost between life and death at the
home of a physician in Tucson. Phy
sicians were summoned for consulta
tion from PZioenix and even from Los
Angeles, everything that money could
buy or science suggest was done for
the patient. He had a strong, vigorous
tution, and in the course of a few
months he was as well as ever. He is
still in the cattle business in the Ter
ritory. Every one in the Southwest has
heard of the wonderful recovery of
Walter Vail fror the bite of a Gila
monster.
Among the Yuma Indians is a squaw
who was bitten by one of the reptiles
over thirty years ago. What decoction
was given to the woman to save her
life or what the army physician at the
United States garrison there did for the
poor savage is now now known, but she
is pointed out by whites and Indians in
the town of Yuma as the only person
in that locality that ever survived the
; in of the Gila monster. The wo
man's leg which was bitten has shriv
eled away to half the size of the other
leg, and the squaw has been a semi
idiot ever since her accident. For sev
eral years she claimed to be deaf from
the effects of the reptile's venom.
The- period of suffering after a bite by
a Gila monster and before death comes
to a victim's relief is from twenty
minutes to two hours. A surgeon at
Fort Apache says he knows of the case
of a big, strapping Irish private in the
army service who was bitten by a Gila
monster while out hunting one day and
died in five minutes. A teamster who
hauled merchandise to Tombstone in
â as picking up mesquite boughs for
a campflre and unconsciously picked up
a Gila monster with the wood. He was
bitten in the upper arm and died before
his companions could saw the reptile's
h'-ad off and cut the teeth and jaws
from the wound. Where the afflicted
person survives an hour or two after
the bite the agony is described as awful
to witnr-ss.
The venom of the rattlesnake is
somewhat numbing in its first effect,
and after the first half hour is not so
very painful, but the poison of the Gila

this city are doing, all in dead earn

table, in their bedrooms, they will only
have try "press the button" and cun
ning little machines will speak out a
volume of French, German or Spanish

"irregular verb" will vanish.
The charter members of this novel
organization met last week In Dr.
Simpson's office at the Y. M. C. A.
building, and formed what will be
known as the "1900 Club."
The prime object of the club is to
master one or all of these languages
before the Paris exposition in 1900,
which many of the members will at
tend. The graphophone method will be
used to this end, and the system prom
ises to work wonders in the study of
al! foreign tongues.
Charles Freeman Johnson, official
nfr-noKrapher to the Midwinter Exposi
tion, first conceived the idea of organiz
ing such a flub, after ten years' expe
rience in using graphophones. He Is
now organizing "1900 Clubs" in Los An

cities of the East. Nearly 300 young
men and women in this city have en
listed for the work.
The objects of the 1900 Club are:

monster goes through the human sys
tem with lightning rapidity and causes
unspeakable pain and exerueialing
agony from head to foot. The victim
seems to be paralyzed, and yet every
muscle, bone, sinew and particle of
gray matter is keenly alive to intense
pain. The sufferer's head seems as if It
would split open. Very few persons
j bitten by a Gila monster can speak
I after the first fifteen minutes, but un
| consciousness seldom comes until a few
minutes before death. Physicians say
that the poison sets up a tremendous
' action of the heart, and the victim
1 really dies of heart failure. The person
who has been drinking to excess a few
! days or a few hours before he is in
jured by a Gila monster is almost sure
of death in half an hour after the bite.
Many physicians in the Territory say
that" alcoholic stimulants are worse
I than useless for a person hurt by the
reptile, but Walter H. Vail says he
owes his recovery to a prompt use of
whisky and the application of am
monia.
Dr. E. G. Harper, who has been
among the Hualipi Indians in Mexico
for several years in the Interest of
science, says ihÂ° savages there cer
tainly have' a decoction that is a cure,
if administered immediately, for the
bite of the Gila monster found in that
region.
"I have tri"<l to learn from the
Mexican Hualipifl this anti-venom

it can be had. rvnd he will interest him
self to get it for the benefit of the per>

"The most wonderful feat I ever saw
accomplished anywhere," continued Dr.
Harper, "was down on the edge of the
desert wastes in Southern Sonora sev
eral years ago. It was a test of the
power of the anti-venom preparation of
the Hualipis. The chief medicine man
claimed that he was n. wizard, too, and

I dwelt on the peak of Orizaba, came
down and helned him d-fy death from

DIVISION OF AFRICA BY THE GREAT POWERS
Contest Between England and prance for the Rich Table-land of the Interior and What the
European Governments Purpose Doing With the Territories They Have Seized.
LONDON, Sept. 24.â 1t seems only
yesterday that public attention
was centered in Cuba. Then it
shifted to China. Now it Is
fixed on Africa. General Â£it
chener has swept all before him
at Omdurman. Gordon is avenged.
With the masterly hand of a genius
Kitchener has moved persistently for
ward. After Omdurman, he advances
without delay and challenges the
French claims in the lower Soudan. He
orders Marchand and Llotard to evacu
ate Fashoda, bringing the Anglo-
French dispute to a crisis. In the south,
Cecil Rhodes makes the wonderful
claim that he will build a railroad
from Cairo to Cape Town. For the
next fifty years nation building prom
ises to center In "Darkest Africa."
Will the French give way? How will
the European? divide up the continent?
What will the effect be on America?
Can Cecil Rhodes carry out his gigan
tic plan? All these questions suggest
interesting possibilities.
The story of Africa as she is to-day
DIAGRAM SHOWING MOW FRANCE fIND ENGLAND ARE SEIZING POSSESSIONS
IN AFRICA.
The fight for territory is between England and France. In actual area, France holds the most. Her
flag flies over three million square miles, while England's control covers only aoout two millions. But Eng
land makes up in quality her lack of quantity. Roughly speaking, the continent of Africa is divided into
three parts. A great low area In the north; an immense table land extending from the Sahara desert
southward through the continent; the mountainous region along the coast, the passageway to this table land.
The first, the desert of Sahara, is for France; the second, the meat of the continent, is for England; the
thirdâ a sort of rindâ belongs for the most part to Portugal and Germany.
is the oft-repeated story of British i
brains and British pluck; the story of
that greatest element in the Anglo-
Saxon character, its colonizing faculty.
The fight for territory here is between
England and Franceâ and England
wins as she always has won. Look
at the map of Africa. In actual area,
France holds the most. Her flag flies
over three million square miles, while
England's control covers only about
two millions. But England makes up
in quality her lack of quantity. Rough
ly speaking, the continent of Africa is
divided into three parts. A great low
area in the north; an immense table
land extending from the Sahara desert
southward through the continent; th*
mountainous region along the coast,
the passageway to this table land. The
first, the desert of Sahara, is for
France; the second, the meat of the
continent, is for England: the third â
a sort of rind â belongs for the most
part to Portugal and Germany.
The principal rivers, lakes and har
bors belong mostly to England. The
only first-class harbor not under Eng
lish control is Delagoa Bay, under Por
tuguese rule, and on this the British
lion has fixed a craze which means that
he will not be denied. France has the
Upper Niger. Leopold of Belgium holds
a part of the Congo River. England
holds the rest of the navigable water

lakes. The Congo Free State and Qer

on like an English bulldog, and when
I saw that it was dead Iby mai force

the Mexican had become calmer. He

said between the pains that darted from
the wound through his system, 'It will
all be over in an hour.' He know we
had there no antidote for the poison,
and he told me to give his pay to his
wife in Phoenix and to go and tell her
how he had died. In ten /minutes his

but Lake Nyassa, the lakes of Zam

Lake Tchad are controlled by the Gov
ernment at London.
But England has the fertile valley of
the Nile, which, after frightful mis
management by the Egyptians and
years of recuperation by the English,
is now holding its own. She has the
rich country of the Uganda and th^
surrounding provinces of British East
Africa. She has Cape Colony, with it?
farming lands and its ranches. And,
lastly, she has the richest part of that
Golconda of the world, the diamond
and gold fields of South Africa.
There is one more fact about Eng
land's territory and an important one
because it bears directly on the rail
road of Cecil Rhodes' imagination.
The sweeping victory of Kitchener will
not warrant tn calling the Soudan
Egyptian â and therefore British terri
tory. A glance at the map will show
a straight line of England's territory
from Cairo- to Cape Town with but one
break. The waving of the Union Jack
through all those 5000 miles of terri
tory is prevented only by a narrow
strip of 540 miles. That land was

half he was dead. I have sometimes
dreamed J saw all that scene over
again. The Mexicans in Phoenix said
that the fact that it was in the middle
of a long summer when the man was
bitten was what made the poison so
venomous."
Captain B. E. Lewis, recently retired
frnm the United States army, has lived
I seventeen years in Arizona and New
Mexico. "It is an absolute truth," says
he, "that the hiss of a Gila monster is
deadly to some creatures. I would not

fortunately, acting under the Belgian

broken line of English territory to-day
through the center of Africa, from the
Mediterranean to the Cape of Good
Hope. The Congo Free State makes
the single break. Stanley found it.
Belgium has established a protectorate.
Still the obstacle can be overcome.
Leopold is working in entire accord
with England's plans. He has es

will lead to development and civiliza

oped faster than other portions of the
Dark Continent, because it already has
such a splendid start. The district in
cludes Cape Colony, Natal, Bechuana
land, Matabele, Mashonaland and
other smaller provinces. Cape Colony
has been known for centuries. Orig
inally settled by the Dutch and after
ward occupied by the English, there
exists in the colony a strong element
of political friction which sometimes
takes the form of an outbreak. The
temporary setback to Cecil Rhodes in
the elections of last month is but an
other example of tbe pertinacity of the
Dutch. Farther north, the English are
pushing into the vast territory of Rho
desia-
Almost surrounded by the land of
the English and with nearly a half of
their populations composed of that na
tionality are two independent countries,
the Transvaal and the Orange Free
State. That they will hold aloof from
England's control for a number of
years is unquestioned, but that they
will be absorbed finally under a protec
torate seems inevitable.
This then is the condition of the Brit
ish star of empire in South Africa. Sit
uated almost entirely in the temper
ate zone, rich in farming and grazing
lands, containing almost fabulous min
eral wealth waiting to be developed, it
stands to-day England's greatest Afri
can colony.
What progress has Cecil Rhodes made
with his railroads, and does that prog
ress warrant his claim of a railroad,
from Cairo to Cape Town? In EevDt
the railroad has followed the British,
advance. In 1896 It reached Wady Hal
fa, a distance of 800 miles from Cairo.
In 1897 it was pushed forward to Ber
ber, 300 miles more. The capture of
umdurman means the immediate con
tinuation of the railroad to that point.
The necessi ies of a big army, the im
mediate need of occupying in force the
whole of the district, calls for rapid,
construction. The present railroad in
Egypt has been built almost entirely
for military pumoses, and its chief
characteristic is military utility. After
the war has closed, the branches of
commercial value will be advanced on
the foundation already laid down by
the army.
In British East Africa a line has
been planned to run from Mombasa,
on the coast, to Lake Victoria. Already
the first hundred miles have been nnrn
ed and trains are running. The who c
distance to be built is 856 miles, and it
is estimated that less than five years
will be necessary for finishing the
work. Some of the details in the run
ning of the trains are interesting. They
start and return on alternate days. The
journey inland is up grade, and tbe
speed is twelve miles an hour. The
prices are in three classes, the first
being 38 rupees, the second 19. and the
third 3 rupees '5 annas. A feature that
may appeal to Americans is the names
of the stations Chaugamwe. Samburu.
Maji Chumoi. What possibilities for
the intelligent brakeman.
The telegraph is the scout of the
railroad system in Africa â its advance
agent. Along with the iron rail from
Cairo to Capetown runs Rhodes' plan of
a wire line and it will be finished in a
few years.
The end of 1597 marked the first real
step in Cecil Rhodes' plan, when the
railroad was extended northward as far
as Buluwayo. The financial success of
this enterprise has so encouraged
Rhodes that he has petitioned the En
glish Government to guarantee the in
terest on the next section, the line
from Buluwayo to Lake Tanganyika.
This line will proceed northeasterly to
Zumbo, passing through the Sanga
coal fields. Crossing the Zambesi on a
ferry it will pass through Northern
Rhodesia, opening up a new territory
peculiarly fitted by its altitude for
white colonization. Finally, it will
strike the lower end of Lake Tangan
yika. This new portion will cover a
distance of 800 miles and the expense
of building it will be Â£2,500.000. The
guarantee of the Government would
enable the company to obtain the loan
at 3 per cent instead of 5 per cent. As
the line to Buluwayo was a paying one
from the start, there are good rea
sons to believe that the Government
will not lose money by such a guaran
tee.
One *other great factor will shortly
contribute to the development of
Africa. This is long-distance trans
mission of electric power. Already the
waterfalls of the Nile at Assuan have
ben harnessed and power Is being trans
mitted overland to vark.-u. points.

GRAYDON'S DESTROYERS:
THE idea of the Graydon destroyer is the most advanced of all ship
building inventions. These vessels are to have a speed of nearly
fifty miles an hour. They will be equipped with five engines of
the Turbinla type and burn some liquid fuel, such us petroleum.
The wonderful engines are so simple that they require practically
BO attention and can be -started, stopped or reversed from the wheel
house The fuel will be carried in tanks fitted in close to the skin or
the ship The armament that Lieutenant Graydon will put in consists
of four torpedo-throwers and twelve rapid-fire guns. These guns will
be on disappearing carriages, so they can be -housed" below deck when
not In use 4.11 apparatus is to be of the most modern and simple Kind.

A. number of years ago he made some wonderful experiments
at the Presldi,. with an explosive projectile. The new vessels will be
equipped with this and ought to be able to sink any vessel of the same
size and type now afloat.
THE construction of the warships
of the world stands a good chance
of being revolutionized within the
next year.
A London company, with Lieu
tenant James Weir Graydon at the
head, promises to do this for any na
tion in the world that ha? the price to
pay. The company claims that the na
tion that first takes advantage of the
new ideas will have the better of any
other nation. In fact, the better of
several nations should they combine
against it.
How is this wonderful advantage to
be gained?
Principally by increasing the speed
of all classes of war vessels, from tor
pedo-boats to battle-ships. Also by in
creasing the speed endurance and us
ing new styles of guns for throwing ex
plosive projectiles. And lastly, by
Ifying the construction and ma
chinery of the vessels so as to reduce
{fie â  -5 per cent from what is
now paid for a vessel of the same type.
All these things have been figured
out and tested, and the new company
claims that its engines of destri.
will u./su-.y any other vessel of the
sairw size and class in the world.
The new war vessels are the inven
tion of Lieutenant Graydon, who is
â well known on the Pacific Coast. He is
one of the best-known inventors of
army and navy ordnance and machin
ery in the world. As a naval architect
he has a high standing.

This would ena t the new yes-

SHE WALKED ALL AROUND THE CAGE ADMIRING THE PARROTT
THK chief engineer and the third sat at tea on thÂ«
S. S. Curlew In the East India docks. The small
and not over-clean steward having placed every
thing he could think of upon the table, and then
added everything the chief could think of. had
assiduously poured out two cups of tea and with
drawn by request. The two men ate steadily, con
versing between bites and interrupted occasionally
by a hoarse and sepulchral voice, the owner of which be
ing much exercised by the sight of the food asked for it,
prettily at first, and afterward in a way which at least
compelled attention.
That's pretty good for a parrot," said the third criti
cally. "Seems to know what he's saying, 100. No, don t
give it anything. It'll stop if you do."
"There's no pleasure to me in listening to coarse lan
guage," said the chief with dignity.
He absently dipped a piece of bread and butter in the
Third's tea, and losing it, chased it round and round thÂ«
bottom of the cup wiih his finger, the Third regarding the
operation with an interest and emotion which he was at
first unable to miderstand.
"You'd better pour yourself out another cup, he said,
thoughtfully, as he caught the Third's eye.
"I'm going to." said the other dryly.
"The man I bought it of," said the chief, giving the
bird the sop, "said that it was a perfectly respectable par
rot, and wouldn't know a bad word if it heard it. I hardly
like u> f?ive it to my wife now."
"It's no good being too particular." paid the Third,
regarding the other with an ill-concealed grin; "that's the
w>rst of all you young married fellows. Seem to think
your wile has gotto be wrapped up in brown paper. Ten
chances to one she'll be amused."
The chief shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. "I
bought the bird to ne company for her,** ne said slowly,
"she'll be very lonesome without me. Rogers."
"How do you know?" inquired the other.
"She said so," was the reply.
"When you've been married aa long as I have," said
the Third, who, having been married some fifteen years,
felt that their usual positions were somewhat reversed,
"you'll know that, generally .speaking, they're glad to get
rid of you." â¢
"What for?" demanded the chief in a voice that Othello
might have envied.
"Well, you get in the way a bit," said Rogers with
secret enjoyment; "you Bee, you upset the arrangementsâ

As an offset to the modern battle
ship the Graydon Company lays -
stress on its new vessel called the de

three sizes, viz.: the smaller size or 100
tons the medium size of 250 tons and
the larger size of 400 tons, and these
three will cover the uses and supersede
all "torpedo-boats" and "destroyers

Destroyers of whatever size are to

that have developed such enormous

took place in England. The little boat
called the Turbina rolled off a mile in
sixty seconds, but was prevented from

Inthe Graydon vessels this difficulty
has been overcome by usir? liquid fuel,

"No " said the other. "Fact is, Rogers, Ive got an

The engineer took the cage at his door and, not with

with sleepy brown eyes and a docile manner, clapped her
hands with joy. <â¢ ' *. ...

"I bought it to be company for you while I'm away."

was of a highly suspicious and nervous disposition, having
had boys at Its last place, turning with her. After she
had walked round him five times, he got sick of It, and,
in a simple, sailorly fashion, said so.
"O. Jem!" said his wife.
"It's a beautiful talker," said Gannett hastily, "and
It's so clever that it picks up everything it hears, but it'll

"It looks as though it knows what you are saying,"
said his wife. "Just look at it, the artful thing!"
The opportunity was too good to be missed, and in a

Gannett of the miraculous powers with which he had
chosen to endow it.
"But you don't believe It?" said his wife, staring at
him open-mouthed.
"I do," said the engineer firmly.
"But how can it know what I'm doing when I'm

heavier armor can be used. As there
- only one rotary motion there is no
vibration. As they take up very much
space the officers and crew can
live in comfort and have much more
room for working the guns and hand
ling the ammunition. And, lastly, the
construction of the turbine engines is
such that they could not be readily
disabled. A bit of flying shell that
might prove very serious to the crank
and piston engine would not do the
least injury to a turbine engine.
The fact that the turbine engine can
be handled entirely by the man in the
wheeihouse without necessarily signal
ing to the engine-room is an advan
tage almost beyond estimate in an en
gagement.
In order to carry the liquid fuel with
out sacrificing any of the space in the
hold of the vessel, Lieutenant Graydon
has invented a series of tanks attached
to the skin of the ship below the water
line. The space that is usually given
up to coal is to be used as a maga
zine.
The entire interior of the new de-
Btroyers will be fitted with water-tight
compartments on a new system. By
an ingenious arrangement, the man in
the wheelhouse simply by pulling a
level can Instantly close -very com
partment in the vessel. One compart
ment will keep it afio.it.
The armament uf the new vessel is
to consist of four a. -rial tor
throwers. These are Lieutenant
ion's invention, and hurl a torpedo
of dynamite simply by means of the
usual charge of powder. This enables
the torpedo to be thrown with accur
acy just as far as a solid shot. It ex
plodes by concussion. There will also
be twelve rapid fire guns and a few
fifty-pounders.
This heavy armament for a vessel of
bo small a type as the destroyer is to
be used from the upper deck, but all
guns are to be of the disappearing
type and when not in use will be stored
below. This leaves the upper deck
free and clean for running at a high
speed and the guns can be raised to a
firing instantly. The guns can be
hoisted all at once or one at a time, as
the need may arise.
In case there may be use for them
the new destroyers are to be fitted with

* By the morning his anger had evaporated, but the
misgivings remained. He left after breakfast for the Cur
lew, which was to sail In the afternoon, leaving behind
him copious instructions, by following which his wife
would be enabled to come down and see him off w.tn the
minimum exposure of her fatal charms.
Left to herself, Mrs. Gannett dusted the room until,
coming to the parrot's cage she put down the duster and
eyed its occupant curiously. She fancied that she saw
ah evil glitter In the creature's eye, ana the knowing way
in which it drew the film over it was as near an approach
to a wink as a bird could get. .
She was still looking at it when there was a knock
at the door and a bright little woman, rather smartly
dressed, bustled into the room and greeted her effusively.
"I just came to see you. my dear, becnuse I thought a
little outing would do "me good," she said briskly, "and
if you've no objection I'll come down to the docks with
you to see the boat off."
Mrs. Gannett assented readily; It would ease the engi
neer's mind, she thought, if he saw her with a chaperon.
"Nice bird," Bald Mrs. Cluffins, mechanically, bringing
her parasol to the charge.
"Don't do that," said her friend hastily.
"Why not?" said the other.
"Language!" said Mrs. Gannett solemnly.
"Well, I must do something to it," said Mrs. Cluffins
restlessly. Â ,
She held the parasol near the cage ana suddenly opened
it. It was a flaming scarlet, and for the moment the shock
took the parrot's breath away.
"He don't mind that," said Mrs. Gannett.
The parrot, hopping to the farther corner of the bot
tom of his cage, said something feebly; finding that noth
ing dreadful happened he repeated his remark somewhat
more boldly, and, being convinced after all that the appa
rition was quite harmless and that he had displayed his
craven spirit for nothing, hopped back on his perch and
raved wickedly. _; â¢*
"If that was my bird," said Mrs. Cluffins almost as
scarlet as her parasol, "I should wring its neck."
"No, you wouldn't," said Mrs. Gannett solemnly, and
having quieted the bird by throwing a cloth over Its cage,
explained its properties.
"What!" said Mrs. Cluffins. unable to sit still in her
chair. "You mean to tell me that your husband said
that."
Mrs. Gannett nodded. "He's awfully Jealous of me,"
she said with a slight simper.
"I wish he was my husband." said Mrs. Cluffins in
a thin, hard voice. "I wish C. would talk to me like that.
I wish somebody would try and persuade C. to talk to me
like that."
"It shows he's fond of me," said Mrs. Gannett, looking
down. '
Mrs. Clufflns jumped up and snatching the cover off
the cage, endeavored, but in vain, to get the parasol
through the bars. â  r, -v
"And you believe that rubbish," she said scathingly.
"Bah, you wretch." â â *â 
< "I don't believe it." said her friend, taking her gently
away and covering the cage hastily just as the bird was
recovering, "but I let him think I do."
"I calf it an outrage," said Mrs. Clufflns, waving the
parasol wildly, "I never heard of such a thing. I'd like
to give Mr. Gannett a piece of my mind. Just about haif
an-hour of it. He wouldn't be the same man afterwardâ
I'd parrot him."
Mrs. Gannett, soothing her agitated friend as well as
she was able, led her gently to a chair and removed her
bonnet, and finding th&t complete recovery was Impossible
while the parrot remained in the room, took that wonder
working bird outside.
By the time they had reached the docks and boarded
the Curlew, Mrs. Cluffins had quite recovered her spirits
She roamed about the steamer asking questions which
savored more of idle curiosity than a genuine thirst for
knowledge, and was at no pains to conceal her opinion of
those who were unable to furnish her with satisfactory
replies. â 
"I shall think of you every day, Jem," said Mrs. Gan
nett, tenderly.
"I shall think of you every minute/! said the engineer

He sighed gently and gazed in a scandalized fashion
at Mrs Clufllns, who was carrying on a desperate flirta
tion with one of the apprentices.
"She's very Light-hearted," said his wife, following the
direction of his ej es. .
"She is " said Mr. Gannett curtly, as the unconscious
Mrs. Clufflna shortened her parasol and rapped the ap
prentice playfully with the handle.
'â¢She Hems to be on very good terms with Jenkins,
laughing and carrying on. I don't suppose she's ever seen
him before," said the engineer.
"Poor young thing." said Mrs. Cluffina solemnly, as
she came up to them. "Don't you worry, Mr. Gannett.
I'll look aft>-r her and keep her from moping."
"You're very kind. " said the engineer slowly.
"We'll have a jolly time." said Mrs. Clufflns. "I often
â wish my husband was a seafaring man. A wife does have
more freedom, doesn't she?"
â¢â More what?" inquired Mr. Gannett, huskily.
"More freedom." said Mrs. Clufflns, gravely. "I al
ways envy sailors' wives. They can do as they like, rso
husband to look after them for nine or ten months in the
year."
Before the unhappy engineer could put his indignant
thoughts into words there was a warning cry from the
gangway, and, with a hasty farewell, he hurried below.
The visitors went ashore, the gangway was shipped, and
in response to the clang of the telegraph the Curlew
drifted slowly away from the quay and headed for the
swing bridg.; siowly opening in front of her.
The two ladies hurried to the pierhead and watched
the steamer down the river until a bend hid it from view.
Then Mrs Gannett, with a sensation of having lost some
thing. dvÂ«, so her friend assured her, to the want of a
cup of tea, went slowly back to he,r lonely nome.
In the period of grass widowhood which ensued, Mrs.
Cluffins' visits formed almost the sole relief to the bare
monotony of existence. As a companion the parrot was an
utter failure, its language being so irredeemably bad that
it spent most of its time in the spare room with a cloth
over its case wondering when the days were going to
lengthen o bit.
Mrs. Cluffins suggested polling it, but Tier friend re
pelled the suggestion with horror, and refused to entertain
it at any price, even that of the publican at the corner.
whr> had hoard of the bird's command of language and
was bent upon buying it.
"I wonder what that beauty will have to tell your hus
band," said Mrs. Cluffins as they sat together one day
some four months after the Curlew's departure.
"1 should hope that he has forgotten that nonsense,"
said Mrs. Gannett reddening, "he never alludes to it in
his letters."
"Sell it," said Mrs. ClufflnÃ, peremptorily. "It's no good
to you. and Jimson would give anything for it. almost."
Mrs. Gannett shook her head. "The house wouldn't
hold my husband if I did." she remarked with a shiver.
"O.'yes, it would," said Mrs. Cluffins, "you do as I tell
you and a much smaller house than this would hold him.
I told C. to tell Jimson he should have it for five pounds."
"But he mustn't," said her friend in alarm.
"Leave yourself right in my hands." said Mrs. Cluffins,
spreading out two small palms and regarding them com
placently. "It'll be all right. I promise you.
She put her arm around her friend's waist and led her
to the window, talking*earnestly. In five minutes Mrs.
Gannett was wavering, in ten she had given away, and in
fifteen the energetic Mrs. Clufflns was en route for Jim
son's swinging the cage so violently in her excitement that
the parrot was reduced to holding on to Its perch with
claws and bill, and could only think. Mrs. Gannett
â¢watched their progress from the window, and with a
queer look on her face sat down to think out the points
of attack and defense in the approaching affray.
A week later a four-wheeler drove up to the door,
and the engineer, darting upstairs three steps at a time,
dropped an armful of parcels on the floor and caught his
wife in an embrace which would have done credit to a
bear. Mrs. Gannett, for reasons, of which lack of muscle
was only one, responded less ardently.
"Ha! it's good to be home again." said Gannett, sink
ing into an easy chair and pulling his wife on his knee
"And how have you been? Lonely?"
"I got used to it." said Mrs. Gannett softly.
The engineer coughed. "You had the parrot," he re
marked.
"Yes. I had the magic parrot," said Mrs. Gannett.
"How's It getting on?" said her husband, looking
round. "Where is it? 1 '
"Part of it is on the mantelpiece," said Mrs. Gannett,
trying to speak calmly, "part of it is In a bonnet box
upstairs, some of it's in my pocket and here is the re
mainder."
She fumbled in her pocket and placed in his hand a
cheap two-bladed clasp-knife.
"On the mantelpiece?" repeated the engineer, staring
at the knife, "in a bonnet box?"
'Those blue vase?," said his wife.
Mr. Gannett put his hand to his head. If he had heard
aright, one parrot had changed into a pair of blue vases,
a bonnet and a knife. A magic bird with a vengeance
"I sold it." said Mrs. Gannett suddenly.
The engineer's knee stiffened inhospitably, and his
arm dropped from his wife's waist. She rose quietly and
took a chair opposite.
"Sold It!" said Mr. Gannett in awful tones. "Sold my
parrot!"
"I didn't like it. Jem." paid his wife. "I didn't want
that bird watching me. and I did want the vases, and the
bonnet and the lfttle present for you."
Mr. Gannett pitched the little present to the other end
of the room.
"You see it mightn't have told the truth, Jem," con
tinued Mrs. Gannett. "It might have told all sorts of lies

â¢It couldn't lie." shouted the engineer passionately,
rising from his chair and pacing the room. "Its your
guilty conscience that's made a coward of you. How dare
you sell my parrot?"
"Because it wasn't truthful, Jem," Bald his wife, who
was somewhat pale.
"If you were half as truthful you d do," vociferated
the engineer, standing over her. "You, you deceitful
woman."
Mrs. Gannett fumbled in her pocket again, and produc
ing a small handkerchief, applied it delicately to her eyes.
"I â got rid of it for your sake," she stammered. "It
used to tell such lies about you, I couldn't bear to listen
to it."
"About me!" said Mr. Gannett sinking into his seat
and staring at his wife with very natural amazement.
"Tell lies about me. Nonsense. How could it?"
"I suppose It could tell me about you as easily as It
could you about me," said Mrs. Gannett. "There was more
magic in that bird than you thought, Jem. It used to say
shocking things about you; I couldn't bear it."
"Do you think you're talking to a child, or a fool?"
demanded the engineer hotly.
Mrs. Gannett shook her head feebly. She still kept
the handkerchief to her eyes, but allowed a portion to
drop over her mouth.
"I should like to hear some of the lies it told about
me," said the engineer with bitter sarcasm, "if you can re
member them."
"The first lie," said Mrs. Gannett, in a. feeble but ready
voice, "was about the time you were at Genoa. The par
rot said you were at some concert gardens at the upper
end of the town."
One moist eye came mildly from behind the handker
chief just in time to see the engineer stiffen suddenly In
his chair.
I don't suppose there even is such a place," she con
tinued.
"Iâ b'lieve â thereâ ls," said her husband, jerkily. "I've
heard our chaps talk of it."
"But, you haven't been there," said his wife, anxiously.
"Never!" said the engineer with extraordinary vehe
mence.
"That wicked bird said that you grot intoxicated there,"
said Mrs. Gannett, in solemn accents; "that you smashed
a little marble-topped table and knocked down two wait
ers, and that if it hadn't have been for the captain of the
Pursuit, who was' in there, and who got you away, you'd
have been locked up. Wasn't it a wicked bird?''
"Horrible!" said the engineer, huskily.
"I don't suppose there ever was a snip called the Pur
suit," continued Mrs. Gannett.
"Doesn't sound like a ship's name," murmured Mr.
Gannett.
"Well, then a few days later It said tne Curlew was
at Naples."
"I never went ashore all the time we were at Naples,"
remarked the engineer, casually.
"The parrot said you did," said Mrs. Gannett.
"I suppose you'll believe your own lawful husband be
fore that damned bird!" shouted Gannett, starting up.
"Of course I didn't believe it, Jem," said his wife.
"I'm trying to prove to you that the bird was not truthful,
but you're so hard to persuade."
Mr. Gannett took a pipe from his pocxet, and with a
small knife dug. with much severity ana determination, a
hardened plug from the bowl, and blew noisily through the
stem.
"There was a girl kept a fruit stall lust by the harbor "
said Mrs. Gannett, "and on this evening, on the strength
of having bought three-pennyworth of gretn figs, you put
your arm round her waist and tried to kiss her, and her
sweetheart, who was standing close by, tried to stab you.
The parrot said that you were in such a state of terror
that you jumped into the harbor and was nearly
drowned." , â 
Mr. Gannett, having loaded his pipe, lit it slowly and
carefully, and with tidy precision got up and deposited the
match in the fireplace.
"It used to frighten me so with its stories that I hardly
knew what to do with myself," continued Mrs. Gannett,
"when you were at Suez. "
The engineer waved his hand imperiously.
"That's enough." he said stiffly.
"I'm sure I don't want to have to repeat what it told
me about Suez," said his wife. "I thought you'd like to
hear it. that's all." ""
"Not at all."said the engineer, puffing at his pipe.
Not at all."
"But you see why I got rid of the bird, don't you?"
said Mrs. Gannett. "If it had told you untruths about me.
you would have believed them, wouldn't you?"
Mr. Gannett took his pipe from his mouth and took his
wife in his extended arms. "No, my dear," he said broK
enly. "no more than you believed all this stuff about
me."
"And I did quite right to sell it. didn't I, Jem?"
"Quite right." said Mr. Gannett with a great assump
tion of heartiness. "Beet thing to do with It."
"You haven't heard the worst yet," said Mrs. Gannett.
"When you were at Suezâ "
Mr. Gannett consigned Suez to its only rival and
thumping the table with his clenched nst forbade his wife
to mention the word again, and desired her to prepare
supper. * *^

Naples has found out the way to
make the human body Immor-

' The sl n,p.; m,ih. rented here sound
like a romance. Jules erne in his
wildest moments never created any-
thing that seemed more like a dream,
But the facts are vouched for by cmi-
nent scientists, and the Naples phy-
Bician; who for forty years has fought
against decomposition, is shown to
have absolutely triumphed.
The London Lancet, which is the ac-
knowledgt-d exponent of things medical
in the British Isles, and which looks
with a cynical eye upon any one who
has a novelty to propound, vouches for
Dr. Marini. as the following extract
from the pages of its issue of August
20 snows: again the Lancet has
drawn attention the the Lancet has
drawn attention to the ingenuity shovn
by Italian surgeons in immunizing the
dead subject from decomposition and
the theme has acquired fresh Interest
from its recent handling by Signor Lv-
igi Ferrara.
â¢Throughout Italy, whether in its
anatomical museums or in the family
vault* of its cemeteries wonderful
specimens of such successful immuniza-
tion are to be seen, but none of these
can approach the perfection attained
by Dr. EfiSto Marini In a process which
may well be called national.
"For forty years that. Neapolitan sur-
geon has striven to improve on the
methods hitherto in practice, and his
results, as known to the profession,
throw all previous successes Into the
shade. "Without incision'âso lam in-
formedâ injections, simply
with a series of baths, he has succeed-
ed in preserving the human subject
from all risk of decomposition what-
ever.'
"His modus operand! consists of three
stages.
"1. Provisional desl cation (preserva-
tion applied to the corium in its transi-
tion period). Bodies so prepared and
immersed in a liquid of his own devis-
ing may regain their primary freshness
and be thereafter subjected to ana- ;
tomical operations or demonstrations ;
like the ordinary cadaver of the dis
secting room.
"2. Petrification of the body so pre-
paredâa process which, in Dr. Marini's
hands, is so effective that the density
as well as the consistency of marble
is attained, insomuch that a few hours
after the completion of this stage a key
brought in sharp contact with the sur-
face elicits a true metallic ring from the
body.
"3. The restoration to this desiccated '
and petrified subject of the freshness,
the softness, the flexibility and even
the complexion of the natural state. As !

Marini is most proud.
His process keeps the bodies perma

They look as if they had been hypno
tized or were asleep. One expects them
to move at any moment,
The hands are as soft and flexible as
if life were present; the flesh yields to
the touch. Veins, arteries, muscles

so natural that the absence of life is
startling.
When you lift the hand of a "Marin

light it is seen to be of a transparent
pink. In the case of a woman all the
delicate tints are there, changing in
depth until the nails are reached The
skin has the softness of that of a
little child, and Instead of suggesting a
deathbed or a tomb the human clay
awakes feelings of sympathy.
Signor Ferrara says that in looking
at the foot of a woman that had been
"Marinized" he saw that it had the
whiteness of marble. Instead of think
ing of the grave his thoughts dwelt
upon its beauty, and he wondered how
often that foot had whirled in the
rhythmic waltz and how many men had
admired the ankle when they saw it
peeping out of a dainty shoe.

One point that is noteworthy about (
the process is shown by this experi- i
ment. The hands of a woman suffer
ing from dropsy were "Marlnized."
They kept their enlarged morbid char
acteristics.
The value of the application of what
may be termed the "life-like" process is :
evident in medical jurisprudence.
Bodies that are not identified may be
preserved indefinitely. In case of a
murder the corpse of the victim might
be produced in court months after
death to show the nature of the wounds.
In Marini's collection he has a heart
pierced by a dagger, which looks as
fresh as the day on which It beat for
the last time. It is in such a condition
that it might be handed to the jury in

THE return of our victorious

New York a condition of affairs
which requires a new reading of
two homely faws to do it jus
tice: "All roads lead to the Bowery."
and "Jack and his money are Boon
parted" tell the story. Equipped with
an enforced accumulation of four or
five months 1 salary, the sailors of
Sampson's and Schley's fleets were in
full possession of that portion of the
city lear to the blue jacket's heart.
From the hour when the tlrst liberty
boat touched the dock on the direct
route to the Bowery, a new order of
affairs have prevailed. It has been a
dry and desolate season there since the
late war dragged so many g*>od cus
tomers away in haste. The Bowery,
that famous stretch of coast upon
which many a naval sailor has drifted
to his own undoing, and whose every
cobblestone could give expert testimony
in fights and frauds and midnight
crimes, was a summer resort in De
cember.
The news that the sailor heroes were
coming home again caused a wave of
feverish activity throughout the Bow
i cry, stores were rented and hastily
'â  fitted up with counter and shelves and
experts with corkscrew or club were en
gaged, every preparation necessary to
the luring of the sailor's dollar was
! made. Then a Stillness settled over the
i famous street. It was the calm before
the storm.
When a warship was paid ort at tne
expiration of a cruise, York street and
its tributaries fairly swarmed with
thugs, decoys and land sharks. Thefts
and badgering became so frequent that
finally more than one captain arranged
to have his crew taken from the yard
to New York City on a Government
tug. But this was a wasted precau
tion. In those days the brutal high
way robbery of the navy-yard's envi
ronments compared with the more sub
tle thievery of the Bowery as a lead
pipe does with a Jeweled dagger. Jack
was ashore to be robbed, and he seldom
escaped his destiny.
In 1883 the corvette Nlpsic reached
the Brooklyn yard from a long cruise
on the European station. In her crew
was a seaman who had managed to
gain the rating of chief quartermaster
by strict attention to duty. His pay
was $85 a month, and he contrived to
save $30. On previous cruises he had
been a spendthrift and a "fourth class
man" of the worst description, and this
change of attitude surprised his ship
mates. "What's up with Bill?" they
asked. "He's either getting nutty or
else some widdy's got him in tow. He
wouldn't draw any monthly money last
time, and the pay clerk almost turned
a fit. Bill will be in the asylum at
Washington before long."
But "Bill" continued to save and also
to add to his income by making caps
and fine mustering shirts fur the less
thrifty members of the crew. When the
Nipsic was paid off the chief quarter
LIE.
the Marini process would have been
very great.
Nelaton, the physician of Napoleon
111, by order of the Emperor investi
gated the Marini discoveries.
Nelaton gave the Neapolitan two
bodies to preserve, and this he did in
ISGN. One was that of an old man who
had been mysteriously murdered. The
body looks to-day as it did thirty years
ago. Round the neck is still the furrow
made by the rope used to drag the vic
tim along the street to a spot remote
from the place where he had met his
end.
The woman is of the same criminal
type. She also was the victim of an
assassin. The identity uf neither body j
was known at the time Marini subject- |
ed them to his process, and they would ]
never have been known had not the
doctor of Naples arrested the processes
of nature.
The "life-like" process may be applied
to a body that has been dried up; the
master stepped up to the table and
drew the' tidy sum of $1020. "I hope
you will take care of that money. Cal
kins," spoke up the commanding offi
cer, who was standing by watching the
operation. "Better put it away in some
safe bank and let it draw interest for
your old ag-e. Another cruise of the
same â "
"Saving your pardon, ean'ain, I ain't
coming back," interrupted Bill proudly.
"I've had enough of the service, sir.
I've got a little girl awaitin' for me,
and me and her are going to start a
farm out on Long Island. I've bet n
raising hâlh â 1 long enough, and now I'm
going to raise something more re

! as a farmer was the best Joke of the
! cruise. As he went below to pack his
i black bag he was the subject of much
! good-natured raillery. "Better steer a
course by night, mate," advised the
! master-at-arms. "It's mighty bad
cruising nowadays along York street."
"Why don't you charter a canal boat
to take you to Hayseed harbor?" said
another nhipmate with mock concern.
"I'd help to smuggle you out of the
ship after eight bells if you pass the
word." "I'll lay you a double eagle you
are knocking at the navy yard gate
! before this time next week," was the
! ship's cook's comment, and at last
Bill's ire was aroused.
"You blemed muddle-fingers don't
seem to understand the case, confound
you!" he shouted. "This ain't no sud
den resolve, mates. When I got homo
from the China station last cruis.-, I
found that my little girl had growed al
most into a woman. She was staying
with her grandmother, and it struck

start a little farm. I've saved the
money, and I'm going to put that little
girl beyond want, s'help me if I don't.
I Good-by. fellers."
Tho Nipsic was put under repairs
; without going out of commission, and
preparations for shipping a new crew
! were in operation, when, one evening
: after 9, a man limped up to the sentry
â¢ at the York street gate and demanded
| admittance. He was battered and
i bruised, a nondescript suit of ragged
j overalls clothed him, and he spoke in
a hesitating, rambling way, as if his
mind was affected. "Want to ship?"
he whispered. "Got a big discharge
and a ratin' of chief quarterniasi- r.
Got a little girl, too. May be I'll buy
a farm fur her some day. We talked
it over, and â say, want to go aboard
the guardo and sign in. Had a terri
ble time 'shore and want to get back
in service again. Lemme in, will you?"
"It's Bill Calkins," said the watch
man to the marine. "The sharks got
him after all. I heard he was paid off
with a wad as big as your right leg.
No use in talking, there are strings on
the rum over In the Bowery and you
can't nohow resist 'em."
Bill was escorted to the receiving
ship and permitted to sleep upon an old
hammock mattress spread on the for
ward berthdeck. About eight bells,

the officer. "It's from your home and

When the Vandalia was paid off af
ter a cruise in the later eighties, a
wiry little Irishman named Duffy, a
fireman on board, left the ship with
a cool $300 in his "monk bag." He was
ashore for a good time, and he went
to the Bowery to find it. That night
he was found in a hallway, stripped
of every cent, drugged and beaten. A
policeman paid his carfare to the
Yard and he shipped at once. A week
later, after he had rested up and re
covered some of his usual good spir
its, Duffy asked for liberty, but it was
denied him because he was in debt
for his new outfit.
Shortly after midnight he slipped
over the Bide to the dock by way of a
mooring hawser and â¢ made his escape
from the Yard through the "swamp,"
as the land north of the marine bar
racks was called. There was just a
touch of gray in the east when Duffy,
i hilarious and lurching, appeared on
j the dock again. He saluted the aston
; ished sentry with a wave of his hand,
I staggered up the gangway, and
jas he stepped on board his
foot slipped and he fell prostrate
j on the edge of the quarterdeck. There
was a loud Jingling of coin and a vast
number of dimes, nickels, quarters and
half-dollars fell from Duffy's pockets
and rolled haphazard over the deck.
"Gather thim oop, me byes," he
shouted proudly to the anchor watch
which had hastened to his assistance.
"It's all money ay that baste ay a
thafe. Murphy, who kapes the gin mill
forninst the- Bowery. Whoop! It's me
silf as is square wid him." He sub
sided Into a peaceful sleep in the
"brig" and the mystery remained un
solved until the morning papers ap
peared with a scare head article an
nouncing that the saloon of one Mi
chael Murphy on the Bowery had been
entered during the night, that the cash
drawer had been robbed of its contents,
that Murphy himself had been set upon
by the burglars and beaten insensible,
and that a sailor's knife lanyard had
been found on the premises. A few
detectives prowled around the yard
for several days, but Duffy was kept
under cover by his admiring shipmates
and the affair was finally forgotten.
If there is any excuse for roystering
the naval sailor has it. He is con
demned to pass/ the greater part of his
time on board a vessel much too small
and cramped for the crew occupying
it. He can seldom secure two consec
utive days ashore, and if he should
overstay his leave by so much as an
hour he is punished by restriction.

DR. EFISIO MARINI CF NAPLES, Inventor of the Process.
From a photograph.
of petrifaction. He changes a human
body to the consistency of marble â even
the softest portions of the flesh, even
the blood.
Perhaps the most remarkable achieve
ment of Dr. Marini in "marD.eizing"
a human body was when he petrified
Cardinal Guillaume Sanfelice in the
short space of four days.
As he was during his life so is the
cardinal in his death. The face re
minds one, by its serene sweetness, of
the mystic faces which Fra Angelico
had the secret of depicting. It pre
serves still the benign smile which
made it so dear to the Neapolitans,
when bending his handsome forehead
with a gentle air he raised his hand to
bless them. The expression nas some
thing about it spiritual, ethereal, which
gives to the person of the late Cardinal
the simple, pure look of the saints of
old. The face has a look which makes
one think that the dead priest was
worn out with works of piety, which
his ardent love for humanity made him
accomplish, but still smiling, despite it,
with a holy peace.
The preservation of the Cardinal sug
gests that other great men may by the
Marini process be handed down to pos
terity. The process seems to make un
necessary the work of the sculptor.
We can keep our heroes not in stone
or plaster, but in the flesh.
Some such motive, in addition to their
religious beliefs, doubtless influenced
the ancient Egyptians when they made
their mummies.
But the process of Marini is as far
superior to anything the Egyptian ever
dreamed of as is the ocean greyhound
to an Brie Canal barge. This difference
is very well demonstrated in Marini's
little museum, which contains samples
of the work of those who preceded him
in his specialty.
In his showcase are many fragments
of Egyptian mummies. He has a foot
which was mummified by nature and
which was taken from a vault in the
Cathedral of Venzone, where all the
dead bodies are perfectly preserved be
cause of a species of little fungus which
formed on the skin and living as a par
asite reduced it to a state of dryness
that prevented decay.
One of the most precious Bouvenira
which Marini petrified was some blood
of Garibaldi.
He made It Into a -medal and offered
It to the general In order that he, as
Marini wrote him, might In looking at
it, brace himself up for his last fight,
and that others mipht remember it as
a part of the same blood that the heror
shed on the rocks of D'Aspromonte.
In the middle of the medal are en
graved these words: "The blood ofi
Garibaldi is forever red."
In spite of the honors scientific men,
have showered upon Marini he is
modest.
Fur thirty years he has lived at Na
ples on' his private practice. All sorts oÂ£
opportunities have been offered him to
g-o to foreign countries, where he could
make large sums out of his abilities,
but these offers only make him miser
able. He is a patriot and they show
him how little his own country appre
ciates him in comparison with others.
He would consider it a crime to emi
grate with his dlscoveriea He thinks
they belong to Italy. But that country,
unfortunately, does n>>t seem to be in
the- active intellectual condition neces
sary to appreciate at his true worth a
man of Marini's capacity.
At one time it looked â that was in
1871 â as if Italy were going to recognize
his merit. The Minister of Public In
struction created a commission to in
vestigate his work, but nothing came oft
it except some flattering testimonials.
In some places Marini has been de
nounced as a sorcerer and a dcvil â a
man who used the black arts of the al
chemist of former days, spending hi 9
time in trying to extract from dead
bodies the elixir of life. Others look
upon him as a crank. Marini himself
has often become discouraged. He saia
recently to Ferrara, sighing, his whita
head bowed with grief:
"Believe me, my dear sir, believe me,
I shall finish by throwing- everything
into the sea."

GOSSIP.
DEAREST Marguerite: Fancy a
cotillion without Southard Hoff
man. Take the brake off your im
agination and give If full swing.
What <io you say? Your fancy
cannot gallop at such a pace? I do not
marvel. For a dance without Southard's
j reaence is likeâ well, is like a dance
without music. But <">n Saturday night,
October 8, ISPS, the "light fantastic" was
tripped with Southard thousands of miles
away. Doesn't it make your nerves do
a two-step to think of It?
This seeming Impossibility really came
to pass. With my own two eyes I saw
It, with my own two feet I tripped It,
and deep in my heart of hearts I re
gretted that such a thing should be.
Though foolish men hie away to dis
tant lands, yet fond maidens cannot wear
the willow. For 'tis our birthright to
laugh and make merry. So we chaeed
the glowing hours with flying feet at the
Miller cotillion.
But, I'eg, 1 felt thÂ© crushing weight of
my twenty years. A dozen other girls
confessed the same thing. For there were
lust thirteen of ue who had "been there
before." The others were sweet little
girls who have evoluted from the Wed
nesday Afternoon classes to these Satur

HUNTING CHINATOWN FOR RARE CHINA
IS
THE NEW FAD
Costs Little Here, but in Europe It Is Expensive.
MRS. LOU WILLIAMS of Pa
ciric avenue has been making
a fad Of collecting china for
the last eight years, both here
and abroad. At a dinner party
last week she used for the first time her
just completed set of Irnari. The cloth
was white, and the only decoration be
side the dishes was a tall center piece
of yellow and white chrysanthemums.
"Oh, you may well admire my china,"
Mrs Williams answered to the con
tinual exclamations of "How perfectly
lovely."
"I have gathered it all in Chinatown
piece by piece, and Imarl is scarce in
San Francisco now. It has been the
greatest fun and I have, never had a
single unpleasant experience going
about among the Bhops. We do not
half appreciate our Chinese and Japan
ese china because It so inexpensive. In
Paris I saw the chrysanthemum cups
which can be bought here for $1 25, and
they could not be bought for less than
$7. The same with the seven sages
cup. The thousand wise men cups are
worth |50 there, and can be bought here
for J2O. When I furnished my house I
wanted something different from what
any one has, so I began to collect my
Imari, and at last I have every piece.
My soup tureen is the last.
"The Imari ware is all one pattern
and the colors are always the same â
vermilion red and royal blue and gold.
When the English first went to China
the ware was made into the regulation
dinner services. These services do not
come intact, but in separate pieces, be
cause the only factory where they were
made is no longer in existence. The
Miller cortllllon. We werea curious mixture
of tender sprouts and half-blown blos
soms. For It la against the ethics of
swelldom that buds should unfold their
sweetness collectively. They must appear
individually at some especial function,

admire. After they have formally come
out." Mabel and her partnerâ buds in this
winter's joys and sorrows, principally
Borrows â will be allowed to lend their
fragrance to the Saturday Night co
tillions.
But the dear buds will not be able to
i enjoy the genuine, bona-flde buddom that
!is their due. For Southard Hoffman's ue
! sertion to distant Honolulu makes that
! impossible. Who else is there who so dutl
tifully dlsdaln6 the charms of blossoms
and conspicuously confines his attention
to the Buds? Southard loves them, one
1 and all. He never confuses their respect
ive preference for flowers or chocolates;
i he helps them tenderly over the stony
! places of a first season, and then when
winter is over, without one lingering
< glare-, he flits airily away to the new
crop of buds.
On! by the way, Peggy dear, come,
"fess" up. You've told some one about
Emile Bruguiere's engagement. You must
have whispered it, for every one knows it,
! and although Emile denies It, he has the
gra<-e to blush while doing so.

fish sets are particularly beautiful, as
they are made in the shape of a fish.
The dessert plates have laoe-patterned
edges, but all others are scalloped. The
vegetable dishes have trays for draw
ing peas or asparagus, like a soup dish.
The table effect is simply gorgeous and
the expense of a set Is not great.
"My first plates cost me only 10
cents," Mre. Williams said, "but my
last have cost 60 cents. All the rest are
In the same proportion. I have begun
a Canton set now, and I think It is, if
anything, prettier, and it is much easier
to find and not so expensive, either."
The Canton ware is green and gold
and not so barbarous in effect as the
Imari. The patterns are more varied,
but always in the same lineâ flowers in
vases, in wreaths or separate, combined
with Chinese drawing room scenes. The
different dishes, however, are not so
oddly shaped, but the china is liner
than the Imari.
There Is another Canton ware which
is blue and always In one pattern, and
not unlike our grandmother's old blue
and white china. It has always one
pattern. There is a blue pagoda-top
Joss house and a man sailing toward it
in a sampan. This china has little or
no gold, and is therefore much the
simpler.
Neither the Canton or Imari come in
anything but tako ware, while the Sat
suma. Cloisonne and Kusan are made
only In ornamental china.
The famous peach blow .vase which
the Duchess of Marlborough, when she
was still Mrs. Hammersly of New
York, paid $20,000 for, was bt this Ku
san ware. It is almost without design,
and its beauty lies in the color. The
peach blow was pink and white, but
the usual color is green at the top,
which changes through every shade to
ashes of rose at the bottom. It is

smooth, highly glazed and looks like a '
great opal.
The Cloisonne Is the ware we see
most commonly and is an example of
Chinese painstaking patience. It has :
a foundation of copper and the flowers
and birds are outlined in gold or silver
In the best ware and in copper or brass
in cheaper pieces. Then each /lower is j
filled in and baked over and over again,
and all the work must be done by hand.
One piece will take weeks to complete,
and then the glaze may not be perfect, !
and. as the Chinaman says, will have
"plenty holps." There is a clever imita
tion of. Cloisonne made by the Japanese
which has the copper or gold wire
painted in. Considering the work, Cloi- i
sonne is not expensive, as a very per- ;
feet vase six or seven inches high can
be bought for $5, or for $100 large vases
with storks flying in intense blue sky,
or flowers on different colored back- i
grounds.
The Satsuma wnre is all made by one '
family, but a Chinese has as many
cousinf as a Virginian, so that the fac
tory is not a small one. You can tell a
Satsuma piece invariably by the pe
culiar crackled effect under the glaze.
The patterns are very minute and are
painted by hand under a microseonÂ».
so to appreciate the'r teiuty one must
Ic.k at them through a slass. One oi
the most frequent forma is an incense
burner having three legs and a colled
dragon on top. There is much more
gold on the Satsuma than on any other
ware, which adds much to its expense.
Besides these special makes nre oth
ers which are not so plentiful. Little
of the best china ev.->r leaves its own
country, as it is made for the Em
peror's family, and bÂ»ars the royal
monogram which it would be blasphem
ous t<> sell.
The Japanese teacups, which can be
bought for less than '^ cents out here,
are simply beautiful, and any place else
cost three or four times the amount.
The competition among the unusually
large number of Chines^ merchants
here makes their wares cheap. In the
British Museum are preserved quanti- ,
ties of china exactly like what can b<->
found here in any good Chinatown
shop, which was seized in China 250.
y->ars ago as trophies of English vic
tories.
In buying china one can trust the
Chinaman to tell the truth, but he sel
dom knows what he has in stock. Mrs.
Williams toM me how she had asked a |
Chinaman to find her a soup tureen.
"The man looked all over town, but i
said he could not find one. Going into
his store one day, I stopped and looked
at siime cups in the window. Next a j
tray I spied my tureen, and it had been :
there 'alle timee.' "
Beware, however, what the Japanese â 
tells you, for if he has not what you
want he will swear an Imari is a Can
ton. He Is absolutely without a con
science when it comes to china ware.
The gilding on this ware, too, is not
to be trusted. The real gold is laid first
on paste and is quite green before it is
UP-TO-DATE LOVE CHARTS
Continued From Page Twenty.
before the Peace Commission reports.
At a girls' luncheon last week the
subject most discussed was love charms.
Each 'girl but my unfortunate self was
the happy possessor of an amulet of
some description, and I began to feel in
very bad form. Indeed, after having
given a negative reply, for the sixth
time, to the question: "You wear a love
charm, don't you?" From that moment
I resolved to get as many addresses as
I could of "eminent seeresses," and
thus equipped to start out on a pilgrim
age of inquiry to obtain the most pot
ent, the most unique, "the very latest"
love charm that could be found, i was
even determined to "o'erstep the
bounds" of my pocketbook and be most
recklessly extravagant if need be in
acquiring the proper love charm and
happiness.
R, with my address book filled with
euphonious names of the various
esses whom I gathered from my girl
friends, I started forth.
The first doorbell I rang was in a
X known down-town boarding house,
after inquiring for the seer^ss I

d into the "inner sanctuary" by the
seeress.
She was gowned in a robe of Turkish
pattern which in every degree harmnn
(i with her apartments.
Ie was superb, indeed. Quite an up
late seeress. She wore rings of won-
r ul workmanship and curious dc
i. At her neck she wore a large
ivory pin in which was im
ded, in Egyptian gold, the word
iVell, my dear," she began, confi
tly and confidentially, "you want
r fortune told, or do you intend buy
ing a love charm? â a love charm, cer
tainly, I was sure of it; for all the dear
tig ladies are buying them now."
issented, and the seeress continued:
, I see that you think you are in
with a young gentleman, and I
:hree young gentlemen in love with
Now, darling" â one must tolerate
...avagant terms of endearment if
I one wishes to buy a love charm â "I do
not want to interfere with your lovÂ«
affairs, but I do want my dear young
lady to be happy. Now, I can wÂ»rk
you a love charm that will make it
easy for you to give up the young gen
tleman with whom you think you are
in love, for it is not to your advantage
to marry him.
"This charm which I will make for
you is one that will direct your heart
to another man, who really is the one
chosen of heaven for you, my dear. He
is in love with you. but you are not at
this time aware of it. I solemnly avow
that before the moon is crescent you
will have a proposal of marriage and
accept this gentleman, who is your
fate.
"If you do not wear this charm you
will have a most unpleasant breaking
off with the gentleman to whom you
have decided to trust your happiness."
"How much will such a love charm
cost?" I intrepidly Interjected.
"My dear, I make several kinds of
love charms, but this one suited to
your case, powerful enough not only to
bring your true love to you, but also
to take this man from you uncondition
ally and without a pang of regret. I
will make for $40, and you will be glad
to pay a hundred for it two weeks
hence."
"Tell me what this charm is made
of?" I asked, fearful of mysterious in
gredients.
"Oh, I will tell you the material
(hinps, but of course the magic in
fluences exerted can never be known
but to myself and the higher powers.
First, you must give me your first
name and that of the young gentleman
with whom you are now infatuated.
These I will copy in blood upon a piece
of parchment made from the skin of a
goat belonging to my great-grand
father in India, who was the greatest
seer in the kingdom. Upon this parch
ment I will also copy the name of the
gentleman you give me. but that only
in blue ink, which, as the charm begins
to work, will fade out and in its place
will be written by magic the name of
the man whom you are destined to
marry. This parchment I will sew in a
silken bag wet in the mystic depths of
a magic well In Asia, and after passing
it through the magic flame I will call
upon the occult powers to protect it
and its owner. This I will hang about
your neck tird with a ribbon of your
favorite color â blue is your lucky
color, my dear, and you should always
wear it before your admirers. I cannot
begin the charm until the hour of mid
night, when the proper conditions pre
vail, so leave a deposit and call for it
to-morrow, my dear."
This charm appealed to me as â¢won
derfully potent, but as my determina
tion was to see a variety of charms be
fore I invested I told madame that I
would cc-nslder the matter over night
before deciding and bade her good-day.
My next address took me out of the
fashionable uptown quarter over to XÂ»\
toma street. I was agreeably surprised
when I reached the address to find a
house freshly painted, clean and the
stairs newly carpeted.
Madame, the seeress. rustled in a silk
gown. Her nails were badly kept, but
her begrimed fingers were covered with
rings. She seemed in great good spirits.
I asked her if she was doing a good
business.
"Oh, my dear young lady, business
was never better. Since the war began
people somehow are beginning to see
the power in love charms and love phil
ters. I knew they would see it some day,
so I never became discouraged. Al
though I have been a seeress for twen
ty-five years I have sold more love
charms during the past six months than
during the rest of that entire time. My
business hours used to be from 2 to 5
o'clock in the afternoons and from 7 to
polished. It never loses the dead look,
which is a sure distinction between i: â¢
: real and the gold paint which will co?ne
off in half a dozen washings. ' The glid
ing is glittering and has a copper tinge,
and is much smoother than the real
. gold color, which is liable to be gritty.
I 8 in the evening, but now I am rushed
i from morning until night. The war
with Spain was a blessing to me and
! others of my profession, for many a
! dear soldier bey went off 10 Manila and
i Santiago with a love charm made by
me at the request of his sweetheart.
i whose doubts and fears were set at rest
knowing her lover was under her speli,
no matter how many miles asunder.
"One lieutenant, who has since gained
great honor f'>r his bravery during the
war, wears an amulet around his neclc
| mace of a turquoise, which is his
sweetheart's birth stone, cut in the
! shape at half a heart, wniie the dear
| little girl he left behind him wears the
ether half made of a topaz, which is
her lover's birth stone. I have promised
to unite these stones by magic power
when he returns to claim his bride. It
must then be placed in a box lined with
leaves, which 1 gathered from a tree
of magic parts in Turkey. I sold them.
These two charms sold for $3U apiece."
'"Do you keep other kinds of charms?"
I asked.
"Bless me, yes, my dear. Never two
alike though, for I must make them as
1 am' directed by th<- occult powers act
ing through the person wishing to buy
a charm."
This I took to mean in un-occult par
lance to be: "Costly thy love charm
as thy purse can buy."
"Now, darling, a charm suited to you
should be made of herbs, for you are
emotional and one of your tempera
' ment is given judgment to act in crises
through the magic power expected by a
love Philter made of herbs. The most
potent one I will make out of an herb
! which I gather off the tomb of an In
; dian chief buried near the cemetery. I
! only gather these leaves on each 29th
| day of February, just before sunrise.
"With this herb 1 mix the powdered
bark of thirteen different trees from
thirteen different countries, and then
this potion is sewed in a bag. In your
j case, my dear, I shall cut the bag in
! the shape of a Maltese cross, for you
i are too highly emotional to wear it
! heart-shaped. I take 3333 stitches in
' this bag; each stitch is significant of
' some magic letter or sign. This bag
j you must wear on the right hand side
away from your heart, my dear.
"It will bring you a splendid marriage
I and success in all your undertakings.
I will make it in your case for only $25,
which is most reasonable, I assure
you."
"Have you any cheaper ones that
have power?"
"Oh, they all have power, my dearâ
the ones I make, and I have some as
cheap as $1. which upon another per
son would be as potent as this one on
you. but the occult powers have chosen
this kind for you and I dare not inter
fere with their decision."
"J have a hare's foot," I suggested,
"given to me by a friend on my birth
day and she wished upon it. It is sup
l < sed to bring me luck in love, as it Is
i the left hind foot of a graveyard rab
bit, caught in the middle of the night
on the 13th day of the month, by a
cross-eyed negro."
"For $10, my dear, I will guarantee to
I add a charm to that so that it will ac
i quire the real true magic? power."
With a promise to call again the next
day and bring to her the hare's foot.
I left her.
Crossing the city I was shown into
another seeress" shop, where I was in
formed that business had been so brisk
that she could not see to the arrange
! ment of her apartments, nor would she
I trust it to any one else. While waiting
i for the seeress to finish her toilet,
i which I had interrupted, the doorbell
rang six times and the parlors were
soon half full of people.
Madame finally reappeared and led
me into her "symposium." While I
was looking at the beautifully enamel
| ed watch pinned to her ample bosom,
| with a diamond crescent, she asked me
i what I wished â a love charm or my
i horoscope cast?
"Madame," I ventured, "you have
been recommended to me as the best
seeress In the city and I want to get
| from you a love charm."
"I don't have to advertise myself."
she answered, primming herself. "I
I am the only seeress in San Francisco
who 1b not a fraud. I am overrun with
business. You want a love charm, do
you? What would you be willing to
pay?" "A dollar," I ventured, just to
see what madame would answer.
""Why, a young lady of your appear-
I ance certainly would not invest in so
j cheap a charm. I sell that kind to
! shop girls and you know I have them
as high as $200. made of precious stones.
I rubles and sapphires. I sell a great
many of that kind."
"What can you give me for $50?" I
; asked. "I want something compounded
i and made by your hands."
Madame smoothed her brow, eyed me
j discriminatingly, and ran her fingers
! through her hair for a moment before
answering. "You bring to me a lock
of your sweetheart's hair cut along the
j chord just back of the left ear. This
j chord connects directly with the heart.
I will sew this lock of hair into a piece
I of clothing that has touched the sole
; of your own footâ better, a stacking.
: This charm yon must wear next the
1 skin on the left hand side, between the
' third and fourth ribs.
"You can have that charm for $15
It's cheap. Shall I take your order?"
and she drew out an order book from
the folds of her wrapper and poised a
stubby pencil.
"I'll see first if my 'best youn* man*
will part with the lock of hair," I re
plied.
Madame arose, bowed me out cere
moniously, and ushered in a fluffy lit
tle blonde, all with one motion of her
fat, silk-encased body.
Next I visited an astrologer who tried
to sell me a love potion made out of
powdered herbs which he assured me
he had gathered from the four corners
of the earth and ground tosether in a
mortar made in India five hundred
years ago. This mortar had been hand

sparkling and her cheek;} red with the

'"But about Mrs. Vanderbilt-Whitney."
persisted the questioner, "is it a fact that
she is so addicted to furs?"
"Yes." replied the first speaker, "she
is more so than any other woman in the
world. On her tour around the world she
gathered furs from every nation, for there

her now' we would I nd her rirged out in

Her words were prophetic, for a few
blocks further on turning into Delmon-
Ico'a came this self-same matron. She
wore a gown of rich plaid goods of many
Kay colors. Aruur.d her neck was hooked
a dark green collarette with edges of
grebe breasts. They were gray with a
touch of green along their edges. The
collar was ' particularly high, and was
lined with green satin. She wore a big
gray hat with bands of green velvet
around it, and on one Bide was a variety
of bird of paradise with long trailing
tail feathers. Two ostrich tips helped
out the plumage of .he bird of paradise.
Her muff was a new variety of muff.
It was made of green velvet edged with
very deep lace. In front was a small
but very pretty fox's head.
Women of fashion are quick to put on
winter garments. Summer clothes look
sadly faded in the Indian summer's sun.
and 'feminine eyes look for fresh, bright
goods. The chaJlies and the thin cot
ton stuffs of summer are thrown aside,
for it Is true that after the season is
over they are mere rags: and in their
place come the brilliant fall plaids.
A very pretty autumn toilet without a
particle of fur upon it had for Its most
distinguishing feature a muff of brown
velvet curiously laid in great loops. The
sides of the muff consisted of brocaded
velvet cut into points, and wired like a
6tar. The same velvet was employed at
the neck whore It was tied in a very large
bow with two brilliantly lined ends. The
hat was a turban of brown velvet and
on one side stood a handsome bird.
Birds and fur are used a great deal to
gether this fall: and it is astonishing to
note in how many ways they can be com
bined. Fur muffs with birds upon them,
collarettes fastened with bird's heads, and
fur toques trimmed with plumage are no
novelty.
White ermine will be fashionable, but
alas, it will also be expensive. There is
this year a pretty substitute for ermine
which will be considerably worn. It car.

The collar which was deep enough to

is almost certain to be fatal to the attrac
tiveness of a very stout woman, and vice
versa.
Do not plan your gown according to any
partly of linen and partly of taffetas.
The ground is of plain white taffetas,
trimmed around the bottom with two cut
up flounces of the same material. The
garment is completely applique to the fig
ure in the upper part, and set in at the
waist with a simple piping of white taf
fetas cut on the cross. The petticoat is
made to fit closely by pleats around the
hips. It increases in fullness half way
down, and exuands into the form of a
plumeau at the bottom. Over the taf
fetas is a half petticoat of white lawn,
which can be adjusted as desired, and can
be removed to be washed without un
picking the silk skirt. This half petti
coat is composed of a wide flounce scal
loped in the upper part and headed with
a gather of Valenciennes, beneath which
Is a broad Valenciennes insertion. In the
body of the flounce are inlaid other
bands of insertion crossing each other
and forming lozenges. In the center of
eacb lozenge is a small rose pattern in
laid in Vatenciennes. A band of the same
Insertion runs around the bottom be
tween the lawn and the lace flounces with
which the taffetas skirt is trimmed.
In a white petticoat, made by time,
Peeters, No. 14 Hue Halevy, the upper
part fits closely round the body, and be
gins to widen beneath the hips. The
lower part is trimmed with two wide
Souncn of English application lace laid
over flounces of plain taffetas and whit.'
mousseline de sole. The flounces art- of
equal width. each gathered and edged with
a ruche of white mousseline de soie. The
uppermost is headed with a similar
ruche.
Another petticoat from the same estab
lishment fits very tightly round the flg
ure and is set in a simple piping of silk.
The mat. rial Is of white ground silk bp>
caded with diagonal stripes composed of
garlands of Sowers. The petticoat la
trimmed with a wide flounce of frilled
mousseline de soie wider in front than
at the sid.-s and behind. Over this flouncu
falls another of the lace. In the center
the trilled flounce shows very plainly,
while at the sides and back it is entirely
covered by the lace.
Another is of pink shot taffetas, made
very tight round the body like the rest.
It Is trimmed round the bottom with four
Bounces cut on the cross, very narrow in
front and increasing in width in the sides
and back. The uppermost is set on over
a flounce of the taffetas and fixed to the
skirt with a small piping of pink taffetas.
Round the edge of each flounce is a roll
of the same material. The lowest Bounce
staits at the sides and runs down the
back only.

The tall, slender woman may, if she

burnished-copper - hair, such as Titian
loved to paint, looks in nothing better
than in a gown of the same coppery tints,
shading down to deeper tones. Red hair,
as.it is commonly called, has. until quite
recently, been in disrepute, save with the
artists. Blue, which has long: been sup
posed to be the one color that women
with auburn-tinted hair could wear to the
greatest advantage, la the one color that
should never approach it. The colors that
are best contrasted with red hair, par-
Ucuarly where it is accompanied by brown
eyes, are cream-white, black, blue-green,
olive-green and Srray-green, maroon,
stone-gray, amethyst, plum color, brown,
brownish purple and clear amber, which
is a most poetic color, also reds with an
amber glint In them.. The woman with
this coloring should avoid ordinary reds,
as she would an affectionate child that

The blue-eyed women of this type
should seek particularly the greens, yel

and black.
Borne women there are who have with
this shade of hair, eyes that are of a
preenish hue. A pale aquamarine creation
of silk and tulle relieved by ornaments of

for the woman of this type to array her

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
MISS LOI'IS H.â Very often when the
hair first begins to grow gray a tonic
will, by strengthening and invigorating
the hair bulbs, bring back the natural
tints. The claret tonic which you speak
of is very good for this purpose. The
proportions are: Sixty grams genuine
'claret and one gram sulphate of iron.
801 l for one minute. When cold bottle
and cork. Wash the hair with the tonic
twice a week, allowing it to dry on.
MAY J.â For the oily skin use this lo
tion: Alcohol, four ounces; ummonla, ouÂ»
ounce; oil of lavender, one dram. Mix
by shaking in a six-ounce bottle. Add
one scani (not one
drop more* to two quarts of warm water
when the face is washed. It will soften
the water and wash away the oils which
come to the surface of the skin. Never
use so;ip upon your face when it has the
effect you describe. You can improve the
condition of your skin hut very tittle so
long as you have the chronic trouble you
speak of. Have your physician give you
something to remedy that condition. You
will undergo all sorts of complaints un
less you do. Bitter apple is used in com
bination with Jamaica rum as a hair
tonic.
M.â Try the treatment prescribed for a
couple of months before getting discour
aged. You cannot expect in a couple of
weeks to remedy a condition that has ex-
Isted for so long. In Sunday's paper of
September IS I gave a special talk on the
treatment of blackheads. I hope you
saw it. A little bit of finely powdered
borax put on a piece of linen and rubbed
lightly into the skin will often help
greatly.
EUGENE N.â There is nothing better to
cure sunburn than thick, sweet cream.
Bathe the face with it several times and
the color will soon die out and the Bore
ness disappear. Any good, pure cold
cream rubbed into the hands at nirht will
make them soft and white.
.MRS. X. â 1 consider the acid that you
used quite as dangerous us the one I sug
gested. However, as it did the work
without any bad results it is all right.
The hair that grew in the center of the
mole should have fallen with the scab.
As it did not there is nothing but the
electric needle that '11 remove it per
manently.
LITTLE LOLITAâ Are you sure that
you got the proper ingredients for your
skin food, and that they were the very
best quality? Inestimable damage is done
to skins by using some of the cheap
creams that are bought in the shops. If
the food contained the ingredients called
fOT It could not have been that which
caused the peculiar eruption on your
face. If it continues I should cease using
it. as there must be something wrong
ab< u1 it. Ar-' you sure it was made in a
porcelain kettle, and not In a metal one?
It should whiten and clear the com
plexion.
OROCKA â T'nless your freckles are of
th.- "always-with-you" kind you will
probably find the following lotion effica
cious in removing them: Three grains
borax: five drama rosewater; five drams
orange flower water. Apply Immediately
after coming in out of the sun. Of course
the nail powder can be made at home.
but I think you will find it as wise to
purchase the prepared powder from
your druggist.
MARGERIEâ I think what you need is
a good nourishing skin food. There is
none betttr than the orange flower skin
food, formula for which has been given
so many times In these columns. In caso
you have not seen it I will repeat it:
Spermaceti. M: ounce; white wax, *-,
ounce: sweet almond oil, 1 ounce; lanoline,
1 ounce; cocoanut oil.- 1 ounce; tincture
benzoin, 10 drops; orange flower water, 1
ounce. Melt the first iive ingredients in
a porcelain kettle. Take from the fire
and add the benzoin and the orange flow
t r water. Muffing it with an egg-beater
until cold. Rub this well into the skin
at night after washing the face in tepid
water and castile soap. The rough
patches that come out on your face are
probably caused by an inactive liver.
When they appear apply the following:
One-half dram hyphosulphite of soda to
one-half ounce of water. Allow it to dry
on.
J. C. B. â I do not know which formula
you mean when you say "cucumber
wash," as I nave given several. The
formula for cucumber milk is quite
elaborate. A very good wash can be
made by pressing the juice out of the
green cucumber and heating it until a
white scum rises to the top. Skim this
off and then strain. Dilute it about one
third with rosewater. A little alcohol
added to it will, preserve it. This is used
to whiten the skin.

Xonna Ferner in desiccated farce, and
Kubert Downing in tinned tragedy.
And the latter was an act worth any

the town. I have always contended
that three hours of him are too much

acting is of the brickbat type there are
several instances of amusing "busi
ness" in it. The little piece given by
Mr. Boniface and Miss Ferner is named
"A Game of Lobby," and its question
able fun lies in an interchange of gar
ments by the female character and a
Senate page. This does not take place
in view of the audience â that would be
a physical impossibility, for the page,
whose clothes fit him like his skin, is
very slim and Miss Ferner quite other
wise. But there is a deal of brandished
lingerie and small talk about the moral
responsibilities of pins that is not Justi
fied by any particular humor in the
lines. Miss Ferner shouts her part in
the usual vaudevillese and Mr. Boni
face tries even though he does not
wholly succeed to impart character to
the Kentucky Senator.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Now these turns are not of a like
quality, but their general intention is
all right. They stand for the better
class of vaudeville work, the "legiti
mate" class that the vaudeville public
first pitied, then endured and now em
braces. More of the same sort, better
if possible and more novel, may change
the tune in the Alhambra box office.
Good San Francisco money has gone
into this enterprise. (And over J20.000,
I am told, has gone out of it through
silly management.) The directors are
local business men who deserve some
thing better than the fate of angels.
The first serious drawbacks were an
incompetent manager, no booking fa
cilities at allâ and the Orpheum. The
Orpheum has John Morrisey and a
booking system by which performers
can be kept under practically the one
engagement for something like half a
year. This means the saving of thous
ands on transportation and makes pos
sible almost any number of changes
for each week's bill. The Alhambra
now haa a manager, but it needs a cir
cuit, without which it will merely be
working for railroad companies. Cir
cuits are not acquired in a day, and
although there is a strong rumor on the
New York Rialto to the effect that this
house will be included in the Klaw and
Erlanger combination, the Alhambra
needs in the meantime good
strong shows, with a special sensation
every few weeks, so that the public
will find out its name and address. Mr.
Jackson told me something besides the
hard-luck story. His agent at the late
scenes of slaughter has secured an
opera company composed entirely of
emancipated Cubans. It would be a
nice bit of reciprocity for these people
to come and free the Alhambra from
the "hoodoo."

a "thriller" to please those theater goers
who are fond of giving vent to their pa

Jtastarvd's Play produced ir\ f\zvJ
York by J*lar\sfield arvd irv
Philadelphia b\j Daly #
At last America has seen Rostand**
poetic drama, "Cyrano de Bergerac, " Â«n
the stage. Richard Mansfield gave it a pro
duction at the Garrick Theater,
New York, last Monday nightâ a
production that, epart from the
acting, will long be recalled as a rec
ord of managerial magnificence. From
the artistic standpoint, both play and
playet have scored great success. It Is
too early In the day to estimate the pop
ular verdict. The first night audience
was cold during the opening scenes, seem
ing not to be in accord with the extremely
romantic atmosphere which Rostand has
given to his seventeenth century; but as
the play progressed its thrill was felt, the
house warmed and the calls and recalls at
the drop of the curtain were numerous.
Lyman B. Clover went from Chicago
to New York for the opening and tele
graphed to the Times-Herald some four
thousand words of review. As the fol
low will show, he thinks Mansfield's im
personation a better one than O'-ijfelms.
"The play is an Inspiration, and the
acting a revelation. Nothing could be
more fascinating than Dramatist Ros
tand's humor, sentiment and most extra
ordinary tour de force in the realm of
poetic Imagination, unless it is the ab
solutely unique brilliancy and illuminat
ing power or Mr. Mansfield's delineation
of the central character.
"A more splendid union of such poetic
fancy along entirely original lines as that
{supplied by Rostand, with creative abil
ity so inspiring as the genius flash of cre
ative art contributed by the great Amer
ican actor, cannot reasonably be hoped
for either at the present time or in the
future.
"In an artistic sense Mr. Mansfield has
improved upon the external appearance
and qualifications presented by M. Co
quelin. The latter gentleman played the
roll in a tone almost of comedy. Mr.
Mansfield makes Cyrano a chevalier and
fuardsman of seriously romantic thought,
ut with weapons of wit and satire
which are Incidental to the nersonage
and not his main characteristic. In har
mony with this conception he dresses
the part with such dignity that even the
exaggerated nose does not lend a sug
gestion of low comedy to the character.
"This is in accordance with the keynote
of poetic thought struck by Rostand and
preserved by him to the end. So true is
Mr. Mansfield's conception in this partic
ular that the nose, in place of continuing
a comic suggestion after the first act, is
either forgotten entirely or else is re
garded with a certain sense of dignified
pity.
"No doubt this great actor will soon
impress his interpretation of the charac
ter upon the public mind, and while
those who wish to laugh might prefer the
Coquelin manner. It is certain that stu
dents of literature and the higher drama
must thank him for the wiser course of
treating the Rostand play with that ab
solute respect without which the splendid
characteristics of this epoch-making
drama will be lost to sight."
Coincident with Mansfield's production
in New York, Ada Rehan and the Daly
company produced Mr. Daly's version of
"Cyrano" in Philadelphia. Miss Rehan
played Roxane and Charles Richmond
the title part. From the accounts re
ceived thiÂ» production too is a success.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. B.â The stock market to
day continued !n the I. i professional
trading element. Transactions were of small
volume and not widely distributed. Such as
They were, they reflected a decidedly unsettled
and hesitating frame of mind on the part of
the t:\n<lers. The opening tendency was down
ward, affected by a break of a point in Brook
lyn Transit and continued pressure on North
ern Pacific. The foreign markets were uinft
k in France, tight
in Berlin and the public agitation In
Spain for payment of Interest on Government
bonds in pesetas instead of francs. This had
Fome influence on the opening here, although
Americana had been supported in London on
from New York. Strength in Tobacco,
which r â¢ -se 2'-^ per cent, supplemented by pup
il Transit, People's Gas and
Manhattan and covering of shorts In Bazar,
cht-' i ivtui a rally In
Northern Pacific which drove the short!" to
md which wa.* accompanied by a rumor
' the interests dominat
ing n been adjusted. The pro
: nal traders then took the lon* side of the
market for a turn and there was a general
â¢-. The appearance of the
bank statement added to the bullish feeling, as
it was Cully .'is favorable as could be expected.
Although the reserve requirements had been
by reason of the larger de
: > in cash left the
surplus reserve $3,416,456 higher. The expansion
of l.ans, though less than 11.000,000. indicates
the turn in the tide of the money nmrket. and
is the first increase in that item since Sep
tember 2. The loan contraction from that date
up to last Saturday's return was $36,601,100.
Evin for last week it will he remembered the
gain in cash reserve was only accomplished by
a loar 500. This week the
etrenntht r.i- - eserve has not prevented
a.n extension of credit to the extent of 1807,807.
It is not Improbable that the nearly developed
investment in long sterling exchange for the
ending credits abroad figures in the
item. Expi tatlon* that the downward turn in
would come to an end this week in the
market were disappointing, though there
.my Indications of a returning confidence
in the underlying strength of those conditions
and the value of securities.
Most of the embarrassments -which have been
cited to explain the failure of prices to Hue
have been removed. Money in working stead
ily to an easier basis and the process of loan
contraction and consequent forced liquidation
of securities has come to an end. The Gov
ernment has collected practically all of the
$200,000,000 bonds subscriptions and has com
menced Its disbursement by the payment of
obligations on account of the war. Imports of
gold to the amount of less than J20.00Q.000 have
brought adequate relief and have ceased, while
the continued "cumulation of credits abroad
is evidently being left there as interest, as re
flected in the investment In "long sterling" in
the Increase. Apprehensions that the holding
back of winter wheat for higher prices would
result In decreased earnings for the railroads
as compared with last year's high level have
been dissipated by the large earnings shown in
the traffic statements of St. Paul, Northern
Pacific and other Important grain carrying
roads, showing the large growth In general
business In spite of the decreased grain move
ment. The large and persistent foreign da
mand for breadstuffs and the advancing prices
â with the markets free from large â¢ speculative
manipulation give increasing ground for confi
dence in a profitable disposition of the coun
try's crop. But in spite of the numerous
favorable factors in the situation, prices of
stocks have failed to advance materially. One
reason has been the unsettling influence of the
violent fluctuations anil feverish activity in
the great Industrial specialties. Tobacco suf
fered from the completion of speculative liqui
dation, dropping to V." with a subsequent rally
of over 10 points. Sugar has been affected by
the opening of the war In the trade, and there
were breaks in other Industrials and as violent
advances at some points, notably Metropolitan
and Brooklyn Transit. The most potent in
fluen.ee in checking the advance in the market
was the weakness of Northern Pacific com
mon, which was ottered in enormous volume
and in spite of a large absorption sold off to
29%. The rumors of differences â  between the
two largest interests In the property, if true.
would involve such grave consequences in the
whole railroad world, and especially among
ntinetal railroads, that the weakness of.
the stock had a strong sympathetic Influence
on the whole list.
The bond market has shown improvement
during the week, especially among ; the specu
lative bonds, \Vlscon6ln Central l.its advanc

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW TORK. Oct. B.â The New York Finan
cier fays this week: The changes in the state
ment of the associated banks i>f New Tork for
the week ending October S can be traced almost
entirely to one or two banks. Of the expansion
of &5.G75.600 in deposits, the National <"ity ac
- for about $7.0Â©<>,000, which was brought
about apparently, by an increase of $4,000,000 in
the banks' specie account and a gain of $3,000,
000 in Its loan*. With these figures taken into
account, the week's changes, so far ai" the re
maining banks are concerned, are not so Im
portant. It If not to be forgotten, however,
that one less bank reports Its clearings this
week, the Tradesmen's having suspended. More
or less of the latter's business has gone into
other Institutions, but there is an elimination
of $3,000,000 in loans and $2,600,000 of deposits
that went to make up the totals last week.
Had these been added to the current statements
loans would have shown a much larger Increase
and deposits would have effected a correspond
ing gain, as would cash and other Items. With
these factb held In view the statement becomes
more favorable than otherwise, for new busi
ness by the other banks was counteracted by
the lo?s <r the Tradesmen's. Practically, of
course, the results are as stated In the totals.
but the inference nf better business, as shown
above, is correct in a limited measure. There
Is nothing In the statement that can be con
strued unfavorably. The cash reserve 1b larger
than for the corresponding periods one and
two years ago and Is Increasing steadily, both
from gold imports ami treasury disbursements.
The loss of $350,000 in legal shows the effect of
interior demands, the banks having shipped
more money than usual lately. Domestic ex
change at leading centers Is quoted lower and
the withdrawals may continue for some time.
Against such losses, however, is the gain from
the sources named Loan Increases, as already
shown, were lower than indicated. They re
flect a very satisfactory condition of business.
All fears of further complications In the money
market must be regarded as at an end. and
even with a continuing demand In the interior,
rates will probably ease off somewhat from
this time on.
Depository banks over the country owe the
treasury large amounts, but the net balances,
deducting the continued disbursements over re.
celpts by the Government, will be replaced to
some extent by new circulation.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. B.â The Evening Post's
London Financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were stagnant and featureless to
day. The settlement In min^s Is to begin on
Monday next, and the settlement In general
securities on Tuesday. Americans were dull
New York Is still buying gold at 77s HHd. The
London market discount rate is 2 13-16 per cent
on expectations of a rise in the German bank
rate on Monday.' It Is reported that the bank
of Austria is lending the bank of Germany

tion for the rumor is that there was a similar
operation about a year ago.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. B.â Wheat showed weakness
Rt the opening. Liverpool failed to respond to
the strength shown by this market yesterday.
On the contrary it 6howed '/4@Vid decline at
the close and this small decline was reflected
by â i'6<SPÂ»c loss in the December price here,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1893.
I that option starting at 62%<gC2?*c. Light sell-
pressure from longs was sufficient to clip
another small fraction from the price a few
minutes after the opening, December selling
at 62%@62%c. This was in "put" prices and
some buying to protect those privileges gave
I a firmer tone to the market and resulted in a
I slow recovery to 63c. Most of the trading of
I the day was confined to the first hour. After
I that transactions were few and far between.
The recent internal revenue department rul
ing that scalpers and others must pay taxes
on all trade transfers appeared to paralyze
trading. The dullness that resulted had a
depressing effect on prices and during the last
hour December dragged around 62% c. The or
dinary news of the day did not receive much
attention. The close was at 62% c for Decem
ber, a loss of He
Corn was burdened by the war tax. The
day's fluctuations were confined to a narrow
jange. but the sentiment among traders rather
favored the selling side. The close was a
shade under yesterday.
Oats suffered with the same affliction as the
other grain.", experiencing hardly sufficient
trade to establish quotations. May lost hie.
Disturbing yellow fever news from the South,
In addition to the stamping out of the scalp
ing element by the Government tax depressed
provisions. Selling In a small way of Ribs
and Pork by packers caused some concession
in prices. The close was* s@loc under yester
day's close.

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS, RAISINS, ETC.
The market seems to be working around Into
better shape, as the trade report more demand.
The New York Commercial, under date of Oc
tober 3. says:
"Additional Inquiry for California dried fruits
gives more life to the market. Raising are
wanted, but dealers are not disposed to place
orders which may not be confirmed, and bold
ers on the coast have ceased to make offer
ings until the association announces its policy
as reganls prices. It Is generally conceded
that an advance of VÂ«e a pound will b-j made
all along the line, but no official confirmation
of this is possible. Consequently trade Is quiet,
virtually almost nothing, owing to the un
certainty which would eurround any deal made
now. Meanwhile demand for forward In
creases, and trade, following October IS, when
the official price announcement Is made, will
be brisk.
"Prunes are In considerable request. De
mand has been Increasing for several days,
and a brisk trade seems probable. The prin
cipal request Is for large sizes, which appear
to be practically unobtainable. Spot stocks
arÂ« held firm because of concentration and
new crop receipts are not especially heavy.
The quality of those received is apparently
satisfactory, except In the matter of sugar,
as has been pointed out before."

COFFEEâ C. E. Blckford'e circular gives the
receipts at this port thus far this year at 126,-
Bt>2 bags, against 130,341 bags during the same
time last year. The sales from first nands were
100,12-1 bags, against 001. The stock on hand
October 1 was 24.315 bags, against 2-J.IOS. Th>>
world's risible supply October 1 was 8.906,240
bags, against 5,973,215 last year. The circular
says :
"The aggregate business of the past month
has been quite satisfactory In view of the gen
erally uninteresting state of this and all dis
tributing markets. Price rather than quality is
governing coffee consumers nowadays, and,
therefore, also those who supply their wants,
and the market presents the anomalistic fea
tures of an active demand, with some degree
of firmness for grades below 10c In value, while
all qualities above are weak in tone and very
â low of movement. So long as serviceable
qualities of sound whole bean coffee can be ob
tained at their present range or from 8c to 10c
this condition will continue, and it must result
In a further contraction of the premiums on
good washed coffees, heretofore paid more for
style than Intrinsic merit, until an adjustment
of values is reached that meets the consumer's
pocket and the laws of supply a.nd demand.
"Crop prospects In Brazil, according to re
cent estimates, point to 8,500,000 bags for the
season of lvi.v Receipts thus far have been
proportionately small, due, It Is said, to bad
weather, but sufficient to again Increase the
world's visible supply by Â£04,906 bags during
September. The New York market rules steady
at 6'Â«, c for Rio No. 7 and VAQVAc for Santos
No. 4.
"To-day's local first-hand stock consists of

TRAVELS Or
MARTIN THARE
BY ALMA S. BEMENDERFER.
ANGELS CAMP.
MARTIN THARE longed to
travel and see the world, and,
above all, to have the adven
tures bound to be encountered.
He had road books by noted
travelers and lay and dreamed of the
time when fortune would favor him.
But Oakwood was a village far away
from any place of interest. One day
while sitting on the sidewalk, neaj
small college, of which the citizens
were wont to boast, he noticed a
dler. valise in hand, walking u>
him. The valise being dxor>~>ed. the
contents were scattered all around.
square box rolled toward
tin. which he picked up. The man
dly told him not to open it. but
Bity got the better. Instant
black ball shot out, and rolling over
the ground marked out paths in all di
rections, and bursting with a loud re
port vanished. Walking over to where
Martin stood, the peddler pointed one
finger at him and naid slowly:
"So, in your reel. less haste to see
what the box i yot loosed the
mystic ball of fate, a treasure beyond
price to me. By so doing you have
laid a charge on me, an unpleasant
duty, noting the paths marked. You, I
believe, wish to travel, see the world
and meet with adventures. It is as
you wish. By reckless haste you have
made it doubly certain. Being a ma
gician, to me is assigned the duty of
laying a charm upon you. and not till
you have met with many adventures
and are heartily tired will it be re
moved."
He bent forward and touched Mar
tin with the empty box. In an in
stant, from a handsome boy he turned
Into a common gray mouse and, glanc
ing at a poo! of water and noting the
change, he was so frightened his sole
Idea was to hide.
Climbing quickly up the side of a
building-, ho j>-:.-iped thruugh an o-pen
window into the sitling-room of the
head professor, who was reading. The
professor, looking up, saw the mouse
and tried to drive it nut. He hit it
â¢with a ruler, whereupon, in a shrill
voice, it said: "Stop that; don't kill
me."
The professor was so surprised that
he jumped backward.
Could it be a mistake? No; thatmouse
could certainly talk. These thoughts
flashed through his mind. Yes, some one
had taught, educated it, and there it
tvas. What a grand and astounding
discovery. He would capture the ro
dent. Having no trap, he. was forced
to make a paper cornucopia and place
it in a corner for a trap.
But the mouse suddenly departed by
the same entrance, and crawling along
a narrow ledge walked in at another
window Into a cla?s room and slipped
Into a book case. A student noticed
him. Once inside, Martin had ample
time to think. A feeling of sadness
came over him. To realize he was
only a mouse, yet be able to talk and
understand was disagreeable. What
ought to be done? A search might be
made!'
Quickly gnawing a hole in a diction
ary he hid there, and later, when a
search was made, no one suspected that
the mouse was in the dictionary, car
ried out by Earl Brown, who, on open
ing it. was surprised to see one jump
nimbly out and climb down to the
street below.
But here Martin was chased by a
dog, and to save his life squeezed into
a pipe, and running along through it
pome distance came to the railroad and
got into a baggage car. Here another
difficulty confronted him. He wished
to travel first class. So he managed
to slip into a passenger car and was
surprised at the people there. They
were all bound on a long journey. Lis
tening he learned they were a party
bound for ihe Klondike. A mighty
idea came to him. Why not go, too?
Being a mouse, was that a practical
reason why he should not travel and
see the world? To pay no fare; just
enjoy himself and see the beauties of
nature.
He resolved to go and at once began
to look at the people, trying to select
pome honest, shrewd looking person
with a sat.-hel. finding this difficult.
He finally decided to travel In the car
and take his chances. He managed to
eet enough to eat, and while hunting

f
around sometimes got into satchels.
Thereby he made a pretty close esti
mate of the company. At last, after
an exciting trip, he reached ban 1-ran
cisco, and later Alaska, being carried
over one of the passes in a pack by a
would-be miner, who, though complain
ing of the weight, never dreamed his
satchel contained a mouse.
Martin passed one season in the
Klondike. " Then he returned home as
a n .use. Traveling over the same
pat}:.- he completed the task the ma
gician had put upon him, and suddenly
resumed his old shape of a teasing,
hievous boy.
WHAT ELSIE
WAS TAUGHT
JT was 'a warm autumn afternoon
and Mrs. White had gone away,
leaving little Elsie home to finish her
lessons. Elsie's mother knew her
little girl disliked very much to
study, and this evening, when she
had been called away to see a sick
friend, her last words to Elsie had been
for her to study her lessons well in her
absence. Elsie had promised she
would, but she was not quite old
enough to know what a wrong thins
it was to break one's word, and no
sooner had her mother gotten out of
sight than she called King, the large
Bhepherd dog, and hurried down to the
orchard, where the rosy-cheeked apples
grew.
Elsie had lived in the country every
summer of her life, and was well ac
quainted with climbing trees. She now
went to the top of a large apple tree,
and picked the best of the luscious fruit
there. She spied a bright-winged but
terfly, and as soon as her tiny feet
reached the ground she began chasing
it, but, failing to catch it. she called
King, and they had a race to the mill
pond and back again to the orchard;
then she sat down to rest. She had not
meant to spend all the evening in play,
but thought ?he could enjoy herself,
then have time for her lessons before
her mother's arrival: but soon her
curly head began to bob, and Elslt for
got her untouched books.
At first there appeared a small fairy,
with a huge book open before her, from
which she was studying diligently:
then another and another, until there
seemed to Elsie to be a thousand of
these small creatures, each with her
book open, and all seamed to be saying,
"Work first, then comes play," over and
over again, until Elsie thought she
would never forget the words. Then
she heard a tinkling of a bell. The
fairies seemed to hear it also, for in an
instant all the books were laid carefully
aside and each fairy stood in line, with
arms folded behind her.
Then a lovely fairy queen appeared,
wtth a diamond crown upon her head.
She raised her wand and touched each
fairy, and her plain clothes fell off,
and each stood there arrayed in a
lovely white dress and bright star on
her head. Then came sounds of soft,
sweet music, and they all began danc
ing and singing, "Work first, then
play." Then the fairy queen arose to
make a speech, but Elsie never heard
what she said, for she felt some one
shaking her arm, and on opening her
eyes she saw her mother, scared and
nervous, bending over her.
"I am bo glad to find you, Elsie. I
thought sure you had got lost."
Elsie then told her mother of her
dream and untouched books. Her
mother kissed her and said, "I am glad
you had that dream. It has taught you
always to work first, then play."
"Yes," said Elsie, "but, mamma, I
wish you had not woke me until I
heard "what the fairy queen said."

back," said Mary. "I must go look for
her." And taking her hat from the peg
she went out of the door. She searched
through the barn, the stable, the
orchards and the cowhouse. She even
peeped into th s brook, to see if Snow
ball cpuld possibly have fallen in and
been drowned, but all her search was
fruitless â no Snowball could she find.
Mary was very sorry to lose her pet
cat. Snowball was a present from her
aunt, and Mary had had her ever since
she was a kitten. Mary called her
Snowball because she was so white, and

mistress and would follow her every

of ever finding Snowball again, when
one day her mother took her to see a
lady named Mrs. Hopewell. Mrs. Hope
well lived some miles distant and Mary
and her mother went in the little spring
carriage. The horses who drew the
carriage were called Bess and Dick,
and as they were very gentle Mary was
allowed to drive them, which was a
thing she liked very much to do. In
the course of the conversation with Mrs.
Hopewell the subject of cats came up.
Mrs. Hopewell said that about a week
ago a forlorn, muddy little white cat
ha.d come to her house and she had
taken it in and kept it ever since.
"Oh," said Mary, quickly, "it must be
my Snowball! Will you please show it
to me, Mrs. Hopewell?"
"Certainly, my dear," said Mrs. Hope-
well; and the lady got the cat and
showed it to Mary.
'Oh, Snowball! Snowball! Have I
really found you i.gain?" said Mary, in
delight. For, sure enough, it was Snow
ball. Snowball seemed just as glad to
be found as Mary was to find her, for
she rubbed her head against Mary and
purred the sweetest song she knew.
Mary was very glad to have found her
pet cat again and she went home a
very happy little girl.

LITTLE ARNA AND
HER SELFISHNESS
BY ESTELLE BAKER.
ARNA never believed in fairies.
She thought it was a silly beliefâ
that fairies lived and ate. drank,
slept, danced, spoke and sang, as
the pictures in the story books
showed them to be doing.
Arna was 10 years old last March,
and was in the fifth grade, although
she is now promoted into the sixth, tone
is a very pretty little girl, with dark
eyes and brown curls that glistened
like gold under the rays of the sun;
long golden eyelashes and cream-ana
peaches cc-mplexion. Mamma's only
child she had been spoiled and in
dulged, until, as one of her little school
mates remarked, "Arna Whitley would
be awfully nice if she wasn't so stuck
up and selfish." That was just the
trouble with Arnaâ she was so selnsn
that she made about as many enemies
as she did friends. Arna always learned
her lessons well. There was not another
girl in the class like Arna Whitley that
could get a "perfect" paper in the
arithmetic examination. And no one
could beat her in grammar and spell
ing She always carried home a report
card with '-excellent" or "perfect" in
scholarship and "perfect" in deport
ment. She would not whisper or turn
around and one time when the teacher
stepped out into the hall for a few
minutes and the boys and girls took
advantage of her absence to have a.
'"good time" Arna was a model pupil,
never turning around or even raising
her eyes from her book. I am inclined,
however, to believe that she did this
not for the principle of the thing but
for the name and honor and praise
forthcoming. Of course she naturally
became the teacher's pet.
For all this Arna was , selfish and
proud Although she shared her candy
and gum with the rest of the girls and
lent them a pencil err her slate sponge,
she never puts herself out for them,
and made no effort to assist others or
to make others really happy.
One hot summer day at noontime,
when Anna was eating her lunch out
in the shadiest part of the school yard,
a little girl came up crying, with two
others leading her. She was a mite of
a thing, with big misty blue eyes,
filled with tears. The larger girls
asked Arna if she would take the little
one home. The little one lived a few
blocks away from Arna and Arna lived
a block from school. Now. Arna had a
most delicious lunch, which her mam
ma had put up fcrr her in a cute little
basket, shaped like a tin pail.
"Give her some of your lunch," whis
pered some one in her ear.
"Don't you do it. She had no busi
ness to lose her lunch," whispered an
other voice.
"Do you think you can take her?"
asked Maggie, the largest of the girls.
"Don't you do any such thing. Let
some one else do it " persisted the last
voice.
"Indeed, I will not," snapped Arna,
tossing her curls away from her fore
head. "I cannot be bothered with her.
Let son.c one else take her."
The little child's Hps trembled and
she cried still harder. "'I want some
thing to eat," and she glanced at
Arna's basket and its tempting con
tents. Arna felt an inclination to give
her 6omething, but the evil voice whis
ered again into her ear:
"You are tired from your school work
and you need it more than she does.
Don't you give her any. She can go to
her home and get all she wants."
"No," repeated Arna, "some one else
must take her," and she hugged her
lunch basket tighter than ever.
That night a fairy came to see Arna,
who was at first sound asleep, but, be
ing a light sleeper, the sound of the
step? of the fairy awoke her, and she
instantly rose on her elbow to see who
it was. To her surprise it seemed to be
morning. The sun vainly tried to pierce
through the shutters, and through the
open door she heard the sizzling of
meat frying and the singing of the
teakettle in the kitchen. It was plain
that she was late for breakfast that
morning. She jumped out of bed to
dress herself. Suddenly a beautiful
fairy stood before her. She was quite
tall and slender. Her eyes were black
and pier ing. She wore a long, loose
dress with short sleeves and high neck,
made of some brown and silk stuff,
caught at the waist with a girdleâ but
had no wings on her shoulders.
"Who are you?" asked the surprised
Arna, as she curiously, half-admiring
ly, half-fearfully scanned her visitor.
"I am Selfishness," replied the fairy,
"and I am to be your companion for
the present." Her voice was low, but
clear and convincing. "I am told you
are much like me, and so I am going to
stay with you; go with you wherever
you go and see and hear, feel and know
all that you do."
"Why, how funny," cried Arna, "and
what is mamma going to do?"
"I am going to take your mother's
place while she is away. She will be
back in a week or so." Arna said noth
ing, but continued to dress herself in
great haste.
"Is it late?" she asked.
"Yes, about a quarter to nine," re
plied Selfishness.
"Oh, my!" cried Arna, "isn't it late!"
and she buttoned her shoes in great
haste.
"You will find your breakfast out
there cooked for you," said the visitor,
"your father cooked it for you."
"My father cooked it for me!" cried
Arna.
"Yes, your father, of course," replied
the visitor, pettishly. "You surely don't
expect me to do your work for you."
"You said you would take mamma's
place," said Arna, "and papa shall not
do our work."
"Then why don't you?" asked Selfish
ness, with a curious sweetness in her
voice.
" 'Tisn't my work, snapped Arna.
Instantly the light flashed in the eyes
of Selfishness and her voice grew
hoarse and harsh. "I shall not do it,
either," she replied. .
Arna was now eating her breakfast,
or rather, gobbling it down as fast na
she could, for she was in ganger of be
ing late.
"Selfishness, get my hat," she said.
But Selfishness wouldn't stir.
"Selfishness, are you not mean?" and
the face of the visitor grew angry.
"I will not get yuur hat; you can get
it yourself."
And Arna had to run into the nail
and get her hat herself.
"I wish you would tie up my shoe
lacing and fix the back of my dress. It : s
all thready."
Selfishness merely turned up her noss
and it fused to do any of these things.
"Won't you get my lunch basket,
then?" she asked? "And my speller
and mental arithmetic there on the
sitting room table. Please get them,
too."
"I won't, either. Do it yourself. I m
not your servant." replied Selfishness
with peculiar hauteur. So Arna had
to get them herself, and went into the
sitting room for them. When she came
back she found Selfishness already
dressed.
"Where are you going?" Arna asked.
"With you to school." replied Selfish*
ness. Then they started for school,
both on the run.
Arna reached school just in time to
get in her line, without her teacher
knowing of her tardiness. Her line was
just marching in. Selfishness pushed
her aside and went ahead of her.
Arna's wrath was kindled. "You
mean old Selfishness," she cried, "you
had no business to do that. My place
is before you." But Selnshness was
fighting for another girl's place, and
while they were talking in a loud tone
about it Arna was surprised to hear
her teacher's voice: "Arna Whitely,
please step out of the line."
Arna was much surprised, but she
obeyed her teacher's order and stepped
over to a bench and sat down. The
girls looked back and giggled at her
discomfort. When the tinea had all
marched in the teacher came to Arna
and said: "Arna, what made you be
have so naughtily?"
"It wasn't I; it was Selfishness,"
replied Arna, hotly.
"Yes, my dear, it was your own sel
fishness, and I am glad to see you ac
knowledge you're wrong."
When Arna came in her room she
found the scholars all whispering, and
talking about and pointing at Selfish
ness, who L-^d ime in and sat down
in a vacant seat, the owner of which
would soon eoi.-t.'. She had taken an
other girl's book and, crossing her feet,
was humming to herself. Arna went
up to her and corrected her, but Sel
fishness replied that she "wasn't doing
things to suit everybody else."
When the teacher came in Selfishness
was busy with her lesson and the
teacher did not notice her. When the
time came to recite Selfishness had her
hand up for every question. The
teacher called Selfis'-.ness Arna and did
not seem to notice Arna herself, al
though Arna frantically waved her
hand back and fort- trying to attract
Miss Brown's attention.
Even when the other girls knew their
lessons Selfishness was always angry
If she wasn't calle<_ on to answer every
single question, and when the other
girls tried to .isper to her she would
proudly turn away her head and say to
Arna. "See what a good girl I am."
At recess the girls didn't appear to
notice Arna, althou''- she passed in
front of them time after time. She saw
her old "toadies" were very nice to Sel
fishness' face, but, oh, how they talk
ed behind her back!
When it was time to go in and all
were in the schoolroom again Selfish
ness was w.rse than ever. It was gram
mar examination. Mildred Adams' pa
per wasn't ruled, and the teacher, in a
treat hurry, gave her a minute to rule
it nicely. Now. Selfishness didn't have
hers ruled and she had taken 1. Idred's
ruler to rule it with. Sh- had t!
cessary ruling on, and Mildred was in
despair at her blank paper. But Sel
fishness, desiring extra credits to the
loss of Mildred, kept the ruler for her
own use, and the teacher would not
wait for the other erirl, who thus lost
the entire examination.
At noontime, when Arna looked for
her lunch that she to!d Selfishness to
put up, she found that Selfishness had
taken it. After quite a hunt she found
her in a corner of the yard surrounded
by all her f iends, eating her lunch.
"Where's my lunch?" demanded
Arna.
"Humph! I guess I'm not going to
give you any lunch, and especially any
of this, when you live only abl k from
school," said Selfishness.
Afternoon passed. Selfishness was as
bad as ever. She wanted to read all
the lessons and write down all the
home work on the board, and --'keel
when Miss Brown -aye it to Lucy
Forbes to -i'
When Arna reached home she found
her father there. He was ill and had
come home earlier than usual. He did
not seem to see Arna. He called to Sel
fishness: "Arna, please make me some
strong coffee and toast." Selfishness
was getting ready to practice on the
piano, and she scowled. "My teacher
told me to learn my lesson," she an
swered, impatiently.
Arna was sho^ke."! She rushed up
to her father and said "Papa, papa,
I'm Arna. She's elfishness, not Arna.
I am Arna."
But her father did not seem to hear
h . and Arna cried. In a ver- un
gracious and sulky ood Selfishness
made the coffee and toast. She knew
Mr. Whitley didn't like anything- but
the best coffee, and that was kept on
the top shelf and she felt too lazy to
get up after it so she made the drink
out of the family cnÂ«rÂ«Â»fc She burned
the toast and then scraped the black
ened part off very poorly. She sulked
all the more ten Mr. Whitley pushed
it aside and said he didn't pare to eat.
Then Arna tried differ- nt tact'os.
She spoke gently and kindly to Selfish
ness. About sunset Selfishness came
and, kneeling at Arna's feet, b
her pardon and told her to profit by
her (Selfishness 1 ) experience, and
tnen -- s he faded like a specter, and
Arna never saw her again.
And Arna is now a generous little
girl, and although people wonder why
she is so changed in disposition, they
love her much, and she has no ene
mies, for her selfishness is âme.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
A' hearing will be held before a notary
public in Sonora on November 2 as to the
mineral or non-mineral character of a
long list of parcels of Government land
in Tuolumne County. They have been re
turned by the Surveyor General as a min
eral, but the department may classify
them as agricultural. The Sonora Union-
Democrat sounds a warning that all these
lands lie in mineral belts; that landhold
ers are after them, and that hundreds of
quartz and placer claims will be lost to
miners unless the miners look up the
lands and appear with evidence of their
mineral character. Attention is likewise
called to another advertised list of lands
In that county, which have been selected
by the State as indemnity school lands.
It Is asserted that they are all mineral,
but they will be declared non-mineral un
less protests are filed at the Land Office
at Stockton before October 27. These in
stances are but illustrative of the fact
that all through the mining regions of the
State only vigilance and effort on some
body's part will save great areas of min
eral land to prospectors and miners. The
great problem, of course, is that connect
ed with the railroad lands and which the
pending mineral lands bill seeks to solve.
But there is also a great amount of pub
lic land which is chiefly mineral, but
which will steadily go into the agricul
tural list if all the active Interest dis
played Is devoted to getting it there.
Practically all the ground on which
Sonora stands was dug over and washed
for gold in early times. A short time
ago an old-timer Informed Jacob Meyer
that his garden had escaped the sluice
boxes of the early fifties and that there
was probably gold under hie onion beds.
Mr. Meyer is not a miner, but after sev
eral weeks of thought he concluded that
he needed a well anyway and that he
would sink to bedrock for water. If
he found gold so much the better. He
dugr and found nuggets as big as his
thumb. He dug- further and tried to drift
out the rich gravel but the water drove
him out. He was more lucky than Dow
of Dow's Flat. He thankfully hauls up
the cool water during the dry spell and
wonders how he can get rid of the rest of
the cussed stuff. There will be a re
spectable mining plant in Mr. Meyers'
garden next summer.
The directors of the Mountain Copper
Company have declared an Interim divi-
dend of 2s fid per share. The circular
announcing it gives this information con
cerning: the great and rapidly expanding
operations of this company in Shasta
County :
"I luring the first six months of the year
108,000 tona of ore were extracted from the
mine, averaging 7.53 per cent of copper.
The stacks in process of calcteatlon ami
local treatment in California were much
Increased, as only 72.000 tons of ore were
smelted, producing u29 tons of copper in
matte, which has been sent to the New-
Jersey works to be refined. Thr deliv
ery of fine copper from these works dur
lng th>- period was 3980 tons, of which
â  re marketed, the balance be
ing still In process of treatment for the
separation of its gold and silver."
Louis Blandlng of Sonora writes that
the reported discovery of molybdenum
in Kern County, noted in these columns
recently, was not the first find of this
rare metal In this State. He says that
eight years ago a three-foot vein was
found in Tuolumne County. It is molyb
denite, the sulphide of the metal. The
molybdate of lead Is found In a mine
miles from Sonora.

that the quarry was leased for ten years

eration it looks an If the marble quarry
will be opened on a large scale, and If
so, the benefit to Columbia and the coun
ty at large cannot be overestimated.â
Tuolumne Independent.
With the early rains comes the begin
ning of the end of the dry season that
has been such a great handicap to mining
operations. As soon as the water sup
ply is renewed hundreds of stamps will
go to dropping again and development
operations will be renewed. Concerning
the prospects of Tuolumne County the
Sonora Union-Democrat says:
"And when the mining industry does
resume in full blast it will be on an aug
mented scale. Prospectors for months
past have been persistently traversing
the two mineral belts, and the conse
quence has been that many locations are
now held under bond by men with capi
tal who are only too anxious to risk their
dollars in development work. Among the
already equipped properties many have
Increased the capacity of their crushing
plants, and almost all will have larger
payrolls both underground and on top
than ever before. It is expected that
when the rains have been sufficient to
give enough water just for panning pur-
I poses a great number of mines will
be discovered throughout the vast dis
tricts that have been burned over by
forest fires the past summer, and which
laid bare thousands of acres of ground
that for years past have been covered by
impenetrable underbrush."
A discovery of "natural coke" has been
made in Gennessee Valley, Plumas Coun
ty. Prospectors found a vein 15 feet thick
of coal formation. The same formation
was again tapped at a distance of a mile.
T. Price & Sons, who were given some of
the pieces for examination, say the sam
j pies had been subjected to heat at some
i previous period, converting it into natural
coke, and that the article is of commer
cial value. A test of 1000 pounds in the
I Greenville foundry showed its heating
i qualities to be but four minutes short of
the best Eastern coal.â Mining and Scien
tific Press.
It has been published in the Redding
papers that the cyanide plant at Harri
son Gulch Is to be done away with and
replaced by machinery for roasting ore.
This is exactly wrong, and we are in
formed that the roasters are to bo used
! to facilitate the work of the cyanide pro
! cess in saving the gold from the tailing's
; that have passed over the plates in the
i mill. The ore is reduced to a sand by
i roasting triat Is much more easily handled
by the cyanide treatment for extracting
the remaining gold, and It is claimed that
in this way So per cent of the gold can be
saved.â Redding Searchlight.
The Wedge mine has just struck an as
tonishingly rich vein of ore at a depth of
350 feet In the west drift. It is peculiar
looking, nothing like it ever having been
found In the camp. It is stratified and
ribbony in appearance and issulphuretore.
It will mill J2OO per ton. The Buckboard
mine, just beyond the Stringer district
southwest, is developed into a fine prop
erty. The ledge is very wide, running
live or six dollars all through with
streaks of rich ore up to $100 per ton. The
shaft is down 126 feet with drifts on both
sides. Over at the Meredith mine in the
slate range is one of the best and thor
oughly equipped quartz mills in the State.
It Is the property of the Meredith Min
ing Company of San Jose. They have a
water pipe line three miles long. Some
ore shipped to Selby at San Francisco
returned $215 per ton and altogether they
have taken out over $25,000.â Randsburg
Miner.
The Coralle quartz mlnÂ« in Calaveras
County has been bonded to a Chicago
company represented by E. A. Converse.
Development work will begin immediate
ly, and as coon as sufficient ore is blocked
out a small mill will be erected.
An El Dorado County correspondent of
the Mining and Scientific Press writes as
follows concerning current developments
of the great State resources of that re
gion: "The Chili Bar slate quarry has
been bonded to J. Hardy, who Is in Lon
don organizing a company for the exten
sive operation of the property. He writes
encouragingly of his efforts. Work has
begun on a third slate quarry by W.
Cummings & Son within a mile of: Placer
ville." v
