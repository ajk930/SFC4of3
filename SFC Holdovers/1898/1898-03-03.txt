The attitude of Secretary Long is
cited as peculiarly perplexing, while
some of his utterances are regarded
as indiscreet and unnecessary. A
considerable number of men in Con
gress who are opposed on general i
principles to any increase of the
military force, except for an emer- i
gency, are perfectly willing to vote
â whatever is needed either to avert .
war or to prepare for it if it is threat- ;
ened. Others* who strongly favor
the needed increase of our defensive
force, even if danger is not immi
nent, do not feel that they can jus
tify their insistence upon immediate
emergency action if the administra- j
tion is not prepared to sustain re- j
quests that have been made by the '
departments.
The policy of mystification is dis
arming those who want to do the !
patriotic thing and places them at
the mercy of the small but strong
opposition. . The special legislation
to provide for two additional artil- j
lery regiments and for authority for
the Navy Department to enlist 1500
men necessary to man the vessels in j
reserve at League Island could not be !
hung up as it is, it is claimed, if the
administration would stand firmly
by the proposition that the situation
requires such action.
It is not believed by those who
think preparation should be made j
that it i 6 necessary tor the adminis
tration to make any sensational ut
terance, but only that requests made
by the departments should not be
discredited by the heads of the de
partments themselves, as Secretary j
Long discredited his own department j
yesterday. Dignified silence on the
part of members of the administra
tion on the subject of the Maine dis-
I aster and private assurance that the j
measures asked for are really needed ;
and desired would, it is believed, in
sure the administration all the as
sistance required from Congress in
preparation for an emergency.
The belief is very generally held
in Congress that steps should be
taken promptly to man whatever

guns and fortifications we have along
the coast and to train the men to
manipulate them. One of the Re
publican members of the House Mili
tary Committee said to-day that the
attitude of officers of the adminis
tration was absolutely bewildering,
and he added that the declaration of
Mr. Long with respect to the re
sponsibility of Spain for the Maine
explosion was uncalled for and un
wise.
The chairman of this committee,
who is in charge of the artillery bill,
said he was going to try to get action
on the measure as soon as the Loud
bill was disposed of by the House,
but in order to do so he would have
to get the assistance of the Commit
tee on Rules, and that had not yet
been secured.
Representative J. Hamilton Lewis
of Washington proposes to introduce
a resolution in the House disapprov
ing of Mr. Long's discussing with
the public, in advance, the report of
the Board of Inquiry. He will prob
ably not be able to get consideration
for such a resolution, for, though
members of the House of both parties
criticize the Secretary, the general
feeling is that it will not improve
the situation for the House to agi
tate the question.
There has been some comment on
the fact that members of the minor
ity who were formerly so active in
their efforts to get recognition of
Cuba are now silent and make no
effort to do anything to weaken the
hands of the administration in an
ticipation of trouble. A number of
leading Democrats who were asked
about the matter to-day said that
they did not think it proper for them
to add in any way to the statement
that they would be ready to do what
ever might be necessary for the de
fense of the honor and safety of the
Government, but that while the ad
ministration was awaiting the re
port of the Board of Inquiry, and
until the President had had time to
act, they did not feel they should
take the initiative. Nor did they
think that while the Maine question
was pending was a time to be agi
tating a belligerency resolution.
To-day guns are being shipped
from the Washington Navy Yard
gun shops to New York, where they
are to be stored in readiness for the
equipment of the auxiliary cruisers
should it be necessary to take them
from the merchant marine for naval
service. Forty-eight 6-inch guns and a
number of 5-inch were being loaded
onto the cars for shipment this morn-

MADRID, March 2.â The
New York correspondent
dP " Correspondence"
takes the responsibility
of cabling that General
Lee has telegraphed to
the United States Gov
ernment that the explo
sion of the Maine was
intentional. The same
correspondent adds:
"This confirms my
statement that that offi
cial inspired the recent
campaign in the sensa

THE THEORY OF
INSIDE EXPLOSION
IS ABANDONED
Small Doubt the Higher Officials
Believe an Outside Force
Wrecked the Maine.
NEW YORK. March 2.â
The Herald's Washington cor
respondent telegraohs:
Though no' official informa
tion has been received from the
court of inquiry as to the char
acter of the evidence it has ob
tained, and though none is ex
pected until the final report is
prepared, the belief in adminis
tration circles that the Maine
was destroyed by an external ex
plosion continues to gain
strength.
The Herald's dispatch from
Havana indicating that the
Maine's back was broken by
the explosion, the keel being
found in two pieces, the nearest
ends of which are separated by
a distance of from two and a
half to three feet, has tended
to strengthen the conviction that
the ship was not destroyed by an
internal accident.
No official information as to this dis
covery has yet been received, but when
taken in connection with Ensign Pow
elson's testimony as to the finding of
the keel plates from the double bottoms
on top of the wreckage it is regarded as
the strongest evidence that the primary
explosion which destroyed the ship
came from below her keel, though
some of the powder in her magazines
may have subsequently exploded and
still further wrecked her. That the
keel of the ship was driven upward by
the disrupting force which was powerful
enough to break the keel and force
some of the plates through the ship
with escaping gases of the explosion is
looked upon as conclusive. Naval offi
cers generally believe that had the ex
plosion been wholly within the ship the
gases, following the line of least resist
ance, would have gone upward*, and
that their downward force, being exert
ed from above the keel, could not have
broken it this way and carried pieces
of plates to the top of the wreck.
That it is not regarded as certain that
the ship was not destroyed by a mine
is shown by the fact that the adminis
tration is investigating the question as
to whether or not there were mines in
Havana harbor.
The Spanish Government sent large
quantities of high explosives and other
material for mines to PFavana several
months ago during the time General
Weyler was in command. Whether
these mines were actually put down
and where they were placed, if at all. are
questions which the authorities are
much interested. in solving.
Some excitement was caused here to
day by the persistent rumor that Con
sul-General Lee had cabled the State
Department that he bad discovered in

dubitable evidence that there was a plot
to destroy the Maine. This rumor could
not be confirmed. Assistant Secretary
of State Day declared that he had re
ceived nothing whatever from Consul-
General Lee on this subject.
There is no doubt, as heretofore
stated in the Herald, that Consul-Gen
eral Lee has informed the State Depart
ment that it is his opinion that the
Maine was blown up by an exterior
agency and that he has supported his
belief by circumstantial evidence.
The authorities here do not admit
they have any idea that such evidence
can be found.
Official expressions of belief that the
Maine incident can be settled by dip
lomatic means have tended to relieve
the tension somewhat in Washington,
but the administration is still preparing
for war with all the resources at its
command.
It is not believed in official circles
that these preparations tend to in
crease in any way the danger of hostili
ties. It is thought that they may serve,
on the other hand, to make war less
probable.
Whether that be true or not. the ad
ministration considers the possibilities
such as to make it an imperative duty
to put the country in as thorough prep
aration as possible to meet any emer
gency that may arise, either on account
of the Maine disaster or of some un
foreseen complication.
President McKinley and his advisers
are moving as quietly as possible in
making their preparations, for the
double purpose of not unduly alarming
public opinion in the United States over
the matter, which they hope to settle
peaceably, and of not appearing to Spain
to have prejudiced the case of the
Maine without waiting for the result of
the court of inquiry.

HAVANA, March 2.â
The situation in Havana
has become decidedly more
alarming dtwing the last
twenty-four hours. The ar
rival of the Vizcaya has
aroused all the latent en
thusiasm, and last night the
city was ready for an out
break of any kind. The
officials at the palace were
really more alarmed than
the foreign residents, as
they did not know what di
rection the demonstration
that seemed imminent might
take. There were a few
cries of "Muerte Blanco!"
heard on the streets, but the
chorus was "Viva Espana !"
"Viva Weylerl"
Orders were quickly is
sued to suppress demonstra
tions of any kind. Extra
police had been ordered on
duty early in the day, but
when the great crowds gath
ered to greet the Vizcaya
refused to disperse the police
force was doubled, and at 9
o'clock still more were or
dered out.
By taking these precau
tionary measures peace was
maintained, several attempts
at parade were frustrated
and in one case the ac
tion of the police put a
stop to riot. This occurred
a couple of blocks from the
cable office, and was begun
by a number of sailors and
a body of unarmed volun
teers. It was of little im
portance in itself, but in the
present condition of affairs
might easily have been the
spark to fire the magazine
of pent-up malignity. To
day the temper of the city
is quiet, but sullen.
I know positively that the
authorities greatly fear the
effect of the arrival of the
Oqueudo, which it is ex
pected will give the people,
already anxious, an oppor
tunity to riot.

in Cuba. .. - -.:. â  ?;v*' : .
General Weyler returned this morning to Madrid and I saw him

of which caused the Maine explosion. .?.-.; : :â¢ : â¢ .]â¢
General Weyler said : "You may cable, using my name with
my full authority and desire, that I deny most emphatically there
being any foundation whatever for the reports published in the
American press that I placed any mines or torpedoes in the harbor
of Havana. Nor did I withdraw any papers relating to such plans,
none existing. It is totally absurd that any one knowing the Spanish
military organization should give credit to such a foolish idea. My
defensive preparations were confined to mounting large caliber artil

"From all mouths, from

forth the same cry: 'At last

"We do now what we

afternoon to work on the
wreck of the Maine. General

explosion. This board will

it is intended to offset the
effect of the findings of the
American board.
Palace officials who last
week inspired the report that
the American Board of In
quiry would surely report
that the explosion was acci
dental have changed their
course and now declare that
the Maine was destroyed by
an explosion from the out
side, in no way holding the
Spanish Government re
sponsible. It is believed
here that the Spanish in
quiry will attempt merely to
establish that.
Captain Sigsbee continues to refuse
to discuss anything connected with the
disaster, but it is known he believes the
court of inquiry will be ready to report
as soon as it is convenient for the ad
ministration to receive the findings.
Were this not the case he does not be

The divers hope to clear away the
debris of the wreck to-day so as to per

bodies.

morning the wrecking tug I. J. Merritt,

to-day: It may be some time before the
wreckers can make sufficient progress
to allow the divers to recover the group
of dead still imprisoned under the many
tons of twisted steel and iron in the
body of the wreck.
The Havana newspapers are devoting
an unusually large amount of space to
Washington and to the alleged views of
Pre-i<lcnt McKinley, Secretary Long
and Secretary Gage.
Father Chidwick last night declared
his belief that it would now be im
possible to recover all the bodies. He
thinks it doubtful whether more than

the future.
A report has been received of the
landing of a very large expedition: al

EVIDENCE ALL
TENDS ONE WAY
Naval Officers Certain
That a Mine Blew Up
the Maine.
Opinions at Havana Are That
the Board Will So
Declare.
Spaniards Have Been Given Permis
sion to Make an Independent
Investigation.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
HAVANA, March 2.â Without adding
unnecessarily to the Hood of surmises,
conjectures and prophecies concerning
the finding of the Court of Inquiry, it
is fair to say that, as a mater of fact,
most of the naval officers here and at
Key West incline to the opinion that
the court will find that the disaster to
the Maine was caused by the explosion
of a floating submarine mine under Ihe
port side of the ship, forward. Opin
ions differ as to whether the mine was
made of high explosives, such as wet
and dry gun cotton, or ordinary gun
powder.
Opinions agree, not only as to the ex
istence of mines in the harbor, but also
that this one was laid purposely near
the buoy where foreign vessels were
directed to moor, and was fired from
an electric battery on shore.
It is believed barely possible that the
explosion of the mine was the result
of carelessness or ignorance of Spanish
officers in charge of the mine station
keys, when testing the circuit, but the
latter supposition is not felt to be prob
able. It is further regarded as settled
by the evidence before the court that
the port side of the hull forward was
completely blown to pieces, and that
the only explosion on the Maine, except
for isolated cases of fixed ammunition,
was that of 2000 pounds of saluting
powder, stored forward, and of which
no trace can be found.
These views are gathered from offi
cers who talk with great reserve and
only upon the assurance that their
identity will never be revealed. The
fact remains that only the members of
the court of inquiry know all the testi
mony elicited, and no one is authorized
to make public matters in advance of
the final judgment.
A great deal of surprise was ex
pressed by Americans here at learning
that the Spanish divers were to be
permitted to make an examination of
the wreck of the Maine, especially as
it was also said American naval officers
would give such divers all consistent
facilities and would throw no obstacles
ip. the way of a thorough submarine
inspection. It was not at first under
stood â as it came to be later â that the
Spanish search was to be entirely in
dependent, and while it was being
made the American investigation would
proceed under Captain Sigsbee's super
vision. As understood here, the Spanish
request, made immediately after the
disaster, for a Joint investigation, was
profcnptly refused at Washington, but
after ' a Cabinet consultation it was
agreed that the Spaniards had a moral
and international right to discover the
cause of the wreck for themselves If
possible.
Therefore, permission for an inde
pendent examination was granted, on
the ground, as understood here, that it
could not be refused to a friendly power
in her own harbor. That the permis
sion was not accorded until after the
Court of Inquiry had finished its work
here and gone to Key West is regarded
as significant. It opens a wide field for
speculation.
Some assert that the court now has
no objection to a Spanish inquiry, for
one of two reasons: Either the court
has sufficient evidence already of acci
dent or malice â evidence that cannot be
controverted by the Spaniards â or,
after a diligent search, the mystery re
mains as deep as ever, and the court
does not think the Spaniards will reach
a conclusion where the Americans have
failed. Of course, all this refers princi
pally to Inspection of parts of the ship
other than the hull. Until the guns,
decks, engines and debris of all kinds
have been removed and the mud has
been pumped from the hull, it cannot
be examined thoroughly by any one.
Some good authorities think it will be
necessary to build a cofferdam around
the wreck, piles being driven, etc.
WILL CARRY SUPPLIES
TO RECONCENTRADOS.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â The de
cision of the Navy Department to send
two ships to Cuba with supplies for
the suffering reconcentrados caused
some commotion in official circles to
day, until the real purport of the visit
of the ships came out. The cruiser
Montgomery and the gunboat Nashville
were selected for the purpose and or
ders were sent to Admiral Sicard to
put them into shape for the required
service.
It is explained at the Navy Depart
ment that this action was taken at the
instance of the Cuban Relief Associa
tion, organized through the etforts of
the State Department for the relief of
the non-combatants in Cuba. It was
represented to the department that
distress prevails among the people in
the vicinity of Sagua la Grande and
Matanzas, on the northern coast of the
island, and that considerable difficulty
is experienced in sending supplies there
because of the infrequent visits of the
merchant ships. On this account and
because of the immediate demand for
supplies at the points indicated the of
ficers of the association requested the
Secretary of the Nayy to authorize the
use of one or more warships at Key
West in the transportation of food
supplies contributed by the charitable
people of the United States in response
to the appeals of President McKinley
and Secretary Sherman.
Secretary Long conferred with the
President on the subject, and it was
decided to comply with the request.
The Montgomery and the Nashville
were selected as the most suitable for
the service, and the necessary orders
were dispatched to Admiral Sicard. The
Montgomery will go to Matanzas and
the Nashville to Sagua la Grande, with
the understanding that they will re
main in those ports only long enough
to deliver the supplies to" the agents of
the association for distribution where
they will do the most good. Although
the mission assigned to the warships
will take both withio a short distance
of Havana, estimated from two to
four hours, it is stated that neither ves
sel will visit the Cuban capital.

THE LAST
MUSTER OF
THE CREW
Survivors of the Maine
Before the Court
of Inquiry.
Maimed and Bandaged Officers
and Seamen Lined Up and
Questioned as to the Dis
aster at Havana.
KEY WEST.FIa., March 2.â The naval
Court of Inquiry has practically fin
ished its work in Key West, or at lat
est will do so to-morrow. The pre
diction made in these dispatches before
the board left Havana, that the pro*
ceedings here would not occupy more
than three or four days has proved ac
curate. The precise time for the court's
return to Havana is not yet fixed, but
not unlikely it will be to-morrow after
noon or on Friday.
Captain Sampson and Judge Advocate
Marix, when I asked them to-day, both
professed the most profound ignorance
as to the details of the court's future
movements. The departure for Ha
vana yesterday, however, of Naval
Constructor Hoover, who came from
League Island to make a special in
spection of the wreck, and the fact that
Carpenter Holmes of the Maine's crew
received orders and left here for Ha
vana hurriedly last night on the Plant
Line steamer, makes it appear like the
court will find that evidence of im
portance has been secured on reassemb
ling at Havana.
Formal proceedings of the court at
Key West closed this afternoon with
the most picturesque scene witnessed
since it convened. All the surviving
officers and men of the Maine whosf
condition made their presence possi
ble were mustered before the Court of
Inquiry in Key West Marine Barracks,
to comply with one of the naval regu
lations governing such bodies. The pro
cedure was really of a formal charac
ter only, but one of great interest. This
ceremony is indicated by the naval
code, and as illustrated in the case of
the Court of Inquiry following the loss
of the Kearsarge, which perhaps most
nearly parallels the case of the Maine
in our recent naval history, is as fol
lows: fr
The captain of tÂ»e lost ship, in the
presence of the entire shin's company,
is called upon to read a statement giv
ing his version of the disaster. He is
asked by the court whether he has any
charges of negligence or dereliction of
duty to make against officers or crew.
The officers and crew are then called
upon in turn to state in the court's
presence whether any one of them
has any such charge to make, or
knows anything bearing upon the sub
ject matter of the investigation and not
previously elicited.
This is the usual course of procedure,
but in the present case all precedents
were necessarily violated to some ex
tent, and the muster presented unique
features. Captain Sigsbee is still in
Havana, and of course could not be
present, nor could his executive officer,
Lieutenant Commander Wainwright.
The muster in the Marine Barracks was
of itself unusual, such formalities gen
erally being conducted on â¬he ship's
deck.
The proceedings this afternoon were
as exclusive as have been all other de
liberations of the court, but the scene
witnessed when the muster was com
plete was without precedent. Here al
together, with only a few exceptions,
were the men who had passed through
that awful ordeal and lived. As the
marines and blue jackets lined up as
if fur inspection not a few showed
bandaged heads, swathed hands or
arms hanging helplessly in slings.
There was Fireman John Pa nek, tall
and fine looking. He has lost two fing
ers, and his career in the navy is end
ed, but he looks as game as any man
in the ship's company, with the white
sling in which he carried his maimed
hand hung over his neat blue jacket.
There, too, was Apprentice Dressier,
cheerful and chipper, though he can
barely mumble his answors through the
heavy roll of bandages that hold in
place a fractured Jaw, nnd limps pain
fully from a shattered kneecap.
The irfficers all stood Ei'ont Bud erect
as if on rarade, but aj for theL rai
ment the party was suggestive of Fal
staff's army. Only a few were in uni
form appropriate to their rank, for only
a few have uniforms of any kind. Lieu
tenant of Marines Catlin appeared re
splendent in trousers, negligee shirt and
polo cap. Passed Assistant Engineer
Bowers was conspicuous in bicycle
breeches, tan shoes and golf stockings,
while Lieutenant Blow, who lost in the
wreck nearly all his personal belong
ings, including some valuable bronze
and a watch, watch chain and seal,
which were invaluable as family heir
looms, nevertheless contrived to appear
in a neat fielding suit of black tnat
gave him the appearance of a prosper
ous banker or broker rather than a
naval officer. There, too, was Marine
Orderly Anthony, whose cool report to
Captain Sigsbee immediately after the
explosion, "Captain,. I have to report
the ship blown up and afire," has al
ready become historic. This was prob
ably the last muster ever to be held by
the gallant officers and crew of the
Maine.
On Friday all the enlisted men able
to be removed will go North. The offi
cers are only waiting the department's
orders. In another week most of these
gallant fellows who together laced
death will be scattered, never again to
answer the same roll call.
This morning's session of the court
was devoted to the revision of the tes
timony of the larpe number of witnesses
heard yesterday. A few trifling cor
rections were made. Then came the
final muster of this afternoon. Of the
future no man can speak authorita
tively. The session in Havana may not
be a long- one â prvbably will not be
unless there are weighty reasons for
delay in the committee's report
LAW AS LAID DOWN
BY BRITISH PRESS.
LONDON, March 3.â The Daily Tele
graph says editorially this morning:
"No sane American could believe that
the Spanish Government had any hand
in exploding the Maine, and vindictive
damages could only be demanded on
the ground that Spain was guilty of
connivance, or that the Havana author
ities were negligent beyond the border
line of criminality. Neither of these
hypotheses does it seem possible to
sustain. While, therefore, it is quite
unlikely that war will arise through
the Maine disaster, the situation is still
far from reassuring, in the face of
America's projected proposal to pur
chase Cuba."
ADMINISTRATION
POLICY PUZZLES
THE CONGRESSMEN
Continued from First Par*-
ing. The statement is made by some
of the Republican members of the
House that they have reason to be
lieve an effort will be made to get rid
of the appropriation bills and ad
journ Congress before anything is
done by the President with respect
to the Maine disaster, if not before
tne report of the board is made pub
lic, and to prevent any sort of action
with relation to Cuba being taken
before adjournment. The men who
make this assertion take it so seri
ously that they have set a movement
on foot ito resist adjournment at any
time before the Cuban question has
been disposed of. They have been
conferring among themselves and
with some of the Democrats to-day.
The authority for this is a Repub
lican member of standing in the
House from the middle West.
"The trouble," said this member,
"arises out of a firm belief in the
minds of several members that there
is a plan to adjourn Congress with
out taking any action on Cuba or
before the Board of Inquiry reports.
Whatever may be the President's
views of the public sentiment in this
country on the Cuban question, we
know through private letters and
other trustworthy sources that the
people expect some action. If it is
not taken there will n->t be twenty
Republican members elected to the
next Horse. Just let a resolution be
reported to adjourn this Congress
without action on Cuba and you will
see the liveliest row ever witnessed
in the House. The President and
Speaker Beed will learn that the op
position will not come from hot
heads, but from some of the most
conservative men on the Republican
side. The Democrats are already
pledged to stand by us. The canvass
is being made, and in a few hours
we will have the pledges from the
Republican members who can be ab
solutely relied upon. Already there
is every indication of enough votes
to carry out our plan."
The Representative who submit
ted to the above interview drew from
his pocket a letter from the Governor
of his State expressing the popular
feeling on the subject, and saying he
had pledges from sources which
would enable him to guarantee that
he could place 100,000 men in the
field at once, were it shown they
were needed.
NO EUROPEAN POWER
WILL HELP SPAIN.
NEW TORK, March 2.â According to
a cable dispatch from London, all the
Eurc-pean powers were notified some
weeks ago that unless Spain restored
peace in Cuba by March 1 the United
States would intervene. The dispatch
says that no European power gave any
sign of willingness to protest in behalf
of Spain, though the Spanish Govern
ment at first hoped to secure at least
the friendly offices of Austria or
France to induce the United States to
refrain from intervention. Great Brit
ain's attitude has been particularly dis
appointing to Spain because, while not
indorsing the American policy in any
way, it has been clearly indicated that
England would refuse in any manner
to hamper President McKinley in en
forcing his peace policy in Cuba.
OFFICERS DETACHED FOR
IMMEDIATE SEA DUTY.
NEW YORK, March 2.â Orders were
received at the Naval Academy at
Annapolis by telegraph from the Navy
Department detaching a number of of
ficers now stationed there for immedi
ate duty on board ships of the North
Atlantic squadron. The orders caused
some consternation among residents of
the Institution. About thirty officers,
whose time of shore duty expires by
June, expect to receive similar orders
daily. Among the officers detached is
Lieutenant David Daniels, head of one
of the departments of the academy.
BOUTELLE IN NO

Chairman of the House
Naval Committee Pro-
crastinating.
Has Not Submitted the Depart
ment's Request for More
Men.
Sub-Committee Had Already Agreed
Upon an Inorease in the
Enlistment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â Chairman
Boutelle erf the House Committee on
Naval Affairs has not yet submitted to
his committee the letter he received
last Friday from Assistant Secretary
Roosevelt of the Navy Department,
then acting Secretary of the Navy, ask
ing for the passage of. a special act au
thorizing the enlistment of 1500 addi
tional men and boys in the navy. This
additional force was asked for in ad
vance of the passage of the regular ap
propriation bill, in order, it is under
stood, that the vessels which are being
put into commission might be properly
manned.
The sub-committee on naval affairs
in charge of the regular appropriation
bill had already agreed on an increased
enlistment of 1250, bringing the total
of enlisted men up to- 13,000. Ihe sen
timent of the House committee is ex
tremely liberal, and Mr. Foss of Illi
nois, a member of the committe, said
to-day that if the Navy Department
asked for a special bill and the Ques
tion was officially submitted to the com
mittee, he had no doubt it would re
ceive the indorsement of the commit
tee. The sub-committee has shown a
liberal spirit in its recommendations for
increases thus far.
Action on the question of ships and
drydocks will be largely influenced by
the outcome of the investigation into
the Maine disaster. It has already been
practically decided that the price which
the Secretary of the Navy shall be au
thorized to pay for armor plate for the
ships now approaching completion shall
be $400 a ton, but no formal vote has
yet been taken on this proposition by
the sub-committee. The work of the
sub-committee, as far as it has gone,
ia now being reviewed and ratified by
the full committee. Thus far the sub
committee's action has not been re
versed. The full committee has rati
fied the action of the sub-committee in
recommending an Increase of $100,000
for ordnance and ordnance stores,
bringing the total appropriation for this
item up to $300,000, besides the appro
priation of $25,000 for converting 6-inch
guns into rapid-fire guns, $45,000 for
capping armor-piercing shells and $50,
000 for the manufacture of cartridge
making machineryâ the latter appro
priation to go to the ordnance factory.
An appropriation erf $275,000 to in
crease the speed of the Chicago and
to replace her old guns with rapid-fire
batteries is also recommended, and an
appropriation of $250,000 for reserve
torpedoes and appliances.
The increase in the number of enlist
ed men recommended by the sub-com
mittee has not yet been considered by
the full committee. A significant in
crease voted by the full committee re
lated to the appropriation for the naval
militia. Heretofore $50,000 has been
carried by the appropriation bill for
the naval militia. A delegation repre
senting the militia was here recently,
and asked for a slight additional appro
priation, and the committee voted an
increase of $10,000, making a total of
$60,000.
CHILE WILL SELL NO
WARSHIPS TO SPAIN.
Has No Intention of Parting With
Any of the Vessels of
Her Navy.
Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
VALPARAISO, March 2.â The report
that Spain is negotiating to buy from
Chile three warships in course of con
struction in England is characterized as
absurd by Government officials here.
They laugh at the story and declare
that the Chilean Government has never
received even the most remote hint
from Spain as to the purchase of war
ships. It is further stated that Chile
has no intention of parting with any
vessel of her navy, and that even if
she were disposed to sell warships she
would not sell to the United States or
Spain, knowing the status of the
present relations between these two
countries.
Chile has only two chips in Europe â
the armored cruiser O'Higgins, which
is nearly finished and is expected here
in April, and the schoolship General
Baguedona, which will be finished
about the end of the year. The Chilean
transport Augamos left for England
several days ago with officers and crew
for the O'Higgins.
SOBRAL SAILS ON LA
BRETAGNE FOR SPAIN.
The Talkative Naval Attache Given
a Parting Ovation by His
Countrymen.
NEW YORK, March 2.â Lieutenant-
Commander Sobral, formerly naval at
tache of the Spanish Legation at
Washington, sailed to-day on the
steamer La Bretagne for Havre. Many
of the Spanish colony in New York
were at the pier to bid him farewell. In
anticipation of Lieutenant-Commander
Sobral'a departure the Jimta Potriotica
Espanola sent a cablegram to the Min
ister of the Navy at Madrid as follows:
"The Junta Patriotica Espanola of
the United States regrets the departure
of Lieutenant-Commander Sobral. His
patriotic and valuable services are
highly appreciated by the Spanish col
ony."
To-day a member of the Spanish col
ony handed to Lieutenant-Commander
Sobral the reply of the Minister of the
Navy. It read as follows:
"I have to thank you for your tele
gram regarding Lieutenant-Command
er Sobral, whose return to Spain has
been ordered that he may render her
service."
Just before going aboard La Bre
tagne, Lieutenant-Commander Sobral
said to a representative of the Asso
ciated Press that he had been misun
derstood.
"I have no remorse," he said. "My
conscience is clear; I sail contented."
ENLISTING
MEN FOR
THE NAVY
Machinists and Seamen in
Numbers Needed in
the Service.
Orders From Washington to Obtain
With All Possible Dispatch
Recruits for American
Warships.
NEW YORK, March 2.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
Navy Department is still crying tor
men. Besides seamen, it was officially
stated at the department to-day, ma
chinists were particularly desired, and
instructions have been sent to different
rendezvous directing enlistment in un
limited numbers of men of this trade.
Some men of the grade of chief ma
chinists have been discharged within
the last three months. It is desired
by the department to fill the vacancies
now existing on board ships in com
mission, as well as to provide machin
ists for the monilor Miantonomoh and
the ram Katahdin, which are to be
placed in commission on March 10.
Secretary Long definitely determined
to-day to place Captain M. L. John
son in command of the monitor Mian
tonomoh. The selection of this officer
was somewhat a surprise to naval of
ficers on duty at the department, but
it is due to an application for sea
duty made by Captain Johnson. Cap
tain Johnson was relieved only last
September from the command of the
cruiÃer Cincinnati, which was at that
time attached to the European station,
but returned to the United States and
is now the flagship of the South At
lantic station. The experience thus
obtained by Captain Johnson, officials
believe, will be valuable. Since his
return to the United States he has been
on waiting orders.
' The Board of Construction of the
Navy Department to-day determined to
remove from the cruiser Philadelphia
her above-water tubes. It was also
determined not to introduce submerged
tubes in place of those to be taken out.
In explanation of the removal of the
above-water tubes, it is explained that
this action is in pursuance of a policy
adopted by the department of taking
such tubes out of all ships of service.
There is danger in case of battle that
an enemy's shell strike a torpedo in
an above-water tube and cause its dis
charge, the result of whicn would be
the destruction of the ship.
The most serious embarrassment un
der which the navy would labor in case
of trouble â lack of docking facilities
will be removed shortly. Naval Con
structor Bowles, who is superintending
the repairs to dry dock 3 at the Brook
lyn Navy Yard, has reported fp the
Navy Department that the dry dock
will be ready to receive ships on April
1. In addition the department, has
been notified that the work of dredg
ing the basin in front of the dock at
Port Royal has been commenced and
that the work will be pushe* as rap
idly as possible.
I learned at the department to-day
that the structure at that point has
been strengthened and officials of the
department now say that : when the
basin is dredged out it will be possible
for a ship to come up stream and
anchor in the basin until a favorable
tide, when the vessel will enter the
dock. The importance of having a
large dock in the South Is appreciated
by the officials, especially at this time,
when the entire North Atlantic squad
ron is massed in Southern waters.
It Is recognized by naval tacticians
that should there be war with Spain
naval battles' will undoubtedly take
place near Cuba, and that it will be
highly advantageous to have a dock
close at hand to which disabled ships
may be towed for repairs. The Port
Royal dock is not as near the gulf as
the authorities would wish, and its
requtation for strength Is not such as
to cause the officials to desire to in
trust a vessel to its care; but on 'the
principle of "any port in a storm" it is
expected that it will be very valuable
in case of emergency. The construction
department has established a shop at
Port Royal and has been purchasing
the necessary tools with which to
equip it, so that repairs can be made
without any difficulty. With the com
pletion of the Brooklyn and Port Royal
docks the department will have two
structures capable of accommodating
battle-ships.
The Port Royal structure can proba
bly not take in the Massachusetts,
which is equipped with fin keels, but if
it became absolutely necessary to dock
these vessels at Port Royal these keels
could be removed. Dry dock 3 at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard will be able to
receive any of the battle-ships, and the
department will be glad to have it
again in commission. All of the bat
tle-ships are in need of docking, and
when the opportunity offers they will
probably be sent to the Brooklyn yard
to have their bottoms cleaned and
painted. ___________^_ _

... In the very way -the friends of ex- j
Senator Routier speak his name there ]
is a revelation of the dead man's char
acter. Joseph Routier was one of those
men to whom wealth meant merely a
means, not an end. His generous, large
nature was incapable of harboring a
wish for money; the possession of it

sion of his sentiment in the matter
that use is the spending of it, freely,
with unstinted. ungrudging open
handedness. This was Joseph Routier's
creed as exemplified not alone by faith,
but by works. .
Up in the most fertile part of th?
Sacramento Valley is a country estate
that is still known as "Routier's." Here
Joseph Routier and his. wife lived as
a marquis and his noble lady might
have lived in the ancient regime, before
even the first Napoleon had been heard
of. Madame Routier was clever, well
educated, a delightful musician. All
the latest music found its way up to
"Routier's.' 1 Monsieur, the husband,

other of the good things of life, in Sen- j

summer with Joseph Routier, it was
understood that you would issue, in
your name and his, invitations to a
congenial company, and that all to
gether you would descend upon your
host There was room for all of you,
and if the great dining room could not
accommodate the whole party, tables
were set on the lawns; and the French
chef and his assistants tripped over
each other's heels in their anxiety to
serve Routier's guests.
It was a princely, more than that,
it was a beautiful hospitality. But it
came to an endâ and so, unluckily, did
Routier's fortune.
The civil records of Sacramento
County show that in 1866 Joseph Rou
tier received from the estate of L. L.
Folsom a deed to the land which sub
sequently made him rich, and later on
left him in poverty. The first mort-
gage bears date of September, 1894. It
is made to William Land the present
Mayor of -Sacramento, secures $18,500,
and is signed by Joseph and Leonlde
Routier.
In January, 1897, there is another
transfer which completes the story. It
is between the same parties, and for
and in consideration of $10 what was
once a principality passes to an un
willing owner, who was compelled to
accept the security he had taken for
his loan.
The fine orchard, the beautiful old
farm that Routier had spent thirty
years in improving, the home endeared
to him as the place where his man
hood had been spent, wh^re, practi
cally, his life work was embodied, pass
ed out of Joseph Routier's possession.
And the man who had once been the
genial lord of all took his place meekly
on the lower rung of fortune's ladder,
and, like Hardy's Mayor of Caster
bridge, gave his services for hire to
his successor.
â  Joseph Routier's days were ended
here. One evening in the early part
iof February, when returning home
from the postoffice at Patterson's road
house, his horse became unmanageble.
and as he turned through the gateway
over which there is an arch bearing the
: word "Routier," the vehicle in which
he rode upset. The old man was thrown
violently to the ground, and though he
afterward regained consciousness, he
survived his fall but a. few days, and |
was soon hi id to rest.

The history of this woman's life reads
like a work of fiction. Whether the in
cidents of her wonderful career have
been preserved in oral transmission by
those in whom she had confided frag
ments of her strange past, or whether
gleaned from her own account of
them, they are abundant in romantic
and adventurous features and carry
with them all the passions of the heart.
There are two accounts to be given.
The one comes from the whispering
echoes of that mysterious chamber
without look or key, where family
skeletons revel and reveal secrets of
their keeping. The one tells of an un
holy love, of children born in unlawful
wedlock, of a deserted home, of social
ostracism, and a life in exlie. The other
comes from the lips of Mine. Timoleon

...â¢-â¢â¢ â â¢â â¢
Just at the time when the tragic
events of the French Revolution were
drawing to a close, on the evening of
the very day when Louis Napoleon is
sued the memorable decree which ex
pelled from France the ex-Representa
tives who resisted and denounced the
proclamation of December 2, 1851, there
were assembled at 16 Rue d'Assas a
company of young men. They were in
the main representatives from the
French conservatories of art, most of
them being painters, sculptors and
musicians. But there was also an at
tache of the General Assembly, a
porcelain painter, and the man
from whom this story takes its source,
Timoleon Charles" Marie Joseph Routier
de B'uHemont. This merry company of
young men were drinking to the health
of the ex-K .pn-sentatives whose ban
ishment had been proclaimed and post
ed that very day on the walls of Put i.-.
They did mor.-; they shouted lustily for
the republic.
â¢Long live th>- republic!" "Long live
'â  the constitution !" "Down with Bona
parte, the traitor!" they cried. The
! sound of their revelry reached the ears
j of a passing commissary of police, their
arrest followed, and hardly had the
I echoes of their patriotic shouts died
away before the prison van backed up
to the door of 16 Rue d'Assas and they
were hustled off to the Mazas.
The Muzas, a very tall, old, red
building, still stands near the ter
minus of the Lyons Railway, near the
Faubourg Saint Antoine. It was then
the largest prison in Paris. Six nar
row four-story wings radiate from a
central court or rotunda.
Within this court was the office of ]
the registrar, and when the prison van j
drove into the inclosure the occupants j
were "lined up" and marched through
a long hallway which led up to the of
fice from the outside. As each was In
turn registered and numbered he was
told to "file on." A clerk stood at
hand, and as each prisoner passed him
he shouted out to the turnkey, who
stood at the end of this long hall, 'Re
ceive number so-and-so," the turnkey
responding, "Send him along." It bo
happened that young Routier de Bul
lemont 'was the last in the line. As he
approached the young clerk a cry of
surprise and joy escaped from his
lips. The clerk to the prefecture of
police was his brother.
Following the recognition was a mo
tion of caution by the* latter, and
young Routier de Bullemont passed on
to his cell.
That nightthe brothers had a meet
ing. Altogether, it was not a satisfac
tory one. The elder, who was the
clerk, rebuked his brother for the part
he was evidently taking in the revolu
tion. The younger chafed under the
censure, and the brothers parted that
night in anger.
Joseph being left alone, for the first
time made a survey of his surround
ings. The cell he occupied was small,
dark and dismal in the extreme. The
only light he had struggled in through
the iron grating which formed a little
window in the door. The walls once

Mansion.
coated with thin whitewash were now I
streaked with yellow, and dotted here
and there with green mold. In one !
corner hinged like a shelf was a brack- i
et seat. There was no furniture or bed
ding. The floor, constructed of red
crumbling bricks, stood on end, was
damp and foul smelling. The first day
spent in this awful place found young i
Joseph less defiant. That night he slept j
but little, and when for breakfast he i
was given a pewter bowl of sour and j
sticky soup, his heart failed him, and j
he longed for another talk with his
brother. His brother had anticipated
as much, and when Joseph was taken
out in the morning for his daily exer- I
cisc the clerk of the Prefect saw him j
again, and agreed to go to his cell that
night. When he did go, he told Joseph
that at the end of the fifth day he
would be taken to the office of the Pre
fecture of Police, and asked the ques
tion whether or not he would prefer
Belgium or America as a place of exile.
Joseph's face lightened, and he prompt
ly replied: "I will choose Belgium."
"No," said his brother; "you must not
make that reply.
"Why?"
"Those who prefer Belgium, never
reach there," was the significant an
swer.
"From Belgium, it is too easy to
return to France, and Louis Napoleon
does not want his exiles to return."
"I prefer Belgium and will so de
clare," sullenly replied Joseph.
"Very well, then," said his brother,
"I have warned you, and if you make
that request "
There was the sound of the firing
of guns in the dark corridor.
"Did you hear that?" Joseph asked.
"Some poor devil has asked to
be sent to Belgium," said his brother,
as he left Joseph once more alone.
Five weary days passed and Joseph
had plenty of time to think over the
admonition of his brother. No day
passed that he did not hear the shots
echo through the corridors. When his
time came to appear before the pre-
I fecture of police, and the question of
I the place of his exile was asked him,
he repliedâ "America."
Think what exile to America means
to a Frenchmanâ a Parisian. And think
what it must have meant to Routier
to come not only to America but to
California in '53 with the horde of ad
! venturers who sailed on the ships the
I French used to call "l'lngot" â the in
got for the new El Dorado. Think of
' the wilderness he came to. Think of
the height of culture and civilization
! he left behind, and forever.
On the night of January 20, 1852. there
was a sound of revelry within the Ely
see. Louis Napoleon was supreme.
| Gathered around him were those who
I had contributed to the glory of his
j achievements, and who now shared his
! fortunes. About him sabers glistened
and drums beat. Presidents of repub
lics now accepted and honored the au
! thority of his Embassadors; Kings
bowed to him, and all the world ac
knowledged his triumph. On the night
of the 20th of this month and year
there was to be a grand fete at the
' palace. All the musicians of Paris had
! been summoned to the court of Napo
leon. Among them was beautiful Mme.

cerning Joseph.

ter off in America."
He said no more and Mme. knew
that there was no hope. The festivi
ties broke with the dawn of the day.
Mme. had left the palace and was
Just entering her carriage when she
heard her name called In a whisper.
Lookftig around she saw Joseph Routier
de Builemont. She motioned to him. He
quickly entered her carriage and they
drove away. Next morning Mme.
sought another interview with the-
Emperor.
"Why do you take such an interest
in this man? You have a husband and
a family," the Emperor said when the
purpose of her visit was made known
to him.
She made no reply and simply stated
that Routier de Builemont had accept
ed the terms of the decree which made
him an exile, and only asked for the
privilege of visiting his family in Bel
gium. He wanted a suspension of the
decree until the month of November.
"Nine months is a long time," said
Napoleon. .
"But he will virtually be in exile,"
repeated Mme. . "He wtll be in
Belgium."
Napoleon finally consented. Joseph
Routier de Bullemont did not sail from
France until November 9, 1852, and
when he did beautiful Madameâ â .
accompanied him. It was on the 31st
day of May. 1853, when they landed in

San Francisco. Six months had elapsed
since their elopement, and, disregard
ing the ties which bound Madame
to her husband under the laws of
France, she became the wife of Routier
de Bullemont under the apparent sanc
tion of the laws of California.
It will be noticed that the name ac
quired by marriage Is omitted. The
woman would have it so now, and
good taste suggests this course. There
is no reason why the reproach she
brought upon her children should be
come an open shame.
On a hot summer afternoon in the
month of September, 1870, Joseph Rou
tier, as was his daily custom, sat in the
shade of the trees at Patterson's Inn,
waiting for the arrival of the evening
mail. WTien it came it brought the
news of the surrender of Louis Na
poleon to William of Prussia.
"Thank God!" exclaimed Routier, as
his eyes met the announcement. "Now
I can return to France." Then he
seemed to fall into a deep study, and
after a time shouk his head and mut
tered: "No; all the barriers are not yet
removed."
Joseph Routier never returned to
France.
"My husband was generous. Now
I am left in poverty." sighed Madame
Routier, when she was seen by a Call
correspondent just prior to leaving her
old home forever.
Madame ttoutier is very, very old.
Her hair is quite white. She has been
broken by age, by the loss of that dear
companion for whose sake she gave up
what women hold most precious. Yet,
despite all. despite the poverty which
makes her now a helpless charge upon
her old friends' sympathy, she still re
tains the charm, the old-time grace of
the Parisian grande dame.
said the lntejcreter. "we
have come to secure from you a bi
ography of yourself and Senator Rou
tier." .
The pooT old eyes filled with tears at
the mention of that name. But con
quering her distress. Madame Routier
listened to the questions, to which the
following statement is her answer:
"My maiden name was Jadin. My
father was a bodyguard to Charles X.
In iB3O he accompanied the King to
Cherbourg. He was afterward retired
on half pay. My grandfather was gov
ernor of the pages who sang in the
royal chapel. He composed many
operas and music of a sacred order.
He was a man of great renown in his
time. Mv family were all Legitimists,
supporters of the crown. We have re
ceived much for our loyalty to the
King. And yet here 1 am to-day
without a penny in this world."
The old lady again broke down, and
for many minutes not a word was
spoken. Finally the interpreter said:
"We should like to know something
about your life, madame."
"My life," she answered, then shook
her head. "Ah, mv life does not
amount to much."
"Oh, but it does," replied the inter
preter. "Senator Routier was a very
prominent man, and the public is in
I terested in you both."
Madame Routier then asked if what
she was going to say would be pub
lished. When told that it would be, she
looked out of the little window by
which she was sitting and thought for
i a long time. Finally she said: "I was
| educated at the Royal Convent at Ver
sailles. I afterward taught music in
Paris. I was teaching music when I
met Joseph. His real name is Timoleon
Charles Marie Joseph Routier de Bulle
mbnt. In France the higher up they
are the more names they have. He
came from a grand family, and was the
only republican. His family were all
legitimists. My husband was an artÃ
tocrat In breeding, but not in belief.
His people had many offices under the
crown. His brother was secretary to
the Prefecture of Police at the close of
the revolution which restored Louis
Napoleon. Joseph was very homely
when I. first saw him in '48," she con
tinued with a sad smile. "I met him
first in Paris. He was not handsome,
but very proud and fearless. He took
sides against Napoleon, and since he
and I have had many very warm dis
cussions over our different views on the
subject."
When pressed upon the question
of their relations she hesitated for a
time then replied: "We left Paris to
gether in November, 1852. We landed
in San Francisco in the following May.
I remember we were six months com
ing. When we arrived we went before
some Judge or official of some kind, I
do not remember now, and were mar
ried. We then came here, where I have
lived to see the day I prayed God
would never come. I never wanted to
survive my husband."
The tears of old age are the most ter
rible to witness. A portrait of Victor
Hugo hung upon the wall, and to dis
tract poor Mme. Routier from the sor
rowful memories that rise and master
her the interp- ?r said hastily: "Tell
me, Madame, do you remember Victor
Hugo?"
Instantly the little French woman
brightened up.
"Ah, yes, I remember him well. He
lived at the Palace Royal, one square
from the Bastile. I was to play one
night at his house, but was taken sick
Just before the time when I was to go.
I remember how disappointed I was.
It was an honor to be at the house of
the great republican; and legitimist
though I was, I appreciated it. He

did not seem to relish the thought that
a suspicion existed to the effect that

HE THOUGHT HE
WAS ESTERHAZY
Suicide of an Artist Crazed by
His Interest in. the Zola
Trial.
Copyrighted. 1898. by Jam fs Gordon Bennett.
PARIS. March 2.â The Dreyfus case has
had a fresh "victim, an artist whose head
has beer, literally turned by the excite
ment and who yesterday jumped out of
a high window under the delusion that he
was Major .Ksterhazy and that the police
were coming to arrest him..
Ever sincje the beginning of the Zola
trial this hapless individual has made
himself conspicuous by the extreme vio
lence with which he disctissed the pro
ceedings of the assizes. He never tired of
defending Major Esterhazy and upon one
occasion he narrowly escaped being ar
rested for creating a disturbance in the
street. . .â â¢. â â¢ : . â 
As Zola's trial neared its conclusion the
artist grew worst- and finally so identi
fied himself with the troubles of Major
Estorhazy that, he came to confuse his
identity with hfs hern's. He thought he
was Major Esterhasy and everybody
around was conspiring to bring about his
downfall. â  . .
"< Mi .\try side of him." says Temps,
"he saw ambushes and traps, every hour
he took fresh precautions to escape from
his t-nernies:"
Two days ago his frlerids were aston
ished to see that he had shaved, not only
his chin and upper lip but his head as
well. â 
"If Colonel Picquiirt recognizes me," he
cried at the top of his voice, "he will be
a clever fellow." ' â¢
Earlj- this, morning, the unfortunate
man rose hastily from his bed. "They are

piteous voice, ' '

threw himself out. He was. killed in-

Washington, March 2.
In the Senate to-day Stewart of Ne
vada resumed his speech on the bank
ruptcy bill passed by the House, but
had not concluded at 2 o'clock, when
the Alaska homestead and railway
right of way bill was laid before the
Senate, and he announced that he
would finish to-morrow.
Carter of Montana, who reported the
bill, said that for two days the Senate
had been called upon to listen to one of
the most remarkable attacks upon a
committee of Senators In a speech mak
ing serious charges against Individual
Senators. He declared that it was un
fair; that the Senator who deliv
ered the speech (Rawllns of Utah)
should have withheld it from publica
tion in the Record, inasmuch as it was
delivered in the course of a running de
bate, and he was satisfied that the
speech could not be published as deliv
ered, parallel with the bill itself, with
out affording a co-mplete refutation of
its charges.
"It will be found by Senators," said
Carter, "after a careful examination of
the bill, that of the wholesale charges
of dishonest purpose contained in the
speech of the Senator from Utah noth
ing remains."
When Rawlins attempted to speak
Carter, with come feeling, declined to
be interrupted. A moment later, how
ever, he yielded, and Rawlins dis
1 claimed all intention of casting asper
sions upon any Senator, and said that
Carter's sttitement was unwarranted by
; the facts, as could be shown by the ste
nographer's notes.
Carter then continued his remarks,
quoting extensively from Government
reports from Alaska. He said he
' { thought it remarkable, in view of the
', struggle of Americans to get into the
i Alaska gold fields during the past year,
that Rawlins should maintain that
â¢ there was no necessity for the pending
legislation. "I had supposed," he con
tinued, "that the fact I have mentioned
was so widely known that even the
j Senator from Utah had heard of it."
At this point Allen of Nebraska re
quested Carter to give the Senate a
synopsis of Rawlins 1 remarks.
Rawlins rose to give the synopsis
himself, but Carter declined to yield.
"When the plutocrat and the Popu
list come together," exclaimed Rawlins
bitterly, "it is time for the Senate to
beware."
Elkins of West Virginia, who had
been waiting during the greater part of
the afternoon for an opportunity to ad
dress the Senate, said in beginning his
remarks that he was glad to see that
an effort was being made to exact
something from Canada in view of all
that the Dominion Government and its
corporations received from the United
States.
"For long years," said Elkins, "Can
ada has taken business from our coun
try and despoiled the business of our
railroads, and all this without any
proper return. In order to understand
the better what I have to say, I de
sire to refer particularly to the Cana
dian Pacific Railroad."
When Elkins referred to the military
advantages of the Canadian Pacific and
its two strongholds â Halifax and Es
quimau â Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts
interrupted him with the facetious re
mark that the Senator need have no
apprehension of the British guns at
those points, as they would endanger
Americans only in the event of their
kicking, as, if any trouble should oc
cur, Americans would be behind those
guns.
In reply to a question from Lindsay
concerning the statement that the Ca
nadian Pacific was carrying passengers
from New York to Vancouver for $30
Elkins said that the American roads
had received permission from the In
terstate Commerce Commission to com
pete with the Canadian Pacific in pas
senger rates, but that the Canadian
Pacific had declared its intention of re
ducing the fare to $28.
In the course of a brief reply to El
kins Hoar expressed some regret that
Elkins had brought into the discussion
of the pending bill so much matter that
was apparently Irrelevant. He agreed
with Elkins that the executive depart
ments of the Government had the
power that should be exercised to pre
vent Canada from imposing upon this
country or its business interests. He
also agreed with him that the destruc
tion of the seal herds was a reproach
to civilization, and that the denial of
the privileges of hospitality to our fish
ermen was a reproach. He held, too,
that Canada ought not to enjoy the
bonding privilege, which the United
States did not also have, and he per
fectly agreed with Elkins that the busi
ness of supplying American citizens In
Alaska ought not in any way to be bur
dened by Canadian monopoly.
Nelson of Minnesota followed Hoar
with a sharp protest against Elkins"
proposition, on the ground that it was
aimed at the interests of the farmers of
the Northwest. We have, he said,
other interests than those of the rail
road trunk lines. At the farther end of
Lake Superior there is located a great
empire of five or six millions of farm
ers, and the interests of those farmers
are of far higher consideration than are
the interests of the railroads, however
important they may be to their owners.
It was the duty of Congress, he con
tinued, to look after the interests of this
vast community and the lnterettts of
the people of New England, rather
than the interests of the coupon-clip
ping foreigners who hold the stocks and
bonds of the trunk lines. He asserted
that Mr. Elkins' proposition was a
blow at the American farmer and to get
him into the caldron of the railroad and
there to roast and singe him without
mercy.

STOUT'S BILL

ture To-Day.

Confident of Its
Passage.
Believe a Majority Will Vote
to Repeal the Southern
Pacific Charter.
MR. HUNTINGTON'S TERMS.
Says the Road Will Pay a "Police
Protection Tax " and Nothing
More.
SpectaJ Dispatch to The Call.
FRANKFORT Ky., March 2.â The
Committee on Corporations has report
ed favorably on the Stout bill to re
peal the charter of the Southern Pa
cific Company. The committee was
not reached in the House to-day, but
under a recent rule of the House the
Committee on Rules may take up any
bill at any titne. Mr. Stout said to
night:
"Speaker Beckham as chairman of
the Rules Committee has agreed to
permit me to call up the bill to-mor
row. I find that there is a warm senti
ment in favor of the passage of the
bill. It will meet little or no opposition
in the House from present indications.
The big corporation seems powerless
to manipulate the present Legislature,
and the bill will be rushed with all
possible dispatch. It seems at this
time we will be able to pass the meas
ure through both houses, although the
time for doing so is very short, indeed.
The little opposition will obstruct the
measure to a very slight extent, and
it starts under favorable circum
stances.
"1 learn from the members of the
Board of Valuation and Assessments
that the Southern Pacific Company
has been negotiating for a settlement
of the tax cases out of court, and since
the introduction of the repeal bill has
been awakened to this end. The com
pany should not expect privileges
under our laws unless it expects to be
governed by them as are other com
panies."
Senator Thomas H. Hays of Louis
ville, leader of the opposition, said: "I
have received word from Mr. Hunting
ton in regard to the measure. You
can say that there will nothing come
of it. Mr. Huntington says he is
tired of the anno-ance of the repeated
efforts to repeal the charter. He says
that in the course of time, when the
matter can be adjusted b - attorneys,
the Pacific Comna^- will pay a 'police
protection tax,' nothing more. The
company has no property in Kentucky
comparative with its great interests.
The present measure is like similar
other measures for the purpose of
forcing taxes. The bill will not pass.
The San Francisco lobby will not come
here. I do not think it possible to pass
the bill through the House, and should
it meet our branch we shall defeat it
easily. Should the bill now pass we
could have passed in another State a
charter which would serve the pur
pose of the present Kentucky charter."
The bill has gained much in favor
and a number of the ablest members
of the House will strongly advocate its
passage. Mr. Stout has been gather
ing data upon the operations of the
company. The friends of the bill say
they hope to pass the measure before
the last of the week in the House. They
claim that Governor Bradley is favor
able to the bill and there is little
doubt of his signing it under the cir
cumstances.

Special Dispatch to The Call. ..
SEATTLE, March 2.â The - steamer
Roealle to-day brought down thirty
nine passengers from Alaska. One of
them, Frank Jones, was Just out from
Dawson, but had no late news from
the Klondike.
Passengers on the Rosalie bring
news of the wreck of the bark Canada,
which broke away from her anchorage
off the Skaguay wharf during the ter
rible storm on Monday, February 21.
After being on the rocks a short time
the vessel floated off and was tied up
temporarily. On the following Thurs
day another storm came on and again
the big bark broke away. She wound
up her mad race with the waves on a
sandbar near Haines Mission. No
lives were lost, but the bark is sup
posed to be a total wreck.
The Canada left Tacoma some time
ago with a cargo of lumber for Skag
uay. The tow up the coast was without
Incident. When the storm of the 21st
came up the bark was off the Skaguay
wharf, waiting for a chance to unload.
She had two anchors out, and the cap
tain, mate and some of the crew were
on board. Almost without warning one
of the anchor ropes parted and the ves
sel swung around to the wind. The
other anchor gave away and the bark
was soon on the rocks. She was subse
quently floated and moored to trees
along the shore.
The following Thursday brought an
other storm and the trees were soon
pulled up by their roots. The tug Cole
man was sent out after the bark and
succeeded In making fast a line. On ac
count of the wind the tug was unable
to make any headway with so heavy a
tow, and giving up the attempt went
back to Skaguay. The Canada brought
up high and dry on a sandbar near
Haines Mission. Those aboard were
brought back to Skaguay on the tug
Alert, and a number of them came
down on the Ttosalie yesterday, among
them being the captain.
The Canada, it is believed, will prove
a total wreck, although seme of the
cargo may be saved. She was badly
injured from her contact with the rocks
during the first blow, and it is believed
that the second wreck finished her.
The home port of the Canada was Port
Townsend. She was launched In 1853
at Bath, Me., and was 1144 tonÃ bur
den. She was sent north on this trip
by the Washington and Alaska Steam
ship Company and was uninsured.
Two barges broke away from their
moorings at Skaguay 'hiring the same
storm. One of them, !< aded with lum
ber, Had just been t'iwÂ«d north by the
Protection. One barge was recovered,
but most of th<> lumber had been wash
ed off. The other barge was loaded
with bridge timber and Iron for a
bridge on the Skaguay wagon road.
Both cargo and barge were lost.
A PECULIAR FATALITY.
Mrs. Fraser of Stockton Dies From
the Effect of Burns.
STOCKTON, March 2.â Mrs. Annette
Fraser, wife of P. B. Fraser, president of
the Farmers' ;ind Merchants' Bank of
this city, died at 6:30 o'clock this morn
rng at her home here. Her death was
caused by pneumonia, superinduced by
severe burns received five weeks ago.
Mrs. Frasor was standing before a fire
place at her residence, when her dress
caught the blaze, and she was soon
wrapped in flames. The blazing clothing
was smothered, but it was found that she
had been quite severely burned on the
limbs.
Everything possible was done for the
sufferer, and for the first three weeks
she improved steadily. Everything look
ed favorable, when a change came. Sev
eral of the veins had been burned, and
inflammation set up in them. This caused
clotting of the blood, and little by liule
the clots passed into the circulatory sys
tem, and finally lodged and accumulated
in the lungs, bringing on an attack of
pneumonia, which was the direct cause
of death.
One of the sons is now on his way home
from the East, and is expected to ar
rive this evening, when arrangements for
the funeral will be made.
CHARGES NOT SUSTAINED.
Steward Young of Agnews Exon
erated on Investigation.
SAN JOSE, March 2.â F. C. Young,
steward of Agnews Asylum for the In
sane, was to-day exonerated of the
charges of neglect of duty and ineom
petency preferred by the board of man
agers. He is a Union veteran, and
when the charges were made he sued
out a writ of prohibition to restrain
the board from proceeding to a hear
ing. The writ was dismissed on the
ground that the hoard had Jurisdiction.
The findings to-day were that only one
charge was sustained, that of neglect in
giving proper attention to the purchase
of goods, and this was excused on the
ground that he was a Union soldier.
KILLED BY A RUNAWAY.
Jerry Romelli, a Gonzales Rancher,
Is Thrown From His Buggy.
SALINAS. March 2.â Jerry Romelli. a
well-to-do rancher living near Gonzales,
was instantly killed this afternoon by
being thrown out of his buggy by a run
away team. He had long been driving a
very spirited team of horses. To-day,
while he was returning to hiÃ ranch from
Gonzales, the team became uncontrol
able, and turning a corner sharply Ro
melll was thrown out. He was a native
of Switzerland and about 47 years of
age.
FLOATING BOTTOM UP.
ASTORIA, Or., March 2.â The British
sealing schooner Hatzic of Victoria. Cap
tain Daley, came into this harbor this
evening with a disabled chronometer.
Captain Daley reports having sighted a
schooner, bottom up, Tuesday afternoon
thirty-two miles off TUlamook and about
ten miles south-southwest of the light
ship. He came to within about fifteen
feet of the wreck and saw no evidence of
life nor could he make out her name. The
bottom was in good condition, paintfd
with copper paint and. the keel was about
one hundred feet long. The wreck is sup
posed to be the lumber schooner Del
Norte from San Francisco for Tillamook,
which has been out about six weeks.

BOASTS THAT HE
WILL NOT HANG
Parricide Flannelly Pre
fers Suicide to the
Gallows.
Plans for Self - Destruction
Confided to a Fellow-
Prisoner*
Twelve Men Sworn to Paes Upon
the Two-Fold Murderer's
Fate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE March 2.â The Flan
nelly case dragged wearily along to
day. The work of swearing a jury oc
cupied the court's attention. The
courtroom was crowded with specta
tors. The taking of testimony will
commence to-morrow, and from that
time on the proceedings promise to be
interesting. It is thought the trial will
occupy about ten days.
Flannelly has declared he will never
hang. He boasts that he will com
mit suicide before he will ever meet
j such a death. Of late his spirits have
I been depressed. A prisoner who occu-
I pied the same cell with Flannelly un
j til lately, but who is now out of jail,
told The Call correspondent to-day
that Flannelly's conscience troubles
him a gTeat deal. He said that sev
eral times each evening Flannelly
would be awakened by nightmares,
i and he would start up as if from
i fright. On such occasions he would
: awaken his cell mate and talk until
he had recovered from the nervous
shock. The parricide intimated that
should the verdict be "guilty of mur
i der Jn the first degree" he would com
i mit suicide before he would face the
j gallows. A number of times he point
ed out an artery on his wrist, which
he said he could sever if the worst
came. He spoke of the washroom in
' the small tank as being a suitable
i place in which he could hang him
self. There is a grating overhead, and
this he declared would be an excelleut
place to tie a rope made from blankets
to hang himself. He could stand
on a box and fix the improvised rope
I around his neck and kick the box
| from under him. This, Flannelly said,
* would be an easy way to cheat the
verdict of the court.
Flannelly's money has about given
out, and with this has gone much of
j his bravado. If he is convicted he will
have no money for an appeal to the
Supreme Court, and unless his mother
aids him financially he will, if possi
ble, put one of his threats of self
destruction into execution. His folks
have not done anything for him
yet. and it is thought they may
ignore him altogether. Just now
what little spirit is left in him is
being bolstered up by the hope that
he may receive a life sentence. He
thinks that his story of self-defense
will be believed, as he intends to go
on the stand and testify that his
father ordered him out of the. house,
and when he refused to comply
threatened to kill him and made a mo
tion as if to draw a gun from under
his pillow.
The jury was completed to-day as
follows: S. F. Patton, Levi Mayock,
William Buckley, A. Barker, John F.
Barry, C. C. Smith, Frank Armstrong,
TV D. Eitel, Fred Krumb, H. J. Ben
nett, M. F. Edwards and W. F. Hlg
gins.
Tormorrow, at 10 o'clock, the
taking of testimony will begin.
AN ICY TOMB IN
THE LYNN CANAL
Fate of the Clara Nevada's
Steward and His Seven
Assistants.
Complete L-ist of tho Unfortunates
Names Is Furnished a Call
Correspondent.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 2.â Several additional
names of the crew of the ill-fated steam
er Clara Nevada were secured to-day by
The Call correspondent. In the former
published accounts little mention has
been made of the fate of the steward's
crew of eight men, which, so far as
known, found an icy tomb at the bottom
of Lynn Canal, when the steamer blew
up in an Arctic hurricane on! Seward
City. A complete list of this crew is
given on authority of Fred Laudln, who
was to have sailed for the north on the
steamer, but who relinquished his posi
tion having become dissatisfied with the
work. One member of the crew escaped,
having left the ship at Skaguay. This
was Fred Emery, whose parents reside at
Victoria But for his fortunate with
drawal from the ill-fated vessel his name
would now be among those who were
Â°Laudin says that his reason for leaving
the Nevada before she sailed from this
city was that he did not like the sleep
ing accommodations. He says that the
instructions were to nerve the second
cabin passengers first, and that he con
sidered the work would be hard, as only
twenty could be seated at one time.
According to Laudln, who knew most
'of the men personally, the list of the
steward's crew Is as follows: Frank
O'Donnell, steward, 52 years; Charles
Hunt, assistant steward, 42 years; Per
kins, waiter, 30 years; Kelly, waiter, 40
years; Butler, waiter, 28 years; Frank
Field, pantryman, 60 years; Ernest Dohm,
steerage steward. Frank O'Donnell, the
steward, was well known on the coast,
having sailed as steward on a number
of ships. . "
Arrangements have been made to send
north at once divers to search for the
bodies of those lost in the destruction of
the steamer Clara Nevada. The latest re
ports from Alaska regarding the wreck
of the steamer seem to indicate that it
was not an explosion of the boilers that
caused the disaster which was accom
panied by the loss of fifty or sixty lives.
A letter was received yesterday by the
owners of the steamer from Sanderson
Reed of Portland, who was sent north to
search for the body of his friend. Purser
George Foster Beck, and for the bodies
of other members of the crew and pas
sengers. This letter says that there is
every indication that the steamer was
blown on Eldred Rock and that the fire
was caused by the lamps being upset by
the shock.
From Fort Wrangel comes the infor
mation that Jessie "Wilkins and E. T. Hol
gate, both of Portland, took passage on
the Clara Nevada and were lost with
others in the wreck. Mr. Reed says that
the fire originally started In different
parts of the vessel, which prevented the
crew and passengers from checking it.
Then, he believes, an attempt was made
to lower the lifeboats, which was unsuc
cessful on account of the storm. His
opinion is that the bodies of most of those
lost on the vessel will be found near the
wreck.

SECOND-CLASS
MAIL MATTER
The Loud Bill Occupies
Another Day in
the House.
Partisan Speech by Lentz of
Ohio in Opposition to
the Measure.
See* a Serious Menace to the Country
Editor and a Deathblow to
BryaniÃm.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â The House
spent another day in debate upon the
Loud bill relating to second-class mail j
matter. The speeches, as a rule, at- j
tracted little interest. The speakers
were Messrs. Brownell (R.) of Ohio and !
Ogden (D.) of Louisiana in favor of the j
measure, and Messrs. Bell (Pop.) of j
Colorado, Simpson (Pop.) of Kansas, I
Clark (D.) of Missouri. Brown (R.) of j
Ohio and Lentz (D.) of Ohio in oppo
sition to it.
The latter gentleman was once edi
tor of a weekly newspaper, and he de- |
livtred a eulogy on the country editor, j
"He is as faithful to the people as is j
the needle to the pole," he said. "In !
the monotonous campaign of 18#6, when j
a vast majority â not all, mark you, but j
a vast majority â of the Democratic
metropolitan newspapers basely de- !
serted their colors and went bag and \
baggage, horse, foot and dragoons, into ;
the camp of the enemy, the country
weeklies, with rare exception, stowd by i
the canee of Bryan, Democracy and hu- |
manity with unshaken fidelity, .superb j
courage'and commendable self-abnaga
tion, thereby vindicating the patriotism,
visdom and: independence of the Amer
ican press. Upon this same country ;
editor we must depend largely for hon- i
est, courageous, patriotic press service j
in the campaign now pending as well
as that of 1900, and surely upon the j
Democratic aide of the House we would
be acting with unwise wisdom to de
prive him of any of his prerogatives. |
The Loud bill might justly be entitled I
'An act to diminish the supply of anti-
Republican campaign literature.' Then!
it would be true to its name. The Re- I
publicans, having nine-tenths ot the '
great metropolitan papers, may find
â ome excuse for supporting a measure \
which will squelch the country week- |
lies,, but certainly Democrats, Populists !
ajid Free Silver Republicans cannot af- i
ford to do so. unless they are meditat
ing political suicide."
Lentz in opposing the bill declared
that the deficiency in the postal reve
nues was due to the fact that the rail
roads were paid extravagant rates for
the transportation of the mails.
Bell (Pop.) of Colorado, Simpson
(Pop.) of Kansas and Clark (D.) of
Missouri opposed the bill, mainly on the
ground that it was inimical to the in
terests of the country editors.
Griggs (D.) of Georgia gave notice
of an amendment to the amendment of
which Loud gave notice yesterday,
providing that newspapers and peri- ;
odicals should have the right to send j
out sample, copies at pound rates to !
the number of 1000 copies.
A resolution of inquiry was adopted i
asking the President to transmit to
the House a copy of the proceedings of
the International Commission on the
question of the equitable distribution
Of the waters of the Rio Grande, re
quired of said commission by the proto
col of May 6, 1896: also the protest of
Mr. Horcasitas, representing citizens
of Mexico, against the construction of
dams by the Rio Grande Dam and Ir
rigation Company and the action
thereon.
A bill was passed creating Knoxville,
Term., a port of entry.
At 5:20 p. m. the House adjourned.

ADRIFT ON A DREDGER.
KISS WICK, Cal., March 2.â This morn
ing the large dredger that for a year or so
past has been working on the Sacramento
River below this place broke from its
moorings owing to the high water. Only

craft clear of obstructions and called
loudly for help from the shore. A num
ber of men followed along the bank and
succeeded in mooring the dredger after it
had made a perilous journey of four miles
down the stream. No damage was done,
although it will be expensive to work it

SEEK TO PROVE
SELF-DEFENSE
Testimony of Sheriff Mar
tin and One of His
Men.
Deputy Price Says the Lattimer
Strikers Were Armed With
Revolvers.
Swears to the Statement That Ho
Felt of Their Pocket* Before
the Shooting.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., March Â«.â
When court opened this morning for
the continuation of'the trial of Sheriff
Martin and his deputies for the shoot
ing of the strikers at Lattimer, Sheriff
Martin's cross-examination was re
sumed by the counsel for the prosecu
tion. The main point established was
that the witness denied making the re
mark after the shooting that he had
merely "taken a hand in the matter as
plain James Martin and not as the
Sheriff of Luzerne County."
The defense endeavored to have the
Sheriff testify that he was unable to
suppress the riot and disorder that ex
isted in the Hazelton region, and that
the civil authorities were unable to
cope with it and had telegraphed to
the Governor of Pennsylvania for aid.
and that, consequently, the Governor
ordered out the State militlaon the night
of September 10. The commonwealth
objected to this line of testimony, and
Judge Woodward sustained the objec
tion.
Samuel Price, a contractor and com
mission merchant of Hazelton, testified
that he was Sheriff Martin's chief dep
uty at the time of the shooting. He
told of the Sheriff giving all the depu
ties explicit orders to keep cool; to pro
tect all property and maintain the
peace. He also told them they were not
to shoot unless for self-protection.
The witness corroborated Martin's
testimony from the time the deputies
went on duty until they formed in line
at Lattimer and described the shooting
in detail. He said -that he discovered
by going among the strikers and feel
ing about their clothing that they were
armed with stones and revolvers. He
was put through a rigid cross-examina
tion, but he could not be made to con
tradict himself. He did not know who
gave the order to shoot, but did not fire
a shot himself.
At the forenoon session Ario Platt,
one of the deputies, gave a description
of the shooting. The witness saw the
Sheriff halt the strikers at Lattimer
on September 10, and advise them to
disperse, but was knocked down. A- M.
j Hess, a civil engineer of Hazelton. who
; commanded Company A of the depu
i ties, corroborated Platt in his testi-
m ony. He hoard one shot first, like a
I pistol shot, then came the volley.

SANTA CLARA, March 2.â ln the
course nf his flight from the scene of
the murder of Charles A. Andrews in
the Grand Hotel at Baden last Novem
ber. James Willetts, now under arrest,
and one of the m.-n suspected of hav
ing been implicated in that affair, be
came acquainted with Edward Gabriel
this town. He eventually became
confidential and related all the facts
leading up to the crime, the details of
it and the story of how he had eluded

tence of death.
At the time Willetts made the sensa

reported the matter to the authorities,
but before the necessary information j
reached the place where Willetts made
'these admissions he had left for other

Gabriel's story is clear and replete
with details that tend to s=how he had

This is Gabrifl's story:
"During the month of November, 1897,
I was engaged in farming near Salida,
In Stanislaus County. On the following
.kygiving; I went to Ripo-n, and
â¢ . met a man- who gave his name as

Hotel, which was run by Pat Farriter.

o'clock in the morning before we could

some whisky. Farriter said we could

night. :

WILLETTS, IN JAIL HERE,
CONFESSES HIS GUILT.
Willetts alias Leslie, who is accused of participation In the mur
der of Charles A Andrews at Baden some time ago, and who was ar
rested in Arizona, was brought to this city last night and locked up In
Sheriff Mansfield of San Mateo.

Th Greatest secrecy was maintained regarding the arrival of
Mansfield and his prisoner. After embarking from the ferryboat they
tobk a hack and drove to police headquarters, where Willetts was closely

TrSnT FvidenS satisfied 'hat he had told everything. Mansfield
thin escorted him to the City Prison, where he was registered under
In assumed name. The prison officials were instructed by Mansfield not
to - say â¢ word" to the reporters, as he was anxious that Willetts' arri
yal Jus^whatNvmetts^aid in his confession. Sheriff Mansfield and the
detectives who were present, refuse to say.
They admit, however, he "told everything" and did not attempt to
â  Bhle !f short time ago C. M. Raymond, alias Moore, who Is under sen
tence of death for his participation in the murder, made an alleged
confession, exonerating a man named Winters, who has also been con
victed of the crime, and Implicating Willetts. The latter, he claimed,
fired the shot that killed Andrews.
When asked by Sheriff Mansfield if Raymond's confession was
true. Willetts vehemently replied that his alleged accomplice was a
linx â¢ â 
"He is trying to save his own neck," he is said to have remarked.
"Wait until my turn comes and I will show who murdered Andrews."
Sheriff Mansfield leaves with his prisoner this morning for Redwood
City where' he will at once be tried for his participation in the murder.
Since the cowardly murder of Andrews, the Sheriff of San Mateo
Tountv assisted by Captain of Detectives Bohen and his men, has
been striving to apprehend Willetts. After the killing Willetts came to
this city -nd for several days associated with the tramps who infest
the â¢â¢dumps" at the foot of Sixth street. In some way the local police
''learned of his whereabouts and a concerted effort was made to appre
hend him Wlllettsevidently became suspicious, and with two "hobos,"
hoarded a freight car. which was bound for San Jose. The authorities
of the Garden City were notified, but despite their efforts the alleged
murderer eluded them.
Just as Sheriff Mansfield was about giving up all hope of ever cap
turing the fugitive, word reached him that he had been caught in Ari
zona, and would he held pending the arrival of an officer from San
Mateo County.
then mafce a big turn. We started for
this room, but. by that time the house
was pretty well awakened.
â¢âºI leveled my gun to hold the people
up who had made their appearance.
Some one grabbed my hand and then
two others jumped on me, so that I got
no chance to shoot. A general scuffle
followed. While I was in the scuffle 1
thought it was all up with me, and I
sang out to Moore to pump it into
them. I told him that I was down and
to shoot high. I lost my hat and coat
in the scuffle. : Moore fired several
times, but had one or two shots left in
his gun. In the. scuffle I also lost my
revolver. I did not do any shooting at
all as I had no chance to do so.
"When Moore fired there was a gen
eral yell and movement among the peo
ple and this gave me a chance to
loosen my hold and get away. Moore
also got away with me. After we had
gone about 200 yards I asked Moore for
his revolver, as I wanted to go back
and kill Farriter. because I had it in
for him, as he dwme out of some
money when I worked for him. Moore
would not let me have the revolver.
" 'We then started to leave the neigh
borhood. We went back of Holy Cross
Cemetery, and there Moore made the
proposition that we better separate.
Moore went to San Francisco and I
went south. I got to an Italian milk
ranch and went in and told them that
I was drunk and had lost my hat. coat
and blankets. They gave me my break
fast and an old hat and coat. I had to
wait until daylight for breakfast.
â¢' 'When I again got out on the road
I met a wagun and got a ride. I saw
many people looking for me. They
passed me on the road. I rode in this
wagon as far as it went. I then walked
a little ways and ran across a homeless
dog. The dog followed me. That was
what kept those who were searching
for me from suspecting who I was.
They thought I was working on one of
the farms around there.
" 'I left the county road and kept off
of all roads, going across the country
from ranch to ranch. I walked night
and day until I got as far as Tracy.
Here I got a job on the levee, driving
a scraping team. I worked here three
days. Then I came on to Rlpon.' "
Gabriel then continued with further
particulars about Willetts, as follows:
"He said he had worked in Baden for
two weeks trying to get the lay of the
Western Meat Company, so as to hold
up the paymaster, but he could not
make it work. Moore had arranged to
rob the Electric Laundry in San Fran
cisco, he said, when he met Moore in
San Francisco and told him about the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 1898.
trick he had on hand at Baden. He
told Moore that the men paid their
board that night at Baden and that
there was between $400 and $500 there.
"He told me that the second day after
he got out of Folsom he held up a
commission man who lives in Oakland
and got $130 from him. Along in the
first part of October, he said, he held
up five or six men on Twenty-first and
Twenty-second streets and he had
passed many nights near the Emman
uel Church, and often thought of Dur
rant and the murders he had com
mitted there. Occasionally, he said,
he had to take a trip to San Jose and
do a trick there.
"Willetts said there was a third party
with them on the night of the Baden
robbery, but that he did not take any
part in the affair. This third man was
a tenderfoot, he said, and a bum, and
he did not want him on the deal. Moore.:
wanted him in, but Willetts objected
and the third man was not with them
when they went to the Grand Hotel to
rob it. Willetts did not mention the
name of this third party, but thought
he w^ould be arrested on suspicion of
being implicated with him and Moore.
"In Tracy he got hold of a newspaper,
and saw that Moore had been arrested.
| He said he thought it would be all day
| with him, and that they would catch
| the second party in a few days, as he
: was an ex-convict, but he said they
! would have a pretty hard time catch
; ing him.
"Willetts said he was the man who
was down in the scuffle, and showed
I me his finger, which had been hurt
i fro-m the trigger of his revolver when
jit was torn from his grasp. He said
i there was a fellow in the scuffle with a
I lamp, and he was afraid this man had
j recognized him. He said it would make
| no difference to him if he had to kill
! two or three men, as they could do no
i more to him. He did not seem to care
I whether he was hanged or not. He
i said he would rather hang than live
| ten years in Folsom again.
"When he first told me about the
Baden affair I thought he was half
witted or crazy, and paid little atten
tion. Afterward I told Constable Kier
j nan, who had frequently talked with
j Willetts. Kiernan wrote to Folsom and
i in return received the record of Willetts
| and his photograph. It was from this
photograph that I learned that John
' Henderson and James Willetts were
1 one and the same person. The record
also agreed with what Willetts had told
me of himself. In the meantime, how
! ever, Willetts had skipped out and they
I could not trace him."
Attorney P. B. Nagle Jr. of this city
defendeu Winters in the trial that re
sulted in his being sentenced to the gal
lows, and is much elated that new evi
dence has come to light to assist his
client.
"I knew this man in San Jose could
be produced," he said, "and appealed
the case to the Supreme Court because
I knew that his evidence would be of
tbe greatest importance. Had I known
of his existence during the time of the
trial I think that Winters could have
easily been cleared. Much doubt has
been thrown on the confession of Ray
mond, but I think the statement of this
new witness shows that Raymond's
confession was genuine."
ANNIVERSARY OF POPE
LEO'S CORONATION,
Congratulations Tendered by the
High Dignitaries of the
Catholic Church.
ROME, March 2.â The twentieth an
niversary of the coronation of Pope
Leo XIII was celebrated to-day. His
Holiness, who was in excellent health,
received the congratulations of the
high prelates in the throne-room, re
plying in a strong voice. He recalled
the demonstrations upon the occasion
of his sacerdotal and pontifical anni
versaries and protested against the
outrages aimed at this enthusiasm,
which had been allowed to be com
mitted, adding that it was painful that
the aspirations of the faithful toward
Rome, the sacerdotal metropolis and
depository of divine oracles, should be
willfully misrepresented.
"But," continued his Holiness, "in
order to console the Papacy for these
outrages, God has increased the love of
the multitude for the Papacy and
Rome throughout the entire world."
State Officials Stop the Fight.
LITTLE ROCK. Ark., March 2.â The

ARROGANCE OF
THE MONOPOLY
Curt Note Addressed to
the City Council of Los
Angeles.
Water Company Refuses to
Furnish an Inventory
of Improvements.
Informs the Officials That Their De
mand Has Boon Referred to
Its Attorneys.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 2.â Up to
date the Los Angeles City Water Com- ;
pany has not supplied the Council with ;
the information requested over three j
weeks agoâ an inventory of the im
provements the water company has
made to the city's plant in the past
thirty years, and also an inventory of
what the plant consisted of at the time
the corporation took it. The water i
company has. by a note, stated that :
the request had been referred to the J
company's attorneys.
At the time the Council requested this
information it inserted a default clause
in the resolution embodying it. Now
the question arises, What is the Coun
cil going to do about it?
The water company is clearly In de
fault in failing to give the desired in
formation, which Is essential to any
proposition looking to the purchase of
the improvements at a figure to be
fixed by a board of arbitration. The
subterfuge of referring the matter to
the company's attorneys is a thin one.
It has been used time and again by
the corporation to avoid doing some
thing the Council had ordered or in
structed it to do. What the citizens
are asking now is: Will the Council
enter a default on the water company's
contract? The Council last Monday
acted very independently, and it may
do so again.
The syndicated daily press and the
water company seem to have lost their
influence and control over several
Councilmen.

of Rev. McGlynn.
Kansas City Paper Says the

By the Publication the Relation Is

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, March 2.â A special to
the Herald from Kansas City, Mo.,
9ays: The World to-night prints a
story concerning the excommunication '
of Dr. McGlynn of New York, in 1886, ;
which it alleges was divulged to-day !
for the first time by "a friend of Dr.
McGlynn in Kansas City."
The story is to the effect that Arch
bishop Ireland, when at *b* Vatican
recently, expresed to the Pope his
pleasure that the ban on McGlynn hai
been removed, whereupon the Pope re
plied with amazement that there never
had been a ban on McGlynn; that he
had never been excommunicated by !
Papal authority. It is further stated
that the investigation then set on foot
revealed the fact that the cablegram,
under which McGlynn was excommu
nicated, was forged.
The story concludes: "For the sake
of peace, which had been restored to
the Catholic Church in America, the I
! matter was never given to the public, i
; and when they learned the World was \
'â¢ in possession of the facts, several Kan
: sas City clergymen urged that the
', story be suppressed. They declared it
j would reopen old wounds and undo all
that Satolli accomplished while here." ;

ENDS LIFE WITH
CARBOLIC ACID

Poison.

vorced Wife.
Swallows tha Drug and. Then Lies
Down to Die in a Livery Stablo
Manger.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, March 2.â The report
reached this city to-day that John A.
Eubanks, an old resident of Monterey
! County, committed suicide yesterday
; afternoon in Soledad by drinking the
contents of a two-ounce bottle of car
bolic acid. The motive is not known.
Eubanks had been away from town
for two or three weeks and returned
only yesterday morning. One of the
first visits he made after returning was
to see his former wife, who procured
a divorce from him last December. It
is supposed that Eubanks made over
tures for a reconciliation, in which he
was unsuccessful.
Early yesterday afternoon Eubanks
went to Dr. Stover's office and asked
for some carbolic acid. The doctor
supposed it was for a sore on one of
Eubanks" hands. After the acid was
obtained and pocketed some laudanum
was asked for, but was promptly re
fused. Eubanks left the store and went
to a livery stable, where he asked the
keeper to let him take a rest on the
hay, giving as a reason that he felt
quite tired.
About ten minutes after the man lay
down Frank Miller, the proprietor of
the stable, heard groans coming from
Eubanks. Going to the spot he saw
the man in the throes of death. An
empty bottle lay by his side. His shoes
and coat were off and the latter had
been used as a pillow. A physician
was summoned, but before he arrived
Eubanks had breathed his last.
From those who best knew the de
ceased it was learned that he had often
complained of heart trouble, and dur
ing his career in this county had had
many business troubles. He had lived
in Soledad for over twenty years, and
was one of the most respected citizens
there. He kept a hotel there for a long
while. He was somewhat intemperate
in his habits, and of late years had
followed no regular occupation. Five
or six children survive him. He was
a native of Arkansas and about 52 years
of age.

STRIKERS IN
AN UGLY MOOD
Grave Situation at Lp-
Grange Mine in
Trinity.
The Company Determined to
Resist the Demands of
the Men.
Bloodshed May Follow an Attomp ,
to Put on a Force of
Coolies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, March 2.â The strike sit*
uation at La Grange mine near Weaâ
verville is assuming a grave aspect.
Reports of a more or less alarming,
j nature are coming to town regarding:
the hostile attitude of the striking;
miners, and it is feared that if any
attempt is made to fill their places with
Chinese or other underpaid laborers'
I there will be bloodshed. The strikers
I are more determined than ever to re
1 sist all attempts to open the mine with.
' outside help. ,
Superintendent Radford has reported
I the situation by wire to Hippolyte Dv
: vergy. secretary of the company, witlif
| offices in the Mills buildinsr. and in re^
! ply was instructed to stand firm ancy
| reeist the demands of the strikers.
Efforts are being made to enÂ«^Â°-*
miners from Shasta County, but it id
doubtful if a new force can be ob
! tamed in this quarter, as their fellow
miners here express strong sympathv-j
for the strikers.
The La Grange Company is a heav
| ily capitalized concern, incorporated
I under the laws of Colorado. Baron K.
I D. La Grange, of Paris, is the presi
dent. The hydraulic mines owned by
the company are the most extensive in
operation on the coast, and a vast
i amount of capital has been expended in.
! improvements. The shutdown entails a.
loss of $1000 a day. This has been a bad
season in Trinity County, as the snow
fall has not been heavy enough to as
sure a good supply of water for thÂ»
many operating gravel mines, though
the La Grange Company, by the ex
penditure of several hundred thousand
dollars in digging canals and laying
siphon pipe lines, is now enabled to
| work throughout most of the summer
months. This st.-iko, however, is every*
I where regarded as most unfortunate.

A NATIONAL DISGRACE.
THE Senators and Representatives who have
started for Cuba in the pay of a notorious and
unclean sheet would better be at Washing
ten trying to earn their salaries. The junket
is a disgraceful affair, and no participant can expect
to retain a hold on public respect. Even when selling
out, a Senator has been known to do it in a decently
dignified way. In the present instance there can be
iio ostensible decency, and there is no element of
dignity. Every one of the officials who shall con
tribute a line to the paper 'whose staff of fakers he
has joined will deserve to be forced out of public life.
He brings reproach upon the distinguished body of
which he has mistakenly been made a member, and if
the Senate has no power to expel him, at least his
resignation may be demanded from another source.
BERKELEY ON EXHIBITION.
I N the gentlemen chosen to rule the destinies of
Berkeley there is no denying that city has an ex
* cellent nucleus for a zoological exhibit worth
going miles to see. The Trustees have decreed that
anybody desiring to give a dance must first secure
their permission. Naturally no attention will be paid
to a fool order of this sort, and the result will be that
the places at which the ordinance is aimed will openly
defy it. The Trustees seam to think â if anything they
may do can be regarded as a mental process â that ?.
respectable citizen who wishes to entertain his friends
may not permit waltzing in his parlor without a
license. Perhaps school children who take the liberty
of stepping in time to the music of the chance hand
organ will find that they have violated the law and
be haled howling to the calaboose. It is strange
that if the musical ear of Berkeley is annoyed and
its moral tone endangered by nocturnal revels it can
not remedy the ill without making an unholy show
of itself. A man's house is his castle, even in Berke
ley, and to dance therein until the plaster falls is his
inalienable privilege. Not only, this, but he would be
false to his birthright if, when a minion of the law
6ought to interfere, he did not whack the nose of the
same and kick him clear across the lawn and into the
highway.
A WISE CONCLUSION.
INDEFINITE postponement will probably be the
fate of the ill-considered proposition on the part
of the Supervisors to impose a special tax upon
the lise of premises extending beneath the sidewalks.
The committee to whom the matter was referred is
reported to have decided to recommend that it be
disposed of that way, and next to killing the scheme
directly that is perhaps the best way of dealing
frith it. : .-'
Had the proposed tax been imposed it would have
been something unique in American municipalities,
or at least among cities of anything like the rank of
San Francisco. It would have been a distinction of
which we would not have been proud, and, moreover,
\t would have been not only an unjust imposition
Upon a certain class of citizens, but would have been
an unnecessary addition to the already cumbersome
Â«nd complex system of municipal taxation.
With respect to revenue and municipal expendi-
lure San Francisco is now in a position where a
penny saved is even more than a penny earned. We
need not more revenues, but less wasteful expendi
tures. The Supervisors would do well to stop their
search after subjects for taxation and seek a little
more earnestly after some means for economically
using the money they have. There is little need to
dive down under the sidewalks to find something
more to tax when in the open light of day on the
streets and in the City Hall they can find ample
epportttnities for reducing expenditures and saving
a good deal more than the suggested tax would have
brought in.
Indefinite postponement is the proper fate for the
proposed scheme, though we do not like to see the
Supervisors indefinitely postpone anything. It
seems to be getting a habit with them. There is the
indefinite postponement of the construction of the
Hall of Justice, for instance. If a new tax is required
let one be imposed on every contractor for public
work for each day that he exceeds the time called for
by his contract for completing the work. That will
speedily bring us either more revenues or better
work.

HAWAII COUNTY, COLIFORNIO.
I~*HE annexation press accompanied its recent
announcement of the withdrawal of the treaty
with the statement that such action will be fol
lowed by a joint resolution annexing Hawaii as a
county to California.
A constitutional study of this proposition is not
without interest. In the fundamental law there is no
authority given to Congress to attach new territory
to an existing State as a county thereof. Nor is
there any authority given to a State to accept such
addition to its territory. The constitution says that
no new State shall be formed within the jurisdiction
of another State, nor shall a new State be formed by
junction of two or more States or parts of States
without the consent of the Legislature as well as
of Congress. It was under this provision that the
State of West Virginia was formed out of Virginia.
But in that case a Legislature, recognized by Con
gress, in Virginia assented to the division. Much ill
feeling was caused by the manner in which that Leg
islature was organized, and the issue was one of the
causes of great embitterment of the South against
the Federal Government. It gave rise to the repudia
tion policy of old Virginia which put Senator Ma
hone for a time in power. But in the long run the
division has proved best for both States, as their ter
ritory was delimited by a natural frontier and their
industrial destinies were on divergent lines.
Congress may attach unorganized to organized
territory, as the territory now comprising Wisconsin
and lowa was attached to Michigan. On the admis
sion of the latter as a State in 1837 Wisconsin, under
the act of 1836, became separate territory.
It is probable that under these precedents Hawaii
could be attached to the territory of Alaska, but not
to the State of California. The constitution of this
State bounds the territory which shall comprise the
State of California. Congress has no authority to
change that boundary, as it has none to amend the
constitution of a State. It may amend the proposed
constitution under which a State asks admission into
the Union and may change the proposed boundaries,
as it did with the first constitution of lowa in 1846,
but then the Territory may refuse to enter the Union
with the changed boundary, as lowa did. But after
the State is admitted Congress loses power over its
boundary, except in case of its division into two or
more States, which may be by assent of its Legisla
ture, as in the Virginia case. But in no event does
the constitution empower Congress to add to the ter
ritory of a State or a State to accept such addition.
Latitudinarians may make an argument, under the
"general welfare" clause, for creating the county of
Hawaii, California. If they prevail and accomplish
what is proposed, what will follow?
The people of Hawaii, now on her soil, will become
citzens, not electors, of the United States, and under
the Federal constitution "shall be entitled to all the
privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
States."
The State of California cannot legislate against the
right of any one in the county of Hawaii to change
his residence to any other county in the State, nor
can any other State exclude them from its jurisdic
tion. The State constitution forbids special legisla
tion against their choice of domicile in California,
and the Federal constitution makes them free com
moners of the Union.
The 40,000 Asiatics in Hawaii County could come
and go as they please.
If this plan materialize it will become an issue in
this year's campaign in California. Are the Repub
lican papers which favor annexation prepared to go
to the people with a proposition to add so heavily to
our Asiatic population? Have we not national and
State issues enough already to call for every energy
of the Republican party in carrying this State next
fall?
The Call has opposed annexation for public and
not partisan reasons, believing that service to the
public interest is the best work for party. Annexa
tion in any form burdens the Republican party in the
coming campaign. As the treaty is dead, it should
be the shroud of the whole proposition.
THE POWER OF THE BOSS.
DR. H. J. B. WRIGHT of San Jose, in an ad
dress from which elaborate extracts were yes
terday published in The Call, directed the
attention of the voters of that city to the power exer
cised by the local political boss and the pernicious
influence it has upon municipal affairs. The doctor
gave specific instances where citizens having business
relating to street and school work had been referred
by Councilmen and by School Trustees to the boss
for an answer. The officials in each case added:
'"Whatever is satisfactory to him will be satisfactory
to me."
In the instances cited by Dr. Wright the business
which the" citizens had with the Council and with the
School Board was perfectly legitimate. There was
nothing in either case which the officials might not
have brought up and decided in open meeting.
There was no taint of a job, no suggestion of boodle
involved in either application. Still the officials did
not feel free to act without the boss. His consent
had to be obtained for the performance of legitimate
duties as well as in matters that have to be kept dark
for fear of exchanging a seat in the City Hall for a
cell at San Quentin.
It is a perplexing study to determine where the
boss derives such powers as these. The development
of his existence in American politics is one of the
most extraordinary features of the times. As a rule
power carries with it responsibility but the boss has
no responsibility. Great service worthily done natur
ally gives the performer power in the community, but
the boss renders no service. He has no power of
office, nor of intellect, nor of wealth, nor of social
position. Nevertheless he rules the free and restive
people of the United States with apparent ease. It
matters not to him which party triumphs, which fac
tion succeeds, what policies are voted up or down,
what principles are sustained or rejected. Serene
amid the clash of parties, undisturbed by the votes on
election day, he holds on his way, and when the elect
of the people are installed into office he appears be
fore them and calmly proceeds to dictate what they
shall do.
There have been some bosses in the country whose
political power is partially explained by their zeal in
promoting public improvements. Such men as Boss
Shepard in Washington and Boss Tweed in New
York, by undertaking great works and providing em
ployment for the people even while they tolerated
and shared a general plunder of the taxpayers, per
formed something that appealed to the civic pride of
the rich and the necessities of the poor; but the
average boss does nothing of that kind. He gener
ally opposes public enterprises and municipal im
provements, does not care even to keep the streets
clean or well lighted, and carries on every department
of municipal government in the most shiftless wav
possible, preferring generally to enrich himself and
bis creatures by a. species of petty larceny from funds
THE SAltf FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 1898.
provided for routine work rather than venture upon |
the big schemes of Shepard and of Tweed.
Some light is thrown upon the problem by the
statement in Dr. Wright's address that when the citi
zens referred to had in due form made application to
the boss he granted their requests, but they were in- j
formed, "Of course if we should need your help at j
any time we should expect you to stand in with us."
The boss, it will be seen, gives nothing. Every fa
vor has to be paid for. The honest citizen cannot get j
legitimate business transacted without giving a
pledge to stand in on any job when the boss wants
him.
Against this form of city government San Toseans
are in revolt. They desire to have their municipal af- j
fairs in the hands of responsible officials instead of 1
in that of an irresponsible boss. The fight they are
making is a part of that widespread movement now
sweeping over the whole country, which is destined
to give to boss domination in politics an end even
more sudden than its rise. May their victory be com
plete.
A LESSON FOR FREEHOLDERS.
THE Board of Freeholders engaged in preparing
a charter for this city may, if they choose, obtain
inspiration by studying the governmental ex
periment now being tried in Greater New York. Al
though the charter under which New York was con
solidated with Brooklyn and adjacent cities has been
in operation only about two months, the people are
already becoming tired of it. While the instrument
was in course of preparation the politicians at Albany
declared that an era of milk and honey would be
ushered in the moment their work was finished. The
project was carried through the Legislature mainly
on the theory that it would cheapen and render effi
cient the old government with which nearly every
body was thoroughly disgusted.
As things have turned out, however, the public has
been grossly deceived. Instead of having been cheapen
ed the government of Greater New York has been made
more expensive than ever. In order to keep the ap
propriations down Mayor Van Wyck has been com
pelled to recommend that many offices created by
the charter be not filled. It has been shown that the
borough system, out of which the charter-makers de
clared that a heavenly government would surely pro
ceed, is going to cost many thousands of dollars
more than was expended upon the local governments
which it has displaced. Each of the five boroughs
now comprising Greater New York has its president,
with a salary of from $3000 to $5000 a year, and ac
cording to all accounts not one of them has a thing
to do. All the borough boards have engineers, secre
taries, clerks and superintendents in abundance. The
salary roll thus created promises in the near future
tc swamp the taxpayers.
The cost of legislating for the new city has been
increased enormously. The Municipal Assembly,
consisting of eighty-nine members, has a salary roll
of $173,000 per annum, which is double what it cost
to maintain all the local councils displaced by it.
Moreover, this assembly has no real authority. Its
time so far has been consumed in passing silly reso
lutions and granting permits for parades and boot- j
black stands. The real source of political power is !
still at Albany, and the officials of the city for two j
months have done nothing but suggest bills for the
amelioration of the evils which are constantly being |
developed as the charter is examined and enforced, j
It is said that over one hundred amendments are !
pending in the Legislature designed to change the
Charter and interfere with some local function. The j
"larger measure of home rule" promised by the
politicians who conceived consolidation is, therefore, j
shown to be a farce.
The source of all the trouble is said to be the fact
that the Charter Commission authorized to consoli
date the municipal governments about Manhattan
Island attempted to frame an entirely new system of
government. The members of that body, as one
Gotham paper remarks, "shut their eyes to the teach
ings of experience in municipal government the
world over for the past half century and took the po
sition that the mere act of consolidation would so
transform human nature that what had failed utterly
in the past would succeed here in the future.'" The
commission abandoned simplicity and adopted com
plexity, set aside experience and adopted theory, flew
from existing evils to others they knew not of, and
produced muddle and befuddlement everywhere.
There is a lesson in all this for the local charter
makers. There is one thing the latter should ever bear
in mind: Constitutions and charters, like houses, come
into being slowly. They are made by laying stone
upon stone and brick upon brick and by carefully
measuring each corner and holding a plummet
against each wall. A builder who abandoned ex
perience in constructing an edifice would be ac
counted crazy. Yet in making laws men unhesitat
ingly adopt the theories of cranks and regard the
idle imaginings of politicians as the wisdom of the
learned.
The Flan-nelly murder trial is certain to attract in
terest. It is comparatively seldom that a man shoots
his old father and then has the nerve to plead self
defense. However, if the prisoner can make out a
good case there will be no course but to overlook an
act due to circumstances which must have been pain
ful to him and hang him for the murder of an offi
cer, which occurred soon after. Perhaps a man who
had been hanged for shooting an officer could make
his later explanations with less embarrassment than
if he had been thus treated for shedding the blood of
a parent The public is willing that Flannclly be
given every reasonable chance.
Doubtless there are large quantities of gold in the
far north, but nevertheless persons who are ready to
guide prospectors to a place where each man can
wash out $100 a day may excuse a credulous public
for viewing them with suspicion. The natural im
pulse of a possessor of such knowledge would be to
pet a chance at the virgin field himself. However,
perhaps the preference for securing gold ready
minted is not surprising.
Doctors in discussing the outbreak of fever along
the Klondike trail have not managed to make public
much information that was not already common
property. But when they ascribe it to the activity of
the micrococcus lanccolatus encapsulatus it must be
admitted that they are telling something of which a
portion of the community had been ignorant.
If all the people who think they know all about
the cause of the Maine's explosion could get their
ideas on record the board of inquiry would accumu
late a mess of rubbish out of which there would be
no possibility of drawing a conclusion.
Governor Bushnell's idea of erecting a memorial
monument upon the ruins of Morro Castle seems a
little premature just now, but the time may come
when it will be looked back to as having been al
most prophetic.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Ernest Lent will appear both as violon
cello soloist anU composer at the ninth
symphony concert, March 24. at the Tlvoll
Opera House, as the management has
seized the opportunity of this well-known
musician's visit to California to engage
him. Ernest Lent was born in Branden
burg, Germany. He studied at the Leip- )
sic Conservatory under Reinecke, Klen
gel, Schroeder and others, and after
graduating accepted a professorship at
the Koenigsberger Conservatory. He soon
made a tour through Northern Germany,
Denmark. Sweden and after further work !
in Buda-Pesth and Switzerland came to
this country as a member of the Metro
politan Opera House Orchestra. For the 1
last few years he has been the conductor
of the Georgetown Orchestra and the La
dles' String Orchestra of Washington, D.
C. Among his published compositions are

Orchestra.
a trio for piano, violin and cello; cradle
song and spinning song 1 for piano, four
hands; numerous piano solos and soprano
songs, besides a number of orchestral
works, one of which, "Suite Erotlque," for
strings, with horn and harp obligato, will
be performed by the Symphony Orches
tra. Mr. and Mrs. Lent are coming here
to visit Mrs. Lent's sister, who is the wife
of Professor Ross of Stanford University.

Baron Franchetti. the well-known Ital
ian-Jewish composer, has just secured a
divorce from his wife, Margueret Levi, at
Munich, in Bavaria. In order that the
sentence may also hold good in Italy,
Franchetti has had all the evidence
brought before the Court of Appeals at
Modena. Franchetti is a many times mil
lionaire, with much more than the aver
age dilettante's genius for music. His
first opera that made any stir was "As
rael," the first act of which is laid in
hell and the second in heaven. The young
composer spent a fortune in staging the
work at La Soala, Milan. Celebrated
painters were called into consultation,
and both the "paradiso" and "inferno"
scenes surpassed in a scenic way any
thing that had ever been seen at La
Scala. The "hell" ballet was a dream of
lurid magnificence, and the "paradiso"
was represented by a mammoth flight of
golden stairs, half veiled in silk gauze,
studded with glittering stars. The sing
ers were dressed like Dante Gabriel Ros
setti's angels, and had huge wings of real
white ostrich feathers. Franchetti wanted
to conduct "Asrael" himself. Faccio, the
conductor of La Scala, refused to give
up his baton, even to a millionaire, and a
regular row ensued, which resulted in the
triumph of Faccio. "Asrael," which is
very Wagnerian in its tendencies, had
much more than a success of esteem.
Since its production Franchetti has pro
duced a number of operas, with varying
success. They have all shown undoubted
talent, but have just fallen short of great
ness. Not long ago he built himself a
magnificent theater at one of his country
houses that operatic works might be per
formed for his own amusement. It is
said that the baron never loved Margue
ret Levi. In his student days at Dresden
he fell passionately in love with a young
American student of singing and pro
posed marriage. His family would only
agree to the match on condition that the
young lady embraced the Jewish faith.
She refused to give up her own religion,
and the young people parted. Later on
he married to please his mother, who was
a Rothschild.
A singular scene took place the othex
night at the Brunetti Theater In Bologna
during the performance of Puccini's
"Manon Lescaut." Bolis, the basso (Ger
onte), did not give popular satisfaction
and the audience let him know it with
that frankness which is characteristic of
Italian audiences. Bolls, who expected
quite a different sort of reception, lost
his temper and running to the footlights
shouted: "Good night" (Buona sera), and
dashed off the stage. The audience grew
indignant because he would not come
back and the curtain was finally lowered.
It happened that the chief of police was
in the theater and he promptly went be-
hind the scenes to remonstrate with the
recalcitrant Bolls. Instead of showing
the respect due to the chief's office Bolis
gave the official a bit of his mind and
defied all the police of Bologna to make
him go back on the stage. The climax
to the controversy was that the chief
ordered Bolis to be arrested and the
basso spent the rest of the night In dur
ance vile.
That the phonograph can be utilized In
a hundred different ways is already well
known, but the following story, vouched
for by a Berlin newspaper, is certainly
something new: Anna Lankow, a New
York singing teacher, desired a short
time ago to get some of her pupils to
sing for the director of the Imperial
Opera of Berlin. To send them from
New York to the capital of Prussia, how
ever, on the mere chance of securing en
gagements would have been too costly a
risk to run. Mrs. Lankow -was not to be
beaten, however, and she made each of
her pupils sing an operatic selection into
a phonograph and sent the cylinders to
the director of the Berlin Opera. He in
his turn presented the cylinders to the
examining committee and two of the
pupils have been engaged, so to speak,
phonographicailv. The difficulty with this
sort of examination Is. however, that It
must be c|g!cult for the director to know
whether the person he is engaging is
really the singer who sang into the pho
nograph.
To Judge from newspaper reports a
great composer has just been revealed in
Sylvlo Lazzari. a young man .who has
had several compositions produced at a
concert at the Casino, Monte Carlo. The
works that the critics rave over most are
the prelude to his lyric drama "Aemor,"
a suite in F, which has an especially
beautiful "scherzo," two little choruses,
with harp accompanl/er.t, "The Bird"
and "In Spring" and a couple of songs,
"Never More" and "Calmede la Nuit."
The Paris Figaro says of the young com
poser: "This concert has shown us the
very serious qualities possessed by Laz
zari. He has a very noble though rather
severe inspiration, a perfect command
over the resources of his art. a praise
worthy tendency toward certain daring
innovations, a constant desire to strive
after what is new and good luck in find
ing It, and above all, a perfect command
over the resources of the orchestra."
It is remarkable how many long-haired
critics and melomaniacs- cry out that
Italian opera is dead and burled and that
German opera is the only music that
will satisfy the masses. In spite of all
their cries Italian opera continues to live
and flourish. Hackneyed Italian operas,
as "La Traviata," have paid better than
any others at the Metropolitan this sea
son, Walter Damrosch's fame as a con
ductor of German opera notwithstanding,
and in spite of the cry that Italian opera
!s to be shelved at the next Covent Gar
den season, the latest news from London
is to the effect that seven of the operas
will be in German, seven in French and
eight in Italian.
The San Carlos Opera-house at Lisbon
boasts of a singer who is known as the
"Tenor-Actor- Journalist-Novelist." This
universal genius, who bears the name of
Guglielmo Anastasi, is meeting with im
mense success in his vocal capacity. His
triumph in "Andrea Chenier" was cut
short by the Portuguese police, who ob
jected to the opera because it. contains
the "Marseillaise." but the literary tenor,
not to be daunted, has now become quite
a popular idol in "Mario Wetter" and in
Puccini's "La Boheme."
Adelina Patti has gone to San Remo,
on the Riviera, accompanied by her maid,
two chambermaids, two footmen and her
head butler. She occupies a splendid
suite of apartments in the Royal Hotel,
adjoining those occupied by the Princess
Trani. Patti is dressed in the deepest
mournine. and receives no one. T. c ru
mor at San Remo is that she will remain
in absolute seclusion for six weeks and
that then she will probably go io Flor
ence.
Nicollni left behind him a fortune of
about a million â reckoned In irancs. In
his will he div^âu the money between
Patti and his three children by his first
marriage; but Patti has renounced her
share of the wealth. Some of the foreigrn
papers, notably II Trovatore, criticize
her for this, as they say Patti might
have founded a home for destitute and
aged artists with t.e money she herself
did not need.
A grand festival of Widows works was
given the other day at Lille, Belgium,
with marked success, the composer con

Cremonini, the handsome tenor who was
so popular at the Metropolitan Opera

haste to Italy for Borgatti, another
warbler of the Cremonini ilk.

The other night Mr. Walsh was on his
way home along Montgomery street when
he was stopped by several gentlemen in
front of the Occidental and. was told that
they were having a dispute as to whether
a certain tune was "Tantum Ergo" or
"Adeste Fideles," and asked if he would
kindly hum the latter to settle the ques
tion. Would Walsh hum it? Well, rather!
He would do more than that, lie would
sing it for them as It ought to be sung.
He threw out his chest, and while the
enraptured audience stood speUbound
with admiration, went through the piece
from beginning to end. Just as he had
finished an old woman emerged from out
the shadow of a neighboring doorway
| and said: "Sure, 'tis yerself thot's th'

Walsh stammered for. a moment, then,
with a face like a thtrhrter-cloul. he van
ished up the street. He Is now looking
for the man who put up the job, and thu
clerk on California street who wants to
cross the bay has merely got to say to
him, "Adeste Fideles."

It Took the Combined
Efforts of Two Tugs to
Move the Speke.
She Was Hard and Fast in
Oakland Creek and Wanted
to Remain There.
ThÂ© Bark Alaska Also Stuck in the
Mud, Jind It Took Two Tug 3
to Get Her Off.
The British ship Speke was flnally
got out of the mud yesterday. Tne
tugs Sea King and Sea Queen went
over to her last Tuesday and worked
on her all of one tide, but could not
budge her. Yesterday they went over
there again and the Sea Queen was em
ployed for four hours in dredging .1
passageway for the ship. She was
backed into the mud and her wheel cut
the passageway in its revolutions.
Backing and filling in this way for four
hours made it possible for another at
tempt to be made. Then both the
tugs passed their hawsers over to Cap
tain Wainwright on the Speke, each
tug made another hawser fast to their
winches and these were sent ashore
and made fast to the mooring bits on
the wharf. Then, when all was ready.
th.c two tugs went ahead at full speed,
the winches were started going and
after thirty minutes of steady work
the big ship gave in and moved grace

The British ship Speke was run so hard and fast into the mud of Oakland Creek last December that it took
the tugs Sea King and Sea Queen two days to get her out again. The Queen was engaged for four hours dredg
ing out a channel for the big vessel, and then both tugs made fast to the Speke. Two more hawsers were made
fast to the wharf and then to the tugs' winches. There was thus the driving power of the two screws and the
heaving power of the two winches at work and something had to give. It was the Speke. She stood the strain
for half an hour and then glided into deep water.
bay the Sea King left the job and the
Sea Queen went to the slips at Wheat
port, where she will load grain for Eu

The bark Alaska, which has been
fitted nut for a trip to Kotzebue Sound
by Captain Coogan, was in a similar
predicament to the Speke. She was
being towed from the mud flats to the
wharf; where her repairs were to be
. completed, when a heavy fog settled
down; The captain of the tug did not
care about dropping the bark, so he
ordered the captain to drop his anchor.
This was. done and the Alaska rode
at anchor in safety until the tide fell,
when she landed on a mud bank, where
she took such a list to starboard that
people were sure she was going to
turn right over. When the tide came
In she became upright again, but when
a tug' tried to dock her she refused to
come off the mud bank. Yesterday
two tugs were sent over and after an
hour of good hard pulling she also came
off and was safely docked at the coal
bunkers.
The steamers Walla Walla and State
of California both got away yesterday.
The Walla Walla took 19 cabin and 140
steerage, while the State of California
took away 350 all told. Many of the
passengers on the boats are bound for
the Klondike, while many more are
taking advantage of the cheap rates
over the Canadian and Northern Pa
cific railroads to the East. The Walla
Walla was nearly two hours late get
ting away, and will connect at Seattle
with the steamers Al-Ki and Queen
for Dyea and Skaguay. The Klondike
passengers on the steamer State of
California will connect with the Dyea-
Sknguay boat at Portland.
The steamer Tillamook will leave this
aiternao-n for Dyea and Skaguay. She
will take away about 100 passengers
from here, and seventy more are wait
ing for he* at Seattle. She will in the
future run between San Francisco and
Dyea direct.
A. terrific hurricane has been raging
in the southern seas. A cable to the
Merchants' Exchange says that the
British ship Falls of Garry was driven
ashore at Noumea, New Caledonia, and
was. full of water. Another dispatch
says that the French gunboat Loyalty
was also drivÂ«n ashore, and will prob
ably becc-me a total wreck. The crews
of both boats were saved.
IPli Â« Pacific Mail Company's steamer
City of Peking sails this afternoon for

be the Countess Festetics, who goes to

is there aboard the yacht Tolna.
Whether the cruise, which has now
lasted nearly four years, will come to
an end and the yacht returned to San
Francisco, or whether she will again
start for parts unknown, the Countess
refuses to state.
Louis Eppinger, M. Putnam of the
American Trading Company of Japan
and two men bound for Vladivostok,
are the only other cabin passengers by
the Peking.
Advices from Valparaiso state that
the steamer City of Columbia, which
struck on a rock entering that port,
damaged her rudder and keel, and sev

It is thought that the repairs will de

port that she will not be able to carry
any passengers in the Klondike trade
this year.

CLARKSON'S CASE
LOOKS VERY BAD
Held to Answer for Stealing
Gold From the Branch
Mint.
Application for a Reduction of Bail
From Five Thousand Dol
lars Was Refused.
William Clarkson, the dishonest Mint
employe, who stole several hundred dol- j
larÃ' worth of gold from the rolling-room, |
of which department he wag the foreman, j
was held to answer yesterday by United
States Court Commissioner Heacock. His j
bonds were fixed at $5000. Thomas D.
Riordan and A. P. Van Duzer. his attor
neys, made an ineffectual plea for a re
duction of bail. Deputy United States
Attorney Schlesinger resisted the motion.
It was usual, he said, to increase the
amount required for bail after a defen- |
dant was held to answer. In this case the j
bail remained the same. If it were re- j
duced it would look to the public as j
though the prosecution had a weak case J
against Clarkson.
A. T. Spotts of the Mint was examined
as to the shortages which he had dis
covered in the Mint for several months i
past. They were as follows: August. !
10.237 ounces; September, 12.600; October, ;
.350; November, 6.3J50; December. 7.560; j
January, 6.260; February, 8,510. The short- j
age by reason of legitimate waste does
not exceed a small fraction of 1 per cent ;
of the gold used. The shortage during j
the months named was over and above j
this percentage, that for February being !
4.32 ounces, of the value of $S0 32.
Detective Harry N. Morse told briefly
how he had caught Grocer Martin Eg- i
gers selling gold of the Mint fineness at j
Selby's assay office.
Eggers was placed on the Btand and |

told how he had received gold bullion
from Clarkson on several occasions and
how he had sold it at Selby's.
William McCartney, a horseshoer, tes
tified that Clarkson brought gold to his
forge and had him melt it.
"Knowing that Clarkson was in the <
Mint and that he must have come by it
dishonestly, why did you melt the gold ]
for him?" was anked.
"He exercised a peculiar power over j
me," replied the horpeshoer. "It seemed
as If I couldn't refuse him."
Mr. Riordan coughed sarcastically and
proceeded to cross-examine the witness
on the subject of hypnotism, but wns
cut short by an objection from the prose
cution. Judge Heacock remarking at the
same time that he did not believe in hyp
notism in such cases.
POLICEMAN NAYLOR THE HERO OF MARKET STREET.
Policeman F. C. Naylor was the hero of a great crowd on Market street
yesterday afternoon. He was on "crossing duty" at Market street and
Grant avenue at about 6 o'clock, when the crowds are thickest ami the care
run on quartor-minute schedule. A Japanese boy In the act of crossing the
Htreet stopped In the center of the track of the cable carÃ with his atten
tion attracted to some object along the sidewalk and did not notice the
approach of a Halght-street car coming at him at almost full speed. The
Ki-lpman'e uttentlon was not along the track in front jjf him, and he did noi
notice the boy until his car was within a. few feet of the lad. Then he be
rame rattled, and. Instead of applying the brakes, threw up both handÃ In
horror at the seeming unpreventable annihilation of the youth. Naylor was
standing a few feet away. He called to the lad. but his warning was un
heeded, and hundreds of people on the street turned their eyes away, fear
ful to look upon the dreadful fate that awaited the boy. Then came a cheer
of relief, and Policeman Naylor was the hero of the crowd. He had rushed
In front of the car and grasped the lad in his arms, but before he could
escape from the tracks with his burden the car struck him, sending him
spinning along the pavement. He managed to retain his feet and with the
lad in his arms, and stunned by the blow he had received, he staggered to
one side and the car went rattling by. The boy was saved and then the
crowd cheered. Women pushed through the throng that surrounded the
officer and his half-conscious burden to grasp his hand and bless him.
The boy only arrived in America a few weeks ago, and could not speak
English. He could give no account of himself, and after he had recovered
he went away. About an hour later he waa back on Market street with a
fellow-countryman hunting up the policeman, and with a bow he introduced
his friend.
"This boy," the friend said, "wants me to thank you for your act this
afternoon in saving his life." While the friend was speaking the boy bowed
in the Japanse way and mutely expressed his gratitude.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 1898.
DRAGGING
ALONG WEARILY
End of the Harbor Com
missioners' Suit Not
Yet in Sight.
Governor Budd Will Be Called
to Testify to Material
Matters.
The Defendants Expect to Be Able to
Impeach Testimony Given
by Bibb.
The end of the trial of the injunction
suit of the Parafflne Paint Company
against the Board of State Harbor
Commissioners is not yet in sight. It
was expected that the defense would
be able to conclude Its case yesterday,
but it was only an expectation. The
trial dragged heavily along and noth
ing new or of particular interest was
elicited. Governor Budd was called to
the witness stand to impeach a por
tion of the testimony given by D. H.
Bibb against Commissioner Colnon, but
the proper foundation for impeachment
proceedings had not been laid and the
attorneys for the plaintiff objected to
each and every question asked, receiv
ing favorable rulings from Judge Bel
cher in every instance. Bibb will be
recalled by the defendants, and when
the proper foundation is laid, Governor
Budd will be asked to either deny or
affirm the accuracy of statements made
by Bibb concerning an interview he
had with him at the Palace Hotel.
L. F. Long, who succeeded Patter
son of superintendent of repairs along
the water front, was the first witness
called yesterday by the defendants. He
testified that during his term of ser
vice under the Harbor Commission he
had ordered about 800 piles to be used
in repair work. The San Francisco
Timber Preserving Company had re
ceived over three-quarters of the or
ders.
Lawrence Buckley, at one time Po
lice Court Clerk, but now employed as
foreman of the land pile driver, testi
fied that the piles delivered to him for
use were generally up to the stand
ard. A few of the piles delivered did
not meet the requirements of the speci
fications and he rejected them.
Buckley, in answer to questions
asked by Attorney Cope, representing
the Parafflne Paint Company, testified
that quite a number of spruce piles had
been used along the water front. Some
of them were driven at the ferry land
ing, some at the foot of Spear street i
and the others in repair work at J
Steuart street wharf.
"Are you related by marriage to P.
F. Dundon of the Darby Laydon Com
pany?" asked Attorney Cope.
"1 am not," replied Buckley; "nor am
I a friend of Dundon. He tried hard j
to get the place I now hold for another |
man."
"Have any undersized piles been
driven?"
"Not to my knowledge," answered
the witness.
William Curley, who is employed on
:he repair driver, testified that all <>f
Lhe piles driven by his crew were in i
good condition. Spruce piles had been
used, however, in the work of repair
ing Steuart street wharf.
Patrick Murphy and Thomas Carroll,
who were next called, testified that
they had handled spruce piles on the
repair job at the foot of Steuart street.
William Walsh, whose duty It is to
inspect the work of qreosoting the piles
at the works of the San Francisco
Lumber Preserving Company, detailed
at length the creosoting process.
"You are not there all of the time?"
suggested Attorney Cope.
"Not at night time."
"Who does the work of inspection
when you are away at night?"
"Dan O'Connell."
"The Bohemian poet?"
"Yes, sir.
"That's all."
Governor Budd was next called for
the purpose of impeaching a part of
! the testimony given by D. H. Bibb rel
! ative to Commissioner Colnon. Bibb
j testified some days ago that he met the
Governor at the Palace Hotel and com
plained of the way Colnon was acting
in relation to the lumber selling pat
ronage of the board.
"We waive the administration of the
witness" oath to the Governor," said
Attorney Cope, representing the plain
tiff.
The Governor gracefully acknowl
edged the compliment, but held up his
hand and had the oath administered to
him by Clerk Morris.
Attorney Stratton then proceeded to
question the Governor concerning the
alleged conversation had with him by
Bibb.
Counsel for the Parafflne Paint Com
pany objected on the ground that At
torney Stratton had not laid the proper
foundation fur proceedings looking to
ward the impeachment of Bibb's tes
timony. He had not been questioned as
to the exact time and place of the con
versation and the names of those pres
ent, if anyone was present.
Judge Belcher ruled that the objec
tions were well taken.
"There is no need of bringing the
Governor back again," said Stratton.
"We might take his testimony now, and
I will afterward recall Bibb and ask
him the omitted questions."
"There is no need of being in a hurry
with me," ventured the Governor, "for
GOVERNOR BUDD Was Called for the Purpose of Impeaching
a Part of Bibb's Evidence, but his Testimony Was
Deferred.
I will be here all week and subject to
the order of court."
Governor Bund was then excused, and
Attorney STratton announced that he
would call him again after having first
examined Bibb more definitely as to the
time and place of the alleged conver
sation concerning Commissioner Col
non.
The remainder of the session was oc
cupied in hearing the testimony of At
torney Tirey L. Ford, legal adviser of
the Harbor Commissioners, relative to
the advice he had given concerning the
letting of contracts.

TOMMY RYAN AN
ANGRY FIGHTER
Scores the National Club
for Its "Welshing
Tactics."
An Attempt of That Organiza
tion to Sign Ryan and
Tommy West.
A Prominent Sporting Man's Guaran
tee Refused â Conferences End.
in Naught.
Tommy Ryan is about as angry a
fighter as can be found in the "profes
sion." The reason he assigns for it are
that the National Club refuses to pay
him $530 he claims is still due on his
late contest with George Green, and
yet has asked him to enter the arena
with Tommy "West.
Last evening Messrs. Gibbs and
Groom, a prominent sporting man who
is responsible for Ryan's appearance in
the West and the pugilist had a con
ference to see if an amicable agree
ment in regard to the trouble could
not be reached. The club men stated
that they would like to match Ryan
with Tommy West, and in case Ryan
should acquiesce would give him the
balance due him on the day before the
proposed match. Ryan's friends want
ed the fighter paid thÂ«?n and there, and
agreed that if the club did so he would
give it a written guarantee to forfeit
the sum of $530 in case Ryan failed to
enter the ring with Tommy West
through any fault of his own. This
they refused to do, as well as to give
their note for the balance the boxer
claims on the same conditions. They
asserted their intention to telegraph
West, who- is now in New York, to see
if he would come to this city and meet
Ryan.
Ryan's indignation at what he re
gards as the "welshing tactics" of the
National Club is aired In the following
communication:
To the Editor of The Call-Sir: I think
I have been treated so unjustly by the
National Club of this city as to warrant
me in showing up their methods of work.
In my possession is a telegram from them
Baying: they would guarantee a purse of
14000 if I would come out here and fight
Green. On the strength of that I came.
Later on, this was placed in the articles
of agreementâ l mean that we should get
at If ast $4000. If 60 per, cent of the gate
receipts was more than that we were to
get whatever sum it footed up.
As only about $47(Â»i was taken in, the
club would not pay us but 60 per centâ a
little over $1400 aphce. Such welshing
tactics won't help the sport any, and the
public can bank on it, too.
Now they warit me to enter the ring
with Tommy West and pay me the bal
ance, $530, the day before the fight.
Though a friend of mine offers to guar
antee them in writing $530, I will be there
all right If they will give me what Is mine
now, or even their note. I won't fight un
der any such agreement, and I want peo
ple to know why. Yours respectfully
THOMAS RYAN.
TALKED WITH HIS OFFICERS.
General Booth Gave Words of Ad
vice and Wisdom to His
Officers.
General Booth was busy all yesterday
Riving words of advice and wisdom to his
officers and soldiers. Three times during
the day meetings with them were held,
and the topic was the same at all of them.
During the forenoon and the afternoon
meetings were held In the partlors of the
Central Methodist Church and they were
with the officers only. In the evening a
union meeting of the officers and soldiers
was held. All the gatherings were of an
executive nature, only those of the rank
and file of the army being admitted. The
general particularly admonished his fol
lowers to lead pure, upright and godly
lives and so give living examples of the
principles they taught.
This forenoon another meeting with the
officers will be held and to-night the gen
eral and his staff will leave for Portland
There will be a big following of the army
at the ferry depot to bid him farewell

RESOLUTIONS
FOR LENT
Father Yorke Requests
Three of the Truth
Society.
Lectures Before the Assembled
Members at the
Cathedral.
Says tkxm Period of Lent Is a Time
tor Prayer, Meditation and
Penance.
"Now is the accepted time; now is
the day of salvation."
The expansion of this text for the
Instruction of members of the Catholic
Truth Society was the fundamental
purpose of the lecture delivered by
Fattier Yorke at the Cathedral last
night. With these words he strove to
place before them the doctrine that the
observance of Lent Is a time of pen
ance and primarily is the Feast of the
Resurrection.
f*We live: in the -world; but woe to us
if we belong to the world," said the
preacher. "The world Is one thine, the
church another. When Christ came
upon earth he came not to instruct us
how to gain worldly fameâ he came to
tell us there; was one thing to strive
for/the kingdom of heaven. The doc
trine of enjoying life while we live and
taking our chances of making peace
with God in. the end is a worldly doc
trine we hear advanced to us every
day of our lives and given as an offset
to the principles of our religion.
'Tnless : we have love for God he will
have no love for us. and during this
time of tent we are to imagine our
selves in the. Garden of Gethsemene,
witnesses, to the agony of Christ; we
are to behold the bloody sweat which
.issued from his brow on that night in
the garden; we are to be travelers with
him on his joairney to the Roman court,
and we are to be with him at the
cross. This is the time we should be
gin to know our Master.
'People are worft to make good reso
: . lutibns on the spur of the moment, and
oftentimes when they retire to sleep at
night theiir minds are full of the good
deeds which they, will do on the mor
r"\v. When to-morrow comes and when
they resume the struggle of life amid
the bustling wurld they . forget their
good intentions, and their resolutions
pass from their minds :iike an ephem
eral, dream. . â 
>'2Sow is a good time to do something
In the way -of our salvation, and we
should strive, to do a little at least in
bringing God. nearer to ourselves by
. striving to know a little more about
him. 'Â '; " .â¢:â '.
"The Catholic Truth Society is strict
ly a religious organization, and its
members; derive no benefit unless the
spirit of God governs and presides over
aIL- During the period 'of Lent I would
request . that . three resolutions be
adppted : : . : . .
"iA. resolution' to say the prescribed
prayers of the society night and morn
ing, together with the uhual daily pray
ers; a resolution to study and master
th<? religious, tracts which are published
and distributed from time to time
among its members; and a resolution
to distribute this literature among your
friends, pon-rCathoMC: as well as Cath
olic, that by. chance they might be the
means of being an everlasting benefit
to them." /â 
In speaking of the subject of Lent and
Its various observances Father Yorke
spoke of the exactions of the fast which
are demanded by the church in this
country.. ' In conjunction with the ser
mon the usual devotional services of
the society were observed.
On March 21 and 22 a convention will
be held by the society at Metropolitan
Temple. [ ' '
BLUE HELMETS NOW.
Orders Issued for the Police f o Wear
Their Eastern Headgear.
Orders . were issued from police head
quarters yesterday for the wearing .of the
Eastern-made helmets on the first watch.
: "Why the officers did not wear these hel
mets : before now has 'been one of the
mysteries of the upper office, as they had
been procured from New York last Octo
ber and were worn on the day set apart
*or the general police parade .in that
month.
These are the helmets that caused so
much commotion among the men of the
force from the fact that the contract was
given to an Eastern firm when K. A.
Lundstrojn, a local hatter, at 605 Kearny
street, had offered to supply the depart
ment with an equally: good helmet for
$2.50 when the Eastern headgear costs
. S3: To enable I^undstrom to compete
with the: East he sent to Philadelphia for
the block upon which the helmets are
. made arid sent in his bid, but for some
reason nr> notice was taken of his offer
and. the helmets â¢ wore, sent on an assign
ment to a Market-street store where the
officers were simply told to leave their
sizes without asking any questions.
The subject of patronizing an Eastern
firm in preference to that of a local one
caused somewhat of a discussion in the
board of the Merchants' Association, out
of which grew an exchange of corre-
Bpondence between the two departments
with an understanding that in future local
dealers would h^ve an equal show to com
pete with Eastern firms.
HOG'S BACK STILL STANDS.
Polk-Street Merchants Do Not Like
the Fair Litigation as It Re
tards Progress.
The litigation between the Harbor Com
missioners and the heirs of the Fair
. estate has been very distasteful to the
merchants of Polk street as it has tied
up the contractors who had the job of re
moving the hog's back from the northern
portion of that thoroughfare. The cutting
down of this obstruction and the extend
ing of Polk street to the water's edge
has been the dream of the merchunts of
that street for a number of years. A
realization of this boon was brought about
one year a#o when the Polk-street mer
chants organized an improvement club
and at once set about to have the street
extended. A contract was let and all was
in readiness to prosecute the work when
the legal tangle presented Itself by which
the contractors were enjoined from dumn-
Ing any of the earth removed in the cut
on the disputed territory claimed by the
Harbor Commissioners as belonging to the
â¢ Â»

JAKE RUDOLPH
TRIES A KNIFE
Scene Created in Front of
the Orpheum by Buck
ley's Henchman,
Arrested After a Short Struggle
and Charged With Being
Drunk.
He Contends His Alleged Victim First
Attempted to Assault
Him.
(lere was a lively row in front of
Orpheum Theater last night which
a time threatened to result in
dshed. Smarting under some im
ary wrong "Jake ' Rudolph at
ed two men, one of whom was
imed James Cosponewich, a waiter
in a Market street restaurant. Ru
dolph was under the influence of liquor
tas he proceeded to do up his ad
iries he was placed hors dv com
by a well-directed blow on the
: of the jaw. After regaining his
teet he seized the waiter around the
waist and threw him to the ground.
During the struggle that followed Ru
dolph drew a knife and repeatedly at
tempted to stab his adversary. At
this juncture Police Officer William
Brophy appeared and placed the com
batants under arrest. Rudolph was
booked on a charge of drunkenness and
Gosponewich for battery.
"Bogie" O'Donnell accompanied the
belligerents to the Central Station, and
at his instigation the charge of battery
was pref erred against the waiter. Ac
fig to the statement of "Bogie"
alter and his friend attacked Ru
and to protect himself he drew
nife and vainly endeavored to
one of them.
"It is lucky for them that I was not
present," remarked "Bogle" to Desk
Sergeant Bidwill. "I ain't looking for
trouble, but I would have given ten
! years of my life to have been in the
mix-up. This guy (meaning the pris
j oner) and his friend thought they had
a soft snap when they attacked poor
old Jake, but they were disappointed.
\ Had I been present â well, they would
; have gone to the Morgue."
Rudolph's face was covered with
; blood when he was taken to the City
Prison, the result of coming in con
| tact with his adversaries' lists. Gos
i ponewich intends to swear to a com-
J plaint to-day charging Rudolph with
: an assault with a deadly weapon.
NORTHERN ROADS
HATE WEAKENED
The Three American Lines Re
store Rates From Here
to Portland.
The Difference, However, Is Only
Two Dollars on Second-
Class Traffic.
J. C. Stubbs of the Southern Pacific
Company may not show his fins above
the troubled waters of the railroad
pool, but that he is doing submarine
work of a very efficacious character
was shown by the explosion that took
place yesterday and blew the bottom
out of the local cut rate that the three
Northern American lines have floated
for some days past.
Yesterday the local agents of the O.
R. and N., Northern Pacific and Great
J^orthern received orders from their
central offices to discontinue the sale
of through tickets from this city to
New York and Chicago at the cut rate
schedule.
This order, which on Its face appears
to restore the rates on those lines to
their regular level, as a matter of fact
makes practically no change in the
situation at all.
True, the passengers starting from
here to one of the Eastern points will,
if he wants to avoid the high tariff on
the direct line of the Southern Pacific,
be obliged to pay the regular local
rates from this city to Portland, but
there he can take advantage of cut
rates of $40 and $30 from that point to
his destination.
The difference is $2 on a second-class
through fare, which is now $38, Instead
of $36, as it was before the local rates
were ordered restored, but on first-class
tickets the only difference is the trou
ble the passenger will be put to of buy
ing one ticket here and another at
Portland, instead of completing the
purchase in one transaction, as the lo
cal rate, first-class, from here to Port
land is $12, which, added to the cut
rate there of $40, makes the $52 through
rate that the agents of the three north
ern lines have been forbidden to adver
tise.
Aside from this no new developments
have occurred In the situation, which
remains the same as for the last two or
three days. The Canadian Pacific is
carrying on the fight single-handed
against the three Northern American
roads and threatens a still further
cut of $10 unless the differential is re
stored, while the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe hold aloof in a state of un
certainty and take no actively open
part in the fray.
FEDERAL QUARANTINE.
Dr. Chalmers Has No Bight to Act
as Quarantine Officer in the
Port of San Francisco.
"Dr. Chalmers has no right to put his
! foot on board a vessel for quarantine pur
! poses." said Collector Jackson to a Call
i reporter yesterday. "Some time ago
every commercial organization in the
State of California, including the Board
of Trade, the Chamber of Commerce and
the Board of Health, asked the Federal
Government to assume the duty of quar
antining this port and relieve the State
from the burden of taxation which It
would necessarily impose. The Federal
Government granted the request and
fitted up a quarantine station at an exr
pense of $250,0X1 and is paying all the ex
penses of quarantine. The State volun
tarily abandoned its quarantine powers
and therefore its so-called quarantine of
fice does not legally exist. Other States
are beginning to do the same. For in
stance Texas and Louisiana, are asking
the Federal Government to assume all
the quarantine duty In those States. Dr.
Chalmers has no more right on board a
veaÃel than you have, the State having
formally ceded to the Federal Government
the right to enforce quarantine regula
tions."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 3 % 1898.
NEAR TO INSTANT DEATH
Insoector of Customs Harru Simpson Perhaps Fatallu
Injured,
Harry Simpson, the inspector of cus
toms on the Mail dock, met with an ac
cident yesterday which may result in
his death. He was taken to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, where Drs.
Hill and Zabala did all they could for
him. Later he was taken to his home,
2503 Golden Gate avenue, by his
family physician. Simpson was spitting blood when he left the hospital,
and Dr. Hill thinks he received internal injuries which will result in his
death.
Simpson reached the Mail dock yesterday morning a little before 8
o'clock and was put on duty as one of the guarding force on the steamer
Doric. Cargo was being discharged from the two after hatches and Simpson
was stationed between them to see that the men handling the freight did
not do any smoking. From the. aftermost hatch of all rice was being dis
charged, and as the freight handlers received it from the shoot they took
it into the shed and stacked it against a sliding door, in front of which
Simpson was standing. The pressure from tho rice became too great, the
door gave way and falling outward struck Simpson and knocked him over
board. In his fall he struck the large wooden fender between the ship and
the wharf piles and rolled over into the water. Before losing consciousness
he threw up his arm and grabbing the fender managed to rest his head on
the timbers. The next minute the back wash from a passing steamer threw
both the fender and the injured custom house inspector against the side of
the ship and almost carried him away. Another mil and he would have
been gone, but F. Dineen, one of the men handling the freight, jumped from
the wharf to the fender at the risk of his life and grasping Simpson by his
coat pulled him out of that danger. While being taken to his home Simp
son lost consciousness again. When his friends got to the house with
him Mrs. Simpson had gone to Alameda.
The injured man was a first-class officer and one of the best liked in
spectors on the front. He had been laughing and joking with the other in
spectors before going on duty and was only a few minutes on guard at the
dock when the accident which may end in his death happened.
The inspectors at the Mail dock seemed to be all more or less unfortu
nate yesterday, as two or three of them received minor injuries, and In
spector Dorsey got off with a black eye, a very severe scalp wound and
nearly a fracture of the skull. Several of the inspectors were on their way
to the Mail dock on one of the electric cars when an obstinate horse got in
the way and refused to be persuaded to move off the track. After waiting
for five minutes an old gentleman who was standing alongside of Dorsey
raised his stick and aimed a vicious blow at the animal. In his excite
ment the old gentleman did not make a very good aim and he missed the
horse and Dorsey received the full force of the blow on the side of the
head. It knocked him insensible, and he was not able to receive the profuse
apologies of the old gentleman for several minutes. His wounds were
attended to and he went around the Mail dock all day yesterday with his
head swathed in bandages.
YOUNG MARINO
PLAYS THE VIOLIN
A Local Lad of Nineteen Who
Is More Than a Mere
Prodigy.
Mid-week Theatrical Notesâ "Robin
Hood" Several Times Again
Next Week.
Ptetro Marino, a San Francisco lad of
19, just returned from the conservatory at
Brussels, where he has been studying
the violin under Ysaye, played at the
Sherman-Clay Hall last night, and played
well. In the first piece. Max Bruchs
Scotch Fantasle, the listener took the
player's years into account and reckoned
him a prodigy- nothing more, for, al
though he brought out a fairly strong
tone and executed the brilliant passages
with ready stroke und stop, he showed
little generalship or musiclanly apprecia
tion, and made the fantasie sound much
longer than it really is. But as the con
cert wore on ho proved to be more than
a mere prodigy. _1
In a study for violin alone by Fiorillo
he played with fine bravura, giving a
broad rich sing to the melody and finished
articulation to the arpeggio accompani
ment. And he did even better with two
movements of Grieg's C minor sonataâ
the allegro and (probably) the finale
playing with commendable reserve and a
decent approach to poetic feeling. As the
Grieg music was the best of the pro
gramme, from a purely musical point, de
manding mentality as well as touch and
technique, it was welcomed as a good sign
that young Marino did his best work in it.
In everything except the Wieniawskl
polonaise in D he was handicapped by an
over-loud piano; the piano's cover was
shut down on this piece, which, however,
like the Bruch fantasie, seemed to falsely
emphasize the immaturity of the young
artist. All in all. Marino is to be counted
a clever youngster, with almost any kind
of a future he chooses to carve and a
very comfortable little present. It is to
be "hoped the local critics will not swell
his head by prematurely proclaiming him
a master. He does well enough at 19 to
be one of three or four violinists in San
Francisco who can stand for anything
like serious consideration.

PHELAN ROASTED
BY BRODERICK
The Auditor Objects to
Criticisms on His
Actions.
Says the Mayor Is Plainly
"Barking Up the Wrong
Tree^',
The Chief Executive Accused of
Catering to the " Buckley
Push."
Auditor Broderick was angry to the
boiling point yesterday after he had
read Mayor Phelan's communication
to him regarding the alleged deficit in
the School Department funds. The
Auditor is more a man of law than of
argument, and he straightway sat
him down and dictated to his type
writer a caustic reply. In the com
munication he called attention to
many things that the Mayor had for
gotten or overlooked and defended the
administration of his office in the
strongest terms. His reply to the
Mayor reads as follows:
SAX FRAXCISCO, March 2. IS9B.
Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor City and
County of San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: inur
communication of February 28 is at hand.
In answer thereto I beg leave to say:
Your statement that "It appears from
a recent report as to the condition of the
finances of the city and county that there
will be a pronabU- deficit or shortage of
$100,000 in the School Department fund at
the end of the current fiscal year" is very
stale news to me, and has been generally
known to every one through the medium
of the press. I have been predicting a
greater deficiency for several months and
have been doing all in my power by ad
vice and threats, besides warning the
members of the Board of Education as
to their personal legal liability for their
acts causing the same, hoping thereby to
induce economy and the reduction of ex
penses. As early as September last I
c'immenced to "hold up" demands against
the school fund that were in excess of
proportionate appropriation and then
called the attention of the Superintendent
of Schools, the chairman of the finance
committee and the chairman of the build
ing committee, in my office, to the proba
ble effect of the board's action, and then
advised that if some drastic measures
were not at once adopted some one would
"get hurt" about June next. You are, in
a sporting phrase, "barking up the wrong
tree." The violation of the one-twelfth
act to which you refer exists in the
Superintendent of Schools and the Board
of Education, wherein they formulate.
sign and approve demands In conflict with
its provisions.
Your reference to tha act of 1867 and
the quotation of section 4 of said act is
a great surprise to me. That act is dead,
or, as the legal fraternity designate it,
obsolete, and was superseded twenty
years ago by acts more effective on the
subject matter. The quotation was en
tirely unnecessary as a matter of lnfor
mati'on to me, yet, I thank you just the
same, for I cannot suppose that the labor
bestowed by you in its discovery was
given under any other impulse than that
of the public good.
As the laws now stand the Auditor has
nothing whatever to do with the sub
divisions or segregations of the school
fund that may be made by the Board of
Education. Your quoted dead law called
for the segregation being made In July
of each year, but, according to your let
ter to me, it was not done by the present
board until October last, after the ap
propriation and tax levy were made â It
could not well be done sooner. Had you
discovered this dead law sooner you
might have seen that probably the
board would have been subject to prose
cution and removal from office for this
seeming dereliction. I am surprised that
you missed so favorable an opportunity
for the exercise of your peculiar talent
In that direction.
Your reference as to what Auditor
Strother did in 1885 and your advice there
in Is thankfully received, but of no value
to me. I hope you have not been actuated
by a desire to propitiate the "Buckley
push" by the insinuation conveyed
thereby.
From the publicity given your letter in
this morning's papers, and particularly
the editorial importance given It In one
paper, I am forced to think it quite mani
fest that you are building "political
fences." I think I am safe in saying that
it will at all times during my adminis
tration be found that so far as the Audi
tor's office Is concerned the one-twelfth
act is and has been sincerely respected,
and the strongest efforts have been made
to live up to its provisions. The fact Is,
great numbers of persons think its pro
visions are too closely applied byâ yours,
very respectfully.
WILLIAM BRODERICK.
The Grady Libel Cases Decided.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday rendered a decision in the mat
ter of the libeled steamer H. C. Grady.
The Grady was sold by the United States
Marshal a few weeks ago for $7350 and
the suits against her aggregate about
$7500. The decision dismisses the claims
of J. L. Kercheval and E. J. Loughery.
The other claims are allowed with the
exception of those of Whalen & Whalen
and McMurphy & McEvoy, which are de
clared to be subordinate to that of In
tervenor Strong, whose claim in turn is
subordinate to that of all the other libel
lants.

LOVE THWARTED
BUT UNCHANGED
Why Manager Belasco
and Miss Lewis Are
Still Single.
Stern Parents Place an Em
bargo on the Nuptial
Ceremony.
But the Pretty Theatrical Romance
May Yet End Like a Fairy
Tale.
An irate father and an obdurate
mother stand in the way of the mar
riage of Manager Frederick Belasco of
the Alcazar and the girl of his choice.
The engagement of Mr. Belasco and
Mias Sadie Lewis was published not ,
long ago and attracted the attention of
the bride's parents, who are well
known residents of Suisun. Catching
the first train from that town they
came to this city and called on their
daughter, who was staying at the Ho- j
tel Alexandria. Arguments, prayers ;
and threats could not change the young i
lady's intention of marrying the man !
on whom her heart was set.
In no uncertain terms they ordered
her to obey, but without success. They
left her, the angry father to return to
Suisun and the mother to seek a
friend's house, in the hope that their
daughter would reconsider her re
solve.
Miss Lewis' love for the manager of j
the local play house was too great and ;
she visited him and explained her j
parents' opposition, saying that she in- '
tended to ignore their wishes and
wanted the wedding to be held at an
early date. Last Friday was set for j
the ceremony and a Justice of the j
Peace was invited to be at the thea- j
ter to join the pair in the bonds of i
matrimony.
By some means the mother heard of
the intended nuptials, and paid another ]
visit to her obstinate daughter. More j
tears were shed, but Miss Lewis could j
not be deterred.
But the constant lecturing had its ef
fect on her, and when she reached the
theater she was in a hysterical condi
tion and unable to take part in the cer
emony. The Justice was given his fee,
and told he would be notified when
Miss Lewis could proceed. Up to this
time he has received no word, and bath
parties are still single.
Mr. Lewis called on his daughter a
day or two ago and succeeded in get
ting her to go to her home in Suisun.
Manager Belasco left for Los Angeles
on Monday and is expected to return
within a week, when the nuptials are to
be celebrated.
Miss Lewis is a member of the Alca
zar company, playing under the name
of Juliette Crosby. She studied under
Mr. Belasco's direction, and while act-
Ing as his pupil a natural liking gave
way to love.

California's Proposed Ex
position Growing in
Popular Favor.
Not the Slightest Opposition Has
as Yet Developed Against the
Magnificent Project.
EXPOSITION WILL BE A PERFECT ONE.
JULIUS KAHN â I was secretary of the finance committee of the
California Midwinter Fair, and I think on that account I am competent
to- speak advisedly on the subject of holding an exposition to celebrate
the semi-centennial anniversary of California's admission to Statehood.
I know positively that the Midwinter Fair proved of incalculable bene
fit to the laboring man, and I am strongly in favor of any movement
that will tend to improve his condition in life. I believe that the man
who earns hi.s bread by the sweat of his brow is entitled to and deserv
ing: of every consideration, and the giving of an exposition is one of the
best methods- whereby the interests of the laboring man canbeadvanced.
The last fair pave employment to great numbers of people, who, in the
face of- the stringent conditions of affairs at that period and the depres
. Â«ion thereto, would have found it absolutely Impossible to- obtain work.
They r.eceiyetl temporary benefit then, and the proposed exposition will
help many a man to tide over difficulties which may beset him.
The railroads demonstrated their willingness and ability to handle
large crowds, of visitors to the Christian Endeavor Convention last sum
mer, and 40.000 enthusiastic beholders of our glorious climate and abun
dant resources was the result, and some of these have become perma
nent settlers here.
The exposition proposed by The Call will, I am sure, bring hun
dreds of thousands of people to our coast, many of whom will likewise
locare in this State, and, aside from the benefits that will accrue to
thr laboriiig man, of whom I am a stanch friend, there will be other ad
vantages "which cannot be too highly estimated.
a knowledge born of experience, we could present an exposi
tion perfect in every detail and stupendous in results.
Stranger and stronger grows the
:rend of public opinion in favor of Cal
ifornia's proposed semi-centennial ex
position, an-d it is certain that the
movement wll result in success of a
surpassing kind. : If any man has a
vestige, of opposition in his heart
against the proposition he is discreet
ly silent and conceals it most carefully,
â 1 it is only a question of time when
â¢ will be found, in the procession of
supporters, and be as loud

joined the ranks during the first

It is a little- early as. yet to make a

As soon as positive and substantial
S are received from all the

f this city will be in a better position
ahead and make all preliminary
plans for the exhibition.
Mayor Ph^lan has not as yet made

doing so, aa he desired to. choose only

â  The .defense in the Figel case
was- finished yesterday morning, and
" : witnesses ; for the prosecution were
called in rebuttal by Judge Murphy.
' The first -witness for the defense
â¢â¢'was J. W, Willey, who testified that he
had been a deputy County Clerk in Stock
ton since 1878/ and during that time no
-man' named Hoffman had been in ' the
-â¢â  clothing business in that city. Just what
.was expected to be- proved by the testi
â¢. mony was rather vague.
' Sigmund Stencil, a neighbor of Isaac
Hoffman" during the month of May prior
to' the' shooting, was called to testify con
cerning a quarrel he had overheard be

to hold an exposition the association I
represent will be only too glad to add
California to its firm name for the pur

hibitors and visitors and offering induce
ments to bring visitors from the East
here as well as taking them to Paris.
This association is also organized to be

grades of California wine and preserve!

know of your city I believe such an ex
position would be a grand success for

country can produce. As I intend to stay
here I would be willing: to commence
making a canvass among the business
men of the city. I am. yours truly
CHARLES F. BAILEY,
544 Sutter street.
ALL SHOULD LEND
THkIR BEST AID.
Concentrated Action Desirable
on the Project of Molding an
Exposition.
Sheriff Richard I. Whelan: "Any one
who opposes the exposition proposed
by The Call is opposed to the best in
terests of this State, and I must say
that I have not met with any one who
is not heartily in favor of the propo
sition, and I have talked with a num
ber of people on the subject. It is im
material whether the exhibition be
held in 1900 or 1901, though probably
the latter year will meet with many
ardent supporters owing to the Paris
Exposition of 1900. That point, how
ever, should be of secondary consid
eration. The main idea on which we
should all concentrate our best efforts
is to give the exposition, and it will be
an easy matter to decide when it
should be driven in order that it may
be assured of undisturbed and unin-
terrupted success.
"I look upon expositions as the best
means of attracting visitors to our
State, and I firmly believe that the
proposed semi-centennial exposition
will cause more people to come here
than ever before in the history of such
affairs, and there is no reason why it
should not surpass all former efforts.
"I would wish to be a zealous sup
porter and earnest worker in the good
cause, for I fully realize the great
benefits that will result from it, and
so does every fair-minded and pub
lic-spirited citizen."
General Barnes, backed up by numerous
authorities, was sustained by the court
and the witness was excused.
At this point General Barnes called
Max Gumpel, a hand-writing expert, to
the stand. When the witness was shown
the much-talked of receipt for $9500 he
pronounced it genuine. Mrs. Hoffman,
who was called by the prosecution, tes
tified that all differences between her
self, Isaac Hoffman and her mother, Mrs.
Alexander, had been amicably settled
prior to the evening of June 1. The ques
tion was then asked, "Did you ever see
your husband carry a pistol?" but an ob
jection by the defense started an argu
SHE FREQUENTLY SWALLOWS PINS.
A Btrange and mysterious case that will probably cause consid
erable commotion among physicians of this city came to the atten
tion of Dr. Dudley, resident physician of the City and County Hos
pital, yesterday.
A lady came to his office and stated that a pin had lodged in her
throat and she wished that he would do something for her, as it was
causing her a slight inconvenience.
The doctor examined her throat and finding that he could not see
the pin so as to take it out he pushed it down and told the lady to go
home and eat a quantity of bread.
It was then she made a startling statement to the physician. She
told him that it was a habit of hers to swallow pins and sometimes
she swallowed two or three at a time without ill effect.
"Once before," she said, "I had another such accident as this and
a doctor in San Jose treated me.
"I am a dressmaker and hold tthe pins in my mouth and very often
I forget myself and swallow them. They never pain me and I never
know the difference. It is rather provoking, though, to have the pins
lodge in one's throat. They never scare me, however, even if they do."
Dr. Dudley was uncertain whether or not his patient would be in
jured by her strange diet.
"I did all for the lady that I could," he said, "and all I can do is
to wait for further developments. She will have to eat a lot of bread,
and this may help her some."
When the lady was asked her name she refused to give it and
simply stated that she was a dressmaker. She was neatly dressed and
was both young and pretty. She promised to call and see the doctor
again if she felt any bad result froom her accident, but protested that
she expected none.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 1898.
FROM SOCIETY TO STAGE.
MISS LILLIA OWENS ELLIS.
San Francisco is soon to be represented on the New York stage by another
of her talented daughters chosen from the southern circle that composes this
city's most exclusive set. Though the young lady in question is a daughter by
adoption and not by birth, 'yet her early life, her education and associations
have all been so long and intimately connected with this place that she may
be considered as one of San Francisco's own girls and one of whom she may
be justly proud. .
Her name is Lillia Owen Ellis, and her mother is Mr?=. LilliA Ellis, of the
New Orleans family of that name, whose readings and rendition ot negro dia
lect are still remembered by the smart set as one of the most delightful remin
iscences of last year's season.
Miss Ellis was 'born in New Orleans, where her father. \\ llliam H. Ell.s,
was one of the leading business men and an officer of the famous Washing
ton Artillery Company. Her ;*ther died while she was yet a mere child and
her mother, brother and herself came to San Francisco, which, was hencefor
ward their home. She was educated at Miss Lake's school, where she evinced
early evidences of remarkaM,- dramatic ability. After ht-r graduation from
that institution she gave several readings in private houses of this city and
such was the talent she displayed that her mother took her East where she
went through a three years' course In the New York School of Acting.
Though many offers were made her she refused them all until a few days
ago when Mr and Mrs. Le Moyne made her a proposition to join the company
they are organizing, which was too flattering to be pa.Â«.st <l by.
ment, which consumed the remaining mo
ments of the morning session.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Mrs. Hoffman, was recalled to the stand
and allowed to testify that she had never
Ff.m her husband carry a pistol, and that
the relations existing between hersolf and
husband were affectionate and that they
had lived happy without any trouble
whatever for thirty days prior to the
death of her husband.
Mr. Dreyfus testified that he had been
employed by the nrm of Hoffman. Roth
child '& Co., and that he had not seen
Isaac Hoffman carry a revolver. . The
same testimony was given by Charles
Hoffman.
John Lauer, a drayman, was called to
the stand to testify that he was of the
opinion that Isaac Hoffman was to meet
Figel on the evening of June 1. The de
fense objected, followed by a rather
lengthy argument. The point in Question
was taken under advisement by the court,
and a decision as to whether or not the
testimony shall be admitted will be given
to-day. Mr. Schutte was then called and
testified that he had often been sent to
the office of Isaac Hoffman, and went to
the desk and through the drawers on
various occasions and that he had never
seen a pistnl in the drawer. Mr. Harris
testified that he had not seen Mr. Huff
man carry a pistol during the ten days
prior to his death. Judge Murphy then
stated that the prosecution would rest
the case, but would reserve the right to
call Mr. Lauer after the decision had
been given in regard to the admission of
his testimony. The arguments in the case
will be heard to-d&y.
F. L. Turpin Sued.
F. L. Turpin, a member of the last
Grand Jury and well known in politics of
thiÃ city, has been sued by J. P. Rudd for
$5000 damages for personal injuries re
ceived, it is alleged, at the hands of the
defendant on the 18th ult. Turpin is the
proprietor of a lodging-house at 12ti Ellis
street and Rudd was one of his roomers.
On the date mentioned Rudd claims that
without provocation Turpin battered and
tossed him down a flight of stairs, and in
consequence he sues for damages ior the
Injuries he received on that occasion.
Was Bun Over by a Car.
Thomas D. Condon has commenced suit
against the Geary-street Railway Company
to recover $10,000 damages for personal in
juries received on March 2. IS9G. Condon
was run over by a car at Geary strett and
Grant avenue, and suffered the loss of his
left leg. Ho avers the action was caused
by the defendant's carelessness and sues
for damages on that contention.
Alaska Committee Transfer.
The formal transfer of the Alaska
trade committee to the State Board of
Trade, which was to have taken place
yesterday, was postponed until to-day on
account of President Sherwood, of the
former committee, not being empowered
to act for his committee.
News for the Wheelmen.
The League of American Wheelmen numbers
nearly 2000 below the 100,000 mark within the
last few wÂ«<-kt=. In Bplte of this startling
diminution, the maximum of health may be
attained by thns.- who us*" the comforting and
thorough- tonic, Hostetter'B Stoma.-h Bitters,
which promotes digestion, a healthy flow of

kidney trouble. It is. n n >ver, a remedy for

CHOKED BY A
PIECE OF MEAT
Roast Beef Stuck Fast in the
â  Larynx of Joseph Mc-
Donald.
Ho Fell to tho Floor and Died With
out Being Able to Call for
Assistance.
Autopsy Surgeon Gallagher made a sur
prising discovery yesterday morning
while performing an autopsy on the body
of Joseph McDonald, who died suddenly
on the evening before at the German
Hotel at 560 Howard street.
McDonald was a ship carpenter,
healthy and robust. He was eating din
ner in the hotel dining-room last Tuesday
evening, and was seen to leave the table
suddenly and walk into another room,
where he fell to the floor unconscious,
and died before any assistance could be
rendered him. It was supposed at the
time that death had been caused by heart
disease or apoplexy, but the. autopsy
disclosed the fact that the man had been
suffocated while trying to swallow an un
chewed slab â¢of roast beef about four
inches long and two Inches wide. The
piece of meat lodged in the larynx of the
reckless man, thus preventing him from
making, any outcry or from.even breath

The deceased was a native of Nova

"L THE LUMBER TRADE.
â¢ Pacific Coast Wood arid Iron says of lum
ber: "The lumber : trade ; for February was
very dull. and receipts as well. as sales were
small. The ; uncertain condition of : affairs
causes this dullness, and . the end is not in
Bight. The fear of a war with Spain, Jhe lack
of rain and the. fear of a. failure of crops has
caused a depression all over the State, and
building has almost ceased:. . Dealers are
"afraid to purchase- and are selling off their
stocks already on hand. . 'Vessels are scarce
and will remain â¢so . for some time to come.
Considerable pine Is going to Alaska, where
good prices are obtained. Another month will
undoubtedly -show- a change." .

Isobars, or solid lilies, connect points of equal
air .pressure: isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and la usur.lly accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by ck>uÂ«iy weather and rains, "Lows" usually
flrer appear on the 'Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In the interior and low
alons the. coast, and the isobars extend north
and along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low 1 ' Is Inclosed with isobars of
niarked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable.. With a "high'" In the vicinity of
Idahb. and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. Ths
reverse of these, conditions- will produce an
opposite result. :

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
â  NEW YORK. March 2.â The net result of to
day's, trading in' stocks is the principal wiping
out;of yesterday's gains In prices. This was
, Bone on a diminished volume of business. The
! - decline was not' accompanied by any develop
... ment of general conditions which could account
â¢ for it and there- was no reflection of any news
â¢" of' the day; in the movement, unless In the
â  eltghtly Increased â  selling movement In the
. . final hour. This was started on rumors attach
ing- Importance to the sending of two warships
to "Cuban waters with provisions for the re
concentra'dos. But to-day's decline fcr the most
part was- technical and marked the culmination
â '.' if the. recovery from last week's sharp fall. A
â  Bh'ort' rally invariably follows a heavy decline
and the professional traders were vigilantly
alert for its ending this morning. Dealings In
. the first hour were large and the movement of
prices very narrow. The commission-house
" .buying Invited by yesterday's â¢ strong market
was sufficient to absorb realizing offers for a
time, but the market became overweighted and
commenced to sag. A period of Intense dull
ness Intervened and then the bears opened an
attack on a number of the specialties, notably
sugar, Manhattan, People's Gas and Metropoli
. .tan Street Hallway. The Grangers were also
under pressure and New York Central was
'.heavily sold. Most of the day's business was
â¢done in -the local stocks and all suffered
. .-â¢ marked net losses running from 1 to 3 points.
The movement in Metropolitan was very er
ratic, the opening transactions carrying it to
l.'.C, the high point of the day. London was
both". buyer and seller here, but the sales pre
dominated, â¢ although the tone of American se
curities on foreign exchanges was rather bet
â¢ ter and -Spanish bonds were also higher.- The
money market continued firm . to-day without
â  any very active pressure to borrow. There was
a good supply, however, of commercial paper
and the"rates were fractionally higher. â  There
was a payment of $1,000,000 to the Government
. to-day on account of the Kansas Pacific sale,
â bo that the Sub-Treasury had a balance at the
Clearing-house of J515.725. This had its effect
" on .the money market and took the place of
the regular weekly withdrawal of an install-,
ment of Government deposits on account of the
Union Pacific sal-, -which has been discontin
ued for the "present. Sterling exchange hard-
. ened an additional fraction in response to the
â¢â  firmer tone of the London market.
.The- tendency of the bond market was toward
weakness, in sympathy with stocks. Sales

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Mar. 2.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegran Bays: The stock
markets here were of a better tone to-day, but
painfully inactive. Americans and Grand
Trunk opened better, but relapsed later. New
York absorbed the stocks offered unwillingly,
and business here was almost at a standstill.
Prices closed better.
Signs are evident again In both Americans
and Kafflrs that the recent weakness at the
settlement has not been cleared off. Reports
that the Bank of England Is to pay the divl- '
dends here on certain big American railroads
are believed to be correct.
Kaffirs were flat, partly on forced sales and
also on rumors that President Kruger is about
to place a further tax on mining profits.
Gold was In less demand at 77s 9%6.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. March Wheat was clearly a
bull market at the opening. The strength
which marked yesterday's close made traders
more. apprehensive than ever of the short side
and the. firmness caused by small offerings
was increased by the nature of the. news which
as a whole was of an encouraging character.
Opening quotations for July were unchanged
to â¢â¢ic higher than yesterday's close at 91V4Â®
91%0, and by 11:30 o'clock It was up to 91%@
91% c. There was an extremely limited trade
done in May. but that option exhibited even
more strength than the later delivery, every
thing offered being taken by the Letter Inter
ests. This support of May and the fact that
Lelter buying of March was also prominent
exerted no small. influence on July shorts. Liv
erpool was firm and showed good advances.
Outside markets showed strength, particularly
New York, which market reported the bent
buying in some time. Fresh advices from
Argentine . Bald damaging rains continued.
Alter noon, however, the market gradually
eased ' off .-' Shorts â¢ had apparently got pretty
well filled up and realizing on the advance be
came pretty free. July finally got down to 91c,'
where it closed. May, however, â  continued'
strong. About noon It reached $1 07. I Realizing
which followed caused a reaction to $1 06%, but
during the last minutes of the session May
was caught up in another â  Lelter swirl | and
carried- up to $1 07. " The closing price was
$106%, the highest closing price this season.'
Lelter was credited with some July dealing.
The market for corn was rather strong early,
but free selling to , realize caused â¢ a gradual
weakening of prices. May closed '4@%c lower
Trading In oats was principally of a scalp
ing nature. May closed Wor'Vic 1 lower.
Provisions were dull. Market closed steady,
with May pork 2'4c higher; May lard un
changed and May ribs 2V4c lower. 1

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
I>STON. March 2.â The American Wool and
on Reporter will say to-morrow of the
I market: A continued demand for bright
Is has been the only feature of the market
the past week. The Inquiry for the grade
been delayed about a month this year. As
lie the manufacturers begin to buy bright
1b shortly after they have taken account of
stock the first of the year. Apart from this
the market has been as featureless ajf at any
time in its history. It is a period of waiting
Klie part of everybody, as much so with the
dealer as the manufacturer. The latter
all the wool he needs at present. It lfl
ved that the wnr scare has not been with-
QUlte a pronounced effect upon the wool
<et. The wool traders are still believers
Igher prices and so are the wool-growers.
Northern wools have been quiet. The sales
for the week amount to 1,880,000 pounds do
mestic and 413,000 pounds foreign, making a
total of 2.293,000, against a total of 8.090,000 for
the previous week and a total of 4,401,000 for
the corresponding week last year.

known In the history of the copper trad*.
Much of the metal now being exported is used
for the manufacture of ammunition for Euro

INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORT IN
CALIFORNIA.
The only sport with pretensions to
university distinction is furnished by
the University of California at Berke
ley, near Oakland, which is across the
bay from San Francisco, and by Le
land Stanford Jr. University at Palo
Alto, about an hour's ride by rail from
San Francisco. I particularize loca
tions merely to show how near they
are to one another and to the center of
all California life â San Francisco. At
both of these institutions there has
been within three years a very ma
terial progression In the science of
athletics and the permanent establish
ment of a proper ethical standard.
Truth to tell, however â although the
development of playing skill has re
sulted from undergraduate enthusiasm
and diligent practice â the cleanliness
of the sport is in a ve*y large measure
due to the unrelaxing vigilance arid
unremitting exhortation of the faculty
athletic committees â or, to be literally
correct, to one or two sportsmaniy
members of those committees. It is
quite true that there still lurks among
the undergraduates a sentiment bent
on winning by fair means or by foul,
which on occasion finds expression,
through baseball and football man
agers, in the playing of some man who
in the spirit of the amateur law is mr
eligible.
The letter of the law Is seldom
broken nowadays, but every once in a
while the faculty committee is hood
winked by a manager more artful than
sportsmaniy, and men are found at
Berkeley or Stanford for athletic pur
poses only. Such a case, for instance,
was that of Searight at Stanford last
football season, and another such
seems to be Sheehy at Berkeley this
season.
The deflections from wholesomeness
would occur less frequently if an inter
est less passive in the effort making for
healthful sport was evinced by the fac
ulties generally at Berkeley and Stan
ford, and even especially by all the
members of the faculty athletic com
mittees. It is the rule the world over
that the real work of any movement,
particularly if it be a new one, comes
from a very few of its many sponsors.
And the athletic reform movement at
these two universities of California re
veals no exception. A very few men at
these institutions are responsible for
the splendid results, and of these few
the names most closely Identified with
the missionary work are those of Pro
fessors Frank Angell, E. B. Clapp, and
Bacon. The combined efforts of these
gentlemen, subscribed to by their re
spective faculties, have been the means
of raising a very satisfactory eth'.cal
standing, and of .making some praise
worthy rules to assure its maintenance.
Of these none is so satisfying as that
requiring a certain class room excel
lence of all candidates for any of the
teams. I find, too, that this Is enforced
more strictly at Stanford than at
Berkeley, by which I Judge the various
professors at Berkeley are not so hear
tily in sympathy with healthful ath-.
letics as their confreres? at Palo Alto.
A less healthful studont spirit at |
Berkeley as a natural result of this
faculty indifference should not be sur
prising.âHarper's Weekly.
The surface of the sea is estimated
at 150,000,000 square miles, talcing the
whole surface of the globe at 197,000,000,
and its greatest depth supposedly
equals the height of the highest moun
tain, or say, four miles. The Pacific
Ocean covers 78.000,000 square miles th<*
Atlantic 25,000.000, the Mediterranean
1,000,000.
Grecian women had longer feet than
the average man has now.

OUT HIS CONTRACT
The Oakland Councilman Declares His Deter
mination to Deliver the People Over to
the Water Companies.
â¢THIS AFFAIR WILL SOON BLOW
; OVER."
Councilman E. TV. Woodward
of Oakland, the pliant tool of the
water companies, positively re
fuses to reform. It can hardly
be said that he glories in the un
enviable notoriety he has earned
during the past ten days, but the
good as well as bad opinion of
his fellow citizens is as naught
compared with his loyalty to the
allied, corporations.
Councilman Woodward is not
the man one would have expected
Mayor Thomas to appoint to a
position in the Council. He is
shallow, and during the quarter
of a century he has resided in the
ci:y across the bay several epi
sodes that have come to light dur
ing his business career would nat
urally cause one to hesitate be
fore, placing him in a position of
trust.
But it must not be inferred that
Woodward has always been un
popular! Prior to his debut as a
Councilman he had many warm
friends in the community. Al
though lacking in force, he pos
sesses the faculty of winning a
man's good will and retaining it.
Moreover, he has always had the
backing of the Grand Armyâ a
powerful element, particularly in
Oakland â and %vhen he announced
himself as an applicant for ap
pointment as Pension Agent, he
obtained indorsements that ena
bled him to forward one of the
strongest petitions that was ever
sent to Washington by a Federal
office-seeker from this State.
And Mr. Woodward hopes and
expects to retain these friends; he
confidently asserts that although
the people have turned against
him for the time being, this af
fair of extortionate water rates
will soon blow over, and those
who have befriended him in the
past will continue to stand by him.
That he has no idea of the grav
ity of his position is evident from
the manner in which he discusses
the matter. He seems to think
that this surrender of the peo
ple's interests Will be forgotten as
soon; as some of his private tran
sactions, that as yet are known
tn but comparatively few of his
fellow townsmen.
Woodward would like to retain
the good will of the people, but
having taken his stand he is de
termined to retain that position,
let come what may. From his
manner it would appear that he
would be glad to be well out of
the trouble, but fears to take the*
only honorable and proper course
for fear it will be construed as an
admission of wrongdoing, while by
holding out he hopes in time to
convince his censors that he only
did what he believed to be right.
For the purpose of ascertaining
definitely whether the people could
hope for a reversal of his vote on
the water-rate ordinance when it
comes up for final passage next
Monday night, a representative of
The Call had a prolonged inter
view with Mr. Woodward yester
day, and at its conclusion the re
porter was forced to the opinion
that the Councilman will carry
out his contract to the letter.
â¢'Mr. Woodward, the people of
Oakland still have hopes that you
will reconsider your vote on the
water-rate order, and when it
comes up for final passage you

Petty Depredations by Bold Youths
of the University Town.
BERKELEY, March 2.â A number of ;
email boys of. Berkeley are making things j
lively for the local peace officers. Yes- ,
terday afternoon two youtns, Alfred and |
Clarence Wilson, aged 12 and 13 years |
respectively, were taken to the County i
Jail at Oakland by Deputy Marshal Raw- i
Fun and were charged with having broken
into the West Berkeley Postofflce and
stolen a <|i:uhtity of pennies and candy
belonging to Miss C. Teague, the Post
mistress. â  â¢
To-day warrants were issued for the ar
rest of two more West Berkeley lads

A BOND ELECTION CALLED.
Berkeleyans to Vote on the Question I
of a New High School.
BERKELEY. March ?.-The Board of!
of Berkeley last night decided j
to cell an election on the Question of j
bonding the town for $00,000 for the erec
tion of a new' High School building. The
election will; be held on Saturday, March
28, between 8 a. m. and sunset." W. H.

CITIZENS."
will be found on their side. Is
there any ground for this hope?"
"I believe that my course so far
has been for the best interests of
the people. The proposed rates are
much less than those of 1894, and
I think that capital should be
given a fair return on its invest
ment.
"In 1894 there was no competi
tion, and consequently there can
be no Justice in comparing the
rates that prevailed then and the
present rates."
"Don't you think that if the
companies charged what they
are allowed to under the pres
ent rate they would derive am
ple revenue on their investment?
They have cut the legal rates any
where from 25 to 300 per cent vol
untarily, as shown by the notices
they have sent out to consumers
stating what the charges will be
from the first of the present
month."
"Well, we can give the new rates
a trial for a year and cut them
down then if the companies are
making too much money."
"Would it not be better to let the
companies collect the full amounts
under the present rates for a year
and then allow them an increase
if they are losing money?"
"I can't see it that way. I be
lieve in encouraging capital, for by
so doing you help the people gen
erally."
"Do you mean to say that the
people will benefit by increasing
the water rates?"
"Yes. in a measure." But Mr.
Woodward would not undertake
to explain how this phenomenon
could be brought about.
"But surely, Mr. Woodward, you
must be convinced, from the dem
onstrations at the last two ses
sions of the Council, that the citi
zens of Oakland do not share this
view. Are you satisfied to sacri
fice the good opinion of the people
in this manner?"
"Yes, as long as I feel that I am
in the right."
"But it is the universal belief
that you are in the wrong, and that
your violation of the pledges you
made when you were appointed is
due to a money consideration; you
know that is the common talk."
"Yes, I know I am called a bood
ler and all that, but I swear I have
never received nor expect to re
ceive one cent for my vote on this
or any other matter. I have not
been approached in any manner by
any representative of the water
companies or anybody else, nor
have I even conferred with the
other members of the Council."
"But you cannot expect the pub
lic to believe that unless you prove
your honesty of purpose by ac
ceding to the unanimous demand
for the defeat of the pending or
der!"
"Maybe I can't; but I repeat that
I have not and do not expect to re
ceive one cent for my vote on this
question."
"If that is true, it is only the
more reason why you should
change your vote next Monday
night. By so doing you would be
doing the water companies no in
justice, and you would prove to the
people your assertions of honesty
of purpose."
"1 have made up my mind that I
bear Interest at the rate of 5 per cent per
annum, and will run twenty years, one
twentieth to mature at the end of each |
year.

am pursuing the right course, and
my conscience will not allow me
to change."
"And you are willing to sacrifice
the good will of your former
friends?"
"Oh, I don't know about that.
The people are pretty warm just
now, but this affair will soon blow
over."
"Do you expect the people will
forget this betrayal of their inter
ests?"
"I don't consider it a betrayal of
their interests, as I told you be
fore. In fact, some of the most
prominent business men in town
â merchants and others who are
large property owners and employ
many men â have come to me and
assured me of their approval of
my position in this matter."
"Who are they? Will you give
me the name of one man not tied
up to either water company in
some manner, who has indorsed
your position?"
"No. That would be a violation
of confidence. I could not men
tion any names."
"Mr. Woodward, you are an as
pirant for the position of Pension
Agent in this district and havo
received the indorsement of mcMiy
prominent people; how can you
expect to retain their support if
you persist in this course?"
"My friends will stand by me to
the end. Only two of those who
signed my petition have with
drawn owing to this affair."
"But don't you think mo3t of
the signers are waiting to see
what you will do next Monday
night, and if then you vote as you
have heretofore, they will all de
sert you?"
"I have no fear of that."
"And your friends in the Grand
Army! Are you willing to relin
quish your old comrades' friend
ship and good will?"
"It is not true that the Grand
Army men have turned against
me; they are all my friends. That
statement that they have gone
back on me is false."
"What does your family say to
this action on your part? Are
you willing to have the odium of
these charges of corruption rest
upon your children? Surely you
ought to have some consideration
for your grown-up sons and
daughters. You know these
charges have been made against
you and your family must also
suffer."
"My wife fully upholds the posi
tion I have taken. She believes I
am honest."
"And you will do nothing to
clear yourself of these charges?"
"I shall do as I have done."
"Mr. Woodward, the opportun
ity is still open to you to become
the most popular man in Oakland.
It rests in your power to defeat
this water order and by so doing
you can have almost anything in
the gift of the people, while by
standing in with the corporations
you must see that you will ruin
yourself politically and in a busi
ness way, in Oakland at least;
are you still determined to sup
port this order?"
"I see no reason why I should
change my vote. I believe lam
right, and I shall do my duty."
This is the man who holds the key
to the water situation in Oakland.

Citizens' Committee in a Quandary
What to Recommend in the Case.
ALAMEDA, March 2.â The citizens'
committee on the overcrowded condition
of the public schools held a meeting last
evening and discussed the various propo
sitions for relief, but did not come to any
definite conclusion as to what recom
mendation they should make. There is
no hope of the Board of City Trustees
making an appropriation for enlarging
the present schools or building additions
to them, and the only way to put up a
new building would be by the issuance of
bonds.
The Public Library.
ALAMEDA, March 2.â At the meeting
of the Board of Library Trustee* last
evening the fact was shown by the li
brarian's report that the institution
never had been so well patronized as dur
ing the past month. The average attend
ance and the number of books taken out
is the largest in the history of the insti
tution. The librarian stated that the
attendance on Sunday was so small that
he thought two hours instead of four
would be sufficient to keep the place open.
A careful record will be kept of the at
tendance, and the change may be made.

The Alameda County Gran A Jury be
gan '.ts promised investigation to-day
into the water ecandal. Th<; council
men who are not of the Solid Six, the
Mayor, City Attorney Dow, City Clerk
Tempkins and Secretary Harry Thom
as o-f the Board of Public Works were
on band, and spent some hours in the
corridors. Several of them were before
the inquisitors, but the day was spent
in finding out how the Council had prc
ee*dtd to fix rates and what testimony
; they had taken. President Pringle
1 who attended all the meetings of the
! Fire and Water Committee, was the
first witness, and he was in the room
nearly an hour.
The jurors were particularly anxious
to know from the Mayor, who had rec
ommended Woodward for the vacancy
1 caused by Fibush's resignation- The
I Mayor said that he had not received
any recommendation, but had appo-int
â  ed him because he thought he was a
good man for the office. The Mayor
also said that the resignation of Mr.
Fibush was a complete surprise to him,
, as he had not anticipated any such ac
tion.
City Attorney Dow's presence gave
i rise to the belief that not only were
' water rates under discussion, but that
the other numerous stories of bribery
that have hung over the City Hall for
the past six months were also under
investigation. Mr. Dow is supposed to
: be in possession of a secret regarding
the recent appointment of the police
officers that will be very interesting.
Councilmen Upton, Howe, Cuvellier,
i Pringle and Glrard were on hand, but
all could not be heard in one day.
They spent hours discussing matters
in the hall, but not more than one
half the witnesses ustified. The pres
ence of Harry Thomas lent color to the
rumor that the Grand Jury intends to
take up more than the water rate busi
ness, for Harry can know but little of
! that, although it is probably presumed
: that he may be possessed of other in
formation.
The Grand Jury will meet again to
morrow afternoon and the Solid Six
may get a chance later to explain their
votes.
The water rate question is being
brought very prominently before the
people this week, and in a manner that
appeals very forcibly to them. This is
the first week in which the companies
are collecting the full rates allowed
them under the existing ordinance, and
people are more than ever impressed
with the fact that the existing ordi
nance will provide ample income for
the companies. The cutting has been
so deep while the competition lasted
that in many instances not more than
one-fourth the legal rates were
charged, and in very few did the
charge amount to one-half. Yet even
with these cut rates the two companies
last year did fairly well and had they
collected all that the law allowed they
would have had a surplus.
It is this proof of the sufficiency of
the income allowed under the existing
ordinance that is increasing the fndig
nation among the rate payers and
which is spurring them on to see if
something cannot be done to prevent
the job that is now almost legalized.
It is being realized as each water rate
payer visits the company's office that
the ordinance prepared by the commit
tee is more than generous, and as this
fact becomes more plain the enormity
of the proposed steal stands out more
clearly.
The Idea is now dawning upon Oak
land that the positive stand taken by
the water companies is for no other
purpose than to crowd out competition,
and the high rates aro wanted not so
much for the income they will bring as
fcr the possibility that such an income
will create. This possibility is the en
hanced value that the stock of the com
panies will at once gain and the fur
ther opportunity of unloading the stock
upon soroo Investors not familiar with
local conditions.
When Mr. Dingee was before the
committee he could rot pay anything
about the value of the plant, but he
\ did know that there arc out three mill
ions in stock and one million in bonds.
He stated. that none of this is on the
market, and consequently has no mar
ket quotation, and he also said it was
J held mostly by himself and Mr. Hay
ward.. Should this stock be unloaded,
no interest could possibly be paid on it.
and after a time the two. plants would
I be merged, and Oakland will have only
the old Contra Costa Company. â

Rumors of Separation Have
â â¢ ' Not a Particle of Foun

The Irish Patriot's Wife Living in
Oakland for the Children's
Benefit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 2.
Mrs. Michael Davitt, wife of the
prominent member of Parliament from
Ireland, emphatically denies the ru
mored statements that she and her hus
band contemplate a legal separation.
Mrs. Davitt has been residing here
for a year, because it was thought best
for the three children in the family,
who are with their mother at the home
of Mrs. Canning, Mrs. Davltt's aunt.
Hon. Michael Davitt brought his fam
ily to Oakland about a year ago, and
after a stay of two weeks returned to
London. Mrs. Davitt is an Oakland
girl, and when she came here it was
given out that she was to stay in Cal
ffornia at least two years.
"The rumor is as false as it 1b ridicu
lous." said Mrs. Davitt this morning.
"I cannot understand how such a story
was started. It is absolutely without
foundation, as my married life has been
very, very happy. I feel that the cruel
rumors have been started maliciously,
for certainly there is nothing to give
rise to them.
"My husband brought me here on ac
count of my health, which has not
been good since my little girl died. He
came all the way here with me and
the children, as he did not want us to
I make the Journey alone. I was to stay
: two years, as It was believed that the
i long absence from the fogs of England
| would prove beneficial. I cannot bear
I to stay away so long, though, and will
I probably return home sooner.
"I would have gone back last fall if
it had not been for the illness of my
! aunt, Mrs. Canning, who has not been
well this winter. My husband may go
on a lecture tour to Australia, South
I Africa and this country, and if he
j does, I will join him. He is at present
in London attending to his official
duties.
"I have letters from him regularly
; twice a week, and there is absolutely
nothing in the rumor that we are about
to separate. It must have been started
i maliciously by some person or persons
: desiring to injure us.
"My married life has been the hap
piest part of my whole existence and
there is nothing 'that could give rise to
such rumors."
BOBBED A POSTOFFICE.
i Confession of Mark Alfred and Clar
ence Williams to the Officers.
OAKLAND, March 2.â Mark Alfred and
' Clarence Williams, supposed to be orph
! ans, residing with their grandmother in
j West Berkeley, were arrested last night
i and were lodged In the County Jail on a
: charge of petit larceny although by their
| own confession they are guilty of a much
more serious crime. Deputy Sheriff Fred
Rawson arrested them and declares that
they have a hard record in that town.
Monday night about 10 o'clock they en
! tered the West Berkeley Postofflce and
! besides taking about a dollar in pennies
from the till they helped themselves from
the stock of candies and gum of Miss
: Kate Teague, the Postmistress. They
' confess to this act and give the names of
two other boys who were their compan
ions upon that occasion. They declare

out of the dumps and they ate as if they

believed that all of the fires and burglar

THE LAW MAY
DEFEAT ITSELF
Peculiar Test of the New
California Divorce
Statute.
Can a Couple, Once Divorced,
Marry Again Within
a Year?
The Hatches of Berkeley Intend to.
Remarry and Take
Chances.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 2.
One of the most interesting features
of the new divorce law which forces
people who secure legal separation to
keep out of matrimony for a year at
least has been brought up by Mr. and
Mrs. Hatch of Berkeley. They have
secured a license to marry, and each
of them has been in the divorce courts
within a year. The parties who now
want to be married were a few months
ago parties in the same divorce case.
The case is the first of its kind that
has arisen under the new act, and at
torneys are advancing some very in
teresting opinions. The Hatches were
married a few years ago, and now the
husband is 32 and the wife 26. They
lived happily for a short time, and
then discovered that they had made a
mistake, and the divorce court was
sought. About nine months ago they
were separated, and since then Mr.
Hatch has resided in Berkeley and his
wife in Alameda.
Soon after the divorce they both re- j
alized that the differences between \
them were comparatively trivial, and |
they commenced to make love again, j
and with good success. A few days j
ago they decided to remarry, and now |
they have a license.
The question has arisen, are they yet j
divorced, and can they marry again? j
The courts have held that under i
the law the divorce is not complete
until a year has elapsed after the de
cree has been recorded. If this holds
good. Mr. and Mrs. Hatch are yet
married and Â«have no need to go
through the ceremony again. If the
divorce is complete, then they cannot '
marry again, according to the strict â 
letter of the law. j
The new divorce law was framed for
the purpose of protecting the marriage
rite, and never contemplated a situa
tion such as that of the Hatches.
Should the law operate to keep them
apart it would be defeating the very
purpos* for which it was framed. The
County Clerk evidently believes in aid
ing their remarriage, for he consented ;
to the issuance of the license.
WILL PROSECUTE
AS WELL AS JUDGE
. â â - â¢ â â â  :â¢:
Next Wednesday Night Set for
.- the Trial of E. C. Kil- l
patrick.
The Principal Charged by the School
Directors With Unprofes
sional Conduct.
The- School Directors hel^ a special
meeting yesterday to Â«se*. a day when the
charges of unprofessional conduct
against E. C. Kilpatrick, principal of the
evening business school, will be - heard.
Nearly all the afternoon was spent in
getting a quorum of the board together,
and when , the Directors were called to
order President Barrington stated the
object of the meeting, and quoted the
rules of the board â¢ under which the
charges were brought. Then the charges
were read. " . â 
Eugene Deuprey and H. S. Aldriclpa ap
peared for the accused principal, and
when the clerk 'had finished the long list
of accusations against the teacher At
torney Aldridge asked for a continuance
of the case for. a few days, as he had
only been engaged in the defense, and he
wanted time to confer with his client and
with his associate counsel.
Director Carew moved that a continu
ance be granted until Wednesday next,
and that at that time the case be heard.
Attorney Deuprey asked that they be
not bound to go on with it at that time.
Circumstances in the plan of defense
might arise which .would make it an in
justice to the defendant to make an ar
bitrary rule that the case must proceed
at that time. , .
The motion of Carew. however, was
carried. â  â  â  ' x
Director Derham asked if it was not a
matter,, of record that the board had em
ployed Attorney O'Donnell to prosecute
the charges made against Principal Kil
patrick, and if it was not also on record
that the charges had been preferred by
R. Hoey, who - was also an employe of
the board. He asked -why it was that the
board had employed an attorney for one
employe of the board and not for the
other. "Is this board to prosecute the
charges against Principal Kllpatrick and
to sit as judges and jurymen as well?"
the director asked. --- â¢â <-.ââ 
It was explained that Attorney O Don
nell was the attorney of the board, but
his duties were so defined that he would
have to be especially employed to con-,
duct the present case. Director; Gallagher
moved that he be so employed. After
considerable discussion as to the means
of paying the attorney the motion was
carried, with Director Waller asking to
be excused from voting on the motion.

A CLOSE FIT
AT THE WIRE
Morinel and Martha II
Run a Dead Heat
at Ingleside.
Flying Magdalenes Captured
the Ocean View Stake
Easily.
Two Favopitea in Frontâ Howard
Mann Again LÂ«t His Backers
Down With a Thud.
The racing at Ingleside yesterdafy
â¢was better than for some days past.
Entries were more plentiful and the
finishes in several instances -were high
ly exciting. In the final race of the
day the game little piece of horseflesh
Morinel, ridden by Spencer, and Tom
Griffin's crack filly, Martha 11, with
Tod Sloan in the saddle, passed the
wire nose and nose, the judges decid
ing a dead heat. The Ocean View stake
for two-year-old fillies was annexed by
the flying Magdalenes, by long odds
the most highly educated youngster yet
shown this season. Favorites were able
to capture but two purses.
â¢ A big tield of maidens started in the
opening five furlong dash, which was
captured by Little Alarm, a 10 to 1
shot, played down to 5. Aprona, the
Corrlgan entry, finished second.
In ihe six furlong sprint following, R.
Q. Ban, second choice in the betting,
ridden by 'Skeets" Martin, made all
the running and won t-asily from Pat
Murphy, an 8 to 1 chance. Don Fulano
received a pathetic ride at the hands
of Spencer, and though a well played
favorite, it was passed unnoticed by
the judges.
Thr- crowd wanted nothing but Mag
dalenes in the betting on the stake
event. She was quickly backed down
from fi to f> to even money, and with
120 pounds and Spencer on her back,
made her field, look like a lot of sheep.
Winifred, a fi! 1 - by Riley. carry-- the
Corrigan colors, ran a very creditable
race the first time out. taking the
from Humidity. The winner covered
the route over a track several seconds
slow in 50 seconds.
The followers of Howard Mann were
ae.ii- doomed to disappointment. The
bay horse was a 7 to 10 favorite for the
mile and a half purse affair and fin
ished last of the trio of starters. Ar
gentina, the outsider of the party in
tho betting. wi* v Cla^on in the saddle,
ni"' 5 - the running for a mile and a
quarter, when Thorpe hustled T '-"oha
II to the front and won by five lengths.
The two mile hurdle event proved
a gift for the* Corrigan jumper, Capt.
Rees, piloted by Huston. Monita. rac
ing in Andy Blake's colors, was second.
Traverser. the 4 to 5 favorite for the
concluding mile run for three-year
olds, met with a streak of hard luck
at the very outset of the running.
Thorpe tried to get through on the in
side but was shut off by both Morinel
and Martha. Down the back stretch
. he found an opening and momentarily
fhowed in front. In the run home both
Morinel and Martha again headed the
favorite and the two fillies fought it
out. It was a very tight fit at the end,
-TTOausing the officials in the stand to de
cide a dead heat. Traverser was third.
TRACK ITEMS.
Little Alarm was handel about as the good
thing for the opening scramble, anh the wise
ones B:ot aboard at 10 to 1. He won with little
to fpare.
Starter Caldwell Is considered a keen judge
of horseflesh, and the veteran flag wlelder Is
very sweet on the filly Mapdalenes. He ad
vtaed H. F. Edwards to enter her In the double
event at Saratoga, and thinks It will be only
a walk for the daughter of Emperor of Nor
folk.
For their oalisthc-nic exhibition in Tuesday's
race. Mike Hennessy and Spencer earned a
week's vacation. So said the Judges yester
day. Mike rode Fashion Plate and Spenrer
Daylight. The latter tried to put Hennessy
ever the fence, and the irrepressible Mike

EVIDENCE IN
HIS STOMACH
John J. Armstrong, Marine En
gineer, Arrested on a Charge
of Grand Larceny.
Accused of Stealing a $3 Oold Piece
From a Friend Which He
Swallowed.
John J. Armstrong, engineer on the oil
steamer Oleum, was arrested yesterday
afternoon on a charge of grand greeny
and he carries the evidence of his guilt
in his stomach.
J. T. Stevens, the steward of the steam
er was paid off yesterday and he and
Armstrong had several drinks together.
In the afternoon they were in Stevens'
room on Third and Folsom streets, when
Stevens accused Armstrong of stealing
his purse. Armstrong denied the accu
sation, but Stevens was insistent and used
j very strong language in backing up his
i assertion Finally Stevens locked Arm
! strong in the room and went in search of
! a policeman. He cou^d not find one and
j returned to his room. He told Armstrong
thai; he would have him arrested unless
I he delivered up his purse and Armstrong
handed it back. Stevens examined it and
found that a $o gold piece was missing.
He accused Armstrong of taking the gold
piece and when he refused to return it
he again locked him up in the room and
' went in search of an officer. He met
I Policeman T. C. Murphy and after ex
! plaining the disappearance of the $5 asked
I him to arrest Armstrong. Murphy ac
companied Stevens to his room and placed
Armstrong under arrest. He took him to
the patrol box on the corner and while
i waiting for the wagon a small boy called
Murphy's attention to the fact that his
prisone"r had something in his mouth.
Murphy made a grab for Armstrong's
throat, but Armstrong was too quick for
him and with a desperate effort swal
lowed something which Stevens declared
was his $5 gold piece. Armstrong was
taken to the City Prison and a charge of
grand larceny was booked against him.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1025 Mission.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 1898.
MT. HAMILTON
THE WINNER
The Ancient Order of
United Workmen
Visit the Fair.
Three Hundred Chinese Babies
Will Be on Exhibition
To-Day.
The Olympic CKib Will Give
a Performance This
Evening.
Great was the success of the Ancient
Order of United Workmen's day at the
fair yesterday. The exercises of this
all-Important order took place in the
evening, and drew to the Pavilion an
immense audience. Thirty-one lodges
of the order, under the command of
Grand Marshal C. S. Curtis, formed at
Union square at 7:30 o'clock and, head
ed by a platoon of police and a band,
marched to the Pavilion down Stockton
street to Market and thence to the fair.
After the regular features of the
evening, there was a competitive drill
between the teams of Mount Hamilton
Lodge No. 43 and Prosperity Lodge No.
309. Both teams did the regular pre
scribed floor walk of the order, and
their maneuvering was excellent, and
elicited great applause. The Judges
were General E. H. Black and Captain
T. F. O'Neil of the National Guard.
The Mount Hamilton team was award
ed the decision, it having made 95
points out of a possible 100, while the
Prosperity team only made 85Vfe points.
The successful team will take the
handsome banner which they won back
to San Jose with them to-day.
The county delegates of the various
mining exhibits were tendered a ban
quet last night by the management of
the fair at the Pavilion.
The chief feature this afternoon will
be the Chinese baby show, when 300 of
the infantile inhabitants of Chinatown
will make a bid for notice from the
judges. At night the Olympic Club will
give a varied and wonderful exhibition,
which promises to be most interesting.
It will last for an hour and a half, and
is as follows:
Horizontal bars, Belau and Moll; club
swinging. A. Holdrfdge; Spanish rings,
Lozell brothers; wrestling, three bouts:
perch pole, Miehling and Hoag; box
ingâStewart Carter vs. J. Doyle, C.
Milward vs. F. Recconi, Leonard vs.
Donahue; blackened glove contest, J.
Peary vs. Ed Sullivan.
TWO GREEN JAPS
TAKE DEADLY NAPS
Ignorance of Men From the
Orient Comes Near Result
ing in Death.
They Hire a R*- om at the Occidental,
Blow Out the Gas and
He'ire.
When TV. Taknsi and T. Ito registered
at the Occidental the other day George
Hooper, supposing that two such prom
inent officials of progressive Japan knew
as much as the average 10-year-old Amer
ican youth, assigned them rooms on the
first floor, taking no further precautions
than were necessary for their comfort in
the matter of bedding. Ice water, etc.
Now George knows better and when other
Oriental diplomats and statesmen put in
an appearance the meter will be shut off
and nurses provided.
Takasl, who is the newly appointed
representative of the Mikado at Chicago,
and Ito, who is on his way to inspect the
cruiser which the Cramps are building
at their works for Japan, arrived on the
Doric Monday and after escaping the
deadly smallpox went to the Occidental
where yesterday morning they nearly met
their death from the no less deadly gas-
cock. Â ..
The two gentlemen were up until after
1 o'clock yesterday morning receiving and
entertaining friends to whom they bade
good night, retiring soon after to room
2S. which they occupied together as a
sleeping apartment.
Shortly before 9 o clock in the morning
a chambermaid passing their door no- j
ticed a strong odor of escaping gas and I
notified the porter, who in turn aroused I
George Hooper from his slumbers. Mr.
Hooper at once proceeded to the room and
forcing admittance discovered one Jap
seated on a chair near the window and i
the other lying In a semi-conscious con
dition on the bed.
Dr. George Franklin Shlels, who is liv
ing in the house, was at once summoned.
He found no difficulty In restoring the
man on the chair, who was but slightly
overcome, but his companion on the bed
was in a very badly cyanosed condition !
nnd it took several hours of hard work
to bring him around.
From what can be learned through the j
medium of an interpreter it seems that !
the two foreigners upon retiring turned
the gas down low and then blew it out
as they would a lamp, with the result that
they nearly lost their lives from asphyx
iation. _____________

GREEN SAYS HE
SCRATCHED ALVARADO
He Comes to the Aid of Corrigan, Who Was
Charged With the Doing
of It.
â 
"Sink's Horses Are Cheap," Says the Director,
44 and They Are AH Bad
Actors."
The announced withdrawal of W. B.
Sink from the local turf has caused a
ripple of excitement among the race
goers and the horsemen. Corrigan
does not care to talk about itâ he only
takes time to say he knows nothing
about the affair.
Green, secretary of the Jockey Club,
has come to the rescue of his superior
and has announced that it was he and
not Mr. Corrigan who scratched the
luckless Alvarado last Saturday, just
when everything seemed to augur well
for a winning.
Mr. Corrigan was not pleased with
the remarks made about him by Sink,
and he said as much in language for
cible enough to do duty in any emer
gency. He said, too, that he had
never any idea of why and how Sink's
horse was scratched, but he thought it
was because the animal was a bad
actor at the barrier and was apt to
spoil, the field.
The responsibility for the scratching
of the horse seems to be divided, for
while Mr. Green maintains that there
Is no -one in the club who has the right
to scratch a horse outside of himself,
stfll he is not willing to admit, except
by inference, that he did really take
Alvarado from among the starters on
Saturday. He also denies that he ever
told Sink that Alvarado could run in
the race. He declares, however, that
CTorrigan has no such power.
"Sink's horses are cheap, anyway,"
&aid Mr. Corrigan yesterday, as he
grew talkative over Sink and his do
ings. "He buys cheap horsesâ horses
that are bad actors and have mean
tempers â and then he wants to run
them without schooling them to the
starting gate. He ought to take to
something else."
Mr. Green explains that he
scratched Alvarado because the horse
did not act well at the barrier. There
la a rule, he said, that all horses must
be schooled at the barrier before being
allowed to enter in a race, and he
says Alvarado has been at the school
ing gate but once and that was yes
terday morning.
"All of Sink's horses are unruly," he
said, "and we have had a great deal
6t trouble with them. Lucky Dog was
a particularly- ugly horse while he was
under Sink's management, but now he
gives but little trouble. Alvarado
gave us- so much trouble and delay
that it was decided to refuse his entry,
and of course there was bitterness at
once.
"I dtm't see how Sink can say I told
him his entry of Alvarado was accept
able," said Mr. Green, "for I said

nothing of the kind. I saw his horse
do some very creditable work before
the race, and I sajd I thought he
might do well. I never said he was
eligible to enter."
Mr. Corrigan also took occasion to
say that not since he had any control
of the track had there been any races
fixed for some one particular horse to
win, or had there been any fixing to
make it easier for some men and harder
for others.
"Everybody knows I never had any
hand in such work and that I will not
countenance it," he said. "I never
wanted a race fixed for myself and I
would not allow one to be fixed for any
one else."
Despite the denial, however, horse
men are not accepting the statement
that Corrigan is entirely disinterested
with that alacrity which betokens an
abiding faith in its truth. But what
Corrigan says is pretty near the law
out on the track, and the smaller own
ers must stand in or be willing to take
the consequences of speaking their
minds.
There are many, too, who have felt
the disciplining arm of the track stew
ards who attribute their sufferings
directly to the fact that they had
beaten out a Corrlgan horse. W. J.
Spiers, owner of the great O'Connell,
was suspended for sixty days for the
erratic running of his two-year-old
Santello. He was beaten out in one
| of his early races and later, when he
| ran again, he beat Milt Young, a Cor
rigan colt, and his suspension followed.
This was afterward reduced to thirty
days. Spiers assigns the beating of
; the Corrigan colt as a more direct
cause for his suspension than any ques
; tion of off running.
Nolan & Thall of Texas had a sim-
ilar experience, following on the run
ning of Also Ran, and J. H. Shields
was given a similar vacation for the
reversal of form shown in the running
of Joe Terry. Theee men all declare
that they received the best of treat
ment at the Oakland track, and they
blame Corrigan for most of the trou
ble that comes to them on this side.
The betting of the owners in each case
showed poor faith.
Among the horsemen themselves and
among the betting men Corrigan Is not
liked; and since his breach, with S. N.
Androus, the president of the club, the
disesteem threatens to invade the de
liberations of the directors. The trou
ble with Androus arose from a sug
gestion made by Androus and received
by Corrigan very much as he would
have received a blow. Androus would
not stand his language, and so the two
have not spoken since.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 1898.
LED TO DEATH
BY HOPELESS LOVE
Leopold Nathan Feldman, a Physician,
Ends His Life With an Unknown
Poison.
He Was the Son of Wealthy Parents in England, but
Was Left to His Own
Resources.
To all whom it may concern:
That should anything happen to me
I request that everything I possess
in America and also in England
shall be handed over to Miss Re
gina Levy of 2222 Pine street, San
Francisco, without reserve or con
dition. She will also place herself
in communication with R. Raphael,
lawyer, of Moorgate street, Lon
don, who will watch over her in
terests. I leave all to Miss Regina
Levy because the happiest time in
my life was spent in her company.
LEOPOLD NATHAN FELDMAN.
February 1, 1898.
Leopold Nathan Feldman, a physi
cian of London, England, and a son of
wealthy parents, committed suicide
yesterday afternoon in his apartments
at 528 Eddy street. He took poison, the
character of which Is at present un
known. Despondency, caused by his un
requited affection, and the fact that he
was unable to collect sufficient funds
to carry him through life in a suitable
manner, led the unfortunate man to
commit the deed. The body now lies at
the Morgue and the distorted features
are proof of. the means by which he
ended his life.
His history, aa told by acquaintances,
Is a sad one. Through fast living he
had been left in this city by his parents
who are at present in London. The de
ceased has resided in this city for about
two years and after a few months here
he met and courted Miss Reefina Levy,
an estimable young lady who lives with
her parents at 2222 Pine street. For a
time his affections seemed to be re
turned, but later it was learned that
Feldman had been previously betrothed
and through troubles had broken the
engagement, and Miss Levy no longer
accepted the attentions of her former
lover.
Feldman spent money rapidly for a
I time, but recently he has been unable
i to make his own livelihood, and it is
thought this was one of the reasons
which induced him to take his own
! life. He left a will and several letters.
i It seems to be the oft-told story of a
; young man who was blessed with op
i portunities rarely gained, but who,
! through his desire to enjoy life, had
j separated himself from his family and
' former friends and gone into the world
I with a determination to gain enjoy
| ment or lose both name and life. From
! reports, he has succeeded in doing both,
i and as his parents are stated to be
; exceedingly respectable people, the
j case seems to be the more regrettable.
At first he lost the respect of his
I family, then his honor, recently his
! valuables, and lastly his life, through
! his own actions. For the past eight
j months he had been employed in the
I pawnshop s>wned by Mr. Coleman at 41
Third street, and while there gained
many friends in the neighborhood. He
was a frequent visitor at the house of
jJ. Brachmann, a pawnbroker. About
j five weeks ago he entered Brachmann's
j place of business and asked for a re-
I volver for the purpose of taking his
own life, but he was refused and per
suaded to fight the battle which seemed
to him to be an uphill one. It is stated
that for the past six weeks Feldman
has been determined to commit suicide,
and last evening his determination was
carried to a successful issue. A letter
written to his parents was found under
his pillow. It said:
My Dear Parents: This Is the last let
ter you will receive from me. All the hap
piness I looked forward to is over. Miss
Levy, after six months' courting, has
parted from me. I have tried for the last
few days to overcome the disappointment,
but I cannot. It is driving me crazy, and
I would rather die than be crazy. I
tried very hard to do all that is good, and
I believed that she loved me. But it is
all over now. I loved her with my life,
but now life is not worth living without
her. Good-by and God bless you. For
give me and do not think too harshly
of me.
Another letter was addressed to Dr.
M. S. Levy as follows:
When a man is down to a certain level
he had better give up sooner than go
lower. So It Is with me. Everything is
against me, and I am tired of the strug
gle. No hope, no love. I cannot write
this to my parents, but as soon as I write
a couple of letters I am going to kill my
self. You will write and teil them all
about it. That is all I ask you to do for
me. You might have done more. I leave
further instructions in my pocket-book,
which will be found upon me. I am tired
of It all. so wish you good-by.
L. N. FBLDMAN.
Feldman had previously resided for
some time at 508 Larkln street, but
about three months ago he moved to
the rooms where he took his own life.
Mr. Brachmann said last evening that
he had known Feldman for the past
eight months, and that he had ap
peared to be rather erratic at times,
and without doubt was fond of the so
ciety of women.
"For the past few weeks," he said,
"Feldman has been addicted to hard
drink, and even smoked opium at times.
I was surprised to hear that he ha,d
committed suicide, but I should not
have been, as he attempted to commit
the act but a few weeks ago. lam ex
ceedingly sorry, as his parents are very
respectable and wealthy people."
On the body was found a memoran
dum book of poems, speaking of love,
and all addressed to "Regina."
Dr. Levy said last evening that he
had frequently aided Feldman in a
financial way, and he believed he was
a good and hard-working young man.
It is admitted that Feldman is a grad
uate of Cambridge. No money was dis
covered on the body, and it is supposed
he had sent what little capital he pos
sessed to his parents in England. It is
probable Dr. Levy will have the body
prepared for shipment and sent to his
parents, who are as yet ignorant of the
death of their only son.
Miss Regina Levy, the young lady
whose affections Feldman tried to win,
was seen at her residence, at 2222 Pine
street, last evening. She said that the
first news of his death was brought to
her by some one from the Coroner's of
fice.
"I have only known Dr. Feldman a
few months, he being a casual visitor
to my home," she added. "I was nev
er engaged to him, and showed him no
affection. Why he should have picked
me out in this manner, I cannot under
stand. I deplore the notoriety, and feel
sorry for his death as much as I would
feel for any friend."
LEGISLATING FOR SCHOOLS.
Freeholders Providing a System by
Which the Board of Education
Will Be Out of Politics.
The Board of Education and the
management of the public schools was
the question that occupied the atten
tion of the Freeholders last night.
The Joint committee on education and
law reported for the action of the con
vention a system by which the public
schools of this city will be taken away
for all time to come from the control of
the politicians. The report, which was
adopted at the meetinp last night, pro
vides for the app"!ntment by the
Mayor of three director*, who shall

In addition to these three directors
the superintendent is authorized to ap
point four deputy superintendents, who
must have had ten years' experience
as teachers. Their term of office runs
for four years, with a similar provis
ion to that governing the appointment
of the directors, that the appointments
shall run, two for two years, and two
for four years, after the first appoint
ments are made, but the directors shall
hold for only three years. Full com
pensation is to be paid the directors
and they are commanded to devote
their entire time to their duties
Delegate McCarthy fought long and
hard for five directors, but the odds
were against him. and he had to con
tent himself with changing his vote
and giving notice of reconsideration at
the next meeting.
By a provision of the article, an ad
ditional deputy superintendent is to be
appointed when the number of school
children reaches 45,000, and for every
10,000 thereafter, an additional deputy
must be appointed.
All supplies must be furnished the
department by contract, the same to
be advertised for and bids received.
The salaries of all teachers must be
paid on or before the sth of each and
every month and the Supervisors are
compelled to make appropriations in
the yearly levy in accordance with the
schedule furnished them by the direc
tors for this purpose.
The same statutory provisions that
now exist regarding the dismissal of
teachers were made a part of the char
ter.
FRANK L COOMBS
STATE LIBRARIAN
Chosen at a Session of the
Trustees Held Last
Night.
Numerous Ballots Were Taken
Before the Board Came to a
Choice.
The trustees of the State Library met
at the Palace Hotel last evening: and
elected Frank L. Coombs State Librarian.
The session was held in the rooms of the
Republican State Committee. The new

desertion. Florence CJarneau has been
granted a divorce from Charles C. Gar
neau on the ground of extreme cruelty.
GOLD MADE
AS YOU WAIT
Bryce's Method of Trans
mutation as Old as
the Hills.
The Dream of Ancients Never
Realized Nor Likely
to Be.
Science Laughs at the Modern Cagli-
Otetro and Carlyle Would Doubt
less Boast Him if Here.
For fear that somebody who wants
gold lost the recipe for making it as
printed yesterday, the directions are
reprinted. They seem simple enough:
HOW TO MAKE GOLD.
Pure antimony, five parts.
Sulphur, ten parts.
Iron, one part.
Caustic soda, four parts.
Place these ingredients In a
graphite crucible and expose to
a white heat of 5000 degrees
from eight to forty-eight hours.
Powder the resulting mass and
mix it well to incorporate the
metal with slag. Combine this
with charcoal, one part; oxide
of lead, five parts, and caustic
soda, four parts. Fuse the whole
until a metallic button is ob
tained. Scarify and cupola this
metallic mass, and the resulting
bead will be gold and silver.
There is a firmly rooted belief In the
inutility of attempting to make a silk
purse out of a sow's ear. Another be
lief equally strong is that the baser
metals cannot be transmuted into gold.
Of these two somewhat analogous be
liefs the latter is based on the results
of experiments extending over many
years, their beginning lost in the van
ished fumes of the alchemists' furnace,
whose mystic glow was a terror to the
ancients, a token that science and the
devil were in league.
Count Cagliostro was once described
by an irascible old gentleman named
Carlyle as a "quack of quacks," as "a
king of liars," as a "gold cook." The
count was supposed to manufacture the
precious metal. In cold truth, he had
a habit of extracting it ready minted
from the adjacent pocket of the credu
lous, and Carlyle, having had to earn
his own money, and having besides a
touch of dyspepsia, was displeased at
the pretense. The count having been
born reasonably early in the last cen
tury, is dead now, but his memory has
been kept green, and here and there an
imitator has arisen. Perhaps E. C.
Bryce of Chicago is one of these; per
haps the effort to attain the unattain
able has turned the Bryce head. At
any rate, Mr. Bryce announces that he
can make gold with the ease that one
less gifted can make bricks. He even
gives to the world the formula he em
ploys. It may be a good formula for
some 1 purposes. as, for instance a bait
for suckers. In the creation o : the > el
low; joy |in quest of which . thousands
are invading the Klondike,, it does not
convince the mind of sano investigai
ors that it has a part to play. =. â¢-
Thomas -Price, assayer, analytical
chemist and mining engineer, had reaa .
In The Call of yesterday the announce
ment. "There is no merit whatever in
it," said Mr. Price. "Such statements
have been made from time immemorial,
and the process was described in tne
antique times of Egypt. Transmuta
tion of metals is. a dream, and tne
only redeeming feature of it has been,
that it led to the foundation of true
chemistry."
Answering the question as to
whether he had ever made attempts in
the direction of discovering the process..
Mr. Price replied that he would as soon
think of trying to fly. "If by the Bryce
method gold could be made," he con
tinued, " it would be much easier to
stay at home and manufacture It than
to climb the Chilcoot Pass and brave
the arctic winter. : It is simply humbug- "
of the first water." â¢:
Professor Price then followed the
Bryce scheme through in detail, show
ing that the outcome would not, be a
button of gold but of lead; and a but- .
ton of lead may be procured at less .
trouble and expense. Professor Wil
liam T. Wenzell entirely supported this
view.
Yet there were many who believed in
Cagliostro, and there will be disciple*
of Bryce. So be that he shower them
with gold buttons is it for them to
cavil at the source? Shall they bru
tally opine that their own good dollars
contributed to the advancement of
science went into the pot? It would bar
positive ingratitude. The Count of old
fooled people a little and there is noth
ing to show people have grown wiser. :
TOMMY BY AN TO McCOY.
The Welter-Weight Will Fight ''The
Kid" or Will Take on Demon.
Walcott.
Tommy Ryan, the champion welter
weight pugilist of the world, was ajnuM
yesterday when he read "Kid" McCoy's
challenge to Choynski.
"Why, I have offered all manner of In
ducements to McCoy if he will. agree to
fight me within the middle-weight limit,
which is 154 pounds," said Ryan, "but for
some reason best known to himself he
avoids me and pretends to fly to higher
game. He hRS not the remotest Idea of
fighting Choynski nor any other good
man in the heavy-weight class. â¢ Ha
makes his own matches and always se
lects men who are classified among th-9
dubs. Lo^k at his record; It is composed
principally of names of men who have
never amounted to anything. He whip
ped me once when I was a light welter
weight; he then had about fifteen pounds
the better of me in weight.
"The last time we met I was putting it
all over him when the police stopped the
game. I will fight him for money or mar
bles at lA pounds, which is the middle
weight limit, and I will bet that after Our
contest the 'Kid' will have good reason
to quit talking through the papers. In
fact, you cannot get him to fight outside
of one or two clubs, where he can have a
fight stopped at any time he pleases.
"He has as much idea of fighting
Choynski as he has of fighting Fitzsipi
mon's. All he wants is cheap newspaper
notoriety. . â â 
"I am opposed to fighting colored men,
but if I cannot drag McCoy into a ring I
suppose I will have to take on Walcott,
as he is looked upon as being the greatr
est welter-weight in the countryâ that Is,
barring myself, of course. He did up
Green in the same round that he (Green)
went down before me, but the California!!
was at his best fighting weight when he
entered the ring with me, and, if 1 un
derstand rightly. Green was weak when
he fought Walcott. However, I will fight
Walcott at catch weights, but I prefer to
take on McCoy, as I am more than anx
ious to knock a chunk of conceit out of
Mr. Norman Selbey. alias the 'Kid.' "
Although the Sharkey-Choynski fight: is
near at hand, there is very little interest
taken In the match.
