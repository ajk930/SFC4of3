THREE TUGS SOLD
TO THE UNITED
STATES YESTERDAY
The Fearless, Active and Vigilant of the
Spreckels Line Added to the
Auxiliary Fleet.
This Step, in the Line of Protecting the Coast From
Spanish Privateers, Brings the Menace of
War to San Francisco's Very Door.
The tugs Fearless, Vigi
lant and Active, of J. D.
Spreckels & Bros. Co.'s fleet
of tugs, doing duty on the
bay of San Francisco, were
purchased by the United
States yesterday, and last
mght they were turned over
to the Navy Department,
with orders that they be
taken to the navy-yard at
Mare Island immediately.
Negotiations for the pur
chase of the tugs have been
in progress between repre
sentatives of the navy and
J. D. Spreckels & Bros. Co.
for several days, but it was
not until late yesterday that
orders were received from
the Navy Department at
Washington to close the deal
and order the vessels to the
navy - yard without delay.
Each of the three vessels
has been inspected by naval
constructors and plans made
for placing armament on
them. Several six - pound
guns will be mounted on
each tug, and possibly tor
pedo tubes will be fitted to
the Fearless. The guns for
the tugs are now on the way
from the arsenals in the East,
and before they can arrive
mounts will be arranged for
them on the newly acquired
auxiliary naval vessels, so
they can be put in place at
once.
There will be as little de
lay as possible in preparing
the tugs for service with the
naval fleet, and when they are
ready for sea they will be at
tached to Reir-Admira! Mil
ler's command on the North
Pacific.
The tugs, when fitted with
guns, will be used as patrol
boats along the coast in case
of hostilities. They will prac
tically be the skirmish boats
of the fleet of war ships and
act as dispatch boats and tor
pedo-boat destroyers as well.
The Fearless was built in
1892 at the Union Iron Works
and is the largest tugboat
that flies the American flag.
She is 400 gross tons regis
ter, 153 feet long, 26 feet
beam and 16 feet depth of

RESOLUTIONS IN CONGRESS
WHICH WILL MEAN WAR.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â 1t is believed that the resolution
as now agreed upon â will be reported by the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations to-morrow. The preamble of the resolution says
in effect:
"That the horrible condition of affairs existing for more than
three years in the island of Cuba, so near to our borders, is shocking
and a disgrace to Christian civilization; that it has culminated in
the destruction of a United States battle-ship and 266 of her officers
and crew while on a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana, and that
such things as this cannot longer be tolerated, and therefore,
carrying out the suggestion in the President's message that Con
gress should act, be it resolved:
"First â That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right
ought to be, independent.
"Second â That the war Spain is waging against Cuba is so de
structive of the commercial and property interests of the United
States and so cruel, barbarous and inhuman in its character as to
make it the duty of the United States to demand, and the Govern
ment of the United States hereby does demand, that she at once
withdraw her land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"Thirdâ That the President of the United States be, and here
by is, empowered and directed to use the entire land and naval forces
of the United States to carry these resolutions into effect.
"Fourth â That the President is authorized to call out the mili
tia of the different States to such an extent as may be necessary to
carry these resolutions into effect."
The House committee has not been able to get together with
the same unanimity as the Senate committee has done, the Demo
crats holding out for the recognition of the independence of the
present so-called Government of Cuba. The Republican members
of the committee have agreed upon a resolution substantially in
language:
"Resolved, That the President be, and he hereby is, empowered
and directed at once to intervene to bring the war in Cuba between
the Government of Spain and the people of that island to an end for
the purpose of enabling the Cuban people of their own free action
to form a stable and independent Government of their own, and the
lnnd and naval forces of the United S+ttes are placed at the disposi
tion of the President to be used to carry out the purpose of this
resolution."
The preamble to this resolution recites the grounds of offense
against Spain, which culminated in the destruction of the Maine,
for which disaster the preamble declares that Spain Is responsible.
There will ba no delay in the House, and the resolution to be
reported will be passed by the House to-morrow afternoon unless it
is delayed for the purpose of enabling the Senate and House to come
to an agreement.
Late to-night the Republican members of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs succeeded in reconciling all their differences and
adopted the resolution, whiÂ«h will receive the unanimous support of
the Republicans In the House.

Lee Arouses Statesmen by the
Assertion That the Maine Was
Destroyed by Spaniards.
WASHINGTON, April 13.â 1t
was stated last night on high au
thority that an arrangement had
been practically effected by which
the resolutions may pass both
houses to-day. It is understood
that the Foreign Affairs Committee
of the House and the Foreign
Relations Committee of the
Senate will confer before the as
sembling of Congress for the
purpose of perfecting an agree
ment. Last night the members cf
the Senate committee believed that
the resolution would pass both
houses by a practically unanimous
vote. It was said if necessary a
continuous sitting would be had in
the Sena f e in order to secure final
action during the legislative day of
Wednesday.
NEW YORK. April 12.â The Her
ald's Washington corespondent tele
graphs:
The martial spirit is rampant in Wash
ington to-night. The arrival of Consul-
General Lee and other Consuls from
Cuba has greatly increased the war
feeling in and out of Congress. These
gentlemen, and particularly Consul-
General Lee, heartily indorse the
President's intervention plans, and they
want them put into effect at once.
From their standpoint the Maine
disaster is casus belli, and they are
as anxious to see the death of our
American sailors avenged through
the medium of war as they are to
have Spanish misrule in Cuba speed
ily brought to an end.
To Lee. and to the progress made by
the Foreign Relations Committee of the
Senate and the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee of the House in the formulation
of resolutions on practically the same
lines in favor of immediate forcible in
tervention, ure attributable the war feel
ing which exists in Washington to
night. It may pass off when some of
the peace men in Congress, and espe
cially "in the Senate, take their stand
against the speedy action contem
plated by the committee, which will be
sure to precipitate war. There will be
several speeches. Senator Caffrey says
he wants to make one, and probably
there will be two days in which to re
view the question of our international
obligations and the danger of interna
tional complication before the final
plunge is taken.
Senator Elkins also wants consider
able time to talk in favor of peace, and
Senator Burrows is prepared to de
liver a lengthy argument in opposition
to the recognition of independence.
There are many others on the war
side who differ in their views as to the
form of action that should be taken.
They will consume considerable time
under the elastic rules of the Senate.
There may be thus time for another
peace wave to succeed the present war
wave before the real crisis comes.
Mandatory resolutions directing
the President to intervene in Cuba,
and couched in such terms as to
amount practically to a declaration
of war, will be reported to both
houses of Congress to-morrow.
There does not seem to be much
probability to-night that the Senate ano
the House committees will report ex
actly identical resolutions. In fact there
will be considerable divergence in their
language, but they will be along the
same lines and will mean the same
thing. They will call for intervention to
end the war in Cuba and drive Spain
from the island, with no recognition of
the present so-called republic of Cuba,
but with the declaration of the indepen
dence of the Cuban people.
A unanimous report â Republicans
and 1 Democrats together â is expected
from the Senate committee. The pres
ent indications are that the Democrats
of the House committee will make a mi
nority report proposing the recognition
of the republic of Cuba.
Consul-General Lee's statements be
fore the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations had much to do with crystal
lizing opinion in that body. His nar
ration of his experiences and observa
tions in Havana and his description of
the destruction of the Maine, though it
brought out no new facts, united the
committee in favor of prompt and man
datory action to secure immediate in
tervention.
There was nothing in Consul-Gen
eral Lee's statement to confirm the re
ports which have been so indus
PACIFIC COAST
HARBORS WILL
BE PROTECTED
The Government Takes Steps to
Save the Ports of the West
From Spanish Privateers,
NEW YORK, April 12. â The Herald's Washington correspondent semta
the following: Preparations are being made by the Navy Department to give
Spain's privateers a warm reception should they attempt to attack one of the
coast cities of the United States. By establishing a second line of defense
along the Atlantic coast the authorities consider they have taken measures for
the protection of the seaports thereon from the depredations of detached
cruisers or of privateers.
Atte-ntion is now being turned to the Gulf and West coasts, and as a re
sult of the arrangements inaugurated to-day it is believed the cities along
these seaboards will be reasonably secure from attack.
As it is the plan of the Navy Department to first find and destroy the
Spanish fleet, it is not believed there will be much danger of an attempt by
Castilian men-of-war to destroy cities. The ships for which a sharp watch will
have to be maintained are privateers, and through Minister Woodford the
authorities have learned that it is proposed by the Spanish Government to
commission any number of privateers for operations against the commerce
and cities of the United States. It is considered possible that these vessels
may proceed to the Pacific and fire on the cities of the slope.
To prevent such an attempt being successful, the President to-day di
rected that the revenue cutters Perry, Grant, Corwin and Rush be turned over
to the Navy Department. These will be sent to Mare Island, where they will
receive heavier batteries than those which they now carry, and they will be
detailed to accompany the whaling fleet. The Fish Commission vessel Alba
tross has also been turned over to the navy for duty on the West Coast.
It has been finally determined to retain the cruisers Charleston and
Philadelphia in the Pacific to destroy any privateers or any detached cruisers
that may come to that section. The monitor Monterey will be stationed at
San Francisco to assist the land forces, and the monitor Monadnock will pro
tect the cities of Puget Sound.
It is understood by the officials that when Lieutenant-Commander
Joseph G. Sobral. formerly naval attache of the Spanish legation, was on duty
in the United States he visited the harbors of the Pacific Coast and carefully
inspected them, sending reports of their fortifications and their appearance to
his Government. It is considered probable that these reports may be used by
the Spanish Government for naval operations, and it is for this reason such a
careful distribution of naval forces in the Pacific has been made for the defense
of that coast.
The cruiser Charleston will shortly be ready for service and will be
placed in commission the latter part of this month. The cruiser Philadelphia
will be ready for service within thirty days, and when reported as ready will at
once be put in commission. The condition of the gunboat Yorktown is such
that it is stated at the department that she cannot be commissioned under
three months. So far as the Bennington is concerned, it is stated at the de
partment that nothing has been done looking to her withdrawal from Hono
lulu. No instructions have been sent to Rear-Admiral Miller, commander
in-chief of the Pacific station, to hoist his flag over the islands in case of war,
but it is generally conceded at the deportment that this will be done in order
that the islands may be provided with protection. Otherwise an attempt
might be made by Spain to injure Hawaiian cities, knowing that a proposi
tion is pending in the Congress of this country for the annexation of the
islands by the United States.

inquiry's report was made public, that

Spanish plot. He also exploded the
rumor that he had information of a
mine having been discovered under the
Montgomery. He gave It as his opinion
that the Maine had been destroyed by
a mine in the control of the Spanish
officials.
"Do you mean by the Spanish author2
ities in Cuba?" he was asked by a mem
ber of the committee.
" I mean the Spanish officials,"
replied, ''but not General Blanco. I
think some of the officials were cog
nizant of the plans to destroy the
vessel, but I do not believe that the
Captain-General was."
The most important feature of Con
sul-General Lee's statemen* was his de
claration that in his opinion the people
of Cuba had not yet succeeded in es
tablishing and maintaining such a gov
ernment as would be entitled to recoe
nition as an independent state. On this
point he was thoroughly in accord with
the President. While he is not in fa
vor of recognizing the so-called gov
ernment at this time, he believes that
the Cubans are capable of self-govern
ment and that if the United States shall
intervene and drive out the Spaniards
a government can be established and
maintained which will be stable and
would be entitled to recognition, as. a
member of the family of nations.
Consul-General Lee is to appear to
morrow before the Naval Strateerc
Board to discuss the defenses of Ha
vana and other Cuban seaports,' the lo
cation of mines, the best points of at
tack that should be made and the plan
of campaign after the troops have been
lam'tc.
There is nothing in the diplomatic
situation to afford any cheering hope
for peace.
If Spain is making any progress in
her negotiations for an armistice with
the Cubans the administration authori
ties have not heard of it, nor are there
any new developments, as far as can be
ascertained, regarding the secret nego
tiations for the purchase of Cuba. For
the time being Congress alone controls
the situation. Anticipating that Con
gress will act sooner or later, the ad
ministration is still going ahead with
its preparations for carrying out the
forcible intervention programme.
There were significant conferences be
tween the President and General Scho
tield this morning in regard to plans for

CommeQts of the Press Generally
f^ntagoQistic to McKjnley's
Message.
LONDON, April 12.â The Pall Mall Gazette regards President Mc-
Kinley's message as a strong and temperate statement of the case
against Spain. He upholds intervention merely in order to end the
war, leaving the ultimate destiny of Cuba to be decided according to
circumstances.
The St. James Gazette says: "The message has disappointed every
body, and leaves the uncertainy as great as ever."
The Graphic thinks the President's message is bound to lead to
war. It says: "Spain will, of course, resist intervention and war will
result. But the duty of the United States lies not less in the -vth
now marked out for her by the President."
The Westminster Gazette thinks the President's message "has
made out an excellent case for intervention by the United States."'
The Globe expresses the opinion that "it is a message of abdica
tion," and says: "While the situation in Cuba is eminently unsatis
factory, it is a question whether American interference on the lines
suggested is likely to improve matters."
The Dally News says this morning: "We do not desire to detract
from the credit that justly belongs to the Pope, but neither the spiritual
nor temporal machinery of Europe would have been put in motion to
stop the Horrors in Cuba except for the action of the United States. A
Weyler would be invaluable in Armenia. There is nothing selfish in
America's resolve that Cuba shall be freed from her butchers and tor
mentors. If the Pope really desired peace, he should exert the whole
of his great 'influence with Spain, who cannot, in the long run, disobey
him, while Spain would not suffer humiliation in submitting to the Pon
tiff, who has no physical force behind him."
The Times says: "Optimistic critics of President McKinley's mes
sage lose sight of the fact that in both Washington and Madrid those
whose chief preoccupation, to say the least, is not the maintenance of
peace, are playing with fire in a powder magazine. General Fitzhugh
Lee's influence will tend to aggravate the bitterness felt for the loss of
the Maine â a natural cause of suspicion and anger, but to blow these
smoldering fires into flame at the present critical moment is a rash act,
not easily to be condoned by the conscience of the civilized com
munity."
PARIS, April 12.â The Petit Parisien, commenti.ig upon President
McKinley's message, says that the President's forcible language will
cause a lively impression in Madrid and render more difficult the task
of the friends of peace.
The Autorite thinks that an armistice in Cuba will be ineffective.
The Journal expresses the opinion that Americans are carrying the
Monroe doctrine to extremes.
The Matin says the message proves McKinley's sang froid. His
sentiments are sincerely pacific and all depends upon the Cuban in
surgents' reception of the suggestion of a suspension of hostilities.
The Eclair says the message does not involve an immediate decla
ration of war, neither does it encourage optimistic hopes.
Le Temps says: "President McKinley's message is conciliatory,
and seems to avoid a bellicose solution, but it might well spoil every
thing by handing over the affair to Congress."
VIENNA, April 12.â The Fremdenblatt says that the President de
sires peace and seeks to secure it by establishing the right of interven
tion of the United States army in Cuba. This, the paper thinks, makes
the situation of the Spanish Government toward public opinion diffi
cult.
The Tagblatt says the message seems to avoid an immediate rup
ture in order to effect a rupture at a propitious moment.
ROME, April 12.â President McKinley's message is generally con
sidered as favorable to a pacific settlement of the Spanish-American
situation, but this morning's newspapers are silent on the subject.
BERLIN, April 12.â The National Zeitung says: "The postpone
ment of the decision in President McKinley's message is, in any case,
tranquilizing, inasmuch as he practically washes his hands of respon
sibility for war or peace, which is transferred to Congress."
The Vossiche Zeitung says: "The immediate danger of war has
been defer, id for some days, but there is no question of its complete
avoidance."
The Berliner Post remarks: "Peace cannot be regarded as assured
until both sides possess necessary circumspection and power to forcibly
suppress an ebullition of popular passion, should It occur."

The importance of taking a good Spring Medicine is well known
iv fact, its necessity is universally admitted. To argue
this point is useless â takes up your time and wastes our
space. The real question is, what to take ? Of course, you
want the best. For your blood you want a medicine which
cures blood diseases. For your appetite, stomach-weakness
and dyspeptic symptoms you want a medicine containing
appetite-giving, stomach-toning, dyspepsia-curing quatities.
For that tired feeling, dull headache, miserable, all-run-

OVATION TO
GENERAL LEE
Washington Goes Wild
Over the Return of
the Consul.
Unprecedented Demonstration
in the Halls of the
Capitol.
A Conference Held in thÂ« White
House Immediately Upon His
Arrival.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 12.
Consul General Fitzhugh Lee arrived
here from Havana at 2:30 o'clock this
afternoon. A large crowd of enthusias
tic admirers had gathered at the Penn
sylvania station and when the general
stepped from the train he was greeted
by a tremendous outburst of applause.
Women waved their handkerchiefs and
men their hats and altogether the dem
onstration was a notable one. Wash
ington crowds as a rule are not demon
strative, but this occasion was a con
spicuous exception.
Long before the hour set for the ar
rival of the train the crowd began to
gather. It completely filled the station
and Sixth street, adjacent on the east,
and extended far intoPennsy. ia ave
nue. The general occupied the last car
in has train, and when it was known that
it had reached the station there was a
tremendous rush to get a look at him.
By the time he was ready to alight the
crowd was so dense about the train
that, even with the assistance of a pla
toon of police, it was with difficulty
that he reached the platform.
Several friends of the general, among
them many ladies, pressed forward and
finally succeeded in grasping him by
the hand. One of the ladies presented
to him a bouquet of roses tied together
by ribbons of the national colors and
bearing a tiny Confederate battle flag.
Immediately the crowd began to cheer,
and round after round of applause
greeted him as he walked slowly and
uncovered down the long platform of
the station. On reaching the B-street
entrance General Lee entered a State
Department carriage and was rapidly
driven up the avenue to the State De
partment.
The general had not perceptibly
changed in appearance since he was
last in Washington. His eye was as
bright and his step as elastic as ever
and nothing in his manner indicated
that there had been anything unusual
in his experience during the last sev
eral months. How long he will remain
in Washington is not known, but it is
assumed that he will make his wishes
conform to those of the President as
to the length of his stay.
News that General Lee was on his
way to the State Department spread
rapidly, and when the carriage drew
up at the south front of the building a
big^crowd was assembled on the por
tico! A rousing cheer Went up aa Gen
eral Lee stepped from the vehicle, and,
bowing right and left, hurried into the
building. The cheers had apprised the
clerks and other employes of the big
building of his coming and there was a
wild rush for the State Department cor
ridor. Clerks left their desks without
leave, officers of the army and navy
joined the rush, and for the time being
the discipline of the building was re
laxed. The crowd lined up in front of
the elevator shaft, leaving a lane from
the door of the Secretary's office.
As the elevator came to a stop and
the Consul-General stepped out a scene
occurred unprecedented in the history
of the great building. Hat in hand,
General Lee passed into the corridor,
and some one said, "Now, boys," and
three rousing cheers went echoing down
the lonjr halls. Then there was another
tmtburst, and people poured forth from
every room.
The cheering caused intense excite
ment, and it was some moments before
quiet had been restored. General Lee
bowed to the crowd, and, as he reached
the door to Secretary Sherman's office,
turned and bowed again. Then the door
closed on him and the throng dispersed.
After a few minutes General Lee

SPANISH CONSUL
SECO WITHDRAWS
FROM KEY WEST
Papers and (Affairs in His Charge
Turned Over to England's
Representative.
NEW YORK, April 12.â A Key West (Fla.) special to the Herald
says: Rafael Seco, the Spanish Consul here, will leave on the Mas
cotte this evening, having to-day turned over his papers and the af
fairs of his consulate to British Vice-Consul W. J. H. Taylor. J. M.
Fernandez, Spanish Vice-Consul, who has been acting as Italian Con
sul, has also turned his affairs over to Mr. Taylor, who will now rep
resent here Great Britain, Spain and Italy. The action taken by Seco
and Fernandez was under instructions from the Spanish Minister in
Washington, Senor Bernabe, who this morning sent to Seco a copy of
his instructions received from Madrid.
The Postoffice Department received orders from Washington this
afternoon to return all Havana mail to the dead letter office, there to
be held pending the resumption of amicable relations with the au
thorities in Cuba. The order will affect a large amount of mail arrived
to-day on the steamers Mascotte and City of Key West. This ac
tion is regarded as denoting complete severance of relations with the
Spanish authorities at Havana.
The exodus from Key West began to-night. News of the action of
the Congressional Committee made war appear so imminent that the
wives and families of naval officers and prominent citizens of Key
West decided it was best not to delay their departure longer. Nearly
all the staterooms of the Mascotte and City of Key West are taken.
Many refugees will stop at Jacksonville until the storm breaks and
then proceed farther north.
emerged, accompanied by Secretary
Sherman and Assistant Secretary Day.
The three entered a carriage and were
quickly driven to the White House.
General Lee got another ovation on his
way over.
At the White House the party was
shown at once to the library, where the
executive accorded a hearty reception
to the Consul-General. The only per
sons present at the meeting were the
President, Secretary Sherman, Judge
Day and General Lee. Secretary Sher
man remained with the others about
an hour and then returned to the State
Department. After being with the
President fully an hour Judge Day and
General Lee took their departure, the
latter going to his hotel. An immense
crowd, augmented by the number of
ladies who attended Mrs. McKinley's
reception, was on the portico when the
two came down stairs and General Lee
was given a tremendous ovation. As
their carriage was being driven away
some one fastened a Cuban flag to the
front of the vehicle and this was the
cause of additional enthusiasm.
The ovation that has followed Gen
eral Lee since he set foot on American
soil culminated to-night in what was in
many ways one of the most remarkable
demonstrations the city has ever seen.
The demonstration was almost as quick
and unpremeditated as that which
greeted General Lee at the depot and
at the State Department. The Marine
Band had been engaged from the bar
racks, and the Seventy-first Regiment
Band, under the leadership of Professor
Fanciulli, formerly conductor of the
Marine Band, came over from New
York on an afternoon train. The crowd
assembled without calling, and by 8
o'clock was 5000 strong in the streets
about the Shoreham Hotel, where Gen
eral Lee was quartered. Before the
close it was twice that size. . It was af
ter 9 o'clock before he appeared on one
of the small corner balconies, accom
panied by a committee of the Union
Veteran Legion and the Confederate
Veterans' Association, which was joint
ly in charge of the affair.
The bands struck up "The Star Span
gled Banner," and there was a burst of
fireworks from the neighboring houses,
while mounds of red, white and blue
lights flamed at intervals along the
street, throwing the crowd on the bal
cony into sharp^ relief against a back
ground of flags.^The crowd yelled itself
hoarse, calling for General Lee by
name and demanding a speech. The
speech was brief, and so much broken
by applause that the crowd caught
very little more than Its general drift.
General Lee said:
After all the speeches I have been
forced to make in the past two days I
can hardly hope to make myself heard
over this great gathering. I can only as
sure you that such a great demonstra
tion seems to me out of all proportion to
the simple fact of my humble presence
here, and I am frank to say I don't see
that I deserve it, having only tried to do
my duty as an American where circum
stances" placed me.
The crowd broke out afresh, and
there were yells, "That's it," "That's
what you did. General Lee continued:
I have to thank you most heartily for
"In the spring I was obliged to work "I
very hard. In consequence of this
I became all run in health and lost
my appetite. About all I lived on
was iced lemonade. Medicines were
prescribed for me and I was told
that when I had taken them I could
eat anything I wished. I followed
the prescriptions given me, but my
appetite did not imnrove. TT v ~ sum-
mer passed and all my strength
was gone. I became so weak I could
hardly walk across the floor. At
last I was completely prostrated,
and was under the care of different
physicians, but they did not seem
to understand my case. One phy-
sician told me my blood was all
gone and he gave me medicine, but
it did not help me. One day my
sister came to me and told me of
the great cures by Hood's Sarsapa-
rilla, of which she had read, and
she advised me to try it. I had
about lost faith in medicines,* but
thought I would try H.ood's Sarsa-
parilla. After taking the first bot-
tle I was much better. I then pro-
cured two more and continued the
use of the medicine until I was
well. I regret tl.at I did not begin
the use of Hood's Sarsaparilla
sooner. It has done me unspeaka-
ble good, and I advise all sufferers
to give it a trial." MRS. A. EVER-

this splendid indorsement of my course
It is a thing that can hardly come to a
man more than once in a lifetime, and it
moves me more than I can put into words.
"You can act pretty quick," cried a
man in the crowd, and then some one
yelled, "War! Fight!" and the cheer
ing drowned everything else. General
Lee continued:
I have not come to talk war, but if
war comes in a few days, or in a few
years, the present crisis has proved that
it will find us a united people, and the
oniy contest will be as to who can carry
the flag farthest and fastest.

of them one after another. I was
dropsical and had smothered feel-
ings and often swooned away. I
tried many different remedies, but
all to no avail, and I became dis-
couraged. I felt that nothing but
misery and an early grave awaited
me. About this time I met and
talked with a nurse of this city
who advised r.-.e to try a good blood
medicine. My husband also
thought I better do so and he pur-
chased a bottle of Hood's Sarsapa-
rilla. I had an attack of erysipelas
and was compelled to 'iave a nurse,
Â»
but I kept on taking Hood's Sarsa-
parilla. After I had taken three
bottles I noticed the trouble with
my heart was less frequent and
less severe and I did not
bloat as badly. My steady per-
sistence in taking Hood's Sarsa-
parilla finally mastered all of my
complaints, which were mostly due
to impure blood. I am now enjoy-
ing the best of health, and for all
this I give Hood's Sarsaparilla the
credit. I wish I could reach my
suffering sisters everywhere and
tell them of this health-giving
remedy. I hope m-" testimonial

Grosvenor of Ohio Ex=
plains the Message
to the House.
Warm Debate, During the Course
of Which the Purpose of
McKinley Is Declared.
Call Office. Riggrs House,
"Washington, April 12.
General Grosvenor of Ohio,
now generally regarded as the
spokesman of the present ad
ministration in the House, late
this afternoon, in reply to an at
tack upon the policy of the Pres
ident, interpreted the recommen
dation In the message to mean a
request for authority to use the
army and navy of the United
States to establish on the island
of Cuba a Government inde
pendent of Spain. It was re
garded as an exceedingly im
portant and significant an
nouncement.
In the brief debate to-day the open-
Ing puns of the contest that begins to
morrow were fired. Broadsides were
exchanged and then the House ad
journed.
The House was In committee of the
whole on the District of Columbia bill
when, shortly before the adjournment, j
Lentz (D.) of Ohio made a vigorous as- j
sault on what he called the "vacillat- j
ing policy" of the President, reading
from various newspapers to show that
the President had repeatedly changed
his mind. He commented especially
upon the report of an alleged midnight
conference between Senator Elkins and
the Spanish Minister, after the former
had been at, the White House with
J.-hn J. MK'ohk. He taunted the Re
publicans because the President had
not declared for the independence of
Cuba, which the Republican platform
had demanded.
"It remains to be seen," said he,
whether the majority of the House can
be lined up and whipped in."
Congress, he declared, should act, and
could act better than the executive,
k "formulating his policy at midnight be
f hind closed doors with the aid of plu
tocracy." He concluded:
â¢\ stable government! What do you pro
' I.vt thl.s Congress give to the
Presideni the army and navy, lie says,
and I will go over there and force the
Cuban patriots, tho Cuban heroes, to sub
mit to a stable government at the hands
of Spain, because the Queen Regent has
Ldy advised the administration that
d a suspension of hostili
ties â  she cannot order a suspension or
tlUties by the insurgents. She has
Lmong all her bull fighters and bul
lies manhood enough to order a suspen
of hostilities on the insurgents. This
administration, with all this vacillating
was criticized by the Cnl
Â» Tribune, an administration paper,
asks us to put the army and navy in its
hands to go over and punish the Cu
bans, after three years of the most he
roic fighting for liberty that any people
ever made on the face of the earth. I
say it is an outrage, it is a stench in
the nostrils of every decent American.
We shall see whether the majority side
of this House can be whipped into such a
policy as that.
Mr. Hepburn (R.) of lowa Jumped to
his feet as Mr. Lentz sat down, and
exclaimed:
Mr. Chairman, sometimes misstate
ment is bo gross that it reaches the dig
of falsehood, and falsehood so gross
that it becomes mendacity, and mendac
ity so foul that it becomes scoundrellsm.
I say that the President has never said
that he desires the use of the army, and
navy at the hands of Congress in order
to establish Spanish supremacy on the
Island of Cub?.. (Appla .
That is not true. There is no man who
can with an nonest heart and with an
l this message of the
President and arrive at any conclusion of
that r. The President's whole
argument leads up to the proposition that
the conduct of Spain in that island during
fifty years of mirrule, fifty years of out
rage, fifty years of tyranny has brought
about such a condition that it is now in
tolerable and insupportable and must
cease. That is the language of the Presi
dent of the United States. He asks the
use of the army and navy to put a stop
to that intolerable and insufferable con
dition. [Applause on the Republican
Bide.] That is the argument of the Presi
dent. Every sentence in that message
âº * to this House teaches that this is tils
purpose, and yet gentlemen say, in view
of all the language he has used, in view
of the argument he has made in reciting
the infamous and despotic con
duct that he has called to our attention,
that it Is the intention of the President
to become the ally of the Spaniards. I
cay that there Is no word in that whole
message that justifies any honorable man
In making a declaration of that kind
upon this floor. We are going there to
fight Spain. We are going there to estab
lish a stable ami permanent government.
What does that mean?
Hero we have had fifty years of Span
ish government, not stable, not perma
nent, except in the villainy of its out
rages. The character of outrage and vil
lainy, which bus become insufferable.
should be suffered no longer, the Presi
dent says, creating such an emergency as
compels us to violate the otherwise
friendly relations that we ought to have
and go to the extreme of war in bringing
an end to these insufferable conditions
produced through the acts of Spain. And
yet the gentleman dares to stand here
ami say that that paper advocates the
use of the army and navy, tho placing of
the whole military power of the country
in the hands of the President, in order
that he may go there to perpetuate that
which lie reprobates and ti ntinue that
whi'-h he says is now unendurable, lie
wants a stable and permanent republican
government. Does that mean Spanish
rule? Has any man the right to make
that argument?
Mr. Lentzâ Does he say republican gov
ernment?
Mr. Hepburnâ No. he does not say. that,
but he supposed that you knew some
thing about the history of this country.
(Applause on Republican side.)
Mr. Lentsâ l do.
Mr. Maguireâ And we know something
about the history of this administration.
Mr. Hepburnâ He supposed that you
knew something about the aspirations of
American statesmen; that you knew
something about the declaration that over
and over again had been reiterated bjr
every branch of this Government with
reference to the character of -overnment
that should be formed on the hemisphere.
(Applause on Republican side.)
â Orosvenor of Ohio took the floor and
T said:
I am going to refer now to only one
thing that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
Lentz) has said on this particular occa
sion, and I do not do It for the purpose
l of elaborating a speech upon this occa
sion. The time is coming when the
gentleman will have i. full opportunity
to assail the President of the United
States, to send their bitterness and their
opposition across the waters to our ene
mies. The gentleman shall have a full
opportunity to abuse his own constitu
ents at home for any conservative ex
pressions which they may have made
through the telegraph or the mail, and he
shall have that opportunity, unaffected
by answers of mine. I wish here s'.mply
to say that the President has asked of
Congress the power to use the army and
the navy for the purpose of establishing
In the island of Cuba an independent
government.
Lentzâ Why did he not say so?
Grosvenorâ Will my friend from Ohio
try for a minute to keep his mouth shut?
Cannonâ Oh, that is impossible. (Ap
plause and laughter on the Republican
side.)
Hanley (D.) of Delawareâ l would like
to know what you understand the Presi
dent to mean by this sentence In his mes
sage: "It involves, however, hostile con
straint upon both the parties to the con
test as well as to enforce a truce to guide
the eventual settlement."
Grosvenorâ You had better go and ask
the President. (Laughter and applause
on the Republican side.)
Galnesâ Don't you think you had better
go and see Hanna? (Derisive Jeers on the
Republican side.)
Grosvenorâ There comes in another ex
hibitlon. (Laughter.) Now, let me re
state my proposition. 1 state that the
President of the United States has asked
for the use of the army and navy to es
tablish on the island of Cuba an inde
pendent government and has said so in
the plainest kind of English language.
(Cries of "Where?" on the Democratic
side.) After a great deal of triDulation
I am going to give the gentlemen on the
other side a demonstration of every state
ment which 1 make. You will ilnd this
language used by the President, and I
will leave it to the most acute analytical
mind on the other side to say if that is
not a proposition to establish on the isl
and of Cuba a government independent
of Spain.
In view of these facts and of these
considerations, I ask Congress to author
ize and empower the President to take
measures to secure a full and final ter
mination between the Government of
Spain and the p&ople of Cuba and to
secure in the island the establishment of
a stable government, capable of main
taining order ana observing its national
obligations.
Now, I ask any gentleman on the other
side to tell me how a government on an
island of any country controlled by a
foreign country, as Cuba is now, can have
a government capable of discharging its :
international obligations? WJiat are inter- |
national obligations? Do colonies have
International obligations?
Did the President understand thatj
there can be a colonial condition in Cuba
by which there would be lnternatfonal
obligations from that Government?
What international act floes Canada do?
What international act has any of the
West India Islands ever done? What rep
representative of this Government goes to
Jamaica, Porto Rico or any island ex
cept those independent? The very lan
guage of the President, as understood by
every intelligent American and man of
thought is that the object and purpose of
using force is to establish a government
with international obligations. So the
whole appeal of the gentleman from Ohio
Is like the picture of a painted ship on a
painted ocean. [Laughter on Republican
side.]
The time is coming very rapidlyâ it will
be here. I trust, to-morrowâ when, under
the guidance of the Committee on For
eign affairs, this House will take action,
and I will suggest to the gentlemen on
the other side that there will be a degree
of patriotism, a degree of unanimity of
purpose, a degree of oneness of action
that will surprise the gentleman when he
looks over the votes that will be taken
here to-morrow. (Great applause on Re
publican side.)
Mr. Bailey, the Democratic leader,
replied to General Grosvenor in a brief
speech, which aroused intense enthu
siasm on the Democratic side. It was
somewhat remarkable, he said, that
the President, in sending to Congress
one of the most important messages
upon one of the most exciting ques
tions which had been before the- coun
try in years, had concluded with a rec
ommendation so ambiguous that it
could be the occasion of controversy.
Other portions of the message showed
that the President was a master of
clear and lucid English, yet in pre
senting his recommendation he had
done so in words that taxed the inge
nuity of the gentleman from Ohio to
make clear what he meant. If the
President meant the freedom and In
dependence of Cuba, why had he not
said so? Mr. Bailey continued:
I do not believe that the President de
liberately veiled his meaning, and in say
ing that I do him more credit thar others
on this floor. I believe if the President
had designed the establishment of a free
and independent republic on the island of
Cuba he would have said so. Why did
he say a stable government? A stable
government and an independent govern
ment are vastly different. No one doubts
that Canada possesses a stable govern
ment, but every intelligent man knows
it is not an independent government. I
do not doubt that Spain could establish
a stable government. It could make a
desert and call it peace.
No one could deny that the President
had asked for authority to send the army
and navy to Cuba to restore peace. When
our forces arrived the Spaniards would
say: "We are at peace; our arms are
stacked; it is the insurgents who are
at war.' Then the agents of the Presi
dent would be compelled, under the au
thority he asks, to say to the insurgents
"Stack your arms; retire to the fields
where you have for three years struggled
with fire and sword to attain your lib
erty."
Mark my words, no President that
sends the army and navy of the United
States to force the patriotic soldiers of
Cuba to lay down their arms will live or
will liis children live, to survive the odium
which the American people will fix upon
him. (Great applause on Democratic side
and in galleries.)
A few minutes later the House ad
journed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 12.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Valu
able information is expected to be giv
en by General Lee to the naval and mil
itary authorities which will have an
Important bearing upon the plan of
campaign against Cuba in the event of
war with Spain.
I learn to-night that General Lee has
been invited to appear before the Naval
Strategic Board at 11 o'clock to-morrow
, morning to discuss with it the defenses
of Havana and other Cuban seaports,
â  the probable location of mines and the
! best points at which attacks should be
' made. All the members of the board
; have been notified to be In attendance,
, so that the information expected to be
I secured may be utilized at once in
changing the plan of naval attack
; which has already been adopted.
This board has been in session for
the past month, and it is understood to
have prepared elaborate plans of of
fense and defense against Spain. But
these plans are liable to change If Con
sul-General Lee should give any infor
mation showing that different points of
attack from those selected by the board
are preferable on account of weak forti
fications or the configuration of the
land.
In some quarters there is a belief that
: one of the reasons why General Lee
! was brought to the Uuited States was
'â â  in order that he might be able to give
, to the war boards of the army and
navy the benefit of his experience and
observation.
By reason of his military training
and experience during the war General
Lee has kept a sharp watch on the im
provements of the fortifications and has
kept the State Department advised
from time to time of what has been go-
Ing on. The reports made by him have
been submitted to the strategic board,
but it is appreciated that he may have
later Information, and in any event the
naval authorities say that his advice
will be valuable, and the board will in
all probability defer in many important
i instances to his judgment.

eral Blanco to-day issued instructions to
the chiefs of various corps of the army
relative to the c 'ict suspending hostili
ties and directing them to cause the
same to be cor-'Tiunicated to the enemy.
Troops will suspend hostilities, main

any offensive movement, but will still
continue to guard convoys. In case the
enemy assumes the offensive they will
attack them vigorously. If the rebels
send in flags of truce they will be re

the enemy to fix conditions which will
provisionally decide the terms of the
suspension of hostilities. The neutral
zone to be agreed uoon shall be of two
kilometers. Everything is to be re
ferred to the general of the division.
Captain-General Blanco will reserve his
definite approbation to the terns

FLED TO EVADE A
MOB AT MATANZAS.
Consul Brice and His Staff and Uheir
Families Arrive at New
York.
NEW YORK, April 12.â The Norwe
gian steamer Herman Wedel 'Jarlsb&r
arrived this afternoon from Matanzas,
bringing thirteen passengers, who fled
from that port to evade the Spanish
mob. The passengers were United
States Consul Brlce and his staff and
their families.
Consul Brice said that for three days
before leaving Matanzas the people
threatened his life and at all times his
property was in danger. His secretary
was obliged to flee for his life, as the
mob threatened to drag him through
the streets. During these three days
the Consul stuck manfully to his post,
distributing supplies to the starving
reconcentrados and relieving their ne
cessities. At 7 p. m. of the Bth inst. he
got notice from Havana to withdraw
from his post. The Jarlsberg "was the
only steamer In port, and Captain
Kjesland agreed to take the Consul and
his party to New York. At 10 o'clock
the party embarked and the steamer
immediately sailed.
The Consul left all his baggage, nnd
none of the party was able to bring
away any personal effects. The Consul
sul says that the condition of the peo
ple is terrible, and that the authorities
are making no efforts to supply their
wants.
SAGASTA THREATENED
BY THE PRETENDER.
Don Carlos Will Hold Aloof Only
While the Honor of Spain
Is Upheld.
LONDON, April 12.â According to a
special dispatch from Venice, Don Car
los, the pretender to the Spanish
throne, has declared his intention to
"hold aloof from hostile manifestations
so long as the Spanish Government up
holds the honor of the nation; other
wise he will take the steps he deems
necessary to support the dignity of the
country." _
Monadnock to Sail.
VALLEJO, April 12.â Orders from
the Secretary of the Navy were re
ceived to-day directing the monitor
Monadnock to proceed to Port Angels,
Washington. Preparations are being
made to sail on Saturday. The moni
tor will not go into drydock before Bail-
Ing, nor will the repairs for which she
came to the navy yard be finished.
MASON'S
VOICE IS
FOR WAR
Senators Show Ijmpa=
tience at the PoliGy of
the President.
Willing to Support the Execu=
tive, but the Cubans Must Be
Made Free.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â For nearly
three hours to-day the Senate had the
Cuban question in its several phases
under discussion. Three resolutions
bearing upon the question were intro
duced, the first by Lindsay of Ken
tucky, directing that the contemplated
operations against the Spanish army In
Cuba be in conjunction with General
Gomez, the supreme command to be
vested In the United States forces, to
the end that the Independence of the
Cubans be restored; the second by Wil
son of Washington, directing the Presi
dent to at once take such steps as will
restore to the Cuban people an Inde
pendent republican form of govern
ment, and the third by Allen of Ne
braska, declaring the existence of war
ln^ Cuba, and directing the President to
take steps to stop it and secure to the
people of the Island stable and inde
pendent government.
Following the introduction of the res
olutions speeches were delivered by
Pettus of Alabama, Mason of Illinois
and Butler of North Carolina. Judge Pet
tus presented an argument that the
Congress could not delegate to the Pres
ident the power to make war, either in
a general or in a special sense, and de
clared that the making of any war
without an express declaration by Con
gress would be a disgrace to the na
tion. Mason said, in substance:
As before announced to you in language
which could not be misunderstood, I am
for war, and have been since the hour our
flag was lowered in Havana harbor and
the lives of our citizens taken by the
Government of Spain. But lam and have
been for this declaration of war only as
a means of securing an honorable peace.
I have no desire to destroy the Spanish
nation, but her flag must be dishonored
by surrendering her sovereignty over
Cuban territory as an atonement for the
lowering of our flag, the sinking of our
ship and the murder of our men. While
I am for war, I realize that I have but
one poor vote in the war-making power of
this Government, and I stand ready In
this hour to uphold the hands of the ex
ecutive and take the best I can get. I
have been indulging in a hope, that
seemed almost a certainty, that the ex
ecutive would recommend intervention
and independence to the Cuban republic.
Intervention by force of arms as recom
mended by the President Is war. To de
clare for Intervention without declaring
directly, openly for war seems to lack
frankness and savors too much of Span
ish diplomacy. If we can have armed in
tervention without recognizing the in
dependence of Cuba and can have nothing
else, I must accept the will of the ma
jority, reservinc to myself the right to
respectfully protest, and also reserving
the right to tight for the independence of
the bravo men, women ajid children in
the island of Cuba.
Mason then went into the history of
what had been done by this country In
the past regarding recognition, and
continued:
Mr. President, It seems almost like in
sulting the intelligence of my colleagues
to call attention to the civil government
existing in Cuba and controlled by the in
surgents when it is known that through
that government they have collected
hundreds of thousands of dollars and
maintained a standing army that has
kept at bay nearly 200,000 armed and
equipped Spanish soldiers and has given
evidence of as great bravery and endur
ance as any army in all the recorded past
The brilliant orator from lowa said the
other day. In the other House, that "hov
ering above the dark waters of that mys
terious harbor of Havana the black
winged vultures watch for the dead, while
over It and over all there is the eagle'Â«<
piercing eye, sternly watching for the
truth."
Mr. President, is It to continue to be an
eagle, or will the avarice and greed of
the nation cause it to descend and par
take of the vulture's food?
Perez, writing to Aranguren, said, "The
Yankees are hogs, and if you conquered
your own independence they will absorb
you." Mr. President, did he tell the
truth?
Mr. President, are we going out on an
errand of mercy loaded down with day
books and journals? Are we to forget
our citizens who went down In the har
bor of Havana, in our greed for gold and
territory? Are we to leave the door open
to compel additional terms from the In
surgents who sacrificed their wives their
children and their homes? Do we' wish
special treaties of commerce and leave
the door open for that? Do we wish to
relieve some American in%-estors who
have bought Spanish bonds and who wish
to trade them lor the bonds of the re
public? Do we, worse still, wish to leave
the door op^n to compel those brave men
and women to accept some terms of au
tonomy or to pay blood money to the
Spaniards or the Shylocks of our own
land?
May I be forgiven if I express the hope
that the heart of the executive may be
touched in their behalf? May we not
hope that their last lingering look of life
be not with suspicion and hatred upon
our flag; that It may not rest upon that
color of tue yellow iiag of Spain, but that
in their rapt and parting moments they
may be soothed and sustained by the
sight of their own flag, the flag with a
single starâ the flag of the republic of
Cuba?
Mr. Butler of North Carolina fol
lowed Mr. Mason. He said that he be
longed to what was popularly termed
the opposition on the floor of the Sen
ate, but he maintained that this oppo
sition had thus far upheld the hands of
the administration as loyally as had
the best friends of the President, and
were ready to do so as long as they
can preserve their self-respect. Mr.
Butler expressed the hope that the
Foreigrn Relations Committee would be
able to bring in a resolution that the
Senate might adopt unanimously, as it
voted for the $50,000,000 emergency ap
propriation. In the present circum
stances we would be justified in driv
ing every Spanish vessel from the seas
and in laying waste ever- city and
town of Spain. This because of the
destruction of the Maine â one of the
foulest crimes in history. He main
tained that the. United States had even
more exalted reasons for the establish
ment of Cuban independenceâ the rea
sons of humanity and liberty, and
said:
I am for avenging the Maine, and would
be if Cuba did not enter Into the matter.
I would secure atonement from Spain for
the destruction of the Maine and so many
of her gallant crew, not by conquest, not
by Indemnity, for we cannot make mer
chandise out of the bones of our dead;
but let us say to Spain that we will es
tablish a Cuban republic as a monument
to our dead of the Maine. If Spain will
not accede to this let us make good the
proposition with our army and navy.
Mr. Butler regretted that the Presi
dent did not tell Congress what he
meantâ just what he wanted. He dis
agreed with the President concerning
the recognition of the Cuban republic,
maintaining that to stop the war on
the island without granting the inde
pendence of the Cuban republic sim
ply meant the crushing of the Cuban
patriots, and he asked:
Why did General Lee hurry to Wash
ington? We were informed that he would
have to get out of Havana before the
President's message was read. Yet here
comes a message that causes the Span
iards to build bonfires and rejoice, and
starts the stock tickers to clicking mer
rily and causes smiles to spread over the
countenances of Wall street gamblers.
Within a few hours, I hope, we will be
called upon to vote upon a definite prop
osition. The last one I voted for with
pleasure. I voted for the $50,000,000 emer
gency appropriation. I am ready to vote
for $50,000,000 or for $200,000,000 to avenge
the Maine and to free Cuba, but I'll not
vote to expend a dollar for any doubtful
policy, and I'll not vote for any scheme
to protect Cuban bondholders as against
humanity and freedom and Independence.
At 3:55 the Senate went Into execu
tive session, and at 4:45 adjourned.
ELECTION RIOTS IN
PORTO RICO TOWNS.
Press Censor Prevents Correspond
ents From Sending News to
This Country.
Copyrighted, 1808. by James Gordon Bennett.
ST. THOMAS, April 12. â Advices
from Porto Rico are to the effect that
the populace is still excited over the
elections, which resulted in a Liberal
majority of twenty-five. On Tuesday
the Governor issued a proclamation
against disorder. Four newspapers
charge fraud in the elections. One hun
dred and fifty persons throughout the
Island have been arrested. Three per
sons were killed and twenty-six wound
ed in riots In Cayey and elsewhere.
Â£enor Ramos has gone to Spain to rep
resent the Liberal cause In the Cortes.
The people are aggravated by the prob
ability of rebellion. If military author
ity was restricted and more scape given
to autonomy internal peace would be
assured.
The censor at Porto Rico stops all
news over the wires and the Herald cor
ened with expulsion,
respondent in San Juan has been threat
ened with expulsion. I was notified
on Saturday that he had been placed
incommunicado for sending news to the
Herald. Consul Hanna was not allowed
to interfere in any way in his behalf.
The Captain-General is favorably dis
posed, but informs me through the Brit
ish Consul here that he is powerless
under the military government.
STRICKEN WITH TOTAL
BLINDNESS WHILE ASLEEP.
Trinity County Woman Retires in
Good Health and Awaaens
Bereft of Sight.
REDDING, April 12.â Mrs. Erwlna Busk,
a married woman of family, residing
In French Gulch, Trinity County, was
stricken with total blindness last night
while asleep. The awful afiliction came
upon her without warning and the light
passed out of her life before she was
able to realize her great misfortune.
Mrs. Busk has enjoyed good health.
Last night she retired at the usual hour.
She was awakened during the night by
an aching sensation in her eyes. She did
not realize the meaning of her discomfort
until the morning had dawned, and she
slowly awakened to the awful helpless
ness of her condition.

The Eminent Physician and Specialist Who Has Discovered
How To Tell If We Have Kidney,
Bladder or Uric Acid Trouble.
HOW TO FIND RELIEF AND CURE QUICKLY.
You May Have a Sample Bottle Sent Free by Mail.
There comes a time to both men and
women when sickness and poor health
bring anxiety and trouble hard to bear;
disappointment seems to follow every
effort in our behalf; we get discouraged
and skeptical. In most cases s.rious
mistakes are made in our treatment,
and in not knowing what the disease is
or what makes us sick.
If a peculiar pain attacks you, try to
locate its origin and discover which or-
gan of the body is sick and in need of
attention.
If the kidneys are at faultâ and In
almost every case in the failing of our
health they are â look well to their res-
toration to health .and strength.
They are the great filters of our body,
and consequently, the. purity of the
blood is entirely dependent on their
cleansing powers.
If the kidneys are not in a perfectly
clean and healthy condition, the blood
becomes impregnated with impurities
and a decay of the kidneys soon takes
place. If your desire to relieve your-
self of water increases, and you find it
necessary to arise many times during
sleeping hours, your kidneys are sick.
As they reach a more unhealthy stage,
a scalding and irritation takes place as
the water flows, and pain or dull ache
in the back makes you miserable. If
the water, when allowed to remain un-
disturbed for twenty-four hours, forms
a settling or sediment, you are in the
grasp of most serious kidney or blad-
der dis' "er.
If neglected now the disease advances
until the face looks pale or sallow,

THE POPE'S
EFFORT TO
MAKE PEACE
Some Interesting Corre
spondence Made Public
by a Roman Paper.
It Is Evident From the Nature of
the Documents That the
Publication Is by Au
thority.
ROME, April 12.â The Osservatore
Romano, organ of the Vatican, pub
lished to-day the text of the documents
bearing upon the Pope's mediation in
the Cuban crisis. They are prefaced
by a note saying the Pontiff, "seeing
the imminent danger of war between
Spain and the United States, inter
posed his action with the greatest so
licitude and entire efficacy in order to
avert it and smooth over the obsta
cles."
There follows a note, dated April 9,
sent by the Spanish Minister of For
eign Affairs, Senor Gullon, to Mgr.
Merry del Val, the papal chamberlain,
requesting him to inform the papal
secretary of state, Cardinal Rampolla,
co that the latter might communicate
It to the Pope, that the Spanish Gov
ernment, "in consequence of the ar
dent, noble and repeated urgings of the
Pope," had decided to order Captain-
General Blanco to "concede immedi
ately a suspension of hostilities for the
period which his prudence may deem
fit. with the view to prepare for and
facilitate peace."
Continuing, the note reads: "Whil^
I have the pleasure of thus satisfying
the wishes of the Reverend Pontiff.it is
also agreeable to me to communicate
to your Excellency that the Embassa
dors of the six great powers, in a col
lective visit to me this morning, found
their aspirations in harmony with
those of the Pope, to whom, on this oc
casion, we recall our previous dispatch.
With confidence that he will watch
with care, so that our corresponding
Just demand may be satisfied and that
the prestige of this Catholic nation may
not be destroyed."
The paper dcres not publish the pre
vious dispatch mentioned above.
A third document is a dispatch from
Cardinal Rampolla to the Papal Nun
do at Madrid, in which the latter Js In
structed to communicate to the Spanish
Government the satisfaction experi
enced by the Pope at the Immediate

Pontiff considered "very expedient In

The Osserv;.tore Romano concludes
the publication of its series of docu

ton, dated April H, the source of
â \ hlch is not indicated, saying:
"The suspension of hostilities has
produced an excellent impression. I
have no doubt of the mciintenance of
peace. We shall have bellicose speeches
in Congress, but without results. The
influence of the Pope in obtaining the
armistice is fully recognized by the
American people and is hailed with
gratitude."
LONDON*, April 13.â The Rome cor
respondent of the Daily Chronicle says:
"At the Vatican the President's mes
sage is regarded as pacific. Archbishop
Martinelli cabled from Washington this
morning (Tuesday) that the armistice
had produced an cxc lent effect in the
United States and the situation would
end in warlike speeches in Congress,
which would nt lead to action.
"At the Italian Foreign Office, the sit
uation is regarded less favorably. It
is recognized that the message is mod
erate, but not absolutely pacific, and it
is feared that the insurgents will re
ject the armistice."
The Vienna i.orrespodent of the Daily
Chronicle says: The Cabinet has com

SPAIN CRIES
OUT FOR WAR
Even Statesmen Do Not
Approve the Message
of the President-
Affect to Be Confident That
It Will Lead to
Peace.
There Is an Undercurrent of Opinion
That the Situation Has
Grown Graver.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, April 12.â The Republican
and revolutionary El Pals prints the
following headlines on its front page:
"The solution of the conflict is a
national U-overnment, a military dic
tatorship and a war with the United
States."
Its leading editorial announces that
the conductors of the paper, "putting
party politics to-day into the back
ground and thinking only of the father
land, urge the formation of a national
Government composed of Republicans,
Liberals and absolute monarchists."
The editorial denounces the Govern
ment for "meeting patriotic cries with
sword cuts," and appeals to the people
and the army to "save Spain from trai
tors."
While the message of the President la
much criticized by the general public,
and by a portion of the press as provo
cative, it is known that the members
of the Government and General Wood
ford do not consider it so, but are con
fident of a permanent peace.
The Government has greatly strength
ened its position by the manner in
which it restored order after yester
day's events. To-day tt u <Â» city of Mad
rid wears its usual aspect.
The Ministers have been in Cabinet
session to examine the cabled digest of
the message, all reserving their opin
ions, except Senor Moret, who has de
clares that the document does not shut
the door on their hopes for peace.
The Bourse received the message
badly. Senor Silvela, the leader of the
dissident Conservatives, characterizes
it as grave.
Diplomatic circles generally maintain
discretion, confining themselves to
statements that the powers wiii pre
serve peace.
Senor Sagasta, the Prem.er, on leav
ing the palaca after his daily visit to
the Queen Regent, informed the news
paper representatives that the Govern
ment was awaiting for the full text of
President McKinley's message before
acting on its contents. He said also
that he considered the message, so far
as it was known to him, not hostile in
tone toward Spain and that he would
continue desirous of peace, for obtain
ing which the armistice in Cuba afford
ed the meai i.
LONDON, April 13.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail, tele
graphing at 7:30 Tuesday evening,
says:
"The message has produced a very
deep and bitter impression. Many
friends of the cabinet share the senti
ments of general discontent. I am as
sured on grood authority that Senor Sa
gasta is very much disgusted with tho
message, seeing the difficulties ahead
as a consequence of it.
"The comment in political circles is
very heated. Many people believe the
Government ought to show greater en
ergy. Senor Moret is said to have
expressed the opinion that the message
is 'not so bad as I had anticipated.'
"The influential press is rather re
served in its comments, but the im
pression which this message has made
upon the people at large is very un
favorable. They, however, appreciate
the gravity of the situation.
"Notwithstanding the rumors that
the Carlists have been fomenting the
war feeling this is not so.
"The ringleaders in the recent dis
turbances will be proceeded against in
the ordinal tribunal."
El Correo, the official organ, -will to
night give its first impressions since the
reception of the cabled abstracts of |
President McKinley's message. It will
say: President McKinley's insistence
on the right of American interference
in Cuba is little agreeable to Spain,
while his complaints against the pro
longation of the war appear steeped
In bitter Irony."

CHrCAGO. April 12. â The executive
committee of the Western Passenger As
sociation met to-day to consider the com
missions that are being paid in various
parts of the association territory and in
particular commissions on Northern Pa

in some cases excessive commissions had

decided, therefore, that the large com

they have been in effect, and a resolution
to this effect will be presented at the gen

GREAT BALL OF FIRE
FROM THE HEAVENS
STRIKES NEAR KENNETT
Meteor Passing From East to West Lands on
the Mountains With a Loud Ex
plosion.
REDDING, Cal., April 12.â At 8 o'clock Sunday evening a great ball
of fire shot out of the east, back of the high lime rocks at Baird, and,
passing with terrific velocity to the west, over the Pit and Sacra
mento rivers, exploded with a heavy detonation on the mountains near
Kennett. The duration of the heavenly missile's flight was about ten
seconds. It brightly illuminated the heavens, and for a few seconds
trees cast their shadows as in the glare of sunshine. When the shoot
ing star burst into scintillant fragments a sound as of hissing steam
quickly followed the sullen roar and rumble of the crash.
R. H. Rosemann and Joseph Jaegal, who are operating a copper
mine on the headwaters of the Stillwater, near Pit River, were sit
ting in front of their cabin when the fiery visitor passed across the
heavens. In speaking of the marvelous sight Mr. Rosemann said:
"There was a sudden illumination and a large, fiery ball made its
appearance above the high lime rocks, shooting at a terribly rapid
pace in a westerly direction, crossing the Pit and Sacramento rivers
and exploding somewhere north of Kennett. I believe it was a me
teor, its night lasting about ten seconds. It exploded with a heavy
report and there was a prolonged sound like escaping steam. It was
an imposing and beautiful spectacle, such as I never saw before. Mr.
Huwaldt, living a mile south of me, heard the detonation, but lost
sight of the meteor."
TOWN WITHOUT
REAL ESTATE
No Resident of Needles
Owns the Land He
Occupies.
The Title to the Site of the
Desert, Metropolis Is in
Doubt.
Citizens Wish to Havo a Test Suit
Hurried Through the
Courts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, April 12.â San
Bernardino County contains a town of
1000 inhabitants in which there are no
property-owners. This seema a strange
state of affairs, but it is nevertheless
the true condition of Needles. Not a
single individual owns the ground on
which his place of business or his
dwelling .stands, and upon the county
assessment book appears no record of
anything but personal property at the
1 desert metropolis.
The resaon for this unparalleled
state of affairs is that the land upon
which Needles is located was with
drawn from entry by the General Land
Office, being what is known as a rail
road section, and is claimed as station
grounds by the Santa Fe Pacific, the
successors of the Atlantic and Pacific
and Southern Pacific railroads, as a
part of a land grant from Congress.
The residents claimed that the railroad
failed to comply with certain regula
tions laid down by Congress, and the
Secretary of the Interior authorized
the institution of suits for the fc-rfeit
< ures of this track, along with other
lands.
A suit entitled the people of the Unit
: ed States vs. C. W. Smith, receiver of
j the Atlantic and Pacific, et al., was
i commenced in the United States Cir-
I cuit Court for the southern district of
California to quiet title of the Govern
j ment to this land, but for some reason
lit was dropped. The people of Needles
i have now unanimously requested that
the case be taken up. A resolution has
been passed by the Board of Supervi
sors requesting the Federal authorities
! to act, and the inhabitants of Needles
; will not rest until the affair is defi
i nitely settled.
The progress of the town has been
gTeatly retarded by this unusual con-
I dition, and the railroad company now
appears as anxious as any private citi
zen to see the question settled and title
to the land given. The place is a divi
sion point, and has many enterprises of
note. Owing to its fundamental defect
it has never been able to organize a
municipal government. Town improve
ments, except by individuals, have
been an impossibility, and people have
been careful about Large investments of
capital.
TOD SLOAN PRAISES
CALIFORNIA RACING.
Pleased With His Success on the
Pigskin at the Local
Tracks.
NEW YORK, April 12.â Tod Sloan, who
has returned from San Francisco, speak
ing of his work on the coast said:
"The racing was excellent, and I am
more than pleased with the showing I
made out there. I rode better than ever
before in my life. I learned more about
riding this winter, too, than 1 ever
thought I knew before. I attribute a
good deal of this to my short experience
in England, riding, as I did. against tlu>
best jockeys In the old country. I rode
with a longer stirrup, but still kept the
same position in the saddle that I have
always done. I think a long stirrup en
ables 1 me to finish much stronger. If it
is not that I don't know how to account
for my improved riding, for I know I
finish stronger now than I formerly did.
"Prospects look bright for a good racing
season in the Eaat. Our horses (the
Messrs. Fleichmann's) are all in great
shape, but not likely to run any
where before the Morris Park meeting
opens. Consequently I don't expect to be
in the saddle at either Bennlnga or
Aqueduct.
"I shall probably go to England in Feb
ruary next year and may ride there all
season."

GOLD STRIKE
News Reaches Seattle of
Bonanza Finds by
Prospectors.
From 23 to 30 Cents a Pan
Considered a Low
Average.
First of the Season's Argonauts Are
Reaping a Golden Harvest
in Alaska.
Special Dlsnatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 12.â The steamship
Excelsior arrived in port to-day from
Port Valdes and Frioce William Sound.
She brings a report of the first gold
discovery made this year by argonauts
who are exploring the Copper River
fields. A number of prospectors have
located on the Bremner River, the sec
ond important branch on the east bank
of the Copper River. One who had
just returned to Orca brought the story
of the discovery of important diggings.
He claims that to get 25 or 50 cents to
the pan was considered low, as many
claims were running as high as $1 to
the pan. This was taken out near the
surface, as no holes had been sunk to
bedrock. The report created consider
able excitement at Orca and Copper
River and a number were preparing to
go to the new fields.
At present Bremner River can be
reached over an Indian trail from
Eyak. Considerable of the distance is
over the ice and through Baird Can
yon, which is a barrier to navigation
from the mouth. After the ice breaks
up Bremner River can be reached only
by crossing the Valdes Glacier and
coming down the Copper River in
boats.
An unfortunate prospector met a
| terrible death on March 30 In an icy
crevasse of the Valdes Glacier. With a
i party of friends from the East he had
j made good progress across the glacier
and had worked to the fourth bench
near the summit. He slipped into one
j of the dangerous cracks that are be
| g i nmn & to appear on the glacier and
efforts to stop himself were unavailing
I His cries were heard and the longest
rope available was lowered, but it did
not reach him. About two hours after
the accident he gave one last, feeble
cry. The body was not recovered The
men who brought the news into Cop-
I per City the night before the Excelsior
â  sailed had not learned the name of the
I unfortunate man.
The steamship Alliance reached here
late to-night from Port Valdes On
board was Chris Webber, the man
whom officers of the Excelsior believed
had jumped overboard from their ves
sel on the down trip. It is explained
that Webber purchased his ticket, had
all his personal effects on the Excelsior
and intended to return as a passenger
but she sailed without him, althou-h
the steward insisted that he had gotten
aboard and when he was found missing
it was proclaimed that he had jumped
overboard. Webber was the inventor
of a steam sled which proved a failure
in the north.
â¦v P " ku- F Â°' ey Â£ f Arkans as returned on
the Alliance. He reports that the Lev
party and others from California have
made the trin over the glacier and are
now camping in the timber on the other
side He also brings the report that a
gold strike has been made at the lake
across the glacier, from which the pros
pectors are taking out from fifty cents
ot seventy-five cents a pan.

FLAMES AIDED
BY THE WIND
Heavy Loss of Property
in South San
Jacinto.
Ten Buildings Destroyed, In
cluding the Large County
Hospital.
Firemen Powerless to Check the
Blazs Because of a Heavy
Gale.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JACINTO, April 12.â Fire broke
out this morning in a small frame
house in South San Jacinto, occupied
by James Wilkinson and family. All
morning the wind had been blowing as
It had not blown before in years. The
heavy gale fanned the blaze to such
an extent that four other cottages were
soon in flames. The lack of water
made it impossible to even check the
fire. After consuming five frame cot
tages the flames crossed the street or.
the south side, burning to the ground
a two-story brick building belonging to
H. T. Hewitt, which had been erected
a few years ago at a cost of $2400. Next
to go were two small buildings ad
joining the brick one on the south.
From there flying embers were hurled
to the McDermott blacksmith shop,
which was soon reduced to ashes.
In the meantime the flremen were do
ing everything possible to save the
County Hospital on the opposite side
of the street, but the lack of water was
again in evidence, and the big two
story brick building was soon ablaze.
The hospital building was built dur
ing the boom by H. T. Hewitt at a cost
of $47,000, and was used as a hotel. It
was well known all over the State as
the Palma Hotel. Two years ago it
was purchased by the county for a hos
pital. At the time of the fire there
were thirty-two patients in the build
ing, all of whom were taken out In
time. Nearly all the furniture was
saved from the hospital building, but
none from the frame cottages. The
hospital was insured fur $10,000, but
there was very little insurance on any
of the other property burned.
Hard work, wet blankets and salt
saved the two-story brick residence of
J. C. Jordan, which stood within 100
feet of the burning buildings.
The Board of Supervisors will in all
probability order the hospital building
rebuilt at its next meeting on the first
of the month. The hospital patients
are all comfortably housed in the sec
ond story of the Long block.
EXPLOSION OF POWDER
DURING A CONFLAGRATION.
Large Chinese Store Building in
Trinity County Blown to
Atoms.
REDDING, April 12.â The one-story
frame building of the Quong Sing Com
pany, one of the largest Chinese merchant
concerns in Northern California, was
burned in Eastman's Gulch, near Lewis
ton, Trinity County, at 1 o'clock this
morning. There were four Celestials
sleeping in the store. When the fire awak
ened them they turned their attention to
saving what icw valuable articles they
could. Then, In uespair, they Middled
together like Si.eep as close tj the blazing
ruins as the intense heat would permit
and watched the progress of the flames.
A lot of powder stored in the premises
was evidently forgotten, for in a moment
there was a terrific explosion, which
lifted the burning debris into the air and
scattered It in all directions for hundreds
of feet. Tiie clothing of the ' ' ..nese was
lighted, and they ran around yelling like
maniacs, completely panic-stricken. All
of them were powder-burned and bruised,
and one Celestial was struck on the face
' y a piece of debris and so seriously in
jured that he is now probably dead, as
he was not expected to live when word
reached Redding of the disaster. The
extent of the loss is not known, and
there was probably no insurance.
The same company's store in Saasta
was destroyed by fire a short time ago,
entailing a loss of many thousands of
dollars, without a cent's insurance.
VENTURA CONFLAGRATION.

I brings news of a collision b^uveen two
of the liners engaged in the Alaskan
service. The steamship Islander and
the steamship Willamette ran afoul of
! each other and both were damaged, to
what extent was not learned when tha
Topeka sailed.
The collision occurred in the harbor
at Juneau. The steamship Y'illimetta
I was running alongside the wharf when
her machinery became, inn yh soma
! cause, uncontrollable, md she ran at
1 full speed into the Islander, cutting a
big hole in the side of that vessel. As.l
far as can be learned no one was in- â¢
IJured.1 Jured.
Since leaving port the Islander has
had a series of accidents. On her way
north she ran ashore on Mary Island
and tore off one of her screws. She
proceeded north under the one propeller
i and after an eventful voyage arrived
1 safely at Skaguay. She had scarcely
' got started on her way south when an
other accident occurred, as a result of
which she lost three blades from her
other propeller. Then soon afterward
1 she encountered the Willamette.
When the Topeka left Juneau the Is
i lander had been beached on Douglas Is
| land in order that she could be patch-
I ed up sufficiently to allow her to con
i tinue her voyage to the nearest port
! where permanent repairs can be made.
The steamship Willamette was stand
ing by, also making preparations to gÂ«
i on the beach.

tion was awarded to the firm of Erickson
Bros, and the western section waa secured
by Buckman & Kelso. The time allowed
for the completion of the work is until
September, 1899, and the amount of the
bonds required $50,000 Jn each case. The
reason for the rather extended length of
time allowed in the contracts is that it
will be necessary to cut three Bmall tun
nels on the work, one on the eastern sec
tion and two on the western. There were
six bids for the work, but as the terms of
the firms that will do the work were the
most satisfactory they succeeded in se
curing the prize.
The approaches to the big Franklyn
tunnel have all been completed, and it is
thought that the work on the tunnel
itself will commence next week.
The road to Kern River has been
finished, and while the work of building
the great steel bridge over the river goes
.steadily on, the grading on the other side
has commenced and preparations are be
ing made to start building the link from
Visalia to the other line. The connection
between the two lines will be made at a
point just east of Tulare Lake known as
Waukena Junction.

The British Bark Willstott
Arrives Here in Dis

The British bark W< lstott, sixty
eight days from Haioto, was spoken by
the steamer Arcata ten miles west
southwest of Doxbury Reef yesterday.
The bark had evidently seen some
rough weather, as she was dismasted
and beating into this port under a jury
rig. The vessel was bound for Puget
Sound and her cargo was consigned to
Balfour, Guthrie & Co.
The tug Reliance was sent out at a
late hour to tow her into port.
LOVE DROVE
TO SUICIDE
Maggie O'Donnell Kills Herself
After Quarreling With
William Lyons.
A quarrel with her sweetheart at a
saloon on the corner of Howard and
Fourth streets yesterday afternoon drove
Maggie O'Donnell to take her life with
carbolic acid shortly after her lover had
left her as a result of a misunderstand
ing between the two.
About 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
girl entered the saloon with a man named
William Lyons. They went to a wine
room in the rear of the place, and were
there some time, when Lyons came out
alone. Soon afterward people in the sa
loon heard a body fall to the floor, and
hurrying back to the wineroom found
the girl lying on the floor in an uncon
scious condition. Aid was summoned
from a drugstore near by and a doctor
was sent from the Receiving Hospital,
but the girl was dead before the physi
cian arrived. The Coroner's office was
notified and the body was taken to the
Morgue.
The mother of the girl lives at Cleve
land and Seventh streets, and when in
formed of her daughter's death went to
the Coroner's office to see her child. She
was prostrated with grief, and her wail
ings over the loss of her daughter were
heartrending.
Young Lyons was formerly an employe
of the Southern Pacific, but lost his posi
tion some time ago. He and me girl had
been keeping company for over a year,
but owing to the objections of the girl's
parents the love affair had been broken
off for a couple of months last year, in
December the objections of the parents
were overcome, and the two young people
began to keep company again. They had
frequent quarrels, and the one of yester
day was only one of many which had
troubled the girl for a long while. Just
what the Immediate cause of the trouble
was is not known.
The Coroner had a great deal of trouble
in securing information in regard to the
suicide. The proprietor of the saloon, A.
J. Smith, was under the influence of
liquor, and refused to answer any ques
tions asked him in regard to the matter.
He also closed the mouths of his bar
keepers by commanding them not to talk,
so exactly what took place in the saloon
is not known.

WALKER'S PERILOUS MARCH.
FIFTH MATE CHARLES WALKER of the ice-bound steam whaler
Orca, fast in the ice at Point Barrow has just completed a marvelous march
to civilization through thousands of miles of enow and ice. He took the
Mackenzie River route for Winnipeg at the 6ame time that Third Mate
George Tilton of the Belvedere started by way of St. Michaels. Though his
Journey was not quite so perilous as that of Tilton its completion was a
marvelous achievement of skill and endurance in battling blizzards for fiva
months, marching through Arctic wilds by the aid of dog sleds and two In
dian guides.

Some Few Fair-Sized. Sales Are Car
ried. Through â The Records, Auc
tions and. Random Notes.
The war excitement continues to
have its effect on the realty market
Sales are scattering and generally for
Email amounts. Hardly a week passes,
however, that some large transaction
does not mark an oasis along the dull
line of march. Two or three of some
magnitude will be mentioned else
where in this column.
The San Martin rancho, in Santa
Clara County, lying generally between
San Jose and Gilroy, and consisting of
numerous parcels making a whole of
2480.7 acres, has been bought in at
foreclosure sale, held in Easton, El
dridge & Co.'s offices, by the San Fran
cisco Savings Union for $158,000. The
land was originally bought from Dan
iel Murphy by C. H. Phillips. It is
mostly good fruit land. E. B. Pond
and H. C. Campbell, as trustees of the
San Francisco Savings Union, held the
property in trust on a loan, the inter
est and principal of which had amount
ed to $160,100. After the legal notice
was read, an hour being consumed in
the laborious technicality, the land
was offered in parcels. Outside com
petition was had on two parcels, which
sold respectively for $700 and $1400. The
rest was bought in in a lump by the
Savings Union trustees for $158,000. A
number of parcels have already been
disposed of by Phillips under contracts
of sale, and where balances are due
they will go to the Savings Union.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
During the week there were 64 mort
gages and trust deeds recorded, amount
ing to $188,300. For the same period 48 re
leases and reconveyances passed to rec
ord in the total sum of $254,655. VThe
principal mortgages and trust deeds were
as follows:

FOUR WOMEN EVICTED.
Under circumstances painfully embarrassing ten deputies from the
Sheriff's office evicted four women, two of whom were sick, from their
home at 3928 Seventeenth street yesterday. The evicted were Mrs. Mary
Elizabeth Mathai and her daughters Lulu, Rose and Julia, the latter
an invalid for many years. The mother is sixty-eight years of age and
for months has not been out of the house but twice.
The circumstances under which the roof was taken from over the
heads of these women are peculiar and pathetic. At least it proved so
to the deputies who carried the household effects out upon the street
while the two sick women screamed and passed from one convulsion
to another as they saw the operation of the arm of the law. It was not
for rent due. They lost their home In which they had lived for eight
years by the foreclosure of a mortgage held by the Hibernia Savings
and Loan Society.
Six years ago the eldest daughter, Rose, so the old mother says,
caused her to place a mortgage on the house in favor of the bank for
$5800, and, as the women say, the interest on the money has been paid
with promptness. A little over a year ago an action to foreclose the lien
on the property was begun, and although several lawyers were em
ployed to defend the action Judgment was had by default, and the
younger women were warned to move as the bank had bought the property
at the Sheriff's sale. Twice were extensions of time granted and
elapsed, but still the occupants refused to leave. At last the aid of the
Sheriff was invoked, and yesterday an order of eviction was executed.
It was not until the Sheriff's men appeared at the door that the old
woman knew that there had been either suit, sale or order to leave.
Then she broke down and her cries of distress could be heard all over
the block The Invalid daughter, Julia, became equally distressed, and
after shrieking to the top of her voice for a few minutes she went from
one convulsion to another until prostrated. At last a kind-hearted
neighbor took compassion upon the lick women and had them taken to
her home near by. Bureaus, beds, tables, trunks, chairs, pictures, a
piano and articles of household goods and bric-a-brac, the accumula
tions of many years, were piled out upon the street by the officers. The
women seemed demoralized and refused to take any advice as to the
storing of their goods until such a time as they could move to Napa,
where they say they own a large tract of land and a valuable magnesia
mine worth thousands of dollars.
They tell a strange Btory to the effect that they own 640 acres of
timber and grazing lands in Tehama County, besides large realty in
Napa and twenty-two lots on the Corbett road. Some of this land they
say they would sell, but are unable to get anything for it. According to
the women's story their father and mother have not lived together for
a long time. The father is J. C. S. Mathai, and he and their brother are
now living in Napa.
Late last evening the household goods were moved away for storage,
and the homeless women were given shelter by friends.

Strikers Are Quiet.
There was little or no perceptible
cliangc in the condition of the striking
printers yesterday, unless perhaps the
prevalence of a number of wild rumors
from employers that men were going
back, and from printers that the Typo
thetae were on the point of acceeding to
their demands, but none of these could
be authenticated. The printers deny that
tney have been boycofting, but say that
boycotting has been started on the oth-r
side. The manager of a firm of elecrro
tvperc, who has acceeded to the nine-hour
soa'o, says that members of the Typo
thetae have informed him that he will
get no more of their work unless he starts
in to fight the union. Many of the
strikers who were entitled to benefits
have declined to draw on them as yet,
preferring to have the amount credited to
them as dues and thus keep it in the
treasury. The shops are all running, bat
few if any have on a full force of men
and the proprietors still have hopes of
getting their old hands back, either by a
direct withdrawal from the union or
through a compromise, but the men seem
firm and say they will only go back when
their demands are acceded to.
Honor to a Teacher's Hemory.
On Friday the flag over the Columbia
Grammar School of fiis city will fly at
half-mast, and exercises In memory of
Miss Sarah Donnelly, who taught there
for seven years, and who was one of the
most esteemed of its teachers, will be
held. Miss Donnelly died on March 26,
after a short illness. She was beloved
by teachers and children alike, and so
Friday next has been set as a time when
both can do honor to her memory. There
will be remarks by various members of
the School Department and by teachers
of the school and Its principal, Mrs. L. R.
Burke, and Miss Donnelly's class will
sing the last song she taught it. The ex
ercises will commence at 4 o'clock and
will be open to all Miss Donnelly's
friends.

A FAIR FIGHT
AND NO FAVOR
Jeffries and Sharkey Signed to
Abide by the Referee's
Decision.
Alexander GreggaLns Selected to Fill
â¢ by No Means Easy-
Position.
The Sharkey and Jeffries twenty
round boxing contest on the evening of
May 6 is now a settled fact, barring
unforeseen events.
Last evening Billy Delaney, director
general of Jeffries' affairs pugilistic,
met Tom McDonald, the spokesman for
Tom Sharkey, and also the directors of
the National Athletic Club, at the Bald
win Hotel, and articles were drawn up
and signed by the representatives of the
pugilists and the club.
They were of the same purport as was
stated in yesterday's Call, excepting
that the representatives of the pugil
ists, on behalf of Referee Greggains,
had included in the agreement the fol
lowing section, viz. :
"That when ordered to break from a
clinch the contestants must obey the
command of the referee, and that the
contestant who persists in holding his
opponent after being duly cautioned by
the referee will stand a risk of having
the match declared against him.
Either man can hit his opponent when
both arms are free."
The Queensberry rules, under which
the men will fight, state that a con
testant must be considered down when
he has one knee on the floor or when
he is hanging helpless on the ropes.
The articles also state that the fight
ers or their representatives and the
club must deposit on April 23 the sum
of $1000 each as guarantees of good
faith and that in the event of any in
terference the referee must declare the
match in favor of the contestant who
has had in his judgment the oetter of
the game up to that juncture.
It was further agreed that the pugil
ists may use bandages on their hands
if they so desire. The Queensberry
rules will be published in the official
programme so that the spectators may
fully understand what is meant by foul
fighting. i
Billy Delaney remarked after the ar
ticles had been signed and the con
course of interested spectators had
dispersed that Jeffries had made up
his mind to put up a fair fight from
start to finish and that if Sharkey, by
an oversight or a display of poor judg
ment, should transgress the rules he
(Sharkey) would find his opponent
ready to play any kind of a game
known to "the profession. '
Sharkey, however, is fully aware of
the fact that the sporting people of this
city do not favor any kind of pugilism
where rough tactics are employed by
a pugilist in the hope thereby of win
ning a quick victory, consequently he
has trained and is now being coached
by Stelzner and Baker with the object
in view of making a clean stand-off
fight and obeying the commands of the
referee.
Sharkey will remain in Vallejo until
ten days before the day selected for
th > battle, when he will return to this
city and complete his training at a
training station near the Cliff House.
Jeffries has recently returned from
a short vacation, and will be looked af
ter by Delaney until called upon to
give an account of himself. His train
ing quarters are the Reliance Athletic
Club, Oakland.
Delane would not say much con
cerning the Jeffries and Mexican Pete
fight, which is to take place at the
Olympic Club on the evening of the 22d
inst.. but a happy smile answered the
question. "Do you think Jeff has a
chance of winning the contest, Billy?"
Jim Carr, the manager of Pete, said
last evenina: that Jeffries may have a
harder game to dispose of Mexican
Pete than he (Jeffries) imagines, but
odds of 3 to " are being offered that
Jeffries will put Pete to sleep before
te:. rounds are finished.
Alexander Greggains l ill start to
| train to-day for his job, which he ex
! pects will prove to be pretty touph. He
will also telegraph Billy Woods for the
loan of the face armor which woods
used when sparring with Jim Corbett
in Carson.
"I am well acquainted with some of
the high-; uck-a-mucks of China*
town," said Greprgains, "and I havn
every reason to believe that I can pnsÂ«
ily borrow chain-armor which will pro*
tect my body in case wild blows ara
struck. You know when those V'umtj
giants get right down to business
there's no telling where their blows will
I land and I am not looking for a Jef
! fries or a Sharkey punch: not much."
Jim Chesley. V i popular all-round
sportsman, declined with thanks thÂ«
invitation from the club and tha
I pugilists to act as referee but ha
I agreed to act as the official time
keeper for the club.
TAUCHI'S FATE UNDECIDED.
The Case of the Japanese Accused of
Murder to Go to the Jury To-Day.
The trial of Kaninhi Tauchl, the Japan*
ese who shot and killed Mary Castilla, 4
white woman, on December 2B last, wai
resumed yesterday before Judge Wallace
and a jury. Attorney Archie Campbell
for the defense eloquently argued the
case. H* said that he expected the jury
to return a verdict of manslaughter. He
ably reviewed the facts of the killing and
endeavored to prove that the defendant
was mentally irresponsible at the time.
He was followed by Judge James Hall,
associate counsel, who appealed to the
jury to save the prisoner's neck. They
confidently expect that the Japanese will
escape with a verdict of manslaughter.
The case will be resumed this morning
and it is expected that a verdict will be
rendered late this afternoon.
Taxes Refunded.
The Judiciary Committee of the Super
visors met yesterday and recommended
the refunding of taxes as follows: Hi
bernia Savings and Loan Society, $7;
Joseph Smith, $17 14; Mary Talbot, $26 33;
Ellen Kiernan, $25 26.

THE SAN JOSE ELECTIONS.
WHILE the verdict of the election at San Jose
is not what the friends of good government
had hoped it would be. they may still congrat
ulate themselves that their efforts to do away with
'boss" rule were not without salutary effect. At least
the bosses learned one thing. To win a fight they
must put up good men. They are forced to make
this concession to the better element of the com
munity. The day has gone by when the politician
can defy public sentiment wholly and put up creatures
known to be parts of his machine.
The candidates elected at San Jose seem to be good
men. But for the opposition to the Rea gang men of
their standing would not have been nominated. On
the contrary, the ring would have selected creatures
of its own and used its power to force them upon a
community which had no confidence in them. By
methods known to the professional politician such
things are possible. But at San Jose so strong an
opposition to the Rea forces sprang up that there was
an absolute necessity for naming good men. Other
wise defeat was inevitable. Rea saw this and was
shrewd enough to profit by it. The outcome was a
victory for him, and yet a victory, or at least not an
absolute defeat, for the people who fought him.
The Call congratulates San Jose on having made
the Rea contingent name a creditable ticket. This
paper opposed Rea and has no regrets; but had he
put into the field the sort of nominees which would
have been selected had he not feared the public sen
timent The Call helped to arouse, a Rea victory would
have been little less than a calamity. We have not
lost interest in San Jose, and know that the efforts
made on behalf of her political freedom have not
been without beneficent result. In the future the
fight will be continued, and ultimately there can be
no other outcome than a complete triumph for the
people.
The Japanese who is on trial for a cold-blooded
murder he is known to have committed depends upon
a plea of insanity to save his neck. He is behind the
times. The plea of insanity has been overworked
zvd is now recognized as simply an indirect way of
declaring guilt and an intention of bamboozling the
public. The mortuary records of San Quentin will
show that the public is not always to be worked by
this game.
Policeman Orr swore that a certain man had been
loitering about during a certain period, and was
therefore a vagrant in the eyes of the law. The man
was able to vindicate himself by proving that at the
time specified he was in jail for petty larceny. This
climax of course spoiled the case, but the policeman
docs not seem much disturbed by the fact of having
been detected in the act of swearing falsely.
Spanish officials gravely announce that the crews
of American ships will fly into panic at the first sound
of a gun. If this is what they are building hopes of
victory on it is possible they are oversanguine. Spain
never attained but one naval victory worth mention
ing, and this was when she wrecked the Maine. His
tory records that the sailors of the United States
have won several.
An Oakland woman who sports an imposing title
has been arrested on the charge of insanity. Comes
forth her lawyer indignant to explain that the lady
was merely drunk. And he seems to have an idea
that he has mended matters.
Nevada is not acting in a very neighborly way in
excluding our cattle. If California were to exclude
the Ncvpda hog some of the sagebrush cattle gentle
men would have to go to the Atlantic to catch a
glimpse of the sea.
Now it is reported that the wicked insurgents in
tend to attack Havana. And that beautiful armistice*
warranted to wash and to stand in any climate, in full
force! The course of the insurgents is nothing less
than shocking.
Rev. Thomas Dixon of New York says that if this j
country is unwilling to avenge the murder of its sea- '
men it oupht to go to hades. Perhaps this is not ]
sound theology, but it will be accepted.
A Madrid paper has something to say about the }
"self-respect due to ourselves." It the Spanish coulJ^j
but see themselves as they are there would be great !
difficulty in collecting the debt.
Don Carlos kindly intimates that he will hold
aloof. As he has nothing else to hold, perhaps his
plan is indicative of wisdom.
An evening paper announces with every appear
ance of solemnity that the morning paper is doomed.
It's* really too bad, too.
Even yet there are times when people wonder why
Consul-General Lee was ordered out of Havana.
THE WORLD'S VERDICT ON THE
MESSAGE.
/"* ONGRESS and the people may learn much
I from the comments of the foreign press on the
message.
The history of Mr. Cleveland's Venezuela message
is recent. He had asked England to arbitrate a dis
puted boundary which for sixty 3'ears had been the
cause of friction between that country and an Ameri
can state. He treated it as an American question,
long in friction and left unsettled as a cause of war
which might lead to the landing of an armed force
from Europe within this hemisphere, and to remote
consequences of great gravity to the United States
by compelling this Government to an armed asser
tion of the Monroe doctrine. He did not demand
that England yield up the territory in dispute, for
that would have meant a demand for the dismember
ment of the British empire, which we had no right to
ask. He demanded only the arbitration and settle
ment of the boundary. When England, after refus
ing, assented, she was attacked for the concession in
every Continental capital, and bad feeling toward her
and the United States was freely expressed. That in
cident began and ended on strictly American lines
and gave no excuse for any European feeling. Our
action was wholly in line with our traditional policy.
President McKinley's message is in the same line.
There is not a phrase in it out of whicii European
interest can be extracted. It is couched in Monroe
hemisphere terms entirely, and it remains to be seen
whether Congress will observe similar limitations.
It must not be forgotten that Spain was once able
to make a European alliance in defense of he*" posi
tion in this hemisphere. The Holy Alliance, so called,
was the exciting cause of the Monroe doctrine. Eng
land, having lost her North American possessions
except the Canadas, foresaw that retentio of their
American possessions by Spain and Portugal would
make the Iberian peninsula so strong as to disturb
the European balance. To prevent recovery of lost
American domain by the armies of the Holy
Alliance Lord Canning suggested what is called the
Monroe doctrine to President Monroe and John
Quincy Adams, his Secretary of State. The alliance
was dissolved.
Let it be noted now that the United States resisted
all pressure to recognize the independence of the re
volted Latin-American colonies until they had won
independence, had expelled efficiently the jurisdiction
of the mother countries and established government
in form fit for admission into the family of nations.
Independence must be a fact, not a hypothesis, be
fore we can recognize it. The authority of the for
mer government must be at a definite end, before we
can admit its subjugation if we wish to stay in the
safe line of precedent.
In England the President's position is intelligently
understood. On the Continent it is intelligently mis
understood in Spain's interest. There is in the air
the shadow of another Holy Alliance. If Congress
declare for the independence of Cuba we will have
abandoned the Monroe doctrine and turned that
shadow into substance. We have uo more right to
demand that a European Government submit to dis
memberment when the domain lies in this hemis
phere than we have to demand that Germany give
up Alsace and Lorraine because* their people are cap
tives, held as the spoils of war. We can make the
destruction of the Maine a cause of war. Our in
tervention to stop strife in Cuba because of commer
cial damage, the expense of patrolling our coast to
prevent filibustering, and on humane grounds, may
be taken as a cause of' the declaration of war by
Spain, and in either case the issues are purely
American. But if we demand the independence of
Cuba the position acutely changes. The question be
comes European and no one can foresee the end.
In such a crisis a deaf ear should be turned to the
Cuban Junta. They have failed to expel Spain and
she has failed to overpower them. Having decla-ed
that under certain conditions they will turn their
arms against the United States, this country consid
ers them an incident in the affair.
The President has held the issue to wise lines, and
all that the Continental Governments can do is to
make faces at us and say ridiculous things about the
United States and England.
The Holy Alliance has friends in every American
newspaper office in which pretended patriotic rage
about the Maine covers a desire to help the bond
selling Junta by recognizing the independence of
Cuba. So far the President has made no mistake,
and if one come it will not be chargeable to the ad
ministration.
Of course, if Congress take the step Americans
must abide by the result and stand by their coun
try. The current tirades against the President are a
help for the enemy.
Perhaps the police know why such a notorious dive
as Abbott's saloon on Grant avenue is permitted to
run. It is the resort of criminals. There they meet
for various evil purposes and there they occasionally
shoot at each other. The last phase of the situation
calls for interference. The shooters aggravate their
offense by failing to shoot straight, thus allowing
jailbirds to escape who would better be at the Morgue
and endangering the lives of the chance, and possibly
woithy, passer-by.
The widow who came to town with $40,000 and
got into jail without much delay is counseled to spend
the money quickly. If she do not some of the con
fidence people who thrive mostly on rich widows will
assuredly be spending it for her.
City Engineer Clement of Oakland has been elected
president of the Police and Fire Commission, partly
by virtue of his own vote. Mr. Clement is not a man
whose modesty will ever balk his natural impulse to
recognize a good man.
It is a pity there is no law to cover the case of
the man Doggett, arrested for the abduction of a
girl 13 years old. To send the man to jail would be
a slur on the other prisoners, and to hang him would
disgrace the gallows.
Testimony is beginning to show that the officers
who ran away from the murderer of' Lieutenant
Burke were not only brave but generous. Each was
anxious to retire so as to permit the others to make
a reputation.
Blanco's men refuse to allow American naval offi
cers near what is left of the Maine. Let this be as
cribed to genuine solicitude. They are afraid the
wreck may careen and some of Uncle Sam's men get
hurt.
"Has Lee left Madrid?" asks an evening paper
with some show of anxiety. We think it perfectly
safe to say that he has not and that he doesn't in
tend to do so.
The statement that Spain is standing by her de
clarations does not mean that she can make them
good. The most fervid asseveration that black s white
rmlst be wholly without practical result.
THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 13, 1898.
THE CHARTER "LORD MfIYOR."
IN an article which is designed to further the adop
tion of the new charter a morning contemporary
declares that no '"Lord Mayor" has been set up by
that instrument. Whatever may be said for or against
the Mayor who is actually created by the proposed
charter, there can be but one opinion as to the im
propriety of making such statements as this. It is
utterly untrue that the charter does not set up a
"Lord Mayor" â that is to say, a Mayor who in the
event of his creation will exercise unparalleled powers
in forming and controlling the government of this
city.
For instance, during his term of two years every
Mayor elected under the proposed charter will ap
point a majority of the following commissions and
boards: A Board of Public Works, which will con
trol and supervise all work done upon the streets,
sewers and public buildings of the municipality; a
Board of Education, which will manage the schools;
a Police Commission, which will appoint and control
a semi-military organization of about 600 men; a
Fire Commission, which will manage a department
consisting of about 400 active young politicians; an
Election Commission, which will appoint and control
all election officers and which will canvass the votes
cast at all elections; a Board of Health, which will
manage the hospitals and almshouse; a Park Com
mission, which will control and improve Golden Gate
Park.
No good purpose can be subserved by solemnly
affirming that the man who will direct the vast po
litical machine thus outlined will not be a "Lord
Mayor." The people may want such a Mayor. If
they do they can get him by voting for the proposed
charter. But under no circumstances whatever
should the fact be concealed that by so voting they
will enter upon an era of one-man power fraught
with momentous import.
It is true that the charter collects in the hands of the
Mayor powers which are now scattered in many
hands, but this does not deprive him of the character
described as "Lord Mayor." Experience in govern
ment has shown that while a division of power weak
ens its exercise, it also diminishes the evils which re
sult from the unrestrained play of pride and ambition.
The wisdom of such a division is now being illus
trated at Washington. Congress declares war and the
President wages it. The check of different minds is
manifested by the deliberation and caution with which
the President and Congress are considering the diffi
culties with Spain.
A "Lord Mayor" for San Francisco may be a good
thing. If so the individual created by the proposed
charter would certainly be an ideal potentate. As
master of the Fire and Police departments, and as
master of the patronage controlled by every other de
partment of the government, he could easily swing
25,000 votes at any election except one at which the
people had been roused against him. We may have
reached that stage of our existence when a Mayor
who can cast and count our votes for us has become
a political necessity; if this be the fact we have him
in the proposed charter, and we should not at the
outset of the campaign allow anybody to underrate
him.
A CURRENCY REFORM BILL.
T \RPORTS from Washington announce that the
hâ/ House Committee on Banks and Banking has
framed a currency reform bill which the ma
jority is prepared to submit to Congress as soon as
a way is made for it in the House. Some sanguine
supporters of the measure are quoted as asserting that
it will be adopted at this session, and while this may
be doubted, the urgency of the issue is such that an
effort will certainly be made to accomplish it.
From a summary which has been made public it
appears that one of the chief features of the proposed
reform is that of throwing upon the national banks
the entire burden of finding gold to sustain the paper
money of the country. It is claimed they have ample
power to do this, for as is said in the preliminary re
port on the bill: "They will have the power to regu
late rates, within the narrow limits marked out by
economic law, in such a manner as to attract gold to
the country by restricting circulation when necessity
arises."
The general scheme of the bill is announced to con
tain these provisions: i. A division of issue and re
demption is established in the national treasury for
which the Secretary is authorized to set aside the gen
eral cash balances in excess of $50,000,000. No note
redeemed in gold is to be again paid out except under
"exceptional conditions." 2. National banks are re
quired to assume the redemption of current United
States demand notes in order to obtain circulation
based upon their commercial assets. 3. National
banks will be required for one year after the passage
of the act to maintain the minimum amount of United
States bonds as security for circulation. This bond
deposit may be reduced one-fourth annually, begin
ning one year after the act goes into effect. 4. A new
class of notes, called "national reserve notes," is to be
issued in place of legal tender notes deposited by the
banks with the treasury, and national banks are to be
permitted to issue current notes upon their commer
cial assets to the amount of reserve notes issued to
them. The purpose of this provision is to compel
the reversion of United States notes into reserve
notes, as well as to limit the issue of currency upon
commercial assets. 5. A tax of 2 per cent is levied
upon currency notes in excess of 60 per cent of the
capital of the bank issuing them, and a tax of 6 per
cent is levied upon circulation of the same character
in excess of 80 per cent of the capital. 6. The na
tional currency notes are to be secured by a guar
anty fund made up of a contribution in gold coin of
5 per cent of the entire circulation of each bank. The
notes are also a first lien upon all the assets of the
bank. 7. National reserve notes will continue to be
a legal tender until received at the treasury, when they
will be canceled. 8. The parity of silver coin with
gold is to be maintained by a gold redemption fund
in the treasury. 9. Silver certificates are to be issued
hereafter only in bills of $1, $2 and $5. Legal tender
notes, reserve notes and currency are not to be issued
in denominations of less than $10.
From this outline it will be seen that the bill is
along the lines recommended by the Indianapolis con
ference, though, as has been pointed out by one critic,
it is not so courageous as the bill advocated by that
conference, since "it does not provide for the speedy
retirement of greenbacks and does not declare out
right for the gold standard."
It is possible the bill may be amended in some re
spects before being reported, and it is very certain to
undergo that treatment by Congltss before it is finally
adopted. In its present form it serves to show the di
rection that currency reform is likely to take and
probably will take at this session unless war pre
vents the subject from being brought up for consider
ation.
There are some reasons for fearing that the stoning
of American Consulates may become a popular
amusement among the Latin nations. But it really
is not polite.
PRINTED WITH TYPES BEFORE GUTENBERG'S DAY.
WHO invented printing?
The honor has for a long time by
general accord been given to John
Gutenberg of Mayence, though the
Hollanders stoutly claim Jt for Laurent
Coster of Haarlem. Now comes M. Gil
liodts Van Sweren. keeper of the archives
of Paris, who asserts that neither of these
is entitled to the honor, but that it be
longs to Jean Brito of Bruges, and pro
duces some strong and convincing proofs
of his bold assertion.
M. Gilliodts will, however, hardly con
vince the partisans of Gutenberg of this,
nor the adherents of Coster, nor yet the
innumerable crowd of those who in mat
ters of history will listen to no proof
whatever on a question that they consider
already decided.
Yet he seems to have right on his side.
At the beginning of the fifteenth cen
tury the discovery of printing was "in the
air." They had already begun in Europe
to engrave writing in relief and reversed
on plates of wood, and with the aid of a
rudimentary press had multiplied many
small books of general use, such as a, b,
c books and "Books of Hours." One of
the processes consisted of engraving each
line on a separate block, a number of
which together made up a page. From
that to engrave the letters separately was
but a step, yet a wonderful leap, full of
great possibilities.
The one who first thought of engraving
in relief the die or punch with which to
strike the matrices for cutting the char
acters by the "font" was the real in
ventor of typography, the creator of
book-printing.

Fac-simile of the Last Page of the "Doctrinal" of Gerson, Printed by Jean Brito.
Mansion, a very modest place Is given to
a small book bound in red morocco with
golden threads, thus designated in the
catalogue, "Gerson â copie de deux granda
tableaux. Brugesâ lmp. par Jean Brito
in 40." This volume of thirty-two leaves
is the only complete copy of the first
edition of the Doctrinal of Jean Gerson,
the celebrated chancellor of the Univer
sity of Paris, who died in 1429. It is the
first book printed from the movable char
acters of a "font" of type that has come
down to our time.
It carries no date, but on the last page,
which is here reproduced in fac-simlle
(from I/Illustration), one sees after the
"explicit fehciter" a stanza of six lines
in Latin verse, which literally translated
reads:
'â¢Remark the beauty of this present
writing; compare this work with other
works; put this book alongside of other
books; see with what neatness, with what
care, with what elegance this impression
has been made by the 'bourgeois' of
Brugfs Jean Brito, who has discovered
without any one teaching him his mar
vellous art at the same time as his aston
ishing instruments, not less worthy of
admiration."
It is difficult to be more precise, espec
ially in verse. The bourgeois Jean Brito,
who has written his name in full at the
end of this printed volume, declares him
self loudly the inventor of an art un
known before him and T>f which he offers
to the people of his time a first specimen.
It was in 1773 that the Abbe Ghesquiere
pointed out this categorical subscription.
The Doctrinal then belonged to M. Meer
man of La Haye. At this date the con
test for the priority of the invention of
printing was confined to Gutenberg and
Coster. On the appearance of this third
rival Mr. School of.Mayence and School
of Harlem joined forces to choke off the
posthumous claims of Jean Brito.
They denied that he ever invented any
thing. They even denied that he was ever
a printer. They cast doubts on the fact
of his ever having existed. The most that
they would accord was that he was a
skillful copyist, who had thought it good
to vaunt in Latin verse his peculiar tal
ents at the end of a manuscript, which
manuscript had later been used by a
printer, who Inadvertently reproduced the

â verses with the rest. In short, Jean
Brito was wrong. He came on the scene
too late. The opinions of the world had
already been formed.
M. Gllliodts Van Sweren has published
a large volume entitled "The Works of
Jean Brito," making an appeal for justice,
which gives strong proofs from newly
discovered documents.
He establishes the fact that the Brito
family belong to the upper bourgeois
class of Bruges, and that from 1393 to
1492. when this "Venice of the north" was
at the height of its prosperity, one Jean
Brito was successively Counselor. Burgo
master. Sheriff and Treasurer of the city.
He died poor, and one 6f his sons carry
ing the father's name to ear/i a living be
came a book writer. The most ancient
register of the guild of librarians and
book writers (boucscrivers) of Bruges
mentions in the accounts for the year 1454
the name of Jean Brito, and he thereafter
figures with the title of meester until 1493,
the date of his death.
Since ihere was at Bruges a book writer
named Jean Brito, and since we know of
a book that this Jean Brito declares uim
self to have printeu, if it can be shown
in addition that the book was printed
with movable type from a "font," it
will be incontestible that Jean Brito was
a typographic printer.
Now, the characters used in the "Doc
trinal" show beyond a doubt that they
were printed by type cast in molds or
matrices. All the as. the b's, the ad's,
the de's, all the isolated and conjoined
letters, are identical in every point of
character. And these same type are
found in two other books known to have
been the works of Jean Brito. These type
and the molds In which they were cast
are the "astonishing Instruments" men
tioned by Brito in the verse.
At the epoch when Brito lived Bruges
was at the very apogee of Its splendor.
The sumptuous court of Philip the Good
was there. One hundred and fifty foreign
vessels entered Its basins every day. Six
teen countries kept Consuls there. It was
a grand center of art and literature. Is
it likely that with such surroundings an
honored bourgeois, a master librarian,
could dare to falsely proclaim himself the
author of such a discovery without rais
ing a protest from his contemporaries. In
14.77 the illustrious printer, Colard Man
sion, appears in his turn on the registers
of the Guild of St. Jean. If Brito had not
really been his predecessor in the art
would not he have exposed him?
It may be said tnat while Brito Invented
typographical printing at Bruges, Guten
berg at Mayence and Coster at Haarlem,
of whose works ne may have been ig
norant, preceded him.
At what date was the "Doctrinal"
printed by Brito? In the "Memoireaux
de Jean le Robert" occurs a passaga
which, translated into modern language,
l ads, "Item for a Doctrinal imprint"
('gette in molle. cast in molds"), which
I have sent for to Bruges, by Marquet, a
writer of Valenciennes, in the month of
January. 1445, for Jacquet twenty "sols
tournois" (money of Tours).
This formally establishes that in 1445
they sold in Bruges a "Doctrinal" printed
with characters cast in a mold. M. Gill
iodts shows from public documents that
the sale of books made elsewhere was
forbidden at Bruges during the fifteenth
century. The "Doctrinal" bought for
Jacquet, then, must have been one print
ed by Brito. There was no other. This
makes the date of the "Doctrinal" cer
tainly as early as 1445, which antedates
the Bible of Gutenberg by twelve years,
and that was not printed from type cast
In molds, but from characters cut out
separately. This was the case also with
the works attributed to Coster, of which
the earliest appeared in 1437.
Distributive justice, it seems, should
give to Coster the first place in the de
velopment of wooden type printing and
employing isolated letters in the place of
engraved pages or lines, to Gutenberg and
his associates the honor of having trained
in their .shops at Mayence the skillful
workmen who spread the art of printing
throughout Europe; but to Jean tJrito
must be accorded the palm as discoverer
and first applier of the art of printing
by means of typographical characters.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 12.
Dr. J. P. H. Dunn of the National
Guard and health officer of the City of
Oakland, and Dr. E. H. TVoolsey, who,
as a professional man and as a poli
tician, is one of the best known on this
Bide of the bay, think they are having
a great quarrel. Nobody else thinks
so. It Is true that the cause of dif
ference between them is sufficient to
carry the quasl-quarrel into the law
courts, but their mutual friendship and
their mutual interests will no doubt
prevent such a calamity.
And all the trouble is over $1500, a
paltry sum, indeed, to two such men as
Dr. Dunn and Dr. V^olsey. At the
present time the situation closely re
sembles the Americo-Spanish compli
eati.'n. Each gentleman professes to
have Issued his ultimatum, yet neither
proceeds to war, and in the meantime
their attorneys, for they have sought
ample legal assistance, have brought
about an armistice.
The two professional gentlemen are
really saying hard things of each other.
No one thinks they believe them, and
in a few weeks' time the gentlemen
themselves will not believe that they
paid them. The friendships of both
gentlemen are pretty much alike, and
when they wanted legal advice each
rushed to the attorneys most promi
nent in town only to find that his ex
friend had already retained them. At
this time Messrs. Moore & Martin and
Reed & Nusbaumer are known to be
interested, but Dr. Woolsey declares
that he will have entire satisfaction if
he has to employ all the lawyers of

to appear on his behalf.
There is a little story, of course, lead
ing up to this great jokeâ if joke it
should prove to be. Several years ago
Dr. Woolsey was not at all anxious to
change his ofllces, which were located
at Twelfth and Broadway. Neither was
he anxious to have as a near compan
ion Dr. D. D. Orowley. Dr. Crowley
did not feel inclined to move, and was
surprised one day about IS9I to learn
that Dr. Woolsey had leased the en
tire upper two floors of the block, and
that the demand from tenants was so
great that there was no room left for
him, so he moved across the street and
is still there. Dr. Dunn was under
stood to be a professional partner n?
Dr. Woolsey. At this time Dr. Wool
s^y was conducting the large railroad
hospital and needed several assist
Dr. Dunn was perhaps the leader
among Dr. Woolsey's partners, and al
though Dr. Woolsey is a Democrat and
once made an independent campaign
for Mayor, and Dr. Dunn is a Republi
can, this did not interfere with Dr.
Woolsey, while the leading member of
tho Board of Health a few years ago,
securing the position of Health Officer
for his partner, Dr. Dunn. These facts
will show that the friendship between
tho two doctors is deep-rooted and pre
sumably sincere.
After acting as landlord for the upper
portion of the block for two or throe
years, Dr. Wooisey found that the spec
ulation was a good one, and Dr. Dunn
thereupon announced his desire to take
up one-half of the lease. This was ac
rededto about four years ago, and since
that time Dr. Dunn, so it is said, has
bf en enjoying the use of his own offices,
but has not added to the treasury. Re
cently it was made known that on the
whole the renting of the two floors had
left a deficit of $1500, and Dr. Wooisey,
holding the lease, had to make It good.
lie has now notified Dr. Dunn that this
shortage is chargeable to him, and as
Dr. Dunn has not ye* given Dr. Wool-
Beyhis check for that amount, a declar
ation of war was made instantly. The
two doctors rushed to their attorneys,
and are now so overburdened with legal
advice that they have been forced to
stop differing and to do some thinking.
Each is making a campaign in all di
rections, and it is funny to see the ap
parent sincerity which is being put into
their professed animosity.
Drs. Dunn and Wooisey have been
friends lor years, it is believed they
still ore friends, and no one but them
selves seems to have any idea that the
little matter of a difference of opinion
over a lease will sever their friendship.
Certainly their numerous friends in
this city do not think so. But in the

JOSHES FOR THE PROFESSORS.
Faculty and Students Anxiously
Awaiting the Appearance of the
'99 Blue and Grold.
BERKELEY, April 12.â The Blue and
Gold, published by the Junior class, will
make its appearance on Friday, and
meanwhile the â¢"josha.ble" subjects at
collegeâ faculty as well as studentsâ are
uneasily expectant. Editor Charles E.
Fryer has been busy for months past on
the college annual, and promises a num
ber of surprises for the collegians. In
anticipation of the possible effect of the
joshing, both the editor and the manager,
Phil Franklin, are collecting a small
bodyguard about them, acordlng to re
ports of their friends.
Among the joshes on the grave protes
sors at Berkeley is an illustrated descrip
tion of the "Perambulator Brigade," In
which are cartooned the various members
of the faculty whose hearts have been
gladdened within the past year by the
birth of an heir. Professor W. A. Merrill
of the Latin department is one of the
most prominent of the victims of Editor
Fryer's pen. . a ..
Professor W. A. Setchell, head of the
botany department comes in for his
share'of the fun. The following story is
told of him: The professor, who had been
disturbed by the midnight howlings of
a neighbors dog, resolved to poison the
canine. Going to a Berkeley drugstore,
he asked for prussic arid. He took the
vial which the clerk gave him, poured a
few drops on a piece of meat and gave it
to the dog. The dog ate it and came
back for more. This time the bot
anist poured the contents of the
bottle down the dog's throat, but
the canine merely wagged his tail.
In a rage the professor hastened to the
drug clerk who had sold him the vial.
â¢â¢Look here," exclaimed the Irate
scientist, ''what did you sell me when I
asked for prussic acid?" "That's all
right, old fellow." responded the clerk,
soothingly, "life's not a failure. Don't
take it so hard and Just think of your
family."

Berkeley's Health Officer Foresees
Disaster in the Threatened
Water Famine.
BERKELEY, April 12.â As a result of
the threatened scarcity of water in Berke
ley this year. Health Officer Rowell fears
an increase in the sick and mortality re
cord of the college town. He declares
that the water of Berkeley, unless boiled
for drinking, is absolutely dangerous.
In his report to the Board of Town
Trustees the health oflictr says:
"There exists at present in the town
four cases of typhoid fevor. these beln&
distributed through the various wards of
the town. At least three of these cases
may be directly traced to the use of'well
water. One of these was contracted in
the country. Another is attributable to
the use of water from a tributary of
Strawberry Creek, and a third has been
by reputable citizens considered due to
the unsanitary condition of the Kellogg
School.
"If is unnecessary to comment upon the
absolute danger from drinking unboiled
well water, and to suggest a probable in
crease in our sick and mortality record, if
the season's shortage in water necessi
tates a too strict economy in flushing
sewers." "

BERKELEY, April 12.â 1t takes a Berkeley girl to keep a secret; at least
that's what the excited young people of the college town have come to
think since the announcement to-day that Miss Gwynedd Carnall, a de
mure little middler at the Berkeley High School, h - for the last four months
been not Miss Carnall? but Mrs. C. F. Balaam, the wife of a sophomore in the
College of Mechanics at the State University. The young folks were se
cretly married just after the close of the Christmas vacation, and none of
their most intimate friends knew of their romance until they themselves
decided to announce it. To say that the announcement has surprised their
friends would be putting it mildly-
The young bride is a daughter of the late Nathan C. Carnall and resides
at 2159 Vine street, North Berkeley. She is a charming, petite blonde
with a seriousness beyond her years. She is a member of the class of '99
at the Berkeley High School, where the story of her romantic marriage
has caused a buzz of excitement among teachers, as well as pupils.
Charles Frederick Balaam, the student-husband, is 21 years of age and
is Just completing his second year at the university. He comes from the
southern part of the State, having graduated from the Vi3alia High School
In 1896. He is well known at the university and has always taken a prom
inent part in the activities of the class of 1900, of which he is a member.
It was only last September that the young people met. A strong mu
tual attachment sprang up between them, and in less than four months they
decided to become man and wife, but to let nobody know of their marriage
until the close of the present college semester, when it would be neces
sary for the young man to discontinue his college course. Accordingly, as
soon as Mr. Balaam returned from Visalia after the holiday vacation the
young people took a trip, "somewhere in California " as Mrs. Balaam smil
ingly said, and "somewhere in the early part of this year" the twain were
made one. How the difficulty of securing a license, the bride lacking two
years of her majority, was overcome, the young wife smilingly declined to
explain. Be that as it may, the knot was tied fast and the young couple
returned together to Berkeley.
About two weeks ago the bride-s mother, Mrs. Carnall, learned of her
daughter's marriage. Mrs. Balaam decided that the time was quite proper
for her to announce her marriage to her friends. Mr. and Mrs. Balaam
will leave Berkeley at the close of the college term, which occurs in about
three weeks, for Visalia, where the groom will engage in business.
LADY BULLER
IS SET FREE
Although a Neurotic She
Is Far From Being
Insane.
Says She Is Not Bound to Give
an Account of Her Van
ishings.
Is Advised by the Doctors to Go to a
Sanitarium and Have a Long
Rest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 12.
As stated in The Call this morning
Lady Yarde Duller was not insane, but
had not fully recovered from the effects
of a late dinner last Sunday evening.
This morning she was examined by
Drs. Buteau and Pratt, and after aboui
twenty minutes' questioning she wan
released, although the physicians ad
vised her to go to a sanitarium lor a
complete rest.
Lady Buller was accompanied by her
nurse, her son and her cousin, Attor
ney Ernest Wakeman. In answer to
questions Attorney Wakeman said that
Lady Buller is about 42 years old, and
that though born in St. Louis she was
an Englishwoman, her marriage to Vis
count Buller establishing her right to
that title. It is stated that if her lady
ship were committed to an asylum she
would at once appeal to the British
Consul for redress.
In answer to a delicate 'question At
torney Wakeman said, "She doesn't
use drugs," and her ladyship sharpiy
replied, "1 am not addicted to liquor 3
at all. I have a charming nature and
I try to preserve it."
"Do you ever take any liquor?" asked
Dr. Pratt.
"Certainly; all I need. I am not a
fool," was the answer.
Her nurse, Mrs. Melburn, stated that
her mistress took a little whisky and
milk under orders from her doctor.
Mary Gilliek of West Oakland was
the next witness. She said: "I saw
Lady Buller lying in a lot and had
two men pack her into my house. Sne
told me she had been to the race track
and had won lots of money. She spoke
as if she had a couple of beers in her,
but I did not notice any liquor on her
breath. She kept talking about her
coachman and carriage, but 1 did not
know who she was."
DeWitt Adams, a colored bootblack,
was the next witness, and said the
lady came into his barber shop and
wanted her hair curled and her boots
blacked. "The barber wouldn't fix her
hair, but I shined her shoes," he said.
"Did she act in a rational manner?"
Dr. Pratt asked.
"No," answered Adams, who evi
dently misunderstood the word, "she
was very nice and pleasant."
Lady Buller said she had been in two
runaways recently, and that she came
across from San Francisco in a car
riage and the horses started to run.
She dismounted and tried to walk to
Mrs. Melburn's house, but became
weak and frightened and fainted away.
"There is nothing wrong with me,"
said she, "I am nervous and not over
strong. I am not any more insane
than most people. Everybody Is more
or less insane on some subjects." Re
ferring to a midnight visit to a friend,
which Lady Buller said she made last
Sunday night, Dr. Pratt asked her if it
were customary to visit at midnight,
and she replied: "I can see the person
at any time of the day or night if I
choose. I am not a vanishing lady,
nor am I in the custom of giving an
account of where I go. I am a perfect
ly fretf agent. My native lord did not
get the best of me and nobody else
has. If I told where I went always I
would get in a pretty hot box some
times. Occasionally I disappear for a
week at a time."
The physicians held a little consul
tation and decided that the lady was
irrational and would be better with a
guardian. The 1 "- classified her case as
neurotic and advised her to take a
complete rest. The party at once left
the court house for San Francisco.
FOUR OFFICES REQUIRED.
J. W. Lynn Handcuffed During His
Preliminary Examination.
OAKLAND, April 12.â The examination
of J. W. Lynn, who shot his wife five
times on February 1, was abruptly
stopped this afternoon by the prisoner's
demonstrations. It required four ofiicers
to handcuff him. but the court was unable
to bridle his tongue, which he used freely.
The case will go on on Saturday. Mean
while, Lynn's attorney announced he
would swear to a complaint charging his
client with insanity.
The only new point developed to day
W*xÂ» his wife's admission that the de
fendant's mother was in the Utica r . V.)
Insano Asylum. She told the s:ory of tho
shoi'tirg, after which ncr mother. Mrs.
Mary A. Thompson, and Dr. Stratton
were examined. It was during the testi
mony of W. J. Roth, his brother-in-law,
that Lynn began. He arose and said:
"It's a He. \>ny don't you tell the truth?
I!': is the fellow that is the cause of all
my trouble."
After a hard fight Detectives Quigley
and Shorey, Sergeant Green arxl Captain
Sam Mitchell handcuffed him, and on the
court's orders look him below. Half an
hour later he was brought back, but still
acted so boisterously that an adjourn
ment was taken.

and Officers Elected.
OAKLAND, April 12.â The Oakland

GRAND JURY
HAS STRUCK
A HOT TRAIL
Books and Contracts
of the Times Are
in Evidence.
They Are Said to Contain
All Sorts of Inter
esting Stories.
Gil B. Daniels Believes That He
Is Possessed of Much
Information.
F. J. MOFFITT IS PLEASED.
Says an Examination oi' the Books
Will Bo a Good Thing
lor Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 12.
The Grand Jury has struck a new
trail. It is a bright shining trail full
of good things, and it is asserted by
some of its members that it will lead
to many astounding revelations con
nected with the corruption by water
companies during the past fifteen
years. Gil B. Daniels is now the pro
prietor of the historic old newspaper,
the Oakland Times. Mr. Daniels is
also a member of the present Grand
Jury. The Oakland Times during the
past fifteen years is generally consid
ered as having been the medium be
tween the Contra Costa Water Com
pany and the Southern Pacific Com
pany and their political "friends" in
this city, and it has generally been
thought that if the books and contracts
of the old newspaper could ever be
made public they would tell some of
the mysteries of the past that have
been credited to certain Oakland poli
ticians and back rooms of Oakland sa
loons.
A few nights ago in the course of
conversation Mr. Daniels was discuss
ing some incidents connected with the
past history of the Times, and he re
marked that the old Times' safe, with
its books and contracts covering some
of the most interesting years in Oak
land politics, would tell many an in
teresting story. It is a peculiar cir
cumstance that the books and papers
of an adversary should fall into the
hands of his political enemy. There
were not two greater political enmi
ties existing in Oakland six years ago
than those of ex-Senator Moffitt and Dr.
George C. Pardee. Frank Moffitt fig
ured as the leader of the old guard in
local politics, George Pardee was the
leader of the reform element. Moffitt
fought with his own paper, the Times,
Pardee fought with Frank Leach's pa
per, the Enquirer. When the ex-Sen
ator sold the Times to A. W. Bishop
he went out of the newspaper busi
ness, and the paper finally passed
into the hands of two banks and event
ually to Mr. Leach. A few months ago
when Mr. Leach retired from journal
ism, the Times went with the Enquirer
in the deal which w s made in the
interest of Dr. Pardee with Gil Daniels
as the nominal head. Thus it comes
about that the books, contracts and
paipers covering many interesting years
of the Times' existence passed out of
the hands of Mr. Moffitt into the keep
ing of Mr. Daniels and Dr. Pardee.
With these documents as a lead, it is
believed the Grand Jury will be able to
follow up many interesting clues, for
it was during the latter years of Mr.
Moffitt's proprietorship that the Times
ceased to support the Contra Costa
Company and showed a marked friend
ship for Mr. Dingee's enterprise. As
Mr. Daniels is an active member of the
Grand Jury, it is not to be supposed
that he will hide any of the evidence in
his possession, but will make the
greatest use of it in the present inves
tigation.
Ex-Senator Moffitt wasasked to-night
what sensational testimony could be
extracted from the books of the Times,
and he replied: "I have never given
those old books and contracts a
thought in connection with the Grand
Jury; however, it will be a good thing
for "those archives to be examined.
They will show that the Times was
conducted under the seven years of
my management as a business propo
sition, and I defy all the Grand Juries
in Christendom to find any evidence of
crookedness, bribery or corruption
from any water company, railroad
company or other corporate influence.

The books will show that before I took
possession of the Times there was a
scandalous contract existing between
all the local papers to keep at an ex
tortionate figure the rates. for the city
printing. The books will show that
during my seven years' proprietorship
this contract was smashed to pieces,
and for a long time the Times did the
city printing at actual cost. They will
also show that as soon as I quit news
paper work the unrighteous compact
was renewed. Nothing would gratify
me more than tn have the Grand Jury
go carefully over all the books and
contracts that have passed .into the
hands of the Times' present owners.
We never had two sets of books and
always had- a public bookkeeper, and
anything that was done was above
board."
Mr. Daniels' remark Implies that
there might be some papers, the exis
tence of which Mr. Moffitt has forgot
ten, but there is no doubt that the
thorough investigation being made by
the Grand Jury into every channel for
evidences of corruption will include the
property of the Times in the possession
of the present owner.
The Grand Jury has not yet been
called together, although nearly a week
has elapsed since its indefinite adjourn
ment. The many scandals have been
so often brought before the public and
told in the Grand Jury room that al
though they are generally believed
there seems to be cc-nsiderable doubt
as to whether such evidence will justi
fy any more indictments. It is argued
that if the Grand Jury had any posi
tive trail of criminality it would not
break off where It did, thus giving those
who were under suspicion an opportu
nity to cover up their tracks during the
adjournment.
The Grand Jury will probably try to
discover why the present City Council
should take steps to impede the prog
ress of the water front cases. The reso
lution introduced by Mr. Upton last
night was certainly worthy of support,
for it did not entail a particle of ex
pense to the city, while it would cer
tainly have aided in preserving to the
State that which it was awarded by
the Supreme Court.

The racing at Oakland track yester
day was interspersed with novelties of

ir - furnisl d the crowd while the field
was at the post in the mile and a six

wee tots who compose operettas in

â¢without an "angel," but this was an
exhibition pure and simple of infant
prodigies in the riding line without

future home, though not from any
choice of his own. A. the first turn,
Ballister forgot to make the turn,
continuing on his course straight
through the outside fence. Everybody
in the stand arose with an exclamation
of horror. Balli er took fence and all
with him. Young Daly gracefully went
over the animals head, got up, walked
back to the stand while the horse was
being led, and then remounted. He
was cheered for his gameness if such
it could be called. Sooner or later a lit
tle white hearse will wend its way out
to Piedmont with one of these riding
wonders, and then the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children will
took a hand. Coburn on Magnus play- \
ed a good second fiddle, but the â 
"swipes" felt no fear for him, as he is j
said to have derailed an engine and j
seventeen flat ars without suffering in- j
Jury. The race for which Morinel and
Plan were equal choices in the betting,
was eventually won by Watomba,
which downed Don Clarencio five
lengths.
First choices captured three purses.
The different fields wore an uncertain
aspect and no heavy betting was in
dulged in.
The Imp. Criphton filly, Canace, run
ning in the colors of Nick Hall, took
the opening four-furlong scramble for
2-year-olds. She was played down to
3-to-2 favoritism and finishing gamely
led Owyhee out less than a length.
Zacatosa, the second choice, was third.
But four started in the four-and-a
half-furlong spin for 2-year-olds and
but four lined up at the barrier. It
proved a gift for Banewor, the Burns
& \Vat*Â»rhouse entry, which ruled a
2-to-5 choice in the betting and won
easing up from Malay.
Charley Fir.k's Nowsgatherer horse
was a warm article yesterday, dispos
ing of McLight and Rubicon in the
mile selling run, fourth on the card.
"Eight to 1 was laid by the books
against Fink's piece of racing bric-a
brae, and after ho had stood Rubicon
on his head the first six furlongs, drew
away v.inning driving less than a
l^n^th before the favorite, McLight, in
1:40%.
Loch Ness, a Montana horse, was
backed down to the printer's name to
â win the flve-and-a-half-furlong sprint,
third on the card, but failed to
land. Royal Spirit, a 7-to-l shot, led
throughout, winning easily from Roy
Carruthers. a 30-to-l chance.
The concluding seven-furlong run

HORSE BOARD

.Liverymen Meet to Make
a General Raise in
Prices.
Try to Induce Hay and Grain
Dealers to Sanction the
Plan.
All Stable* Outside the Order May
Be Forced to Sign the
CompÂ»ot.
All persons who own horses for which
they pay board at livery and feed stables
will be interested In the recent proceed
ings of San Francisco liverymen, who are
about to raise prices.
At a meeting held over Bridge's stables
Monday night preliminary steps were
taken to carry out the programme ar
ranped by what is known as the San
Francisco Liverymen's Association. This
involves a concerted movement to
raise prices of boarding horses from the
prevailing rates of $15 and $25 a month to
about $5 more on each class.
Secretary Magner of the Hay Dealers' \
Association and two or three dealers were |
uncommunicative regarding the purposes !
of the meeting, which was a conference j
between the liverymen and the hay deal
en. At half a dozen stables and hay
stores It w;is almost impossible to learn '
the purpose of the meeting and of an- i
other conference, which Is called for next
Friday night, but one who attended the
meeting gave the following facts relative !
to the movement:
"The liverymen are tired of boarding
horses at a rate that does not pay,"' he
Bald, "and we have decided to try to get
all the liverymen In and raise the prices.
"We have asked the hay and feed dealers
to refuse to sell, save at an advanced
rate, to any person outside of our organ
ization. If we can carry this plan out we
are all right, but if we f;UI it is almost a
certainty that we cannot succeed in our
purpose."
It is understood that there are several
liverymen who have refused to join the
association, and that a number of per
sons who have hay for sale will also de
cline to Join the movement.
CHARGED WITH PERJURY.
J. W. Piersou, a Mining Man, Before
the Grand Jury.
J- W. Plerson was brought before the
Grand Jury last night on a charge of
perjury. Pierson was at one time con
nected with a mining scheme, and a suit
to recover was recently brought in Judge
Kerrigan's court by a man named Die
vert, who was backed by the Knox Col
lection Agency. In the trial Plerson
swore that he had paid all claims against
him and had vouchers to show for the
came.'
After the trial, however, a man named
Jjtaxy, who lives In Grass Valley, made
a statement to the effect that Pierson
still owed him money, and had offered a
compromise. Another man named Simons
also had a bill lor $42 50. He claims that
Pierson sent him a check, which he
claimed had been issued by the Knox
Agency, for J2G. as a compromise on the
bill. The check proved to be worthless.
1.. V. Merle of the 1 X L allots that
Pierson owes him $69, and since the trial
has offered to compromise ior $4u and a
time check on the mine.
Manager Spencer uf the Knox Agency
was placed on the stand, and testified
as to bills owed by the man at the time
of the trial, when he alleged that every
thing was straightened up.
Pierson was then placed on the stand,
and swore that he had paid all bills, and
could show vouchers for the same if he
were given a reasonable length of time.
He was granted one week in which to
produce the vouchers.
Paid Well for His Beer.
Alfred West, an employe at the Union
Iron Works, went to the Eureka Music
Hall on Kearny street Monday night with
$G0 in his pocket. He was under the im
pression t.hat he spent about $12 for beer,
which he shared with Ethel Barnes, a
waitress In the place, and he thought It
was very unkind of Ethel to relieve him
of the other $4S. He had Ethel arrested,
and yesterday morning swore to a com
plaint In- Judge Conlan's court charging
her with grand larceny.

Results of the Test in Various Forms o?
Dysp'epsiu.
Chronic indigestion or dyspepsia,
while a very common trouble, has for
Borne time been looked upon by able
physicians as a serious thinr and that
no time should be lost in treating it
properly at the start, because recent
researches have shown that the most
serious, fatal and incurable diseases

Diabetes is simply one form of indi-

being assimilated by the digestive or-

Is not properly assimilated.
While consumption and dyspepsia
are twin diseases, and it is beyond
question that dyspepsia makes a fer-
tile soil for the seeds of consumption.
But the trouble has been to find a
remi.iy that could be depended upon
! to cure dyspepsia, as It is notoriously
obstinate and difficult to cure.
This has been the question which ha
puzzled physicians and dyspepti
alike, until the question was solvec
three years ago by the appearance o
a new dyspepsia cure in the medica
world known as Stuart's Dyspeps
Tablets, which it was claimed was
certain, reliable cure for every for
of stomach trouble.
Physicians, however, woul " not a
cept such .statements without first giv
Ing- the new remedy many tests am
carefully observing results.
For three years the remedy has been
thoroughly tested in every section of
the country and with surprising and
satisfactory results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be
ho'itestly claimed to be a specific, a j
radical lastin- cure for Indigestion In
the various form? of acid dyspepsia or
sour stomach, gas or wind on stomach, i
too much bile, undue fullness or pres-
sure after eating and similar symptoms
resulting from disordered digestion.
Stua-t's Dyspepsia Tablets were not !
placed before the public until this three
years' trial left no doubt as to their
value and they have recently been
placed in the trade and can be found
on sale at all druggists at the nominal ,
price of 50 cents per package.
No extravagant claims are made for :
the remedy. It will not cure rheuma-
tism, pneumonia, typhoid fever nor
anything but just what it is claimed to
cure and that is every form of stomach
trouble.
No dieting is necessary f good whole-
some food and plenty of it and you
may rest assured that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia. Tablets will digest it.
Druggists claim for it that it is a
pleasure to recorr-ienil it t' dyspeptics,
because it o iv' s uch universal satis-
faction.

The British ship Ravenscrag must have had more than her share of "light winds and calms," as she was 187
days making the run from Puget Sound to Callao. She was so long overdue that she was almost given up as
lost, and 90 per cent reinsurance was paid on hull and cargo.
REINSURANCE
MEN HAPPY
The British Ship Ravens
crag Has Arrived
at Callao. >
She Was Long Overdue, and
Ninety Per Cent Was
Paid on the Risk.
Grave Fears Entertained for the
Forest Queen, Now Overdue
at San Pedro.
Therewas Joy In the hearts of the re
insurance gamblers yesterday when the
news arrived that the British ship
Ravenscrag was safe. The vessel was
187 days out from Puget Sound for Cal
lao with a load of lumber, and so sure
wpre her owners that she was gone that
90 per cent reinsurance was paid on
her. Vessels that left the sound for
South America long alter the Ravens
crag had reached their destination, dis
charged their cargoes and sailed again,
but none of them had either seen or
heard of the vessel. The captains all
reported light winds and calms and the
non-arrival of the ship was therefore
all the more puzzling. All doubt was
set at rest yesterday, however, by the
receipt of a cable at the Merchants'
Exchange announcing the arrival of
the missing vessel.
Grave doubts are entertained for the
safety of the bark Forest Queen, now !
out 38 days from Tacoma for San Pc- !
dro. She sailed from the sound with
a load of lumber and after she passed
Cape Flattery it came on to blow very j
hard. Vessels that left the same time |
as the Queen report very heavy weath
er and some of them suffered a great
deal in the blow. The general impres- j
sion is that the bark lost one of her !
spars, and being thus disabled, was j
driven away out of her course and out
of the track of all incoming vessels.
Captain Charles Nelson, her owner, is '
of the opinion that she will turn up all |
right during the next few days. The
Forest Queen is an old vessel, but prior !
to sailing on this voyage she had been j
thoroughly overhauled and put in first- I
class sea-going condition.
Trade with Russia is looking up. The
bark Edward May sailed last Monday
night and the barkentine Addenda sails
in a day or so for Vladivostok, with
cargoes valued at over $70,000. Of this !
sum $31,800 is represented by flour and '
: $5000 by leather, while the Edward May i
has 1150 tons of salt aboard. The two
vossels are bound for the terminus of !
the Trans-Siberian Railway, and a cou- I
pie more ships are shortly to be put on
i the berth for the Amoor River. Nearly
1 all the goods thus sent are used by the
Russians along the line of the railroad
and at Vladivostok.
The Pacific Mail Company's Peru
i sailed for the Orient yesterday with j
twenty cabin passengers, the majority I
!of whom are bound for Honolulu. She j
also took away silver treasure valued
at $83,520.
Herzog & Co., the general passenger
agents for t'.. ! Pacific Coast for the
Hamburg-American line, have re
ceived a dispatch from the head omce
in New York notifying them that the
company has sold to the TTnlted States
the two fleet steamers Normannia and
Columbia, the negotiations for the sale
of which were mentioned in The Call
i several days ago. This disposition of
thes>*> two vessels has made necessary
t the change of a few details in the sail- j
: Ing of their steamers, but it has not in
; any way crippled the carrying capa
city of the company, which still has
sixty-n'ne steamers for the traffic. The
: Columbia and Normannia are of the
i class known as ocean greyhounds.
A Japanese Humorist.
Bundo Washizl, editor of the Japanese
weekly known as the Agohazushi, was
arrested yesterday by the United States
Marshal on an indictment presented by
the United States Grand Jury on a
charge of sending obscene matter through
the mails. The complainant is Miss Viola
A. Dillon, a missionary who edits a de
partment of a rival Japanese periodical
named the Chrysanthemum. Washizl
in a recent Issue of his publication pre
sented to h.j subscribers a cartoon of
Miss Dillon, of a very vile and libelous
nature, accompanied with an explanation
which the Caucasian mind considers ob
scene.

CAUGHT IN THE DOLDRUMS.
SECTION SIX
CERTIFICATES
Judge De Haven Decides
They Are Only Prima
Facie Evidence.
Merchants From China Must
Not Work for Wages at
Manual Labor.
OnÂ« Large Loopholo for Coolies Is
Stopped Effectually by the Opin
ion of the District Court.
"Section 6" certificates, which are so
easily rbtained in Macao and Hongkong
from American and Portuguese Consuls,
will no longer be ranked as "gilt edge"
passports, entitling the bearers to. ad
mission within the limits of the United
States.
These certificates represent the holders
as merchants, and the papers are vised
by the United States Consuls at the port
of issuance. In many instances Chinese
gaining admission to this country on such
certificates as merchants have been found
to drop the exalted title and degenerate
into common laborers.
United States District Judge de Haven
handed down yesterday a decision in the
case of Kg Paak Tan, wiping out the
sacred character of the section 6 certlii
cates, and establishing a precedent that
will be of great assistance to the Chinese
bureau and the Collector of the Port in
keeping out contract coolie labor.
The following is the decision:
"The complaint filed in this court on
January 15, 189S, charges the defendant
with being a Chinese laborer unlawfully
in the United States. The defendant was
permitted to land at the port of San Fran
cisco by the Collector of said port on De
cember 4, 1597, upon presentation of a cer
tificate dated October 27, 1897, identifying
him as a merchant, said certificate being
in conformity with section 6 of the act
of May 6, lf*2, 22 U. S. Stat., 68, as
amended by the act of July B. 1884, 23 U. S.
Stat., 115. This certificate is only prima
facie evidence ot the right of tiie defend
ant to remain in the United States, and
its effect as such is overcome by the other
evidence in this case, showing that de
fendant, immediately after landing in this
country, engaged in manual labor, and so
continued until January 18, 1898, the date
of his arrest in this proceeding. In sup
port of this conclusion, I need only refer
to the case of the United States vs. Yong
Yew. S3 Fed., 882, the opinion in which
contains an able discussion- ot the ques
tion relating to the effect of evidence,
showing that a defendant in this class of
cases has continuously engaged In manual
labor after being permitted to land upon
a certificate like that held by the de
fendant here.
"The exceptions to the report of the
United States Commissioner are over
ruled, and Judgment will be entered that
defendant be deported to China."
THE PRICE OF WINES.
A Board of Trade Committee Will
Confer With the Makers.
Some efforts have been made and failed
to brine the wine grape crowers, the
vintners and winÂ© dealers together in a
policy that will prevent the ruinous cut
ting of prices.
Finally the following correspondence
passed between the State Board of Trade
and interested parties:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., April S, IS9B.
Charles A. Wftmore Eaq., 116 Townsend
street, San Francisco, Cal. â My Dear Kir:
Since seeing you I have had a conference with
some Of the leading members of our board re
garding the matter you talked to me about the
other day, and 1 am heartily assured by them
that your preposition will receive the most
earnest consideration and will be followed up
on any practical lines that you may suggest
looking to remedy of the diflicultles complained
of.
In the meantime, however, I would say to
you that our next meeting: will not be an
opportune time for you to present the matter,
as owing to other important engagements
neither the president. General Chipman, nor
Mr. Mills can be present, and I think in deal-
Ing with a subject so lar-reachlng our board
ought to have the advice of thr>se two gentle
men. Hence, If agreeable to you, I would sug
gest that you defer the matter until the May
meeting, or until such special meeting In the
meantime that may be called by the board for
that special purpose. Truly yours,
.T. A. FILCHEK.
Secretary and Manager.

In your letter. Yours respectfully,

As a result of the forcgrolng, at the
regular session of the State Board of
Trade yesterday, after discussion of the
importance of realizing a living price on
the 30,000.000 gallons of wine to be pro
duced this year, General Chlpman, W. H.
Mills and John P. Irish were appointed
a comnfltteo to confer and advise in the
matter.
THROUGH
A WINDOW
Escape of Counterfeiter
Kendal From a Dep
uty Sheriff.
Eluded the Officers While in
the Office of Attorney
Wilson.
Offioers Are Searching the City With
Every Prospect of Speedily Re
capturing tho Culprit.
Gilbert E. Kendal, the notorious coun
terfeiter, jumped through a window and
escaped from a Deputy Sheriff yesterday
and now every member of Sheriff Whe
lan's force that can be spared from other
duties is scouring the city for him.
Gilbert, who has been awaiting trial In
the Superior Court on charges of coun
terfeiting and passing counterfeit money,
has been confined in the Broadway Jail.
Sheriff Whelan has a rule prohibiting the
removal jof prisoners from j the jail for
the purpose of visiting or consulting with
outsiders, but Kendal's attorney, J. N. E.
Wilson; represented to the Sheriff that
there was a woman in his : office who
would be a valuable witness for the pris
oner, but she refused point blank to
make known her testimony without a con
ference with Kendal:
On these representations Sheriff Whe
lan reluctantly consented to Kendal be
ing taken to Wilson's office, on the cor
ner of McAllister and Larkin streets, op
posite the City Hall, and telephoned to
the Jail to have the prisoner sent to the
Sheriff's office in the van. This was
done, and Kendal, in custody of Deputy
George Code, proceeded to Wilson's office,
which is in the second story of the build
ing. They entered ,an Inner room, in
which there was a window looking out
ffiri?! vacant sand lot, and the woman.
Kendal and Wilson conversed together for
some time.
d 1^ ln , a , lly the conference ended and Code
and the others started to leave the room!
Ihe deputy opened the door and stepped
out, holding it open for the others to
pass through. Kendal â  was close behind
code, h but stepped back as though to al
low the woman to pass flrst and as she
uTrelk for t d h T Way the prisoner made
a break â¢ for the open window in the reai
at fill v"ffÂ« d through,. dropping a distance
ot tull> ntteeu ft 1 ' , Code rushed down
stairs and into the lot, but Kendal had
St the back fence and was out of

Much sympathy is felt for Code for he
is regarded as one of the most trust
hinr^ hy - men^ n the Sheriff's office, and no
blame can be attached to him for the
P thÂ»? he i; lff - Whelan "as a rule? how
ever, that when a deputy loses a prisoner

to have Keru.ul recaptured, for it was at
Â«i? ance J hat the prisoner was in the
Sheriffs custody, it is the custom . for
the police to turn over all counterfeiting
cases to the United States authorities for
prosecution under. the Federal laws, but
the Chief determineu to prosecute Kendal
under the State law. Kendal was captured
in his room at 424 G-Ue avenue
some weeks ago. and the police found a
complete set of counterfeiting implements
In his room. It Is supposed, mat Kenaal
was the one who manufactured bogus $5
Pieces and that confederates circulated
them throughout the interior.

DISREPUTABLE HOUSES.
Owner and Occupant of Two Houses
on Mason Street to Be
Arrested.
The property-owners on Mason street,
between Eddy and Ellis, seem determined
to rid the street of disreputable houses.
There Is a case pending in Judge Conlan's
court against Tiiln Belmont, and yester
day W. If. McCarthy, owner of the Lang
ham Hotel building, swore to a complaint
in Judge Joachimsen's court for the ar
rest of Mollie Woouward, who occupies
111 and 113.
McCarthy went turther, and also swore
to a complaint charging Mrs. Carmen
Dunpny. the owner of the two houses,
with violating an ordinance in letting
them for disreputable purposes.
Will of Thomas J. Bass.
The will of the late Thomas J. Bass,
who died at Sausallto on the 17th ult.,
has been filed for probate. The eatate,
which Is of unknown value. Is left to the
widow, Mrs. Ellen Bass, who Is also
mimed as executrix, to serve without
bonds. No provision Is made for the
children, the tostatoT beinff satisfied that
they will be amply provided for by their
mother.
The Death Rate.
The monthly statement of vital statis
tics, issued by the Health Department,
shows the death rate for March to have
been 600. the heaviest for the correspond
ing month for twelve years. The highest
death rate In any one month during that
period was in January. 1890, when it

Two Policemen Chase end Captara
the Footpad, Who Is Charged
With Robbery.
Daniel Connolly, a machinist, was at
tacked by a footpad at Seventh and Bry- /
ant streets at an early hour yesterday "
morning and robbed of his purse, con
taining $13 95.
Connolly had been drinking and waa on
the way to his home at 4SS^ Eighth street
about 5 o'clock in the morning, when a â 
man accosted him at Seventh and Bry
ant streets and asked him for a match.
As Connolly was feeling in his pocket for
the match he was struck on the head with!'.
a club and felled to the ground. The rob
ber quickly went through his pockets and
took the purse.
Connolly yelled for the police as the
robber ran away, and Policemen Staples
and Gibbons responded. They saw a man
running along Bryant street â  toward
Eighth and soon overtook him. He waa
taken back to Connolly, who at once
identified him as the man who- robbed â¢
him. The robber was sent to the City
Prison, where he gave the name of T. J.
Monaghan. a laborer. He was booKed on
n charge of robbery, and when the. case
was called In Judge Low's court yester
day morning it was continued for a week.
The police found the purse and money â¢Â»
in a vacant lot close to the scene of the
robbery, where it had evidently been '
thrown I", Monaghan after Connolly

Prospects That Creditors Will Be

Lb W. McGlauflin, one of the best
known grain merchants of the city, who
failed some years ago, yesterday an-
L. W. McGLAUFLIN, the Well-Known Grain Merchant, Who
Announces That Hi Has Been Forced to the Wall.
nounced that he would be forced to sus
pend business again. He is closing up
his affairs and says he hopes to be able
to arrange matters in a way satisfac
tory to his creditors.
It Is not known Just how deeply in
volved the grain merchant is, though
he says he thinks he will be able to ar
range matters in such a way as to sat
isfy his creditors, if he is given time.
He says some of his heaviest custom
ers have become temporarily embar
rassed and could not respond to his call
for money. As he was dealing as a
commission man this involved him in
trouble, which led to the present dif
ficulty.
The announcement of the financial
difficulties of Mr. McGlauflin caused a
great deal of surprise on the street, as
it was '.veil known that he had been
long on the market, having bought a
large amount of wheat and barley
which he is not known to have sold.
McGlauflin gained considerable no
toriety three years ago when there was
a great deal of excitement fiver what
was known as the Fair wheat deal, an
attempt to corner the wheat market of
the State. He was at that time a part
ner of E. A. Bresse, who is still in busi
ness, being one of the heaviest dealers
on the floor of the exchange. Bresse
has had no connection with McOlauflin
for three years, as the men disagreed
about business methods.
It was generally understood at the
time of the great deal that McGlauflin
handled it. All of the grain in the
warehouses at Port Costa was bought
up and held. The entire supply held
by the four largest linns in this State
â Eppinger & Co., McNear, Balfour,
Guthrie & Co., Baldwin, Girvin & Eyre
â waa bought up, as well as every
bushel of wheut available.
Pair invested about six millions of
dollars in the deal and purchased more
than two hundred thousand tons of
wheat. The wheat was held until the
market went to $1 80, but as Fair had
built it to that price himself he could
not find buyers and was forced to let
it go at a heavy lnss.
It is the general opinion that the fail
ure of McGlauflin is for reasons known
chiefly to himself and not affecting the
general market. From all indications
the failure will not affect others and
there will be little suffering in the local
field as a result.

ThÂ« Manufacturers" and Producers' As
tlon now has a president. A. Sbar
boro took compassion upon the president
less organization and consented to accept
all of the honors and some of the labor
that goes with the position, for the mem
bers had promised to relieve Its presiding
Officer of some of the work that has here
tofore gone with the office. This action
took place at the meeting held yesterday
Manager Oscar Lewis infornifd*th<- board
of the adverse decision of Judge Wallace
in the pure-food case that was before
him several days ago. That decision prac
tically makes the iaw Inoperative for a
year, or until it can be modified by the
mxt Legislature. I'pon the suggestion of
J. \Y. Kerr it was decided to hold a pure
food meeting before long, the meeting to
be composed of the members of the asso
ciation, the Board of Health and Attorney
Dunne, who rÂ« presented the people ha the
recent case mentioned, to see what, if
anything, can be done in making use of
the law as it stands.
Considerable time was consumed In the
discussion of the matter of transportation
on the railroads of freights to and from
the East. The association some time ago
prepared a schedule of some of the arti
cles that can be shipped from the East to
this coast at a much less rate than they
can be sent from this coast to the East.
Some of the directors were not in favor
of having this sheet published, fearing
that it might offend the railroad people
and that such a fight properly belongs to
the hardware men and jobbers. Others
thought that the whole people and par
ticularly the members should be in
formed of the inequality, so- that concert
ed action could be taken to rectify
matters.
F. L. Brown, who represented the asso
ciation at the recent convention of rail
road men in Monterey, told of his efforts
in the interests of better dealings for the
Western manufacturers and shippers. He
said that he believes that the Southern
Pacific Company would do much better
for the people of this coast, but in the
convention it was not all-powerful and
the Eastern roads' representatives were
working hard in the interests of the
Eastern manufacturers, with plenty of
money and influence at their backs.
Working for Better Roads.
The board of directors or tne uooa
Roads League of California met yester
day, and the secretary reported that there
are now twenty-five organized leagues In
as many counties in the State. It was de
cided that the league will give its as
sistance, support and influence at the
next Legislature to all of the road laws
that passed through both houses of the
Legislature and which were vetoed by
Governor Budd. It will have plenty of
friends at Sacramento who will resurrect
the old measures. The directors decided
to send the brightest of the members of
its many branch leagues to the super
visorial convention that is to be held in
Napa on May 17, to work in the interest
of better roads In the country.
The Scott Will Contest.
The trial of the contest over the pro
bating of the will of the late Mrs. Angelia
R. Scott, who left a valuable estate but
practically disinherited her husband, was
resumed yesterday before Judge Coffey.
The contestants closed their case and the
beneficiaries under the will asked for a
judgment of non-suit, claiming that the
evidence adduced did not show that the
testatrix was of unsound mind at the
time she had the will drawn. Judge Coffey
denied the motion and directed the pro
ponents to introduce their testimony.
THE HOTTEST DAY
OF LOCAL RECORD
It Was the Warmest for This
Time of the Year Ever
Known.
The Spell Likely to Continue, With
No Prospect of Any
Rain.
The official records of the Weather i
Bureau show that yesterday was the j
hottest day upon record for any corre- I
sponding day of the same time of the
year ever known in the city of San Fran
cisco, the thermometer registering at 1
o'clock yesterday afternoon 87.7 degrees, j
This was the highest point reached dur
ing the day.
Old Sol arose early yesterday morning,
wiped Ms eyes, rolled up his sleeves and |
let it be generally known among the less j
fiery satellites of the solar system that |
he was out for business. He softly i
whistled to himself the suggestive re- j
frain about there being "A Hot Time in i
the Old Town To-Night," and immediately i
began to pay his respects to terra firma
In no uncertain way. As a result there ;
wan a sudden and decided rise in mer
cury, and the stock of the North Amer
ican Consolidated Thermometer Com- |
pany, limited, took a general upward
jump.
The summer girl made a blushing debut,
and the seashore shirtwaist and hat were
to be. seen uuon the streets in all their
glory. The ni< n of business sweltered in
their offices, eyed the thermometer with
boiling indignation and kept the office j
boy busy rushing the "growler." The
pedestrians sought the shady side of the i
streets and exchanged hopeless but nvm- I
pathetic glances, realizins that a com- I
nion misery is lessened by the knowl
edge "that there are others."
Down at the Weather Bureau the fore
caster was busy recording hot things
from all over the State. At 5 o'clock in
the morning the thermometer stood at 66 :
degrees, at 8 o'clock it was a half degree j
cooler, and there was a general hope that
the warm spell was breaking-, but it
proved to be only one of Sol's bluffs, for
at 10 o'clock it was 76 degrees. An hour
later it had climbed up another degree, 1
and at noon the thermometer stood at an
even 80 degrees. Then things began to
get warm in earnest, for at 1 o'clock there
came the record-breaking 87.7 degrees. At I
2:30 o'clock it was 85.7 and at 3:20 o'clock
it was 86.8 degrees.
At present there are no indications of
a change. It may be cooler in the city |
this afternoon if there is a fog. The re- |
ports from all over the State indicate '
the warm weather is generally prevailing, i
with no rain. There wa.s a very light fall I
of rain at Yuma yesterday, but not \
enough to do any good. The weather
here to-day will be as warm as yester
day, with the prospects of even a greater
rise in the mercury. On April 14, 1888
there? was 88 degrees registered in the
city.
The high northern pressure is still pre
vailing with a slight depression gathering
along the. northern hn!f of the Pacific
slope. There is no prospect for rain.

VERY EXPENSIVE WATER
They Put Spring Valley Into Bonded
Stamped Barrels and All the Li
quor May Be Confiscated.
A tall, smooth-faced young man, with
a guileless expression of countenance and
with the suave manners of an Easterner,
walked into the California saloon, kept
by A. M. Fink, on the corner of Pine ana
Market streets last Monday morning and
asked for a glass of whisky
"Straight goods," he added, with a wink
characteristic of a connoisseur.
Mr. Fink smiled and affectionately
patted a fat barrel with his right hand,
while he held the glass in nib xeft.
"I've some fine stuff here," he said;
"only two days out of the United States
bonded warehouse. See the stamps?
Pure from the distillery. No better goods
in town."
The young man became deeply inter
ested.
"Yes, sne's stamped all right," he said,
after a swift glance at tne barrel. "The
whisky is all right, too,'" ha added, as
he slowly and critically drained the glass,
which had received sonic of the contents
of the barrel. "But it seems to me that
it's nut 106 pr^ot. '
â¢â Nobody could drink whisky that ,
strong," commented the saloon man. "it
has been mixed with a little Spring
Valley."
"By the way," inquired 1 the young man,
"have you any mure of that stull? It's
line whisky."
"I have nine barrels more down in the
cellar."
"Then I'll go down and see them," said
the stranger. "My name is H. K. Towne,
and I'm a special internal revenue agent.
i have business with those barrels wear-
Ing the Government stamp."
Ho showed, his autnority, and was
ushered into the cellar, where he found
the nine barrels bearing the Government
stamps certifying - that they ! had ' been
taken directly out of bond and that the
contents weie spirits of so much proof.
l"he contents were tested in the 'usual
way, and Special Agent Towne announced
that he would seize the lot of ten barrels,
lio explained that Government internal
revenue stamps and marks meant what
they said, ana that it was a violation of
law, punishable ; by connstation of I the
goods, for any person to dilute or other
wise tamper with the contents ;of the
barrels while said contents. remained in
the barrels. They could be drawn oil
into a demijohn or any old receptacle and
Spring- V alley ed, but not in the original
package. besides, Mr. Fink had no li
cense as a rectifier. â¢ '
The barrels were seized to await the
action of internal Revenue Collector
Lynch and the authorities at Washington.
Mr. Pink said yesterday he was un
aware that he was violating any regula
tion of the Internal Revenue Department;
that he had been in the saloon business
for only two months and was not In
formed as to the Federal laws regulating
Ins business. lie had made a similar ex
planation t'Â» Mr. Lynch, and hoped that
ne would be let off with a line instead of
being so severely punished as the con
fiscation of ten barrels of whisky would
certainly do. It was the custom
of the department to be lenient in cases
where the accused showed, as in this
case, an absence of malicious intent.
The smooth-faced young man went
elsewhere, and seized barrels of whisky
by the score. He caught one barrel in the
establishment of an old-timer a block be
low and left a trail of desolated saloon
ke. pers up Market street and into Larkin.
By this time the saloon men in other
parts of the city were in a state of panic,
Che news having been carried to them on
the beardless raider, and there wa.s ciuite
a boom in the live and ten gallon demi
john business to get the helow-proof
Whisky out of the original packages.
But Mr. Towne changed his tactics yes
terday, and left for the Los Angeles
country, where, if rumor is to be believed,
the whisky is as weak as a one-lunged
cat.
Mr. Lynch has submitted a report of
Mr. Towne's campaign to the department
in Washington, and has also transmitted
the offers of compromise made by the
trembling and repentant victims.
All eyes are now turned on Los Angeles.
POOLROOMS MUST CLOSE.
The Merchants' Association Taking
Active Steps Against the Evil.
The Merchants' Association is thor
i oughly in earnest in the matter of clos
j ing the pool rooms in this city, as shown
! by resolutions passed at a meeting of the
I board yesterday. At a special meeting
I held several days ago the manager, Mr.
King, was instructed to ascertain the lo
cation of every such place and the names
of the owners of the property and those
who conduct that class of business. King
made his report a strong resolution, of
which the following is a part, which was
passed:
"Whereas, The existence of said pool
room** is demoralizing to the whole com
munity and is tending to corrupt the
clerks and employes of the merchants
and other business men of San Fran
cisco, and whereas, the Merchants' Asso
ciation has determined to close said pool
rooms, if it is possible to do soruhere
fore, be it
"Resolved, That the attorney of the
Merchants' Association is directed to in
form the owners and tenants of the prem
ises used as pool rooms to close the same
as such within thirty (30) days from
April 15, IS9B, and in the event any owner,
agent or tenant declines to comply with
this request, the attorney is authorized
to proceed legally against them in order
to carry out the intents and purposes of
this association, and be it further
"Resolved, That a copy of these reso
lutions be furnished to the owners, agents
and tenants of said pool rooms."
Now that the matter has been placed
in the hands of Attorney J. R. Freud. It
is believed that the poolsellers will take
the hint and cease operations without
making much trouble. The owners of the
property on which such business is con
ducted are not likely to throw much op
position in the way of the movement of
reform if they think the association will
bring them into unpleasant notoriety in
the event of their neglect to comply with
the merchants' demand. The directors
believe that within a month every pool
room will be closed without the neces
sity of resorting to legal measures.

SAN JOSE REAL ESTATE.
Foreclosure of a Mortgage to Se
cure Money Loaned by the
University.
A regular session of the regents of the
State University was held at the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art yesterday. The
names of the new regents, A. B. Spreck
els and James D. Phelan, were called by
the secretary when the board convened
in the forenoon. Shortly after the session
began Mayor Phelan took his seat. The
reading of the report of the linance com
mittee was temporarily suspended to
give Mr. Hallidie an opportunity to in
troduce Mr. Phelan to the board. The
Mayor bowed his acknowledgment and
took his seat. Mr. Spreckels, who suc
ceeds C. M. Chase, did not attend the
session yesterday.
The regents allowed some bills for ad
vertising and other expenses in connec
tion with a foreclosure of mortgage. It
appears that the university has fore
closed on Improved property in the city
of San Jose. The individual to whom the
money was loaned was not able to pay
the sum of 190,000, hence the regents fore
clbsed the mortgage on his premises.
The finance committee reported that the
premises at 116 Setter street had been
leased to J. M. Snyder.
The endowment fund of the university
is now $1,941,000. The tw>> million mark
may soon be reached. A big depreciation
in the value of real estate might, how
ever, give the regents a setback in their
calculutioi c .
Regent Hallidie made his usual motion
yesterday to go into executive session. J.
West Martin, who was presiding, did not
direct the newspaper reporters to re
main, hence tli< Regents had the room
to themselves, n was announced at the
recess that the budget was discussed, as
Mr. Hallidie had suggested, and that sev
eral professors askea for an increase of
compensation. No definite action was
taken on tin' budget.
.President Kellogg sprung a surprise at
the afternoon H<-.-!t>!i by reading a com
munication from Professor tjenaoberie,

judgment unhesitatingly decides that there Is

"With best wishes for the future of the Uni
versity of California, In particular the Lick
Observatory, its past director, its new di
rector and all the astronomers who are or
have been connected with the same, I hereby
resign my position .as astronomer in the Lick
Observatory, the resignation to take effect on
the day of expiration "of my term of office as
acting director of the Lick Observatory. Very
sincerely, '. â  J. M. SCHAEBERLE.
. Regent Denicke at the conclusion of, its
reading arose and read the following mo
tion, which was unanimously adapted:
I beg to move, first, that the president of the
university express to Professor Schaeberle our
high appreciation of his valuable services . to
science and our great reluctance to consider
the resignation of one who has added so much
to the reputation of our great obaervatoiy; sec
ond, that Professor Schaeberle be urged to re
consider his resignation; third, that his untir
ing efforts on behalf of the observatory are
gratefully acknowledged, and that In view of
the fact that during a service of' nearly ten
years he has not applied for an extended leave
of absence, excepting when in charge of the
eclipse expedition, leave of absence of one
year, with full pay, be offered him for rest
and recreation.
In seconding the motion Judge Slack
said: "I am afraid Processor Schaeberle
has felt too sensitive about this matter
and hope he may be induced to withdraw
his resignation. I hope for the good of
the university that he will do so."
Chairman Phelps then read a commun
ication from acting Director Schaeberle
in which he informed the board that on
Sunday morning last Mr. Perrine discov
ered another comet,- breaking - the record
for consecutive discoveries ,of that na
ture by _ the same observatory;, and, that
all the comets since October, IS9G, six in
number, had been discovered at the Lick
Observatory by Mr. Perrine. Mr. Phelps
said he was pleased : to remark that it
gave him great pleasure to hear this and
that Mr. Perrine * deserved great credit
for the result of his observation. He sug
gested that the communication be spread
upon the minutes,- which was adopted.
i Professor Kellogg informed the regents
that he had notified Professor Keeler of
his appointment by letter and telegram
and that the latter had asked for two
weeks' time to accept, as his university
had offered him flattering terms to stay.
He then read a â¢ formal : letter 'of accept
ance from. the well-known astronomer in
which he thanks the regents for the
honor they, have done him and giving as
surances that he; will conduct the obser
vatory, in a manner that will keep up its
high reputation, and that he leaves Al
legheny with >. the best : wishes of every
body also stating that his resignation as
director: of the Allegheny Observatory
takes effect on. the last day. of April, and
that he expects . to be lat â¢ Mount Hamil
ton by June 1. In concluding he says:
"In case the people of California are dis
posed to regard me as an outsider, I must
remind them that my father was a forty
niner." The : communication . was . placed

The question of allowing Lieutenant
Cloman permission to occupy one of the
cottages on the . university grounds with

was laid over for consideration - at the

As a question has -been raised â Â« as -to

UKIAH'S HANDSOME STRUCTURE.
T\)e Stately New Administration Building Designed as an Annex to trje
Mendocino Asylun) for the Insane.
The State Board of Trustees for the control of State asylums for the insane has adopted plans and
specifications for the erection of an administration building for the Mendocino Asylum at Ukiah, for which
the last Legislature appropriated $60,000.
The style of architecture adopted is Romanesque, of a somewhat modified form, and the material to be
used in the construction of the exterior will be red pressed brick with red sandstone trimmings.
The handsome structure when completed will have a general elevation of fifty-eight feet, a frontage of
one hundred and thirty feet and a depth of seventy-two feet, the whole being surmounted by a tower one
hundred and twenty feet high.
Of the three floors into which the building Is divided the first will be devoted to the offices of the In
stitution, a reception room, room for the board of managers and a general dining room. The second floor
is to be used exclusively for the living apartments of the physicians and their families, the third floor be
ing utilized as a day room and dormitory for patients.
The plans and specifications adopted were those submitted by Cunningham Brothers of Oakland, who
estimate the cost of construction to be $56,000.
The members of the board are: A. W. Foster of San Francisco, Senator Seawell of Mendocino, Dr. M.
Gardner, surgeon of the Southern Pacific Company; J. C. Ruddock and J. T. White of Ukiah.
blamed If the specifications were faulty,
as he did not prepare them. After some
time had been taken up in questioning the
colonel, the matter was referred to the
committee on buildings and grounds.
J. K. Moffitt's donation of $100, to be
used in purchasing books for the library,
was then taken up and Regent Slack
offered a resolution ranking him for the
gift, which was unanimously carried.
During the reading of the report of the
committee .on grounds and buildings in
reference to an additional extension Of
the mining laboratory, Mrs. Phebe Hearst
arose and offered to defray the expense
of building the additional equipment. As
this will amount to nearly $12,000, her offer
was received with applause.
The resignations of T. F. Sedgwick and
Joseph Earls were accepted.
A communication was received from
Mayor Phelan, as chairman of the citi
zens' committee on site for the Wilmerd
ing School of Industrial Training, in
which he reported that ...le deed to the
tract had been filed with the regents. A
list of the donors accompanied the lette.r,
and on motion the contents of b0... were
spread on the minutes and a suitable
acknowledgment will be made to the don
ors. Regent Phelan was then appointed
a member of tne Wilmerding School and
library committees, in place of Regent
Marye.
Regent Reinsteln read a communication
to the board from the. Alaska Commercial
Company. Jn which they offered the uni
versity their priceless collection of curios
gathered in the norther-i zone, and which
is second only to the Smithsonian collec
tion. On motion, Mr. Reinsteln was di

Suspension of the Pacific Mastiff
Clubâ E. J. Bull Wih Not
Judge Greyhounds.
The San Francisco Kennel Club will
have "a few hummers" out against it
this year. The club will hold its annual
bench show in May, and it expects to
meet with the same flattering success
that crowned its efforts last season not
withstanding the slings and arrows that
are being aimed at it by some of the
disgruntled kennel men. The following
letter to The Call from J. P. Norman,
secretary of the Pacific Mastiff Club, is
self-explanatory :
13ELMONT, April 11. IS9B.
Editor of The Call: The news has Just been
received by the directors of the Pacific Mas
tiff Club of their suspension by the American
Kennel Club. The reason assigned for this
action is the Issuance of an official invitation
fey the club to the clubs on t'-~ coast to Join a
convention for the purpose of discussing' the
advisability of prompt secession from the
American Kennel Club. Of course this overt I.
act of rebellion was not to be tolerated by the
powers that be, hut the suspension must of
necessity fall to the ground in view of the
rescinding by the Pacific Ma- '.lff Club of the
offending resolution on Saturday last, as pub
lished exclusively In The Call on Sunday.
In this connection, It will be of Interest to
print the preamble and resolutions, whereby
the resolution In favor of secession was re- j
scinded, viz.: "Whereas, this club has re- j
eeived from the secretary ot the American :
Kennel Club the assurance that the Pacific
Mastifl Club litter* were duly communicated
to the rules committee of the American Ken- |
r.el Club, and as â are now informed, were
thereby treated in the manner customary with
such letters; and wnereas, this clui> mua mis
led by the omission from the Kennel Ga
zette's official report of any mention of such â¢
reference to the rules committee; and whereas, i
this club regrets that Its letters were not read
In open meeting, in support of Captain C. H.
Knocker's resofction, notwithstanding that the
same were in the possession of th.> rules com
mlttee, yet in view of the explanation ten- â 
dered by the secretary of the American Ken- I
nel Club, be it resolved that the Pacific Mas
tiff Club accept me explanation of Mr. A. P.
Vredenbergh, the secretary of the American
Kennel Club, and hereby rescind the resolu
tion referring to the American Kennel Club,
passed at the monthly meeting held March 10."
The opposition to the San Francisco Bench
show by one of the local fox terrier men is
but a futile repetition In another form of last
year's attempted obstruction. There is no doubt
that the malcontent "111 have the support of
those breeders who ;uv never Battened unless;
they have the control of everything in sight, j
but there is no prospect that the opposition

developed will be strong enough td hurt tha
show. Last year one of the most inlluontlal
clubs on the coast absolutely boycotted the
show, yet the number of dogs fancied by this
same specialty club, exhibited by outside own
ers, exceeded the number shown when the
show was favored by the club, and so it will
be this year. The directors of the San Fran
cisco Club, men such as H. J. Crocker, Dr T
W. IVKvdyn, A. 15. Spreckels, and other well
known gentlemen of the directorate have ehos-:-n
a judge well end favorably known the world
over. The choice of suoh a judge by such men
should of itself be sufficient guarantee of tha
judee'p ability and integrity. The San Fran
cisco Bench Show will be a success, all the
greater for the petty and spiteful opposition to
It. Tours truly, J. p. NORMAN.
E. J. Bull, the popular coursing judpe
of Union Coursing- Park, has positively
informed The Call that he cannot accept
the invitation to judjre greyhounds at the
San Francisco Bench Show. Mr. Bull
that although he may be able to
judge coursing to the satisfaction of the
patrons of the leash, he may prove a rank
failure so far as the judging of grey
hounds on the bench is concerned. The
San Francisco Kennel Chib must select
some other person to judge greyhounds.

SECTION 1. All streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts in the City and Coun
ty, now open or dedicated or which

this Chapter; and tii.i Supervisors are
hereby empowered to fix the width
and grade thereof, and to order to be
done therein and thereon any and all
street work and street improvement
under the proceedings hereinafter de
scribed.
Sec. 2. Application for the doing of
any such work or improvement must i
in the first instance, except where â 
otherwise provided in this Article, be l
made in writing to the Board of Pub

Is to be assessed upon private property,
the Board shall investigate the same;
and if it determine that such improve
ment is expedient, it shall so report to
the Supervisors; and the Supervisors
shall not order any such improvement
until the same has been recommended
by said Board. "When the construction

cost of more than five dollars per lineal
foot for any block, it shall not be au
thorized except by an or nance passed
by the affirmative vote of not less than
fourteen members of the Board of Su
pervisors. If an application is made
for any work or improvement of which
the expense is to be paid by the City
and County, and the Board of Public
Works shall not approv s of such appli
cation, it shall report to the Supervis
ors its reasons ror such disapproval,
and the Supervisors may then, after
having obtained from the Board of
Public Works an estimate of the ex
pense of said work or improvement,
by ordinance passed by the affirmative
vote of not less than fourteen members
of the Board of Supervisors, order the
doing of said work, or the making of
said improvement.
The Board of Public Works may also,
except as herein prohibited, recommend
any improvement, the expense of which
is to be paid by the City and County,
though no application may have been
made therefor, and must make, with
said recommendation to the Supervis
ors, an estimate of the expense, and in
such case the Supervisors may order
the same done.
No street work or street improve
ments of any kind shall be ordered to
be done by the Supervisors unless a
â written recommendation to do the
same has been made to them by the
Board of Public Works, and all suefi
recommendations shall be made mat
ters of record in the office of said
Board.
When the Board shall recommend any
work to be done on a street intersect,,
tion Cr crossing, where the streets do
not intersect each other at right angles,
it shall in each such case determine
what lots in the blocks adjacent to such
intersection or cro. ing will -c benefit
ed by said work, and shall cause a
map to be made on which shall be
delineated the lots pa to be benefited.
Such map shall "be transmitted to the
Supervisors with said recommenda
tion.
Sec. 3. Before recommending to the
Supervisors the ordering of any work
or improvement, the expense of which,
or any part thereof, is to be assessed
upon private property, the Board of
Public Works shall pass a resolution of
its intention to recommend the same,
specifying the work to be recommend
ed, and shall fix a day when It shall
take final action upon said resolution.
Upon the passage thereof the Secre
tary of the Board shall forthwith, with
out any further authority, cause a copy
of said resolution to be posted conspic
uously for five days in the office of said
Secretary', and to be published for a
period of ten days (legal holidays ex
cepted) and cause a copy to be deposit
ed in the Post Office at the City and
County, with postage prepaid, address
ed to each person represented on the
Assessment Book of the City and
County for the next preceding fiscal
year as being owner of land liable to be
assessed for said improvement; but if
said lot stand on said book in the name
of unknown owners, such notice need
not be sent.
The Board shall also cause to be con
spicuously posted along the line of said
contemplated improvement, at points
not more than one hundred feet in dis
tance apart, notices, not less than
three in all, of the passage of said reso
lution. Each of said notices shall be
headed "Notice of Street Work" in let
ters of not less than two inches in
length, and shall in legible characters
state the fact of the passage of said
resolution, its date, and. briefly, theta
work or improvement proposed, and re-^
fer to the resolution of intention for
further particulars.
Sec. 4. The owners of a majority of
the frontage of the pro- rty fronting
on said proposed work or improvement,
and, In case of a district, hose owningmore than one-half of the superficial
area of the district, may make written
objections to the same within ten days
after the expiration of the time of the
publication of s>aid resolution of inten
tion, which objections shall be delivered
to the Secretary of the Board of Public
Works, who shall endorse thereon the
date of its reception by him. Such ob
jections shall be a bar for six months
to any further proceedings in relation
fto the doing of said work or making
said improvement, unless the owners of
' the one -half or more of. the frontage or
of the district, as aforesaid, shall
meanwhile petition lor the same to be
done, and the same shall, after the ex
piration of said six months, be contin
ued under the resolution of intention
first passed if said Board shall deem
proper. If, however, the owners of at
leaÃt two-thirds of the property front
ing on said proposed work or improve
ment, and, in the case of a district,
those owning at least two-thirds of the
superficial area of the district, ehall
make written objections to the
Bajne within said six months, no fur
ther proceedings shall be taken under
the aforesaid resolution of intention.
When the work or improvement pro
posed to be done is the construction of
sewers, manholes, culverts or cess
pools, and tho objections thereto are
signed by the owners of a maiorlty of
the frontage or of the district as afore
said, the Board shall, at Its next meet-
ing, fix a time for hearing raid objec
tions, not lees than one week there
after. The Secretary shall thereupon
notify the persons making such objec
tions, by depositing: a notice thereof In
the Post ( >ffice at the City and County,
postage prepaid, and addressed to each
objector or his agent when he appears
for such objector. At the time speci
fied the Board shall hear the objections
urged, and pass upon the same, and its
decision shall be final and conclusive:
and If said objections are overruled the
proceedings, shall be .continued as
though no objections had been made.
At any time before the making of
the assessment as hereinafter provid
ed, all owners of lots of land liable to
assessment therein, who, after the first
publication of the aforesaid resolution
of intention, may feel aggrieved, or
who may have objections to any pro
ceedings in relation to the performance
of the work described in said resolu
tion, may file with the Secretary a pe
tition of remonstrance, wherein they
shall state in what respect they feel
aggrieved, or the proceedings to which
they object. Such petition or remon
strance shall be passed upon by the
Board, and its decision thereon shall
be final and conclusive.
Sec 5. When the contemplated work
or improvement in the opinion of the
Board of Public Works is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the
expense of such work or Improvement
be made chargeable upon a district,
and said Board shall in its res
olution of intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
and to be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to
be benefited by said work or improve
ment may be made by any interested
party, in writing, within ten days af
ter the expiration of the time of pub
lication of the resolution of intention.
The Secretary of the Board shall lay
said objections before it and the Board
shall, at its next meeting, fix a time
for hearine sa!4 objections not less
than one week thereafter. The Secre
tary shall thereupon notify the persons
making such objections by depositing
a notice thereof in the Post Office at the
City and County, postage prepaid, ad
dressed to each objector. At the time
specified the Board shall hear the ob
jections urged and pass upon the same,
and if said objections are overruled, its
decision shall be final and conclusive
as to the extent and boundaries of the
district
If the objections are sustained, the
Board shall proceed to set out another
district to the extent and boundaries
of which objections may be made and
a hearing had thereon as above pro
vided; and so on in like manner until
a district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob
jections shall be overruled by the Board
âits decision in that behalf to be final
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro
ceedings shall continue the same as if
no objections had been made. In its
report to the Supervisors the Board
shall accompany its report with a dia
gram on which shall be delineated each
separate lot, piece or parcel of land.
the area in square feet of each of such
lots, pieces or parcels of land, and the
relative location of the same to thÂ«
work or improvement proposed to bo

Such diagram shall be certified to be
correct by the Secretary of the Board.
Sec. 6. When the work under any
contract shall have been completed, the
contractor shall make and file in the
office of the Board of Public Works

not entered into any private agree
ment, verbal or written, with any per
son liable to be assessed for said work,
or with any one on his behalf, to ac
cept a price from him less than the
price named in said contract, or to
make any rebate or deduction to him
from such price. Any such agreement
shall be deemed a fraud upon all per
sons liable to be assessed for such
â¢work other than the property owners
who were parties to the agreement, and
shall make void, as to such persona so
defrauded, any assessment made for
the work done under such contract; and
where there is more than one contractor
each contractor shall make such affi
davit.
Sec. 7. When any work In or upon
any public street shall have been com

therefor, together with any incidental
expenses, the rate per front fout as
sessed, the amount of each assessment,

known to the Board, and if not known,
the word "unknown" shall be written
opposite the number of the lot and the
amount assessed thereon); the number
of each lot assessed, and shall have at
tached thereto a diagram exhibiting
the street or street crossing on which
the; work has been done, and showing
the relative location of each distinct
lot tothe work done, numbered to cor
respond with the numbers in the as
sessment, and Knowing the number of
front feet assessed for Paid work. A
mistake in the name of the owner shall
not Invalidate any assessment.
When the expense of such work falls
in part upon any person, company or
corporation having railroad tracks
upon the street where such work haa
been done, said assessment shall in
clude an assessment against eaid per
son, company or corporation, for its
legal proportion of said expense, and
the same shall constitute a lien upon
the road-bed, rolling stock, franchises
and other property of such person,
company or corporation, for a period
of two years from the date of record
ing the warrant, assessment and dia
gram hereinafter provided for.
Sec. 8. The expense of all work or

Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex

ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record
ing of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons interested In said
at;sf Ksment shall be deemed to have no
tice of the contents of the record
thereof.
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall

of the incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as

conti actor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re

"When it shall appear by the final
jur\<rment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render suoh judg
ment, that any suit brought to foreclose
tho lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, irregularity, or ii!e-
KfTuy, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant To
any f uch assessment, or in the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with
i*i seven months after the entry of said
final judgment, apply to tha Hoard for
another assessment to be Issued In con
formity to law; and the Hoard shall,
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make ami deliver to
said applicant a new assessmant, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate

two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said Hen as provided in this Chapter.
Bhould such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as

of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons so assessed, or
the^r agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is

behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat

mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid in whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shall
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff in
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
ment upon the books of its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
were issued. If any contractor shall
fail to return his warrant within the
time and in the form provided In this
section he shall thenceforth have no
Hen upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon
which a return may be made with the

so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum until paid.

correctness or legality of the assess
ment or other act, determination, or

AH the decisions and determinations
of the Supervisors, upon notice and
hearing as aforesaid, shall be final and

section, as to all errors, informalities
and irregularities, which the Supervis
ors might have remedied and avoided;
and no assessment shall be held in
valid, except upon appeal to the Su

lars in addition to the taxable costs,
as attorney's fees, but not any percent

been brought, after a personal demand
has been made and a refusal to pay
such assessment so demanded, the
plaintiff shall also be entitled to have
and recover said sum of fifteen dollars
as attorney's fees in addition to all tax
able costs, notwithstanding that the
suit may be settled or a tender be
made before a recovery in said action,
and he may have judgment therefor.

such improvement requires the con
demnation of private property, and tha
Board shall by resolution determine
that the improvement would be of pub
lic benefit; it shall make an estimate
of the expense of such improvement,
and determine by resolution the district
which will be affected by, and should
be assessed for, the expense of such im
provement. No proceedings shall ba
had upon the filing of such petition un
til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary
of the Board an amount of money
which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
the expense that may be incurred in,
case the Supervisors shall not pass an,
ordinance for said improvement.
Sec. 2. If within three months after
the passage of the resolution determin
ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district
who shall also be the owners of two
thirds of the superficial square feet of
the property included within said dis
trict, and of three-fourths in value of
said property â including improvement*
thereon â estimating said value accord
ing to the last preceding Assessment
Book of the City and County, shall
present to the Board a petition for said
improvement, verified by their oath 3
and describing the lands of which they
are the owners, and showing the
amount at which the same was as
sessed upon the last preceding Assess
ment Book of the City and County, and
stating that they are the owners and
in possession of the lands named in said
petition, the Board shall pass a reso
lution of its intention to recommend
such improvement to the Supervisors,
and shall in such resolution specify a
day upon which it will hear any ob
jections that may be made to such im
provement.
Before passing such resolutibn of in
tention, the Board shall cause to be
prepared a map or diagram of the dis
trict affected by and to be assessed for
the expense of such improvement, upon,
which shall be delineated the several
lots of land upon which said assess

of land which are to be taken for such
improvement, and showing the name of
the person to whom the said lots were
assessed upon the last Assessment Book
of the City and County, together with
the amounts of such assessments.
Sec. 3. The Secretary of the Board
shall thereupon cause said resolution
of intention to be published for a pe
riod of thirty days, non-judicial days
excepted, and shall also cause a copy
of said resolution to be deposited, post
age prepaid, in the Post Office at the
City and County, addressed to each
person whose name is delineated upon

Secretary of the Board his objections
thereto, briefly stating the grounds
thereof and the nature of his interest;
and upon the day fixed for hearing the
same, or some day to which the hear
ing thereof shall then be ppstponed.
the Board shall proceed to hear and
determine the sufficiency of any objec
tions which may have been filed.
Sec. 5. If the Board shall determine
that Â«uch objections are sufficient to
prevent a recommendation of the im
provement, it shall pass a resolution to
that effect, and no further proceedings
shall be had under said petition. If
no objections have been filed, or if the
Board shall determine that the objec
tions filed are insufficient, it may pass
a resolution recommending to the Su
pervisors said improvement, and in its
recommendation shall specially report
to the Supervisors whether in its opin
ion the land within the district speci
fied as affected by said improvement
will be benefited to the extent of the
expense of said improvement.
Sec. 6. If the Board shall pass a
resolution recommending said improve
ment, the Secretary shall forthwith,
transmit to the Clerk of the Supervis

essary to be taken for the purpose of
the intended improvement. Such value
shall be ascertained as of the time of
said inquiry, independently of any ap
preciation or depreciation that may be
caus'td to the same by reason of such
intended improvement, and the Board
thall fix such valuation as the amount
to be given to the owners therefor.

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OP PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
â water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal Indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit: to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. Whon a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, aa
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
tho signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors- and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast in favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions 9hall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring ita
determination 10 acquire the same as
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided. i
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
Utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter- !

WAR AND THE MARKETS.
The Toledo Market Report says: '.
I '"The first effects of the war of lE6I-65 were
I apparent in a great Inflation of prices' and an
I abnormal activity of trade; the reactionary
derangements were delayed until the panic of
1873. At the beginning of that struggle we
hail only $150,000,000 of gold in the country;
to-day we have STSO.OOO.OOO. War always be
comes a serious question of gold resource;
and this difference between now and then is
I an advantage of the Utmost value; the more
the threatened war would be of far ln
! ferior magnitude to that of thirty-five years
uko. Still although we mlpht safely count
those ameliorations of war when it had
fairly pot under way, its Immediate effect
would be a sharp shock to all the markets,
but as the rt^ult has already been anticipated.
Its severer features would soon disappear, and
speculation would become a conspicuous fea
ture of business at large, but especially In
j stocks."
OUR SUPPLY OF MONET.
On the' first day of April, 1898, there was
more money In the country than there has ever
been before, says the Wall Street Journal, and
there was more money In circulation. The
circulation was $1,756,058,645, and the amount
coined or issued was $2,413,736,148. Compared
with April 1, â¢â ISS9, , the money- In the country
has Increased from $1,990,046,487, or â¢: nearly
1500,000,000, and ' the money In circulation has
increased from $1,406.451,595. or about $350.
000.000. The. Treasury has a gold reserve larger
than for several years, and the amount of
gold coined Is a trifle more than 30 per cent of
the total stock in the country. This gold will
be swelled by further arrivals from Europe
and Australia; so far as the amount of money
Is concerned, there Is no danger .of stringency.
The danger is of a sufficiently larÃe war scare
to induce general hoarding, and this, the best
judges do .not believe can be brought about
by a war with Spain. For that reason they
are confident that there can be no real strin
gency in money; although they look for higher
rates than have been prevailing.
TREASURE SHIPMENT.
The Peru took out a treasure list of SS3,r>2ft.
consisting of $10,113 In Mexican dollars. $1705
in gold coin, $66,000 in silver bullion and $5700
in Chilean pesos.

The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate minimum temperature

amount of rainfall or of melted snow In inches

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, 'equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear cm thp Washington -?oast. When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is* probable;
but â when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
markf-ci curvature, rain south of Oregon Is lm
probabt*. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS. '
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 12.â T0-day's stock mar- j
ket was listless and the movement of prices
exceedingly sluggish. Heaviness was th 2 pre
vailing tone, however, and the net results are :
In nearly all capes 'losses. It la evident that
the prevailing sentiment in Wall street is not ,
hopeful. Doubt and uncertainty -prevailed in
all quarters and reports ." from ,-, European
bourses indicated the same .uncertain feeling
In every market in the world as to the out
come of the controversy between ( the United
States and Spain. If transactions in a few
speculative leaders were taken out of to-day's
market the dimensions of trading would appear
almost ludicrously small. Even such specu
lative favorites as the Grangers showed com
parative apathy.. There was a -movement in
tobacco which carried the price up nearly 7
points, the motive being the rationed settle
ment of the controversy in the. trade of the
plug tobacco. The advance in price was also |
said to be directed against, an outstanding
short Interest. There was large buying of the
company's scrip also and a resulting rise of
4 per cent in Its price. I Rubber preferred was
lifted 3 points on very limited transactions. In
the railroad list Northwest was the only i
prominent stock which showed a gain, though \
Rock ' Island was at one time a shade above j
yesterday's closing. Opening prices here were
not as low as the London parity and there was !
dealing In consequence for arbitrage account.
The market showed a slight degree of anima
tion in the first hour on buying, attributed to
Washington. The bull theory was that differ
ences In Congress would beget delay and that j
delay added to the chances of peaceful ! set- j
tlement. The volume of the buying was not
Impressive and it had almost, ceased . before I
noon. For the,, rest of the day the market
was to all Intents and purposes lifeless and
the closing sales were the lowest of the day.
The bond market was "intensely dull and
showed slight recoveries -In some cases from ,
early weakness. Total sales, $SOO,OOO.
United States 4s advanced Vi In the bid
price. Government bonds otherwise were un
changed. . * - Â - â â¢â â

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 12.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram: The stock mar
kets here were stagnant to-day, business being
scarcely resumed after the holidays. Such
speculative position as existed had been ad
justed previous to the Easter holidays, and
there was no inclination to reopen commit
ments pending developments. The apparent
reason why prices here were slightly under
those at New York. Is that there is no bear
account hero, whereas it Is believed one ex
ists in New York. Americans were sold a little
from the Continent. Brazils were flat on a
further fall in exchange.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 12.â The Government crop
report, showing a condition of 86, compared
with 81.5 last year, was responsible in the main
for the eaÃy feeling which marked the opening
in wheat. The report did not estimate the area
planted, but It Is generally believed to be larger
than last year and the comparatively high con
dition figures caused quite a little scattered
liquidation at first. Another bearish factor
was the perficl weather prevailing in the win
ter wheat country. Opening: trades In July
ranged from 83% to S3%c, compared with yes
terday's closing prices of 83T B e. For a brief
tlmt the market held around these figures.
Then the firm Northwest markets, light re
ceipts in that section and liberal commission
house buying caused a hardening of prlees and
a slow pdvanee, which was continued for
nearly two hours. Before 11:30 o'clock the
market had advanced to 84% c. This was close
to "call" prices, and selling against the privi
leges, coupled with considerable liquidation,
sent July back to 54%0. Before noon the mar
ket began to recover. The advance was slow,
however, until reports from California, even
more sensational than those received yester
day, came in. Large exporters of wheat in
San Francisco said there was to be no further
exports from there for fifteen months and a
Chicago firm had sold for It In San Fran
cisco December wheat at a price 2%c per
bushel over yesterday. The weather in Cali
fornia was still unfavorable, with no prospects
of relief. Kansas also complained of drought.
The market after the nodn hour rapidly grew
strong. Besides the support received from the
California news the market was akled by the
enormous continental demand for cargoes, Liv
erpool and Paris advices both stating that
7,200,000 bushels had been sold last week. The
last hour of trading was quite active, buying
being general and heavy and prices advanced
sharply. The strength was maintained to the
close. July finally advancing to Ss%c and clos
ing firm at Ss%iSSs*ic.
The strength <H wheat overshadowed every
thing else In corn and drove shorts to cover.
May closed a phajie higher.
Oats were steady for May, but trade was
slow and nf professional character. May
closed He higher.
Provisions were very. dull. Packers did mo?t
of the business and dealt only In small lots.
The feeling was steady, with fluctuations nar
row in all products. At the close May pork
was Be lower. May lard unchanged and May

DRIED FRUIT IN THE EAST.
NE^ YORK. April 12.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The situation in the dried fruit
market, so far at least as California goods are
concerned, seems to be very firm. The consum
ing demand has been stimulated by the pros
pect of an advance, and In spite of the unset
tled present situation some of the larger local
handlers of California products report more
movement than for weeks paKt. The demand,
It is stated, Is based on the prospect of a very
short crop this year. Recent advices from
Philadelphia state that there Is nothing left
there, Chicago having bought up all of its sur
plus. Chicago as well as Philadelphia has been
a buyer here during the past week or two as
prices quoted on the spot were as low as a
similar quality of goods could be bought at on
the coast. New York holders, however, are
looking for better prices and are not at all
anxious to sell. Good Peaches are scarce and
firm on spot, and in all positions for that mat
ter. The coming crop promisee, according to
latest advices from the coast, to be small, but
consumers seem to be Indifferent. There are
no large buyers In the market, and the current
wants of the consumption appear to be light,
but these are firm In their views. The Prune
market Is somewhat unsettled.

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Are entirely n-minal at
about 20s asked r the usual voyage, as the
dry weather and short crop prospects do not
extend much hope of a large demand for ton
nage this season. The chartered wheat fleet In
port has a registered tonnage of 11,700, against
2PUO tons on the same date last year; disengag
ed. 9500 tons, against 53, 500; on the way to this

WHEATâ The Hutton Hall takes for Cork
70,313 ctls, valued at $10."i,400.
The market continues at sea. It is so far
above the foreign â¢ â¢'* that shipping is out
of the question. The only buyers are the mil
lers and other local consumers. The crop is
suffering irom the dry weather, and the usual
exportable surplus grows smaller day by day.

Earthenware sleepers, the invention
of a Japanese, were recently experi
mented on at Shimbashi Station, Japan.
Fairly good results were obtained. It is
claimed that the increased cost of
earthenware sleepers is amply compen
sated by their freedom from decay.

Yesterday.
Late j'osterday afternoon General W.
R. Shafter. U. S. A., commanding the
Department of California, exchanged
views with Major-v-ieneral John H. Dick
inson, division commander of the Na
tional Guard of California. The place of
meeting was at army headquarters In
the Phelan building.
The strength, equipment and general
value of the National Guard as a mili
tary organization constituted the chief
topics of discussion. The possibility of
privateers and small raiding expeditions
being organized to molest commerce and
defenseless communities on tne California
coast was considered.
General Shafter and General Dickinson
understand that the cities of Santa
Cruz, Monterey and Santa Barbara are
not protected by catteries. A swift-going
GEN. JOHN H. DICKINSON.
Spanish cruiser that could manage to |
obtain a supply of coal might enter any ;
of these ports and do considerable dam- ,
age before one of our cruisers could over- '
haul the enemy's vessel. Of course, it Is I
well understood that Spain's operations
on the Pacific in *his region would be \
limited by r<- i of the difficulty that
would be encountered in obtaining fuel, i
As a result of the conference yesterday, j
it is understood that Immediate steps will !
be taken to organize several batteries in j
the National Guard. Barring four troops >
of cavalry, the Naval Reserve and the I
Signal Corps, the National Guard of j
California consists of Infantry. The occa- j
sion now arises for the uso of artillery,
and measures will be taken at once to
supply ..^e troops with guns, caisson-,
ammunition and horses. One battery may
be Stationed at Santa Cruz, another at ;
Monterey and one at Santa Barbara.
After his interview with General Dick- i
Intson yesterday General Shafter said to j
a Call reporter that the Government j
could supply the State troops with the j
necessary guns and equipment for the !
organization of batteries 01 artillery. The j
general also remarked that there would !
be no obstacles in the way of supplying j
the infantry regiments of the National |
Guard with new guns of the Springfield i
type.
After the Interview General Dickinson
said that several batteries of artillery
would probably be organized In the Na
tional Guard. He remarked that Gen- j
eral Shaf ter had asked a good many ques- '
tioCs about the guard and the equipment |
of the troops.
No doubt the wires will be used imme
diately to get authority from Washing
ton to issue from the Benieia Arsenal to
the State troops such small arms and
field guns as may be required to effective
ly arm th<- organization. To hasten action
in the premises the assistance of Sen
ators "White and Perkins may be re- I
quested.
Before final action is taken. General
Dickinson, the division commander, will i
probably confer with Governor Budd and j
Adjutant-General Barrett. Should three i
batteries of artillery be required, it is
probable that one will be assigned to each
of the three existing brigades of the Na- I
tional Guard. The old Second Brigade of i
the guard, located in this city, had an
excellent light battery, but the expense j
of maintaining an armory and hiring
horses was more than the company could I
stand. The Sacramento brigade also had
a good light battery, but it was mustered
out when the National Guard was re-or
ganized, it now becomes necessary. In view
<>f the approaching conflict, to reafor*
that arm of the service. There wii.fbe
no difficulty in finding men fairly capable
who are willing to man the guns.
Doubtless the infantry regiments will
now be immediately supplied with ap
proved guns and a full line of ammuni
tion. The supply of tents is limited, but
the deficiency can bo made good by pur- i
chase In the open market. Blankets can '
also be purchased without delay. The i
troops are just receiving new uniforms |
from the appropriation made at the last
session of th<> Legislature. Should more j
overcoats be demanded they can be lead- j
lly purchased.
Governor Budd, the Attorney General
and the Secretary of Â§tate, or a majority i
of the three, may as a State Board of i-x- J
aminers, at any time authorize a deficien
cy to be created for the maintenance of
the guard, and thereupon money may be
drawn from the State treasury to supply
the troops Ith everything needed for an
active campaign in the Held.
In view of recent conferences and in the
light of impending operations it is rea
sonable to reckon that tne State troops
will be called into active service within
a short time. The Governor is in position
to supply the sinews of war and stands
ready to respond at once to a call from
the President to put the State troops in
the field.
The following special order was issued
yesterday :
Headquarters Department of
California.
San Francisco, Cal., )

Under the provision* of A. R.
193 the Department Command
er, accompanied toy First L.ieu

By command of Brigadier-
General Shafter.
J. B. BABCOCH,
Assistant Adjutant General.
The inspection at Benlcln
Barracks will take place next
Thursday.
Yesterday afternoon General "William
R. Shafter and First lieutenant John D.
ltlley, Fifth Artillery, aid and engineer
officer, inspected the transportation at the
Presidio. On their tour of inspection
they were accompanied by Colonel Evan
Miles, commanding the Presidio, and Cap
tain Charles B. Thompson, assistant
quartermaster at the post. They found
the 125 draft and pack mules in apparent
ly excellent condition, and the harness
and appurtenances all in good order. The
1 army conveyances, such as Dougherty
| wagons, ambulances, escort wagons and
carts, were all thoroughly inspected and
found to be in good repair, ready for field
service if necessary. The wagons were
parked on the parade plain.
After the inspection General Shatter re
marked that he had found everything in
good order. In fact, he expressed surprise
at the excellence and readiness of the
facilities for field service in the line of
transportation. As to the probable move
ment of troops he would not venture a
prediction. He simply said that tall the
troops at the Presidio were ready to take
the field.
Officers and enlisted men of the First
United States Infantry expect to be
orde|ed to the front at any hour. The
regiment is prepared to get aboard the
train at a.n hour's notice. Every item of
news from "Washington is eagerly
scanned. The battalion of the First In
fantry stationed at Benicia Barracks is
also ready to march.
THOMPSON SUCCEEDS GATES.
Central Pacific Stockholders Meet
but Make Only One Change
in Their Board.
The stockholders of the Central Pacific
held their regular yearly meeting yester
day for the purpose of electing a board
of directors to -serve for the ensuing
twelve months. Out of a total of 672,755
shares, 490.757 were voted, and the result
was that the entire old board, with the
exception of 1. EL Gates of New York,
was re-elected. The reason of Mr. Gates'
defeat was that the stockholders con
cludt*! that the representation from San
Francisco should be increased, and they
consequently elected AY. M. Thompson in
the place of the gentleman from New
York. The board as it now stands is com
posed of Isaac L. Requa, William H.
Mills, W. M. Thompson, C. E. Bretherton
of London, F. E. Spencer of San Jose,
Charles P. Eells and J. C. Kirkpatrick.
To-morrow afternoon the directors will
meet and elect officers.
Fenders on Cars.
The case of H. E. Huntington of the
Market-strert Railway Company, charged
with not having fenders on the electric
cars, was again called in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday morning and by consent
continued until Monday afternoon. It is
expected that by that time" both sides
will be ready to go on.

THE POSTER OUT
Public Announcements of the Coming Masonic
Festivalâ A Generous Donation.
The Poster Which Will Announce the Coming
Masonic Festival.
HE Masonic festival poster is out, heralding to the general public with no
Tless than four colors of ink, the great event that is to take place in early
May. It will be posted up on the blank walls all over town; it will be put in
all public buildings, and it will tell its message from store windows all
along the streets. There will be a big issue printed, and they will be dis
tributed in such a manner that a good citizen need never be out of sight of at
least one of them.
Plans for the American booth of Excelsior Lodge are developing rapidly,
and when the festival opens they promise to provide something sensational.
Arrangements for the safety of anything donated have been made, and particular
care has been devoted to these arrangements, for there will be on exhibition
Jewels and regalia and historical emblems of priceless value. Safes will be pro
vided, but safes will not be the only precaution. Watchmen will be on hand day
and night, and it is probable that those assigned to this duty will be chosen
from the order.
The executive committee met yesterday and considered where the line should
bÂ» drawn in accepting or admitting features for the booths or for the festival.
It was finally decided that any scheme not chimerical or for the purpose of ad
vertising should be allowed.
The following letter was received by the master of California Lodge yester
day. It is but one of many which, while not so large, are equally willing and
prompted by the same spirit of generosity:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., April 11, 1898.
E. H. Hills, Master California Lodge No. 1, F. and A. M. : Please present In my be
half to the "Masonic Widows' and Orphans' Home" as a donation the encloned certified
check on "First National Bank of San Francisco, C 01.," for one thousand doll; rs. and
oblige. Youre truly. J- M. McDONALD.
Ladies of California Lodge No. 1 met in the Masonic Temple and concluded
positively to get up an art booth consisting of art goods manufactured in Cali
fornia. A feature of this booth wili be a bag of flour, decorated, and to be sold
at auction every night during the festival. It is expected that a great deal of
money will be secured in this way.
The ladies of Ivy Chapter met at Golden Gate Hall. It was decided to dress
fhe ladies for the cigar booth in orange and lemon, and to use cigar ribbons for
headdress and decorative purposes. It was also concluded to have Uncle Sam
and a revenue cutter in the cigar booth. About 7000 cigars have already been
donated. Mrs. Dr. Edna R. Field spoke to the ladies yesterday, encouraging
them in the work, and told them how successful the festival would be, for, she
said, ladles are inquiring from all parts of the State for space for various kinds of
booths, and many of these ladies are from chapters of Eastern Stars who are
willing' to pay all expenses in fitting up booths, etc. Mrs. \V. Frank Pierce, chair
man of the committee on booths, asked the ladles if they would look over the
flowers, ferns, etc., that were sent to the executive committee by Clear Lake
Chapter, Eastern Star. These flowers are now at the Baldwin Pharmacy, to be
sold for the benefit of the festival.
The ladies of the Grand Chapter, under the leadership of Mrs. Flint, have
decided to sell souvenir spoons and gold-plated spoons as souvenirs. These
Bouvenir spoons will be official and no one else will be permitted to sell spoons at
the festival.
