Victory That Has Been Gained by

Copyrirhted, 1Â£93, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, April 11.â Doubtless
exaggerated accounts of the disturb
ances last night will be sent out. The
whole affair was a most harmless
thing. There was no rising of popu
lar sentiment as is sought to be rep
resented by the yellow press. About
one hundred hungry vagabonds, hired
at a cheap price, at from one and a
half to two pesetas each, by Robiedo,
Weyler & Company, were told where
to go and what to do.
It was a holiday, and as usual on
Buch days there were thousands of
idle people, glad of the opportunity of
creating public sentiment against
the Government of the United States.
When the hoodlums were begin
ning their movement, General Wood
ford was quietly strolling with his
daughter and another young lady,
wearing the happy countenance of a
man who considered peace in sight.
The Governor of Madrid, grasping
the nature of the demonstration, de
cided up to a late hour to let the
people shout to their hearts' content.
Then when their noise began to dis
turb those desiring to sleep the police
arrived and the disturbers, like a
pack of sheep, dispersed.
To-day, by a printed proclamation,
notice is given that the nonsense
must not begin again, otherwise
the disturbers will be summarily
punished.
Numerous groups In the Puerta
del Sol and in front of the offices of
the Minister of the Interior this even
ing raised the cry "Viva Espana."
The gendarmes and the police scat
tered them and occupied the square,
but the groups quickly reformed sev
eral times, until finally the gen
darmes charged the crowd. Many
were injured or arrested.
Throughout the evening demon
strations continued in various quar
ters. The police and gendarmes re
peatedly dispersed large crowds and
there have been several arrests in the
lower quarters.
Calm has finally been restored, but
the gendarmes are patrolling the
streets and other precautions are
maintained.

worthy source report that the
insurgents in the Philippines are
gaining on the Spaniards.
new stage of the relations between
Spain and the United States is the
fact that Spain, having granted at
the request of the Pope and the
powers a suspension of hostilities,
which she had persistently refused to
grant when President McKinley sug
gested it, the American Government
and diplomacy now consider their
hands free, as they were no party to
, the arrangement thus made by the
; Pope and the powers with Spain.
"Their contention is that Spain,
i having taken upon herself to grant
; unconditionally the suspension of
hostilities, % without any mutual
agreement or conditions between the
American and Spanish Governments,
nothing can be asked or expected
from America, who will merely look
: on to see what comes out of this sort
of armistice and of any negotiations
between the Cuban autonomist Gov
ernment and the insurgents.
''When in time events allow the
; United States to judgeof theresultsof
! a suspension of hostilities and of the
negotiations as to home rule, Ameri
ca will consider herself free to act in
1 accordance with American interests
i and to insist upon a permanent set
tlement of the Cuban question to se
cure peace in Cuba; and all simply
because McKinley made no engage
ment for the present or future with
the Pope and the European powers,
who are alleged to have conjointly
induced Spain to grant the suspen
sion of hostilities.
"Tliis must be borne in mind in
order to understand why most of the

countries stand just as they were a

Typical Demonstration of Spanish Malice Mani
fested in a Theater at Santiago
de Cuba.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, April ll.â ln an interview to-day Dr. Caminero oF the
United States Marine Hospital at Santiago de Cuba, who arrived here a few days ago
with the United States Consul thereâ Mr. Hyattâ told me oF an incident illustrating
the intense feeling against Americans among the Spaniards in Cuba.
"Four or five days before the Brooklyn left Santiago," Dr. Caminero said to
me, "there was a performance in one of the theaters for the pdrpose of raising a
patriotic fund for the Government of Spain. During the evening there were cries
from the audience of 'Death to Americans!' and 'Long live Spain!' At the per
formance a United States flag was shown, and with shouts of 'Death to Americans!'
the Spaniards pelted the flag with stale eggs and rotten fruit. Before this perform
ance the Spanish local committee came to me and asked me to buy a ticket to aid
the fund. I told the committee to 'Go to 1'
"We could see torpedoes in the harbor oF Santiago as we leFt. They had been
placed there two or three days beFore. We left the United States Consulate in
Santiago and relief supplies intended for the reconcentrados in charge of the
British Consul there. Spanish troops in Santiago are dying rapidly of malaria, yel
low fever and kindred diseases. The death rate of the population of the town is as
high sometimes as 105 a day. On the contrary, the insurgents are vigorous and
there is little disease among them. They are positively getting fat on the war.
"Almost the entire white population oF the island Favors annexation to the
United States, and the Feeling is growing. I think annexation is destined. While in
Cuba I refused to pay taxes, and must now owe the Spanish Government several
thousand dollars. I know of at least ten or fifteen Americans who were left behind.
If not taken off they will probably go into the interior. Exit from Santiago is easy."
According to Dr. Caminero, the instructions to Consul Hyatt to leave Cuba
came first to United States Consul Dent here from Washington and were here trans
lated into the British cipher code by the British Consul and then sent to the British
Consulâ Mr. Ramsonâ in Santiago. Mr. Ramson communicated the orders to Mr.
Hyatt, but Mr. Hyatt refused to leave the island without direct instructions from
Washington. The steamship which was to take the American officials away was
compelled to wait twenty-four hours until Mr. Hyatt heard From Washington.

Lee Has Documents Con
victing Spain of De
stroying the Maine.
Congress Will Act on Wednes
day, and Probably in the
Form of a Declara
tion of War.
NEW YORK, April v.â The Herald's Key West
correspondent sends the following: There now seems no
doubt that Lee will present documents to President
McKinley proving absolutely that Weyler placed mines
in Havana harbor and planned destruction for any Amer
ican warship that might visit Havana, on a friendly
mission or otherwise. Lee's assumption is that a Weyler
sympathizer in the navy yard was the actual agent who
accomplished the purpose, planned by Weyler, of destroy
ing the Maine.
Upon this Lee's mind dwelt when, just before the
Fern raised anchor on Saturday evening, he proposed a
sentiment which concluded with the open charge that a
Spanish mine caused the death of the officers and men of
the Maine.
One of the attaches of the Consulate in Havana,
who is here yet, awaiting orders which will probably come
from Washington to-morrow afternoon, assured me that
Lee carries indisputable proof of Weyler's perfidy. My
informant has for months been very close to Lee aud cer
tainly knows whereof he speaks. He said that if the
papers the American Consul carried are made public they
will cause an international sensation.
These papers are in most cases original documents
and are fully attested. One places Weyler in the posi
tion of a self-confessed butcher who would willingly
sacrifice the lives of hundreds of human beings for the
simple reason that they happened to be connected with an
American warship.
In other words he openly boasted his ability to blow
out of water any Yankee ship that entered Havana har
bor, no matter what position might be taken. The mines
were so carefully arranged that they commanded every
anchorage in the harbor.
My informant also intimated that Lee carried to
Washington a plan of the harbor, showing the location
of the mines and the methods and means of operating
them from the arsenal.

General Miles Endeavors to Ob
taiQ Niger's Approval of
Y\\s Plans.
NEW YORK, ".pril 11.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
S'-iould the recommendations of Major General Miles, commanding: the
army, be approved by Secretary Alger, all the Unite 1 States infantry
east of the :i<x*ky Mountains will be massed at Chiekamauga National
Fark before the end of this week. Secretary Alger, however, up to this
time has withheld his approval of the concentration ordered, having
permitted the movement of only the Twenty-fifth Infantry, which
Btarted yesterday from Fort Missoula, Mont., after many delays. Six
companies of this regiment are under orders to proceed to Chicka
mauga and two go directly to Dry Tortugas.
(it-neral Miles had a long conference with Secretary Alger to-day
in which the commanding general strongly urged upon the Secretary
the necessity of prompt action with regard to the concentration of the
available military forces of the nation. Secretary Alger will have an
other conference with General Miles to-morrow, when the general sit
uation with special reference to the attitude and probable action of
Congress will be again discussed.
General Miles and all army officers at the department consider that
the Spanish overtures of the last few days have not in any way
changed the situation. They regard the outlook as serious in the ex
treme, and believe that war is imminent. For these reasons they
strenuously advocate concentration and organization of troops on a
â war bisis at the earliest posrible moment.
General Miles does not advocate the calling out of the National
Guards in adva. re of actual hostilities. Their services will not be
asked for until war has been declared or intervention in Cuba agreed
upon.
may be enacted as a result of his mes
lage. no matter how serious the conse
quences may ho. Now Congress has the
responsibility upon it. It is the Presi
dent's sincere hope that it will weigh
every phase of the question as carefully
as he hns done and that when it does
act, it will declare for forcible interven
tion, and not in the form of a direct de
claration of war.
"Rather that the Administration
should be an ignominious failure
than that it should be responsible for
an unholy war/ is a favorite expres
sion of the President.
Should he be clothed with authority
to use the military and naval forces to
intervene solely for the purpose of es
tablishing peace and order in Cuba, the
President proposes to exercise it first
by transmitting to Spain a copy of the
resolution, with a statement that his
obligations require him to carry out the
will of Congress, and a notification that
he will do so at once, unles^ Spain with
draws from the island.
In other words, the President will
deliver an ultimatum to Spain before
making a naval demonstration, in
the hope that Spain may at the last
moment consent to the concession of
the independence of the people of
that island upon an indemnity, or
upon some other basis which may be
satisfactory to all parties involved.
If war should then come, whether
"holy" or "unholy," he will feel that
the responsibility is on Spain.
One significant sign of peace is that
diplomatic relations between the United
States and Spain have not been severed
as a result of the message sent to Con
gress to-day. It is true that all our
Consuls have been called out of Cuba
and that would indicate a preliminary
sign of war, but our Minister is still at
Madrid and Spain's representative is
still here. It was supposed that when
ihe President's message went to Con
gress .Spain would at once take um
brage and recall Minister Polo de Ber
nabe. She has not done so, nor has the
President recalled Minister YVoodford.
The two Ministers are thus at their posts
of duty and in position to resume nego
tiations for a definite settlement of the
Cuban question pending the differences
between the two countries involving the
Maine disaster in the event that Spain
should succeed in getting the Cubans to
consent to the armistice which the
Queen has proclaimed.
The whole matter is left in the hands
of Congress, so far as the President is
concerned, but if anyti n^ should come
of the negotiations which are known to
be secretly under way to secure the in
dependence of Cuba on an indemnity
basis, there is no doubt that the Presi
dent would quickly open negotiations
with Spain while Congress is deliber
ating over the form of action it will
take.
This is the only ray of hope shin
ing forth from the war-clouds which
are still hovering over us, and while
too much importance should not be
attached to it, it should not be lost
sight of as one of the remote possi
bilities.
The text of the armistice which is now
in the possession of the President, I was
told to-night, was rather disappointing
to the authorities here, and if the full
terms had been known this morning, the
addition to the President's message inti
mating a desire for delay might not have
been inserted.
As to the Congressional situation, all
indications to-night point to some days'
delay. Both houses are in an ugly
frame of mind. The President's mes
sage, while satisfactory to the conserva
tive classes, is disappointing to the ma
jority. One of the chief points of dis
satisfaction is the omission of any ref
erence to the question ot the independ
ence in the demands wnich the messaee
shows the President has made upon
Spain. His reference to a "stable form
of government means, in the opinion of
most of those who takft exception to the
message, that the President still favors
an autonomist form of government for
Cuba, and his line of argument against
recognition of independence at this time
is interpreted to mean that he never
contemplated anything further in his de
mands upon the Madrid authorities.
It is this question of recognition
of independence that is the main
bone of contention in Congress and
one which -will provoke the delay
which Spain is praying for.
The Foreign Affairs committees are
divided on the question in their efforts
to formulate a resolution for final adop
tion. Strong efforts have been made to
get both committees into line upon the
same resolution, so as to expedite action
when the matter comes before the two
Houses. There is little doubt that the
recommendations of the two commit
tees, whatever they may be, will finally
prevail, but with certain factions favor
ing the recognition of independence as a
prelude to forcible intervention, another
in favor of an out and out declaration
of war, another standing with the Pres
ident in favor of forcible intervention as
one step to be taken at this time, some
â¢lays' debate will undoubtedly ensue
after the committees have reported.
The peace men. who do not want any
action at all, must also be taken into
consideration. With the elastic rules of
the Senate these men would be able to
prolong the debate indefinitely.
Naturally great interest is manifested
in administration and Congressional cir
cles as to the attitude which will be as
sumed by the great powers in the event
that Congress should direct the Presi
dent to forcibly intervene to end the
war in Cuba. None of the powers has
gone so far as to officially state the po
sition it will adopt, and for the present
their interest in the matter is confined to
the efforts they are making to urge
Spain to make all possible haste in ar
ranging terms of peace with the insur
gents.
It is admitted by representatives of the
powers with whom I talked that they
believe the joint representation they
made at the White House last week had
the effect, in the first place, of causing
the President to postpone the transmis
sion of his message to Congress until
to-day, and, second, of indirectly result
ing in its being couched in milder terms
than before they saw Mr. McKinley.
If the insurgents should refuse to ac
cept the liberal propositions offered by
Spain, they believe this Government
should withdraw its moral support and
prospective armed intervention, and
this, it is believed, would have the ef
fect of causing the Cubans to come to
terms.
The expulsion of Spain from the
island of Cuba and the declaration of the
independence of the island from the
sovereignty of Spain will probably be
the vital points in the resolution which
will finally be adopted by Congress.
Strenuous efforts are now being made to
get the Foreign Relations Committee of
the Senate and the Foreign Affairs
Committee of the House into line upon
the s?me resolution, and to have the re
port of the two as nearly unanimous as
possible. Up to the present time these
efforts have not succeeded. It has not
even been possible to harmonize the dif
ferences of the Republican members of
either committee. The question of rec
ognizing of in any way referring to in
dependence in the resolution is a stumb
ling block. Practically every member of
each committee has in his pocket the
text of a resolution which he believes
ought to be adopted. These all differ,
but they range themselves under three
heads â intervention without reference to
independence, to establish peace and
stable government; intervention by de
claration of independence of the people
of Cuba without recognizing the present
so-called Government, and intervention
accepted by direct recognition of the
present so-called Government. The sec
ond of these, which is in the nature of
a compromise, seems to-night to be the
one on which agreement is most proba
ble. Much may depend upon the state
ment made to Congress by Consul Gen
eral Lee when he appears before them.
The majority of the Senate Com
mittee on Foreign Relations is to
night in favor of a mandatory reso
lution in reply to the President's
message.
The committee went into secret ses
sion as soon as the Senate adjourned
and remained in session four hours. The
debate was exceedingly spirited, but
there was a wide diversity of opinion
over the question of immediate interven
tion or leaving it to the discretion of the
President, as suggested in the message.
There was also a diversity of opinion on
the subject of recognizing the independ
ence of the Cuban republic. When the
meeting adjourned no definite action
had been reached, and the committee
adjourned to meet again to-morrow,
when it is expected that Consul General
Lee will appear, and make a statement
as to the situation in Cuba and will
clear up the question as to whether he
can shed any additional light on the
Maine disaster. All the members of the
committee are pledged to secrecy, but
it is known that if a vote had been taken
on the proposition favored by the ma
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 1898.
SAGASTA'S PAPER
SHOWS HOSTILITY.
MADRID, April 11.â The Lib
eral, in a spirited article this
morning on the political situa
tion, says: "President McKin
ley's message will decide Spain's
course. If the Washington Gov
ernment changes its conduct,
withdraws its threats and fol
lows the dictates of justice,
peace-loving Spain will forgive
the injuries done her and will
turn from war. But if the re
public continues its course in in
sisting on armed intervention
Spain without arrogance or fear
will accept the challenge, allow-
ing no one to restrain her, seek
ing counsel or help from no one
to maintain her flag unstained
and her sovereignty untouched.
The nation is strong enough, be
ing closely united with the army
which is really the nation
armed."
jority, to report a mandatory resolution,
there would not have been a dissenting
voice sufficient to warrant a minority
report. As it was, the committee ad
journed without committing itself to any
definite resolution.
In view of the expected arrival of
Consul General Lee to-morrow the com
mittee will not be ready to submit its
report to the Senate before Wednesday.
In the meantime a mighty effort will be
made to swing the entire committee into
line in support of the President's re
commendations. The friends of imme
diate intervention are positive to-night
that there is but slight probability of the
majority of the committee reversing:
their present judgment. In any event
there is apt to be protracted debate on
any resolution reported back from the
committee. The elastic rules of the Sen
ate admit of the greatest freedom of dis
cussion, and some Senators will insist
upon getting their views Into the Record
before they cast their votes. It is prob
able that in the end the House commit
tee will fall in line and accept such res
olution as may be agreed to by the Sen
ate committee.
The Republican members of the
House committee held a prolonged con
ference this afternoon without coming
to any agreement. The advocates of rec
ognizing the independence of the so
called republic of Cuba held out stren
uously for their end and refused to ac
cept any compromise. The conference
broke up with the differences between
the participants as wide as before. An
other conference was held to-day, last
ing until a late hour, but the advocates
jf the different forms of resolutions
proposed found it still impossible to
reconcile their differences.
There will be a meeting of the full
committee to-morrow morning, but in
view of the failure of the Republican
members to reach a conclusion to-night
no resolution will be reported to the
House to-morrow. It is possible that
the committee may delay action long
enough to hear Consul General Lee
after the Senate committee is through
with him.

FLEEING FROM
THE CAPITAL
OF PORTO RICO
Coqsul HH Q o na an d a Party of
Americans Tal^e Refuge on
St. Thon)as Island.
Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
ST. THOMAS, West Indies, April 11.â In accordance with orders
from "Washington to proceed immediately to this island, Mr. P. C.
Hanna, United States Consul in San Juan de Porto Rico, arrived here
to-day on a Spanish schooner. He was accompanied by his wife and
party of fifteen Americans, including Mr. Delvalle, the vice-consul,
and family; Mr. and Mrs. Wyman and Mrs. Van Syckle. Before leav
ing San Juan Mr. Hanna turned over the affairs of the United States
consulate to the British Consul. All Americans remaining on the is
land will he under the protection of the British flag.
Mr. Hanna says that the officials of Porto Rico extended every
courtesy as he was leaving. At the time of his departure the authori
ties of Porto Rico were in entire ignorance as to the situation. Troops
were under orders to be ready for service at any time, and plans
were afoot to put 30,000 rifles into the hands of civilians. Cannon are
being placed at different strategic points, coal and water supplies are
being increased and the impression is general that war has broken
out between the United States and Spain. This has caused scores of
citizens to move into the interior, so aa to be out of range of naval
guns.
There are grave fears of a serious revolution should the United
States blockade San Juan. Consul Hanna is anxious to return to
Porto Rico as soon as possible, as the British Consul is soon to
leave San Juan on leave of absence.
The Spanish cruisers Vizcaya and Almirante Oquendo were at San
Juan when Mr. Hanna left that port.
DE CASTRO IN
WASHINGTON
The Spanish Consul Was
Summoned There on
Last Sunday.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â De
Castro, the Spanish consul at
San Francisco, is here, and it is
understood that he will soon be
transferred to another post.
This information comes from an
attache of the Spanish legation
in Washington. An attache of
the legation said to-night that
although Mr. De Castro was
here on official business and
would soon te transferred to
another post of duty, the senor's
conscience was clear and he was
not afraid.
Felipe de Castro, the Spanish Consul,
has left San Francisco, and from the
present strained relations existing be
tween the United States and the coun
try which he represents it is not at all
probable that he will return. This much
information was given out at the office
of the Spanish Consulate yesterday by
Acting Vice-Consul Camilo Martin.
The account of De Castro's sudden and
almost mysterious departure was pub
lished exclusively in yesterday's Call.
When a representative of The Call
called upon the vice-Consul yesterday
he found that gentleman in his office
in the Spring Valley building intensely
absorbed in the perusal of a magazine.
From the evident interest manifested
upon his countenance in the article
that he was reading it was apparent
that he had nut read the President's
message, or, if he had, that he attached
very little importance to it.
He received the reporter with all the
customary courtesy and dignity that
characterizes the Dons of Castile. The
inquiry us to the whereabouts of Con
sul de' Castro brought forth the answer
from his deputy that he was in Wash
ington, D. C, Avhere he had gone last
Sunday, having been summoned there
by an order from the Spanish Minister,
Senor Bernabe.
"When will he return?"
"I do not know," answered the vice-
Consul. . "
"Why did the Consul send out the
P. P. C. cards?"
"He presumed that he was sum
moned to Washington with the view of
being exchanged to some other post,
and, as is the custom in such cases, he
thought it best to comply with the
ethics of the Consular system."
"If there is a change made in tne
Consulship who will succeed Pelipe de
'â That I cannot say at present," re
plied Camilo Martin, "bu until an
oher person is appointed by the bpan
ish Government, if there is to be a
change. I myself will be in charge of
the office." ; ..
No word has been received from the
Consul since his arrival in Washing
ton was reported. If he does not re
turn his family, who are at present
here, will follow him East and join
him there Mr. Martin did not know
why De Castro had been summoned to
Washington, nor could he throw any
light upon the nature of the business
that had been the cause of his depart
ure From the tenor of his remarks
it is presumable that he does not ex
pect his chief to return here. So far no
word has been received at the Consul
ate from the absent Consul as to when
he will return, or if he expects to re
turn at all. ,
There is one Hgniflcant point In con
nection with the summoning of De
Castro to Washington that has much
weight. He has kept himself thorough
ly posted as t, the naval and military
defenses of the PaciH Coast, and it is
believed that it was for the purpose of
giving information upon this point to
the Spanish Minister that he was sum
moned to Washington.
MINER BURIED UNDER
A SLICE OF ROCK.
REDDING, April 11.â An unknown
miner, working alonfe. in a drift in the
Hoffschneider mine near Iron Mountain,
was caved upon on Saturday and buried
under 200 cubic feet of rock. The man's
failure to put in an appearance at dinner
time resulted in the discovery of the dis
aster. By hard and incessant work Hoff
schnelder and the mine cook reached the
body before It had become cold. The Cor
oner was summoned and the corpse
brought to this city for interment, arriv
ing at a late hour Sunday evening.
Among the few nersonal eftects of the
deceased was found a tintype, which is
supposed to be a hKeness of the victim,
token at an early age. A letter from a
patent medicine manufacturer in the
Eastern States offering an agency to Joe
Thomas, and addressed to Brooks, Or., is
the only clew to the name of the unfortu
nate man. There were several other pat
ent medicine circulars, but none of these
were addressed.
The deceased is described as a man of
about five feet six Inches in height and
weighing about 150 pounds. He was of a
sandy complexion, with dark hair and a
mustache of a reddish tinge. He was
about 36 years of age.
NEVADA BARS
STARVING KINE
Its Cattlemen Dictate the
Course of Governor
Sadler.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, April 11.â Nevada will bar
her. gates against California cattle that
seek admission to her ranges. This was
emphatically decided upon at a meet
ing of cattle-owners and cattle-dealers
in this city to-day. The Sagebrush
State cannot afford to endanger its
paramount interest by permitting
germs of disease to be distributed
among livestock, was the sentiment of
the meeting.
The question as to whether Nevada
allow cattle to pass through the State
was discussed, and at length the fol
lowing resolution was presented and
unanimously accepted:
Resolved, That it be the sense of this
meeting that the quarantine between this
State and California be maintained, and
no cattle from infected districts allowed
to enter the State, except in transit under
quarantine restrictions by the railroads,
if it be in the power of the authorities to
prevent it.
Resolved, That the Governor be re
quested to telegraph a copy of this reso
lution to the Secretary of Agriculture at
Washington.
The meeting adjourned with three
rousing cheers for Governor Sadler,
who said that he would unflinchingly
abide by the resolution.
The Goven ir decided to-day to urge
the County Commissioners of Washoe
County to appoint inspectors for sheep
passing throusrh the State, and, should
any prove to be diseased, to stop ship
ments.
Cattlemen from Eastern Nevada who
attended the meeting to-day assert
that the same drought prevailing in
California will strike Nev- ' â¢ on ac
count of the little snow on the moun
tains. Yesterday the Humboldt River
was measured and contained only ten
thousand inches of water, which will
diminish, durir>~ the warm season, far
below the water line of past years.
MINISTER AND
LAYMAN FIGHT
Exciting Combat Takes
Place on a Fresno
Street.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. April 11.â The trouble over
water which irrigationists are having
with the canal company is resulting in
much ill feeling, in which even the
ministry is involved. This was shown
this afternoon, when W. H. Ingels and
Rev. Carroll Ghent, a Baptist minister,
who lives at the Scandinavian colony,
engaged in a street fight over the wa
ter question. Ghent was in a carriage
and Ingels, who is secretary of the i
Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company, i
rode up to the vehicle on a bicycle and,
on alighting, accused Rev. Mr. Ghent j
of having made certain statements at \
a recent meeting held in the colony to !
consider the scarcity of water. Ghent |
denied having made the statements, but
Ingels insisted that he believed the
minister made the remarks attributed
him.
Sharp words were exchanged between
the secretary and the minister. Finally
Mr. Ghent called Mr. Ingels a liar. In
gels got into the carriage and the two
men fought desperately in the vehicle.
Ingels was bent on taking satisfaction
for having been called a liar, and Mr.
Ghent fought to protect himself and
throw his assailant out of the carriage, i
Several blows were struck. Neither
combatant is very much the worse for
the fray, although each left marks on
the other's face.
Ingels was finally forced 1.->ni the
carriage. Ker. Mr. Ghent appeared be
fore Justice Efc John and swore out a
warrant for Ingels' arrest on a charge
of assault. Ingels pleaded guilty, but
the time for passing sentence was con-
tinued. m ;

President Is Severely
Criticized.
Some Republicans, Including For

Differing From McKinley.
BpÂ»cial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â The Pres
ident's message did not, on the first
reading, receive the indorsement of
a majority of the Senators, and many
excused themselves from speaking
about it until they could have time for
careful perusal. In a general way the
objections were based on the ground
that it did not go far enough in recog
nizing the rights of the Cubans. The
Senators who have been especially
noted for their conservatism were
pleased, but they were the exception to
the rule, and many of those Senators
who had in the past few days shown a
disposition to slacken their opposition
to a conservative course appeared to
be disposed to return to their original
positions.
A large number of the Democratic
Senators refused to express them
selves at all, as did several Republi
cans, on the ground that, aa they could
not speak in complimentary terms,
they would say nothing at all. The
most significant utterance on the sub
ject of the message was that of Sena
tor Foraker (R.). from the President's
own State, and a member of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations. He said:
"I have no patience with the message,
and you can say so." He refused to go
into details.
Senator Mills (D.) of the same com
mittee said: "Without referring to the
message specifically, you can say that
I am for the idependence of Cuba and
for war on account of the Maine."
Senator Cullom (R.), also of the For
eign Relations Committee, commended
the document. He said: "It is a strong
paper, well prepared, and a careful re- :
view. The Senate may go farther than
the President recommends, but it will
j have a strong influence in shaping the
I course of events."
Senator White (D.) of California,
who opposes any interference in the
Cuban question by this country, would
only say that "the Administration ap
pears to be getting all balled up."
Senator Tillman (D.) thought it was
illogical, and that the President's rec
ommendations of means was inade
quate to accomplish what he wants to
| do.
Senator Pettigrew said: "It is the
weakest yet. It sums up the situation
by saying we must recognize neither
belligerency nor independence, but in
tervene to stop the war. Spain has al
ready accomplished this result by
granting a cessation of hostilities, thus
leaving us nothing to do but to con
tinue to make appropriations to feed
the Cuban people."
Senator Chandler said the message
was "a graphic and powerful descrip
tion of the horrible condition of affairs
in Cuba."
Senator Hawley, chairman of the
Committee on Military Affairs, alsopro
nounced it an able paper, and said that
he thought it â  ould meet with general
approval.
Senator Elkins, conservative Repub
lican, said: "It states the case admir
ably, and it will be sustained by the
people and Congress."
Senator Allison, chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, would
only say: "It is a very good message."
Senator Hale, conservative Republi
lican, and chairman of the Com
mittee on Naval Affairs, went fur
ther in his commendation, saying: "The
message is admirable in all respects,
and especially so in that it points out
the way whereby Cuba can get a good
Government and be free, and without
bringing us into awkward interest com
pli ations."
Henderson (R.) of lowa, one of the
Republican leaders, said: "The message
shows that the made no mistake
in electing William McKinley Presi
dent. We should uphold and sustain the
President and give him the power he
asks."
Grosvenor of Ohio said: "The mes
sage, when the hot blood, which has
been so properly incited by the course
of events, has had time to cool, will be
recognized as an able, patriotic and
wise state paper. The message will be
approved by all the civilized world.
Armed intervention to the great masses
of the people means war with' Spain
and free Cubaâ but free Cuba does not
necessarily involve the recognition of
any special existing Government. Cuba
will be free."

CANAL LEGISLATION.
I.OS ANGELES. April 11.â The twenty
second session of the California State
Fruit Growers' Convention met this

and operating of the Nicaragua canal,
and requests Senators and Congressmen

SANTA CRUZ, April 11.â Charles Har

against Minnie Plyler for mayhem, which
case is to be called in the Superior Court
on Wednesday, has left the city and his
whereabouts is unknown. Sheriff Besse
has returned from San Francisco, but
was unable to find his man.
A Child on the Doorstep.
Last night at about 9:30 o'clock John
Jianpaoli, who lives at 14^i Scott place,
heard knocks at his door. His wife open
ed the door, and on the stoop found a
child wrapped up In a shawl. Pinned to
the shawl was the following note: "This
child has no father or mother, as both
are dead. For God's sake give It a home
with you. It was born on December U2,
1897." Neighbors say they saw a poorly
dressed woman running away from the
house at about the time the child was
found. Mr. Jianpaoli says he will adopt
the child, as he has just lost two children
of his own.

Returning Consul Who Speak
in Glowing Words.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WAYCROSS, Ga., April 11.â Ever*
station along the route of Consul-Gen,
eral Lee's special train lavished ap
preciative tributes upon him. Tha
country fnr miles in the interior fur
nished ardent admirers, who came in
carts, wagons and on horseback.
Whenever the general stepped to the
rear platform at stations outbursts of
applause gTeeted him. Before reaching
Jasper, Fla., three telegrams were re
ceived on the train urging him to maka
his appearance so that the people could,
see him. Arriving there, the local com
pany of State troops and a score of
Confederate veterans with a wild J
crowd met him. In response to a speech
of welcome General Lee said:
"I thank you, sir, for your kind ex
pressions, I thank the American people
for the commendation they have shown
my administration as yo-ur Consul-Gen*
eral at Havana. I have never really
known until to-day how united tha
people are in sanctioning my course."
In the afternoon he endeavored to
get some sleep, but it was impossible.
The crowds would besiege the train an<J
even attempted to force the doors of
the private car in their frantic efforts
to see the popular general.
Waycros exceeded all previous points
in giving General Lee an ovation. As
the special train rolled through the
railroad yard every whistle and bell
pealed forth in welcome. Cannon roar
ed and musketry rattled, while 4000
wildly excited persons franctically
crowded up to the car. General Lee
was taken bodily from the car and was
introduced to the crowd by Colonel G.
S. McLendon of Georgia in the follow-
ing words:
"As long as human history Is -writ
ten, as long as human history is read,
the name of Lee ill shine out as a
beacon light on the shores' of truth and
honor and courage. This, gentlemen, is
Fitzhugh Lee of America,"
An afternoon ~aper in a big scare
head announced. "Lee for President in
1900."
The special train will reach Washing
ton about 2 o'clock to-morrow after
noon.
SAVANNAH, April 11.â At Savannah
more than 5000 persons were at the sta
tion to see General Lee when the train
came in. The crowd was enthusiastic
and a short speech was made, the gen
eral being frequently applauded. As
the train rolled into the station a pla
toon of the Chatham Artillery, of
which General Lee is an honorary
member, began firing a major-gener
al's salute of thirteen guns. General
Lee and the members of his party
were completely tired out by their long
trip. Orders were given here by the
transportation department of the Plant
system for operators north of this city
to withhold all information as to the
progress of the train, so as to prevent
the party being disturbed. The party
retired immediately after leaving Sa
vannah.

for the suffering, xhe unfortunates, being
for the most part women and children,
with aged and helpless men. enfeebled by
disease and hunger, could not have tilled
the soil without tools, seeds or shelter,

avowedly as a war measure in order to
rut off the resources of the insurgents,
worked its predestined result.
As I said in my message of last
December it was not civilized war
fare; it was extermination. The only
peace it could beget was that of the
wilderness and the grave.
Meanwhile, the military situation in the
island bad undergone a noticeable change.
The extraordinary activity that charac
terized the second year of the war, when
the Insurgents invaded even the hitherto
unharmed fields of Pinar del Rio and car
ried havoc and destitution up to the
vails of the city of Havana itself, had
relapsed Into a "dogged struggle in the

Even thus partially restricted, the revo

sential and sole basis of peace, seemed
aa far distant as at the outset.
In this state of affairs, my administra

the way to some form of honorable set
tlement. The assassination of the Prime
Minister, Canovas, led to a change of
Government in Spain. The former ad
ministration, which pledged subjugation
without concession, gave place to that
of a more liberal party, committed long
in advance to a policy of reform Involv
ing the wider principle of home rule for
Cuba and Puerto Rico. The overtures
of this Government made through its
new envoy. General Woodford, and look
ing to an Immediate effective ameliora
tion of the condition of the island, al
though not accepted to the extent of ad
mitted mediation in any shape, were met
by assurances that home rule in an ad
vanced phase would be forthwith offered
to Cuba, without waiting for the war to
end, and that more humane methods
should henceforth prevail in the conduct
of hostilities.
Incidentally with these declarations the
new Government of Spain continued and
completed the policy already begun by its
predecessor, of testifying friendly regard
lor this nation by "releasing American
citizens held under one charge or an
other connected with the insurrection, so
that, by the end of November, not a
Bingle person entitled in any way to our
national protection remained in a Span

While these negotiations were in prog
ress, the Increasing destitution of the
unfortunate reconeentrados and the
alarming mortality among them claimed
earnest attention. The success which bad

this end was acquiesced in by the Span
ish authorities.
On the. 24th of December last, I caused
to be issued an appeal to the American
people, inviting contributions in money or
in kind for the succor of the starving
sufferers in Cuba. Following this, on the
Bth of January, came a similar public an
nouncement of the formation of a central
Cuban relief committee, with headquar

members representing the American Na

business elements of the community. The

to their homes and aided to resume the
self-supporting pursuits of peace; public
works having been started to give them
employment, and a sum of $<500,000 has
been appropriated for their relief.
The war in Cuba is of such a nature
that, short of subjugation or extermina
tion, a final military victory for either
side seems impracticable. The alterna
tive lies in the physical exhaustion of the
one or the other party, or perhaps of both
â a condition which in effect ended the
ten years' war by the truce of Sanjon.
The prospect of such a protraction and
conclusion of the present strife is a con
tingency hardly to be contemplated with
equanimity by the civilized world, aivj
least of all by the United States, affected
and injured as we are, deeply and inti

Realizing this it appeared to be
my duty, in a spirit of true friendli

pie. Instead of a call to arms his

is weak, flabby and nerveless. On the

seek to bring about an immediate
termination of the war.
To this end I submitted, on the 27th ulti
mo, as a result of much representation
and correspondence through the United
States Minister at Madrid, propositions to
the Spanish Government, looking to an
armistice until October 1, for the negotia
tion of peace with the good offices of the

In addition, I asked the immediate revo
cation of the order of reconcentration, so
as to permit the people to return to their

provisions and supplies from the United
States, co-operating with the Spanish au
thorities so as to afford full relief.
The reply of the Spanish Cabinet was
received on the night of the 31st ultimo.

peace in Cuba, to confide the prepara

linal conference it is understood that the
Spanish Government stands ready to give
the Insular Congress full powers to set
tle the terms or peace with the insur
gents; whether by direct negotiation or
indirectly by means of legislation does
not appear.
With this last overture in the di
rection of immediate peace and its
disappointing reception by Spain
the executive was brought to the
end of his effort.
In my annual message of December
last. I said:
"Of the untried measures there remain
ârecognition of the insurgents as bellig
erents; recognition of the independence of
Cuba, and intervention to end the war
by imposing a rational compromise bt
tween the contestants and intervention
in favor of one or the other party. I
speak not of forcible annexation, for that
cannot be thought of. That, by our code
of morality, would be criminal aggres
sion."
Thereupon I reviewed these alternatives
in the light of President Grant's meas
ured words uttered in 1875, when, after
seven years of sanguinary, destructive
and cruel barbarities in Cuba, he reached
th<> conclusion that the recognition of
the independence of Cuba was impracti
cable and indefensible, and that the re
cognition of belligerency was not war
ranted by the facts, according to the
tests of public law. I commented es
pecially upon the latter aspect of the
question, pointing out the inconveniences
and positive dangers of a recognition of
belligerency which, while adding to the
already onerous burdens of neutrality
within our own jurisdiction, could not
in any way extend our influence or ef
fective offices in the territory of hostili
ties.

SUMMARY OF
THE MESSAGE.
WASHINGTON, April n.â
The message asks Congress to
authorize the President to take
measures to secure the termin
ation of hostilities in Cuba and
to secure the establishment of
a stable government there, and
to use the military and naval
forces of the United States as
may be necessary for those pur
poses. The President says the
only hope of relief from a con
dition which can no longer be
endured is the enforced pacifi
cation of the island.
The issue is now with Con
gress, and he awaits action,
6tanding prepared to carry out
every obligation imposed on
him by the constitution.
Spain's decree for a suspen
sion of hostilities is submitted
to Congress for just and care
ful attention.
The Maine incident figures
prominently in the message.
The President argues that the
wreck of the Maine in Havana
harbor shows that Spain is not
able to guarantee security to
foreign vessels.
Spain has offered to submit
to arbitration all the differ
ences which may arise from
that affair.
i
whom we have been, by force of evidence, ;
compelled to decide.
"It has thus been made known to the
world that the uniform policy and prac
tice of the United States is to avoid all
interference in disputes which merely re
late to the internal government of other
nations, and eventually to recognize the |
authority of the prevailing party without I
reference to our particular interests and
views or to the merits of the original
controversy. But in this, as in every
other occasion, safety is to be found in
a rigid adherence to principle.
"In the contest between Spain and the
revolting colonies we stood aloof and
waited not only until the ability of the
new States to protect themselves was
fully established, but until the danger of
their being again subjugateu had entirely
passed away. Then, and not until then,
were they recognized. Such was our
course in "regard to Mexico herself.
"It is true that with regard to Texas
the civil authority of Mexico had been
expelled, its invading army defeated, the
chief of the republic himself captured,
and all power to control the newly or
ganized Government of Texas annihilat
ed within Its confines. But. on the other
hand, there is, in appearance at least, an
immense disparity of physical force on
the side of Texas. The Mexican Repub
lic is now rallying its forces under a
new leader and menacing a fresh inva
sion to recover its lost domain.
"Upon the issue of this threatened in
vasion, the independence of Texas may
be considered as suspended, and were
there nothing peculiar in tne situation of
the United States and Texas, our ac
knowledgment of its Independence at
such a crisis could scarcely be regarded
as consistent with that prudent reserve
with which we have hitherio held our
selves bound to treat all similar ques
tions."
Thereupon Andrew Jackson proceeded

risk that there

States motives of

part to the terri
tory of Texas and of the avowed purpose
of 'the Texans in seeking recognition of
independence as an incident to the in
corporation of Texas in the Union, con
cluding thus:
"Prudence, therefore, seems to dictate
that we should stand aloof and maintain
our present attitude, if not until Mexico
itself or one of the great foreign powers
shall recognize the independence of the
new government, at least until the lapse
of time or the course of events shall have
proved beyond cavil or dispute the
ability of the people of that country to
maintain tholr separate sovereignty and
to uphold the government constituted by
them. Neither of the contending parties
can justly complain of this course. By
pursuing it we are but carrying out the
long-established policy of our Govern
ment, a policy which has secured to us
respect and Influence abroad and inspired
confidence at home."
These are the words of the resolute and
patriotic Jackson. They are evidence that
the United States, in addition to the test
imposed by public law as the condition
of the recognition of independence by a
neutral State (to wit: that the revolted
State shall "constitute in fact a body
politic, having a government in substance
as well as in name possessed of the ele
ments of stability" and forming de facto
"If left to itself a State among the na
tions, reasonably capable of discharging
Hie duties of a State"), has imposed for
its own goverance in dealing with cases
like these the further condition that rec
ognition of independent statehood is not
due to a revolt and dependency until the
danger of its being again subjugated by
the parent State has entirely passed
away. This extreme test was in fact ap
plied in the case of Texas. The Congress
to whom President Jackson referred the
question as "one probably leading to
war," and therefore a proper subject for
a "previous understanding with that body
by whom war alone can be declared, and
by whom all the provisions for sustaining
its perils must be furnished," left the
matter of recognition of Texas to the dis
cretion of the executive, providing mere
ly for /the sending of a diplomatic agent
when the President should be satisfied
that the republic of Texas had become
"an Independent State." It was so recog
nized by President Van Kuren, who com
missioned a Charge d'Affaires March 7,
1837, after Mexico had abandoned an at
tempt to conquer the Texan territory and
when there was at the time no bona fide
contest going on between the Insurgent
province and its former sovereign.
I said in my message of December last:
"It is to be seriously considered whether
the CuV>Â«n insurrection possesses beyond
dispute the attributes of statehood, which
alone can demand a recognition of bel
ligerency in its favor." The same require
ment must certainly be no less seriously
considered when the graver issue of
recognizing independence is in question,
for no less positive test can be applied to
the greater act than the lesser, while, on
the other hand, the
influences and con
sequences of the

when the recogni
tion of belligerency is concerned, are sec
ondary if not rightly eliminated factors.
The real question is whether the com
munity claiming recognition is or is not
independent beyond peradventure.
Nor from the standpoint of expe
rience do I think it would be wise
or prudent for this Government to
recognize at the present time the in
dependence of the so-called Cuban
republic.
Such recognition is not necessary In
order to enable the United States to inter
vene and pacify the island. To commit
this country now to the recognition of
any particular government in Cuba might
subject us to embarrassing conditions of
international obligation toward the or
ganization so recognized. In case of in
tervention our conduct will be subject to
the approval or disapproval of such gov
ernment. We would be required to sub
mit to its direction and to assume to it
the. mere relation of a friendly ally.
When it shall appear hereafter that there
is within the island a government capa
ble of performing the duties and dis
charging the functions of a separate na
tion, and having, as a matter of fact, the
proper forms and attributes of national
ity, such government can be promptly
and readily recognized and the relations
and interests of the United States with
such nation adjusted.
There remain the alternative
forms of intervention to end the war,
either as an impartial neutral by im
posing a rational compromise be
tween the contestants or as the act
ive ally of the one party or the
other.
As to the first, it Is not to be forgotten
that during the last few months the re
lation of the United States has virtually
been one of friendly intervention in many
ways, each not of itself conclusive, but all
tending to the exertion of a potential in
fluence toward an ultimate pacific re
sult, just and honorable to all interests
concerned. The spirit of all our acts
hitherto has been an earnest, unselfish
desire for peace and prosperity in Cuba,
untarnished by differences between the
United States and Spain and unstained
by the blood of American citizens.
The forcible

large dictates of numanity, and
following historical precedents where
neighboring States have interfered
to check the hopeless sacrifice of life
by intercine conflicts beyond their
cVoose between war and the abandon
ment of Cuba to such a future as may
seem good to the United Statesâ tells
the world surprisingly little. There is
not a word to suggest that Spain has in
any way sinned against the United
States or infringed upon international
law. The crisis arises from the deter
mination of the American Government
to depart from Washington's precepts,
and to meddle in affairs of a foreign
country."
The Daily Chronicle says: "President
McKinley has made many efforts for
peace; but this is greater and bolder
than any of them. His message calls
a halt by throwing upon Congress the
entire solemn responsibility of making
war. We believe, however, that the
situation is not materially changed.
War is still inevitable, unless Spain
makes concessions she has hitherto
shown no disposition to make."
The Daily Graphic says it thinks the
President's message would lead to war.
It says: Spain will of course resist in
tervention and war will ensue. But
borders, is justifiable on national
grounds.
It involves, however, hostile constraint
upon both the parties to the contest, as
well to enforce a truce as to guide the
eventual settlement.
The grounds for such intervention may
be briefly summarized as follows:
First â In the cause of humanity
to put an e-d to the barbarities,
bloodshed, starvation and horrible
miseries now existing there, and
which the parties to the conflict are
either unable or unwilling to stop or
mitigate. It is no answer to say this
is all in another country, belonging
to another nation, and is therefore
none of our business. It is exprsssly
our duty, for it is right at our door.
Second â We owe it to our citizens
in Cuba to afford them that protec
tion and indemnity for life and
property which no government there
can or will afford, and to that enu
terminate the conditions that de
prive them of legal protection.
Third â The right to intervene may
be justified by che very serious in
jury to the commerce, trade and
business of our people and by the
wanton destruction of property and
devastation of the island.
Fourth and which is of the utmost
importance â The present condi
tion of affairs in Cuba is a constant
menace to our peace, and entails upon
this Government an enormous ex
pense. With such a conflict waged
for years in an island so near us and
with which our people have such
trade and business relations â when
the lives and liberty of our citizens
are in constant danger and their
property destroyed and themselves
ruined â where our trading vessels
are liable to seizure and are seized
at our very door by warships of a
foreign nation, the expeditions of
filibustering that we are powerless to
prevent altogether, and the irritating
questions and entanglements thus
arising, all these
and others that I
need not mention,
with the result
ing strained rela
tions, are a con-
Spain's Fault That
the Maine
Was Destroyed.
stant menace to our peace and
compel us to keep on a semi-war
footing with that nation with which
we are at peace.
These elements of danger and dis
order already pointed out have been
strikingly illustrated by a tragic
event which has deeply and justly
moved the American people. I have
already transmitted to Congress the
report of the naval court of inquiry
on the destruction of the battle-ship
Maine in the harbor of Havana dur
ing the night of the 15th of Febru
ary. The destruction of that noble
vessel has filled the national heart
with inexpressible horror. Two hun
dred and fifty-eight brave sailors
and marines and two officers of our
navy, reposing in the fancied se
curity of a friendly harbor, have
been hurled to death; grief and want
brought in their homes, and sorrow
to the nation.
The Naval Court of Inquiry which, it
is needless to say, commands the un
qualified conilder.ee of the Government,
was unanimous In its conclusion that the
destruction of the Maine was caused by
an exterior explosion, that of a submarine
mine. It did not assume to place the re
sponsibility. That remains to be fixed.
In any event the destruction of
the Maine, by whatever exterior
cause, is a patent and impressive
proof of a state of things in Cuba
that is intolerable.
That condition is thus shown to be
such that the Spanish tJovernment cannot
assure safety and security to a vessel of
the American navy in the harbor of Ha
vana on a mission of peace and rightfully
there.
Further, deferring in this connection to
recent diplomatic correspondence, a dis
patch from our Minister to Spain, of the
26th ultimo, contained the statement that
the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs
has assured him positively that Spain
will do all that the highest honor and
justice requires in the matter of the
Maine. The reply above referred to. of
the 31st ultimo, also contained an expres
sion of the readiness of Spain to submit
to arbitration all the differences which
can arise in this matter which is sub
sequently explained by the note of the
Spanish Minister at Washington of the
10th instant, as follows:
"As to the Question of fact which
springs from the diversified views be
tween reports of the American and Span
ish boards, Spain proposes that the fact
be ascertained by an impartial investiga
tion by experts, which decision Spain ac
cepts in advance."
To this I have made no reply.

of the contest, the good offices of the
United States as mediator wore tendered
in good faith, without any sellish purpose

friendship for both parties, but were at
the time declined by Spain with the
declaration, nevertheless, that at a future

of working great injury and damage to

sooner or later, be invoked for the terÂ«
mination of the strife."
In the last. annual message 01 my 1mÂ«
mediate predecessor, during the pending
struggle, it was said:
"When the inability of Spain to deal
successfully with the insurgents has be-,
come manifest, and it is demonstrated,
that her sovereignty in Cuba is extinct
to all purposes of its rightful existence,
and when a hopeless struggle for its re*
establishment has degenerated Into tha
strife which means nothing more than
the useless sacrifice of human life anq
the utter destruction of the very subject
matter of the conflict, a situation will bÂ«
presented in which our obligations to thq
sovereignty of Spain will be supersede^
by higher obligations which we eaij
hardly hesitate to recognize and dlsÂ«
charge."
In my annual message to Congress,
December last, speaking to this question,
I said: "The near future will demon-,
strate whether the indispensable condi
tion of a righteous peace, just alike to
the Cubans and Spain, as well as equita
ble to our interests, so intimately In
volved in the welfare of Cuba, Is likely to
be attained. If not, the exigency of fur
ther and other action by the United
States will remain to be taken. When
that time comes that action will be de
termined in th^ line of indisputable right
and duty. It will be faced without mis*
giving or hesitancy in the lisjht of thÂ«
obligation this Oovornmt-nt owes to ltÂ«
self, to the people who have confided to
it the protection of their interests and
honor, and to humanity.
"Sure of the right, keeping free from
all offense ourselves, actuated by up
right and patriotic considerations, moved
neither by passion nor selfishness, the
Government will continue Its watchful
care over the rights and property of
American citizens and will abate none of
Its efforts to bring about by peaceful
agencies a peace which shall be honora
ble and enduring. If it shall hereafter
appear to be a duty imposed by our obli
gations to our-
I selves, to cfvillza
i tion and to hu
] inanity ;ind to in
tervene with force,
it shall be with
out fault on our
part and only be-
Spain Is Helpless,
America
Must Now Intervene.
cause the neees
! pity for such action will ho so clear as to
command the support and approval of
i the civilized world."
The long trial has proved that thÂ«
object for which Spain has waged thÂ«
war cannot be attained. The fire of
insurrection may flame or may
smolder with varying seasons, but
it has not been and it is plain that
it cannot be extinguished by present
methods. The only hope of relief and
repose from a condition which can
not longer be endured is the enforced
pacification of Cuba. In the name of
humanity, in the name of civiliza
tion, in behalf of endangered Ameri
can interests which give us the right
and the duty to speak and to act, the
war in Cuba must stop.
In view of these facts and vnesa
considerations I ask the Congress to
authorize and empower the President
to take measures to secure a full ter
mination of hostilities between the
Government of Spain and the people
of Cuba, and to secure in the island
the establishment of a stable govern
ment capable of maintaining order
and observing its international obli
; gations, insuring peace and tranquil
lity and the security of its citizens
as well as our own, and to use the
military and naval forces of the
i United States as may be necessary
for these purposes.
And In the interest of humanity and to
aid in preserving the lives of the starv
' ing people of the island, I recommend
that the distribution of food and supplies
be continued and that an appropriation
I be made out of the public treasury to
| supplement the charity of our citizens.
The issue is now with Congress.
i It is a solemn responsibility. I have
exhausted every effort to relieve the
intolerable condition of affairs which
iis at our doors. Prepared to execute
every obligation imposed upon me by
; the constitution and the law I await
your action.
Yesterday and since the preparation of
i the foregoing message, official lnforma
! tlon was received by me that the latest
| decree of the Queen Regent of Spain
' directs General Blanco, in order to pre
; pare and facilitate peace, to proclaim a
, suspension of hostilities, the duration and
i details of which have not yet been com
municated to me.
This fact, with every other pertinent
consideration, will, I am sure, have your
just and careful attention in the solemn
! deliberations upon which you are about
to enter. If this measure attains a sue
; cessful result, {hen our aspirations as a
Christian, peace-loving people will bd
realized. If it fails, it will be only an
i other justification for our contemplated
action. WILLIAM McKINLEY

Cuba, now denounced with such Phari
saical accounts of superiority.
There is every reason for believing
that neither Prince Bismarck nor any
one else of the slightest importance in
spires these tirades, but that they
should appear in a journal so widely
read as the Hamburger Nachrichten
ought to mollify the wrath of the or

they complain of the attitude of the far
more obscure foreign prints which oc
casionally fall foul of Germany.
DELAYED BY DIVORCE LAWS.
Sonoma Couple Wed After a Wait
of Weary Months.
SANTA ROSA. April 11.â Michael Mc-
Donough, aged 70. of Cloverdale. and
Mrs. Susie Baker, aged 53, of Healdsburg,
were married In this city to-day by Jus
tice of the Peace John Brown.
A few months a"o McDonough applied
to the County Clerk for a license to wed
Mrs. Baker, but that official refused to
comply with his request on the ground
that the State laws forbid a divorced
person marrying a second time within a
year after the granting of the divorce.
When the County Clerk took this stand
Mrs. Baker anolied to the courts here to
compel that official to issue McDonough
the license, but the court denied the ap
plication and the couple had to wait the
allotted time. The year being up a few
days ago, they were married to-day.

Senate and House Hear
the Recommendation
of the President.

Silent-Republicans Applaud
the Plea for Intervention.
Democrats Groan.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â The Presi
dent's message was read in the House
to-day in the pi once of a vast as
semblage and referred to the Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs without debate.
There was absolutely no demonstration
cither df nnnr *al or disapproval from
the crowded galleries throughout, and
at the conclusion of the reading there
was a sharp burst of applause from the
Republican Bide when toward the close
of the message the President said the
war In Cuba must cease. At the con
clusion of the reading about half the
Republicans applauded nr.d several
Democrats groaned. After the message
had been read a ' referred the House
transacted some District of Columbia
business.
Postmaster Oenernl Gary and Secre
tary of Agriculture Wilson were on the
floor just t.. ore the House convened.
As the hsjnds of th clock pointed to
noon the Speaker entered the House
and the hubbub ceased and the chap
lain 1111 11 % il the divln > aid In the crisis.
Immeditedly after the reading of the
Journal a contest arose between the
Committee on Foreign Relations and
the Committee on the District of
Columbia over the right of way, and
while the wrangle that followed, to the
mystification of the eager visitors in
the galleries, was slight. Major Pruden,
the President's executive clerk ap
peared In the main aisle bearing the
message.
Instantly the whispered word passed
ur<>und the densely packed galleries,
"The message," "The message." It was
like an electric shock. A hush fell on
the assemblage. The speaker arose,
and Major Pruden announced the mes-
Aa it was carried d wn the aisle
the galleries leaned over with breath
less Interest, the members settle. l in
their chairs. The seal of the envelope
v. us broken by the Speaker himself and
the message was handed to the clerk.
"The chair submits the message of
the President of the United States,"
announced the Speaker in clear, dis
tinct tones.
As the reading began the ticking of
the Clock could have been heard so in
tense was the silence. Every ear was
strained.
Maiiy members leaned over on their
ri.-sk.s with their hands to their ears
to hotter catch the momentous words
which fell from the lips of the clerk.
Th<> latter read in a loud clear voice,
but in a men tonous tone, with no at
tempt at emph is or declamation. But
the words needed no declamation
in add to their present import.
There were no demonstrations of ap
proval or disapproval until toward the
latter part of the message came the
words "this war must stop." it was
greeted with a round of applause from
alvut every quarter of the Republican
side. The galleries gave no sign. When
the rending was concluded a scattering
outburst came from th-J Republican
Kide, mingled with a few groans from
the Democratic side. Agair the gal
l-rir>s were siknt.
The Speaker in, lediately announced
the reference of the message and ac
companying papers to th- Committee
on Foreign Affairs nnd without further
action the House proceeded to the con
sideration of District of Columbia busi
ness.
Immediately the House -was In an
uproar. The spe tators flocked from
the galleries and the members retired
to the cloak rooms and the lobbies to
discuss the message. The Speaker was
obliged to rap frequently for order.
After some District of Columbia busi
ness had been transacted the contested
election case of Fairchild vs. Ward,
from the Eighteenth New York Dis
trict, was taken up. After two hours'
debate the majority report, in favor
of Ward, the sitting member, was
adoptedâ l3^-42.
At 4:f>s the House adjourned.

WASHINGTON, April 11.â In the
Senate to-day every available seat,
both on the floor and in the galleries,
wns occupied befor Vice-President
Il"l>art's gavel railed the Senate to or
der. In the galleries people had been
waiting for hours, but the arrange
ments for handling' the crowds were so
admirable that not the slightest con
fusion existed. The attendance of Sen
ators was unusually large, and every
member of the body in the city was in
his seat. Among the visitors on the
lloirr was General Nelson A. Miles,
commander-ln-chief of the army. In
the diplomatic gallery were Sir Julian
Pauncefote, the Austrian Minister and
party; Mr. Constantin Bruun, Minister
of Denmark; Mr. Charles F. Adams,
First Secretary of the British Lega
tion, and Miss Adams; Chancellor
Boeufve, from the French Legation;
Dr. Yola, Secretary of the Legation of
Guatemala; Mr. J. B. Proda, the Swiss
Minister, and three attaches of the
Chinese Legation. Several of the gen
tlemen were accompanied by ladies.
The galleries presented a brilliant
scene. Many of the ladies were attired
in the most fetching Easter finery, and
the handsome display of gowns and
bonnets was notable, even in this city
of beautiful dressing. Scarcely had
the Senate been called to order when
Quay of Pennsylvania precipitated the
Cuban question by presenting some pe
titions and making startling comments
upon them. He took the strongest
ground for immediate and impetuous
action.
'"The people of the United States, in
my judgment," said he, "'are pretty
nearly unanimous that the time for
negotiations upon the Cuban question
is, past; the present is a case for nel
1 ther Pope, prelate nor presbytery.
â¢ They believe that further negotiations
mean further time for the concentra-
I tion of the Spanish naval forces and
! for general Spanish preparations for
war. They know that a Spanish tor- |
pedo flotilla is en route for our shores, !
whose mission is hostile, whose only;
interest can be to destroy our vessels
aa the Maine was destroyed and slay
our sailors as the sailors of the Maine
were slain. They know that on yes- ;
j terday two Spanish war vessels sailed
; westward and will be with us in ten
: days. They believe that bloodshed will
I be averted or dii-.inished by the prompt
action of our Government, not by de
| daring war, but making war in self
defense before Spain can secure other
further navaJ or military advantage,
and, perhaps without reason, that de
lay is largely sought or urged by those
â¢ interested in the Spanish success or by
those who would market the national I
honor and m** 1 -" merchandise of the;
blood and hones of the Maine- that in
tervention should be armed, immediate
! and impetuous; that not merely a sta- >
I ble, but a republican form of govern
men should be given the Cubans; that
! the Spaniards should get out of Cuba.
They should not stand upon the order
of their going, but go a. once. For
| these purposes they believe the army
j and navy of the United States should
j be utilized until Cuba is free and the '
i Maine is avenged. Believing that the j
President is, in his ultimate purposes, '
with the people, I have pleasure in as- i
j suring the Trades League of Philadel- '
; phia that I will comply with their re- !
! quest."
Even when Quay was speakine. Ma
jor Pruden, the legislative secretary to
: the President, entered the chamber
I bearing the long-expected message. He
was recognized â Â« soon as Quay had
; concluded, and when he had presented
I the message the Vice-President imme- !
i diately laid it before the Senate. In a
j stillness that was atoms', breathless
the message was read, the reading oc
cupying forty-two minutes. At the
conclusion of the reading there was a
hum of whispered conversation in the
galleries, but no demonstration.
Davis of Minnesota, chairman of the ;
Foreign Relations Committee, at once ;
j moved that it be referred to his com- '
mittee. and Stewart of Nevada, taking
, advantage of the opportunity, briefly |
addressed the Senate in favor of recog- j
nizing the independence of the Cuban
insurgents. Without further debate i
the message was referred as requested, j
Stewart said that while he did not j
' care at this time to discuss the gen- |
era] question he desired to submit some
' remarks bearing upon the message. lie
sharply criticised the position taken
by the President, saying it seemed cvi- I
dent to him (Stewart) that the pro- :
j posed intervention would precipitate â¢
| what would prove to be a war of con- j
quest. lie hoped there would be no !
intervention that did not recognize the
rights of the Cubans, who had been
Struggling for years for their independ
ence. He believed we ought not to go
to Cuba with an armed force unless we !
went with the Intention of recogniz- j
ing the rights and authority of the Cv- i
j ban Republic officials and of Joining
with the insurgents to assist them in I
; winning their freedom and independ- j
, ence. Stewart declared that in the i
; circumstances a war with Spain would ;
â¢ be a war with which the European '
powers would have nothing to do The 'â 
Maine disaster alone was in itself an I
; act of war. and this country would be
fully justified In proceeding to extreme '
! measures on that subject. The people, I
j said Stewart, had put the crime against j
the Maine ahead, in point of considera
tion, of every other feature of the Cu
ban question, and they would heartily
approve of a war with Spain to wipe
out the stnin upon this country pro
duced by that foul Spanish plot. He
insisted that no war might, however to
be precipitated that did not include the I
Cuban insurgents as allies to our arms. !
If this country should recognize the in- !
dependence of Cuba, the people would i
applaud the action from the Atlantic j
to the Pacific, because it would mean !
the freedom of an oppressed and down
trodden people.
Butler of North Carolina, in rising
to offer a resolution, said that it was j
perfectly evident that the message Just :
read did not mean the independence of ]
Cuba for which the patriots of the is- ;
iaad had been so^ long struggling. "TheJ
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 1898.
COMMUNICATION
WITH GEN. LEE
ON THE MAINE
Representation by the Consul That
Americans Were in Danger Caused
the Battle=ship to Be Doomed.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â The con
| sular correspondence with regard to
| the situation in Cuba, which was trans
mitted to-day, was prepared in re
sponse to resolutions of inquiry adopted
by both the House and Senate. The
correspondence was prepared for trans
mission to Congress just before the
blowing up of the Maine, and having
been held since, now Includes com
munications up to April 1.
The correspondence in part was de
voted to the Maine disaster and some
important and interesting points are
developed. The correspondence con
sists largely of cablegrams exchanged
by Assistant Secretary of State Day
and Consul General Lee. The first of
i the telegrams is dated in Havana, Jan
uary 12 and relates to the riots which
were then occurring in the city. This
r..nd the subsequent telegrams upon the
same subject have been published
either in whole or in part.
On January 24 General Lee was no
tified by the State Department that the
Maine was to call at Havana in a day
or two and was directed to make ar
rangements for an interchange of
friendly calls between officers and au
thorities.
Under the same date General Lee ad
vised a postponement of the Maine's
visit for six or seven days so that the
excitement might abate.
Later in the same day Mr. Lee was
advised that the Maine would arrive in
Havana the next day and was asked to
co-operate with the authorities for her
friendly visit.
"Wiring next day General Lee in
f.irmed the State Department that the
Spanish authorities professed to think
the United States had an ulterior pur
pose in sending the ship.
"They say it will obstruct autonomy,
produce excitement and probably a
demonstration. They ask that it be not
done until they can get instructions
from Madrid, and say that if it is in
tended for friendly motives, as claimed,
delay is unimportant."
The telegrams from January 25 to
February 4 relate merely to the recep
tion of the Maine and the exchange of
visits between her officers and the
naval and civil authorities in Havana.
On February 4 Assistant Secretary
Day informed General Lee that the
Secretary of the Navy thought it im
prudent, for sanitary reasons, to keep
the Maine long in Havana. He asked
if some vessel had bc>n kept there all
the time ai.d requested his views.
In reply General Lee said he thought
there would be no danger to the health
CORRESPONDENCE
OF CONSULS ON THE
HORRORS IN CUBA
WASHINGTON, April 11.â The com
munications included in General Lee's
report make about 65,000 words. The
report covers the communications of
Consul-General Lee at Havana; Con
sul McGars at Cienfugas, Consul Brice
at Matanzas, Consul Hyatt at Santiago
de Cuba and Consul Barker at Sagua
la Grande. They deal largely with
i the distress and suffering which exist
in all the districts, but General Lee
; reports quite fully upon the decrees of
I the Government with regard to auto
nomy and other political phases of the
i situation.
In preparing the correspondence for
transmission to Congress considerable
portions of the important communica
tions, and especially those marked
"confidential." are omitted. The reso
lutions to which they are the response
asked only for such correspondence as it
was deemed not incompatible with the
public itnerest to make public. General
Lee's correspondence runs ovÂ«r the pe
riod from November 17, 1595, to April,
IS9B. Much of the correspondence is of
a confidential nature, and of some of the
important communications excerpts only
are given.
A dispatch from General Lee contains
General Blanco's order, under date <>f
November 13. repealing or rather modify
ing General "Weyler's order of concentra
tion, which has heretofore been published
by the press. This order was made short
ly after General Lee returned to Havana
from the United States last fall. General
Lee in this communication also enclosed
the proclamation of J. M. Rodriguez,
Major-General in charge of the western
department of the Cuban military oper-
-itloiiK, addressed to the Cuban people and
informing them of the "firm resolution"
of the insurgent army to continue fight
ing until the attainment of absolute in
dependence. It was on November 23 that
Consul-General Lee made his first report
to the Department of State on the condi
tion of affairs in Cuba. It is as follows:
Vnited State's Consulate General, Havana,
Nov. 23 --Sir: I have the honor to briefly sub
mit a statement of what appears to be the
present condition of affairs in this Island.
Firstâ The Insurgents will not accept au
tonomy.
Secondâ A large majority of the Spanish sub
jects, who have commercial and business In
terests and own property here, will not ac
cept autonomy, prefer annexation to the
United States rather than an Independent re
public or genuine autonomy and the Spanish
flap.
Third â The Spnnlsh authorities are sincere in
doing all In their iwwer to encourage, pro
tect and promote the grinding of Mit,-ar. The
grinding season commences in December.
Fourthâ The Insurgent leaders have given In
structions to prevent grinding wherever it can
be done, because by diminishing the export of
sugar the Spanish revenues are decreased. I(
will be very difficult for the Spanish authori
ties to prevent cane burning. DCCfcUM one man
at night can start a fire which will burn hun
dreds of acres, Just as a single Individual
could light a prairie by throwing a match
Into the dry grass.
Fifthâ l am confident that General Blanco
and General Tando. his chief of staff, ac well
as Dr. Congosto, Secretary General, with all
of whom I have had conversations, are per
President." said he, "merely asks us
to authorize him to stop the war in
Cuba. That could not be done until
the Spanish flag was hauled down from
the island forever." Butler then pre
sented his resolution which follows:
Whereas, The destruction of the United
States battleship Maine and the mur
dering of 366 of our sailors in Havana
harbor by the Spanish Government is an
act of war on the part of Spain against
the United States; therefore be It re
solved.
Firstâ That to avenge this most foul
and unparalleled crime, which our na
tional b.qi\or demands, and to nut a stoa
of the vessel's crew before May. Lee
further said:
We should not relinquish position of
peaceful control of the situation or the
conditions will be worse than if the ves
sel had never been sent. Americans are
departing with their families in haste
on account of the distrust of the
preservation of order by authorities. If
another riot occurs it will be against
the Governor-General and autonomy,
but it might include an anti-American
demonstration also. A first-class bat
tleship should replace the present one
to serve as an object lesson and to
counteract the Spanish opinion of our
navy, and it should have a torpedo
boat with it to preserve communication
with the admiral.
The next telegram of importance was
sent by General Lee early on the morn
ing of February 16, announcing to the
State Department the destruction of
the Maine. That telegram has been
published. During the forty-eight hours
that followed General Lee kept the de
partment informed of the occurrences
in chronological order. In a dispatch of
February 28 he said after the divers
under Captain Sigsbee had made a
cursory examination of the wreck:
"The Spanish Government would like
to unite with ours in having the bottom
of the ship and harbor in the vicinity
jointly examined."
The next day Day Informed Lee that
his Government had already consti
tuted an investigation of the disaster,
â which would be conducted indepen
dently. He added, however: "This
Government will afford every facility
it can to the Spanish authorities in
whatever investigation they may see
fit to make on their part."
The first intimation of the cause of
the explosion was Riven by General Lee
on February 22, when he telegraphed:
"Copper cylinders of ammunition found
intact in 10-inch forward magazine
starboard side this morning. Seems to
show that magazine has not exploded.
Evidence is beginning to prove an ex
plosion on the port side by a torpedo."
General Lee informed the department
on February 28 that arrangement
had been conducted for both Govern
ments to conduct independent investi
gations of the disaster. His corre
spondence with General Blanco is
transmitted in full. In concluding hia
letter to Blanco General Lee said: "I
am quite sure that neither Government
has any other object except to ascer
tain all the fa.cts connected with the
explosion of the Maine and that the
groat desire of both Governments is to
proceed harmoniously with the work."
At this point correspondence between
General Lee and th" ritate Department
concerning the Maine disaster abruptly
terminates so far as the report sub
mitted to Congress is concerned.
fertly conscientious in their desire to relieve
the distress of those suffering from the effects
of Weyler's reconcentration order, but. unfor
tunately, they have not the means to carry
out such benevolent purposes. â¢ â¢ â¢
In this city matters are assuming better
shape under charitable commissions, etc.: large
numbers are now cared for and fed by private
subscription. â¢ â¢ â¢
I witnessed many terrible scenes and saw
some die while I was present. I am told Gen
eral Blanco will give $100,000 to the relief
fund.
November 27 General Lee sent to the
department the communications of two
gentlemen, whose names he says are
suppressed for obvious reasons, but
whom he knows personally, as standing
high in the community, concerning the
conditions in Los Fosos (the ditches), in
Havana. The communication says,
among other things: "Four hundred and
sixty women and children, thrown on the
ground, heaped pell-mell as animals,
some in a dying' condition, others sick,
others dead, without the' slightest clean
liness or the least help, not able to give
water to the thirsty, without religious or
social help, all dying wherever chance
laid them."
The communication -goes on to state
that the deaths among these reconcen
trados averaged forty or fifty dally,
and that on an average there were but
ten days of life for each person. It says
that these unhappy- creatures received
food only after having been eight days
in the ditches, during which time they
were obliged to subsist upon the bad
food which the dying had refused. Some
horrible instances of distress witnessed
are given.
January 8, General Lee makes the fol
lowing report:
â 
r, I Ki 1 i iaV c . the . honor to state, as a matter of
public Interest, that the reconcentrados act of
,;7"T i v.'u .'' >' ler . formerly Governor General of
tins island, transformed about 400.000 self-sup
Â£.'! n ? ,'"â '' â '''"â â¢ principally women and chil
dren, into a multitude to be sustained by the
contributions by others or to die of starvation
or of fever, resulting from a low physical con
dition an.l being massed In large bodies, with
out change of clothing and without food. Their
homes were burned, their fields and plantations
destroyed and their livestock driven away or
destroyed. I estimate that probably 200.000.>f the
rural population in the province of Pinar del
Kio. Havana, Matanzas and Santa Clara have
died of starvation from resultant causes and
the deaths of whole families . almost simulta
neously, or within a few days of each other,
and of mothers praying for their children to be
relieved of their horrible sufferings by death
are not the least of the many pitiable scenes
which were ever present. In the provinces of
Puerto Principe and Santiago de Cuba, where
the "reconcentrado order" could not be en
forced the great mass of : the people are self
supporting, a daily average of 10 cents 1 worth
of food to 20,000 would be an expenditure of
5-000 per day, and. of course the most humane
efforts upon the part of _ our citizens cannot
hope to accomplish such a gigantic relief, and
a great portion of these people will have to be
abandoned to their fate. '
Under date of December 18, General
Lee sent a communication to the depart
ment recommending measures for relief
of the reconcentrados. :In the portion
given out General Lee says:
I see no effect of the governmental distribu
tion to the reconcentrados.' I am Informed
that only $12,500 in Spanish silver has been
dedicated to the Havana Province out of the
Jl oo,ooo said to have been set aside for the
purpose of relieving them on the Island, and
that reports from all parts of the province show
to Spaln"s most cruel, barbarous and In
human warfare now being waged against
Cuba, which is demanded in the interest
or liberty and humanity; that the Gov
ernment of the United States hereby rec
ognizes the Cuban Republic as a separate
and independent nation.
Secondâ That the Government of the
United States hereby demands that Spain
at once withdraw her land and naval
forces from Cuba
Third-That the President of tHe United
States be and he is hereby authorised,
empowered and directed to use, if neoes
sary. the entire land and naval forces of
the United States to carry these resolu
tions into effect.
General Lee Inclosed in this commu
nication an editorial from the Diario
de la Marina, which vigorously de
nounced the "seditious tumult" of the
day before as a victory for Gomez and
the enemies of Spain. On the same
day he also sent to the department
some statistics about the mortality in
Santa Clara, showing that while there
were 5459 deaths In that town in the
seven years previous to 1897, which in
cluded 1487 in one year from an epi
demic of yellow fever, there were in
1897, owing to the concentration order,
6910 deaths out of a total population of
14,000. The death rate increased
monthly from 78 in January, the month
before the concentration order went
into effect, until December, when there
were 14.000 deaths.
On January 12, 13, 14 and 15 General
Lee sent brief cablegrams to the de
partment with regard to the rioting
and the demonstrations against auton
omy and Blanco and the four news
paper offices. January 14 he said some
of the rioters "threatened to go to the
United States Consulate."
"Ships," he said, "are not needed,
but may be later. If Americans are in
danger ships should move promptly for
Havana. Uncertainty and excitement
widespread."
The rioting ceased the next day and
General Lee reported all quiet.
On the ISth General Lee sent a dis
patch marked confidential regarding
the rioting. It was:
Sirâ The recent disorders in this city
are primarily attributed to a group of
Spanish officers who were Incensed at
articles appearing' in three of the news
papers of Havana, El Reconcentrado,
La Discusion and El Diario de la Ma
rina. The first was very pronounced
a-gainst General Weyler and his meth
ods; La Discusion had boon suppressed
by Weyler, but publication was per
mitted to be resumed by Blanco, and
the last had been an anti-Spanish or
gan, but had been converted by the
present authorities to autonomy. It is
probable that the Spanish officers were
as provoked by the denunciation of
Weyler in the columns of one of these
papers and determined to stop it, and
afterward being supported by them,
turned the demonstration into an anti
autonomistic affair. Â» * â¦
I send to-day an analysis of the au
tonomistle plan. The intense opposition
to it on the part of the Spaniards arises
from the fact that the first appoint
ments of officers to put into effect its
provisions was made generally outside
of their party in order to show the
Cubans In arms that autonomy was
absolutely for their benefit and protec
tion. â¢ â¢ â¢
The intelligent Spaniards see no pros
perity in the future, but rather otherwise
and more confusion, in the same old at
tempts to make the waters of commerce
flow In unnatural channels. The lower
Spanish classes have nothing 1 in mind
when autonomy is mentioned except
Cuban local rule, hence their opposition.
â¢ â¢ â¢ FITZHUGH LEE.
that 50 per cent have already died and that
many of those left will die, and most of these
are women and children. â¢ â¢ â¢ I am in
formed an order has been issued In some parts
of the Islands suspending the disposition to
reconcpntrndos. The condition of those peo
ple is simply terrible. I hear of much suffering
in the Spanish hospitals for want of food. I
hear also that the Spanish merchants In some
parts of the Islands ara placing their establish
ments in the name of foreigners to avoid hav
ing their provlsloils purchased on credit by the
military administration, in some parts of the
island, I am told, there is scarcely any food
for soldiers and citizens, and that even cats are
used for food purposps, selling for 30 cents
apiecfi. It is a fair Inference to draw from
existing conditions that it is not possible for
the Governor-General to relieve the present
situation with the means at his disposal. â¢ â¢ â¢
December 14 General Lee sent another
communication that the total number of
reconcentradoÃ in Havana Province will
reach 150,000 and that the death rate from
starvation alone will be over 50 per cent.
For the relief of these people, he says,
$12,500 in silver had been sot aside, "so
that if every dollar appropriated reached
them, the distribution will amount to
about 17 cents to a person, which, of
course, would be rapidly exhausted, and
as I can hear of no further succor be
ing afforded, it is easy to perceive wha'
little practical relief has taken place in
the condition of these poor people."
December 29 Lee makes the first com
munication about the new scheme of au
tonomy. He says that he has been in
formed that the authorities are engaged
in forming an autonomistic Cabinet, ar
ranging for the members to take the re
quired oath on January l, and "also for
an election thirty days thereafter."
General Lee acknowledges the receipt
of President MeKinley's proclamation,
calling upon the people of the United
States to make charitable contributions
for the relief of the distress in Cuba,
Other telegrams follow during the next
few days as to the class of contribution,
with a view of relieving the suffering.
Conditions existing in the various prov
inces are covered liy the reports of con
suls. Here is a specimen of all of them.
From the province of Santa Clara Consul
Barker writes on March 24:
When Spain will admit defeat, no mortal, in
my humble Judgment, dare predict. That her
plan of settlement, autonomy, is a failure is not
to be questioned. Pending this admission on
her part, thousands of human beings, guilt
less of crime or having any part in the insur
rection, are dying for want of sustenance. This
condition must continue to increase. The
United States, in taking action relative to Cuba
â which seems inevitable â desires to avoid a
clash with Spain. Then let Congress alter our
citizenship laws by amending the statute rela
tive to the declaration required of persons be
coming citizens by naturalization, . so that the
subjects or citizens of any Government at pres
ent residing in Cuba may go before any United
States Consul on the island and make declara
tion of intention of becoming a citizen of the
United States,, which shall entitle them to
recognition as citizens until the expiration of
two years, when they may be required to re
side In the United States until five years shall
have elapsed before being granted naturaliza
tion papers. With such a privilege. I am con
fident that the per cent of resident Spaniards,
the hitherto dominant party and taxpayers, will
avail themselves of this opportunity for re
buking the mother country for attempting to
foist upon them changes In the existing laws
of the island. Such a step would r cause the
subjects as well as â  the Government to ac
quiesce without disturbance and without the
loss of the Island.
The resolution went over under the
rules.
Another message from the President
transmitting the Cuban consular re
ports was laid before the Senate, and,
after being read, was referred with ac
companying papers to the Committee
on Foreign Relations.
The Senate then, at 1.15 p. m., on
motion of Allison, adjourned.
Honesty and truth are good and ad
mirable qualities, as sympathy and
love are endearainÂ§ traits.

a Victory.

HAVANA, April 11.â La Lucha, with
regard to the edict of suspending hos
tilities, says: Diplomacy has absolute
! ly triumphed, though it is impossible
j to appreciate up to now which side is
i victor. Many Americans and Spaniards
! think that victory has been won by
j McKinley. In Madrid the triumph is
given to Spain, because she yields, not
to the demands of McKinley, but to the
demands of the great powers and the
Pope. If the rebels do not accept the
armistice and regard it as an imposi
tion from the Americans McKinley will
be the defeated one, since he arrogated
to himself the role of protector, but he
has been shown in his true light as a
master of selfish motives. It is un
known whether the rebels will accept
the armistice. It is evident that Spain
for her part has fulfilled all that has
been sought by the United States.
Under the circumstances it will be an
immense advantage if the rebels refuse
I an armistice, for the McKinley Govern
i ment will be defeated because it desired
' peace and no war.

HALIFAX, N.S., April 11.â The Amer

ship Amazonas) arrived here this morn
ing at 11 o'clock, short of coal. Both
j vessels left London on the 27th ult. and
had a stormy passage during the last
eight days. On Monday, the 4th, heavy
winds and rain were met with. The
ships were together up to that date,
but on Tuesday became separated and
; did not come together until twenty
four hours had elapsed. The San
Francisco came through all right, but
: the New Orleans experienced great dif
ficulty, one of her starboard boats be
ing smashed in and the steering gear
i was for a time deranged. As she came
up'this morning evidences of her rough
: passage was easily discernible. Prep
arations were quickly made to load coal
and the ships will be ready to sail by
' to-monfow. Great excitement prevailed
1 in the city when the signal station an
nounced the approach of the ships. The
San Francisco exchanged salutes with
the forts here and the officers reported
to the authorities shortly after enter
ing port. All hands on both ships are
in good health.

OF HER OWN ARMY,
Military Element of Spain Strongly
Opposes the Armistice and
Threatens Demonstrations.

Monday, says: The Spanish Govern
ment has stopped thousands of tele
grams reporting that the resolution to
grant an armistice was imposed by tha
European powers and further negotia
tions with Washington are taking
place. The news caused very deep im
pressions all over Spain, especially in
military circles. The military element
strongly opposes the armistice. The
Government has tr'.en extraordinary
precautions in Madrid and the pro*
vinces, fearing rioting and demonstra
tions and chiefly fearing the attitude
of the army.

FRESNO, April 11. â Mrs. R. A. Long, sister-in-law of Coroner Long
of this city, was burned to death at her home in Hanford this after
noon. She was in the kitchen Ironing, when a gasoline stove explod
ed. The oil covered her clothes and set the house on fire Instantly.
Flames enveloped the unfortunate woman from head to foot. She was
alone and ran from the house screaming for help.
Neighbors heard her cries and ran to her assistance. Flames en
veloped Mrs. Long, and she was running about in a frantic manner
and screaming with pain. The clothing burned fiercely about her
head and body, scorching the flesh horribly. The neighbors procured
blankets and tried to extinguish the flames, but their efforts were made
too late. When the fire was finally extinguished she was carried to
the house of a neighbor, where she received every attention. She sur
vived the frightful accident only an hour, however, dying at 5:30
o'clock.
Dr. Long of this city left immediately for Hanford upon receipt of
the shocking news. The woman's husband is R. A. Long, and he
conducts a transfer business in Hanford. Mrs. Long was 30 years of
age and had three children.

NO INJURY TO
SCAVENGERS
Mayor Phelan Explains
the Provisions of the
New Resolution.
Veto of thÂ© Contract for Re
pairing Third Street
Pavement.
Devany Determined to Put a Stop to
Slot Machines Used by Saloons
and Cigar Stands.
Mayor Phelan has addressed a com
munication to the Scavengers' Union, In
reply to their petition requesting him to
veto the order passed by the Supervisors
at their last meeting, in which he denies
that the order is prejudicial to their busi
ness or that It will injure the scavengers
in any manner. The Mayor states that
the Board of Health will not require the
use of any particular make of carts, but
will only Insist upon garbage wagons
being water-tight and covered. Regard-
Ing the resolution passed declaring In
favor of a tax levy to enable the board
to enter into a contract for the removal
of garbage at the city's expense, Mayor
Phelan informs the union that the proper
course to take is to protest to the board
next September, when the levy is made,
or else secure the contract itself for its
members.
At yesterday's meeting of the board the
Mayor presented nis veto of the resolu
tion awarding the contract for repairing
the bituminous pavement on Third street,
between Mission and Howard, io Fllnn &
Treacy. This is the job recently exposed
by The Call, wh "in the Supervisors ig
nored the bid Of J. J. Dowling of $575 and
awarded the contract to Fllnn & Treacy
at $2099. When Dowling's bid was called
to the attention of the board, Supervisor
Britt said that Dowling had bid for the
work under a misapprehension. The mat
ter went over until last week, when Dowl
ing was called upon lor an explanation.
His statement was lamentably weak, but
the board accepted it and awarded the
contract to the other linn, In his veto
message, the Mayor said:
"Mr. Dowling admitted before the
Board of Supervisors that if the contract
were awarded to him he would do the
work, and 1 recommend that it be so
awarded."
Devany offered an amendment to the
resolution presented by Delany last week
regarding the licensing of nickel-in-the
slot machines. Devany's amendment ex
pressly prohibits the licensing of all such
machines paying winners in drinks, ci
gars or their equivalent. The effect of
this order would be to abolish all such
machines, which is Devany's object. The
matter was referred to the License Com
mittee.
The Equitable Gas Light Company hied
a bond of $5000, insured by the National
Surety Company, as a guarantee for prop
erly repairing the following streets after
laying mains thereon: Stockton, from
Slitter south and across Market; Post,
from Stockton east to and across Mont
gomery; Sutter street the same.
The board passed a resolution to sus
pend the one-twelfth act, so as to admit
of expenditures being provided and paid
for the lighting 01 public buildings, owing
to the insfllciem-v o. the fund for that
purpose. The deficiency is $14,000.
It was decided to authorize the clerk to
advertise for bids for repairing all bit
uminous streets for a term of two years.
The bids for laying stone sidewalks on
Mabujl .-irt-Â«-t, betwetMl Geary and.O'Far
rell. received on- April 4. were. rejected. Â»
Jnbr. P. â¢â â 'â¢â¢â â . â â â : . .fn pointed to
take charge of insane patients temporar
ily detained at the City Hall, at a salary
of $75 a month, and Mrs. Nellie E. Wright
and Miss Louise Malloy were apolnted
matrons at $60 a month each.
The board staved off for another week
the request of the Mutual Electric Light
Company for permission to extend its
service, in order that it may be prepared
to enter into competition for the public
lighting contract; also the petition of the
Merchants' Association for the lighting of
public streets by electricity, by adopting
a resolution referring the matter to the
committee of the whole and fixing the
date of the meeting at 10 o'clock next
Saturday. As the present contract for
lighting public buildings expires on May
1. there is little chance of the Mutual
Company being given a chance to make
good its guarantee to save the city $40,000
a year on the present cost.
Mayor Phelan asked that the final pass
age of the award of the contract for re
paying Market street with blturn<"T i.-.
postponed one week, in order that H. E.
Huntington might confer with the Street

MISS SLAVAN'S HEARING.
Colonel Parnell Will not Appear in
the Role of Prosecutor.
Colonel Parnell, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren, is considerably annoyed at the po
sition in which he thinks the Superin
tendent of Schools is evidently trying to
place him relative to the matter of the
investigation of Miss Slavan, one of the
teachers of the Cleveland Primary School.
Several weeks ago a number of the lit
tle pupils of that school called upon Mrs.
Prescott, the assistant secretary of the j
society, and told her a shocking tale to
the effect that their teacher, who is a
sister of the principal, is given to the
use of language not fit to be uttered by
a lady and a teacher of the young. Sec
retary Parnell communicated to Superin
tendent Webster the substance of what
the children had told the officers of the I
society, saying that he believed the in
vestigation of the same rightly belonged
to the' School Board.
That tho board decided to make an in- i
vestigation of the case is evident from I
the fact that Secretary Parnell recently j
received a letter officially notifying him |
to be present to-morrow at the head- i
quarters of the School Department with
his witnesses, when he and they would
be heard. Colonel Parnell is very much
annoyed that he should be placed in such
a position by the officials of the School
Department. He so wrote to them yes
terday, saying that they have no right |
to place him in the position of prosecu- I
tor, and there was nothing in his first
letter that could be so construed. The
matter was one wholly within the prov- |
inee of the School Board to do as j
it sees fit. As Colonel Parnell has given '
the Superintendent the names of all the j
witnesses he knows of, it Is not at all
likely that he will appear at the meet- I
ing, nor will he make any effort to round
up the witnesses in the case.
Suit Over a Piano.
R. C. Fiege commenced suit yesterday
against Nora M. Pratt and her husband,
O. C. Pratt, to recover $50u. the value of
a piano, he claims they are unlawfully
withholding from him.

v pains and my appetite was so poor that I could not eat anything without Â«
CÂ£ being distressed. All those symptoms have disappeared, and I am a well
Â« man thanks to your Belt. I will always be pleased to recommend the Belt Q

APPROVED BY
ITS PARTISANS
Sacramento Republicans
Indorse the Central
Committee.
Action Increasing Membership
Is Received With
Favor.
Designed to Afford â  Representative
for Each Polling Place In
the City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 11.â The action
of the County Central Committee
whereby the membership was increased
from eleven to seventeen has met the
general approbation of prominent Re
publicans in this city. The design of
the committee was to meet as far as
possible the provisions of the Stratton
primary law recently declared by the
Supreme Court to be defective. Whila
the purposes of the law are defeated by
the decision there is no doubt that
m_ny of its features were indorsed by
the people generally, and to meet that
sentiment the committee took the ac
tion it did.
Under the Stratton primary law
there were a greater number of polling
places provided for than has been cus
tomary to have heretofore.
In order to respond to this evident
desire on the part of voters the com
mittee -was compelled to increase its
number so that the additional polling
places which will be provided for later
would not be without a representative
of the party. The action of the com
mittee is highly commendable as it
brings the choice of delegates and other
party privileges more to the people.
The following Interviews show the fav
orable feeling:
Judge C. N. Postâ l can certainly sea
no objection whatever to the action ot
the committee.
F. B. Adamsâ lt should have been
done long ago. It was the proper thinj
to do and meets with general approval
of all good Republicans.
A. J. Johnstonâ l heartily approve the
committee's action. Under the present
Increase of membership the represen
tation throughout the county will be
much more satisfactory than It is now.
Dr. F. F. Tebbetts Taustee â I favor
the action of .'.ie committee and have
all along. The larger the committee
the better.
Ed Roederâ l am In hearty accord
with the proposition which increased
the number of County Commltteemen.
It was a very wise move, an* I believe
gives general sat.sfaction.
William M. Simsâ The action of the
committee is certainly sustained by the
best Republicans in the city and
county. I have heard no one express
any other opinion.
judge E. C. Hartâ l can see no harm
in it I am sure that it was not in
tended tn get the best of anybody*, but
to have the city and county fully rep
resented on tho committee so that Re
publicans generally will be made to
take a livelier interest in the affairs of
the party.
T. A. Landerâ l most certainly ap
prove the committee's action.
J W. Wilson â I have heard no one
complain, and as far as I am concerned
I believe it was the proper thine: to do.
R T. Devlinâ To Insure success the
larger number you interest the better.
I believe the committee realized that
fact when they Increased their number.

TWEEDLEDUM AND TWEEDLEDEE.
THE Westminster Gazette is an ever-flowing
fountain whence gushes and bubbles a quality of
wisdom not to be sneezed at. In a recent issue
it affirms that the destruction of the Maine will not
be treated as casus belli, but as warranting outside
interference. This country views the two processes
as sustaining about the same relation to each other
that six does to half a dozen. If there is any differ
ence between casus belli and a state of facts warrant
ing interference, the interference being certain to
provoke war, the distinction is too delicate to be
readily grasped.
Either the destruction of the Maine was deliber
ately planned, or it was the result of treachery such
as Spain ought to have been the first and keenest in
deploring, or it was an accident. That the latter is the
correct supposition nobody believes, and Spain has
not been detected in the act of expressing regrets.
It became the plain duty of this country to interfere.
It could not do so without accusing Spain. If the
crime was not casus belli, then the accusation cer
tainly was, so the same point is reached by either
path.
When the war shall be over, provided war come, it
is to be hoped the Gazette will find time to explain
tli* difference between its tweedledum and its tweedle
dce. and how the war presumed to happen without
waiting for the essential casus.
(\ WEST INDIAN STATION.
rlj ROM the promptness with which the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations dealt with the
bill providing for the purchase of the island of
St. Thomas it is probable that sentiment in Congress
is favorable to the acquisition, and the purchase may
be made as speedily as it is possible for diplomacy
to arrange for it. Events now occurring show the im
portance to us of a naval station and depot of sup
plies in the West Indies, and the islands which Den
mark desires to sell us are in every respect suited for
that purpose.
It is clear that it would be unadvisable for the
United States to undertake the government of any ex
tensive West Indian possession or of any considerable
West Indian population. For that reason the annex
ation of Cuba or of Porto Rico in the event of suc
cessful war with Spain would hardly be undertaken.
Equal objections could be urged to the annexation of
any of the larger islands. No such objections exist
in the case of the group of islets which Den
mark desires to sell. The only value they have is the
harbor in the island of St. Thomas. The area is
small and the population can never be large. The
group is an ideal one for a naval station, and the very
fact that it is not likely to contain any large number
of people, which renders it comparatively valueless to
Denmark as a colony, makes it the more attractive to
us.
We would have no need for any of the group except
St. Thomas, but as Denmark would not sell that with
out the others we will have to take them all if we take
any. The price asked is $5,000,000. This seems a
large sum for what is but little more than a group
of rocks and sand, but the value of the islands is not
in their industrial but their naval possibilities. It
is not too much for us to pay for a naval station in a
portion of the sea so near to us as that which sur
rounds the West Indies. The subject has long been
under consideration. Some of our ablest statesmen
have advocated it, and in this juncture we can see that
a great mistake was made in not completing the pur
chase years ago.
Prince yon Isenberg-Bernstein of Berlin is willing
to accept a rich wife, Americans not barred. Here
is an opportunity not likely to be overlooked. The
Prince could be had at a bargain, for his great object
in throwing himself upon the market is to raise 900
marks wherewith to repay a loan negotiated with his
tmsting cook. The manifestation of a desire to re
pay this shows the Prince to be far superior to the
aveiage article for sale to the maiden all forlorn
\vho?e papa has money and is in other respects mostly
an idiot.
Carolus Duran. the portrait painter, has named the
three women whom he regards as the most beautiful
in England, France and America, respectively. Yet
there may be others who have not had the honor of
paying the gentleman a large sum for having their
beauty transferred to canvas.
Announcement is made that on account of the
prisoners there Morro Castle is not to be bombarded.
This will be far more satisfactory than to refrain for
fear of giving offense to Spain.
Whatever may be the ability of Sagasta, certainly
he is not acting the part of a diplomat in seizing every
opportunity to insult this country. People do not

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
THE message will be carefully read by every citi
zen. It is the most important state paper since
Lincoln's inaugural and his first call for troops.
It is the document which may break the peace of God
and the nations, and was written in the full sense of
the responsibility it creates for this Government in
taking so momentous a step.
Its historical review of the Cuban situation is a les
son to the world, enforcing the joint responsibility
of governments for the world's peace, and suggesting,
as its best guarantee, that good government which is
the sole source of peace and content on the part of
subjects and citizens. The interest of this country,
through its commerce and the personal rights of its
citizens, invited to domicile and investment in Cuba
by the laws of Spain, is graphically put. The narra
tive of diplomacy, the desire to leave Spain
free to adjust within a reasonable time her dif
ferences with insurgent subjects, and her responsibility
for failure, is plainly stated. The message demon
strates that the incidents common to civil war have
assumed aggravated forms in Cuba. On both sides the
struggle has descended from the plane of war to that
of common murder. Non-combatants have none of
the rights and protection demanded by the laws of
war. There is none of that discrimination which
modern civilization has written into the war code of
the world to mitigate the horrors of carnage. Our
right to intervene by force, the only effective way, is
put on grounds that justify us in the eyes of the world.
No demand is made to effect the dismemberment of
Spain. The Junta and their sympathizers will criticize
this position, and it may be the subject of d-astic
comment on the President. It must not be forgotten,
however, that this great issue must be treated en
tirely as an American question. A right reading of
the message amply discloses that to be the strong
purpose of the President. A demand for independ
ence of Cuba and the installation of the Junta as the
ruling power of the island in place of Spanish
authority is a demand for the dismemberment of a
European power. Spain has for months sought a
European alliance and has been denied. The powers
have seen in the issue no European question as a
foundation for such alliance. Our administration has
not moved a hair's breath off American giound, and
is now put by the message as an intervenor in asser
tion of its clear American rights, and to the world is
presented in a position highly satisfactory to other
nations as a humane protector of the rights of person
and property common to all civilization and necessary
to its existence. The exercise of further powers by
the President passes from the devices of peace to the
ways of war. The purse and the sword are committed
to Congress by the constitution. That body must now
act. It may limit its action to the use by the Presi
dent of our whole military and naval strength in
Cuba to put an end to hostilities, or it may go as
much further as it choose and make a specific declara
tion of war against Spain, which will point to reprisals
upon that nation of such nature as Congress may dic
tate. Armed intervention to secure peace in Cuba will
of course be taken by Spain as a hostile declaration,
and she will treat it as a declaration of war, and the
struggle is inevitable.
The President has wisely refused to make the cause
of Spain of common interest to continental Europe,
as would be the case if we demand dismemberment.
He has left her in that retributive isolation which is
the punishment of misgovernment. and has so planned
her position and our own that she must cease military
operations in Cuba and herself grant independence to
the island on such terms as she can make.
The country has not failed to note the intrusion of
partisanship in the form of Senator Butler's resolution
attempting to forestall the orderly action of the Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs. Butler's plan enables Spain
to draw the card she has sought in a European alli
ance against the United States. As an agent of the
Junta that Senator is willing to involve this country
in a struggle of surpassing magnitude to help the des
perate and sel6sh purpose of a few men who want to
secure supreme power in Cuba to the exclusion of
their island countrymen who have been bearing the
brunt of war while they have been doing office work
in New York.
The President's policy will disembarrass Cuba from
Spanish rule and enfranchise her people with power
to choose their own Government. If the Junta de
serve to be that Government they should inaugurate
the rule of the majority by assenting to it.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
AMONG the measures which were expected of
Congress at this session was one providing
for the establishment of postal savings banks.
The Postmaster-General recommended the adoption
of such a plan, and so favorably was the recommen
dation received throughout the country that for a
time there seemed every reason for the hope that the
proposed banks would be provided.
Secretary Gage, however, has pointed out one ob
jection to the undertaking which under present con
ditions seems insuperable. This lies in the uncertainty
that prevails in the monetary system of the nation.
As he says, in the establishment of banks by which
the Government would be brought into fiduciary re
lations with millions of its people, the consideration
of first importance is the money standard which is to
measure in the future the value of the savings fund
to the depositors.
Referring to the many bills which have been sub
mitted to him, the Secretary responded in a recent
message to the Senate Committee: "I discover no
where in any of these bills any agreement or pledge
as to the form of money in which depositors are to
be paid." He then proceeded to put the issue in this
direct way:
"If one of the humblest parties to the proposed
contract should ask the postmaster agent to whom he
should hand his accumulated earnings, now as good
as gold, 'Will my money, when I draw it out, be in
gold or in its fair equivalent?' what answer will you
authorize your agent to make? At present he can
make no specific answer."
Even the most earnest advocate of postal savings
banks must admit that this objection is fatal to the
establishment of such banks until the money question
has been settled. Here, then, is another reason why
that all-important issue should be dealt with at once.
So long as the value of the money of the nation is
subject to the least doubt or to the changes of politi
cal contests so long will many projects of national
good have to wait. Monetary reform is imperative.
Even the stress of war should not bepermitted to
force its postponement a single day beyond the time
necessary to give it full consideration before action.
Speculation is now rife as to how war would affect
the reconcentrados. Certainly it could not more than
starve them to death, and in the absence of war they
are already starving faster than it is convenient to
bury them.
Perhaps it would not be asking too much of the .
Spanish, that ; in pelting Minister Woodford with
eggs, as they are like, by way of promoting the en
tente cordiale, to do^ they^e *#ood quality, of egg*.
THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 1898.
AN interior paper indulges in the following re
flections: "The country has been tricked,
robbed, plundered of over $50,000,000 by the
money sharks of Wall street. At the time Congress
voted the money it was led to believe it would be
used by our Government to put this country in a posi
tion to wreak vengeance on Spain for the loss of our
magnificent battle-ship and the lives of her brave
crew. The money is being spent and is pouring
rapidly into the coffers of these same Wall-street
brokers, and it looks as though the whole thing was
only a job of theirs to wring more mammon from the
people."
That is a very inflammatory attack upon our own
Government. It may gratify that class of partisans
who think that votes may be gained by trying to
make our people believe that the President is another
Weyler, and that the American people have chosen
tc represent them officers who are devoid of honor
and honesty. While the object of such incendiary
politics is apparent, the pursuit of it by such means is
full of danger. The writer fails to explain how the
money is being spent for the benefit of Wall street,
how it comes to be pouring into the coffers of the
brokers, or how its expenditure is for purposes other
than the defensive and offensive preparations neces
sary to put the country on a war footing. What have
the Wall-street brokers to sell to the Government for
such purposes? What has the Government bought of
them for any purpose that they are getting the money
rapidly into their coffers?
The charge is that the President is guilty of an im
pcachable offense and that Congress is unfit for its
duties. If we have a Congress unanimously incapable,
for every member voted for that appropriation, and
an administration both unfit and dishonorable, the
republic itself stands impeached as unfit for self
government. The fact is, as all fair men know, that
what has been spent of the $50,000,000 confided to the
President has gone in the purchase of ships of war
abroad; in hastening the construction of those on the
ways in our own yards; in swelling the force of every
navy-yard to emergency limits in putting existing
ships, rams and torpedo-boats in condition to fight,
and in the completion, transportation and mounting
of guns to defend our sea ports. It has been spent in
small arms and equipments, tents and supplies for
our land forces; in getting transport-ships ready to
send those forces to the scene of action. It has been
invested in powder, of which three months ago there
was not enough in the country to last one day in
war, and in putting that powder into condition for
its various uses, from the charge needed for the
great guns on ship and shore to fixed ammunition for
the use of small arms in the hands of our marines and
of our infantry and cavalry.
These arc the purposes for which every dollar has
gone, and as a result the military strength of the
country is now ready for the most efficient exertion.
To lie about that expenditure and charge malfeas
ance therein against the President is to indulge a
treasonable temper and pander to disloyalty in a time
when the country needs the cheerful support of all
who deserve the honor of its citizenship. The man
who will spread such black-hearted falsehoods and
idiotic treason is a jack-Spaniard, discrediting his
own country and doing his low best to put it at a dis
advantage. If he were on a man-of-war he would be
tray her to the enemy to discredit the President. If
he stood guard at a fortification he would surrender
it. He has in him the treason of Arnold and the
cowardice of Hull. If he and his kind propose per
sistence in such courses in the expectation that it will
lead their party into power, we notify all such, now,
that the American people will wipe out such an or
ganization and leave as its only monument the stench
that rises where it rots.
PONOMA OR NICARAGUA.
AFTER having spent about a month in making
an inspection of the work now going on along
the route of the proposed Panama canal, the
International Commission is announced to have sat
isfied itself as to the outlook and has sailed for New
York on its way to Europe. It is not known what
report the commission will make, but our dispatches
announce there is good reason to believe the mem
bers were favorably impressed with what they saw,
and will in all probability recommend a continuance
of the work.
The contrast between the persistence of the French
in continuing the work at Panama and the long delay
and vacillation of Congress in providing for the con
struction of the projected canal at Nicaragua is by
no means creditable to the United States. It becomes
all the darker for us when we consider the circum
stances under which the Panama scheme is being
pushed forward. The project is handicapped by the
enormous losses sustained under the first promoters
and by the shameful scandals connected with the ex
penditure of its funds. These were bad enough to
discredit even the most promising enterprise, and yet
in the face of them the French go on with the great
undertaking, while in Washington all the talk and all
the energy directed toward the Nicaragua canal ac
complish nothing more than the appointment of a
new commission every three or four year, to go down
and make a junketing survey of the route.
The people of the United States would not like to
believe that the European capitalists who are back
ing the Panama canal have enough influence in Con
gress to block the Nicaragua project. It is
not to be suspected that an American legis
lator would permit any money power to in
duce him to delay the construction of a canal
under American control for the purpose of
allowing the construction of one under European
control. The canal that connects the Atlantic with
the Pacific will be of vital importance to the United
States in times of war as well as of great value in
times of peace. To permit it to pass into the hands
of foreign powers would be almost like treason to the
welfare of the nation. That, however, is what will
happen if we wait while France works.
To one of a doubting nature the terms of the pro
posed armistice seem to be a request for the United
States to keep its hands off until the Spanish can get
into good shape for changing the request into a de
mand. However, in dealing with a nation so frank
and open and honorable as Spain, so crowned with
the glory of unblemished integrity, so benign and so
chivalrous, such suspicions are of course out of
place.
The Havana paper which accuses Lee of having
run away may possibly have later a chance to apolo
gist to him. Lee might run back in a manner even
more impressive than his leaving.
There is a sentiment in this country that the ships
bearing Americans away from Havana ought to be
convoyed by a fleet of armored cruisers.
Probably thÂ« tragedy of the Chilkoot has robbed
mpttqr * golden dream of all its glamor.

OUR NAVAL VICTORIES
AT THE beginning of the war of the
revolution, says Cameron in the
Chicago Times-Herald there was
no American navy. However, the
continental privateers managed to capture
about 800 English vessels and 12,000 prison
ers, 500 of them soldiers in some of the
best English regiments. In the two years'
naval war with France the fighting was
all done by the navy," which captured SO
of the enemy's vessels and ' about 3000
men. The wars with the Barbary pirates
were also brought to a satisfactory end
by the unaided efforts of the navy, the
United States securing privileges not
granted to European. powers. It was in
the war of 1812. however, that our navy
won its greatest victory by whipping the
British after it had defeated the com
bined sea forces of the world. Over 1500
British ships were taken and over 20,000
British seamen were j made prisoners.
Finally in the Mexican war, though there
was not much chance for naval co-opera
tion with the land forces, . when, the
chance did come at Vera Cruz the navy
took it.
It is not necessary to detail all the vic
tories of the American navy to prove its'
efficiency. The more important are suffi
cient, and such names as Paul â¢ Jones,
Oliver Hazard Perry, Lawrence and the
others who won the victories ought to
be enough to inspire their successors . to
their best and bravest deeds.
The first naval engagement cf th 3 revo
lution was off Machi:is. Me., when the
British armed schooner Margaretta was
whipped and captured. After "that-iel
lowed a long list of minor engagements,
in which Esek Hopkins, first commander
in-chief of the navy, took a number of
English ships. The edge of these victor
ies was dulled a little, however,, by the
defeat of the American fleet on Lake
Champlain under Benedict Arnold.
And then came the first prominent ap
pearance of Captain John Paul Jones, who
i.' the eld Providence picked up fifter.i
British prizes late in '76. In April, '78, he
rruile that daring attack on Whiteaay>n,
ar.d in September, '79, defeated the .Eng
lish ship Serapis in the German Ocean
with the Bonhomme Richard (named af
ter "Poor Richard," or Benjamin Frank
lin), which sank the next day.
The two important battles in the naval
war with France were fought by the good
old frigate Constellation, under Commo
dore Truxton. The first of these was off
St. Kitts. an island in the West Indian
group, where, after an hour's fighting,
Truxton compelled the French frigate
L'lnsurgente to strike., her colors.- In
February, 1799, that was. A year later
the same vessel and the same commander
administered a drubbing to the French La
Vengeance, but allowed her to escape in.
a squall. Â-â â¢...
In the war with the Barbary States the
capture of the American ship Philadelphia
and its subsequent destruction by Deca-.
tur and the bombardment of Tripoli, by
Commodore Preble were the important
engagements. The first. was a serious
loss, but the bombardment was sufficient
to secure American . shipping ; against the
raids of the Barbary pirates.
The war of 1812 was ", productive of a
number :of glorious American victories.
The first of these, after numerous pre
liminary skirmishes, came on August 19,
when the frigate Constitution (now the
Newport school ship) , under Isaac Hull ,
captured the British frigate Guerriere. In
the next month Lieutenant Elliott cap
tured the brigs Detroit â > and i Caledonia,
from under the guns of Fort Erie, the
latter afterward serving in Perry's fleet.
It was only a few days later that the
frigate United States | captured .the Brit
ish Macedonia off Madeira, the British
loss being 104 and the American eleven-
A couple of months later the Constitu
tion captured the -.riti&h ship Java off
Brazil, and in February of 1813 the Amer
ican sloop Hornet stung and captured the
British Peacock.
But after that came a defeat, the de
feat of Lawrence in the Chesapeake by
the British frigate Shannon. It was the
â¢â¢Dont-give-up-the-ship" Lawrence, and
in this engagement he was mortally
wounded. For inflicting the defeat the
freedom of London was voted to Captain
Broke, the English commander, and a
fine â  sword was presented to him. The
defeat was not long ."â¢ unavenged, how
ever, for a couple of months after Cap
tain William Henry Allen in the sloop
Argus ! captured the British sloop Pelican
in the English Channel, and a month
later the American Enterprise took the
Boxer. . __
Then came Perry's victory, the "We
have-met-the-enemy - and - they-are-ourÃ'
victory over the English fleet In Lake
Erie. Six vessels were the prize in this
engagement, a sad loss to England, an
encouraging lift to the United States.
And then the sloop Peacock, which the
Americans had taken , from the British,
was used to : capture - - another ' British
ship, the brig Epervler, off the coast of
Wales. The prise was sold for $55,000, and
1118,000 in specie was found on board. This
was the first good victory of 1814. It was
Boon followed by another, when the
American ship Wasp captured the Rein
deer. , Later â  she took - the : British ! At
lanta, but soon after disappeared, no one
knows how, but forever. â¢ - . .
And next the second battle of Lake
Champlain, an American " victory ~ this
time, when Commodore â  .â¢. homas McDon
ough. with fourteen vessels and eighty
six guns, defeated the British fleet of six
teen vessels and - ninety-six guns under
George Downle. â¢ Fifty- two killed and as
many wounded was the American loss,
the British twice as much. â¢
The first naval struggle of 1815 brought
an American defeat, the > President, un
der Decatur, being captured by a British
fleet' Just out of â â  New York harbor. A.
month c later the Constitution captured
the l British frigate Cyane : and the brigr
Levant, and three days after the Hornet,
under Captain | Nicholas Biddle, captured
the British Penguin oft the : coast of Bra
zil. This ' was the ' last â¢â  naval - battle â of
iâc - war â of â¢ 1813, and â  practically : the â¢ last
American battle with s any s foreign foe.
; â  That Is not by any means ? a full record
L* ife* ,4ffeiic%a fc*yal *â¢ ylftorigu but
enough of them have been given to show
the quality of American fighting on the
sea. if the navy now can do as well
there will be little danger of defeat in
any threatened trouble.
ALONGSHORE.
There s a cry convs up from along the shore,
A cry from a hundred towns or more
Each with its corporation where
It catches the salt Atlantic air.
There isn't a village from North to South
That hasn't a cry for help in its mouth
For each one seems to think that it
Is the only one that can be hit.
That Spain will send on their quickest runs
Her biggest ships with their biggest guns,
To shoot that village so full of holes
The Eea will run through it In great big rolls.
There's a wall from Plgmont-by-the-Sea,
There s a soulful sob from Windwardlee,
There s a protest coining from La Podunk,
There s an urgent call from Sklnnymebunk,
There's a yearning yelp from Cow's-Nesthurst,
I here s a long appeal from Morningburst,
in ere k a sounding shout from Skilletvllle,
ihere s a frightened yell from Bunghole Hill.
They're coming in from the coast of Maine
To the Key West line and back again.
From every municipality
In sight or in smell of the sounding sea.
Each seems to think that the Spanish spite
Is centered upon that one townsite.
And that the Government ought to arise
In Its might to preserve this one choice prize.
But they need not worry: If the Spanish ships
f^ome over this way in a quest for tips.
The lankees will keep them so busy that
They never will learn where these towns are at.

host to a number of characters whosa
paths in life were widely different, but
whose natural instincts and passions, to
which they all gave free rein, were about
the same. One afternoon I was honored
by a call from a well-known missionary,
who had hardly seated himself when tha
door was opened to give admittance to a
gambler by the name of Poker Jack Nes
bitt. We all sat and chatted for a few
moments, when I recollected I had an
errand to perform, and, placing a larga
bottle of rum and some cigars on tha
table, excused myself, telling them to
make themselves at home until I re
turned. I was gone for about an hour,
and when I drew near my house on my
return I was surprised to meet my house*
keeper running toward me with her hai#
flowing down her back and an expres
sion of great consternation on her face.
I stopped her and asked what was tha
matter. As soon as she could catch her
breath she said in the native language:
'Matter? Matter enough. Hurry to tha
house. Poker Jack and the missionary
have drunk up all the rum, and now tha
man of God is eating the degenerate one.'
I at once entered my shanty and found
that she had hit pretty near the truth.
Both of the fellows had become beastly
intoxicated and gotten into a fight, which
had resulted in the missionary nearly
chewing the thumb off the gambler's
hand.

ALAMEDA'S CROPS
ARE DOUBTFUL
San Leandro's Cannery
Is Not to Be Built
This Year.
Livermore's Creamery Closed
Because of Scarcity
of Feed.
Fruit Spoiled In Few Places Â«nd
tho Yield Will Bo
Small.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, April 11,
The crop and fruit conditions and pros- '
pects in A'.ameda County are now caus- '
ing grave anxiety. The excessive
warmth of to-day, it is expected, will bÂ« !
followed by a light rain to-morrow or .
next day and in many districts this will
entirely ruin apricots and cherries. Some <
of the Farmers report that it will novr
be impossible to get even moderate crop.*, ;
as the young cereals are so stunted and
backward that they cannot possibly pro- j
duce anything but poor fodder. ,
The fruit crop, being so lacking In prom- !
iso, lias been the means of delaying the 'â 
building of the cannery of San LeandroJ
for which a generous public subscription j
was raised. It will not be opened this j
' season, but the committee has accepted
an agreement that insures the opening j
of the cannery next year. The propo- j
sition that has been agreed upon is that
of the King-Morse Cannery Company of
San Francisco.
The principal conditions of the contract I
are as follows: That the association j
deeds a block of land and pays over to j
the company the balance In cash which i
will aggregate the sum of five thousand j
dollars and which Is to be collected by j
July l, 1S98; while the company agrees to
break ground by November 1 of this year
and begin with the erection â :" buildings
by January 1; 1599. The cannery to have j
capacity of 50,000 cases per canning sea- j
son. The last condition was proposed j
by th*> association; but a private inter
view with Mr. Morse, the president of
the company, elicited the fact that the
calculations are for a capacity of 100,
000 cases per canning season.
A report received at The Call office from
Haywarda to-day says the hot spell has !
materially diminished the chances of good j
apricot and almond crops, but that there j
will be lair yields of other fruits unless [
something more destructive in the me- j
teorological line â  sits the county.
The lack of feed for stock in the val- |
ley and thill lands is having a de- j
cldedly bad effect upon the Livermoro i
cream
The local Institution was closed down
on Wednesday morning, ami the new
management will seek other fields.
The mont skimming' station which
has been operated in connection with the
creamery has not been put in use this
season. Thirty-five thousand pounds of
milk was the daily average of the skim
mine station for April of last year. Farm
era of that section are moving their stock ;
over in the Corral Hollow country, where
the 'feed, though not in abundance, far
surpasses the ranges In the Altamont
hills.
Three weeks ago thÂ« creamery had â 
elphteen patrons who furnished a. daily â 
average of 2.VW pounds of milk. Since then !
the number of patrons i>aa increased to \
twenty-two and the average daily amount
of milk has decreased to about 1700
pounds.
It can be readily seen that the cream
ery culd not long survive this condition
of affairs and unless a change for an in
crease of feed for the stock takes place
within the next two or three weeks, Liv
ermore Valley's creamery will remain ;
closed for the season of '98. '
OBJECTS TO THE
LITTLE PETITION
The Council Protests Against
Changing the Pierhead
Lines.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â  Broadway, April 11
The City Council laid over indefinitely
to-night the ordinance calling for the
tion of freeholders to frame a new
charter.
The attempt to change the pWhend
lines, ed In The Call,
- â  up by Mr. t'pton, who intro
â¢ ::.g resolution:
Whereas, A petition has been filed and Is
now [,enMng bt-fore the Corps of Engineers.
U. S. A.. In Sail Francisco. C*l., seeking to
have moved landmark and pierhead lines In
the Oakland harbor, as established about Jive
years ac â  by the Federal Government, the ef
fect of which chance would be to put new
pierhead lines and ail wharves and landings
â¢olely upon lands claimed by the Oakland
Water Front Company, leaving no free water
frontage or landing place under the control of
the public, as Is now the case under the de
cision of the Supreme Court of California, as
It now stands.
Resolved, That the City Council of the city
.of Oakland views the proposed change with
great alarm as against the public Interest,
against the growth of Oakland and the rights
of the city and the whole public: and this
Council does most strongly protest against any
change of pierhead lines, the effect of which
would be to limit wharves, docks, piers or
landing 1 places to territory claimed in private
Dwnenihlp, thus taking the dominion and con
trol of the city front out of the hands of the
public and putting it Into the hands of Indi
viduals or of a. private corporation organized'
for profit, and this Council protests against any
change of harbor lines, the effect of which
â would be to diminish the area of water front
now under public control.
. Resolved, That the City attorney be and he
Is hereby directed to appear (at the hearing
of fald petition) In rapport of this resolution,
and the special attorneys of the city In the
watÂ»r front litigation are requested to. appear
In the wm( way and oppose any change of
plerlln"?.
To the surprise of everybody the reso
lution created a warm debate. Brosna
han argued that the employment of the
city's special attorney would mean a
special fee. Mr. Hill denied this, and said
that the special counsel would be glad
of the opportunity to appear without any
fee. It was seen that the resolution was
not favorable to many, and after a warm
talk an attempt was made to suspend the
rules and pass the resolution forthwith.
This was defeated by a vote of 6 to 4,
Howe being absent. It tak.-s eight votes
to suspend the rules, so the resolution
went to the committee which meets next
Monday night. As the meeting in San
Francisco is set for next Monday morn-
Ing, Oakland will have no official repre
sentative in a matter that vitally con
cerns her progress.

BUNDING NO
MORE ASSIGNEE
Judge Greene Ridicules
the Jupiter Mine
Scheme.
Its Stock Not Worth Wind to
Blow It Across the
Street.
Mrs. Ingalls' Attorneys May Now
Take Steps to Nullity â¢
Mortgage.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 11.
Charles F. Blanding is no longer as
signee of the estate of the insolvent Mrs.
Sarah T. [Bgalls. TWs morning he was
removed by Judge Greene and the court
gave more than a hint that Mr. Blanding
had looked out for himself at the ex
pense of his clients more than the law
generally tolerated.
For nearly a week the peculiar business
methods of Mr. Blanding have puzzled
JudgeGreene and Interested the attorneys
who tried to unravel them. One of the
pieces of evidence that seemed to impress
the .! . -Ing not quite proper was
that relating to the Jiono obtained from
Mrs. [ngalls in return for the mortgage
on her Berkeley property.
Mrs. [ngalls' attorneys asked Mr. Blan
ding why he did not incorporate the Jup-
Mining Company, and he replied that
he never had money enough to draw up
and file the articles of incorporation.
Blanding stated that he tried to sell the
note of Mrs. Ingalls for $1250, arW with
that money he Intended to file his papers
In Ti nnessee. He was then asked if it
were not a fact that he" had told some
body that he would use the money to float
an insurance society, and he did not sat
isfy them as to whether he had said so
or not.
In removing him as assignee Judge
Greene made a few remarks. He com
mented nither severely on the manner in
which Blanding had handled the affairs
of Mrs. Ingalls, and in conclusion suid:
"These certificates of the Jupiter Dark
Blue Shining Bright Consolidated Co:il
and Blue Gravel Mining Company (or
whatever its name is) were not recog
nized by her creditors; they were value
less: they were not worth the wind it
would take to blow them across the
street. The $3000, therefore, passed into
your hands without return. I am com
pelled to order your removal as assignee
and must remark that if you are innocent
you are innocent beyond your age."
It is probable that the attorneys for
Mrs. Ingails. having secured the removal
of Blar.dir.g- as assignee, will now at
tempt to have the mortgage set aside.

Plans for Remodeling and Enlarging the Orpheum
in Accordance With Latest
Designs
The great popularity of the Orpheum with the theater-going public of
San Francisco has led the management to lay out plans for the remod
eling and enlarging of the present building, which will make it at once
one of the most commodious and best-equipped buildings In the country.
Gustav Walter returned Friday evening from a long tour of investigation
and Inspection and the result was that he at once set an architect at work
drawing plans for remodeling the structure.
The property adjoining the theater on the east, which was known as
"Three Fingered Jack's Place." comprising forty feet, will be added, giving
the building a frontage of 167 Vi feet on O'Farrell street. The annex will also
be completely remodeled. The bar will be run the full length of 125 feet
against the west wall, and a handsome arched doorway will lead into the
theater proper.
Probably the beet feature of the whole arrangement will be the new
Ftage. Instead of being directly opposite the O'Farrell street entrance it
will be placed in the southeast corner, after the fashion of Ronacher's
famous establishment in Vienna. This will leave every seat in the build
ing, even to the farthest corner, in a direct line with the stage, and the
view will be equally good from all parts of the house. This will also give
greater facilities for handling scenery, which is now the chief drawback of
the house. The present entrance will be used only as an exit, or in case
of fire, and a large and handsome entrance will be const ructed at the west
end of the building on O'Farrell street. This will be directly opposite the
stage. The new stage will be triangular in shape, and can readily be
made smaller or larger, according to the scenery used, without Interfering
with the view in the smallest degree.
The building will also be raised and two new galleries put in, which will
give the house a seating capacity of 6000. The house will be completely
refurnished with the most comfortable chairs obtainable, and will be fin
ished off in a style of simple and harmonious beauty.
The Orpheum circuit now includes San Francisco, Sacramento, Kansas
City. Los Angeles and St. Louis, and a new house will be opened in Omaha
early in the fall. Negotiations are also being made for housea in Chicago
and New York. With this enlorge-d circuit the management will be able
to put on a better class of productions than have ever been seen on this
coast.
The work of remodeling will be begun at once, and the theater will be
reopened at about the same time as the new house in Omaha. It Is not
expected that it will be necessary to close the house over two weeks.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 1898.
LADY DULLER
IS NOT INSANE
Her Attorney Says That
Oakland Police Are
Hasty.
Her Ladyship Is Arrested in
West Oakland and Booked
as Deranged.
Ways of the British Aristocracy Are
Not Undarstood by Blunt
Caliiorniana.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
$M Broadway, April 11.
Lady Leilah Kirkham Yarde-Buller at
tended Judge Hall' 3 court this morning
t'> prosecute the litigation over the Kirk
ham estate, and this afternoon she was
arrested in West Oakland on a suspicion
of insanity.
For over a year some of her relatives
; living in this city have been of the belief
; that her ladyship was not of sound mind,
; but no occasion has arisen that would
; give them a valid reason for having her
: examined regarding her mental condition.
This afternoon Lady Yarde-Buller went
[ to Jackson's drug store in West Oakland
' and asked the clerk to order her carriage
to be sent for her. She talked very inco
i herently and behaved in such an excit-
I able manner that the proprietor of the
store concluded she was insane. He tried
to enter into conversation with her, but
she would give him no satisfaction be
, yond saying that she was a member of
the British aristocracy, had wealth In
plenty and would be much obliged if he
! would call up her carriage so that she
; might go home. Becoming convinced that
the lady was not responsible, the Keceiv
lng Hospital w;:s requested to take her
in charge, and Warden Kc-.iting now has
her in the insane department.
After her arrival at the hospital, \\ ar
' den Keating sent fur Dr. Wheeler, her
brother-in-law, told him of the circum
stances and asked him what he wished to
! have done. Dr. Whec-ler replied that he
had long been of the opinion that her
1 ladyship was not able to take care of her
self, and that it would probably be best
for her to be examined, and if found irra
tional to be taken care of.
The divorce proceedings of Mrs. Yarde-
Buller and the part she took in the liti
gation over the estate of her father, tho
late General Kirkham, have brought the
family into much prominence during the
past "three years. Various stories of the
doings of her ladyship nave been circu
lated, but only in the form of rumors,
! although on some occasions they seem
to have had some foundation. About a
year ago Lady Buller came from England
but did not announce her coming. It was
thought that a previous arrangement she
â¢ had made with the other heirs of the
Kirkham estate had been entirely satis
factory and that her ladyship would
spend her fortune and pass the remainder
of her days in the west end of London.
This, however, was not so, and Lady
Ruller with her two sons, one of them a
â¢ lieutenant in the British army, arrived at
the Hotel Metropole and announced that
they were not satisfied with her lady
ship's portion.
Another agreement was made, and for
a time her ladyship lived with an old
nurse in a little cottage on the edge of
; the marsh in West Oakland. It is not
known when her ladyship moved her
: residence from this city, but it is now
stated that she has been living for some
! time in a San Francisco hotel.
Upon being placed in the ward Mrs.
Yarde-Buller at once fell In a deep
sleep and her relatives and attorneys
were notified of her detention. To-mor
row morning she will be examined by
doctors who will decide whether her in
sanity be due to legitimate weakening of
the brain or to other causes.
Some time ago Lieutenant Blair, the
elder of Mrs. Buller's two sons, returned
to his regiment in England, and the
younger one remained with his mother.
E. H. Wakeman, Lady Yarde-Buller's
attorney, at whose home she has been
residing fnr the past six months, and her
son Arthur were at the hospital to-night.
Mr Wakeman was terribly put out be
cause his client was charged with insan
ity. "Why, she is no more insane than
you are," he said. "We were out late
iast night, and she drank pretty heavily.
To-day she got out and was boisterous.
The police dia not know her, and when
she asked them to call for her carriage
they thought, of course, she was in
sane. Why didn't they charge her with
drunkenness and lock her up until
her son or myself could be noti
fied. Then we could have taken
her home in a carriage. Now she must
be examined before she can leave this
place She will surprise the examiners
in the morning, for she will be all right
then. It is a wonder Oakland police don't
know a drunk when they see one."

DEMOCRATS DECRY
ONE-MAN POWER
Major Harney's General Com
mittee Outlines the Plans
of the Party
After Some Reflections on Another
Faction Primary Preliminaries
Were Arranged.
There was a large and enthusiastic
meeting of the general committee of the
local Democratic pa~ty in Pioneer Hall
last evening at which business of im
portance was transacted.
Major E. J. Harney, as chairman of the
meeting, in calling the 225 Who attended
to order, outlined the work before them.
In part he said:
You have assembled this evening as the legal
representatives of the Democratic party of
thia city for the consideration of matters af
fecting its welfare, and to make arrangements
fur the selecting of a new general committee,
in accordance with the provisions of the plan
iof the organization. The plan to which we
1 propose to conform was adopted in IS<*6, and in
tht.- same year it was approved by the Demo
cratic State Central Committee and also rati
fied by the Democratic State Convention, the
! highest authority within the Democracy of
, California. This general committee was elected
, by the Democratic voters of San Francisco
In accordance with this plan, and therefore
j tt stands to-day as the only body that can
legally claim to represent the Democratic vot
ers in this city and county.
! It is true there is another committee com
posed .if 110 members calling itself the Demo
cratic County Committee who claims to repre
' sent the Democratic party of San Francisco.
' This committee, as you are all aware, was
appointed by one man, who it would seem pre
sumes to hold In the hollow of his mighty
hand the destinies of the Democracy of San
Francisco, and at the same time this commit
i tee claimed by this man is posing before this
: city and State as antagonistic to the power of
polltloal boasiatn which is now, as it ever has
been, nothing more >>r less than one man power.
The law of nature makes it impossible for
the stream to rise higher than its source. A
â  a] committee appointed absolutely by one
man cannot seriously be regarded as a menace
to a political boss. The fundamental prin
â¢ ciple underlying our Democratic faith is based
â  on the firm reliance in the sovereignty of the
voters. The voters of this republic constitute
the sovereign power of the nnti'n. and on the
; same principle the Democratic voters of San
1 Francisco have the right to outline their par
ty's policy and to name their representatives
in the executive council of its organization.
Major Harney then called attention to
i the fact that nothing would be approved
! but a fair, open primary, at which every
i Democratic voter will be given an oppor-
I tunity to vote, and be assured that hia
vote as cast would be counted.
J. A. Fenton then offerer! a set of reso
lutions, calling for the election of a new
general committee, which were adopted
almost immediately after their reading
by Secretary McGovern.
In substance the resolutions called for
j a primary election to be held on Monday,
April as, and calling for the election of
400 members, twenty-five from each As
sembly district; also that the enrollment
of Democratic voters should be held on
April 14, 15 and IS, between the hours of
7 and 10 a, m. It also called for the or
ganization of the various district clubs
I on April 20, and the election b,y roll-call
of a permanent chairman and secretary.
The resolution then told how the election
should be conducted.
At the conclusion of the reading a com
munication outlining the history of the
two factions was road and was listened
to with interest. The legality of the two
parties was touched on in an able man
ner, wnieh led every one to believe that
the paper was prepared by a lawyer. It
was laid on the table.
A recess was then taken to allow the
representatives of each district an oppor
tunity to determine where the places for
enrollment in their several districts
should be held. Their selections were
ratified and will appear in Wednesday's
Call.
The chairman of the general committee
has power to appoint a committee of
three in each district to supervise the en
rollment, but his selections are not to be
members of the present general com
mittee.
The campaign committee of twenty will
hold a meeting this evening at its head
quarters, in room 34. Baldwin Hotel.

TRIP TO THE
TENDERLOIN
Hoyt's "Stranger" Is the
Thirstiest Play Ever
Written.
ThÂ« Strange Adventures of
Mr. Pascoe at the
Alcazar.
Another Morosoo Melodrama â Con
tinuances at the Other Play
houses.
This time our genial friend, Charles
Hoyt, has forsaken the small suburban
settlement with its modest delights and
dissipations and has hied him to New
York, and written a farce about the
great metropolitan tenderloin. And â
sad to tell â he has written not in satire,
but in glorification. Hoyt, our
one hope, our comic antidote
for a nation's sins, has evolved
a piece with the largest capacity for
cocktails, wine and "wow!" that is yet
on record. I have seen "Ten Nights in
a Barroom," "Drink," New York Casino
"reviews" and many plays that could
hold their own in the consumption of
strong fluids â but this piece, "A Stran
ger in New York," is the limit. It is a
dramatic tank. It drinks from the rise
of the first curtain until the drop of
the last; it swims, splashes, soaks in
it, until your brain grows dizzy and
your chair reels. I prefer Mr. Hoyt in
a more temperate mood, when he
shouts less and says more. The fun
of this piece depends wholly on its rat
tle and glitter and thirst; there is lit
tle observation in it and none of the
good natured satire that is usually the
best part of a Hoyt playâ in fact, the
author seems frankly enamored of the
tenderloin, and for three acts he paints
it an inflammatory red.
Such plot as comes to the surface is
this: The "stranger," after picking up
a letter of introduction, delivering it to
the person addressed, and being wel
comed with all sorts of brotherly love
and libation is led off to the French
ball, the host under the impression that
he is entertaining the man in whose be
half the letter was written. The man
who has lost the letter becomes the
victim of a practical joke of his own
which sends him to a pesthouse. He
escapes and comes to the ball, where he
is compelled to assume a spurious
name, while the "stranger" enjoys the
wine, the glory and the girls. There is
a bit of side plot in the victim's wife,
who employs a detective to discover
her husband at the ball â but it is only
incidental and very trivial.
The action and interest are centered
in the phenomenal thirsts and capaci
ties of the stranger and his compan
ions. The ball scene, or rather a room
in the Madison Square Garden on the
night of a ball, takes up the last two
of the three acts, exploiting specialties
between drinks. Joseph Coyne, a young
man of great lengths and limbernesses,
extravagantly mobile countenance and
considerable magnetism, plays tha
"stranger," with finished tenderloin as
surance, and sings several songa with
entertaining humor. Charles Dungan
does all that any one could do for the
"host."
This is not the original New York
cast, but it includes Anna Boyd, Ca
mille Cleveland, Minnie Bridges, Harry
Rogers, Sam Marion and John Dudley,
who certainly do not make the play out
to be any less than it really is. In
fact both Mr. Hoyt and the company
do the tenderloin to its very rarest.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Alcazar.
When Eddie Poy essayed to portray the
"Strange Adventures of Miss Brown" in
the play of that name no one accused him
of being a good female impersonator, nor
will any one accuse William H. Pascoe,
who plays the part in the present Alcazar
production, of appearing anything but
male. Mr. Pascoe's masculinity is more
positive than his humor, but the good
work of Mrs. Bates. Wallace Shaw and
Gertrude Foster does a lot to make the
performance a go.
Morosco's.
The patrons of Morosco's were enter
tained last night by an elaborate melo
drama, "The Pavements of Paris," In
which the regular company did its usual
reliable work and La Petite Lund Intro
duced several little special .es, besides
appearing advantageously in the part of
Marie. The scenes are more than aver
agely good, especially the onÂ© of Paris
by moonlight.
Tivoli.
"Sinbad the Sailor" has been whipped
into smoother shape, and is good for a
long run at the Tivoli.
Columbia.
"Shore Acres" has all of this week at
the Columbia, after which Mr. Herne's
popular picture play gives way to Marie
Jansen in "Delmonico's at Six."
California.
Edward Harrlgan in "Old Lavender"
was greeted by another large audience
last night, and promises to make out a
profitable week at the California,
Orpheum.
Hyde's Comedians furnish the best all
round vaudeville show that has been seen
at the Orpheum In half a year.
Music Notes.
Little Paloma Schramm, the remark
able child pianist, gave a little impromptu
performance in the Sherman & Clay Hall
yesterday morning for a small invited
audience of musicians and critics. She
played several standard pieces of more or
less difficulty with amazing fluency and
understanding, and extemporized on sev
eral themes that were written out for
her. The child is not yet 9 years old,
and promises to make a sensation at the
recitals to be given in the Sherman &
Clay Hall to-mormw and Friday after
noons and Thursday evening.
The sale of seats for the Melha-Dam
rosch-Ellls season of opera commences
Thursday morning at the California. The
prices range from $7 to $2.
The first of two benefit concerts to be
tendered the young violinist. Marino, comes
off to-morrow night at the Sherman &

The opera "lolanthe" wili be given on
\\ ednesday and Thursday evenings of
this week at Armory Hall, by a company
of amateurs who have been well drilled
and will probably give a good perform
ance.
There were only twenty-five visitors at
the Free Library yesterday during the
three hours that the place was open. The
belief is gaining ground that it would be
a good idea to have the library closed
altogether on Sunday.
The feature of the meeting of tho Uni
tarian Club Wednesday evening will be a
talk by ex-Congressman Stunner on "A
Trip to England and a Few Glances at
English Facts and Folks."
It is in contemplation by the parish of
Christ Church to erect a building
adjoining the present church which
will be adapted to meetings of various
kinds, it is proposed to have an assem
bly hall, rector's study, guild and class
rooms, kitchen, etc. Plan? have been
prepared and will be discussed at the
annual meeting this evening.
EDWARDS DAVIS
MAKES ANSWER
His Scathing Arraignment of
Those Who Belittle
Him.
OAKLAND, April 11.â following
self-explanatory letter was received to
day from Rev. Edwards Davis regarding
the Central Christian Church affair:
PACIFIC GROVE. Cal.. April 11, 1898.
Noticing in the Sunday issue of the papers
a statement of the deficiency of the funds of
the Central Christian Church, with which my
name Is associated, I beg to express at this
first opportunity my denial of any compromis
ing action. I am not surprised that the mani
fest littleness of my successor has accordingly
lessened the receipts of the congregation. If
there is a deficiency now, I am confident there
was no discrepancy in my accounts with the
treasurer. Upon my resignation I submitted
to the officers of the church a financial state
ment which was accepted, and voluntarily a
motion was made and addressed by the clerk
to me, commending me in its fairness.
As for Mr. H. E. Mnglll, referred to, I can
but in justice to him express my confidence in
his exactness as an accountant. In the be
ginning of my successor's pastorate in our
denominational journals and private letters, I
have besought the blessing of God upon his
labors. The effort of Mr. Sawyer to detect a
deficiency on my V part la only accountable in
his humiliation at realizing his incompetency
in meeting the expectations and requirement
of such a congregation. His prejudiced refer
ences to his predecessor has resulted In the
disgust and departure of many of the mem
bers, resignations from the officers and an
alienation of the former attending non-mem
bership.
As for Deacon Dodson, such a degree has
been conferred since my regime, I am not sur
prised at any such statement from him that I
had retained money belonging to the church.
He has not entertained a warm feeling for fel
lowship for me since having borrowed the small
sum of $5. which for the past six months he has
been unable to repay, nor am I surprised at any
statement from Mr. Metcalf, especially since
I have recently insisted on the payment of
money borrowed to the extent of ?26, due for
some six months past. .1 absolutely deny any
deficiency in my deliverance of funds to the
church or discrepancy in my accounts there
with. I have no alteration to make to my ac
cepted report. If the two officers ment'oned
will meet the deficiency in their accounts they
can more conscientiously attempt to dis
cover deficiency in mine. If the church de
sires any further communication It would be
better for Its welfare to express itself through
its officiary rather than through the press. Its
statements should be specific and not am
biguously general. Regretting the manifest lit
tleness that has brought low a work which I
have devoted years of sacrifice and Interest. I
am, EDWARDS DAVIS.

KELLER ON WAR ISSUES.
If Trouble Must Come Business In
terests Demand Prompt
Action.
OAKLAND. April 11.â M. J. Keller re
turned from one of his semi-annual visits
to Chicago and New York to-day. He
faid both cities were considerably excited
over the threatened war. He thinks the
business element is most conservative. Ha
said:
"These interests think that It would be
better to find a peaceable way out of
the present complications If it can be
done with honor. If war must be, they J
Will bfÂ» in favor of meeting it with vig-or. â 
War is better than indefinite suspense.
The war agitation naturally retards en
terprises and investment.
"Business, however, throughout the
East is better than it has been, and in
some sections of the country wholesalers !
report largely increased orders. That is i
particularly true from the great wheat !
belts in Kansas and lowa and the Da
kotas."
Great Benevolences.
In the large cities of the United States the
condition of the metropolitan poor Is constantly
being ameliorated by the grand benevolences of
wealthy people. Sanitary reforms are fre- ;
quently suggested and carried out with earnest
ness and Intelligence. Among sanitary reforms
those produced by Hostetter's Stomach Bitters
in dyspeptic stomach, disordered liver, bowels
or nervous system are very conspicuous.

â tart. Woo easily. Second eaellj. Third driving.
He can easily beoome a big favorite with the
race-going public.
The entries of Pescador and Mercutio will be
refused in future. Both are fearfully bad
actors at the post.
Simi was touted as a good thing, but got up
against too fast company.
Two or three books a trifle out of line laid
as good as 8 to 1 against Wheel of Fortune.
Valencienne had speed to burn In her race,
but was badly pocketed, getting out when It
â was too late.

Arrest of "Paddy"
McDonald, a Desper
ate Character.
Caught Breaking Into a
Car, He Wounds a
Citizen.
Louis Debare, His Victim, Posi
tively Identifies Him in
the City Prison.
GUILTY OF MANY CRIMES.
His Aeoomplloo Now Awaiting Tria
ior Robbing a Cigar
Store.
"Poddy" McDonald, an ex-convict, was
arrested last night by Detectives Ryan
and ODea and Railroad Detective Lewln
and booked on two charges of burglary
and one of an assault to commit murder.
On the morning of March 22 Louis De
bare, who is employed by the Western
Meat Market Company, drove to Fourth
and Townsend streets, intending to in-
Bpect the cars containing the meat con
signed to his employers. Aa he reached
the cars he discovered McDonald and an
other man acting in a suspicious man
ner.
Thinking: that they intended to break
Into the cars Debare proceeded to ques
tion them. For a reply McDonald drew
his revolver and fired at Debare. The bul-
"Paddy" McDonald.
let struck the latter In the right foot,
making a serious wound. Although par
tially crippled by the shot the brave man
pursued McDonald, but failed to overtake
him. As he abandoned the chase the
murderous ex-convict tired another shot
at his victim, but failed to hit him.
The following day the police were noti
fied of the occurrence, and Detectives
Ryan and ODea were detailed to arrest
the shooter.
An Investigation revealed that the men
had broken into a car, but were prevented
from taking anything by the appearance
of Detoare on the scene. Evidently think
ing he was a railroad detective McDonald
used his revolver in the hope of escaping
arrest.
By dint of Inquiry the detectives learned
that the men had entered a store at Kate
and Bryant streets and stole a large
quantity of tobacco and other articles.
McDonald's accomplice, who is known as
"Jim" Hart, was shortly afterward ar
rested and charged with burglary. His
case la now pending in Judge Conlan's
court.
Last night McDonald was apprehended
find locked up In the City Prison. He was
positively Identified by Debare as the man
who shot him.
McDonald is well known to the police.
Last December he was arrested for burg
lary, but had the charge reduced to petty

DUPED BY A FORGER.
Mrs. Addie Chamberlain Purchases
Property and Is Given Worth
less Deeds.
Superior Judge Bahrs has a knotty
problem to solve In the Hiilt of Mrs. Mar
paret Byrnes, a widow, to have the deeds
by which Mrs. Addie Chamberlain lays
claim to pieces of property at the corner |
of Burrows and Williams streets and on j
Bast avenue near Laurel avenue, set |
aside. Mrs. Byrnes alleges that the. deeds ;
held by the defendant are forgeries. Mrs. '
I'hamberlain was an Innrccent purchaser \
of the land, and would sustain severe loss
If her claim to the property was decided |
to be not legal.
According to the story of Mrs. Byrnes, i
Louis E. Schroerier. a barber, who was |
married to her niece, forged the deeds .
held by Mrs. Chamberlain, and had some
woman represent herself before a notary I
public when the papers were being ac- I
knowledged, as the real owner of the i
property.
Schroeder was convicted of horse steal- I
ln^ some time afterward, and prior to the I
discovery' of the forged deeds. He sub
sequently made his escape from San
Quentin prison ajid is still at large.
Judge Rahrs has taken the case under
advisement.
WARM ENOUGH
FOR ANYBODY
About the Least Chilly April
Day That Ever Dallied With
San Francisco.
People Asked the Usual Fool Ques
tion and the Butter Showed Visible
Signs of Yielding.
Several people were heard to ask yes
terday, "Is it hot enough for you?" If
anybody took the trouble to reply he
answered in the affirmative. The
weather was hot enough for the most
exacting salamander, so perspiring na
tives opined, and yet to the man from
the sizzling East it was hardly more
than a suggestion of spring. A day
which is anathematized as "hot" and
is simply moderate proves that this
city has the finest of climates, but that
those who get the benefit do not al
ways appreciate their blessings.
Yesterday the maximum temperature,
according to the weather bureau, was
83 9-10 degrees and with the exception
of April 24, 1597, was the warmest re
corded here for this season of the year
in more than a decade. On that date
it was 84. While people noticed that
the temperature had gone up, and the
more thoughtful of them left their over
coats at home, there was no inconven
ience felt. Butter on the restaurant
table lost a measure of its solidity,
there was a good demand for beer, and
long cool drinks were in particular fa
vor. Nobody rode inside a street car
if there was a seat on the dummy.
Of course the weather bureau has an
explanation of the sudden change, be
ing sustained by the Government part
ly for this purpose. It says it was
brought about by high pressure prevail
ing over the northern half of Califor
nia. This has jammed a lot of warm
air out of place and sent it scurrying
down the coast looking for a chance to
alight, and part of the sultry breeze
shed itself right here. This breeze
may have acquired a nortion of its
warmth through the friction generated
by the gait it struck, although the
weather bureau gives no hint of this.
At Sacramento the wind was moving
at the rate of thirty-two miles an hour,
but toward evening it dropped to eight
een. It was not an invigorating wind,
but promoted the tired feeling charac
teristic of spring, gentle spring.
Reports from all over the State indi
cate excessively warm weather as gen
erally prevailing with an average tem
perature of 80 degrees. A change in
the temperature may be expected to
night with heavy fogs and a decided
cooling of the atmosphere. The high
pressure at present prevailing will in
all probability work its way southeast
ward, and cooler weather is predicted
by the Government's weather sharps.

orated for the occasion. In tue prettily i
arranged dressing-room brilliant-hued I
carnations made a pleasing decoration, j
Easter lilies bloomed In the reception- j
room, and roses made the dancing-hall i
fragrant and beautiful. Everywhere giant !

HE WILL PLEAD INSANITY.
That Will Be the Defense of the Mur-
derer of Mary Costillia.
The trial of Kamikichi Tauchi, who shot
and killed Marj^Costillia on December 20,
was resumed yesterday before Judge Wal
lace and a jury. The defendant was re
called to the stand for further cross-ex
amination by Assistant District Attorney
Black. He repeated his former story of
having killed the woman while in a fit of
jealous rage and that he was temporarily
insane at the time.
A continuance was thrn granted until
this morning to allow the defense an op
portunity to subpena witnesses, who, it
Is claimed, will testify that Tauchi acted
as if half demented for some time prior
to the murder.
Fractured His Skull.

window In the second story r.f the house,
1909 Vallejo street, yesterday afternoon,
when he missed his hold and fell to the

Hospital in the ambulance where it was
found that his skull was badly fractured
and he was in a critical condition.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 1898.
STORM-STAYED IN EAGLE HARBOR.
The codfishing schooner Arago had several narrow escapes during her
last cruise. For weeks -she could not put to sea and Icicles gathered every
where, the running gear froze, the windlass became a solid mass and sev
eral of the crew were frostbitten. The schooner was detained so long that
she was given up for lost.
HEAVY STORMS
IN BERING SEA
Terrible Experience of the
Schooner Arago's
Crew.
For Weeks They Were In an
Arctic Hurricane That
Brought Death.
Considerable Anxiety Felt Over the
Non-Arrival of the Alexander
at Kadiak.
The codfishing schooner Arago, which
left here last October for Sagd Point,
had a very hard time up north. For
weeks a.t a time it was impossible to
lower a dory, and during a heavy gale
three of the crew were drowned. When
a chance did come to work the vessel
the running gear was found to be frozen
and the windlass was set into a solid mass
so it was impossible to hoist the anchor
until the ice was thawed away with hot
water. From February 6 to February 22
the schooner was one mass of icicles, and
Captain Stensland says that when the
sun's rays struck her she was the most
beautiful sight he ever saw. Long icy
pendants hune from the bowsprit, the
rigging, booms, and formed in a series of
network on the vessel's sides. It took the
crew all their time to keep warm, and
several of the boys were frost-bitten dur
ing the cold spell.
"It is not true that my sailors were
drunk when their dory capsized," said
Captain Stensland yesterday, when talk
ing about the drowning of the three men.
"The weather up there had been very
bad, and Captain Carlson of the schooner
Mary and Ida, after trying in vain for
six weeks to get to the westward, gave
up the unequal fight and put into Eagle
Harbor. When 1 put in there in the
Arago I anchored in the outer harbor,
while Carlson had gone into the inner
harbor, about five miles away. I was
very anxious to get news from San Fran
cisco, and as Peter Jensen, O. Stevens and
J. Jones were more than anxious to go
to the Mary and Ida, I at last gave my
consent for them to make the visit. They
started at 8 a. m., and as the wind was
blowing hard in the direction. of the Mary
and Ida they made the trip in two hours.
Owing "to the driving sleet I could I not
see when they left on the return trip,
but I kept lights burning until after mid
night, and had men on - the lookout S all
night. . ,
"Next morning Captain Carlson of the
Mary and Ida paid me a visit, and I then
learned that my men had started for their
ship at 2:30 p. m. the day ' before. a I sent
the mate and two men out in one dory
and I took two men and went in another,
and soon after we had begun our search
we found the overturned dory, but could
get no trace of the men. "We. kept the
search up for five days, but never saw
a sign of the three fishermen again.
"Now - there was a party on the Mary
and Ida,- but there was nobody drunk, as
there was nothing to get drunk on. Who
ever brought that story down simply told
what was not true, as there was not an
ounce of spirituous liquors on either
schooner.
"After getting away from Eagle. Harbor
we made Sand Point, and ; there we lay
until March 22, thinking every " day we
would be driven ; ashore, , in â  spite ' of our
two anchors. It blew a gale the whole
time from the southeast, and we could
not see the ship's length for the driving
snow and sleet. . When the weather did
moderate a little we finally. got away for
San > Francisco; The fates were --.: still
against us, however, as during : the run
here we encountered nothing but north
erly winds and snow squalls. Up in Al
aska waters the : weather * was the worst
I have ever encountered, and it was
simply an impossibility for Captain Carl
son to make t, connections with - the
schooner Winchester.'.' ~ ;, â ; ;. /
All the vessels have been having a hard
time of it in the northern waters. From
Unalaska to Unga' Island is only about
240 miles, and â  yet it took the steamer
Bertha six.. days to cover that . distance.
There were .days at a time when she
could barely hold her â  own, ; and again
when the storm was at its height she
was driven : back. Consequently, :z: z ship
owners who have â¢; vessels in . Alaskan
waters are anxious about them. The
schooner Kadiak, - which â :â¢ arrived from
Kadiak Island yesterday, reports the non
arrival | of the scnooner Alexander, which
left here February 6 last. . The run up Is
Jreauentl/, ) madj under ' a fortnight, and
thirty days is considered a very lone
fstfn^h l\ hen the Kadlak left th!
aid n^ the Ale *ander was out fifty days!
Avert I 6 WJ J B no sisn of hen Captain
A\ery was in command, and as the
*Â° nn Â° n n Â« was well found and fully pro
visioned, the North American Trading
â  Company, her owners, think she will be
heard from by the next mail. The same
company owned the schooner General
biglin, which was lost with all hands last
The gold hunters going to Kotzebue
Sound on the barkentine Catherine Sud
den will be well cared for when the ves
sel reaches the vicinity of the Kubuck
Kiver. Two launches, each 40 feet long,
12 feet broad and drawing 18 inches of
water when loaded, are now being com
pleted at Belvedere, and will be carried
north on the barkentine's upper deck.
They will carry thirty tons of freight
and accommodate fifty passengers each
The engines are being built by the Main
street machine-shop, and 1 they will drive
the launches at the rate of fourteen
knots an hour. , Captain Green of, the
Sudden is ready to wager good American
money that he will land his passengers
first at the gold fields.
The schooner Florence will sail for the
Yukon next Saturday. The vessel is half
a dozen things in one and her owners say
she can't be beat in any of her good
points. She is provided with a false
keel, three feet deep. This can be re
moved at any. time and a stern wheel
put in, when, presto, the schooner is
transformed into a stern-wheel steamer
drawing less than a foot of water. All
the engines and boilers are now in place
and besides these the schooner is fitted
with a sawmill plant whose capacity is
1000 feet of lumber a day, a dredging
plant with a capacity of 400 cubic yards
a day, an electric light plant with power
for 150 lights, besides a machine shop and
a small steam launch. Two years' pro
visions are being taken along and the
men engaged in the affair expect it to
be a success from the start. The con
cern is known as the Mutual Mining and
Investment Company, and Ivan L. Peter
son is the general manager, C. E. Pet
erson is captain, H. E. Walker, late of
the steamer Gaelic, chief engineer;
T. E. Tomlinson, assistant engi
neer, and T. Church and "W. H.
Quinn Jr. There will also 'be a #
first mate, cook, carpenter and two sail
ors. The Florence is 92 feet long, 22 feet
broad, 6 feet deep with her keel on and
will sail up to St. Michael. Her keel will
then be removed and she : will proceed
up the Yukon, dredging the sand bars for
gold as she goes along.
George W. Walthew, late secretary of
the Ship Owners' Association, died Sun
day morning. The deceased was for
several years connected with the Daily
Report, but left that paper to accept the

SWEARING MADE EASY.
Policeman S. Orr Severely Bebuked
by Judge Conlan.
The ease with which some policemen
swear to the facts alleged in their com
plaints against vagrants was exemplified
in a case in Judge Conlan's court yester
day morning.
Policeman S. Orr arrested George Gib
bons Sunday morning on a charge of
vagrancy. Yesterday morning Orr swore
to a complaint in which he alleged that
Gibbons had been loitering around saloons
from April 5 to Apn. 10. When the case
was called he swore to the same facts
as in the complaint.
Gibbons astonished the court when he
testified that he had only been released
from the House of Correction on Friday
last aftr-r serving a term for petty lar
oony. He was sent from the Judge's
court. The Judge examined his records
and found that Gibbons was right. He
dismissed the case and administered a
severe rebuke to Orr. The officer's con
duct will be called to the attention of
Captain Spillane.
SEARCHING FOB LEAVITT.
The Police Unable to Find D. W.
Hewitt's Assailant.
The police are searching for Oliver P.

stabbed D. W. Hewitt, a teamster, at the
lodging house, 322 Seventh street, Sunday
night. Hewitt's wounds are not consid

Detective Sullivan, who Is working: on
the case, believes that the trouble was
over the landlady of the lodging house,
Mrs. Moore. Both men were in love with
her. and Hewitt was regarded with more
favor by her than his rival, who had to
leave the house.

LABOR GAINS
A VICTORY
Judge de Haven Decides
Against the J. Kelso
Company.
It Must Stand Trial for Violat
ing the Federal Eight-
Hour Law.
A Corporation Must Respect the
Statutes and Can Be Punished
Like an Individual.
Labor gained a decided victory yester
day, when United States District Judge
de Haven handed down his decision to
the effect that the John Kelso Company
must stand trial for violating the Federal
eight-hour law by working; laborers for
nine hours and longer on the site of the
proposed Postoffice building.
Several months ago John Kelso, con
tractor, was arrested by the United States
Marshal on complaint of several labor
organizations in this city for having vio
lated the * ederal statute. Kelso set up
as a defense that the statute was aimed
at contractors for public works, and that
he was only an employe of a subcon
tractor, the John Kelso Company, the San
Francisco Bridge Company having as
signed to the John Kelso Company the
contract for excavating the foundations
of the site.
Upon this showing the charge against
Kelso was dismissed by United States
>â¢' i â¢ uiTiu<Â»titner Heacock, and a war
rant was issued for the arrest of the
.M. ii. i ixeiso Company. The warrant was
served upon Kelso as president of the
company, at the suggestion of Assistant
United States Attorney Knight, following
the procedure laid down by the Civil Code
of the State, there being no way of ac
complishing the same end under the Fed
eral Statutes. Then the Kelso Company
set up the contention that a corporation,
not having a soul to be saved or a body
to be kicked, could not be haled into court
on a criminal charge and could not be
punished either by line or imprisonment.
It also insisted that a corporation could
not be deemed to have malicious intent,
a necessary ingredient to every criminal
ragout.
Commissioner Heacock decided that the
corporation could be punished and was
responsible criminally, and so he recom
mended in his report to the District
Court.
Thereupon the defendant made a motion
before Judge de Haven to quash the
summons" and to dismiss the case. The
matter was argued and submitted months
ago, and yesterday Judge de Haven de
ckled that a corporation! no more than
an individual, could claim exemption from
punishment for violating the law.
The following are extracts from the de
cision:
"It will be observed that by the express
language of this statute there must be an
intentional violation of .its provisions in
order to constitute the offense which the
statute defines. In view of this express
declaration, it is claimed on behalf of the
defendant that the act is not applicable
to corporations, because it is not possible
for a corporation to commit the crime de
scribed In the statute. The argument ad
vanced to sustain this position is in sub
stance this: That a corporation is only
an artificial creation, without animate
body or mind, and, therefore, from its
very nature. Incapable of entertaining the
specific intention which by the statute i-s
made an essential of the crime defined.
The case of the State vs. the Great Works
Mill Company, 20 Maine, 71, supports this
proposition, and it must be conceded that
there are to be found dicta in many other
cases to the effect that a corporation is
not amenable to prosecution for a positive
act of malfeasance, involving a specific
intention to do an unlawful act.
"In a general sense it may be said that
no crime can be committed without a
joint operation of act and intention. In
many crimes, however, the only intention
required is an intention to do the pro
hibited act. * * * In such a case the in
tention of the directors that the prohibited
act should be done is imputed to the cor
poration itself.
"That a corporation may be liable civilly
for that class of torts in which a spe
cific malicious intention is an essential
element is not disputed at this day. Thus
an action for malicious prosecution will
lie against a banking corporation. â¢ â¦ *
An action will lie also against a corpora
tion for a malicious libel. â¢ * * When
a statute in general terms prohibits the
doing of an act which can be performed
by a corporation there is no reason why
such statute should be construed as not
applying to corporations when the pun
ishment provided for its infraction is one
that can be inflicted upon *a corporation,
as, for instance, a fine."
On the subject of the service of the
summons Judge de Haven says:
"The course adopted was to follow the
practice prescribed by the Penal Code of
this State, and there was served upon
the president of the corporation a sum
mons giving full information of the of
fense charged against the defendant cor
poration and naming a day for the de
fendant to appear in court and answer
such charge." â¦ â¢ *
The motion of the defendant will be de
nied.

the park the old station which stood at
the southeast corner of Stanyan and H
streets Is being cut up into small sections
and distributed along the line from Stan
yan street to the beach, where they will
answer for side stations for the new
trolley cars which will be run 0%-er this
line as soon as the changed condition
of the roadway shall be completed, which
will be In about a month from now.
By this means passengers can alight
at any of the stations aloug the south
side of the park and enter the grounds
without being compelled to go clear to
the ocean, as was the rule heretofore.
The electric power to propel the ocean
bound cars from Stanyan and Freder
ick streets will be obtained from the old
power-house formerly used by the Metro
politan Company on Carl and Willard
streets. This power-house is now being
put In order and heavy riveted poles are
being put in place along the streets lead
ing to H street, over which the trolley
cars will run to the ocean, and over the
tract formerly used by the steam line.
To accommodate the traveling public
stations will be erected at Ninth, Nine
teenth and Thirtieth avenues, at which
the cars will stop on their way to and
from the beach.
The old steam car house on H street
will be refitted and made fit for the hous
ing of the new electric cars of this
branch.
This change will restore to the people
that portion of the southeast corner
of Golden Gate Park upon which has
stood the station of the railroad com
pany ever since the road was built and
upon which so many complaints have
been based regarding the action of the
Park Commissioners in leasing this prop
erty to the corporation.
By these proposed changes the Sunset
Valley becomes of considerable import
ance, and at the same time an active
rival of the favored Richmond on the
north side of the park.
Following this line of improvements in
this section of the city the Carl street
line of electric cars will be switched fur
ther south in the near future so as to run
right in front of the affiliated colleges
and continue as now onward to Ninth
avenue and Golden Gate Park, where it
will connect with the Ocean Beach line
direct to the Cliff House.
The Spring Valley Water Company is
about to put in larger mains from the
Clarpndon Heights reservoir into and
through Sunset A T alley as far as the
streets may be graded. Not to be out
done in generosity the Gas and Electric
Company will string flectric wires along
the streets as far as they are occupied
by residents, while the Park Commis
sioners will throw lights on tlie south side
of the roadway clear to the beach.
NOT A SUCCESS
AS A LAWYER
Disastrous Attempt of a Woman
to Conduct Her Own
Legal Business.
Mrs. Laura Gibbons Committed by
Justice Kerrigan for Contempt
of Court.
Laura Gibbons, a most determined lit
tle woman of 28 years, had a narrow es
cape from passing last night in the Coun
ty Jail. Mrs. Gibbons, who is quite pre
possessing, keeps a candy store at 1134
Valencia street, and when no? engaged in
selling stomach-ache to juveniles, spends
a large portion of her time in the courts,
for she has a penchant for getting tan
gled in the law's meshes.
Mrs. Gibbons always conducts her own
cases, to the discomfort of the Judges,
and so, when J. S. Reid, as assignee of
G. Galleti, brought suit in the Justice
Court to recover $59 25 on a promissory
note gi%'en in payment for goods, and the
case came up for trial before Justice
Kerrigan a couple of months ago, Mrs.
Gibbons scorned the services of a lawyer
and made her own defense. She made
a strong fight, but it was clear that she
owed the money, so the Justice gave his
decision in favor of the plaintiff.
Mrs. Gibbons was not satisfied and
gave notice of appeal. In looking over
her bond Justice Kerrigan was doubtful
as to the security and ordered her to ap
pear and justify her sureties. She paid
no attention to the order and on March
31 she was cited to appear yesterday and
show cause why she should not be pun
ished for contempt. This time the lady
decided to appear, and she explained to
the Justice that she had never received
the previous order. The attorney for
Reid took occasion to question her as a
judgment debtor regarding her property,
but Mrs. Gibbons took exception to his
line of questioning and flatly refused to
answer, despite the warning of the Jus
tice, who told her he would punish her
for contempt unless she answered.
At this Mrs. Gibbons turned upon his
honor and charged him with having treat
ed her unfairly during the trial. She
became very boisterous and refused to
calm down, so Justice Kerrigan gave her
twenty-four hours in the County Jail to
ponder over the situation. This brought
the lady to a realization of the fact that
as a lawyer she was not a success and
she called upon "W. H. Abbotts to keep
her out of jail. A deputy led her away
to the Sheriff's office, where she was de
tained for more than an hour while her
attorney was at work in her behalf. HtÂ»
finally induced the Justice to release her
on her own recognizance until Wednes
day, when she will again appear in court.
A California Boy Honored.
According to the Washington Post, in
its account of the fourth debate of the
debating Society of the Georgetown Uni
versity Law School, Robert P. Troy of
California is distinguishing himself as an
orator and logician. The debate was upon
the question: "Resolved, That a constitu
tional amendment should be enacted
whereby United States Senators should be
elected by a direct vote of the people."
After naming those who took part in the
argument the paper mentioned says:
"Both sides presented their arguments
well and forcefully, and the speech of Mr.
Robert P. Troy, for the negative, was a
masterly effort." The judges, after care
ful deliberation, gave the decision in
favor of the negative. Pending the deci
sion the students made several patriotic
and fiery speeches upon the Spanish-
American question, and a resolution was
passed "That the students of the great
University of Georgetown do offer their
services to the President of the United
States to do his bidding in marching
against the armies of Spain, and in aveng
ing the sailors of the Maine and the
slaughter of the Cubans."
On Her Own Recognizance.
Mrs. Margaret Warren, the wealthy
widow from Santa Monica, appeared be
fore Judge Joachimsen yesterday morn
ing on the charge of disturbing the peace
in the Cosmopolitan Hotel Sunday night.
The Judge, after hearing both sides, con
tinued the case for thirty days, allowing
the defendant to go on her own recogni
zance.

The Now Watchman Brave, but

Thore Is a now caretaker and watch
man on the shore land owned by Dr.
Benjamin 1". Lyford, between Tiburon
and California City. He is a little man.
v):" -â¢â  to p. i-rot "(.â lianas" and
<i> vices every time tho
wind rattles the clapi oarda of tho little
house in whi< :. â¢ - and < ks his
!!â¢â : yet made up his mind

or nm. Three days ue has lived in the
house and ho â¢ he Is 8 ing a
little bit nervous about mr- rattling of
the l . the wind passes and tho
i lie squirrels as they
;ier over the roof.
Two weeks before the little man was
installed as caretaker of the property
and the lonely house turned over for his
use, a man named Vulberg was the
watchman of the property of the Tiburon
physician. Yolberg slept and cooked his
meals in the house whore- his successor
lives, lie was contented with his
lot until one Sunday about a monta ago
when a party of picnickers spread their
lunch near the lonely cabin, and the
watchman, in .an effort to be friendly, of
. to allow them to boil some water
on his stove to pivÂ« the ladies of the par
ty a cup of tea wiui their lunch. The
men among the visitors who entered the
house of the caretaker noticed that some
a doora of the place were securely
1 and boarded up. Volberg in an
swer to questions explained that his em
ployer was an eccentric man and he had
some things stowed away tlu-re that he
did not want any one to see. Yolberg said
he had been cautioned not to enter those
rooms and h.> had faithfully k^-pt away
from them. The explanation aroused, the
curiosity of the men, and some pretext
was made to get the old caretaker away
from the place.
As soon as lie was pone the door of one
of the rooms in the attic was pried open.
The window of the room had been board
ed up and the apartment was dark. A
match was struck and In the dim light the
curious visitors were able to make out
the outlines of three coffins. One was as
if made for a full-grown person, and the
other two were as though made for the
burial of infants. In another corner of
the room was' a box resembling that used
to contain a coffin v hen it is deposited
in the grave. The curious visitors got
out of the room as quickly as they could
after making the discovery and the pic
nickers hurried away from the house and
Jinished their lunch in a more appetizing
spot.
That night Volberg found that the room
had been broken into, but faithful to his
instructions he kept away from it, and
for three days he resisted the temptation
to explore the mysteries of the apartment.
On Wednesday night following he lay on
his bed reading and thinking of the brok
en door and the mysteries that lay be
yond. Finally the temptation became too
strung and he grasped a candle and start
ed for the room. He cautiously ap
proached the place and quietly opening
the door stepped into the room, lie had
hardly got past the threshold and in full
view of the coffins when the house shook.
The floor rose and fell and the coffins be
gan to elide across the room
Volberg was found early the next morn
ng sitting in the edge of a clump of
bushes close to California City dazed, and
with the stump of a candle in his hand.
He was only partly dressed and shivering
with cold. Nearly everybody was talk-
Ing of the earthquake that shook un the
bay cities and towns, but all that could
be got out of Volberg for nearly a day
was an incoherent story about ghosts.
Nothing could induce him to go back to
the house. The clothing ho left behind
he said could stay there. lie took a round
about way back to Tiburon so as to avoid
passing close to the house he believed
was haunted, and went to San Francisco
From that moment the house was with
out a watchman until the present care
taker took the place. The house is about
a mile from any other habitation and In
the most secluded spot along the Tiburon
shore. The present custodian put fresh
nails In the door leading to the forbidden
room to keep out the sight of the coffins
and with every nail he drove in he re
peated the assertion that he was not
afraid of ghosts, though he resorted to
the aforementioned signs and devices sev
eral times during the operation
The new watchman said that the Bible
pays that there are good spirits and bad
spirits and he thought that he was
guarded too well by the good spirits for
the evil ones to trouble him, though at the
same time he was not going to spare
nails In an effort to keep the bad spirits
away.
The coffins that are stowed In the for
bidden room are empty though once they
held human forms. That was nearly thir
ty years ago when Dr. Lyford was a
surgeon In the army during the civil war.
The physician at that time Invented an
embalming fluid and on the battlefield he
had no lack of subjects for experimental

GRAND JURY IS AFTER
FERRY DEPOT BOODLERS
Commissioner Colnon and Architect Swain
Must Now Explain.
President Colnon of the Board of Harbor Commissioners,
together with Architect Swain and the gentlemen who have
assisted in depleting the appropriation made for the construc
tion of a union depot and ferry house at the foot of Market
street, are to be given an opportunity to explain their acts to
the Grand Jury. The initial steps were taken last night,
and before another week has passed It 1b expected that the
members of the investigating body will be able to determine
what proportion Of the $100,000 stolen from the State went into
the pockets of favored contractors, and also what part, if
any, of the sum named was added to the bank accounts of the
officials who, by their acts, made the steal possible.
Since it became generally known that the construction of
the ferry building has been and is little more than an excuse
for permitting certain favored contractors and their official
backers to wax fat at the expense of the State, the members
of the present Grand Jury have given careful heed to the
matter witli the end in view of instituting, at the proper time,
the proceedings that were begun last night.
The charges 1 were presented in the form of a communica
tion from District Attorney Barnes. They are so comprehen
sive in their scope and so grave in their nature that after a
partial reading it was suggested that a matter of such great
Importance should receive the attention of every member of
the Grand Jury. After some discussion it was decided to
notify all members to he present in the jury room Thursday
afternoon for the purpose of considering the charges.
Tlie document now before the Grand Jury sets forth at
length the deplorable condition of affairs that have existed
ami that now exist relative to the construction of the ferry
building.
So great hns been the extent of the official bunco game that
the vast appropriation which, according to the original plans,
cations and estimates, exceeded by about $50,000 the
amount necessary to complete the structure, has been ex
hausted and the building is still far from complete. Not only
this, but where, according to the original plans, costly materi
als and methods of construction were to have been used there
have been substituted cheap materials and poor workmanship.
For these substitutions favored contractors have been paid
thousands of dollars in addition to the amounts named in their
original contracts.
The scope of the investigation to which the attention of the
Grand Jury has been directed is sufficiently broad to include not
only the acts of contractors and State officials in the matter of
the substitutions and changes whereby the State treasury has

WORD, WE
ARE READY"
Says General Shafter
of the Troops at
the Presidio.

From the San Diego

Army Officers at Depart

A BRIGADE OF VETERANS.
Ex - Attorney - General Hsrt In thÂ«
Fieldâ Colonel Mosby Gets Â» Let
ter From General Miles.
The T'nitPd States troops at the Pre
sidio are ready for action. The First
Infantry, cully equippped for field serv
ice, is awaiting orders to march. The sig
nal to go to the front is hourly expected
by the officers and men. The order direct
ing that officers shall not leave the post
without special permission from the com
manding officer has not been modified or
revoked. The report was circulated at
the post exchange yesterday that Min
ister Woodford had been recalled from
Madrid. The soldiers understand that the
shooting will begin shortly after the dip
lomatic relations are broken; hence their
eager inquiry as to the truth of the re
port.
General Shafter was at department
headquarters early yesterday morning.
He held a conference with Colonel Evan
Miles, First Infantry; Lieutenant-Co.lonel
Wallace F. Randolph, Third Artillery,
commanding the artillery forces at tne
Presidio; Maj< Thomas M. K. Smith,
commanding the First Infantry battalion
at Benicia barracks, and Lieutenant-Col
onel Louis T. Morris, commanding the
squadron of the Fourth Cavalry at the
Presidio.
The general was busy throughout the
day. He said, In reply to questions, that
the troops were ready for active service.
He did not believe, however, that the
First Infantry would be ordered to leave
this department until war was declared.
Speaking of the situation at San Diego,
General Shafter said: "The batteries to
be placed in position there will be able
to take care of that harbor. The channel
is so narrow that a ship must pass within
a hundred yards of the grins."
Concerning affairs in the harbor of San
Francisco, tne general remarked: "Every
thing here is in first-class shape. In a
word, we are ready."
Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace F. Ran
dolph. Third Artillery, is now on duty at
the Presidio. He has selected the com
fortable house formerly occupied by Col
onel Williston, and will be ready to "re
ceive" when his traps get here. The ar
tillerymf-n of the Third are now engaged
in mounting the guns of the second
mortar battery. The sixth 12-inch rifle

Ex^Attorney-General W. H. H. Hart is
in the Held as the organizer of a Cali
fornia brigade of veterans for service In
the approaching war with Spain. The
story goes that General Hart took Pres
ident McKinley into his confidence on
this subject and that the latter highly
approved the plan of organization. It is
quite obvious to everybody that the Union
and Confederate veterans of the late war
are going to take quite an active part
n the conflict with Spain. The youngest
of the veterans of the late war are over
53 years of ago. Years, however, have
not diminished their fighting spirit, but
it is a question whether their discretion
has not been dulled. Men who fully ap
preciate the hardships of an active cam
paign fancy that the hardiest young men
will be needed for a campaign in Cuba.
It is a glorious thing for the old veterans
to volunteer, but sensible soldiers doubt
the wisdom of sending to Cuba a column
of enlisted men whose ages respectively
â¢fcorrespond with the years of the young
est veterans of the late war.
The story goes that General Hart and
his friends will supply the money to
equip the brigade as mounted riflemen.
The men who eervcd at tha from on,

been mulcted of sums aggregating more than $100,000, but will
also seek to trace the division of these illegitimate gains, to the
end that the guilty persons may be broug-ht to justice. Dis
trict Attorney Barnes has been consulted as to me proper mode
of procedure and has advised the Grand Jury that the charges
against Commissioner Colnon and Architect Swain, and such
others as are shown to have been involved, are of the first im
portance not only to the people of San Francisco, but to the
whole State. As to the legal aspects of the case he will ad
vise the Grand Jury that if it can be shown that any person
has given or received money in the nature of a bribe, that
person can be proceeded against by indictment. Also, that if it
is shown by the investigation just inaugurated that any State
official has neglected his duty or in any way betrayed the trust
imposed upon him by reason of his employment by the State,
he may be proceeded against by an action charging him with
malfeasance.
In the light of the exposures that have been made in these
columns from day to day, based on the official records of the
Board of Harbor Commissioners, the reports of competent ex
perts and the testimony of reliable and unimpeachable wit
nesses, it is not too much to say that there is every reason to
suppose that before the end of another week the Grand Jury
will have taken the necessary steps to punish some and remove
from office others who have been responsible for the thievery
that has marked every stage in the construction of the ferry
depot building.
The investigation as planned by the Grand Jury will have
special and particular reference to the acts of the Harbor Com
mission and Architect Swain in authorizing changes in the
plans and specifications under which the more important con
tracts were let. It is known that these changes were in most
instances the means by which the largest swindles were per
petrated. It is only necessary to search the records of the
Board for evidence to prove that these changes that resulted
in so much loss to the State and so much illegitimate gain to
contractors and other interested parties were recommended by
Architect Swain and approved by President Colnon and his
associates. What does not appear of record are the motives
that actuated these officials in the performance of the acts
with which they are charged. This is one of the problems that
the Grand Jury has set itself to solve, it being confidently ex
pected that the solution will not be difficult of accomplishment
District Attorney Barnes has assured the members of the
Grand Jury that he will lend them every aid within the scope
of his official authority to run down and bring to justice the
men who have robbed the people of the State in so barefaced
a manner.
either side from 1861 until 1865 may do
excellent work in organizing and lead
ing volunteers, but when it comes to
marching by night and fighting by day
the burden of the conflict will fall on the
youngsters. It is true that veterans of
the Mexican war took an active part In
the war of the rebellion, hut the latter
conflict came within fourteen years after
the campaign in Mexico closed. It is now
thirty-three years since the last shot was
fired in the war of the rebellion. The
fighting then was done by young men
whose ages ranged from 18 to 30 years.
The war with Spain must be fought by
young men of the country.
Colonel John S. Mosby. the Confederate
raider is in receipt of a cordial letter
from Major-General Nelson A. Miles, in
which the latter acknowledges the re
ceipt of the colonel's tender of service in
the coming war with Spain. The colonel,
in offering his services, wrote that thp
fidelity with which he served a cause that
was lost would convey an idea of the
services that he would probably render
a cause that promised so many oppor
tunities of success. Colonel Mosby holds
that there is no reason why war against
bpain should be declared, but If a decla
ration comes, he will cheerfully go to the

A WAR TAX ON
SCHOONER BEER
Brewers Laying In Large Sup
plies cf Internal Revenue
Stamps.
But Their Foresight Will Not Save
Them From Contributing to
the War Fund.
A war with Spain will be likely to cause
a war tax to be levied upon beer and
other luxuries, and in expectation of such
a tax many brewers are buying large
quantities of stamps, belleveing that
these stamps will be accepted as full pay
ment for all internal revenue taxes. But
their calculations have received a setback
by the Issuance of the following circular
from the Commisioner of Internal Rev
enue:
In view of the prospective increase ln the
rate of Internal revenue tax on beer, brewers
may endeavor to purchase quantities of beer
stamps for future use and largely In excess of
their present needs. You are, therefore, in
structed to advise all brewers when purchas
ing beer stamps that the stamps now in use
will not be available for the payment of tax
on beer after the passage of an act Increasing
the rate of taxation thereon. Immediately on
the approval of such an act. the new rate of
taxation will attach to and become payable on
all beer not actually sold or removed from the
brewery premises for consumption or sale.
Such excessive purchases of stamps. If made'
will not only i?reatly Increase the work ln this
office and yours, in the redemption of stamps
but will deprive brewers of the use of the
money invested therein until such stamps can
be redeemed.

Edward Brannan Arrested on a
Charge of Malicious Mischief.
Edward Brannan, a lemon peddler, vis
ited the tailoring: establishment of Isaac
Silva, at 215 Tehama street, yesterday,
and meeting the proprietor, asked him
to buy some of his wares. Silva agreed
to take a dozen lemons, but finding them
in a decayed state he threw them back
into Brannan's basket, and ordered him
to leave.
Angered at what he termed the Inso

hurled his basket against the window
breaking it. He then proceeded to bom
bard Silva with his lemons, one of which
struck him in the eye.
The latter at once summoned a police

LETTERS FROM ALASKA.
A Entch of Epistles Which Were
Carried Four Thousand Miles
on Sleds.
The marvelous story told by Third Mate
Tilton of the steam whaler Belvedere ex
clusively in The Call of yesterday was
the talk of commercial circles. In the af
ternoon a cipher dispatch arrived which
shows that Mate Walker also succeeded
on the other route. A more thrilling nar
rative of hairbreadth escapes and perils
of the rigid Arctic was never told. Those
most familiar with the countryâ old
whalers and sea captains acquainted with
the fierce storms of the blizzard stricken
Arctic, would not have believed such a
journey possible but for the undisputed
fact that it was made.
Letters received from Point Barrow,
which were carried as far as Portland by
Mate Tilton. show that his comrades did
not believe he would ever be able to force
his way to civilization.
One of the Interesting letters brought
to this city was addressed to E. H. Shel
don. Jt was written by Captain Coffin of
the Rosario. He evidently had no faith
that Tilton would arrive beyond the Arc
tic. The following is the full text of the
letter:
POINT BARROW, October 10, 1897
To E. H. Sheldon, 327 Market street. San
Franciscoâ Dear Sir: I am one and a half miles
south of Point Barrow, fifty yards from the
beach, ten feet of water und<Â»r the stern, nine
under the bow. The ice alongside Is thirteen
inches thick; new Ice.
I cut the schooner In through the Ice (the 20th
of last month) about an eighth of a mile to
this position. The Orca, Belvedere and Jessie
Freeman bucked out through the ridge of
ground Ice the day before.
Impossible for me to get out, as at that time
I was frozen in. The day I cut in the Orca was
abandoned; Freeman also. Natives set her on
nre and she burned up. That was fifty mllaj
south of here. The Belvedere was with them,
but managed to get through the young ice to
shoal water. Just north of the Sea Horses
(islands), where she is now.
Nearly all the men have come up to Cape
Smyth. The Newport and Fearless are thirty
five miles east of here, close to Cape Simpson.
ThÂ« Jennie Is seventy miles from here off Pitt
Point. There are Just 300 men and short ra
tions. I am the only one with flour enough to
winter.
The only thing needful for me is coal. I
went to the coal mine, too, but my folks
could find but little coal. I got Into this
scrape by trying to pick up the Navarch'screw;
also carrying two officers to the Bayliss east of
here. I was with the Bear when the captain
and the seven men came on board. I went
much farther east than I wanted to go to try
and get the thirty men who were drifting about
on the ice.
I hardly think you will get this letter. I am
going to send It by Mr. Tllton, who is going to
try to reach civilization. I donlt think he will
ever reach farther than Point JTope.
Telegraph my wife I am all right. The
schooner has nine chances out of ten to come
out all right. I don't know what to write you
in regard to sending up supplies.
The Navarch was ten miles off the Newport
and Fearless. Seven of the nine men came
ashore. They got out a lot of flour, beef and
pork. But the ice broke off and they lost it.
Respectfully yours. CAPTAIN E. COFFIN.
The refuge station is gone. The Steam
Whaling Company, I hear, said they could take
care of all shipwrecked men at Cape Smyth.
They have nothing here. Were It not for
Liebes' place the men would starve this winter.
The following cipher dispatch was re
ceived by E. I* Griffith of this city yes
terday, showing that Fifth Mate Charles
H. Walker of the Orca, who made the
Mackenzie River route, has arrived safely
at Winnipeg. Tt was forwarded by him
from Edmondson:
ON BOARD THE JENNIE, Oct. 30, 1897.
E. L. Griffith, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear
Sir: The Jennie, Newport, Fearless, Belvedere
and RosariÂ© axe in winter -'larters within 100
miles of Point Barrow. Will get out safe next
spring. The Or.ca and Freeman were lost in
the ice September 20. W. J. DRYNEN.
An interesting letter to Griffith came
from E. L. Mcllhenny. a scientist who is
studying the country for his own amuse
ment and benefit. It is as follows:
POINT BARROW, Oct. 11, 1597.
E. L. Griffith, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: Let
ters go with this with the full particulars of,
the wreck of the Orca and Freeman, off Point
Franklin, and the freezing in of the Belvedere
at the same place. The Newport, Jennie and
Fearless being frozen in east of Point Tangent.
I received letters from Captains Leavitt of
the Newport and McKenna of the Fearless
asking for help, as they were hopelessly frozen
in. Two days later I left here, with Tom
Gordon, for their ships, while these letters
were sent me by Charlie Brower from Captain
Sherman of the Orca and Captain Porter of the
Freeman, stating that they were wrecked, and
asking for help. I at once came back here,
and, with Brewer's assistance, got dop teams
and a lot of natives down to them. As soon
as we got them off we fixed up the houses,
and when the men got here, on October 4, we
were ready for them. Sixty-four men came on
the 4th, and we have them quartered In the
old houses now. There are about twenty more
to come from the west and forty from the
east, leaving fifteen men with each of the
ships, to the eastward, with provisions.
I got quite an additional supply of stuff from
the first ships going west, and that, with what
the other stations have, will keep the men
from starving.
I am taking care of all of the men. and when
my provisions give out Mr. Brower will let
me have all he has. I have sent all my na
tives inland hunting, and Mr. Brower has done
the same. Mr. Brower and I will do all in our
power to aid the men, and have no fear now of
having a narrow escape from a hungry winter.
Mr. Brower is outtltting Tilton, third mate
of the Belvedere, to go to Point Hope and
along the coast to Sitka. I am outfitting
Charles H. Walker, fifth mate of the Orca, to
go to Fort McPherson, and I hope one of them
will get letters through. I send duplicate let
ters both ways. E. A. McILHENNT.
Another important letter brought by
Mate Tilton was one to Lieutenant John
D. Miley, U. S. A., of General Shatter's
staff from Captain G. L. Edie, assistant
surgeon U. S. A., who left this city for
St. Michael last September and arrived at
his destination in due time. In the letter,
hearing date St. Michael, January 17, 1898,
Dr. Edie writes:
Pome time since I sent you a letter by a man
who was going by dog sled to Dawson. I think
that he will get through but for fear of accl
dfnt I send you this by Mr. Tilton, mate of the
whaling ship Belvedere. He has come from
Point Barrow and is the man who will get
through. As he has promised me to call at
headquarters in San Francisco he can tell his
own story. He is the only man among the 300
shipwrecked Ballon at Point Barrow who
would volunteer for the trip.
The Bear could not get very far north on ac
count of the ice and landed Lieutenant Jarvis
and party several hundred miles south of here.
He is going to Point Barrow with dog Ble<ls
He brought the first and only news we hav-.
had from the outside world. When the rein
deer come some of us will go through to Daiv
son. .
In another letter which Lieutenant Ml
ley received from Dr. Edie yesterdayâ
presumably the letter which went by dog
sled to Dawsonâ the surgeon writes:
Everything froze up tight the 20th of October.
The place and country about are bleak and
dreary. The ice in the Yukon breaks up sev
eral months sooner than that in the Bering
Sea around St. Michael. The health of the men
is good, although the water Is very bad.
IN MEMORY OF THE DEAD.
Bishop Nichols Holds an Impressive
Service at Cypress Lawn.
At Cypress Lawn Cemetery yesterday
the Episcopal Bishop of California con
ducted a delightful service of remem
brance to tho,se who lay buried within the
consecrated precincts of lona graveyard,
a space in Cypress Lawn set apart for
the Interment of those of the Episcopal
faith.
The trains brought crowds to the ser
vice, which began at 11:15. Rev. W. I.
Kip Jr. of the Good Samaritan Mission
and Revs. Cooke of Trinity and Cowel of
San Mateo were present and assisted.
Holy communion was administered by
the bishop, who preached ably upon the
resurrection. Priests and laity, preceded
by a choir of boys, then visited the- graves
of Bishop Kip and others, where prayers
were offered and inspiring hymns sung.

SPRING^ADVICE.
Some Timely Hints for All Who Are Go-
ing Throufth This Trying Season.
Scientific Magazine.
Be careful of your diet. You do not
need heavy food such as you require
during the winter.
Spring may be beautiful, but it is
treacherous. Do not let It deceive you
into a cold, a fever, malaria or pneu-
monia.
Do not throw off your winter flannels
too early. It is better to suffer a little
inconvenience than to take cold.
If you feel tired, feverish or over-
heated, do nut rush off and take
"Spring medicines." Cool yourself
down and in this way help your sys-
tem and purify your blood.
If you feel hot and thirsty, do not
drink large quantities of water or oth-
er "long" drinks. It is much better to
take a little pure whiskey and water
which will quench the thirst, tone the
system and fortify against disease.
Remember that only pure whiskey
shpuld ever be taken into the system,
and that the leading chemists and
scientists of the present day unite in
declaring that Duffy's Pure Malt is ab-
solutely the purest and best.
Do not permit any druggist or gro-
cer to persuade you to take "something
else." Bear in mind that this is a med-
icinal whiskey and far superior for
this reason, while it costs no more.
If you use proper care and follow the
advice above given, you may hopa to
go through the spring, in good shape.

the construction of such railway, and
continuously thereafter, in each and cv- |
cry month until the completion thereof,

The failure to comply with any of
said conditions shall work an immedi- j

of such expiration in the operation of
a street railroad, then the Board shall
have power to lease such property to
any person, company or corporation af
ter the notice, on the terms, and in the
manner above provided as to the grant
ing of street railroad xranchises, as far
as the same may be applicable. But no

CHAPTER H. j
Improvement of Streets.
SECTION 1. All streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts in the City and Coun
ty, now open or dedicated or which
may hereafter be opened or dedicated
to public use, shall be deemed and held
to be open public streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts, for the purposes of
this Chapter; and ta^ Supervisors are
hereby empowered to fix the width
j and grade thereof, and to order to be
done therein and thereon any and all
street work and etreet improvement
under the proceedings hereinafter de
scribed.
Sec. 2. Application for the doing of
any such work or improvement must
in the first instance, e"xcept where
otherwise provided in this Article, be
made in writing to the Board of Pub
lic Works; and if the expense thereof
is to be assessed upon private property,
the Board shall investigate the same;
and if it determine that such improve
ment is expedient, It shal) so report to
the Supervisors; and the Supervisors
shall not order any such improvement
until the same has been recommended
I by said Board. When the construction
I of any sewer or drain shall involve a
cost of more than five dollars per lineal
foot for any block, it shall not be au
thorized except by an or< nance passed
by the affirmative vote of not less than
fourteen members of the Board of Su
pervisors. If an application is made
for any work or improvement of which
the expense is to be paid by the City
and County, and the Board of Public
Works shall not approv ; of such appli
cation, it shall report to the Supervis
ors Its reasons for such disapproval,
and the Supervisors may then, after
having obtained from the Board of
Public Works an estimate of the ex
pense of said work or improvement,
by ordinance passed by the affirmative
vote of not less than fourteen members
of the Board of Supervisors, order the
doing of said work, or the making of
said improvement.
The Board of Public Works may also,
except as herein prohibited, recommend
any improvement, the expense of which
is to be paid by the City and County,
though no application may have been
made therefor, and must make, with
said recommendation to the Supervis
ors, an estimate of the expense, and in
such case the Supervisors may order
the same done.
No street work or street improve
ments of any kind shall be ordered to
be done by the Supervisors unless a
written recommendation to do the
same has been made to them by the
Boar.d of Public Works, and all Bucfi
recommendations shall be made mat
ters of record in the office of said
Board.
When the Board shall recommend any
work to be done on a street Intersec
tion or crossing, where the streets do
not Intersect each other at right angles,
it shall in each such case determine
what lots in the blocks adjacent to such
intersection or crowing will Le benefit
ed by said work, and shall cause a
map to be made on which shall bÂ«
delineated the lots so to be benefited.
Such map shall be transmitted to the
Supervisors with said recommenda
tion.
Sec. 3. Before recommending to the
Supervisors the ordering of any work
or improvement, the expense of which
or any mrt thereof, is to be assessed
upon private property, the Board of
Public Works shall pass a resolution of
its intention to recommend the same,
specifying the work to be recommend
ed, and shall fix a day when it shall
take final action upon said resolution
Upon the passage thereof the Secre
tary of the Board shall forthwith with
out any further authority, cause a copy
of said resolution to be posted conspic
uously for five days in the office of said
Secretary, and to be published for a
period of ten days (legal holidays ex
cepted) and cause a copy to be deposit
ed in the Post Office at the City and
County, with postage prepaid, address
ed to each person represented on the
Assessment Book of the City and
County for the next preceding fiscal
year as being owner of land liable to be
assessed for said improvement; but if
said lot stand on said book in the name
of unknown owners, such notice need
not be sent.
The Board shall also cause to be con
spicuously posted along the line of said
contemplated improvement, at points
not more than one hundred feet in dis
tance apart, notices, not less than
three in all, of the passage of said reso
lution. Kach of said notires shall be
headed "Notice of Street Work" in let
ters of not less than two inches in
length, and shall in legible characters
state the fact of the passage of said
resolution, its date, and, briefly, the
work or Improvement proposed, and re
fer to the resolution of intention for
further particulars.
Sec. 4. The owners of a majority of
the frontage of the proi rty fronting
on said proposed work or Improvement,
and. in case of a district, hose owningmore than one-half of the superficial
area of the district, may make written
objections to the same within ten days
after the expiration of the time of the
publication of said resolution of inten
tion, which objections shall be delivered
to the Secretary of the Board of Public
Works, who shall endorse thereon the
date of its reception by him. Such ob
jections shall be a bar for six months
f\j any further proceedings in relation
1 to the dning of said work or making
said improvement, unless the owners of
the one-half or more of the frontage or
of the district, as aforesaid, shall
meanwhile petition for the same to be
done, and the same shall, after the ex
piration of said six months, be contin
ued under the. resolution of intention
first passed if said Board shall deem
proper. If, however, the owners of at.
least two-thirds of the property front
ing on said proposed work or improve
ment, and, in the case of a district,
those owning at U-ast two-thirds of the
superficial area of the district, shall
make written objections to the
same within Â«aid six months, no fur
ther proceedings shall be taken under
the aforesaid resolution of intention.
When the work or improvement pro
posed to bÂ« done is the construction of
sewers, manholes, culverts or cess
pools, and the objections thereto are
signed by the owners of a maiority of
the frontage or of the district as afore
said, the Board shall, at Its next meet
ing, fix a time for hearing said objec
tions, not less than one week there
after. The Secretary shall thereupon
notify the persons making such objec
tions, by depositing a notice thereof in
Posi Office at the City and County,
postage prepaid, and addressed to each
objector or his agent when he appears
for such objector. At the time speci
fied the Board shall hear the objections
urtred. and pass upon the same, and its
decision shall be final and conclusive;
and If said objections are overruled the
proceedings shall be continued aa
though no objections had been made.
At any time before the making of
the assessment as hereinafter provid
ed, all owners of lots of land liable to
assessment therein, who, after the first
publication of the aforesaid resolution
âºof intention, may feel aggrieved, or
who may have objections to any pro
ceedings in relation to the performance
of the work described in said resolu
tion, may file with the Secretary a pe
tition of remonstrance, wherein they
shall state in what respect they feel
aggrieved, or the proceedings to which
they object. Such petition or remon
strance shall be passed upon by the
Board, and its decision thereon shall
be final and conclusive.
Sec. 5. When the contemplated work
or Improvement in the opinion of the
Board of Public Works is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the
expense of such work or improvement
be made chargeable upon a district,
and said Board shall in its res
olution of intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
and to be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to
be benefited by said work or improve
ment may be made by any interested
party, in writing, within ten days af
ter the expiration of the time of pub
lication or the resolution of intention.
The Secretary of the Board shall lay
said objections before it and the Board
shall, at its next meeting, fix a time
for hearing said objections not less
than one week thereafter. The Secre
tary shall thereupon notify the persons
making such objections by depositing
a notice thereof in the Post Office at the
City and County, postage prepaid, ad
dressed to each objector. At the time
specified the Board shall hear the ob
jections urged and pass upon the same,
and if said objections are overruled, its
decision shall be final and conclusive
as to the extent and boundaries of the
district.
I If the objections are sustained, th*
Board shall proceed to set out another
district to the extent and boundaries
of which objections may be made and
a hearing had thereon as above pro-
Si and so on in like manner until
a district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob-
JÂ« tions shall be overruled by the Board
â its decision in that behalf to be final
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro
ceedings shall continue the same as if
no objections had been made. In lta
report to the Supervisors the Board
shall accompany its report with a dia- !
gram on which shall be delineated each
separate lot, piece or parcel of land,
the area in square feet of each of such
lots, pieces or parcels of land, and the
relative location of the same to the
work or improvement proposed to bo
done within the limits of the district.
Such diagram shall be certified to be
t by the Secretary of the Board.
. 6. When the work under any
contract shall have been completed, the
contractor shall make and file in the
office of the Board of Public Works
an affidavit to the effect that he haa
not entered Into any private agree
ment, verbal or written, with any per
son liable to be assessed for said work,
or with any one on his behalf, to ac
cept a price from him less than the
price nam,ed in said contract, or to
make any rebate or deduction to him
from such price. Any such agreement
shall be deemed a fraud upon all per-
H"ns liable to be assessed for such
work other than the property owners
who were parties to the agreement, and
shall make void, as to such persons so
defrauded, any assessment made for
the work done under such contract; and
where there is more than one contractor
each contractor shall make such affi
davit.
Sec. 7. When any work In or upon
any public street shall have been com
pleted according to contract, and the
affidavit mentioned in the next preced
ing section shall have been made, the
Board shall make an assessment to
cover the sum due for the work per
formed and specified in said contract
(including all incidental expenses), in
conformity with the provisions of this
Article, according to the nature and
character of the work. The assessment
shall briefly refer to the contract, the

appeal, the Board of Public Works
shall proceed to estimate upon the
lands, lots, or portions of lots within
said assessment district, as shown by

pense thereof, then said Board shall,
before it passes a resolution of its in
tention to recommend the ordering of
said work or improvement, establish
by resolution a method by means of
which such assessment shall be made;
and on the completion of the work or
improvement to the satisfaction of said
Board, or to the satisfaction of the
Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex
pense thereof according to the method
established by said resolution.
Sec. 11. In making all assessments
the Board of Public Works shall act

two years from the date of said record
ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record
ing of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons interested In said
as;s( ssnient shall be deemed to have no
tice of the contents of the record
thereof.
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall
b* delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
until after the payment to the Board
of tho Incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as
signs. By virtue of said warrant said
conti actor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re
ceive the amount of the several ussess
ment3 made to cover the sum due for
the work specified in such contracts
and assessments.
When it shall appear by the final
judgment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render such judg
ment, that any suit brought to foraclose
tho lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, irregularity, or ille
ga'ity, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to
any euch assessment, or In the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with

final judgment, apply to the Board for
apolner assessment to be issued In con

within sixty days after the tinse of
said application, make an.l deliver to
said applicant a new assessmant, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots
of land set out therein for the period of
two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said lien as provided In this Chapter.
Should such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall' cajl upon the persons as
sessed, or their agents, if they can con
veniently be found, and demand pay
ment of the amount assessed to each.

tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same

of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons so assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is
stated as "unknown" upon the assess
ment, then said contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid in whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shall
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff in
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
ment upon the books of its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the productic-n to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
i were issued. If any contractor shall
fail to return his warrant within the
time and in the form provided in this
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon
which a return may be made with the
same effect as if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum until paid.

lic benefit, it shall make an estimate
of the expense of such improvement,
and determine by resolution the district
which will be affected by, and should
be assessed for, the expense of such im
provement. No proceedings shall ba

til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary
of the Board an amount of money
which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
the expense that may be incurred in
case the Supervisors shall not pass an
ordinance for said improvement.
Sec. 2. If within three months after
the passage of the resolution determin
ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district

stating that they are the owners and
in possession of the lands named in said,
petition, the Board shall pass a reso
lution of its intention to recommend

will be benefited to the extent of the
expense of said improvement.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath It, If any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches
and hundredth^ during the i ast twelve hours.
Isobars,- or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"- usually
first appear un the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 11.â There was a period
of about fifteen minutes of animated selling
and quickly declining prices on the Stock Ex
j change to-day, after, the reading of the Pres
ident's message to Congress, and ther; were
some large buying orders executed in th> last
fifteen minutes of trading which brought iTicos
up to the top level of the day. Otherwise th*
market was in the hands of thÂ» room traders,
as it has been for several dava past Prices
opened up a point In many stocks, lost the ad
vance and rose again before the message was
sent to Congress. The drop after the reading
of the message was between 11 and 12 points
from the high point for the principal stocks.
Net gains at the close were over a point for
most leading stocks. The day's results were a
surprise. It can scarcely be gainsaid that they
go far to demonstrate that very few specula
tive contracts - remained to. be covered. The
bears who sold slocks short after the Maine
disaster evidently made up their minds some
,tfme since that the unfavorable effect upon
values ef securities was being discounted In
advance of the President's message. The bears
evidently covered, leaving a small short ac
count to be covered to-day. The offerings
i which brought about the decline to-day were
not large. The buying was largely by foreign
j houses, and it Is said the purchases were taken
; with a view to selling: on the London ex
: change to-morrow. That exchange was closed
i to-day, and no reflection came from there on
I the sentiment abroad in the developments be
tween the United States and Spain. The ab
; sence of any specific recommendation in the
, President's message â  for ousting the Span
â  lards from Cuba was taken as a bull point
The doubtful element in the situation is the
action which Congress Is likely to take. To
day's market demonstrated that until this
question is decided, there Is no disposition to
: enter into large operations in securities. Ow
! ing to the fact that to-day was a holiday in
London, there was almost nothing doing In
sterling exchange and quotations were merely
nominal, but about steady. The making of call
â¢ loans at 4 per cent indicated that there is no
1 immediate prospect of easy conditions in the
i money market. The sub-Treasury's credit bal
ance of $157,04S reflected -the further with
drawal of the Union Pacific payment which
â¢ has been left on deposit with New York banks
and which Is now being withdrawn as a set
i off to- the Government's expenditures for ex
â¢ pensÂ« account. Of the balance due the Gov
â¢ ernment on the Union' Pacific payment, which
' now amounts to about $12,000. one bank
; alone holds something more than $8,000,000. It
is Interesting to observe that of the total sur
plus reserve of the New York banks, amount
1 in* to about $35,000,000, the surplus of this
same bank makes up. about $5,250,000. In ad
dition to the withdrawal of Government de
posits the movement of . currency to the in
terior continues to-day in full force.
There was no ! marked activity in to-day's
bond market, but prices showed strength as the
day advanced. Total 5a1e5. 51,025, 000. New 4s,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 11.â Wheat to-day sold off
%c, largely on flne weather and enormous
world's shipments. Closing prices, however,
showed a decline of but â 'Vi 7 Â»c, sensational crop
damage reports from California relieving the
pressure late in the day. The President's
message was not a factor, the contents of it
being not generally known until trading for
the day was practically at an end. Com, Oats
and Provisions were all easier and left off at
small declines from Saturday's final prices.
The opening tone In Wheat was distinctly
â weak, July starting In at from 84& cto S4c,
compared with Saturday's close of S4*i@S4}ic.
Several Influences combined to bring about the
decline. Advices from Washington early were
i at a more pacific character, ana as a good
. deal of buying has been done of late on the
' belief that impending hostilities would bring
: about higher prices, this fact was responsible
| for more or less unloading. The weather
! West was very favorable for farming opera
: tions, and early crop reports were bearish. The
I Government crop report was expected to show
a condition of 87, against 81.5 last year, but un
; certainty in regard to this and the fact that
the foreign markets were still ' closed had a
tendency . to restrict trade all day. Small
Northwestern receipts were apparently over
: looked. Minneapolis and Duluth reported 211
cars, against 367 last week and 662 a year ago
Chicago receipts were So cars. The addition to
contract stocks was large. Besides receipts of ;
' 41 cars of this grade from regular sources, 23
cars and 14.000 bushels were - received from
1 mixing houses and a cargo of 70.175 bushels by
lake, a total of about 145.000 bushels. World's
; shipments were enormous, amounting to 10
376,000 bushels. Liquidation, which started at
I the opening, was kept up without Intermission
for some time, the price finally dropping to
S3' 2 c. This was below the ."put" price, and a
'â  flight rally was caused by buying by holders
of these privileges, July reacting to S3%Â©B3Â»ic.
- This show of strength lasted but a short time
The visible, which was expected to show a de
crease of about 1.000,000 bushels, proved a se
vere disappointment to the bulls, the decrease
amounting to but 94.000 bushels. The market
â  quickly sold off again on this announcement
and the lowest prices of the day were re
â  corded.' July got down to 83H(&S3yc. The
market then steadied somewhat on covering
by shorts, but did not rally much until after
; the noon hour, when the great strength of the
San : Francisco market and decidedly sensa
tional reports of the Wheat condition In Cali
fornia . put a different complexion on things
and caused the best buying of the day, some
really Important short lines being covered. The
California reports were the worst so far 1 re
'â  ceived, a hot norther prevailing, with an ad
vance of 4 2-10 cat San Francisco. During the
last hour of trading the market showed a good
deal of firmness. The July price finally ad
vanced to 83'bC and closed at that figure.
Corn was very weak early. Fine weather and
the break in Wheat started general selling a
break of Vie resulting. The market soon be
came dull with narrow fluctuations until near
the close, when the rally in Wheat brought
buyers into the market and prices rallied to the
best point of the day. May ranged from 2V?Â»@
29% c and closed %6>4c lower at 23%@25*ic. ~
â  Oats ' In a general : way sympathized with
Wheat and Corn, and ruled weak and lower on
a moderate amount of trading. The fine
weather also counted. : Demand was very light
until near the end, when It Improved on the
Wheat rally, the market closing fairly steady
at some rally from the bottom. May ranged
from 25%@25%c to 25?4c. and ; closed a shade
lower at 2Â«Hc. â â¢:.â â¢â 
Business In Provisions was light and mostly
of a scalping nature. Lower hog prices, the
grain decline and the more peaceable prospect
at .Washington were responsible for. an' open
ing decline, and the Mill lower prices which
followed. Market improved ; with the late re
coveries in grain and closed steady. May pork.

local prices are so high above the rest of the

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
It is reported on good authority that the
Apricot crop of Southern California has not
been damaged as severely as at first thought,
and that a fair crop will be harvested there.
In the or.tral and northern parts of the State,
however, the cmp will be a practical failure.
The same authority reports that $40 is being
bid for new Apricots in Alameda County, btu
the grower refuses to sell under $60. These are
fancy figurp*, and it is rather early in the
season to make any prices for this fruit.
Oranges continue firm, with prospects for
better prices.

The market for all kinds Is doing better, with
an Improved demand from the East. Honey is
selling briskly at {islng prices, as the crop bids
fair to fall short, owing to the dry saason.
The East is buying. Almonds and Walnuts
are also in demand and firm, ' and Apricots,
Peaches and Prunes are meeting with more in
quiry. The East has at last woke up to the
fact that frost has done a good deal of dam
age, and Is replenishing stocks In consequence.
Buyers are already going out Into the coun
try for Apricots, and it is reported that they
are bidding as high as $40 per ton for the fresh
fruit, but not getting any. After the cannera
and shippers ; get through with Apricots this
year -it Is expected â¢ that mere will be very few
for drying. â¢ >

THE COLONEL'S OPINION.
"War," said the old colonel as he stirred
his toddy, "is too terrible to contemplate
It should not be lightly spoken of sir
it is a serious, sad affair. I have two
graves in Virginia, one in Tennessee and
three in Kentucky, and but for war the
men who fill them would be living- yet!"
"Your sons, colonel?" asked the listener
In an awed voice.
The colonel tossed off his toddy, and
stroking his gray beard, said:
"No, r-irâ my substitutes; the brave men
who fought, bled and died for me!"
Then the listener coughed and observed
that whisky was not as good now as it
was before the war.â Atlanta Constitu

A QUARREL
ALMOST LED
TO DEATH
Lawrence Hall Tries
to End His
Life.
Differences Between the
Girl He Loved and
Her Mother.
While Desperate a Dose of
Strychnine Was Taken, but
Soon Counteracted.
SAID TO BE ACCIDENTAL.
ThÂ« Would -Bo Suicide Will Re
cover, and His Action May Lead
to a Speedy Marriage.
Because of a quarrel between the *rlrl
he loves and her mother, Lawrence Hail.
a machinist employed at the Union Iron
Works, took a dose of strychnine yes
terday morning with suicidal intent, and
although he is at present out of danger,
it is just possible the attempt may be re
peated. The would-be suicide resides at
Lawrence Hil', the Would -Be Suicide, and Hanna Wolf, the Cirl
He Loves.
307 Ritch street, where he met Miss Han
nah Wolf, and after a short time became
engaged to marry her, but from differ
ences of opinion which have arisen in the
Wolf family from time to time, the mar
riage has met with numerous delays.
At times Mrs. Wolf has agreed to the
match and again withdrawn her permis
sion, and it is* reported in the neighbor
hood that the enpipoment has been brok
en off on one or two occasions. The de
lay seemed to worry Hill, and yesterday
when his intended and her mother started
to go over the old ground concerning the
advisability of the marriage, he became
desperate and tried to end his life. Dr.
â Thomas w::s hurriedly called in, and to
this Hill owes his life.
All parties concerned in the matter deny
that an attempt at suicide had been
made, but Mitrtin Wolf, a brother of the
girl, admitted that Hill had tried to kill
himself because of family troubles and
the delay in the marriage, which had
long been contemplated. It was reported
at the residence that Hill had been suf
fering for some weeks past and that a
medicine chest which was in the room
contained strychnine. Also that the suf
ferer from the poison was near-sighted
from the fact that he had but recently
had an operation performed on one of his
eyes for the purpose of extracting a
splinter of iron, and while thinking that
he was taking medicine he was in the
habit of using he had accidentally taken
up the poisonous draught which so nearly
cost him his life.
â¢ After the effects of the poison had been
counteracted by the physician and it was
seen he was out of danger, Miss Wolf
took it ULion herself to attend Hill, as
sisted by his brother, who had come from
Oakland after hearing of the desperate
attempt, but he also denies that suicide
was intended. He declares he is at a loss
to account for the poison which was tak
en by his brother. A report of the matter
was sent to police headquarters early in
the day and the police are investigating
the circumstances surrounding the mat
ter.
The action of Hill Is wondered at by
the neighbors of the family, but they
freely admit it was the result of family
troubles brought about through a love
affair, and state that if he is crossed in
his intentions the attempt will be repeat
ed with an ending more successful from
a Berious standpoint than the first ven
ture.
The unhappy man Is well liked by all
who know him and his fellow employes '
Fay he is a splendid workman, as well aa
Hnher and industrious. Miss Wolf was
heartbroken over the matter and her mo
ther swmeil to share her feelings. It is
more than probable that the desperate at
tempt to end all in death will resujt in
marriage.
MASONIC PLANS
ARE FORMULATING
Schemes to Make thÂ« Coming
Festival a Worthy
Success.
1 :>â â  ~ -. of the Commandery Work
ing on a Theater â a Memo
rial Hall.
Schemes to add interest to the Masonic
festival are multiplying daily, and as
ea< h new one is launched it finds ad
mirers who carry it along with an en
thusiasm worthy and certain of success.
So numerous have the prospective par
ticipants become, and bo extensive are the
plans being: arranged it is almost certain
the entire pavilion will be required to ac
commodate them all, not only the ground
floor, as was at first Intended.
\V. S. Mackay, chairman of the ticket
commit t.-e, has already placed 15,000 tick
ets, not one of which will be returned.
The lodges axe voting lodge money to buy
a ticket for each member, and then the
Individual member* call for more. All
ovÂ«r Lha State the cry. 1b for more, and
there will be no difficulty in getting rid
of the whole issue of 30,000, or even be
yond that number should more be printed.
The finance and decoration committees
of ladies of the Grand Comraandery met
yesterday to lay plans for the comman
dery booth, â which is to be one of the
most attractive in the festival. It will be
beautifully decorated and every lady will
contribute something to be sold. The
principal feature of the boota, however,
will be a theater, where performances
will be kept going as long as the festival
doors are open. Already committees are
out looking for talentâ musical, dramatic
or athletic, amateur or professional.
Another original plan, proposed by R.
P. Hurlburt. and under his charge, is to
build the walls of the reception-room of
the home of small tiles, each bearing the
name of a M#son. The tiles are 6x2
inches, and fvr $5 a name will be burned
in in gold and will gleam from the wall
in perpetual memory of the man who
tried to help. The names are being beau
tifully painted by Miss Annie Flint,
danghter of B. P. Flint, one of the prom
inent commanders of the commandery.
The souvenir programme is almost
ready to go to press. There will be 5000
struck off and more will be issued should
the sale justify an increase of that
number.
The following letter 1r a sample of the
assistance come of the merchants are
rendering: â¢

MAY ISSUE A
RIVAL DIRECTORY
A Plan Discussed by Striking
Printers to Employ
Idle Hands.
Employers Say They Are Not Afraid
of Any Action the Men
May Take.
The headquarters of the striking print
ers bore the appearance of the counting
room of the sub-treasury yesterday. It
was the first payday, and all day the
striking men were pouring in and out of
the building in an aJmost continuous
stream. The payment of the benefits has
encouraged the men greatly, and as they
stepped up to the cashier's desk and
caught the twinkle of Secretary Benoist's
eye, each gave the assurance that he
would "stand pat" until the echoing
notes of the last trump were heard if
necessary-
The strikers intend beginning their ag
j gressive work immediately. The talk of
I forming a co-operative office grows
j stronger day by day, and with it come
] rumors of a project to issue a rival city
â  directory-
"The Crocker directory is due on the
first of June," said a member of the
strike committee yesterday, "but since
the strike began very little work has
been done on lt_ We have had this fact
brought to our notice by many subscrib
ers, who fear it will not be out on time,
and we have had abundant assurance that
if we started in to get out a rival one It
would be well patronized. We have a
large force of men on our hands now
whom we are obliged to pay, and it would
be as cheap to pay thÂ«m for doing some
thing as nothing. With this force we
could easily get out a book within a very
short time. I am experienced in this
matter, and know exactly whai I am say
ing. I fully realize the magnitude of the
undertaking, but I am confident that,
with the men at our disposal, the work
could easily be done."
The members of the comnaittee are
smiling and happy, and say they expect
ed some few of the boys having families
dependent on them might get "cold feet"
and go back to work, but they have not
lost a man.
The employers show no signs whatever
of yielding. All the shops are running
and the employers have plenty of work.
"1 believe the union is about to com
mence boycotting tactics," said a mem
ber of the Typothetae, "but let them go
ahead at It If they want to. Yhe day of
the boycott has passed, and we don't
care whether they try it or not. My shop
is running full force and the work is up
to the usual standard. I am turning men
away every day, and I think every other
employer in the city will tell you the
same thing. Two more employers Per
nau Bros, and Wilcox & Co., have joined
our association to-day, and while these
were not union offices it goes to show the
sentiment, and each accession helps us
along.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 1898.
THE TWO GIANTS
ARE MATCHED
Sharkey and Jeffries to
Fight Before the Na-
tional Club.
Great Heavy Weight Contest
Will Take Place Early
in May.
Fitzsimmons Will Be Challenged by
the Winner for the World's
Championship.
The long felt want of the sporting fra
ternity of this city has finally been com
plied with.
After weeks of wrangling and also of
meetings which amounted simply to dis
cussion, Jim Jeffries, the big heavyweignt
pugilist of Los Angeles, per his agent,
Billy Delaney, has agreel to meet Tom
Sharkey, the pride of the American navy,
in a contest of twenty rounds.
Last evening Delaney, acting for Jef
fries, and Tom Sharkey, acting in his own
behalf, met the directors of the National
Athletic Club and a long discussion was
had over a prospective meeting between
the two giants of the ring.
Sharkey, as previously stated, refused
to meet Jeffries in the Olympic Crub, be
cause certain prominent members testi
fied against him in a case that deeply in
terested the sailor.
Delaney, although favoring the Olym
pic, was not altogether disposed to givÂ«
the National Club the cold shoulder, and
yesterday he notified the managers of the
National that he would discuss the propo
sition of a match, provided Sharkey was
present at the meeting to be held last
evening.
Sharkey stated at the meeting that he
was approached on Saturday last at the
race track by William Kennedy, the su
perintendent of the Olympic, and asked If
he would fight under the Olympic Club's
auspices.
"1 will give you 65 per cent of the gross
receipts and a bonus if you will fight for
the Olympic," said Kennedy. "Now, give
me your answer. Tom."
"Well," sa Sharkey, In teiling of it,
"my answer to Kennedy was that I
would not fight in his club, owing to the
treatment I had received from some of
its members, and it went at that."
When Sharkey had finished speaking,
Gibbs of the National remarked that he
had had a verbal understanding wim
Howard Taylor of the Olympic Club,
which was to the effect that neither club
was to offer the pugilists more than 60
per cent of the gross receipts. "But now
that the club has mapped out a cutthroat
policy," said Gibbs, "I guess everything
goes, and may the best club win."
"Well, let us get down to business,"
remarked Delaney: "What will the Na
tional give us; that's the question?"
After no end of talk, Delaney, on the
part of Jeffries, accepted 65 per cent of
the gross receipts, and Sharkey acquiesced
in the club's proposition.
The winner will receive 73 per cent and
the loser 25 per cent of the 65 per cent.
The next and most important question
discussed was the selection of a referee.
"Gentlemen, 1 guess I will take the floor
for a few minutes, if I'm in order," re
marked Sharkey. "What I want to say
is this. You know that I have not re
ceived a square deal from California ref
erees in the past, but rather than dis
appoint my friends and the sporting peo
ple of this city, I will agree, this time,
to a local referee, provided that the man
selected is anything near being a good
honest fellow."
Several names were mentioned and re
jected by both Sharkey ajid Delaney, but
no objections were made to Jim Chesley
and Alexander Greggains. Those two
prominent sportsmen will be seen to-day
and if either one will agree to serve, the
articles of agreement will be signed this
evening. In case Greggains and Chesley
refuse to act. other names will be pro
posed at this evening's meeting; but
should the principals or their representa
tives fail to agree upon a "suitable per
son, the articles read that a referee must
be selected not later than ten days after
the fighters affix their signatures to the
document. â¢>â â 
There will be no hitting in the clinches,
and the match is set for the evening of
May 6, either at Woodward's or Mechan
ics' Pavilion.
As a guarantee of good faith the club
and the pugilists will deposit $1000 each
this evening.
The Excelsior Athletic Club will give a
first-class athletic entertainment on Fri
day evening at its club rooms. Eighth and
Folsom streets.
The principal event will be an eight
rounrl contest between Billy Otts and
Hughie Dougherty.
The Manhattan Club will entertain its
members on the 29th lnst. at 1749 Mission
street.

divorce yesterday against Hymaxi Wisan

PERCY BEAMISH
QUITS HIS STORE
Bad Real Estate Investments
Lead to Losses That Are
Disastrous.
His Honorable Carear of Thirty Years
Will Guarantee Friendly Aid
From Creditors.
Percy Beamish, a well-known merchant
of this city, yesterday transferred his
business interests to David Neustadter,
his principal creditor, to whom he owes
about $15,000.
A meeting of the creditors will be held
this morning at 10 o'clock at the Board
of Trade, where arrangements will doubt
less be made by which Mr. Beamish,
whose standing is exceedingly high, will
be able to start anew.
Speaking of his financial troubles last
evening, Mr. Beamish said: "The busi
ness itself is all right, but my trouble
began in 1892, when r Invested $150,000 in
real estate. My total liabilities are $71,000,
of which $40,000 is protected by mortgages.
It is a simple case of a man who entered
into real estate Investments that have not
panned out."
"I own 412 feet on Van Ness avenue, for
which I paid about $40,000, but there is
no market for the property. I also pur
chased land In San Jose, which is well
located, but it would be almost Impossible
to give it away. # My misfortunes are due
to these investments and very dull times.
I have been In business in this city for
thirty years, during which time. I have
paid Neustadter Brothers nearl" $1,000,000.
I have had large dealings with other well
known firms, and have always paid
promptly. The proceeding is entirely vol
untary, as I nave tired of selling shirts
to pay exorbitant interest on real estate
investments."
BULLETS FLEW
IN ABBOTT'S DIVE
Frank Gorman, an Ex-
Convict, Fired at the
Bartender.
Rapid Exchange Followed, but
All the Bullets Went
Into the Wall.
Both Men Arrested, but They Reluee
to Prosecute Each Other and
May Escape Punishment.
The dive kept by Billy Abbott on Grant
avenue was the scene of another shooting
affray early yesterday morning, and al
though four shots were fired no one was
hurt.
Frank Gorman, an ex-convict, and John
A. Abbott, who is a bartender in his
brother's saloon, quarreled Sunday after
noon about a woman named Gladys Beck
ner, well known In the "tenderloin" dis
trict. They parted vowing vengeance
against each other.
About 2 o'clock yesterday morning Gor
man went to Abbott's saloon and opened
flre upon John Abbott, who was behind
the bar. He fired three shots, but his
aim was bad and the bullets were buried
in the wall. As Gorman turned to run
Abbott fired a shot at him but misÃed
him.
Policemen Colen and Ingham heard the
shots and ran to the dive and placed Ab
bott under arrest. He was taken to the
City Prison and a charge of assault with
a deadly weapon booked against him.
Two hours later the officers arrested Gor
man, and a similar charge was booked
against him.
The cases were called in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday morning, but neither
would swear to a complaint against the
other, and both wished the cases dis
missed. The Judge refused to discharge
the defendants and, as instructed by Chief
Lees, Policeman Colen made affidavit as
to the shooting, and the Judge continued
the cases until Thursday. Meantime the
police will endeavor to find a witness to
the shooting and get him or her to swear
to complaints.
Gorman has served a seven years' term
in San Quentin for manslaughter, and
outside of that his record is bad. Ab
bott's brother also bears a bad reputa
tion and has a police record.
The dive where the shooting took, place
ls one of the worst in the city. It !s
frequented by ex-convicts and the lowest
class of women. Shootings have been oi
frequent occurrence there, and the pro
prietor has been himself the target for
bullets more than once. It is about time
the police closed up this notorious dive,
and why it has not been done before fs a
puzzle to other people in the locality.
Kenichi and Dr.Orpen Are Held.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday refused the applications for
writs of habeas corpus in the cases of
Dr. Arthur Herbert Orpen. wanted for
murder by the authorities of New Zea
land, and of Oyama Kenichi, wanted by
the Japanese Government for forgery
They will be held pending the actlor of

in the Future.
Contractor John Kelso and his wife,
Eleanor, have settled their differences and
buried the hatchet in the interests of
peace. The lady yesterday withdrew her
divorce suit and removed from the home
of her mother in Oakland to the residence
of her husband on Howard street.
Mrs. Kelso brought her divorce suit on
the ground of extreme cruelty, alleging
among other things that Kelso was in
sanely jealous and that he struck her be
cause jealous of a music teacher from
whom his wife was taking lessons. Â« v
In their agreement to live together
again Kelso agrees to pay his wife $100
a month as pin money instead of $4, the
sum he had been allowing. He also agrees
to deport himself mildly and suppress all
demonstrations of Jealousy.
In her complaint the wife had asked for
about $200,000 as her share of the com
munity property, which consisted largely
of shares of stock in the John Kelso
Company. When she assigned her shares
to her attorney, .who appeared at a meet
ing by proxy and demanded to see the
books and have them experted, there was
a great deal of excitement in the house
of the defendant, and there were imme
diate overtures for an armistice. Mean
time, Professor Hill, who was named as
the music teacher over whom there was
trouble, has left the city. His where
abouts is at present unknown, but it is
supposed that ho;lÂ«ft t^ avnM *he> noto
riety, as both his friends and the lady's
knew there was nouung in me suspicions
of the husband. .
During the progress of the suit Kelso
assaulted and battered a process-server,
for which he was arrested. Although he
broke the' officer's ribs, he boasted , that
he had a pull in the Police Court, and
Judge Low lined him but $20.
Yachtsmen Lay Plans.
The Pacific Inter-Yacht Club Associa
tion met in the Merchants' Exchange last
night with .the representatives of the five
clubs composing the association present,
and fixed the dates for the annual cruise
and regatta. July 4 was decided upon as
the time for the holding of the former
event. All the yachts will rendezvous at
Vallejo on the 3d and the cruise will be
held upon the following day. The re
gatta will be held on September 9, and the
committee having that in charge will
meet in the near future for the purpose
of making all the necessary arrange
ments.
City Property Secured.
City Attorney Creswell has addressed a
communication to the Supervisors stat
ing that the city has succeeded in estab
lishing its claim to 109 valuable lots of the
Mission Creek and Channel street lands,
and recommends that all property belong
ing to the city in that section be fenced
and taken possession of.
