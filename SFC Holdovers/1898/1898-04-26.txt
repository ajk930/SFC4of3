WAR MEASURE

the Greatest Sea Fight
of Modern Times.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 25.
With a gold pen in a polished
ebony holder, President McKinley at
6:18 o'clock this evening signed the
resolutions passed by Congress de
claring a state of war to exist be
twen the United States and the king
dom of Spain. There were but two
witnesses to this interesting cere
mony, Attorney-General Griggs and
the faithful Sergeant Loeffler, who
has acted as private doorkeeper to
every President since Lincoln first
entered the White House.
The resolutions were based upon
the President's message transmitted
to Congress at noon to-day,, and after
prompt passage by the House were
considered in executive session by
the Sanate. Several amendments
were proposed, but ail were defeated
by decisive votes, the sentiment of
the great majority of Senators being
that no time should be lost in per
fecting the record on which this
couitry must stand in the eyes of
the civilized world.
It was just ten minutes past 5
o'clock when Deputies Buchanan and
Davis of the Senate and House ex
ecutive st..ffs started for the White
House with the resolution engrossed
cm parchment. When they reached
the executive mansion the President
had retired to his private rooms for
a little rest, and they waited forty
minutes in the anteroom. As soon
as the President reappeared in his
office a telephone message brought
Attorney-General Giiggs, who cast
the critical eye of a lawyer over the !
\ document and pronounced ft regular
in form and substance. The President
then took the pen both Speaker
Reed and Vice-President Hobart had
used, and which was furnished by
Representative Allen Smith, and

THE MESSAGE
CALLING THE
DECLARATION
WASHINGTON, April !'>.â The President to-day sent to Congress the
following message recommending a declaration of war against Spain:
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America:
1 transmit to the Congress for its consideration and appropriate action, copies
r.f correspondence recently had with the representative of Spain In the United
â¢ â¢ with the United States Minister at Madrid, and through the latter, with
the Government of Spain, showing tho action taken under the joint resolution
approved April 20, In<<S, for the rocognition of the independence of the people of
Cuba, demanding that the Government of Spain relinquish Its authority and
government in the island of Cuba, and to withdraw its land and naval forces
from Cuba and Cuban waters, and directing the President of the United States
to use the land and naval forces of the United States to carry these resolu
tions Into eff'-ct.
Upon communicating to the Spanish Minister in Washington demand
which, it became the duty of the executive to address to the Government of
Spain In obedience to said resolution, the said Minister asked for his passports
and withdrew. The United States Minister at Madrid was in turn notified by
the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs that the withdrawal of the Spanish
ntative from the United States had terminated diplomatic relations be
tween the two countries, and that all official communications between the re-
Bpectlve representatives ceased therewith.
I recommend to your especial .-mention the note directed to the United States
Minister ;it Madrid by the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs on the .21st in
st&nt, whereby the foregoing notification was conveyed. It will be perceived
that toe Bpanish Government, having cognizance of the joint resolution of the
Congress of the United Estates, and In view of things which the President is
thereby required and authorised to do, responds by treating the demands of
this Government as measures of hostility, following with that instant and com
plete severance of relations by its action which, by usage of nations, accom
panies an existent state of war between sovereign powers.
The position of Spain being thus made known, and the demands of the
United States being denied, with a complete rupture In the intercourse with
Spnln. I have been constrained in the exercise of the power and authority con
ferred upon me by the joint resolution aforesaid to proclaim, under date of
April 22. IS9S. a blockade of certain ports of the north coast of Cuba, lying be
tween Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and of the port of Clenfuegos on the south
coast of Cuba; and further, in exercise of my constitutional powers, and using
the. authority conferred upon me by the act of Congress approved April 22,
1898, to Issue my proclamation dated April 23, IS9B, calling for volunteers in
order to carry into effect the said resolution of April 20, 1898. Copies of these
proclamations are hereunto appended.
In view of the measures so taken, and with a view to the adoption ,of
sucfa other measures as may be necessary to enable me to carry out the ex
pressed will of the Congress of the United States in the premises, I now recom
mend to your honorable body the adoption of a joint resolution declaring that
a Htate of war exists between the United States of America and the Kingdom
of Spain and I urge speedy action thereon to the end that the definition of
the international status of the United States as a belligerent power may be
made known, and the assertion of all its rights and the maintenance of all ita
duties in the conduct of a public war may be assured.

BY SATURDAY
HONGKONG, April 26. â i A. M.â Before this dis
patch appears in type Commodore Dewey's squadron of
seven fine warships will have sailed from Mirs Bay to
attack Manila.
Consul Williams will arrive here early to-day and
will be taken to Mirs Bay in a specially chartered
steamer.
The fleet will sail immediately after his arrival. An
attack on Manila will probably have been made by next
Saturday-
Commodore Dewey regards Mr. Williams' work in
Manila so highly that he will not start till Mr. Williams
is ready to accompany him, but "it is believed there will
be no delay on this score.
The Spaniards have one good cruiser at Manila, the
Reina Christina of 3500 tons, four effective gunboats of
less than 1200 tons and half a dozen smaller craft of no
fighting value.
Manila has a few. modern guns mounted, but will be
powerless against such a force as that of the American
fleet.

Yesterday we lay quite close in, in a little cove
twenty miles west of Havana, and news reached us
that food has already reached famine prices in
Havana sinc^ the war commenced. For three years
in Cuba supp.its for the population have had to be
procured from the United States.
Now this source is closed and the price of fresh
meat-is stated to be $2 a pound in Havana. What

NEW YORK, April 25.â A Key West special to the Herald says:

got his information
and reported at length
to Acting Vice Admiral
Sampson on board the
flagship this morning.
This much of the Porter's ex
pedition lam permitted by Admiral
Sampson to make public. The
Admiral regards the exploit as a
daring one.
The active squadron blockading
Havana in connection with other
sections maintaining the blockade
of other ports had an easy time
last night in comparison with the
two preceding nights of the block
ade.
The sky was perfectly clear, and
in the early part of the night it
was moonlight. The story of the
movements of the flagship New
York is that after dropping a Her
ald correspondent about thirty
miles off shore into the torpedo
boat in which he proceeded to Key
West the ship cruised about the
gulf in a wide radius, but found
nothing.
She returned to the blockading
line about sundown on Sunday and
devoted the night to a vigorous
chase of moving lights, but found
nothing that could not give a sat
isfactory account of itself. Among
the vessels spoken was the British
schooner lolanthe. The flagship
noticed that the light on Morro
Castle had been extinguished, and
instead there is a powerful search
light mounted. A searchlight has
also been mounted on the Santa
Clara batteries.
The gun crews on
the New York say that
they can put these
lights out in the first
Jive minutes of firing.
Quite unexpectedly and by the
merest chance I came into the
oossession to-day of news about
what is going on in Cuba. The
reported armistice between Gomez
and the Spaniards has not come
to pass. The insurgents are forc
ing the fighting. The Spanish,
fearing an assault by land and sea,
are hurrying their troops into the
cities. The insurgents have ap
oeared in force within thirty miles
of Havana, and there was a raid
by them just beyond Boca de Ja
ruce this morning, and the com
batants must have had a full view
of the blockading squadron.
When the dispatch boat bearing
this cable left Cuban waters smoke
from a great fire set by the insur
gents was rising over the hills.

SPAIN'S PLEA
TO THE POWERS
Memorandum Submitted
by Senor Gullon to
Europe.
Claims That Reforms Were
Actually Commenced on
the Island of Cuba.
Asserts That Cubans Can Never
Govern Themselves, and Cites
Olney as Authority.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 26.â The Times this
morning publishes Spain's memoran
dum to the powers, dated April IS, and
signed by Senor Gullon, the Spanish
Minister of Foreign Affairs. The mem
orandum begins by recording the
"moral and material aid the Cuban
rebels have received from the United
States" in Filibustering expeditions and
the operations of the junta. It men
tions Spain's repeated and persistent
denials to the allegations of cruelty to
ward the Cubans and lays great stress
upon President Cleveland's dispatch of
December 17, 1896, to the effect that
peace would be possible if Spain gave
a sufficient autonomy to Cuba. The
memorandum contends that in the face
of the new liberal constitution granted
Cuba, which "has already borne fruit,"
it is difficult to understand why Presi
dent McKinley in his message of De
cember 6, 1597, and General Woodford,
in the note of December 18, 1897, should
still doubt Spain's loyalty.
The document then speaks at some
length of the Maine accident, and as-
Berta that the Americans, under the
pretext of the extra-territoriality of
the vessel, never allowed Spanish au
thorities to visit the wreck for pur
poses of investigation; and it most
solemnly asserts the absolute Inno
cence of Spain's officials and of Span
ish subjects, generally.
The fairness and loyalty of Spain
are then shown by a reference to the
equitable treatment which American
filibusters, more especially those of
the Competitor, have received a' the
hands of Spain, and in order to show
more fully how pacific and correct has
been the attitude of the Spanish Gov
ernment the memorandum enume
rates the four clauses of the Spanish
proposals. These are:
Firstâ An offer to submit, all questions
arising from the Maine affair to arbitra
tion.
Second â An order to Governor Blanco to
retire into the western provinces and to
apply 3,00u,00u pesetas for the relief of the
agricultural population, with an accept
ance by the Spanish Government of re
lief for Cuban sufferers by the United
Estates, provided such relief were sent in
merchant vessels.
Third â The co-operation of the Cuban
Parliament in formulating the extent of
the powers to be reserved for the c;r.ual
Government.
Fourthâ ln view of the Cuban Parlia
ment not meeting before May 4, the
proclamation of an immediate armistice.
The memorandum proceeds to declare
that the United States has not accepted
these far-reaching concessions and that
the good offices of the Pope have been
equally unavailing. It asserts that the
Maine accident was used by political
parties in America as a means of "hurl
ing most gratuitous and intolerable cal
umnies at the Spanish Government,"
and yet, the document says, Mr. Olney,
in an official note dated April 4, 1896, to
the Spanish Minister in Washington,
expressed very serious apprehensions
lest the only existing bond of union in
Cuba should disappear in the event of
Spain withdrawing from that island.
Mr. olney â as the memorandum ar
guesâfeared at that time that a war of
races would ensue, all the more san
guinary in proportion to the experi
ence and discipline acquired during the
insurrection and that two republics
would at once be formed, one white
and the other black, the upshot being
that one of the two would swallow the
other.
The grave view thus taken by Mr.
Olney of the future of Cuba, freed from
Spain's rule, is then enlarged upon and
inevitable racial wars are foreshadow
ed which are certain to wreck the ex
istence of Cuba as a state should Spain
be deprived of sovereignty over the isl
and. Thus, being convinced, as Spain
is, that right and equality are on her
side, she will not and cannot surrender
her sovereignty in Cuba.

The Paris will pass within a few

Topeka is expected off the shoals
about Friday or Saturday, but she

SEA BATTLE
WITH SPAIN'S
WAR FLEET
Will Be Met Before II
Can Possibly Reach
Porto Bico,
NEWYORK,ApriI2S.-The
Herald's Washington corre
spondent telegraphs: Offi
cial information received at
the Navy Department this
afternoon is to the effect
that the Spanish fleet at St.
Vincent is fully coaled and
ready to sail. It is presumed
by department officials that
the fleethas received orders
from Madrid and that it will
leave its present position for
one ordered.
In diplomatic circles it is
believed the fleet's depar
ture is in anticipation of the
neutrality proclamation from
Portugal ordering all men-of
war of belligerent powers to
leave Portuguese ports with
in twenty-four hours. It is
officially known in Washing
ton that such a proclamation
is in course of preparation.
For one reason the au
thorities will regret the de
parture of the Spanish fleet
from Cape Verde Islands,
and for another they will be
glad of it. The first reason
is that with the ships at St.
Vincenttheyare alwaysable
to obtain accurate informa
tion concerning their where
abouts, and consequently it
would be a matter of some
anxietyshould theships pro
ceed to the Canary Islands,
from which point it is impos
sible to obtain reliable in
formation concerning the ar
rival or departure of Span
ish ships.
Positive relief will be ex
perienced if it be found that
the ships do not sail in the
direction of the South At
lantic, so as to head off the
battleship Oregon. Should
such action be taken there
is reason to believe that a
counter demonstration will
be made on the Canaries
and on Spain, as a matter of
self-defense. Spain will be
compelled to withdraw her
fleet to her own shores to
provide them with protec-
tion.
It is considered a proba
bility on the part of the au
thorities that Spain will send
the fleet to Porto Rico. That
point has not yet been de
clared ma state of blockade.
It is officially stated to

MYSTERIOUS
MISSION OF
THE COLUMBIA
Cruiser Puts In at Newport and
Receives Orders to Sail flgain
at the Break of Day.
NEW YORK, April 25.â The cruiser Columbia, Captain J. H.
Sands, arrived at Newport, R. 1., at 11:05 o'clock this forenoon and
anchored just back of the torpedo station. She saluted Commodore
Kautz of the naval station and an orderly was sent ashore with dis
patches notifying the Navy Department of her arrival. It was
learned that the Columbia's trip to Newport was entirely unexpected
by naval officers there and that the purpose of the short cruise was
unknown to all aboard except Captain Sands, if indeed it was known
to him.
The Columbia got away from Newport News at about midnight
on Saturday. The Minneapolis, also bound north on a mysterious
mission, had started a half-hour before. Both" were going at nearly
top speed, according to orders. The Columbia gradually drew up and
passed the Minneapolis and after an exciting race left her astern.
Aboard the Columbia they had no idea whatever of the destination
of the Minneapolis.
The Columbia made one of the fastest runs in her history from
Newport News to Newport, using her three screws all the way and
making an average of twenty and a half knots an hour. Better
time would have been made had not fog been encountered yester
day.
Captain Sands had frequent visits made to the telegraph office
during the day and late this afternoon it was learned that orders
had been received for the Columbia to sail at daybreak to-morrow.
Her destination could not be learned.
ST. JOHNS, N. P., April 2,"..â 1t is reported here to-night that a
Spanish warship has been sighted off Bay Bulls, twenty miles south
of St. Johns. She is supposed to be after American fishing vessels
on the Grand Banks. Between sixty and seventy Newfoundland fish
ermen left to-day to enlist in the American navy.

the part of Portugal is in line

first important battle of the* cam
paign. It is believed that the Cape
Verde squadron will attempt to ef
fect a junction with the Spanish fleet
in Cuban waters within a few days,
and as soon as it has been positively
determined that that fleet is on its
way to Cuba the flying squadron will
be ordered down to reinforce Captain
Sampson, and the American and
Spanish navies will be pitted against
each other in the greatest naval bat
tle of modern times. While it is rec
ognized that accidents are frequently
controlling in naval fights, there is
not a naval officer in Washington
who does not believe the engage
ment will result in a glorious vic
tory for the United States. This will
mean the crippling of the Spanish
fleet to such an extent as to discour
age all hope to which the Spaniards
in Cuba may now be clinging that
aid may be brought to fhe be
leaguered city of Havana before its
garrison 13 starved into subjection.
It seems a foregone conclusion that
Blanco and aids will be forced to
learn from bitter experience the woes
of poor reconcentrados driven from
their peaceful homes and herded with
out food or shelter in the fever
smitten slums of Havana. While
preparations are going forward for
a great naval battle in Cuban waters
Admiral Dewey's squadron in the far
away Pacific is cruising up and down
impatiently awaiting a signal to at
tack the Spanish forces in the Philip
pines. Dewey's fleet has left Hong
kong in compliance with the broad
spirited proclamation of Great Brit
ain denying to the fleets of either
combatant the shelter of her ports.
While even-handed justice is thus
meted out to Spain and to America,
the fullest sympathy of one Anglo-
Saxon country to another has been
extended to us in so unequivocal a
manner as to make it of little conse
quence what the attitude of all the
powers of Europe may be in the anx

cials declare, is the immediate cap
ture or destruction of the Spanish
vessels. After this has been ac
complished it will not be a difficult
matter to secure the fall of Manila,
of Luzon and cf other ports by
simply conducting a blockade such
as the North Atlantic squadron is
doing with reference to Cuban
ports. .
1 understand that Commodore
Dewey's plan of campaign contem
plates the capture or destruction
of the Spanish fleet. As stated in
the Herald this morning there are
six of these craft, none of which
is to be compared to the pro
tected cruisers Baltimore,. Olym
pia, Boston and Raleigh, of the
American squadron.
As Commodore Dewey has not
a large squadron it is anticipated
that he will not have sufficient
vessels to carry on a blockade
which will last any length of time.
He will, however, be able to block
ade the principal ports in which
the Spanish troops are stationed
and the insurgents in the islands
will probably give him assistance
by continuing their land opera
tions. Altogether naval experts
say Commodore Dewey 's task is
the easiest of those which have
been assigned to any flag officer.
Upon but one point are the offi
cials uneasy. This relates to the
continuance of cable communica
tion between Commodore Dewey
and the United States. There is
a Spansh cable line connecting
Hongkong and the Philippines,
and it may be found necessary to
cut the cable in order to prevent
the Spanish forces from cabling to
their government of the condition
of affairs in the island. It is ap
preciated by the authorities that
as Spain can send no reinforce
ments to the East it will do the
Spaniards very little good to know
what is going on in the Far East,
but for prudential reasons it is be
lieved Commodore Dewey should
get the cable under his control as
soon as possible. It is supposed at
the department that he will make
all necessary preparation to cut the
cable and to keep possession of the
end connecting him with Hong
kong, and with an operator on
board his ship he will be able to
communicate with the department
as often as shall be deemed nee-
essary.

CHALLENGE TO
GENERAL LEE
A Hot-Headed Spanish
Lieutenant Wants a
Duel.
Sends to Captain Sigsbee Also
an Invitation to Fight
Him.
Resents the Accusation That His
Countrymen Blew Up the
Maine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 25.
Lieutenant Ramon de Carranza of the
Spanish royal navy, until recently
naval attache of the Spanish legation
at Washington, has challenged General
Fitzhugh Lee and Captain Sigsbee of
the Maine to fight duels. The chal
lenges were issued on the night that
the Spanish Minister withdrew from
Washington. Lieutenant de Carranza
had determined upon this course of ac
tion immediately after General Lee and
Captain Sigsbee stated before the Con
gressional committees that, in their be
lief, Spanish naval officers were respon
sible for the blowing up of the Maine.
He made known his purpose to Min
ister Polo, who peremptorily forbade
him issuing the challenge while he was
a member of the legation staff. Lieu
tenant de Carranza persisted that his
official position in no way restricted his
rights as a gentleman to call another
gentleman to account.
It was finally arranged that the is
suance of the challenges should await
the termination of diplomatic relations
between Spain and the United State 3,
whereupon Lieutenant de Carrar.r.a
would be absolved from any restraint
as an official under Minister Polo.
Lieutenant de Carranza's first chal
lenge was sent to General Lee, and it is
rather more lengthy than the one to
Captain Sigsbee. It is more deferen
tial, even courtly in tone, according to
the tenets of dueling, but aside from
the challenge proper, it contains an in
tentional insult to General Lee with
a view to provoking him to an accept
ance.
The letter states that General Lee,
in his testimony before a Congressional
committee, stated that in his judgment
Spanish officials exploded the mine
which blew up the Maine. This, Lieu
tenant de Carranza asserts in
his challenge, is a direct reflection upon
the honor of the naval officers who had
charge of the defenses of Havana.
"Any man who makes such a charge
on belief, and not on proof," the chal
lenge proceeds, "is himself capable of
committing the crime."
He refers to reports that General
Lee will return to Cuba as a major
general, and asks that, before he goes,
he will five the lieutenant the privi
lege of fighting him. The challenge
closes as follows:
"For eight days I shall await your*
answer at the Spanish Consulate in
Toronto."
The challenge to General Lee was
mailed at 6:30 p. m. on the 20th inst.,
as the Spanish Minister and his party
were about to take the train, the State
Department having furnished him his
passports that afternoon. It was
directed to the State Depart
ment, as General Lee had been as
signed from that department. It hap
pened, however that he had gone to
Richmond, so that it is not known
whether he received the letter the fol
lowing morning. Lieut, de Carranza
felt satisfied thay General Lee would
accept the challenge and that a : eet
ing would occur, probably on Can
adian soil.
The challenge to Captain Sigsbee is
substantially the same as that of Gen
eral Lee, but is slightly briefer, owing
to the omission of the phrase relating
to General Lee's return to Cuba as a
major-general. In this challenge, also,
eight days are given during which a
reply may be sent to the Spanish con
sulate at Toronto. The challenge was
sent to the Navy Department. Cap
tain Sigsbee had previously left for
Philadelphia to take command of the
auxiliary cruiser St. Paul, so that the
letter may not have reached him.
Lieutenant de Carranza made known
his purpose of leaving after waiting
eight days, when, if answers had not
been received, he would publish the
challpnges sent to General Lee and
Captain Sigsbee.

PHOENIX, April 25.â A mass meet
ing attended by territorial officers and
leading citizens of Phoenix was held
at 10 o'clock this morning in the county
courtroom for the purpose of appoint
ing a committee of safety which will
punish insults to the American flag and
take action on such sporadic cases oC

acted as chairman of the meeting, and

executive committee vf eleven was ap
pointed. Stirring speeches were made
by a number of leading citizens and in
tense enthusiasm prevailed.
A. A. Long, City Tax Collector, was
called upon immediately at the opening
of the meeting to relate. his experience
on Sunday morning. Mr. Long has his
right hand bandaged, having sustained
a fracture of the little finger in tight

"On Sunday morning," he said, "I
went to my office on an errand and
found a Spanish sympathizer tearing
down one of the American flags used

fore I could do anything he took the
flag and tore it from the flagstick and
threw the flag on the floor. The action
so enraged me that I picked up the
flag and made the miscreant kiss it,
and then, having nothing else, I used
my fist on him."
The meeting adjourned to allow the
executive committee time in which to
formulate a repci t, and convened again
at 8 o'clock in the evening. The court
room was crowded to suffocation. A
set of resolutions was adopted recom
mending that an enrollment of a com

ed an address to Senor Castelar, the
Republican k-ader, under the pretext of
congratulating him upon his recovery

"Washington, April 25.
The Senate to-day passed a bill de
claring that a state of war existed be
tween the United States and Spain.
The bill was in the same language as
that passed by the House.
The debate in the Senate was based
on an amendment offered by Senator
Turpie providing for the recognition of
the belligerent rights of the insurgent
Cubans, the amendment being practi
cally in the following language:
"We hereby recognize the rights of
the Cuban army under General Gomez
to be treated as belligerents, the free
dom and independence of the Cuban
people having heretofore been r&cog
nlzed by act of Congress."
The same amendment had been urged
in the Committee on Foreign Relations
previous to the reporting of the bill to
the Senate and the Indiana Senator
only agreed to the bringing in of the
bill on condition that his amendment
should be presented to the Senate. Both
in committee and In the Senate Turpie
made elaborate arguments in support
of his proposition. He contended that
so long as thi ii.surge;it rights of the
Cubans were unrecognized they couid
only be regarded as subjects of Spain,
and hence urged that our position in
declaring for the recognition of tru
freedom and independence of the Cu
ban people was entirely inconsistent
with our refusal to recognize their bel
ligerent rights. He also repeated his
argument made upon the resolution
providing for the intervention of this
country in the Cuban war, in regard to
the interest of holders of the Spanish
bonds in preventing the recognition of
the rights of the Cuban insurgents.
The roll of the Senate was called upon
this amendment and it was defeated by
a majority of fourteen, the vote stand
ing 24 to 38.
There was also some criticism of the
fact that the bill fixed a date in th>
past when the war had begun. Senator
Pettigrew declared that the 21st was
evidently used in order to make legal
the capture of the lumber vessel, the
Buena Ventura, on that date. He char
acterized this as a small piece of busi
ness for either the administration or
-ress to indulge in. and said that
undt-r the circumstances, if he had been
the President, he would have returned
the ship to its owners. He predicted
that the courts would In the end settle
the claim against us, regardless of this
declaration.
Senator Davis replied briefly to this
point, saying that the date was not
fixed by the capture of the Buena Ven
tura, but by the recognition of the
Spanish Government of a state of war,
as made on the 21st, and as outlined in
the President's message.
Senator White took up the Pettigrew
contention holding that the President
had not indicated any date for the he
ginr.ing of ho- ilities, but that he had
rather shown in his message that he
considered that the negotiations had
hy no means reached the point of hos
tilities. "The President speaks," said
the Sena*ir, "of our reasonable de
mands upon Spain. Did he," he asked,
â¢t Spain to take the view that
his demands were reasonable when he
had tasked Spain to part with a large
portion of her kingdom and to come up
smiling in view of this polite request?"
Continuing, White said that it was
his purpose to support the administra
tion in all reasonable measures for the
prosecution of the war, but he did not
regard the fixing of this date as in
any sense a response to a Presidential
request.
There was a general plea for speedy
action r>n this bill, and no amendment
was pressed for a change of date. This
motive also actuated Senator Davis to
withdraw an . mc-ndment suggested by
the Committee on Foreign Relations,
directing the President to prosecute the
w r to a successful termination. This
amendment was withdrawn in order to
leave the bill lust as i hn 1 passed the
House, thus dispensing with the neces
sity of a conference, and making it pos
sible to send the bill to the President
to-day.
There was no division on the passage
of the bill.
>\ ar and war measures were the only
topios discussed by the Senate to-day
during more than four hours of its ses'-
Plon. The body had scarcely convened
when the message of the President urg
ing Congress to declare the existence of
war hot ween the United States and Spain
was laid before it. Without comment the
message was referred to the Foreign Re
lations Commitl
Allen of Nebraska introduced the fol
lowing joint resolution, which he asked
to havo referred to the Committee on
Foreign Relations:
"That a state of war now exists and
since the 15th <iay of February 1898 has
existed between the United '.States of
America and the kingdom of Spain "
Consideration of the naval appropria
tion bill was then resumed, tho pending
question being upon tho amendment of
fered by Butler of North Carolina to reg
ul.ite the price of armor. The amendment
provides that for the armor for the
three battleships now in course of con
struction the Government shall not pay
to exceed $400 a ton. including the nickoi
and that subsequent contracts for armor
shall not call for a greater price than
$300 a ton. In case the price cannot be
obtained the Secretary of the Navy is
authorized at once to purchase or estab
lish a Government armor factory for
which $1,500,000 is appropriated, and in ad
dition Jl.iXKt.ooo is appropriated lor the
manufacture of the armor.
Uutler strongly advocated the adoption
of the amendment and said the ships of
this country were covered with defective
armor.
Hawley challenged this statement. "I
emphatically deny." said he. "thai there
iK any such amount of <. fective anripron
our war ships as the Senator from North
Carolina declares there is. And even If
the statement were true I leave it to the
country to judge of the propriety of
daunting the defects before Spain."
â¢â¢While I am i!i entire agreement with
the S'-nator from Connecticut," inter
jected (/handler of New Hampshire, "I
am also satisfied that the Senator (But
ler) is mistaken. Investigation has
Bhown that the tests of the armor were
satisfactory."
Chandler appealed to Hale, chairman
of the Naval Affairs Committee, and the
latter said: "The armor upon our ships
is the best in the world. No European
Government has armor on its ships so
good a.s ourp."
Butler was proceeding to read some

testimony taken before a committee of
the House relating to defective plates on
various United States war vessels, and
to make sharp comment upon it, when
Hawlty said sharply;
"I must protest against this. I believe
the Senator from North Carolina is out
of order in making those charges here
publicly. If he should put them in writ
ing and transmit them privately to Spain,
pointing out these detective plates, he
would be guilty of treason."
Tillman of South Carolina called atten
tion to the fact that the statements made
by Butler were based on ofiicial reports,
which were easily accessible.
Continuing, Butler adverted to what he
regarded as the "excited" utterances of
the Senator (Hawley), who, he said, had
risen and riung at him charges of treason.
He thought those who were guilty of
treason were those who had refused to
make provision for getting armor at a
reasonable price.
At the conclusion of Butler's speech
Stewart of Nevacia inquired of Hale
whether the naval bill in any way com
mitted the Government to pay $4(K) a ton
for armor for the proposed battle-ships
authorized by the bill.
Hale replied that nothing in the bill
could be construed as committing the
Government to pay any particular price
for armor.
"Does anybody know,' 1 inquired Allen,
"whether the modern battle-ship is a
fighting machine or not?" " â  â  ' 'Â«â¢â ;
"It is a great lighting machine," said
Hale, "but its power and efficiency have
never been demonstrated."
Tillman made an extended speech in
favor of the proposed amendment, in tne
course of winch he had a passage at arms
with Chandler, based upon a report made
by the latter favoring a reduction of the
price of armor.
Chandler pointed out that it was im
possible for the Government to secure a
better price than $400 a ton for armor un
til it should enter into a long-time con
tract whereby a certain specilied amount
of armor would be taken each year.
..aie declared that both the Naval Af
fairs and the Appropriations Committees
were opposed to the construction of a
Government armor factory, as they were
thoroughly satisfied it would save neither
time nor money.
Hale then moved to lay the amendment
upon the table, and it was so ordered by
a vote of 36 to 13.
Hale offered an amenament authoriz
ing the Secretary of the Navy to enlist
at any time after the passage of the act
as many seamen, landsmen and boys as
he may deem necessary to man the "ships
of the navy or for use of the navy
as a temporary force, and appropriat
ing $5,530,000 for that purpose. Hale agreed
to an amendment offered by Cockrell of
Jmssuuri that the time limit should be
during the existence of war. The amend
ment was agreed to,, the amendment
making the appropriation immediately
available.
An amendment was also agreed to pro
viding that hereafter all first-class bat
tle-ships and monitors shall be named
after the various States. The bill as
amended was passed.
The bill for bftter organization of the
iine of the army, providing for the three
battalion formation, was called up by
Hawley. The amendments offered by the
committee -were agreed to without di-
Ision.
One of the amendments is an addition
to the provision of section 3 authorizing
the President to accept the Â«iuotas of
troops of the various States and territor
ies. The committee's amendment re
quires that these Quotas shall be "in
companies, troops and batteries, each to
contain, so far as practicable, the num
ber of enlisted men authorized in this act
for each arm of the service, and battal
ions of not less than three such compa
nies and regiments of not less than ten,
nor more than twelve such companies,
but this proviso-Shall apply to companies,
batteries, battalions and regimental or
ganizations and none other."
Provision is also made for the Increase
of t!io signal corps in time of war, to
the extent of ten corporals. 100 first-class
privates and forty second-class privates,
who are to have the pay and allowance
of engineer troops of the same grade.

FRONTIER TOWNS
IN DANGER OF
BEING RAIDED
Citizens of Nogales Preparing
to Resist Spaniards and In=

NOGALES, Ariz., April 25. â Reports have reached Nogales that a
number of Mexican bandits, Indians and Spaniards are gathering
in -.^is vicinity, and that they intend to attack and sack this
city. Mayor Overtoil has received from Phoenix 100 Spring
field rifles and 2000 rounds of ammunition, and a home guard has
been organized for the protection of the city.
It is reported that seventy-five Papago Indians who recently at
tacked El Plomo, a mining camp in Mexico, but were repulsed by
Mexican troops, are headed this way. As Xogales is situated directly
upon the international boundary dividing the two republics, consider
able trouble is expected at this point. A great number of Spaniards
reside on the Mexican side of the line, and the report is circulated
of a conspiracy to indict damage on Americans.
Spanish merchants and residents of Xogales, Ariz., have taken
out naturalization papers in Mexico, and have applied to Mexican
Consul Mascarenas for protection In case of an attempt to confiscate
their property. The Mexican Government has ordered the Fifteenth
Regiment, infantry, stationed at Torin, Mexico, to proceed to No

TROUNCED FOR CURSING
THE AMERICAN FLAG.
SALINAS. April 25.â During the pro
gress of Druids' picnic at Toro gTounds
last night a man under the influence
of liquor cursed the American flag and
claimed the people were braggarts and
that Spain would whip the army sent
to Cuba, as well as the navy, easily, and
that he hoped to live to see it. He
was set upon by a member of the pat

SECRETARY
SHERMAN
RETIRES
Veteran Statesman Sends
His Resignation to
the President.
Judge Day o? Ohio Will Now
Take Charge of the State
Department, Assisted
by Prof. Moore.
Call Office, Rlggs House.
Washington, April 25.
John Sherman has left the Cabinet
and will be succeeded by his assistant,
Judge Day of Ohio.
The resignation of Sherman was
handed to the President at 12:15
o'clock. It was observed that Secre
tary Sherman remained with the
President a few minutes after the
other members of the Cabinet had left.
The Cabinet session was concluded at
11:30 o'clock, and five minutes later
Secretary Sherman left the room and
was driven at once to the State De
partment.
At about 11:45 the Secretary's mes
senger appeared with the resignation
inclosed in a large white official enve
lope. As the President had steppedout
for a few minutes' walk, themessenger
returned to the State Department. Only
a moment later the President returned
and the State Department was so ad
vised. At 12:15 the messenger again
appeared with the resignation, anl it
was taken to the President in the
Cabinet room. It was formally ac
cepted this afternoon.
The Secretary's letter is very brief,
occupying but a few lines, tenderinghis
resignation to take effect at as early
a date as will suit the President's con
venience.
It was not announced when Secre
tary Sherman's resignation would
take effect, the Secretary having
yielded his original idea of leaving at
once, and it is presumed that he will
remain until Judge Day qualifies as
his successor. The selection of John
B. Moore of New York, who is now
Professo r of International Law at
Columbia University, New York, to
succeed the latter, was warmly wel
comed by all of the State Department
employes. Appointed originally from
Delaware in the State Department by
Mr. Bayard, when the latter was Sec
retary. Mr. Moore, by sheer merit and
ability, worked his way up to the
place of Second Assistant Secretary,
and in that capacity he served under
several administrations without poli
tical changes. He resigned his place
in the State Department to accept the
chair of international law at Columbia
University, about three years ago, ajid
it is believed that this present ap
pointment is only temporary, owing to
his indisposition to permanently sever
his connection with Columbia. Moore
is an authority on certain branches of
international law. and his selection
will do much to strengthen the State
Department in the present emergency.
CANTON, 0., April 25.â Judge Day
reached Canton at 10:25 a. m. to-day.
He looked in g<V;d health. A corre
spondent informed him of the resigna
tion of Secretary Sherman. When
asked if he would accept the vacant
place, he replied simply: "I will take
the matter under consideration."
Whiie Judge Day declined to talk
for publication, it can be said as a
fact that under existing circumstances
Judge Day will accept the Secretary
ship if the President nominates him
and the Senate takes favorable action.
Judge Day made a great business sac
rifice when he accepted the place of
Assistant Secretary of State. He has
not felt that he could afford to take a
Cabinet portfolio, but under present
circumstances it is not believed that
he feels that he ought to decline.

ROOSEVELT TO
LEAD COWBOYS
Is Appointed Lieutenant-
Colonel of Mounted
Riflemen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, April 25.
It has been understood for some time
past that Assistant Secretary Roose
velt of the Navy Department would
soon retire in order to enter the mili
tary service in the Cuban campaign.
This story can now be confirmed posi
tively, although the time set for Mr.
Roosevelt's departure from the depart
ment is not definitely fixed. The Presi
dent to-day named Mr. Roosevelt as
lieutenant-colonel of one of the regi
ments of mounted riflemen to be raised
in the Rocky Mountains, under Colonel
Wood, whom Mr. Roosevelt has urged
for the place.
Colonel Wood is now Dr. Wood of the*
army. He won a medal for distin
guished gallantry while commanding a
detachment of regular troops during
the exceedingly hard Apache campaigns
against Geronimo. Secretary Aiger se
lected Colonel Wood and Mr. Roose
velt for these positions because he felt
that their training a^id experience in
the past peculiarly fitted them to do
g'M)<i service with a cowboy regiment.
Colonel Wood starts west to-morrow
to superintend the recruiting, many of
fers having ai ready come to Mr. Roose
velt from individuals and organizations
among the cowboys. Secretary Long
wishes Mr. Roosevelt to remain in his
present position as long as possible, so
it may be two or three weeks before
be will join his command.
The President and both secretaries
have regretted Mr. Roosevelt leaving
his present position, but they feel that
in a regiment of this character he can
do good service and should be allowed
to go, though if possible they wish him
to remain until the regiment is organ
ized and ready to take part in the in
vasion of Cuba. Before that, how
ever, he may have to leave for short
periods to superintend the enlistments.
So far the talk of a successor to Mr.
Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary has
been mere speculation, and it can be
slated positively that up to this time
the President has not made a choice of
his successor. It may Be stated. In
view of the recent mention of the name
of Admiral Walker in that connection
that as it stands the law requires the
office of Assistant Secretary to be filled
by a civilian, so that if the admiral de
sires to accept the office he would bo
under the painful necessity of resign
ing from the navy and losing his place
as a retired officer, which he is not
likely to do^

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 2G, 1898.
PLANS COMPLETED
FOR THE INVASION
OF THE ISLAND
CHATTANOOGA, April 25.â 1t is rumored hereto-night that General
Brooke has been ordered to get about 4000 men in readiness for use in
the contemplated seizure of two or three small Cuban ports in order to
establish communication with Gomez and Garcia.
NEW YORK, April 25.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald sends the following: Having practi
cally completed, so far as existing conditions will admit, offensive and defensive plans of the campaign against
Spain, the administration will now reiy upon the army and navy to carry them to a successful conclusion. Fif
teen thousand men will be landed at a port in the immediate vicinity of Havana as soon as the proper time comes
for the seizure of the city by the navy. In anticipation of orders from the department to seize the. point selected,
1 understand, Rear Admiral Sampson is making arrangements to institute a more rigid blockade and to place
within striking distance a force able to cover the landing of the two regiments of marines, which will be the first
American troops to land on Cuban soil. Once the navy is in possession of the point of attack, transports con
voyed by men-of-war will carry troops to Cuba and land them. These troops will hold the captured portsand will
supply General Gomez and his followers with an ample quantity of arms and ammunition, and the insurgents
are expected to then begin an active land campaign against General Blanco's forces.
It was in line with the navy's plan of campaign that the Columbia and Minneapolis put to sea on Saturday
from Hampton Roads. As the Herald stated this morning, their commission is of a roving character. They are
directed to proceed to sea on the lookout for Spanish men-of-war and privateers which Spain has officially
called auxiliary cruisers, and for any Spanish merchantmen which they may happen to meet. It is not expected
that they will remain on the New England coast for any length of time, but. will go to sea, dropping in at ports
alonr the coast at frequent intervals so as to be ready to join the flying squadron the moment the department
deems such action necessary. It was stated by an official with whom I talked today that the movements of the
squadron would depend upon the movements of the Spanish tleet now at St. Vincent. As soon as the department
has information of the coming of the Spanish force, I understand, it is proposed to collect the battleships and
armored cruisers of the North Atlantic squadron and of the flying squadron and to station them at a point be
tween Hampton Roads and Key West, so that they will be able to strike at Havana or at a Northern port, where
ever, in fact, the fleet may make its appearance. The smaller cruisers, gunboats and auxiliary cruisers will be
left in Cuban waters to maintain the blockade of the ports of the island.
Information obtained to-night shows that no irr.nediate bombardment of Havana Is contemplated, but the point
which will be first attacked will be that selected as the base of operations for the army. Genejal Shafter is now on
his way to Washington to confer with General Miles and ecretary Alger regarding th- f-peditioji which he will
lead to Cuta as soon as the fleet under Rear Admiral Sampson shall have opened the way for an effective land
ing. General Shafter will arrive in Washington to-morrow or the next day and after this important conference
will waste no time in returning to the gulf, where he will hold his command in readiness to obey the order, when
it shall come, to land an invading army in Cuba.
The plan of the War Department which will be disclosed to General Shafter is to land an effective force
of 15,000 regular troops at a port without the trocha and distribute arms and supplies to the insurgents under
General Gomez. Several commissaries and their employes will accompany this force and will relieve in every way
possible the starving reconcentrados.
Troops will land at a point in the vicinity of Havana and the expedition is expected to be underway early
next week. The 15,000 men to compose this command will be taken from the infantry regiments in Tampa, New-
Orleans and Mobile, and the regiment of light artillery commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lancaster, now with
General Brooke's command in Chickamauga. These regiments will be organized into three brigades under com
mand of Brigadier General Wade and the two senior colonels, of the army with the forces on the gulf, Colonels Mel
ville A. Cochran and James A. Van Buren.

At noon General Shafter received a
message from Washington calling him
to the capital for consultation with the.
War Department. He will leave to
morrow. This probably means some
important changes of the movements of
this wing of the army.

MADRID TOOK
THE INITIATIVE
Was the First to Break
Off Diplomatic Ne
gotiations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
"Washington, April 25.
The President's message recommend
ing a declaration of war was accompa
nied by ten or fifteen telegrams and
notes that passed between the govern
ments of Spain and the United States,
mainly through Minister Woodford, but
partly through Minister Polo de Ber
nabe. It is believed these papers clear
ly established the position of this Gov
ernment that Spain has recognized the
existence of a state of war. In the
correspondence accompanying the Pres
ident's message was the following tele
gram, sent on April 21, 1898, by Min
ister Woodford to Secretary Sherman:
Following is the text of ray reply to the
official note received this morning at 7:30
o'clock from the Spanish Minister of
State:
"I have the honor to acknowledge the
receipt this morning of your note of this
date informing me that the Spanish Min
ister at Washington has been ordered to
withdraw with all his legation without
loss of time from North American terri
tory. You also inform me that by this act
diplomatic relations between the two
countries are broken off; that all official
communication between their respective
representatives cease. I have, accord
ingly, this day telegraphed the American
Consul-General at Barcelona to instruct
all the Consuls of the United States in
Spain to turn their respective consulates
over to the British Consuls and to leave
Spain at once. I have myself turned this
legation over to her Britannic Majesty's
Ambassador at Madrid. The embassy
will, from this time, have the care of all
American interests in Spain. I now re
quest passports and a safe conduct to
the French frontier for myself and the
fiersonnel of this legation. 1 intend leav
ng this afternoon at 4 o'clock for Paris.
"WOODFORD."
A cablegram from Mr. Woodford to
Mr. Sherman gives the substance of
the Spanish note, as follows:
UNITED STATES LEGATION, MA
DRID, April 21.â Following is the text of
the official note received at 7:30 o'clock
from the Spanish Minister of State:
"In compliance with a painful duty. I
have the honor to inform your excellency
that the President having approved a
resolution of both chambers of the United
States, which, in denying the legitimate
sovereignty of Spain and threatening an
Immediate armed intervention in Cuba
is equivalent to an evident declaration of
war, the Government of his Majesty has
ordered its Minister in Washington to
withdraw without loss of time from the
North American territory with all the
personnel of the legation. By this act
spent several hours in consultation with
Inspector-General H. W. Lawton, and
Colonel J. W. Sully, quartermaster.
. Owing to the wreck on the Southern
Pacific near El Paso, Texas, in which
two cars of the third section carrying
the First Regiment of Infantry from
the Presidio, California, were derailed
and wagons scattered all over the prai
rie, the arrival here of the First Reg
iment has been delayed twenty-four
hours. It will get in to-morrow night,
being due in Houston to-morrow at 10
o'clock a. rii." Genern.l Shafter and his
staff are considerably worried over this
delay. The First Regiment is beina:
carried on these special trains and at 4
o'clock this afternoon had arrived at
Del Rio, Texas, which is 160. miles west
of San Antonio.
Two batteries of the Third Artillery
from San Francisco, occupying twenty
four cars and made up of eight officers
and 164 men, were landed at Morgan
Ferry station to-night at 9 o'clock. This
was a very heavy train and consisted
of seven combination cars, filled with
horses, one car of harness, two flatcars
of guns, two boxcars of rations, one
fruitcar of baggage, one sleeper and
seven second-class coaches.
the diplomatic relations which previously
existed between the two countries are
broken, off. all official communication be
tween their respective representatives
censing, and 1 hasten to communicate
this to your excellency in order that on
your part you may make such disposition
as seems suitable. I beg your excellency
to kindly acknowledge receipt of this
note and I ask it myself, etc."
WOODFORD.
Other correspondence is as follows:
On April 14 Secretary Sherman noti
fied Mr. Wood ford of the passage in the
House the previous day of the Cuban
resolutions and of the reporting to the
Senate of the resolutions from the For
eign Relations Committee. On that
day Secretary Sherman wired:
Ultimate resolution in conference can
not now be forecasted, but will doubtless
direct intervention by force if need be. to
secure free Cuba. The situation is moat
critical.
On April 20 Secretary Sherman tele
graphed Mr. Woodford the ultimatum
heretofore published. On the same
date Secretary Sherman sent the fol
lowing to the Spanish Minister:
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 20.
Sir: I have the honor to communicate
to you a copy of an instruction sent this
day to the United States Minister at Ma
drid, by telegraph, In obedience to a joint
resolution of the Congress of the United
States of America, in relation to the pa
cification of the Island of Cuba, approved
this date, of which a copy is hereto an
nexed. I avail myself of this opportuni
ty to repeat to you the assurances of my
highest consideration.
JOHN SHERMAN.
On April 20 Secretary Sherman wired
Minister Woodford the following:
Senor Polo de Bemabe, Spanish Minis
ter to the United States, upon being in
formed shortly before noon to-day of the
action of this Government, taken in pur
suance of the resolution of Congress on
April 19. IS9S. has asked for his passports
for himself, his family and suite. They
have been handed him with assurances
of safely while within the territory of the
United States. Unless previously handed
your passports, you will be expected to
remain near the court or Spain until Sat
urday noon of this week, and unless by
that date and hour some communication
is received from the Government of Spain
which you deem will be satisfactory to
this Government, you are to ask for your
passports and safe conduct.
SHERMAN.
At 9 o'clock on the following day Mr.
Woodford sent his reply to Secretary
Sherman, already published, announc
ing the action of the Spanish Govern
ment before he had communicated the
ultimatum.
With the correspondence are the two
proclamations of President McKinley,
one foi- the blockade of Cuban ports
and the other calling for 125,000 volun
teers.
ROBBEftS ATTACK CHINESE.
They Tie Them to a Fence With
Their Queues.
Two Chinese, one of them giving the
name of Kow Tow. reported to the police
last evening that they had been held up
by a gang of rough looking characters
while driving along Mission road early
in the evening. After they had received
a severe beating at the hands of tho
highwaymen they were robbod and af
terward tied to a neighboring fence by
their queues. They were found in this
condition by a gardener in the neighbor
hood, who advised them to report tho
matter to the police. Detectives have
been detailed on the case.
The Arizona cavalry lrom Fort Hua
chuca, Arizona, filling twenty carfe ....d
making up a special train, wem
brought in at noon over the Southern
Pacific. They left immediately for
Chickamauga. Just after daylight this,
morning Battery K. Light Artillery,
from Galveston was hurried through to
Chickamauga. There were eight offi
cers and 164 men.
Major Quinn issued an official circu
lar to-da-<' announcing that submarine
mines had been placed in the Missis
sippi River and that, no vessel would
be allowed to pass Forts Jackson and
St. Phillip between the hours of sun
set and sunrise. During these hours
vessels must not approach within three
miles of the forts. This announcement
is equivalent to the closing of all water
communication with New Orleans, and
the city is now under military defenso.
The mules and horses taken from the
Spanish steamer Miguel Jover before
sailing from this port were sold at pub
lic auction to-day. Collector Wilker
son, although he took no official action,
believed to the last that this stock was
the property of the Spanish and that it
was really entitled to confiscation by
the. United States Government.
COAL FAMINE
IS PREDICTED
San Francisco May Find
, Itself Short on
Fuel.
SEATTLE, April 25.â C0al and wheat
are closely linked in the present war
emergency, and the effect will send
prices skyward. As California has
shipped her wheat to England she is
looking to the several millions of bush
els stored in the elevators in Washing
ton State to supply her trade. There
is also a heavy demand here for ex
port to the Orient and an equally strong
desire on the part of millers for our
wheat. All this has a tendency to ran
up the prices.
A rise in price of coal is more than
a possibility, and should coal be de
clared a contraband of war, subject to
seizure in neutral bottoms, the situa
tion could not fail to be an interesting
one. San Francisco has purchased its
coal in England, Scotland, Wales and
Australia and its American coal has
been sent largely from Puget Sound,
with a modicum from Coos Bay. The
Welsh miners struck on April 9 and a
threatened strike among the Australian
coal miners complicates the situation.
There can hardly fail to be a coal fam
ine in San Francisco.
C. J. Smith, general manager of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, has
received reliable advices from San
Francisco that there would be a short
age. There is a scarcity of coal in
Chinese and Japanese waters and this
condition has raised freight rates in
some cases 25 shillings. This will have
the effect of diverting Australian car
goes to China and Japan instead of
bringing them to Sa:i Francisco, and in
this the association of coal and wheat
is again brought out.
English bottoms with general cargoes
have sailed for the far east. From
China and Japan they have gone light
or in ballast to Australia, At Australia
they have taken coal cargoes for San
Francisco and after discharging at the
last named port they have chartered
for the United Kingdom in wheat.
The diversion of coal carrying from
Australia to San Francisco to the bet
ter paying voyages of Australia to
China and Japan will create a scarcity
of Australian coal in California and a
consequent increase in the demand for
other coal to supply the deficiency.
Mr. Smith said that the present out
put of coal from the Newcastle and
Franklin mines of the Pacific Coast
Company was about 30.000 tons a
month. Speculators had approached
him. asking for options on coal, which
he had refused.
FIFTY NEW
GENERALS TO
BE CHOSEN
Veteran Leaders Will Be
Commissioned by the
President.
Men Whose Names Already Figure
in History Who Will Command
Brigades and Army Corps
of Volunteers.
NEW YORK, April 25.â A Washing- :
ton special to the Herald says: Ten I
major-generals and forty brigadier- ;
generals will be appointed by the Pres- !
ident to command the brigades, divis- j
ions and corps into which the volunteer j
army of 125,000 men is to be organ
ized. Applications and recommenda
tions for these positions have kept the
War Department busy since the an
nouncement of the call by the Presi
dent's proclamation. President Me- j
Kinley will send to the Senate at an
early date the appointments of brigade,
division and corps officers to be as
signed to the volunteer forces. There
will be, when the organization of regu
lars and militia is completed, four army
corps of 40,000 men each, and the ap
pointments to command these corps
will be the most important at the Pres
ident's disposal.
General Greenville M. Dodge will re
ceive one of these appointments. The !
New York volunteers, probably under '
Major-General Roe, will constitute one
of the divisions of his command. Gen
eral Fitzhugh Lee will command a cor
responding organization, which will
include the troops to be raised in the
Southern States. The other corps com- |
manders will probably be selected from !
the senior brigadier-generals from the
regular army.
It is presumed that Brigadier-Gen- |
erals Shafter, Wade and Coppinger are |
amcmg those selected for the advance
ment to the rank of major-general of i
volunteers, as they have already com- â 
mands commensurate with that rank.
General Elwell S. Otis, whose tour of I
court-martial duty is completed to-day, [
is the ranking brigadier-general in the i
regular army, and is considered the !
most eligible for a corps commander.
Officers c-f the regular army whose
names have been recommended by Sec- j
retary Alger or the Governors of States
for the rank of brigadier-general in the
militia are: Colonels Carpenter, Fifth
Cavalry; Anderson, Fourteenth Infan
thry; Rogers, Fifth Artillery; Lawton I
and Chaffee, inspector-general's de
partment; Ludlow, engineers'; Davis, j
Fourteenth Infantry; Henry, Tenth
Cavalry; rich wan, Gilmore and Mac- |
arthur, adjutant-general's department; !
Sumner, Sixth Cavalry.
The quotas of Arizona, Idaho, Wyom- j
ing, Utah, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Ne- j
vada, the Dakotas and Montana will
be formed into two regiments of cow- j
boy cavalry. One of these will be com
manded by the president's physician,
Dr. Leonard Wood, a captain in the
medical corps of the army. Tneodore
Roosevelt will serve as the lieutenant
colonel of this regiment. The com
mand of the other regiment of "rang
ers," as they are to be called, Is to be
tendered to Colonel Torrey of Wyom
ing, at one time a captain in the reg-
ular army.
Captain Charles King, formerly an
officer in the army, and better known
as a novelist, was in consultation with
Generals Miles and Corbin at the War
Department this afternoon. It is un
derstood that Captain King will be the
brigadier-general of Wisconsin's quota
of three regiments. Colonel Jfe-ed Grant
has been frequently at the War De
partment in the last week. He will
receive the first appointment as brig
adier-general of the New York volun
teers.
William F. Cody, "Buffalo Bill," will
serve on the staff of Major-General
Miles aa chief of scouts and will have
the rank of colonel of volunteers.
Illinois and Texas have each been al
lotted a full regiment of cavalry. The
Texas volunteers will be used to oc
cupy the posts left vacant by the reg
ulars and will form the guard for the
Rio Grande border. John A. Logan
will by a recommendation of Governor
Tanner command the regiment to be
raised in Illinois.
Colonel Garrason, a West Point grad
uate and president of the First Na
tional Bank of Cleveland, will be the
senior brigadier-general from Ohio.
Mr. Wedd Hayes, son of former Pres
ident Hayes, who has been connected
with the Ohio National Guard and who
represented that organization in Wash
ington during the last two weeks, will
be one of the ranking line officers of
Ohio's quota.
J. Warren Keifer, formerly a major
general in the Civil War and after
ward Speaker of the United States
House of Representatives, will com
mand the division to be composed of
Ohio and Indiana volunteers.
General Joseph F. Wheeler will be
the first officer of the United State?
Representatives to hold a high com
mand in the provisional service. He
will command a division to be raised
in the Southern States, with the rank of
major-general.
Colonel Adams of Lnfnyptte Post of
the Grand Army is strongly recom
mended to the President by Colonel J.
Pierpont Morgan and other influen
tial business men in New York City and
will be appointed as brigadier-general
of one of the brigades of New York's
quota,
DOUBT THAT THE KEY
WEST CABLE WAS CUT.
Washington Officials Ha-.e Heard
Nothing Regarding the Man-
grove's Action.
WASHINGTON. April 25.â N0-thing
is known at the Navy Department of
the reported cutting of the cable con
necting Cuba with Key West by the
Mangrove ten miles out at sea. There
is a great deal of doubt as to the ac
curacy of the report, and it is believed
that the most that has been done in
that direction has been the tapping of
the cable for strategic purposes.
The United States is a party to the
convention which binds all the signa
tories, most of the marine powers of
the world, to refrain from interference
with cables in the event of war. Perry
Belmont, while chairman of the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs, labor
ed to this end for several years, and
finally succeeded in having the United
States sign the agreement.
A naval officer of high rank, when
questioner! on the subject to-day, re
marked that almost all agreements are
suspended by war when they injure tha
interests of one of the combatants and
favor the other. The cable connecting
with Madrid would be a most powerful
assistance to the Spanish cause just
now, and would work equal injury to
us, wherefore, said the officer, a prudent
naval commander doubtless would cut
the cable first and let the diplomats
talk about it afterward.
RETIRED OFFICER
WANTS TO SERVE.
PETALUMA, April 25.â The news of
the declaration of war caused great ex
citement in this city. By prearranged
signals every church and fire beli and
every steam whistle in the city were
turned loose, making a terrific din.
Flags were hoisted on every flag pole
in the city and the streets were soon
filled with excited citizens, who eagerly
inquired the cause of the demonstra
tion. Many people thought it was a
call to arms for the militia, and the
boys of Company C flocked to the
armory, while their frightened rela
tives made hurried preparations to get
the necessary articles of clothing ready
for the soldiers.
Many ranchers hurriedly drove in
from the country. The clamor of bell
and shriek of whistle could be heard at
Lakeville, eight miles south of this
city.
Company C is prepared for action and
is ready to go whenever called upon.
To-day a large number of young men
enlisted.
MONTEREY, Cal.. April 25.âLieuten
ant Lasher, I*. S. N., retired, who re
sides at this place, has become restive
under inaction during the present sit
uation, and is eager to take a hand in
the trouble. Lieutenant Lasher is still
a young man, having been retired from
active service because of physical in
juries received about eighteen months
ago, and he feels that he could effec
tively command a division of the Na
val Reserves. He has offered himself
in that capacity to the Monterey di
vision of Naval Reserves, and will
take command as soon as his offer is
formally accepted by the battalion.
SACRAMENTO. April 26.âConsider
able enthusiasm was developed upon
receipt of the President's message here.
All the whistles in town were blown
and bells were rung. In the evening a
national salute of 100 guns was fired in
Capitol Park, and the water works
whistle was blown for a ha4,f hour.
Company G, Second Infantry. N. G. C,
held a meeting, at which forty-seven
out of its sixty-three men offered to go
to the front as United States volun
teers.
SANTA BARBARA, April 25.âCiti
zens met in mass-meettng to-night in
Armory Hall and organized four com
panies of home guards. These com
panies have elected captains and will
be drilled by J. B. Hardy, an old
United States soldier. Citizens are
making every effort to put Santa Bar
bara in a safe state of defense.

Sp^lal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 25.â The Los
AntrÂ»'l> s City 'Water Company has at
lost shown its hand, and with the ex
position has come a revelation which
simply verities the prophecy made by
The Call la the early days of January,
and which is nothing more nor less than
a petition to the City Council for an
extension <>f its franchise. At the time
the prophecy was made it was ridiculed
by !!:â¢ Times, Herald and Express,
men. hers nf the water company's krcal
syndicated dailies, but time has shown
that The Call's prophecy was correct
and that it was simply warning the
ihis city, 95 per cent of whom
favor municipal ownership, of what
they might â¢ xpect when the water com
panj ; its hand. As stated by
the watt-r company's* officials, the prop
osition made to tho City Council to-day
Is like this:
An option was taken by New York,
London and Berlin capitalists several
; only on the plant of the
water company, but also upon every
other Bource of domestic water supply
within a radius of several miles. Ne
gotiations have gone so far thai a prop
osition Is ready to be made to the city
by the promoters. The terms of the
proposition are such as in compel a
thorough investigation by the Council.
It embraces in its details free water for
sprinkling, fire hydrant, public school
and other municipal purposes and a
guarantee of pure mountain water for
domestic use. In return, the promoters
request a franchise
for twenty or Jiirty years, with a guar
of a fair percentage to be paid
into the city treasury of its total gross
ta every year.
The promoters reason that under
their offer they turn into the city treas
ury not less than (40,000 a year from
the start, in cash. So far as rates for
are concerned, they say, they can
s be regulated by the Council un
â¢he Stale law, as is done at
pi â¢ sent.
The local agent for the big syndicate
ut the head of the proposed new deal
is the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank.
Experts, engineering and otherwise,
from New York and Europe have been
several days thoroughly in
vestigating the new proposition and
rted to the principals its ab
solute safety from a financial stand
point. Their report has been that the
g for municipal ownership is not
so deep-rooted as has been made to

of public sentiment it can be wiped out

KEY WEST, Fla., April 25.â Captain
Milburn of the British ship Myrtledene
was arrested in Havana, kept as a pris
oner in Morro Castle for three hours
and sentenced to be shot an hour later.
General Blanco discovered within the
fat;U hour that he was a British Bub-
Ject Arthur Arosteguy, the British
Vice-Consul, made a demand that he
be released and the order of execution
w;is not carried out.
Captain Milburn arrived here with
his :~l)i[) to-day. He sailed from Phiki
hia April S, and reached Havana
a week ago yesterday. After Captain
Milburn h;Â«<l discharged his cargo he
went ashore to take a walk. He vis
it* <i the fortifications at Casa Blanea
and while moving about was confront
ed by B squad of Spanish soldiers with
Axed bayonets, who at once arrested
him a? a spy of the United Stat~~ They
took him to Morro. Here he was kept
In â¢ cell for three hours. Then he was
told to l<e prepared to be shot in an
hour.
"What's thp use of waiting an hour?"
he asked. "Why don't you shoot me
now? Go ahead and do it, and in a
few days Havana and all Cuba will bo
blown up. England does .not wait two
months when one of her ships is blown
up in a port of another country."
Then -Mr. Arosteguy interfered and
he was set free. He sailed from Ha
vana Friday night, just as the Ameri
can fleet was coming into sight. Mr.
Arosteguy sent his family to Key West
on the ship. Captain Milburn had in
tended to take on sugar in Havana, the
property of Mr. Revest, an American,
but he was advised to leave Havana
promptly. :.. r

Spanish Gunboats May Be
Sent Alter Klondike
Craft
Rich Hauls Expected When the
Season's Gold Is Sent
Down.
Steamship Companies Petition for
Guns With Which to Resist
Attack.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 25. â From two
sources the report has reached Puget
Sound that the Spanish officials at
Manila had decided weeks ago to send
Beveral gunboats to the shores of
Alaska parly this summer if war broke
out. The purpose of these gunboats
would be to seize Klondike treasure
boats which .'ire expected to leave St.
Michael for Puget Sound early In July.
The steamer Braemar brings news
that such report was current at Hong
kong last month. This is corro
borated by the arrival at Whatcom of
a lumber vessel from Manila, via
Japan, whose captain says he heard
the story on the Asiatic coast. This
navigator declines to permit the use of
his name, as he expects soon to re
turn to Oriental waters.
The Spanish apparently intend to
send two or three of the five gun
bdata now at Manila, the Argos, El
cano, Gen. Lezo, Marques del Duero
and Valaseo. Those sent across the
Pacific will be accompanied by trans
ports carrying coal. If successful
they will add from ten to fifteen mil
lion's in gold to the Spanish exchequer,
besides capturing several fine vessels.
The Alaska steamship companies do
not intend any such plot shall sue
t L General Manager Pingree of
the Boston and Alaska Steamship
Company has wired to Secretary of
the Navy Long requesting a half
dozen gatling guns for his steamer
Brixham, which will leave next week
for Hooper Bay, returning in time to
get an early start for St. Michael.
Members of Plngree's company in
New York and Boston stand close to
the Cuban leaders, who have also no
tified them that the Spanish would be
more than likely to attempt seizing
Klondike steamers.
The other treasure-ghips this year,
so far a.s known, will be the North
American Transportation and Trad
ing Company's steamer Roanoke and
the Alaska Commercial Company .
steamer Portland. Shipping men say
these companies will undoubtedly
make similar requests for guns from
the Government, citing the fact that a
Maxim gun was mounted on the
steamer Portland last summer when
the danger was not one-tenth as great
as now.

NEVADA CITY. April 25.â This has
been a day of little work and much
play for the Native Sons who are as
sembled here to. attend the session of
the Grand Parlor. This rule, however,
does not apply to those among the del
egates who. are candidates for election
or those who were interested in select
ing the meeting place for the next an
nual session. For them the day has
been all work and no play, and much
friendly rivalry was manifested by the
representatives from those towns that
made a bid for the next Grand Parlor.
Marysville, Oroville and Salinas were
the most prominent candidates for the
honor, the contest between the first
named two being particularly sharp.
The Oroville boomers had been indus
trious in the distribution of cards upon
which appear a golden bear and the
following appropriate effort at poetry.:
"Argonaut, Argonaut, Parlor Eight, â 
Headquarters Oroville, Golden State,.
Wants Grand Parlor in '.99.
Bet you'll think it's '49."
And their rivals from Marysville were
equally assiduous, their efforts being
mainly directed to the distribution of
buttons on which appeared an inscrip
tion intended to define the partisanship
of the wearer.
Fred Greely of Marysville and Past
Grand President A. F. Jones of Oro-
ville were the leaders of the rival fac
tions, a fact that led to-day to an at
tempt on the part of Frank Johnston
of Sacramento, who, beside being State
Printer, Is also a native son with a
touch of sporting blood in his veins, to
get the rivals together in a five-round
contest, the loser to retire from the field
without prejudice. The attempt failed
because each of the principals demand
ed that the other go and get a repu
tation before attempting a contest for
championship honors.
In the meantime P. E. Zabala and
L. U. Grant of Salinas were congratu
lating themselves with the assurance
that while Marysville and Oroville were
cutting each other's throats Salinas
would walk off with the prize. Their
predictions were fulfilled. Salinas get
ting about two-thirds of the total vote
cast.
And it was on account of this con
test for the meeting place of the next
Grand Parlor that Arthur North of
Yolo â "Kid" North, he used to be called
in the Assemblyâ is just now in deep
mourning. Yesterday he was ap
proached by several Oroville boomers
who asked him to aid them in their
fight.
"Awfully sorry," North would reply,
"but, you see, I was born in Marys
ville, and a fellow can't go back on his
birthplace, you know."
This morning the Marysville contin
gent called on North In a body.
"See here, North," demanded the
spokesman, "we understand that you
are telling araund that you were born
in Marysville. Now, we don't want to
say anything that will hurt your feel
ings, but if it's just the same to you,
would you mind keeping mum about
your birthplace until this fight is over?
We don't want delegates prejudiced
against the town."
North is a candidate for a place on
the board of grand trustees, his gen
eral popularity making him a formid
able rival for some of the older mem
bers of the order.
Joseph K. Hawkins of Pacific Parlor
No. 10 is a candidate for re-election as
grand trustee. His brother. Coroner
Hawkins, is assisting him in his can
vass. Joseph F. Coffey of Redw<-od
Parlor No. 66, Louis F. Byington of Nl
antic Parlor No. 105, Frank Sabichi of
Ramona Parlor No. 109, F. A. Cutler of
Humboldt Parlor No. 14 and H. R. Mc-
Noble of Stockton Parlor No. 7 are all
members of the present board of grand
trustees, and all are candidates for re
election. J. i-^- O'Donnell of Yerba
Buena Parlor is making a strong fight
for a place on the new board. He has
a host of friends and will make a
strong run.
Another formidable candidate is
David Morgan of Hydraulic Parlor No.
56. He has for many years been a
prominent figure in the supreme legis
lative body of the order, and it is more
than likely that his nomination will be
followed by his election, partly out of
recognition of his merit and partly be
cause it would be a timely acknowl
edgment of the hospitality of the local
parlor. : â¢
There was for a time some talk of
putting Morgan forward as a candidate
for grand orator, b-- 1 this was aban
doned because of the general impres
sion that . this honor . should fall to
Frank L. Coombs, the present chair
man of the board of grand trustees.
Coombs' election is looked upon as cer
tain. .
Another promising candidate for
grand trustee is Charles R. Heverin of
San Francisco Parlor No. 49. He has a
strong following and will be heard from
at the finish.
L. K. Hagencamp of Rincon Parlor
No. 72 has announced his candidacy for
the position of grand outside sentinel.
George H. D. Dryden is assisting him
in his contest for the place.
ft having been decided that the 9th of
September celebration is to be held at
San Jose, the election of Dr. W. A. Gas
ton of that city to the position of grand
marshal is practically assured.
Judge. Frank Kerrigan met an experi
ence this morning that has since cost
him much agony of mind because the
affair, assumed the nature of a practi
cal joke at which all of his friends con
sider themselves privileged to laugh.
The proprietor of one of the stores in
the center of town has a tame pelican
that spends the better part of the aay
on the sidewalk in front of the store.
Kerrigan was passing with some
friends and stopped to admire the
."Hrange bird, which was apparently
asleep. Being anxious to arouse it into
a state of activity and not wishing to
risk his fingers, the Judge unthinklngly
took out his pocket-book and poked at
the bird. Like a flash the bird's great
bill opened and closed on the pocket
book and in another moment it had
passed from view into the capacious
maw of the fo .i.
Here was a dilemma. Kerrigan
opened negotiations for the purchase of
the bird, but its owner refused to sell
except for cash. As the bird had Ker
rigan's cash the deal fell through. It
was finally decided to place the bird in
close confinement, the key to the cage
being given into the keeping of a third
party selected by mutual agreement.
Pending developments the Judge is de
pending upon the charity of a host of
sympathetic friends.
At this morning's session of the
Grand Parlor the following resolution,
which was introduced by Grand Trustee
Joseph F. Coffey, was adopted:
Whereas, the Almighty, in his immut
able wisdom, has taken unto himself to
the heavenly parlor on high, while in
the viÂ£f>r of youth and manhood, our
beloved brother and former member of
the Grand Parlor, W. P. McEvoy; and,
whereas, his death was the result of
heroic conduct In the performance of offi
cial duties as Sheriff of San Mateo
County.
Resolved, That in his demise the peo
ple of San Mateo County have lost a
true, tried and brave officer, the Native-
Sons of the Golden West an earnest and
zealous brother who was always alive to
our cardinal principles of friendship, loy
alty and charity, and who constantly la
bored for the welfare anil promotion of
the best interests of our fraternity.
Resolved, That we deeply sympathize
with his widow and the members of his
family in his sad and untimely taking off.
and sincerely regret the loss occasioned
thereby t<> Redwood Parlor, and the order
at large, as also to the people of San
Mateo County.
Resolved, That a copy of these reso
lutions be forward. d CO Redwood Parlor,
another to the widow of the deceased,
another to the Golden State for publica
tion, and that a sin. ar copy be spread
at length upon the minutes of the Grand
Parlor: and
Resolved. That when this Grand Par
lor adjourns to-day it do so out of re
spect to his memory.
This evening the delegates and their
friends and as many townspeople as
could be accommodated assembled at
Armory Hall to witness the presenta
tion by the' Mayor of the key of the city
to Grand President Clarke. The p â >â¢>- j
sentation ceremonies were followed by
a promenade ami Informal dance.
To-morrow's programme includes a
visit by the visiting delegates to the
gre ( at Malakoff hydraulic mine, near
North Bloomfield. In the evening the
Curly Bear Degree will be conferred on
candidates.
PROMISE OF GOOD CROPS.

pleted his regular inspection of orchards

the frosts of March. Apricots and pc-ach.s
are the greatest sufferers from this frost,
the apple* and pears having been scarcely
touched.

W. A. Nolan Arrested at
the Instance of a
Creditor.
Left Town Immediately After
Disposing of His
Interests.
Captured at Napa Junction While
Boarding a Train for San
Franeibco.
Special Dlsnatch to The Call.
NAPA, April 25.â C. L. James, late of
the firm of James & Son, hardware
merchants of this place, to-day brought
suit against W. A. Nolan of this city
and h:.d Nolan arrested for attempting
to leave the State for the alleged pur
pose of defrauding his creditors.
In December of last year Nolan &
Fraser of Oakland bought the business
of James & So.n of this city, giving in
payment their joint note. Later Fraser
sold his interest to Nolan and Nolan
became indebted to James individually.
To-day Nolan sold to Young & Barker
and promised an early settlement with
James. From previous conversations
had by James with Nolan James had
reason to believe that Nolan was about
to leave the State. Nolan has stated
that he expected to go East and accept
a position at $3 a day and afterward
said that if he could not secure that
position he expected to go to the Klon
dike.
James had an appointment this morn
ing with Nolan with the object in view
of bringing about a settlement of the
indebtedness. Nolan did not keep his
engagement and subsequent inquiries
developed the fact that he had left
town.
James had the necessary papers
drawn and placed in the hands of the
proper officers. Sheriff McKenzie saw
Nolan's wife leave Napa on the after
noon San Francisco train, but did not
see Nolan. The Sheriff proceeded on
the- south-bound train. At Napa Junc
tion Nolan got on and was promptly
arrested by the Sheriff and brought
back to Napa late this evening. Up to
a late hour he had not obtained the
necessary bail to avoid going to jail.
Nolan is about 30 years of age.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 25.â The officials of
the British Foreign Office expect that
the London Gazette, official organ of
the Government, will publish to-mor
row an official notice to the effect that
belligerent warships of Spain and the
United States must lea-ve within twen
ty-four hours. The document, it is said,
is long and complicated. It contains
clauses covering the case of vessels
which are unable to leave in the stipu
lated time owing to defects. The au
thorities of the British ports have al
ready been notified that the order is to
be published.
The officials of the United States em
bassy fear the United States torpedo
boat Somers, now at Falmouth, is des
tined to remain in England for some
time to come as the neutrality procla
mation will be issued to-morrow and
no convoy for the little craft, without
which it is impossible for her to attempt
to cross the Atlantic, has been secured.
The United States embassy was crowd
ed to-day with ship brokers, negotia^.
tions being on foot to purchase, in be
half of the United States, some British
ships which are now in American ports.
The Spanish Embassador, Count Ras
â con, has intimated to Embassador Hay
that he is issuing a statement to the
newspapers, setting forth that the Em
bassador of Spain is not authorized to
make enlistments. There is evidence,
however, that the Spanish authorities
here are endeavoring to secure engi
neers, in spite of the foreign enlistment
act. Cononel Hay concludes the mat
ter is too small game to warrant him
in protesting to the British foreign of
fice, unless it assumes larger propor
tions, but the British authorities may
act on their own initiative.
The report is circulated In the United
States that the British Consul at Ha
vana had cabled the foreign office, not
ifying the authorities here that Ha
vana would be bombarded is incorrect.
What he cabled was that he expected
Havana would be bombarded.

PROMPT WAR BULLETINS.
THE plague of fake extras which for some days
ha- tormented San Francisco will soon be over.
That scheme of working the unwary for nickels
and increasing a show of circulation cann* t be oper
ated successfully in the face of the enterprise of The
Call in issuing bulletins of the events of the war as
rapidly as. the dispatches are received and posting
them at The Call office, at all the agencies of The
Call throughout the city and at other notable points
where the people are accustomed to assemble.
This bulletin service is far superior to anything the
fakers can accomplish by their extras. The dispatches
follow one another as fast as events of note occur.
Printed on a special press set aside for that purpose
by The Call and carried by messenger boys on
bicycles to the places where they are to be posted and
there displayed for all to read, they constitute a con
tinuous record of the war. By this service the people
are informed at once of every new phase of the situa
tion. They are saved from the petty deception.; of the
fake extras, which have been so common for some
time past and which before the appearance of thi*
service threatened to continue as long as the war
itself.
Moreover, <uir bulletin service is not only prompt
but accurate. (.The Call, in alliance with the New
\ ork Herald, long ago made preparations for report
ing the war in case it broke out. A host of corre
spondents located at points scattered all over the
West Indies are at work gathering news. Additional
correspondents are with the army and the navy.
Every detail of the situation is covered. The Call
therefore does not have to publish fakes and rumors
for the sake of making a show of war news. It gets
the news itself and gets it promptly.
This accurate and comprehensive news service it
now nukes free to all San Francisco and to a hun
dred other points in California, Nevada and Arizona.
The issuing oj extras is an out of date scheme. It is
behind the times. It has been left to the fakers.
Legitimate journalism in the progress of enterprise
has gone forward and bulletins the news at once for
all to read free of charge.
Announcement is made that the vacations of many
New Yorkers have been upset by the war. This is
truly to be regretted, and adds much to the horrors
of the situation. However, the New Yorkers are in
a measure to blame. In the rush of events the coun
try overlooked the prospective vacations until too
late. Had attention been called to it in time the
United States could have sent an apology to Spain
tmd not spoiled the fun. But there is nothing to hin
der the Xevv Yorker from having an outing yet.
Many as good a man will shoulder a rifle and exploit
Cuba. If the New Yorker happens to be of th. other
Bex a little Red Cross work might cause her to forget
how cruelly fate has flouted her.
One of the news-gathering fleet of the Call-Herald
is the ocean-going steamer Tyr, flying the Danish
flag. Under these colors she will be free from moles
tation by any of the ships engaged in fighting either
for this country or for Spain. This is an advantage
of which Call readers will have the benefit. Intima
tions are already strong that the flock of boats which
put out from American ports after the squadrons of
Sampson and Schley will be chased away. From such
treatment as this the Tyr will be exempt.
Without desiring to hurt the feelings of the Euro
pean editors it may be remarked that the "tone" they
may assume is not regarded here as a matter of im
portance. They may shriek or growl, but the little
fight now on concerns mostly people who do not
send abroad for their advice. Why, there is more
advice right at home than can be utilized.
Statements concerning the movements of the Span
ish fleet from Cape Verde Islands may be boiled
down to two unassailable propositions. Any geo
graphy will show that there are such islands, and
some place or other there is a fleet. To be more
specific than this is to court the possibility of error.
Let there be a hope that Captain Sigsbee will de
cline to fight the Spaniard who has challenged him.
But if the captain get near enough the fellow to ad
minister a kick and neglect the opportunity he must
expect the high regard in which he is now held to be
somewhat impaired.
Although there has now been a formal declaration
of war keen observers had already noted a lack of
vigor about the entente cordiale between the United
States and Spain.
If Mr. McKinley wants any more volunteers all
he has to do is to ask for them.
Congressman Maguire has said little lately, but
even at this he has said too much.
WOR AND COMMERCE.
BY royal decree the Spanish Government has
given notice to the world that during the
course of the war with the United States Spain
will observe the declarations of the treaty of Paris
that neutral flags cover an enemy's merchandise ex
cept contraband of war. and that neutral merchandise,
except contraband of war, is not seizable under an
enemy's flag; that the Spanish Government will as
sert and exercise the right of search of vessels on the
high seas to determine whether they carry contraband
goods, and finally that Spain, while maintaining the
right to issue letters of marque to privateers, will
for the present at any rate confine herself to organiz
ing out of her mercantile marine a force of auxiliary
cruisers to co-operate with the navy in carrying on
the war.
The course taken by the United States will not be
essentially different from that promulgated by Spain.
The announcement made some time ago that the
United States would not issue letters of marque was
effectually refuted in the Senate last week by the
statement of Senator Davis, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, that he had heard of no such
declaration on the part of the administration. As a
matter of fact the question is one which Congress
must decide upon, for the authority to grant letters
of marque lies with that body and not with the Presi
dent.
In addition to the nncertain attitude of both com
batants toward the problem of privateering there is
a further confusion for commercial interests in the
fact that differences of international law exist as to
what will constitute contraband of war. Each Gov
ernment will determine for itself what articles it shall
treat as contraband. Goods that an American ship
might pass over may be made subject to seizure by
Spain, and on the other hand our ships may con
demn articles the Spanish would pass.
All of these things will complicate the risks of com
merce while war lasts, and if it be prolonged to an
extent that embitters both parties, it may lead to ex
treme acts of search and capture on the seas that will
be regarded by neutral nations as violations of their
rights. In this there lies a danger that some other
nation may be drawn into the conflict, just as Great
Britain was very nearly drawn into our Civil War by
the capture of Slidell and Mason.
Fortunately the probability of such an outcome is
slight. The great nations of Europe have too many
antagonisms among themselves to enter lightly upon
a war with the United States. Moreover, the war may
be short. Commercialism is a very powerful factor
in the world, and, while it was not able to prevent
the outbreak of hostilities, it may prove sufficiently
potent to force the Spanish Government alter a short
conflict to retire the Spanish flag from this hemis
phere and put an end to a struggle that wastes her
treasures and brings her nearer and nearer to inevit
able bankruptcy and the ruin of her creditors.
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.
THE question whether the proposed charter or
any portion of it is unconstitutional will prob
ably not greatly interest the general reader.
But it may. nevertheless, answer a useful purpose to
call the attention of the lawyers who lately served
the people as Freeholders to a few "points" in that
connection. The time for defending the charter is
rapidly approaching. The burden of this defense is
upon the lawyers who framed it. If they cannot
demonstrate that the instrument will stand the test
of the Supreme Court they ought not to ask people
to vote for it.
Among the constitutional amendments of 1896
there was one which changed section 6 of article 11
by providing that "all charters framed or adopted by
authority of this constitution, except in municipal
affairs, shall be subject to and controlled by general
laws." The question is. what are general laws and
what are municipal affairs. In the case of Morton
vs. Broderick, Auditor, decided in October last, the
Supreme Court held that the statute of 1897 requiring
the Mayor's signature to a tax levy is unconstitu
tional because it interfered with a "municipal affair."
This was equivalent to deciding that passing a tax
levy in a city is peculiarly a municipal function. This
is as far as the court has gone in defining the words
"municipal affairs."
The charter sets up a new method for levying and
collecting taxes in which it authorizes the Board of
Supervisors to impose penalties for delinquency. It
furthermore revives the personal property collection
system abolished four years ago, and repeals the
provisions of the Political Code on that subject. Is
this constitutional? Can the charter provide its own
system of levying and collecting taxes in defiance of
the State law? In other words, are the revenue laws
of the State such general laws as are not covered by
the amendment of 1896 concerning municipal affairs?
The proposed charter also provides a system of
granting street railway franchises which is in conflict
with the statute of 1897 on the s^me subject. The
question here again recurs, is the act of selling fran
chises a "municipal affair" upon which the city may
legislate for itself? If not, the provisions of sections
6 and 7 of chapter 2, article 2, are unconstitutional.
Section 8 of The same chapter and article limits
the time within which actions for damages may be
brought against the city to six months. Section 340
of the Code of Civil Procedure fixes the time for
commencing actions for damages caused by mob or
riot at one year. Here is another conflict. Are gene
ral statutes of limitation "municipal affairs" within
the meaning of the constitutional amendment?
There are other portions of the charter which con
flict with the general laws, but thor.e illustrations are
sufficient to make our point clear. What are we asked
to do in this matter? If the charter is unconstitutional
it certainly should not be adopted. It will cost thou
sands of dollars to litigate its provisions, and the
people are not anxious at the present time to in
crease their court expenses. We should like to read
an argument on the constitutional question from a
lawyer of repute, preferably an ex-Freeholder. If
the charter is adopted and merely results in giving us
a crop of lawsuits a number of legal reputations will
be shattered. It is quite evident that the points we
have made have not been considered.
The Santa Clara groom who resented the
friendly shower of rice by drawing a pistol and
threatening to shoot must have a sweet and sunny
disposition. lie is to be congratulated that some
well-wisher did not hurl an old shoe, in which case
nothing less than a Gatling gun could have made
fitting response.
The troops of the First were only wrecked twice on
the way south; yet the journey is a long one, and by
the exercise of its usual care the Southern Pacific
might easily have sent them into the ditch at least
three times.

Naturally Blanco is excited at this time, but he has

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 26, 1898.
I"^HE Continental nations are showing much feel
ing against the United States. Whether this will
rise to the height of a Spanish alliance remains
to be seen. The war in which we have engaged is
denounced in every Continental capital, and its cause,
which is novel, is declared to be insufficient.
A procession of empires has passed across the
stage of history, and the science of government and
the rights and powers of man in and through govern
ment have undergone a slow evolution. That process
has been accelerated since this republic appeared.
When Tom Paine expanded the rights of a colonial
people by first of all men uttering the declaration,
"These colonies are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent states," the novelty appalled even
his own countrymen, who had addressed themselves
to pleading at the foot of the throne for a redress
of grievances.
When Ben Franklin declared in the French court
that the purpose of the revolution was the founding
of a government based on the will of the majority
his French friends flinched and some jeered at him.
In badinage they would daily ask, "M. Franklin,
votre revolution comment va til?" and he would an
swer "Ca ira." One day at court he engaged in an
argument to prove that a majority government was
right. The courtiers proposed to submit the question
to a count, and those in favor of such government
were to stand and be counted on one side of the
room; those opposed upon the other. Franklin
stood and was counted alone. When the demonstra
tion over his defeat closed the philosopher said, "Not
so fast, my friends. You contend that the minority is
right. lam the minority, and by your own argument
I am proved right."
Many similar incidents illustrated the apparent
hopelessness of our novel position, but in our per
sistence it won, and this republic issued from the
victory.
Our second war with Great Britain was to vindi
cate the right of asylum and deny to a foreign power
the right of search* and seizure on the high seas under
pretense of the right to impress its subjects wherever
found. While the treaty of Ghent, which ended that
struggle, did not especially include this point, its vic
tory as a fact has never been denied.
We next met all Europe in diplomatic hostility in
denial of the monarchial doctrine, "Once a subject
always a subject," and stood for the right of man to
expatriate himself, forfeit and forswear his allegiance
and transfer it according to the dictates of his own
welfare. Nation after nation capitulated to this
novelty, and that right of man has not been denied
nor contested since .we took Martin Koszta from
Austria in the harbor of Smyrna. This republic was
a novelty in its beginning, and its growing strength
and influence in the world have been jused, not to
increase the rights of government over the rights of
man, but to expand the rights of man in government.
At no point in the line of precedents \ye have es
tablished has there been willing assent to our position
by the other nations of the earth. Yet we have won
and established them all, either in the face of hostile
armies or against hostile diplomacy.
Now we are embarked suddenly, unexpectedly, but
unitedly in another novel enterprise, which, like all
that preceded it, is in vindication of the rights of man.
We take our stand upon the declaration that while
we put in practice the theory that our Government
derives its just powers from the consent of the gov
erned, even a monarchy lias a right to govern only
while it governs well, and aligns its policy with the
happiness of its people. We do not sny thaft all peo
ple are qualified for self-government, but we declare
that all people arc entitled to good government. We
do not deny that a monarchy may be conformable to
the genius of some nations, but we appeal to the con
science of mankind upon the thesis that every Gov
ernment must hold its title and muniments in the
contentment of its people.
THE WASTE OF THE SCHOOL FUND.
DISCLOSURES made by Th- Call on Saturday
of the result of the investigation by the Grand
Jury into the manner and extent to which the
school funds have been wasted are followed this
morning by further disclosures brought to light by
the examination of yesterday. In the repair work of
every school building thus far inspected there have
been found evidences of the grossest frauds, and
hardly any doubt cm be felt that as the inspection
proceeds similar results will be obtained.
The investigation has covered only the six months
constituting the first half of the present fiscal year;
that is, from June 30 to December 31, 1897. Within
that comparatively short time and by an inspection
which is as yet far from complete, there have been
discovered practices by which the city has been rob
bed of many thousands of dollars. The frauds are
of so gross a nature it is hardly credible that the
members of the Buildings Committee and Finance
Committee of the School Board could have been
ignorant of them. In fact, it appears the practice of
this kind of boodling must have been carried on with
impunity for a considerable period, since the oper
ators would hardly have ventured upon such open
frauds unless long success had emboldened them to
throw aside discretion altogether.
The whole story must be read in our local columns
to obtain a full comprehension of the extent of the
frauds, but an understanding of their nature and the
audacity of the operators can be inferred from a
single illustration. The 'disclosures made in connec
tion with the work done on Spring Valley Grammar
School will serve as an example. For that building
there was charged against the city 51,220 feet of two
inch planking at $7 74 per thousand, while theamount
delivered was about 20.000 feet; 19,500 feet of 4x4
redwood was charged, and but 6100 feet delivered;
14,000 shingles were charged and but 8000 delivered.
The frauds, moreover, were not confined to the
practice of making charges for amounts of material
in excess of what was delivered. They were com
mitted in respect to quality as well as quantity.
Specifications calling for No. i lumber were filled
with lumber of lower grades. Where fancy shingles
were called for common shingles were delivered. In
this way a double rake-off was accomplished. The
city not only paid for more than it received, but it
paid for a higher quality of material than was given.
â¢ The scandal brought to light by this investigation
is one of the gravest in our annals. Official corruption
is at its worst when it invades the School Board and
wastes the funds which the people have voted to de
fray the cost of public education. With men who prac
tice corruption at the expense of the schools there
can be but one course to pursue. The Grand Jury
has started right. Now let it keep to the motto of
Grant, "Let no guilty man escape."
Spanish craft will keep a sharp lookout for the
yachts of American millionaires, but it may be sup
posed the millionaires will do the same thing. The
yachts are not equipped for a fight, but in the matter
of running away they have the proper lines.
NOVELTIES IN POLICY.
PRIZE
MONEY
THE capture of Spanish vessels by
â United States cruisers will no doubt
give an impetus to navy enlistments.
The prospect of prize money is alike
enticing to officers and men, and many
of the former, or their families, have
small fortunes in prize money made dur
ing the war of 1861-65.
The prize law of the United States is
very simple in its application. In the
case where a ship-of-war captures another
of superior or equal force the entire net
proceeds is decreed to the captor; when
the capture is of inferior force one-half
of the proceeds goes to the United States,
where it is covered into the naval pen
sion fund, and the other half goes to the
captors, and is distributed as follows: To
the commander of the fleet, one-twentieth
part; to the fleet captain, one-hundredth
part; to the commander of the vessel
making the capture, one-tentn part; the
remainder is divided among all others do
ing duty on board the captor in propor
tion to their respective rates of pay. All
prizes are adjudicated by a prize court,
which orders the sale of the vessel and
its cargo by public auction, and the pro
ceeds, less the court expenses, are dis
posed of as above stated.
The captures made by our navy during
the war of 1861-65, of Confederate war
ships, merchant vessels and blockade
runners numbered 1149 of all descriptions,
valued at $24,500,000, besides 355 destroyed.
The Confederate States cruisers captured
or destroyed 259 vessels, of which the
Alabama took 69, the Florida 37, Shenan
doah 36, Tallahassee 29, Sumter 18, Tac- ]
ony 15, and thirteen other cruisers took j
fifty-five vessels. The damage which
these nineteen armed vessels inflicted
was nearly as great as that of our cruis
ers in their capture and confiscation of
1504 vessels, valued at $31,500,000, over one
third of which was British property.
The first capture of the Civil War was j
the schooner Cambria; laden with coal,!
by the United States frigate Cumberland,
on April 23, IS6I, eleven days after Fort
Sumter had been fired upon, The vessel
was released after taking out her 118 tons
of coal. After the Southern ports had
been declared closed blockade running
became quite profitable, when succecc
ful. but many of the 267 steamers cap
tured proved rich prizes to United States
v.-ss.'ls. The most notable and exceeding
$200,000 in value were as follows:

EAGLES FLYING HOME TO ROOST.
In the last month nearly $10,000,000 in
gold have been shipped from Europe and
Australia to the I'nited States, and the
movement still continues. Jt is a case of
the eagles Hying home to roost, and the
flock lr> a big one. Mr. Ingalls made the
foolish statement in the Senate on a cer
tain occasion that gold was a craven;
that it at once hid away on the approach
0/ war. But the present war scare has
certainly had quite the contrary effect on
gold. Instead of running away to hide
until the war is over, it is coming back
home to take an important part in the
proceedings. The steadily increasing gold
reserve in the United States treasury,
which now exceeds $173,000,000, and the
rapidly accumulating stock of gold in the
banks constitute the strongest kind of a
backing for the United States for the suc
cessful prosecution of a war.â Kansas

SPIRIT OF '98
REMEMBER THE MAINE.
When the vengeance wakes, when the battle
breaks,
And the ships sweep out to sea;
When the foe is neared; when the decks are
cleared,
And the colors floating free;
When the squadrons meet, when it's fleet to
fleet,
And front to front with Spain;
From ship to ship, from lip to lip
Pass on the quick refrain,
"Remember, remember the Maine!"
When the flag- shall sign, "Advance in line.
Train ships on an even keel".
When the guns shall flash and the shot shall
crash
And bound on the ringing steel;
When the rattling blasts from the armored
masts
And hurling their deadliest rain.
Let their voices loud, through the blinding
cioud.
Cry, ever, the fierce refrain,
"Kemember, remember the Maine!"
God's sky and sea in that storm shall be
Fate's chaos of smoke and flame.
But across that hell every shot shall tell.
Not a gun can miss its aim;
Not a blow shall fall on the crumbling l-rall,
And the waves that engulf the slain
Shall sweep the decks of the blackened
wrecks,
With the thundering, dread refrain,
"Remember remember the Maine!"

in The Call to the effect that Abraham

favors the abolition of slavery by what
ever means the end can be best accom

gradual emancipation or by payment of
sums of money to owners of slaves. Lin

wanted to see it abolished, and when he
had an opportunity. In Congress, he gave
expression to his desire by voting as he
did. and finally abolished slavery by hia
grand emancipation proclamation.

io fully furnish to the Government
its quota of soldiers. It has raised
high the banner of the Red Cross, and,
where the stars and stripes may be
called, the Red Cross will follow. Un
der its shadow will be devoted men and
women, ready to attend the woundei
and the sick, anxious to bra-e danger
that the hardship of the boys at the
front may be lessened, their patriotism
quickened by the thought that the coun
try sustains them.
The Red Cro^ League has been or
ganized. There is hack of it an earnest
purpose. Women were at the meeting,
and, as they talked of the work ahead,
their voices trembled, for some of them
thought the plans discussed for gentle
ministration on the field of battle or in
the hospital might mean the placing of
a cup of water to the lips of their own
sons. Some remembered well the suf
fering after every engagement of the
late war in this country. Some had
known the sorrow of sending away rela
tives who had not returned. There was
no division of sentiment. It became evi
dent that the women were to take a
prominent part. Every humane sug
gestion came from them or received
their quick indorsement.
~ One gentleman could not see the need

had been slain, that r.o soldier was
bleeding. Gently but firmly the ladies
overruled him. but with a graciousness
winch retrained from characterizing his
position as ridiculous. They all real
ized the present to be the time for ac
tion. There could be no excuse tor de
lay, and in.i.c was accepted. Of course
first formal meeting could do little

of supplying relief in every possible

later, but with no unnecessary delay.
There are many things to be provided.
be raised, but all will be
given. The spirit of patriotism is in the
air. People are ready to give. They
are only waiting for the opportunity.
It will s â ' m be at hand.
The prevalent idea as manifest at the
meeting was that especial attention be
welfare of troops gjing from
California, as other States are preparing
are of their own. But the
services oi the league are to be ten
. to the national Government An
especial effort will be made to see that
â¢rnian volunteers shall go to
the front equipped with every appliance
for comfort ami the preservation of
health, that the medical corps in charge
of them shall have a full supply of mod
ern instruments. There must be special
tents, bedding, tent stoves; a thousand
articles such as will not be in the regu
lar Government stores. That all these
will be forthcoming there is no shadow
of doubv.
But while California naturally thinks
first of her own, where there are wound
ed men in need of attention, where the
sick lie in hospitals, patriotism draws
no line. The Red Cross knows no fav
orites. It has no enemy. Even the foe
man loses his character as such and be
comes but a suffering mortal. The hu
manity which takes to the place of car
nage the emblem of mercy is as broad
as the world. It will not ask whether a
man is from the Pacific or the ever
glades, whether his home is among the
hills of New England or the Carolina
pines.

Treasurer â "William Alvord, Bank
of California.
The Call's suggestion that California
lead the way in organizing a Red Cross
League crystallized into action yester
day when the committee appointed by
Governor Budd met at the California
Hotel and effected permanent organiza
tion.
The meeting was a innst er.'.huslas
tic one, every member of it being 1 ready
and eager to enter upon the work. In
addition to the ladies and gentlemen
appointed by the Governor there were
present many others, commissioned on
ly by the warm interest they feel in
the boys in blue and the patriotic im
pulses awakened by the war with
Spain. Although these non-commis-
Bioned officers of the great merciful
army took no prominent part in yester
day's proceedings, they were made wel
come by the Red Cross League and
Sanitary Commission of Californiaâ
which is the name adopted at the Rev.
Dr. Foute's suggestion by l*"Â» loyal
m*-n and women whom the Governor
had placed at the head.

the interest of this meeting by delivering

Suicide.
Frederick C. Bidinger. a butcher, resid

dead In bed yesterday morning by his
brother Kdward. Edward, with his fam
ily, occupied a front room. At 6 o'clock
iii the morning Edward entered the room
of the deceased and shook him by the
shoulder, at the sa-ne time calling upon
him to get up. Then he discovered that
iiis brother was cold and dead.
A bottle of carbolic acid and a glass
containing some of the stuff were found
on tho bureau near the head of Freder
ick's bed. His relatives know of no cause
for the suicide, although the man had
appeared to be a little downhearted for
some time before his death.
The deceased was a native of San Fran

held.
FOUND DROWNED.
J. G. Gerken, a Sewing Machine
Agent, Ends a Spree in the
Waters of the Bay.
The body of an unknown man was
found yesterday morning floating in the
bay at the foot of Third street by a boat
man named W. Randall. The body had
been in the water about a week and the
features were unrecognizable, but when
the clothing was searched at the Morgue
papers were found showinc that the de

Domestic Sewing Machine Company, at
l"ii Market street.
Gerken was a drinking man and wont
off on a spree about a week ago. since
which time lie had not been seen by any
of his friends. His son Arthur, of 20C
Post street, called at the Morgue in the
afternoon and identified the remains as
those of his father, lie had not seen his
first organization should be a national
one. But in addition to this there is
the closer, personal relation in which
we stand to the men who have gone to
the front from California. They should
be our peculiar rare. Whether the ser
vice we are failed upon to perform is
in raising funds, or forwarding supplies
or sending- trained nurses, men ..r
women, as may be decided, the feeling
that the soldiers from California are
our buys and are entitled to our first
consideration is the strongest. My own
son may have to g<> to the front. I
can't lose my personal interest in him
because he is regarded by the Govern
ment simply as an American soldier.
"For my part, I am not so much
afraid of battle as I am of disease.
Our boys will be exposed to the rigors
of disease more than to the puns of the
Spaniards. I am afraid of the hand of
God, not of bullets from the hands of
men. We must remember that every
germ of yellow fever that has come to
America came frnm Cuba.
"The national and the State interest
may be united, I think. But it is of
! imperative necessity that we act at
| once."
Surgeon-General Hopkins then ad
i dressed the meeting. He spoke strong
ly on the requirements of the situation,
dwelling upon California's duty to her
own sons first.
"We need ambulances, stores, medical
supplies. We are prepared only on a

nature among the men of the National

There was applause from feminine
hands at this view of the case. It was
the women in yesterday's meeting that
1 were the radicals. They are tingling
with the desire to do what lies in their
power for tha comfort of the sons and
I brothers, whoso departure for the East
draws nearer and nearer.
"I have two sons," said Mrs. John G.

Sanitary Commission during the civil
war, "who are likely to be called upon.
Both are eligible. Both are anxious to

that our first care should be for these

"We don't want any money. As yet
we don't need any money," said Dr.
Stebbins.
"We'd like to have some, I assure
you," said Dr. Hopkins, earnestly, "it
will take $3000 to properly equip our
men."
"It costs a little fortune to care for

It was Rabbi Voorsanger who playad

HOW THE HOSTILE SHIPS ARE MOVING.
THE SAN FRAKCISUU UAJL.Ii, TUESDAY, APRIL 2U, lÂ»yÂ».TO COMMAND
DEFENSES OF
THE HARBOR
General Merriam, U. S. A., Issues an Order
Placing Colonel M. P. Miller, Third Artil
lery, in Charge of All the Batteries
and the Mine Field.
Garrison at Fort Point Will Be Re-enforced To-Day by
Troops From Angel Island and Fort Mason.
Department Commander Leaves for
Vancouver.
Important orders were is
sued yesterday by General
Merriam, commanding the De
partment of California. The
orders announce that Colonel
M. P. Miller, Third Artillery,
is placed in command of all
artillery troops, guns and de
fensive works, and in con
trol of all war materials in
and about San Francisco har
bor.
Post commanders are di
rected, while administering
post affairs, to subordinate all
other considerations to meet
the demands of Colonel Mil
ler.
All officers and Govern
ment agents charged with
functions connected with har
bor defense are enjoined to
keep in close touch and hearty
co-operation for effective de
fense at all hours.
It was ascertained at the
Presidio yesterday that the
order places Colonel Miller in
charge of the entire line of de
fense, embracing the island
batteries as well as Lime
Point works and the Fort
Point fortifications. The mor
tar batteries, the dynamite
guns, torpedoes and submarine
mines are also included.
To-day Colonel Miller will direct Bat
tery G, Third Artillery, First Lieuten
ant Benjamin H. Randolph command
ing, to take station at Fort Point. The
ftearoer McDowell will transport the
battery from Angel Island to the
I'residio.
Battery E. Third Artillery, Captain
Sedgwiok Pratt commanding will be
directed to move from Black Point
i Fort Mason) and take station at the
outer works near Fort Point.
It 13 no longer a secret that re-en
forcements are needed on the line of
works commanding the approach to
the Golden Gate. The three batteries
of the Third Artillery now on duty
there have been at the guns day and
night. The force is not sufficient for
the service required.
Lieutenant-Colonel Louis T. Morris,
Fourth Cavalry, still retains command
of the post at the Presidio. The ap
pointment of Colonel Miller to the com
mand of the artillery defenses of the
harbor does not disturb the status of
Colo-nel Morris.
Colonel Marcus P. Miller, Third Ar
tillery, was appointed a cadet at the
â United States Military Academy at West
Point, from Massachusetts. September 1,
1854, and was graduated July 1, ISSB. He
was appointed second lieutenant. Fourth
Artillery, September 27. 1559; first lieu
tenant May 14, 1861: captain May 11. 1564;
major. Fifth Artillery, September 14,
'lieutenant colonel. First Artillery,
October 10, I*> 34, and colonel, Third Artil
lery, in 1897.
For gallant and meritorious services in
the battle of Malvern Hill, Virginia, he
â was hrevetted captain July 1, 1862; he was
brevetted major March 13, lSt>s, for gallant
and meritorious services in tin- cavalry
campaign from Winchester to Richmond,
Va., March 31, 1865, he was brevetted lieu
tenant colonel for meritorious services in
the battle of Dinwiddie Courthouse, Vir
ginia, February 2, IS9O, he was brevetted
colonel for gallant and meritorious ser
vices in action against Indians in the
Lava Beds. California, April 17, 1K73. and
Bpecial gallantry and military ability in
action against Indians at Clearwater,
Idaho. July 11 and 12. 1577.
As soon as quarters can be arranged at
or near Fort Point Colonel Miller will es
tablish headquarters there. At present
lie will direct operations from the Pre-
Bidio, but will daily visit the batteries.
A powerful searchlight, which is< need
ed at Fort Point, will soon be provided.
The dynamo of the mortar battery can
supply the illuminating power.
Now that war has been declared the
necessity for an outside patrol is recog
nized. It is not known that a Spanish
cruiser Is within 2000 miles of San Fran
cisco, but yet the one chance In a hun
dred of a hostile craft making a dash in
this direction will not be lost sight of.
General Henry C. Merrlam, commanding
the departments of the Columbia and
California, accompanied by Major Thomas
11. Harry, adjutant general. Department
of Columbia, left San Francisco on last
evening's train for Vancouver Barracks,
Washington, headquarters of the Depart
ment of the Columbia,
Troops B, c. I and K. Fourth United
States Cavalry, under the command of
â¢ I Morris, are performing garrison
duty at the Presidio. There is scarcely
a wheel on the reservation and outside
labor is hired for garrison work.
troopen of the Fourth Cavalry are
ready to leave for the front at an hour's
notice, but the impression prevails that
no more regulars will b>> sent to the scene
of probable conflict until volunteers are
available for duty at -the Presidio.
MOUNTED MEN.
A Regiment of Southern
California Volunteer
Cavalry.
The scenes around the Governor's head
quarters yesterday were full of life and
animation. At an early hour the promi
nent officers began to gather in anticipa
tion of expected orders from the East,
and much speculation was engaged In.
<me of the most prominent arrivals
during the day was that of Lieutenant-
Colonel H. W. Patton of the newly or
ganized First Regiment Southern Califor
nia Volunteer Cavalry of Los Angeles
County. Tho regiment is composed of
twelve troops of 100 men each, and i s
commanded by Colonel Johnstone Junes,
who for many years was adjutant-general
of North Carolina. Colonel Patton pre
sented the following resolution to Gov
ernor Budd:
To his Excellency James H. Budd. Governor
of Californiaâ Sir: I have the honor to re
port to you the organization of the First
Rpglment. Southern California Volunteer Cav
alry, and to tender to you through Lieuten
ant Colonel H. W. Patton the services of Bali
regiment In the conflict now belnj wageJ
against Spain. Our preference is for the
front, but we are at your command and will
go wherever you order us. Very respectfully
JOHXSTONE JONES
The majors of squadrons are L. E.
Mocher, M. L. Starin and J. T. Thompson.
Colonel Thomas M. Cluff and Lieuten
ants AY. A. Hals-tead and C. H. Murphy
of General Dickinson's staff were at head
quarters early in the day.
Colonels Hurpln and Bush were again
on duty assisting 'he adjutant-general.
It was learned yesferday and was later
confirmed by the Governor that he has
during the past few days been busy ascer
taining the status and class of. the officers
of the National Guardâ that is as to their
ability, fitness and whether married or
single. The adjutant-general and Captain
Carrington have left absolutely no stone
unturned to assist the Governor in secur
ing every possible piece of detailed in
formation concerning the National Guard
that may be of service.
Lieutenant F. L. Pinkey, Lieutenant E.
B. Babbitt of the United States ordnance
station at Benicia. Captain AY. D. Smythe
date of the Indian Staff Corps) and J. R.
ry. M.D. (late assistant surgeon
I'nited States Volunteers) were at head
quarters.
All day long there was the same con
tinual stream of callers, who wanted to
offer their services. In every instance
they were told to file their applications
and that they would be considered at the
proper time.
SECOND COUNCIL,
The Governor Collects In
formation for the War
Department.
Governor Budd, Adjutant-General Bar
rett, Major-General Dickinson, Brigadier-
General Warfield and Captain Carrington
held an important conference until quite
a late hour last night. At the conclusion
of the conference. Governor Budd said:
"We held the conference for the purpose
of considering as to the best method of
collecting from the Guard and furnishing
the War Department with desired infor
mation. Orders have been issued by
which the desired information will be
s. lit to the War Department to-morrow,
in addition to that which they have al
ready transmitted to Washington. There
was nothing else considered at the con
ference."
Headquarters will be kept open from
now until it is definitely known just what
will be done.
"MAY BE NEEDED."
Lieutenant Sidney A. Clo
man Ordered to Remain
at Berkeley,
BERKELEY, April 25.â Lieutenant 8.
A. Cloman, Fifteenth Infantry, O. S. A.,
commandant of the cadet battalions at
the university, to-day received a telegram
from Washington denying him permission
to leave the university to Join the army
at the front. The dispatch, which came
from Assistant Adjutant-General Schwan,
was as follows:
"Request for release from duty at the
university not approved by the Secretary
of War at present. Your services may
be needed in California."
Lieutenant Cloman is not certain just
what is meant by the suggestive closing
sentence of the dispatch. "It may be
that I shall be required to assist in mus
tering in recruits, he said, "or possibly
to assist In coast defense, although we
have plenty of men in California for this
purpose. It is not unlikely if danger on
this coast were apprehended an increased
force of troops would be sent to protect
Puget Sound, which is not nearly so
strongly fortified as San Francisco har
bor."
Although the university cannot send its
military commander to the war it will
send its two cannon to the front. Presi
dent Kellogg to-day received a dispatch
from the Avar Department requesting
him to have the big guns forwarded to
the Rock Island Arsenal. Illinois. Ar
morer John Mitchell and half a dozen pa
triotic students immediately pet to work
and spent most of the day getting the
guns, carriages and limbers ready for
their trip across the continent. The guns
will be shipped from Berkeley Station
about 11 o'clock to-morrow morning, and
a number of the students are preparing
to make the event an occasion for a grand
patriotic demonstration.
In spite of the departure for the Bast
of Colonel George Burton, U. S. A., who
was to have reviewed the university cadet
battalions next Thursday, the review and
inspection will take place. Major Ed
ward Field, U. S. A., will be the review
ing officer. The inspection will take place
at 10:30 a, m.. followed at 1:30 p. m. by
regimental review, bayonet exercise, bat
talion drill and company competitive
drill.
A COAST PATROL.
Necessity of Such a Sys
tem Shown to the
Government.
An effective patrol system for the coast
line of California is just now occupying
the attention of the local army and navy
officers, and the result will be a system
of land and sea outposts that will be able
to announce the presence of any hostile
vessel long before she can get within
striking distance of San Francisco.
The necessity for such a patrol was tel
graphed in cipher to Washington yester
day, together with an estimate of what
such a system would require. It suggests
a patrol fleet, plenty of searchlights, both
afloat and ashore, and a system of sig
nals and telephonic and telegraphic com
munication, which will effectually cover
the coast.
It is not known just what action the
Government will takf. but it is expected
that there will be no delay in putting
some kind of a patrol in force at once.
The lighthouse establishment will be the
basis of the coast patrol, and already
plans have been prepared to connect the
stations by wire as far north as Point
Arena, and lor a cable to th â¢ Farallon
Islands. Each will be
required to keep a lookout over his own
vicinity day and night, and nearer in to
ward the city searchlights will be placed
to help guard the waters at night. Pa
trol boats will be in motion up and down
the coast all the time, and the comlne of
a hostile fleet can be signaled from sta
tion to station in an lncreuibly short
space of time.
In the event of hostilities the aids to
navigation all along the coast will sud
denly disappear. Buoys will be taken up,
lights will be extinguished and foe sig
nals will be silenced, and it will be only
the most expert pilot who can take ves
sels in and out. This, with the coast pa
trol, the fortifications on the heights and
the coast defenders in the harbor, will
make San Francisco an undesirable place
for anything Spanish that floats.
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Chamber of Commerce this
afternoon the question extenaingacable
to the Farallones will be one of the sub
jects brought up for consideration.
This question has been ; discussed tirao ]
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 26, 1898.
and aprain by the merchants of this city,
and several attempts have been made to
enlist the attrition nf the federal Gov
ernment on the proposition, but up to this
nothing has been done in the matter. Now
that war is on it is considered absolutely
necessary to have a wire stretched to the
islands. The cost of this would amount
to only about $30,000. a mere bagatelle
when compared to the value of the ser
vice rendered to this city, even if there
was no war trouble.
Commerce alone to San Francisco would
justify the necessity of having a wire
stretched to this important sea island,
which stands at the gateway to the Gol
den Gate.
WAR INCIDENTS.
A Motorman's Patriotism.
Tug Fearless Goes to
the Union Iron
Works.
J. B. Kelly, a motorman on the San
Francisco and San Mateo Reailroad. has
demonstrated his patriotism and nerve '
by enlisting In the marines of the United j
States navy. He has gone to the front |
to uphold the flag. Mr, Kelly is not a na
tive son of California, but is a native son
of Roscommon. Ireland.
Golden City Lodge No. 65, Knights of
Pythias, has adopted this resolution:
Whereu. By action of the Congress of these
United States and the proclamation of the
President a state of war exists between this
Government and the kingdom of Spain: ami
whereas, a call for volunteers to enlist in the
arm lea of our country Is momentarily ex
pected to be made; and whereas, many of the
members of this lodge, as loyal and patriotic
citizens, may feel duty-bound to enlist anil
may so enlist, leaving their families unpro
tected: therefore, be it
Resolved. By Golden City Lodge No. C 3.
Knights of Pythias, of California, that this
lodge will aid and protect the families of such
of Its members as may answer such a call by
maintaining their good standing In the lodge,
v. here necessary, making the monthly
payments required of those holding certlfl. ate's
In the endowment rank, and thus prevent for
feiture of such certlfleates. Fraternally, In
F. C. and B. H. SCHAFFNER,
Chancellor Commander.
The superb tug Fearless, formerly of the
Spreckels fleet, but now belonging to the
I'nited States, was towed to the Union
Iron Works yesterday morning. The tug
will receive a tine armament of rapid-fire
guns.
PATRIOTIC BANQUET
Veterans of the California
Volunteers at Table.
The thirty-seventh annual meeting and
banquet of the Society of California Vol
unteers took place at the Occidental Hotel
last evening.
Before the festivities commenced a few
little business matters were transacted,
with the following results: Comrade Sol
Cahen. Third California Infantry, v.
tired as president, and was succeeded by
Captain Charles W. Gordon. The reason
of Comrade Cahen's retirement from the
presidency was that he had been elected
department commander of the Grand
Army, and so could not very well serve
in the two positions at onto. Major Alfred
Martin of the Seventh California Infantry
was elected vice-president; Benjamin Col
lins. Sixth Infantry, second viee-preaident;
John C. Innes, recording secretary; Cap
tain James L. Homer, corresponding sec
retary, and Colonel C. Mason Kinne,
treasurer.
After the business meeting nearly fifty
of the companions sat down to their an
nual banquet and enjoyed themselves in
their usual way until long after miiinight.
Reminiscences of the past were Indulged
in ami patriotic speeches made by most of
those present. After some remarks by the
I ;ist president he invited Colonel Kinne to
act as toastmaster, who successively and
successfully called upon the following,
who responded to the sentiments:
"The President of the United States."
Hon. Henry < '. Dibble; "Our Country and
Our Flap." General E. 8. Salomon; "The
Army and Navy of the United States of
America." Colonel John C Carrier; "The
Societj- of California Volunteers." Cap
tain C. W. Gordon; "Our Golden State of
California," Hon. Charles A. Sumner
"The Union Dead," Colonel W. R. Smed
berg; "The Guests of the Nation," S. J.
Loop, president Veterans' Home.
Among those present were the follow
ing:
Sol Cahen. Colonel C. Mason Kinne, General
E. S. Salomon, Captain H. A. Goyley, Colonel
J. C. Currier. Colonel J J. Lyon, Captain John
Lafferty, Colonel 8. .1. Loop, Lieutenant Ellsha
Brooks, Captain James L. Homer. Benjamin

Ma.<tellar, Major J. H. Simpson Major Lewis
Smith J. C. Jenkins. George B. Tolman Cap
tain J. C. Innes, Lieutenant J. J sheuherd
Major William 13. Hooper. ' '
An additional sentiment was added to
I the occasion by the fact that lust thirty
| seven years ago yesterday the' California
volunteers marched away to the front full
; of youth, strength and patriotism, and
p last night, as they sat down together old
I and gray-headed, to talk over their' old
; campaigning days and tight their battles
once again, they did so with a declaration
| of warâ which may plunge the country
i into another bloody struggleâ ringinc in
i their ears.
CALL'S BULLETIN SERVICE.
Once again the people of San Francisco and the coast appreciate the
energy and determination of The Call management. The special bulletins
which were distributed throughout the entire city yesterday were heartily
commended by the people, as they carried the authentic news of the day re
garding the war with Spain. The neat form, correctness as to the news
printed therein and the rapidity with which ihey were circulated as soon
as the news was received by wire brought forth words of praise from all,
and the number of communications received from the leading business men
asking that - bulletin be regularly placed in front of their establishments
showed that the new departure Is something worthy of more than passing
notice.
At the present time the authentic bulletins are carried to a large num
ber of bulletin boards distributed evenly throughout the city. Yesterday
large crowds hovered over them the entire day, knowing full well that the
report was published from reliable -sources and there was no attempt made
to form a yarn from rumor or whole clotff. Nine fleet bicycle riders carry
the news to the posting places, and each one knows how anxiously the
people await every new development, and In consequence a spirit is placed
in the work which could not be surpassed. Requests are simply pouring
in for a copy of the bulletin to ho loft at various places, and the requests
will be fulfilled as soon as possible.
Now the local public is not obliged to await the posting- of matter con
cerning important news of the day on large bulletin boards, but the news Is
carried directly to them, and in well-worded and compact form. The ap
pended list shows partially the number of places where The Call's special
bulletins are hourly posted for public inspection:

RAISING THE
REVENUE TAX
An Income Tax to Be One
of the Features of the
War Measure.
Those Whose Incomes Are
Less Than Two Thousand
â¢ a Year Will Be Exempt.
Other Sources by Which It Is Pro
posed to Vastly Increase the
Federal Income.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 25.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: If the
Democratic members of the House
Committee on Ways and Means can
have their way an income tax is to be
made one of the leading features of the
war tax bill. This proposed tax was
subjected to considerable discussion at
a conference of the Democratic mem
bers of the committee to-day. It was
first proposed that a tax of 5 per cent
should be imposed on all incomes over
$4000 a year. McClellan strongly op
posed this, however, and wanted the
tax cut down to 2 per cent and ex
emption fixed at $2000. A compromise
was finally reached fixing the tax at 3
per cent and the exemption at $2000.
State and municipal bonds are to be
exempt from this proposed tax. Demo
crats contend that the war should be
paid for as far as possible by taxation
and not by bonds and that bonds should
only be issued when other taxation had
been resorted to as far as possible. As
a substitute for certificates of indebted
ness some of the Democratic members
of the committee, including Bailey, at
first proposed to offer an amendment
providing for an issue of $100,000,000 in
greenbacks. A compromise was reached
by which the Democrats will propose
to raise $50,000,000 by coining the so
called seigniorage on silver buiHon now
in the treasury and by limiting the is
sue of certificates of indebtedness to
$50,000,000.
The Ways and Means Committee of
the House will report the war revenue
bill to-morrow, and it is not expected
to pass until late in the week.
There are two new features. One,
which is made section 25, gives author
ity for the taxed parties and concerns
to meet the increased rates. It fol
lows:
That every person, firm or corporation
who shall have made any contract prior
to the passing of this act and without
other provision therein for the payment
of taxes imposed by law enacted subse
quent thereto, upon articles to be deliv
ered under such contract, is hereby au
thorized and empowered to add to the
price thereof so much money as will be
equivalent to the tax Imposed on said
articles by this act, and not previously
paid by the vendee, and shall be entitled
by virtue hereof to be paid, and to sue
for and to recover the same accordingly.
In all cases of articles manufactured uy
another., if the manufacturer shall be re
quired to pay under this act the tax here
by Imposed, such person or persons so
paying the same shall be entitled to col
lect the amount thereof of the owner or
owners, and shall have a lien for the
amount thus paid on the produced or
manufactured goods.
The amended bill Imposes a tax upon
telephone messages as follows:
For thirty miles or more, where the
charge docs not exceed 25 cents, 1 cent;
where charges exceed 25 cents and do not
exceed $1, 2 cents; from $1 to $o. 6 cents;
and charge exceeding 16, 10 cents. Of
ficial messages of the United States are
exempt from this tax, as well as that on
telegraph messages. Owners and oper
ators of long-distance lines are required
to report monthly to the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue the number of mes
sages during the preceding month of a
distance of thirty miles or more for which
a charge has been made, together with
the amount received, under a penalty of
not exceeding $500 for failure to report.
The setting apart of $750,000 for the
Marine Hospitel service from the re
ceipts from 1. aÂ»e uuiies is limited
to the fiscal year 1899. For the expenses
of assessment and collections of these
taxes $100,000 or sn much of that as is
necessary is appropriated for the em
ployment of such deputy collectors and
other employes in the several collec
tion districts of the United States as
may be necessary.
The exemption of bonds, debentures
or certificates of indebtedness issued by
the Federal, State, county, town and
municipal corporations from the stamp
taxes imposed by the bill is extended to
include "'or other corporations exercis
ing the taxing power." Punishment
for failure to acquire an adhesive duty
stamp on any dispatches or message is
waived in the case of press news dis
patches. Bank certificates of deposit
not drawing: interest are taxed 2 cents,
and those drawing interest 5 cents.
There are many other minor changes.
READY FOR WAR.
Companies of the First In
fantry Awaiting the
Call for Troops.
The members of Companies C and G of
the First Infantry, National Guard of
California, after .1 well-attended drill at
their armory on Eilis street la-st night,
expressed their readiness to respond to
ihe call for State troops -when made by
Governor Budd. Sixty of the men pres
ent volunteered their services without
any reservation as to which organiza
tion they may be assigned. When the
members of the two companies were
asked what action they would take if the
companies were called out in a body they
shouted "All of us!" and raised cheer
upon cheer, making the armory ring with
their expressions of enthusiasm.
The already large roll of the companies
was increased by the addition of the
names of twenty-one new men, who were
sworn in by Captain Sutliff for Company
G and 'Lieutenant Goodell for Company
C. Twer.t> -seven applications for mem
bership were received and the companies
have a large emergency roll of men who
will be Btvutn in as poon as the call for

TARGET PRACTICE.
Existing Rules and Regu
lations Discussed by
the Inspectors.
Yesterday afternoon there was a meet
ing of Inspectors of rifle practice at bri
gade headquarters for the purpose of dis
cussing the rules and regulations at this
time governing State shoots In California.
There were present: Colonel Park Hen
shaw, inspector-general on the staff of the
commander-in-chief ; Lieutenant-Colonel
Louis Barrere, inspector on the division
staff; Major Unsmer, on the Second Bri
gade staff; Lieutenant Tobin, inspector
for the First Infantry, Second Brigade;
Lieutenant Pirky. Inspector for the Sec
ond Regiment, Third Brigade; and Cap
tain D. A. Smith, adjutant of the Fifth
Infantry, Second Brigade, and acting in
spector for that regiment. Neither the
First nor the Third brigade nor the Sixth
and Seventh regiments of infantry were
represented.
Colonel Henshaw, who called the meet
ing to order, stated that at this, the first
meeting, the discussion would be informal
and expressed the hope that every one
present would express his view of the
rules and regulations, as he desired to
obtain aJI the light possible on the sub
ject. He then called on Captain Smith to
tell what he knew.
Captain Smith stated that there had
been a very marked falling off in target
practice since the existing rules went into
operation last June, and he believed one
reason was that the men were inhibited
from engaging In shoots on Sundays, the
only day on which men can face the tar
get without great inconvenience. Another
reason was that rule which barred men
who did not make a certain percentage
from shooting at other distances. He
also suggested that two months in the
year should be set apartâ say May and
Septemberâ when men could, when con
venient, under the supervision of regi
mental officers, fire at the several dis
tances. He also suggested that the num
ber of rounds of ammunition should be
increased.
All the other inspectors spoke, calling
attention to defects in the rules and reg
ulations and indorsed the views expressed
by the first speaker.
It is probable that radical changes
which will prove satisfactory will be
made.
SHARKEY AT THE BEACH.
The Muscular Heavy Weight Is Feel
ing First Class and Confident
of Success.
Thomas Bharkey, the bold sailor lad,
arrived from Vallejo yesterday and will
complete his training for his bout with
Jeffries on May 6 at a resort near the
ocean, and which Is within easy distance
of the pure salt water.
Sharkey Is a crack swimmer, and de
lights to be breasting and buffeting the
big rollers which clash to pieces on the
sands. He says that swimming forms a
great part of his daily exercise and that
without it he would be unable to train
properly for any athletic contest.
Of the injury Sharkey sustained at
VallejD a few days ago while lifting a
bale of hay, he says at first he had
fears the strain would cause him no end
of annoyance, but as time wore on he
grew rapidly well, and was pronounced
perfectly safe before he left Vallejo by
the physicians who attended him. He will
have four men to handle and train him
for the big match.
Sharkey contends that two men are not
enough, as they cannot go the pace ho
puts on when he feels like hammering
somebody.
If nothing unforeseen happens between
now and the evening of the contest Shar
key expects to be in trim to fight the
battle of a nation. He is very sanguine
of defeating Jeffries and will have several
large commissions on himself in the pool
rooms beforj he will put in an appear
ance in the ring.
Jeffries is training at Oakland under the
care of the astute Billy Delaney. The big
Los Angeles heavy-weight has not a
word to say of his chances, but intimates
that there will be a surprise in store for
somebody before many rounds are fought.
Jane Isaacs Arrested.
Jane Isaacs was last night arrested by
Detective Anthony and Officer Sylvester
on complaint of Annie Japson. Mrs.
Isaacs, a short time ago, advertised for
a girl, and Annie answered. The girl
seemed satisfactory, and arrangements
were made for the two to go to Sonora,
when the girl's friends became suspicious
as to the character of the woman, and
she decided not to go. Mrs. Isaacs, how
ever, retained possession of the girl's be
longings, and a warrant was sworn out
for the woman's arrest on a charge of
petty larceny. The goods have been lo
cated in a storage warehouse.
CALIFORNIA
TROOPS MAY
NOW RALLY
Governor Budd Receives the Eagerly Expected
Message From the War Department Ask
ing Men of This State to Volunteer
in Their Country's Cause.
Chief Executive, Division Commander and Adjutant-
General Hold Councils of Warâ Governor Estimates
That the Whole National Guard May Be
Called Into the Volunteer Service.
The President, through the
Secretary of War, yesterday
issued the call for troops, and
in consequence the entire Na
tional Guard of California
will doubtless be mustered
into the United States service.
At 4:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon Governor Budd re
ceived the followingdispatch:
WASHINGTON, D. C,
April 25, 1898.
To the Governor of California,
San Francisco, Cal.
The number of troops from your
State under the call of the Presi
dent, dated April 23, 1898, will b;
two regiments and two battalions
of infantry and four heavy bat
teries of artillery. It is the wish
of l he President that the regiments
of the National Guard or State
militia shall be used as far as
their numbers will permit, lor the
reason they are armed, equipped
and drilled.
Please wire as early as possible
what equipments, ammunition,
arms, blankets, tents, etc., you
have and what additional you
will require. Please aso state
when troop* will be ready for
muster into ths United States ser
vice. Details to follow by mail.
R. A. ALGER,
Secretary of War.
Immediately upon the re
ceipt of the dispatch Gov
ernor Budd held a conference
with Adjutant- General Bar
rett, Major-General Dickin
son, Brigadier-General War
field and Captain Carrington,
U. S. A. The conference was
for the purpose of framing a
reply to the Secretary of War,
and this was done, but the
exact nature of the message
sent by the Governor was
withheld.
Governor Budd after reply
ing to Secretary Alger's dis
patch gave out the following
statement for publication:
"From what I can gather
from the dispatch that I have
received the entire National
Guard will be called out.
This is figured out upon the
basis of the militia popula
tion, upon which the army
volunteer bill was framed.
The call is for two twelve
company regiments and two
four - company battalions,
making thirty-two companies
of enlisted men. On the
basis of 103 men to the com
pany this would require 3296
men, and adding four bat
teries to this of 200 men
each will bring the number
up to 4096, or in round num
bers 4100 men. This will
practically require the entire
National Guard.
"The men will now have
to be mustered into service,
and I have issued no orders,
nor will 1 until I receive the
mailed instructions from the
War Department, which 1
presume were mailed to-day,
and which should arrive here
the last of the week. I have
notified the War Department
as to the needs of the Na
tional Guard, and they know
from Captain Carrington's re
ports, that are on file there,
in what we are lacking.
"In forty-eight hours from
the time I receive instructions
the guard can be mobilized at
any point to be mustered into
service. Should the exam
ination which every man is
required to pass deplete the
guard to any extent the re
quired number of men can be
readily supplied from the ap
plications of volunteers who
are anxious to serve.
"As to the disposition of
the men after they have been
mustered into service I know
nothing, for they then pass
beyond my control.
"The call does not ask for
any cavalry, and we have no
artillery. In this case I shall
supply the men to man the
batteries and the Government
must furnish the guns. The
cavalry will no doubt be the
ones who will be turned into
artillerymen. After the en
tire National Guard has been
utilized then, and not until
then, will arise the question
of enlisting and organizing
volunteers. lam empowered
to appoint in the volunteer
service officers from colonel
down to lieutenant, but I
have not yet considered the
question. I have made no
appointments, nor will I do
so until 1 hear from the War
Department.
"The people must under
stand that when I call out the
National Guard it is done so
by a request, and, in the prac
tical sense of the word, they
are also volunteers, and the
power of appointing their offi
cers is mine. We will be pre
pared for war when the Gov
ernment's orders come. In
October Captain Carrington
filed with the War Depart
ment a complete report show
ing what the National Guard
required to entirely equip it
for sixty days' service, and we
also have filed at Los Angeles
reports showing what the
National Guard had in the way
of equipments at that time.
About three weeks ago re
ports were filed with the Ad
jutant-General showing abso
lutely everything necessary to
equip the Guard, so I am pre
pared to and have informed
the Government exactly what
are our needs. I have done
all that is required of me and
California's troops are ready.
"Under the present call it
is impossible to use more
than half of the officers of the
National Guard. 1 am not
prepared to say what dispo
sition will be made of the re
mainder. Until orders are re
ceived from Washington
nothing will be done.'-

FIGHTING FOR
THE WAGES
OF SIN
A Fortune Is Left by
an Habitue of the
Tenderloin.
Her Rents Amounted to
Nearly $1000 a
Month.
She Was Young, Beautiful and
Very Lavish With Her
Money.
GAVE AWAY THOUSANDS.
An Old Mother in France Is the
Main Contestant of Her
Will.
Now there fs to be a contest for the
possession of an estate loft by the late
Celestlne Glmonet, a woman of the ten
derloin wlin committed suicide on the 6th
day of December last by inhaling gas. A
Coroner's jury brought in a verdict
accordingly.
The woman was found dead on the day
mentioned in her apartments on the cor
ner of Pine and St. Mary's streets, and
a will was subsequently discovered in
which Anna Bouygues, a simple acquaint
ance and no relative, was named as the
principal devisee and legatee.
As the deceased left a mother in France
and a sister here, a contest has been
filed by Attorney P. F. Benson, of
the Mills building, in which he sets
forth that the estate is worth more than
$10,000, and that the will in question was
obtained through fraud and undue in
fluence.
The lawyer has obtained the power of
attorney from the mother of deceased,
who resides In Agenonily, I,es Chapliens,
Department Uu Cher, France, and also
from Mrs. Louis Fau, a sister residing in
this city, on the corner uf Sacramento
and Mason streets.
Celostine Gimonet was remarkable for
her beauty of face and figure, and es
pecially noted for her extravagant habits.
Her books Bhow that her rentals
from disreputable places on St. Mary's
amounted to about $900 on
the average, which money sh<Â» lavished
mi certain favorites during her drinking
spells, which were periodical.
\ ' 'â  days before her death her sis- :
. .-. Bhe gave Il.mlI I . ml BoudJn a Fret., ii
man. $2400 in cash, with which he skipped
out to Franco. It is also alleged that
deceased had a great deal of jewelry
which cannot now be accounted for. She
had valuable diamond rings and several
garter clasps Bel with j.rt-.ious stones
which were estimated to be worth hun
dreds of dollars.
Jt is asked that the will in favor of
Anna Bouygues be canceled and set aside
That instrument is dated July 15, 1897
and makes George T. Knox, the notary'
executor without bonds.
The complaint says of the legatee, that
she is "a woman of lewd and dissolute
habits, and known to be the associate of
notorious characters, lewd and abandoned
persons." And also that Anna Bouygues
knew deceased was not of sound "mind
and Indulged in the excessive and intem
perate use uf Intoxicating drinks mor- j
phine and other drugs mentally Incapad- i
tating her from making a will or proper
ly distributing her property, and on the
date of said purported will attempted to
commit suicide, and while in said condi
tion of mind and body the said \nna
Bouygues visit.-.] her daily, against the
wishes <>f deceased, and poisoned the
mind of said deceased against her mother :
and relatives, through connivance arti
fice, fraud, deceit, coercion and undue in
fluence, and did often ask the said de
censed to sinn over her property to her
at the same time advising her to keep
away from her sister and brother-in
law."
At the time of her death Celestlne was
not 30 years of age. When It tx
known to her that the places on St
Mary's street were to be dosed by the
police she paw that her large income
would be reduced to nothing, and it was
then that she went on a violent dt-bauch
that ended In suicide.
There is about SnOOO to her credit in
bank, which, together with other proper
ty and lease holdings, will run the estate
up to nearly $20

COMING TO AN ANCHOR.
The British ship Olenard arrived from Calcutta yesterday and sailed into port. When off Alcatraz she came
to an anchor, but as three of the men were sick from drinking the water taken aboard in India the doctors de
cided to put the vessel in quarantine until the water could be got rid of. The Glenard's anchor had to be hoisted
again, much to the disgust of Captain Turner, and the vessel was then towed to the quarantine grounds.
terday attached in various sums amount
ing to about $10,000. Attorneys Rothchild
and Ach have levied the attachments,
and steps will be taken to recover the
moneys due and payable. Dunlap & Co.,
wholesale hatters of New York City, are i
the principal creditors. The amount of
their bill will amount to $4200. whereas
local linns have amounts in the neigh- ,
borhood of $15ih). Klein, Strauss & Co. i
will receive the greater portion of the !
amount paid in after the business is sat- j
isfactorily settled.
Two notes were also given by the hat- j
ter on the London, Paris and American
Kank. The amount is included in the at
tachment, and one action will probably
be taken with all. parties as complain^
ants. But a short time ago. Morris Col
man, a brother of Charles, took his own
life, and at the time no reason could be
found for the self-murder, but it is now
supposed by many that financial difficul
ties led to the act. Since the death of
Morris Colman the business has seemed
to move along on the same basis main- ;
tamed prior to his death, but for some ]
cause or other money has been frequent- i
ly applied for by the surviving partner, !
which has resulted In the present status '
of affairs.
When Mr. Colman was seen yesterday
be stated that he was not aware of any
reason why his place of business should
be attached, and hoped that within a few
days all would be satisfactorily settled. I
He claimed to know nothing of the mat- j
ter. even pretending ignorance of the j
names of his creditors. "I know noth- |
ing"," he said, "as I have been so nervous :
and upset since I have learned what
movement was being taken."
A meeting of the creditors will soon be i
held, and It is possible some arrange- j
meats will be made to allow the dealer to
proceed with the business, as for many '
years the firm had carried on a large lo
cal and outside trade, and heretofore had
made payments agreeable to a large cir- ',
Clti of creditors. The surviving member
Of the firm is wpII known and the report I
of tho attachments being levied created I
quite a stir in business circles.
EJECTED BY HIS WHISKERS.
D. D. Rector, an Old Man, Convicted
of Expectorating in a Car and
Disturbing the Peace.
The ordinance against expectorating in
street cars has been practically a dead

The British ship Glenard arrived from
Calcutta yesterday with a cargo of
jute and gunnies. As she came
from an infected port and three
of the crow were on the sick list,
1 >rs. Hill and Rosenau ordered the vessel
into quarantine. Captain Turner did not
like this proceeding, as he had to take
a towboat to get to an anchorage oft" the
quarantine station. Having a. fair wind,
he hand been able to sail Into port and was
in hopes of escaping the services of a tug,
but he was disappointed.
Quarantine Officer Hill says there is
nothing serious the matter with the men
on the Glenard and that the vessel will
only.be kept in quarantine while the
water she took into her tanks at Cal
cutta is being pumped into the bay and
the vessel fumigated. As soon as that is
done the Glenard will be released and
taken to her dock, where the work of dis
charging will begin at once.
The British ship Port Logan arrived
from Newcastle, N. S. W., after a good
passage, for this time of the year, of
seventy days. The American bark So
noma is now out 10 days. the hark McNear
86 days and the bark Louisiana 78 days
from the same port. They have among
them over 6000 tons of coal aboard, which
is very much needed here just now.
Coal ships will have no cause to grum

The Mare Island tug Unadilla was hard
ly recognized yesterday as she came
through Raccoon Straits. Since her last
visit she has donned her lighting colors
and she now looks like a cruiser on a
small scale. She brought down from the
navy yard a full supply of medicines and
everything necessary tor the hospital on
the Monterey. All the instruments and
appliances for treating the wounded are
now on the coast defense steamer, and
so far as the surgeons are concerned the
Monterey is ready for a brush with the
enemy at any moment.
S. B. Matthews, the popular superin
tendent of the Alaska Packers' canneries
at Karluk, has been a very sick man.
For the cast three w"eeks he has" been
in St. Luke's Hospital, but is now slowly
recovering, and his many friends on the
front hope to see him out again in a
few days.
Lewis Anderson & Co., as a firm, has

so, and he ought to know. "William

owner of the vessel," said Mr. Anderson
yesterday, "and he has entire control of
her. While some of the members of the
firm of Lewis, Anderson & Co. may be
shareholders in the Belvedere, still as a
firm, Lewis, Anderson & Co. have no
more to do with the whaler than you
hayÂ«.
"Therefore, when George F. Tilton,
third mate of the Belvedere, came to me.
after completing his perilous trip from
Point Barrow. I referred him to Mr.
Lewis. Later I advanced him $50 on
William Lewis' account, and that gentle
man is charged with the amount on our
books. I treated Tilton courteously
through all our negotiations, and person
ally I did everything possible for him,
but, nevertheless, Mr. Lewis refused to
go beyond the $50, S o what could I do?
Xow I want to state again, and that most
emphatically, that the firm of Lewis, An
derson & Co., as a firm, has nothing
whatever to do with the steam whaler
Belvedere.
While Tilton is left without a cent and
has to depend upon his friends. Walker,
fifth mate of the Orca. is living on tne
fat of the land. Tilton's journey from
l'oint Earrow over 4uOU miles of ice and
snow to Sitka was far more dangerous
than that of Walker up the Mackenzie
River, yet when civilization was reached
Tilton could not get a cent from the own
ers of his vessel, and had to hypthecate
his personal effects in order to reach San
Francisco; and he may still have to go
to law to recover his own. When Walker
reached civilization the Pacific Steam
Whaling Company sent him his transpor
tation and a credit for $100 to bring him
to San Francisco. Yesterday Manager
Griffith, on behalf of the company, pre-
serited him with a check for $1000, and
also Rave him the command of one of the
company's fleet.'

the Grain Case.
Upholds Master in Chan
cery Freeman at All
Mooted Points.
Corporation Methods a Fit Sub
ject for Inquiry and Material
to Matters at Issue.
HOW MONEY IS SPENT.
ThÂ« Injunction Swept Away and
Taking of Testimony No Longer
Blocked.
Through a decision rendered by United
States Circuit Judge Morrow yesterday
the Southern Pacific road suffered a de
feat, which in its effect is of great Im
portance to the public as well as to the
company. The decision relates to grain
rates and comp'etely overturns the con
tentions of the company. In attempting
to prevent the Railroad Commissioners
from putting in force a freight schedule
determined upon by them, and materially
reducing the existing schedule, the South
ern Pacific had secured an injunction. In
the answer of the corporation, and serv
ing as a basis for the injunction, were
fifty-one exceptions. These were directed
against the report or A. C. Freeman, act
ing as special Master in Chancery. Not
only is Mr. Freeman sustained at every
point by the decision of Judge Morrow,
but it enters into detail.
All the facts to which the Southern Pa
cific excepted the Judge holds to be mate
rial and relevant, this being exactly con
trary to the views expressed by counsel
for the company. These facts of them
selves possess an interest. They include
many allegations of the manner, in which
the money of the concern has been ap
plied. They include the statement that
large sums have been paid to influence
State and Federal officials, these sums be
ing charged ii> the operating expenses,
and. of, courS?, affecting the cost of traf
tlc which the shipper is obliged to bear.
The court held this to be a proper sub
ject for consideration by the Commission,
mid entitled to due weight In the fixing
of rates by that body. Under the same
head came the funds devoted to prevent
ing competition from other roads, and the
amount used in paying English stockhold
ers a dividend as ;i concession It was un
derstood that this last payment was arbi
trarily made as a matter of policy, and
did not represent earnings suclt as'would
naturally have been employed for the
purpose. All these rattersr atters It had been
sought to exclude, and none of them is to
be excluded. Such Is the sweeping effect
of the Morrow decision.
Police Transfers.
Chief Lees yesterday made the follow
ing transfers: Sergeant Bernard Mc-
Mamis to lake charge of the China
town squad, relieving Serg-eant Shea; and
Policeman R. L. Ingham from the Cen
tral police station to the Harbor station.
James H. Anderson, the newly appointed
sergeant, was assigned to Sergeant Spil

rided whore to send Sergeant Shea, who
has made an enviable record while in

"I have used Ripans Tabules and they have done me lots of
good, at least ray wife says they have," asserts William Donaldson,
a blacksmith. "After a hard day's work I would eat too much, I
guess," continued he, "and suffer like everything. My wife's brother
told me that Ripans Tabules had helped him and he thought they
would help me. I believe they have cured me, but I still take them
regular, for I would not have them pains again for anything. My
partner said, after I was so much better, that I was ready to get well
anyhow, and that I would have got well without them. I believe
there are lots of people that are ready to get well just like I was.
They will get weli when they take the same medicine I did, and not
before. I have worked hard all my life, first on a farm and then in a
blacksmith shop, and have been troubled with dyspepsia ever since I
was 1 8 years old. Now I feel like I was sweet sixteen. I think
Ripans Tabules are a great medicine."

BOURDON WAS
QUIETLY BURIED
One of the Mildest Celebrations
Ever Held on the
Campus.
No Rushing, No Anti-Spanish Dem
onstration, No Burning of Butcher
Weyler.
BERKELEY, Anrll 23.â At least 4000
spectators thronged the university cam
pus thia evening to witness the Bourdon
burial celebration of the freshman class.
The Bourdon was the first to l><- held un
der the "no-rushing" regime, and was one
of the mildest celebrations ever held on
the campus.
The freshmen spent nearly $500 <~>n thHr
Bhow and a generous display or fireworks
made up the "grand spectacular" which
the freshiea had promised. Ancient
and <;atcÂ«-lls from the SOphomon
traded somewhat from the effect oi the
oratory which the "SpieJerati" hurled at
the spectators.
The sophomores and a number of upper
claÃsm< ii had arranged to have an "anti-
Spanish" celebration after the close of
thY Bourdon.
President Martin Kellopg, however,
upon hearing of the proposed celebration,
issued an order forbidding it, and noti
fied the university police force and the
town officers to quell any attempt of the
kind. The plan of burning Weyler in
efflgy was accordingly abandoned and the
itors were compelled to limit the
expression of ;heir patriotism f o th>- sing
iriK of "America" and "The Star Spangled
- r." The "Splelerati" who took
leading parts in the celebration were: C.
C. Cobb, R. S. Pierce, .J. li. Southard. R.
W. Tully, M. H. Schwartz. J. W. S. Bul
ler, S. A. Williams and X. G. Guiberson.
JUDGE COFFEY'S ROBBER.
A Well-Known Criminal Captured
Through His Watchfulness.
When Judge J. V. Coffoy Bided the
police in the rapture of John ('lurk, he
did not know that he was landing a well
known and vicious criminal. As was

liff's rash drawer, and was booked on a
charge of grand larceny.
The ik! ii!</ of Clark had a familiar ring
to Corporal Gelman, who has the police
records in charge, and on examination
he found thai. Clark had been sentenced
to two years in Folsom in October. 1894,
for burglarizing a tailor shoo. On his
release he tried his hand at till-tappine
and was again captured. This time ho
was sentenced to one year in the f'ountv
Jail. During his incarceration he and
other crtmlnala made a daring attempt
to break Jail, which was nipped in the
bud. < lark was liberated only two weeks
ago. iÂ»ut the criminal instinct again as
serted itself, and again he. is in the toils
As he had been sentenced for the same
crime before, the charge of grand lar
ceny was changed t<> petty larceny, sec
ond offense, which constitutes a "felony
He will accordingly receive a stiff sen

REPLIED TO
INGERSOLL
j Rev. John P. D. John on "Did
Man Make God or Did
God Make Man?"
D >iivers the Address Before a Large
Audience In the Howard-
Street Church.
Last evening in the Howard-street
church Rev. John. P. .D. John delivered
his well-worded lecture entitled, "Did
Man Make God, or Did God Make Man?"
The church was well tilled, although
many of the members of the Epworth
League have returned to their homes. The.
lecture was given especially for the bene
fit of the league and though the entire
address carries conviction with it the
treat offered many was not taken advan
tage of. .
As is well known the lecture was pre
pared by the divine in answer to Colonel
Robert Ingersoll, ami according to all re
ports a rejoinder has never been made.
It is admitted even by Ingersoll himself
that Rev. John P. D. John is the first
speaker who has not as yet attacked his
personalities n<>r attempted to .throw
down his arguments with sarcasm, but
to thf contrary has attempted to the best
of his ability, admitted to be considerable,
t" bring history and belief to bear on the
subject which seems so vital to many. As
a well-known writer has stated, it is the
difference of opinion which makes horse
racing, arid it is admitted by lngersoll
that a difference of opinion is refreshing,
especially when that difference is argued
ami an attempt made to show that each
one is right when the attempt is made in
a properly conducted discussion.
The sp> aker showed considerable force
of character and strength, coupled with
eloquence.. Those who heard the remarks
were well pit as< â !, and from beginning
to conclusion the speaker was heartily
apnlauded. Last evening the Epworth
League practically disbanded until the
meeting which will be held the coming
year.

the other. K< lly Is a relative of Curten's,
and familiarized, himself with the sur

of their tank. Lumber .and shingles dwin
dled under the unerring measurements
of Experts Holt, Campbell and Rickard
to such an extent that in several in
stances less than -a third of Â»he quantity
the city has paid for was disclosed. A
few. items of lumber had disappeared as
completely and mysteriously, as a coin in
a prestldigitateur's hands.
A notable ease was unearthed at the
Pacliic Heights school, where the city
had paid for 6000 feet of 2 by 6 and 4275
feet. of 2by 8 redwood piariking, but the j
most diligent starch failed to reveal !
where a single loot of either had been !
used. This kind of lumber costs the city
J7 74 per thousand, a. total of $77 52 which
the city has paid for but never received.
In -this connection it may be stated that j
2 by 8 redwood makes excellent ceiling i
joists, and 2 by 6 the best kind of floor-
Ing joists, just the kind of lumber that!
could be us< d most advantageously by !
Ragan's brother-in-law, O'Brien, in one j
Of his private contractsâ such a job, for]
instance, as that performed on Mission j
street, that The Call found occasion to |
mention a few weeks ago. This may be i
only a coincidence â probably it isâ but '
still the thought comes rorcibly to one !
that John began his Mission street con- j
tract along- in September last, and It was i
Just prior to that time that this lumber!
was charged up against the city.
Since last Friday, when the committee!
of the Grand Jury started in on its in- '
vestlgatiori, some strange rumors have !
reached the members to the effect that !
the store house of the School Department
was to be stocked with lumber in sum- !
dent quantities to correspond with that I
which has disappeared, and the claim '
made that the surplus from repairs at the
various schools had been stored for fu- i
ture use. Basements of school houses, !
according to these whispers, were also to '
be stocked, those responsible for the !
deficiency hoping by this means to out- I
wit the Grand. Jury.
To guard against such a move the first
step of the. committee yesterday was to
effectually check anything of the kind.
Mfessrsi Truman, Hedger, Bauer and
Bryan, together with the three experts,
descended upon the store house at the
corner of Pine and Larkin streets short
ly alter 9 o'clock yesterday morning, and 'â¢
a thorough search of every nook and
crevice on the piano brought to light six
teen bundles of the cheapest grade of I
shingles, less than 2500, and one small ;
pile Of new lumber containing not more i
than 500 feet. Care will be taken that j
none of the schoolhouses or other places
will be stocked. : i
After finishing the search at the store '
house the party proceeded to the Win- â 
field Scott Primary School on Lombard !
street, between Broderick and Baker.
The exterior of the building: and plank
ed yard were found in wretched condi
tion; The rear of the yard is built up on (
stilts twenty feet above the ground, \
which slopes away to the bay from the
street. The planks were rotten and had
been patched here and there with Inch
boards until a child could hardly run the
length of the yard without tripping half
a dozen times. It seemed almost mirac- j
ulous that the entire flooring has not '
collapsed long before this.
And yet during the past six months the
city has paid for enough lumber that it
has never received to replank the entire
yard half a dozen times over.
The roof of this school was reshingled
during vacation last year, the city being
charged for. 62,000 fancy shingles at $1 90
per thousand. The experts found that
65,000 of No. 2, common, the poorest qual
ity in the market, and much inferior to
the grade the contractor had agreed to
furnish at 9U cents, had really been used.
Two hundred feet of boards used to patch
the fence and front steps was all that
could be found, although J)00 feet are
charged for in the bill paid by the city.
Attention was called to a wonderful
piece of work in the way of patching up
the drainage pipes, but the committee j
had determined to Confine Itself to the j
lumber end of the frauds, so after a cur- j
sory glance at the work, which was fully !
exposed to view, the members hurried on j
to the Sherman Primary, on Union street,
near Gough.
The yard at this school was entirely re
planked last July and a partition fence
built from the rear of the building to the
outhouse. All the material used was sup
posed to be of the best quality and the
city paid the highest price for it, but only
the cheapest lumber to be found had been
used.
As Expert Holt put it, some of the
planking was a poor grade of No. 2, and
some a good grade of firewood.
These are the charges made against the
city and the bill has been paid: 43,320 feet
of *2 by 8, No. 1, planking; 240 feet of 2 by
12 clear; 10,000 feet of 4 by 4 redwood; 3600
feet of 2 by 12 redwood, all at the uniform
price of $7 74 per thousand.
This is what the experts found: 24,7.10
feet of 2 by 8 planking, poorest quality;
no 2 by 12, clear; 5650 feet cf 4 by 4 red
wood, and 1100 feet of 2 by 12 redwood, a
total shortage of 25,660 feet, for which the
city paid $11* 60.
The Spring Valley Grammar, on Union
near Polk, next received the attention of
the inspectors. Here, in addition to the
replanking of the yard, a shed had been
built along the westerly side of the yard
and" some trivial repairs made to the
stairways. The bill for lumber called for
,the following; Oregon pineâ sl,22o feet of
2-inch planking; 410 feet of 2 by 4; SC6 feet
of tongue and groove; 1874 feet of 2 and
4-inch surfaced lumber of varying width.
Redwoodâ l9.soo feet of 4 by 4; 920 feet of
4 by 4, clear; 512 feet of 1 by 8 inch, sur
faced; 3650 feet of IV* by 4 inch tongue and
groove; 278 feet of stepping; 14,000 shin-
Cles.
This is what was found: Oregon pineâ
20,000 feet of 2-lnch planking; 250 feet o?
2 by 4; 60 feet of tongue and groove; 600
feet of surfaced lumber. Redwoodâ 6loo
feet of 4 by 4; 690 feet of 4 by 4 clear; 62
feet of 1 by 8. surfaced; 2724* feet of II I,*1 ,*
tongue and groove; some old lumber used
for the stepping; 8000 shingles. The qual
ity of each sort was the same as that
found at all the other schools, while No.
1 quality had invariably been paid for.
At the Pacific Heights Grammar, on
Jackson street near Flllmore, the last
school visited, the stealing was even
greater than at the other places: For re
planking the yard the city had paid for
this lumber: 30,300 feet of No. 1, 2-inch
planking; 16.260 feet of 4 by 4; 6000 feet of
2 by 6, surfaced; 4275 feet of 2 by 8 sur
faced. This Is what was found: 19,000 feet
of No. 3 planking; 6300 feet of 4 by 4. Not
an inch of either the 2 by 6 or 2 by 8 could
be found. The 4 by 4 cost the city $8 95
a thousand: the other cost $7 74, all be
ing charged as best quality.
The total cost of lumber not delivered
was $2."2 sn. When Ahe difference In the
price of No. 1 and the grade used is con
sidered, the loss to the city is much
greater.
ROBINSON
WILL NOT
COME BACK
The City Prison Cap
tain on His Way
to Alaska.
Rumors of His Intrigue
With a Married
Woman.
Handed Chief Lees His Resig
nation Before Leaving
the City.
EXPECTS TO BE WEALTHY
Judga Tobin Determined Not to Ap
point Sergeant Wolf Hi 3
Successor.
Captain Robinson, who for several
years was in charge of the City Prison,
has tendered his resignation to Chief
Lees. While the latter deni^ th.it
Robinson has severed his connection
with the Police Department, it is reli
ably stated that "Handsome Bill," as
he is known to his subordinates, wiJl
not return to this city.
Several weeks ago Robinson was
granted a fourteen days' leave of ab
sence, ostensibly for the purpose of vis
iting the East and claiming a portion
of the estate left by a deceased rela
tive. It is said on good authority that
Robinson, for some reason, decided to
resign from the Police Department.
After being granted a "leave erf ab
sence" it is claimed he visited the of
fice of the Chief of Police and informed
his superior officer that he would noi
return.
"I am through with police business,"
!he is said to have remarked. "Appoint
| Wolf my successor and I'll be happy."
Wolf is the nephew of the chief, and
i was recently made a sergeant. When
j Lees first learned that Robinson did
i not intend to return he determined to
â  do all in his power to promote his rela
tive to the responsible position of cap
! tain of the City Prison. Judge Tobin,
J president of the Board of Police Com-
I missioners, learned of the game and
I decided to call a halt. When sum
! moned before the president â  of the
| board Lees endeavored to explain his
i action by announcing that Robinson
! intended to return and that his nephew
had been placed In charge of the prison
; temporarily. Since then Lees has
i made no effort to influence the other
Commissioners to appoint a successor
| to Robinson, knowing that Judge To
j bin, although he is confined to his bed
: with la grippe, would bitterly oppose
| the appointment of his relative to the
place.
At the same time, it is claimed Lees
carried Robinson's resignation in his
inside pocket, not allowing even his
most intimate friends to peruse it.
Yesterday afternoon a friend of the
ex-captain received a letter from him,
dated Chicago, in which he said he had
â  resigned and tl.at he was surprised that
Wolf had not been apnointpd his suc
cessor. He wrote that he would shortly
I start for Alaska, and would not return
j to this city for some time.
Why Lees should endeavor to foroe
i the Commissioners to appoint his
j nephew successor to Robinson seems
j strange, to say the least. Sergeants
i Lindheimer. Brown and Bldwell, who
! are attached to the City Prison as desk
sergeants, are far more familiar with
the duties of captain than the pet rela
tive of the scheming Chief of Police.
1 When asked last night if Robinson
I had resigned, the astute head of the de
j partment answered in the negative.
I When questioned he became belliger
| ently indignant and referred the re
porter to ex-Captain Robinson, know
! ing that the latter could not be seen.
A DESPERATE CRIMINAL.
Edward McDowan Steals a Shotgun
and Makes a Daring Attempt
to Escape.
Tempted by a shotgun, which was ly
ing on the sidewalk with other effects
belonging to Joseph P. Garside, of 314
Fremont street, Edward McDowan, a
petty thief, waited his chance and calmly
hypothecated it. Some neighbors observed
his action and informed Mr. Garside, and
the latter reported the theft to the police.
Last evening Policeman Juel saw Mc-
Dowan trying to dispose of the gun in
a pawnshop at Folsom and Third streets.
The policeman placed him under arrest,
and in taking him to the patrol box was
struck a crushing blow in the face by
McDowan, who tried to escape. Juel was
too quick for him, and after an exciting
chase and a hard struggle the desperate
criminal was handcuffed. He was charged
at the City Prison with petty larceny and
resisting an officer.
Burned by Boiling Tar.
Thomas Manion, 1019 Golden Gate ave
nue, was treated at the Receiving Hos
pital last evening for severe burns on the
hand. Manion, who is an employe of the
Spring Valley Water Company, while
working on a water main accidentally
upset a bucket of boillns tar, aad the
contents went over his hand. Quick rem
edies were applied to ease the pain, and,
accompanied by his daughter, he called
at the hospital for treatment. It will be
some time before he can renew his
labors.
Struck by an Electric Car.
Ann Kernan commenced suit yesterday
to recover $10,000 damages from the Mar

LIVING PICTURES
WILL BE THERE
Another Attraction to Be
Presented During the
Masonic Festival.
Mrs. Nathan Schlesinger Will
Preside Over the Booth of
Natural Beauty.
A Meeting of the Executive Commit
tee Was Held Yesterday and.
Details Discussed.
The executive committee of the Masonic
Festival met yesterday in the Claus
Spreekels building and received re
ports from the various sub-com
mittees which had been appoint
ed to decide on the details of general
display. It was the expressed opinion
that sufficient floor space would be found
on the main floor of the Pavilion, and
that the annex might possibly be used
as an overflow for -some of the special
attractions which are being urged by
would-be exhibitors. A plan which in
cluded the occupation of the galleries as
well was considered, but it id probable
that they will not be used.
The Question of decoration came up for
discussion, and there was much unanim
ity of opinipn about it. Charles L,. Pat
ton, the chairman of the executive com
mittee, practically voiced the opinion of
each member when he said: "At this
time it seems to me that there is no doubt
as to whac the prevailing idea in the
general design should be. It is my opin
ion that we cannot make the national
emblems nor the national colors too
prominent. As well as being Masons, we
are all Americans, and I am distinctly in
favor of that being shown in no uncer
tain way at our fete." Without any dis
cussion tills was decided on.
Special trains will be run during the
fete by all the railroads* and from the
discussion had by Chairman Patton yes
terday with two or three of the repre
sentatives, exceptionally favorable rates
are promised.
In addition to the minuet which is to be
danced nightly in the postofflce booth, it
is proposed to add an hour's merriment
at the close of the festival daily. This
meets with a slight opposition, because it
is feared that it might be a slight strain
on the nervous system of the young la
dies who will give practically the whole
of their tjme and attention to the success
of the fete. The majority, however,
were decidedly in favor of a grand ball
on the nisht of the 14th of May.
Mrs. Nathan Schlpsinger, who will pre
side over the booth of living pictures
and theatricals at the Masonic Festival,
has accepted a very pretty design for its
exterior and interior adornment. It
promises to be attractive, not only be
cause of the daily exhibits of natural
beauty which it is destined to enshrine,
and the merriment, the pathos and trag
edy which its well-planned stage is to
provide for the genera! entertainment,
but its fashioning and its decoration will
be decidedly striking. Associated with
Mrs. Sohlesinger are a number of charm
ing young ladies, and as each is spoken
of as a "California rosebud," the popu
larity of this temple of beauty and art
will probably be great.
All of the scenes have not been ar
ranged as yet. but the work is well ad
vanced and rehearsals are had regularly.
The interest taken by the ladies addsâ
as it always doesâ to successful depictions
of life in its various phases.
ALBERT TOOK IN CHINATOWN.
The Prince of Belgium Sees Some of
the Sights and Is Much Im
pressed.
Count Albert of Belgium, otherwise
the scion of Kings and Princes, who
is traveling incognito so as to avoid dip
lomatic complications, has started in to
enjoy himself.
Yesterday he and the Gentlemen who
compose his staff of companions and
caretakers visited the Union Iron Works
in the afternoon and, when the shades of
night had cast their dark mantle over
the city, the Prince and his suite took
in the sights of Chinatown under the
skilled guidance of Chevalier Jules de la
Clerfayt, a gentleman whose shield bears
thirty-two quarterlngs all the time, and
several halves most of the time.
Upon his return the Prince refused to
be interviewed as he could not. in his
present position, speak without commit
ting a serious breach of official etiquette.
It is learned, however, from a source t"hat
is entirely reliable, that, just before re
tiring, His Royal Highness called Dr.
Melis. the court physician, into his sleep
ing apartments and informed that official
that he was much impressed with what
he had witnessed. Dr. Melis was con
siderably worried over the matter, and
at once ordered a light stimulant and
complete rest. This treatment has proved
so efficacious that, at the time of going
to press it was thought all serious dan
ger had passed, and with careful nurs
ing the heir to the throne of Belgium
might be able to pull through.
COULDN'T PAY HIS BENT.
Lack of Money Caused Oscar Forssen
to Take His Life.
While despondent because of the lack
of money Oscar Forssen turned on the
gas Sunday night and was found dead in
his bed last evening,
Forssen had roomed at the private
house of Mrs. Frank Cullirm, 360 Jessie
street, for eight months, and always paid
his rent up to a short time ago. Sunday
he told Mrs. Cu'.lum that he would be
able to settle for his room in a few days,
as he expected money soon. That was
the last time he was seen. The door of
his room was closed all day yesterday,
and late in tho afternoon when Mrs. Cul
lum passed the room she detected tho
odor of gns. The door was broken open
and Forssen was found lying on the bed
fully dressed. The gas jet was turned
on. and paper had been pasted over the
cracks in the door and window.
Nothing is known of Forssen's business,
as Mrs. Cullurn never asked him anything
about himself, and he volunteered no in
formation. He was about 31 years old,
and is said to have a brother living in the
city.
The Case Dismissed.
Frank Murray, who waa arrested on a
charge of vagrancy Sunday night, came
up for a hearing in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday morning. It was discovered
that he was not the party wanted and
the case against him was dismissed.
WATCH.
"Watch your footsteps; you may slip
and injure yourself.
Watch your habits; they may grow
upon you unawares and get beyond
your control.
Watch the tendency of the times. The
world is moving and changing every
day and you cannot afford to be left
behind.
Watch the course of events. It may
mean to you the securing of a fortune
or the loss of what you already pos
sess.
Watch carefully the interests of your
true friends. They are always few in
number, and you cannot do too much
for those who have been tested and
tried.
Watch above all things your health.
It is the most precious possession you
can ever have in this life.
Watch for the first signs of a cold, a
cough, and symptoms of malaria, pneu
monia, or consumption, and bear in
mind that there is but one thing that
can cheek these troubles quickly, and
that is a pure stimulant.
Watch carefully those who try to per
suade you to t: .c false stimulants and
bear in mind that there is but one pure,
scientin'c, medicinal stimulant, and that
is Duffy's Pur^ Malt Whiskey.
Watch the effects which follow the
use of this gre: discovery and you will
find that if taken in time r.nd according
to directions, the annoying symptoms
â which, unless checked, will lead to cer

and you will be by this means restorecj

RUSH OF GRAIN FROM THE NORTH.
'â¢There probably was never before such a
rush of wheat from the sound to California as j
there is just now," saya the- Tacoma Ledger, j
"chiofly a result of the failure of the Call- j
fornia crop this ring. Barley aria Oat ship
ments from this region to California are also
nuite heavy. Three or four almoat exclusive |
cargoes of wheat have been dispatched from
Tacoma to San Pranclaco within the last three
or four weeks. The regular liners have been ;
carrying a great deal of the product. The Pa- j
cllic <%.ast Steamship Company has 4500 tons i
of wheat barley and oats, chiefly wheat, now :
in the warehouaea uf Tacoma awaiting ship
ment to the Golden Gate on its steamers.
Some of it will go on the steamer "Walla Walla, â 
due here to-day from San Francisco, and the
Willamette will be here to-morrow to load 2000 :
tons of grain for the company. The Tacoma
Grain Company will put a part cargo of wheat
In the ateamer Alice Blanchard at Tacoraa to
day for Pan Francisco, and will this after
noon begin loading the steamship Cleveland at
this port with 900 or 1000 tons of grain for the i
same destination. The Tacoma Grain .Com
pany yesterday finished loading the small [
steamer Rival on the lower Bound with wheat :

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK BTOCK MARKET.
NTW YORK, April 2r, âThe market for se- \
eurltles wns Blugjglsh and almost Rtagnant to- |
day. Prices ruled below Saturday's close, and !
while there was a brief pause at one'tlme dur- I
ing the morning; In the downward course, due |
to strength shown by one or two of the In- I
dustrials, the paKPlng tendency of the market
â was practically uninterrupted. The trading was
narrow and professional, and declines really !
represented BOthlnc more than a natural re
action from Baturday*s advance. The supply
of storks continued very limited, holders ap
parently being content t<> hold their property
for higher prices. Neither Is there any very
active demand for stocks at the present level.
The consequence is that the movement of prices
Is rather narrow. There being no genuine d<-
mand for stock and no real i.ressure of liqui
dation, prices naturally lu.Â«e one day what was
rained the day bÂ»fore or sain the next day
what they lorn to-day. There was some sell-
Ing in this market to-day for Lo/idon account,
â which may have represented liquidation by
timid foreign holders. There was some specu
lative activity also, and quite a. wide move
ment of prices In some of the higher-priced
Industrial specialties. Otherwise the market
was In the hands of the room traders. The
waiting attitude of traders Ik likely to con
tinue until the occurrence of some event gives;
a clear Indication of the course or probable
duration of the war with BpatÃ.
The future of the Â»1 tek market Is also de
pendent largely on the course of the money
market. There was nothing In to-day's develop
ment to Indicate accurately what that course
will be. There is some demand for currency
from the interior, Chicago exchange on New
York falling a^aln to-day to discount. There
was a sharp advance in the foreign exchange
rates, demand swrtlag bills rising % per cent.
The bond market was very dull to-day and
prices drifted to a lower level. Total salet),

NEW YORK. April 25.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram Bays: The stock
markets here were steady to-day on the large
receipts of gold, but the close was dull. The
Bank of England to-day adopted a policy of
which I gave you Indication weeks ago, name
ly, for absolutely the first time it raised the
buying price of bar gold above 77s 9d to
77s 9^>d. About Â£500,000 in gold came In to
day. I have reason to believe that probably
a further Â£500,000 of gold will go Into the bank
this week.
The depression at the close was partly con
nected with a Fmall failure, which Is the re
sult of the difficulties of a large speculative
operator in West Australian mines. A meet
ing of the creditors to-day acceated 10s on
the pound.
Spanish 4*s and Americans were compara
tively steady, but dull after improvement. The
unortaintlties of money prospects promise to
bother business for some time. The, New York
money market Is closely watched, especially
the effect of the United States n<-u loan,
which it is believed must cause money rates

NEW YORK WHEAT MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 25.â strongest kind
of war prices raged in all of the grain and
provision markets this morning. Liverpool set
the pace with a sensational Jump of 4M.-'3 1 5V4d
â â  /idvance In wheat quotations, and the bulls on
â  this side, after a week of cringing before the
bear element. Immediately secured the upper
hand and squeezed the shorts to the tune of
oVic a bushel before midday. It was a time of
extraordinary excitement in the local whe:it
pit. Millions of bushels changed hands, and
at times the rlnc was in a Ftate of wild con- I
fusion. The May option leaped to 1 laVfc and |
July Ss%c, the latter, compared with 94?ic at
; the close Saturday. It was well along toward
the noon hour before tho tremendous demand
was satisfied and prices eased off a little from j
the top. Besides the Liverpool strength., the
local bulls were aided by reports that Russia ;
was bhort of supplies and asking big advances |
' for her wheat. The prominence of that coun
: try as a competitor of the United States gav<
: this news great significance. Tho visible sup
i ply decrease of 3,240,000 bushels was twice as
! forge as expected, and also helped the forenoon
strength.
I-ater'ln the day the crowd sold out a part
of Its purchases, causing a cent break from the
top, but renewed closing firmness left final
prices iv<<ssic ne^ higher, near months show
; i Inc the ureatest strength About tfO loads of
I wheat, 160 loads of corn and GSO.OOO bushels of
oats were taken for export at all ports to-day.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
j CHICAGO, April 25.â Sensational advances In
\ foreign and outside domestic markets, a de
crease of over 3,000,000 bushels in the American
visible Wheat supply and small world's ship
ments caused the upturn in Wheat which all
other markets â  followed. Although Liverpool
opening cables to-day quoted Wheat at 3i>4d a
bushel advance, this market displayed a halting
tendency after the first rush of trading, and
throughout the session gave evidence of heavy
liquidation on hard spots. While in the first
half hour of the session Liverpool had risen the
equivalent of 3s4c a bunhel, New York 2V*jC,
Minnesota and Duluth 6c, Chicago In the same

time was only up 2c. The Enelish country
markets showed a gain of 7%c a bushel since
Friday last. Liverpool continued to climb until
the close of the futures showed a grain of 5%
Â©6%c per bushel. Duluth and Minneapolis
added to the bear's torments by reaching a
! point S%c above Saturday's close. This mar
ket finally got started, and from around 92c
rapidly climbed to P3c. May, which had started
only lc higher at $1 15, suddenly jumped with
lc and 2c between trades to $1 30, the highest
price In several years. The Atlantic port
clearances of Wheat and Flour for the day
amounted to 600,000 bushels. The world's ship
ments to Europe last week were 7,413,000 bush
els, afrninst 9,062.000 bushels the week before
and 3.523.000 Â»he corresponding week of LS97.
i Russia supplied 1,808,000 bushels of the total
I compared with 3.240,000 bushels the week of the
i year before. The quantity on ocean passage
I was reduced SSO.OOO bushels laf>t ' week. The
I domestic visible surprised the trade by show
i ing- a decrease of 3,240.000, against a reduction
1 for the same wÂ«-k of laEt year of only 778,000
bushels. The heaviest decreases were at Chl
capo, Minneapolis, Duluth and New York. May
ipped back to $1 17, but rallied to $1 20,
closinsr at $119% sellers, a net cain ofo%e.
After the advance In July to 93c, the market
became very feverish, selling: off to 92c, up to
93% c. down to 92>,;c. then up to 92% c, closing
1 at 92% c. Five minutes after the close 93% c was
paid on the curb for July.
Corn was active and strong throughout the
j session. Sales for export of about 1,000,000
I bushels, an advance at Liverpool of l%c and
2 / 4 - at London were the chief factors. July
closed with a n.?t gain of IVic.
Scarcity of Oats, advances abroad and the
strength of Wheat and Corn helped the Oats
! market early and contributed to an advance
of lT^jC in May and lVie In July.
Provisions were stronz and active. War
j news and heavy outside speculative buying
were the chief factors. The close was near the
top. July pork closed with a net gain uf 45c,

There could not possibly be a whiter
city than Cadiz, unless It were built of
snow. As you near the coast you see in
front of you a white mass which appears
to be floating upon the water, just as you
are. The first thought of a foreigner is
that he is in sight of an iceberg. The
white mass, glittering in the sun and
rendered more dazzling by the blue sea
and sky, looks exactly like a monster Ice
mountain partly melted, so that outlines
of castles and hills appear upon it; but.
only for a second does the illusion last,
for you know there are no icebergs in
that part, and you are quickly informed
that it is Cadiz. No other town in the
world presents such a magic appearance.
The expense attending the marriag-e
of the Prince of Wales was about
Â£41.000.

LULU FREDER
IS MISSING
Friends Fear She Ended Her
Life Because of 111
Luck.
L-eft Home Suddenly and Has Not
Been Seen for a
Month.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, April 25.
The friends of Miss Lulu Freder fear
that inability to procure work has caused
that young lady to do something des
pr-rato, as she disappeared about three
weeks aro from her home in this city
and no information of her can be ob
tained.
Mi.^.s Freder is about 19 years nf age,
and for a long time was employed by the
family nf s. B. Moffett. Whf-n they moved
to Washington Miss Froder was dis
charged, and from that time her period
' : misfortune commenced. She made
every efTort to obtain another situation,
both by her individual search and the
Bf,'.-ncy of employment people, but met
with no success.
About a month ago she took a lady
friend into her confidence, telling her that
phe had been a whole day without a meal
and that the r^nt of her humble quar
ters was considerably overdue The friend
supplied her with half a dollar and from
that Time nothing bad been seen or heard
Â°*w. tl L c t^F 1 ' The despondent muni..: in
Which Lulu spoke to some of her friends
regarding her inability to obtain work
has caused some of them to think that
the half dollar was probably spent in
procuring something with which to end
life, and that the girl has committed sui
cide in such a manner as to permanently
conceal her identity.
Lulu Freder was' rather tall, had light
hair and was of slim build. Much inquiry
haa been ma.de in surrounding towns with
a view to Mndinc out if a girl of such
description has come to any morgue or
police station, but with no success.
NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS.

OAKLAND, April 25. â Company F, !

names and addresses of the others and '
eend for them should they be necessary

completed.
Major Hayes was busy to-night clean-
Ing up battalion affairs, and is ready to
be one of the lirst to r^^pond with his ;
three companies, A and F of this city :

den arrive. Several ladies were engaged I

BAD DAY FOR
EDWARDS DAVIS
The Christian Ministry Refer
to Him in Unmistakable
Terms.
Meeting to Investigate Oharfjes Against
the Pastor Goes Over With Hints
ot Developments.
OAKLAND, April 25.â The investiga

wards Davis by his successor was not
held to-night as announced. After read
ing the declaration of Davis that he
would not attend any meeting so ar
ranged, the pastors of the churches sur-
A ROAST FOR EDWARDS DAVIS.
The Rev. Edwards Davis was spoken of yesterday at the meeting of
the Christian ministers in terms that were anything but complimen
tary. Though no name was mentioned it was understood by all present
that it was the gentleman before mentioned who was referred to.
The meeting began with a notice that at the next meeting a motion
would be made to amend the by-laws bo that the Ministerial Union could
be protected as well as the clergy- themselves. In looking over the by
laws it was found that in them there was no protection for the ministers
In the union, and that no matter how much one of their brethren might
lead the crooked path they had no redress, nor could they even expel him.
This led to a lengthy discussion which ended In George C. Hubbard,
who resigned as elder of the Central Church of Oakland because he dis
approved of the actions of Davis, making a few remarks, stating that It
would be in order for the Christian ministers to request that the repre
sentative paper of that denomination on this coast stop making such
complimentary speeches regarding a man who has been, and still Is, ac
cused of notorious conduct; it was liable, he said, to throw a bad light on
all the denomination. He stated that It had been said, and still is said,
that the people seemed to encourage Davis In his actions, and that he
was given too much consideration.
At this point Rev. W. Berry took the floor and declared It had been
said by many people that the other side had been given too much lenien
cy. He also said that a paper was run by an editor, and what should go
In It and what should remain out was as his wisdom saw fit, and he did
not think It the ministers' place to dictate what should be written. He also
stated that he did not think It would be right to say that the man waa
guilty until his conduct had been passed upon by a judicial body.
Mr. Hubbard stated that while the paper claimed to be the official or
gan of the Christians, It should not make complimentary remarks about
a man who was disgracing the denomination. Mr. Hubbard afterward
acknowledged that he was referring to Edwards Davis.
rounding the bay did not come. They
cent word that they accepted the invita
j tion with the Intention of being present,
j but if nothing more was heard they
: would take it for granted that the meet
> ing was not to be held. As this did not
! reach Mr. Sawyer until half-past 6 to
: night, he had no way of notifying them
; to come on.
Thirteen men and an equal number of
w 'men were present when Mr. Sawyer
made the above announcement and pre
[ pared to leave. They readily followed
j his example. The meting was not called
i to order nor adjourned.
H. B. Griffith announced afterward
that he Intended to say he rep
resented the absent pastor and
I would defend him, but he was
; given no opportunity to make the expla
nation. The investigation, however, will
i not be dropped. This is the declaration
of Mr. Sawyer and a number of his sup
: porters. They claim that they have suf
( ficient evidence to cause Mr. Davis' dis
missal from the ministry for improper
conduct.
Rooney's License Fee Refunded.
OAKLAND, April 25.â At the meeting
of the City Council to-night the ordi
nance ordering the refunding of $1000 to
Owen Rooney, the pier restaurant man,
was finally passed. This closes a long
fight, which has been in the courts for
two years on the point as to where the
city boundary line crosses the mole. The
United States engineers have uecideu
that the restaurant is outside the line,
and Rooney has since been attempting
to collect his license fee paid to the city
under protest.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 26, 1898.
WORKED HARD,
DIED WEALTHY
Pioneer Delger Closes a
Life Uniformly Suc
cessful.
From Repairing Shoes He Be
came One of the Wealthiest
of Oaklanders.
Ha Denied the Oft-Told Tale of
Luck Through a Lottery
Ticket.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 25.
Frederick Delger, who forty years ago
was a humble shoemaker, and who for
nearly half that time has been one of the
wealthiest men in this county, died this
morning, after an Illness of several
months, during which he was often so
near the end that premature reports of
his death were circulated.
The experience of Mr. Delger has been
similar to that of many other pioneers.
Born in Saxony seventy-six years ago,
he came to America in 1547, and five years
later opened a shoestore in San Fran
cisco. Always thrifty and frugal, he ac
cumulated a little money, with which he
made more investments in his business,
until in 1557 he opened a branch store in
Sacramento, and was fast acquiring
wealth.
About 1860 Mr. Delger turned his atten
tion to Oakland, sold out his shoe ven
tures and invested in real estate in this
city. His change of business was due to
i his realization of the fact that while the
I rice of shoes would always remain much
j about the same, the price of real estate
lin a growing- cttv must of necessity In
] crease rapidly. With these Ideas in his
' mind, he purchased ten acres of land on
| Telegraph avenue, between Seventeenth
and Twentieth streets, which he eventually
I subdivided and on which he realized
! large sums of money.
Many old residents of this city who
' knew the deceased well in his lifetime
have circulated for years a story that
Frederick Delger received his first large
sum of money through his wife taking a
lottery ticket in payment of a pair of
shoes. The story is told that Delger did
not at all approve of his wife's method
of financiering, but the next day, finding
c h Ke^s e m?nr r Â° f a bie Prlze ' he
Six years ago Mr. Delger read the. proof
of a short biography of himself, that
was afterward published, and in which
occurs this paragraph: q
J2ul gr 7 at ,, s ccess in accumulating
wealth is founded on no special favor of
Dame Fortune nor any alleged luck in
buying lottery tickets, of which neither
himself nor his wife has ever owned a
single one nor any fraction of one The
phenomenon , (Of . his ac uirln wealth) has
not the faintest tinge of mystery, being
the simple result of a thorough apprecia
tion of the -value of land possession in a
new and growing community. While mak
ing a little money in the humble voca
tion of repairing shoes, and still more in
the business of boot and shoe merchant
he knew that the margin of profit in such
lines was necessarily of afluctuatlDgchar
acter and that the flush times would
not last long, even in California, and
that the only sure thing of steady per
manent and ever-increasing value is
lcLncl.
On both sides of the hay Mr. Delger
made many heavy Investments In real
estate, and all of his speculations were
successful. At the time of his death he
owned several business blocks on Broad
way, besides much stock In local banks
Mrs. Delger and four children are iv
|"Bf.fjÂ» thi -l city> he daughters are Mrs.
Matilda Brown, Mrs. Annie Moller and
Mrs. H. O. Trowbridge. Edward F. Del
ger Is the only son. Some years ago Mr
Delger built In Mountain View Cemetery
a very elaborate mausoleum, and on many
occasions he has spent some hours on
Sunday mornings at the cemetery view
ing the place in which his remains will
be finally placed.

ALAMEDA, April 25.â John Reames

tence. The offense was committed last i
December, and Reames was let out on i
bonds. When the time for trial came he
was not on hand, having gone to Seattle. '
A few days ago he thought it would be
safe to venture back, thinking the af
fair had blown over, but he was rearrest

WHEAT IS
STILL ON
THE WING
Speculators Plunge
Into a Whirl of
Excitement.
France and England Short,
Russia Stops Selling
and War Rages.
Argentine Crops Are Light and
Cables Indicate Higher
Prices.
BARLEY FALLS A LITTLE.
Interesting Details of the Fever
Among Bulls of the Local
Market.
There was more excitement among the
wheat brokers yesterday than on Satur
day, and before the day closed the old
time prices prevailed.
December wheat on the curb, after the
closing session, sold at fl SOVi, a phenom
enal advance of two cents over the regu
lar closing.
Those who attempt to account for the
market attribute the great rise to English
cables and to the shortness of the hold
over supply as well as to the war.
Business opened yesterday with unusu
al signs of life, the exchange rollcall find
ing every broker at his post. There was
a great rush and every siÂ»;n that great
business would be done when the first
Liverpool cables came, -;uoting futures
from two and two and a half pence
higher, with cargoes from three to six
higher and in good demand at the ad
vance.
Liverpool showed a further rise of two
pence at the close, or from four to four
arid a half pence for the day. Paris
showed a sharp advance and private ch
bles confirmed Saturday's report that
Russia had stopped exporting wheat. All
these conditions worked up a strain of
excitement seldom equaled in the Call
Board.
As soon as the caller. H. C. Bunker,
sounded the gong there was the quietness
of death. Brokers were sparring for the
anticipation of others. The crowd wu-i
not long in finding some one to siart the
ball rolling.
K. C. Evans bid $1 71, $1 72. $1 73. $1 74.
1175. then $1 7i> 1 2 for Decemi'er wheat. At
the latter price a few saies were made.
In the excitement $1 77 vraa paaa, this
price against $1 69 on Saturday. There
was considerable wheat for sale at $1 77.
The offerings were greater man the de
mand, the latter coming mostly from
shorts. Within a short space of time the
price had dropped to $1 7o at the decline.
There were round a great many buying
orders. This, together with Chicago ad
vancing, started the market on the up
road again at $176%. The market hesi
tated, however, the buying craze being
found stronger than the selling: pressure.
This time $1 77V4 was reached, wuere the
price rested after the closing morning
session.
At the afternoon s< ssion bull enthusi
asm ..using the price
to reach 1178%, with May $1^:. prices
which have not I ?<>r einht years.
T!.. market closed sirmK at the extreme
top prii i" tli" day. Generally ;; strong
advance like yesterday's brines free n-ai
izinp- orders from those who nave pn.fns.
Not ho yesterday.
The longs. Instead of realizing, added to
their lines ami are talking $2 wheat. In
Buch times of excitement the average
speculator doesn't stop ;â > reason, but
goes madly into the swim of excitement.
The- situation presents one of great
strength. England and France are very
short of wheat Their s'neks are dan
g-erous'.y low. ami th< ir crop prospects are
only fair. Russia has stopped exporting
wl it. Argentine has disappointed im
porters, the offerings from the Argentine
being so small that buyers generally con-
Bider that country out of the market.
Comparing December wheat with the
same option in California it will be found
California December wheat is 3K cents
per bushel higher than Chicago. This dif
ference will almost allow the importing
of Eastern wheat in this market. Surely
wheat as far >...Â»; .:.- Wyoming and Kan
sas can be broueht int.. California at
present differences. Speculation seems
Intoxicated. ;â .;;: â¢ . .â : -, - the result
prices will be carried far beyond where
legitimate conditions wil l Buvtalh them
The pr.-s.'nt price Is probably higher than
facts will warrant, ye\ the bull fever is
on and prices are liable to sro much
higher before they run up against a
stone wall. There is very little argu
ment to offer against a small 'Top, but
one does not want to overlook the fact
that present speculation is discounting no
crops at all. This is where speculators
will find themselves wrong sooner or
later. The wheat plant ts naturally Btrong
and can withstand more than many will
givt it credit for. Th^rr- will In- "some
wheat harvested in <\mfornia regardless
of opiniors to the contrary. Ajrain Ore
gon and Washington crop prospects are
fine. These States ran supply California
n.iilers and yet have a large exportable
surplus. Utah will dud California a good
market for her wheat th-;>. wear. All in ,"11
there seems no g 1 ground to suppose
the people of t!<is State will be deprived
of wheat bread for the next fourte< n
months, for old stock? of wheat arÂ» larger
than generally supposed.
Barley was a surprise to the trade
Brokers asked one another, "What's the
matter with barley?" The matte;- | S bar
ley has been boomed to death, and the
heavy imports of ro,rn nave cut the de
mand fully C"> pel cent, in many sections
75 per cent. There is a great deal of bar
ley which will not pass ('all Board In
spection. yet it meets the requirements of
feeders. The trouble with barley is that
the market is overbought The' country
is long and insiders are short. The action
â  f yesterday's, market would indicate a
condition noj at all favorable to buyers
In the face of n rise of M cents per cental
in wheat barley actual!.- declined 1%
cents, with a heavy faehng " The local
talent nre fearful oi a bf*vy break in the
near future.
The features of yesterday's tradingwere

A NOTABLE
LECTURE TOUR
Miss Helen Kelleher to
Lecture on California
in the East.
One Hundred Principal Cities to
Be Visited Under Auspices
of Southern Pacific.
With the Assistance of Stnte Board
or Trade *nd Other Leading
Trnde Bodie-.
The brilliant success â¢which attended
the illustrated lectures entitled, "Pic
turesque California" and "Semi-Tropic
California," given by Miss Helen Kel
leher throughout California, Oregon,
Washington and Britsih Columbia dur
ing the past year has suggested to uen
eral Passenger Age:.t Goodman of the
Southern Pacific Company the advisa
bility of making similar arrangements
to present the many attr: <. tion;. of our
Golden State to people of the Western,
Middle and Eastern States in a manner
and under such auspices as no other
similar exhibition has ever been con
ducted.
The plan as adopted provides for
Miss Kellcher delivering her new lec
ture on California in 100 of the princi
pal cities of the United States included
in the territory above mentioned dur
ing the months of May, June, July, Au
gust and September next, to be given
under the auspices of the most influen
tial religious, social and charitable or
ganizations of the cities to be visited.
With a view of insuring the best pos
sible results arrangements have been
made with Mr. O. V. Eaton, formerly
assistant registrar at Stanford Univer
sity, to act as advance representative,
canvass the different cities and enter
into agreements with such organizations
as would best give tone and prestige to
the enterprise. Mr. Eaton started on
his mission two weeks ago and has al
roady made some valuable connections,
notably that at Salt Lake City with the
Mutual Improvement League, which
has obtained a special dispensation
from the church authorities to use the
Mormon Tabernacle, and the sale of
7000 tickets for this occasion is already
assured.
This is no ordinary stereoptlcon exhi
bition, as Miss Kelleher ranks with the
best lecturers of the day and in addi
tion to that qualification she is also an
elocutionist and an entertainer of high
standing. The collection of slides which
will be used on this occasion is the
most complete and the best that has
ever been gathered together. They are
all artistically colored and such as .^lave
heretofore been used in Miss Kelleher's
lectures hnve excited great admiration.
The dissolving view electric stereopti
cor., which will be used, is the largest
and most powerful made, reproducing
scenes surprisingly true to nature. Mr.
George W. Reinhardt, recently grad
uated from the University of California,
will act as stereoptician on this trans
continental lecturing tour.
The very favorable conditions under
which this enterprise will be conducted
and fostered cannot fail to interest the
bert people of the East, and by thus
presenting the many attractions and
particularly the resort features of our
great State the tourist and pleasure
travel to California should be largely
augmented.
To th*> Southern Pacific Company,
the State Board of Trade, Manufactu
rers' and Producers' Association, Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce and
others belong the credit of inaugurat
ing this most worthy enterprise.
THE WOMAN AS
A MINISTREL
A Burnt Cork Performance to
Be Given at Native Sons'
Hall.
The Novelty of the Affair Is Attract
ing the Attention of Theater
Goers.
The latest novelty in the way of enter- I
talnment is being prompted by philan- |
. thropical women, who, although Cauca- '
plans, and of high social standing, will \
cover their beauty and their dimples, put â 
putty over their eyes and rouge on tlx-irrf
â¢fosr that they may be better fitted to
shake the hand of Belinda Jones and
| Parson Johnson at the minstrel show this* '
; evening on the stage of the Native Sons"
Hall in aid of St. Patrick's grand bazaar.
This will mark the first time in the
recorded history of the city when women i
â  have undertaken to shine as "end men" |
, and draw up in the ancient semicircle
to address the inimitable conversational
ist, known as the interlocutor, for the
.' edification and amusement of an audi- j
I ence.
The object of the performance, although
for charity, is a peculiarly novel one, and
for this reason alone will attract hun
dreds through curiosity to the show.
The minstrels will be under the aus
pices of the ladies of the Golden West
booth of St. Patrick's bazaar, and under
the immediate direction of T. Eggert the
popular and well-known minstrel man
ager.
Jack Cathcart and B. F. Hanlon, made
familiar to the ti* ater-goihg public by
the appearance of their names upon
minstrel programmes in the past have
volunteered their services to Instruct the
ladies and initiate them into the myster
ies of burnt cork and artificial wigs and
will do all in tht-ir power to help attain
the noble object upon which the enter
tainment and the bazaar itself is based.
This purpose is to remodel the tottering
edifice on Mission street, one of the oldest
churches in the city, and by repairs and
the necessary improvements, put it in a
condition of decency which it justly de
serves.
The final dress rehearsal was given last
evening in the hall on Mason street, and
in every detail proved a success, the
jokes being given smoothly and evenly
and the specialties being acted with con
siderable ability.
The minstrel troop consists of the fol
lowing artists:
Interlocutor. Miss Aggie Hoyne; tam
bos, Misses Mamie Wells, Jeannette Fin
nic, Mamie Shcohan and Annie Oakes
bones. Misses Jessie Finnic, Klttie Mc-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 26, 1898.
SHE LIVED AND
DIED A HERMIT
Catherine Hem, After Ten
Years' Seclusion, Ex
pires in Solitude.
Her Husband, Hans, a "Pris
oner of Love," Now Left,
Indeed, Alone.
A Mystery of South San Francisco
Shot With Gleams of Pa
thetic Devotion.
For the past ten or eleven ynzn a
little house at 1201 Sixteenth aven'te,
down at Bay View, has been a source of
unsatisfied curiosity to the people In
South San Francisco. Hans and Cather
ine Hem have lived there and with no
exception not another person has ever
set foot inside the place. The front gate
has been nailed up. The front door was
never opened. The windows were barred
and the shutters were always closed.
Exit and entrance to the mysterious lit
tle house was always by way of the cel
lar in the back, whence steps lead to the
kitchen above.
But on Friday Catherine Hem diedâ
died alone in the little house while her
husband was away. She had been ailing
for a week, but this fact had not altered
the manner of living of the strange Ger
man coupleâ which was to live as though
no other people existed in the world. For
ten years no one hnd seen or spoken to
Catherine Hem. She had no friends; she
talked to no one, but dwelt in a strange
sort of solitude alone with her husband.
Hem himself had grown to love the taci
turnity. Of late years all his small busi
nesa affairs were transacted through a
frank-faced young grocer on Fifteenth
avenue, whose respect for the strange
reserve of the peculiar solitary German
had won Hem's confidence.
Twice a year, or sometimes only once,
letters came to Hem, sent in care of the
grocer, and these contained remittances
from Germany. But the notification Hem
should have received from the bank last
January had not arrived, and on Friday
the Queer old German walkedâ he never
took a streetcarâ from Bay View, ten
miles, to the bank. In his absence Cath
erine, his wife, died. She must have ex
pired in great pain, for her limbs were
distorted with the agony of her death,
and the old bed on which she layâ a
home - made contrivance composed of
knitted cords shaped into bags and then
stuffed with grassâ was worn hare by the
death struggles of the lonely, suffering
woman.
Hem discovered that his wife was dead
when he came back from his long, un
availing tramp. He had no money to bury
this loved companion of his solitude, but
the strung, enduring habit of ail those
past, long, silent years even at a time
like this was the ruling passion. He
went to the one man lie felt he could
trust. But the grocer was out taking or
ders. So Hem, with the sorrowful knowl
edge within him, walked back again to
Bay View. There he met the grocer and
told him that Catherine was dead.
Through this man arrangements were
made with the Coroner, who sent for the
body.
It was this occurrence that for the first
timt- in a decade forced open the curious
little house in which these two have
dwelt in silence and solitude so long.
There was no bed in the house. Both
slept on the floor, on these grass-tilled
Ba< ks of the German woman's manufac
ture. The front room was absolutely
bare. In the kitchen were the barest ne
cessities, and the room where the wife
died contained a chair or two and these
sacks of grass. But there were books,
many of them. And this fact makes peo
ple who knew the Hems in better days
recall the i'act that Hans Hems German
is pure and absolutely correct; that his
business dealings have been those of a
scrupulously honest man; that his writ
ing and his manner of speech have al
ways been those of a cultivated gentle-
mas.
The gossips are trying to account for
the peculiar lives of these two. They say
that Hem is well connected in Hamburg,
whence his remittances come, and tnat a
family quarrel has estranged Him from
his people there and from tne world. The
most probable story is the other version
that the awful curse of insanity rests
upon the Hem family. A son and a
daughter are inmates of an asylum now.
Another son attempted suicide once not
long ago in front of tne City Hall, and
Hans Hem's iirst born succeeded in tak
ing his own life. Since that time these
two old people have lived in a solitude
almost as complete as though they lived
in Fahara Instead of San Francisco. And
there are rumors that poor, lonely Cath
erine Hem succumbed, too, to the mental
ma lad'- and then Hans, in addition to
the housekeeping cares, had the burden
of a weak minded wife.
llnng Hem has been a character down
in South San Francisco for years. Slight.
short, pale, with long dark hair and
beard fast growing gray, wearing white
gloves of that same knitted cord that
Catherine had used for the sleeping bags
and even for curtains in the queer little
plac. carrying upon his shoulder the
sucks full of provisions he preferred not
to have delivered at his place, he pre
sented an interesting figure. Once even
he appeared upon the street with his
trousers covered with that same white
network, which seemed to be a passion of
the dead woman. But he was never rao
lested. Once the butcner. when he cut
the dollar's worth of meat Hem bought
weekly, asked casually. "Well, how's the
family?" Hem never went oack there.
And once a shop keeper asked him what
part of Germany he came from.
"1 do not ask you where you come
from," he answered gravely. "That is my
own business."
After that he forswore all but the dis
creet, kindly grocer. Through him his
rent was paid, through him he communi
cated with the world when it was abso
lutely necessary. Of late years Hem has
refused to receive letters. So the letters
have ceased coming:. When the water
bill was due the collector coming over
the neglected yard where the grass grows
thick would find the door opened just long
enough for a hand to pass out to him the
dollar owed. He didn't know whether it
was a man's or a woman's hand. Not a
word was spoken and the transaction was
repeated month after month. The front
door never opened. The back door opened
only to the grocer. You may go down to
Hay View to-day, and you may knock
till you're weary, but the Htcle cottage
will remain quite quiet, seemingly unoccu
pied. Even in his dealings with the one
man he trusted Hem was as laconic as
possible. He would bring to the store a
correctly written invoice with the articles
and prices. He would nod a good morn
ing to the proprietor, present his invoice,
pay his bill and leave. Though their
house was so unfurnished, the odd couple
permitted themselves some small luxu
ries. Hem would brine home beer and
wine, and he enjoyed a cigar. He never
accepted the smallest favor. He never
demurred at prices.
The grocer has generously offered him
credit till the delayed remittance shall ar
rive, lie is confident that the debt will be
repaid.
All this strange man asked of the world
was that he should be left alone. This
wish has now been granted more fully
than he expected. For the death of his
wife has left the man pitifully alone. He
wept bitterly when her body was taken
from the Strange home, but he did not
come up to San Francisco to see his com
panion put into her grave. The thought
of the curious eyes and tongues he would
meet was too great an ordeal. So Cath
erine was buried in the city and her hus
band shut himself up in the solitude of
the strange house. He will continue to
live there, he has to.d the one man to
whom he will speak. The only difference
will be that Bay View will have one her
mit instead of two, but imagine the lone
liness of bereft Hans Hem.
SNATCHED HER BANKBOOK.
Mrs. Mary Behrlnger of South San
Francisco Causes a Commotion
on McAllister Street.
Mrs. Mary Behrinper. who lives In
South San Francisco, caused a commotion
on McAllister street near the Hibernia
Bank yesterday afternoon by uttering v
piercing scream and falling to the side
walk in a fit. She was carried into a
house, and soon recovered. A man was
seen running away from her. but the
people were too much interested in n>?r
case to give any attention to him, and he
escaped.
Mrs. Behringer hurried up to the Cen
tral police station and complained that
she had been robbed of her bankbook with
the Mifccrnia Bank. She said she and
her husband had been having trouble and
they wore living apart. They had money
deposited in the bank in their joint names
and she retained possession of the bank
book.
She was on her way to the bank when
a friend of iier husband named Bulger,
a saloon-keeper in Butchertown. met ncr
near the bank and snatched the book out
of her hand. She screamed, and he ran
away. Then she fainted.
She was escorted to Judge Joachimsen's
court, w ii ere she swore to a complaint
charging Bulger with grand larceny.

DEVANY TAKES
A FLING AT
MAYOR PHELAN
Declares That He Is Not an Expert
in the Art of "Hefting"
Sacks of Money.
Another Step Made Toward Extracting
Money From the City Treasury for
the Proposed Monkey Ranch
in the Mission.
Even the war, with nil its attendant
sensational reports of Impending battles
etui captures of prizes; could not keep
the loMiy and gallery <>f the Board of Su
pervlsors' chambers from being crowded
1" its capacity with Interested eiUzt-ns,
who cam<' to listen, to protest and to ad
vocate. Th>> subjeci under discussion was
the proposed Mission park and zoological
garden, aa ii has been grandiosely termed
by th.jsi' who are endeavoring to unload
upon the city a "gold brick" in the real
estate line.
After a free-and-easy discussion be
tween the Supervisors and a number of
citizens, which lasted for more than three
lM'.irs, another blow was struck the
vetige that is designed to break open the
city treasury for th^ extraction of a sum
of money that will not be less than a
Quarter of a million dollars. The resolu
tion instructing the City Attorney to be
gin condemnation proceedings t<> acquire
.iiids that are alleged to be necessary
tor the establishment of the projected
monkey ranch In the Mission was adopted
by the following vote:
Ayes â Devany, Haskins, Delaney,
Sheehan, Dodge, Kottanzi, Morton,
Britt, Rivers. Total, 9.
Noesâ Smith, Clinton. Total, 2.
Lackniann asked to be excused from
voting and his request was granted.
While the debate was In progress there
was ;i hot exchange of words between E.
I. E. Troy and Supervisor Sheehan, ;
which might have become something !
Berl i us were It not for the prompt j
and energetic intervention of the Ber
t-at-arms, who held Mr. Troy in his
sÂ«ai. Supervisor Clinton also gave -some.
to the proceedings by referring to 1
roposition as a "clean steal."
But this was not the only matter that
enlivened yesterday's session of the
b iard.
Supervisor Devany. as a member of
Lnance Committee, treated the mem-.
hers of the board and the large assem
to a timely and very
amusing dissertation <m the art of "heft
using the Mayor as a living illustra
tion of what constitutes,:!, failure in that
te profession, f articular reference
whs made to his Honors method and ex
perience in "hefting" the money BSjcks In
the vaults of the City Treasury. The
Mayor did not enjoy the manner in which
he was used to point the essay.
As an evident preliminary to bringing
a mandamus Miit against the board, the
Mutual Electric Light Company presented
a petition demanding that it be granted
the same privileges in the erection of
â  inside the city llniits that had al
ready been granted to its rival, the San :
Franc Electric Company.
The petition was referred to tfie Street
CommU
By the vote of the seven members then
in their seats, and without a dissenting
the Mayor's veto on the resolution
awarding the contract for the "repair"
of Third street, between Mission and
rd, t.i Flynn <fe Treacy, was bus
talned. This is one of th<? "jobs" that The
t'a.l I XDOSed. The action taken by the
. to-day will r ;uv the city about
$1200. Flynn & Treacy had been awarded
mtract for $2100, notwithstanding
.1. .1. Dowling had offered to do the
work lor $900. Dowling. on a trilling pre
text, had 'oeen allowed to withdraw his
i Id bit:.i t :. mmittee.
In the ab seiiei of the Mayor. Supervisor
an was called to the. chair, but dur
ing the debate on the monki y ranch prop
osition the Mayor entered and took his
p"st of duty.
After bids had beÂ«n opened and read for
furnishing BUpplies and services to the
various city and county institutions the
resolution authorizing the City Attorney
to begin condemnation proceedings
against the owners of the lands to be
used for the education and maintenance
Of monkeys, goats and similar zoological
specimens was brought up as unfinished
business. All the Supervisors were pres
ent.
Clinton mnved that the matter be post
poned until the Brat regular meeting of
the bonnl after May 26. He asked for the
postponement, he raid, because he wanted
ti> I. ring out a full expreslon of the
peopleâ not only of the people of the Mis
sion l>m of the entire city. He declared
that he thought it was the almost uni
versal sentiment of the people of the Mis
sion that no park was necessary In that
district at this time. He wanted the mat
ter deferred until after the charter elec
tion, as If that Instrument was adopted
the Board of Public Works would pass
upon the proposition. The motion was
lost, only Dodge. T,aekmann, Rottanzl,
Smith and Clinton voting for it.
Devany moved the adoption of the reso
lution.

efforts made by the l>.-st people of the

consummation of the purchase. "'Why are

project its origin? The scheme was con
cocted In a down-town lawyer's office,
whore about a dozen men were present,
about ;i year ago. I have- been informed
that they bonded this tract and some ad
joining land to a certain real estate apont
(or $300,000, yet an attempt is beinp made
to sell to the city a p;trt of this tract tor
$387,000." He asserted that the money
asked for the purchase of this tract
could be much better used for the erec
tion of schoolhouses, for the paving- of
streets, for a new hospital and for im
proved Bewerage, and added that not less
than $200,000 would be required for the
maintenance and improvement of the
land. He paid a tribute to The Call for
its stand in the Interests of the people
and the taxpayers. c stated that the
owner of The Tall was a resident of the
Mission and a large property-owner in
that district, yet he was opposed to the
zoo. "We are about to face the hardest
year since 1564." he continued, "and it
should be the duty of every member of
this board to keep the appropriations to
the very lowest flpure. This is not a time
to waste the public money by spending it
for a monkey and parrot pleasure ground.

PHELAN A POOR HEFTER.
Devany Says the Mayor Is Far From
Being an Expert in That Line.
It having come to the knowledge of a minority of your finance com
mittee, through the public press, that a large defalcation has occ-urred In
of the Treasurer of the city and county, and as these has been no
official report made to your honorable board, your committee is unable
at this time to more than refer to this unfortunate affair. Your commit
tee begs, however, to point out to your honorable board that a system of
counting the public moneys has been Inaugurated which, in the judgment
of your committee should not be encouraged. This Information has
come to your committee through a communication sent to the preM by
his Honor the Mayor. The Bystem to which your committee begs to
draw the attention of your honorable board is known as "hefting" The
Bystem was in vogue at the time when evidences or tokens of value were
represented by such articles as were captured in the chase or any nat
ural product representing value which in their nature were hefty Since
the introduction of coin or money the practice of hefting money has
given way to the more conservative method of eountineâ a method
which is favored generally by banking and commercial institutions in
preference to hefting. Hefting has its advantages where modern appli
ances have not been introduced. Before the Introduction of scales for
weighing, the hog-raisers practiced hefting exclusively. A good hefter
could heft several hundred hogs per diem, and it Is said they were 80 ex
pert they could tell within a fraction of a pound the weight of the hog
hefted. A real good hefter is now seldom encountered outside of the ra
sor-back districts. However advantageous the system of hefting Is as
applied to hogs, It is obviously a dangerous practice when applied to the
((Hinting Of public money, inasmuch as from lack of skill or want of
practice the hefter may not have retained that delicacy of touch which
is essential to obtain results. Moreover, it is doubtful if the consolida
tion act permits the hefting of public moneys.
The most liberal Interpretation of the laws could not construe these
words In this manner, and it is extremely doubtful if so construed such
construction would be upheld by the Supreme Court, for section S4 of the
consolidation act does not permit that the sacks of money shall be heft
ed, but the imperative duty Is Imposed of counting the moneys In the
treasury.
Your committee regrets to note that the numerous calls on the time
of our chief executive in attending to social and other functions together
with the very laudable efforts on his part to promote and encourage pu
rity in local politics, and in correcting the alleged mistakes of the voters
of the city and county by appointing men to office in lieu of thoÃe who
he believed were mistakenly elected by the people, encroach so much
on the time which the duties of his office demand, and respectfully susrirests
that such relief be civen him whereby these multifarious duties ami
functions may be performed without further loss to the municipality
.should not be discu. 1 ed at this time. He
said a jury must first pass on the value of
the land, and that after that would l.c
the time to take up the question of
whether the money should be appro
priated. He asserted that if the courts
condemned the property for public use
there would be no obligation on the part
of the board to appropriate the money for
the purchase of the land.
George Center spoke against the prop
osition, saying that this was not the time
tO appropriate money for a park that was
not needed, when there were so many
other public Improvements that were
crying necessities. He declared that he
Industrial School tract would be a good
location for the proposed park.
At this point Supervisor Dodge gave the
first indication of a change of heart on
this matter. He asked if the reduction of
the price would Induce Mr. Center to
waive his objections.
To this Mr. Center responded that It
would not, as the cost of improvement
would be very great. The land was the
most rocky in the city.
Dodge moved a little closer to the real
estate jobbers. "If the $:$87,000 asked was
reduced to one-half." he volunteered, "I
would be inclined to consider the matter
favorably, as the right of way would be
secured between the Mission district and
the district south of the park. This would
cost alone probably $f>u,(HX).
A. I. Van Duzer said the property be
longed to the Crocker estate, and that
Stanford offered it as a gift to tho city
ten years ago, but that the city found it
could not afford to take it. "It is lit only
for animals that fly or have a peculiar
ability for climbing." he remarked. "The
Crocker people attempted to improve and
sell it, but had to give up the undertak
ing, as nobody wanted to live there. Don't
you know that this is a scheme of the
Crocker estate." he asked, "to unload a
worthless property on us? No matter
how low the price is this year, it will be
lower next year."
Dr. John A. Miller, Max Popper, John
F. English and E. P. E. Troy addressed
the board in Opposition to the proposed
condemnation proceedings.
Troy declared that if this resolution
were passed it would be the crowning
scandal of the board.
This led Supervisor fiheehan to move
that no more politicians out of employ
ment be heard.
Troy had taken his eeat, but ro*:e ot
thi.s iiing and shouted at Sheshaa: "I
ney";r sought a place, i am only tryi'ig
to do my duty as a good "lti'.in in fight
ins; scoundrels In olllce." Ho r...ide an
attempt to get nearer to Khoe.h.-'in and to
continue his remarks, but was prevented
by the order of ihe Mayor and trie efforts
of the sergoant-at-nrms.
V.\ M. Hunker, Mrs. Joseph Touluy,
Dennis Sullivan, John 11. Gradv and Dr.
C. G. Kenyon spoke in lavir of the pro
posed zoo.
At the request o' "*if Â»>f the Supervisors
Mayor Phelan stated that he would favor
the purchase of the land in question if
the price were not a fancy one. He added
that he thought S2T.O â  i for the lands un
der consideration would be excessive.
Supervisor Clinton asked his Honor if i
he did not think that the property would I
become cheaper next year.
The Mayor replied that he believed not.
Supervisor i.ackmann introduced a res
olution asking that the City Attorney be i
asked if the board could be compelled to
appropriate the money for the purchase
of the land if it is condemneu by a jury
and its value fixed. The resolution was
adopted.
The original resolution was then adopted
by the vote already given.
Supervisor Rottanzi was trained leave

whenever he responds to the call of .the !
general Government for the services In j
the Sanitary Corps of the National
Guard of this State; the said leave of ab-
Bence to continue during the time his ser- j
vices are so required.
Supervisor Clinton introduced the fol
lowing resolution:
Whereas, War has been declared by this
country against Spain, the primal cause of I
whl<-h was the cruelties practiced in Cuba by j
and thp'UKh which that island was becoming j
â  : ]â  'pulated ; and,
Whf-reas, The people of all classes and de- |
nominations throughout the world viewed with !
horror and dismay the utter disregard paid to ,
the rights of the people by Spain, who, by
barbarous and inhuman acts, has at last suc
ceeded in almost decimating Cuba; and,
Wheras, Unless the humane policy of inter- ;
ventlon hail been adopted by our Government |
still further horrors would have shocked the
sensibilities of humanity; therefore,
Resolved, That this board Is in entire sym
pathy with the policy adopted by our Govern
ment and will to the full extent of Its power |
aid, by such appropriations of money as may '
be required, the relatives of those city officials i
In necessitous circumstances who may resign
their positions to give their services to the
National Government.
It was referred to the finance commit
tee.
A resolution. Introduced by Supervisor
Rottanzi, requesting the Market Street j
Railway Company and the Sutro Kail
way Company to file annual statements
of earnings with the clerk of the board,
was adopted. This is asked in order that !
the amount due the city from the earn- I
ings of these companies may be ascer
tained.
A resolution was adopted calling on the j
City Attorney for further information in j
reference to the litigation whereby the
city lost certain property along Mission j
Creek, by reason of the "neglect or de
sign of the City Attorney's predecessor."
The property is valued at about $20,000.
' The object of the resolution is to ascer
! tain if the case can be reopened.
Permission was given the Alpine Ath
j letic Club to hold monthly entertainments \
of boxing and wrestling in its club rooms, j
at 2s Golden Gate avenue.
The privilege was accorded the Occi- |
dental Handball and Athletic Club to give ;
' an exhibition of amateur boxlnt in its ;
i dub rooms at 120 Grove street, between
the loth and 30th of May, IS9S.
The heads of the various municipal de
; partments were requested to report to j
the board on or before the loth of July, <
i ISOS, the condition of their respective de- j
partments for the fiscal year ending June
30, 180 S. embracing all their operations, re
1 eeipts and expenditures.
C H. .Touett was awarded the contract
I for one year, ending June SO, 1899, for
supplying the Fire Department, public
! ofliees and departments with coal and
wood. The resolution awarding the con
tract had a war proviso In It as follows: |
"That it is expressly understood that If !

eventuate in war, and said war shall in- ;

NUMBER OF
TELEPHONES
W. Hare, a Young
Man, Caught in
the Act.
Tried to Open a Box in
a Sixth - Street
Saloon.
William Hare, who Is said to be well
connected, was arrested last night while In
the act of rifling a telephone box in a sa
loon on Sixth street, near Howard. For
some time past a number of telephone
boxes have been broken open and their
contents taken. The manager of the tel
ephone company enlisted the services of
the police, with special instructions to
arrest the culprits, as thoy had injured
their business.
Shortly after 0 o'clock last night a spe
cial officer, whose beat Is on Sixth street,
happened to visit the saloon nonr How
ard and discovered Hare, who is only 18
years of age, in the act of rifling the tf.e
phone box. He had a steel jimmy in his
h;unl and was vainly endeavoring to open
the door of the box. After watching him
for several minutes and realizing that he
intended to secure â¢ the contents of the
box, the special accosted him and asked
him what he was doing. For a reply the
youthful culprit struck him in the face
.and started to run away. The officer,
with the assistance of a bystander, after
a short struggle, placed him under arrest
He was then turned over to a regular po
lice officer and taken to police headquar
ters, where his name was registered on
the small book. The jimmy which he
used was found In his coat pocket.
Hare, who seems to be an innocent
appearing youth, claimed that his father
is a cigar manufacturer on Sixth street,
and that the supposed jimmy he carried
was used by him In making cigar boxes.
He declared that he did not try to rifle
the box, but was at a loss to explain how
it was he had inserted the jimmy in the
door of the receptacle. The police claim
that Hare answers the description of one
of the men who have been systematically
robbing telephone boxes. To-day a thor
ough investigation will be made, and the
detectives believe they will connect Hare
with at least some of the numerous
thefts.
A. C. WIDBER
IS REINDICTED
A Budget of Important Busi
ness Transacted by the
Grand Jury.
The Alleged Jobbery In the Ferry
Depot Will Also Be Inves
tigated.
At tho session of the Grand Jury last
night the chief business transacted was
in connection with the Wldber deficit.
The defaulting treasurer had already
been indicted of embezzling the lump yum
of $16,000, but as it has since be.-n dis
covered that the actual amount Is $117,
088 70, he was rcindicted for the full
amount, in order to preclude the possi
bilities of any technicalities arising from
the fact that he was not Indicted for the
full amount.
Mayor Phelnn, Chief Lees and Chief
Deputy de la Montanya were placed on the
stand and testified that a formal demand
had been made on the ex-Treasurer for
the missing money, hul he had said that
he was unable to produce it. Christian
Reis, Widber's successor, also tostilled
that he had made a formal written de
mand on Widber for the money.
The case of E. J. Stanton. who brought
the sensational charge? of corruption
against Dr. Ragan, was next taken up,
and the ex-teacher was Indicted for ex
tortion. The Manley will case was also
taken up, but the examination was not
finished. It will be resumed at the next
session.
There 'Is still much important business
to come before the Jury, and two special
sessions will be held." On "Wednesday
the frauds charged in connection with the
purchasing of school supplies will be
taken up. and on Friday the alleged
frauds in the construction of the ferry
depot will be investigated.
Held for Murder.
John L. Carney-, ex-Deputy Superintend
ent of Stroots, was yesterday held to an
swer bffore the Superior Court hy
Judge Joachlmsen on the charge of mur
dering Leon Durand at 10sn Howard street

HARTMAN IN
"THE PURSER"
The Farce a Good One ;
tfie Star Funny, but
Immoderate.
"Nancy Hanks" Shows Jansen
and Company in a Better
Light.
Very Gay Parisians at the Alcazar
and Sumptuous Melodrama at
Morosco's.
The genial George Bowles, Impre
sario, entrepreneur and jollier of the
pressâ in a word, the Bowles who re
cently bathed Anna Held in the news
papers of San Francisco â introduced at
the Baldwin last night a new star in thy
shape of our old Tivoli friend, Ferris
Hartman, and a new nautical musical
farcical comedy of British origin called
"The Purser," and which never had
been presented before in this country.
Mr. Bowles prepared the American pre
sentation with quiet legitimacy. He ex
ploded no advance torpedoes about the
play and if his star has acquired tne
practice of bathing daily in sixty-four
quarts of Dockery-proof milk, the fact
has been kept out of the newspapers.
Hartman and "'The Purser" were of
fered simply on their merits, and, as
far as the flowers and enthusiasm of
the Hartmanite audience would permit,
were given a fair trial. "The Purser"
is worth seeing, and Hartman is just as
good a comedian as he uned to be In
the old Tivoli days. "The Pun .'
would not set fire to a normal dranmitj
season, but in the present Hood of ten
derloin fun it is conspicuously decent,
and, in places, humorous; and with sev
eral modifications of him, which 1 shall
suggest later, the star ought to be able
to uispatch the obligations of the title
part.
The plot of the piece is quick and
easy. Just as the purser and hits bride
were about to settle duwn to â¢ several
months of stationary honeymoon he
was ordered off to sea; and sooner than
leave her behind he smuggles - her
aboard as a cabin passenger under her
maiden name, for it is forbidden olticers
of the "Kangaroo" to be accompanied
by their wives. The other woman in
the case turns up in the gay young per-
Bon of a Mrs. Stanley, lately divorced
at the suggestion, she says, of the
purser. She is willing to be his any
minute, with the whole ship as witness;
and he can keep her silent only by
promising all kinds of marriage to take
place when the voyage is over.
This sort of a start admits of
no end of complication, which the
author, John T. Day, manages very
neatly. The captain, the male passen
gers, and the ship's doctor <jre soon
paying their several devotions to the
purser's bride, under his anguished
eyes; Mrs. Stanley is getting caught in
the purser's stateroom repairing his
underwear, under the wife's eyes; and
finally the captain becomes so warm
in his attentions to Mrs. Purser that
her indignant spouse throws discretion
t<> the winds and knocks him down,
and is ordered under arrest, whereupon
both women faint in his arms. The
disentanglement, like the earlier situ
ations, is done in the widely hopeful
way of irresponsible farce, but with
considerable fun and situational skill.
In fact, the situations are very clever
in invention, and as the probability of
the piece is never insisted on, one does
not mind the careless manner in which
they are led up to. The dialogue is
more distinguished than that of the
usual contemporary farce-comedy, and
the characters are, for the greater part,
quite sharply drawn.
Although the explanatory Aside and
the confidential Soliloquy are a bit too
prominent, "The Purser" is happy
enough in point of construction to be
played as straight farce without any
musical embellishments and without
any funny-man antics on the, part of
its principal comedian. The two large
vital mistakes made by Mr. Hartman
are that he is forever coming out of the
part to make mugs at the audience and
that he sings at all. Perhaps in the
"concert" scene in the second act a
single song from Hartman would not
be remarkably disastrous, but the pres
ent arrangement which permits him to
sing about every fifteen minutes is
directly against the fortunes of the pro
duction.
I know that Mr. Hartman used to I
Bing yards and yards of all sorts of !
comic song at the Tivoli to an accom- |
pan! men t of enraptured boot-thunder
from the crowd, but the Baldwin Is sup
posed to attract the very persons who
stayed away from the Tivoli on that
account. Mr. Hartman's voice Is never
in the key and it is of a fog-horn qual
ity not sweet to hear. It is blatant and
humorless, and the leas of it is heard
the bigger will be the success of the i
piece. "With the exception of Gertie !
Carlisle no one in the company can
sing a little bit. Even the good-natured
audience of last night, who came with j
cartloads of flowers and handfuls of I
applause, did not take very kindly to
the vocal trimmings, and if Mr. Hart
man will scratch the most of the sing
ing and quit mugging there is no rea
son why the piece should not do well.
The part of the purser does not ask for
any notable degree of refinement and is
right in Hartman's line if he will only
reduce himself to the rest of the pict
ure.
Lena Merville plays Mrs. Stanley
with good spirit and a certain amount
of pat worldliness, and Alice Johnson
is sure and easy as the bride. The two
male passengers are capitally done by
John H. Brown and Edward Emory,
and H. D. Blakeman will be a first
rate captain when he is on better
terms with the part. The only bad fig
ure is the Irish doctor of William Rich
ardson. Otherwise the company is
evenly good. ASHTON STEVENS.
NANCY HANKS.
"Nancy Hanks" was entitled to a bet
ter house than was accorded it at the
Columbia last night, for it is a farce of
some merit and the performance was on
the whole an improvement on that of the
past week. Marie Jansen appeared to
somewhat better advantage than before
and the company too did better.
Harry Beresford played the French
man, the Marquis de la Rochelle, grace
fully and temperately both as to dialect
and action, and Richard Chandos was
fairly well cared for by Clarence Mnn
taine; but if it would not be an unpatri
otic thing to do just now it might
help the roll materially if Mr. Montaine
would train on enchiladas and throw a
little more chili into his work. Jessie
Bradbury's Henrietta Dash and Sylvia
Lyndon's Frances Lakewood were "cor
dially received and the songs and busi
ness thrown in here and there tilled in
very opportunely.
ALCAZAR.
While at Alcazar prices one cannot ex
pect a company with names as celebrated
and with the artistic finish of that
brought out by Frohman, it must In all
candor be said that the very large audi
ence that filled the auditorium at the
Alcazar last night to laugh at the "Gay
Parisians" missed none of the innocent
though a trifle suggestive sparkle of the
best of French farces. The piece went
with a snap and a crisp adroitness that
left no time for pause between the con
stant bursts of merriment which greeted
the funny situations.
Stockwell was in his best vein as the
middle-aged deceiver, and Wallace Shaw
as the stutterer gave him able support,
playing Mathieu with a naturalness
which rendered his malapropos appear
ances all the more ludicrous. Mrs. F.
M. Bates as Angeliquo and Miss Gertrude
Foster as Marcelle Paillard were not
more than equaled by the two leading
men of the piece. Between the first and
second acts Miss Foster recited a Cuban
selection, full of patriotism, and a feel
ing that brought down the house. The
farce was as well received as it was on
its first presentation in this city and bids
fair to pile up a run of several weeks.
MOROSCO'S.
Lettie Le Vyne, in "The Wicklow Post
man," was the morceau that Manager
Morosco offered to a large audience last
night. The play is a comedy-drama that i
permits of a number of specialty intro- â 
ductions. The sweet melodies of the Em- |
erald Isle were well rendered oy the Acme
Quartet and a number of the members of j
the company. But Miss Le Vyne, with
an especially sweet contralto voice, was |
the stellar attraction and made an In- !
stantaneous hit. Her rendition of an
Irish colleen was subdued, well-sus- '
tamed and natural. She introduced. :
among other numbers, the new patriotic j
song, "Remember, Boys, the Maine."
Her costumes w.>re very fetching, dis- |
playing her shapely figure to advantage.
Fred J. Butler, In the leading role, re
ceived much applause for his clever work.
TIVOLI.
Perhaps Hartman at the Baldwin ac
counted for the small audience at the
; Tivoli hist night to see the second edition
of "Sinbad the Sailor." A number of i.ew
songs and specialties have been added,
and altogether "Sinbad" is well worth a
i second visit.
