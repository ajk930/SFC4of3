Speaker Reed's Sway Weakens in View
of the Fact That Spanish Cruelty
Has Grown Unbearable.
GIVING THE PRESIDENT A BACKBONE,
Be it resolved by the Senate ana the House of Representatives of the United States of America:
1. That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free and independent.
2. That the Government of the United States hereby recognizes the republic of Cuba as the true
and lawful Government of that island.
3. That the war Spain is waging against Cuba is so destructive of the commercial and property
interests of the United States, and so cruel, barbarous and inhuman in its character, as to make it the
duty of the United States to demand and the Government of the United States does hereby demand that
she at once withdraw her land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
4. That the President of the United States be and hereby is authorized, empowered and di
rected to use, if necessary, the entire land and naval forces of the United States to carry these resolu
tions into effect.
SENATOR FRYE'S
RESOLUTION.
Whereas. The war which nas been
waged In the island of Cuba for the
p*fit four years has been conducted
.â -. Spanish Government In .iola
tlon of the rules of civilized warfare,
said Government has driven the un
armed and peaceable Inhabitants from
their homes and forced them within
the armed camps, where it has per
mitted hundreds of thousands of men,
women and children to die 01 starva
tion; and as a result of this system ot
Inhuman warfare tens of thousands oi
helpless people are now dying for
want of food; and
Whereas, Tne war has paralyzed
and almost destroyed the large com
mercial relations which have hereto
fore existed between the United States
and Cuba, and has rendered useless
and brought to ruin the many millions
of uollaxs of property of American
citizens invested in the islands; and
Whereas, The existence and pro
longation of the hostilities have Im
posed heavy financial expenditures and
burdensome official labors upon the
Government of the United States in
the enforcement of its neutrality
laws; and
Whereas, The Consuls of the United
States and ouier impartial and com
petent observers have reported that
the Spanish Government has lost con
trol of much of the greater portion of
the island; that it is powerless to re
store Its authority and bring about
peace; and that a continuance oi the
contest will have no other effect man
to Increase the horrors, misery and
starvation which now exist, to utterly
extinguish the commerce with and
destroy the property of American
citizens and add to the expense and
burdens of the Government of the
United States;
Therefore, Resolved by the Senate
and the House of Representatives of
the United States of America, in Con
gress assembled. That the President
of the United States be and Is hereby
directed and empowered to take such
effective steps as, In his discretion,
may be necessary to secure a speedy
termination of the hostilities between
the Government of Spain anu the
people of Cuba, tne withdrawal of the
military and naval forces of Spain
from said Island and to complete the
Independence of said people.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 29.
A general belief prevails in Washing
ton to-night that the President is in
clined to accept the inevitable and real
izes that sooner or later he must yield
to the demands of Congress for some
aggressive action, but he does not in
tend to shoulder the responsibility for
any consequences that may result there
from. The leaders in Congress, among
whom are many of his intimate friends,
have given him to understand that rad
ical action can no longer be delayed.
It is believed that President McKinley
fully realizes the situation, from a talk
he had late yesterday afternoon with
Messrs. Dingley, Grosvenor, Cannon.
Payne and Dalzell, and at night with
Senators Lodge, Proctor, Allison, Gor
man, Klkir. - and Hansbrough, all 01
whom represented to him that the Sen
ate and House were in no mood for a
policy of delay. There is no doubt all
these gentlemen, and particularly the
House leaders, gave him to understand
that open rebellion would result unless
there was a change of policy.
Representative Grosvenor, especially,
was able to give the President the exact
situation, and he explained that a storm
was brewing. The President finally de
termined to withhoid his message ask
ing for the Cuban relief appropriation

kingdom of Spain against the people
of " Cuba - has j destroy? d the commerce â 
between them and the people of the
United States, and its revival .will be
impossible so long as such war may
continue; and
" Whereas, By, the authority of that

HAS THE PRESIDENT SENT
AN ULTIMATUM TO SPAIN?
CHICAGO, March 29.â A special to the Chronicle from Washington
says: "The positive statement was made by Secretary Algrer to-night
that Mr. McKinley this evening: sent an ultimatum to Spain, and that
the fact will be communicated to Congress to-morrow. It is impos
sible to obtain definite information from the White House."
for a few days, at least, hoping that in
the meantime the situation might be
changed, but to-night he was given to
understand by his supporters in Con
gress that whether or not the Cuban re
lief resolution was considered an effort
would be made to bring before the
House a resolution recognizing the bel
ligerent rights of the Cubans or for the
independence of the island. They told
him thi? might take the form of a rider
to the Naval Appropriation bill.
For these reasons it is believed
hat the President and his Cabinet
have decided to accept the situation
and let the full responsibility for any
consequences that may result rest
upon Congress.
At the same time they hope to tem
porize for a few days longer. One of
the President's supporters said to-night:

SENATOR ALLEN'S
RESOLUTION.
Whereas, The war now and for some
time past being 1 waged between the
K.(ngrdrÂ»ir of Spain and the Cub^n In
surgents has fully demonstrated the
total inability of the former to subdue
the insurgents; and
Whereas, Said war has become one
of extermination by starvation, and
the dictates of Christian civilization
and common humanity alike demand
the speedy cessation of hostilities and
the immediate termination of the de
liberately planned starvation now go
ing on in the island of Cuba; and
Whereas, Under existing circum
stances, it is the bounden duty of the
United States to intervene; and
Whereas, The assertion of the Mon
roe doctrine forbidding- the Interfer
ence of foreign powers in the affairs of
any State or nation on the Western
Hemisphere creates an obligation on
the part of the United States to guar
antee the people thereof against unus
ual cruelties and barbarities and ex
termination by any such foreign pow
er; and
Whereas, The Cubans have, in the
opinion of the American people and of
Congress, by their valor and sacrifices
during the four years of war, won
their independence from Spain and are
entitled to political recognition by thfe
United States; and
Whereas, It Is apparent that Spain
can no longer govern or control the
people of Cuba; therefore,
Resulved, by the Senate and the
House of Representatives, That the
republic of Cuba, now and for some
time maintained by force of arms, is
hereby recognized by the United
States of America as a separate and
Independent nation. That the United '
States shall immediately intervene '
and put an end to the war now being i
waged on the island of Cuba and shall (
succor and release from Imprisonment
the people there concentrated for the '
purpose of starvation and extermina- '
tion. And be it further i
Resolved, That for the purpose of I
enabling the President of the United <
States to provide the concentrated
non-combatant Cubans with the neces
sary food, raiment and medicine for *
their immediate relief from starva- <

thereof as may be necessary. Is hereby (

Treasury not otherwise appropriated.
progress will either have reached a con
clusion or there will have been a break
which will hasten war. When the Presi
dent has acted as he thinks best he will
submit the whole matter to Congress
and leave that body to take whatever
course it sees fit.
"If it does not care to approve what
he has done he will not regret that the
responsibility has left his shoulders. It
may not be over ten days before the
President will be able to give to Con
gress the correspondence that has
passed and is now passing."
Members are deliberate and out
spoken in their expressions and say
that a necessary condition to any
consent to delay will be that the de
lay shall be brief and coupled with
unequivocal assurance of action.
They are willing for the President to
take the leadâ want him. to do 50 â and
they will follow, but they must know
that he is going to do what they want
and do it with reasonable promptness.
The advice of the most responsible men
is that three or four days be given the
President to indicate his policy, and for
the committees to report, and that if
definite steps are not taken before the
close of the week to restore order and
civilization in Cuba, Congress shall act.
Nothing short of the evacuation of
Cuba by the Spanish will be listened to.
There is considerable sentiment in fa
vor of making the destruction of the
Maine the ground for ? <!ir~* declara
tion of war. This sentiment is excited
by the reading of the testimony taken
by the Court of Inquiry, which is wide
ly held to convict the Spanish officials
of the crime- The theory that the char
acter of the explosions is proved to have
been such as to preclude the possibil
ity of its having been without the con
nivance of officials is very generally
held.
The members of the House who are
in favor of immediate and aggressive
action on the Cuban question are dis
cussing all sorts of methods by which
the House can be brought to an expres
sion of opinion. This morning there
was talk of overruling the chair during
the consideration of the naval appropri
ation bill and attaching a resolution rec
ognizing the independence oi Cuba as a
rider.
The feeling to-day was quite as it was

PRESIDENT'S
POSITION IS
OUTLINED.
NEW YORK, March 29.â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: This statement out
lining the attitude of the Presi
dent was made public to-night:
"President McKinley regards
the Maine explosion as a minor
incident. Before making any de
mand for reparation he desired
to receive and consider the re
port of the Maine Court of In
quiry, and believed that such a
course was only fair to Spain.
In adopting this course he was
guided by any number of pre
cedents, including the Trent
case and the Baltimore incident.
The attitude of Congress, he
says, is
"I mean by this that it
ought to exercise its consti
tutional authority and de
clare war or permit the Ex
ecutive to do what he can to
close up the questions arising
out of the general situation
in Cuba.
"Negotiations are in progress
between this Government and
that of Spain which the Presi
dent believes will bring about
the end of the rebellion, give
Cubans practically everything
they want, including indepen
dence, and this he thinks can be
accomplished without war. The
important thing to be first done
is to feed the reconcentrados
and have the Spanish Govern
ment authorize the resumption
of work in the fields. It can be
stated positively, however, that
the President is negotiating for
the end of the war without fur
ther delay, and he believes he
will be successful."
j last evening, and if possible, more war
like. The password between men of all
parties as they assembled at the Capitol
to-day was "Action," and the response
was "No backdown." Members as they
met in the corridors, lobbies and on the
floor of the House renewed assurances
that nothing could shake their deter
mination to have prompt action.
Senators and members oi the House
who had read the testimony in the
Maine case exhibited more intense feel
ing than they had shown yesterday, and
among them there was none who do
not declare that the testimony proved
that the explosion was the act of Span
ish authorities or officials as jjlainlx as..
it was proven to be an external explo
sion. The question was very generally
asked how it was that the court failed
to make that specific finding.
The President is represented as being
astonished at the storm that has been
raised about his ears. Some of the
President's advisers are said to have as
sured him that with a little delay the
storm would blow over and Congress
could be held in check. Appearances
do not warrant this opinion. Delay is
irritating and the temper of Congress
does not seem to be the result of sud
den excitement on account of the Maine
report. The expressions heard from Re
publicans in Congress who have been
stanch supporters of the President here
tofore are of loss of confidence. This is
not based on the Maine report, though
the feeling is intensified on account of
that, but results from the stories as to
the character of negotiations that have
ben conducted by Minister Woodford in
Madrid.
The situation becomes more serious
from the fact that the Representatives
are organizing. The most threatening
movement of the day was an impromptu
meeting of Republicans to outline a plan
to destroy Speaker Reed's policy of
peace in the House. It was to have
been a conference of only a dozen men.
A whisper got abroad and fifty-two men
attended. All pledged themselves to
armed intervention or nothing. No war,
no appropriation.
There is a probability, too, that the
.Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
will report favorably one of the war
resolutions introduced to-day. ThÂ«
members of that committee, have waited
on the President and told him that un
less he ; outlines a definite plan and in
forms Congress of the â¢ character of the
representations he has made to â¢ Spain,
action will be taken without delay. Tha
jingoes claim that he has no plan.
Members of the House are meeting
by State delegations all over Wash
ington â â  to .; pledge themselves to voto
for armed intervention.
It is a trying time for the Presi
dent, iHe has been receiving letters
indorsing his course and telegrams
calling his message on the Maine dis
aster a "compromise with hell."
J He is apparently not discouraged and
feels that he will be sustained in the end.
His intimate friends are aiding him
handsomely. Powerful influences are at
work to '[ hold' Congress in check and
State and local bosses are hurrying herÂ«
to work on their Congressmen.
"â¢Nlh its effort: to stem the time the ad
ministration â¢ has done some wise things
and : some foolish â  things. Its friends
have made.use of the story that the fire
in Congress has been i started by men .

MESSAGE MAY
HASTEN WAR
Mare Island Officials of t\ye Opinion
That Congress Will Act
at Once.
VALL/EJO. March 29.â McKinley's message has not found that fa
vor among the officers of the navy yard which one more definite and
more outspoken might have met. The general impression is that the
message has not helped matters a particle, and that war is just as near
as ever it wasâ nearer in fact, some think, for Congress will tfre of an
"on-the-fence policy," and will precipitate matters by action that may
be too hasty. There is a fear, however, that too much talking will be
dune, and so any action taken may be weakened. None of the officers,
high or low, will criticize the message or the report for publication, but
the impression is that it has added nothing to what was already
known, and only an exasperating delay has been the result of waiting
for It.
The storekeeper's department at the navy yard has suddenly start
ed into activity and the employees there are perhaps as busy as any on
the yard. Provisions are arriving as fast as they can be taken care of,
and black paint, to the quantity of 13.000 pounds, was to-day stowed
away to await its use, which, it is thought, will not be long.
Most of the rapid-firing guns of the Charleston and Philadelphia
have been shipped East by this time, and still no word has been re
ceived as to when and how they will be replaced.
Posters are being pasted up in public places about town calling for
seamen and machinists. The posters state that seamen between the
ages of 21 and 35 years are wanted. The rates of wages are given as
follows: Seamen, $24 a month; ordinary seamen, $19; chief machin
ists. $70; machinists, first-class, $55; machinists, second-class, $40. The
candidates wiil be subjected to the usual examinations, and machinists
will be required to show proper qualifications.
The labor board is still looking for machinists, drillers, riveters,
shipwrights and boat builders, but it is announced that there is no need
to apply for work as a painter or ordinary carpenter.
Tc-nmrrow the old Camanche will be awakened long enough to have

statement issued scmi-officially by the
administration that the Maine might
have been blown up from the inside
alter all, because there had been fire in
her bunkers once before. This is re
garded as a direct attempt to allay pub
lic opinion by discrediting the testimony
adduced before the United States board
that there had never been any sponta
neous combustion on the ship.
President McKinley began his day by
demonstrating to the country that the
Cabinet is united. General Aider's
statement to that effect was prompt con
firmation of the Herald's news. Then
the President started in to combat the
idea that Congress would be justified in
declaring war without waiting to hear
frcm Spain. He deprecates such haste
and demands time until Spain's reply
shall enable him to put the whole mat
ter before the country.
If Congress insists on declaring war
in bTeak-neck fashion he is willing it
rhould take the sole responsibility and
leave it to the American people to say
who is* right. On the other hand, if
Congress waits and Spain's reply proves
unsatisfactory and short of what is de
manded by right and justice, then he
v.ill be as much of a jingo as anybody..
THE QUEEN REGENT
HOPEFUL OF PEACE.
Copyrighted, 1898. by Jame9 Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, March 29.â Yesterday
I stated that to-day was the all-im
portant one. Circumstances have
made it Thursday, for this afternoon,
after a conference which began at 4
o'clock and ended at half -past 5,
Senor Sagasta adjourned the meeting
for forty-eight hours, at the end of
which time he will have taken
counsel with the Queen and his Min
isterial colleagues, and then there
eeems no kind of doubt that the Min
istry will give the world a peaceful
and honorable solution of all the
questions about Cuba.
At the council stated there were
present Senors Sagasta, Moret, Gul
lon and General Woodford. Bankers
and brokers got wind of what was
likely to take place, and the Bourse
was crowded with financiers dealing
upon calculations of peace. Bankers
gathered in groups, reckoning that
each point up made the situation of
the country better and richer by mil
lions.
Among the middle classes the idea
of honorable peace has taken a firm
hold, and great and prodigious will
be the popularity of the Ministry
when it announces peaceful results.
I understand that the Pope,
through the Papal Nuncio, conveys
his approval, and more still, of peace
under the circumstances suggested,
as Spain is his pet child. In the
palace there is no doubt of the senti
ment, for the Queen is the warmest
advocate of peace and has grieved for
three years over the Cuban war. She
will support with all her strength
the great opportunity which has
fallen to the lot of her country to
secure peace with honor.
SPAIN IS PLAYING
NOW FOR DELAY.
NEW YORK, March 29.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald says:
Although the flying squadron form
ing at Hampton Roads will be ready
for service in another week, there is
no intention on the part of the ad
ministration to employ it to destroy
tne torpedo flotilla of Spain, which
is now on its way to Porto Rico. It
can be stated positively that the ad
ministration has no intention of in
terfering with this flotilla unless
war should occur.
It is believed in naval circles that
Spain is delaying hostilities as much
as possible until this flotilla has ar
rived on this side of the Atlantic and
that when it is safe she will come
out in plain language and tell this
Government what she will and will
not do.
Much to the relief of the admin
istration and naval officials the
Spanish torpedo gun vessel Temera
rio, which left Montevideo on Satur
day last for an unknown destination,
was reported to-day to have arrived

HAVANA, March 29.â 1 have
heard to-day from a reliable
source that one of the most
prominent members of the Court
of Inquiry has said since the re
port was sent to Washington
that the investigation proved
that the mine which destroyed
the Maine must have been too
large and too well suited to the
purpose to have been secured or
.made by private individuals, and
Vnust have come from a Govern-
ment source.
This is a most important view
and was not embodied in the'
court's report, being outside its
province. It does not mean, nec
essarily the complicity of the
Spanish Government, but simply
that an employe of the Govern
ment, having access to its com
plicated explosives, may have
used his position to aid the das
tardly plot. I
This is in line with the Her
ald's assertion that explosives
of the nature which must have
been employed could not have
been secured by an ordinary con
spirator or fanatic, but in all
probability could have been got
only through the connivance of
some one whose business it is to
manufacture, guard or direct the
use of Government mines or tor
pedoes. Was gunpowder the ex
plosive? If so, the mine must
have been a very extensive one.
Guncotton would have cut
through the ship instead of scat
tering and rending it as did the
explosion which tore the Maine
to pieces.

vessel which the battle-ship Oregon
and the gunboat Marietta will have
to be careful about during their voy
age around the Horn to Key West.
In herself the Temerario is re
garded as a formidable vessel of her
type. Her speed is five knots greater
than that of the Oregon and at least
seven knots greater than tnat of the
Marietta, and she has a steaming ra
dius of 3400 miles. The Oregon is
regarded as ''big game" both by
Spanish and American naval experts
and officials believe that if war
should break out the Spaniards will
make desperate efforts to prevent the
American battle-ship from reaching
Key West.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL. PASO, Texas, March 29. â At a
maes-meetlng of fully 500 citizens of
all parties here, to-night, the waiting
j policy of President McKinley in hand
ling Cuban affairs was severely criti
cized, and whenever Mark Hanna's
name was mentioned, hisses were
I heard. Intense sympathy was ex
pressed for the starving Cubans, and it
was demanded that the United Statt-3
Government interfere at once and put
an end to the horrible conditions of the
Cuban patriots.
The assemblage was unanimous for
war to punish Spanish treachery for
the assassination of American seamen
and blowing up the Maine. Colonel S.
G. Etherage, an ex-Confederate soldier,
presided over the meeting and nearly
every prominent lawyer in the city de
livered an address.
Resolutions were presented by a com
mittee of five, but they were not strong
I enough to meet the approval of the
I mass-meeting, and were about to be
J amended to condemn McKinley unmer
i cifully, but wiser counsed prevailed
I and the resolutions were considerably
i toned down before their pasage. The
I resolutions demanded that the trouble
j with Spain be settled at once and that
thiÂ» President drive the Spaniards from
this continent, and the Texans pledged

of Missouri was secretary. The meet
ing was called to take steps to secure
immediate intervention in some form
and the recognition of Cuban independ
\ ence. It was the first definite step
; toward this end since the President's
! message was submitted yesterday.
Up to this afternoon the sentiment
i was a half-concealed but strong feel
' ing against voting money for Cuban
relief unless accompanied by action to
! stop, the war. The meeting to-day
; was called with a view to accomplish
ing" the unqualified removal of the
Spanish troops from Cuba, and prompt
armed intervention in the affairs of
that island. Late this afternoon the
! word was quietly passed around, but
! many who are enthusiastically in fa
vor of intervention failed of notifica
tion, though the number present would
be sufficiently large, by consolidation
with the Democratic forces, to carry
I out a programme.
Representative Hopkins, as chair
man, briefly stated the objects of thfe
meeting. He indicated his disappoint
ment that the President's message car
ried no outlfne of a definite responsive
policy toward Spain, and he did not be
lieve further delay should be brooked.
He, however, thought the administra
tion might have another day or two in
which to act, and, failing to do so, that
Congress should take the matter into
its own hands independently and at
once. He favored action looking to Cu
ban independence, but made no speci
fic suggestions as to the method of its
accomplishment.
Representative Tawney of Minne
sota, another member of the Ways and
Means committee, said this country
should not stop short of securing the
absolute independence of Cuba. He
referred to efforts to have the matter
brought directly before the House, and
said he wished to secure a resolution
for the prompt consideration of the
question on the floor.
Representative Belknap of Illinois,
who favors immediate decisive action,
took the floor and asked a number of
questions tending to bring out the sen
timent of the meeting and the policy
to be followed. The feeling seemed to
be that no action other than the cessa
tion of hostilities on the island and ab
solute independence would be accept
able.
Representative Marsh of Illinois,
chairman of the Committee on Militia,
made a vigorous speech in which he
denounced Spain as the proven culpable
party to the blowing up of the Maine.
He would, he said, put an end to Span
ish rule in Cuba by immediate inter
vention and a formal recognition of
Cuban independence. His remarks were
warmly applauded.
Representative Lorimer of Illinois al
so spoke at considerable length, and
said he was in favor of securing abso
lute independence by any means what
soever. He deprecated the delay that
had already occurred, and protested
that the people of this country would
not stand the withholding of action.
Other speakers were Representatives
Reeves of Illinois; Pierce of Missouri;
Hicks and Brumm of Pennsylvania;
Mann of Illinois; Joy of Missouri;
Kirkpatrick and Arnold of Pennsylva
nia and Lawrence of Massachusetts.
Their speeches were larerely on the
same line.
It was pointed out that while It was
fit that the executive should be given,
as has been, reasonable time in which
to advise, it wag exclusively the func
tion of Congress to declare war, com
mence hostilities or take action of that
character.
The remarks made carried the view
that a mere recognition of belligerency
was not to be considered: for It would
not of itself bring a cessation of hos
tilities, and that Intervention, armed
and immediate, and recognition of in
dependence only would be considered.
Pome more conservatively put it "to
intervene and If necessary to support
such action by the prompt dispatch of
our land and naval forces to Cuba."
After some vigorous speeches denun
ciatory of Spain, it was decided to de
fer action until 5 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon. The present programme is
to present to Speaker Reed evidence
that a large majority favor the step
and the Cuban sympathizers believe
that once convinced of the numbers
enlisted In its support he will yield to
them. It is also proposed to communi
cate their sentiment to President Mc-
Klnley. This step to-day is expected
to bear fruit in important action in the
House on Thursday. To-morrow a poll
of the House will be taken.
The following are among those who
participated in the conferences: Messrs.
Hopkins, Mann, Warner, White,
Reeves, Belknap, Marsh and Lorimer
of Illinois; Tawney of Minnesota;

SMALL CRAFT
TO DEFEND THE
SEABOARD CITIES
Navy Officials to OrgaQize a
"Mosquito Fleet" of Tugs
and Yachts.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 29.
It was disclosed by one of the naval orders Issued yesterday that
the department had determined upon the formation of an additional
new fleet, to be known as "the mosquito fleet," to be composed of tugs,
steam yatchs and other small vessels,- which may be obtained, which
are to be used as a sort of mobile defense of seacoast cities. It was
further developed In this connection that the naval militia of the
several States is to be called upon to man these auxiliary fleets.
The fact that the organization Is to be composed exclusively of
small craft of all descriptions that may be available gives the cause
for Its designation as "the mosquito fleet." Its prospective formation
is the result of the observations and work of the naval college for
the past five years, and the officials believe that with the material that
may be obtainable and the manning of the vessels by the naval mi
litia of the States, a formidable organization of its kind will result.
The naval militia of the States, however, will not be relied upon en
tirely to man the ships, but in case of necessity resort will be had to
seamen wherever they may be picked up.
Commander Elmer, who will have command of the fleet, Is at the
navy-yard, which will be the center of his future operations. His du
ties respecting the selection of craft for the fleet are exactly the same
as those performed by the board, which for the past two weeks has
been engaged in the inspection of merchant vessels for the auxiliary
defense preliminary to their purchase by the Navy Department. The
commander and his assistants will visit various places along the
coast and will communicate by letter with persons and firms owning
small craft with a view to determining just how many are available
and at what price the owners would sell or charter them to the Gov
ernment.
As far as practicable It Is the intention of the department that
there shall be a separate set of ships for the defense of the eeacoast
cities, the whole to compose the "mosquito fleet."
In the event of necessity for a rendezvous of several of these local
fleets, where it can be arranged, the primary idea is for each local
fleet to form the "mobile defense" of the particular city where it
is made up. The Bureau of Ordnance will be called into service to
assist in furnishing armament for ihe vessels. In the event of war
naval officers will be assigned to the command of each of the several
local fleets.
The big naval fleet in the vicinity of Key West received an impor
tant addition to-day in the arrival of the cruiser Cincinnati and the
gunboats Wilmington and Castine, which were at Port Antonio, Ja
maica, when last heard from. The Cincinnati and Castine comprised
the recent South Atlantic squadron and were called home several
weeks ago. These vessels are believed to be in excellent condition
for active service, and will be retained at Key West for the pres
ent. Owing to the great speed the Cincinnati will probably be added
to the '"flying squadron" in case It is deemed advisable to enlarge
that fleet.
HOPING FOR
ARBITRATION
Spanish Officials in Cuba
Yet Refuse to Become
Alarmed.
More Relieved Than Surprised
by the Findings of the
â¢â¢Â» Mtiine Court.
Copyrighted, IS9Â«, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA (via Herald-Call dispatch
steamer to Key West, March 29).â The
Herald's abstract of the report of the
Court of Inquiry, cabled from New
York yesterday, brought to Havana the
flrÃt actual news of the precise findings
of the court as to the cause of the j
Maine disaster. Consul-General Lee, a
few minutes before the receipt of the
Herald's abstract, had received sub
stantially similar information through
the medium of a cipher dispatch.
Official reports, received by the pal
ace authorities somewhat later con
firmed the Herald's advices to Havana
correspondents, but the Herald dis
patch gave to the officials the first act
ual news of the court's findings. Th"
cablegram was speedily translated
from English into Spanish and eagerly
read by Secretary-General Congosto,
Marquis Montero and other high offi
cials. They were not disposed to com
ment upon Its contents. One or two
sections seemed, if not gratifying to
them, at least less painful than the
rest- This was particularly true of the
statement that the court found no evi
dence fastening the responsibility for
the ships destruction upon any person
or persons. Eyebrows were elevated
and shoulders shrugged when attention
was called to that portion of the dis
patch which said the ship was percepti- I
bly lifted after the first explosion, but :
some consolation was found apparently ;
In the admission of the court that two ]
magazines were at least partially ex- |
ploded.
Despite the general belief of the
Americans here that this portion of the j
report must refer to the fixed ammuni- |
tion and the magazine filled with salut- ;
Ing powder, the explosion of whic.i ;
has been conceded from the first in all t
well-informed circles, the impression I
seems to prevail in the palace that the
American court's frank admission that
certain magazines did explode, at least !
in part, will tend to strengthen the po
â itlon maintained by the Spanish in- j
qu4ry that the magazine explosion was ,
the primary and sole cause of the dis- I
aster. The" most that is hoped for now
In high Spanish official circles is that j
the United States may consent to sub- i
mit the conflicting reports of the \
American and Spanish Investigation to j
International arbitration.
Consul-General Lee within the week ,
has been informed of five different !
plans to kill him. One contemplated |
surrounding his carriage on the way to
the United States consulate and mob
bing him. Another was a proposal to
send twenty well-dressed young men to j
the Hotel Ingleterra to beat him to ;
death with sticks. The third was to
throw him in the harbor and two others
dealt with such pleasantries as poison
and knife and pistols. To all of which 1
the veteran soldier asks sarcastically: |
"How can a man be expected to main
tain good humor when he is guessing ;
which method will be selected for Ins j
removal?"
On the Produce Exchange yesterday
brokers discussed probable war with
the United States. While the better
class deprecated the seriousness of the
situation and said they hoped sincerely
that the questions at issue would be
settled without hostilities, one person
with lungs of brass said: "There are
only 5000 Americans in Cuba, including
importations of paper citizens and nig
gers, and if we wage war with the
United States we good Spaniards will
make mince meat of them easily
enough."
It was said at the German Club last
night that the New York correspondent
of a German bank, now h^re, had i
asked if he could secure a war insur
ance by the day on $100,000 now on de
posit in Havana. These are some of
the straws which show where the wind
here blows to. but in no instance as yet
have Americans been molested or in-
PLANNING TO
TAKE HAVANA
Strategic Board Dicusses
Army and Navy
Operations.
First Move in Case of War
Would Be the Reduction
of Matanzas.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, March 29.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Plans
for combined operations of the army
and navy in case of war with Spain
were under discussion to-day by the
Strategic Board. The meeting was
confined to the discussion of the point
at which troops should be collected for
prompt transportation to Cuba in case
of war. It will be the duty of the navy
to take a port In Cuba and strongly
fortify it, and when this is accom
plished to convey steamers containing
troopa from some Gulf port. Upon the
landing of these troops they will com
mence offensive operations against Ha
vana.
There is reason to believe that the
department's plans contemplate the re
duction of the city of Matanzas by both
fleets, under command of Captain W.
T. Sampson, and its occupation by the
army. On account of the fortifications
of Havana and the mines which will be
laid in the harbor there is no expecta
tion in the minds of officials that the
navy alone will be able to capture this
city. It is, therefore, necessary that the
army should land and take Havana in
the rear, while the fleet continues its
offensive work from the sea.
Matanzas is within fifty miles of Ha
vana. There are no natural obstacles
to prevent the marching of troops from
that city to Cuba's capital. There is a
railroad connecting the two cities, but
this, of course, would be destroyed.
The roadbed could be taken advantage
of by our engineers, however, to lay
new tracks and thus facilitate tiie
transportation of supplies to troops.
Captain Barker and Lieutenant-
Colonel Wagner had under considera
tion to-day the best point on the gulf
at which troops could be gathered in
the shortest possible time, placed on
boats and transports and sent to
Cuba, Three cities were under con
sideration, viz.: Tampa, Fla., Mobile,
Ala., and New Orleans. It is recognized
that' the port selected must in the first
place be a railroad center, in the sec
ond be fairly well protected, and in the
third have a fairly good harbor.
These three points are railroad ter
minals and, while not very well pro
tected, are being put into condition to
resist attack, and each has sufficient
water to accommodate the protected
cruisers. It is believed that the board
will select the* point nearest to Matan
zas, probably Tampa, In order that the
least possible time may be spent in the
transportation of troops.
The board will also probably recom
mend that transports be obtained, and
for this purpose, it is pointed out, more
excursion steamers and other passen
ger-carrying vessels could be utilized.
There are plenty of these craft along
the southern coast. It would not be
necessary, of course, to arm those ves
sels, as a siring squadron would attend
them and prevent them falling into
the hands of the Spanish.

Senators in Favor of War
With Spain Introduce
Resolutions.
Mason of Illinois Makes a Most
Sensational Speech in Which
He Demands Satisfaction
From Castilians.
Call Office, Rig-gs House,
Washington, March 29.
Interest In the Cuban situation â the
Interest might almost be termed ex
citement, so intense was it â reached a
climax in the proceedings of the Sen
ate to-day. As on previous days of
discussion of the Cuban question, thou
sands of people flocked to the Capitol,
only a few of whom, comparatively,
could gain admission to the galleries.
Within five minutes after the Senate
convened Allen of Nebraska introduced
a resolution recognizing the independ
ence of the Cuban republic. This was
followed by a resolution proposed by
Rawlins of Utah, declaring war against
the kingdom of Spain.
Morrill of Vermont, from the Finance
Committee, reported a joint resolution
providing for the importation, free of
duty, of military supplies secured
abroad, into the United States, and
asked for its immediate consideration.
It was passed.
Several joint resolution bearing upon
the Cuban question were then intro
duced, each one containing a lively
sensation as it was read.
The first was by Allen of Nebraska,
recognizing the independence of Cuba.
Allen's resolution was, at his request,
laid on the table.
A declaration of war was next Intro
duced by Rawlins of Utah.
Senator Foraker of Ohio then pre
sented a resolution recognizing the In
dependence of Cuba and favoring
armed intervention. Foraker asked
that the resolution go to the Foreign
Relat mittee. He said that his
resolution had been long delayed. He
intended, he said, to present it at the
opening of the session last December,
but he "Withheld it at that time because
the President's message gave promise
that within a reasonable time definite
and decisive action would be taken by
the administration so soon as auton
uld be given a fair trial. A
â  time seems now to have

land. Autonomy. Foraker
had failed, but just as its
faliut â  ': tne' country was
niffl by the De Lorn? incident.
the excitement created by
this subsided when what has been
styled "the .Maine incident" threw the
country into a hurricane of excitement,
ice that time," said the Senator,
"we have been waiting patiently and
under restraint for the report of the
K..ard of Inquiry. That report is now
before the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions. Whatever may be done as to the
Maine Incident action must come on
the general Cuban question."
Senator Foraker said he hoped at a
later date to address the Senate at
length upon his resolution.
Frye Â°f Maine said he had not intend
ed to offer a resolution at this time, but
in view of others proposed he would
present the one he had prepared.
The resolutions were all, except Al
len's, referred to the Committee on For
eign Relations.
At the conclusion of the presentation
of resolutions Mason of Illinois was
recognized for a speech on the Presi
dent's message of yesterday. Mason
paid he believed it was due to the coun
try now to know the general expression
and intention of the members of the
Senate. While he would not apologize
for discussing the Cuban question at
this time, he did not intend by so do
ing any disrespect either to the Admin
istration or to the Committee on For
eign Relations when he said that he
was tired of the dilatory tactics that
had been employed for three years to
prevent assistance from the United
States to the Cubans. He continued:
"More than two years ago the plan of
the Spanish Government to starve the
women and children and non-comba
tants was begun. Every intelligent
man, woman and child was Informed of
It through the ordinary channels of in
formation, the newspapers, and by the
statements of disinterested witnesses,
day after day, week after week, month
after month and year after year, and it
had received practically no attention
from this Government until some of the
members of this body visited the scenes
of death and distress and brought back
to the United States, on their words of
honor that no picture had been drawn
by the press that fully stated *he hor
rors of the situation.
"Wh^n the order of concentration
came they cornered at least SOO Ameri
can citizens with the reeonceentrados
and refused to let them go out and
earn a legitimate and honest living. It
R'nount'd to Imprisonment. We claimed |
S o at th* time, though many professed
not to believe it until the honorable |
Senator from Vermont described the
dead line and the gun of the Spanish
Boldier that kept the reconcentrados to
gether Any other self-respecting na
tion "in the world would have ordered
their release and bettor treatment, or
they would have opened the gates ;t
hell on Morro Castle. This Govern
ment however, upon th*> suggestion of
the President, took $50,000 of the peo
ple's money out of the treasury of the
United States and begged permission
Of Spain for the privilege of feeding our
citizens American bread on Spanish
poll. lam not complaining; lam not
criticizing: there is no other such re
cord in all the history of the world,
only repeat this humiliating statement
to call attention to the fact that every
effort that has been made by the- Presi
dent has been construed by Spain to
bÂ« an act of cowardice and absolute .
end conclusive evidence that we are (
afraid of that mighty power and every
Buch act of careful consideration on our
part has made Spain more cruel to her
own people, and more insulting to us."
Mason then turned his attention to
the destruction of the Maine, saying:
"The battle-shin Maine, our gallant
chip. went down, and 268 of our gallant
Bailors with her. At the time every
citizen of the United States familiar
with the Spanish character felt ctonfi
dent it was Spanish treachery. < >ur
Bhip was there by right of custom, ten
dered hospitality, and also by treaty
contract she had an absolute right to
be there. Ine day closed and she rode I
the harbor a messenger of peace. No !
message had been sent by our execu
tive inconsistent with the national
honor of Spain. Our only offer was to
restore peace alike honorable to* all.
Our treasury had been opened to feed
her people. Definite plans were not
even suggested by the President, fear
ing to injure our relations with Spain.
Spain could not conqu ' her own in
surgents. Hud we been a grasping na
tion we could at any time within two
years have made aggressive and forci
ble annexation, taking advantage of
the crimes of Spain and the misfor
tunes of Cuba.
"The night came on, a dark, gloomy
night, a natural and proper time for
Spanish 'bravery.' Our men were
asleep in a friendly harbor. They were
never challenged to display their cour
age. They were not whipped in honor
able battle, but choked, burned, stran
gled and drowned without a chance to
die fighting for life, without a moment
to say a prayer. In the twinkling of an
eye they stood in the presence of their
Maker. Suppose ninety of them had
been United States Senators. Suppose
the balance had been members of Con
gress or made up of Judges and leading
professional and business men, would
forty days have elapsed before war be
gan? Or suppose each Senator had a
son or a father there? Do we tell our
children the truth when we say that
the life of every American citizen is of
equal value before the law? They
were not Senators â tht^y were sailors.
Their widows and orphans cry aloud to
us. The silent appeal of 268 seamen
comes to us again and again, 'We are
flesh of your flesh, bone of your bone
and blood of your blood; we lived and
died for the 'flag that shields -ou.'
What is to be our answer? Shall we
answer with money? Mr. President. I
speak only for myself, and I am for
war." (Applause in the galleries.)
"But gentlemen may say: 'Don't say
you are for war â say that you are for
armed intervention, which means war.'
I belive in calling things by their right
name. If we belive that murdering our
men, sinking our ships and lowering
our flag is not cause for war, say so
and refer it, as they did the Virginius
affair, and allow our brothers to be sold
like stock for gold. If it is a cause for
war, let us assume the responsibility
put upon us by the constitution and
say so, not only to Spain, but to the
whole world. Let us not say one thing
and mean another. For God's sake, let
us not Spanify our diplomacies, but
rather speak the truth and prove our
selves true disciples of James G.
Blame.
"I shall oppose any plan to assist
Spain to place any kind of autonomy
on Cuba. Spain cannot be trusted to
keep her promise, and we cannot un
dertake to compel her to. Aside from
that poor Cuba has paid a larger price
for liberty than we did, and she must
be free. I shall oppose any plan that
looks to forcing Cuba in the future to
pay Spain in cash for her liberty. Her
land is full of graves and her future
generations must not be mortgaged.
WILL DECLARE FOR
FORCIBLE INTERVENTION.
Resolution Likely to Be Reported by
the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
WASHINGTON, March 29.â Much in
terest is felt in the meeting of the Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Relations,
which is called from 10:30 a. m. to
morrow to consider the various reso
lutions introduced in the Senate. The
only question of doubt is whether the
committee will take action at its sitting
to-morrow. In view of the records of
the members on the Cuban question
ami tli'ir present attitude, there is no
uncertainty that their action will be
pronouncedly favorable to the Cubans.
Members of the committ<'f> individually
spoken express the opinion that thecom
mittee will report a resolution declaring
for forcible intervention. Such is the
purport of all the resolutions intro
duced to-day, and the rental feeling is
that any less radical action would be of
no avail.

TALKS OF PEACE,
PLANS FOR WAR
President McK-inley Now
Proposes to Build
Many Boats.
It Is Probable One Hundred
Torpedo- Boats and Destroy
ers Will Be Ordered.
Seven Million Dollars to Be Expended
in Strengthening the Navy at
Its Weakest Point.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 29.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Presi
dent McKinley is considering the ad
visability of investing $7,000,000 in the
construction of one hundred torpedo
destroyers and torpedo-boats. Should
there be any evidence of the failure
of the peace negotiations now in pro
gress there is no doubt in the minds of
naval officials that the President will
authorize the expenditure of this sum
of money in order that the navy may
be strengthened at its weakest point.
In anticipation of the direction of the
President to build the boats plans for
their hulls and machinery have been
prepared and contracts can be let aa
soon as the decision is formally an
nounced.
The proposition to build one hundred
torpedo boat destroyers and torpedo
boats arose as a result of the failure
of agents of this Government abroad to
purchase satisfactory vessels of these
types. Up to the present time but two
torpedo boats, one a sea-going boat and
the other intended only for harbor de
fense, have been secured and the au
thorities admit that there is little likeli
hood that any more boats will be
purchased.
In view of this fact Secretary Long
directed Chief Naval Constructor Hich
born and Engineer-in-Chief Melville to
report to him the number, displacement
and cost of torpedo-boat destroyers and
torpedo boats which should be built by
this Government. This report was
submitted to Secretary Long to-day,
and has been presented to the Presi
dent for official consideration. I under
stand that the report of -the officials
recommends the construction of about
thirty destroyers of from 325 to 350 tons
displacement, capable of making a
maximum speed of thiry knots an hour,
and to be built within a period of four
or five months. The torpedo boats are
to be each of about 100 tons displace
ment and capable of making a speed of
from twenty to twenty-two knots. The
boats must be completed within ninety
days. _^______^___

of Spain and its dependencies and the
United States and her territories. It
is as follows:
"That war be and the same is hereby
declared to exist between the Govern
ment of Spain and her dependencies

tories, and that the President of the

the same into effect."
LETTER OF
AN ADMIRER
An Interesting Feature of
the. Report on the
Maine Disaster.
Anonymous Information Con
cerning an Alleged Plot and
Death of Plotters.
But the Story Sent to the Havana
Consulate Wus Inaccurate and
Covild Not Be Verified.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlgps House,
Washington, March 129.
An Interesting feature of the pub
! lished report of the Maine testimony
issued from the Government printing
office to-day was the famous anony
i mous letter mentioned in the testimony
of Henry Drain, clerk of the Ameri-
I can consulate at Havana. The letter
was received by General Lee a few
days after the Maine disaster. It was
dated February 18, 1898, and signed,
"An Admirer." It was in Spanish,
written apparently by a fairly well ed
ucated person. It follows:
It should be remembered that at dawn
on the day of the terrible catastrophe
an individual was killed in a small boat,
j together with another wiio was found
â¢ wounded and a prisoner. They were go
i ing about the cruisers Maine and Alfonso
XII, and as the said individuals are of
the worst antecedents as harbor thieves,
I have interested myself in investigat
ing what connection this occurrence could
have had with the explosion of the Maine,
and I have discovered that these two
men, together with another, who is called
Fepe Taco, had bought in a hardware
store in Mercadores street, called Marina,
a hose such as is used by divers, and
that the three left Regla in a small boat,
which they placed under the wharves of
Santa C'atahna. and they were loitering
about more than an hour and a half,
while Pepe Taco, who is a caulker u.ri'l
diver, probably the best in these parts,
did the work to bring about the explo
sion of the Maine. With this data I went
to Regla and discovered that the family
of the dead man, who lived in the ut
most misery in a hut In Rodriguez Bap
tism street, had moved to a well-fur
nished one on Gelabert street. There I
learned that they had agreed with some
merchants of Muralla street for the
work of blowing up the ship for the sum
of $6000â 52000 in advance and the other
$4000 after seeing the result.
But, as they did not come out of the
adventure very well, having been at
tacked when they were retiring, the re
sult of which was the death of one, who
left his teeth in the boat, and another one
wounded, the third one has not yet pre
sented himself to collect tho rpst of the
money, and it could be probably secretly
done that, by paying him the rest that
the others will not now pay him. he would
declare tho truth of all this. The one
whom I called the third party is the
diver, Pepe Taco, who is unwounded, who
is no doubt afraid to present himself to
collect the rest. In Muralla street, they
tell me, was the place where the business
was arranged with Garcia C'orujedo, Vil
las T'ssa. Maribona and others whom I
do not remember. The man who is arrest
ed is being administered with morphine
constantly to see if he will die and not
give evidence, so as not, they express it,
to spoil the affair after it has come off so
much to their taste.
I certify that the above is a true copy.
A. MARIX,
Lieutenant-Commander, U. S. N., and
Judge-Advocate.
Drain, the consular clerk, stated in
his evidence that an effort was made
to ascertain the authenticity of the let
ter, although the consulate was hand
icapped, having no secret service fun<i
Witness discovered, however, that the
name Pepe Taco must have been a
mistake, as the man mentioned died a
few days before the explosion took
place. Witness thought the name
should have been Pepe Barquin, who
died a couple of days after the explo
sion. ,
MINES AND
TORPEDOES
Shore Connections Estab

paratus Adjusted.
Submarine Agencies Can Be

Shcrt Notice.
Captain Danes' Battery I, From Angel
Island, Takes Station at the
Presidio.
The engineers of the Pacific division
of the United States army, who are
charged with the duty of planting tor
pedoes and submarine mines to defend
the harbor of San Francisco, have their
work well advanced. Colonel Charles
R. Suter. Major William H. Heuer and
Major Charles E. L. B. Davis of the
Engineer Corps have conducted their
operations with great activity and re
markable secrecy.
General Shatter, commanding the De
partment of California, having the
j right to know everything concerning
| the fortifications of the harbor, was ad-
I vised yesterday of the progress which
j had been made by the engineer officers.
jlt transpires that the bay and the
! channels of the Golden Gate have been
i charted and locations designated for
j the mines and floating torpedoes. Shore
connections have been established and
electrical apparatus f or wiring the
mines and torpedoes has been adjusted.
It has been known to a few on the In
side that the engineers were working
vigorously to get everything in proper
shape for the protection of the harbor,
i but it was not developed until yester
day that so much advancement In the
work had been made.
Orders were received yesterday from
General Nelson A. Miles, -Â»omma.ndlng
the United States army, directing that
at all artillery posts, not already pro
vided with suitable charts, post com
manders will have compiled the best
charts possible for the use of their re
spective commands. The charts are to
be prepared by detail of officers and
men from such data as may be on hand
or readily obtainable. Suitable base
lines will be laid off, carefully measured
and accurately marked on the harbor
chart.
Where no range and position finder
has been installed, requisition will be
made on the Ordnance Department for
! an auxiliary range and position finder,
in which the height in feet of the in
strument station above mean low tide
shall be stated. Where necessary to
1 supplement, or be used in place
j of the range finder, base end instru
ments will be asked for. Requisitions
will include platting board material. In
the meantime arrangements will be im
provised for position finding.
Where electrical installations have
not already been made, requisitions on
the Signal Department will be at once
forwarded for necessary telephones, tel
ephone and telegraph materials for
connecting the batteries, base ends and
platting stations.
At posts where 8-inch converted rifles
' and 10 and 15 inch smoothbore guns are
I already mounted and bearing upon
channels, and especially upon the pro
posed location of mine fields, post com
manders will place them in as perfect
condition as possible, and will report
the result of an accurate inspection of
these guns, carriages, platforms, in
! struments, equipments and ammunition
iin the quarterly report to be made
March 31.
The report which will be forwarded
from this military department to-mor
row will be elaborate and interesting.
! It will show what has been done on the
lines directed by the orders from head
quarters of the army in Washington.
By direction of General Shafter, Cap
tain Henry C. Danes' Battery I. Third
Artillery, was yesterday transferred
from Angel Island to barracks at the
Presidio. The wooden quarters near
the hospital that were occupied by the
light batteries when the Fifth Artil
lery was stationed at the Presidio were
occupied again last evening. The or
der of transfer directed the battery to
report to Colonel Evan Miles, com
manding officer at the Presidio, as a
part of the garrison of the Fort Point
fortifications. No time was lost by
the artillerymen In getting away from
Angel Island. The transportation was
Immediately provided by the Govern
ment steamer General McDowell. There
remain at Angel Island the headquar
ters of the Third Artillery Regiment,
the band and Battery G. The trans
fer was rendered necessary by the ex
tra duty required In mounting and car-
Ing for the guns at Fort Point.
Captain Sigsbee Reports.
WASHINGTON, March 29.â Captain
Sigsbee visited the Navy Department
reporting his arrival and expressing
his readiness to assume any duties that
the department wished to assign him.
He is well known at the department,
having served as chief of the hydro
graphic office, and his return after the
dramatic and tragic experience he has
passed through attracted the greatest
interest of officials, subordinates and
the throngs of tourists who just now
happen to be making the Navy De
partment a center of their observa
tions.

OFFICERS
GUILTY

Most Significant Portions of the
Evidence Before the Court
of Inquiry Not Given Out
to the Public.
BOSTON, March 29.â The Journal
publishes the following: Washington
special: In abstracts sent out last
night the most significant portion re
lating to the plot to blow up the Maine
was omitted. These portions are re
garded by a few naval officials who
have seen them as of greater impor
tance than any other part of the evi
dence. The name of one witness is not
given In the testimony for obvious rea
sons, for fear of Spanish harm to him.
This man testified to a conversation
between Spanish officers relating to the
destruction of the Maine. A part of
the transcript relative to this follows:
Examined by Judge Advocate
(through interpreter) â I have heard
that on Tuesday morning you over
heard a certain conversation which re
ferred to the possible sinking of the
Maine. Will you please state to the
court all you can in regard to that mat
ter?
Interpreter â At about half-past 7 on
the morning of the 15th he was sitting
on the front seat in the bow of the
ferry-boat; there were about four feet
distant three officers, two of the army,
one of the navy, of Spain, and besides
a citizen, a stout man about 50 years
of age. They were conversing about
the Maine. He said one of the army
officers said in the Circulo Militaro
(the military club here on the Prado).
"that is nearly arranged." The citi
zen inquired, "Will not making ex
plosions in the bay run a great risk
to the city of Havana?" The citizen
inquired that from the Spanish officer
who made the first remark. He says
that the officer replied "No." That it
was arranged so that it would simply
explode, open the vessel and she would
sink Immediately. Then the other
man, with an exclamation apparently

BRADY ON
THE NEEDS
OF ALASKA
Governor of the Terri-
Tory Is a Guest of
Seattle.
En Route to Washington
to Urge Necessary
Legislation.
Wants the General Land Laws
Extended to the North-
em Country.
TITLES HARD TO OBTAIN.
Ons Condition Which Militates
Against the Progress of _
Alaska.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 29. â Governor
Brady of Alaska arrived in Seattle to
day en route for "Washington. Just
before leaving the north the Governor
made a trip over the trails from Dyea
and Skaguay. In an interview with
The Call correspondent to-night the
Governor said:
"I am going to try to effect several
things for Alaska while I am in "Wash
ington. First, lam going to make a
strong effort to get the general land
laws of the United States extended to
Alaska. That will require a simple
act, entailing less than a dozen words,
but it would be a very important one
to the people of this district. I con
sider that the imposslDllity to secure
tit!" to land in Alaska has done more
than anything else to hold its growth
bacfc. Immediate help in that regard
ought to be given. All departments
of business and commercial develop
ment are paralyzed and the wheels of
justice are clogged by the want of land
title.
â¢'I shall try, too, while in Washing
tun, to expose the many defects of the
present bills in Congress relating to
Alaska, especially that proposing three
judares, one to sit at St. Michael, one at
Sitka and one at Circle City. The first
named place is a military reservation
and the latter is almost deserted now.
The measure has too many defects to
enumerate.
"In my last report I recommended the
appointment of a commission, which
should sit in Alaska and with the help
of the people who are interested ar
range a code of laws for our govern
ment. As an example of the absence of
laws which we suffer from there is no
way t" protect or take care of an in
sane person in Alaska unless he is a
criminal. We had an insane man over
at Sitka who punched out his own eyes.
]t takes a year to communicate with
the Government and get an order to
have the patient removed to an asylum
near Washington, D. C.
"A fine class of men is coming to
Alaska now. I noticed what a stalwart,
inU-iliKent, good-natured crowd it was
on the trail. Probably not one in a
hundred of those men intends to make
Alaska his home. If we had a good
code of laws many of them would stay
and we could soon do as California did
â apply for admission as a State in
stead of a territory. That vast country
would make a magnificent State."
Governor Brady was asked what he
thought of the project of bringing rein
deer into the district. He said that he
considered the introduction of them
would be a boon to the people.
Two other matters were to have oc
cupied the Governor's attention in
Washington. These were visits to the
Agricultural and Postal Departments
of the Government. The Governor be
lieves that the possibilities of Alaska
in an agricultural way are almost illim
itable. The whole mater he has par
tially abandoned because of the an
nouncement just made that a special
officer with full power to act is now en
route to Alaska to make changes in the
present very inadequate and unsatis
factory postal arrangements. Governor
Brady insisted that the saloons in
Alaska will be closed if he is able to
have it done. He said:

Water for Yolo Farms.
WOODLAND, March 29.â A large force
of men was put to work this morning ',
constructing a temporary dam on tho ]
Bite of the old Moore dam, and it is ex- !
pected that water will be turned on the j
parched fields that are under the ditch j
system by next Monday. Work has npver
before been commenced on the ditches j
until the Ist of April, and the time for
turning the water on has varied from tho !
Ist of May to the middle of June. The
demand for water is so urgent that Mr. j
Moore has decided to wait no longer.
These ditches can supply but a limited
area, but they seem to be the only sal- |
vation of the farmers in the vicinity of
Woodland.
Robber Drops His Loot.
SAUSALITO, March 29.â The safe and
all the money stolen from the ticket of

WOODLAND, March 29.â Word has
been received that N. M. Weaver, ex-
Sheriff of this county, and Mrs. Adah
O'Farrell, both of this city, were mar

BRINGS NEWS
FROM COPPER
RIVER REGION
Return of the Valencia After a
Most Trying Voyage to New
Northern Gold Fields.
SEATTLE, March 29. âThe steamer Valencia returned to Seattle
to-day from the mouth of the Copper River. The trip was a most
exciting one, and between rebellious passengers, who wanted to seize
the ship, and a terrible storm "in the North Pacific, the officers and crew
had a trying experience. The Valencia's troubles began shortly after
she left this port on March 6, with 590 passengers, the largest load
which ever left this or any other port for Copper River. The Va
lencia brings advices from Copper River up to March 24, which are
of an assuring nature. The prospects of the 2000 people, who went
to the Copper River country during- the past two months, are much Im
proved and a few have already reached the summit.
Mail Carrier Jackson returned on March 20 to Copper River from a
trip to the summit of the glacier. He tells the following story:
"Four men who went up on the schooner Bering Sea on her first trip
have reached timber on the other side of the glacier. John Murphy
and three others have nearly reached the timber line. Fifty men have
everything on the summit and are ready to start down the other slope.
The remainder of the crowd is scattered over the twenty miles of the
glacier, between salt water and the summit. There most of the trou
ble seems to be in packing wood, which has to be carried from the
timber line. Every one is working hard and making good progress. I ,'
Jackson makes the trip to the summit in one day. It is two and
a quarter miles from the edge of the glacier to the top of the third
bench, and seventeen and a half miles from this to the summit. The
first bench is but eighty feet in width, but the grade is very heavy.
The second bench is 225 feet wide, at about half as heavy a grade as
on the. first. The third and fourth benches are rolling. It is ten
miles down hill from the summit to the timber line. Then comes a
lake thirty miles long. The distance from the lake to the river is
twelve miles.
Jackson further said: "Fifty people have gone up the river over
the ice from Orca, but as the ice Is getting soft this route will not be
available very much longer. I went up to the first bench of the Valdes
glacier from the steamer. The men have fastened a snatch block at
the summit of the bench and got their goods up with very little trou
ble. They load their sleds, to which is fastened a long rope. This
they run through tne snatch block and five or six men get hold of the
other end. They run down the hill and the sled goes up like a flash."
RELIEF TRAINS
ARE STRANDED
Supplies for Dawson Yet
Stored Away at
Dyea.
Major Rucker at a Loss as to
How to Dispose of
Them.
Two Hundred of tha Reindeer Will
Be Sent Over the Dalton
Trail.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 29.â Major L. H.
Rucker, U. S. A., returned to Seattle
to-day and proceeded to Fort Walla
Walla. He has been in Dyea for the
past month, whither he went with the
Government relief expedition that was
to carry food into the Klondike coun
try. In an interview Major Rucker
â  said:
"That abandoned relief expedition has
! caused me more trouble than a year
of regular army life. If is now pretty
well scattered. Five officers and twenty
men of the expedition, under command
of Captain Eldridge, are at Haines
Mission. They arrived there on March
24. In a few days they will start on
an exploring expedition with the idea
of finding a suitable ail-American
route to the mighty Yukon. The Sem
inole, with the Government reindeer
and Laplanders, was expected to reach
Haines Mission on last Monday. The
party that goes over the Dalton trail
will take 200 of the reindeer and a num
ber of the Laplanders.
â¢â¢Captain Abercrombie, who Is to
head the party that will explore the
Copper River country for the War De
partment, is now at Portland, but will
go north this week with his party. The
Government pack train that went
north on the Lucille is still encamped
at Dyea. I don't know what will be
done with it. The bulk of the supplies
that were to be taken to Dawson is
ail at Dyea. It has not yet been de
cided what disposition will be made of
the supplies. The Dalton trail party
took its supplies out of those on the
relief expedition.
"Thousands of men are working he
roically to cross the Chilkoot and
White Pass trails. All who have the
proper grit will get over the pass by
the time the lakos and rivers open up.
Five acres at Sheep Camp are piled
up close with the outfits that have
been hauled up from Dyea.
"The outfits are simply piled on the
prow and left without any one to guard
them until the owner gets all his goods
to fihoep Camp. Nothing is ever stolen
rtn<l the packers never worry about
their goods. Some of the goods taken
up last winter are being dug out of the
snow.
"If a man does not want to haul his
outfit there are three ways by whicn he
can get it to the summit. There Is a
train run by electricity, a rope and
tackle arrangement and a gasoline en
gine method. By these means seventy
five tons a day are handled. There are
men, Indians and dogs on the trail in
Ke numbers. I know vory litt'e about
White Pass trail, but people are
ing over it in good shape."

WASHING! ON, March 29.â The House
to-day quietly proceeded with the order
of the day. the consideration of private

the rules of debating the all-absorbing
topic, but members stood abou^ the cloak

OFFICER AND
MANIAC FIGHT
Thrilling Encounter in
the Marin County
Prison.
Under Sheriff Subdues a Crazed
Prisoner After a Hard
Struggle.
Combat in si Cell Which the Imbecile
Had Flooded From the
Water Pipe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. March 29.â A thrill
ing encounter between Under Sheriff
John Hannon and a madman took
place in a flooded cell in the County
Jail this morning-. Splashing about in
a foot of water the two men fought for
supremacy, one almost naked and rav
ing like an enraged brute, the other
cool and determined. The battle lasted
fifteen minutes and the officer finally
conquered.
Nijrhtwatchman Miller found Joe
Pochello, formerly a blacksmith in San
Rafael, roaming about the streets at
midnight, shouting and acting in an in
sane manner. After a brief tussle he
placed the fellow in a cell in the Coun
ty Jail in the basement of the Court
house. Pchello, as the night grew
apace, became more violent and threw
himself against the great iron door and
beat the walls with his fists. lie
stripped the clothes from his back and
threw them about, shouting incoherent
sentences. Pulling the mattress in the
cell over to the iron door, he turned
the water on in the stationary basin in
the cell and allowed it to flood the cell,
the mattress keeping the water from
passing through the cracks under Ihe
door. The madman plunged about
the cell, now attempting to swim and
again throwing the water over every
thing.
When Under Sheriff Hannon arrived
at the jail this morning he heard the
racket and started to investigate. Peer
ing through iron bars, shaking the
door and shouting, the madman refused
to notice the officer, who called to him
to turn off the water. Seeing that des
perate measures must be resorted to,
Hannon unlocked the door and threw
it open. A flood of water rushed out
and soaked him up to the knees. Brush
ing- aside the madman Hannon at
tempted to turn off the water. Po
chello made a lunge fcrrward and at
tempted to drag the officer away. In
a moment the two came together in a
fierce conflict.
The insane prisoner attempted to
seize the Under Sheriff by the throat
and his long bare arms v/ound them
selves around Hannon's neck. "With a
mighty effort the Under Sheriff broke
away from the grasp of the maniac and
threw him headlong to the floor of the
cell. With this advantage the officer
turned the water off, and, getting a
hold on the madman, dragged him out
of the soaked cell and held him down
by the throat. Without releasing his
hold on the prisoner Hannon dragged
him over to the main entrance and led
him into one of the tanks.
No sooner was the prisoner released
than he began to tear around In his
new quarters, shouting, gesticulating
and pounding the bars and doors. All
day he has stood with the perspiration
streaming down his body and worked
away at the iron bars on the cell door.

HEAD INTO
THE NOOSE
Frank Belew Admits
His Crime in
Court.
Changes His Plea From
"Not Guilty" to
"Guilty."
Dixon Murderer Throws Him
self Upon the Mercy
of the Law.
HIS ACTION VOLUNTARY.
Ready to Undergo Punishment for
the Killing of Brother and
Sister.
SUISUN, March 29.â When a rumor
gained circulation a week or so ago
that Frank Belew had decided to plead
guilty to the murder charge again6t
him, some doubt existed as to the sin
cerity of the accused man's intention.
A more changeable prisoner than Belew
never occupied a cell and no credence
whatever was placed in his statement
about withdrawing the plea of not
guilty entered at the arraignment In
February last.
But Belew is a peculiar man and he â ,
is as wavering in his resolutions as he
Is variable in temperament. This morn
ing he infor 1 the authorities that he
was ready to plead guilty and that he
had firmly made up his mind.
Belew was brought into the Superior
Court. When Belew was ordered to
stand up Judge Buckles said:
"Belew, you were arraigned here on
February 24 upon information charging
you with the crime of murder and your "â¢
plea that day was that you were no
guilty. I have now been informed tha
yuu "desire to withdraw that plea ant
that you are here for the purpose o
pleading guilty. There are some ques
tions 1 want to ask of you before you
plead.
'The crime with which you ar
charged, as I understand simply fron
the confession that I have hoard yo'
have made, is one that would merit th
extreme penalty of the lawâ that is
hanging. If you were tried and con
Victed by a jury the jury might say
that you be Imprisoned in the Stat
Prison for life, or the jury might sa>
that it is murder in the first degree
which would impel this court to pas
the death penalty upun you. I wish t
ask you whether any inducement has
been held out to you to plead guilty by |
any one?"
Belew, without the slightest hesita
tion, said:
"No, sir; there has not."
He added that he acted upon
his own suggestion. The court, ad
dressing Belew, said:
"I warn you that In plead
ing guilty you need expect np greater
leniency than though you were tried by
a jury- The jury's duty is to deter
mine your guilt, whether you.be hanged
or sent to prison, and the court has
the same duty. The crime is one of
the worst kinds of murder, if it is as
rumored, and as you have confessed.
What is your plea?"
Belew answered without the slight
est tremor in his voice or any visible
sign of nervousness:
"Guilty, and I ask the mercy of the
court."
The case was then continued to Tues
day, April T>. District Attorney Dev
lin will adduce testimony necessary to
establish the degree of the crime, and
Belew's attorney will probably call
witnesses in support of mitigating cir
cumstances.
The murder to which Belew pleaded
guilty was one of the most revolting in
the history of crimes in the United.
States. Susie and Lewis Belew, the vic
tims, were two of the most popular
young people in Dixon. On November
8 they died, after an illness of
less than twenty-four hours. There
were suspicions of foul play from the
first, and suspicion pointed to Frank
Belew, as was indicated by The Call
exclusively the day after the death of
the victims.
At the funeral Frank Belew was ap
parently one of the saddest of the
mourners. He was dressed in a suit of
solemn black, and he moved softly
among the mourners, as if he suffered
deeply. In spite of this fact there was
an almost unanimous feeling that he
had committed the deed.
On the night of November 7, while
professing friendship for those he mur
dered, Frank partook of supper with
them at their humble little cottage in
town. It was then that he poisoned
the teakettle, the waters of which were
used for making a stew and coffee the
next morning. Within a few hours
after breakfast Susie and Lewis were
taken deathly ill, as was Bruno Klein,
the livery hand, who boarded with
them. He was cole survivor of the
fiendish act.
The Call, convinced that Frank Be
lew was the guilty man, kept reporters
on the case from the outset, covering
the field for weeks after all others had
abandoned the case. The result of
this vigilance was the arrest of Belew
on the night of February 3, and his
subsequent confession. Full details of
the confession that led to the arrest
and of the arrest were printed in The
Call exclusively, making the greatest
newspaper heat of the character in the
history of San Francisco.
By working up the case and aiding in
the preliminary part of the work The
Call has thus saved the taxpayers of
Solano County many thousands of dol
lars, as the case was bo complete as to
render useless the delay and cost of a
long trial.

AUSTIN NOT
A SUCCESS
AS MAYOR
Record of One ofÃea's
Candidates at
San Jose.
Has Already Been Tried
and Found Wholly
Wanting.
Former Administration Noted
for High Taxes and Big
Deficits.
WANTS THE PLACE AGAIN.
Though â  Commercial and Official
Failure, Ho la Faithful to
the Boss.
Special Dlsi-atch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 29.â 1n the "gang"
and out of it, Paul P. Austin Is looked
upon as the king-pin of the People's
Municipal ticket, the aggregation of
candidates backed by Boss Rea and
his adherents. If any one has any
doubt of the feaity of Austin to Rea
let him but utter a word of dispraise
of Rea in the presence of Austin, or let
him be present when the boss is issuing
orders to Austin for execution in the
Board of Supervisors, of which Austin
is a member, or anywhere else. There
is no question in the mind oi" any one
familiar with the local political situa
tion for the last decade or more that a
vote for Austin is certainly a vote for
the "gang" of which Rea is the boss
as if that vote were cast direct for the
boss himself, or for Johnnie Mackenzie.
If anything were needed to confirm
this idea it is furnished in the columns
of the "gang" organ this morning. The
Mercury, with a pride all its own. sets
Austin on a high pedestal for the ad
miring inspection of the people whom it
ia seeking to delude in this campaign.
Its laudation finds vent in the follow
ing, which ig a portion of an editorial:
Mr. Austin is one of the people's candi
eatts for election to the Appointing
is...ard, a position oi paramount import
ance and responsibility under the new
charter. It will be the duty of the Ap
pointing Board to appoint the members of
the several city departments. During its
brief period of existence it will have not
only the present but largely the future
destinies of San Jose in its hands. The
lecessity, therefore, of electing to that
board only men of the highest ability and
Integrity, who can -<.â  absolutely depend
ed upon to be governed in their orlicial
actions by the most earnest regard for
the city's welfare, must be apparent to
every voter. Such a man is :vir. Austin,
who as Mayor looked after the interests
of the city with sagacity and fidelity.
All of this is only too true, with the
exception of the last sentence, which
! reads:
"Such a man is Mr. Austin, who, as
J Mayor, looked after the interests of the
! city with sagacity and fidelity."
The official records and acls of Mr.
l/'Austin and his commercial career in
! this city prove just the contrary. If
'"iily men of the highest business abil
| ity" should be selected as members of
the Appointing Boardâ and of this thevre
can be no doubt â then Mr. Austin is ab
solutely disqualified. Not only has his
1 commercial career here been a flagrant
| failure, but in the last three years he
i has succeeded in accumulating a judg
i ment indebtedness of more than $27,000,
! not a dollar of which has been satisfied,
! as shown by the records of the Superior
i Court. It is not likely that a man inca-
I pable of taking care of his own proper
ty will prove more capable of taking
care of what belongs to others or to the
city.
But Mr. Austin demonstrated his ut
ter unfitness for public affairs when he
! sat in the Mayor's chair of this city
j from 1894 to 1896, and was evidently dis
j posed to do anything rather than be
"governed in his olficial actions by the
most earnest regard for the city's wel
fare."
The records show that for the first
year of Mr. Austin's term as Mayor of
San Jose â that is, on January 1, IS95 â
there was a deficit in the city treasury,
j exclusive of new taxes collected, of
I $32,619 93, and that a year later this
I deficit had gro to $55,155 21.
But this was not the worst feature
of his administration. Ex-Mayor Aus
tin has the unenviable distinction of
| having caused, by his administration of
the city's affairs, the highest two tax
levies ever imposed on the people of
San Jose. Previous to his advent as
executive of this city the tax ra*e had
never exceeded $1 25 on the 5100, though
j before the "gang" got its fatal grasp
' on the municipality the rate had been
las low as 85 cents on the $100. Dur
| ing the first year of Austin's admtnis
j tration the rate had to be increased to
\ $1 40, and during the second year it was
i $1 35 on the $100, yet when Ausvin went
! out of office the annual deficit in the
city treasury had increased to the
enormous amount of $58,155 21. That
was a period of clover for the "gang"
! and its numerous parasites, while the
I taxpayers had to labor harder than ever
i to keep the public crib full for the tax
j eaters.
It would be an insult to the intelli-
I gence of the voters of San Jose to ask
j them if they thought a man with the
record that Austin has made for him
| self "looked after the interests of the
city with sagacity and fidelity." And
it is of this kind of material that the
favorite and presumably the strongest
candidate of the People's Municipal
ticket is constructed. The people of
San Jose can best answer if they can
afford to elect him and his colleagues
on the boss' ticket. As a commercial
factor Mr. Austin proved himself to
be void of business talent; as a Mayor
of the city of San Jose his adminis
tration was the most extravagant in
the city's history, as the result of either
gross incompetency or infidelity.
Escape from the rule of such men
as Austin, and others subservient to
boss and "gang" nomination, lies in
voting the New Charter Club ticket
straight from top to bottom.
Another large and enthusiastic meet
ing under the auspices of the New
Charter Club was held in the Fourth
Ward to-night at the corner of Pond
and Orchard streets. The speakers
! were S. E. Crosman, D. M. Burnett, J.
j M. Burnett, J. M. Allen, J. P. Jarman,
I C. L. Witten, Dr. McDougal and J. J.
| Southeimer. Boss rule and its evil ef-
I fects on the people and property of a
city were the subjects under discussion.
The audience was made to understand
how it alone could apply the remedy

MERCED", March 29.â Constable Tol
lack and Deputy Sheriff Ed Stockird
are on the track of two men in the
foothills in the vicinity of Indian Gulch
who are supposed to be members of
the gang that held up the Southern Pa
cific train at Cross Creek a few days
ago.
About 1 o'clock yesterday morning
two men drove into Indian Gulch in a |
carriage, with a single horse. One of j
them alighted and aroused the store- j
keeper of that place, saying he wished j
to make some purchases. The man who j
remained in the carriage was bare- i
headed. The one who went into the j
store was tall and slim and wore a ;
long overcoat. It was observed by j
the proprietor of the store that he kept I
his right hand in his overcoat pocket
all the time, using the left hand to ex- |
amine the goods and pay for them. His
purchases consisted mostly of canned j
goods and a hat, the latter article evi
dently being for the man in the car- j
riage. The purchases amounted to j
about $18 and were paid for in silver j
dollars, several of the coins being con
siderably disfigured, as though having
been struck with a hammer or dam
aged by an explosion.
The man then got into the carriage |
and the pair drove away. The actions i
of the two aroused the suspicions of j
the storekeeper and he notified the au- |
thorities as soon as he could get word
to them. The Sheriff's office of Mer
ced County was notified at about 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon and
Messrs. Stockird and Mack left Imme
diately for Indian Gulch.
To-day the Sheriff's office received a
message from Stockird, asking for help,
and Sheriff Warfield, Ed Hussey and â 
Elmer Pedlar, heavily armed, left for
the gulch. Stockird said they had the i
horse and carriage belonging to the j
two men, had the men located and sur- j
rounded and had secured some of the I
stolen coin.
Semorile, the storekeeper, was shown
a photograph of Cliff Regan, and iden
tlfied it as that of one of the men who
was at his store.* It is almost a cer- !
tainty that Regan led the train rob- ;
bers, and if so the officers have a crafty
and dangerous man to deal with.
This evening a special train arrived j
over the Southern Pacific from Fresno
with a posse headed by ex-Sheriff |
Meade, who at once left for the moun
tains.

Arthur and Talien Wan.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 29.â
Official Messenger publishes a ciruclar
which has been telegraphed by Count
Muravieff, the Russian Minister for
Foreign Affairs, to the representatives
of Russia abroad. It is as follows:
By virtue of a convention signed at
Peking on March 27. Port Arthur and
the port of Talien Wan and the terri
tories adjacent have been ceded to Rus
sia in usufruct by China. You are re
quested to notify the Government
whereto you are accredited . adding
that the above-mentioned ports and j
territories will be immediately occupied
by Russian troops and that the Rus- |
sian flag will be hoisted by the side of
the Chinese flag, You may at the same
time inform the Foreign Minister that
the port of Taiien Wan will be open to
foreign trade, and that the largest
measure of hospitality will be extended
to the ships of all friendly nations.
An official communication issued to â 
the press adds: "The cessions are for ;
twenty-five years, but may be extend- I
ed later by common accord. Further, !
China has conceded the right of con
structing a railroad to connect the ports
with the trans- Siberian main line."
After statins that the arrangement |
is the direct and natural consequence I
of amicable relations between two j
neighboring states anxious to advance
the interests of their peoples, the offi- j
cial communication continues:
"While safeguarding the integrity :
.iiul sovereisrrrp of China and satisfy
ing the essential needs of Russia, the
arrangement injures the interests of
no foreign state. On the contrary, it
affords all nations the possibility of
entering in the near future into rela- j
tions with the river regions of the Yel
low Sea, hitherto closed to them. The
opening of Talien Wan to the mer- ,
chant ships of all nations will create
aAew and wide-awake market for ;
o'nmerce and industry, owing to the i
trans-Siberian line, which is henceforth \
destined to connect the extremities of i
two continents and the Old World. The
arrangement, therefore, is of high
historical value to Russia, and should
be hailed as a fortunate event by all j
those who have at heart the benefits
of peace and development of good re- ,
lations among nations."
LONDON, March 30.â The St. Peters- â 
burg correspondent of the Times says: j
The greatest indifference, amounting
almost to contempt, is shown here from |
any possible British protest against the j
Russo-Chinese agreement. The Novoe j
Vremya declares: England will never ;
go beyond a protest. Her predominance ;
in the Far East is gone forever and it i
will be worse for her if she fails to come
to a timely agreement with Russia, j
France and Germany.

LEADER SHOT IN THE ARM
Train Robbers Commence Operations
by Firing on the Engineer and
Fireman at Grants Station.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 29.â The j
! westbound Santa Fe overland was held j
â¢up at 12:30 o'clock this morning at i
; Grants Station, on the line of the old
Atlantic & Pacific road, in New Mexico.
The robbers secured nothing, and were â 
I put to flight, owing to the special guard j
'of Wells, Fargo & Co. in the express
car, Charles N. Fowler. His coura
geous conduct saved the express com
pany a large sum of money, according
to information received in this city by
; Superintendent Pridham of Wells, Far
go & Co.
The story of the attempted hold-up is
quite sensational. The train had
stopped at Grants, as usual, when the
â¢ engineer and fireman were immediately
. upon by bandits, the fireman be
ing wounded and the engineer forced
from the cab. The conductor was at
: the station. Two of the robbers then
pulled the train slowly down from the
station about a thousand feet, while the
others cracked their firearms at pas
senger car windows and at the express
car, through which they made several
holes.
After this attempt to intimidate the
; express messengers and passengers
they stopped the train and prepared to
break into the express car. But they
had failed to reckon on the guard in
side â Special Agent Fowler. Fowler had
; kept quiet while the train was pulled j
, away from the station, but when it i
: came to a standstill he unlocked and j
! opened the door and jumped out, rifle
in hand, right among the bandits.
These worthies were so taken back
that before they could put a hole
through Fowler he had plugged one of j
them in the arm. The wounded man;
made a break for his horse and the
others followed. Fowler was unable to
hit any one of them, however, as they ,
warily dodged about in the half light,
i rendering his shots ineffective.
When Fowler winged him the wound- j
ed man exclaimed: "I'm shot; get me >
away from here; we can't finish this
Job to-night." He seemed to be the '.
leader, and when he quailed the others i
j made no further resistance. Fowler I
1 followed them as they ran, but they |
pot to their horses and whisked away
i before he could get in another effective i
i shot, the men being familiar with the
ground and consequently nimbler.
The nervy guard returned to the train
after a short chase and prepared him- i
i self to stay and join the hunt for the '
] men. As soon as possible officers were ,
wired for and before morning the coun
i try was being scoured on every hand.
| The men. Fowler says, are all Ameri
' cans and mounted on good horses. No
' damage was done to the train except i
to drill a few bullet holes into it, and i
no one was hurt but the fireman. The j
robbers did not get at the treasure in j
j the express car, and the train presently ;
: proceeded on its way to this city.
Charles Fowler has been in the em
; ploy of Wells. Fargo & Co. for many
years as a guard. He is a Texan by
birth and is a life-long frontiersman.
TWO FISHERMEN
SAVE SIX LIVES
Rescue of a Sailing Party In
a Gale Off Long
Beach.
Taken From Their Frail Craft Just
a Moment Before It Is
Capsized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. March 29.â Two fisher
men to-day save-d the lives of six people
at the risk of their own. The brave men
are Ford Alvarez and John McGarvin,
and they reside at Long Beach, a point on
the coast seventeen miles from this city.
A party of six, including Captain Clyde
Simmons, Ray Julian, Rev. Mr. Knox and
Messrs. Wilson, Simmons and Stiles, left
Long Beach early this morning for a sail
in a boat which ordinarily was perfectly
safe. Shortly after they had left the
wharf and proceeded a short distance a
gale blew up from the east, which is
something unusual at this time of the
year, and it would have been utterly im
possible for the party in the sailboat to
have ever got to shore.
Fishermen Alvarez and McGarvin were
coming in with a load of lish in a row
boat. With great difficulty they suc
ceeded in taking all the party off the sail
boat and bringing them safely to shÂ»rn.
although compelled to sacrifice their load
of fish. A few moments after the res
cued persons had been taken off the sail
boat capsized, and at dark it was seen
about 1000 feet from shore with nothing In
sight but the mast and spars and with
sail on.

CAMP GROUNDS
AT SANTA CRUZ
De Lavega Park Tract to Be
Tendered to the State
and Nation.

XlI Dispatch to The Call.
XTA CRUZ, March 29.â Since the
rior Court of the city and county
in Francisco has rendered Judg
. confirming the title of the city
and county of Santa Cruz to De La
veaga Heights, the people have been
quite anxious to know just what steps
the city officials would take in regard
to this beautiful tract. It came into
the possession of Santa Cruz thro.itrh
the generosity of Jose de Laveaga, who
! bequeathed to the city 568 acres of
i land. Mayor H. H. Clark has issued
I a letter in which he says:
"In order that all may know my
views, I will here state it is my pur
pose to take such steps as may be ne
cessary to tender to the State of Cali
fornia and to the United States Gov
ernment the free use of so much of said
property as may be needed for a
camp and drill ground, and target
range, upon such terms and conditions
by legislative enactment by the State
Legislature as will secure the annual
encampment of both State and regular
i troops stationed on the coast."
He says that when once the State
! accepts this as its camp and drill
j ground all the military organizations
will by law be required to hold their
encampments at this place. He con
| eludes by saying:
"Suitable portions of the ground will
be improved for park purposes and
public picnic grounds, and also for such
athletic sports as may be deemed de
sirable."
This park will be an ideal one for a
camp ground. It is only a mile and
a half from the city. It is on an em
inence overlooking Santa Cruz and
Monterey Bay, with a broad sweep of
table land, which would be just the
spot for the camp and drill ground.
There are a number of canyons which
could be utilized for the target ranges,
while if a sham battle were on the
programme the grounds and vicinity
are admirable.

"Wtih this nucleus he considers his

CRAWFORD ON
MR. ISAACS
An Interesting Talk on
India and Mys
ticism.
The Novelist Says the Great
Conjurers Are Simply
Hypnotists.
Tells How a Chain of Accidents
Made Him a Nov
elist
F. Marion Crawford, the distinguished
novelist, lectured at the California last
night on "Mr. Isaacs' Newspaper Ex
periences In India," the address being
j largely autobiographical.
Though there was a great deal that
'â  dealt with the personal experiences of the
! novelist at an early period of his career,
ihe dwelt considerably on mysticism ia
i India.
At the outset of his lecture the speaker
: said: "A series of accidents, a concaten
\ atlon of small circumstances extending
' over a period of twelve years, made it
j possible for me to be here to-night. In the
first place I was educated in a detached
way abroad, and, owing to the fact that
I bought a Sanskrit grammar when I was
but 16 years of age, I got the notion of
< going to India, and it was there that I
met the original of Mr. Isaacs, who was
a Mr Jacobs. While dining with an old
uncle in New York some years after this
' he put into my head the notion of writ
ing my first book."
A large part of the lecture dealt in the
tricks of the mystics. The speaker told
of how conjurers make mango trees grow
' from seeds to a good size in a few min
i utes, of how jugglers cut boys to pieces
iin the air. and gave the details of the
i great trick whereby the juggler seems to
throw a rope into the air and disappear
: on it into the sky. He had witnessed some
of the more wonderful tricks himself and
had no doubt that the conjurers con-
I vinced reputable witnesses of all the
! other tricks claimed. The speaker ac
counted for the performance of all the
tricks by attributing them to hypnotism.
LATEST THING IN FIRES.
A Burning Coal Wagon Driven to an
Engine-House to Be Saved
From Destruction.
Pedestrians along the crowded thor
oughfares yesterday afternoon were star
tled by seeing a blazing coal wagon,
drawn by two galloping horses, dodge in
I and out among ears and wagons on a mart
race for assistance. Following the fast
moving vehicle were a lot of yelling
newsboys, who added to the excitement
by their clamor.
Turning into Kearny street, the horses
were lashed to a greater speed, while
the smoke poured from the burning coal
leaving a trail in its wake like the tail
jof a comet. Turning up Bush street, the
wagon was brought to a sudden stop be
fore the engine house. Although surprised
at having a fire brought to their doors,
the firemen Quickly attached a hose to a

Chief Sullivan and Assistant Chief Wells
! were at home when the incident occurred,
as it was due to their efforts that its con
tents were not consumed. Standing at
points of vantage both directed the play
ing of the stream into vital spots and
, soon had the Maze under control.
After the danger had been averted, the
j driver drew a few breaths of reiref and

thrown the butt end of a cigar among the
I coal and coke, setting it on tire.
SOCIETY CIRCUS
FOR THE FETE
"Olympic Day" at the Masonic
Festival Is to Be
Unique.
Ladies Are Becoming Interested A
Postoffico EoothâMeet
ings.
Howard P. Taylor Jr., leader of the
Olympic Club, visited the Masonic xemplu
yesterday and definitely arranged a plan
of action that will make Olympic day at
the festival a unique one. What he pro
poses to do he calls a "society circus."
It will include boxing, wrestling, fencing,
bareback riding with troops of horses
caparisoned in all the variety and splen
dor of colors emblematic of Masonry.
Definite arrangements are now oeing
made, so that all visitors may be enabled
to enjoy this "society circus" seated.
Grand Master Thomas Flint Jr. called
on Chairman - atton of the festival com
mittee to tell him that all Masons were
interested in the success of tho festival,
because the matter had been seriously
considered by the entire jurisdiction be
fore it was concluded to complete the
Widows' and Orphans' Home at Decoto.
The ladies of Unity Chapter, Oakland,
have planned an ice-cream booth, and
they are to have a realistic one in which
electricity will play an important part.
The ladies of Live Oak Lodge, Oakland,
will meet shortly and confer with Airs!
Frank Ogden as to the best plan uf pro
cedure to bring Live Oak Lodge, t* the
front.
One of tiie most Interesting booths will
be conducted by the daughters of L>r.
Voorsanger and Miss Aimee Cellarius. It i
is the I'ostortice boon*. It is planned to
dress all the young ladies so that a postal
effect may be secured. As many as twen
ty-four of these young ladies will go
about the fair collecting and distribut
ing letters at 25 cents each.
The committee on cash donations will !
meet at the grand secretary s oniee in
the Temple to-morrow at 3 o'clock; Lipp- i
man Sachs chairman and Edward New
hall vice-chairman. This is a very im- I
portant committee, ac it consists of such
representative men as John D. Spreckels,
Timothy Hopkins, M. H. de Young, W.
w. Montague, Charles E. Green, Colonel
Isaac Trumbo, Â±Â£d voleman, S. W. Levy,
F. W. Van Sicklen, S. W. Rosenstock
and John K. Merrill.
The ladies of Fidelity Lodge will meet
at the Temple on Thursday afternoon at
it o'clock.
A call has been issued by past masters
of the lodge, who believe that i^e wives
of Mcosons should interest themselves in
making the festival a success.
Boys Missing From Home.
George Whiting, a 10-year-old boy living
at 1765 Fifteenth street, is missing from
home, and his moLher thinks he has run
away with Roy Carrigan, a boy of 15,
with whom he was seen last. Both boys
are light complexioned, have blue eyes
and light hair. Whiting wore a black
jacket, light blue knee pants and a black
cap. Carrigan had a black coat and vest,
blue long trousers and black slouch hat.
The boys were seen last on Sunday at 4
o'clock. At that time they wore on their
way to the ferry, and it is believed they
have gone to Stockton.

THE VALENCIA CAUGHT IN A HURRICANE.
On her way from San Francisco to Prince William Sound the steamer suffered considerably. Her deck
load of horses was washed overboard and some of her upper works were damaged. The long passage was
caused by the fact that the steamer could not land her passengers on accounnt of the ice at Orca station.

Thousands of Home Cures Prove the Value of
This Grand Remedy!
DR SANDEN'S METHOD OF MAKING USE OF THE LIFE-GIVING POWER OF ELECTRICITY HAS
proven its merit. The men who say it cured them of general debility, of wasting weakness: the men who
have become strong and vigorous by following Dr. Sanden's advice, are the best evidence of the worth of his
â¢system There are thousands of them, and they speak aloud in praise of Dr. Sanden and his noble work. His
work is noble, it is grand, because It lifts men from despondency, it gives them hope, ambition, strength of
mind and body, makes them love life for the pleasure of living. No work is nobler than the good act done to
your fellow man, the act which enables him to be a good, true man.
DR. SANDEN HAS 5000 TESTIMONIALS.
He has 5000 letters from men in this State who have been reclaimed from the slow, dragging existence
caused by the loss of nervous and vital strength. He will give $1000 to any man who will prove one of these tes-
timonials false. They are from grateful menâ men" who are not afraid to let the world know that they were
once weak and are now men in the highest sense. Read this grateful letter:
"I have used your Electric Belt for loss of strength and pains In my back for one month, and It has cured me. It is a boon to
t, ,r.on T aDDreclate it because I had spent over 1100 doctoring without benefit, and I was so bad that I didn't care whether I
lived â¢ not. Your Belt 'ought to be used by every man in that condition. I will always recommend it." writes C. W. SPARL.IN.

DR. SANDEN'S BOOK, "THREE CLASSES OF MEN."
This book is full of grand truths for weak men. It tells how Electricity supplies the strength to the
weakened organs expands all the forces of the human machinery, which is only a machine anyway, and how,
by giving the body the energy to keep up a regular action of all its parts, it cures weakness and disease. This
book is very interesting. It is free, sealed, on application. Ask for it to-day. Call if possible and test the
power of Dr. Sanden's Belt free, and see whether it will not help you. * .. â ___ â _ _ .^

at rest whatever little uneasiness there
was In regard to the safety of the ship.
She took away from here over 600 pas
sengers, and all their friends and rela
tives were naturally eager to receive
some information as to the where
abouts of the ship. Taking all these
facts into consideration, Captain Lord
decided to put into the Puget Sound
port and telegraph his owners, and at
the same time renew his supply of coal
and provisions. The Valencia will reach
here Sunday night or Monday morning,
and as nearly all the passenger accom
modation on her has been secured she
will receive quick dispatch.
The building up of the barkentine
Jane A. Falkinburg bids fair to be one
of the best jobs that have been done on
the water front in many a day. The
vessel's hull, after a thorough inspec
tion, was found to- be as sound as a dol
lar, and the deck house now being put
on her will be, when completed, as solid
as the ship herself. The vessel was in
spected and passed yesterday and Cap
tain Metcalf of Lloyd's says that the
work being done on her is one of the
best jobs he has ever seen. George
Ross', the shipwright's, instructions
were: "Ross, build that vessel up so
that after she has gone to sea, no one
will be able to find fault with her." The
instructions are being carried out to the
letter. Yesterday the original main
cavil bits of the Falkinburg were cut
off at the deck, and after an examina
tion Captain Hatfield, late of the Brit
ish ship Lancing, pronounced them as
sound as the day they were put in.
When old Captain Falkinburg was hav
ing the bark built he went back East
and superintended the job himself.
Every timber that went into her he se
lected himself and the result of his se
lection is shown in the remarkable state
of preservation in which the vessel is
to- day.
In order to make a good job of the
Falkinburg's deckhouse the stanchions
have been sealed with 2V&xl2 timbers and
eyebolted through the main rail. The
construction has also been belted
through the main rail, which gives a
bearing on the original timber head,
and prevents any working between the
present construction and the original.
Passenger accommodation on the bark
entine will thus be practically in a box
and independent of the hull of the ship.
The Falkinburg is to carry about 160
gold hunters from here to Kotzebue
Sound.
L. E. Olsen, late of the steamer New
sboy. had a very narrow escape from
death last Monday night. While going
on board he missed his footing and fell
between the steamer and the wharf. In
his fall he struck a piece of scantling
and received a very severe scalp
wound. Luckily he was not rendered
unconscious and was hauled out of the
water before he received any further
injuries. He was taken to the Harbor
Receiving Hospital, where his wound 9
were dressed by Dr. Diggins.
The tug Tiger, now being eot ready
for the trade between St. Michael and
the mouth of the. Yukon, was taken pos
session of by the United States Marshal
yesterday on a claim of $232 26, pre
ferred by Michael Aamadt. The Tiger
has lately been purchased by theDepuy
Company of Chicago, but this debt was
incurred a year ago, when the tug was
at Tort Harford.
The bark Roderick Dhu is making a
long voyage from Hilo, H. I. She is
now out twenty-flve days, and left
eight days before the brig Geneva,
which arrived yesterday. The Geneva
came from Tahiti and stopped at Hilo
for a load of sugar.
The steamer Peru arrived from Hong
kong via Yokohama yesterday with
thirteen cabin and seven European,
seventy-one Japanese and 100 Chinese
steerage passengers. Everybody in the
steerage was landed at the Angel Isl
and quarantine station and the steamer
was then allowed to dock.
There was more trouble on the tramp
steamer Amarapoora while the Peru
was at Yokohama. When she left here
last year to load lumber at Puget Sound
for China it was known that she would
be libeled as soon as she reached Ta
coma. After considerable trouble Cap
tain Cameron straightened matters out
and got her away, but during the run
to China she had to put into Yokohama
in distress. The Japanese Government
would not allow her to go to sea again
until her cargo was discharged and she
â¢was thoroughly repaired. While the
Peru was on her way to Yokohama
Henry Archer, a fireman on the Amar
apoora, was arrested for assaulting
Chief Engineer P. Flannigan. Both men
joined the vessel and are staying by
her in order to get their pay. Flanni
gan reprimanded the fireman, and the
latter struck him, nearly knocking the
engineer overboard. Archer then start
ed in to run amuck, but was arrested
before he did any damage. The court
let him off with a warning.

THE COMICAL BRYANITES.
THE efforts of the Bryan Democrat* to keep
themselves in evidence are always comical and
often interesting. During the past year they
have introduced into the various State Legislatures
in which the Almighty in his inscrutable wisdom has
granted them the privilege of sittir j bills for the pur
pose of forcing the 16 to i policy down the throats
of the unhappy people whom they claim to represent.
A late measure of this character has been passed by
one branch of the Kentucky Legislature. This bill
makes contracts payable in gold illegal and declares
that Kentuckians shall at all times take gold, silver
and currency in payment of their debts on equal
terms.
Of course this is all nonsense. The State of Ken
tucky has no power to coin or emit money, nor can
it restrict the right of the people to make money con
tracts payable in gold or any other commodity. All it
can do is to show to the world that upon the subject
of finance it is utterly devoid of sense, and this one
of its Houses, at least, has succeeded in doing.
A similar attempt to control the monetary policy
of a State was made in Washington a year ago. The
Legislature of that commonwealth passed an anti
gold contract law, which enacted that all debts should
be payable in lawful money or currency without re
gard to the contract between the parties. The Bryan
ites have introduced bills of like import into the
Legislatures of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mis
souri and Tennessee, but none of them were enacted.
In Tennessee the Assembly passed the bill, in this
respect setting an example for Kentucky.
Outside of any influence which the Bryan pro
gramme has upon the reputation for sanity of a State
Legislature, it reflects heavily upon the credit of the
people. The 16 to i legislation is designed to cheat
creditors and openly flouts the National Government.
It is an attempt by the mannikins of a State to defy
the laws of Congress, and it partakes of the same
character as the nullification acts of South Carolina
which aroused the anger of Andrew Jackson.
But the Bryanites are dead, nevertheless. They
may think their blood still circulates, but they are
mistaken.
INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS.
AMENDMENTS to the sundry civil appropria
tion bill agreed upon by the Senate Commit
tee on Appropriations are in many ways fav
orable to California and afford evidence* of the ex
cellent work done by our delegation in Congress in
advancing the internal improvement of the State. If
the amendments arc adopted by the Senate and ac
cepted by the House the bill will be much more ad
vantageous to us than in its original form.
All the appropriations made for California in the
original bill are retained. The fight against San
Pedro failed in the Senate committee as it failed in
the House, and the prospects are that this long
struggle for a much needed improvement has now
oeen decisively won. There is, however, one more
chance for the monopoly to win. It has some strong
supporters and faithful servants in the Senate, and
not until the final vote on the bill has been taken can
we rejoice in the assurance of a completed victory.
There will be a good deal of gratification over the
appropriation of $250,000 for the improvement of the
rivers, to carry out the act of 1896 for the erection of
restraining dams. This amount, taken in connection
with that made by the State, gives for river improve
ment the sum of $500,000, and under judicious man
agement a vast benefit can be accomplished for the
State by its expenditure. It is of course not sufficient
to defray the cost of all the work required, but it is
reasonable to assume that the results achieved by it
will be sufficient to demonstrate the value of such im
provements and thereby incline Congress to make
further appropriations hereafter to complete the work
and keep the rivers in good order.
There are several other amendments recommended
by the committee of less note, but of considerable in
terest to the State. Among these are appropriations
for Yosemite and Sequoia parks, for repairs or im
provements on national buildings in this and other
cities, and for Hfchtships and light stations along the
coast. The bill is in every respect a more liberal
measure than that adopted by the House, and for
once at any rate the Senate has proven its usefulness
as a check on the lower branch of Congress. It has
prevented in this instance a seeming economy in the
work of internal improvement which would have
proved in the long run a wasteful and foolish policy.
Sullivan's charge that Corbett and Fitzsimmons
have done much to injure prize-fighting can hardly
be denied. Sullivan himself was the noblest exponent
of the noble art. Corbett licked him, Fitzsimmons
licked Corbett, and the world is looking for some
body to lick Fitzsimmons. It wants prize-fighting
Iniiired tome morfe _
THE COUNTRY'S DEMAND.
THERE could be no merit in an attempt to
evade the fact that the message of President
McKinley to Congress was a distinct disap
pointment to the people of this country. They had
been led to expect, not that their chief executive
would breathe the spirit of war, but that at least the
stand to be taken by him would be dignified, abso
lute, final, rather than a bid for peace. It had not
been anticipated that he would make a mere state
ment of the findings of the Maine board of inquiry
and leave to Spain to determine as to their accep
tance. That such are the present conditions friends
of the administration must, however reluctantly, ad
mit, while enemies proclaim it, and* in far away
Madrid there is rejoicing undisguised. The Dons
in their conceit believe a victory to have been won,
that their idle boasts of ability to subdue the United
States have had effect, and that their right to sneer
at the "Yankee"' is more firmly established than ever.
But it must be remembered that the President has
more at stake than any other individual. Upon his
action now must rest not alone his hopes of future
preferment, but his place in history. It is not rea
sonable to suppose that he has taken a step without
thÂ« m6st mature deliberation. It is possible he has
information yet withheld from thÂ« public, that feel
ing wax to be inevitable he desires to throw the bur
den of its declaration upon Spain, so that with the
coming of the crisis that decayed and reeking mon
archy shall not have even the moral support of any
other nation. Therefore It is ill to be hasty in pro
nouncing a verdict A day or a season may supply
the most complete vindication.
Whatever the future may bring forth, the present
feeling of discontent is natural and in no measure to
be regretted. It is an expression of patriotism. There
were insults to be resented, murder to be avenged,
and the eager citizens got a note saying the matter
had been referred to the people guilty of the insult
and the murder, that adjudication had been left to the
sense of justice and to the honor of these people. It
struck them as being a mockery, and they were un
able to pierce the veil discerning the wise statesman
ship behind. They entertain the notion that Spain
has no sense of justice; they read history and know
that Spain is without honor, that she has stained
its pages with the record of perfidy, and the record
is written in blood.
Weeks ago the Maine, laden with gallant men, was
sent by an act of treachery most dire and unprece
dented to a grave in the harbor of Havana. Certain
as was the feeling that these men had been assassi
nated, no hurried conclusions were reached. The
first impulse to smite the miscreants with all the im
placable wrath embodied in Mosaic law gave way to
calmer thought. Inquiry was begun. We were told
to wait. We have waited. The inquiry has estab
lished everything that had been suspected. It has
shown that the Maine, in port on a friendly mission,
was deliberately blown up, md that the Spanish Gov
ernment is responsible there can be no question. Still
we do not hear an unequivocal demand for such re
paration as is in the power of that Government. We
do not observe it ordered, as it deserves to be, to re
move its hateful presence from the Western Hemis
phere, where it is an affliction and a blight. We are
still told to wait. Wait until when? Wait for what?
Until Spain shall get ready to reply that the findings
of our court of inquiry were fallacious. This coun
try will submit neither to the delay nor the inevitable
impertinence with which Spain has been invited to
crown it. There is nothing to leave to arbitration,
nothing over which to quibble. Either the United
States must exact retribution, naming its own terms,
or stand disgraced among the nations of the earth.
There is no desire to possess Cuba. The wrongs of
that island would have gone unredressed and unre
strained had it not been for the crime against the
Maine. It was for this that the spirit of war swept
across the land. It was for this that Congress made a
vast appropriation and sent abroad to purchase ships
full panoplied for battle. And now that the climax
has come there is an effort to pass it over as an in
cident This the people will never abide. There are
already mutterings which must warn the adminis
tration that whatever may be its ultimate policy it
must soon be revealed. They will never be content
to have the Maine forgotten while the Spanish flag
still flies above the spot where the bones of that noble
craft lie bleaching, and in graves which do not shield
them from the gibes of the populace its seamen find
rest on a foreign shore. Whether or not Spain pay
a money indemnity matters nothing. This is not the
place of poverty. We do not think that gold is a
balm for hurts. The injury has been too monstrous
for settlement on a cash basis. It is for this that Amer
ica demands that Spain take her trumpery of con
quest, her banners and her guns and go back to the
domain where once she was glorious. Her career
on the Western Hemisphere is close to an ending.
With the point of the oppressor's sword she has
carved her own fate.
Assuredly in the matter of precedents President
McKinley need have been at no loss nor have turned
to the time of Buchanan. Monday morning was
cited in this paper a message from President Pierce
provoked by acts infinitely less outrageous than the
affair of the Maine, yet calling upon Congress to do
what lay in its power to check aggressions and prom
ising to make quick use of any authority conferred
upon the executive. As long ago as 1803 Thomas
Jefferson laid before Congress a message detailing
the depredations of a ship belonging to the Emperor
of Morocco. It was not accompanied by information
that the matter had been left to that Emperor, nor
did it intimate that his personal opinion was of
value. On the contrary it closed thus: "In the mean
time it is for Congress to consider the provisional
authorities which may be necessary to restrain the
depredations of this power should they be con
tinued."
In 1805 the same President rounded out a message
relative to the hostile acts of Spain as follows: "But
the course to be pursued will require the command
of means which it belongs to Congress exclusively
to yield or to deny. To them I communicate every
fact material for their information and the doc
uments enabling them to judge for themselves. To
their wisdom, then, I look for the course I am to
pursue, and will pursue with sincere zeal that which
they shall approve."
There are other precedents established by Jeffer
son, and still more by Madison, but there seems no
precedent for the injunction, "Wait." Yet it must
not be understood that the popular attitude is for
war. It is for honor. If this great Union made up
of States almost any one of which has material re
sources sufficient to enable it unaided to vanquish
Spain cannot present a front bold enough to intimi
date that fading monarchy into withdrawal and de
cent behavior, force her to profess contrition and be
take herself hence, then war is essential and delay can
only add to its length, its cost and its terror.
In a country where the law against murder is prop
erly enforced the slayer of Charles Gates of Oakland
would be burled in quicklime in less than thirty days.
THE SA"NT FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 1898.
THE QUARANTINE TROUBLES.
THE Federal Government, at much expense, has
established a quarantine station in this port.
It is for the facilitating of commerce and travel.
Instead of lying for weeks in the stream, as under the
old system of State quarantine, passengers can be
fumigated and landed. The cargo can be disinfected,
the ship subjected to germicides and docked for her
return voyage. It is a change thoroughly appreciated
by the mercantile and traveling community, and its
full benefits should be theirs.
The State authorities have made some attempts at
contesting the free pratique given by the Federal
authorities, but the very necessary and very positive
orders of the Secretary of the Treasury have put an
end to this. No sooner was this phase passed than
there has appeared a conflict among the Federal offi
cers themselves. A ship entering the port is first in
charge of the quarantine officer. The customs author
ities have to board her, but their authority is subordi
nate to the quarantine officer's until he gives her free
pratique, when his authority ceases entirely and the
customs officers are paramount. They must guard
the landing of passengers and under the law inspect
their baggage for articles that may be either contra
band or dutiable. They must also have charge of the
cargo and of its discharge. If the quarantine officer
assumes to land passengers and their baggage at the
same time that he orders the customs officer* detained
as prisoner* on the ship he goes beyond his authority
and interferes with customs regulations. Having no
authority himself to search the baggage of passengers
for dutiable goods, he cannot take such baggage
away from the officers who have that authority. It
will be well for the peace of this port and the dig
nity of the Government if passengers are hence
forth free from this pulling and hauling by the re
presentatives of two different divisions of Federal
authority. The/c is no sorcery about the treasury
regulations. Any ordinarily intelligent person should
be able to understand where the quarantine authority
ends and the customs authority begins, and a conflict
over so plain a thing in the presence of passengers is
inexpressibly belittling to our Government.
The health and customs officers are the first repre
sentatives of the United States met by travelers.
Their relations and conduct should impress upon
strangers the dignity and uprightness of the Govern
ment they represent
There Is no alternative for the customs authorities.
They must remain. Their functions concern the
protection of the Federal revenue. The alternative
for the quarantine officers is a return to State con
trol. Such return is against Federal policy and the
interests of commerce. It is to be hoped that no
more exhibitions of conflict will occur to make such
return seem desirable and proper.
FOREIGN PRISON-MADE GOODS.
A CORRESPONDENT of the American Econ
omist, writing from Germany, says: "From
what I have learned I am positive that a large
quantity of prison-made goods is being shipped to
the United States. There are in this empire fifty-six
full-sized prisons, many containing a thousand souls,
and a great majority have workshops where quanti
ties of cheap stuff are turned out. The authorities
do not wish this material to come into competition
with local tradespeople or dealers, as it would se
riously injure their business, and so they wink at the
export of these prison-made goods to foreign coun
tries. Consequently the export of prison-made stuff
to the United States is on the increase, greatly to the
injury of the working classes of America."
The Economist does not give the name of its cor
respondent, but vouches for his report and says "he
is accurately informed as to the facts in the case and
his statements are undoubtedly reliable." On this
showing it becomes the duty of our customs officers
to exercise more than ordinary care in the inspection
of European imports. While the report to the Econ
omist speaks of German prisons only, it is not likely
that the Germans are the sole people who unload
their prison-made goods on us as far as they can.
A close watch will have to be kept on the whole im
port trade.
The Dingley tariff provides for the exclusion from
our markets of all foreign prison-made goods of
whatever kind. The language is emphatic and clear.
It is declared that "goods, wares, articles and mer
chandise manufactured wholly or in part in any for
eign country by convict labor shall not be entitled to
entry at any of the ports of the United States, and the
importation thereof is hereby prohibited."
The opposition to the import of prison-made goods
has long been the policy of the people of the United
States and is well founded. At the present time a
bill is before Congress prohibiting the export of such
goods from one State to another and has been
strongly supported. It is an evidence of the earnest
ness of the American people in the struggle to pro
tect free labor from the competition of convicts, and
may be cited as a proof that the competition has been
felt to be injurious even within the limits of our own
country. If this is the consequence of the sale of
goods made in home prisons it is easy to see that the
import of the product of foreign prisons would be ex
tremely pernicious.
The matter is one which should be attended to by
our foreign Consuls as well as by our customs offi
cials. It can hardly be wholly guarded against at the
port of entry. There must be a watch kept at the
point of export. The Economist has done well in
directing attention to the extent to which the evil is
carried on, and it is to be hoped the Government will
at once take steps to check the practice.
Boston women have petitioned for a modification
of the ordinance forbidding high hats at the theater.
The country had looked to them for more lofty ideals
than expressed in a desire to be nuisances. No won
der the Boston woman remains unmarried. She is
something to be scared at.
It is to be regretted that the headquarters of the
Union Mission Army should have been the scene of
a fight with hatchets, and even more deeply to be
deplored that no fatal results ensued. These bogus
armies are getting too numerous, and too many of
them arc still out of jail.
To a proposal recently sent to an Eastern girl she

According to the Spanish report as to the sinking

HUGE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE
FOR THE
GREAT PARIS EXPOSITION
AMONG the "clouds," or special at
tractions, of the exposition of 1900
will be a terrestrial globe in relief,
on such a grand scale as to allow
even the minor features of outline and
topography of the various countries to
be plainly and intelligently shown to the
eye.
The idea originated with the celebrated
geographer and savant, M. Elisee Reclus,
the author of "The Earth and It 3 Inhab
itants." The plan of the structure was
worked out by M. Louis Bonnier, one of
the board of consulting engineers of the
exposition.
The globe itself will be made of sheet
metal with a diameter of 26 meters (about
100 feet), and will stand on a cylindrical
column of steel about ninety feet In
height. The whole affair will be enclosed
In an egg-shaped metallic covering as
â¢ shown in vertical section in the accom
panying cut, whose top will be 250 feet
above the ground, with two Hanking tow
ers some seventy feet higher still. Under
neath the structure and below the level
of the ground will be placed the machin
ery for operating the affair.
By means of a spiral staircase of gentle
I ascent one can pass over every degree of
latitude and longitude of the earth's sur
face and study the features thereof In
1 minute and connected detail.
The relief feature will be shown on a
! well-chosen exaggerated scale as in the
true proportion. The Himalaya Moun
tains, five miles above the sea level,
would rise on the globe but one-sixteenth
â of an inch in height. As far as possible
I everything will be given in natural col-
I ors. The icy covering of the poles, white;

when they were approached by an ac
quaintance who resides in the city and
invited to go out to his house and dine.
They were reluctant to accept the Invi
tation at first, but as he continued to
urge them, saying that there was no rea
son why they should not go with him and
enjoy a good dinner instead of dining
downtown at an expense of a couple of
dollars, they finally accepted, and the
whole party started out of the hotel. As
they passed a well-known saloon the host
suggested that tney go in and shake for
a cocktail. His proposition met with the
approval of the other two, and the trio
went inside, where they remained long
enough to shake three times, one guest
losing twice and the other once. 'At the
next bar they met a large crowd of
friends of the host just after one of the
guests had been stuck, and it cost him
$1 25 to pay for what they drank. A cigar
stand was their next stop, and it cost one
guest $1 50 for what h? lost shaking, while
the other dropped $3 40 in the machine,
winning a sufficient number of cigars to
make It unnecesr .y for the host to buy.
On the car they matched for the fare, and
again it was one of the guests who paid
the conductor.
At the house a miserable dinner awaited
them, after which the host proposed a
gam* of poker, which lasted until 3
o'clock in th*> morning, and which re
sulted in the two visitors being complete
ly cleaned out and signing notes for
amounts which ran way Into the three
figures.
The next day the two gentlemen, after
paying the-'r losses, compared notes, and
found that the Invitation had cost them
together exactly $792 45. all of which had
gone either Into the pockets or stomach
of their hospitable entertainer, whose ac
quaintance they had made on the train.
It is understood that during the rest of
Lent they will accept no courtesies. They

J. M. Edgett, who. with his wife and

location in the upper part of the main cdi- j

The site which M. Reclus selected for
this gigantic affair and for which the ap
plication has been favorably considered
by the authorities Is the tract of land im- j
mediately behind the Palace of the Troca

an elevated passage way.
Tb^^cost of the whole Is estimated at
$8001000, and while the projectors claim to
be actuated solely by a desire to promote
the interests of geographical science and
education generally, in the absence of a
grant or allowance of the money to meet
this large expense, an arrangement has
been made with a syndicate of capitalists,
who will advance the funds needed for
the completion, and look for reimburse

to visitors.
Viewed from a standpoint of utility in

BATTLE HYMN F THE POLTROON.
What is this thing we are fighting for?
Nothing- The merest of bagatelles.
We're plunging into a costly war
And shooting away our high-priced shells.
And putting to risk our fine white ships
Atid periling peaceful people's llvea
For a lot of scare crows, with food-strange,
lips,
And their famished children and starving
wives.
Why not be cautious and wait a space?
Walt. For the sake of the peaceable, wait. !
Calm and patience will settle the case, â¢
For they re dying oft at a fortunate rate.
Think of the cost of our coal alone;
Think of subsistenceâ its great expense.
Think of the stocks and the bonds we own,
And try to act with a show of sense.
Think of the danger of sword and phot;
Think of the bullets that fiercely fly.
You might be struck, as likely as not.
And. what is more dreadful, possibly I.
Heaven has shown us the path of peace.
Shown us the good that concord may bring; i
Let this threatening turbulence cease â
Let's sit down and talk over the thing.
Let us have peace. Let the starving starve:
That's the due of the helpless who fret.
Aye. let them die. : Let the Spaniard carve
Them into bits with his keen machete.
What Is the use of this fuss? What's the use
Of these wild war cries that rise and ring?
Fis'ht? Why. there isn'i â¢ show of excuse.
One more year's hunger will settle the thing. .

BENEFITS OF IRRIGATION.
Salinas Index.
The rich body of land surrounding King
j City has not been profitable for farming
purposes, owing to the lack of rain.
With sufficient rainfall the crops of this
\ section are very fine. "Water is the one
thing- neeÃful.
The Salinas Valley Water Company has
j been or&aiized to make this fertile land
"blossom as the rose." The company saw
three sources from which a supply of wa
ter could M drawn, viz.: The San Lo
i renzo Creek, the Salinas River and the
! Arroyo Seco.
The first ditch was run from the San
j Lorenzo last year, and about 300 acres of
! the King ranch was irrigated last sea
! son as an experiment. The owner states
i that the net Income of this land from
I barley was $24 65 per acre.
The company pushed its work on tne
! ditch from the Salinas River, the dimen
! sions being thirty feet wide at the bot
i torn, forty feet on top and five feet d^ep.
j It taps the river seven miles above King
City and extends to the Coburn ranch,
I four miles below the town. This ditch
will .over the land? of WMtan. Ulrey,
Walker Bros.. J. B. H. Cooper, tho King
ranch (now owned by the Spre<--kHs Su
gar Company), and Coburn. The system
embraces seventeen miles of ditches. The
land near these ditches is laid off ready
for the water that has failed to come.
This is the first time in thirty-four years
that the river has failed in its supply of
water, the rainfall in the mountains hav
ing always been much greater in other
dry years than this. The company has
bought the Arroyo Seco ranch of 7000
acres and has taken the water from the
Arroyo Seco to irrigate it. This strearc
has never failed In its supply of ffood
water. The intention Is to divide thla
land into Bmall tracts and sell it to fami
lies at $40 per acre, the company guaran
teeing a plentiful supply of water to irri
gate each acre. Seven miles of ditches
are now completed and the water is
now on the land.
As the water in thf Salinas River has
failed to flow into the ditches in suffi
cient quantities to be of much use. tha
Spreckels company decided, after inves
tigating, that there (a plenty of water
in the river bed flowing undÂ«r the sand.
With this idea uppermost, they are now
putting in a large pumping plant, ex
pecting to grow a crop of beets by irri
gation thisj-fison. For that purpose a
well 100 tm( long. 25 f^et wide and 30
feet deep Is being excavated just below
the bridge and within 60 feet of the river.
Piling, to be lined with grooved boards.
Is being driven on each side of the well
30 feet into the ground. It is hoped that
sufficient water will flow into this well
from the underground current of the
river to supply three large centrlfusral
pumps of 21.000 gallons per minute. The
pumps are to be driven by three large
engines supplied with steam by eight
boilers The entire cost of the plant will
be between $40,000 and $50,000.

shows them to contain the natural di-

the common sense plan of
digesting the food eaten promptly,
thoroughly before it has time to

This Is th< secret <>t their sue

the bowels, whereas the whole trouble
is really in the stomach.
Stuart's t pepsia Tablets, taken
after meals, digest the food. That is all

heart, losb of tlesh and appetite, and!
many other troubles which are often

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 189 S.
WANTED FOR
WIFE MURDER
Rev. George E. Morrison
Arrested in This
City.
Recognized by a Constable
From Hanford, Kings
County.
He Admits His Identity but Denies
Having Poisoned His
Wife.
A man dressed as a miner was lean-
Ing against the railing in front of a
store on Market street, near Grant ave
nue, yesterday morning, apparently
watching the passers-by, when a long
six-shooter was shoved in his face and
he was ordered to throw up his hands.
It was all done so quickly that no one's
attention was attracted to the scene.
The man with the revolver was Con
stable H. M. Bernstein of Hanford,
Kings County, and the other was Rev.
George E. Morrison, a Methodist
preacher, who Is wanted in Panhandle.
Tex., on the charge of murdering his
wife by poison.
Bernstein took his prisoner to police
headquarters and Detective Gibson
ACCUSED OF POISONING HIS WIFE.
then took charge of him and locked
him up in the "tanks" pending further
developments.
Morrison, accompanied by his wife,
went to Hanford in 1891 and through
his efforts the present church building
in Hanford was erected. He preached
there until the following year when he
was transferred to San Dieero. While
there he was guilty of conduct that
caused his expulsion by the conference
of that district. He returned to Han
furd on a visit and went to Texas.
Bernstein was a member of his con
gregation in Hanford and when circu
lars were received that Morrison was
wanted in Texas for the murder of his
wife on October 11 last Bernstein com
municated with the police there and
kept himself in touch with what was
being done.
He happened to be in the city yester
day morning on business and acci
dentally met Morrison on Market
street. He at once recognized him al
though he had grown a beard. At first
Morrison denied his identity, but con
fessed to Bernstein that he was the
man. He, however, denied that he was
guilty of the murder of his wife. He
said that some time after she died he
was taken into custody in Topeka, Kas.,
but the Texas authorities would not
send for him and he was released.
Since that time he had been to Mexico,
where he worked in the mines. He ar
rived in this city Monday night and
had only $3 in his pocket. He said he
did not want to go back to Texas.
From information received it appears
that Morrison's wife was taken sud
denly ill on the night of October 10
and died early the next morning. It
was not for a week or two that any
suspicion of foul play was heard of. but
when the police began to investigate
Morrison left Panhandle and went to
Topeka, where he shaved off his mus
tache to disguise himself. He was ar
rested there but by mistake was re
leased and he fled. Mrs. Morrison's
body was exhumed and the analysis
showed that she had died from poison.
Chief Lees wired to the police of Car
son County, Texas, notifying them of
Morrison's arrest, and he received a re
ply that an officer would leave at once
with the necessary papers for his ex
tradition. Morrison's father is a well
known clergryman in Los Angeles and
Constable Bernstein wired him of his
son's arrest. -
Rewards aggrepating $300 had been
offered for Morrison's arrest and Bern
stein will be rewarded for his clever
captiire. Morrison was known in
Texas as Ed Conley, alias Hill. He is
a man about 40 years of age.
WANTED, A PRESIDENT.
Manufacturers and Producers Hunt
ing for Mr. Kerr's Successor.
The directors of the Manufacturers and
Producers' Association are casting about
for a president for the organization, and
bo far without success. When business in
terests forced Julian Sonntag to give up
the presidency the directors Induced J.
\V. Kerr to take the chair, and he has
filled the position in the most satisfactory
manner ever since. During his incum
bency Mr. Kerr has been obliged to de
vote to the association time that he felt
should have been given to his own private
affairs, and when the time approached
for another election and some of the
â¢members asked him to take another term
he said that he could not do so and do
Justice to his business. Since then sev
rrnl have been named but none wanted to
HHsume the responsibilities of the office,
and the offer was made to none but good
business men.
A few days ago the association held its
regular election of directors and the old
board was re-elected. Yesterday the di
rectors met for the purpose of selecting
their officers for the ensuing year and
once more Mr. Kerr was forced to refuse
to take the jrtace. It was decided to leave |
the position open for a while, and the fol
lowing officers were selected: First vice
president, A. Sbarboro; second vice-presi
dent W. F. Bowers; third vice-president.
Charles R. Allen; secretary, L. R. Mead;
treasurer, A. Sbarboro. The office force
will remain the same so far as known.
NOT TO BLAME.
The Street Railway Company Exon
erated for the Death ot Mrs.
Margaret D. Price.
In the case of the death of Mrs.
Margaret D. Price of 139 Fourth street,
who died a few days ago, the Coroner's
jury yesterday returned a verdict to the
effect that the deceased came to her death
"from causes which, after due delibera
tion, the jury cannot decide upon to a
certainty but believe that deceased came
to her death by injuries received caused
by a railroad accident; and we further
iihd the railroad company blameless
Trie testimony showed that Mrs. Priceat
tempted to cross Third street at its inter
section with Everett, where there is no
crossing and that she stopped for a mo
ment to allow the driver of a truck to
halt his team to allow her to pass. The
deceased crossed in front of the team
without noticing the approach of a street
car going in the same direction as the
truck and being hidden from view by
that vehicle. She stepped directly In front
of the car, and was struck by a stanchion
on the car and knocked down, sustain
ing a broken leg and internal injuries.
RAILROAD EMPLOYES.
Young People's Societies of Christian
Endeavor Gathering In the
Market-Street Carmen.
Stewart Memorial United Presbyterian
Church, on Guerrero street, near Twenty
third, was the scene of something out of
the common in church circles last night.
This was the congregating of such of the
railroad men belonging to the Market
street line as were not on duty at a meet
ing of the Christian Endeavor Society,
gotten up for their especial benefit.
Among those present giving encourag
ing words wore the pastor of the church.
Rev. W. E. Diigan, who seemed over-
loved at the result of this, the first meet
ing of this kind held In this city: John S.
Allen, president of the .Golden Gate
branch of the society; Rohert Cleland of
the Oakland branch; Rev. R. \V. Rey
nolds of Holly I'ark Church; Rev. James
Woodward, and last, but not least, Su
perintendent Vinlng of the Market-street
Railroad, who spoke to his men words
couragement In the work undertaken
in their In-half by those present. He urged
the men to join in the work, and prom
ised to give all his moral support to
those who were about to engage in do
ing something good for the benefit of the
employes of the Market-street railway
system.
The prime mover of this undertaking Is
State Superintendent E. C Gilbert, who
has just returned from l.os Angeles,
where he succeeded in establishing a so
ciety for the benefit of the street rall
road employes of that city. He has done
similar service in Portland, Or., for the
railroad men there.
CARPENTERS WILL
AID THE PRINTERS
This Looks Like a Burying of
the Hatchet Between Cen
tral Bodies.
Musicians Have- a Little- Trouble
Concerning Â« Traveling
Orchestra.
At the meeting of Carpenters' and Join
ers' Union No. 483, on Monday, without a
voice in dissent, it was decided that the
unqualified support of that body would
be tendered the Typographical Union in
its contemplated struggle for a nine-hour
work day. This fact is more significant
than is patent on its face. There are at
present in this city two labor bodies, eavh
of which lays a claim to supremacy as the
central labor body of the city. One of
these is the San Francisco Labor Council,
the other the Building Trades Council.
While the Labor Council is affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor, the
Building Trades Council is affiliated with
no national body, yet claims supremacy
by reason nf its greater membership.
There has been no open clash between
the two organizations, but relations have
for some time been strained to a certain
extent, and this action of the largest
union of carpenters in the city is practi
cally a burying of the hatchet between
the two central bodies. Some time ago a
joint committee was appointed to bring
the two organizations together, but as yet
no arrangements have been made.
The Musicians' Protective Union has a
fight on with the Olympia . Music Hall,
which may eventually terminate in the
boycotting of that place of amusement.
The management recently put on what
Is known as a traveling orchestra. Trav
eling orchestras are privileged to play for
two months without becoming members
of the local union, but the organization
now exhibiting at that place has already
passed its two months of grace, and the.
local unionists are determined to cause
them to join the union or will boycott the
place. An amicable settlement is, how
ever, expected within a tow days.
The Abbey-Wanrell Concert.
Mrs. Alfred Abbey, soprano, and Signor
G. 8. Wanrell, bass, gave a very pleasing
operatic and song recital In Y. M. C. A.
Hall last evening:. The audience was large
and critical and the clever work of the
artists elicited much merited applause,
the work In the grand duo from the third
act of "Gli Ugonotti," and Mozart's "II
Flauto Majpico" being particularly accept
able. Mrs. Abbey was the recipient of
many handsome floral offerings during
the evening.

"PREPARE NOW
TO MEET GOD"
Father Yorke Addresses
a Large Audience at
the Cathedral.
Vivid Portrayal of the Fate
Awaiting Those Who Sin
and Fail to Repent.
Increasing Popularity of the Lenten
Theological Lectures by the Gifted
Pulpit Orator.
St. Mary's Cathedral on Van Ness ave
nue contained an immense audience last
evening, assembled to hear Father
Yorke's Lenten lecture on "Immortality."
These nightly lectures have become ex
ceedingly popular, which is due in a great
measure to the reverend gentleman's well
known oratorical abilities.
After brief devotional exercises the lec
turer ascended the pulpit and spoke sub
stantially as follows:
At the moment of death the soul is separated
from the body and passes into the future state.
The body lies btill and cold before us. The
eyes are sightless; the tars no longer hear our
words or' love; the lips have no answering
words; the hands lie motionless upon the
breast. Something has gone iorth irom the
body; that which made it live and move has
departed. We did not see it go. but it has sped
into the darkness and we are lett behind to
urn for our loved one. The clay is lett in
our care and we clothe It with tender hands;
we strew Mowers over it and when it is finally
laid away in the earth we erect a tomb above
it which we visit with heavy hearts.
But what has become of the soul? The soul
can never die', it has gone from this world,
It is true, but it lives somewhere. We would
gaze out into the darkness into which it has
taken flight, and well may we ask, my friends,
where has it gone?
Life is given to us for a purpose. Every act
we perform is dictated in order that we may
work out the mission assigned to us. We are
the servants, intrusted with our Master's
goods, and we must not abuse this trust, lor
the day will come when we shall be held to a
strict accounting for everything intrusted to
us. This will take place when the book of our
lives is closed forever. Then are our accounts
compared, and we must be ready to face that
day of reckoning, for we canot escape it.
As soon as the bonds of flesh are broken,
swifter than the eagle darting upon its prey,
6wifter than the bullet as It speeds from the
gun, swifter than the lightning's flash, yes
swifter than thought itself the soul is hurried
before its God. There is no time then to pre
pare for the meeting. The senses have van
ished and we are hurled through darkness un
til dizzy and breathless we are cast before
the great white throne. Time is now no more.
and we are brought face to face before. our ac
counts. God sits before us, no longer our ;
Savior, but as our judge. Even while the soul
is still overwhelmed with Its flight it hears {
the voice of the accusing spirit; the past is i
present, and sins that had been forgotten, sins i
denied and sins acknowledged, are brought be- j
fore it. The accusing voice recounts the warn
ings sent to the mortal on earth, special and j
general, and it tells how the Judgments of I
God have been heeded. The whole life of man
is laid bare, nothing is hidden at the great
white throne.
Oh, my friends. Illusions are now gone: ex
cuses are useless. During life there is always '
time, but that time is past. There is no hope J
of mercy now, for he has already offered mercy j
and it has been refused. Too well the soul sees i
that all is lost. The sentence has gone forth,
and the soul realizes that it must be delivered
into the power of the evil one.
This is Cod's world; he made it and we must
carry out his decrees. Some day this world
shall come to an end. The sun shall grow
cold and the moon shall cease to shed her
light. Mountains shall crumble and the hu
man race shall shrivel to naught. Then shall
we see a wondrous sight. Through the dark
ness we shall see the waves rolling over the
earth, while the stars shall fall from the skies
like autumn leaves. Then the angel of God
shall sound the trumpet and all the millions
that are dead shall live again. Not one in all
the ages shall be missing and they shall enter j
heaven and stand in their bodies as they stood
In life. -; .
Now Is the day of God. Men have had their
day, but this is God's day. ana each man shall
stand before that Judgment seat, not In spirit,
but in the very flesh and blood you have here.
Then shall the son of God send forth his an
gels to separate the good from the bad. Think
what that separation shall mean. Time Is at
an end and through all eternity must the lost
be cast forth. He will ask the righteous to
come unto him, but to the wicked he shall
say: "Depart from me thou accursedâ depart
unto hell
As surely as we are here to-night, so surely
shall we stand In that presence. Are you
ready for the meeting? Are you prepared to
render an account of your stewardship? Do
not wait, my friends, for no one knows what
a day may bring forth. Turn to God now;
prepare yourself for this meeting to-night. Do
not wait until it is too late.
THE TELEPHONE CASE.
Western Electric Company Obtains
an Injunction Against the
Capital Company.
United States Judge de TTnvon sitting in
the United States Circuit Court yester
day decided that thn W.-stern Electric
Company was entitled to an injunction
restraining the Capital Telephone .and
Telegraph Company from the use of the
l'.rrin multiple switchboard. The court
also ordered an accounting.
The switchboard used by the de
fendant was invented by Thomas J.
IVrrin and was patented in April. 1886.
The court found that Leroy 15. Firman
had reduced his invention of a multiple
switchboard to practice early in 1579 and
several months earlier than the other
patent.

DIED RATHER
THAN MARRY
David Brannan Took Poi
son on His Wedding
Night.
Was to Hove Been Forced Into
the Conjugal State Against
His Will.
Rough on Bats Gave him the De
sired Belief From the
Dilemma.
David Brannan, 21 years of age, died
last evening at the Receiving Hospital
from a dose of rough on rats, which he
had taken while at work on Washington
street, because he feared that he would
be forced into marriage with a girl whom
he had wronged.
Brannan, who had resided at Twenty
fourth and Harrison streets, was a whit -
encr by occupation and for the past few
days ha^ been employed in an unfinished
house on Washington street, between
Webster and Buchanan streets. At the
time he went to work yesterday morning
he seemed depressed and despondent and
When questioned by his fellow workmen
as 10 the cause of his troubles he stated
that he was to be married that night and
that he did not love the girl he was forced
to wed.
He claimed that the girl's parents were
forcing- the match on him and within a
few moments it was seen that he had dis
appeared. A short time afterward hlfl
fellow workmen found him writhing in
agony, and a box which had contained
rough on rats was found beside him.
The patrol wagon was called and the
suffering man removed to the hospital,
but all medical aid was of no avail and at
7 o'clock he died.
The body was removed to the
Morgue. The parents and relatives of
the young man were in the hospital at the
time of his d^ath, but they were unable
to divulge the name of the girl who had
driven Brannan to suicide.

Fill a bottle or common glass with
your water and let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment or settling indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys;
if it stains your linen it is evidence of
kidney trouble; too frequent desire to
pass it or pain in the back is also con-
vincing proof that the kidneys and
bladder are out of order.
WHAT TO DO.
There Is comfort In the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy,
fulfills every wish in relieving pain in
the back, kidneys, liver, bladder and
every part of the urinary passages. It
corrects inability to hold water and
scalding pains in passing it, or bad
effects following use of liquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to get up
many times during the night. The mild
and the extraordinary effect of Swamp-
Root is soon realized. It stands the
highest for its wonderful cures of the
most distressing cases. If you need a
medicine you should have the best. Sold
by druggists; price fifty cents and one
dollar. You may have a sample bottle
and pamphlet both sent free by mail
upon receipt of throi; two-cent stamps
to cover cost of postage on the bottle.

send your address to Dr. Kilmer & Co.,

PUT A BULLET
IN HER HEART
Effie Nottingham, a Pretty
Domestic, Deliberately
Commits Suicide.
fio Excuse for the Rash Aet-Be
lloved to Have Been
Despondent
OAKLAND, March 29.â Effie Notting
ham, a pleasant-lboklng girl I'l years of
age, ended her life to-night at the resi
dence of Captain Mom at Lake and Jack
eon streets. The girl had only parted
from her mother a few hours and seemed
to be in the best of spirits.
Soon after dinner this evening the peo
ple In the house heard a shot in the room
occupied by Miss Nottingham, who was
maid to Mrs. Mem. A moment later she
was found dead on the floor with a bullet
in her heart. The shot had been very
deliberate and death was instantaneous.
The muzzle had been pressed so dose to
the breast that a large space was burned
biack with the powder.
Kfh'e Nottingham lias been some months
with the M<-iiis. and had been told that
when they went away she should go with
They left last Monday to be gone
a month, but did not take Effle. Xester
she was paid J7, the balance of her
salary, and with the greater part of it
she purchased the l>iÂ£ American bulldog
revolver with which she ended her life.
The remainder was in her pocket when
she died.
The dead girl's mother lives on a ranch
at Walnut Creek. To-day she came Into
â¢ d to visit her daughter, and the
two passed a very pleasant couple of
hours: Mrs. Nottingham drove her
daughter back to the Mem residence and
then went home. The girl intended to
leave the Mem house to-tnorrow and look
for a place till the family returned. She
told Mis.s Rosle Glade, a domestic, that if
any mail came for her to send it to a
lodging-house ai Seventeenth street and
Telegraph avenue. sne then went up
and ended her life.
"There la absolutely no excuse for her
taking her life," said Captain of Police
Mitchell to-night. "I have known the
family for years and Effle was a lovely
girl. " A few days ago one of her girl
friends at Walnut Creek died of heart
a picnic, and Bffie felt despond
ent. She also felt bad at the family
away, :iii>l, after leaving her
ni<n lur. she decided to take her life."
Captain Mem is the well-known South
African capitalist, and his residence,
where the tragedy took place, is one of
the most elegant in the Lakeside dis
tr: t.
Councilman Henneberry Saved.
OAKLiAND, March 2l>.â The attempt to
oust Councilman Henneberry from the
i lakland Improvement t'lub to-night
ulckly squelched by the prealdeni
rulinp the question out of order. He stated
that the constitution forbade the discus
sion of religion and poatlcs at club meet
ings, and, as this way a political question,
he refused to allow it discussed. Several
attempts were made in various ways to
at th<> main question, but to no avail.
TTie attendance was very large, and an
attempt to adjourn to the call of the
chair was declared out of order. The club
will meet again next Tuesday.
RECEIVING HOSPITAL NEEDED.
The Claim Is Being Set Up That
Some Provisions Should Be Made
for Workmen at the Potrero.
The number of casualitiea which occur
at the four blp institutions at the Potrero ;
is set up by those interested as demand- :
ing the establishment of a branch receiv- i
ing hospital at that place. The Union
Iron Works employs upwards of 3000 men.
the rolling mills, the rope works and the
Sugar Refinery bave as many
more constantly employed, and all are li
able to accidents at any moment.
The accident which occurred to William
Savage in the Union Iron Works last
weÂ« k is being advanced to show the I
necessity of such an Institution, m rua
case he was permitted, through no fault
nf any'person, to lie in a sht-d for one
hour "after he received his injuries be
fore the ambulance arrived from the City
Hall to convey him to the County Hos- j
pita!, where he died.
Several cast a have recently occurred
Immediate medical attendance ad
ministered to men receiving injuries would
have eased their sutferinjss, v' not staved
their lives, before reaching the Receiving !
Hospital at the City Hall or at the County
Hospital, as the case may be.
The Potrero police station is only pro- I
vided with a wagon, which has no ac
commodation for carrying a. man who has
been badly injured. This could be sub- |
stituted for a patrol wagon, and a place;
provided f^r the treatment of those in
jured at a trifling expense.

fame, is In a new legal difficulty. "When
"Bill," who in every-day life is known as
William C Gates, entered into analllance,
offensive and defensive, with Grace la
More, after her sister Gussie bad refused
his nuggets and diamonds, he found that
she waa indebted to the California Furni
ture Company to the extent of $1043 for an
elegant lot of new furniture for her flat.
There were settees, there were otto
mans, costly couches and easy chairs, and
the heart of William was filled with Joy,
for such trifles are prohibitive luxuries on
the Klondike, and he saw photographs of
himself reposing among such cozy sur
roundings. Thereupon he called upon the
furniture company and guaranteed to pay
the amount for which his bride-to^be had
obligated herself.
Mrs. "Swiftwater Bill's" Indebtedness
was reduced by the sum of $300, but there
the payment stopped. While connubial
bliss was in progress Wiliam was willing
to pay, but when the honeymoon waned
and divorce clouds obscured the sky of
wedded life it was different, William went
behind in his payments, and then, to the
woe of the furniture company, he depart
ed for the north to look for his long-lost
relatives, who were to be made glad by
his wealth acquired in the frozen north.
Mrs. "Swiftwater Bill" stored the furni
ture at the time she retired to the seclu
elon of her sister's home, placing it in the
custody of a furniture company whose
warehouse is at 301 Stockton street.
"Swiftwater William" seemed to be the
responsible party, so the furniture com
pany waited until he could return from
the north before beginning proceedings.
"Bill" came back to his old haunts at
the Baldwin day before yesterday, and a
suit was immediately begun for the $743
that is claimed to be owing the company.
The furniture in the warehouse was at
tached, and Gates was served with a
summons to appear In the Superior Court.
Sheriff Whelan now has possession of
"Swiftwater Bill's" nuptial couch.
CONGRESSMAN JIM
WILL PLAY BALL
Will Be tho Star Attraction at
Central Park Next
Sunday.
Will Run for Congreu â GivÂ«Â« His
Opinion on the Cuban
Qusction.
James J. Corbett, future Congressman
from Harlem Flats, Harlem, New York,
once of Hayes Valley, this city, by pro
fession a pugilist but now a thesplan,
has signed with the Olympic aggregation
of players and will appear in Central
Park next Sunday as the star attraction, i
Besides being credited with being: a Rood
fighter, actor and handball player, Jim
has always aspired to win fame as a ball
player. Shortly after his go with Fitz
simmons, and while the taik of another
meeting was going on, Corbett kept in |
condition by playing ball with the big !
teams of the Nationa.l League. As first
baseman he took everything that came
along, and was favorably commented on
by the writers of the East. His work at |
the bat was of high order, and as a draw
ing card he was immense.
Corbett received a telegram from a well
known Eastern paper yesterday asking
what stand he would take on the Cuban |
question if elected to Congress, and also |
his opinion on McKinley's latest move. I
To tnia request Corbett replied: "If !
elected, will advocate all measures de- |
signed to free Cuba and speedily relieve j
the sufferings of her people. Think Presi- j
dent McKinley altogether too conserva- i
tive. I favor prompt and aggressive action i
â under tho present existing circum
etances."
Another telegram asking what truth
there was in the story of his having Con
gressional aspirations elicited the follow
ing reply: "Keport true. Have received
letters from my friends in Harlem Dis
trict asking if I would accept the nomina
tion for Congress next fall. Have written,
would accept same and will if nominated
make a personal canvass, and feel con
fident that if elected my friends will never
have cause to regret in having honored
me with the high office."
When asked what party he advocated
and his reason for doing so Jim answered
that he was a Democrat because his
father was. Returning to the Cuban
question, he said if elected to Congress
his duties might not permit him to enlist
as a soldier in the event of war, but he
would send a substitute. Jim thinks that
steps should be Immediately ta.ken to pre
vent the Spanish flotilla coming within
striking distance of this country.
The ringing up of the curtain cut
further conversation short, as with a
hitch of his trousers the "Naval Cadet"
took his position on the quarterdeck.

LOOTING OF A
SCHOOLHOUSE
Plumbing of the Winfleld
Scott Wrecked by
Vandals.
Damage to the Amount of
Several Hundred Dollars
Done.
Police Have Been Notified and Are
on the Lookout for the
Marauders.
The "Wlnfleld Scott School at Lombard
and Baker streets was looted by thieves
on Thursday evening last, and it will
cost the School Department several
hundred dollars to repair the damage
done.
The fact that the schoolhouse had
been visited by vandals was not known
until the next morning, when a report
was rendered to the office of the Board
of Education. It was evident that the
work was done between the time school
let out on Thursday and the time the
scholars arrived on Friday.
The thieves were evidently after Junk,
for not a particle of lead pipe or other
salable metal was left about the build
ing. Beneath all the wash basins the
pipes were torn away and every pound
of lead in the building was carried off.
Even the connections were unscrewed
and made way with. Outside of break
ing open a few desks, from which noth
ing of value was obtained, the thieves
carried their operations no further.
Inspector of Buildings O'Brien was
notified of the loot of the schoolhouse
and at once gave orders that new pipes
be substituted for the stolen ones. He
had iron pipes put In, however, to pre
vent a repetition of the robbery.
The lead that was stolen could not
be sold for over $5, but it will cost the
department fully $200 to repair the
damage. The police have been noti
fied of the robbery and it is believed
that the perpetrators will be in custody
within a short time, suspicion pointing
to a couple of hard characters in the
neighborhood who were seen prowling
about the school and who are known
to be capable of a Job of this kind.
HANDBALL PLAYERS DEPART.
Casey Plays His Last Game and Is
Presented With a Gold-
Headed Cane.
Phil Casey, the aged but agile handball
exponent, left for Denver yesterday, bear
ing with him a handsome g-old-heaaed
cane and the best wishes of the many
hundred friends he has made since hla
sojourn here. He will go direct to Den
ver, where he w.U meet ex-Alderman
Dunne, his partner in many a hard-fought
rubber, who preceded him a few days
ago.
Yesterday the popular retired champion
of the world, with ex-Assessor J. C.
Nealon as a partner, played License Col
lector Theodore F. Bonnet and es-cham
plon John Riordan one of the hardest
rubbers that has been witnessed In many
years at Phil Ryan's court. Casey played
as he did in the days he won his title,
covering the court with an agility mat
was astounding in one so oia. Bonnet
and Riordan were in their element, and
gave their oponents a merry tight ior
supremacy.
Casey and ...ealon landed the first game
by a narrow margin, while the second
went to Bonnet and Riordan. The play
ers then redoubled their efforts, and the
large crowd veiled Itself hoarse at tiie
brilliant work.
Bonnet, by clever serving, ran the score
up to 5, and Riordan added a few more
points. After long rallies an-, clever
placing, Uie game went to Bonnet and
Riordan. Their victory was short lived,
however, for the New Yorker, by unerr
ing placing and a hard service, gained
many points before being retired. Bon
net's side again forged to the front, and
the score stood about even. By a series
of hard smashes Casey ran out, leaving
the score 21 to 19. As Mr. Casey had to
make preparations ior his departure, the
deciding game was not piayed.
At the conclusion of the match Mr.
Nealon, In a neat speech, presented the
visitor with a beautiful gold-heade^ cane
as a token of his regard and a memento of
his visit to this city. Mr. Casey was
greatly surprised, and feelingly thanked
his friend for his generosity, stating that
he would look .forward to his next visit
to the coast with pleasure. In behalf of
Mr. Dunne he also thanked Mr. Nealon
for the gift.
DEATH DEFIED
THE COURT
The Grim Reaper Intervenes in
a Suit for Habeas
Corpus.
Mrs. Cercghlno'* Child Held as a
Chattel for a Debt by Ita
Grandmother.
Mrs. Elizabeth Cereghlno yesterday,
through her attorney, Eugene Bert, sued
for a writ of habeas corpus for the re
covery of her child, which she claimed
waa being held by her mother-in-law,
Mrs. M. Cereghlno, at 14 Hinckley street.
The writ was made returnable in Judge
Cook's court at 10 o'clock to-day, and the
papers were given to the Sheriff for ser
vice. About an hour afterward the Sher
iff reported to the court that the child
was dead.
Mrs. CeregWno, with her husband and
child, had been living with her mother
in-law for over a year and a few weeks
ago her husband left her and went to the
Klondike. When he went away he was
In arrears for board for himself and fam
ily to his mother and when he had gone
a family dispute arose over the bill.
About three weeks ago Mrs. Cerejrhino
went to live with her brother, leaving her
child with Its grandmother. Last Thurs
day tha child was taken 111 with pneu
monia and on Friday the mother called
to take It to her home. The grandmother
refused to let her have it in the condition
It was in or until the debt was paid, and
another dispute arose. .Yesterday the
mother appealed to the court for the cus
tody of the child, but death had taken it
beyond the reach of the power of the
Judge. The mother, even in her bitter
ness against her mother-in-law, says she
can find no fault with the care and at
tention given the child. A physician was
In constant attendance during Its Illness
and everything possible was done for It.
She said she thought it best to keep away
from her mother-in-law and let the court
recover her child for her, but death took
the child away while she was making her
appeal to the law.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 1898.
WILL HOLD UP
THE DAIRYMEN
A New Crusade Against
Impure Milk Has
Been Begun.
The Board of Health Has
Warned the Dealers of
Its Intentions.
Milk Will Be Dumped Into thÂ« Gutter
When Found to Bo Below
Standard.
The most rigid crusade that has yet
been begun by the Health Department
against impure milk will be inaugurat
ed within the next few days. In times
past when Impure milk has been found
in the carts of the dairymen the owners
of the ranches have frequently made
the claim that their drivers were re
sponsible for the quality of the fluid,
and the department has felt loath to
arbitrarily fix the responsibility. With
in the past few days Health Inspectors
have been quietly holding up carts in
all parts of the city and taking samples
to be examined at leisure.
In more than fifty cases the milk has
been found to be below the standard,
and a careful record has been kept of
the dairies whence it came. In
each instance the owner has been
served with a notice that his milk is
below standard and that unless a
change is made In the quality of his
wares prosecution and the dumping of
his milk will follow.
The Health Department believes that
this should be sufficient warning and
that no mistake can be made should
impure milk be sent out by the dairy
men. During the rest of this week
wagons will be stopped on all of the
avenues through which they reach this
city, and every can of milk that is not
up to the standard adopted by the
board will be poured into the gutter.
Chief Food and Milk Inspector Dock
ery. who has had several years' experi
ence watching the dairymen, believes
that the amount of impure milk
brought into this city has been on the
increase since the inspection stations
were abolished, and that the only rem
edy is a rigid crusade that will stop the
saie of milk that is below the standard.
HOFF TOLD
OF HIMSELF
Lengthy Testimony Given in
an Endeavor to Prove
an Alibi.
At Some Points of the Session Dra
matic Situations Arose and the
Lobby Was Pleased.
Albert Holt was the attraction In the
case against himself yesterday In Jucipe
Carroll Cook's court. For hour after hour
he testified as to his whereabouts at the
time of and prior to the murder of Mrs.
Clute. A rather dramatic scene was pre
sented to the breathless listeners when
Attorney Schooler took the stand and
asked the defendant to show the court
and jury how Detective Seymour had ob
tained certain evidence after his arrest.
As the attorney took the stand the ac
cused murderer raised the bloody wea
pon above his counsel's head and said,
"the officer stated that there were not
enough Germans in the country to save
me, and I might as well tell the truth, as
the rope had already been prepared which
would take my life away." The testimony
seemed to carry some weight for a mo
ment, but questions soon led the witness
into other channels and the incident was
forgotten. The witness went over his
story, as previously told, of how he had
done certain work for Mrs. Clute at her
request and that he also assisted the de
ceased in packing her household effects
prior to her Intended departure. "I left
by the back way," he said, and from his
testimony the â¢murdered woman was
standing on the front porch at the time of
his departure. The witness, while testi
fying in his own behalf also gave testi
mony regarding the explanation he had
given to the detectives concerning the cut
on his hand. As has been previously tes
tified to, he repeated that the slight
wound was received from a tack while re
moving matting from the floor.
At the last moment Hoff strenuously
denied that he had taken the life of Mrs.
Clute and his vehemence was such that
the lobby broke out in applause, but their
demonstrations were quickly quelled by
the court, followed by a threat that any
more disturbance would be followed by
confinement in the City Prison. The Judge
Intimated that the case was not a farce,
but a murder trial, and consequently or
der must be maintained.
The husband of the murdered woman,
E. R. Clute, was first called to testify as
to the financial condition of his wife at
the time of the murder, but the testimony
was shut out by an objection from the
prosecution, but the witness testified that
he had never seen the accused prior to
the commission of the act for which he
was on trial for his life. William Dierks,
Thomas Hannon, William Mohrmann, and
Mrs. Ida Hollls testified as to the excite
ment of Hoff when he was notified that
the facts of the murder had been pub
lished. Charles Brandt stated that Hoff
had called at his place of business for a
drink on the fatal evening, but that he
had been refused, as It seemed he was in
an intoxicated condition at the time. Lena
Lunden, a school girl, testified that she
had seen Hoff between S and 4 o'clock on
a Valencia street car going south and
that he had waved his hand to her. She
returned the salutation.
Augustus Silverberg and Milton Silver
berg testified that the defendant had
worked in the house, but that although
they had seen the carpet sack in which he
had carried his tools they had not seen
the coupllnjj pin, but on cross-examina
tion they stated that they were not posi
tive but that the pin may have been in
the tool bag. The case will go on again
to-day.

A COUNTRYMAN
SHANGHAIED
Jack Cole, a Farmer of
Madera, Escapes From
a Whaler.
Claims to Have Been Taken
Aboard When Drunk and
Drugged.
LbÃt All His Money and Clothes and
Now Awaits Advice* From HiÂ«
Friends.
Jack Cole, hailing from Madera, claims
that he was shanghaied aboard the
whaler Alexander while partially drunk
and drugged, and that he escaped from
her by swimming ashore at 2 a. m. Tues
day.
According to Cole's statement, he came
up from Madera a day or two ago with
$127 in his pocket for the purpose of hav
ing a good time. He had only a casual
acquaintance in the city, and when he
landed here he allowed himself to be per
suaded to accompany a smooth-spoken
hotel runner to a hostelry on Jackson
street, of which he appears to have but a
hazy knowledge. No sooner had the run
ner made his acquaintance than he ap
parently recognized in Cole a good thing
and determined to work it for all it was
worth. The runner began by Inviting
Cole to take a drink of water-front
whisky, and after two or three rounds
Cole's recollection of what occurred is
quite befogged.
The runner stuck to Cole, who spent his
money liberally and recklessly. Mon
day morning they renewed their libations,
and It must have been that Cole's money
was about exhausted and that the runner
made up his mind it would be a good Idea
to get rid of him and make an additional
raise at the same time. Cole says he has
a very hazy recollection of being taken to
a shipping office, he thinks at Battery and
Jackson streets, where he remembers
signing an advance check for $50 and also
shipping papers for a cruise on a whaler.
The advance money he did not get, and
supposes it went to the runner who took
him there. He was taken at once on
board the whaler, which was lying in the
stream, where he soon fell into a deep ,
sleep. It was well along in the evening j
when he awoke and for the first time
realized where he was. A few questions j
of the other members of the crew showed j
the predicament he was In.
Coie knew no more about a ship an- a I
sailor's duties than he did about the i
nebular hypothesis, and at once made up J
hia mind that he would get ashore in
some way. His head was still buzzing |
from the effects of the liquor and drugs
which he believed he had taken, but his
mind was set on getting ashore, and find
ing that there was no other way, he de
cided to make a swim for it. His com
panions tried to dissuade vim, saying that
he would surely urown; but he was de
cided. He thought he might better drown
than go on a whaling voyage. About 'I
o'clock a. m., when all hands were sup
posed to be asleep, he took off his outer
clothes and, with only his underclothing
on, let himself down by the chains at the
bow of the vessel and started for shore.
He says he thinks he was all of an hour
In the water, which was bitterly cold, and
must have swum two or three miles, but
he was determined to get ashore, and
finally landed at one of the wharves â
which one he does not know, but thinks
it was the Jackson-street.
Once on shore, a watchman gave him a
pair of overalls, and he warmed himself
in a saloon. When daylight came he
hunted up an acquaintance, who gave him
some old clothes, and then he started out
to communicate with his people at Ma
dera. He expects to hear from them to
morrow, when he will lose no time in
getting back to his home' aa rapidly as
possible.
The parties who shipped Colo pretended
to furnish him with an outfit for the
cruise, but when he examined the bag
after coming to himself on the whaler
he found that it only contained a dirty
old quilt, an old oilskin suit, a second
hand pair of boots and a plug of tobacco.
ATHLETIC CLUBS
BIDDING HIGH
Jeffries and Sharkey Are Of
fered Tempting Induce
ments to Fight.
The National Club Raised the Bid
of the Olympics Tan Per
Cent
The Olympic and National athletic
clubs are trying to bring about a twenty
round contest between Tom Sharkey and
Jim Jeffries.
The Olympic Club has offered the pugi
lists 60 per cent of the receipts, but the
National has raised the Olympic's bid 10
ppr cent, and may possibly capture the
plum.
Sharkey spoke very strongly a few days
ago against fighting again in this city,
but when his nearest friends informed
him of the fact that he will receive as
good If not better treatment here than
will be accorded him In the East, where
boxing Is tolerated by the authorities,
Thomas has altered his Intention of going
to New York for the purpose of meeting
Peter Maher, the Irish champion.
The managers of the National Club
have been on Sharkey's trail ever since
Jeffries disposed of JacKSon, but no man
ner of coaxing will, seemingly, induce the
sailor lad to give an affirmative or a
negative reply to the question, "Will you
fight Jeffries in our club for 70 per cent
of the receipts?"
Doubtless, Sharkey will finally consent
to light Jeffries in this city, but under
which club the contest will be held Is at
present a matter of conjecture.
Jeffries favors the Olympic Club, but
his astute manager, Billy Delaney, will
hardly consent to an agreement of any
kind unless the monetary consideration
Is to his fancy. The Olympics will cer
tainly have to make as good an offer as
the Nationals If they hope to capture the
big drawing card. Whichever club brings
off the match, it can be safely said that
it will lose money If It attempts to bring
It off at Woodward's Pavilion, which is
a very unsafe place for first-class boxing
entertainments, that Invariably attract
large gatherings of fistic sport lovers.
The Excelsior Athletic Club will as
suredly have a crowded gymnasium this
evening, as its programme of indoor sport
ia first-class. It is as follows: Three
round bouts between Jack Stenzler and
Joe Kennedy, Jimmy Lawlor and Jimmy
Riley. Jimmy Anthony and Frank Skuse,
J. McGrath and W. Otts. T. Devlne and
J. Mcl>evitt, J. Dougherty and W. Has
kins. W. Hogan and W. Lawlor, Jack
Sullivan and Joe Sullivan.
As a grand final to the preliminary
bouts, P. Lynch, the hard-hitting repre
sentative of the San Francisco Athletic
Club, will meet M. MctJormick of the
Oakland Athletic Club In an eight-round
contest for the middle-weight amateur
championship of the coast. Orator James
H. Kennedy will Introduce the contest
ants In his usual pleasant and unosten
tatious way. The first event will be
called snarply at 8 o'clock.
The inaugural athletic entertainment
and ball of the Yosemlte Athletic Club
will be held this evening In Odd Fellows'
Hall, Seventh and ..iarket streets.

Developments at the Inquest on
the Body of Lieutenant
Burke.
George Csehsl, the Brave Patrol
Driver, Tells the Story of a Brutal
Murder and. Foul Cowardice.
Coroner Hawkins held an Inquest
yesterday on the body of Police Lieu
tenant William F. Burke, who was
murdered last Wednesday by Theo
dore Park Haynes while resisting ar
rest for an assault with intent to mur
der a neighbor.
Haynes was present with his attor
neys, J. N. E. Wilson and Edward
Sweeney. He listened intently to the
testimony with a grim and determined
expression of countenance. When asked
by the Coroner whether he wished to
testify on his own behalf he replied
that he did, but was kept In his seat
by Attorney Wilson. At the conclusion
of the testimony Haynes said that he
had some objections to make to the
proceedings, but he was again silenced
by his lawyers.
Only two witnesses were examined,
Policeman T. W. Marlowe, who ran
away when Haynes shot his lieutenant,
and the brave patrol driver, George
Cashel, who risked his life to take the
bleeding form of the mortally wounded
officer out of the range of the mur
derer's bullets. Marlowe gave his testi
mony with a More-sco tragedian air and
a stentorian voice worth at least $20 a
week on the boards of that popular re
sort. He told how gallantly he had fired
off the five chambers of his trusty re
volver and how he had sauntered away
at a lively gait after more ammunition,
it appearing to be the practice of the
San Francisco police to carry no more
ammunition than their pistols will hold.
The testimony of George Cashel, the
patrol driver, was to the effect that as
he sat on the wagon watching Lieuten
ant Burke and Officers Marlowe and
Wilkinson approaching the prisoner,
who held a loaded revolver in each
hand, he saw Haynes fire on the de
ceased and saw the deceased fall. At
the same moment the officers brake for
cover and began firing at Haynes. Just
after Haynes fired the first shot at
Burke Marlowe ran down the hill at
full speed firing his revolver as he ran.
Cashel called upon the officers to help
him take the deceased away from the
place where he was lying in front of
Haynes' house, but nobody came for
ward to help him, and he went alone.
Then Marlowe made his apVearance
near the house, waved his revolver in
the air and shouted: "Come on, I have
! the door covered, and If he comes out
I will kill him."
Detective Cody exhibited the pistols
used by the murderer. The handle of
the revolver belonging to the deceased
was broken and there were three marks
i on the cylinder In front of the hammer,
' showing that it had been broken with a
I hatchet or some similar tool and not by
a bullet, as was at first supposed.
The jury returned a verdict that the
j deceased came to his death from a gun
i shot wound inflicted by the prisoner.
COAKLEY IS NOW MISSING.
The Most Important Witness Against
Dr. Hall Cannot Be Found.
The second trial of Dr. Samuel H. Hall,
accused of having caused the death of
Mrs. Ida Coakley through a criminal
operation, was resumed yesterday before
Judge Dunne. The five remaining Jurors
required to complete the jury were se
cured yesterday morning, and a recess
was then taken.
When court reconvened in the after
noon John Coakley, the husband of the
dead woman, was announced to he miss
ing. Coakley was indicted with Hall, and
on the first trial the charge of murder
pending against him was dismissed In or
der that he might testify against Hall.
The story told by Coakley was directly
against Hall, and laid the death of Mrs.
Coakley at Hall's door.
The police and deputies from the
Sheriff's office have used every endeavor
to locate him, and it is now believed that
he has fled from the State. Under the cir
cumstances there is but little expectancy
of securing a conviction.

I* ilj terrible thing about
,; - â¢ this condition of af-
feirs is that it is entirely needless. There is
no reason in the world why every woman
in the world should not be strong and health-
ful and capable of fulfilling her whole duty
as a wife and mother. Many women go on
month after month, and year after year, be-
coming weaker and weaker, because of a
very natural hesitancy they feel in consult-
ing a physician. They know that if they go
to a doctor for treatment, the first thing he
will insist on will be "examination", and
"local treatment." This must of course be
distasteful to every modest woman. They
are generally as unnecessary as they are ab-
horrent. Dr. Pierce s Favoritt Prescription
cures positively, perfectly, permanently, all
varieties of "female weakness" and dis-
ease. It is designed to do this one thing,
and it does it. It is the only medicine now
before the public for woman's peculiar ail-

by a regularly graduated physicianâ an ex-
perienced and : skilled - specialist . in these
maladies. It cannot do harm in any condi- \
tion of the system. Its sales exceed the

bad pains in my stomach any more, which I had, with dyspepsia and
constipation, for years â in fact, up to about three days after I began
taking the Tabules. There used to be some kinds of food my stomach
would sicken on â pork, for instance. I could not eat it without having

food, that used to make me sick to think of. I always have & few of

HEAD BY A
RIVAL SUITOR
Ed E. Halsey of South Ber=
keley Killed by Stacey
Rogers of Lorin.
The Murderer Afterward Surren
ders Himself at Golden Gate.
Berkeley's First Homicide.
BERKELEY. March 29.â Ed E. Hal- |
Â«ey, a young carpenter of South Berke
ley, was shot and almost instantly
killed th.s evening by Stacey Rogers, a
sign panter of Lorin. at the residence .
of Charles D. Haines, corner of Prince !
and Fulton streets, South Berkeley.
Halsey and Rogers had quarreled early
in the day, and this evening when Rog
er* called at Haines' house Halsey |
Btarted to throw him from the porch |
down stairs. Rogers drew a revolver
and shot Halsey, the ball penetrating
the breast and piercing the aorta. Hal
sey staggered back from the porch to i
one of the rear rooms of the house,
where he died in less than five minutes |
after receiving the fatal wound. Dr. i
Allen of Ashby avenue, who had been
Immediately summoned, arrived after
the man breathed his last.
Jealousy over a woman, Mrs. Eva
Fenton Harrison, who is employed in j
the household of Haines, seems to have
been at the bottom of the trouble be- â¢
tween Halsey and Rogers. Halsey was
a frequent caller at the Haines resi
dence, whither he came to see Mrs. |
Harrison, or Miss Fenton, as she is i
known in the neighborhood. He also j
came to see Haines, with whom he
often had business. Halsey being a car
penter and builder and Haines being a
painter. Halsey was on terms of close
friendship with Mrs. Harrison, with
whom he had been acquainted as Miss
Fenton, before she married Harrison, j
He resided with his sister, Mrs. Robert
Hunter, on Ashby avenue, below Grove i
street.
This evening he called at the Haines
residence and was sitting in a room in
the rear of the house when Rogers |
came to the front door and inquired for
Mr. Haines. Halsey heard him and !
recognized the voice as that of Rogers,
when he had warned to stay away
from the Haines home under penalty of
being thrashed. Halsey hastened to the
front door and out on to the front I
porch, where, according to the state
ment of Haines, who was standing by,
he grappled with Rogers and attempted
to force him down the stairs. Rogers j
drew a revolver and fired point blank
at Halscy's breast. He then hurriedly
fled with a companion who stood on the i
sidewalk waiting for him.
Halsey, immediately after being shot, j
staggered back into the house. When i
hÂ« reached the sitting room he fell and
died almost immediately in the pres
ence of Haines, who stood powerless to
help him.
Deputy Coroner Streightif and Mar
shal Lloyd of Berkeley were quickly
notified. The former made arran^- |
ments to have the body removed to the
Berkeley Branch MorguÂ». The Marshal
started out after Rodgers.
Halsey had been in Berkeley for some
Alme and had recently opened a carpen
ler shop on Ashby avenue. He seems
to have borne the reputation of being
a sober and industrious workman. His
sister. Mrs. Rcbert Hunter, with whom j
he resided, was nearly prostrated when |
she heard of his tragic death. She de
clared that the shock would kill the
aged mother of the deceased, who lives
in New York.
Stacey Rogers, the murderer, is
hardly 22 years of age and does not
bear the best of reputations in his ;
neighborhood.
While a sign painter by trade he Is
paid to have spent a large part of his
time in the company of a gang of Lorin
hoodlums. He and Halsey have fre
quently quarreled and Halsey had
threatened to thrash him if he came
near the Haines house, where Mrs. Har
rison was staying. Haines believes
that Rogers came to the house this
evening for the purpose of bothering
Halsey, and that when Halsey started
for him he believed he would thrash
him, and accordingly pulled a gun on
Halsey.
Mrs. Harrison was rendered hysteri
cal as a result of the tragic death of
Halsey and could give no statement in
regard with her relations with Halsey
or with her husband, M. Harrison, from
whom she has been separated for some j
time and of whose whereabouts noth
ing Is known. Mrs. Harrison is a
rather prepossessing young blonde and
Is well known in South Berkeley, where
she has i*sided for a number of years.
At 10 o'clock to-night Stacey Rogers
surrendered himself to Officer Jack
Sherry at Golden Gate, and an hour
later he was In the Oakland City
Prison. He was very nervous and ex
citable, and at once sent for his broth-
I er, Leo Rogers, who 13 employed at
Taylor's lumber yard in Berkeley. He
is a very respectable looking young
fellow and gives his age as Just 21.
Rogers required but little persuasion
to tell his story of the trouble which
originated over a young married
woman.
"For some time past," said Rogers,
"there has been some feeling of jeal
ousy between Halsey and myself over i
Mrs. Eva Harrison. We never had any i
open quarrel, but I knew he did not \
like my calling at the house of Mr. and j
Mrs. Haines, where Mrs. Harrison â¢
stays. This afternoon we met and had j
a few words. Halsey said I was not j
wanted at the Haines house, and th;it
he would see that I kept away. He said
If he could not do it one way he wouil
another. I knew what this meant, be- j
cause I have heard that once he used a
knife when in a scrape. I told him I
would go to see Mrs. Harrison if I
chose, and he defied me.
"He told me he was going to the
house to-night and I decided to ro
there too. When I met Mr. Haines, |
who opened the door, I asked him if
he wanted me to keep away from the
house. He said he did and just then I
saw Halsey come out of a door at the j
head of the stairs. I looked at him and j
paw that he had his hand raised,
fancied I saw something shining in It ;
nnd knowing what he had said this ;
afternoon about doing me up I drew
my gun and fired. I remember seeing
the flash and seeing him fall and then j
I ran off. I wandered around for about j
an hour and then I was cooled off and j
decided to give myself up. I met Of- j
fleer Sherry, told him of what I had j
done, and he brought me here.
"I am a newspaper man and three :
weeks ago was doing some work for
the Stockton Independent. I have also {
worked for the Illustrated World. I j
have mostly done canvassing. I hav^
no relatives on the coast except my
brother. - I met Mrs. Harrison before j
she was married. She did not live with j
her husband long and they have been
separated for some time. I should j
not have gone tn the Haines house to
night solely on my own account, but I
have a friend named Charley MeGreer
who was anxious to meet Mrs. Harri
son. He knew I was acquainted with
her and he asked me to arrange a
meeting between them. I went there
to-night for that purpose.
"Halsey is a married man, but does
not live with his wife. He had trou
ble with her and ran off to Mexico till
it blew over. I have known him for
a long time, but we never quarreled
till to-day. I never met his wife and
do not know where she is. Halsey
has on no occasion told me to keep
away from his wife.
"I consider that I did the shooting
in self-defense, because I really be
lieved that Halsey had a gun in his
j hand when he raised it. I have never
â  been in trouble in my life before, and
! although I was prepared to defend my
! self if need be, I did not go to the
Haines house with any intention of
shooting. I am sorry I have killed
my friend, and very sorry that I have
been forced to bring a lady's name into
this unpleasant affair."
The killing of Halsey is the first
murder that has occurred in Berkeley
since the branch morgue was estab
lished there about six yean ago. A
Berkeleyan who has resided in the col
lege town for twenty years declares
that it is the first case of homicide that
has occurred in the history of the town.

men trotted, galloped, walked, loped,

devotee of outdoor sport, who rides like a
female centaur and who really enjoys a
pastime, that . requires a courage and
knowledge of technique that few women
possess. , â¢
"Musieek!" again shouted the peculiar
looking individual from La Belle France,
who, attired in a pair of pajamas and a
coat much too large for him, led the pro

thing that sounded like a tarantella from
Meussdorffer, while the horses â¢ in thÂ«
ring, under the skillful guidance of their
riders, turned this way and that, form-
Ing innumerable figures and different
groupings while keeping almost perfect
time to the rhythmic cadence of the
music. ,_ \,

ful animals, their - well-groomed coats
shining like satin, obeying each touch of

BIGGY TO MAKE CHANGES.
The New Registrar Wants All Elec
tion Officers Chosen by Lot.
Registrar Biggy, who has already taken
possession of his office, has decided to
make several changes in the personnel of
his staff, and at least five men will be
relieved and others placed in their posi
tions. The names of those who will be
superseded by men of Mr. Biggy's selec
tion have not yet been given out. At
least two of them will be put on special
work for some time to come. Mr. Biggy
has taken hold of the work of his office
with a will, and has already decided that
registration for the charter" election shall
begin April 26. Slips designating the poll
ing places will be mailed to voters as Cast
as the corps of clerks can get them cm.
The new Registrar is in favor of drawing
the names of election clerks by lot from
among the 4000 names that have been sent.
Into the office by the various political
parties. It is probable that he will adopt
this course.

THE SAl* FRANCISCO CAkli, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 1898.
STREET CARS IN COLLISION.
A northbound electric car on the Fillmore street line collided with
an inbound Hayes-street cable car at Hayes and Fillmore streets early
last night. Several passengers were Injured by the broken panes of
glass, but none of them seriously. One old lady, living at 610 Mission
street, suffered considerably from the shock, and the officials of the
road sent her home in a carriage. The blame for the accident is laid to
the gripman of the Hayes-street car. The electric car line has the right
of way and it was the duty of the gripman of the cable road to stop
before reaching the crossing and make sure that the line was clear be
fore attempting to cross the tracks of the electric road. He failed
to do, and his car was squarely on the tracks of the Fillmore line
when the electric car came down the steep grade, and before the mo
torman could get his brakes set the wreck was complete. The side
of the cable car was smashed In and the front of the Fillmore-street
car was badly damaged. The forward truck of the cable car was dis
abled and the grip refused to work. The damaged car was pushed
down Hayes street with the intention of taking it to the turn table at
the foot of Market street and on back to the power house. The dam
aged car went all right on the straight track on Hayes street, but
when It struck the curve at Market street the wheel of the damaged
truck left the track, and It went bouncing over the cobbles toward the
curb An effort was luade to put it back on the tracks, but the car
was too badly damaged to insure It running as far as the turn table,
and as a matter of expediency it was run clear of the tracks and left
until traffic had stopped, when a wrecking gang placed new trucks un
der it and hauled it to the car house.
REORGANIZATION
OF A CORPORATION
Tangled Affairs of the Oregon
Improvement Com
pany.
Eastern Capitalists Took Charge o!
trio Business on This
Coast.
The tangled affairs of the Oregon Im
provement Company, which got into a
bad way some years ago through mis
management and unfortunate invest
ments, was straightened up by means of
a number of deeds that were filed in the
Recorder's office yesterday.
The reorganization of the company,
which had been in the hands of a re
ceiver, was made possible by the deed
ing by Special Commissioner Eben Smith
to John I. Waterbury and T. Jefferson
Coolidge Jr. of the immense Interests or
the concern. These gentlemen represent
the Pacific Coast Company, a concern
made up of Eastern capitalists, whose
aggregate wealth amounts to many mil
lions. The Farmer's Trust Company also
filed quitclaim deeds releasing the old
concern from its obligations.
The property transferred consists or
vast mining: and shipping interests and
also the coal bunkers and the land on
which they stand in this city. The new
company "will entirely reorganize the
concern and endeavor to place it on a
paying basis.
EXCELLENT BASKET-BALL.
Second Game in the Finals of the Big
Tournament.
The second game in the finals of the
basket bail tournament was played last
Thursday evening at the gymnasium of
the Y. M. C. A. of this city, when the
Business Men of San Francisco defeated
the Athens of Oakland in a very lively
contest by the close score of 12 to 10
points.
Both teams entered the gymnasium
with a determination to win the honors
of the day and the golden trophy of the
I coast championship. The players lined
up as follows:
Business Men. Position. Athens.
F M. Goodrich. Forward F. Bock
Louis Titus Forward J. Lancaster
W. Wilson Center F. Edwards
C. Bernhard XJuard H. Muller
C. J. Auzer Suard W. E. Rode
In the first half the play was consider
ably broken up by the rulings of the offi
cers, who applied the rules as strictly as
possible in order to avoid any roughness
and to control the excitement which pre
vailed all during the great game. Points
were made during the first twenty min
utes by Titus and Wilson for the local team
i and by Bock and Lancaster for the Oak-
I landers. The score stood 6 to 4 in favor
of the Business Men when the whistle
blew for the intermission, and It was this
lead that saved the game for the local
players, as both teams secured 6 points
j each in the second half.
The Athens played the game under a
protest against the disqualification of one
of their players at the game played last
' week. The "ruling was made for one year
; without appeal, but the Athens will bring
' the matter up before the league commit
j tee and make also a legal fight for the
I championship honors.
EARLY MAIL CLOSING.
Postmaster Montague Bequests Busi
ness Men to Deposit Their
Mail Early and Often.
Postmaster Montague has issued a cir
cular to business men on the Importance
of getting in their mail earlier than usual
during the present month while the mail
Is being weighed. The circular states
that at the present time a large propor
tion of the mail emanating from the busi
ness houses is hot deposited in the boxes
until late in the evening. The postmas
ter requests business men that all mail
matter be sent to the postofflce or mailed
in the street boxes frequently during the
day.
This is specially important at the pres
ent time while the malls are being
weighed and extra labor is thrown upon
the dispatching force at Station D at the
foot of Market street. As mail deposited
human. It was a pretty sight to see the
confidence which existed between them
selves and their mistresses. It was a
wonderful sight to turn from the contem
plation of the ladies and the horses and
look at full-grown men solemnly wander
ing around the Inclosed space without
even one little smile to show they were
conscious of the humor of the spectacle
they were voluntarily creating. Follow
ing the musical ride, which was partici
pated in by the following: ladies and
gentlemenâ Mrs. W. B. Hooper, Mrs.
Fannie Lent, Miss Kohler, Miss Rose
Hooper, Miss Elsie Lilienthal, Miss Far
quharson, Webster Jones, Charles de
Young, E. N. Bee, S. H. Boardman, W. B.
Chapman and G. C. B. Anderson â came
tilting at the rings.
This consisted of three gentlemen, W.
B. Chapman, Donzell Brown and H. T.
Bothin, trying to poke a stick through an
Iron ring, a la merry-go-round. Mr. Chap
man, a corpulent gentleman with a sandy
mustache, proved the winner, as he poked
five times and got five rings. He was
contested hard for his place by Brown,
who in five pokes only missed once by a
fraction of an Inch.
'ihe next feature on the programme
was tandem driving by Mrs. Fannie Lent,
Miss Farquharson, Webster Jones and

OUR DEFENSES.
Major Field of the United States
Artillery Talked About Them
to Grand Army Men.
George H. Thomas Post, G. A. R., gave
its first quarterly entertainment of the
year to its friends in the assembly hall of
the Red Men's Building last night, and
the audience that assembled crowded the
hall, which was tastefully decorated with
battle flags and corps badges. There was
presented a fine programme, which in
cluded vocal music by the Philomels and
by Carlton W. Seely, instrumental music
by H. A. Friedlander, a recitation by Miss
Virginia Cranne, and contributions by
the gramophone. The feature of the
evening, however, was a concise, interest
ing address on "The Defense of San
Francisco," by Major Edward Field. Sec
ond United States Artillery, Inspector of
Artillery for the Department of Califor
nia.
The major, In the outset, drew attention
to an article on coast defenses that ap
peared in a local paper, which set forth
that the defenses erected at this point
was a useless waste of money, as an ene
my from Point San Pedro could bombard
not only San Francisco, but the cities
across the bay. The speaker said that
was a case of an individual writing on a
subject with which he was not familiar,
and demonstrated that if an enemy at
tempted to shell San Francisco from the
point named the shells would fall four
miles short of the city and would be many
miles from the cities- across the bay.
He told of the manner in which the
fortifications have been erected, and how
the fire of the various batteries can be
concentrated on the approaching ships of
an enemy, and described the difficulty a
vessel or a fleet would encounter in an
endeavor to pass through the Golden
Gate. He explained the first line of de
fense outside of the Gate, the second
within it, and the third, which Includes
Sausalito Heights, Alcatraz, Angel Island
and Point San Jose. He also explained
the working of the big guns and the
mortars, and told that by pure mathe
matical calculation It is possible to range
batteries of sixteen mortars throwing
luoO-pound projectllfs, which can be fired
simultaneously at a vessel, and so accu
rate is the aim that a vesgel cannot es
cape being: struck. The only chance of
entering the harbor he seJd, would be
In a fog. Jn his opinion. San Francisco
is the best protected city in the United
States. He said that each gun put in
position was an International policeman,
and that all nations understanding that
they will not only think twice, but twenty
times before engaging in war. He be
lieved In peace, and declared that it must
not be purchased at the sacrifice of those
principles for which the soldiers of the
War of the Rebellion shed their blood.
The entertainment closed with the sing
ing of "America."
Justice Carroll's Wife Dead.
Mrs. John A. Carroll, wife of the well
known Justice of the Peace, died sud
denly yesterday at her residence, 2524 Clay
street. Mrs. Carroll had been suffering
from pneumonia, but was thought to be
on the fair way to recovery when the dis
ease took a sudden turn for the worse and
carried her aw- \\
Mrs. Carroll \sas an estimable lady and
leaves a host of friends to mourn her
loss. Justice Carroll is almost prostrated
by his wife's death, having sppnt several
days and nights nursing her continually.
Mrs. Clunie's Condition.
There was no change for the better in
the condition of Mrs. A. J. Clunle, wife
of the Insurance Commissioner, at a late
hour last nigni. Her friends have very
little nope of her recovery. Yesterday
Drs. Gardner and MaaMonagrle were
called in as consulting physicians with
Dr. Spencer, the family physician, but
nothing, seemingly, could be done to give
the family hope that she would get well.
San Bias Arrived.
The steamer San Bias arrived In port
from Panama last evening and anchored
off the barge office. The quarantine offi
cers will go aboard this morning, and the
vessel will then be alowed to dock. Cap
tain Russell made the run to this city in
twenty days, arriving: on schedule time.

The next two features, "Unicorn Team," !

School," in which ..irs. Hooper's beautiful :
Caprice was made to dance and waltz i

ingly pretty exhibitions of clever ridi>ig, I
and the pyramid team driving of Count j
de Bauvier, which followed, was about as
Skillful an exhibition of handling as one i
could wish to see.
Hurdle jumping, the most exciting part
of the whole programme, showed some
excellent riding by all who took part, and I
wound up the equine part of the enter
tainment, after which refreshments were
perved and a little informal dancing in
dulged in.
The exhibition taken as a whole was an
exceedingly pretty and for this city a
novel one. It snowed that among so
ciety's butterflies there are some who
have both the energy and courage to be- I
come perfectly accomplished horsewomen, j
who can well afford to stand comparison
with any in the world.
The part of the programme executed
by the men, however, was not so satis
factory, as it did not, excepting the tan
dem and pyramid driving perhaps, show
any degree of excellence that could not
be surpassed by the average fifteen-year
old Californian who never knew what a j
riding teacher was in his life.

HISTORY OF THE WORK.
High Prices Paid by tha Department
for Repairs on Accepted
Streets.
The Superintendent of Streets Is
pursuing a line of official condact that
| may involve himself and bondsmen In
I serious trouble. He is permitting con
tractors to charge an excessive sum
for street repairs and authorizing the
acceptance of inferior work. Examples
of his neglect or indifference can be
cited. He has made a private ar
rangement with the City Street Im
| provement Company, of which J. H.
McDonald is president, to do repair
work here and there on accepted
streets. The contractor charges about
what he pleases. McDonald's bills far
i the month of December amounted to
j $3285. A charge of 12 cents a square
I foot has been allowed for repairing bl
tumen where the old material belong-
| ing to the city was used In the repair.
There are items showing that the con
tractor has been allowed 20 cents a
| square foot for repairing accepted
I streets. New work can be done for a
! lower price than 20 cents a square
foot.

Alamo square do not reflect credit on
the department. As there are two
jobs known as Alamo square work, and
as both are pending in the Board of
Supervisors, it is necessary for The Call
to describe each:
In the board last Monday there was
a little breeze over a proposition to pay
J. M. Handley $900 for sidewalk on Ful
ton street from Scott to Steiner. This
work was done in December, 1896. and
an authorization was then passed for
its payment. The Mayor, who was
then young in office and zealous, went
out on the job and punched a hole in
the artificial sidewalk with his cane.
Then he came back to the City Hall
and punched the authorization with &
veto message. The contractor there
upon did some more work on the jol>.
He put in 380 square feet of new work
and then Deputy Streat Superintendent
Hoffman and Expert Sulivan of the
Street Committee of Supervisors, told
the committee that the work was all
right, and so at the last meeting of
the board Supervisor Britt introduced
another authorization for payment
which did not pass.
A motion to reconsider the vote by
which it failed to pass is now pending.
There is quite a history connected with
the job which the courts may unravel.
After Handley got the contract he as
signed the original demand to J. O'Bri
en, and on that demand O'Brien ob
tained quite a sum of money from the
cashier of Nathan, Dohrmann & Co. It
is a question now who would get the
money should the board allow the de
mand.
An examination of the work made by
The Call's expert yesterday shows noor
workmanship on the job. There are
many cracks and checks in the pave
ment. A hollow sound is given when
one steps on the sidewalk, indicating
that the foundation has settled away
from the top finish.
The other, or second. Alamo Square
job relates to a contract of a different
style. The Superintendent of Streets
simply entered into a private arrange
ment with J. J. Dowling for granite
curbing and grading of the sidewalk on
Scott street from Fulton to Hayes and
on Hayes street from Scott to Pierce.
Dowling charged Â§149". for the work.
The board passed the authorization,
but it was vetoed by the Mayor. Then
It was passed over the Mayor's veto
and reached the Auditor's office on its
way to the treasury. The Auditor held
up the demand, as the authorization
was contrary to law. The Supervisors,
in order to clear the record, proceeded
to pass a resolution for inviting bids
and performing the work as the law di
rected. Bids were opened last Monday,
although the work was done so long
ago that the grass is growing over the
curb. It was the plan for Dowling to
bid, at the sham bidding, the same
price that he was allowed to charge on
his private arrangement with the Su
perintendent of Streets, and therefore
his bid was 51495 85. P. McCarty put in
a bid for $1565. McCarty's offering must
have been a sympathetic proposal, as it
was a higher bid than that presented
by Dowling. Surprise, however, was
manifested when a rank outsider in the
person of L. D. Windrem intervened
and bid to do the work for $1399.
The bids were all referred to the
Street Committee. It transpires that
Dowling brought all the pressure at
his command to keep other contractors
off and Windrem was offered $25 by on*
who gave the name of W. H. Brown to
pull out his bid before It was opened.
When Windrem came out of his office
and asked a friend to point out Dow
ling, who was standing near by in a
group of men, Windrem was struck
with the remarkable resemblance which
Dowling bore to the man who had just
called and offered him $25 to pull out
the bid. Brown and DowHng are so
much alike that Windrem cannot tell
one from the other.
The little story that the contractors
are circulating among themselves that
The Call put up the job to have a lower
bid than Dowling's introduced is the
rankest kind of nonsense. The Call
simply exposed the scheme because It
was irregular and discreditable. It
should have been exposed by the
Mayor, the Supervisors and the Street
Department. L. D. Windrpm, a young
lawyer in the office of Rodgers & Pater
son, put in the low bid. He expects to
do the work and make a fair profit on
the job. When interviewed on the topio
yesterday, Mr. Windrem said: "A man
who gave his name as W. H. Brown,
called on me last Monday and stated
that he was one of the unfortunate con
tractors who had his money tied up In
the job, and said that he had made ar
rangements with other contractors not
to bid against him. He asked me not
to bid and I told him that I had an es
timate made and that I put In a bid
because I could make a profit of $300.
Brown offered me $25 to withdraw mf
bid and I declined to listen to him.
The same man that gave me his namÂ«
as Brown was pointed out on the street
to me as Dowling."
MELBA TO APPEAR HERE.
The Famous Prima Donna and th<
Metropolitan Opera Company
to Tour the Coast.
Liovers of grand opera have a treat in
store for them. Friedlander, Gottlob 4
Co. after a lengthy correspondence hayÂ«
succeeded in getting the Damrosch-ElliS
Company, which has appeared at the

I Pacific Slope.
At the head of the organization lfl
i Melba, the foremost prima donna now beÂ«
! fore the public, and supporting her are
such well-known singers as Ganskl, Sey
gard, Campanarl and Ibos, and a full
chorus.
Walter Damrosch will conduct thÂ«
! Metropolitan orchestra, which will ac
company the singers, and music-lovers
will have an opportunity of listening to
; his interpretation of Wagner. Damrosch
i has attained ,a high standing In musical
i circles as the youngest and brightest ol
j conductors.
A special train of palace cars. Including
; Melba's private car, will transport thÂ«
organization across the continent.
Tn speaking about the coming of tha
well-known company, Mr. Friedlander
said last evening that It was only after
i long negotiations that Manager Frank
! Damrosch could be induced to extend tha
! tour. About two years ago the latter
I visited this coast to look the ground over,

ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and Intention of the people of the

shall be gradually acquired and ulti
! mately owned by the City and County.
To this end It la hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
I works, steam, water or electric power
I works, telephone lines, street railroads
; and such other public utilities as tho
Supervisors or the people by petition to
I the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and .County, In order that
propositions for the acquisition, con-
Btruction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal Indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec 2. After auch plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the beet
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of eald
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop-
I ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
publio utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the ealo
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowegt possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as â¢will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without

cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. Tho
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu

sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors .and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but In
.case thÂ« votei caat la favor oj both
1718
propositions shall not exoeed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions Bhail be deemed re-
Nothing In this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
Detition of the electors requesting the
Acquisition of any publlo utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as a-iore
eaid to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same aÂ»
provided in section six of this Article
Â£nd from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
end County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
loritv vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
uuch acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
Whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
\inder the provisions of this Article
ehall so tar exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
cf as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for Buch
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded Indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
Indebtedness shall be Incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
fconds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
ehall have determined, as hereinbefore
g?et forth, to acquire any public utility,
Â«uch action on the part of the electors

barometric pressure and Is usuclly accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
ulong the coast, and the isobars extend north
â¢nd south alone the coasi, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these condition* will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March Wall street awoke
this morning to a realization that It had been
duped. Speculators, consequently, wore a
i somewhat rueful aspect in all but that select
! Inner circle, which reaped the profits from the
well organized plan to precipitate a bear panic.
; It was very noticeable that those who were
* loudest yesterday in the production of the
i settlement alleged to have been arrived at
; between the United States and Spain were no
' longer active bidders for stocks and securities
to-day, although they are credited with hav
ing' parted with large holdings at the high
level yesterday. The sanguine expectations of
this element that values would go higher in
the Immediate future had been changed and
the short interest having been largely elim
inated by yesterday' 3 forceful process, the
market â  was without material â¢ support and
prices promptly dropped off from about 1 per
cent to upward of 2 per cent in the opening
sales. They did not rise much above top prices i
except In a few cases at any time during the
day. Some of the smaller dealers who had |
confidentially swallowed all the bogus news
that was fed them yesterday were anxious to
sell stock which they bought then. The bears
also took some heart when they discovered
I what had frightened them, and ventured upon
some operations, but in a limited manner.
This was shown In the way by which they
scampered to cover when the bulls began to
mark prices In the afternoon. This Improve*
ment did not hold, but the subsequent relapse
did not carry' prices to the lowest point of the
day. The list shows net declines, nevertheless,
of between 1 and 2 points in the large majority
of Important stocks. London was both a buyer
and seller here, support from aDroad being es- !
pecially manifest in the Northern Pacific j
stocks. There seems to be an Impression in I
London that the Northwestern passenger rate
war Is in the course of adjustment. Foreign
' exchange stiffened sharply In response to ad
ditional .engagements of about $3,000,000 gold
for import, bringing the total on the move- j
ment to over $64,000,000, exclusive of receipts !
at San Francisco. Rates for money are stfffly
< held It Is not thought probable that the
movement of gold from Europe will cease un
til rates for loans become easier.
Prices of bonds moved in sympathy with
i Â«t'Â»"kH the speculative Issues snowing the
sharpest declines. Total sales. $1,575,000.

advices caused a' general recovery in the
stock market here to-day, led by Americans
and Spanish fours. Still, on balance, realiza
tions predominated and prices here were
slightly under the New York parity, and the
close was rather dull In the street. The rise
has Immensely relieved the financial situation,
however, and the settlement to-morrow is not
generally feared.
Gold Is in stronc: demand for New York.
In addition to the Â£250.000 withdrawn from

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. March Wheat opened exceed
ingly weak. initial trades in July ranging from
83% cto 83* c, or %@%c under yesterday's clos
ing price. May was a cent lower at $1 04*4
and declined at once to $1 04. The future, how
ever, was little heard from and remained at
that price with scarcely a trade of note until
I late in the session. Some July selling orders
| were prominent at first and it took but a brief
| time to break the price to 82% c. The break
' in Wall street stocks and the day's develop
; ments at Washington created decided uneasi
! ness among traders, and led to the abandon
ment of much of the wheat taken on during
yesterday's advance, â  and to the almost total
withdrawal of â¢ Influential support from the
market. The situation as to Cuba Indeed con
stituted about the only feature of the market,
j as little else was given any attention. Tho
] market continued to drop for an hour, getting
I down as low as 82% c, when buying against
"puts" caused a rally to S2%c. Outside of this
demand there was little buying from any
source and the, market again sagged, though
slowly, until around the noon hour. Then
greater weakness was developed. â¢ The proceed
ings in the Senate resulted in a lot of long
property coming on the market and Increased
the volume of short selling in a marked de
gree, July breaking under the pressure to 81% c.
Then the market hardened under a covering
movement which assumed respectable propor
tions for a time and caused a rally to 82% c.
Near the close a sharp break in May, caused
j by the attempt to market a fairly large line
' on an unsupported market, resulted in re
i newed activity among the July bears, and
I prices slipped off again In a very short time
to Wic. After the liquidation In May was
over, Letter brokers had no difficulty in bid
ding the price, which had fallen to $1 01 Vs. up
to $1 04Vi again, and this quick reaction caused
I a little better feeling In July. The .market
! rallied to SlTi@S2c, and closed at that figure.
There was quite heavy selling in long corn
all day and the market was weak from the
start The break was altogether in sympathy
with wheat ami the Washington news.
Oats were rather slower and weak. Liqui
dation, which marked the early hours, was In
sympathy with the wheat break. Support was
not lacking, however, and caused a slight re-
Provisions were Irregular, though In the main
weak Washington news caused a good de* Jot
uneasinetis among holders and this and the
depression in grain prices, were the features
of the selling. â  ...

CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
NEW YORK, March â The Journal of !
Commerce says; No improvement' In business !
; In any line of Calif rnla fruits has : occurred. [
: The general Impression among both commission j
i merchants and Jobbers at this end seems to be j
that' the damage done rto fruit crops In
California has been greatly overdrawn, but
some appear to think that coming crops will
necessarily be light if half of the statements j
regarding. existing conditions are true. At the I
same time they are not disposed to back up i
j their opinions by speculative purchases
i In view of the very uncertain condition of
' business and dubious outlook on the Cuban
| question.

but at present no one appears disposed to
| buy, and to force sales on the present mar
- ket a liberal concession In values would have
to be made. The fact Is that no one cares
to buy at present, and at such a time It is
poor policy to attempt to sell.

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEAT FREIGHTS.â The advance In wheat
and the dry weather continue to operata
against freight* and the market rules very
dull at 22s 9d aaked and 20s bid, usual op
tions. The chartered wheat fleet In port haa
a registered tonnage of 19,000, against 12,000
tons on the same date last year; disengaged,
H.SOO tons, against 89,600; on the way to this
port, 200, 400 tons, against 239,500.
WHEATâ The Benares takes for Liverpool
54,1i0 ctls, valued at $81,000.
A decline at Chicago was offset by the dry
weather here, hence there was no weakness
apparent In the spot market, though futures
were rather easier on the early sessions. There
Is very little wheat offering.

McKENZIE IS
NOW IN JAIL
Confessed to the Grand
Jury He Told Two
Stories.
Trouble Arises From the Note
Sent to Officer Ham
merton.
Harry ThomM Summoned to Give
Evidence at To-Day's
Session.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 29.
Robert McKenzie, who carried the
letter from Secretary Haxry. Thomas to
Officer Hammertcm asking for $100, is in
Jail by order of the Grand Jury.
The courthouse was alive with police
officers to-day, who had been sum
moned to appear before the Grand Jury
to tell whether they were asked for
loans, or whether they paid money in
any form to obtain or hold their posi
tions. The ten new officers were ail on
hand and each was before the jury- J-
W. Kesler and John Devereaux, who
wanted to be police officers but were
disappointed, were also present in an
swer to subpenas, and Police Captain
Wilson, City Attorney Dow, Chief
Lloyd. Harry Thomas and others were
examined during the day.
Chief Lloyd was under examination
for a long time and was required to tell
his reasons for every recommendation
he made.
Robert McKenzie was the next wit
ness. He is the man who, it is alleged,
carried the letter from Harry Thomas
to Officer Hammerton asking for a loan
of $100. Harry Thomas positively de
nies the authenticity of the letter and
pronounces it a forgery. McKenzie at
first denied that he knew anything at
all about the matter, but on cross-ex
amination he fell down and told of go
ing to Hammerton with a letter and
admitted that he had previously been
giving wrong testimony.
The testimony was of such a charac
ter that the Grand Jury was anxious
to retain him, although they did not
feel Justified at this stage in issuing a
warrant. McKenzie was asked if he
would consent to be detained in the
County Jail for twenty-four hours and
he expressed his willingness to be im
prisoned.
At the County Jail McKenzie was in
clined to be very reticent. He admitted
that he had given some contradictory
testimony to the jurors, and said he had
finally concluded to tell the truth to
save himself.
The Grand Jury will meet at 10
o'clock to-morrow morning and a sub
pena was issued to-night for Harry
Thomas. This gave rise to a rumor that
an indictment had been issued, but
Harry Thomas said there was nothing
served on him but a subpena.
SHOT HIMSELF
IN HIS BED
Suicide of Emele Peterson at
an Early Morning
Hour.
A Cancer and Love Affairs Said to
Have Been the Cause
of It
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 29.
Mrs. J. B. Myrick of 1674 Eighth street
found Emele Peterson dead in bed this
forenoon, he having shot himself in the
right temple some time previous. She at
once notified Fred Eiben, Peterson's
brother-in-law, who forced an entrance
to the dead man's room. The body was
wrapped up in the bedding and a der
ringer was lying upon the pillow.
Peterson has been a sufferer from a
cancer on his face, which greatly wor
ried him. He worked for Eiben & Noe
during the former's absence in the East.
On his return Peterson gave up his posi
tion because it waa bo confining. He Is
well known here, and it is said that be
has been disappointed In love.
The deceased was a native of Germany
and 33 years old. He was unmarried. He
was out late last night, and, when he
failed to get up for breakfast, nothing
was thought of it. Later Mrs. Myrick
â went to his room, but found it locked.
This was unusual, and she looked under
the transom. It was then that she dis
covered something wrong. He left no
writing of any kind to explain the rash
deed.
An inquest waa held to-night and death
ascribed to his own hand Trom despond
ency.

HOW OPIUM
GETS INTO JAIL
Story of a Man Who Lived
Many Years at San
Quentin.
Political Guards Traffic in the
Drug and Make Big
Money.
â¢
Some Con-vlots With Coin Are Able
to Purchase Immunity From
Hard Labor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 29.
So long as the State prisons are po
litical Institutions periodical riots and
! murders, due to the use of opium, will
continue to shock the public and dis
grace the State. A citizen of Oak
land, who is now doing well, but who
was released a few years ago after
serving a long term for a crime com
mitted in San Francisco, has sent to
The Call the following interesting com
munication on the causes of the trou
bles at State prisons:
OnÂ© of the members of the Board of
State Prison Directors has been ap
pointed a committee of one to travel
thousands of miles and expend many
hundred dollars to visit and investi
gate the workings of other penal insti
tutions. They could have found more
than enough to occupy their attention
at home had they performed their
duty as required by their oath of of
fice. Are the directors ignorant of cer
tain things that take place within the
prison walls? I think not. However
that may be, I know those institutions
are conducted in such a loose manner
as wardens of Eastern prisons would
consider shameful. Professional crim
inals find conditions there that suit
them very much. Young criminals,
boys from the country towns of tender
years who have committed their first
offense, are sent to herd with the most
vicious, and no attempt is made to
separate those who have committed
their first offense and the most hard
ened.
Most of the men who enter the walls
of San Quentin do not use opium. Yet
a few months after they enter they
are in all probability confirmed opium
fiends, especially the young, who are
easy victims to the seductive drug. It
is not long after that the drug works
upon their worst passions. It is then
that the most degraded of men tind
their opportunity, and the poor young
victim falls so low in the scale of hu
manity as to be shunned by all who
have the slightest respect for them
selves.
The officers try, or pretend to try. to
prevent opium from entering the pris
on walls.' But without avail. Why?
Because as long as the prison is run
on a political basis it will be almost
impossible to prevent the entry of
opium. Just look at the inducement
offered those who smuggle the drug
inside. Opium within the walls is al
ways worth ten times what it is worth
outside, and at times when what is
called a "famine" prevails, It brings
as high as $150 to $175 per pound, and
number two (2), or second quality, at
that.
Many of the guards are sent to the
"Warden with a political recommenda
tion to which the Warden is forced to
pay consideration. His qualifications
for the positon are not even consid
ered; he is received and appointed to
pay a political debt. Now. it is
through such men that opium is intro
duced Into the prison.
I have known opium to com* In by
the bucketful, supposed to be eggs.
This was during the time that John
McComb was Warden, and It was a
relative that brought It in.
It was under this administration
that crime ran rampant, murders were
of frequent occurrence, and seldom
waa there a conviction for such acts.
The prison is nothing more than a
large manufactory, the amount of
goods turned out being considered
above everything else.
On one occasion the officers of the
prison had to appeal to the Governor
to pardon a youthful criminal from
Oregon for the reason that he was de
moralizing those within the walls. He
was pardoned. The convict best able
to supply the wants of others, such as
opium, good bed furniture and a bet
ter grade of food will be the one to
run things and to create jealousies.
The result is deadly combat and until
such htings are done away with there
will always be trouble, and it is against
reason to suppose that men can be re
formed and come out and be good
members of society as long as such a
state of affairs exists. It is simply
offering the prisoner inducements to
become more evil Instead of good. Fa
voritism exists to some extent. Those
convicts with money and Influence
stand a much better chance of secur
ing release than those without money
and friendless. It used to be a com
mon thing for convicts with money to
purchase Immunity from hard labor
and obtain good food by paying to be
put on the sick list. There is not
enough attention paid to prison disci
pline and too much attention paid to
the jute mill. If they can force the
convicts to turn out bags enough to
keep within the yearly appropriation
everything elee is of minor Impor
tance. Until they pay more attention
to the physical and moral welfare of
the inmates they will always have re
peaters. A new prison or a remodel
ing of the old so that men can be kept
separate is In order. Until this is done
It is useless to speak about reforma
tion.
Sunday Services at County Infirmary.
OAKLAND, March 29.â Rev. F. Smith,
an indigent admitted to the County In
firmary from Supervisor Church's dis
trict, has begun Sunday services at that
institution. He 1b an old Methodist
minister, and delivered a sermon on the
"Power of the Tongue" which he once de
livered in Spurgeon's church in London.
He will continue the services in the din
ing-room while he stays there.
The Altenheim's Portion.
OAKLAND, March 29.â Mrs. Johanna
Hiegel, who died November 21, 1896, left a
will bequeathing her property to societies
as follows: The Infant Shelter of San
Francisco, the German General Benevo
lent Society of San Francisco and the
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 1898.
German Home for Old Peopleâ Deutsches
Altenhelmâ at Fruitvale. The will pro
vided $200 for the shelter, one-half of the
estate for the Benevolent Society, and the
other half to the Akenheim. The estate
consists of $1915, out of the $2543 64 that
came into the administrator's hands. Af
ter paying the other bequests there re
mained $807 50 fnr each institution. But
the law forbids that more than one-third
of an estate shall be left to charitahlo in
stitutions. One-third of this estate is
$638 33. Hence a petition has been filed to
ascertain judicially whether tho Alten
heim Is a charitable organization.
Police and Fire Changes.
OAKLAND, March 29.â 1t is probable
that there will be some changes made to
morrow by the Board of Public Works
in the heads of the Police and Fire de
partments. The Mayor and City Engineer
Clement are said to have entered Into an
agreement to promote Captain Fletcher
to the head of the Police Department and
to Put Nick Ball in the Fire Department.
The Mayor said to-day that there might
be changes to-morrow, but he would not
say so positively. At the present time
both the Mayor and City Engineer have
grievances against City Attorney Dow,
and this helps to give color to the truth
of tho rumored changes.
Supervisor Roeth Testifies.
OAKLAND, March 29. â Supervisor
Roeth was on the witness stand to-day
in his own behalf during the trial before
Judge Ellsworth In the Superior Court.
He claimed that he paid Individually for
the cutting: of all of the trees he kept.
These were given him by E. A. Heron, the
agent for the property adjoining the
street from which they were cut. A ques
tion was raised regarding the ownership
of certain other trees, he said, and he re
fused to take them. The trial will be con
tinued to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
Fabiola Hospital Derby Day.
OAKLAND. March 29.â The closing day
at the Emeryville trade this spring is to
jbe Fabiola Hospital Derby Day. Presi
dent Thomas Williams has so notified the
i ladies and arrangements are being made
accordingly. The decorations are all to
be ribbons and it is expected that the at
tendance will be even greater than a year
ago. The entire proceeds of the day will
go to the Hospital Association.
Muchmore Returns Home.
OAKLAND, March 29. âAugust Much
more, who left a short time ago to estab
lish a weekly newspaper at Skaguay, has
returned without going: further than Se
attle. His partner investigated the field
and advised a delay. Muchmore is con
sidering a proposition to establish another
paper at Seattle.
Ex-Governor Haight's Widow Dead.
OAKLAND, March 2?.â Mrs. H. H.
Haight, widow of ex-Governor Haight of
California, died at the family residence,
1201 Alice street, to-night. Mrs. Haight
has been sick for some time and her
death was not wholly unexpected.
NEED WATER FOR SPRINKLING.
The Prospective Drouth Threatens
Great Damage to Berkeley
Streets.
BERKELEY. March 29.â Superintendent
of Streets Guy H. Chick has requested the
| Town Trustees to take immediate steps
| to secure water lor sprinkling the streets
j of Berkeley, which he fears will be cut to
I pieces during the coming summer if the
1 town is going to rely upon the scant
i supply of water which the Alatneda
I Water Company is almost certain to have
; for the purpose. He suggests that water
:be obtained from wells, one near the
â  Town Hall, another in North Berkeley,
| another near College avenue and Char
ming way and another near Berkeley sta
j tion, by means of a portable pump.
The Oakland Paving Company has also
| submitted a proposition to supply the
j town with water for sprinkling purposes.
! It offers to lease to the town for a period
! not to exceed five years the well on its
D wight way property at a rental of $S
I per month, if the flow is less than 20,000
; gallons per day. or $10 per month if the
'flow exceeds 20,000 gallons a day. The
: matter has been referred to Trustees
Maslin and Le Conte of tfie Street Com
mittee, who will report at the next regu
lar meeting of the board.
; _-â¢Â« :
BERKELEY MAY HAVE COURTS.
Then Saloon-Keepers "WTio Refuse to
Pay Licenses Will Be Disciplined.
BERKELEY, March 29.â President J.
|W. Richards of the Board of Town
| Trustees declares that a number of "West
Berkeley saloon-keepers are taking ad
! vantage of the fact that there are no
] courts in Berkeley and refuse to pay their
i licenses. He proposes that they be pun
j isned by being refused licenses when the
j local courts are re-established.
There is a prospect that the town may
win its appeal from the recent decision of
the Superior Court declaring the Berkeley
Justices' courts illegal. In the decision of
the Supreme Court just handed down in
reference to the validity of the Police
Court of Sacramento, while the courts
were declared illegal, three of the jus
tices â McFarland, Van Fleet and Gar
routte â gave the dissenting opinion that
the Legislature has the right to create
special courts. r ihis is one of the prin
cipal points at Issue In the Berkeley case,
and if Justice Beatty, who was not repre
sented in the Sacramento case, concurs
in the view taken by the dissenting Jus
tices, there will be a majority of the
court holding for the validity of the
Berkeley courts.
Anti-Spanish Demonstration.
BERKELEY, March 29.â Several sug
gestions for a substitute for rushing have
been made to the Sophomores since the
positive announcement by the faculty
that interclass rushes will no longer be
tolerated. Professor Joseph? Le Conte has
suggested that the two lower classes se
lect rushing teams and that the members
of the team train for the rush as they
would for any athletic event. The very
latest scheme, however, is the proposition
of V. H. Henderson, a prominent member
of the class of 1900, that the sophomores
get up an "Anti-Spanish" celebration,
such as has been given at the University
of Michigan and other Eastern colleges.

THE BEST HERE
IN TRAINING
Ed Corrigan's Colt Geyser
Made Fleur de Lis
Look Cheap.
Followers of the Favorites and
Tod Sloan Passed a
Restless Day.
Song and Dance Waltzed In at Odds
of 2O to 1 in tho Third
Rase.
After rolling up a string of eight suc
cessive victories. It has at last dawned
on the racing public in general t-iat Gey
ser, the bay colt by Ben All-Hot Springs,
racing in the colors of Ed Corrigan, is a
pretty fair sort 01 a horse. But It was
not until he met Fleur de Lis in tne
seven-furlong run at Ingleside yesterday
that he showed what he really is capable
of doing. The mare was an 11 to 10 favor
ite in the betting, but there was no part
of the route that Geyser did not hold her
safe, and when Tod Sloan finally gave the
latter his head he won with comparative
ease In I:26VÂ£, making a new record. The
favorite finished two lengths before Paul
Griggs for the place. Eight to five was
the general price about the winner around
post time.
It was not a healthy day for first
choices, the two-year-old Leo Vertner
being the only one blessed with a pair of
brackets. The followers of Tod Sloan
were also a bit shaken up and dusty at
the conclusion of the sport, for Tod
reached the wire nrst on but one occasion,
though in all of his races he was knocking
at the door.
Thorpe, astride Humidity, the 6 to 5 fa
vorite for the opening two-year-old
scramble at four furlongs, was unfor
tunate in getting cut off soon after the
barrier was released, and finished in the
show. Toluca, ridden by Lonnie Clayton,
led throughout, beating Winifred in a
drive.
Leo Vertner was a pronounced favorite
for the "kindergarten" four and a half
furlong spin, and downed his field very
handily. Gold Scratch took place honors
from Zaccatoso.
Crotchety Song and Dance furnished a
mild sensation in the mile and a charter
selling run, for which Satyr ruled a 3 to
10 chance. At odtls of 15 and 20 to 1 he
drew clear of his field when six furlongs
had been covered, "and won in runaway
fashion, covering the distance in 2:08H-
In a drive, Sloan, on the favorite, secured
the place from Tulare.
Rosormonde looked a good bet to take
the mile run, fifth on the card, but when
galloping out In front Holmes let the
mare run wide with him when turning
into the stretch, and was passed by ooth
Soscol and major Hooker. The former,
second choice in ihe betting, won handily
by a quarter of a dozen lengths.
With the more dangerous ones
scratched, Corrigan's filly, Daisy F was
sent to the post favorite for the final
seven-furlong run. Free Lady, at 5 to 1,
made all the running, and, with consider
able in reserve at the end, led the choice
past the juuges oy two lengths.
TRACK ITEMS.
The presence of Satyr in the mile and a quar- !
ter event spoiled a very good betting race, and I
it looked like bad form on the part of his !
owner to start him, especially bo when the j
fact is taken into consideration that he took
a purse on the preceding day. The colt was
entered to bÂ« sold for $400, and wta claimed by
Wally Weaver, owner and rider of Tulare.
He stands his new owner $700. which looks a
very fair bargain.
The Corrisran entries played in hard luck
yesterday. Out of five starts, horses carrying
the green with white sash were four times
placed second.
It looks very much now as though Sid
Reagan, who claimed Hohenzollern and Her
moso on Monday, .bit of more than he could
swallow. Upon investigation the Judges find
that only last week Reagan was hustling
around in an endeavor tc borrow a few dollars.
The ex-jockey's horses are stabled at Ingleslde,
while stalls were already prepared at the Oak
land track fur the horses claimed. It Is the
supposition that Reagan was simply acting as
agent for W. 11. Tlmmons, and more than
likely both horses will be returned to their
original owners.
Benamela seems to have jrone to the bad en
tirely. In most of his recent races the brown
horse has sulked, and yesterday he pulled up
very lame out of the thirl race.
Free Lady was undoubtedly short in her race
run previous to yesterday. On Thursday last
she was very prominent to the stretch In a
six-furlong sprint and then "blew up."
Sloan's ride on Satyr was one of the poorest
he has thus far furnished. He got the colt
badly messed about and made his run alto
gether too late.
Recent indications point to the early rein
statement by the Jockey Club of the well
"THE CALL'S" RACING CHART.

ALKALI LAND VEGETATION.
The University Issues a Bulletin
Giving Jesuits of Important
Experiments.
BERKELEY, March 29.â The agricul
tural department of the university has
just issued in pamphlet form a bulletin
detailing the results of important inves
tigations recently made by J. Burtt Davy
of the department of botany, on the na
tive vegetation of alkali lands. The In
vestigations showed that there are many
varieties of plants which flourish exclu
: sively on alkali land and other varieties
which can be raised on alkali lands, al
though not tolerant of the strongest al
kali.
Mr. Davy found as a result of his Inves
tigations that the following plants are
suitable for cultivation on alkali soils:
OX STRONG ALKALI.
Salt bushes, all being fodder plants; modiola,
| fodder; wild millet, fodder; kolreuteria panicu

Affairs In tha real estate line are
nearly at a standstill. Only now and

considerable trouble in their consum
mation.
