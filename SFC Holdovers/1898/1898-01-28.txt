ed by the League.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 27.â Whereas. There is no evidence agrainst
the accused. Walter L. Webb, on either of the charges against htm,
other than the unsupported, uncorroborated testimony of C. H. Ax
tell and J. F. Adams; and.
Whereas. Ftnth <>f these witnesses have time and again confessed
to the commission of perjury in this examination and before the
Grand Jury of the county and before the Superior Court of this coun
ty; and.
Whereas. Neither of said men is worthy of belief, and their testi
mony is absolutely without weight; therefore be it
Resolved. That all proceedings against Mr . Webb be and they are
hereby dismissed as not having been in any way sustained.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27.â 8y a vote i
of four to three the Los Angeles City
Board of Education to-night adopted
the resolution given herewith, and
thereby ended all proceedings against
Walter L. Webb.
This restores Mr. Webb to his full
powers ;is a member of the Board of !
Education. It is an exoneration from
th*' charges of bribery that were
brought against him and prosecuted
by the League for Better City Govern
ment. It shows those charges to have
brought without good cause and
leaves it an open question as to the mo
tive that inspired the prosecution.
it not for the seriousness of the
a.ffair, so far as concerns the man
placed under fire all these many weeks,
the whole proceeding before the Board
of Education was nothing le&s than a
farce, more particularly since the for- j
jUlttal of Webb be
fore the Superior Court.
o n thÂ« call of the roll Poor, Bartlett, '
Mathis and Mclnerny voted aye, and
Conroy, Davis and Braly voted no.
Kubach was absent, and Webb of
course refrained from voting. An an
alysis of this vote shows that the three
men who voted against the adoption of
the resolution are members of the
League for Better City Government.
Two of these. Chairman Davis of the \
board and Director Conroy, are attor
neys, who, by reason of their education
and training, should have a true and
clear conception of the value of testi
mony. Yet in the face of the fact, pa
tent to everybody who attended the
sessions of the board during this in- I
vestipration, that no scrap of testimony
against Webb was brought to light, ex
cept that given by Axtell and Adams, !
self-confessed perjurers, these two ,
members voted against the resolution, j
Braly, who cast the third vote
against it. is now under investigation,
and according to a rule adopted by the '
board on December T, 1897, he should ;
not have been permitted to vote. This ;
rule reads as follows: "No member of |
the board resting under charges shall
be permitted to vote upon any ques
tion arising during or connected with
the examination of said charges."
When the board adjourned, almost
immediately after the adoption of the \
resolution, Webb's friends crowded
about him to offer their congratulations,
while his erstwhile persecutors, Attor
ney Thomas E. Gibbon and Pastor
Burt Estes Howard in particular,
fumed, foamed and frothed at the re- J
suit of their desperate and despicable i
attempt to ruin the accused for reasons j
already stated in these columns.
When the result of the vote was an
nounced the serpents, who train with |
the Jekyll-Hyde leaders of the League I
for Better City Government, giving I
way to their natural instincts and hab- i
Its. hissed.
The finale in the Webb proceedings j
â¢was not reached to-night without dis- ;
plays of the most intense animosity on j
the part of the prosecution, which took j
its defeat with ill-concealed chagrin.
There was also a sore disappointment !
for ihe syndicated Times-Herald-Ex
press in the action of the Board of
Education to-night. With their one j
syndicated voice they declared at the
time Davis was elected chairman of the
board that the power of Webb in that
body hu<l been broken. Admitting that
they were correct in this, they must
now admit, if they wish to avoid stul
tifying themselves, that Webb was
fairly and fully acquitted by the vote
of the board to-night.
In closing the case for the prosecu
tion, when tho-sosslon of the board be
gan. Attorney Oliver proceeded to read
part of the testimony given by Adams
in the Superior Court, all of Adams' j
testimony having been admitted in
this investigation. Th" portion read
by Oliver was the cros.fc' xamlnatlon
of Adams by Attorney K. A. Meserve,
In part as follows:
A <*I n ITT T understood Mr. Webb to say
that he received it from Mr. Axtellâ sGo
of the Cooper money. Now. if T am
wrong. God Almighty knows I would not
try to convict any living person, and I
don't, nor have dono it In ali my life. If
I ceU a lie, it isn't because I want to. It !
isn't my motive, hut !t is because I hava i
been sick and ill and have been per- I '
suaded, first by one man and then by
another â the City Government League !
and then another leagueâ and have been
under the doctor's care for three or four i
The San Francisco Call
months. If I lie, I am sorry; it Is the
fault of the head and not of the heart,
because I don't want to.
When Oliver came to that part in j
which Adams said he had been per- j
suaded to lie, first by one man and
then another, he remarked, "This does
not necessarily refer to Mr. Gibbon."
At this fling Gibbon exploded like a
powder magazine into which an elec- !
trie spark had been discharged, and in i
response to his vehement protestations
about being referred to in this manner
by the counsel for the defense, all J
such further " professional courtesies ;
were prohibited by the chairman. In
j another portion of the cross-examin-
I ation of Adams occurred the following:
If Mr. Webb.ewore that' he never told â¢
j you he got the $60 you would believe him
| in preference to your own recollection, ;
! wouldn't you?
A.â I might have been mistaken, Just,
like I have been in some"* other thing's.
How, this is God Almighty's truth that 1
am stating.
Q.â You may have been mistaken?
' A.â Yes.
When Oliver had concluded Director !
Poor made the following prefatory re- i
marks In introducing the resolution
already mentioned:
"I think that even if the gen
tleman argued the matter for a week
| it would make no difference. The mem
bers are just as ready to vote now as
they would be if arguments were made.
As far as the final outcome is con
\ cerned, I am very much in favor of dis- :
missing this case just where it is. To
that end I wish to present this reso
lution."
Bartlett said he seconded the resolu
tion with much pleasure.
Director Mclnerney made an amend
ment to the effect that all the charges
against Mr. Braly be also dismissed.
Chairman Davis ruled the amend- I
ment out of order on the ground that
Braly's case had not yet been formally
considered.
Director Braly objected to the
amendment on the ground that no
charges have yet been preferred
against him, as only a resolution re
questing that charges be brought ;
against him had been adopted by the
board. He spoke against the resolu- '
firm ctnri In fa \*r\-w r\f VÂ»j%n*-I**Â» A â_.. ! '
mm a.uu in iu.vcjr oi nearing argu- |
ments.
Chairman Davis spoke in favor of â 
arguments.
Director Poor declared that he had
no desire to choke off anything that !
anybody might want to say, and added
that he did not believe that any argu
menta that might be made would pro
duce the least effect on or change the
vote of any member.
Gibbon again got the floor, and tried '
to argue on the merits of the main is- I
sue, intimating, among other things,
that if -the board did not convict Webb
the people would be in no humor to i
vote the bonds asked by the Board of
EducatU-n for improvements in the
school department.
Director McEnerney signified his i
willingness to forego arguments, and
the roll was called. When it came Di- !
rector Mathis' turn to vote he explain- '
ed his position by saying that as the i
Superior Court had decided Mr Webb '
was not guilty, he felt that he co-uld
not v,,tc otherwise than in the affirma- i
tive.
This r-!f>ars the stag? for the n^xt act. i
It is now Mr. Hraly's turn to be inves
tigated under the direction of the

DENVER. Jan. 27.â The National
Stock Growers' Convention culminated
in a wild scene at the Union Stock
Yards this afternoon, where a barbecue
was given. Arrangements had been
made for feeding: from 10,000 to 15.0*0
people. The viands prepared included
ten steers, two bears, two buffolaes.
four elk, seven antelopes, seven moun
tain sheep and 200 'possums. With this
was served 4000 loaves of bread. 200 gal
lons of coffee and 400 kegs of beer.
Between 20,000 and 30,000 people at
tended, the crush being tremendous.
The crowd lined the tables thirty to
forty deep. Chief of Police Farley and
forty-five policemen, together with a
detachment of the Denver City Troop
were wholly unable to preserve order.
The crowd charged the bread tables
and carving boards. The police and
military were pelted with bread and
the chief use of meat was to cl.ub neigh
bors on the head. Within less than
fifteen minutes there was ah end of the
barbecue, and not one-tenth of those
present got a bite.
Trooper Victor Goethe was overcome
in the rush and seriously injured.
Bread, meat of all kinds, buffalo, bear,
mountain sheep, elk, antelope,- were
scattered all' about/and r>off>o HtPralir
drenched the ground. Tables, fences
and all other destructible property the
mob could lay hands on were torn down
and ruined.
Women were borne away fainting and
men were clubbed, but the mob could
not be swayed. Scarcely one person
in a hundred got within a block of the
roasting pits, which had been arranged
to entertain the guests throughout the
afternoon and well into the night.
At 8 o'clock to-night an unknown man
was brought in from the scene of the
riot, fatally injured. He expired soon
after reaching the police station. He
had been struck on the back of the
head by some one in a fight, and never
recovered from the blow. A number
of others are reported injured, but
none fatally.

won promotion by his daring. After
the Invasion of Havana Province by
the rebels he and Colonel Raoul Arango,
another young officer, conducted daring ;
and unusually successful operations In
the immediate neighborhood of Havana ',
City. Arangueren was so much op

an offer of peace, Arangueren ordered
the court-martial and execution of the |

FRATRICIDE CLARK
FACES CITIZENS
OF ST. HELENA
People Listen Patiently While the Mur=
dered Man's Widow Tells Her
Shameful Story.
FRATRICIDE CLARK RIDES INTO ST. HELENA.
PT. HELENA. Jan. 27.â George
Clark, the most despicable of mur
derers, has passed physically un
scathed through the first day of his
preliminary examination. The day's
work is over. Clark, the Sheriff, and his
deputies are back in Napa. and no sign
of the threatened lynching has been
manifested.
The streets were crowded here this
morning as the team containing the
four men drove rapidly by. Of course,
there were men watchiisf, but there
were also women, any number of them,
standing on the sidewalk to get a
glimpse of the man. whose crime is
the only thing that makes him worth
looking at. There were children, too,
for school was out, and on one corner a
father stood holding his baby high in
his arms, while a little farther toward
the Town Hall. In an invalid chair, sat
a woman, who had been brought out
that she might not miss the sight.
The whole day has been taken up
with Mrs. Clark's examination and
cross-examination. All day she sat so
; near to George Clark that he could
touch her if he stretched out a hand,
repeating words that might scorch a
woman's lips. Yet her voice, though
weak and subdued at first, showed no
emotion. She had the grace to hide
her face behind a thick black veil, and
she spoke in so low a tone that her
, words were scarcely audible. But if
' Mrs. Clark were a sensitive womanâ a
sensitive Mrs. Clark would be a para
doxâl know she would have endured
enough in this one day's pillorying to
atone for the horrible life her words
made shamefully vivid.
Mrs. Clark had an opportunity to
svoid the repetition of that unspeak
ably shameful story she had already
told. When District Attorney Bell's {
inquiries Hhowed that he intended to
question the woman as to her relations
with her brother-in-law. Attorney Ho- :
gan interfered and asked Justice Chirm
to instruct Mrs. Clark that she need
not answer the District Attorney's ;
questions if she didn't want to.
Mrs. Clark sat with downcast eyes,
her profile, which, by the way. Is not
so bad, dimly seen through her thick
veil, while the lawyers wrangled. Jus
tice Chirm advised her that answering
the question was optional.
Then he said: "Do you wish to an
swer?"
"I want to do what's for my own
best." Mrs. Clark answered, In a low,
complaining voice and sighing heavily.
"Of course, it's very painful for me to
go over my past life. But everybody
knows it, and I might as well tell it."
And she did. She told particulars,
under the District Attorney's cross
questioning, that a normal woman
would have suffered martyrdom before
admitting. She told of the beginning
of the vile history- She told of George
Clark's boyhood, when he was a pupil
at the school she taught in Illinois, and
he would make the fires and in a gen
eral way do Janitor work for the school
marm. She told of her marriage to her
husband, when she was 25 and William
Clark was 23 and George, the murder
er, was a lad of perhaps 13. She told
of the long years during which she out
raged the simplest canons of decency.
She described scenes with the murder
er, when she called fc/r her daughter's
interference, but she admitted that for
years there had not been even resist
ance on her part to George Clark's
making his brother's home an abom
inable, bestial place. She described the
little house where the tragedy took
place and where, on the night before
THE DRIVE TO ST. HELENA.
ST. HELENA, Jan. 27.â The trip from Napa to St. Helena this
morning with Murderer Clark was an uneventful one. Stories had
gone abroad last night at the county seat that the murderer would
never complete his journey; that angry citizens would assemble on the
road and lynch him. But they proved both false and ridiculous. No
plans for violence seemed even contemplated.
In view of these rumors and as a precaution Sheriff McKenzie
had four persons accompany himself and the pri&oner in the convey
ances. The party drove out of Napa at 8:40 o'clock and besides the
murderer, comprised Sheriff McKensie, Under Sheriff R. A. Rrownlee,
R. H. McKenzie, F. J. Brownlee and.S. W. Scotton. The guards were
armed and prepared for any possible onslaught, but their weapons re
mained in their pockets all the way, and only teams and curious on
lookers greeted the prisoner and party. The murderer himself was
much frightened.
"You don't think they'll get me. do you?" he asked, nervously, after
the start, and he huddled close to the Sheriff.
"No; don't worry, George." was the reassuring reply, and until the
suburbs of St. Helena were reached he seemed in an easier frame of
mind.
As the domes and steeples about his late home rose in view Clark
again became nervous. Everytimehe sawa staring: individual or a cluster
of men he would droop his head and move closer to the Sheriff. Every
body, it seemed, was out of doors, and Main street was thronged, but
all were quiet and orderly.
It was difficult for the two vehicles to reach the hall refected for the
examination. The people swarmed in front of it in great numbers, and
every one gazed at the prisoner. The latter looked up for a moment as
if to see if the widow was in sight. She was not, and his head dropped
again.
He alighted from the carriage and was hurried into the hall. He
presented a better appearance than when he left here a week ago. Be
fore starting from Napa a good suit of clothes was given him by the
Sheriff, which he donned as quickly as possible. The morning was
clear and cold, but before reaching St. Helena the atmosphere
warmed up, and the balance of the journey was pleasant. St. Helena
was reached at 10:45 o'clock.

THE LAWYERS WRANGLE
WHILE CLARK SITS BY
TAKING LITTLE INTEREST
Bitter Fight Begins in the Justice's Court
at St. Helena for the Life of the
Fratricide.
ST. HELENA, Jan. 27.â Every man
in St. Helena and for miles around was
at the preliminary examination of
Clark this morning. The little town
hall, which conveniently holds about
fifty, was packed with people, who
pressed up against the railing which
divides the little space just large
enough to hold five tables, at which sat
Justice Chlnn, District Attorney Theo
dore Bell, Attorneys Hogan and Beer
stecher for the defense, and the re
porters whom this remarkable case
have drawn to pretty, excited little St.
Helena.
The crowd was massed in the back
part of the hall, and mounted In hast
ily constructed pyramids toward the
door. There were boyish faces within
two feet of the wooden ceiling. The en
trance to the hall was blocked; on
either side, at the open windows, were
groups of laborers and farmers who
stood patiently straining to catch a
word now and then. When Deputy
Rednall went to close a window so that
the fresh, cool air might not blow in
a draft from one open window to the
other immediately opposite an earnest
eyed fellow, collarless. in a jumper and
overalls, with his slouch hat pulled
over his dark brows, pleaded with the
deputy as a child might.
"Oh. don't shut it," he exclamined,
and the good natured deputy pulled
the window only partially closed.
Why, even on the roofs of the houses
near, on a sort of gangway on the
north side, men climbed and crouched
and spoke in whispers. It was a mat
ter difficult for the officers of the court
even to make their way through the
mob. It was a good natured mob.
though, but with determination enough
in the faces to make one sure that, if
there were any chance of George
Clark evading Justice, they would re
sort â¢to extreme measures. So far as
one can measure that evasive thing,
public opinion, the chances are the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
people of St. Helena are not likely to
lynch this man. If they were tempted
by the chance of his staying here over
night, which the Sheriff would not per
mit, and if anything should occur dur
ing the examination to rouse a sus
picion in the minds of these people
that Clark might escape, the case will
be altered.
There was not the smallest demon
stration as the double-seated team con
taining Clark, the Sheriff and his depu
ties drove up the main street of St.
Helena. The crowd was strung out
along the sidewalk, watching curious
ly for the advent of the murderer. The
train on its way from Napa to St.
Helena halted at Rutherford, and there
the Sheriff and his party passed along
the road. Every head was turned to
see Clark, a pitiably inadequate cen
tral figure for interest so intense. He
sat huddled up on the back seat with
the Sheriff's protecting arms about
him. Sheriff McKenzie brought Clark
through a narrow alley, a back en
trance of the hall. He came into the
crowded hall, his dark eyes roving
about as if to gauge the degree of hos
tility in the mass of eager faces.
Clark looked ill. His face was sal
low, there were circles under his dull,
protruding eyes, and the line that
marked the jaw was heavy. He sat in
court with his heavy blue overcoat but
toned up to the chin. That overcoat,
by the way, was the one given to
George Clark by Dr. Osborn, which will
| be identified by Peter Yorke as the coat
worn by the man who fled in the early
: morning along the streets from \VH
i liam Clark's house on January 20.
He never looked at Mrs. Clark, who
sat beside him. giving her horrible tes-
I tlmony; he was nervelessly still, gaz
i ing stupidly in front of him, moisten
ing his lips at times, slowly twirling
his thumbs. But there was not a per
j son in the crowded, close courtroom
who sat so quietly.
Sheriff McKenzie had made arrange
â¢ ments to have the warrant on which
I George Clark was arrested sent by
: mail to St. Helena. When court con
â â  vened no warrant for Clark's arrest
was in St. Helena. The murderer
walked with lamb-like meekness out
of the back door into the anteroom, and
standing there blinking in the sunlight
submitted again to arrest. Again the
court preliminaries began to unwind
I their tedious course, when It was dis
1 covered that the Justice's name was not2
signed to warrant No. 2. This time the
attorney for the defense, enjoying the
mistake of the State's officers. Inter
posed.
"There being no warrant for this
man's arrest, lie's really a free man.
He could get up and walk out," said
Attorney Beerstecher, complacently.
"Why, certainly, have him get up and
walk out," retorted District Attorney
Bell.
"Well," sanl Henry Hogan amiably,
"he won't walk out."
"No," growled a voice from behind
the railing. "He shan't walk out this
way."
"No," whispered a lad.
"I'd like to see him pet through here,"
ran:? from a packed mass of men to the
left. These nun would have torn
Clark to pieces before they'd let him
reach the door. But George Clark
walked, n<~>t out the main entrance, but
out again to the anteroom, where he
Blood, his heart thrust forward turtle
wise, his eyea Minking In the sun and
his triangular eyebrows elevated as
they are when he's particularly un
turppy. There he was arrested for the
third time, and again the proceedings
began. The document accusing George
Clark of willfully, feloniously, mali
ciously and unlawfully killing his
brother was read and the prisoner sank
back into his chair between the Sheriff
and Deputy RednaJl.
Every attitude this man takes Is In
dicative of weakness, mental and phys
ical. He doesn't sit or walk or talk
like a man. â¢ He did not raise his eyes
when Mrs. Clark entered, and she
didn't look toward him.
The examination of Mrs. Clark by
District Attorney Bell did not proceed
smoothly. It was continually breaking
upon the rocks of Attorney Hogan's
objections, of which, by the way. Mr.
Hopan must have quite a collection al
ready. Mr. Hogan is a very emphatic
man and there were several times dur
ing the day when he and District At
torney Bell found it necessary to dis
agree, and that vigorously and decided
ly. Mr. Hogan objected once to the in
troduction of testimony on the ground
that it wasn't proper.
"This thing isn't decent," he ex
claimed.
"Did you just find it out?" asked the
District Attorney, "and since when are
you an expert?"
The ruling was against Mr. H^pan,
as It was every time but once, on which
occasion (."lark's attorney sarcastically
thanked Justice Chirm. and the law
yers said: "All right; we'll take an
other < xception."
"Without the emphasis, then," said
Justice Chirm, and indeed Mr. Hogan
has a facetious way <.f using the word
"Another "
There was a battle about admitting
the evidence that Mrs. Clark had been
(unstrained in continuing her relations
â with the murderer of late years. Dis
trict Attorney Bell made an excellent
little speech, insisting upon the point
that in the woman's resistance the
greatest motive for the crime was
shown. AVhen he finished the crowd
burst into loud applause, stamping and
shouting. There could be no question
about the feelings of St. Helenans.
They enjoyed every point made against
th.; man whose crime brought their
town into such unpleasant promi
nence. A wave of Marshal Johnson's
hand quieted the throng, but it did not
soothe Attorney Hogan's temper. He
jumped to his feet, and, facing the
crowd, declared pugnaciously: "To the
gentlemen who use their feet more
than their heads, I want to say that I
am going to stay right here. I'm
only asking for justice for this man,
and justice we shall have. Who knows
but this woman is as guilty as this
man? Why should the District Attor
ney screen her? Who knows that she
is not at least an accomplice? God
alone can judge between these two."
To which Justice Chirm quietly made
answer: "No. I've exclusive jurisdic
tion in this case."
Attorney Hogan, when he wants to
annoy his opponent, intimates that the
District Attorney is guilty of extreme
youth. But Mr. Bell is of the sort that
grows quiet with excitement or anger.
"Well." exclaimed Mr. Hogan once
during the examination, "that question
ought to he printed and framed. It's
obscure. I esftt understand it."
"Perhaps," said the District Attor
ney, "it might be interpreted to you by
some man of intelligence."
"Get at what you want to ask," be
gan Clark's attorney.
"I'll ask my own questions," de
clared Mr. BelL I'll run this to suit
myself."
"No, you won't," retorted Mr. Ho
prar). and then ho continued in an em
phatic speech to assert Clark's right to
a fair trial. "This man is as innocent
as I am." hÂ« said, and before he could
finish his sentence, "in the eyes of the
law," there was a "whoop" from the
crowd that made Mr. Hogan deliver
another address to the people.
"Well, we'll see," said the prosecu
tion.
But all this sparring and quibbling
of the attorneys has behind it a serious
Intent. Attorney Hogan, when he
cross-examined Mrs. Clark, dwelt
upon the fact that this woman has re
peatedly told George Clark that under
certain circumstances she would marry
him. Mrs. Clark insists that since
George Clark came back from the East
she has replied "No" to a similar ques
tion. But the murderer insists that
her answer has ever been the same.
This woman knew, too, the thought
that was in George Clark's mind. The
way that she has influenced him Is too
intangible a thing, probably, for the
law to put a finger upon, hut in St.
Helena's eyes she is as guilty, morally,
as the man, who, many declare, was
only her tool.
The District Attorney has nine wit
nesses to examine to-morrow. Of
these, however, only one is of impor
tance in relation to the case, and that
is George Dax, the small, sleek haired,
stuttering pon-in-law of Mrs. Clark.
Her daughters. Bertha and Lillie. pale
faced, rather awkward girls, with hair
of an undecided blonde, are also wit
nesses in the case. Dr. Osborne, on
whose place George Clark worked and
lived: Dr. McCurdy, Peter Yorke and
the Marshal and Constable, complete
the list. Both prosecution and defense
are anxious to conclude the case, and
the chance 3 are that by Friday even
ing Clark will be on his way back to
tho Xapa jail, there to stay till his trial
shall take place.
A rumor that Mrs. Clark had con
fessed that she was the originator of
the scheme to poison hor husband, and
when that failed to shoot him, startled
the valley this evening. Mrs. Clark
denied positively on the witness stand
to-day that she was aware of George
Clark's purpose, and no confirmation
of the rumor can be obtained in St.
Helena to-night. That Mrs. Clark con
sulted District Attorney Bell as to the
advisability of engaging counsel for
herself shows that she is not unaware
of the thought that is uppermost In
people's minds just now.
To-night Mrs. Clark denied positive
ly the story as to a confession made
by her that hers was the mind that
planned the death of William Clark.
her husband.
"I haven't made a confession," she
said. "I've nothing to confess. I'm
innocent of that, and I've toid all 1
know."
WITHOUT TRACE OF SHAME
MRS. CLARK RELATES
HER STORY OF CRIME.
Transcript of the Evidence That Drew the
Crowd to the Little Room Where
Court Was Held.
ST. HELENA. Jan. 27.â Mrs. W. A.
Clark was the one witness of the day.
Her testimony was not different from
that at the inquest, except it ehowed
In more detail the relations existing
between herself and the murderer. She
did not manifest the least trace of
shame, nor seem to realize that she
was in a position suggestive of em
barrassment. Mrs. Clark went on the
stand at 10:45. Her examination was
not over until court adjourned. While
the direct statements of the woman
were of Interest, it was on cross-exami
nation that details such as caused the
crowd to strain its ears so as not to
lose a word were dragged from her. Her
testimony, divested of verbiage, reptl
tion, and with the prolix legal argu
ments which marked It eliminated, was
as follows:
She gave her name as Lovlna Clark,
aged 46, married to William Anderson
Clark in Illinios twenty-one years ago.
Of seven children, the oldest was married
to Mr. Dax.

between 5 and half-past 5.
Q.â What was the occasion of your get
ting up at that time? A.â l beard â 
groaning noise; I thought it was my hus
band; I thought he had the nightman
and I called to him and he did not answer
me. and I rose up in bed and looked out
at the door through into the kitchen, that
is under the door, and I saw a light un
der the door and I knew then that it was
my husband and that he was up.

to him and looked down at him.
Q.â Well, what was his condition? He
was lying perfectly straightened out. Just
lying' on his back with his head turned
over a little to one side.
Q.â Well, what did you then do? A.â l
ran and called my son-in-law. George
Dax. We all ran back to my husband,
and I think we all got to him about the
same time, and George Dax turned my
husband over.
Q â Did you speak to him after you had
called your son-in-law? A.â Yes. Fir. I
said, "6, Will, speak to me." He made
no response.
q âNow, what next was done with your
husband after you all got in there to him.
after you had called your son-in-law?
A.â We picked him up and carried him
into the other room and laid him on the
lounge.
q âMrs. Clark, do you know the defend
ant, George W. Clark. A.â Yes, sir.
q._ How long have you known him?
A.â Since we were boys and girls to-
gether.
Q.â Do you know his age? A.â Yes, sir;
37 years old.
Q.â How old was he when you first be
came acquainted with him? A.â About six
W'-eks Old.
Q.â At the time that you were married
to William Anderson ("lark, where did the
defendant live? A.â Wayne County. Illi
nois. We lived pretty close together,
probably a mile and a half or two miles
apart.
Q. â With respect to your home, where
did this defendant live from the time you
first knew him up to the time of your
marriage to W. A. Clark? A.â He lived
In Wayne County and I lived in Clay
County.
Q.â Now, after you moved to Clay Coun
ty, during the years that you lived there
and he still lived in Wayne County, did
the defendant visit you at your home?
A.â Yes, sir; probably every two or three
weeks.
Q.â And how long would he remain? A.â
Over night sometimes, and sometimes
through the day.
Q.â At any time after that did the de
fendant take up his home at the resi
dence of yourself and husband? A.â Yes,
sir.
Q.â When, and how long after your
marriage with W. A. Clark? A.â lt was
probably six or seven ye"ars. Then he
came and lived with us.
Q.â When did you come to California?
A.â l think about eleven years ago, as
near as I can remember.
Q.â Who came with you? A. â George
Clark and four children.
Q.â Did your husband come to California
at that time? A.â No, sir; he came in
April of one year and we came, George
Clark and the four children and I, in
August of that year.
Q.â How long had you been married at
the time of your removing to California?
A. â I think nine years.
Q.â Mrs. Clark, at the time that you
came to California with George Clark and
the children, what were your relations
with the defendant?
Mr. Hogan (one of the attorneys for
the defendant)â Now, your Honor, we ob
ject to that; this woman is not charged
with having committed any crime, or any
offense. And I further ask that this court
instruct this witness that she has a right
to refuse to answer any question that will
tend to criminate herself. The witness
does not have to answer any question
that would have a tendency to convict
her of any offense.
Mr. Bell (District Attorney)â ln regard
to the objection, it certainly Is material
because we propose to follow it up by
showing, as I have already intimated
that the relation that existed between
this woman and George Clark was the
motive that prompted the commission of
this crime. The defendant stands here
accused of the murder of his own brother
and there must have been some powerful
motive that prompted this man to kill his
own brother; and for that purpose wo
think it is material, we think it will show
the motive of the crimeâ these relations
that have existed for so many years and
for that reason we ask that the question
be allowed.
The courtâ Do you wish to answer the
questions, Mrs. Clark, or do you wish to
claim your right to refuse- to answer them
âor do you wish to take your privilege on
the ground that it might tend to crimi
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JAXUABT 28, IS9B.
JUSTICE CHINN.
nate you? A.â l want to do what's for my
bestâ l don't know.
- Mr. Bell â Do you wish to answer this
question and tell what you know about
this matter, Mrs. Clark? A. â Of course.
It's very painful for me to go over my
past life.
Q. â The question is: Now, do you wish
to claim your privilege in this matter?
A. â Everybody knows it. so I guess 1 may
as well tell. well, we were intimate.
Q. â Were you Intimate with the defend
ant for the period of a year or two prior
to your coming to California? A.â Yes.
sir.
Q.â During that year. or two years did
that illicit relation exist between you and
George Clark? A. â Yes, sir.
Q. â How long, if at all. after removing
to California, did this relation exist be
tween you and George Clark? A.â Do you
mean willingly?
Q.â Well, I will qualify it to that. Will
ingly on your part? A. Until the last
five or six years, or seven.
Q. â Well, how long did it continue with
your consent? A.â For the last six or
seven years.
Q. â Has that relation continued at all
during the last six or seven years? A.â
Sometimes.
Q.â You have stated that there has
been at times an improper relation be
tween you and George Clark In the last
six or seven years? A.â l have; yes, sir;
that's so.
At this point considerable time was
consumed in endeavoring to induce the
witness to tell of the exact relations sus
tained by George Clark and herself dur
ing the last year, but with poor success.
She evaded the questions with sx.me skill.
and where she acknowledged the fact,
placed all the blame or. the defendant,
charging him with coercion. Much she
did acknowledge was of a character not
to be printed.
Q.â Did you have any talk with George
Clark relative to your husband or rela
tive to the breaking off of this relation?
A.â Yes. si.-. I would plead with him and
tell him it was not right, and tell him
that I knew it wasn't right, and that
I wanted to live a better life and do what
was right.
Qâ Well, what was said in reference to
your husband? A.â l don't remember
whether I would always. but I know that
I most always would tell htm that I was
the wife of another man, and that I knew
it wasn't right, and that I intended to live
a better life.
Here it was sought to establish the
time at which George dark's advances
had been finally rejected, and whether
or not since that date, which the
woman declined to fix precisely, there
had been questionable relations man
ifest on his part. The witness left no
doubt as to her intentions, and de
scribed how she had pleaded with
Clark to lead a better life and permit
her to do so. She had sometimes been
obliged to call some member of the
family in for protection.
Q.â Do yon know whether nr not any
thing was said by you or by the defendant
at the time the last overtun s were made
by him to you about your husband? A.â l
don't think his name was mentioned.
Q-â Had this defendant, George Clark,
at any time during the lust year said
anything to you in regard to your ever
becoming his wife? A.â Yes, sir: he did.
Q.â Has he said anything of that char
acter to yÂ«.u during the last year, more
than once? A.â Yes, sir; several times
be has said something to that effect.
Q.â How long has it been, if you remem
ber, .-ince he first spoke to you about that
matt.-r. A.â l can't say whether he said
anything about that before we came to
California or not. Positively I could not
Q.â Do you know whether or not any
reference was made to your husband at
that time? Anything he said? A.â No, I
don't.
Q.â At any time since you moved Into
the Piitchard house has he made any
mention to you about this same matter?
A.â YeÂ», sir; he has probably every month
on an average. . ..
Q.â Now, what did he say? A.â Well he
would ask me if I would be his wife if
things were so we couNT.
' Q.â What did you Fay to him in response
to that question? A.â "Yes."
Q.â You said "yes"? Yes. sir; I said
"yes"; and I would tell him^iot to talk
about such things, it was nor right, ami
he would insist that I ought to give him
an answer, and to get rid of him I would
say "yes."
â Now, was your husband's name
mentioned during all of these conversa
tions you had with him about marriage?
â Yes, sir; sometimes, but not often.
Q.â Well, what was said about him?
A.â He said that "if Will was out of the
way would you marry meâ if anything
was to happen and we were in a condi
tion, that we could?"
State fully, Mrs. Clark, what he
would say about your husband. A. â That
would be about all that he would say. .
Have you ever had any conversa
tions of the kind with the defendant
since you moved to the house on the cor
ner of Railroad avenue and Pine street?
A.â No, sir; well, only when we were
talking about the strychnine that time.
Q.â What war. said when you were talk
ing, about that strychnine? A.â He came
up to the house and we were standing on
the porch and ho spoke something about
the people accusing him. of being the one
who had administered the strychnine, and
I says to him. "Why does this worry
you? They first accused me, and . I
know I am clear before my God, and it
don't worry me." "Well," says he, "now
I am innocent and It don't worry me
neither." He says. "What do you sup
pose would be my motive for it?" I says.
"Well, there has been two or three told
me that you was in love with me and
that you was going to get Will out of
the way." And he says to me, "Do you
think that I would do such a thing as
that?" And I says. "No. George, 1 don't
believe that you are that mean, and you
know positively that if He was to die or
if anything happened to him you could
not get me. for I would run to the ends of
the earth until I found the one that was
guilty of killing my husband and prose
cute him to the extent of the law." And
he says, "I know I am innocent."
Now Just prior to his going East,
did you have any conversation with him
with relation to your marrying him?
A.â Yes, sir; the night before he started
he asked me the same question. Bays
he: "It things were in such a condition
that you and I could get married, would
you- have me?" I told -him: "George,
don't talk that way to me about that. I
won't answer you any such questions
you know it is wrong." And he kept on
begging and pleading, and he said: "Just
answer me this time." and I said "Yes "
and I told him afterward . that lie had
wrung the answer out of me.
Q. â How long was he gone East? -A.â
Just one month, I- believe. ' â¢â¢â  <â  '
Now, since his return from the
East, have you had any further conver
sations in that particular? A. â Yes, sir.
He asked me if 1 would still have him if
things were so. we " could. marry, . and
I said "no." I said it was wrong to talk
that way and to have any such a thing
on my mind, and I wanted it entirely I
gone, and I said: "You have ao.ed so '
Deu with me, George, that I have not !
any love for you any more."
Q At any time since he returned from
the East baa he made any improper ad- ,
vances toward you? A.â To the best of
my knowledge. I think the last time was
after he came from the East.
Cross-examination. Henry Hogan (at- '<
toroey tor defendant)â Mrs. Clark, wh.-n
the conversation occurred last, the last
one that you have testified to, where you
Bald to this defendant, "You have acted
â O mean that I have no love for you any
more," about what time was that in ref- :
< erence to the time' of your finding your
husband dead in his house, about what ,
, day â how long previous to that time?
A.â Oh, I can't tell you; I know it was
just before he started East.
Q. â Was there any conversation ever
occurred between you and this defendant
after that time in reference to your love
for him or his love for you? A.â Well.
I .lout just remember; the one that I
told you about when we were talking
there on the porch.
Q. â And that conversation was after the.
conversation that occurred the night be- !
I fore hÂ»- went East. You say you have j
; had conversations with him since he re- j
turned from the East? A.â Yes, sir; the i
one I just now told you about, when I i
told him "No."
Q.â Did he evor nt any time Pay he was
going to kill your husband to marry you?
A No, sir.
! 'id h" ever at any time say or in
1 timate to you that he intended either to !
poison him <t shoot him for the purpose
of marrying you? A.â Nothing, but once !
when we were back East he said some- ,
thing to me about marrying him; I don't
know whether It was when we were East,
or after we came out from the East, but
it has been a long time ago.
Q.â That was in the East" A.â l won't '
pay whether it was In the East or after
ire came out here. It has been a long j
time ago, and he said that "I was going
to get him out of the way."
Qâ After that he became the father of i
some of your children, did he not? A.â i
; Yes. sir.
Here followed a recital of common
places, the woman's history, the time I
she taikfrht school *n Illinois, the ewnt
of her marriage, the old days on th-- '
Wayne County farm, the birth of her
various children, the occasional meet- '
Ings with the defendant. Interest was
revived by ;i new line of interroga
tories.
Q.â When was the first time. If you re
member, that there was established in
your heart any love for George Clark?
I A.â l cant tt 11 you that; I always loved '

brother from the time I knew him.
Q- â You loved him first when you saw
him as your pupil? A. â Yes, sir.
Q-â lf you ioved him why did you marry
hi.s brother? A.â l did not love him to I
marry him: I just loved him as a scholar; I
I had no thoughts of any such thing as 'â 
marrying him.
Q.â Did you love him aftorwnrd nny
different from that for a scholar? A.â l
did.
Q.â Wh<T.> was the first time that the
relationship that you say existed between
you and George Clark, where was that
consummated, In the East or here. A.â |
East.
A.â Was your husband aware of the
relationship that existed between your
self and his brother? A.â l don't know.
Q.â Previous to your husband's leaving
for California had the relationship that
you said existed between yourself and
Qeorge Clark existed? A.â Oh, nearly two
years.
Q. â When he came here he left you and
George Clark and the children there and
at that time was he aware of the fact?
A.â l don't know; he never said anything
to me.
Q. â Did he ever complain about any af
fection that yuu bestowed upon George? j
A. â Not to my recollection.
Q.â Did he act as though he knew that i
there was ever anything going on? A. â
No. sir; if be thought anything he kept*lt
to hims.if; i used to think that he kind of
watched us. but he never said anything.

He never said anything, only after the
child was botlL
Q.â Did you tell George anything about
that? A. -I don't remember if I did; all
that my husband said, he said something !
to me about people that talked or said
something. "Well, if I don't care," he
says. "I think they had better keep their
mouths shut." That is all that was said
between him and me on the subject at
that time.
Q.â That is, your husband told you If
he didn't care he didn't think It was any
body else's business? A.â Yes. sir.
Q- â Well, did not he know of your conÂ«
dition when you arrived here? A.â Could
not help It.
Q â He didn't ask any questions relative
to it? A.â No. sir.
Q.â Did you say anything to George
Clark relative to the fact of your hus

dition when you returned from the Eastâ
the older ones? A. â Yes. sir.

Helena, and after the birth of this child,

you or George In your presence as to the
manner of life that you were living? A.â
No, sir.
Q~ ln st - Helena, after you came here,

don't know; he never said anything to
me about it.
Q.â He never at any time objected to
the fact that you had borne children by
his brother and that he was suporting
them? a.â No. sir.
Q.â How is it. then, that W. A. Clark
told George C.ark to leave home over j
here on Railroad avenue and Pine street, j
A. â It was because he caused so much j
trouble in the house. He was always '
quarreling and grumbling and finding 'â 
fault. My husband would take It up and .
they would all have it, but It was noth
ing concerning George and I.
Q.â When was it that George left and
went to work for Dr. Osborm-; went away
from your home and your husband's:
how long ago? A.â Well, that was two
or three years ago.
Q.â Did he visit your house in the mean
time? A.â Yes. sir: he 1 would come quite
frequently to the house; when he was
working through the day. Sometime he
would come in the evening, and sometime
through the day.
Q.â Did your daughter ever say any
thing to you in reference to your rela
tionship with George Clark, and that it
ought to be broken up? A. â No, sir.

found in the kitchen where you found

Q.â Now. previous to the 20th day of
January, IS9S, had there been any con
versation between yourself and George
Clark relative to the fact that -ie wanted
to marry you? A.â Why, several days
before.
Q.â What did he say to you? A.â We
were standing on the porch and what he
said to me I have heretofore repeated.
Q. â On the morning that he was mur
dered, did you hear him build the fire?
A.â No. sir.
Q.â Did you hear him draw the water
to put in the kettle on the stove? A.â
No. sir.
Q.â Did you hear him go out of the
room at all that morning? A.â No, sir: I
did not.
Q.â What was the first thing that at
tracted your attention on that morning,
the morning that you found your husband
in the kitchen lying on the floor? A.â
Those groans.
Here was recited again the story of
the discovery of the murdered man,
there being no notable variation of the
account given on direct examination.
The witness went without emotion
over the scene. Then the lawyer shift
ed the line of questions to a new chan
nel.
Q. â Where did your husband usually
eat his noonday meals? A.â Well, that is
hard for me to tell; he took his lunch
along with him and ate out on the rail
road somewhere.
Q.â Who prepared his lunch? A.â He did
himself; I would cook it through the day
and then he would put it up himself.
Q.â What would he take for his lunch?
A.â Fruit, bread ami butter, potatoes, cof
fee; such things as that.
Q. â When was his lunch usually pre
pared? A.â l think that he put it up in
the morning; he did for a while put it up
at night; come to the tabU- and take
things off; but after a while he got into
the habit of putting it up in the morning.
Q. â Didn't you ever have anything to
do with either his lunch can or his lunch
at all? A*â No, sir; I never have sin.<
we have been living over there where we
were at the time he was killed.
Â§.. â Did he ever ask you to? A.â No, sir.
. â Well, wouldn't it be natural for his
wife to prepare his lunch for him some
times? A.â He said he always knew just
what he wanted: but sometimes my
daughters used to get up and make bis
cuits for him, but he would always pre
pare his own lunch.
Q. â Did you ever see George Clark pre
pare his lunch for him? A.â No. sir.
Q. â How would he carry his coffee? A. â
He had a rubber bottle that he carried it
in first.
Q.â Did you hear a shot there that
morning? A.â T did not.
Q. â Are you as positive of the fact that
you did not hear a shot fired that morn
ing as you are of the testimony that you
have piven here? A. â I am most as posi
tive. I didn't hear no shot; If I did I
wasn't awake enough to realize that it
was a shot.
Q. â Had you over seen the pistol before
some one handed it to you there at the
house after the City Marshal came and
picked it up? A.â No, sir; not that 1
know of.
Q. â You have expressed considerable
feeling of hostility ueralrist this defend
ant here, have you not? A.â l have.
Q. â Have you a feeling against him?
A.â l don't know that I have anything
particular: of course I think he has done
a terrible wicked act to do such a thing.
Q.â You have a feeling against htm
now in your testimony, have you not?
A. âl think anybody that would do such
a thing as that ought to be convicted.
Q.â l asked yuu whether you have ex
pressed a foe-ling against him? A.â Why.
of course, if he is the guilty party that
committed the deed he ought to be con
victed.
Q.â How much do you weigh? A.â 2o<l
pounds.
Q. â Mrs. Clark, in any of the conversa
tions that occurred between yourself and
any of these officers has there been any
inducement held out to you by any one
In reference to your own position in this
case as far as "your testimony was con
cerned? A.â No. sir: there has been no
inducement. Only they all told me to tell
the truth about everything, to come
straight out and tell the truth, and that
is what I have done.
The prisoner, Clark, arrived here at
6:45 this evening, after a wholly un
eventful trip, and was glad to be safe
in jail. He expressed no fear of vio
lence.

WILL ENLARGE THE
WATER TOWN ARSENAL.
BOSTON. Jan. 27.â Extensive improve
ments at the "United States arsenal at
"Watertown are being- considered by the
government. This arsenal is the largest
pun carriage plant in the world, and is
worked to it 3 fullest capacity. The im
provements contemplate the expenditure
of more than $165,000. It is the opinion ot
army officials that the establishment
should be made double the present size,
and that there should be as much shop
room and as many tools in reserve, so in
case of an emergency double the quantity
of work c>uld be completed. It is pro
posed to erect a new magazine for stor
age purposes near the east end of the
grounds at an expense of $15,000, a new
set of quarters for the sergeants, to cost
WOO, to remodel the present officers'
quarters into a hospital building ami to
construct three sets of officers' quarters
at an expense of $52,000.
The business for the arsenal, says Gen
eral Flaglor, cannot be carried on in the
present offices. More room is imperatively
demanded.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.â The gold re

the body is shown in the decline of power

must stop the waste, you must stop the loss.
Losses, drains, weakness, blues lead to greater

"Valuable CÂ«rgo Lost and the Big

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOSEPH, Mich.. Jan. 27.â The big
grain steamer City of Duluth arrived
off this port from South Chicago last
night at 8:30 o'clock, and attempted to
enter the harbor during a tremendous
wind from the northwest and while a
very heavy sea was rolling. The steam
er kept on her course, but at the mouth
of the river struck a bar, and was
thrown heavily against the North pier,
breaking in two immediately.
The mammoth steel arches on either
side of the boat gave way, and the bow
rrf thf boat dropped two or three feet.
A large hole was stove in the side of
the steamer as she swung around, and
she went to the bottom in an hour,
leaving only her cabin and part of her
bulwarks above water.
The two big tupp, Morford and Pro
tection, which had accompanied the
boat on her trip acn?ss the lake, made
raJ desperate attempts to reach her
and pet the crev and passengers off,
but were unsuccessful. The life-saving
crew was summoned and reached the
scene of the disaster in quick time, con
sidering that they had disbanded for
th.- winter. At midnight they had shot
a mortar line to the boat and the res
cue began.
The first to be taken ashore was Au
pust Kornwein, a business man of this
city. He dipped into the water several
times during the perilous trip, and was
badly frozen when he was pulled c/ut
on the pier. The rest of the passengers
were taken ashore in this manner, one
at a time. There were seventeen pas-
Ft-'npsrs and twenty-three of the crew.
Captain McLean was the last to leave,
being taken off at 5 o'clock this morn
ing.
Th^re were several ladles on board,
find the members Of the life-saving
. rew took turns going out in the car
after them. M-s. William Tryon is
now dying from the effects of the trip.
ShÂ» was in a delicate condition, and
. vas badly frozen. She was seized with
* nervous prostration, and there is no
hope that she will live.
The City of Duluth had a heavy cargo
of corn and flour and a deckload of
merchandise for local merchants. There

Thp engineer pays that when the boat

was immediately torn to pieces. The
water rushed in and put out the fires,
and the firemen barely escaped up the
ladders. The floor of the cabin gave
a mighty heave upward and the pas
sengere were thrown into the wildest
confusi'in.
The City of Duluth was an old but

CLOSE OF THE

Warm Weather Mars the
Final "Work of the
Dogs.
A Few Clever Performances j
and One Clear Case of
Runaway.
The Prize Winners-San Francisco
Pointer Gets Third Place Under
Protest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD. Jan. This was
the warmest day since the inaugura
tion of the field trial meeting, and the
dogs that were ordered down in the
forenoon suffered in consequence. The
contests were opened on new grounds,
but they did not prove any better than
the territory traversed yesterday.
It was 9:15 a. m. when Nimrod,
handled by Allender. met the ranger
Valiente, handled by Walters. When
cast off Valiente cut out a fast pace,
covering much ground and finally dis
appearing from view of his handler.
He never returned. He was on a race I
': to no particular spot on earth and may
! be going yet. The judges gave him half
! an hour in which to return, but the ,
i dog which may prove to be a brilliant
| star on the plains of Nebraska failed !
I to put in an appearance.
The judges ordered the next brace j
down at 9:56 a. m. Luke, handled by !
Couts, and Cuba of Kenwood, handled
by Dodge, were cast oft in a sage coun- j
| try. After traveling half a mile Mr.
r.vle of Bakersfleld flushed a good- ]
sized bevy and the birds scattered on i
nice open ground. Cuba was first to J
locate and point. The bird flushed
wild. Luke roaded several yards and |
pointed. He was nicely backed. Both
steady to shot. Cuba again pointed
and the bird flushed. The quails were
lying close and acting well. The dogs
made several stops on birds that had
moved from their positions, but dis- .
covered their mistakes in good season.
jSo far as points were concerned
the dogs scored about equal. Cuba
flushed two birds, for which an
! excuse could not be offered. Neither of !
i the dogs showed good nose, running
over birds that should have been :
; pointed. Cuba was certainly the most
stylish ranger and better worker. Dogs
i ordered up at 10:55 a. m.
Dona Alicia, handled by Walters, and
â  Peach Mark, handled by Allender, were
! cast off at 11 a. m. Dona proved to be
I a very merry worker, covering ground
! fairly fast, but lacking good bird sense.
I She was first to locate a bevy in a field
j of stubby willow and light cover. The
birds were runners, and the little bitch
roaded them several yards. In the
i meantime. Peach Mark pointed, and
1 Dona, rounding to- a turn, backed beau
; tifully. Both dogs were steady to shot.
Dona again drew on point, but the bird ,
flushed. The handlers then passed from :
the field into higher ground, where
scattered birds were found. Peach
; came to a steady point. The bird was
l shot by Allender and retrieved quick
ly. The dog was steady to shot. Re
turning to the ground where the birds
were found, Dona came to a pretty
point, dropping on her stomach. She '
was nicely backed by Peach. Both
â  steady to shot. Dona, after roading
some yards, pointed falsely. Passing
over a mound. Dona roaded and point
! Ed, and Peach ran in and flushed, for
which he was chastised by his handler.
| Peach, ranging out into the field, point
led beautifully, and was handsomely
â  backed. Allender shot and killed.
; Peach retrieved quickly. Dogs ordered
] up at 12 o'clock. I â¢ . ' ,
: After luncheon the great Dash An
! tonia, handled by Couts, and Alex C,
the young and dashing Derby winner,
handled by Lucas, were cast off at 1
p. m. Dash quartered and ranged over
considerable territory in a short space 1
ol time. His beautiful stride and hand
some appearance when in motion were
much admired, but Dash paid not the
least attention to his handler, and
i whistle as the latter may. Dash kept
on going until he ranged out of sight.
As he did not return in good season
Nimrod was ordered down with Alex
<". at 2 p. m. After forty minutes of
hunting, birds were found on high
! ground, where the sagebrush was low
and thick.
Both dogs showed poor nose, but con
, sidering the heat of the day and the
exceedingly dry nature of the soil., some
excuse was due to them for their poor
behavior. Passing into lower land.
j where Luke scored several easy points
i on the previous morning, Nimrod came
; to a stanch point on a bevy and was
stylishly backed. The birds were run
ning and Rod broke and roaded slowly.
The pointer rushed, passed him and
i came to a grand stand, Nimrod back
1 , ing in good style. Both dogs now
started to road, and finally they pointed i
i side by side on birds that were hiding
'. in a dry ditch. It was a very pretty
. picture as setter and pointer stood al
most touching each other.
1 The dogs were -next ordered by their
' ! handlers Into a field covered with low
j sagebrush. After working it carefully
for considerable time they were or
dered up at 3:35 o'clock. Alex C was
â¢ I down two hours and 35 minutes. He
' ' had the hardest work of any dog in
I the trial and was invariably cast off in
' the heat of the day, but his beautiful
â  style in the field combined with his fast
. j ranging ability and good bird sense re
! turned him numerous admirers. In fact,
he was selected by many who had no
interest in the dogs for competing for
first or second money. . â¢*â :-/
Cuba of Kenwood and Peach Mark
were the next and the last brace cast
I off. They located birds after a long
[ run, and although they had the cover
| of evening their work was of the most
ordinary kind. They were on birds riot
more than ten minues when the Judges
ordered them up. resulting in the finish
of the trials of 1898.
On returning to Bakersfleld the
judges consulted and decided on giving
Peach Mark, now the property of Em
met Sullivan, first prize: Cuba of Ken
wood, the property of Mr. Tevis of Ba- '
kersfield, second prize, and Luke, the
property of C. Young of San Francisco,
third prize. Three out of every five
people who witnessed the trials said
that Luke should not be placed ahead
of Alex C.__ - -

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1898.
LOS ANGELES'
DELIVERANCE
IS IN SIGHT
People Will Win the
Great Water
Fight.
Under the Pressure the
City Council Is Begin
ning to Weaken.
Passes a Resolution to Investi
gate the Mountain Water
Source.
MONOPOLY TO BE BROKEN
If the Company Refuses to Arbitrate
Then a New System Will
BÂ» Constructed.
Special DUpatch to ThÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27.â Seldom has
a sharp and vigorous newspaper fight,
such as The Call has waged in behalf
of the people of Los Angeles against
the water company and its hydra
headed syndicated press, been product
ive of such great results. Less than
two weeks ago the people of this city
lay helpless in the grasp of the mo
nopoly. There were gloom and discour
agement in the ranks of the fighters
for the people's rights, while the syn
dicated press carried out the orders of
its masters and pursued a policy of si
lence.
To-day there is hope in every heart,
and as a result of the fight waged by
The Call there is a bright prospect
ahead of deliverance from the clutch
of the corporation. So great has been
the pressure that there are visible signs
of weakening in the City Council, and
in at least one of the combined news
papers. The first victory was the pass
age of the resolution providing for a
committee to investigate and report on
a mountain source of water supply.
It now looks as if a greater victory
will be achieved at next Monday's
meeting of the City Council. On that
day a resolution will be introduced giv
ing due and legal notice to the water
company of the city's desire to arbi
trate the price of the plant in accord
ance with the contract. The city will
appoint the arbitrator and call upon
the water company to do likewise.
There are indications to-day that Ash
man and Mathus will certainly sup
port such a resolution, while the friends
of Blanchard of the Ninth Ward say he
can be depended on to fall in on the
side of the people.
These three votes with Grlder and
Hutchison, the original fighters against
the water company, will pass the reso
lution. If the company follows its
usual course and pays no attention to
the offer of ihe city to arbitrate then
an election will be at once called to
vote bonds for the construction of an
entirely new system, independent of the
old plant, and the contract with th*Â»
company will be declared void. This
will bring the water question to a
head right speedily, and will place the
final settlement of it in the hands of
the people.
The mass meeting called for Satur
day night at Music Hal! bids fair to be
a rousing one. The people are eager to
gain full information about the water
question, and are seeking all sources
of knowledge. It is intended at the
meeting of Saturday night to perfect
an organization to battle on the side
of the people. It will be in th*^ form
of a committee composed of representa
tive men who will organize th.- people
by wards into committees of public
safety. Heretofore all the organiza
tion, all the money, and all the di
plomacy have been on the side of the
water company. The people now in
tend to do a little organizing on their
own account. The best of speakers will
be in attendance at the meeting Sat
urday night, and many of the repre
sentative men of the trrwn will act as
vice-presidents and occupy seats on the
statre.
The most notable effect of this fight
is the total lack of confidence expressed
by the people in the three syndicated
dailies. They are wild with rage and
frothing at the mouth at having been
detected in their dastardly attempt to
betray the people.
A vote of the town shows thqt 90
per cent of the people sustain th May
or's position and favor municip i own
ership of the water plant, while only 10
per cent uphold the policy of delay
which has ruled a majority of the City
Council.
TO SOON SPAN

Vanderbilt Lines Preparing to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 2S.â According to the
Press this morning Vanderbilt lines are to
span the continent, and San Francisco Is
to be brought a day nearer to New York.
The paper pays: "William K. Vanderbilt

FROST IN THE
CITRUS BELT
Coldest Snap in South
ern California for
Years.
i â __â â
Considerable Damage Is Done
to Orange and Lemon
Crops.
Gentle Rain Now Falling in Some
Sections, With Indications of
Its Contin nance.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 27.â The past
two nights have been the coldest ex
perienced in Southern California for
years. In pome localities the mercury
; dropped to 25 degrees, and in low places
!it even went to 20 degrees. There is
no doubt but furious injury was done
to citrus fruits, and in some Instances
young trees were killed to the ground.
This latter is especially true of young ,
lemon trees. The freeze did not re- !
suit in great loss, as oranges in low
pbtoea had been pretty generally pick
ed and shipped. On high foot-hill
ground the oranges were not injured. â¢
and a large proportion of the groves ;
here are planted on high ground. A
gentle rain is now falling with indica
tions that it will continue for some j
I days.
RIVERSIDE. Jan. 27. â The past week
| has been a cold one in this part of the
i State, and the visit of frost has done
some damage to citrus fruits in the ;
j more exposed portions of this valley.
j Just what this damage amounts to it
: would be hard to estimate, but a care- J
; ful canvass among the fruit growers
: and shippers would indicate that the
i loss was probably not more than 5 per ;
cent of the crop. Riverside was par
ticularly favored in this last cold spell
i by the prevalent south winds, which
prevented the thermometer from fall
ing much lower than it did. Tuesday
night was the coldest for the week, and
then the glass ranged from 30 degrees
; in favored places down as low as 24 in
exposed points.
One thing that beyond doubt saved
I the fruit was a change in the wind
i about 2 n. m.. which brought up a
! heavy lot of clouds. Since Tuesday
â  night the mid has moderated and all
danger of further trouble seems past.
The past two months have been cold
all over this part of the State, fruit has
' been damaged everywhere and River-
Bide has n<a escaped. Good judges of
the conditions of things estimate the
total damage to the orange crop here
at from S to IT, per cent, most of which
occurred in the lowlands.
SAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 27.â The
thermometer reached the lowest point
for the season last night throughout
the valley, and. if all reports that
reached the city to-day are true, the
frost was heavier than it was two
years ago. E. J. Underwood, who rep
resents the Haight Fruit Company at
Riverside, is responsible for the state
ment that not an orchard in that col
i ony escaped. The mercury registered
23 degrees in the orchards while the
smudging was going on.
Special reports ma<le to the Horti
cultural Commission state that the
more elevated groves at Highlands
were only slightly injured, while the
fruit and the trees on the lower slopes
of the town were damped 80 p>t cent.
Special reports from Rialto place the
damage to the navel oranges in that
, vicinity at 5 per cent, while the other
varieties suffered more.
Prior to last night the fruit at Colton
was not thought to be damaged more
than 2 per cent, but a considerable
quantity was injured last night. It is
feared that many of the small trees
are extensively damaged, but the
larger trees have in most instances es
caped. The most conservative men do
not estimate the loss of the orange and
lemon crop above 25 per cent, but state
ments have been freely made on the
streets that half the crop is frozen,
lIKDLANDH, Jan. L'T.â That the
oranges In Redlands suffered from the
drop in the temperature of this morn
ing there can be no doubt, but to what
extent it is hard to say. The early part
of the night and up to 3 o'clock the
thermometer did not register lower
than about 32 to 24, but from 3 until
about 7 the temperature ranged some
what lower, readings ranging from 24
to 26 and 28. according to locality and
exposure. It is almost safe to say that
the average temperature in Redlands
was about 28 degrees.
As to the amount of fruit injured it
is difficult to say. It is not thought
that navels and seedlings are hurt to
exceed 10 per cent, while the swots
and St. Michael's are damaged not to
exceed 15 per cent. Smudging was done
by some, and it is claimed by thos.>
who smudged that it caused the ther
mometer to raise from 2 to 4 degrees.
Packers are not shipping beyond the
average for this time of the year, and
the growers seem to be confident that
a minimum amount of damage was
done.
At the present writing it is trying
hard to rain, and the Indications are
that by morning a long-sought rain
j will be on hand.

Call Office, Tliggs House,
Washington, Jan. 27.
The Treasury Department will soon
Issue the regulations governing the
transportation of Canadian goods for
the Klondike through American ter
ritory. These regulations will be as
liberal to Canadians as the regulations
of Canada are to the men of this coun
try who pass through Canadian terri
tory.
The regulations will prescribe two
ways of taking goods In bond through
American territory. One will be the
payment of duties on the goods at the
port of entrance, either Dyea or Ska
guay. Upon the payment of the du
ties a certificate will be given. If the
goods pass inspection at the place of
exit, near Lake L,inderman, the cer
tificate can be returned to the port- of
entrance and the money will be re
funded. Another way will be the fur
nishing of a bond. The goods will then
be accompanied by a manifest. If they
are untouched when examined at the
place of entrance into Canadian terri
tory, the bond will be canceled. It is
said that several surety companies are
now forming, at convenient places.
The treasury officials have not been
officially informed that there is extens
ive or formidable protest from Cana
dians over the present arrangements
for the transportation of goods. The
Chamber of Commerce at Vancouver is
agitated upon the subject. As the mat
ter stands now, a deputy collector ac
companies the goods of Canadians
through American territory, and
charges them J6 a day for his services.
Canadians object to this as exorbitant,
and want it stopped. A cry is going
up from Vancouver to close the passes
of Canadian territory t<> Americans.
Tt is thought that tho treasury regu
lations f>n the subject of bonds for
goods going through American terri
tory will be as lenient as possible. The
collector at Dyea will he allowed to use
considerable discretion in the matter
of the kind of bonds he may take.
OVERCOME BY THE
HOSTILE CRITICISM.
Ha/fie Erminie Rives, the Young Southern
Author, Removed From the Wal
dorf to a Sanitarium.
NEW YORK. Jan. 27â Hallie Erminie
Rives, the young Southern author and
cousin of Princess Tecbetzkole, formerly
Mrs. Amelie Rives Chanler. is a patient
at a sanitarium in Brooklyn. Unnerved
by hostile criticism of her recent work,
"Smokinr Flax." and overtaxed by the
effort to pet out another volume dealing
with Southern problems, she was re
moved from the Waldorf yesterday and
was taken to a sanitarium for treatment
and rest.
NEW TO-DAY.
The drowning of a woman is a shudder-
some sight. Yet it is swift and compara-
tively painless, and blissful, compared to the
pain and agony suffered for many years by j
many thousands of women. Most of the
suffering endured by women may be traced
to one great, aggravating set of disorders.
The woman who does not take proper care
of the organs distinctly feminine is sure to ;
be sickly, nervous, fretful, and racked with !
pain. She is unfitted for wifehood and
motherhood. Every woman owes it to her-
self to be strong and healthy in a womanly
way. She may insure this if she will use
the proper remedy.
Â»The greatest of all medicines for weak
and suffering women is Dr. Pierces Favor- !
ite Prescription. It acts directly upon the
delicate organs that make wifehood and
motherhood possible. It makes them
healthy and vigorous. It cures all weak-
MM and disease. It allays inflammation, â¢
soothes pain and stops weakening drains.
The nerves become steady, and calm, and
health resumes its natural sway throughout
the system. It prepares for wifehood and
motherhood. Over 90,000 women have tes-
tified to its marvelous virtues and all good
druggists sell it.
Ignorance of her own phvstcal nature is re-
sponsible for a great deal of the pain and suf-
fering that woman undergoes. Dr. Pierce*
Common Sense Medical Adviser is the best ,
medical book for the home. It is now on ,
the bookshelves of over a million American i
households. Several chapters of the book are
devoted to the diseases and weaknesses of the
organs distinctly feminine. Every woman should j
read it. It contains over 1,000 paces. Any one I

" For a long time," said the farmer's -wife. " I suffered from gastric troubles
and dyspepsia. After all my meals I experienced a disagreeable, heavy sort of
feeling and cftenti-nes in the morning civ tongue would be coated ; in fact, this
would be the case for whole days at a time. I had recourse to the whole cate-
gory of correctives, aperients, laxatives, etc., but the relief I found was only
temporary. Indeed, in most cases, after I had taken them for any length of
time, the early efficacy seemed entirely vitiated. I had so often seen in the ad-
vertisements of

NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â The third an- i
nual banquet of the National Assocla
tton of Manufacturers of the United
States, which took place to-night at
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, was one of i
the largest and most elaborate affairs
of the kind ever given in this city. !
One thousand guests were seated at the
tables. The fact that President Mc-
Klnley would be present caused a rush
for tickets.
President McKinley was driven from
the Windsor Hotel, and was received
at the Waldorf-Astoria at 6:30 p. m.
by the committee of merchants, and at
once taken to "the royal chambers."
Half an hour later he appeared in the
reception room, where he held a levee
for mere than an hour.
The banquet hall was magnificently
decorated, the tiers of boxes being
draped with silken banners. The Pres
ident's flag was suspended over the
head of the table from the President's
box. Seven long tables extended the
length of the room, and sixteen small
tables were placed on either side of the
rows of long tables. In the Astor gal
lery annex were thirty-three other ta
bles. Tho tables were elaborately dec
orated with flowers and potted plants.
The dais where the President and oth
er guests sat was also adorned with
many flowers. From the reception
room up the broad staircase to the ban
quet room were lines of palms and
ferns.

Mr. Miller then Introduced Theodore
C. Search, president of the association,
who spoke briefly.
The wildest enthusiasm prevailed !
when President McKinley was Intro- j
duced. Men stood on their seats, I
women in the boxes waved their hand
kerchiefs and the uproar drowned the
speaker's voice. The cheering and â 
clapping of hands were redoubled when
a toast was drunk to the President.
President McKinley spoke slowly and
was plainly heard in every portion of
the hall. His reference to the cold day
In Cincinnati January 22, 1895, was re
ceived with laughter, which broadened
Into a perfect roar when he spoke of
the extension of business instead of
notes. President McKinley said in
part: %
I scarcely need remind you that we do
not meet as Btrangers. Neither your
business organization nor your social re
unions are altoÃether unfamiliar to me.
I have been with you before, not as guest
as now, but rather in the capacity of
host. I recall that as Governor of the
State of Ohio it was my pleasure to wel
come you to the city of Cincinnati on
January 22, IR9D. at the initial convention
of the Manufacturers' Association. I well
remember the occasion. It was a cold
day. You had lost everything bnt your
pluck, or thought you had; courage "was
the only friend your grief could call its
own. I note with satisfaction your im
proved appearance now. You are more
cheerful in countenance, more buoyant
In spirit, more hopeful In manner and
more confident in purpose. Th<*n, too,
there are more of you here than there
were at your first meeting. Distances are
of course the same, but traveling has
been resumed. Your speeches and reso
lutions at that first convention were di
rected mainly to the question of how to
regain what you had lost In the previous
years*: or, if that was found Impossible,

to us., and go out to the peaceful con
quest of new and greater fields of trade
and commerce. The recovery will come
slowly, perhaps, but it will come, and
when it does we will be steadier and will
better know how to avoid exposure here
after.
National policies can encourage Indus
try and commerce, but it remains for the
people to project and carry them on. If
these policies stimulate Industrial devel
opment and energy the people can be
safely trusted to do the r< st. The Gov
ernment, however. Is restricted in its
power to promote industry. It can aid
commerce, but not create it. It can
widen and deepen its rivers, improve its
harbors and develop Its great national
waterways, but Che ships to sail and the
traffic to carry the people must supply.
The Government can raise revenues by
i >n in such :i way as will discrim
inate in favor of domestic enterprises, but
it cannot establish tKm. It can make
commercial treaties, ope.ning to our man
ufacturers and agriculturists the ports
of other nations. It can enter into re
cfprocal arrangements to exchange our I
products with those of other countries. It ,
can aid our merchant marine l>y encour
aging our people to build ships of com
merce. It can assist in every lawful man
ner private enterprise to unite the two
oceans with the great canal. It can do j
all thes<- things, and ought to do them- 'â 
but with all this accomplished the result ;
will still i>e. ineffectual unless supple

dustry of the people. It Is they that must j
build and operate the factories, furnish I
Bhij s and cargoes for the canal and the
rivers and the seas. It is they who must
find the consumers and obtain trade by
going forth to win it.
Much profitable trade is still unenjoyed
by our people because of their present
insufficient facilities for reaching desira
ble markets. Much of It is lost because
or a lack of Information and ignorance
of the conditions and needs of other na- !
Uons p We must know just what other
people want before we can supply their
wants. \\ c must understand exactly how
to rt-iioh them with least expense. If wÂ«

not come to us for us to go to them. It

and industrial ambition, as well as
achievement terms of respect and praise
not only at homo, but among the family
of nations the world over.
Then- is another duty resting upon the
National Governmentâ "To coin money
and regulate the value thereof." This
duty requires that our government shall
regulate the value of its money by the
highest standards of commercial honesty
and national honor. The money of the
United States is and must forever be un
questioned and unassailable. If doubts
remain, they must be removed. If weak
places are discovered, they must be
strengthened. Nothing should over tempt
usâ nothing ever will tempt usâ to -
down the sacred debt of the nation
through a legal technicality. Whatever
may be the language of the* contract, the
United States will discharge all its obli
gations in the currency recognised as the
best throughout the civilised world at the
time of payment. Nor will we ever con
sent that the wages of labor or Its frugal
savings be scalod down, by permitting
payment in dollars of less value than the
dollars acepted as the best in every en
lightened nation of the earth.
Under existing conditions our citizens
cannot be excused If they do not redouble
their efforts to secure such financial legis
lation as will place their honorable In
tentions beyond dispute. All those who
represent, as you do. the great conserva
tive and the progressive business inter
ests of the country owe it not only to
themselves, but to the people, to insist
upon the settlement of this great ques
tion now. or else to face the alternative
that it must be again submitted for arbi

duty to more than seven million voters.

that the United States government would

its currency or the Inviolability of its" ob

It will not suffice for ottlsens nowadays
to say simply that they are In favor of
sound money. That is not enough. The
people's purpose must be given the vi

effort with failure, than the avoiding of
so pinin and commanding a duty. The
difficulties in the path of a satisfactory
reform are. it must be admitted, neither

a battle. Nations and parties without
abiding principle* and stern resolution to
enforce them, even if it costs a continu
ous struggle to do so and temporary sac
rifice, are never in the highest degree
successful leaders in the progress of man
kind. For us to attempt nothing In the
face of the present fallacies and the con
stant effort to spread them is to lose val
uable ground already won and practi
cally weaken the forces of sound money
for their battles of the future.
The financial plank of the St. Louis
platform Is still as commanding upon Re
publicans and those who served with
them in the last campaign as on the day
It was adopted and promulgated. Hap

Senator William P. Frye of Maine,
who was introduced as one of the
greatest friends of the merchant mar
ine, made a brief address. In speak
ing of the Nicaraguan canal he de
clared that the United States should
build It. He did not approve of the
private ownership of the canal by any
corporation; the Government was in
the best position to build and operate
the canal. Senator Frye said that the
value of the Hawaiian Islands was
$39,000,000 and that Americans owned
them. American ships carried the com
merce, valued at $23,000,000. He said
that if the treaty were not ratified, in
less than one year the islands would be
under the protection of Great Britain.
This was met with cries of "No."
Much confusion followed. He asked
the guests to exercise their influence
with the Senate to have the treaty
ratlfied. There were cheers and cries
of "No" as well. Senator Frye said
the Nicaraguan ranal would not be
worth a cent with the Hawaiian
Islands in the hands of an enemy. This
was received with applause.

"John Smith, the Bjug Man," HinÂ»Â» of
Greater Experiments in ttie Higher
Annual Kingdom.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 27.â Professor J.
B. Smith, entomologist in the New Jer
sey State Experimental Station in New
Brunswick, who read a paper on the
subject of bug grafting at a meeting of
the- New Jersey Microscopical Society
last Monday evening, demonstrated
that half of an insect couid be gran
ed on the half of another of an en
tirely different species.
When seen to-day in his combined
museum and laboratory in New Hruns
wick he expressed some regret that his
paper had attained publicity beyond
the little circle for which it was in
tended. He seemed fearful of laying
himself open to a charge of stealing
another man's thunder. Whatever
credit could be claimed for the discov
ery, he said, was live to Profeswor
Crampton of the American Society et
Naturalists, who had made experi
ment. 1 ? at Woods Holl, Mass., last sum
mer. But still Professor Smith was
thoroughly equipped to discuss the
matter. He had seen Professor Cramp
t'in's specimens, and explained the mo
dus operandi. Professor Smith is thor
oughly familiar with the Insect world;
in fact, he is known in New Bruns
wick as "John Smith, bug man," a so
briquet which he does not object to in
the least.
"It is perfectly true that Insects can
be grafted and live," he said. "My
first intimation of such a disco-very was
during a convention of naturalists' s<>
t letles In Ithaca, N. V.. during Christ
mas week. Professor Crampton read a
paper called "Some Grafting Experi
ments upon Lapidoptera,' and illus
trated it with specimens which he had
operated upon: there must have been
fifty or sixty of them. Some had been
grafted in such a way as to have two
heads and no- tails. Others had two
tails and no heads. Still others were
two perfectly formed insects, welded
together like Siamese twins, back to
back and belly to belly. The profes-
S( r then showed how it was done. Go
ing to a little glass case heated by
\\;trm air, ami which is really an in
sfct incubator, he selected a couple of
cocoons. The experiments, he told
me, must be made with pupae when in
sects are still in the embryonic state
of organization from caterpillar to
moth. With a sharp knife he split the
cocoons, disclosing a couple of wrig
gling pupae, which looked like grub
worms.
"Now," he- explained. "Professor
Crampton'p plan is to partially freeze
them that they shall be congested and
thus prevent the flow of blood. He
would cut the heads off these two fel
lows, graft the bodies together with
paraffine wax, and they would grow
together. They might develop into
moths, differing entirely from each oth
er in variety and size, but they would
develop into a headless monstrosity
just the same."
Professor Smith, when asked if, in his
opinion, the same results could be ob
tained with animals of a higher order,
said: "I should not like to go on rec
ord as making any statement in regard
to that, but the fact remains that many
things are regarded as impossible pim
ply because they have never been tried.
The grafting of Insects was never at
tempted until Professor Crampton took
It up, and it remains to be seen what
can be accomplished in the higher ani
mal kingdom."
Henry E. Crampton, Jr., an instruct
or In biology in Columbia University,
v.-ho has acliieved interesting results
from experimenting in bug grafting,
\\n<Â» seen in his laboratory to-da.. and
explained the value of his dlÂ»v*Tcries to
the scientific world.
"I do nc-t claim any originality In
these experiments." said Professor
Crampton. "I hare simply worked out
the theories of eminent scientists.
Grafting in plant life has long been
known, but It has never been tried be
fore In insect life. I made the experi
ments and evolved fnese strange mon
strosities in making researches in the
power of heredity. I have also made
several experiments in the transfusion
o{ the blood of insects in embryonic
stages and thus produced strange com
binations."
Professor Crampton produced sever
al small Jars containing results of his
experiments in bug grafting. Among
them was a tandem moth which had
been formed by cutting the head off of
one cocoon and welding the decapitat
ed pupa to another pupa from which
the tail had been cut. The result was
a long moth body with two sets of
wings.
"It would have lived." said Crampton,
regretfully, "If I had not dropped it
from a table and burst its body. Even
then I patched up the wound with a
bit of Japanese paper, and it lived four
or five days after the accident."
Another interesting: freak which he
showed was the Siamese twin butter
fly, which was formed by welding two
butterfly cocoons side by side with par
affine wax after cutting them open.
They were perfectly formed, and were
Joined by a broad ligament.
"I am now making experiments in
drawing the blood of one cocoon and
infusing into It the blood of another.
This affects the wing and body color
ings, and adds greatly to the study of
heredity. If these experiments can be
carried on In insects they may be carried
on In higher forms of life and reveal
much that is as yet unknown in study
of th,e cell, or the very essence of life.
I made these experiments years ago,"
concluded Crampton, "and I have now
some four or five hundred pupae wait
ing to hatch out. Much of them die,
however, in pupae stages. P am pre
paring a treatise on my experiments
which will be published soon."

KILLED BY HER
JEALOUS LOVER
Sensational Tragedy on
the Streets of Los
Angeles.
Charles Arthur Waylays and
Murders His Former
Mistress.
Takes Two Shots a,t His Rival, but
Neither of Them Reaches
the Mark.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 27.â This morn-
Ing about 11 o'clock a sensational mur
der was committed upon the principal
thoroughfare of the city. â¢ The victim
was a middle-aged woman, a Mrs.
Ransome, who was shot and instantly
killed by Charles Arthur, a blacksmith
from Pasadena.
The woman for the past two years
had been the mistress of Arthur, but
lately had deserted him and taken up
with one Jack Kennedy, a sporting
man. Arthur had brooded over the loss
of his mistress, and coming to town to
day from Santa Ana, where he had
been working, he armed himself with
a ::.'-caliber revolver and stood upon
Spring street, where hundreds were
passing, and awaited the coming of
Mrs. Ransomo.
Shortly before noon his patience was
rewarded and he saw the woman ap
proachlng with Kennedy. He followed
the couple until they were opposite a
vacant building and then drawing his
revolver he opened fire. Three shots,
every one of which would have had
deadly effect, entered the body of the
woman, who Eank to the pavement,
when Arthur turned his attention to
Kennedy, who was fleeing across the
street. He fired two shots at Kennedy,
neither of which took effect. He was
arrested without resistance 1 and taken
to the Central Police station. The
woman died within five minutes after
being taken to the Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. Kansome bore the appearance
of a hard-working woman instead of
that of a woman of the town, and in
fact had been a domestic in the family
of Dr. Hagan, the police surgeon.
Arthur talked very freely of the hor
rible crime. He expressed no com
punction and sai<i the deed was
prompted by jealousy. He had quar
reled with the woman upon two occa
sions and had once attempted suicide
on her account.
When told that his shots had not
taken effect upon the body of Kennedy
he expressed the deepest regret and
said that his satisfaction would have
been complete if ho had killed both the
man and the woman.
Hundreds of people were passing
along the busy tli"r.>uÂ£rhfare, and the
only wonder is that the shots fired at
Kennedy did not kill or wound some
of the numerous passers by. The
whole affair was orer in a minute, and
the man was on his way to Jail and
the woman to the Receiving Hospital
before tbe crowd? fully realized the
horrible tragedy that had been enacted
in their midst.
Arthur is about 50 years old. a
widower, and had deserted hla children
for the sake of the Ransome woman.

Frank Harrington of Alexander

Suspicion.
Takes the Situation Coolly and Says
He Is Able to Prove an
Alibi.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 27.â The exciting
Btory of the Booneville stage rubbery
and the cold-blooded murder of Bar
nett of Ukiah last September by two
bandits was revived to-day by the ar
rest of another suspect. Frank Har
rington of Alexander Valley is the man
under suspicion, and ho was arrested
by Deputy Sheriffs Leard and Weise
while pruning trees in an Alexander
Valley orchard. He is about six feet in
height, is light-haired and litdn-eom-
Plexioned, and wears a light, thin mus
tache.
Harrington does not say that he is
rot one of the robbers, but simply de
clares that he will prove an alibi. He
is not, apparently, much agitated over
his arrest, and is taking things com
fortably in the jail here to-night. But
on the word of "Lish" Finney, the
teamster who all along claimed that he
could identify the two suspicious char
acters he met in the mountains near
Ukiah the day of the tragedy. Harring
ton is one of these men, or his resemb
lance is an exceptionally close one.
Finney claims that on the day of the
robbery of the stage, and some time be
fore it was scheduled to appear, he saw
two men come out on the road. They
asked him how long it would be before
the Booneville stage would pass that
way. After telling them what he knew
about it. Finney says, the two men left
the highway
Finney was brought here to-night.
He was taken into the Jail and took a
careful survey of Harrington. After
ward he gave it as his opinion that

looking men he saw in the road the day
of the sensational robbery, and his
judgment was given without hesitation.
Deputy Sheriff Johnson of Mendocino
County is here, and to-night seems to
have much confidence in Finneys
story.

FLEECED BY A
SCHOOL-GIRL
Business Men of Fresno
Discover the Little
Culprit.
Home of Her Parents Found to
Be Overstocked With
Provisions.
Tha Mother Tearfully Pleads Inno
cence as She Restores tha
Stolen Goods.
BpÂ«e!ftl Dispatch to The Catt.
FRESNO. Jan. 27.â The identity of
the 14-year-old girl who has been vic
timizing Fresno business men for the
last several days has been discovered,
and it is believed the girl resorted to
the scheme to help her parents and sev
eral younger members of the family,
which seems to be in very straitened
circumstances. She is little Miss Gil
j bert, a blue-eyed, flaxen-haired, inno
i cent-looking and demure school girl.
She lives with her parents in a little
house on Blackstone avenue, about a
mile fr6m the center of the town. Her
father is a teamster, and while he was
working hard to earn a livelihood for
'his family, his little daughter was sup
plying the house with a stock of all
kinds of groceries, and bringing money
home to her mother every night.
The merchants who had been de
frauded by the girl learned who she
was, and yesterday and to-day she had
many visitors, as they all called at the
house and demanded the return of their
goods or the money she had obtained
from them under false pretenses.
Her scheme was to represent herself
to be sent by a customer of a store,
and she would give an order for grocer
ies, saying that she would take the
goods herself in her rig. She would
then drive to her own home and un
load. She told others that her moth> r
sent her to get four bits, as the baby
had swallowed poison. That ruse was
usually successful.
When told of her daughter's misrep
resentations, Mrs. Gilbert profesF-.l
to be greatly surprised and wept bit
trrly. She returned money to all who
demanded it, and paid out several dol
lars of her daughter's fraudulent earn
ings. Sacks of flour, potatoes and
other groceries were carried out of the
house by defrauded store-keepers, to
the great sorrow and disgust of little
Miss Gilbert, who saw all her clever
work come to naught.
The merchants who were victimized
think it very queer that the mother did
not suspect the daughter's honesty
when she brought so many things to
the house, and a strong suspicion is
entertained that she gave tacit consent,
if she did not actually put the child up
to the scheme. She declares, however,
that she supposed the girl was work
ing and that she thought she took the
provisions in part payment. The fam
ily have been living at their present
abndf for about a month and are
thought to be strangers in Fresno.
SWALLOWED CARBOLIC ACID.
Little Child of Sacramento Meets With a
Terrible Death.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27.âA sad thing
happened here to-day. The little IS
month-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W.
Elmer Brown went to her. uncle's house
near by. as she was accustomed to doing,
and while there entered a bedroom where
a phial of carbolic acid stood on a wash
stand. The child got the bottle and drank
the contents and then returned to where
her aunt was occupied with her house
hold duties. Mrs. Brown noticed the
empty bottle in the child's hand and, sus
pecting what had happened, telephoned
for a doctor. The doctor arrived in fif
teen minutes, but in the mean time the
child had been seized with convulsions
and died in about twenty minutes. The
parents reached the house early, but
nothing could be done to relieve the lit
tle one's sufferings.

Notable Santa Cruzan Dies a Pauper.
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 27.âAt the County
Hospital,without friends,Joaquin Thomp
son died to-day. His father was at one
time one of the largest property holders
in . this county. He owned hundreds of
acres of that beautiful section close to
Santa Cruz known as Thompson's Flat,
which to a great extent is divided into
small farms and includes the lovely Kerr
ranch, a portion of the California Powder

An Injunction Stops the
Rebuilding of Green-
Street Wharf.
Nothing Can Be Done to Lom
bard-Street Wharf for the
Same Reason.
In Consequence Vessels Are Waiting

End Places.
There Is not a spare berth on the en
tire water front, and applications are
five deep for space at the wharves
north of Market street. Green street.
at which there is space for several
ships, is half torn down, and, judging
by the way things are going now, it
will not be ready for use for six months
to come. The Harbor Commissioners
and the contractors have been more
than anxious to get the work complet
ed, but Injunction after injunction has
been served upon the board, and now
no one seems to know when the wharf
will be completed. For want of repairs.
Lombard-street wharf is also In such a
condition that vessels cannot dock at
it, so the Chief Wharfinger Is very
much hampered by the want of space
on the north end of the front.
When the question of repairing both
these wharves first came up, it was the
Intention of the Harbor Commission to
Bupply all the necessary piles and creo
sote them, and bids fur the doing of tho
work only werÂ« called for. Before the
contract was awarded the commission
was enjoined by the Pacific Pine Lum
ber Company. The Commissioners won
the case, but it was then necessary to
call for new bids. This time the con
tractor was called upon to supply the
necessary piles, but the board reserved
the right to have the timbers preserved
by any process they saw fit. Healy,
Tibbetts & ured the contract,
and at once dispatched the bark Merom
to the Sound for the necessary lumber.
Then bids were railed for the treating
of the piles, and the contract was
awarded to the San Francisco Timber
Preserving Company; hut in the mean
time the Parafflne Paint Company
served another Injunction on the board,
and the matter is now being settled in
tho courts.
Tho bark Merom has now arrived
with md -7.". 000 feet of lumber,
and there is no wharf at which to dock
the vessel, and even when she is docked
Healy. Tlbbetts & Co. cannot proceed
with the work, as the Harbor Commis
sioners will not be able to have the
soted until the case now in
court is settled. In order to get the
vessel off their hands, the contractors
will have to build a temporary wharf
at <;reen street, on which to discharge
the timbers. The contractors are more
than anxious to get the work complet
ed, as they have over $12,000 in lumber
alone tit-d up in the job. As the mat
ter stands now, should the Harbor
Commissioners win, new bids will have
to be called for.
The contract time for the completion
of the repairs to Green-street wharf
has already expired, but some time ago
Healy, Tibbetts & Co. notified the board
that they were ready to deliver the
piles at any place designated, ask-
Ine that body when it would be ready
to begin the treatment of the timbers.

Margaret MarKel Gets Six Morjths

Margaret Markel, a married woman liv

broken a glass over her husband's head,
and If It had not been for the interfer

Vessels are waiting five deep to secure berths north of Market street, while for want of repairs Green and Lombard
street wharves cannot be used. The bark Merom, with lumber for Green-street wharf, is in port, but a place
to dock her cannot be found, nor could her cargo be of much use if she could land it, as an injunction
prevents the Harbor Commissioners from going on with the work. The contract calls for the creosotmg of
all piles used in the rebuilding of the wharf, and that is the bone, of contention.
DRINK LEADS
TO MURDER
Nathan Phillips Fatally
Shot by Charles E.
Weathers.
A Tragedy in Low Life Enacted
in an Ellis-Street
Dive.
The Murderer Pleads, as Usual, That
He Has No Recollection of
tho Affair.
Nathan Phillips, who was employed
as a night bartender at the Empire
Theater, an underground resort at 21
Ellis street, was shot and instantly
killed shortly before 6 o'clock yesterday
morning by Charles K. "Weathers, a re
cent arrival from Vlsalla.
Weathers was under the influence of
liquor at the time, and, he says, does
not remember under what circum
stances the fatal shots were fired. He
arrived here Christmas week and has
been living in a rooming house at 103
Powell street.
According to the story told by those
conversant with the circumstances.
Weathers started off Wednesday night
to see the after-night side of city life.
He spent his money lavishly, got intox
icated in a short time, and wandered
from one disreputable resort to another.
Early in the evening he visited the
Empire Theater, and returned again
about 5:30 yesterday morning to claim
that he had been robbed of $20 by one
of the waitresses.
He sought out the ostensible proprie
tor of the place, Peter Hall; and de
manded that the money be returned.
He was informed that he was mis
taken, and that probably he had been
robbed in ODe of the other dives visit
ed by him. Thereupon he drew a re
volver, and, leveling it at Hall, said he
Intended getting what belonged to him
before he left the place. Hall, who is
somewhat of a sprinter, darted up the
stairs leading to Ellis street, with
Weathers in close pursuit. Hall blew
for police help when he reached the
sidewalk, and this attracted the atten
tion of Lester Goldberg, a haekman,
who has a stand in front of the the
ater.
Weathers leveled the revolver at
Goldberg, who promptly dodged behind
his back. Weathers then walked back
to the head of the stairway. Phillips,
who was on his way home, was as
cending the steps, when Weathers -fired
two shots in rapid succession down the
stairs at him.
Officers Phil Fraher, Hurd and Cook
were standing at the corner of Market
and Stockton streets when the shots
rang out. They ran up Ellis Street
and found Weathers, with a revolver
in his hand, crouched up against th<j
side of the building. Fraher caught
him from behind and Hurd grabbed
him by the arms. In an instant he
was disarmed and the handcuffs placed
on him. While Fraher and Hurd were
taking Weathers to the Central station
Officer Cook went down into the thea
ter and found Phillips lying dead on
the floor about three feet from the bot
tom of the stairway.
only one of the two shots fired by
Weathers tcok effect. The bullet struck
Thillips between the right ear and eye
and penetrating the brai.i caused in
stant death.
Philips was a native of California,
2- >Â»-}jrp of age and resided with his
widowed mother at 16 Yerba Buena
street.
7^Â» athers, acting under the advice of
his c< tinsel, declined to make any state
ment yesterday other than that he was
sorry for the occurrence.
Stole From H's Father.
James Sademan, son of Frank Sade
man, the ex-Janitor of Emmanuel Baptist
Church, was sentenced to six months In
the County Jail by Judge Campbell yes
terday for petty larceny. While the fam
ily was viewing the parade Monday
young Sademan stole $30 from the house
and was arrested on complaint of his
father. Both father and Km appeared as
witnesses for the State at the Durrant
trial.
Many Pneumonia Cases.
The recent cold weather has caused a
remarkable Increase in the number of
pneumonia cases reported to the health
office, as shown by the records of the
Health Department. Since the Ist of Jan
uary sixty-six casos b&va been reported,
with a more than usually large percent
age of deaths.

TO TRY FIGEL
FOR MURDER
Three More Jurors Se
cured to Pass Judgment
on His Guilt.
The Difference Between Rea
sonable and Possible Doubt
the Stumbling Block..
Many of Those Examined Are Unable
to Distinguish the Legal
Distinction.
. . â 
Thp not results of yesterday's pro
ceedings in Judge Cook's court was the
acceptance <if three more Jurors to try
Theodore Figel on the charge of hav
ing murdered Isaac Hoffman last
June.
"Reasonable doubt" is the great ob
stacle to rapid progress in securing
the jury. Many men have been ex
amined who hid fair to prove accepta
ble to both sides until Judge Murphy,
for the prosecution, would bepin to
! question them as to their knowledge of
the difference between a reasonable
! and possible doubt. Few were famil
iar enough with the Intricacies of the
law to recognize the difference and in
si.-t.-d upon giving the defendant the
benefit of any possible doubt. This.
, of course, was entirely satisfactory to
thÂ« defense, but the holders of such
: opinions were speedily challenged by
the prosecution.
During the morning session the panel
was exhausted after securing one Ju
ror. Henry Hanus. a hardware dealer
residing at 11 Henry street, and ad
journment had t<> be taken until 2
o'clock to enable the bailiff to round up
a new lot.
Mr. Hanus came near falling down
!on the "reasonable doubt" point, hut
finally he was made to understand the
: fine distinction of the law. He was
sworn in.
In the afternoon the Jury box was
filled by the drawing of J. R. Phillips
R. D. West, F. L. Guntz, G. F. Roberts
Ed F. Ring, 1.. Lautermllch, A J Ken
nedy, Fred Bouggen and J. A. Brewer
Mr. Phillips, a merchant residing at
317 Leavenworth street, answered all
the questions to the apparent satisfac
tion of both sides, and was temporarily
passed, as was R. B. West, a Jeweler
living at 424 Geary street. F L,"
Guntz. an undertaker, living at SI Do
lores street, got tangled up with old
"reasonable doubt" and was excuse l
G. F. Roberts, a p,,lk street confec
tioner, had strong conscientious scru
ples against the death penalty on cir
cumstantial evidence, and he was al
lowed to go.
The fact that Detective Dillon was
married to his aunt did not militate
against Mr. Ring, who keeps a grocery
store at Nineteenth and Castro streets
and as he answered all the questions
satisfactorily he was passed.
L. Lautermilch was opposed to hang
ing and was excused. A. J. Kennedy
, also escaped on admitting that he was
biased because of his strong friend
ship for Figel's brother and father
Fred Bouggen, a grocery man con
fessed that his knowledge of English
i was too limited to permit him to serve
' and he was allowed to go back to his
store.
J. A. Bremer, a solicitor for the
Royal Insurance Company, was tem
porarily passed, but after Judge Mur
phy had peremptorily challenged Mr
Phillips Judge Louderback exercised
the same right In regard to Mr Bre
mer, leaving only West and Ring to be
sworn in.
Clerk Tolle then drew the names of
R. v. Crosky. J. I. Twohig. w j o
Muhl, 11. Bohlman. F. J. Baumef r"
<-<>hen and T. H. Chandler, and those
gentlemen having taken their seats in

defense, adjourned the case until Mon

TO ENTER THE
ALASKA TRADE
Splendid Ocean Steamer
Australia to Go on
the Route.
Her Place on the Hawaii Run
to Be Taken by the
Zealandia.
A Small FirÂ© in the Offices of the
Harbor Commission Caused
Excitement
Vessels for the Klondike are still in
great demand, and if the chartering
that has been p oing on for the last few
days continues the coasting fleet will
soon all be on the route to the gold
fields. The latest addition to the host
of craft that will take part in the rush
is the magnificent ocean steamer Aus
tralia. On her arrival here February
12 she will be withdrawn from the
Honolulu trade and her place will be
taken by the steamer Zealandia. The
latter vessel will be brought down
from Martinez to-day and will be fitted
out f<^r the island trade. She will have
a refrigerating chamber put in and
si.iiu- minor repairs made, after which
?=he will go out on the Australia's sail
ing date.
The Australia will be far and away
the finest vessel that will carry miners
to Dyea or Skaguay th* winter or to
St. Michael next spring. She has the
best of accommodations for over 500
passengers, and being a 15-knot liner
will be able to outrun anything in the
trade. The chances are that her crew
will be transferred to the Zealandia,
and a new body of men will be placed
on the Australia. The reason for put
ting the Australia on the route Instead
of the Zealandia is that the Zealandia
flies the Hawaiian flag and the Aus
tralia has an American register.
Other vessels that are to be brought
out of retirement and put in the pas-
I Benger trade are the steam whalers
Karluk and Alexander, lioth of them
will be thoroughly overhauled and fit
ted out and will get away early in Feb
ruary. The demand for tickets to Kot
zebue Sound is so great that the bark
Alaska will not be able to carry all
who want to go, and In consequence I
Captain Cogan is now negotiating for I
the purchase of the whaling bark I
Northern Light. In former years the |
number of vessels that left here for
the Arctic on whaling cruises was '
about twenty-flve steamers and wind I
Jammers. This year what with the tush
to the Klondike and the loss of vessels '
in the Arctic only nine vessels all told j
will nt out this season. The steam
whaler Thrasher, instead of going to
the Arctic in search of whales, will car
ry supplies to the canneries, and in her
spare time will make trips to Dyea,
Skaguay and St. Michael.
There was to have been a meeting of
the Harbor Commissioners yesterday
to award the contracts for a concrete
sidewalk extending the full length of
the ferry depot, but owing to the fact
that President Colnon and Secretary
Keegan were engaged in the injunction
suit in Judge Seawell's court, the meet
ing was postponed until to-day. Com
missioner Harney, Architect Swain,
Chief Engineer Holmes and Chief
Wharfinger Root were in the board
rooms when a small fire broke out in j
the draughting department and caused â 
considerable excitement. The fire was
between the doors near the fire-place,
and, none of the gentlemen named be
ing able to put it out, an alarm was
turned in and the Fire Department
soon had the blaze under control.
The gasoline vessel Hercules will
pall to-day for the Marshall group. She
is a new boat built by Turner for the
Jalult Trading Company of Hamburg,
and is the first vessel launched here
to go at once under the German flag.
Engineer Kraising has arrived here
from Hamburg, and will go to the Mar
shall group on the vessel. Captain
"Dick" Schwarting will take the vessel
down, and he will have under him Nate
Regan, Steward Edwards and three
sailors. Captain Schwarting has to be
sent back to San Francisco by way of
either China or Australia, but the com
pany only guarantees to return the re
mainder of the orew to either Austra
lia. Manila or Hongkong. The Hercu
les will take down a general cargo for
her owners. The last time Captain
Schwarting left San Francisco for the
Marshal! group he was in command of
the little bark John Wesley. She w.ia
so old and out of date that no one ever
thought she would reach her lestina
ticm, but the hardy skipper got her
there in safety and still lives to tell the
tale.

Charles Bone Admits That h\e Is
the Man and Is Arrested.
Detectives Graham and Sullivan, who
were detailed Wednesday by Captain
Hohen on the cat poisoning cases men
tioned in yesterday's Call exclusively,
went out to Stelner street and were not
long in discovering the offender.
J. C. Fredericks. 1612 Stelner street, told
Bohen that he suspected his next door
neighbor, Charles Bone, a clerk, and when
the detectives saw Bone he at once ac
knowledged that he had placed the poi
soned fish in his back yard with the ob
ject of killing Frederick's Maltese cats
as they were a nuisance to the neighbor
hood by destroying flowers and plants in
the gardens and keeping everybody awake
by their howling.
Yesterday Fredericks appeared in Judge
Campbell's court and swore to a com
plaint charging Bone with maliciously
killing one of his Maltese cats on the
night of January 23. Bone was arrested
by Sullivan and Graham and booked at
the City Prison. He was promptly re
leased on bonds and said he would fight
the case.

FINES WERE NOT

Morosco's Leading Man Re

at Rehearsal, Which He Re
fused to Pay.
William Pascoe, actor, has ceased to
foil the villains that nightly drench the
Grand Opera House stage with uiood, ami
hereafter he will devote himself to the res
cue of imperiled maidens at the Alcazar.
ThÂ« trouble was brought about by a
paltry $2 fine Imposed by the management
at Morosco's for tardiness at rehearsal,
and to which the footlight hero haughtily
refused to submit.
That, in brief, accounts for the absence
of William Pascoe. actor, from the cast
of "Brother for Brother," and explains
why Harry Mainhall was hastily sum
moned from New York by telegraph and
will assume the leading role at that place
of amusement next Monday night.
As the chief earner of plaudits Mr. Pas
coo came to fancy that well-established
rules â especially the rule requiring
prompt attendance at rehearsals â were not
for him, and gradually his morning slum
bers extended into the hour that saw his
co-workers clustered about on the gloomy
stage mechanically mumbling their lines.
Remonstrances were of no avail, and fin
ally the stage manager called attention to
the rule providing for a fine of $2 for be
ing late at rehearsal. Mr. Pascoe laughed
in scorn and said that while such rules
might do for subordinates they could nev
er be applied to him.
The manager thought differently, and
when he attempted to enforce it he was
handed Mr. Pascoe's resignation, to take
effect immediately. The resignation was
acepted and Mr. Pascoe sought and ob
tained an engagement at the Alcazar,
while Morosco engaged Mainhall to fill
the vacancy.
"Mr. Pascoe got fresh and wouldn't at
tend rehearsals or do anything else that
was required of him." iÂ« the ivny the
treasurer of Morocco's nuts it. "He was
finea {2 for being late and refused to pay
it, so he quit."

CONCERNING THE REV. C. O. BROWN.
AS shamelessness ever merits rebuke, there is
occasion for speaking once frankly concerning
the Rev. C. O. Brown.
All men are so far from perfect that grievous
shortcomings may be overlooked, more especially if
followed by repentance. The bopk from which
Brown still has the presumption to select texts
teaches that only the one without sin has a right to
cast a stone at the offender. But a minister of the
Gospel stands on a different plane. He is supposed
to be qualified to point out the way of salvation to
others, and when he descends from the pulpit to revel
in wickedness he makes of his high calling a mock
ery and a scoffing. Therefore Brown is not exempt
from correction by decency either in or out of the
church.
The man appears to have no good in him. So
far as may be judged by his record and his present
attitude he is a moral pervert as incapable of genuine
remorse as was Durrant, and with egotism as mon
strous. From the time he was first exposed as a
hypocrite there has been in his conduct no gleam
of a noble nature, no hint of a generour- sorrow.
Throughout his trial he lied, sometimes with unction,
sometimes with a venom undisguised. And at the
end he deliberately sent abroad false reports of the
result, a crime which he later repeated at Chicago.
Before the mask had been torn from him Brown
pursued a course which could only have been ac
tuated by depravity the most shocking. He gath
ered about him a brood of evil women, taking one
of these into his domestic circle, her presence there
being an unspeakable insult to his wife. These
women he dared to address as "sisters" in assem
blages where people had gathered to worship God.
called upon them to pray, openly clasped them by the
hand. Then meeting outside he plotted with them
how his deeds might be covered. He did not hesi
tate to slander the innocent, nor did he stay his wan
ton tongue when the grave had closed over two of
them. With a blasphemy appalling and disgusting
he even ascribed their taking-off to the wrath of the
Almighty exercised in his behalf. Now, after there
is no longer question of his guilt he "confesses."
To what?
The so-called confession is only another of the
long list of Brown deceptions. It is really an attempt
at self-glorification. By implication it tries to convey
the impression that although Brown was not wholly
innocent, he had been far more sinned against than
sinning. It speaks of "a deep and malignant con
spiracy against his home." He knows that no such
conspiracy ever existed; he knows that people arc
aware of this knowledge on his part. The charge
comes with ill grace from a man who had deliberately
sullied that home by installing within its walls as
favorite a creature of the streets. There is naught in
the confession indicating regret; its abjectness has
no ring of sincerity, its promises are hollow. It is
not what it purports to be. It is a palpable sham.
a crowning infamy born of a character wholly barren
of the elements tending to respond to an impulse
toward reform. Yet this man calmly proposes still
to serve a cause to which he is more than a reproach.
He has become a stench in the nostrils.
If Brown were an ordinary scoundrel caught in his
guilt he would have seized upon the chance to slink
from the gaze of men. Realizing that he had yielded
to temptation, he would at the first awakening of his
better nature have deserted the pulpit he had made
unclean, nor thought boldly of demanding the privi
lege of returning. Rather in solitude would he have
supplicated not alone to be forgiven, but forgotten,
and upon his bowed head have heaped the dust of
abasement. His contrition he would have showed in
good works and mayhap have won his way anew
into esteem. Brown did none of this. He had no
better nature to awaken. With a lie on his lips he
sought other fields, and with another lie he comes
back, unblushing, unrcgenerate.
Now let him go or let him stay; this paper is
through with Brown.
There is some curiosity to know why the United
States has not the same right to have a ship at Ha
vana that any other nation has. Spain is not looked
upon as the dictator of this country.
Bunko men caught trying to rob people bound for
the Klondike ought to be sentenced to a term of
years in that region and forced to spend it in packing
goods over the trails for honest folk.
People who are induced to buy brass jewelry at
gold rates cannot be regarded as astute, but in mak
ing their trouble known they earn the right to be
classed as heroic.
The proposition to reduce the mail carrier service
of San Francisco does not excite anything which the
authorities at Washington can possibly construe into
â¢nthusiasm
IMPROVEMENTS IN OAKLAND.
AN Oakland correspondent assumes an attitude of
regret that The Call is opposed to public im
provements in that city, in the Hue of parks,
boulevards and other betterments and blandishments
which are public in the sense of being at the cost of
the whole city. Some recent remarks printed over
the signature of our Oakland reporter are quoted as
conclusive of the policy of this paper.
It seems hardly necessary to say that the corre
spondent is entirely in error. The Call has re
cently indicated in the plainest and strongest way its '
desire to assist Oakland in this very line of improve
ments, and that policy is not changeable by the
passing opinions of a reporter whose contacts im
pressed him with the feeling that the people are not
unanimous in their enthusiasm for a spirited public
policy.
What we did and do deprecate is that every rising
tide of public spirit in Oakland and elsewhere is
taken advantage of to float some speculation in real
estate.
This was evidently the case in Oakland. When the
filling in of the fetid marsh, which is the city's front
door, at Sixteenth street station, had progressed so
far as to impress the people as a long needed im
provement of vast benefit to the city, there origin
ated a strong public feeling in favor of acquiring as
much of it as possible for conversion into a park.
Turning to the account of the celebration of this fill
ing by a flag-raising on the marsh, we find that the
Mayor in a speech declared in favor of such acquisi
tion and the applause manifested the universal ap
probation.
With this policy, favorable to a long and much
needed public improvement abroad, the speculator
soon appeared. Every agent of a ranch within a
half day's drive of the city began to declaim upon its
fitness for a park. Land on the mountain tops on
the line of Contra Costa County was extolled as the
only fit place for an Oakland park. Other land far
beyond the city limits and adjoining the cemetery
was presented as another "garden set eastward in
Eden."
The energy of the speculators was demonstrated in
a petition for the purchase of a ranch seven miles
beyond the city limits, signed by four times as many
people as put their names to any other petition.
In addition to these fantastic evidences of an ef
fort to pull the people around by the nose was the
course of one Oakland paper. When it seemed
probable that the Council would select a tract differ
ent from the one it favored it insisted that no ground
should be purchased except by condemnation. When
the Council seemed to turn toward the tract favored
by the same paper it ceased suddenly and entirely to
advocate condemnation.
All of these signs are so plain that no observer
mistakes them, and if the Council shall succeed in
spite of the pressure of selfish interests, and threats
that a yellow newspaper in San Francisco will burn
it up if it favor any but one tract, in presenting a
proposition that combines and reconciles public and
not private interests, no support will be heartier than
The Call'?.
As we have said heretofore, no plan for public im
provements in that city which omits the comprehen
sive reclamation and parking of the West Oakland
marsh will be worth considering. No city in the
State has a better location for a level park than that.
It commands the bay and the mountains in an en
chanting perspective, and if laid in lawn spaces,
flecked with foliage forms and brightened with
flowers it will help the whole State and be of such
interest to San Francisco as a sort of verdant ves
tibule that rich people in this city will not be ap
pealed to in vain to aid in its decoration.
BOOKS FOR THE PEOPLE.
AMONG the local items of the smaller papers of
the interior there are frequent announcements
of entertainments of one form and another
given for the purpose of raising money to purchase
books for reading circles or to lay the foundations of
free circulating libraries. These items attest the
eagerness of persons who live in remote districts to
obtain the advantages of a library, and afford con
clusive proof of the benefit that would result from the
establishment in this State of the traveling library
system.
, The plan projected for the proposed traveling li
braries is simple and inexpensive. The first step is
to be the formation of library associations through
out the State. These need not be large. A dozen
responsible property holders is sufficient to organize
maintain one, and there is hardly any community
in California so small that it cannot furaeh a library
membership to that extent.
For the use of these associations the State is to
furnish out of its many volumes at Sacramento a
series of libraries containing from fifty to one hun
dred books each. These are to be sent from one as
sociation to another, each association paying the
freight charges and guaranteeing the preservation of
the books and their return to the State. The asso
ciation may restrict the use of the books to its own
members or may circulate them generally as it
pleases. When one set of books has been read it is
packed in the case provided for it and forwarded to
another association, while a new set is received in ex
change.
The plan has been put to the test of practice in
several States in the East and has been found bene
ficial in every respect. It is the most economical
way of providing standard works for the general mass
of leaders in rural communities, and is the only way
to make a State library accessible to the great ma
jority of the taxpayers who support it.
The papers of the interior which are giving so
much kindly notice to the entertainments undertaken
among their readers to establish libraries and
reading circles should direct attention to the travel
ing library system. It is far superior in every way to
the old form of making small collections of books in
each sparsely settled community, inasmuch as it pro
vides such communities with new books as fast as
desired and gives a far wider choice to select from.
No State in the Union has a greater need for trav
eling libraries than California, since few States are so
thinly settled, and in none are the people more in
telligent or more given to the habit of reading and
studying standard works. In the State library at
Sacramento there is a splendid store of volumes from
which to draw the proposed sets of books for State
circulation. The cost of putting the plan into prac
tice would be little, and if a general rtemand is made
for it the next Legislature can be counted on to pro
vide it.
There will be few objections to war with Spain or
anything else if the yellow editors will only agree to
enlist.
An evening paper states that a certain man "sui
cided," but no dictionary in the land will uphold the
verdict
THE SAX FR.YXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1898.
NO CHANCE FOR A CONTRACT.
THE Mission street Boodler, with a confidence
which only could arise from a long and intimate
acquaintance with Colonel Mazuma, informs its
readers that it has "no water works for sale, no axes
to grind and no interests to serve but those of the
people." This is interesting but not news. Every intel
ligent person in the State of California knows that the
Boodler does not deal in "water works," "axes" or
''interests " Its business is confined entirely to get
ting "advertising" contracts out of corporations. In
these contracts it agrees for a stipulated sum to main
tain such attitude toward its victims as will enable
them to apparently overcome its opposition.
The famous Southern Pacific $30,000 contract was
of this character. Under that agreement the Boodler
was to receive $1000 a month for thirty months in
consideration of which it offered during that period
to refrain from criticizing the railroad monopoly ex
cept in so far as criticism was necessary to maintain
its character of a sand lot sheet. The thirty months
covered a State campaign and two Legislatures, and
the contract was consequently equivalent to two and
a half years of editorial silence upon the material
"interests" of the Southern Pacific Company.
Who will say that this is not more profitable than
selling water works, grinding axes or serving the "in
terests" of the people? Who would expect a sheet
like the Boodler to waste its time on such trivialities
when it can get $1000 a month for serving the
Southern Pacific? It should be remembered that al
though the subject of this famous $30,000 contract
was "advertising," the railroad monopoly never ad
vertised. The Boodler never took the trouble to earn
the money. All it did was to keep dark and on the
first of each and every month promptly present its
voucher for $1000.
The Call has at least one good reason for protest
ing against the entry of the Mission street Boodler
into the Los Angeles water fight. The influence of
the Boodler, so thoroughly are its motives under
stood, works in an inverse ratio to the square of the
object upon which it is exerted. That is, the people
always "copper" it. If the Boodler were to say that
the sun shines it would be a safe bet that the orb of
day was under a cloud. So in the Los Angeles water
fight, even if the Boodler did not succeed in getting
a fat "advertising" contract out of the corporation
which is endeavoring to purloin the water works of
that city, it could do nothing but harm. Were it to
espouse the people's interest an inquiry would have
to be undertaken immediately to determine whether
somebody had not blundered in organizing the fight
tc recover the water plant.
We trust the Boodler will perceive the extreme
propriety of keeping out of this affair. There is no
chance to get an "advertising" contract, and any
attempt it may make to break in can only result in
confusion. The Boodler for the present should con
fine itself to scandal, crime, lying and faking. In
those lines it has no competitor.
CALIFORNIA IN CONGRESS.
LJ P to date there have been received by The Call
I 151 bills introduced into the House of Repre
sentatives by members of the California delega
tion. They include nearly all bills by California Rep
resentatives presented to the House at this session,
and make a comparatively full showing of the ob
jects to which the energies of our Congressmen are
directed.
Almost exactly half the total number are pension
measures in one form or another, and of these by far
the greater number are private pension bills. The
list stands thus: Twenty-eight bills relating to na
tional affairs, eleven to public improvements in Cali
fornia, twelve to general Californian interests, twenty
five to private claims, fifty-eight to private pensions,
fifteen for the removal of records of desertion, and
two pension bills of a general nature.
All the bills to remove records of desertion are
\irtually pension bills, as the object of removing the
charge is simply to render the applicant eligible for
a pension. Of the two general pension bills one pro
vides that all soldiers who served in both the Mexican
and the Civil wars shall be entitled to a pension of
$^4 per month, widows and minor children of such
veterans being included. The other provides a pen
sion for all enlisted men or appointed petty officer?
of the navy who have served for thirty years and have
reached fifty years of age.
Of the twelve bills affecting the general interests
-J California the most important are bills providing
for the preservation of timber in Yosemite Park, to
locate roadways to the park, to provide for the ex
amination and classification of mineral lands, the im
provement of the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers,
and to reimburse the State for money expended dur
ing the Civil War.
Among the appropriations asked for particular dis
tricts are $100,000 for a Government building in Ala
meda, $350,000 for a building in Oakland, $1,000,000
for a gun factory at Benicia, $50,000 for a postoffice
at Woodland, $50,000 for Grass Valley, $150,000 for
Eureka, $40,000 for Santa Rosa, and an increase of
$175,000 in the amount appropriated for a Govern
ment building at Stockton, making the aggregate cost
$250,000.
Of the bills relating to national affairs the more
notable are Mr. Loud's measures for reform in the
postal service and for the establishment of a cable
between the United States, Hawaii and Japan; Mr.
Maguirc's, to establish a postal telegraph system:
Mr. Barham's. to create an executive department of
mines and mining, and an extraordinary one by Mr.
Parlow providing for the collection of an income
tax, an inheritance tax and the organization of the
unemployed into an industrial army of the United
States.

private claims and private pensions is not large when
compared with similar bills presented by members of
other States. The interests of the State generally arc

given to the efforts that are being made at Washing

THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE.
The announced success of the eclipse
observations in India has awakened an
interest that cannot be fully satisfied
until further details arrive by mall, but
from the few facts sent much can be In
ferred.
The ethereal and beautiful corona, the
chief mystery of the sun's surroundings,
has been photographed in a manner never
before accomplished, and the picture re
ceived will remain a historic relic, in
creasing In value as the centuries pass.
The accounts compare the form of the
solar aureole on this occasion to those of
August, ISB6. and August, 1896, shown in
Urn illustration, but the extensions were
equatorial, as in the well remembered
eclipse of ISS9, which was visible here.
Such an outline was particularly adapted
to test the admirable invention of Pro
fessor Burckhalter of the Chabot Ob
servatory.
The difficulty with previous coronal
pictures was that the denser inner lumi
nosity was overexposed and consequently
blurred while awaiting the impress of the
outer and fainter streamers. Sometimes
the latter were photographed piecemeal
and attached partly by conjecture after
ward to pictures of the inner details.

gained by a short exposure of the plate.
To remedy this drawback Professor Burck
halter has devised an ingenious instru.
ment that allows an exposure, graduated
by means of rapidly revolving screens, to
suit the different degrees of luminosity.
The true structure of the fantastic forms
can thus be traced from the solar limb to
the verge of Invisibility.
William M. Plereon, who provided funds
for this experiment, is to be congratu
lated on his insight in aiding such a valu
able scientific advance. In accordance
with It. no doubt, the preparations for
the eclipse of 1900 will be conducted, for
tin- k< nius of Charles Burckhalter has
opened a new era in eclipse photography.
But Californian triumphs do not end
here. It is to be interred from the word-
Ing of the cablegram from the Lick Ob
servatory expedition that the existence
of the reversing layer (a spectroscopic
name given to the portion of the chromo
sphere that rests on the solar surface) is

of the dispatch obscures the meaning,

THE CALL AND THE CITY OF OAKLAND.
Editor Call: Your paper, owing to Its
extended circulation, can materially aid
or Injure this city, and it is a matter of
regret that your local correspondent, who
Is held In high esteem here. Is not more
In sympathy with that element of our
citizenship which is earnestly engaged in
an effort to lift Oakland out of a rut and
place her In her proper place in the list
of Western cities. In the development of
a public spirit in connection with the pro
posed purchase of park lands The Call Is
In position to prove an Important factor,
but it has been evident for some time
that your correspondent has not shared
the enthusiasm felt on that subject by
thousands of the progressive men and
women In this city. In to-day's paper he
says:
"Next Monday night if the City Council
can read the trend of public opinion it
will entertain and pass a resolution to
lay the whole park matter on the table.
There Is no desire for a park and never
was. The people have not asked for one
and do not seem to appreciate the fact
that the controversy arose when a real
estate man offered to sell a large tract to
the city for a generous price. Then every
other real estate dealer who had any kind
of an old section to dispose of called it a
tract, gave a free picnic to the grounds
and generously offered It for sale at any
number of prices. The proceeding has
been a farce from beginning to end. and
has now become so ridiculous that its
further discussion is beneath the dignity
of the city government. Anybody tha"t
thinks the people of this city will vote
bonds- for half-a-million dollars' worth of
schemes and jobs Is pitifully Ignorant of
the truth. Oakland is ready for the next
bubble.
All of which is calculated to give to
your readers generallyâ and especially
those In other sections of the country
with whom Oakland Is particularly de
sirous of appearing to good advantageâ
the Impression that this Is an unenter
prising community, absolutely devoid of
public spirit and occupied with chasing
bubbles. The "controversy" In regard to
parks did not arise "when a real estate
man offered to sell a largo tract of land
to the city for a generous price." A year
and a half ago the Board of Trade ap
pointed a committee of five to take the
matter under consideration, and through
Its chairman, E. C. Sessions, secured an
Immense amount of practical informa
tion by correspondence with park com
missioners and park superintendent in
many of the leading cities of the country
Partial reports were made by this com
mittee at various times, and discussions
had at meetings of the Board of Trade

out in a bright line spectrum for a few j
moments at the edge of the sun, the in
stant the white disk is obscured by the
moon. This Is what is meant by the
spectrum of the flash, mentioned in one
dispatch. The spectrum is changed or re
versed from comparatively dark lines to
bright lines wnen seen apart from the
glowing background of the sun's surface.
No less an authority than Sir Norman
Lockyer (recently knighted during the i
Victorian Jubilee for his spectroscopic at- j
tainments) has questioned the correct- j
ness of this theory. However, though he !
went to India equipped with a larger
prism in front of his six-inch object-glass
than has been before used during an
eclipse, the announcement of his su< Â«ss
ful observations is non-committal on the j
subject. There is little doubt but that
valuable photographs of the chromo- i
sphere and prominences have been also
obtained, and when developed and com- j
pared much Information will be fortheom- ]
ing on the subjects which the expeditions i
went forth to investigate. These includ- j
cd. besides the ehromospheric phenom
ena and the outline of the corona, an In- â¢
vestigatlon as to Its relative brightness,
Its rotation and the matter of which it \
is composed. In such researches Profes
sor Campbell, chief of the I,ick Observa
tory party, is especially skillful; but he
has also obtained photographs of the in
ner corona with the same forty-foot tele
scope so efficiently used by Professor
Schaeberle in 1893 in Chile.
The marvelous aerole that glimmered ;
above the shadowed tracts of India for a j
brief two minutes has not-, then, flitted j
by as a mere vision of beauty. Seldom, if '<
ever, have so many efficient equipments |
been conveyed to a strange clime, despite I
the rumors of plague, famine and political j
disturbance, and been favored with ciear j
weather in so many localities at once, i
Foremost in the band of scientific, travel
en are the Californian astronomers, with I
their unique instruments, their h6pe, their |
skill and their endurance; and foremost,
no doubt, will be the result of their ob
st-rvatlons.
The announcement of their success
seems strangely opportune in this jubilee
week, as if the jfleam of the corona was
needed to complete the significant cele
bration of the progress of the Golden
State from a few scattered mining camps
to a center of civilization and intellectual
attainment. ROSE O'HALLORAN.
Prices were also obtained on various
suitable tracts of land.
About five months ago a proposition
was made direct by the owner to the
Council to sell the city a tract of 276 acres
of land for $360,000. The Council appointed
a committee to take this proposition under
advisement and to ask for proffers of
land from other property owners. This
committee appointed a half dozen leading:
real estate men to serve, in an advisory
capacity. In regard to prices and author
ized them to act in conjunction with the
Board of Trade park committee and a liko
body appointed by the Merchants' Ex
change, the result being that proffers of
land were secured from nearly a dozen
owners of property suitable for park pur
poses, which sites were inspected by these
three committees, acting in concert, and
a carefully prepared report as to their
respective merits was presented to the
Council committee. Later conference
meetings were held by delegates selected
from niae local organizations and the
subject fully discussed, these organiza
tions representing all portions of the city,
with a combined membership of probably
2000. At these meetings there was no di
vision of sentiment as to the value of
parks as a factor in a city's growth or
of the importance of prompt action In
this regard being taken by Oakland while
desirable sites may be obtained at a
reasonable outlay. In all of the proceed
ings real estate men have shown public
spirit of the highest order, freely giving
their time, experience and service to fur
thering the object in view, and in no in
stance obtruding their private interests
or appearing as the advocates of any
particular site.
Favored by nature to a remarkable de
gree, Oakland's prosperity, or the lack of
It, depends entirely upon her citizens. I
was in Los Angeles this month and was
amazed to see what the wideawake resi
dents of that city have accomplished in
a pcrrtion of the State far Inferior to this

"What is needed here is a fostering and
encouragement of the disposition recently
manifested in various ways to develop

erected a beautiful fountain that should
serve to allay the thirst of the weary
wayfarer of the future and perpetuate
his name by telling generations yet un
born of the grandeur that was San Fran

The fountain was a magnificent success
that needed only one thing to make it
perfect; that one thing was water.
Now, Mr. Phelan Is building a theater
on a portion of his San Jose property
and, realizing the' Sahara-like thirst that
consumes the average, theatrical musi
cian, he has provided for future emer
gencies by following the example of an
other leader of men, Moses, and has
smote the rock directly on the site of
the prospective theater's orchestra, and,
behold, a natural spring has gushed forth.
Charles P. Hall, the future lessee of the
theater, who is in the city at present, is
somewhat worried as to hjow he will
arrange his orchestra when the building
Is finally completed; several plans have
been suggested to him such as building
a fancy float to cover the watery spare,
providing the musicians with life pre
servers and rubber suits, hiring a marine
band, and one artistic individual has sent
in a letter suggesting: that the space be
left as a pond which shall be stocked
with gold fish and bordered with flowery
paths and used as a promenade between
acts. The most feasible plan and the
one which will probably be adopted is to
organize an orchestra composed of Demo

JULIUS JACOBS AND HART H. NORTH. APPOINTED TO FILL FEDERAL OFFICES.
Julius Jacobs of thin city has been nominated by President IfcKlnley to b^ Assistant Treasurer of the United
States in San Francisco, and Hart H. North has been named local Commissioner of Immigration. Julius
Jacobs is a business man of many years' Btanding In this city, and for years was agent of th.- Germania I Ife In
surance Company. He is at present manager of the Thuringia Insurance Company and has held many positions of
trust during bis career on this coast. Mr. North is a weli-known public man and was an AÂ«Â«=emblyman repre
senting Alameda Connty but a short time ago. He served with particular distinction during the last two sessions
of that body and is now well known among the legal lights of the coast. At present he is engaged in the practice of
his profession, the law.
Glynn were given an airing before the
Grand Jury yesterday.
Maloney charged that the demands of
certain copyists were made out for
anounts greater than they had earned
and that the Recorder receives the dif
ference between what was due and
what was collected. At the time that
the accusations were first made Re
corder Glynn denied the charges, and
stated that Maloney was actuated by
a spirit of malice when he made them;
that he was fingered because he was
laid off to give some other man a
chance to make a few dollars, and that
an investigation would show the falsi
ty of the accusations.
Mr. (.ilynn was not called yesterday
to defend his position, but the jury has
evidently determined to sift the mat
ter to the bottom. Maloney was called,

had stated would verify his accusa

tinn?, and also other employes of the
department.
Maloney's testimony was in substance
the same as given in a communication j
to the Board of Supervisors asking for |
an Investigation, which he sent some
time ago.
He said it was a notorious fact about
the Recorder's office that warrants
were raised, and that some one. pre
sumably Mr. Glynn, benefited by the
transaction. His testimony was not
definite as to dates and amounts, but
he swore positively that he knew such
matters had occurred.
Solomon Kampe, who is a member of
the Grand Jury, and who is also the
broker who cashes a large number of
the Recorder's department warrants,
left the Jury room when the case was
taken up, and later was called as a
witness. He testified to having cashed
B large number of demands, some for
large amounts and some for small' but
was not able to'thrc-w any light on the
matter the Jury desires to r*'ach.
Copyists Bllvey, Clark and Hender
son, who were relied upon by Maloney
to bear out his statements, were asked
regarding th<ir knowledge of the trans
actions mentioned, but were decidedly
non-committal. They did not specify
anything that would bear out Ifalon
i y's charges, nor v.;ip their testimony
/favorable to the Recorder. It was
brought out during their examination
that a number of collections had been
taken up in the office, but these were
understood to be voluntary contribu
tions from the employes to assist the
Recorder in making his fight for a
four-year term at the time the tenure
of office of a number of public officials
was before the Supreme Court.
The Jury adjourned without having
taken any action in the matter, and
will hear farther testimony on Thurs
day next, when Recorder Glynn will
probably be given an opportunity to tell
his version of the story.

the alleged purpose of protection from
the dangers of hydraulic mining. Irwin

for traveling and other necessary ex
penses. His hill amounted to about J3OO

draw a warrant for the same, holding
that the statutes did not authorize thil
expenditure. The lower court sustained

Blow at Morse's Detec
tive Agency.
They Claim That His Men Interfere
With Their Busi
ness.
The special policemen of this city
have organized for the purpose of wag
ing war against the patrolmen em
ployed by private detective agencies.
Last night several of them waited on
Chief Lees and announced their inten
tion of asking the Supervisors at their
next meeting to pass an ordinance pro
hibiting the men employed by private
agencies from representing themselves
as special policemen. Attorneys
Sweeny and Treadwell have been re
tained by the regularly appointed spe
cials to appear before the Supervisors
and champion their cause.
"It is war to the knife," remarked
j Sweeny last nigrht, "and I feel confi-
I dent that we will win. The private
I detective agencies of this city have no
legal existence, and why they should
attempl to usurp th<> places of ni~n
who have been regularly appointed by
the Police Commissioners seems be
yond comprehension. Such is the fact,
however.
Ap soon as a special policeman man
ages to make his beat a paying one
some private watchman in the employ
of a detective agency appears on th|
scene, and by representing that he is ..
special officer, appointed by the Police
Commissioners, he manages to cut in
on him. Only recently several of
Harry Morse's men rsnTSÃSlfl th>
down-town beats, and by claiming
that they had the powers of a special
officer, took away a portion of the bus
iness belonging to the special on the
beat.
"The special officers appointed by the
Police Commissioners have been put to
the extra expense of providing them
selves with suitable uniforms. They
regard the determined effort of Morse's
men to interfere with them as nothing
short of a high-handed outrage. Real
izing they could do nothing without or
ganizing, the specials several weeks ago
formed themselves into a body for the
betterment of their condition. They
are determined to find out whether
private watchmen have the right to
represent themselves as special officers
when they have absolutely no author
ity. At the next meeting of the Su
pervisors a concerted effort will be
made to have an ordinance passed
having for its objects the protection of
special policemen appointed by the
Board of Police Commissioners."
AN EVENING OF PICTURES.
A Successful fiffalr Given in flid
of Grace M. E. Church.
A large number of guests assembled at
the residence of Mrs. A. D. Mclntyre on
1 Bartlctt street last night, attracted by an
j Interesting entertainment given In aid of
the debt-paying society of Grace Method
| ist Episcopal Church.
On the walls of the parlors were hung
some fifty beautiful etchings and water
| colors, and these were auctioned off later
In the evening by Professor Newton, and
In this way quite a tidy sum was realized
in addition to the regular proceeds of the
entertainment, which will all be applied
toward clearing on* the debt or the
church. A good programme of music and
a supper completed the entertainment

WHERE WAS DR. SCHENK?
A Pugilist Whose Hopes of Family Greatness
Were Dispelled.
Of all sad words of tongue or pen.
The saddest are these: "It might have been."
Gus Herget Is sadâ sad even unto a solemnity that will permit only of a
wan, flickering smile at the catchiest of quips and jokes. Whtttler's fam
ous couplet, if painted In crimson letters on a white transparency, with the
dark shadow of Dr. Schenk looming up in the background, would aptly tell
the whole storyâ a story so anguishing that tears of sympathy cannot fall to
flow from the eyes of a hardened public, listening with bated breath.
Now, Dr. Schenk, as everybody knows, has recently pinnacled himself on
the mount of fame by announcing to an eagerly awaiting world that he
has made a discovery (let it be whispered) regulating the sexes at birth.
And Gus Herget, as all of pugrdom knows. Is a brother of "Young Mitch
ell," celebrated as a retired pugilist of note, and himself posesssing a fair
reputation as a ringster. Gustavus has a grievance against Dr. Schenkâ a
feeling that he has not been well treated by the great physician. 'Yes. it
is. on account of the discovery, too, or, rather, on account of Its tardy
announcement, which is nearer the truth.
"If we had only heard of that thing a little bit quicker," as "Young
Mitchell" naively explains, "the land would have been brightened by the
birth of two vigorous young scrappers. "Who knows what that might
have meant? Thunder and Mars! Ono of them might even have been the
coming Fitzsimmons. Oh, it makes me tired to think of the darned affair: ".
It was on the morning of the 19th inst. that Mitchell bustled into his
saloon, and, missing his brother from his accustomed place behind the
bar, inquired, "Where is Gus?"
"Oh," answered the man in charge, with a grin, "he sent up word that
he wouldn't be here to-day. They're expecting a new arrival down at his
house, I believe."
"Ha, ha!" laughed Mitchell. "Is that so? Well, I hope it's a boy; I hope
it's a boy." And the former exponent of the manly art pranced around like
a schoolboy, feeling the biceps muscle of his right arm, "We'll make a
scrapper of him that the country will bow to one of these fine days."
Phil Hastings, who happened In at this juncture and learned the cause
of the exultation, wanted to bet that it would be twins, and the thought
so tickled the fancy of Mitchell that he "set 'em up" for all hands.
A few days afterward Gus was in his accustomed place, glum and si
lent. He didn't look as happy as was to be expected, and, for that matter,
neither did his brother. Hastings happened in during the day, and, seeing
Herget. extended his hand. It was received and shakrn without a word.
"What's tlie trouble?" inquired the theatrical man. "How's the kid? "
"Ki'l?" was the disgusted retort. You'd better say 'kids.' They're
twinsâ both girls."
The other day both and Herget were observed deeply inter
ested in a copy of The Call, one reading over the other's shoulder. Finally
they laid the paper down. Tnen both sighed. Not a word was said, but
both men slowly extended their hands, Herget looking heartbroken and
Mitchell's countenance wearing a look at once indicative of commiseration
and resignation,
A bystander quietly picked the paper up. There, bearing telltale thumb
marks, was the announcement of Schenk's discovery, with great, flaring

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. There were a number
of features of aggressive strength in to-day's
stock market, but there was also evidences
that the sustaining force of these special stocks
was taken advantage of to sell out heavy lines
of other stocks* to realize profits. The center
of interest in the market continued to be New
York Central. The persistent advance In this
stock is attributed very generally In the street
to Inside buying, and the reports of a pending
plan for the merging of Lake Shore and New
.York Central find very general credence. All
sorts of rumors are constantly coming in, pro
fessing to give in detail the plans for the first
merging and also for the consolidation of vari
ous other Vanderbllt properties, but no official
or authoritative announcement has been made,
nor is one expected. The advance in New
York Central was twice arrested during the
day by reactions. Large absorption of stock
which developed before the decline had reached
great length was suggested by the probability
that the reaction was manipulated In the inter
est of those seeking to acquire stock. Lake
Shore yielded 14 of Its extreme advance of 2%
before the close. It Is noticeable that the Van
derbllt stocks closed below last night's final
price. Northern Pacific preferred. Kansas and
Texas preferred and Rock Island were leaders
of the market in conjunction with New York
Central. There were not lacking other fea
tures of strength In the market, and the New
York transit companies were conspicuous for
a sudden and sharp advance In the final hour
â London had a large account In the local mar
ket to-day, and on the Bide of the sales there
â was a balance of over 30,000 shares. Sterling
exchange responded to the "London selling with
a rather firmer tone. There was no hardening
tendency In the local money market. The
close was Irregular..

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock j
markets here were of better tone to-day, Amer
j icans and Argentines being the feature. Amer
j leans, which closed at best, are practically
booming;. The support is mainly from New j
j York, but professional dealings here are
j strong and increasing. It is believed here
I that the Teller silver resolution will pass the 1
i United States Senate, but the kind of profes- j
j sionals now dealing in Americans is too used j
I to that sort of thing to be upset by It. The '
Lake Shore and New York Central "were very
strong. Grand Trunk was lower. Bank of
England stock Is the highest f^Â»r touched.
â  It will be interesting to note the effect on the
half year's profits of the bank's recent policy.
Copper shares are recovering. The local dis
count market continues very firm, and all the
Continental exchanges are rising. It is. how
ever, rumored that more Japanese money will
be released at the end of the week.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 27.â Liverpool once again set
the pace for wheat at the opening. The mar
ket was up *4t?Uid on futures, and cables from
there and from London also were decidedly
bullish In tone. The British Consul at Kief, :
South Russia, officially Bald that Russia would
probably soon have to become an importer of :
grain; that the Russian ports were closing i
again, 'and that a cargo of Argentine wheat, ,
February shipment, had been sold to-day at j
35s 3d per quarter, an advance equivalent , to !
S'4c a bushel In two weeks. The Russian news
had more effect later In the day than at the !
opening, which was nevertheless very strong. |
May closed yesterday at 94\c and opened to- :
day at 94>4 / *z94V. while July started H'SHc i
higher at from 86H'C?^6c. ThÂ« opening advance ;
encountered very free realizing, some of which
was credited to Letter, but the selling resulted ;
In the May price only reacting to KCiKttlc, and
for two hours a fight 'wan waged around 95.; c
for control of the market, News that came j
In during that time almost altogether favored j
an advance. Minneapolis reported a heavy de
mand for flour, . especially foreign shipment,
and Tacoma advised continued shipments of
flour and wheat to South Africa. Export clear- (
ances â of , wheat and flour from the Atlantic .
ports amounted to the heavy total of BUO.OOO :
bushels. - About midday, and after the receipt !
of strong closing cables, the fun commenced, i
and for the third day In succession January I
furnished the sensation. Up to that time the
delivery had been heard of but seldom. Loiter
broken again appeared in the pit, and their I
bids of $1 02 for January, 2c above yesterday's
closing price, started shorts In - the futures in
a hurry, and the price of May especially ad- '
vanced almost as fact as the cash figures did.
For a few minutes the excitement -nan intense .
and the hunt for cover which took place i
jumped May to 96c. January in the mean '
time being , quoted at $1 02 1 *- The market |
quieted down somewhat for a time, but about '
half an hour from the close the buying fever j
again broke out as the Jumpfng of January
was renewed. In a very short space of time
January was bid up to $1 05, May to 97% c and
July .to 87Hc. These prices hung with heavy i
trading. At the close January was quoted at I
II 04%, May at 97HÂ©97Â«c and July at 87Hc. A
New York message received shortly after noon â 
said that Leiter had sold 2,000,000 bushels of i
wheat for shipment abroad.
Corn was active and firm throughout. May
closed %c higher.
Oats were strong, and higher. May closed
.VigHc higher.
The heaviest trading In the pit was In pro- !
visions. The close was firm. May pork 7>*c

THE ORANGE MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 27â The Journal of Com
merce says: In oranges trade Is light. Sup
plies of Valencies were never Â»o small at this
season, but there seems to be no demand and
prices quoted are nominal. Advices from the
other side are to the effect that supplies could
not be renewed at present quotations. Sicily
oranges are in small stock and little on the
way. but there seems to be no demand. Cali
fornia oranges are still arriving quite freely, '
but are bringing satisfactory prices at auc
tlon. and jobbing quotations are maintained.
In Florida oranges the firm feeling Is main- ;
tamed, but there is not much business to re- |
port. Spot prices for dried fruits are, and for 'â 
some time have been, below parity with quo- !
tatlons on the Pacific Coast. The lower price i
held is explained by receivers as having been
caused by free early purchases In California ,
at comparatively lower figures In expectation
of a large consuming demand, which expecta
tion was based on the small stocks controlled
by retailers. The expected demand from con
sumers did not materialize and holders here,
finding themselves overstocked, were ready to
shade prices somewhat In order to move out
stocks. They have, however, it is said, been
unwilling to release any large blocks except
at full figures.
The consuming trade In Eastern markets. It
Is now reported is beginning to Increase,
though still below expectations. In the West
and Middle West, however, It is understood
that the bulk of distribution through consum
ing channels is now being made, and it is be
cause of the demand from that quarter, re
ports state, that holders on the coast are able
to maintain their views nu. only on Santa
<"lara but on Northern and Southern fruit,
the demand from the West for the two last
named being, it is recited, very good. Specu
lative movement, to which Is attributed the
stronger feeling In this market, has, it is
understood, resulted In a closer concentration
of spot supplies, but there seems still to be
enough competition to prevent this market
from advancing from a parity with Cali
fornia.
LONDON WOOL BALES.
LONDON, Jan. 27.â There were 15,574 bales
offered at the wool sale to-day, with a good
selection. Prices were fairly maintained,
though medium cross-breds were somewhat Ir
regular. Port Philip greasy merinos attracted
much attention and there was strong: competi
tion for New Zealand lustrous cross-breds. A
large supply of Mips went principally to the
home trade. France competed spiritedly with
Germany for their speclalltes.
There was a rood supply of Cape of Good
Hope and Natal, but here the withdrawals
were frequent. Snow whites and scour*ds
went to the Continent at full prices. A quan
tity of South Australian In fine condition was
secured by America and Yorkshire. The pur
chases for America were limited to 700- bales.

it will require a further advance In wheat

SAM JONES AND TALMAGE.
Sam Jones is the embodiment of an
audacity that sometimes comes very
near the border line of discourtesy. A
I clergyman who often assists him in his
series of meetings told me the other
day this story in the early history of !
Mr. Jones' evangelistic work: He was
i invited by Dr. Talma^e to hold a series
\ of meetiners in the doctor's Brooklyn
j church. Mr. Jones went to Dr. Tal
| mage's horre during the afternoon of
j the day on which his engagement be
i gan and introduced himself. Mr. Tal
: mage looked him over and was evident
ly a little taken aback at the rather
shabby appearance of the evangelist.
As it approached evening he said:
"Brother Jones, would you take it
amiss if I presented you with a new
, suit of clothes?" "Certainly not," said
the accommodating Samuel. He was
taken to a clothier and fitted from head
to foot, tapping all with a high hat.
At church the doctor introduced him
as the Rev. Samuel P. Jones from
Georgia. Mr. Jones arose with his new
hat In hand and repeated: "Yes; the .
| Rev. Samuel P. Jones from Georgia.'
and added: "And this is the new suit
' of clothes and this the new hat your
pastOT has presented to me. If your !
pastor had as much of the grace of
God In his heart as he has pride, he j
would convert all Brooklyn, and would :
not need me."â Homiletlc Review.

Influential Men Gather hi the Services
of the Day oi Prayer fop
Colleges.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, January 27.
The Day of Prayer for Colleges was
observed at the First Congregational
Church to-day with a unk-n meeting.
The speakers were prominent profes
sors of the State and Stanford univer
sities. Their addresses were listened to
by an appreciative audience, and
among those present were nearly all
of the local pastors and professors of
the denominational schools located in
this city. The meeting closed to-night
after thre-"> sessions.
The first address was that of Pro
fessor Show of Stanford, his topic be
ing. 'Are the needs of Christian edu
cation adequately met at present on the
Pacific Coast? Are more Christian col
leges needed? Do our universities suf
fice for California?" Among state
ments made by him was the following:
"Christian education differs from any
other education. Christian education is
not simply to advance denominational
interests. The best Christian colleges
of our land are not the narrow kind.
There is as large a place for the de
nominational college as there is for the
denominational paper or church. The
Christian college is well up with the
best State institutions of this land:
in fact, the great State Institutions re
ceived their best Ideas from thf> Chris
tian colleges. Th^ Christian college has
a different environment than the other
colleges. Tn the Christian college it
should bo \h<- easiest thing to become a
Christian and live a Christian life, and
as hard as possible n< >t to be. It is
more important th.it a tt-acher's moral
character be above reproach than that
he or Bhe be of tlv hichest learning.
The school will be what the teachers
are. and Christian colleges should have
Christian professors. The
Christian college town makes a nice
place in which to live. It has ideal
homes for environments.
President Kello^ of the University
of California followed with a plea for
every denomination to erect and main
tain Christian halls in the vicinity of
the State universities. He also wanted
t,, po^. every church in Berkeley have
two pastors, one for the pastoral work
and one to prepare and preach the ser
mons.
The afternoon session opened with
the topic: "The public schools as a fac
tor in church work. Is their influence
helpful? What is the church's oppor
tunity concerning them?" Rev. E. S.
Chapman. D.D.. was the speaker, and
ure-'i a closer connection between the
school and home.
The next topic was: "Moral and re
ligious teaching in schools and col
leges. Can it be increased? Where doeg
the responsibility rest? May such
teaching safely be left to the home and
the church?" Professor Thoburn of
Stanford University was announced for
this subject, but was unable to be pres
ent. Professor Elmer E. Brown of the
University of California accepted an
invitation to speak extemporaneously,
and said in part:
"The history of the modern educa
tional institution is the history of the
changres in the relation of the church
and State. In the expulsion of reli
gious teaching from the public schools
we are dealing with an institutional
relation. I do not believe that we are
mooting to protest against the provi
sions barring ecclesiastical teachings.
The church as a <-hurch nor the doc
trines of a church as doctrines of a
church cannot be recognized in our
great institutions of learning. More
harm has bean <; >ne fighting to intro
duce religious works, prepared for the
â  . Into the schools than
would ever have resulted from the In
troduction of the Bible itself.
SAYS THERE ARE
NO QUICKSANDS
Roberts Claims That the Report
From Washington Is
* Untrue.
Ho Made No Mention of It in the
Statement Sent to the
East.
A communication from "Washington to
the effect that quicksand has been dis
covered on the new postoffice site is de
nied by Superintendent Roberts. He
claims . that he is the only man who
would be authorized in forwarding a re
port to such effect to Washington.
Mr. Roberts gave the following state
ment last night in referring to the tele
gram:
"I do not place the least Importance in
this report as the officials at Washington
v.-ere not notified of the existence of
Quicksands on the permises at Seventh
and Mission streets, because there is not
the least indication of any.
"In the report which I forwarded to
Washing-ton last Saturday I made no
mention nor did I even hint that I had
doubts as to whether there was quick-
Band In the northwest corner of the lot,
as I firmly believe that the soil here, if
not equally as good as in other sections,
is of a character which will stand any
amount of weight without danger of sink
ing.
"Who the author of this report may be
I have not the least idea, but I will be
authority for the fact that it is not true
and did not emanate from me."

FATHER YORKE
ON INDULGENCES
He Defines the Term and Traces
Its Origin Back to
Christ.
Ha Scores tho Idea That They
Are Sold to Peni
tents.
Father Yorke delivered an Intensely in
teresting and instructive lecture before
an immense audience at Mangel Hall last
evening on the subject of indulgence?.
He traced the custom of this commutation
of sin back to the early ages of Chris
tianity and told of its origin, develop
ment, and former abuse by the wicked
tyrants who usurped the Papal authority
and dispensed indulgences in order
to obtain money from penitents on prom
ise of a full remission of punishment for
their transgressions.
The beginning of the lecture was de
voted to the explanation of the term and
a brief definition of what Catholics gen
erally understand by the custom of In
dulgences. "Nothing is so universal as
sin, " said the lecturer, "and the best
of us know that we cannot escape tho
ravages, and that many of us fall short
of what we should be as far as being free
from Bin is concerned. The natural ques
tion arising from this question is what
must we do to cleanse our souls and wipe
away the stain of sin? This is a Ques
tion which has tormented men from the
beginning, and they have done every
thing in their power and have undergone
the most excruciating self-inflicted tor
ments to make compensation for their
v.T'iiitr-doingsi. If there is an all merci
ful God he rannot stand by and see his
creatures suffer such torment and not
put the means of repentonee at their dis
posal. That God is all just and merciful
has been shown by him in sending his son
upon earth to wash away the curse of
mankind."
Father Yorke here touched upon the
subject of the confessional and spoke of
the priest's nfflce as nearly that of a
mediator between man and God, affirming
that nobody had the power of forgiving
sins but the Almighty. "The Catholic
Church has never given the privilege of
committing sin to any man and does not
posseas the power to do so. When the
church grants an indulgence it doesn't
mean that the person to whom It la
granted ran go on a wild rampage and
commit as many Bins as he likes.
THE HALL JURY
HAS DISAGREED
The Accused Will Have to Be
Retried for Mrs. Coak
ley's Murder.
No Verdict Could Be Reached After
Over Nineteen Hours'
Deliberation.
Dr. Samuel Hall, charged with the mur
der of Mrs. I<Jb Coakley, will have to be

being out over nineteen hours, the jury
that for several days listened to the testi
mony introduced in the trial, Informed
Judge Dunne that a verdict could not be
reached. The court then ordered the Jury
discharged.
The argument !n the trial of Hall closed
shortly before 5 o'clock Wednesday after
noon, and the fate of the prisoner was
left In the hands of the jury. At 11
o'clock Judpe Dunne ordered the jury
locked up for the night. At noon yester
day, however, the jury became wearlrd
from Its long: deliberation and Informed
the court that It could not reach a ver
dict. It was then discharged.

understood that seven voted for acquittal
while five stood out for conviction it
will probabjy be many weeks before the
case iB retried, pnd In the meantime Hall
will probably remain in the custody of the
Sheriff.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, IS9S.
FLOOD'S PLEA
FOR PARDON
Story of a Remarkable
Defalcation Vividly-
Recalled.
Defaulting Cashier Confessed,
but Told a Strange Story
of Shielding Others.
Stockholders oTthe Bank Were Never
Called Upon to Pay Any Portion
or the Loss of 5146.000.
The application now pending before
the Board of Stato Prison Directors foT
the pardon of John W. Flood recalls
he story of a remarkable defalcation.
Flood was the trusted cashier of the
old banking house of Donohoe, Kelly &
Co. One day the surprising revelation
was made that he had taken $166,000
of the bank's money. The founders of
the bank could hardly believe the state
ment when the positive proof was pre
sented to them.
To make a long story short Flood !
confessed to the embezzlement, but de
clared the money was taken to protect
others, but he declined to reveal the
identity of the person or persons about
whom he had thrown the mantle of
protecting silence. Mystery was there
fore added to the wrongdoing. After
considerable delay In court Flood was
convicted, sentenced and sent to San
Quentin Prison, where he has been con- j
fined for nearly four years.
The bank obtained property In the i
possession of Flood amounting In value â 
to $20,000. The remaining deficit of $146,
000 was paid by the families, respect
ively, of Mr. Donohoe and Mr. Kelly.
The stockholders of the bank were nev
er called upon to sustain any part of ''
the loss. A few days a?o the bank
consented to the release of an attach
ment on th<* home of Flood.
When Flood went before the prison
directors to make a statement in his
own behalf and present the reasons for
asking that a pardon be granted he
told pretty much the same story that
he gave to the managers of the bank
at the time the defalcation was dis
closed. He declined, as in the first in
stance, to disclose the Identity of the
person or persons for whom the money
was taken.
A vague hint was once thrown out
that the eon-in-law of a well-known
I nitcd States Senator failed to make
gc^od a large sum of money which
Flood advanced to him to cover an in-
Ktant emergency at the office of a
broker: but this man who wns reported
to have been assisted by Flood's con
fidence and generority trvit* tie ru
mor with playful scorn, observing that
no one would think of crediting him
with one-tenth of the sum mentioned
by Flood.
No steps have been taken by any onp
representing the bank or speaking for
the families of the men who founded
the banking institution to plnrp n sin
gle obstacle in the wÂ«iy of Flood's par
ti-. -n. Since thf trial and conviction of
Fl';od the venerable bai.kers, Mr. Pon
<>hoe and Mr Kelly, li.^vf been gath
cied to their fathers. To tho last they
cherished no feeling of resentment or
animosity toward the trusted employe
who had so grievousiy betrayed the
confidence which* they had reposed in
him, nor do their descendants harbor
any ill-will toward the old and broken
down cashier now serving a term in
San Qucntin. The law will take its
course without any suggestion or in
dication from the bank. Flood was in
the service of Donohoe & Kelly for
twenty years. HÂ» is now about 67
years of agre, and two years of his sen
tence to imprisonment remain to be
served.
Tho story that the defaulter took the
money to shield some person or persons
from dlsprace and exposure is not cred
ited by men familiar with the circum
stances of the defalcation. The pecu
lations covered a period of years, as the
doctored books Indicated.
FROM ASYLUM TO
A PRISON CELL
Mrs. Lydia P. Wilson Now
Trial for the Murder of
Her Husband.
The Tragedy Occurred Over Three
Years Ago â The Defendant Sub
sequently Sent to Agnews.
From the madhouse to prison, then to
the courtroom to be tried for the murder
|of her husband. Such is the story of the
last three years of the life of Mrs. Lydia
P. Wilson.
On the night of September 25, 1594,
; Henry Wilson, a seafaring man, was
j found dead at his home on Powell street.
; A bullet hole in his right temple told the
j story of a murder, but who had been his
slayer for a time remained a mystery.
His wife, Lydia P. Wilson, was finally
suspected and placed under arrest. Dur
ing her preliminary examination Bhe
manifested signs of insanity and the
Commissioners of Lunacy examined her.
Bhe was found to be mentally deranged
and was sent to Agnews Asylum for
j treatment.
For several months her condition re
mained the same, but about a year ago
she began to improve and a short tlmo
ago she was declared mentally Bound
Sho waa discharged from the asylum and
was turned over to the authorities of this
city that the charge of murder against
her might be disposed of.
Yesterday her case was called in Judge
Dunne's department and by 11 o'clock the
jury had been selected and the prosecu
tion opened its case.
The first witness called was A. Cohen
He testified that shortly before the mur
der of Henry Wilson he sold the prisoner
a revolver. She told him that "hoods"
were annoying her and she wanted a
weapon with which to protect herself
Cohen said that she acted strangely and
he told her not to shoot any one and she
promised him thct she would not.
R. J. Horn, a stock broker, was the
next witness called. Mrs. Wilson had
visited him many times, he said, and told
1 him that her husband was conspiring
with others to get possession of some
; stock she had in her possession. The
stock was valueless, and owing to this
; fact he believed that she was insarie
During the afternoon I;r. F. L. Emer
; son was the most important witness
called. He testified as to the wound
! producing the death of Wilson and said
; that it might have been self-inflicted.
Many otner witnesses were put on the
stand is the afternoon, but their testi
mony was unimportant.
WRANGLING OVER ATHLETICS.
Wordy War Being Waged in the
Columns of the Californian.
BERKELEY. Jan. 27.â Dr. Robert Por
ter, who played fullback on the Univer
sity of California eleven of '94, in a com
munication in to-day's Californlan de
fends ex-Coach Nott against the recent
charges of incapacity and questions the
wisdom of engaging Cochran of Prince
ton as coach. "Our football salvation,"
he declares, "is not to come alone from
the Importation of the great Cochran."
Editor Creed of the college daily re
torts to Porter's letter, which he charac
terizes as a "monumeit of inconsisten
cies." "As a sort of welcome to Garrett
Cochran," he says, "he points out men
who would make bettor coaches. It is
our opinion that Cochran will noe be dis
couraged by criticisms of hJs selection
before he has had an opportunity of de
fending himself ly his work on the field,
but it is a hit amusing to undergraduates
to find their censors guilty of faults iden
tical with their own."

ager Everett J. Brown to give an ex
planation of his denunciation yesterday
of the faculty athletics committee. Just
What action will be taken by the faculty
in regard to Brown President Kellogg
was unable this afternoon to tell. He
stilted that thus far no official action had
been taken. Considerable feeling has b^en
aroused among the students by the pres
ent athletic controversy, and a meeting
of the associated students will probably
be held Monday to consider the question
of reorganizing the athletic committee of
the faculty.
One Jap Pays Mis Tuition Fee.
ALAMKDA, Jan. 27.â Jiro Harada, one
of the Japanese students at the high
school who was dismissed on 'account of
being a legal non-resident, has complied
with the law requiring tuition fees from
such pupils, has paid his dues and gone
back to P<hool. He is in the junior class
of the school and acknowledges the jus
tice of the law requiring him to pay for
his education. The others, however, have
niaJe no move as yet toward paying for
the privilege of attending the public
schools.
TO OUST OR
NOT TO OUST
The Impending Democratic
Crisis of Factional
Strife.
A New Prospect That the Local Mess
Will Be Dragged Into the
Arena.
The prosprcti\e battle at the opening
of the meeting of the Democratic State
Central Committee on Saturday is en
grossing the interest of the Democratic
politicians. Every member who appears
in the city is quickly interviewed and the
hustling for proxies goes on.
Nobody ie certain what will be done or
attempted c^e^ming the dropping of
forty-two members who did not pay the
$30 campaign apsessmtnt or about the
local s=i'lit in the party. These are the
matters that will put ginger into the
meeting antl about which the factional
quarrels ra^o. and beside them the larger
matters of party policy and action seem
tame nm\ Inconsequential.
That there will be a determined effort
to declare the delinquents off the roll Ap
pears certain. Should the measure be
driven through the question of whether
the State Central Committee or the
County and Congressional District com
mittees should fill the vacancies would
rise, and therein would come to the front
at once the local situation- Which is the
local Democratic committee?
The list of the members who didn't
come up with- S3O when the Bryan cause
needed $30 contains the names of some
stalwart Democrats. At the very head
of the list is Eugene N. Deuprey, but he
made speeches and would escape, as
would ('lit us Barbour, another friend of

mates on the Government figures, we
think we now own every bushel of surplus
wheat in this country."
G. E. French, the active manager of the
big wheat combination, was speaking for
himself and Joseph Lelter, who is the vis
ible head of the "clique."
He said further: "According to the
most reliable estimates obtainable we
think there is not more than 15,000,000
bushels of wheat unaccounted for. Scat
tered over different parts of the country
we have holdings of at least that amount,
co we can safely claim to have possession
of all the surplus."

LAW OF LIBEL
WELL DEFINED
Supreme Justice Garoutte Up-
holds the Liberty of the
Press.
There Is No Slander if the Charges
Are Proved to Have Been
True.
Justice Garoutte of the Supreme Court
yesterday rendered a judgment in the
case of Dr. Joseph C. Hearne aga'nst
M. H. de Young, proprietor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, and J. F. Brunt, the
San Diego correspondent of that journal,
in which he interprets the law of libel in
a very clear-cut manner.
The case was on appeal from a Judg
ment based upon a verdict of a jury
awarding Dr. IK-arne the sum of $10,000
for the publication of an alleged libel in
; the paper named. The article dealt with
| two occurrences, happening at different
times and at different places. The first
i statement of the alleged libel set forth
1 that Mrs. Hearne had sued her husband
i tor divorce, which was grained; that her
; complaint was that of cruelty, and that
' the testimony at the trial showed that
the doctor was a man of ungovernable
temper, and when in a rage he would
hurl dishes at his wife, besides using vile
anJ abusive language.
The second part was the publication of
incidents concerning the murder of Amos
J. Stillwell In ISBS, In Hannibal, Mo., the
! article stating that the facts were taken
j from newspapers of Hannibul and Kan
sas City. In this it was set forth that
I robbery was not the motive, and that Dr.
Hearne was the family physician and was
the iirst to discover the crime and
awaken the servants. Dr. Hearne some
time afterward married the widow of the
murdered Still well, and she was the one
who sued for divorce.
In Hearne's libel case he set forth that
the first publication was untrue and that
no testimony was given that he hurled
dishes at his wife. Relative to the sec
ond, he complained that the reference to
the murder of Btillwell insinuated that
he was the murderer or accessory; also
that malice was the underlying motive
for the publication complained of. At the
trial -of the case the defendants denied
that they were actuated by malice and
they proved that the witnesses testified
that the doctor was violent and that he
had hurled various articles at his wife.
i although some of his testimony was ruled
: out by the court. They further declared
that there was no insinuation that
lltarne had murdered Stillwell. Justice
! Ciaroutte took the broad interpretation of
the law when he said:
"It Is well settled that a defendant is
not required in an action of slander or
libel to justify every word of the alleged
; defamatory matter. It is sufficient if the
substance, the gist, the sting of the libel
: ous charge be justified. Immaterial vari
ances and defects of proof upon material
matters go for nothing, and if the gist of
the charge is established by the evidence
â  the defendant has made his case."
The Justice also holds that the lower
i court should have allowed the defendants
j the privilege of proving the truth of the
I charges, if such they could be called, in
; the article complained of. In other words,
that the publisher should have been per
mitted to have made the best defense hÂ«
could to show that he was not guilty of
the charge of which he was accused. Of
tho alleged insinuation* that the doctor
murdered Stillwell the Justice says that
the published language was plain and
contained no covert meaning, and there
fore was not libelous. The judgment and
order wero reversed and the case was r*.
! manded for a new trial. This will prac
tically throw the matter out of court.
HE PRAISES THE
FIRE DEPARTMENT
What Ex-Chief Regan of Boston
Has to Say About the
Local System.
He Is Touring the World and Study
ing the Various Systems of the
Different Countries.
John TV*. Regan, the ex-First Assist
ant Chief of the Fire Department of
Boston, who is making a tour of the
world for the purpose of recuperating
his health and securing 1 notes upon the
various systems used by the different
Fire Departments of the large cities of
the world, has been In San Francisco
since "Wednesday morning. The
greater part of this time he has been
the guest of Chief T. D. Sullivan of this
city, who has done all In his power to
make Mr. Regan's stay a pleasant one
besides giving him every opportunity
to investigate the system used in the
city Fire Department.
Mr. Regan talked freely about his
tour. He is making it at the expense
of the merchants of Boston, who
wished thus to make some acknowl
edgment to him for his forty-three
years of faithful service in protecting
their interests from the ravages of
flames. He left his native city the
early part of this month and has visit
ed Chicago, the principal cities of Neb
raska, Denver, Colorado Springs and
Salt Lake City.
In speaking of San Francisco and its
Fire Department he said: "No words
of mine can too greatly praise the Fire
Department of San Francisco. Its
Chief, officers and general equipment
are second to that of no city in this
land. I regret exceedingly that I did
not follow my original intention and
come directly to this city. I wanted to
spend two months here. I leave here
to-day on the steamer Peru for Hono
lulu. I shall go through China, India,
Egypt and Europe."
Mr. Regan Is 62 years of age. He is
six feet tall, of slight build and has a
gray beard and mustache. He Is most
affable In his manner, is well informed
and a fluent conversationalist.
At 10 a. m. yesterday he was
the guest of Chief Sullivan to witness
the testing of the three new La France
steam fire engines recently purchased
by ihe Fire Commissioners. The test
was made at the Lombard street
wharf.
Mr. Regan is accompanied upon his
tour by his wife. They were among
the passengers who were aboard the
Central Pacific train that was re
cently wrecked near Colfax.
In the Divorce Courts.
Oliver M. Dunton. an engineer by occu
pation, was granted a divorce from his
wife. Margaret Dunton, by Judge Slack
yesterday. The decree was granted on
the ground of desertion. In January of
last year Mrs. Dunton sued her husband
for a divorce on the ground of extreme
cruelty, but as her allegations were not
substantiated a divorce was denied her.
Subsequently Dunton filed suit for divorce
against his wife for an annulment of their
marriage, alleging desertion, and a decree
was given him.
Laura J. Martin was granted a divorce
from James H. Martin l>v Juri^e liahrs
yesterday on tho ground of desertion. The
custody of the minor children was grant
ed the plaintiff.

A PHENOMENAL
MAIDEN RACER
Maxello Defeats Dr. Sharp
and Lord Marmion at
Great Odds.
The Roman Finished a Nose
Ahead of Morellito in the
Handicap.
Satsuma in Rare Good Form-Favor
ites First on Three Occasions.
Joe Ullman Scored Easily.
A rod in pickle from the famed Hag
gin "grant" was given a trial at Ingle
side yesterday. The rod in question
was a grand-looking three-year-old bay
colt named Maxello, a son of the dead
sire Maxim and Daniella. He had nev
er sported silk before, and was one of
the six starters in the last race of the
day, a six-furlong sprint. Although
Walter Jennings, in whose colors the
youngster ran. has sprung a number
<rt "hot ones" since the season opened,
it seemed like asking too much of a
maiden to down such fast ones as Lord
Jlarmion and Dr. Sharp. The former
was a l-to-2 chance in the betting, and
the short-enders unloaded on him.
Against Maxello anywhere from 40 to
100 to 1 was obtainable. Lonnie Clay
ton had the mount on the latter, and,
getting him away in front, was
never caught, winning by a
length from Dr. Sharp. Thorpe
did not get the favorite away
from the post any too well, and killed
him off chasing the leader. The win
ner covered the distance in I:l4)4, which
shows him to have been a very shifty
maiden.
Aside from this unexpected perform
ance the first choices did fairly well,
â winning three events.- Lonxiie Clayton
piloted two "f the winners.
The Elmwood Farms good colt, The
Roman, proved himself to be made of
the right port of metal by his grand
showing in the mile and a quarter
handicap. He picked up 119 pounds,
and after a nnÂ»st uneven voyage, dur
ing the greater part of which Willie
Martin had him pocketed, he came with
a great rush at the end, snatching vic
tory by a nose from MorelUto, ridden
out to the last ounce by "Skeets" Mar
tin. The latter coit, just turned a
three-year-.>ld, is entitled to fully as
much credit as the winner, for he was
aeked to carry 103 pounds, one pound
less than his entitled weight, and com
ing on fr"m fourth position at the head
of the stretch fcufcht it out in the sam
est possible fashion, being beaten out
only on th^ hist stride. The winner's
time â 2: 07^ â is now the Ingleside track
record. 'Ostler Joe was leading up to
the last sixteenth, when he stopped
badly under his poor piloting.
The Corrigan entry. Geyser, was
scratched from the opening mile event,
and Satsuma, with Thorpe up. was sent
out a 3-to--4 favorite. (iarland Barr
and Judge Denny led to the stretch,
where the favorite shot to the front
and won with ease from Imp. Tripping,
poorly ridden by Clayton. There was
no pace the first part, which accounts
for the slow time â 1:42%.
The fast colt Official took the sec
ond event, a six-furhmg sprint, in a
driving finish from Chihuahua, and
Owner Tully Coulter was compelled to
stand a $400 boost. Chihuahua rushed
to the front at the start, and was only
nosed out the last jump by the Coulter
entry, whirh ruled an even-money fa
vorite in the betting. The winner was
piloted by young Gray. Good Friend
ran a vastly Imprwed race on-er his
former attempt, finishing third.
On Tuesday joe CTllman. with "Willie
Martin in the saddle, was beaten by
Kamsin in a six-furlonc run, won by
Kamsln in the slow time of 1:17 U.
Eacked down in the mile and a six
teenth run of yesterday from 5<4 to 1
to 9 to 2, he made the running, and
miide a fairly good ik-ld look like a
band of "crabs." Palmocita, the favor
ite, kno-cked about considerably, came
fast at the end, taking the place from
Meadow Lark.
Myth, carrying the colors of Kittle
man Bros., was a pounds better horse
than he was on Tuesday, and, starting
a mild 3-to-l favorite for the mile and
a sixteenth selling run, fifth on the
card, made an end to end affair of it,
beating out Fashion Plate a neck in

retained his colt.
Away none too well at best. Lord Marmion !
was Interfered with by Libertine soon after ;
the barrier was released, which did 'not help i
his chances to any great extent.
Daggle Smith was disgusted with thÂ« show-
Ing made by Hermanlta, and after the race
said that If anybody wanted a cheap race
horse to go ovor to his stable with a few dol- ;
lars and pet the brown mare.
Under any ordinary conditions Fashion Plate |
would have captured the mile and a sixteenth ;
without effort. She was last of her field down
the back stretch, but made a run to the wire ;
that was nothing short of phenomenal.
When Willie Martin pulled The Roman up 1
after the finish to the handicap he appeared
to be very Inme, and It was the general im
pression that the rolt had broken down. He
simply struck himself in easing up and five
minutes later was none the worse for wear.

PACIFIC-UNION
LADIES' ANNEX
A Meeting Called to Discuss the
Admission of the Gen
tler Sex. ,
ThÂ«Â» progressive element In the Paclflr-
Vnion Club seems determined to have a
ladies' annex to the organization. A
meetir.gr of all the members Js to be. held
next Wednesday to discuss the matter,
and there seems to be no doubt but that
the popular measure will be carried and
the ladies will be allowed within the sac
red portal of the exclusive Paciflc-l'nion.
Whfn the club contemplated moving
from its present quarters on Union square
to a new building to be erected on Van
NeM avenue, the ladies' annex was one of
the innovations to be made. Everybody
was in favor of the change and in the
plans for the new building, splendid quar
ters were set apart for the ladles. The
whole matter fell to the gorund. how
ever, and the subject of the annex was
dropped.
But it was only dropped for a time,
.is the progressive element in the
club was not sure but th;it it might In
time carry its point and have tht- new
building erected on Van Ness avenue.
These members have now. however, ap
parently come to the conclusion that it
will he a long time before the Van NeM
scheme is an accomplished fact, so they
haV6 decided to have a ladies' annex in
their present quarters. The principal thing
to be discussed will be the location and
the flttinp up of the domain for the ladies.
and <>nee that is agreed upon everything
else will be settled in short order.
The ladies' annex to the T'niversity
Club was a success from the start, and it
is thought the ladles' annex to the Pa
cific-Union, if it be established, will be
one of the most popular and the most
exclusive gathering places In the city.
THE SAy rKAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JAXTARY 28, 1898.
RED AND RARE
ROSES THERE
Surveyor Spear Took Charge
of His Office Amid Floral
Offerings.
His First Act Was the Appointment
of St. John â Presentation to
Mr. English.
The sensuous fragrance of ros&s, with
intermittent whiffs of the violet's per
fume, pleasantly greeted the senses and
surprised the visitors to the Custom
! House yesterday morning. It was some
thing of the esthetic, something most un
! usual in the dull, dry. uncarpeted room,
, and when the eyes, steered by the nose,
: followed up the trail of the agreeable
j odor they rested upon three baskets of
pretty flowers, done up in pink and scar
| let ribbon, lying on the desk of the Sur
veyor of the Port. There were La France
i and more deeply blushing roses of other
i varieties, fresh from the hothouse, and
, pink and white carnations and violets,
crisp and strong, with the invigorating
i kiss of the frosty sunshine. For greenery
there were the "delicate maidenhair and
its robust cousin, the mountain fern. The
prettiest and largest basket was the gift
of Mrs. Spear.
It was evident that something agreeable
had happened. Behind the desk was
, Chauncey M. St. John, with a pink car
i nation in the lapel of his double-breasted
frock coat and a smile on his face.
t Joseph S. Spear Jr..thenewly appointed
Surveyor of the Port, was tht-re also, ami
happy. Both he and ex-Surveyor Eng
lish had received telegrams from the
Treasury Department in Washington
shortly after the opening of the Custom
House instructing Mr. English to retire
and Mr. Spear to t:ik>' hoML
The lirst official act of the new Surveyor
after taking possession of the office was
to appoint Chauncey M. St. John as
Deputy Surveyor.
"Th("-re will" be no further changes
said Surveyor Spear, "and the affairs or
the office will be conducted as usual."
A"\ half-past :. o'clock the retiring Sur
veyor. William D. English, was presented
with a kol<l watch and chain and locket.

of esteem on the part of tho employes ol
th<- Surveyor's office. All the departments
of the <"ustorn House were repret

FEATS OF STRENGTH & SKILL & BLOSSOMS FOR THE JUBILEE
ONE of the most creditable of the
series of Golden Jubilee attrac
tions of this Jubilee week was
the gymnastic exhibition given
at Woodward's Pavilion last
night by the combined Turner so
cietles of San Francisco and Oakland.
The programme was one which appeal
ed strongly to the taste of all who
admire manly strength and feats of
skill, and it was greatly enjoyed by a
large crowd of spectators. The even
ing's exercises were opened by th^ en
tree of fifty members of the San Fran
cisco Turn Verein, who were given an
ovation as they marched with stately
tread around the main floor.
Dr. Max Magnus made a stirring ad
dress of welcome in the German tongue,
in which he highly eulogized the Tur
ners for their encouragement of manly
development and their loyalty as citi
zens and the Germans in general for
their noble contribution to the material
interests of the commonwealth.
The dumb-bell drill, by thirty mem
bers of the San Francisco Turn Verein,
was a revelation in fancy calisthen
ics. The figures were the creation of
Professor Barth, instructor of physical
culture of this organization, and they
were executed to perfection, winning
great applause.
The parallel bar exercise, by eight
members of the Mission Turn Verein,
included many difficult feats, all per
fc-rmed in faultless style, several of the
performers showing grace and agility

Arrangements for the opening night
of the Mining Fair are progressing with
marvelous rapidity. Invitations have
been extended to gome 10,000 people to
assist in the celebration, and they will
represent every interest concerned.
Marshall's four companions, who are at
present in the city, have been special
ly invited by the management, in addi
tion to Governor John Bidwell of Chico.
They will be given the seats of honor
on the grand stand. In addition to
these, Governor Budd, Lieutenant-
seldom found outside the professional
ranks.
Some very thrilling exhibitions in
fencing were given â with foils, by
Messrs. Stefflns and Stahl of the Ein
tracht Turn Section: with rapiers, by
Messrs. Mueller and Rosenberg of the
San Francisco Turn Verein, and with
bayonets, by Messrs. Hetzel and Hoff
man <>f the Deutscher Krieger Verein,
all of wham showed themselves highly
proficient in the use of weapons used.
Very creditable work was done on the
horizontal bar by a mixed -class of
eight men from the different clubs.
What was considered by many spec
tators the star event of the evening
was the heavy-weight wrestling match
between G. Hild-brand of the Ban
Francisco Turn Vereiii, amateur cham
pion of the Pacific Coast, and J. Will
of the Oakland Turn Verein, Turner
champion of the same territory. A
very exciting bout, catch-as-natch-can,
lasting seventeen minutes, was won by
Hildebrand, with an arm-and-^r.nch
hold. This was followed by a middle
weight bout by H. Haustein ami Wil
liam Oescble of the Eintracht Turners,
which was won by the former in two
minutes.
Vaulting on the horse, by a mixed
class of eight men, showed some very
pretty work at lightning speed.
The running high jump, by another
mixed class of eight, excited great en
thusiasm among the onlookers, and
drew forth many a cheer for the agile

sounded from every engine house in

immediately following the ringing of

ley, who will push a button in the
White House which will start the fair.
When this announcement by the fire
bells and fire whistles is made it is
expected that every whistle and bell
in San Francisco will sound the news
that the first Mining Exposition ever
held in the State of California has been
opened.
A parade will immediately precede
the opening exercises. This will start
from a point in the neighborhood of
the Mechanics' Pavilion, and will pro
ceed through the principal streets of
the city, not lower than Sixth street.
There will be the addresses of wel

All in all, it was a great night for the
Turners, and in this event they fully
sustained their enviable reputation in
matters of this kind.
BRIGHT WITH BLOSSOMS.
The Floral Festival in Union
Square a Scene of Rare
Loveliness.
T'nion square presented a g&la scene
yesterday and last night. The occa
sion was the opening of the floral mar
ket, and It may be said that this event
of the Jubilee programme was attended
with the most gratifying success. The
ladies of the State Floral Society and
the members of the California Club
have a right to feel satisfied with the
result of their efforts, for they have
contributed their just proportion to the
success of the Jubilee.
Union square in its transformed
state presented a scene of rare loveli
ness. From the tall flag pole in the
enter to the corner of the square
drooped a long line of waving flags,
while in smaller lines were suspended
loop* of beautiful Japanese lanterns,
and these were lighted at night by in
candescent bulbs. The effect of the
variegated lights produced an exquisite
harmony of colors. The large tent, in
which the market was held, represented
the acme of floral decoration. Miss
Mary Bates, to whom had heen intrust

ANOTHER GOOD
SYMPHONY CONCERT
No Novelty to Speak Of, but
Familiar Modern Works
Well Played.
James Hamilton Howe's Annotated
Programme Causes Considera
ble Confusion.
The programme of yesterday's sym
phony concert at the Ttvoli was made
up of familiar modern works, the one
novelty and exception being "A He
brew Melody' arranged as an orches
tral piece by Robert Franz. It Is a
strong but rather mournful tune, and
the'only attempt at relieving a mo
notony that is even emphasized by the
denseness of the score is the introduc
tion of jingling bells In the repetitions;
this, no doubt, is Intended as a bit of
local descriptionâ the text of the orig
inal song, I believe, deals with "the
terlnr beneath a wealth of redwood
boughs, ferns and palms, producing a
novel arboreal design.
The f xhiblts upon the interior of the
tent, from an artistic point of view, pre
sented a rare and entrancing sight. The
exhibitors were: Samuel C. Hammond,
exhibit of various cacti; Frank Peli-
OUM & Co., cut flowers, gorgeous Amer
ican Beauties in a natural vase of flow
effl a>.Â«l iwi' irnm-nso Kmi:i:i B-'Unore

primroses and palms; Charles Ab a
ham, exhibit of house palms and a
huge Platycenum Granda fern; John
Pouyal, palms and flowering shrubs;
Cypress Lawn Cemetery Association,
beautiful exhibit of cinerarias; Wo
man's Exchange, forest wild flowers,
and the McLellan Company, flowers in
blossom and shrubbery. There was
â iSO an exhibit from the park, while
beautiful cut (lowers had been contri
buted by General Shatter, Mrs. Alvlnza
Hayward, Ross Valley. Haywanls and
San Quentin. Mrs. Alpheus Bull also
sent from San Mateo a lot of bamboo
cuttings.
When the doors <-f the tent were
opened at 1 o'clock there was a great
rush of visitors to see the exhibit. The
crush at flm was awful, and not a few
of the plants were Injured. Later in
the evening and at night society, en
masse, came to see an.i comment, and
there was nothing but praise for the
Exhibition. The event was still fur
ther enlivened by the Calaveras County
Band of Miners, who kept the excite
ment keyed up and the pulses quick
ened by the lively ami martial strains
that they rendered. Borne of the vis
itors gathered around upon the trrÂ«---ti
sward and chatted merriiy, while oth
ers patronized the candy booth, the
tamale tent, the trained birds and the
Punch and Judy show.
The market will continue to-day and
to-night and all of to-morrow and to
morrow night. The Native Sons" Band,
under the leadership of Director Bar
ton, Colonel Sullivan's Band, and the
band of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum
will play to-day and to-morrow. The
Calaveras County Band will also play
again during the continuation of the
market.
bewailing of the mourners in the streets
of Babel." and the tempo suggests a
slow procession â but it seems to me to
be a flippant and trivial device, as un
convincing as any of the hardware ef
fects employed by Salvation Army
band-nasters.
The others of the smaller pieces were
Goldmark's overture, "In Springtime,"
and a portion of Delibes' ballet. "Cop
pelia"; the symphony was Dvorak's
"From the New World," which we have
heard twice before, once from Mr.
Scheel and once from Mr. Hinrichs.
Bar the absence of that secure pian
issimo, which mure than anything else
is lacking in Mr. Scheel's band, every
thing was played with fluency and Ju
dicious enthusiasm. 1 heard both of
the former performances of the Dvorak
symphony, and am willing to trust my
memory so far as to say that this one
was the best. For once the slow move
ment was just slow enough, the Eng
lish horn wns wonderfully in tune and
the tremendous finish was played with
unwavering power and the right chop
py emphasis.
As usual, the comic relief was fur
nished by James Hamilton Howe and
the audience. Copious annotations of
the overture and symphony were
printed in the programme (they have
been published several times In every
newspaper in the town), but there was
not the slightest clew to the history or
There will be four prizes awarded to
the different exhibitors in the respect
ive order of the excellence of their dis
play. It was the general, and indeed
the universal, opinion of those who vis
ited the floral snow yesterday that it
eclipsed anything of Its kind ever seen
in this city at this season of the year.
CUT OUT SOME FEATURES.
The Humane Society Curtailed
the Wilc^West Perform-
ance.
The Wild "West Show was a great at
traction to yesterday's Jubilee merry
makers. Central Park, where the per
formance took place, was crowded, but
the show was somewhat of a disap
pointment. It was announced that the
cowboys and vaqueros would show
their skill in roping and handling wild
steers and riding bucking broncos. The
performers were ready to carry out
their part of the show, but early in the
afternoon the officers of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
cautioned the managers of the per
formance that should the cowboys and
vaqueros use spurs on the horses they
rode or strike them except with the
open palm of their hands the show
would be stopped. On no consideration
would they allow the steers to be
roped and thrown. In vain the cow
boys protested that they would not hurt
the animals or cause them pain, but
th-- officers were obdurate, and the
main feature of the show had to be
removed from the programme. Later
in tho afternoon Mayor i'hÂ»lan made
an appeal to the officers of the Society
for the Prevention trf Cruelty to Ani
mals, and a permit was iriv-m to run
the programme of the show in its en
tirety. When it was given, however, it
v. as too late to include the features in
yesterday's performance. Th>? cowboys
say they will have half a dozen of the
wildest kind of steers at the park to-
day.
Then again the bucking broncos re
significance of the Hebrew tune, and
the various movements of every piece
on the programme were omitted.
So an audience, two-thirds of which â
to re-use an expression of my own â
does not know Schumann from Sousa
without a guide book, applauded Scheel
for. his very Rood playing of the "Fes
tival Dance and Waltz" of the ballet
suite, and. upon his repeating the
movement. promptly turned to a new
page in the programme and settled
down to deep appreciation of the sym
phony. Of course the symphony came
in time, but more than half the per
sons present were quite convinced that
the second movement of the ballet,
"the dance of the automatons," was
the ' first of the symphony. It is
humbly submitted, as Herr' Bosworth
would say, whether Mr. Howe would
better number his , programme and
have corresponding numbers exhibited
on the stage at proper intervals or
make a speech every time the band
comes to a full stop.

"Willis E. Bacheiler will giv* a song ro

steed that was to be harnessed and
driven to a breaking cart went to sleep
when the harness was being put on him
and he trotted around the grounds with
all the animation and spirit of a faith
ful and trusted street-car horse after
he was hitched up. The feats of lasso
ing by the vaqueros and the fancy rid
ing of the cowboys were particularly
good, and the performers won much
applause from the spectators. In these
feats, George Slankard, the head va
quero of Miller & Lux's ranges; Wil
liam Wilson, James Roach, William
Childs. Frank Rojaa and Frank Steves
showed exceptional skill.
The stage hold-up, the capture of one
of the bandits and his rescue by his
sweetheart, and the pony express were
exciting features of the show.

tration of an attack made by a battal
ion of infantry. Such a maneuver
should not be misconstrued and sup
posed to be a sham battle, since the
defense is merely imaginary and is
represented by a line of hurdles and
signal flags. Evolutions of such a na
ture usually take place on a piece of
ground 1500 yards in length, but sinca
the available space at the Presidio is
but 500 yards in length the movement
will be divided into three phases. At
the end of each phase the battalion
will march back to its starting point
and will begin the next phase as if the
movement had been continuous. Spec
tators must not be misled into believ
ing that this necessary marching back
of the battalion forms a part of tha
system of attack. The third and last
phase will conclude with a rapid fire
and a final charge, a rallying of the
troops after the assault, and the firing
of a volley on the imaginary enemy,
supposed to be in full retreat.
The third part of the exhibition will
ci insist if a drill of the light batteries
of the Third Artillery. The men will

different methods of firing while in ac
tion.
The final part will consist of a drill
by the four troops of cavalry, illustrat

The programme will last about two
hours. No admission fee will be charg
ed to the grounds.
