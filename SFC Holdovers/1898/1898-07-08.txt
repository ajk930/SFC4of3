EL POZO HILL, NEAR SANTIAGO, Wednesday,
July 6, by The Call-Herald Dispatch Boat Golden Rod to
Kingston, Jamaica, July 7- â Though General Linares has
said he will not consider the surrender of the city, it may
capitulate before the Americans try to take it by assault. In
any case a long siege is out of the question. The stench due
to the dead men and horses about our position is frightful.
It is thought to-day there will be no firing till to-morrow,
when the plan of joint attack decided upon by Admiral
Sampson and General Shafter is likely to be put in operation.
I have been unable to get a definite statement whether or not
the attack will be delayed on account of General Miles
coming.
GeneraJ Pando has not reached San
tiago. The Spaniards have only am
munition for throe days. All the
women and children who Intended to
leave Santiago before the bombard
ment have already left. It is estimated
that 3000 persons passed through our
lines yesterday.
Our ships are In great need of sur
geons, nurses and supplies. The sani
tary conditions are worse since the bat
tle on account of decomposing bodies.
Many bodies are floating near the
wrecks of Admiral Cervera's ships. The
cry of the Spanish naval prisoners Is:
"Let Cuba go and give us peace!"
The Venezuelan Consul says he has
positive information that General Li
nares and General Toral are at odds.
General Toral wants to surrender. In
this he has the support of the Arch
bishop of Santiago, who has lost some
of. his recent warlike spirit. General
Linares positively refuses.
A Spanish officer, speaking to one of
our men during an armistice, said Li
nares would not surrender without the
consent of Madrid, and hinted that the
Americans should demand the surren
der of Santiago from Sagasta instead of
Linares.
All the foreign attaches wonder how
our ships were so little damaged by the
ships of Admiral Cervera. Official re
ports of the killed and wounded in Fri
day's fight are not yet In, but estimates
In hospital here place the number at
1800. Continual exposure to rain and
heat is toiling on the men. Nine hun
dred and forty-six wounded have been
handled in the general hospital.
Liutenant Colonel Roosevelt has been
recommended for a medal for bravery
under fire. Captain O'Neill was simi
larly recommended, but was afterward
killed.

SAX JUAN DE CUBA, Wednesday,
July 0, by The Call-Herald dispatch
boat Golden Rod to Kingston, Jamaica,
Thursday, July 7.â The armistice which
wafl to have ended to-day at noon has
been continued in order to allow the
Spaniards to bury their dead and con
vey their wounded at El Caney into
Santiago. Our men are very eager to
continue tho firing on the trenches be
fore the < ity, and in the opinion of
many it was the greatest error to per
mit an extension of the armistice on
any pretext. The enemy's forces are
working busily on their rifle pits and
A
are making new trenches within 200
yards of ours. Our own men, however
have not been Idle. They now have the
range of almost every rifle pit and
siege gun of the enemy. The attention
of foreign military attaches has been
called to the fact that the Spaniards
placed two 6-inch guns In embrasures
100 yards in ad%-ance of the building
covered with Red Cross flags. They
will make representations accordingly
to their governments.

In the aspect of affairs here. The
Spaniards are strongly pos t e d about
the outskirts of the .town and also
ainng the whole length of the conduit
of the water works, eight miles inland,
it is believed the Spaniards only hold
the water works on suffrance, because
the insurgent pickets hold sway every
where and could easily raid and wreck
the conduit. But the insurgents are
extremely anxious to conciliate the
neutrals and therefore refrain from
causing horrible privation.
The insurgents have never employed
cannon before Manila, but they are now
bringing up sixty guns, with the inten
tion of making a^ simultaneous rush
upon the Spanish intrenchments at
Santa Mesa, Santa Ana and Malete
thus rendering the other positions of
the Spaniards untenable, and by a sin
gle coup drive the Spaniards inside the
citadel, with a minimum of destruction
to non-combatants and property. It is
expected that it will take a week to
bring th* guns along, as they have to
make a detour through a difficult part
of the country and it is not desirable to
hurry.
The American troops are expected
here momentarily, and then probably
there will be 4 quick finish of the war.
A river sttafcier from Rulacan to-day
ran the blockade, bringing 200 refugees,
women and children.
The Spaniards are employing gangs
of natives, attned with axes and ma
chetes, to destroy the woods in the out
skirts of Mani'ifi, under Spanish over
seers with horetwhips.

GEN. SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS BEFORE SAN
TIAGO, Wednesday, July 6, by
The Call-Herald dispatch-boat
Golden Rod to Port Antonio, Ja
maica, Thursday, July 7. â I saw-
Mr. Hobson in the evening after
he had made his report to Ad
miral Sampson, and he consented
to give The Call and the Herald
a full interview about his experi
ence. Being very modest he does
not fully realize the great sensa
tion his exploit caused, but he
spoke in glowing terms of the
courage and bravery of his crew.
"We have been thirty-three
days in a Spanish prison," said
Mr. Hobson, "and the more I
think of it the more marvelous
it seems that we are alive. It
was about 3 o'clock in the morn
ing when the Merrimac entered
the narrow channel and steamed
under the guns of Morro. The
stillness of death prevailed. It
was so dark we could scarcely see
the headland.
"We had planned to drop our
starboard anchor at a certain
point to the right of the channel,
reverse our engine and then
swing the Merrimac around,
sinking her directly across the
channel. This plan was adhered
to, but circumstances rendered
its execution impossible. When
the Merrimac poked her nose
into the channel our troubles
commenced. The deadly silence
was broken by the ' wash of a
small boat approaching us from
the shore. 1 made her out to be
a picket boat. She ran close up
under the stern of the Merrimac,
and fired several shots from what
seemed to be three-pounder
guns. The Merrimac's rudder
was carried away by this fire.
That is why the collier was not
sunk across the channel.
"We did not discover the loss
of the rudder until Murphy cast
the anchor. We then found that
the Merrimac would not answer
her helm, and were compelled
to make the best of the situation.
The run up the channel was very
exciting. The picket boat had
given the alarm, and in a mo

MANILA, June 30, via i.ongkong,
July 7. â General Monet's troops, num-
Bering some 800, have surrendered, giv
ing up their arms to the rebels. The
captives were taken to Cavite. General
Monet, as I cabled, escaped with Au
gusti's family, who had a passport from
General Aguinaldo. He was disguised
as a woman, leaving his troops starv
ing. An indignation meeting was held
by the Spaniards, who went to the
Governor General to obtain an expla
nation as to why General Monet came
here without his troops and demanding
that he should be sent back. Owing to
the fact that the Spaniards are excit
able Monet's position is dangerous. The
water supply of the city is nearly ex
hausted. The pumps have not been
working for three days.
AGUINALDO AND
HIS PROCLAMATION

NEW YORK, July 7.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long is confident that no trouble will
result from Aguinaldo's proclamation.
It is admitted, however, that it would
have been much better for all parties
had Aguinaldo not organized a repub
lic when he undoubtedly knows that
General Merritt, the official military
governor of the United States, is now
on his way to Manila.
The President and his Cabinet are
trying to devise means to prevent com
plications arising with the nat^s from
such action, but they are determined
to retain control of the Philippines, at
least until the end of the war. and
Aguinaldri's action will not be allowed
to affect this course.
Now that a detachment of 2500 Amer
icans are at hand it is expected that
Aguinaldo will be anxious to make
short wcrrk of the Spaniards, and will
attempt to force Rear Admiral Dewey's
hand. But that official will not act un

UNITED STATES TERRITORY
McKINLEY
SIGNS THE
RESOLUTION
Nothing Lacking but the
Formality of Hawaiian
Acquiescence.
Rear Admiral Miller Will Proceed
to Honolulu and Hoist the
Stars and Stripes.
WASHINGTON, July 7.â At 7 o'clock
to-nigbt President McKinley attached
his signature to the joint resolution an
nexing the Hawaiian Islands. Minister
Hatch, having been legislated out of of
fice, departed for San Francisco and
expects to sail on the Alameda on July
13. Ex-Queen Liliuokalani and her sec
retary and Colonel John Richardson
also hope to catch this vessel.
Admiral Miller, commanding the Pa- j
rifle Station, has been ordered to pro- j
ceed to Honolulu and raise the Ameri- J
can flag. This ceremony is expected to
complete the ceremony of annexation.
Ir is believed, however, that upon the
arrival of the Coptic, which left San |
Francisco to-day, the Stars and Stripes I
will be raised over the islands without
waiting for a warship.
President McKinley and Secretary
Day had a conference this morning.
Minister Hatch was present. Telegrams
were sent to Minister Willis, via San
Francisco and the Coptic, advising him
that the islands had been annexed and
that a warship would reach Honolulu
within ten days and Admiral Miller
would hoist the flag. Further instruc
tions will be sent to Minister Willis
and President Dole by the warship,
which is expected to sail in a few days
from Mare Island.
Attorney General Griggs is of the
opinion that President McKinley's sig
nature of the joint resolutions made
annexation complete, but at the same
time the raising of the American flag
will bo officially regarded as the final
step.

"Submarine mines and torpe

The mines did no damage, al
though we could hear the rum

"WE LOST ALL AND ARE
NECESSARILY DEPRESSED"
Admiral Cervera's Report to General Blanco
After His Disastrous Defeat Off
Santiago.
WASHINGTON, July 7.â The War Department has
received the report of Admiral Cervera to General Blanco
on the disastrous naval fight to the Spanish cause off Santi
ago. It is as follows:
"In compliance with your orders I went out yesterday
from Santiago de Cuba with all the squadron, and after an
unequaled combat against forces more than triple mine, had
all my squadron destroyed by fire, the Teresa, Oquendo
and Vizcaya being beached and the Colon fleeing. I accord
ingly informed the Americans and went ashore and gave
myself up. The torpedo chasers foundered. Ido not know
how many people were lost, but it will surely reach 600 dead
and many wounded. Although not in such great numbers,
the living are prisoners to the Americans.
"The conduct of the crews rose to a height that won the
most enthusiastic plaudits of the enemy. The commander of
the Vizcaya surrendered his vessel. His crew are very grate
ful for the noble generosity with which they are treated.
Among the d^ead is Villamil, and, I believe, Lazaga, and
among the wounded Concas and Eulate. We have lost all
and are necessarily depressed. CERVERA."
It is believed, too, that the Hawaiian
Legislature may deem it wise to pass
a resolution similar to that adopted by
Congress and signed by the President
to-day. This is not regarded as ab
solutely necessary, but is consfQered an
advisable formality.
Ex-Minister Thurston is of the opin
ion that this will be a superfluous pro
ceeding, as the Hawaiian Senate, in
ratifying the annexation treaty, made
a tender of the islands, which tender
has now been accepted.
President McKinley has not yet de
cided whom he will appoint as com
missioners to represent this country
and report on the form of government
for Hawaii. Under the provisions of
the annexation resolutions five com
missioners are to be appointed, three
to represent this country and two Ha
waii. There will be no haste about
making appointments and it may be
weeks before this is done. In the
meantime, after hearing from the peo
ple of Hawaii, the President will ap
point officers to conduct the affairs of
the islands. It is thought President
Dole will be made the first Governor.
California already has three candi
dates in the field for the Hawaiian
commission. They are: Ex-State Sen
ator Stratton, Judge Firebaugh and M.
M. Estee. Senators White and Per
kins were at the White House to-day.
Senator Perkins has recommended
Mr. Stratton to be one of the commis
sioners.
"At the same moment two tor
pedoes fired by the Reina Mer
cedes struck the Merrimac amid
ships. I cannot say whether our
explosives or the Spanish torpe
does did the work, but the Mer
rimac was lifted out of the water
and almost rent asunder.
"As she settled down we
scrambled overboard and cut
away the catamaran. A great
c: eer went up from the forts and
warships as the hull of the col
iier foundered, the Spaniards
thinking the Merrimac was an
American warship.
"We attempted to get out of
the harbor in the catamaran, but
a strong tide was running, and
dayUght found us still struggling
in the water. Then, for the fust
tin-e, the Spaniards saw us, ani
a boat from the Reina Mercedes
picked us up. It was then short
ly after 5 o'clock in the morning,

water more than an hour. We

were taken aboard the Rema
Mercedes and later were sent to
Morro Castle.
"In Morro we were confined
in cells in the inner side of the
fortress, and were there the first
day the fleet bombarded Morro.
I could only hear the whistling
of shells, and .the noise they
made when . they struck, but I
judged from the conversation of
the guards that the shells did
considerable damage.
"After this bombardment Mr.
Ramsden, the British Consul,
protested and we were removed
to the hospital. There I w^s
separated from the other men in
our crew, and could see them
only by special permission. Mon
tague and Kelly fell ill two weeks
ago, suffering from malaria, and
I was permitted to visit them
twice.
, "Mr. Ramsden was very kind
to us and demanded that Mon
tague and Kelly be removed to
better quarters in the hospital.
This was done. As for myself
there is little to say. The Span
iards were not disposed to do
much for the comfort of any of
the prisoners at first, but after
our army had taken some of their
men as prisoners the treatment

was better. Food was scarce in
the city, and I was told that we
fared better than the Spanish of
ficers."
I asked Mr. Hobson about the
confinement of himself and his
men in Morro, and inquired par
ticularly as to whether they were
alarmed during the bombard
ments of Santiago's defenses by
the American fleet.
"We were confined in Morro
Castle but four days," Mr. Hob
son replied. "During that time
we were not disturbed in any
way. In fact, at no time were
we in danger, because it hap
pened the fleet did all of its
heavy bombarding either before
we were taken to Morro or after
we had left there."
"You were imprisoned in the
city itself after the first four
days, then?"
"No; from Morro we were ta
ken on board the Reina Mer
cedes, which the Spaniards were
using as a hospital ship. During
the firing on Friday many win
dows of the ship were broken by
American bullets, but no one was
hurt."
"How about your hopes and
fears during imprisonment? Did
you expect to go aboard an
American vessel again?"
This question brought a smile
to Hobson's face. He allowed
his memory to drift back over the
SANTA FE TO
CONNECT WITH
BAKERSFIELD
LOS ANGELES, July 7.-A former attor
ney of the Santa Fe Railway Company, who
has just returned from the East, states that
a contract has been let by the company to
build a line connecting the Santa Fe herewith
Bakersfield. The route selected is not
known.
There seem to be but two passes
which can be used by the company to
cross the Sierra Madre, the Arroyo
Seco Canyon and Cajon Pass, near San
Bernardino, through which the over
land route to the East now passes. To
cross the mountains by the Arroyo Seco
route would necessitate an immense
amount of work, and some engineers
claim it cannot be done. After the
Sierra Madre have been crossed there
is still another range between the des
events of the preceding weeks.
He did not answer at once.
"I was greatly depressed at
times," he said, presently, "as
were the other men of the Mer
rimac's crew. I had a slight at
tack of fever, but it did not last
long. Yes, lam entirely well
now and hope to participate in
the war from now until the
close."
OFF JURAGUA, July 6, by the As
sociated Press dispatch boat Wanda to
Port Antonio. Jamaica, July 7, via
Kingston, Jamaica, July 7.â Assistant
Naval Constructor Richmond P. Hob
son of the flagship New York and the
seven seamen who with him sailed the
collier Merrimac Into the channel of the
harbor of Santiago de Cuba on June 3
last and sunk her there was surren
dered by the Spanish military authori
ties in exchange for prisoners captured
by the American forces.
Hobson and his men were escorted
through the American lines by Captain
Chadwick of the New York, who was
waiting them. Every step of their jour
ney was marked by the wildest demon
strations on the part of the American
soldiers, who threw aside all semblance
of order, scrambled out of the rench
ments, knocked over tent guys and
other camp paraphernalia in their
eagerness to see the returning heroes,
and sent up cheer after cheer for the
men who had passed safely through the
jaws of death to serve their country.
The same scenes of enthusiasm were
repeated upon the arrival of the men at
the hospital station and our base at
Juragua. Hobson, who reached there
in advance of his companions, was
taken on board the New York immedi
ately. The flagship's deck was lined
with officers r.nd men, and as Hobson
clambered up her side and stepped on
board his vessel the harbor rang with
the shouts and cheers of his comrades,
which were re-echoed by the crews of
a dozen transports lying near by.
Hobson had little to say In regard to
his experiences except that he and his
companions had been well treated by
the Spaniards and that they were all
in excellent health.
The Spanish authorities consented
this morning to exchange Hobson and
his men and a truce was established for
the purpose. The place selected for the
exchange was under a tree between the
American and Spanish lines, two-thirds
of a mile beyond the intrenchments oc
cupied by Colonel Wood's Rough Riders
near General Wheeler's headquarters
and in the center of the American line.
The American prisoners left Reina
Mercedes Hospital on the outskirts
of the city, where they had been con
fined, at 2:45 this afternoon in charge
ert and the San Joaquln Valley, which
the Southern Pacific crosses by Te
hachapi Pass. To get through these
mountains Is not such a difficult prob
lem to solve, for at the west end of
Antelope Valley Tejon Pass offers a
most favorable route for a railroad, and
It Is said to be the one selected by the
Santa Fe Company.
At Bakersfield, It Is possible, the
Santa Fe will join the Valley Road,
making a through line from Los An
geles to Stockton.
of M%Jor Irles, a Spanish staff officer,
who speaks English perfectly. The
prisoners were conducted to the meet
ing place on foot, but were not blind
folded. Colonel John Jacob Astor and
Lieutenant Milloy, accompanied by In
terpreter Maestro, were in charge of
the Spanish prisoners. These consisted
of Lieutenants Amelio-Volez and Au
relius, the latter a German, and both
belonging to the Twenty-ninth Regu
lar Infantry, who were captured at El
Caney on Friday last, and Lieutenant
Adolph Aries of the First Provisional
Regiment of Barcelona, one of the
most aristocratic military organiza-
tions of the Spanish army; also four
non-commissioned officers and a pri
vate. Lieutenant Aries and a number
of men were wounded in the fight at
El Caney. The Spanish prisoners were
taken through the \American 'ines
mounted and blindfolded.
The meeting between Colonel Aster
and Major Irles was extremely cour
teous, but very formal, and no at
tempt was made by either of them to
discuss anything but the matter in
hand.
Major Irles was given his choice of
three lieutenants in exchange for Hob
son, and was also informed that he
could have all of the fourteen men in
exchange for the American sailors. The
Spanish officer selected Lieutonaot
Aries, and the two other Spanish of
ficers were conducted back to Jura
gua.
It was then not later than 1 o'clock,
and just as everything was finished
and the two parties were separating
Irles turned and said sourteously
enough, but in a tone which indicared
considerable defiance and rr ive his
hearers the impression that he desired
hostilities to be renewed at ones: "Our
understanding is, gentlemen, that this
truce comes to an end at 5 o'clock."
Colonel Astor looked at his wit?h,
bowed to the Spanish officer without
making a reply, and then starred back
slowly to the American lines with Hob
son and his companions.
The meeting of the two parties and
tha exchange of prisoners had taken
place- in full view of both the Ameri
can and Spanish soldiers, who were in
trenched near the meeting pl-ie-a, and
the keenest interest was taken in the
episode.
The reception to Hobson and his lit
tle command when they arrived at the
first line of American entrenchments
was simply overwhelming. The cheer
ing soldiers literally fell upon Hobson
and his comrades.
If the young officer, whose home Is in
Alabama, has any race prejudice, he
certainly forgot all about it as he
passed through the lines of soldiers on
his way to General Wheeler's head
quarters. He grasped the hands of the
ebony-hued troopers of the Ninth and
Tenth Cavalry and expressed his thanks
for the patriotic welcome with as much
heartiness as he displayed toward men
of his own race. He and all his men
were completely overcome by the re
ception accorded them, and tears rolled
down their cheeks as the soldiers crowd
ed around them.

HONOLULU, June 29.â The second
army of transitory occupation of Ha
waiian soil has passed onward, leaving
only happy reminiscences behind It of
exceedingly well behaved troops and
many object lessons of benefit to Ha
waiians and invaders alike.
The first army was received with curi
osity and coldness by the native Ha
waiians of Honolulu, who regarded the
invasion with doubt and suspicion, but
the second had no grounds of complaint
on this score for little by little the chil
dren, the women and the men fraternized
and so, with the exception of a large
number who kept aloof for conscience's
sake, the welcome became more univer
sal and more thoroughly cosmopolitan.
The chief credit of this is mainly due to

far, reflected nothing but honor upon
their country's flag, although they have

Another point, rather a selfish one per
chance, may be mentioned. : The troops

i they approached the landiner Dlace.
Friday, the 24th, was another very busy
and yet delightful day. The Senator and
Colon exchanged berths with the China
about daylight and then the work began.
I The general programme for the- morning
I hours was "a go as you please one" for
; purchasing supplies, seeing the town,
: bathing, wandering around and excbang
; ing views. The men were kept to a great
extent in company or squad organiza
tions.
During the afternoon the turret monitor
Monterey arrived ahead of her consort
collier, the Brutus. They also were
warmly received. Captain Leutze report
ed that the monitor behaved splendidly
after leaving San Diego, but encountered
rough weather and the tow line broke so
that she had to go slow. Her engineers
claim that with coal she can outrun the
Brutus.
On Saturday the second expedition
sailed away about 1:30 in the afternoon to
the tune of "Dixie" played by the Ha
waiian Band as supplementary to tho
"Star Spangled Banner" and "Auld Lang
Syne."
Owing to a misunderstanding as to the
hour or sailing, a number of officers and
men were very late on board and a
few were left behind through no fault of
their own. There was not a single case
reported of intentional desertion.
There were three deaths amonsr the
men on the transports. The first to go
was Sergeant George Geddes of Company
C of the Nebraska contingent. He died
on Tuesday, June, 21st, of brain trouble,
1300 miles out from San Francisco on
board the Senator. The funeral services,
in which the Zealandia and Colon joined,
were most impressive and touching. The
regiment's quartet supplied the beauti
ful choral service.
The next to leave the ranks was H. C.
Fisk of the Lincoln company of the sama
regiment. He was sick of typhoid fever
throughout the voyage, and was taken
ashore unconscious and died on the 26th
inst.
The third death was that of Chas. H
Robinson, second cook of the Colon, who
died suddenly of dropsy of the heart while
on duty on Saturday morning, the 25th.
fÂ« 8 remains were taken charge of by the
I. O. O. F. and buried In their lot in

FOUGHT WITH
A GUNBOAT
Exciting Voyage of the
Shenandoah.
SURPRISE FOR SPANIARDS
THEIR FIRE RETURNED BY THE
MERCHANTMAN.
Captain Murphy Makes Use of Can
non to Prevent Capture by a
Warship of the
Enemy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
P.ALTIMORE. July 7.â After an en
counter with a Spanish gunboat on her
way from Liverpool, the Shenandoah ar
rived at Baltimore to-day, and will take
, on a cargo of coal for Sun Francisro.
* whirh may be sent on to Manila. She
is the largest American vessel afloat, and
will take about 4800 tons fuel from this
It is btlieved that her cargo will
be loaded on colliers bound for Manila
from San Francisco.
The Shr-r.andoah has had more expe
rience with Spaniards than has fallen to
the lot of most American merchantmen.
"While in Liverpool, Captain Murphy was
cabled by Arthur Sewell & Co. of Bath,
Me., owners of the Shenandoah, to Insure
the vessel heavily before sailing. The
captain of the ship, however, placed more
reliance in cannon than in Insurance. He
pun based in Liverpool two four-inch
rifled cannon and had them placed aboard
ship. He then cabled to Bath what he
had done.
While the Shenandoah was rounding the !
southwest coast of Ireland, on June 7. j
five days out from Liverpool, a Spanish
gunboat made directly for her at the rate
of about IS knots an hour. Two shots
were fired at the Shenandoah, one of
which fell within 100 feet of her. Captain
Murphy had his cannon loaded, and pro
mmediately to return the flre.
The gunboat evidently was surprised
when she heard the report of the rifles,
and as the wind was favorable to the sail
ing vessel, the pursuit was soon given
up.

Rank and Pay Unanimously
Passed.
WASHINGTON, July ".-During the
greater part of the session to-day the
Senate considered unobjeeted bills? on the
general calendar, passing a large number
of them.
The bill permitting the Secretary of
War in his discretion to have erected on
West Point reservation an edifice for re
ligious worship was passed without
amendment. Its primary purpose is to
enable the erection of a Roman Catholic
church.
A bill to -increase the number of post
quartermaster sergeants of the United
States army was passed.
Another measure reported from the
military committee to reimburse the Gov
ernors of States and Territories for ex

tion of Morgan, he thought, was prema
ture, as the report of the Canal Com
mission had not been filed.

RICH STRIKE
OF QUARTZ
New El Dorado of the
North.
MINERS ARE RUSHING IN
THOUSAND CLAIMS ALREADY
LOCATED.
Free Milling Flake Gold Found
in the Sand Along the
Banks of Nine Mile
Creek.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, July 4 (by steam
ship Al-Ki to Seattle, July 7).â The
latest strike on the other side of the
divide is one of quartz. One thousand
men at least have made locations on
the rack of Nine-mile Creek, which
pours its waters, speckled with gold,
into the lake with the prosaic name of
Mud, which is a few miles this side of
White Horse Rapids. It is a quartz of
free-milling gold, easy to work. No ex
citement at or around Dawson has ever
exceeded that occasioned by this dis
covery.
This is how the discovery was made:
A goldseeker, in dipping his felt hat
into the stream to catch water to drink,
picked up a quart of sand, which he,
after slaking his thirst, panned out,
with the result that a number of Hakes
nt gold as large as, but thinner than,
flake gold, remained in the dip of the
hat.
The gravel bed was small, and a hunt
was at c-nce begun for the origin of the
gold, which was located in the quartz
on the sides of the creek. Every man
now going into Dawson drives stakes
nn Nine-mile Creek on any kind of
rock. Not less than 100 men, whu
have been lucky in making the best lo
cations, will remain on Nine-mile Creek
and not proceed to Dawson.
Some of the quartz, pounded up in a
mortar, shows a quantity of gold that
indicates that it will run $9uu to the
ton. The whole top of the earth ia
mountains and rock, and if the ledge
holds out fabulous wealth Is yet to be
ground c-ut on Mud Lake.
Steamboats now carry gold seekers
from Lake Bennett to Dawson in three
days, returning on the up-current trip
in ten days, fare down $100; from Daw
son to Bennett $250. There are now
four steamers on the Lewis-Yukon run
from Lake Bennett. One small craft,
the Irwin, which plies between Ben
nett and White Horse Rapids, is re
ported to have cleared $20,000 since the
opening of navigation in May. The
shores of both lakes are ship yards
which are yet far from deserted. By
these steamers by way of Dyea, Daw
son is only four days from Juneau and
eight days from Puget Sound.
Gold hunters are leaving Wrangel
and the Stickten like rats deserting a
sinking ship. Every steamer which
comes north carries many men and
outfits from Wrangel.
Patriotism in this time of war runs
high in Alaska. Tons of red fire is be
ing burned to-night in Juneau, Doug
las, Sitka and Wrangel. Governor
Brady, who has just returned from
Washington, D. C, has reported that
President McKinley does not expect
any volunteers from Alaska, but he ex
pressed a wish that a national guard
should be formed here.
At once the Takon Braves, a local
social organization, took up the work
and a braver or better looking lot of
young men would be hard to find.
Charles S. Rosener of California is the
organizer and Tom Smith, formerly an
employe of the Risdon Iron Works, is
Chief Tyee. This company will to-day
apply to Secretary Alger for uniforms
and arms. LaL HOFFMAN.

BARRON WILL
CASE SETTLED
Special Dlcpatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 7.â The famous Barron
will contest was dismissed to-day by
Judge Hyland, and the litigation for pos
session of the late millionaire Edward
Barron's estate came abruptly to an end.
A compromise has been effected between
Eva Rose Barron, the widow, and George
E. Barron, the contestant. The motion
of dismissal was made by Attorney S. P.
Leib on behalf of the contestant. The
case has been In court about four years,
and was bitterly fought by both sides.

'* '/&rl I>l3 ' 15 KE ARNY ST.
Edward Barren died four years ago,
leaving an estate worth $1,000,000. The
bulk of the property was left to Eva Rose
Barron, his young widow. For George j
Barren, a son, a $100,000 trust fund was j
created, he to have the income. George i
objected to this, and began a contest of
his father's will. After a long and stub
born trial the will was set aside on the
grounds of unsoundness of mind of the
testator and undue influence. A new trial
was granted to the executrix, Eva Rose
B;irron. Steps then taken to compromise
resulted In the dismissal of the contest
to-day.
By the terms of the compromise George
E. Barron is given half of the trust fundâ

HARBOR OF LAS PALMAS, the Capital of the Grand Canary, Which Is Likely to Be Soon Visited by Commodore
Watson's Fleet.
WILL SUE
FOR PEACE
THIS WEEK
NEW YORK, July 7.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
grraphs:
Will peace come with the fall of San
tiago? The administration officials are
hopeful and some of them are confident
that it will. This hope Is based on one
important bit of information which
came to Washington to-day in the fol
lowing official dispatch to the Secretary
of the Navy from Lieutenant Colonel
Wells, United States naval attache at
London:
"Have reliable information Spain will
enter into peace negotiations this week.
Campos probably Prime Minister."
Lieutenant Colonel Wells' sources of
information as to what is going
on in Spain have hitherto been so re
liable that officials of the administra
tion are hopeful that his dispatch will
be borne out by events. It is believed
that the sending of Commodore Wat
son's squadron to Spain and to pursue
Admiral Camara will be one of the most
effective agencies in bringing about
peace.
No third nation â will be consulted as
to the terms of peace. I can say on
the highest authority that the admin
istration is determined on this point
and will not say that any third nation
sha.. have a word to say as to the terms
on which peace is to be declared. The
treaty will be negotiated between the
United States and Spain and between
them alone, and the wishes of any other
nation as to what shall be done with
regard to Porto Rico or the Philip
pines or any other territory the United
States may take from Spain before the
treaty is negotiated -will not be con
sulted.
It is feared some effort might be'
made to Interfere in the Philippines. I
can say that it is the determination of
the administration not to permit any
such interference and to resist it to the
furthest extent.
MADRID, July 7.â A Spanish Cabi
net Minister is quoted in an interview
as saying that the present Government
of Spain will devote itself solely to the
defense of the Spanish coasts, and ti.at,
if negotiations for peace must be
opened, they will have to be conducted
by another Government.
The Government has received a tele
gram from Admiral Cervera, announc
ing the death of Admiral Villamel. who
â¢was in command of the Spanish tor
pedo-boat squadron at Santiago, and
the suicide of Captain Lazaga, com
mander of the Infanta Maria Teresa.
A Minister, after the Cabinet meet
ing to-day, declared that if Admiral
Cervera had succeeded in escaping the
Spaniards would have sued for peace.
But, he added, In view of the destruc
tion of the Spanish fleet, the war must
be continued, lest Spain be accused of
cowardice or fear.
Dispatches received here from official
sources at Havana announce that the
people are enthusiastic there to con
tinue the war.
LONDON, July 7.â The newspapers
throughout Europe are urging Spain
to sue for peace. It is generally re
cognized that Senor Sagasta's Cabinet
will shortly be superseded. The dif
ficulty in the way of peace is the army,
which is anxious to retrieve the failure
of the navy.
LIEUTENANT ORD'S
MOST TRAGIC DEATH
Killed by a Treacherous Spaniard
After Leading a Most Gallant
Charge.
OFF JUARAGUA. July 5 (via Kingston,
Jamaica, July 6.â The incidents attending
the death of Lieutenant Ord, son of the
late General E. O. C. Ord. were dramatic.
He was an aid on the staff of General
Hawkins, and throughout the day of the
battle was active and energetic in getting
the troops up the line. He was right in
the front rank when the Sixth, Thir
teenth, Twenty-fourth and Sixteenth
regiments made their desperate charge on
San Juan hill, and was one of the first
officers to reach the summit.
Just as he was passing the brow of the
hill he saw a Spaniard lying on tne
ground, and, pointing to him, he said
"Take care of that man."
The Spaniard caw the motion, and, evl
dently thinking Lieutenant Ord was or
dering him killed, he raised his riile and
shot the lieutenant dead.
The soldiers of the Sixth Infantry, as
Lieutenant Ord was an officer of that
regiment and very popular with the men,
were wild with rago and lite rally tore the
body of the Spaniard to pieces with bul
lets. Then they kicked it into a trench.
FULL RANK OF A

Corbln's Rapid Promotion Causes a

WASHINGTON', July 7,-T.ate this
afternoon a bill conferring Â«pon Adju

was asked by Sewell (R.) of New Jersey,
for consideration of the bill, Pettus (D.)
of Alabama objected. However, the Sen

Pettus sharply criticized the measure,
and charged that General Corbin had
been rapidly promoted by reason of po
litical favoritism. This charge brought
several Senators to their feet, among
whom were Bate, Pasco and Bacon

WATSON'S
SQUADRON
DETACHED
WASHINGTON, July 7.â The Presi
dent called a council of war to-day at
the White House, the purpose being to
review the situation and learn exactly
what the present conditions are and
what changes, if any, should be made
in the plans for the future conduct of
the war. According to one of the mem
bers present it was decided to abide
by the plans already laid, at least as
to the general conduct of the campaign.
Confirmation seemed to have been
given to the statement later in the day,
when, after a conference with the mem
bers of the War Board, Secretary Long
announced that he had ordered Ad
miral Sampson to detach from his own
command immediately the vessels to be
embraced in Commodore Watson's
eastern squadron and to direct the
commodore to proceed on his mission.
The vessels of the squadron will not
be the same as those originally selected,
for the reason probably that the recent
engagement with Cervera's squadron
necessitated some changes. The new
eastern squadron will consist of the
battle-ships lowa and Oregon, the pro
tected cruiser Newark and the auxil
iary cruisers (carrying side armor)
Dixie, Yankee and Yosemite, the col
liers Averenda, Cassius, Caesar, Leoni
das and Justin and the supply-boat
Delmonico. The lowa, Oregon and New
ark are all in the south with Sampson.
The Dixie is at Newport and the Yan
kee at Tompkinsville. The colliers are
at Hamptcrn Koads with the Delmonico.
The ships are to set sail as soon as they
can coal and supply. It will not be re
quired, in the case of the southern ves
sels, to come north, which would mean
the loss of several days, but they will
start directly from the points where
they are now located. The order pro
vides that each ship shall make her
way across the Atlantic to a marine
rendezvous, which will be designated in
sealed orders to prevent its exposure to
the slightest possible danger from the
enemy, and the most that is known is
that it will be at some point off the
Spanish coast.
It probably will not be long after that
before the American squadron will be
in full pursuit of Camara, with his
remnant of the Spanish navy. Mean
while, the gathering of the American
fleet off the Spanish ports is expected
to have a sobering effect upon the in
flamed people. The number of colliers
accompanying the expedition is evi
dence that a long cruise lies ahead and
that our naval authorities propose to
be caught in no such position as was
Camara at Port Said â obliged to sub
mit to a refusal of coaling privileges.
A telegram received at the State De
partment this afternoon announced
that Camara was still lying with his
squadron at Suez, the southern and
eastern entrance to the canal. The
torpedo-boats Osada, Proservino and
Audaz, which were yesterday reported
at Pharo, Portugal, arrived to-day at
Cadiz, their home port. Admiral Dewey
has been notitied of all these move
ments.
The very first care of the officials
will be for the wounded men, who are
to be brought north as rapidly as their
condition will permit.
Meanwhile, all is being done In the
neighborhood of Santiago to alleviate
the suffering. This afternoon came
a telegram from General Shafter to
the War Department as follows: "In
the name of the sick and wounded offi
cers and men under my command, I
thank Mr. J. W. Mackay for the ice
sent us."
Major General Miles, accompanied by
the entire staff of army headquarters,
left to-night for Charleston, S. C,
where the party will embark for San
tiago. The party consists of General
Miles, General J. C. Gilmore, adjutant
general of staff; General Roy Stone,
Colonel C. R. Greenleaf, surgeon; Lieu
tenant Colonels J. W. Clous, M. C.
Maus and A. S. Rowan; Major John
D. Black and Captain H. H. Whitney.
At the same time Lieutenant Colonel
Michler and a large staff of headquar
ters clerks, who have been in Tampa,
will come north to Charleston and
join the party. The start will be made
from Charleston on either the Yale or
Columbia, which are taking on troops
there. It is expected that the party
will be at Santiago the early part of
next week.
On the eve of his departure General
Miles expressed satisfaction on starting
to join the troops. He spoke of the
sacrifice and hardships they had passed
through recently and of those yet to
come. General Miles has no other pur
pose in going to Santiago than to look
over the military situation and to
strengthen the hand of Shafter. There
is no intention on his part to take in
any manner from the glory that Shaf
ter has won or may win in this cam
paign. He will not relieve General
Shafter of his command unless the lat
ter's physical condition is such as to
demand some such action.
With a view to giving General Shaf
ter the benefit of more heavy artillery
orders were issued to-day for the im
mediate departure of four more heavy
batteries for Tampa for transportation
to Santiago at once. These batteries
are X of the Seventh Artillery, now at
HEARST'S WEIRD
TALE OF MURDER
PROVED A FAKE
Shjafter Vigorously Denounces tf)e
Report Tfyat Prisoners Are
Put to Death.
NEW YORK, July 7.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald sends the following: Major General Shafter, commanding the Am
erican army operating against Santiago, has branded as an absolute
falsehood Mr. Hearst's charge that the Cubans had murdered Spanish
prisoners turned over to them by American troops.
Secretary Alger acted promptly in making an investigation of Mr.
Hearst's charge. When the Secretary called at the White House last
evening he brought Mr. Heart's charge to the attention of the President,
and then cabled to Major General Shafter directing him to report at
once if there was any foundation for it. This is General Shafter's re
ply, received at the War Department to-day:
"PLATA DEL ESTE, July 7.â To Secretary of War, Washington:
Dispatch as to killing of prisoners by Cubans absolutely false. No pris
oners have been turned over to them and they have shown no disposi
tion to treat badly any Spaniards who have fallen into their hands.
"SHAFTER, Major General Commanding."
Naturally General Shafter's reply will close the incident so far as
the department is concerned. Had his message indicated in any way
that there was any truth in the charge, an exhaustive investigation
would have been made, and the person or persons found responsible
would have suffered as they deserved.
The authorities are delighted to lÂ«arn from General Shafter that
the report is groundless, as they objected to the army appearing before
the civilized world as accessories to murder committed by our allies, the
Cubans. Should any further reports of this character be published
there is reason to believe the department will suggest to General Shaf
ter the advisability of removing the author or authors from his lines.
Such reports published in Cuba, Porto Bico and Spain will produce the
impression among Spaniards, the authorities fear, that they will be mur
dered if captured by, or if they surrender to, the Americans, and this
apprehension will probably cause them not only to fight to the death,
but to give no quarter to any Americans who may be taken prisoners.
The treatment of the Merrimac's crew by the Spaniards is pointed to by
the authorities as indicating that the Spaniards will treat the Ameri
cans chivalrously if not aroused by false reports, and it is, therefore,
to the interest of the Government and its war services to prevent such
reports being published when they are Absolutely without foundation.
Great indignation is expressed by Cubans here at Mr. Heart's ac-
tion in charging them with murdering Spanish prisoners. Those with
whom I talked to-day declare the insurgents have never been guilty of
such a crime before the war, and they are not likely to take such action
now when supported by American troops and fighting for a place
among the nations of the world. The fact that Mr. Hearst owns a paper
which has ostensibly been espousing their cause and publishes in that
journal a charge of the most infamous character is regarded as most
significant, as indicating his true position.
Willetts Point; D of the Fourth Artil
lery, at Fort McHenry, Md., and H and
X of the Second Artillery, at Fort
Adams and elsewhere in Rhode Island.
Advices received here this morning
from General Shafter announce that a
number of high Spanish officials are de
serting 1 across the lines at Santiago into
the American camp. This act is re
garded here as highly significant of an
early surrender.
The War Department admitted for
the first time to-day that two expedi
tions, one on the Florida and another
on the Fanita, had successfully pro
ceeded from Florida ports to points in
central and western Cuba, where large
quantities of arms and supplies were
landed for General Gomez' command.
This is the first time that arms have
got to Gomez and his men in the west
ern sections, as the first expedition
equipped Garcia and his men around
Santiago. The Florida and Fanita left
some time ago, but their movements
were guarded with the greatest care
in order that a premature publication
might not jeopardize the safety of those |
on board as well as the delivery of the
guns. The time of danger is now
passed, however, and the full stock of
guns, ammunition and supplies is in
the hands of General Gomez' troops.

SALT LAKE, July 7.â To-day's session
of the International Mining Congress was
consumed by a discussion of the report
of the committee on revision. of the Fed
eral mining laws. The report favors the
abolition of all laws of apex and extra
lateral rights; favors Federal surveys of
all locations before. surveys can be made
valid; urges an official record of locations
In the Surveyor-General's Office as well
a* In the County. Recorder's Office; en
larges locations to forty acres and gives
rights to all minerals within the boundary
lines extended vertically." .â ".
A minority report was presented by W.
B. Heyburn of Idaho, proxy for G. B.
Dennis of Washington, a member of the
revision committee., Mr, Heyburn favors
the retention of the present mining law,
amended to provide for Government sur
veys at Government expense of the first
location on any ledge; the survey to define
the course of the ledge and establish it by
monuments. All subsequent locations
Bhall conform In end lines to the course
of this survey line, the idea being
to obviate subsequent litigation as to the
apex and course of the vein.
Judge. Heyburn, speaking- in favor of
the minority report, said British Columbia
had adopted the square claim theory, but
it had worked such an injustice to the
poor prospector that the Government was
now seriously considering the question of
abolishing it. Professor W. S. 'Keyes of
California spoke for the majority report.
He said Judge Heyburn was the first per
son he ever met who was satisfied with
the present law. He said his object In
advocating the proposed changes in the
law was to prevent litigation and promote
Justice. Tom Smith of New Mexico made
a stirring speech against the majority re
port, declaring that if adopted It would
destroy the mining industry. H. D. Dun
can of California was the next speaker to
attack the majority report. The discus
sion then went over to to-morrow.

FIRE RAGES
IN CORNING
Business Part of the
Town Burned.
WAS WITHOUT PROTECTION
CONFLAGRATION CHARGED TO
INCENDIARISM.
Loss Placed at One Hundred and
Fifty Thousand Dolars, With
Comparatively Little
Insurance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CORNING, July 7.â The entire busi
ness portion of Corning was destroyed
by a conflagration that started at 2
o'clock this morning. Not a store, hotel
or other place of business, save a paint
shop, the office of the Maywood Colony
Association and the office of the Corn
ing Observer, remain. What was once
the prosperous business center for miles
of grain country is now but smoking
debris.
The fire Is believed to have started In
Aitken's barn, near the Liersch House.
It spread to the Liersch House and
Blatchley's drug store. William Schnit
zer, who was sleeping outside and near
the barn, was the first to see the flames
and gave the alarm. In a few minutes
the streets were filled with people, but
they were powerless, as the town has
no fire system, and the conflagration
already had gained too much headway
for them to be able' to save anything
from the burning buildings.
A strong wind was blowing. The fire
spread to the Liersch House and Beck
er's boot and shoe store and to the
Western Hotel, then across the street
north to Hart's livery stable and Mrs.
J. S. Aitken's confectionery store.
Again on the south side it caught Wil
liam Liersch's blacksmith shop and the
Corning cash store. After burning the
residence of Mrs. Aitken the flames took
a westerly course, burning Clement's
building, Kaufman Bros.' furniture
store, the postoffice, Donnovan's meat
market, Finck's barber shop and news
stand, Kaufman's general merchan
dise store and Cannon's blacksmith
shop. These buildings, together with
a dozen or more barns and outhouses,
constitute the burned structures. Most
of the buildings were of brick and were
completely ruined. The loss will total
$l"i 0,000. There is little insurance.
No one knows how the blaze origin
ated, but it is the general opinion that
it was incendiary. About a week ago
a little daughter of Mrs. Aitken went
into the barn and discovered a small
blaze, which she put out with a bucket
of water. No one of the family had
been near the barn previously.
Fire Probably of Incendiary Origin.
BAKERSFIEI/D. July 7.â The belief Is
now general that the Kern City fire was
of incendiary origin, and arrests are ex
pected. Durfng tho fire buildings to the
windward were ignited, though fences and
outbuildings intervening were not burned.
The charred remains of Joseph Gallaud
were found in the ashes of the Verdler
livery stable to-day. Gallaud worked for
Verdier. and slept in the barn. He evi
dently had awanened and left his bed,
but could not find his way out in the
smoke and heat.

NO HALF-HEATED SOLDIERS ARE
WANTED.
CALIFORNIA'S National Guardsmen have
made a record of which the State is proud.
When the first call came they enlisted without
hesitation or demur, enlisted gladly and eagerly, and
the oniy disappointment was that the Government
did not need the services of so many as offered them
selves. It is a pity, and to the culpable guardsman
will be a lasting reproach, that the splendid record has
been marred by the color of insubordination.
The Woodland company has been ordered home in
disgrace. It has only itself to blame. The Governor
had named the officers to command in the Eighth
Regiment. He had used his best judgment and had
found necessity for making but few changes of the
militia organizations. As captains he substituted
Lyon for Smith of the Redding company, and Bald
win for Ward of the Woodland company. In both
instances there was a protest, and in the case of
Woodland a threat that the men would have the dis
placed officers put back in the lead or would refuse
to take the oath of allegiance to the United States.
Such could not be the attitude of good soldiers. It
bespoke a mistaken zeal which was not love of coun
try, nor devotion to the flag. It stamped the men as
unfit to serve in an army where obedience is the first
law. If the company contained no better stuff than
the threat indicated.it is well that something happened
to show its true character before it had been sent to
the front. Far better that it should have been dis
banded.
The deposed captain urged the men to stand by
him. The citizens of Woodland took up his cause.
There was no compromise on the part of the Gov
ernor, and there should have been none. Far dif
ferent from the action of Ward was that of Smith,
who had been succeeded by Baldwin. He asked the
men to abide by the decision of their commander, to
be guided by the same patriotism which had led them
to enlist, and stated that he was willing to serve his
country in any capacity. The result was that the
Redding men were mustered in, and the Woodland
boys are to be soldiers neither of the country nor the
State. Their arms and accouterments will be taken
from them and their names expunged from the rolls
of the National Guard.
Happily there are other companies chafing because
there had been no demand for the services they are
ready to give the country. One of these can be
so quickly brought to the ground that in the forma
tion of the regiment there will be no appreciable
delay.
Woodland will have regrets, but too late. Its rep
resentatives chose to desert the standard. The con
sequences rest upon them.
THE PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S proclamation call
ing upon the people when they next assemble
at their places of worship to give thanks to God
for the marvelous success of our arms at sea will be
well received and cordially acted upon. While our
people are divided into a thousand different sects, on
minor matters of church government and ritual, there
are little or no differences among them on the essen
tial principle of a belief in God and his overruling
providence. The destruction of two great Spanish
ileets without the loss of a single ship on our side,
and with the sacrifice of but a single life in the accom
plishment of two victories, has inclined the devout
to gratitude to the Almighty who holdeth nations in
the hollow of his hand, and the proclamation &f the
President comes, therefore, more as a response to a
deep feeling among the people than as an appeal to
awaken such gratitude.
Our success as a nation, not only in this war, but at
all times, has been due to our obedience as a people
to those laws which underlie and overrule all human
events. We have not been cruel, nor tyrannous, nor
wasteful, nor false to the nobler instincts of humanity.
We have grown strong because in the main we have
lived in accordance with divine law. Our victories at
Manila and at Santiago have not bee^special provi
dences vouchsafed arbitrarily at the hour of battle,
but providences growing out of virtues practiced in
the past which have made us strong and brave and
united to face the dangers of war.
In a certain sense, therefore, the thanksgiving to
which the President has summoned the nation will be
a new dedication of the people to those principles of
virtue and liberty which have secured us in the past,
and which alone can^preserve us in the vicissitudes of
the struggles through which we shall have to make
our way in the fulfillment of the destiny that lies be
fore us. The occasion will be a solemn, patriotic ob
servance, and by the great mass of the people will be
kept in the spirit of the President's words: "Let us
pray with earnest fervor that He, dispenser of all
pood, may speedily remove from us the untold af
flictions of warandbrinpto our dear landthe blessings
of restored peace and to all the domain now ravaged
by cruel strife the priceless boon of security and tran
quillity."
HEARST fIS A TRAITOR,
THAT W. R. Hearst deserves to be placed in
irons and sent under armed escort to the nearest
prison is a plain matter of fact. Unless he can
establish the plea of insanity he merits the reward of
the traitor. If he is a lunatic, there are asylums.
General Shafter has reported the statement of Hearst
that the army was party to barbaric slaughter and
rapine wholly unfounded. The report was an official
formality. The flagrant lie told by Hearst carried its
own condemnation and branded the author as a trea
sonable exile from the country of his citizenship.
Ordinarily the Hearst lie is inspired by personal
malice or a wanton desire to create a sensation. It
is only since the man, losing faith in the inveracity
of his subordinates, has entered the field as a cor
respondent that his hideous and abnormal character
has been displayed in all its degradation. In his craze
for notoriety, his passion to be seen, he cares nothing
that his posture is indecent, his presence a blight, or
that his reputation assails the nostrils. Once he
merely sanctioned and encouraged lies; now he writes
them, shamelessly signing to them a name which has
become the synonym for all that is low and foul â his
own.
Disporting a bogus loyalty, he has proclaimed a
patriotism which never existed within him. Prating
of love of country, he has abused its leaders, misled
its military men by false information, and now he has
made a deliberate attempt to drag its name in the
dust, to place a stain upon its repute, to have it appear
to the world as accessory to assassination, to the
looting of the dead who fell in honorable battle. He
has exulted with the vultures, and spread before his
readers a feast of carrion. Official indignation has
been aroused. For this latest crime, the climax of a
series, he must answer. Charity suggests that the
creature is daft; justice that a madman be restrained,
or a traitor punished.
When Hearst wrote that a Cuban soldier, one
Lame, had inveigled forty Spanish troopers into sur
j render, that these had by the Americans been turned
I over to Lame and other insurgents and by them be
j headed, he wrote as silly a fiction as ever in the his
| tory of yellow journalism found its way to print. Yet
| he wrote it as a matter of fact, intended to be believed.
| He told how magnificent Lame was, how his hand
j some face "glowed with enthusiasm" as he related
! deeds of horror in which he had participated, treach
ery, murder and robbery of corpses on the field. If
. Hearst recognized this idle boasting as a stupid ut
terance of a lying braggart he had no business to send
| it. Accepting it as true, had he not been a pervert,
j he would have been stirred to his depths with an in
dignation which language even better than he com
mands could ill express. He would have exposed the
I diabolical acts as something to be swiftly and ter
ribly punished. But he gloried in them, lauded the
monstrous criminal who claimed to be guilty of them,
and with a spirit so flagrantly insulting that it could
only dwell within a mind beyond the thrill of noble
thought or patriotic impulse, ascribed a part of the
' nameless villainy to the army of the United States.
If our soldiers braving death on the torrid heights
about Santiago are to be thus held up to the scorn
and loathing of civilization, what may alien races,
some of them not inclined to be fair nor friendly, be
expected to think?
If there is no specific provision by which this form
of treason may be stifled, at least Correspondent
Hearst and his staff of malign liars can be driven
from the field of activity where they constitute a
menace to our arms. Our soldiers are not bent on
massacre. To say they are is a wicked slander. None
but a Hearst would have uttered it.
As to the bloody-handed hero at whose feet Hearst
bows in worship, he is a horse doctor, perhaps an
authority on spavin, possibly well versed in colics, but
not calculated to grace a pedestal in the midst of an
admiring throng. Happily the supply of Hearsts is too
small to make a throng.
For this crowning lie Hearst ought to be scourged
from the haunts of men, as he has been from the
State of his birth. He has been a nuisance, annoying
and noxious; he has become a peril. Already his
sway over the two papers which serve as mediums
for his venom or his nonsense has been weakened.
It is the duty of the powers now controlling them to
protect the public against the ravings of Hearst, as
they protect themselves against other forms of his
eccentricity.
In all the land there is not another so despised and
yet so potent for mischief. Until the day when
within a padded cell he shall scribble phantom mes
sages to the papers he once owned, he needs a lodge
in some vast wilderness remote from the telegraph.
There let him gibber to moon or speak words of
affection to his h6rse doctor, but the world craves
rest.
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC PLAN.
WHILE the Democrats of California are appar
ently indifferent to the future of the national
organization of their party, and are content to
trot along with the old Bryan banners of the cam
paign of 1896, their brothers in the East are earnestly
discussing ways and means and devising plans and
policies for the future. The plans proposed are al
most as numerous as the leaders of the party. Every
man who aspires to be a Moses for Democracy must
have a scheme for getting out of the wilderness, and
each one seems determined to have his own. Con
fused as they are, however, they are interesting, for
it is certain that out of some of them a good deal of
practical politics is going to come during the fall
elections.
We have recently directed attention to some of
these plans. We have quoted from the Richmond
Times a proposition that Democracy get rid of Bryan
ism by dropping free silver and setting up a platform
of anti-imperialism; from the Louisville Post that
Bryan be set aside with his Chicago platform
and the party declare for the annexation of all the
captured colonies of Spain; from the New York
World that the whole programme of 1896 be elim
inated from the future, and that this fall the elections
be contested on State issues alone.
These plans dealt only with questions of platform.
Now comes a suggestion from Georgia that proposes
for the party both a platform and a leader. The
author is Congressman Livingston, who wishes to
have something definite to say to his constituents
when he asks for re-election. The Georgian proposes
a campaign this fall against annexation, colonization
and all other forms of imperialism, and to make the
platform solid he urges that the State conventions in
dorse as their candidate for the Presidency in 1900 no
less a person than Grover Cleveland.
The New Orleans Picayune considers the Georgia
proposition with a longing mind, but a doubtful
heart. It declares Mr. Livingston is right in holding
that the coming contest between the parties will be
over the question of colonies, and that Mr. Cleveland
would be the ideal candidate for the anti-imperial
party, but has little hope that he will get the nomi
nation.
In a sentence that sounds like a sigh of longing and
a groan of hopelessness it says: "It would be a sort
of providential salvation to the republic if in the im
portant emergencies that are going to grow out of
the present war Grover Cleveland should become the
THE SAX FRASTCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 8, 1898.
next President, but nothing is more improbable un
der the conditions that are to be met."
Whether Mr. Livingston will be able to rouse the
drooping spirit of the Picayune sufficiently to induce
it to make a fight for his programme, which it so evi
dently approves, remains to be seen. At any rate
the new plan for escaping the wilderness has been put
forward. Mr. Cleveland once more has friends who
will nominate him if he will put himself in their
hands.
DIRECTOR BURNS' RETORT.
AT the meeting of the Board or Education on
Tuesday evening Director Burns made no re
sponse to the charge that he had expended
over $100,000 of the school fund without the sanction
of the board and without consulting his colleagues
of the building committee. Like a lamb in the hands
of the shearers, he was dumb. On Wednesday he
was a little more loquacious and made an explanation
not only of his dealings with the school money, but
of his silence at the board meeting.
His explanation was interesting. He is quoted as
having said: "This whole matter is of no particular
moment to me except that it is very disagreeable to
have your supposed friends fly in your face and try
and cover you with mud. It is only a piece of spite
work, and some day the inside of this business may
be made public. No, I will not say what the attack
is due to, and these gentlemen may go on and make
this statement or that, I don't care what."
There is no reason for doubting that Burns was
sincere in his statement that the matter is of no inter
est to him beyond the annoyance caused by an attack
coming from one whom he supposed was standing in
with him. He has witnessed many such storms as
this and he has seen them blow over. He has been
in many an explosion and he has not been hurt. It
is annoying to have one's manipulations of public
money exposed by a supposed friend, but otherwise
there is nothing in such an exposure to be of any par
ticular interest to the fellow exposed. That has been
the record of such exposures in San Francisco. They
have been so common and so futile that it is difficult
for anybody to be interested in them.
There is but one way to make this affair interesting
to Burns and to the people, and that is by indictment
I and prosecution. If the members of the board who
are now denouncing Burns stop at this point and take
no legal steps to bring him to justice and to punish
ment the public, while accepting as true the charges,
since they have been supported by evidence, will con
! elude that Burns is right in declaring them to be
merely spurts of mud-flinging â the emanation of
personal spite.
It is a sad commentary on the administration of our
municipal affairs and the enforcement of our law that
charges of offenses so serious as those Burns is ac
cused of committing should be dismissed by the ac
cused party as matters of no interest, assertions not
worth while to answer. Boss Tweed in the days of
the power of his corruption in New York dismissed
allegations of wrongdoing with the contemptuous
question, "What are you going to do about it?"
Burns is more contemptuous still. He does not
trouble himself to ask what we are going to do about'
it. He does not care what is done. He dismisses the
whole matter with indifference â "It Is of no interest
to me."
AGUINALDO'S ESTIMATE OF OGUI
NALDO.
THE $25,000 head of Insurgent Aguinaldo seems
to have been turned. He too freely projects
himself into the situation. He needs to be sub
dued and eliminated. The terms on which he proposes
to allow the destiny of the Philippines to be molded
have been made public. Some of these are good,
many of them bad, none of any consequence.
The future of the Philippines is still a problem. It
will be solved by the Government of the United
States. If Aguinaldo or any other insurgent who
has been alike a traitor to his country and his per
sonal 1 followers be permitted to have a voice in af
fairs there would be no solution, but the perpetuation
of turmoil, violence and bloodshed.
Aguinaldo's terms are set forth in fourteen articles.
Of these only a few are of interest, and they only be
cause they show the fatuous notion of the man that
he is to have the benefit secured by American, vic
tory. America has not been fighting for him. In
deed, America would read with equanimity that the
$25,000 head had exchanged ownership. America, to
be frank, does not care a rap about Aguinaldo, and
only asks that he attend to his business, which is not
ours.
The articles are defective in that they declare this
insurgent President, that they sanction "temporary
intervention of American and European Commis
sioners," that they propose an American protectorate
on the "conditions identical with those arranged for
Cuba," and intrust the administration of justice to a
European official. Herein has Aguinaldo writ his
farewell to matters of state. He will be ousted from
all authority. He has not caught the spirit of the
occasion. He cumbers the land.
General Merritt is on his way to Manila with an
idea that upon arrival he is to take charge of affairs
there. He will in all probability do so. The islands
are extensive, but they do not afford room for both
an American Governor and a native boss. Europe
has nothing to do save keep hands away from a sit
uation which concerns the United States, and every
detail of which will be adjudicated by the United
States without the advice of any monarchy and care
less of the sanction of King, Emperor or Czar.
Aguinaldo makes the mistake of thinking himself im
portant. He is becoming merely obnoxious.
The gentlemen who think they could run the war
better than it 19 being run are getting almost numer
ous enough to organize an army of their own, drive
out the incompetent regulars, the blundering volun
teers, the ignorant and inexperienced generals, and
then lick the Spanish in approved style. Also, they
are making people tired.
Only two Spanish war vessels have been sunk by
American ships since the destruction of Cervera's
fleet. This is" a little slow, but if the enemy will put
some more within range the men of the United States
navy will demonstrate that their intentions are good
and their aim accurate.
Now the Spanish are saying that if Cervera had es
caped they would have considered the proposition of
peace. As it is, pride prevents it. If they had more
brains and less pride they would make better insur
ance risks.
The destruction of Cervera's fleet is said to have
strengthened the determination of Spain to fight to
the bitter end. It has also brought the bitter end con
siderably nearer.
It is to be hoped that the society gentlemen being
appointed as army paymasters will grasp the notion
that soldiers earn their wages and deserve them
promptly.
The prejudice against French products is likely to
extend so as to embrace the style of ocean voyage
offered to the public by the French steamship.
SOLDIERS WHO CONQUER
THE SPANISH VERB.
"Forward! March!"
And away werrt fifty men of the lowa
Regiment up First Avenue, with the
Chaplain in the lead.
They were going to school. They
were going to the Richmond school
house to take their first lessons in
Spanish at the invitation of Miss Fran
ces Hodgkinson and Mr. and Mrs. How
ard.
Miss Hodgkinson is teacher of Latin
at the Lowell High School; Mrs. How
ard is teacher of French and Spanish
at several of the San Francisco schools;
Mr. Howard is oVie of the professors of
the Romance languages in that depart
ment of the University of California,
and these three patriotically disposed
and linguistically cultivated people took
it into their three wise heads that a
little Spanish would be an excellent
thing to add to the equipment of an
American soldier going to Manila,
The idea originated with Miss Hodg
kinson. She found one of the men of
the Colorado Camp patiently digging
Spanish definitions out of a little old
text-book which the years and the lan
guage had left far behind.
"I can lend you a better book than
this," said Miss Hodgkinson.
"Can you?"' said the soldier. "I'd
like it."
He got it the next day. Miss Hodg
kinson spoke to his sergeant about
him.
> "There's plenty more trying to learn
Spanish," said the sergeant, "and it
would be a good thing for them to know
a little of it. A roan might be helped
â¢ "QUE ES ESTO?" MRS. HOWARD TEACHING SPANISH TO IOWA VOLUNTEERS.
out of a bad scrape down there by
knowing a few words of Spanish."
Miss Hodgklnson returned â¢to town
with her idea in the embryonic state.
If it had been an idea in Latin, so to
speak, it might have developed on the
spot; but Miss Hodgkinson is not a
teacher of the Spanish tongue. She did
not know even the best text-books to
offer the men anxious to learn Spanish
for the good that it might mean to them
at war in Manila. The one she had to lend
was for a two years' course, to be taken
with all the aid of a teacher. She
called Mrs. Howard into consultation.
She told her about the man who was
studying alone and under disadvan
tages in camp, and she told what the
sergeant had said, and she asked Mrs.
Howard's advice about text-books for
distribution in camp â for Miss Hodg
kinson's idea had developed as far as
that.
"They have so little time," she said.
"And the book will have to take the
place of a teacher."
"That sort of book hasn't been writ
ten, has it?" said Mrs. Howard. "I'd
like to talk to Mr. Howard about this."
Miss Hodgkinson waited hopefully
while Mr. Howard was being talked to.
These are the sweet, brief summer days
of teachers' idleness. Miss Hodgkinson
was willing to gi-e the morning hours
A MONUMENT TO DEWEY.
How the Name and Fame of the Hero of
Manila May Be Perpetuated.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: Your editorial remark
concerning the monument to be placed at the junction of Market a*.d Cali
fornia streets was timely and well put.
Some writers are taking up the cudgels in favor of that particular spot
for a monument in honor of Admiral Dewey. There is no place too good
for a monument for that heroic sailor.
The writers take the ground that the business part of the city Is the
best place because Nelson's monument In Dublin Is In the business part
of that city. Many travelers think Edinburgh rather than Dublin is a model
city for art ana beauty. In the former the business part of the city lies
between two very high hills, namely Calton Hill and Castle Hill, on which
stand the monuments of Nelson and Burns and many other celebrities,
and for Dewey I would consider, in San Francisco, Telegraph Hill to be
appropriate; it must be "made a thing of beauty and usefulness; beauty
in peace, grand, graceful and fearful in war. Now it is an unsightly land
scape being quarried into and made more unsightly every day. It has
always been and should be' permitted to continue a protection to the har
bor against our strong sea winds that be \t upon the city and harbor most
of the summer. If the digging and quarrying is, allowed to go on until
it is taken ay.ay altogether vessels In the stream and at the wharves will
certainly (tc say the least) have very uncomfortable if not dangerous
berths. The work of the vandals should be made to cea at once.
On the top of the hin the city owns certain 50-vara lots, in addition to
â¢which enough private prop~*-ty should be condemned to build a modern
fortification with the necessary and proper approaches. The whole hill should
be properly laid out and terraced; a certain amount, say 600 feet of the water
front and the reclaimed property adjacent thereto, now the property of the
State, and private lands between these lots and the summit, should be con
demned and converted into a botanical garden, reaching to the summit of
the hill, on which should be constructed fortifications of the most modern
and enduring structure known to modern engineering, from which position
a plunging fire can be had to cover all parts of the bay. The property to
be deeded to the United States. The only condition being that its name
Bhall be changed from Telegraph Hill to Fort Dewey or Castle Dewey.
This would be a monument to Dewey that would perpetuate his name and
fame as long as the everlasting hills shall remain and the United States
of America, as a nation, continue to be known and respected by all people.
Yours truly, CHAKLES GOODAL.L.
San Francisco, July 7, 1898.
of her vacation to the service of her
country, t>ut she could not ask this sac
rifice of another.
And it happened she did not have to
ask, as Mr. and Mrs. Howard offered.
Mr. Howard said that he would pre-
I pare a sort of grammatical digest, from
which Mrs. Howard could instruct the
men in classesâ supposing, of course, a
sufficient number chose to take up the
workâ and in addition to this, advised
the distribution of good primary text
book?, from which the men could study,
read and translate, and in this way it
was decided that a lot of ground could
be got over in a short space of time.
The courtesy of the class was offered
to each regiment through its command
ing officer. Those who declined ex
plained that the schedule of the morn
ing duties left their men no time for
the work. Those who accepted placed
the Spanish lesson on the schedule and
detailed their men to it as to any other
military duty.
Miss Hodgkinson went shopping. She
called on Mr. Sims of the Red Cross
Society, and received as the contribu
tion of that body one hundred Spanish
primers. She called on Cunningham,
Curtiss & Welch and ordered one
hundred blank books charged to her
personal account. When the firm
learned for what purpose the books
were required Miss Hodgkinson
was told that there would be no charge
on them.
The first class of fifty men met on
Monday at eleven o'clock. On Tues
day one hundred pupils presented
themselves. On Wednesday came fifty
more. It was impossible to- handle
them in a body. Mr. Howard cheer
fully arranged to take them in three
separate classes. Non-commissioned
officers were consulted as to the con
venience of the camp and the teachers
accommodated their hours to the mil
itary regulations. The men in com
panies of fifty are marched from camp,
up First Avenue, through the Rich
mond schoolyard and into the class
room and then turned over to their
teachers to answer the roll â which is
taken back to camp by the officer in
charge â and left to return and report
at the conclusion of the lesson as after
any other military detail.
All sorts and conditions of men have
responded to the chance offered by two
generous women and one helpful man â
the university-bred student, with all
his classics behind him to help him on
with the new tongue; the men from the
woods, the farms, the prairie, and the
hills with their big ambition to
learn, strong and unschooled, with
in them; the non-com. in the
importance of his decorated sleÃves,
the trim privateâ in uniform, the
raw recruit without any â and all
patient, anxious, serious, attentive,
studious, grateful. They fill the nar
row forms to overflowing, turn their
men's faces upward like children to
the little teacher over them, huddle two
on a bench with arms about one an
other's shoulders, to share the still
short supply of primers, twist their
English tongues about the foreign syl
lable, pant and perspire and learn
Spanish with all their hearts and souls.
Mrs. Howard is as yet the only
teacher. Miss Hodgkinson is pressed
into service as helper at the forms, but
modestly declines the honors of in
structor in Spanish.
"I can read Spanish and follow a con
versation, but that is all," she said yes
terday morning in the classroom. "I
do not feel that I have the knowledge
to teach the language, or I would be
only too glad to help Mrs. Howard.
She needs help. I wish a few good
teachers would volunteer. It is a great
deal for one to do alone."
The one who is doing it alone, a very
small, energetic, dark-eyed, dark-haired
woman, stood before her big class of
big men with one little hand on her hip
and the other holding a book above her
head.
"Que es esto?" she said, the liquid
syllables dropping like honey from the
comb.
The class stared helplessly.
"Que es esto? This is a question."
They knew it. They had guessed it
from tne interrogative twist at the end
of it. But what help was that? Who
can answer an interrogation point with
out knowing what goes before it?
"Whatâ isâ this?" translated the lit
tle teacher, smiling.
Why, of course! How simple! They
had guessed it all along. And the sec
ond time it went beautifully, all in
chorus.
"Que es esto? What is this?"
Mr. Howard's grammatical digest
was finished at infinite expense at fine
writing and careful tabulation in a
large blank book. And from this Mrs.
Howard and Miss Hodgkinson must
copy each lesson of the day on to the
blackboard. And from this each stu
dent of Spanish must copy the same
into his blank book. "All of which takes
a deal of time and labor, and these
facts l^eing made known to the Red
Cross Society, some one in high author
ity has promised to print the little How
ard grammar in due form and sufficient
number.
And with plenty of primers and
plenty of grammars and plenty of
pluck and plenty of patience what more
do the Spanish Students of Camp Mer
ritt need?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
But Mr. Howard and Mrs. Howard
and Miss Frances Hodgkinson need a
little help.

Horrible Murder at the
Almshouse.
STICK AND KNIFE ARE USED
LOUIS PERRITT THE VICTIM
OF HENRY WILLIAMS.
The Deed Was Premeditated and No
One Was an Eye-Witness
to Its Accomplish
ment.
Two old men, Inmates of the Almshouse,
each over 70 years of age, had a fight
rday morning, and one murdered the
other in cold blood.
The murdered man was Louis Perritt,
\ who entered the Alms
bouse In 1894. All the attaches say that
he was an inoffensive old man. He Bpent

: in the canyon about half a mile
from the Almshouse, and had a shanty
where he kept his tools.
The murderer is Henry Williams. 73^
. go, who was sent to the Insti
tution six years ago. Unlike Perrltt, he
was always cranky and quarrelsome.
Imagining that there was a conspiracy to
harm him. He worked on a garden patch
â¢ a mile from Perritt's.
Tlif dinner hour at the Almshouse Is 11 !
k. and yesterday, just as Perritt j
had left his work to go to dinner, he met !
on the road WUllamÃ, who had purposely j
gone there to kill him. Williams carried j
a heavy stick, and struck Perritt on the
head with it. knocking him against the ;
fence at the side of the road. Williams
then jumped on Perritt, and they grap
pled with each other. Perritt was the ;
stronger of the two, and was getting the
r of the struggle on the ground,
when Williams pulled out a tableknlfe, |
which had been specially sharpened for j
n, and drew It aeon Perritt's :
throat. He cut him also at each side of j
rath, inflicting long, deep gashes, ;
and finished by thrusting the knife down
hla throat. The knife was broken with
i).< force of the thrust.
Nothing was known of the affray till
Williams walked into the office of Super- :
and startled him by say-

Introduced and fittingly responded.
it would seem that the work of the
nominating committee did not meet with
the approval of Home of the older mem
bers of th<- society, many of whom did
not 'vote. Tin last line in the following
raph, taken from the communica
te h member by the committee,
has caused the rub. It reads:
Wo respectfully state that it has been our
especial care. Irrespective of personal prefer
ences, to bring forward such candidates as we
reel have the best Interests of the society at
nenrt; and In view of the harmonious and sat
isfactory management of the society's affairs
for the past year, we have deemed It wise to
renonilnate a par! of the present board, feel
inÂ« that this will meet with the general aiÂ»
provai of our members.
In a communication to a friend Dr.
Washington Ayer sets forth his ideas,
which seem to have been acquiesced in
by some of his fellow-members. It is as
follows:
To-day v.a.a their annual election of officers
of the Society of California Pioneers for the
ensuing yr-ar. Bo far as outward appearances
indlcHN M but fyie sentiment, as there
wan but one ticket. Bat among the true pio
neersâthe old argonautH, there was a strong
feeling of dissatisfaction expressed against the
hereditary plan of getting up the ticket so as
to perpetuate certain parties In office and ig
noring the capacity ami right of the pioneers
to control their own affairs. They believe the
y~ - (n.arests. Integrity and dignity would be
SCENE OF THE STRANGE MURDER NEAR THE ALMSHOUSE
secured to the society by having all the offices
held by the old pioneers so long as they are ca
pable of performing the duties required, and
ft is a matter of surprise that the Junior mem
bers should have any voice in naming a ticket
and deciding questions pertaining to the gov
ernment of the society.
Many of tlie senior members feel they arÂ»
placed at the tail end of the kite which they
helped to make.
They very correctly say their organization
Is a part of the history of the State of Cali
fornia and ask what have the junior pioneers
done to make this history, except to be born
here twenty years after the State was admitted
to the Union. Their birth only added numerical
strength to the population. It was only by the
evolution of circumstances that they became
members of the Society of Pioneers, and not
by the force of physical energy, which chisel
ed from the granite, pounded from the Quartz
or gathered from the auriferous hills and
gulches the wealth which gave grandeur, en
terprise and commercial Importance to the
State, and it seems very strange to those who
have no sons that they should be placed with
the "back numbers."
NARROW ESCAPE FROM DEATH.
Surveyor General Gleaves Hurled
Down a Mountain Side.
Surveyor General Gleaves had an ex
perience a few days ago that he will not
forget for many a day. At least not
until a fractured rib has had time to"
mend and become whole again. Last
week Mr. Gleaves had occasion to make
an extended trip through Nevada and
the mountainous part of this State ly
ing in Mono and several of the other high
Sierra counties. While on his way home
he was obliged to stage it from Bridge
port to Sonora and Jamestown, Tuolumne
County. The descent from the summit
in places is very sharp and the steepness
of the grades is calculated to make any
but the old stagers very nervous.
At one of the steepest places the driver
set his horses imo a run and down the
grade the team flew as though pursued
by the old Nick. The Surveyor Genera!
did not scare worth a cent, as he had
enjoyed such rides down the mountain,
grades of the northern parts of the Sr.ate
many a time. All would have been well
but for one of the leader's check reins
getting caught over the hames >n the
mate. This happened at one of the sharp
turns, and before anything could be done
the stage was Jerked out of the road,
bounced on top of a two-foot log on the
outer edge of the grade and down the
side of the mountain. No one had time
to jump, and Mr. Gleaves made a flight
down the mountain landing many yards
down below the road. A second later thÂ«
driver landed square on top of the pros
trate official, and without stopping to see
what damage had been done he contin
ued his flight from the ricochet on Mr.
Gleaves' anatomy, finally fetching up on
top of a brush pile.
After an hour's chase the driver caught
the horses and found only a small pi
of the harness broken. The stage was
removed from the top of a grove of small
pir.es and. strange to say, it was not
damaged. Not so with the passenger.
He suffered much pain, and upon arriving
at Jamestown he learned that one of his
ribs had been broken. He has been con
fined to his home for several days, but is
now attending to business, although the
fracture Is not yet healed, and is still
painful.

HOW DEWEY
WAS GUIDED
TO MANILA
Kilpatrick Says He
Was Piloted.
STEERED BY A BRITISHER
CAPTAIN TAYLOR OF THE ES
MERALDA DENIES IT.
Two Accounts of the Famous Entry
Into the Island Bay Before
the Great Naval
Battle.
When history reviews the great fight of
Manila Bay on May 1, Ik9B, and sums up
the elemental particulars of Dewey'a
great naval victory, more than one para
graph will be devoted to the passage of
the ships through the tortuous channels
Into the harbor where the battle was
fought. The steamer Rio de Janeiro,
which arrived yesterday, had a passenger
on board who tells a story bearing on the
entrance of the American fleet into Ma
nila Bay and which has never before been
published.
The name of the passenger on the Rio
de Janeiro Is Kilpatricft, and he is con
nected with the Jardine-Mathieson Mer
cantile Company In the capacity of sugar
expert. He has lived in the Philippine
Islands for some time, located at Luzon,
a email town about forty miles from Ma
nila. - v
Just prior t6 the battle of May 1 Kilpat
rick left Manila on the steamer Esmer
alda, bound fur Hongkong. As his story
runs the Esmeralda, a steamer running
between Manila and Hongkong under
Captain Taylor, had just passed the last
landmarks of the shore when it came
into sight of the American fleet under
Commodore Dewey. The Esmeraxda was
flying a British flag, but It was, never
theless, ordered by a signal from the
Olympia, Dewey's flagship, to heave to.
Captain Taylor answered the signal of
the Americans, and after a lapse of a few
minutes a launch was lowered from the
Olympia, The Esmeralda had completely
stopped its onward progress by this time
and awaited the coming of the launch
manned by American sailors. Captain
Taylor then left his ship and went away
in the Olympia's launch. This happened
on April 30. He did not return until the
morning of May 1. When leaving his ship
Captain Taylor gave orders that the Es
meralda should anchor just outside the
harbor and await his return. The thun
der of the battle reached the ears of the
Esmeralda's passengers soon after Cap
tain Taylor had returned to his ship, and
the order to hoist anchors had been
shouted to the crew. ... , , ,
Captain Taylor knows the channel lead
ing into the bay as if it were a clear.
written book. For years he has piloted
his ship past Cavlte and into the harbor.
Not a bar, a projecting rock or a mine
but was known to him. He it was, accord
ing to the statement of Kilpatrlck, who
steered Dewey through the harbor past
the dangers of subterranean mines and
placed him in a position to begin the battle
which has proved the greatest water
light in the history of the 'world. Kilpat
rlck is certain that Taylor was Dewey's
pilot for the eventful passage through the
channel. In no other way can he explain
Taylor's absence during the night of April
80th and the morning of May Ist.
Kilpatrick's version is as follows;
"1 am a sugar expert and was sent to
Luzon, about forty miles away from
Manila, for the purpose of looking min
utely into the affairs of the plantation at
that place. I was representing the Jar
dine-Mathieson Mercantile Company.
"The steamer Esmeralda, which has
been running between Manila and Hong
kong for many years past, was at Manila
and had taken on a cargo prenaratory to
departure. I obtained my ticket and
went aboard on the last day of April. The
Esmeralda put to sea in the arternoon
and started through the circuitous chan
nel on her way to Hongkong.
"We were going along at a good rate of
speed when we sighted the American
squadron hanging away off port. At first
there was no apparent notice paid to the
steamer Esmeralda but it was not long
before the signal flags of the Flagship
Olympia called the Esmeralda to a halt.
Captain Taylor arrived on deck and fn a
cool and deliberate manner began to give
orders for the slackening of speed of the
Esmeralda. An answer riew from the
mast of the steamer and. in a short time,
a launch from the Olympia arrived along
side. Without saying a word and all the
while puffing away at his\cigar. che cap
tain got into the lauch and was soon on
his way to the Olympia. Orders had in
the meantime been given the next officer
in command to hover off port until he
should return to his ship.
"Captain Taylor then went aboard the
Olympia, and that is the last thing we
saw of him until early next morning.
When he got aboard the Esmeralda again
anchors were weighed immediately, and
we were off for Hongkong just "as the
first shots of the engagement at Manila
were bolrtg lircd. All steam was put on,
and the Esmeralda soon lost sight of
Manila.
"Where was Captain Taylor during the
night? Well, he was only piloting the
American fleet, with the Olympia in the
lead, into Manila Bay. He has traveled
in and out of the channel for years, and
no one knows the surroundings as well as
he. Do you wonder none of the mines
exploded? He did his work well, and wan,
no doubt, well paid. No other man could
have steered that fleet through the rocks
and sand as Captain Taylor did in the
darkness of the morning. When the work
was done he got into a launch again and ,
was off to Join us at our position outside
the harbor."
AS?Â« conclusion to his story, Mr. Klrk
patrick said: "Captain Taylor has not
been back to Manila since. He has found
better business for tho Esmeralda in
Japan."
But Kilpatrick's version 1* not the only
one. Captain Taylor has his story to tell,
and it is in flat contradiction to that of
the sugar expert. Captain Taylor saya
that the Esmeralda was steaming into
the harbor of Manila and that the Ameri
can fleet followed him. He denies all con
nection with the piloting of Dewey's ships
into the harbor. He claims that the Es
meralda went into the harbor with cargo
and passengers, but not as a pilot to any
one. "
The feeling among the Spanish in Ma
nila over this incident is extremely belli
cose. They are in a fury over the actions
of Captain Taylor, and it is reported that
the matter will perforce provoke inter
national complications between Spain and
England. From information received here,
Captain Taylor is an Austrian by birth.
The momentous question is, "Where does
his citizenship lie?

An Investigation.
There was a meeting last night at 22
Geary street of the Pacific Coast Board
of Review, the local representative body

Ex-Special Officer John Mclntyre
Commits Suicide.
Ex-Special Officer John Mclntyre, 700
Broadway, committed suicide last night
by swallowing carbolic acid. For the past
few months he has been despondent
owing 1 to his many misfortunes. He bur
ied his wife last December and recently
he sold out his "beat," since which time
he has been out of employment.
Mclntyre frequently threatened to end
his existence, but no attention was paid
to him. The last person to whom he said
he was going to commit suicide was Po
lice Officer Peshon, who tried to dissuade
him. Thinking he might be in earnest
Peshon notified Mrs. Lambert, Mclntyre's
landlady. At 11 o'clock last night she
went to his room and found him dead.
The deceased has a brother in this city
who is an attorney, and also two sisters.

MEN OF WOODLAND REFUSE TO
ENTER THEIR COUNTRY'S SERVICE
DAPT. WARD OF WOODLAND WRITES.
He Asks for Reasons and Offers to Muster In His
Company on Receipt of the Same.
CAMP BARRETT. July 7. 1898.
Editor Callâ Sir: In justice to the officers and men of my command, the
ocality whence we came and to myself, I beg to explain our position In this
infortunate affair.
When the first call for volunteers came Company F, Second Infantry. N.
3. C, of Woodland was one of the first to offer its services. When finally
ive were called upon we came into camp, determined to do our duty to our
State and to our country. The members of this company understood that
their regular officers would be retained, provided they passed the necessary
Mra urination, as had been the case with other National Guard organiza
tions: if they failed to pass such examination no favor was expected to be
shown thorn.
I have been a member of Company F for ten years, serving in every ca
pacity from private to captain, and being in command for nearly a year. I
lave successfully passed every examination required of me. Since reeeiv
ngr information that I have been superseded I have used every means In my
power to ascertain the cause, but have been unable to learn of any reason
whatever. Colonel llcnshaw says he knows of none, and it appears to me
that it is simply a ease of favoritism. I have Informed Colonel Henshaw
that 1 am willing to undergo any test as to my ability the commander in
?hief may see fit to impose, and if I am found deficient In any particular 1
will enlist in the ranks and willingly serve under a more capable officer.
My men have elected to refuse to enter the service without me unless
some good reason is given them why I should not retain the captaincy and
n this they are supported by their fellow townsmen of Woodland and vicln
ty. If I am given one good reason why I should be superseded I will guar
mtee to have my command in line before the mustering officer in five min
utes. J. J. WARD,
Captain Commanding Company F, Second Regiment Infantry, N. G. C.
GUARDS from the Fourth United
States Cavalry and Fourteenth
United States Infantry, under
the command of commissioned
officers, have been placed aboard
the steamers Peru and City of Puebla.
Troops assigned to the fourth expedi
tion may march to the ships next Sun
day.
The reports from Suez that the war
ships of Camara's squadron have
passed through the canal bound for the
Philippines do not seem to cause any
apprehension in the mind of Major
General Otis. He has probably received
assurances that Dewey and Watson
will take care of Camara. As soon as
ships can be secured all the troops of
the Eighth Army Corps remaining in
San Francisco â will be dispatched to
Manila.
WOODLAND MEN
REFUSE TO ENLIST
One Company Assigned to the
Eighth Regiment Decides
to Return Home.
CAMP BARRETT, Fruitvale, July 7.â
Woodland and Yolo County will not be
represented In the Eighth California Vol
unteers. The members of Company F,
Second Infantry, N. G. C, lately desig
nated as Company M of the new regiment,
have refused to be mustered into the
United States service because their cap
tain was not to continue in command, and
to-morrow, disarmed and stripped of their
accouterments, they Will march out of
camp and return to their homes.
In adopting this course, they have acted
upon the advice of their friends, and al
though they may be dismissed from the
Stato service, they feel that oven this dis
grace Is preferable to what they consider
would be desertion of their captain.
In marked contrast to the action of the
Woodland company is that of the men
from Redding. They, too. have lost their
captain, a brave and efficient officer, and
another has been appointed In his stead.
At nrst the men from Shasta and Siskiyou
were inclined to adopt the same course as
the others, but wiser counsels prevailed.
Had Captain Smith said the word, his
mi-ii would have stood by hjm to the last;
but it was he who pointed out to them
that they owed a higher duty to their
gtate and to their country than to any one
man, and finally they heeded his words
and revived to answer the nation's call.
Captain Smith's loyalty will not go un
rewarded, for he was given to understand
to-night that he would receive a first
lieutenant's commission in the regiment,
though it may not be with his old com-
To-day's exciting events in Camp Bar
rett have developed another man with pa
triotic sentiments as lofty as those shown
by Captain Smith, and though it may be
that the men from Chico are not given
an opportunity to show their true worth
on the field of battle, the State will know
that in Private L. Bond no truer soldier j
can be found. Bond came into camp {
holding a second lieutenant's commission j
In his company, but when the appoint
ment of officers for the volunteer regl- |
ment was published it was found that his
name was not included in the list. In
stead of returning home Bond reported to
his captain that he still desired to go to
the front with his company, and so when j
the muster roll of Company A was hand- '
ed to Captain Murray this morning it ]
bore the name of Private Bond. He took !
the oath with his comrades and has laid
aside his sword and officer's blouse arid
will henceforth carry a gun.
Captain Murray resumed his work of
mustering in the companies at an early
hour this morning, and while Companies
L and A were undergoing the transforma
tion from National Guardsmen to United
States soldiers animated caucuses were
being held in the streets and tunts of
Companies M nnd H, the Woodland and
Redding organizations. The members of
the former would listen to no arguments
whatever. They were determined not to
enter the service unless they were given I
Captain Ward, and nothing could change
their determination. In this they were !
supported by several of their fellow
townsmen who visited the ramp, and j
many messages from their homes all '
tended to show that the entlrf community j
Indorsed the stand they had taken.
After a time the company was formed â 
In line and Captain Ward addressed the j
men briefly. He then Introduced Captain .
George B. Baldwin, who had been ap- i
pointed as his successor. Captain Bald- i
SHASTA AND SISKIYOU ARE LOYAL
W. E. Smith of Company H, Second Regiment,
Vouches for the Patriotism of His Men
and Is Ready to Fight.
CAMP BARRETT, July 7.
Kdltor Callâ Sir: Company H. Second Regiment, N. G. C, which I have
had the honor to command, in offering its services to its distressed country
did so with sentiments of the loftiest patriotism. Shasta and Siskiyou
counties Bend 120 men as their quota, and while my men hoped and expect
ed me to lead them, since the commander in chief has willed it otherwise
they will accept his decision and remain patriots still. It is my wish that
they remain loyal to their State and my every word has been to urge them
to stand by the regiment.
As for myself, if I am not to lead my old comrades. I remain ready to
serve my country in whatever capacity I may be called upon.
\V. B. SMITH.
v.-in spoke a few words and was loudly
cheered, more cheers following- for Cap
tain Ward. Then the men reiterated their
determination not to <-nlist unless Ward j
was reinstated. Ward hold a conference |
with Colonel Hcnshaw regarding the s!t- i
uation and the men reni wed their cau- I
cuseir.g. Private J. H. Dungan of the !
Woodland Mail urged them to remain
firm, for which he- was roundly cheered. '
The meeting between the colonel and j
Ward was very friendly but amounted to
practically nothing.
Meanwhile the northern men were con
ferring and loudly proclaiming that they
â would not give up their captain, but |
Smith sought to suppress all such talk, i
He went among his men and urged them â¢
to do their duty to their country regard
less of him. Others, and among them was
Code Commissioner T. W. H. Shanuhan.
counseled them in like manner, and llnal
ly the men began to waver. They request
ed Shanahan and Lieutenant Estep to
wait upon the Governor and ascertain
if there was any prospect of Smith's re
instatement and then they dispersed to
await the report of their emissaries.
During all this time the mustering of
ficer had been at work without wasting
a minute. Company L of Marysville was
the first to appear before him. Captain
Voss presented 104 enlisted men, but
neither of his lieutenants was present.
Company A of Chlco 102 men and all
three officers came up. Captain Cahill
NEVADA CAVALRYMEN IN VARIOUS EVOLUTIONS AT THE PRESIDIO.
lost three men most unexpectedly. Two
of them. Privates Strange and Clark, left
camp last night and failed to reappear.
Wh'-n the company was drawn up before
the mustering officer and the nature of
their duties and obligations explained to
the men Private Davis suffered a relapse
of valor, or an attack of cold feet, or
something, and fell out. He did not lin
ger around camp to learn what his com
rades had to say, but vanished while the
others were signing the rolls.
Company G of Alameda came next, but
was on<- man short of 100, and as the mus
tering officer refused to accept the col-
ored cook engaged by Captain Simmons,
as a soldier, the company was passed for
the time being and Company F of Oak
land called. Captain Wenk had 104 men
in line, besides his two lieutenants, and
no cold feet developing all wore sworn
into T'ncle Sam's service.
Company I of Grass Valley, 105 men,
besides Captn In Riley and Second Lieuten
ant Miller, was next called upon. Cap
tain Riley could bave tilled his command
to the maximum had he desired, for he
had seven men in reserve, but he pre
ferred to hoiu one vacancy open for
emergency.
Petaltima's contingent. Company C. was
the fifth of the day to enter the service
and 104 men, besides CaDtaln Barnes and
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 8, 1898.
Second Lieutenant Emerson, became Un
cle Sam's boys.
Then came the culmination of the re
volt in the Woodland company. In re
sponse to orders Captain Ward marched
his men up to headquarters, and was
asked for his muster rolls. He replied
that they were not ready, as his men de
clined to enlict except under certain con
ditions. Captain Murray, addressing the
command, asked how many were ready
to muster in under the officers named
by Governor Budd. Three stepped for
ward. Then he asked how many were
willing to enter a new company or some
other company of the regiment, and a
half dozen more came to the front. That
was all, and telling the few who were
willing to enter the service to report to
him later, he directed Captain Ward to
march the company back to quarters.
The boys were given a rousing cheer by
the men of the other companies, who ad
mired their pluck, if they did not indorse
the stand they had taken.
Hack in their company street the mem
bers began preparations to return home.
Quartermaster Heller took an inventory
of the State property held by the com
pany, and to-morrow afternoon the men
will return to Woodland. That they will
be dishonorably discharged from the
State service < is certain, for during the
afternoon Colonel Henshaw received an
order from the Governor to dismiss the
company If it refused to be mustered in,
first taking charge of the. State property
in its possession.
In the appointment of officers for the
Eighth California Volunteer Infantry
Governor Budd was guided by a deter
mination that only capable men should be
commissioned to lead the companies. An
Intimation was given to prominent men
.if Woodland that Captain Ward's record
as an officer of the National Guard would
not justify the Governor in commission
ing him to the responsibilities of com
mand.
In the light of events at Camp Barrett
the following letter written by Adjutnat
General Barrett more than two months
a^jo possesses special significance:
SACRAMENTO, March 31, IS9B.
Personal. (Copy. )
Hon. R. 11. Reamer, Woodland, Cal.â My
I">par Sir: Some time aco in a conversation
with you the matter of Company F. Second In
fantry, was discuÂ«sed, and you then informed
me that If the ofnVers did not keep up their
report! properly that you wished I would rail
your attention to the fact, anil you would try
und see that the business would be attended
to promptly. I now desire to call your atten
tion tr> the fact that Captain Ward was com
tnlnloned December 21, 1897, and since that
time his bond has not been filed In this office,
and there Is waiting- one quarterly allowance
($300) for the quarter ending December 31, 1897,
which cannot be forwarded to him until he
flies his bond, and thfie 1m also due the com
pany to-day $300 more, being for the quarter
ending March 31. IS9B. It will be necessary for
the commanding officer of that company to
make his reports mure promptly In the future
or there may be danger of complaints being
sent to the Board of Location and Organiza
tion, which might Jeopardize their position of
remaining in the National Guard of California.
There are many applications on file to take
all vacancies that might occur. It may be well
for you to call Captain Ward's attention to
this fact. Very respectfully,
A. W. BARRETT.
It is to be regretted after all that Cali
fornia has done to prove her loyalty to
the country that the men of one company
should falter and murmur because the
appointment of their officers was not sat
isfactory to them. It was hoped that the
volunteers from Yolo County would cast
aside their personal preferences and
etand by the country first, last and all
the time. Bad influences counseled thÂ«
men to a mutinous course, and a com
pany which might have gained honor and
distinction at the front now remains at
home to face the charge of disloyalty
which has been placed on the record of
the organization.
When the Woodland men left the field
Company G was again called, and this
time Captain Simmons had lt)3 men in
addition to both lieutenants, and the com
pany made the tenth of the regiment to
be mustered in.
While the Alamedans were signing the
rolls and the Woodland boys were pre
paring for their return to private life an
impressive scene was going on in the
Redding quarters. The men were formed
in line by First Sergeant Con H. Gold
berg, who addressed them in eloquent
terms as to the duty they owed their
country. He spoke in terms of warmest
praise of Captain Smith and his loyalty
In eounciling his men to be true soldiers,
and said that while he regretted to enter
the service without their old captain, he
felt it a duty they owed themselves, their
home, their State, and above all their
country, to do so.
Major Forbes, who is well known and
liked among the northern boys, pointed
out to them their path of duty, and then
f'aptain Smith stepped forward and again
urged thr-m, as he had done repeatedly
during the day, to forget him and
remember only the flag. Lieutenant Es
tep told of his visit to the Governor and
intimated that Captain Smith would go to
the front with the regiment. Corporal
Knowlton urged the men to enter the
service, and then Lieutenant Reynolds,
who failed to get a commission, bade the
boys a formal good-by after requesting
them to enter the United States service.
Then Captain Baldwin was introduced,
and gave them advice, after which Major
Forbes again stepped forward and said he
was assured that Captain Smith would be
given a commission in the regiment, if
not with his own men, then with some
other company.
Calls were made for Code Commissioner
Shanahan, and he told of his visit to the
Governor. He spoke as a citizen of the
neighborhood from which the men came
and he, too, urged them, for the sake or
Shasta and Siskiyou, to be true to their
country. Each speaker was loudly ap
plauded, and when Sergeant Goldberg
called for a vote on the proposition to be
mustered in every man in line voted aye.
Later the men prepared a petition to
the Governor, respectfully requesting him
to assign Captain Baldwin to the com
mand of Company H, the petition being
presented at a late hour. The Governor
deferred action until morning.
The Governor has not yet decided what
organization shall be admitted to the
Eighth Regiment to fill the vacancy
caused by the withdrawal of the Wood
land company. Numerous dispatches ten
dering men were received at State head
quarters last evening. Some companies
are pleading for permission to get in. It
is thought that the contest for admission
is narrowed down to four comhpanies. The
Napa company stands a good chance of
acceptance, but the Governor may decide
to muster in a company from Nevada
City. In the exercise of his judgment he
may not accept either, because Oakland
and Sacramento stand ready to supply
the needed troops for the regiment. In
the acceptance of men the Governor, so
far, has given the National Guard every
thing. Organizations outside of the guard
have not been considered. In view of this
fact, there is a widespread feeling that
other volunteers should be recognized.
Although not announced officially, yet it
is intimated very absolutely by those in
a position to know that the Santa- 43ruz
company will take the place in the Eighth
Army Corps of the Woodland company,
which refused to be mustered into the
United States service.
The Governor and adjutant general re
gard Captain Lyons as an officer of ex
ceptional ability and experience. His rec
ord in the National Guard is without a
blemish. The Governor served in the
ranks as a private under Captain Lyons
at a time when the guardsmen of the
State provided their own uniforms and
paid the expenses of tue service from
their own means. Captain Lyons was
then active and efficient, and since that
time he has kept in harmony with the
spirit of military- progress. The Gover
nor believes that thÂ« . captain would
Ptudy the enre and eomtort of t"he men in
the Held, and if rations and clothing were
to be. had the captain would get them for
his men.
The Redding company to a mwi has pe
titioned Governor Budd for the retention
of their captain. George Baldwin, but at
a late hour it was understood that the
executive had declined to swerve an inch
from his position. It is said that he had
replied definitely that if the company
wished to go to the front it must do so
under the orders of Captain j^yons.
CREDIT DUE THE ARMY.
Words of Praise From Rear
Admiral Miller for Shafter's
Forces at Santiago.
It is somewhat refreshing. In the face
of the recent brilliant naval victories, to
hear a naval officer speak in high praise
of the land forces.
"I was much pained upon reading Rich
ard Harding Davis' criticism of General
Shaf tor's campaign and his battles at San
tiago," said Rear Admiral Miller, yester
day. "I firmly believe that General Shaf
ter did everything In his power. It strikes
me that he has covered himself with
glory and has accomplished a great re
sult. It was General Shafter who made
it possible for our squadron to destroy
the Spanish, fleet. It was Shatter who
compelled Cervera to make his dash out
of the harbor to meet certain destruction
and have Santiago soon to fall into our
hands. Shatter has done nobly. He has
done enough already to deserve well of
his country, and I hope no one will at
tempt to take away from him a single
lÂ«ta of the credit that is fairly his. The
destruction of Cervera's fleet removes a
load of anxiety and paves the way for an
early ending of the war.".
TriE MANILA TRANSPORTS.
Scarcity of Steamers Will Delay
the Shipment of the Remain-
der of the Forces.
The formal order designating the troops
that will constitute the fourth Manila ex
pedition, to sail early next weeK, will not
be Issued by Major General Otis until to
morrow. The order will not change the
composition of the expedition, as an
nounced In yesterday's Call. The troops
that are to go are all in readiness to em
bark at any time, and are anxiously wait
ing for the order to go on shipboard.
ADMIRAL MILLER'S MISSION.
He Will Convey to the Hawaiian Government President
McKinley's Proclamation of Annexation.
Rear Admiral Joseph N. Miller, U. S. W., yesterday received information from Washington that he Is to
be sent to Honolulu on a special mission, and the inference is that It is in connection with the transfer of the
Islands of the Hawaiian republic to the United -Itates under the annexation bill which has just been passed
by Congress. He expects to get Instructions early next week defining his duties.
As intimated In the dispatches there will be no very formal ceremony in making the transfer. Rear
Admiral Miller will probably convey to the Hawaiian Government the proclamation of President McKinley
and present to President Dole a commission as Go-ernor of the new territory, and after the Hawaiian Legis
lature takes action in regard to the matter the Elands will then pass under the dominion of the Stars and
Stripes. The day on which this event occurs will, of course, b^ celebrated by the Hawaiians and the repre
sentatives of the United States.
Rear Admiral Miller need not necessarily proceed to Honolulu on a Government vessel. He may go on the
next mail steamer, which leaves San Francisco on the 13th. The five commissioners who will be immediate
ly . pointed by President McKinley will in all probability accompany him and carry out the programme of
annexation.
It was expected that tne new cruiser Philadelphia would be equipped in lime to make this memorable
trip to Honolulu, but it is impossible to get her ready. The Bennington, however, will be s^nt to Honolulu to
participate in the demonstration and sh? will be prepared for sea to-morrow. Should Rear Admiral Miller
conclude not to sail on the mail steamer he will make the trip on the Bennington.
The Peru is practically in condition to
receive the troops assigned to her, and
the City of Puebla will come off the dry
dock to-day, and will be ready for the
reception of the soldiers on Sunday.
Every effort will be made to get these
transports started for Manila on next
Tuesday, and if they don't sail on that
day they will positively take their de
parture on Wednesday.
The Rio Janeiro, which arrived in port
yesterday from Hongkong, will be taken
by the Government for transport pur
poses, and will sail with the fifth Philip
pine expedition. The Pennsylvania will
also be chartered. One of her owners,
Mr. Grlscom, is now in Washing-ton to
close the matter with the War Depart
ment. Telegrams are expected from
Washington this morning announcing the
fact that these two steamers have been
taken by the Government. Immediately
upon the receipt of this Information the
steamers will be pot in readiness as rap
idly as possible for the voyage to Ma
nila.
No definite understanding as to the em
ployment of the sailing vessel Tacoma
as an animal transport has yet been ar
rived at. and instructions from Washing
ton are looked for at any hour. Should
the Tacoma be chartered a detachment
of the Fourth Cavalry will be sent with
her to take care of the horses.
It is estimated that it will require at
least fifteen more steamers to transport
the remainder of the Philippine expedi
tionary forces, and to secure this number
of transports will take some time, as
there is a scarcity of available steamers
at present.
The Centennial Is anchored In the
stream, and no one seems to know what
is to be done with her. If the Govern
ment decides to use her as a transport
she will be put on the dry dock and over
hauled.
The United States steamer Albatross,
the flagship of the mosquito fleet, came
down from Mare Island yesterday and
anchored in the stream. She may accom
pany the cruiser Philadelphia to Hono
lulu, should the latter be sent to the isl
ands, when ready for sea. The Philadel
phia, however, will not be fully equipped
for a sea voyage before the end of this
month.
MAY GO TO HAWAII.
Troops at Camp Merritt May
Be Sent There Forth
with.
It was reported at Camp Merritt yes
terday that the War Department has
wired Major General Otis Instructions in
regard to the next expedition that will
leave here, which materially changes the
plans that have been made, and which
will certainly affect the disposition
of the remaining troops iiow at
Camp Merritt. Rumor has it that
in view of the recent annexation of Ha
waii, the Third battalions of the Eigh
tenth and Twenty-third Infantry will ac
company the Fourteenth Infantry when
it leaves here next week, and that these
troops will be definitely located at Hono
lulu. The Puebla will then return here,
and with certain coast vessels that have
been secured, all the troops at Camp
Merritt will be transferred to Honolulu.
The transports that have already gone to
Manila will be stopped at Honolulu on
their return, and all future expeditions
to Manila will be made up from that
point. Certain troops will be kept there
permanently, but the further selection of
what troops shall be sent to General Mer
ritt's aid will be determined after they
have been removed to Hawaii. The troops
can all be easily transported there In
three weeks from now, by means of the
many small vessels that can safely make
that short run, and the large transports
will be saved the time It would take to
come from Honolulu to S;in Francisco
and return. This rumor was very gener
ally the subject of discussion among the
officers yesterday, and it is believed to be
what the War Department intends do-
Ing.
Lieutenant Colonel Barnett of the Tenth
Pennsylvania Regiment is expected here
the tlr'st of the week with 24S recruits for
that regiment.
Orders have been Ipsucd to Major
Goodal. commanding the Third Battalion
of the Twenty-third Infantry, to move his
camp to-day to the site formerly occupied

order to give the First New York the en

ler's headquarters, which has been the
camp of the Twenty-third Regiment.
It Is reported that the Chaffee Light
Artillery of Denver, Colo., has been or

gratulating themselves that they were

The Spanish citizens of Montevideo
raised $1,000,000 early in the war and fitted
up the Temerario, a 200 foot and 22 knot
as a torpedo boat destroyer. The
avowed intention of the vessel
was to intercept and, If possible,
destroy the Oregon. Being unsuc

has been cruising about near Montevideo,

B ly before the arrival of the Pennsyl

American sailing vessels in the port. The
United States consul heard of the plot
and asked the protection of the Argentine

that the Temarario was ordered out <>f the
harbor and 1 Â« ft on .May 15, ihe day be

When the steamer came into the har-
Dor the United States consul came aboard
and congratulated Captain Dozman on
his having been successful in escaping an
encounter with the Spanish vessel. The
wife and daughter of the consul were
with him on the ship a good portion of

great delight at being able to stand once
under the American Hag. They said
that while they received good treatment

COURSING OFFICIALS
ARE STILL AT OUTS
CONTROL CF INGLESIDE PARK
YET IN DISPUTE.
Mrs. "Jack Dalton and the Donovan
Faction Have Not Reconciled
Their Differences.
Notwithstanding the statements that
matters have been arranged satisfactorily
among the various parties at interest in
Ingleside Coursing Park, such is not the
case apparently. No change has taken
place in the management of the park and
the sport will be conducted to-morrow
and Sunday as it has been during the
past two years.
Harry Brennan, brother of Mrs. John
P. Dalton, who owns a half-interest in
the park, said yesterday: "The published
statement that the Inter-state Coursing
Club will handle the sport at Ingleside is
not true. How can the club make ar
rangements to assume control when our
people, who own a half interest in the
property, 'have not been consulted in the
matter?
"I am sorry to see that Dominion
Shannon, Mr. Halpin, Mr. Elmer, Mr.
Grace and the so-called Inter-state Cours
ing Club would lend themselves to this
scheme, knowing well that it is only one
more trick of the cunning Donovan to de
prive the widow of the late John P. Dal
tion of her just rights. She is no party
whatever to any such arrangement.
"She has not been consulted In .the
matter, although owning a half interest
in Ingleside Coursing Park. I deny Dono
van's assertion, flatly, that he has ever
come to the lady or her lawyers. Sulli
van & Sullivan, and offered his interests,
as has been stated.
"He did make an offer to Mrs. Dalton
for her interest in the park, but this offer
was contingent upon the park paying a
profit for a whole year, or Mrs. Dalton
was not to receive a cent. This was Mr.
Donovan's proposition. The offer was re
jected, as it was not considered a busi
ness proposition. The park is now on a
paying basis. Whatever Mr. Donovan
has offered has had a string to it. If he
and his friends, composing the Inter
state Coursing Club, desire to conduct
the park on their lines they can only do
so after purchasing the interest of Mrs.
Dalton."

AMATEUR BOXERS.
Gus Koster Defeats Recomi in the
Gymnasium of San Francisco
Athletic Club.
The monthly boxing exhibition of the
San Francisco Athletic Club provided rare
sport last night. The principal bout waa
for six rounds between Gus Koster and
George Recomi.
The police stopped It in the fifth round,
as Koster was making a chopping-block
out of his lighter opponent. In the first
three rounds Recomi made a gallant
stand against unequal odds as to weight.
From that point to the finish he lost
ground.
The bout between William Dean and
William Dierks was declared a draw after
six rounds of fast fighting. Dierks was
plucky, and overcame a strong lead which
nis opponent gained in the earlier rounds.
The first preliminary bout was of three
rounds' duration between a brace of light
weights, Perry and Kay. â  The boys
warmed to their work in the first round
and were at It, hammer and tongs,
throughout the three rounds. Â»
Ennis and McCarthy boxed three short
rounds. The former, who is one of the
hardest hitting feather-weights on the
coast, toyed with his opponent. He is
muscled like a lightweight, and is a natu
ral fighter. He hustled McCarthy all over
the ring, and the three rounds hardly
made an exercise gallop for him.
Republican Clubs Are Active.
The United Railroad Republican Club
held an enthusiastic meeting at Washing
ton Hall. 35 Eddy street, last evening.
There was a large attendance. Two hun
dred and eighty paid applications were
entered In their roll book, making a total
membership of 400. The programme for
the evening comprised the following: The
War Medley, by the Market Street Rail
way Band, composed by Will Ramsey; a
speech on political economy by H. G.
Davis, sings and recitations by F. Lane,
Mr. Robertson, Louis Yollup, P.Â«J. Man
ning and Mr. Will. Ramsey.
Thumped a Sailor.
A. Croskey, first officer of the American
Bteamshlp Pennsylvania, was arrested by

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, July 7.â To-day's advance In
prices was probably intended as an admoni
tion to the bear party that they were not to
be allowed to have their own way in forcing
down prices even in the existing dullness of
speculation. To-day's buying gave no indication
that it crew out of an urgent desire for the
ownership of securities, but seemed rather an
organized effort to mark up prices. There was
come covering of short contracts induced by
the advance, but nothing to show that there
could be any large outstanding short Interest
In the market. The advance in Sugar may have I
been due to buying by shorts to realise their j
profits on the adoption of the Hawaiian annex
ation resolution by the Senate, and probably
the demand from this quarter Induced more
bidding of the stock to exert pressure on the
ehorts. The buying of the Vanderbilts was
clearly a professional manoeuver by large bull
Interests. The gain in these stocks ranged from !
1 to 2 points. The powerful sympathetic effect j
which this group always exercises on the bal
ance of the list was shown by general response j
to-day after the opening depression caused by
lower prices in London. When the short-lived
buying of the Vanderbilts ceased the general
list showed a slightly reactionary tendency, j
but not sufficient to wipe out the early gains.
The rushing up of prices is clearly designed to
invite outside interest in the market.
There were special movements of note in the
rubber. stocks, and Manitoba, which Is guar
anteed to yield 6 per cent by Great Northern,
sold ur> 4 points and was bid up before the
close 2 points further to 151. The pending ad
journment of Congress and renewed reports that
Spain was about to sue for peace, tended to
help the rise. Reports of railroad earnings
were also encouraging, handsome advances be
ing shown over the corresponding period of last
year outside the grain-carrying roads, on which
the traffic reached abnormal proportions.
Bonds were steady. Total sales $2,300,000.
Government bonds were unchanged throughout.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 201.200
shares. Including: 4255 Canadian Southern, 11,
860 Burlington, 6538 Manhattan, 17,850 New York
Central, 12,528 North American, 6160 Northern j

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 7.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
market here was dull and uninteresting to-day,
the continuance nf the war preventing any ex
pansion of business. The rise in market dis
count rates, and the gold withdrawals from the
Bank of England have temporarily checked the
demand for investment, but I think with to
day's efflux of Â£140.00 i) In German coin the de
cline Is nearing an end. It is reported that the
Transvaal has arranged a loan of Â£I,ooo,o<mi
privately. This sum, however, would only
render very temporary assistance.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. July 7.â Fine weather and the be
lief that while the crop has suffered a good
deal of damage there will still be a phenom
enally large yield, started wheat weak. The
fact that Liverpool markets failed to respond
to the strength displayed here yesterday was j
discouraging and led' to liberal liquidation
by longs. After backing and filling for half
an hour at around opening figures some sell
ing orders from St. Louis gave the market a
more decided trend toward still lower figures.
From some items of news concerning crop
prospects the general crowd had become bear- 1
ishly impressed before the St. Louis selling '
orders came, bo that the appearance of a bear ,
leader found a well prepared band of willing I
followers. This, together with Snow's esti- |
mate of 700/I*. WO bushels of wheat crop, led
to free liquidation and shorts selling. Sep
tember dropped to 68VÂ»c and July lost %c.
There was a slight rally near the close. For ;
the first time within the remembrance of any
member of the board there was not a carload
of wheat received here. July left off %c lower
and September lost lÂ«l%c.
Rains in the southwest and aggressive sell
ing by parties who were buyers weakened
! corn. The shipping demand continued good.
July declined easy at the beginning with corn,
Oats were easy at the beginning with corn,
but closed firm on bullish crop reports. July
closed unchanged from yesterday. *
Another light run of hogs and an advance in
prices at the yards caused continued strength
in provisions. There was some outside specu
lative trade and a good demand both on foreign
and domestic account. Pork, rose 22% c. lard

The weekly State report of Weather Ob

to Prunes In the Panta Clara Valley by the
hot -wind nf last week.
, It says that Prunes on irrigated land are all j
right, but that fruit in untrrigated orchards
â will probably not amount to much. Local deal
ers have lately sent agents down Into the val
ley, and they report a marked shortage In
the crop as compared with last year, the con

the valley. " â

He Denounced Republicans as "The Gang"
and Gloried in the Fact That Demo

Alameda County is now being regaled
â with one of the most artistic pieces of
political buffoonery that It has ever been
her pleasure to witness. Years ago one
of the most talented of coast writers
dubbed this city "the hatchery of the un
expected." Many efforts have been made
by men In every element of social, politi
cal, commercial and religious life since
then to disprove this statement, and to
proclaim to the world that Oakland in
every particular is the most conservative
normal and astute city on earth. Their
arguments have in a measure proved suc
il, but it ha? been reserved for this
summer to produce the most remarkable
political farce that any one has ever had
the hardihood to try to palm off on an
intelligent Republican community.
y of the stalwart i:> publicans are
more than amused at the antics of a few
people who are putting forward a poli
tician of profv^ 'loan pro
clivities for the higl In the gift
of the party in this State. They a:
ferrlng to their scrapbooks to see if their
memories have failed them or if their
intellects are giving way. But they find
that neither of these misfortunes has be
fallen them.
Be Republican?, who were slandered
by Dr. Pardee a few years ago and again
more recently, cannot understand why
thn.Â«e who were denounced by him as
"the gang" should now be anxious to re
ward apostasy unless by doing so they
hope to reach some reward for them
peives.
The following extrart from Dr. Par

IN DIRE DISGRACE
THE PETALX7MA CAPTAIN BROKE
A PROMISE.
Fourth of July Committee Expected
Him to Keep His Word to De
liver the Oration.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, July 7.
Captain Barnes of the Petaluma Infan
try is in disgrace with the people of Oak
sent him to-day by
the Fourth of July committee that con
tains some etrong language. Such senti
ments sent to the brand new captain by
a private would be called insubordina
tion and probably end in the guardhouse,
but Oakland's Fourth of July committee
has a lady in it, and Mr. Barms" dis
courteous and unsolUierly treatment of
her has aroused her Indignation.
The committee having in charge the en- |
tertainment at the Macdonough Theater |
Monday afternoon had been given aj
promise â the promise of a soldier and a i
manâ that Captain Barnes would
â¢ l< er an address In
Oakland. He told Miss Mollie Connors,
the only lady on the committee, that it
â¢would be conferring an honor on him by
listening to him, and further stated that I
nothing but a call to Botae distant batle- j
field would prevent the engagement being
fulfilled.
There was no call to any distant battle
field last Monday, yet Mr. Barnes appear
ed ii"t. In the report of the committee
appears this Btatetnent: "The committee
begs to report that it has a.s yet received j
neither explanation nor apology from
Captain Barnes of tli< Petaluma com- j
pany. It had the captain's word for his
appearance, and while the committee per
sonally cures nothing about the matter,
it feels that courtesy is due to the Oak
land public, whom it r< presented. Cap
tain Barnes â  Idler,
and no doubt the proper explanation to
the Oakland public will be forthcoming
very shortly."
"Our committee does not care person
nlly about it," .-::i<l Miss Connors, "bat
ict was we could have bad one of \
il fine orators. We were deluged
with people who had a song to sing or aj
' :o Â»peak, and who wanted to be |
th< "ourth of July. We were
requested to get a re] tive South-!
< i-:i<ti -:i<t to speak, and we <liv so. We were i
asked to see Captain Barnes, and we did
not have to urge him. He said he liked
to speak in Oakland. We did not feel he
onferring an honor on us by coming
here, for Oakland Is a city of intelligent
people. An audience of cultured p<
assembled to listen to thr- orators, and 'â 
they know what to expect of gentlemen !
who are announced to appear tjefore
them. They also expect to hear a proper j
explanation from gentlemen who disap
point them. Personally we don't care a
rap for Captain Barnes' non-appearance,
but we think it is due the larce audience
that he explain or apologize."
New Name and Management.
OAKLAND, July 7.â Harry Jackson.who
for the past three years has been the
manager of the Hopkins Theater, Chi
nas taken charge of the old Oak
land Theater and will open it on the 23d
lnst., under th<- name of the Dewey Opera
Mouse. He is having it entirely remodel
ed, a smoking and lounging room f r

ream and refreshment parlor, and a

\ cry attractive.

OAKLAND, July 7.â Mrs. May Rogers,
of m Kirl.y avenue. Detroit, Mich., has

Btructed delegation to the State conven
tion, but pledged to .support an. Alameda

those who bolted from the Republican
Convention of four years ago.
I am also proud to say that I was
a member of the Citizens' Convention
that indorsed John Glascock (Dem
ocrat) for Mayor.
I regret to say that two years later
I was seduced into voting the Repub
lican ticket.
The Republican party is owned by
corporations.
Be faithful to yourselves, repudi
ate the Republican siren, steer safely
between the Democratic Scylla and
the Republican Charybdis. Elect the
Non-Partisan ticket and let Oakland
be what it has always claimed to be,
the Athens of the Pacific, imitating
the stern public virtues of the ancient
Greeks before the Athenian gang got
control of the Grecian State.â 5*, :c h o f
Georgi C. Pirdee at Tabernacle, February
16, 1893.
One joker in the party has suggested
that should Dr. Pardee be a candidate
before the State convention an 'introduc
tion committee" should be appointed to
introduce this "prominent Republican
from Oakland" to the leader of the party
which he professes to have served so
faithfully and long. This individual re
culls the fact that Dr. Pardee walked
out of one Republican convention because
he could not boss it; that three years ago
he threatened to bolt another one at Hay
wards for the same reason; that five years
aji'i he thanked God he had repudiated the
party, and that a little later he con
< that he had been "seduced" by the
Republican system and was sorry for it.
[t is recalled that Dr. Pardee was once
Mayor on a non-partisan ticket, on which
occasion he beat the regular nominee, one
of the best Republicans in the Stateâ Tim
!.. Barker. Jt is also recalled that two
years after his own election he practi
cally conducted the campaign for his
friend John W. Nelson, who was beaten
by ;i Populist, John L. Davie. On that
memorable occasion the Republicans de
termined to teach Dr. Pardee a lesson,
affected to support his candidate and then
showed their repugnance for Mr. Nelson's
affiliations by rejecting him at the polls.
Just when Dr. Pardee came back into
the Republican partyâ if he be backâ is
not known; but certainly it did not occur
until he again wanted something from the
party or w:;s willing 1 to serve some pur
pose, and then he calmly announced that
he was "out for Governor."
FUSION TICKET WINS
IN ALAMEDA COUNTY
;NO INTEREST TAKEN IN THE
PRIMARIES.
; Two Hours of Quarreling at the
Place Where the Forty-Eighhii
District Vote Was Taken.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 7.
The Populists of this county held a
primary this evening for the election of
del<-f ates to a county convention to be j
held in this city next Saturday. The busi
ness of the convention will be to elect
twenty delegates to the State convention,
which meets in Sacramento July 13. Three
delegates are to be sent from each of
I the six Assembly districts and two at
large.
Never has such a dull primary been
known in Alameda County. The remnant
of the party that existed two years ago
| is so divided that practically no party
j exists. There is a small wing of fusion
is! s and a small wing of middle-in-the
; road men. but the majority of the party
leaders have disappeared. Some of the
leading spirits are in the Klondike, oth
ers have renounced Populism and re
entered the Republican ranks, and the
r< meant is so disheartened that they fear
they will not be able to raise twenty dele
! gates to go to Sacramento.
The county committee met last night
and to the surprise of the few who at
1 ended nobody was willing to make a
tjreecn, Even ex-Assemblyman Brctz, a
most rabid antl-fusionist, would say noth
' ing. The men who were the backbone of
! the party are not at present In evidence.
Ex-Mayor Davie has not professed any
connection with the party for three years.
Ex-Judge Gibson has some intelligent
ideas al.out the recent issue of war bonds,
with which most of his old party dis
ncroe. Charles Gardiner has nublished
a" long letter claiming that he is now a
good Republican and regretting that he
was ever a deserter. Adna A. Dennlson,
a leader of "the short-hairs" three years
ago, and a man with some ideas, while he
is still presumably a Populist, takes good
not to have his name identified with
j the party.
So far as can be learned to-night the
fusionists will have a majority of the del
egates in the convention. The proceed
! ings at the Forty-eighth Assembly Dls
! trict primary showed that there is ab
solutely no interest in the party. In this
large district, embracing the most pop
ulous part of Oakland, only twenty-one
votes were cast.
There was about a dozen people present
iin Judge Cliffs courtroom, where the
primary was held, and for two hours
': there was a continual quarrel. There
were but eighteen names on the club roll,
and four of these demanded that their
names be taken off, as the whole busi
ness was a farce.
Mr. Uroadwater was very indignant and
declared that the fusionists had stuffed
the ballot box. This led to a lively de
bate and some warm exchange of opin
ions. Members challenged each other's in
tegrity and many bitter things were said.
The call for the primary was declared by
the judge E. Hougham to be illegal and
Boss Oglesby, who talked all the while
despite the forceful invitations to bequiet,
aspired to run the entire performance.
Mr. Silver declared that the affair was
run by the Democrats and spoke so freely
<.f the propensities of "Robber Maguire '
that much oil was necessary to smooth
the waters.
Finally it was found that ten fusionists
were elected and four middle of the road
ers.

bers of the club from this cjty will leave

An enthusiastic time is anticipated, and

Drawing the Color Line.
ALAMEDA, July 7.â Great indignation
was caused in this city to-day when it
was reported that Private TV. E. Lucas,
a member of Company G, had been re
jected because of his color, and that the
mustering- in of the company had to be
postponed in consequence. Lucas enlisted
some time ago and passed the examina
tion successfully. His forte is cooking,
and in accordance with his own wish he
was detailed to take charge of the- com
pany cooking, a task which he performed
to the utmost satisfaction of all hands.
Lucas was decidedly a persona grata witn
his comrades. The company was called
on this morning to be mustered in, it hav
ing just 100 men on the roll. To the as
tonishment of all Private Lucas was in
formed that he would not be accepted,
no other reason than color being given

the mustering officer did not want him
because of his color. This threw the com
pany below the requisite number and it?
muster had to go over. Another recruit
was at once secured, however, and the
company is ready to be sworn in to
morrow.
Lucas' friends outside the company do
not propose to let the matter drop. The
young man is the son of a veteran of

President MeKinley, Secretary of War

pose to find out whether a good patriotic
soldier can be rejected because he is dark
complexioned.
Five Horses Burned.
ALAMEDA, July 7.â A barn and dwell

occupied by Perato brothers, were burned
to the ground last evening. Five horses
imprisoned in the barn were incinerated,
their release being impossible. The fire,
which is believed to have been started
by the overturning of a lamp, caused a

ELI DENISON'S
CAREER HAS
TERMINATED
Dies at His Home Aft
er a Long Illness.
AN INFLEXIBLE REPUBLICAN
WORKED WITH RAILROADS FOR
OVER HALF A CENTURY.
His Name Inseparably Connected
With the News Agency of the
Southern Pacific Com
pany.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 7.
Senator Eli Sherwln Denlson died thl9
afternoon at his home in "West Oakland,
after a protracted illness of several
weeks. For many days past his condition
has remained unchanged, and but little
hope was held out for his ultimate re
covery. This afternoon, without any par
ticular change, he quietly passed away.
Wherever trains run on the Pacific
Coast Ell Denison was known. His ac
quaintanceship with California and its
peopte has grown with the spreading of
the Southern Pacific Railway. Senator
Denison and the railroad are terms which
always seem to go together, and by his
perseverance, activity and business ability
he built up an enormous business on the
system, which had made him rich, and
which is now so vast that it is believed
he has paid to the railroad company $25,000
for his privileges for the current year.
Next to being known as a railroad news
agent, Eli Denison has figured most prom
inently as a Republican. Since taking an
active part in politics in ISS4, when he
went to the National Convention as a del
egate, he has never swerved a particle to
the right or to the left, but has been a
persistent adherent of Republican prin
ciples.
In 1890 he was elected to the State Sen
ate, and has succeeded himself ever since,
although he caused it to be known several
months ago that he could not be a can
didate at the coming election. As a poli
tician every one in Alameda County
knows that Eli Denison was generous to
a fault. On every occasion when funds
were required for conducting a party cam
paign he could be depended upon for gen
erous support. He was decidedly popular,
and although, on account of his business,
the anti-railroad element regarded him as
an enemy, it was never able to hurt his
political record.
The deceased Senator came from Onon
daga County, New York, where he was
born in August seventy-one years ago.
At the early age of 13 he left his father's
farm and started out to earn a living for
himself. His first railroad employment
was on the New York Central, and after
a little experience there he went to Nica
ragua in 1849 as foreman of a gang en
gaged in constructing thirteen miles of
plank road between Lake Nicaragua and
San Juan.
Mining on the Feather River in Califor
nia and at other different points occupieu
his time until 1859, in which year he went
to work as baggageman on the Sacramento
Valley Railroad. Mining again occupied
h'm in 1562, when he went to Virginia
City to develop a quartz mine. A little
later he was employed by the Central
Pacific, his run being from Sacramento
to the end of the road eastward. This
run naturally increased as the building of
the read progressed, and he was one of
the spectators on May 12, 1869, who wit
nessed the driving of the golden spike
that united the Central and Union Pa-
cifie.
Pi Juno 1, 1869. Mr. Denison took the
position of news agent for the railroafl,
and foi twenty-nine years he has stead
ily followed that business. Every trav
eler In California is acquainted with the
cxtfnt of the business Mr. Denison built
up from the beginning. In 1890, with three
other ceritalists, he bought out the little
Laundry Farm Railroad, which was more
recently acquired by the Realty Syndl
CASTORIA
For Infants and Children.
The fÂ»8- _ yf
tlmlli /HM S/&/9 s? ~ 1 ***
cate end is now a part of Oakland's vast
system of electric railroads.
Mr. Denison was married in Sacramento
in 1 86S to Mrs. Celia Sloper, and their
chiloren, who now reside at the family
resilience, are Misses Lurana and Olive.
The deceased Senator was a member of
the Union Leagtie, of Tthama Lodge No.
3, Fre;. and Accepted Masons, at Sacra
mento, and of Golden Gate Lodge of the
Knights of Honor.
About a month ago* realizing that the
large news agency on the Southern Pa
cific system required more attention than
he cculd ever hope to give it again. Sen
ator Denison caused the incorporation of
his interests in the Denlson News Com-
During the thirty years of his experi
ence as news agent, the deceased has em
ployed hundreds of people, and by his
generosity many have been enabled to
make good starts in life. In Oakland
many are to be found who have great
cause to remember the dead Senator with
gratitude.
The funeral services of the late Sena
tor will be held Sunday afternoon at his
residence, at 2 o'clock.
The City Trustees.
ALAMEDA. JulW 7.â At the meeting of
the Board of City* Trustees last evening

referred the matter of the proposed elec
tion for the issuance of school bonds, re
ported that owing to the conflicting stat
utes regarding the issuance of municipal
bonds he did not believe it would be pos
sible to sell them even if they were sanc
tioned by the voters. Therefore he rec
ommended that the city do not Incur the
expense of $1000 or more necessary to hold
such election. No action was taken In
the matter.
The report of the Board of Health ad
verse to the establishment of a garbage
crematory on the marsh was received and
filed. In the meantime the erection of the
crematory is going on.
The application of hiohns & Kaltenbach
for a reduction of their delivery wagon
license from $100 to $60 was refused. This
is taken as an Indication of the probable
action of the board when the application
of the saloon-keepers for a similar pro
portionate reduction comes up.
LIGHTING THE STREETS.
The Supervisors Favor the Plan Sug
gested by the Merchants' As
sociation.
The question of lighting the streets was
under consideration yesterday by the
Street Lighting Committee of the Su
pervisors. The plan suggested uy the
Merchants' Association that the city be j
divided into districts and that bids be
invited for the lighting of each district
was favorably accepted.
President Baldwin of the' Merchants'
Association urged the district plan. He
said that it woul^ afford an opportunity for ;
others than the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company to bid, whereas if there
was a general bid calling for the lighting
of all the city competition would be shut :
off.
President Crockett, representing the
Gas and Electric Light Company, said
that any plan would be satisfactory to the
company he represented. ''We are willing i
to bid," said he. "for the entire lighting
of the city or any part of it."
Supervisor Clinton said that the tlnTÂ»
was coming when the city would have Its
own lighting plant and that it wouia be
advisable to commence on the work at
once by securing a plant.
After considerable discussion, it was de
cided to instruct Clerk Russell and Super
visor Rivers to draw up plans and speci
fications in accordance with the sugges
tions made by the Merchants' Associa
tion.
Woodbridge Canal Sale.
No bids were received yesterday by
United States Commissioner Heacock for
the sale of the property of the Wood
bridge Canal and Irrigation Company, and
the matter was continued until this morn
ing at 11 o'clock. ,

In bed, propped up with pillows and get what sleep" I could that 1 way. I could
not lie down; if I did I would feel a terrible choking sensation^ which made me
gasp for breath. Everything seemed to ferment the moment it got into my

FAVORITES' DAY
AT OAKLAND
Lou Handily Won Her
Maiden Victory.
KETCHUM AND REX WINNERS
JULIET D FELL DOWN AFTEB
WINNING A FAST HEAT.
Judges Were Not Certain as to
Their Jurisdiction in the Case
of Driver Thompson,
Notes.
There was right good racing at Oakland
yesterday, even though three of the win
ners outclassed their fields considerably
'and won easily.
The fast young mare. Lou. by Ira, he
by Piedmont, 2:17 V stopped to a record
of 2:lBV* in the 2:27 trot and defeated Ma
bel McKinney. the mare which took a
mark of 2:17 on Tuesrtsy. Lou was at Ito
2 and never in trouble. Donnthan merely
rated her so as to ge' the money without
a low record. She stepped to the half in
1:08 and it was then all over, for Mabel,
the only real competitor, couldn't live the
clip and was hitching along and appar
ently all out. Diana easily led the second
brigade home and the handsome chest
nut mare. Anna Bell, pulled up very lame.
Brice McNeil. 3 to 5 favorite, won the
2:40 trot nicely in 2:19H; Sable Frances
placed and rated second at 6 to 5 In the
betting: Silver Queen was not at herself
and succumbed to a sprint on the part
of Joe Selby down the stretch and fell
behind the money. She is fast, but It
Eimply was not her day. In the auctions
the field sold at 7 to 5 for Sable Frances.
The 2:17 pacers went three heats, as
young Durfee landed his big McKlnney
mare. Juliette D. first the opening trip
In 2:1,' I*21 *2 and showed a lot of Bpeed.
Ketchum was on his best behavior there
after and eloped it out In 2:lBVi. 2:19 1 -j, the
mare tiring and Fitz Aymon'a driver let
ting them get so far away the little black
couldn't quite reach on the stretch. In
the second heat a more determined drive
might have changed matters. William
Baker was a disappointment. It was a
good betting affair, Ketchum opening fa
vorite at 3 to h, then it was Juliette D at
2 to 5, and as they appeared for the last
heat Fitz Aymon h*d the call at 4 to 6.
Juliette has not had work enough as yet
to race where she can pace and certainly
should touch 2:12 when at feather edge..
Lynall was a prohibitive favorite at 1
to 2 for the 2:23 trot, and won easily over
Nellie Bly, Menlo B.Mie and Listerlne. He
outclasses them by seconds and won hands
down in 2:23. Hopoboom had merely to
steady him and let him go a work-out
away out in front. Nellie Bly showed
improved form, and was quite brushy,
but could not get near enough at the last
end of it to make it at all interesting.
Jimmy Sullivan won the last race with
Rex Alto, die of Walter Maben's side
wheelers, in 2:17, this time omitting the
customary break. Hex has a world of
speod any time when steady, and after
Staying back last to the head of the
stretch sprinted home too fast for Charlos
David, and won by a couple of open
lengths. Donathan never let up on David,
but he couldn't stall off Alto's rush for
the last quarter was :32-V and Sullivan
pimply sitting still. Price* were Rex Alto
3 to 5. Charles David even money and the.
others at 3 to 1. In the auctions It was
Rex 10, the field 7, and they played him
pretty stiffly at the quotations. He will
beat more than beat him ere the sÂ»a-
Bon's end. and few prettier moving pacers
can be found, he wearing merely quarter
boots, and not actually requiring even
them.
Nothing has yet been done about
Thompson's case, as the new rules leave
a little doubt as to the exact powers of
the judges, they having been modified
at last winter's meeting of the board,
and until the limitation of the Judges'
power in the premises is determined it is
considered better to postpone action. The
Oakwood Baron case at Columbus, 0.,
last season rather revolutionized affairs
and is doubtless well remembered by all
trotting horse followers.
Mr. Cohen got the fields away nicely
and the programme was run oft on sche
dule time and all hands reached town
by 6 o'clock. To-day's card commences
at 2 o'clock and some splendid fields are
nominated for each of the flyÂ« races. The
results are by no means oasy to mark
beforehand inasmuch as the keenest com
petition soems assured, judged by a cas
ual glance ov^r the list of entries which
Secretary Kelly has secured. Should the
horsemen respond at all liberally as to
entries for future events the meeting is
pure to be extended to July 23 and grand
sport obtain.
Everything considered a fair attendance
turned out. It Is a trifle chilly for any
phenomenal time achievements, yet the
track could hardly be bettered, and the
winners may yet have to go several
notches out of their classes to get the
money. Ladles are admitted free and a
goodly number wore present to watch the
sport. Summaries:

WHAT CONSTITUTES A MANP
Father Younan of the Paulist Com
munity Delivers an Interesting
Lecture.
"What Constitutes a Man" was the sub
ject of aji interesting and instructive
lecture by Father E. H. Younan last
evening at the Metropolitan Temple,
poverty, chastity and obedience were the
three essentials that the lecturer main
tained were the real characteristics of
true manhood.
A distinct and well defined parallel be
tween the civilzed man and the pagan
was drawn and the traits that ennoble
the one and degrade the other outlined
and exemplified.
As a conclusion the lecturer drew a
vivid picture of the manhood of to-day,
speaking of the virtue prompted by love
of country, of home, of parents and of
God as the sole incentive stimulating the
young soldier on the battlefield, for con
tending and fighting for victories that
might protect his home, country and re
ligion.
The lecture was under the immediate
auspices of the Cathedral Council No. 59
of the Yj M. 1., and was delivered before
an immense audience. It was preceded by
a well-arranged and Interesting pro
gramme of vocal selections and Instru
mental patrotic music.

mess and social circles of their own coun- i
try quite a number of the Japanese col- 1
ony of this city called continuously â¢
throughout the day. Most inquiries were j
for Takuma Dan. the most noteworthy
of the visitors. A hotel frequenter was i
leaning against the office counter for
some time, and whenever he heard the
name of Dan mentioned his face would
suddenly assume an expression which de- j
noted a heavy mental process within. !
The name was familiar to him and it al- i
ways went linked with a distant friend, i
And then he bethought himself of a joke.
The hotel clerk doing service that night
is the mildest and at times the most un
suspecting of men: so it was upon him j
that the lounger determined to make his j
little sally. With all Feriousness he asked '
the, clerk where Beersheba was. Wisdom i
mantled the latter's brow and after look- j
ing over the register he said that Beer- I
sheba did not come in with that party of j
Japanese. Just then a son of the land
of the setting sun walked across the
court and the clerk In a helpful way sug
gested that it might be Mr. Beersheba. }

EXPERT CURTIS
GROWS WEARY
Protracted Examination
Shows on Him.
OVER A WEEK UNDER FIRE
BALLROAD COMMISSIONERS IN
TERESTED LISTENERS.
Attorney General Fitzgerald Closely
Examining Into the Witness'
Qualifications as an
Expert.
Attorney General Fitzgerald devoted
two hours and a half yesterday examin
ing Engineer Curtis of the Southern Pa
cific Company as to his qualifica
tions as an expert, with a view to min
imizing his testimony given on hlB direct
examination.
The witness seemed unperturbed by the
hundred and one interrogations put to
'him, and calmly answered each inquiry
into his knowledge of matters pertaining
to railroads, past and present, drawing
on his unlimited fund of information on
the subject.
Very few spectators visit Commission
er Heacock's court room, as the testimony
is technical and usually uninteresting.
Railroad Commissioners La Rue and
Hinton are daily visitors, however, and
listen attentively to all that is said.
It is their purpose as soon as the present
proceedings are concluded to take up and
further develop matters brought out dur
ing the taking of testimony. A stipula
tion was entered into between Attorney
General Fitzgerald and Mr. Herrin, rep
resenting the parties interested and the
Railroad Commissioners, by which it was
agreed that all testimony taken may be
used at their hearing.
Mr. Curtis showed the first signs of be
ing fatigued and ruffled since the cross
questioning began, it was near the closa
of the day's examination and every one
had become wearied by listening to the
cost of rails and other necessaries, when
the Attorney General put the following
query to the witness:
"What would you say if Mr. Hood or
Senator Stanford and others had testi
fied that this identical work on the Cen
tral Pacific could have been done for 75
per cent less than what was charged
there â $SOO per mile?"
Mr. Herrin noted his objection to the
question on the regular grounds, and
further stated that no such testimony
was given.
Mr. Curtis then in a voice a little
sharper than usual said: "I should not
care who said that a thing was differ
ent than what my own judgment and ex
perience taught me, I would stand by the
fact, no matter how great a man said it
to the contrary." s
The matter passed off in a maze of
questions as to the number of water
tanks, depots and other articles used on
the Oregon Branch of the Central Pacillc
Railroad.
"You stated yesterday," said Judge
Fitzgerald, "that you were detailed to
look after tunnels 14 and 15 of the Central
Pacific Railroad; when were those tun
nels constructed."
"The original construction I think was
in the year ISC6 or 1867," said Curtis. "I
was assistant in the engineers depart
mentâassistant to the chief of the party,
Mr. Stevenson. He was an assistant en
gineer and 1 was subordinate to him. I
was learning the profession then, run
ning leveling instruments, handling the
chain and doing all sorts of such work?"
The witness thought the construction of
these tunnels was done by the Charles
Crocker Company.
Attorney General Fitzgerald then ques
tioned him as to matters pertaining to
the Oregon Branch of the Central Pa
cific. Besides being asked the number of
men employed In the road's construction,
their pay, etc., questions similar to these
wore propounded: "What did the signals
and signs on this line cost if there were
any?" "What is the nature and extent
and supply of this road?" How many
tanks' are there?"
To all of which the witness expressed
his willingness to enlighten his questioner
by producing memoranda taken at the
2 o'clock to-day.
Further testimony will be taken at
2:00 o'clock to-day.
SUNSET VALLEY
CELEBRATION
RESIDENTS WILL GIVE VENT
TO THEIR JOY.
City Officials and Others Are Invited
to Participate in the Jubilee
Next Monday.
There will be a hot time In the Sunset
Valley on next Monday night. This,
however, means that there will be a
warmth of welcome for those invited to
be present at the jubilee which Is In prep
aration to hall the coming prosperity nt
the setting sun district. The day of sloth
and indifference has been passed and one
of prosperity and go-a-headness has
taken its place. For all of this good for
tune the Sunset District Improvement
Club may be given the credit. Before the
formation of this club the Sunset Valley
was a waste of sand dunes with not
enough of vegetation to maintain a jack
rabbit or house room to shield a do
mestic mouse.
At the last meeting of the Improvement
club Edward EWald, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee, gave a brief outline o:
the many improvements done, as also
those In progress in the district.
Mr. Ewald's report stated that: The,
work of macadamizing Ninth avenuu
from H streot to the Almshouse tract had
been commenced; that the grading and
macadamizing of F street, from Eighth
to Tenth avenues, had been protested
against, but that the committee expected
the protesting property owners would
reconsider their action and have the por
tion as far as the west line of Nintn
avenue improved, in order that the rail
road company can lay its tracks on the
same for an electric line up Ninth avenue
to the Almshouse tract and City and
County Hospital.
The report also stated that there was
a possibility of the Byfield tract being
graded by the Sutro estate, with a view
of selling the same. This would put one
of the most beautiful residence sites In
San Francisco on the market.
The committee also submitted the pro
gramme for the celebration of the secur
ing of a water supply for Sunset Heights,
the conversion of the old steam line Into
a through electric line from the ferries
to the ocean, the completion of that por
tion of the main Intercepting sewer which
had been so long contended for by the
club and the residents of the district.
Having accomplished so much for the
people and with the view of celebrating
the achievements a grand entertain
ment will be given by the residents to
those who aided in accomplishing the
good work.
The club commissioned the following
gentlemen as committees to take charge
of the whole affair:

SIGNED A WORTHLESS CHECK.
L. A. Grade to Be Arrested on a War
rant for Believing a Debt by
Unlawful Means.
M. A. Owens, proprietor of a restaurant
at 7 Ninth street, yesterday swore to a
warrant for the arrest of L. A. Grade, for
roistering a worthless check on him. The
complaining witness states that Grade,
who was engaged in the wholesale candy
business at 538 Washington street about
the 12th of April last, was his friend.
Trusting him as such he loaned him three
hundred dollars which was to have been
paid back within a week, but the day of
payment dragged along and he became
Impatient. He asked Grade for the money
and the latter sat down and wrote him a
check for $320, dating it seven days
ahead and asking that ft not be presented
until the last day. The extra twenty,
he said, was for the trouble caused the
restaurant man.
On the 17th of this month Owens pre
sented the check at the First National
Bank and was told that there were no
funds to Grade's credit. He allowed the
matter to rest until a day or two ago when
he -heard that Grade contemplated going
into insolvency. He accordingly went to
court yesterday and swore out a warrant.
Grade is now in Merced staying on his
father's ranch, but it is said he will be
brought to this city to explain his con
duct. The police telegraphed the Sheriff
of that town to apprehend him.
ALL BLAME PLACED
ON MAJOR LONG
WORKINGMEN CHARGE HIM
WITH DOUBLE DEALING.
Hugh Craig and A. A. Watkins Ar<9
Also Criticized for Their Part
in the Uniform Controversy.
The committee from the Building
Trades Council, which, with the assist
ance of Secretary Rosenberg of the Labor
Council and Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald, has been investigating the manu
facture of soldiers' uniforms by Chinese
and endeavoring to fix the responsibility,
made a detailed report of its work at
last night's meeting of the council.
The report is substantially the same as
the matter which has been published
from day to day in The Call, and in
cludes all the correspondence between
Major Long and the authorities at Wash
ington. Major Long and Hugh Craig and
A. A. Watkins are severely arraigned and
charged with double dealing all through
the report. The part takon by Brigadier
General H. G. Otis Is referred to as fol
lows:
During the Investigation by the army Brig
adier General Harrison Gray Otis, of effete
consistency, again sharpened his fangs, rattled
his accouterrnents and made another venomous
strike at labor, when he declared that further
Investigation was unnecpsoary and only re
sulted In unpleasant newspaper notoriety.
The commissary department is then
charged with "inco; petency and willful
mismanagement" and as being directly
responsible for the present condition of
affairs. The whole case is summed up as
follows:
In conclusion your committee desires to
analyze the position of the various gentlemen
who have been instrumental in depriving com
petent and deserving white labor of a chance
to make a living;, and have thrown the benefits
to < hlnese labor:
Firstâ That Major Long, as quartermaster In
charge, has willfully deceived his superiors by
fending a dispatch misstating truth and fact,
claiming to have canceled contracts, when the
testimony of contractors utterly denies the
factâ disclaiming the knowledge of Chinese
labor when the snme has been openly per
formed throughout the Chinese quarter. That
he has proven incompetent by paying large
sums of money for the shoddiest cloth and
poorest workmanship to be had; that he has
maliciously permitted Nohle. chief clerk, and
Hansen. cutter In the Commissary Department,
to Insult and abuse applicants for work who
have for years performed this work for the
Secondâ The representative gentlemen. Hugh
Craig and A. A. Watklns, have used their in
fluence to corruptly Indorse the false stand
taken by Major Long, the latter representative
Bcr.il<rrori to receive In return thtrefor benefit
in shape of contracts. Thnt the attitude of
these gentlemen Is condemned by honeÃt mer
chants and business men and 1b only supported
by those who number with them as the recip
ients of Government favors.
Thirdâ We desire to confer Infinite prnlse upon
the actions of Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
In carrying on this fight In favor of the citi
zens of San Francisco â determined and true,
hp has. In the face of all the power and in
fluence at the command of the allied Govern
ment, corporation and commercial Interests
proven true to his office and to the people!
and through his efforts corruption has been
revealed and proven, and to htm. In our opin
ion, the working people of San Francisco We
eternal thanks and good wishes. Respectfully

How Millions Crushed
a Man.
PLACING THE BLAME
OF THE COLLISION
THE CAPTAINS ACCUSE EACH
OTHER.
Commander of the Eppinger Claims
That He and Hts Crew Were
Badly Treated.
The blame for the wreck of the schooner
Eppinger, which occurred on the 2d inst..
is in doubt, both captains of the vessels
in the collision claiming that they are
Innocent. Captain Goodall of the Columbia
has made a statement blaming Captain
J. F. Colstrup, and now the latter accuses
Goodall.
Captain Colstrup's statement of the
affair Is: "I was about forty-six miles
northwest of Point Reyes, in a heavy fog,
and was keeping a whistle blowing all the
time. I heard a whistle close at hand, and
suddenly tho ship loomed up close to me.
I was on the offshore tack, and had the
right of way. 1 put my helm hard to port,
as I saw no other way to avoid an acci
dent. Instead of going to starboard or
keeping her old course, she was put to
port, and bore down on me. We were
going about three or four knots an hour
and the steamer must have had good
headway, as she cut into the schooner
five or six feet. We of the crew saved
ourselves, three climbing upon the
steamer and then launching a boat for the
rest of us. While on board we were
treated well, but when we reached Port
land the captain told us we would have
to leave the vessel unless we would sign
statements before his attorneys. This we
refused to do, and I was obliged to pay
passage for myself and crew to this port.
I don't consider that this was very good
treatment for a shipwrecked crew."
A resolution was signed by a number
of passengers extending their sympathy
to Captain Colstrop and his crew. This
resolution concludes with the statement,
"As far as we could see, the captain and
crew of the schooner were not responsible
for the accident."
Must Have Bonds.
The Supreme Court has decided In favor
of the executor of the estate of John W.
Mitchell and against the Superior Court
of Stanislaus County. Mitchell was a
very wealthy man. his estate being ap
praised at something over a million dol
lars. Against it were claims aggregating
$178,000. By his will deceased bequeathed
$1f..000 to three persons, who petitioned for
partial distribution. The Superior Court
gave an order granting such distribution,
waiving bonds. From this order the ex
ecutor appealed, objecting to the whole
proceedings. The order of the lower court
was reversed by the higher court, which
held that as the time for the filing of
claims had not expired and the debts had
not been paid the court could not make
an order such as it did without the pro
tection of bonds.
Lawyer Boone Loses.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow yes
terday decided that a purported compromise
made by Lawyer John L. Boone of the
case of Nathaniel S. Keith was void, and
that the defendant must pay $1957 and
costs, the amount of the judgment. les3
1600 paid to Boone by the defendant on

I suffered with blackheads and pimples for
two or three years until it became chronic. I
tried everything imaginable, but it did me no
' good. Cuticura Soap cured me.
Feb. 20, 98. L. V. GILLIAM, Oak P. 0.,
I was troubled for eight years with pimples

Â«# â¢ ** liow to Prevent Mid Core Pimples," mailed fro*
surplus awaiting use for the payment of divi
dends, purchase of supplies and other necessi
ties for the business. While the surplus Is
waiting to be used it is loaned uj">n col
laterals." You inquire whether the making of
such loans constitutes the lender a banker
within the meaning of the second section ol the
act of June 13, ISfiS; and. If so. "what is to be
regarded as the amount of capital used, as, for
example, in a case where the capital of the
company is JIO.WKOOO, while the average amount
loaned does not exceed H, OOO, WOT"
In the opinion of this office the language of
that section, which provides "that every per
son, firm or company â¢ â¢ â¢ having a place
of business â¢ â¢ â¢ where money Is advanced
or loaned on stocks, bonds, bullion, bills ot ex
change or promissory notes, â¢ â¢ â¢ shall be a
banker under this act," clearly subjects the
person, firm or company to whom you refer to
special tax as banker.
The amount of special tax to be paid is re
quired to be estimated upon the amount of
capital used in the business. The fact that
any manufacturing company or firm makes use
of its surplus (as in the case whlrh yon state)
in doing a banking business does not Involve it
in special tax liability estimated upon the en
tire amount of capital employed by it in its
manufacturing business.
It is held, therefore, that it is not this
amount, but simply the amount of surplus on
hand for the purpose of making loans, that is
to be taken as a basis for estimating the
amount of special tux.
It is not the average amount loaned within
the year, but the entire amount of surplus on
hand out of which loans may be made.
Return should be made to the Collector of the
district for the computation of the annual tax
on the basis of this surplus (or capital) "for
the preceding fiscal year," as provided for by
the statute. Respectfully yours.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
WASHINGTON, June 25, 1898.
Sir: I reply aa fallows to the series of ques
tions submitted by W. R. Grace & Co. of New
York, in their letter to you dated the 23d lnst.,
which you have referred to me:
1. For the Incidental bank.ng business which i
they state they do for the convenience of their
various correspondents throughout South Amer
ica they are required to pay special tax as
bankers under section 2 of the act of June 13,
USS. Hut, In estimating the amount of this i
special tax, the entire capital of their house,
Which, they say, Is $3,000,000, "employed In the I
steamship and merchandise business," Is not to
be taken as the basis of this estimate, but only '
those funds In their hands from the proceeds
of merchandise sold, which they hold or make
use of for the purpose of doing any of the
business of banking as defined in that section.
If the funds thus held and used have not ex
ceeded $25,000 in the preceding fiscal yeur the
amount of their special tax Is $50.
2. On a charter party the tax Is required by
the act to be paid on the original charter party |
only and the stamp affixed thereto for the en- I
tire tax. Stamps are not required by the law j
on copies of the charter party.
3. In the case of a shipping receipt issued,
which, they say, is afterward presented at the
office and a bill of lading Issued in exchange i
therefor, the tax of 10c Is required to be paid
both on the shipping receipt and on the bill
of lading, and the requisite staijip must be
affixed to each. As to bills of lading or re
ceipts for merchandise to be exported. It Is held
that no stamp tax is required to be paid on
copies of such bills of lading. The bills of I
lading* on which and on "each duplicate" of
which tax is required to be paid are those only
which are referred to in the eighth clause of
schedule A as requiring "a stamp of the value
of 1 âOk"
4. As brokers they are required to pay a tax j
of 10c only on each contract of sale, and noth- I
Ing on contract of purchase. They can obtain I
from the Collector of the Second District of !
New York, Charles H. Treat. Nassau and j
Spruce streets, New York, the stamps required
by them. Respectfully yours,
N. R. SCOTT. Commissioner.

the following circulars, explanatory of
certain provisions of th* act of interest
to brokers and merchants:
Referring to previous orders regarding the
stamping of proprietary articles mentioned in
schedule B, act of June 13. 1898, I now inclose
circular No. US, one copy only of which has
been received by this office, and from which
you will perceive that the customs authorities
are relieved from all responsibility in the mat
ter, and that the only stamp required to be
affixed to articles before delivery' from custody
are those existing prior to June 13, 1898, such
as taxes for cigars, snuff, tobacco and play
ing cards. Consequently all previous instruc
ticr.s respecting articles covered by Schedule
B are revoked.
Here follows the important part of the
circular referred to:
! In order that the practice at the several ports
shall be uniform, officers of the customs are
instructed that with the advice of the pro
1 visional Commissioner of Internal Revenue it
; is held that Inasmuch as section 24 of the war
' revenue law provides that every' person, except
j as otherwise provided for. who offers or exposes
! for sale any article or thing provided for in
i said Schedule B. whether the article was of-
I ferred or exposed as of foreign manufacture oi
Imported or of domestic manufacture shall be
! deemed a manufacturer thereof: and as the
! penalties prescribed In the said law are incu>
i red by any manufacturer who shall sell, send
out, remove or deliver any article or commod
ity before the tax thereon shall have been
fully paid by affixing thereon the proper stamy
thf-rpfur Importers are made amenable as man
i ufacturers to the requirements and penalties of
! the law.
| The practice of designating certain packages
for examination by the appraisers under the
I provisions of section 2901, Revised Statutes, and
of delivering the remainder of the Importation
directly to the Importer nfter the duties have
been paid or secured to be paid will be con
tinued by chief officers of customs without re
gard to the stamping of the contents undpr
' the war revenue law, the enforcement of the
' latter being distinct from the collection of
| customs dups and devolving upon the officers
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The ex
ceptions to this rule are found in the proviso
at section 24, which is as follows: "Provided
further that Internal revenue stamps required
by existing law on 'mported merchandise shall
be affixed thereto and canceled at the expense
of the owner or importer before the withdrawal
of such merchandise for consumption, and the
Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to
make such rules nnd regulations aF may be
necessary for the affixing and canceling of such
stamps not inconsistent herewith."
The stamps which, under the law existing
: prior to June 13. IS9R, were affixed under cus
| toms supervision, such as the taxes upon ci
gars, snuff and tobacco, will accordingly con
tinue to be affixed and canceled under the
present law before the withdrawal of the mer
chandise for consumption.
Deputy Collector Farley addressed the
following to Thomas H. Craig, entries and
clearance clerk:
All shipper's manifests must show the
names of the actual shipper of goods exported.
Manifests showing as shippers the names of
employes of Individual firms or corporations
known to be engaged in the exporting business
will not be accepted. In the case of brokers
or employes of firms or corporations who make
In their own names entries for benefit of draw
back, withdrawals for export, or entries for
wnr'-house and immediate exportation, suf*rÂ»
brokers or employes are considered to be the
actual shippers of the merchandise covered by
said entries, and withdrawals and shippers'
manifests may be accepted accordingly.
Wines for Peru.
Senator Perkins has sent to Hugh Craig
of the Chamber of Commerce a letter
I received by nim from Hon. John A. Kas
son. relati\'e to reciprocity with Peru, in
which Mr. Kasson says:
Peru wants a 20 per cent reduction of our
duties on sugar, brandies and wines, the prod
ucts of Peru, and offers certain concessions
j In return on products of the United States. In
1897 we Imported from Peru only three dozen
I bottles of wine, valued at $15; of brandies,
I none. T'nder these circumstances, It Is pre-
I sumed that the brandies and wines of Peru
did not suit the American taste or trade, and
that a concession in the duty might be safely
made without harm to our native product.
| California wines are marketed down the coast
and might perhaps enter Peru. Be pleased, ns
representative of the California Interests, to
prlve me the benefit of your views on the sub
| ject. and oblige.
The lftter has been referred to several
of the local wine men for them to dis
cuss.

REMAINS OF
A NAVAL HERO
Captain Gridley's Ashes
Arrive Here.
THE RIO DE JANEIRO IN PORT
MORE TROUBLE ON THE AMER
ICAN SHIP MAY FLINT.
A Ridiculous Story About the United
States Gunboat Monocacy De
nied by the North China
Daily Mall.
The Pacific Mall Company's steamer
City of Rio de Janeiro arrived from
Hongkong via Yokohama and Honolulu
yesterday morning. She was behind
time, having been delayed by head winds.
She brought up twenty-four cabin and
nineteen European steerage passengers,
besides seventeen Japanese and a hun
dred and sixty-nine Chinese passengers.
While the steamer was in Hongkong
there was a ridiculous story current
about the United States steamship Mon
ocacy. It was to the effect that on Dec
oration day a party was given aboard
the gunboat by the officers and that a
Spanish flag was spread on the gangway
for the guests to walk over. The silly
yarn was denied by the North China Daily
News.
The notorious American ship May Flint
was in trouble again in Yokohama while
the' Rio was there. As soon as the vessel
reaches port the sailors complain about
ill treatment from one or the other of the
officers. On this occasion Peter Bonavie,
an A. 8., was arrested at the instance of
Henry Johnson, the boatswain, for dis
playing a revolver aboard the ship. From
the evidence it appears that the captain
and boatswain were beating the sailors
and he drew the gun in self-defense. The
United States Consul took the pistol and
gave it to tho captain for safe keeping
and ordered Bonavie to be put aboard the
ship again. If he goes to sea in the May
Flint on her return voyage thefe are sure
to be lively times for him on the trip.
The Rio de Janeiro left Honolulu on
June 29, shortly after the Brutus and
Monterey. Outside she found both ves
sels at anchor, as one of the collier's jour
nals had got hot and it had to be cooled
before she could proceed.
The ashes of Captain C. "V. Gridley,
late of the cruiser Olympia, were brought
over on the Rio. It will be remembered
that after the battle of Manila he was
invalided home and died aboard the
steamer Coptic at Kobe. Japan. From
there his remains were taken to Yoko
hama and cremated. On the Rio a state
room was set apart for the casket. As
the vessel did not dock until late the
Navy Pay Office was unable to take pos
session of the remains. To-day they will
be turned over to it and will at once be
forwarded to the widow. As the steamer
entered port and steamed up to her dock
all her flags were set at half mast out of
respect to the illustrious dead.
Among the Rio's passengers were "W.
Donovan, gunner's' mate of the Monterey,
and F. Stevens, who have been sent home
as incapacitated by old age. Seven of the
volunteers also came back from Honolulu
on the sick list. They are: H. C. How
ard, B. F. Fannon, Paul A. Miller, W. F.
Malone, C. A. Thaler, Charles Butler and
Leonard Stafford. The latter was a ser
geant of Company E, Nebraska Volun
teers, and has rheumatism.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
Coptic sailed for the Orient yesterday
with quite a number of passengers and a
very large cargo. Among those who
went away on her were the wife of Lieu
tenant Parmenter, now with his ship
at Manila, and Miss Irwin, a relative of
Rear Admiral Irwin, retired. The ladies
will remain at Hongkong until it is safe
for them to go to Manila.
While moving from under the coal
bunkers at Beale street yesterday the
ship Lucille parted her hawser and drift
ed over to Main-street wharf. She very
nearly crushed the schooners Katie S
and Mabel and Edith. There was some
lively skirmishing while the three ves
sels were mixed up in the slip.
The steamer Czarina is back from
Puget Sound, where she was engaged for
a time in the Klondike trade, and will
go back on the Coos Bay run. On April
19, last, while discharging cargo at the
wharf in Juneau, the steamer Dirigo ran
into the Czarina and knocked a four
foot hole in her. To save his vessel from
sinking Captain Seaman had to run the
Czarina on the mud flats. Temporary
repairs were made and ther?\ on April
22, Captain Jansen. the pilot, ran her on
a rock in Wrangel Narrows. It took two
months' hard work to repair her at Seat
tle and to make her as good as ever
eighteen new plates had be put in her
bottom and three others on her starboard
side aft.
The Harbor Commissioners discussed
the free market question yesterday. It
was practically decided to set aside Pa
einc-street wharf for the purpose, but
nothing definite will be done until a con
ference has been held with the Produc
ers' Association next Wednesday. D.
MoPartland was granted the news stand
privileges In all the waiting rooms of the
new ferry depot. The ticket offices of
the Southern Pacific will move Into the
new depot on Sunday, and the work of
removing the old wooden shanties will
beerin nt once.
The luxuriantly furnished river steamer
Mary Ellen Galvln is to have her trial
trip next Sunday. Wednesday the Cali
fornia dry dock people attempted to put
her on the ways, but as the preparations
were all made for a keel instead of a
fiat bottomed boat the Galvin nearly
came to grief. The vessel was put back
Into the water, and then the dock peo
ple refused to handle her unless the own
ers would be responsible for any damago
that might be done to the hull. "The Gal
vln will be fixed up without docking.
FLUSHING THE SEWERS.
Olympic Salt Water Company Will
Be Kept to Its Franchise.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday to consider the
matter of flushing the sewers during the
summer months. The Spring Valley
Water Company has a contract with the
city tt> do that work at a cost of Jo a
hydrant, but it was feared that owing to
the dry winter the water supply for living
purposes would be reduced by the flushing
process.
The Olympic. Salt "Water Company,
through its representatives, reported that
it would take the flushing contract on the
same terms as those granted the Spring
Valley Water Company.
Dr. Williamson spoke in, favor of the
proposition of flushing with salt water,
as he believed salt water a far better
purifier than fresh water.
It was decided to defer action on the
matter until the Street nnd Finance Com
mittees could meet in joint session.
After the meeting adjourned Clerk Rus
sell looked over the terms of the franchise
granted the Olympic Salt Water Com
pany. For the use of the streets to run
their mains the company stipulated to
furnish the city, free of cost, five times a
year such water as might be needed
either by the Street or Fire departments.
Tt is now probable that the Olympic
Salt Water Company will be called upon
to live up to the terms of the franchise
and furnish the water necessary for flush
ing purposes free of charge.

â¢ -ctai* â¢Â» benefit of others I desire
-i?Jjy to say that I am 52 years
W old; have been In the
mines for 23 years, where I contracted my dis-
ease. I have been doctoring for about 8 years
and have been to different hot springs without
much benefit. My disease Is rheumatism and
neuralgia, liver and stomach troubles and spinal
disease. Was almost paralyzed, and my. blood
was poisoned. I contracted these diseases by
working in lead ores and in foul air in the
mines. I received your Electric Belt and Spinal
Appliance about 5 months ago, and from the
great benefit I have already received I think I
will soon be A WELL MAN. I was then suffer-
ing with pains day and ntght, with swelling of
the Joints and poor circulation of the blood; but
I am now ever so much benefited by using your
Belt and Appliance. I am, yours respectfully,
CHRIS JOHNSON.
