CAMP OF THE UNITED
STATES MARINES, OUTER HAR
BOR OF GUANTANAMO, Monday,
June 13 (noon), by the Associated
Press dispatch boat Wanda, via
Kingston, Jamaica, June 14.â After
two nights of hard fighting the
American flag still floats over Cuban
soil on the encampment of the ma L
rine battalion and our boys say they
will keep it there until the belated
troops arrive, if it takes until winter.
Thus far the marines have
had the best of the fighting,
but the situation is grave
and theyareexhausted from
repelling almost incessant
attacks. They have little
chance to rest or sleep and
the timeof the arrival of the
relieving troops is uncertain.
Were it not for the guns of
the fleet the gallant little
band would be annihilated
by the Spanish troops in
overpowering numbers from
Santiago de Cuba. As it is
they orobably can hold their
position, but they cannot
move forward until re-en-
forced by troops.
What first, with the white tents
on a bold eminence against the
tropic background, looked like a
holiday camp i 9 now grim reality.
The tents have been struck and
rolled into breastworks, supple
mented by trenches around the
crest of the hilL The spot is lam
entably exposed, on ground,
while surrounding it on all sides
is heavy brush. The least move
ment in camp is the signal for
instant target practice upon the
part of the Spanish sharpshoot
ers, whose rifles carry much fur*
ther than ours, though their own
ers rarely hit anything they aim
at.
It is impossible to accurately
estimate the Spanish attacking
force, but it is numerous enough.
About two-thirds of this force
surrounds the camp nightly,
while the deadly ring and spat
ting of the Mausers make things
quite lively, for the Spaniards are
daring enough to crawl up and
take a pop at the marines from
the bushes about thirty yards
from the camp. At night the be
siegers fight like Indians, and
our old Apache fighters would
feel in their element. Every yard
of chaparral is an ambuscade, and
picket duty is flipping coins with
death.
After the first attack on Satur
day night Colonel Huntinefton
decided that another attempt

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15, 1898.
FELL FIGHTING FOR THE FLAG.
CAMP OF THE MARINES, Guantanaroo, June 13.â Two
Americans were Killed and four wounded or injured in a second
attacK by Spaniards last nigt)t. The dead are:
SERGEANT MAJOR HENRY GOODE, of the marines, shot
through; the rigrjt breast.
PRIVATE TAUMAN, wounded and fell off the cliff and was

camp.
In the trenches the main
partofthe battalion lastnight
waited for the attack that
the Colonel was certain
would come. It arrived in a
short time after dark, and
from that time until day
break the firing was inces
sant and at times very
heavy. On the American
side two men were killed
and four wounded.
The first attack of the Span
iards was made at 8 o'clock, and
the last shot was fired by them at
about 3 o'clock in the morning.
During the night the Spanish at-
tacked the camp of the marines
on the shore, and the Marble
head, believing 1 the Americans
had been driven out, threw out
several shells into the place. The
attack, however, was repulsed by
the small detachment of marines
in camp without trouble. The
shells of the Marblehead struck
among the marines.
The fight was the First of
the war in which the Cubans
co-operated with the Ameri
can Forces, and their co-op
eration was not a glittering
success. At one time during
the aFternoon whenever the
marines were firing on a
small detachment oF Span
iards that made their ap
pearance a short distance
From the camp the Cubans
began Firing without orders
and sent a volley right
amongthe Americans. There
were several narrow es
capes, but no one was in
jured.
Lieutenant Neville of Com
pany D was sent out on scout
duty, and, as on the day previous,
he attacked a small stone fort. A
hot fight folio-wed", andTlie Span
iards were driven off with loss.
It was during this fight that Wal
lace and Tauman fell over the
cliff.
FiFteen dead Spaniards,
including, one lieutenant
were Found in the Fort.
During the attack several
shots struck the ships in the har
bor, penetrating the pilot-house
of the Associated Press dispatch
boat Dandy. No one was in
jured on board of her, however.
The Dolphin this morning lo
cated the Spanish water station
on the ocean side of the harbor
entrance, which supplied the
water for the attacking force.
The well was situated in a block
house windmill, having a small
garrison. It was shelled at 2000
yards.
The station was wrecked, and
canister followed the retreating
Spaniards up the steep ravine. ;
! Each shell disclosed the spot ;
! where it alighted by raising a
cloud of dust. They were all well
1 placed.
The arrival of the fleet this af
ternoon to complete the bom
bardment of the town and its de
fenses is expected.

Four thousand men went yesterday
to the wars. At break of day the re
veille woke Camp Merritt to speed the
parting brave. Tents fell to the rising
of the sun, men gathered early to the
last mess, camps broke, the bugle call
ed, the flag floated, the. band played
and the men of the Eighteenth and
Twenty-third Regulars, the First Regi
ment of Colorado Volunteers, the Tenth
Pennsylvania, the First Nebraska and
the Utah Light Artillery shook the
sand of the Richmond district lightly
from their heels and set their faces to
the water front.
They went by different ways to dif
ferent ships, and scattered the march
over the day. A detachment of the
Utnhs led to the Pacific Mail dock,
where the Colon and China were ly
ing, followed by the two battalions of
Regulars, the Colorado and the Utah
Light Artillery. They marched along
First avenue to Point Lobos road, down
Post to Stockton, down Market to
Third and across Brannan to the dock,
dropping B of the Utahs at Market and
Third to make Its way down Market
and over East to the Zealandia at the

Broadway dork.
The city gathered to a civil leave-tak
ing of these men. The streets were
crowded' for th-'ir passing, the docks
were crowded for th.-ir waiting. Flagg
waved for them, cheers rang, godspeeds
were given and a few tÂ«;irs shed. But
the flags ajid the cheers were for the
cause, the godspeeds were for the cour
age, the tears were tears of sentiment.
No woman cast herself out of the crowd
yesterday to hold her first horn, or her
lastâ and who shall say which Is the
dearer?â to her breast; no man seized
the hand of his son and gripped It hard
in that silence which between men
means more than words; no wife clung
â weeping to her husband; no father
took tender leave of his children: no
sweet girl saw love's young dream go
far from her to the wars. There were
no last words, no last looks, no sad,
courage, none of the passion and pain,
of parting. These were our stranger
brothers; we have already taken leave
of our own.
That vivid personal interest In the
patriot -which "shook" California to her
soul on the 23d of May, sobbed beneath
her cheers, wept behind her smiles,
made tragedy of her pride and mourn
ing of her decorations â did not wake to
the 14th of June. Such days must wait
on wars. They do not come twice In
the calendar of one generation.
Native sons and brothers who have
enlisted with the Eighteenth and Twen
ty-third carried the larger crowd to the
Pacific Mail dock, where it was merci
lessly barred out by official order and
lingered despondent by the grates. The
troops were aboard the China and Colon
as early as nine o'clock, and their am
munition and stores were not more
than an hour behind them, but the or

on the way, and the men, served with
the last meal for the day, sat them,

blue and gold. Indian helmets and
white gloves. The men stripped off their

Insurgents Repulsed With Loss
in an Attempt to Enter
Matanzas Province.

HAVANA, June 14.â The American
fleet last night approached the channel
at Santiago when a battery fired five
Bhots, which one of the ships returned
with two shots, when the Americans
withdrew. Again at daybi ak to-day
two cruisers of the fleet opened fire on
the battery, when the other ships joined
in, firing fifty or sixty shots. Morro
and Socapa batteries returned the fire
for some time, when the ships with
drew. At Socapa battery three soldiers
were slightly wounded.
After burning several houses and pil
laging stores in the town of Comay
agua, the Insurgents under the com
mand of Robert Bermudez and Aguila
attempted to enter Matanzas province,
but ran into a column of Spanish sol
diers, who opened fire on the rebel
forces. In the light which followed the
insurgents lost a captain and a lieuten
ant, who were killed, several were
wounded and ammunition and horses
were lost. The rebels made a hasty re
treat, but were again attacked by Span
ish soldier under the command of Col
onel Mijares, who soon defeated them,
killing ten and seizing five rifles, 2000
cartridges, horses, provisions and
clothing.
From Cienfuegos yesterday what was
supposed to be a merchantman was
sighted about ten miles from shore.
The Spanish gunboat Diego Valesquez

HOBSON'S MEN
Bravery Substantially
Recognized.
ACTION OF SECRETARY LONG
PROMOTION IS ANNOUNCED IN
EACH CASE.
Hobson Will Be Consulted as to His
Desires and Every Effort
Made to Secure His
Release.
Special Dlspatrh to Tha Call.
NEW YORK, June 14.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Secretary Long to-day formally and
substantially recognized the gallantry
of those who, under command of As
sistant Naval Constructor Hobson,
sunk the collier Merrimac in the mouth
of the harbor at Santiago. No action
has yet been taken with reference to
the promotion of Hobson himself, for
the reason that the department has not
yet had an oportunity of communicat
ing with him to learn what he desires.
Every effort is being made by the de
partment to procure his exchange and
that of the men with him in the San
tiago prison, but nothing definite as a
result of the negotiations has yet oc
curred- As for the men, two of them
were promoted to the warrant rank,
two more to be chief machinists ajid
three appointed chief boatswains'
mates.
The men promoted to the warrant
rank are: D. Montague, chief master
at-arms, who is appointed boatswain;
George C. Carrette, gunner's mate of
the third class, who is made gunner;
G. E. Phillips, machinist of the first
class, was named as chief machinist;
and to F. Kelley, a mate's tender was
given of the same rank.
Cockswain R. Clausen, Cockswain O.
D. Egan and Cockswain J. E. Murphy
were each appointed chief boatswain's
matt*. As chief master-at-arms Monta
gue drew pay at $65 a month. As boat
swain, to which he has been promoted,
be will receive $1300 a year, this includ
ing longevity pay, which his four years'
service in the navy will insure.
Carrette drew $30 a month as gun
ner's mate, third class, and he will also
receive $1300 a year. In addition, each
of the officers will be entitled to room
in the forward steerage and be retired
the same as commissioned officers.
Phillips, as machinist, will be pro
moted from $55 to $75 a month, and
Kelly, as water-tender, from $40 to $70
a month. Clausen, Dignan and Murphy,
cockswains, instead of receiving $30 a
month, will in future receive $50 a
month. Besides these rewards, it is
proposed to give each man $100 and a
medal of honor, to be prepared under
the direction of the department.

LOSS OF THE INSURGENTS.
Two Officers and Two Privates Killed
and Nine Wounded.
HAVANA, June 13.â The United
States cruiser Montgomery at about 4
o'clock this afternoon approached
nearer than is usually the case to the
Santa Clara battery and fired three
shots at Punta Grava. The first shot
was fired at 8000 metres and the others
were fired at 9000 metres. The Mont
gomery then resumed her place in the
blockading line. Her projectiles fell
very near the battery. A Spanish bat
tery east of Morro Castle fired one shot
at another American warship.
The advices from Mantanzas Just re
ceived say that on Saturday last 200
insurgents, commanded by Bermudez
and Aguila made an attempt to enter
Comayagua, and succeeded in burn
ing some houses, but the insurgents
were repulsed with loss, including one
captain, Morrison, one lieutenant and
| two privates killed and a sergeant,
] corporal and nine privates wounded.
The Spanish had nineteen men wound
ed. The same force of insurgents was
afterward encountered on Saturday
and Sunday last, and the Spaniards
j claim they dispersed them with a loss
jof twelve killed. The insurgents are
j also reported to have carried away
j many of thtir wounded and to have
i abandoned a quantity of property
I which they looted at Comayagua.
The local guerrilla force of Las Jucas,
i province of Santa Clara, it is officially
j announced, has been engaged with and
dispersed an insurgent force, which left
i eight men killed on the field.

WASHINGTON, June 14.â The

the following bulletin:
"MOLE ST. NICHOLAS, June

statute miles of observation of
the harbor of Santiago de Cuba.
He reports that the Spanish fleet
is all there. The Spanish at
tacked vigorously the camp at

marines were killed and their
bodies mutilated. Surgeon Gibbs
was killed. SAMPSON."
WASHINGTON, June 14.â The last
| lingering doubt that may have existed
; as to the presence of Cervera's fleet in
its entirety in Santiago harbor was re
! moved when Admiral Sampson's dis
> patch reached the Navy Department
j last night. Up to that time informa
. tion as to the number and character of
i the vessels lying in the harbor, shielded
! from observation by the hills, had been
' obtained through Cuban sources, sup-
I plemented by such glimpses as could
j be obtained by the naval officers from
the outside entrance. Now, however,
according to Lieutenant Blue, the ships
have been actually seen by an Ameri
can officer, counted aod inspected from
points of vantage afforded by the big
hills surrounding the harbor.
The officials here are full of praise for
Lieutenant Blue's achievement. He
has been long known in the navy as
an enterprising and daring young offi
cer, but it required a good deal of sus
tained courage for him to go ashore In
a hostile country and alone make this
peconnaissaoce. He was, in the eye of
! military law, nothing more or less than
â  a spy, and had he been captured by
j the Spaniards he would have been tried
by a drumhead court-martial and ex
ecuted.

HAVANA, June 14.â Flying a flag of truce an American gunboat
was sighted this afternoon, and the Spanish gunboat Flecha was sent
out with Lieutenant-Colonel Sebastian Ramos and Lieutenant Jose Rol
den on board. When the Flecha returned two hours later she had on
board Captain Ludlo-w of the American monitor Terror, who had been
delegated by Admiral Sampson to negotiate an exchange of Assistant
Naval Constructor Ho-bson and his six companions belonging to the
Merrimae, who are held in Morro at Santiago.
Captain-General Blanco was informed by Lieutena.nt-Colonel Ramos
of the nature of Captain Ludlow's mission, but he sent back word to
the American that he had no instructions from his Government re
garding the case and could not treat with him. Captain Ludlow re
turned on the Flecha to the American gunboat, which immediately
left port.
BRYAN ON
THE ISSUES
OF THE WAR
His First Public Declaration
Is Made at the Omaha
Exposition.
Urges That the Conflict Is for Hu
manity, Not for Possession of
Territory.
OMAHA, June 14. â The Nebraska
building at the exposition was dedi
cated to-day with appropriate cere
mony amid the plaudits of thousands
of the State's citizens. Governor Hol
comb and staff took part in the exer
cises, along â with many of the State's
most distinguished residents. The
speakers of the day were Hon. C. J.
Smith*. Hon. W. P. Gurley and Hon.
William J. Bryan.
Mr. Bryan's oration was notable for
his first public declaration or the war
issue. He took high ground on the
question, urging that the war is for hu
manity and not for the extension of
United States territory. In concluding
he said the manifest destiny of this na
tion is not to acquire new realms to
govern, but to carry out the funda
mental principles of democracy, to the
end that equality among citizens may
be secured.
After discussing the resources of Ne
braska, Mr. Bryan made the following
reference to the war and its results:
'"War is harsh; it is attended by
hardship and suffering; it means a vast
expenditure of men and money. We
may well pray for the toming of the
time, promised in the holy writ, when
the spears shajl be beaten into prun
ing hooks and the swords into plow
shares, but universal peace cannot
come until justice is enthroned through
out the worid. Jehovah deals with na
tions as he deals with men. and for
both decrees that the wages of sin is
death. Until the right has .triumphed
in every land and love reigns in every
heart, governments must, as a last re
sort, appeal to force. As long as the
oppressor is deaf to the voice of rea
son, so long must the citizen accustom
his shoulder to the musket and his hand
to the saber.
"Our nation exhausted diplomacy in
its efforts to secure a peaceable solu
tion of the Cuban question, and only
took up arms when it was compelled to
choose between war and servile ac
quiescence to* cruelties which would
have been a disgrace to barbarism.
History will vindicate the position ta
ken by the United States in the war
with Spain. In Baying this I assume
that the principles which were in
voked in the inauguration of the war
would be served in its prosecution and
conclusion. If a contest undertaken
for the sake of humanity degenerates
into a war of conquest we shall find it
difficult to deny the charge of having
added hypocrisy to greed. Is our na
tional character so weak that we can
not withstand the temptation to ap
propriate the first piece of land that
comes within our reach?
"To inflfcit upon the enemy all possi
ble harm is legitimate warfare, but
shall we contemplate a scheme for the
colonization of the Orient merely be
cause our fleet won a remarkable vic
tory in the harbor of Manila? Our
guns destroyed the Spanish fleet, but
ran they destroy that self-evident truth
that governments derive their just
powers, not from superior force, but
from the' consent of the governed?
"Shall we abandon a just -resistance
to European encroachment upon the
western hemisphere in order to mingle
in the controversies of Europe and
Asia?
"Nebraska, ;' standing midway be
tween the oceans, will contribute her
full share toward the protection of our
coast; her sons will support the flag: at
home and abroad, wherever the honor
and the interests of the nation may re
quire. Nebraska will hold up the hands
of the Government % while the battle
rages, and when â¢ the war clouds roll
away her voice will be heard pleading
for the â  maintenance :of -; those ' ideas
which Inspired - the . founders of our

consequence was that a detachment
turned up at the place arranged for a
duel to-day, every one eager to chal
lenge M. Gerault Richard. Paris for a
brief space seemed to have returned to
the d'Artagnan period. Swords were
crossed on the open highway, Gerault
Richard, being second, then principal
and coming within an ace of taking an
active part in a third encounter in the
same spot. The place of the meeting
was at Neuilly, just outside of Paris on
the right bank of the Seine, and just op
posite the Velodrome. Shortlyafter 10:30
o'clock a number of landaus arrived
there. The first contained Count Cas
tellane, with his seconds, and Comtes de
Dion and Elva; the second M. Henri
Turot and M. Gerault Richard and M.
Vivian! as seconds of M. Turot, and M.
Andre le Febre as second of M. Gerault
Richard, and the third containing M.
Charles Bernard, Gerault Richard's ad
versary, and his seconds, M. Chiche
and M. Papilland.
But this was not all. Other carriages
followed in a long procession. Two
members of the St. George's Fencing
Club, M. Louis de Heredia and M.
Bruneau de Labori. were there, deter
mined in insult Gerault Richard and
compel him to accept a meeting on ac
count of an article in the firebrand
journal of which he is editor-in-chief.
There were journalists innumerable,
fencing connoisseurs by scores, friends
of the principals, a..d seconds, doctors,
journalists, altogether quite as pretty a
battle as could have been got up.
Among those present was Ciperanl,
the well-known revolutionist. He is
still suffering from wounds received in
Thessaly, and when he got out of his
carriage and hobbled to the place of
meeting on a pair of crutches, he gave
a sinister touch to the Picture that was
quite in keeping. At 10:30 Comte de
Dion, director of the first encounter.
gave the signal for s\#ords to be
crossed. Castellane was in front of
his adversary, who was much taller
and heavier. Both were excellent fenc-
ers, both courageous, both reckless, and
the onslaught was very savage. Cas
tellane gave way little at the begin
ning, but before the first round was
over he reached Turot's right hand.
As the wound was not serious he re
fused to let the duel finish and the doc
tors did not object. The second attack
was without incident, .but in the third
Castellane began to press his adver
sary more and more. Finally he gave
a savage lunge, which went home, the
sword transfixing Turot's right fore
arm. Blood flowed abundantly and
the muscles stiffened immediately, so
that it was impossible for the wounded
man to hold a sword, and the doctors
insisted that the duel stop.
Hardly had the first combatants laid
down their weapons when M. Bernard
and M. Gerault Richard took their
places. Indeed, they were so quick

Details of the Incident Attending
the Landing of Supplies for the

ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL
DISPATCH BOAT, off Guantanamo,
Cuba, June 11, via Port Antonio,
Jamaica, Tuesday, June 14. â The Span
ish cavalry which rashly made its ap
pearance near Juan Gonzales last "Wed
nesday, while the American ships were
reconnoitering to land supplies for the
insurgents, learned a brief but eft -cttr j
lesson. A well directed shell exploded
in their ranks and killed several of
them. The supplies consisted of 400
rifles, five tons of provisions and 60,000
rounds of ammunition. The ammuni
tion was part of the cargo of the first
ill-fated expedition of the Gussie when
an attempt to land was repulsed by the
Spaniards.
The converted yachts Vixen and Su
wanee arrived off Juan Gonzales, a vil
lage about eight miles from Santiago,
it having been arranged that the insur
gents under General Ceberaco should
receive supplies there. Small boats
sent in to select a landing plaoe report
ed that the surf was too high to make
the operation safe, and so a change of
plans was made. While the gunboats
lay to, near the shore, a courier from
the Cubans appeared and ran down the
beach waving his arms. When with
in hailing distance, he shouted:
"Spaniards coming, Spaniards com
ing," and disappeared in the brush.
Three minutes later the men in the
ships saw a detachment of Spanish
cavalry appear over the hill and ad
vance rapidly toward the beach. The
about it that Comte de Dion had to in
tervene as official as the account of the
first encounter had not yet been drawn
up and signed by M. Gerault Richard
as sacond.
Tms encounter was not as sensational
as the first. The adversaries were more
wary and eight rounds were fought be
fore a wound was given on either side.
At last during an animated bit of fenc
ing Bernard's sword touched Gerault
Richard in the forehead and the flow
of blood obstructed his sight. This duel
was also stopped, much to the express
ed disgust of the two opponents. While
they were dressing, M. Bruneau de La
bori, one of the offended members of
the St. George's Fencing Club came up
to Gerault Richard and made an insult-
Ing remark. M de Jean, business man
ager of the Petit Republiqiie, here in
terposed with the remark that such
conduct was inhuman. Upon this M.
Labori turned on his heel, saying:
"Gerault Richard, you are a rascal."
You may imagine that there was
hubbub. However, no further encoun
ter took place there and then, but Ge
rault Richard Is to send his second to
Bruneau de Lab,ori to-morrow. The
procession then returned to Paris.

Vixen and Suwanee drew off about 309
yards from shore and the former sent
a shell singing landward from her star
i board gun. It seemed to burst right in
the faces of the astonished Spaniards,
who galloped away in every direction.
Aserradero, a village lying about
j twenty-one miles west of Santiago,
was then selected as a landing place
fur the arms and ammunition, and the
Vixen and Suwanee arrived there on
Wednesday afternoon. General Ce

j were waiting and the supplies were
successfully landed by surf boats.
General Ceberaco was enthusiastic
over the Juan Gonzales incident.
"Splendid," he cried, when he boarded
the Vixen. "The shot landed right in
the center of the cavalry and several
were killed."
From Aserradero the Suwar.ee steam

War Department Criticized for the
Delayed Departure of the
Transports.
Call Office, Riggs
House, Washington,
June 14. â The six
hundred marines
at Caimanera are
in a precarious sit
uation and are lia
ble to be massacred
at any time by the
Spaniards, who
seem to have adopt
ed the devilish guer^
rilla method of war
fare. The general
opinion in Washing
ton is that some one
blundered in land
ing this handful of
men and exposing
them to the merci
less fire of Spanish
forces vastly supe
rior in numbers.
When it became known to-day
immediately after the Cabinet
meeting that the Santiago expe
dition had not yet left Key West
there was a very profound feeling
of disgust with the War Depart
ment, although it was later an
nounced that the troops were
now actually on their way. It is
now said that the expedition
"may be expected to arrive at its
destination by Friday," but
Washington Rpopls wno have be
come familiarwith these promises
and delays do not know what to
believe.
Admiral Sampson's cablegram
received to-day shows that the
Spaniards have begun to prac
tice the inhuman barbarities so
characteristic of them in guerrilla
warfare. The manner of the
Spanish attack on the marines
:ahd the horrible mutilation which
Admiral Sampson reports was in
fticted upon the bodies of the four
men killed opens the eyes of the
department to the kind of warfare
which they must expect in Cuba.
The campaign will have to
be conducted as if it were

among savages, and steps
will be taken to very largely
increase the forces of
scouts.
The commanding general will
be advised to guard particularly
against ambush. It is anticipated
that immediately after landing
the troops steps will be taken, be
fore proceeding in the campaign,
to assemble a large force of in
surgents and organize them into
scouting parties to operate
against bushwhackers, who, it is
now known, will be encountered,
and to clear the way for the op
erations of the invading army.
In this way the insurgents can
be of real service, and it is prac
tically the only assistance of im
portance which they can render.
Their familiarity with the country
and the methods of warfare which
the Spaniards have evidently
adopted will enable them to pro
tect our troops from harassing
ambushes.
The two squadrons of Roose
velt's Rough Riders, most of
whom are old Indian fighters,
also will be available for scout
duty, their lack of familiarity with
the country being provided
against by a detail of native
scouts.
The regulars who have
been used to Indian warfare
will adoptthe methodswhich
they have heretofore em
ployed in dealing with In
dians.
It is evident to the department
that the Spaniards do not place
any reliance upon their ability to
meet our army in an open fight
or to withstand a siege, but that
they propose to employ small
bands of guerrillas throughout
the island, to lay ambushes and
shoot down pickets from under
cover.
Having started the Santiago expedi
tion, the War Department has now
concentrated all Its energies on the
preparation of the force to be sent to
Porto Rico. Active movements in that
line have been made on a scale so ex
tensive as to lead to the supposition in
some quarters that the attack is to bo
directed upon Havana, but if this is so,
there is no open indication of it. The
volunteers collected at Chattanooga,
42,000 in number, are reaching a degree
of excellence, under the magnificent
management of General Brooke, that
would warrant the Government in or
dering them Immediately into active
service, but, unfortunately, there is
still a considerable lack of equipment
that will not permit of this.
General Merritt has brought the sec
ond installment of his force into readi
ness and will sail for Manila to-mor
row. It is believed that the advance
guard, the three transports which fol
lowed the Charleston to Honolulu, met
the cruiser there and sailed in her com
pany for the Philippines about the be
ginning of this month. In this case it
is reasonable to expect them to arrive
at Manila within a week.
An unexpected complication has
arisen as to the right of Admiral Samp
son at Santiago and Admiral Dewey at
Manila, to use the cables which each
has secured, with a view to bringing
them into direct telegraphic communi
cation with the authorities here. It is
understood by officials here that Ad
miral Dewey secured the shore end of
the cable from Manila to Hongkong
some time ago and buoyed it with a
view to sending dispatches.
The same condition is understood to
exist at Santiago, where Admiral
Sampson has buoyed the shore end of
the cable with a view of repairing and
using it. But no messages have been
sent, and the question has arisen as to
whether it is allowable under the rules
of neutrality for the French and Brit
ish companies owning these lines to
permit them to be used for strictly mili
tary purposes.
The companies control the points of
exit and are able to refuse to pass dis
patches along, so that the holding of
the shore ends by Admirals Dewey and
Sampson does not permit them to carry
on communication, except through the
assent of the companies. These are

private concerns, but they are bound to
observe the neutrality of their respec
tive governments.
There is some anxiety, therefore, as
to the course of the operators of the
French company at Haytl when they
receive messages from Admiral Samp
son. Should they refuse to handle
them over neutral lines, touching neu
tral territory, an international ques
tion may arise. The same condition
exists as to the Manila cable, and the
failure to receive dispatches from Man
ila is attributed to the failure of the
British operators at Hongkong to take
the messages.
It is stated to-night that negotiations
are now progressing which give prom
ise of a satisfactory understanding
with the companies and the forwarding
of such matters as the admirals send.
BARBAROUS MUTILATION
OF FALLEN MARINES
Outrages for Which Spain Will Be
Made to Pay Dearly When
the War Ends.
NEW YORK, June 14.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegTaphs:
Officers of the army and navy In Wash
ington have been reluctant to believe
that the Spanish troops which fought
against the marines at Guantaname
were guilty of mutilating the bodies of
the dead, but the evidence that they
did so is conclusive. It was at first
thought possible that the wounds pro
duced by the Mauser rifles at close
range had been such as to lead to the
belief that the bodies of the dead men
had been hacked after death, but Ad
miral Sampson's report that the bodies
were mutilated leaves no doubt on the
subject. All officials of the Govern
ment are unmeasured in their denun
ciation of the barbarities displayed by
the Spanish soldiers, though the com
ment is made that nothing else could
be expected from a nation which would
blow up a warship of a friendl;. power
in its harbor. It will be more than
ever necessary to plan the campaign
so that the United States shall in every
conflict with the Spaniards have an
overwhelming force of troops, so as to
crush the enemy and retain possession
of the field after the fight.
Spain will have to pay dearly for her
savage methods in the end, for when
at last her fleets have been wiped out
and her armies have been defeated and
she sues for peace she will find the
condition as to territorial concessions
and monetary indemnity made much
more burdensome on account of the
savage means she has employed in
prosecuting the war.
Every effort is to be made by the
commanders of the American forces to
prevent their men. who will naturally
be made very indignant by the actions
of the Spanish, from retaliating in the
same way upon the dead of the enemy.
Now that it is known the Spanish
cannot be reiied upon to wage war ac
cording to civilized methods all the
officers will be instructed to take ex
traordinary precautions to prevent
dead and wounded falling into tlie
hands of the enemy, for it is not be
lieved Spanish soldiers who would
hack a dead body would hesitate to
treat the wounded the same way.
PERILOUS RAILROAD TRIP.

DENVER, June 14.â The train load of

from Chicago had been covered in

Pixty hours. The Burlington road made
the great run.
The train left New York last Friday

PRAISE FOR THE MARIETTA.
WASHINGTON, June 14.â 1n the gen
eral admiration excited by the splendid
performance of the big battleship Ore
gon in running from San Francisco
clear around South America to Join
Sampson before Santiago, the equally
meritorious run of the little gunboat
Marietta over most of the same course
has been lost sight of. Like the Ore
gon, the Marietta is a product of a Pa
cific Coast shipyard, and the high char
acter of the work done in constructing
this ship is shown by the captain's
statement that the little boat made this
long 12,000-mile voyage without stop
ping for repairs. Considering the great
disparity in the size of the Oregon and
the Marietta the performance of the
latter is certainly quite as remarkable
as that of the Oregon, even though the
time made was not as good.
TRANSPORTS
START FROM
PORT TAMPA
After Many Delays the
Fleet Is Under Way
at Last.
Thirty-Five Troopships and Four
teen Convoys Sail for the
Cuban Coast.
TAMPA, Fla., June 14. â After weeks of waiting and
preparation, the first army of invasion to start from the east
ern shores of the United States departed under the command
of General Shafter this morning at 9 o'clock. The fleet of
transports consisted of thirty-five vessels, four tenders and
fourteen convoys.
These are all now upon the Gulf of
Mexico, headed southward, until they
pass Key West, at least. If the desti
nation be Cuba, they will continue their
present course until Cape Antonio, at
the west of the island, is doubled, when
an easterly course will be sailed until
they reach the vicinity of Santiago.
As already stated in these dispatches,
the actual embarkation of the troops
began on Monday, June 6. The work
proceeded diligently until late on Wed
nesday afternoon, when, after the de
parture of several vessels, an Impor
tant order came calling a halt in the
proceedings. The Castlne was dis
patched at once to overhaul the dis
appearing vessels and recall them.
They all came back but one, the City oft
Washington, which was reported to be
aground down the bay. It has been sub
sequently learned, however, that this
vessel had outstripped the mesenger
until the coast of Cuba was really
sighted. Neither the Washington nor
the Castine returned to Port Tampa
until Saturday.
The alleged cause of the delay was
the report that the Hornet, while out
scouting, had sighted several Spanish
warships. Like a wet blanket came
the order to halt. Cheerfulness was dis
placed by keen disappointment. Two
questions were on every tongue â "Has
Spain surrendered?" "Has our fleet
met with a reverse?" The former met
with the readiest belief, many believ
ing the words in the order, "indefinitely
postponed," meant peace.
The unloading of the Florida, which
had been run into by the Miami and
seriously damaged last Wednesday,
gave grounds for the rumor that all the
transports were being unloaded. News
paper men were confidentially told on
Friday night that they had better go
on board. The following day it was
openly stated that the sailing would
occur on Sunday noon.
The rush of the previous Monday was
repeated. General Miles and his staff
went to Port Tampa on Sunday morn-
Ing at 6:30 to deliver parting Instruc
tions. During a heavy rain squall on
Saturday night, while the transports
were straining at their cables, the lit
tle tug Captain Sam steamed from ship
to ship, megaphoning the order, "Stand
ready to sail at daylight."
Above the roar of the storm wild
cheers were heard and a brieht flash of
lightning revealed the soldiers stand
ing in the rain waving their wet hats
and hurrahing.
When the morning broke the piers
were lined with transports, the docks
were crowded with boxcars, flatcars.
stockcars, baggage and express cars.
Most of these were crowded with sol
diers, whÂ« were cheered until their ears
ached apd who cheered in return until
hoarse. Bright-colored dresses and
fragile parasols in the crowds of blue
coats Indicated the presence of the fair
sex.
Horses and mules were kicking up
clouds of dust, and the sun poured
down In hot rays, sweltering the mass
of humanity. Thus Sunday passed,
the transports at the docks and those
In midstream receiving their quota of
men and the necessaries" to sustain
them.
General Miles again went to the port
on Monday on the early train. The
stirring scenes continued, the mad rush
had not abated. General Miles, from
the observation end of the car, watched
the crowd as it passed near him. The
transports, swinging at their moorings,
were plainly in view, as were also many
of those at the docks, indicating that
the embarkation of animals was pro
gressing satisfactorily.
Shortly after 9 o'clock the funnels of
the transports began pouring forth col
umns of black smoke. The Margaret,
Olivette and Mateo and Laura were
visiting the fleet, giving water to one,
troops to another, animals and equip
ments to another. Along the pier could
be heard the voices of the transport
commanders as they gave their orders
to cut loose. The gangplanks were
pulled in, the hatchways closed, lines
cast off and the engines were put into
motion.
The vessels backed into the bay and
anchored to await the order to sail.
The Mattewan hove her cable short at
10 o'clock. All eyes were rivet 3d on the
Seguranca, the flagship, and when the
final signal came a mighty shout arose.
From the lower row of portholes hats
were waved. Anchor was quickly
weighed and the great vessel pointed
her prow down the bay. In a few min
utes the City of Washington, Rio
Grande, Cherokee, Iroquois and Whit
ney followed. As these boats picked
their way through the anchored fleet
men shouted and bands played. Every
vessel elicited a wild display of en
thusiasm. These were the only vessels
to depart in the forenoon, some of them
going over to St. Petersburg to procure
water.
General Miles, evidently becoming
Impatient, embarked on the Tarpoon at
12:30 and went out among the fleet, go-
Ing as far down the bay as St. Peters
burg, and not returning until 4 o'clock.
In the meantime the transports were
6teaming down the bay.
In the afternoon the Morgan cut a
path of white foam down the channel
and her lead was followed by the Vigil
ancia, San Marcos, Clinton, Yucatan,
Stillwater, Berkshire, Olivette, San
tiago, Arkansas, Seneca, Saratoga,
Miami, Loena, Breakwater and Comal!
By the time these vessels had moved
away darkness had enveloped the re
maining ships, from whose sides glim
mered long rows of lights. The Knick
erbrocker No. 13 and the Orizaba had
much to take on during the night. The
last to be loaded were eager to com
plete the task for fear they might be
left. By daylight all the ships except
the Seguranca had moved down the
bay. At 9 o'clock the Seguranca, amid
cheers and the blowing of whistles, fol
lowed.
General Shafter and his staff were
the last to leave. The last orders were
handed to lieutenant Miley, an aid to
General Shafter, this morning, and Im
mediately the flagship started.
The convoys for the transport ships
are as follows: Indiana, Detroit, Scor
pion, Vesuvius, Helena, Castine, Ann
apolis, Panther, Hornet, Manning, Ban
croft, Wampatuck, Eagle and Wasp,
After passing the bar at the entrance
of this harbor th*| fleet will form In two
divisions of threl columns each. The
columns will te 800 yards apart,
abreast, containing five vessels, each 400
yards apart. Between the two divisions
will be a space of 1000 yards. The con
sorts will occupy points of vantage sur
rounding the transports.
HONORS AHEAD
FOR SAMPSON
Will Shortly Be Made a
Commodore.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 14. âActing
Rear Admiral Sampson, commanding
the naval forces operating In the West
Indies, whose actual rank in the navy
is that of captain, will become a com
modore on the 3d proximo by the stat
utory retirement of Rear Admiral Wil
liam A. Kirkland, commandant of the
Mare Island navy-yard, who is now the
ranking officer of the navy.
In the event of a successful perform
ance of the important duties assigned
him in the West Indies, including the
capture and occupation of Santiago de
Cuba and San Juan, Porto Rico, of
which his friends have no doubt what
ever, Captain Sampson is also assured
of further promotion to the actual rank
of rear admiral, this being the highest
grade to which he can attain until Con
gress shall recreate the grade of vice
admiral for his special benefit. This
office was established during the War
of the Rebellion, and lapsed with the
death of those who had held it, Ad
miral Porter and Vice Admiral Rowan.
The plan of promotion adopted by
President McKlnley in the case of Ad
miral Dewey and his captains for their
great achievement in the harbor of
Manila undoubtedly will be followed
in case of similar victories by Admiral
Sampson and his captains on this side
of the water.
In addition to Admiral Kirkland, five
other admirals will retire during the
next few months by operation of law
on account of age. They are Admiral

S. F. Bunce, commanding the New;.

Norton, commanding the Washington,;

With the exception of Admiral Milâ i
ler, all of these officers are likely to be.
retained in their present places after,
their retirement during the continu
ance of the war with Spain, because
of the non-availability of officers, on
tfco active list to take their places. Re
tired officers are subject to duty of this
kind in time of war at the discretion,
of the President. It is different, how
ever, with Admiral Miller. He is in.
command of a fleet, and retired officers
are not eligible for such duty unless
specially authorizr-d by act of Congress.
Admiral Kirkland is a native of'
North Carolina, and it is his purpose^
to make his home in that State when';
he ie relieved from duty. Of the seven,!
rear admirals, only two are in com
mand of fleets, Admiral Mii'er, com
rr. 'i ruling the Pacific squadron, and Ad
miral Dewey, commanding the Asiatic
rquadron. Of the officers having flag
commands, two are full rear admirals,
one an acting rear admiral, and the
others commodores.
Admiral Miller, the senior officer, haa
three vessels in his squadron, and Act
ing Rear Admiral Sampson, the junior
of them all, has over seventy vessels
under his command. The last named
officer does not attain the actual rank
of a flag officer until he becomes a
commodore next month by the retire
ment of admiral Kirkland. His rank as
captain, which he now bears in the
naval register, would not ordinarily en
title him to a higher command than
that of a single vessel, and in putting
him in command of the largest and
most powerful fleet that was ever
gathered under the United States flag,
the President found It necessary to
give him the nominal rank of acting
rear admiral. That designation clothed
him with all the authority necessary to
the execution of the hiehly important
duty confided to him. but carried no
increase of pay or emoluments and no
permanency of rank. No greater com-i
pliment was ever paid an officer of th*
United States navy.

FLTJNGEB SAYS THERE WILL BE
NO ASSIGNMENT.
All of His Cash Wheat Bought by
â¢ Armour, Who Declares the
Bankrupt's Backers Will
.Not Lose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 4.â Justice Daly of
Ihe Supreme Court has issued an at
tachment against the property of Jo
eeph Leiter, the wheat speculator of
Chicago, for $793,925 in favor of Otto E.
Loehrke, William P. Callaghan and
William Knight, grain dealers, for
money advanced. The attachment was
levied upon funds belonging to Leiter
and deposited in the Chase National
Bank, the Hanover Bank and other
financial concerns in the city.
The plaintiffs, who comprise the firm
of Otto E. Loehrke & Co., assert they
advanced, at the special instance and
request of Leiter, in various sums,
$793,925, since February, 1898, which he
promised to pay on demand. They al
lege that he has refused to pay the
â¢amounts so advanced to him. The at
tachment was issued on the ground [
that Leiter is a non-resident.
CHICAGO, June 14.â 1t was stated' by |
friends of Joseph Leiter that the at- |
tachment issued against him in New i
York will not affect the situation and
â¢will not force an assignment. Tne ap
peal to the court in New York was evi
dently expected, as a representative of I
a creditor was here and told Mr. Leiter i
he was "going to do something." Mr. |
Leiter told him to go ahead and do it.
Mr. Aarons, counsel for the plaintiffs,
â¢aid that Loehrke, one of the complain
ants, was the shipping agent in this
city for Leiter and had handled for him
many millions of bushels of wheat.
Mr. Aarons said his clients were not
antagonistic to Leiter and secured the
attachment because of the number of
Interests they protect. The attach
ments, Mr. Aarons said, would prob
ably be satisfied before the close of the
day.
P. D. Armour to-day bought all of
Joseph Leiter's cash wheat in the
Northwest, amounting to 4,000,000 or
6,000,000 bushels. Semi-authoritativo
Information is also obtained that Ar
mour will take up all of Leiter's wheat.
Joseph Leiter, speaking of the col
lapse of his wheat deal, says:
" It was a case where the tail has be
gun to wag the dog. This statement
has its illustration in the fact that
futures began breaking faster than
cash wheat declined. Logically, the
conditions should have been exactly
the reverse. For several daysâ in fact,
I may say for some weeks â cash wheat
has been slow sale, especially in the !
Northwest and around milling centers
generally. To a certain extent this has
been offset by a fair degree of activity
at the seaboard in response to inquiry
from the other side, but the local mar
kets have been decidedly inclined to
drag-. There has been a steady mar- i
keting of cash wheat, but I cannot say
as to the quantities in which it has
gone into home consumption, or abroad
for foreign uae.
'â¢I see no objection to stating that all j
my holdings of futures have been dis- *
posed of. A good deal of gossip has
come to me on the general subject of |
alleged treacherous conduct on the part !
of Northwestern grain interests which I
I have always heretofore considered |
friendly to me in a personal and busi- j
ness way; but I have nothing what- !
ever to cay on this subject. If in the
Jiistory of the deal there have been
events to which the public is entitled,
It is more than likely that the facts
will come out in good time, but not
from me. I have no complaints to make
or charges to prefer."
Mr. P. D. Armour, himself one of the
central figures in the Leiter deal,
which has been going on for many
months, did not take a particularly
gloomy view of the situation. He said:
"Most of tho wheat with the banks is
margined at *0 cents a bushel. I con
fidently believe the market will react,
possibly before the end of the week,
wheat has got down to a point where
|t is worth the money, regardless of
speculation. The arrangement which I
understand han been perfected pro
vides for the protection of all parties
Jn interest. Leiter's cash wheat, in all
positions between the Northwest and
Europe, ought to be handled so the
banks will not have to take a lops.
"I do not believe any of the local
people who had acted for Mr. Leiter
were hurt, and the feeling of the trade
eeems to be most kindly toward him.
When he decided to carry his June
â wheat we offered to help him in any
â¢way we could. I regret that the deal
has turned out as it has, but I believe
that the worst of it is known and that
the market will promptly react."
LONDON, June 14.â The collapse of
the Leiter wheat corner has caused a
panic in the Liverpool market. In Lon
don the news of the collapse was re
ceived with equanimity. The consensus
of opinion of a number of operators on
Mark Lane is that the English market
â will gain steadiness now that the plun
ger, operating without regard to mar
kot precedents, is shaken out. It is
asserted on Mark Lane that the col
lapse was duo to Messrs. Armour and
Pillsbury. Tho newspapers generally
rejoice at the breakdown of the Letter
plans and point to it as a moral. Tho
Star says:
"If the prime mover in this war
against mankind is beggared by his
brood the retribution is well merited.
Nothing can atone for the awful suf
fering Leiter and his accomplices have
caused." ____^________

SHIPS IN THE
STREAM AND
NOW READY.
Continued from First Page.
culated by an air blower in the for'ard
part of the ship, and other pipes, of
which the scientific name is take-ups,
carry off the heated air in another di
rection. Electric bulbs, full of promise
for tlie immediate future, twinkle in the
light from huge bulkhead lamps which
cover the present necessity.
The men slept, lounged, arranged
iheir personal belongings and were
strangely still. The business of war
has begun f>>r them. Even to youth,
courage and confidence that thought
must be sometimes grim. And they
are far from their own. Perhaps there
was something in the cordial, cheerful,
patriotic good-bya we gave them that
them hunger for the good-bys of
Colorado, of Pennsylvania, of Utah, of
home.
The stperage proper has no patent
Turner beds, no patent air blowers, no
electricity. The men sleep on the old
fashfoced canvas stretcher which may I
be ripped from its iron supports and put
through the wash. They have port
holes to both sides of them and take
their cold air straight from the sea.
They seemed content with such modest
delights as these, and, on my soul, I,
too, would prefer them to all the mod
ern improvements which go to mitigate
the darh peculiarities of the banana
deck.
"By the way," I asked the captain,
"why is it called the banana deck?"
"Because," said the captain, "It la
where we carry bananas."
But who would have thought of so
simple a reason? Especially now, with
half of eight hundred and seventy-one
soldiers stowed away in it.
"Boots" was among them.
"Boots" is the mascot of his regi
ment, with his name and number
stitched upon his left sleeve. It is the
Bleeve of a soldier and the heart of a
â¢r beats away under It. He stood I
about to my belt In his little stock
ings and he had marched the foot out
â  of them and dug his five little
boy toes into the banana deck as he
talked.
"Why did you come. Boots?"
" '<_';. use I wanted to."
"Wanted to fight?"
Boots smiled. "I wanted to stick by
the boys."
"Havf you known them very long?"
"I joined four years ago. I went with
'em to the strikes."
"Has he got a mother?" I asked.
"Oh, yes," said one of the men, "but
iho couldn't keep him. He's ours."
The upper deck swarmed with girls
âgirls in sailor hats and coats glitter
ing with military buttons, and an air
>f following tho army. They flirted
recklessly, glanced ktlling'.y. clung ten-
Serly, parted regretfully when the hour
Â»f parting came â wept a tear or two,
genuine, I dare say. For a handsome
Boldier is something to weep for, isn't

On the Broadway wharf was neither
raiety nor grief. Only the grind to get
â¢eady and the bitterness of hope de
terred. Not only was everything late
â¢or the Senator, but early in the day
Â»er ice machine broke down and ma
:hinists were called from the Union
Iron Works to make the necessary re
jairs. It was night before the refrig
erator was repaired and the ship ready
so go out into the stream. The Ne
braska men arrived at the dock to find
the prospect of departure declining
into the small hours of the morning.
They played handball in the streets
before the pier, to the joy of the water
front vagabondia, and affected not to
hear the joyous whistle of the Zealan
dia sliding out into the stream. The
tide was running hard against her and
as the lines were cast her nose prod
ded viciously into the pier. Three times
she made a false start which took her
straight against the piles and then the
little Monarch puffed up beside her and
pulled her clear.
The boys below felt the motion undet
them and swarmed to the deck. The
boys on the deck climbed to the rail
and the rigging. The crowd on the pier
cheered hoarsely.
The men hung over the side, waving
their hats, their handkerchiefs, their
empty hands â thrilled with the vivid
sense of departure. The men and
women on the pier ran out to the edge
of it, stretching out their arms, crying,
cheering, waving hats and handker
chiefs, too, but not so gaily â chilled
with the sense of being left behind.
IN LINE AT SUNRISE.
Early Morning Scenes When
the Troops Marched From
Camp Merritt.
"With the first refulgent rays of the
rising sun melting through the mist
crowned summit of Lone Mountain,
4000 brave boys in blue yesterday morn
ing shouldered their arms and
marched away from Camp Merritt to
the stirring music of many bands and
the cheers of many comrades. Right
royal was their departure and sincere
were the "good by" and "God bless
you" of their less fortunate comrades
who must remain until the order of "on
to Manila" releases them from the chaf
ing Inactivity of camp. Those who
were left are envious but not Jealous,
and in the "godspeed" that they have
those who departed they best expressed
the longing of their soldierly hearts â
the desire as It were â "to be up and at
them."
Impressive to that degree that leaves
an ineffaceable picture in one's memory
were the scenes and incidents attend
ant upon the leaving of the second ex
pedition from Camp Merritt. It is
such scenes that we treasure, it is such
memories that remain green when time
has laid its killing blight upon our
keener mental faculties. As I watched
those brave soldiers go forth frum
camp with that firm and confident ex
pression upon their countenances, I
knew that they went to do or die.
There was no doubting the purpose of
their resolve â it was indelibly stamped
upon everything they didâ and as the
long, blue columns marched away with
their standard proudly fluttering in the
breath of the early morning, I knew
those same men were going to make
rich the future annals of history. They
went, nay, they have gone, as older
men have told me their predecessors
went in bygone days, and whether the
fortunes of war accord to the3e soldiers
victory or defeat, some of them will
leave behind them an honored and
priceless heritage to those who shall
come after. Yes, they will leave be
hind them, mark it such deeds as may
be told around the family hearthstone â
deeds that fire* the hearts of the young.
that incite to emulation and that will
mold our country's future patriots.
The cool chill of night still hung over
the tented field when the clear and
mellow-toned notes of the bugle awoke
the echoes with the "Reveille" call. In
the uncertain light of the morning I
saw the dim figures of stalwart men
emerge from their tents and form in
silent lines to answer to their names
for the last time at Carrip Merritt. The
roll call over, these same men began
their systematic preparations for de
parture. Like bo many well-regulated
machines they busied themselves here
and there, and as the light grew
stronger and I could see them more dis
tinctly I recognized the wonderful force
of perfect discipline; I appreciated the
power of the ceaseless drill. Every
man had something to do and he was
doing it. Each soldier was doing the
right thing at the right time, and in
the right place. These soldiers, by
virtue of the laws of the art of war,
have resolved themselves into so many
perfectly made cogs in a perfectly
made machine.
With precision and grace, at the bu
gle call, the white tent* fluttered down

and were rolled up and packed away,
while none the less systematically each
soldier prepared his kit in heavy \
marching order. Then the camp lug- j
gage and the effects of the officers were !
packed and placed in piles to be re- j
moved later in large drays. Quietly
the men partook of their last meal, and
this over there was a short space of
time in which their comrades, and the !
brother officers of those departing, came i
to say good-by and to wish success
and safety. Exchanges of good fel- i
lowship were cut short by the "first
call," and the fighting machines un- j
hesitatingly fell into ranks. Then the '
officers, the men who are to lead and
direct these soldiers, assumed com
mand, and the final roll was called by
the sergeants, and the guns dropped
automatically from the "right shoul
der" as the men answered "Here" in
a way that meant that they were there,
yes, there to stay, and if need be to
die. I felt the fever of patriotism run
hot through my veins at the ominous
opening and closing of the gun cham
bers.
There was a suggestive music in the
metallic rattle that painted in no un
certain colors the battlefield, the roar
of musketry, the clash of arms, the
charge, the laying down of life for
country, and above all the victory won.
There came the command to "march,"
and the various companies formed in
columns and filed from their camp.
First the two battalions of the Eight
epnth and Twenty-third, then the First
Colorado Regiment and next the Utah
Light Artillery. Later in the day the
Tenth Pennsylvania, First Nebraska
and the detachment from the Corps of
Engineers followed, they being detained
in their departure because their trans
ports were not ready for them to go
aboard.
As the columns filed out on to First
avenue the drum major tossed up Into
thf nir his baton, and the morning sun
kissed its bright, silvery head and
threw a kindly glint of pure rays In
all directions â and then there was a
crash of cymbals, a long roll of the
snare drums and a blast from the
hornsâ and to the stirring strains of a
lively two-step those proud soldiers
swung off with measured and quick
ened step, while from every camp there
burst a mighty wave of cheering that
grew and swelled in volume until even
the music of the band became a softer
monotone that ran like the vein of
some sweet refrain between the waves
of those honest, soldierly cheers. Down
First avenue and up Point Lobos ave
nue those long blue columns of men and
guns marched away, and as they climb
ed the hill and then were hidden from
sierht by its crest the duet of the march,
like some sacrificial incense, bore above
the prayer that God would go with
those men and keep them safe and
bring them back to us in health and
happiness, and that for what they have
dared they may some day have all due
honor, and by right of the laurels they
may win roap the reward of a sweet
and" deserved peace.

A SOLDIER SHOT
AT CAMP MERRITT
Private Reid of the Twenty-
Third Infantry Accidentally
Wounded in the Leg.
The effect of a bullet from the Krag-
Jorgensen army rifle was painfully il
lustrated at Camp Merritt yesterday
afternoon when Private Reid, Com
pany X, Twenty-third United States
Infantry, was shot through the left leg
by Private Tullis of Company I of the
same regiment. Tullis and Reid are
among the number of new recruits who
have recently joined the regiment.
Tullis was examining his gun and
slipped a cartridge into it, when in
some way he discharged his weapon.
The bullet passed through six tents and
a haversack filled with clothing. It
then struck Reid in the left leg below
the knee, passing entirely through the
bone and shattering it in a horrible
manner. Reid was sitting in his tent
at the time. He was carried at once
to the hospital and there is very little
chance, in the surgeon's opinion, of
amputation being avoided. Tullis was
placed under arrest and he will be
severely punished.
CHIEF LEES' REVENGE.
The Military Not Likely to Cut
Him Off From Leading a
Procession Again.
This is an incident of the departure of
troops, yesterday, and tolls of Chief Lees'
mode of revenge for General Otis refus
ing to turn over the command of Camp
Merritt to the Chief and his further slight
In not ordering a consolidated parade of
the warriors, thus depriving the over-ripe
Chief of un opportunity to exhibit his in
firmities to a suffering people.
Major General Otis' lack of considera
tion for Lees, when he Issued his orders
for the embarkation of the Second Manila
expedition, amounted to more than a
slight; it verged on an insult. In the first
place, the troops were ordered to break
camp at 7 a. m., and to arrive at the ships
by 9 o'clock. This in itself was not at all
to Lees' liking, for not half the people
could get down town so early In the day,
while the residents of Alameda towns
were entirely shut out from witnessing
the display.
But to make matters worse, General
Otis, by accident or design, failed to des
ignate any line of inarch to the docks, and
as a last affront to the Chief, gave the
commanders of the regiments, battalions
and batteries comprising the expedition
power to use thefr own discretion as to
the- exact time of their departure and the
route they should take. This split the
display Into three or four minor proces
sions and effectually checked the Chief
from rushing to the front with an offer
of a police escort with himself togged up
liko a carnival prize winner, to lead the
whole Schuetzen Verein.
The Chief was sore. Only a few days
more arc left for him to place himself on
exhibition and to be defrauded out of such
an opportunity was more than he could
st;t;i'l without resenting the affront. After
hours of meditation he hit upon a plan of
revenge.
He would leave the soldiers to the ten
der mercies of a mob of enthusiastic San
Francls< ans.
His plan was carried out to the letter,
and worked to a charm. No provision
was made for an extra detail and hardly
a policeman, with the exception of Cap
tain Dunlevy's company at the docks,
was st-^n along the streets, and the few
who did lounge on the corners made no
effort whatever to clear a passageway for
the troops.
Down Market street the men literally
fought their way through the throngs,
their ranks were broken, companies were
A POSTOFFICE FOR MANILA.
George F. Conway, Who Will Be
Chief Postmaster of the
Philippines.
George F. Conway, Edward M.
Kelly and F. W. Vaille went on
board the big ships of the Manila
expedition yesterday. They will es
tablish a I'nited States postofHce at
Manila as soon as the United States
troops shall have made such a
thing possible. Mr. Conway is head
clerk of the expedition and will lose
no time in getting his iwstoitice in
order. They take with them Sever
al tons of postoffice supplies in the
shape of blanks, stamps, envelopes,
account books, money orders, regis
ter blanks, postofflce boxes and
other office necessaries.
cut off from their battalions, and the ut
most confusion reigned. Groups of wo
men rushed In amonu the soldiers and
marched with them to the dock, nor heed
ed the Ineffectual protests of the com
manding officers.
Down town trucks and express wagons
blocked the way, halting the troops, while
the drivers jeered at the soldiers' efforts
to K> t past. Near Fourth street a citi
zen proclaimed his right to perform the
functions of a peace officer and led an
express wagon out of the way. The driver
tnreatened to assault the citizen for in
terfering, but declined to accept the lat
ter's offer to get off his wagon.
Men, women and children were pitched
about and that nobody was killed by cars
or teams is not due to police protection.
The soldiers reached the docks in an ex
hausted condition after their battle with
the crowds. Altogether it was a disgrace
to the city, but Chief Lees has taught
General Otis not to overlook him again
when there is a pnrade of troops.
THE CENTENNIAL BARRED.
Last Touches on the Trans-
ports â The Next
Fleet.
The pilots were all aboard the trans
ports last night and will be ready to take
out the vessels when the order is given.
Captain F. W. Jordan is assigned to the
China, Captain yon Schmidt to the Colon,,
Captain Freeman to the Senator, and Cap
tain McCulloch to the Zealandia.
As soon as the Zealandia leaves the
Oceanic dock the Indiana will take her
place and the work of getting her ready
will begin at once. The Ohio is now at
Lombard street wharf, the Morgan City
wlll go to section 4 of the seawall, the
City of Para will be fitted out at the Mail
dock and the City of Puebla at Broad
way wharf on her return from Puget
Sound. It will be ten days or a fortnight
before this third lleet is ready to get
away.
The Government finally decided yester
day that the steamer Centennial was not
fitted for a transport, so she will not carry
troops to Manila. Her owners demanded a
resurvey after she was rejected the first
time, and an examining board was sent
from Mare Island to look her over. As
the result of their report Uncle Sam de
cided that he did not want the vessel.
The coast defense steamer Monadnock
and tbe collier Nero (lato ]the Whitgift)
are ready for their long voyage to Manila
and will probably come down from the
navy yard to-day. If nothing delays them
they may get away with the transports,
but will not reach Honolulu with them, as
the Monadnock will take her time and the
Nero will have to accommodate her speed
to that of the coast defense vessel.

PRIVATE HENRY DAMANN.
A Pathetic Story of Army Life
and Death.
Henry Damann, private, Company X
Fourteenth Infantry, United States reg
ular army, died of pneumonia Monday
evening at 7 o'clock at the French Hos
pital. He will be buried with the usual
military honors at the Presidio to-day.
It is a grievous thing that Private Hen
ry Damann should die. He was one of
those few who hold his country and his
country's honor first before his own;
from his clattering army boots to his
slouching army hat he was a patriot; to
the deepest depth of his heart he was a
patriot; in his physique, his morals and
his relations with men he was a soldier
it was bred in every line of him.
Not two years ago he loft a mother in
the little town of Fairbolt, Minn., to
make his way alone. His support hung
heavy on her meager means, and though
he had left but eighteen years behind him
he saw his duty and would do his utmost
in its fulfillment. Living how he only
knew he finally cast his lot in San Fran
cisco.
At this and at that he occupied his
time until the time came when his coun
try needfnl him. Casting everything else
behind he presented himself at the first
recruiting station. His physique was
standard, his morals the best, butâ he
lacked a year. Broken hearted he turned
away, but soon returned. He entreated
he cajoled, he fought for every point in
his favor, but there were plenty coming
in who had that extra year and they sent
him out.
Again he came, this time with a smile
of triumphant happiness and a guardian.
He had learned a trick and he made it
win. Henry Damann after two weeks of
hard patriotic fighting had earned and
won the right to light and not a day
since then has he let slip a chance to fit
himself tor it.
When his sickness came upon him he
hid it; resorted to his own unskilled rem
edies in fear that his regiment would dis
card him and his chances to fight be lost.
They took him to his last bed, in a cheer
less ward, where, Monday night, in a
spasm of dread lockjaw and fearful lung
pains, he died, unconscious.

Lieutenants Dull and Wilson, Company

however, and the surgeon had to content
himself with an Investigation Into the
probable sex and race of the skeletons.
Judging from orjiaments found In thÂ«
coffins and from fragments of clothing the
remains are those of two of the many

Lieutenant Dull says that It Is a. certain

THE "WHISPERING" BOSS.
IT is important that the rank and file of the Demo
cratic party of this city should know the character
of the man by whom they are now being led. The
Democratic organ has an interest in suppressing the
facts â the new boss having made arrangements with
it whereby it is to share in the resultant plunder â
and the duty of making public "Whispering" Gavin
McNab's record, therefore, devolves upon the Re
publican press. This is not as we should like to see
it. We are conscious that however pure our motives
they are liable to be questioned in such work, and
yet our fealty to the people renders hesitation im
possible.
James H. Barry, editor of the Star, is a member of
the committee of one hundred. He knows all about
the "whispering" boss, but he refrains from telling it
now that he has become the recipient of his favor.
On October 18, 1890, Mr. Barry wrote and published
in his paper the following interesting editorial:
"We have received a letter from the Musicians'
Union relative to Gavin McXab, Buckley's nominee
for Supervisor from the Fifth Ward, all of which
statements we know to be true. They are in brief as
follows: When a member of the Fourth of July com
mittee, 1889, he was most bitter in his attacks on said
union, characterizing its members as 'Hessian in
vaders who now wish to capture San Francisco,' as
pirates and robbers who had no right to be heard,
etc. The committee finally forced upon this city the
disgrace of having scab musicians to celebrate our
national holiday. He is now ckrk at the Occidental
Hotel. The Star at the time denounced the action
of the committee, which, however, was opposed by a
minority of its members, and we now concur with our
correspondent in urging all who feel called upon to
vote the ticket on which McNab's name stands to be
certain to scratch his name."
Prior to becoming Boss Buckley's candidate for
Supervisor from the Fifth Ward Boss McNab was a
protege of the late Republican boss, William Higgins.
In fact, he changed his politics in order that he might
with more certainty get an office. As we recall the
incident to which Mr. Barry refers in the above para
graph the opposition to the "whispering" Scot be
came so pronounced that Boss Buckley was compelled
to revoke his nomination as Supervisor. It has al
ways been believed that it was this action of the blind
sage which caused McNab to desert him. A short
time previously he had been asked by the Irving Hall
Reform Democracy to join them and he replied that
they were "sore heads" and no longer Democrats. At
that time Buckley was to his vision a first-class Dem
ocrat.
Even if the usurpation of the Democratic State
Committee in appointing a body to take charge of
the party in this city were not, as it is, a high-handed
political outrage, the leadership of the renegade Re
publican, ex-Buckleyite and "scab" workman, Boss
McNab, ought to cause a revolt in the local organi
zation. If the rank and file of the Democracy in this
city will follow an appointed county committee and
such leadership, it is surely moribund. No Democrat
with n spark of manhood in him will do it.
THE BOND ISSUE.
UNDER the terms of the circular of Secretary
Gage inviting subscriptions from the people
to the war loan of $200,000,000, the intention of
Congress to make the loan a popular one will be
fully carried out. Subscribers for small amounts will
have precedence over those who bid for larger sums,
and individuals who bid for large sums will have pre
cedence over corporations. There is nothing in the
measure which affords an advantage to the class
known as "bloated bondholders" or to speculators
who make a profit in handling bonds.
In making a popular loan of this kind in small
amounts requiring a payment of the money before the
bond is issued, there was of course a danger that the
advance of so large a sum of money might seriously
interfere with commerce and the usual financial oper
ations of the people. A withdrawal of $200,000,000
from the channels of trade even for a comparatively
short time would be disastrous to many interests.
This danger, however, has been carefully guarded
against by the Secretary of the Treasury, and under
the terms set forth in the circular it will be possible
to obtain from the people the whole sum required
without in any way interfering with business.
Since the loan has been carefully guarded in the in
terests of the people so that every man of average
means may share in it, there should be a prompt
response on the part of all. It should be a popular
loan in the full sense of the phrase. The country
needs the money. The investment is safe. It will be
for the general welfare to have the loan distributed
with something of equality throughout the country,
â¢o that the interest on it will go to every section of
the Union and not to the great financial centers only.
ThÂ« subscriptions should be liberal and prompt
THE RED CROSS f(k IR.
1""* HE pleasures ot pageantry may be indulged in
as a feature of the Red Cross fair.
â¢ It is highly probable that throughout the sum
mer troops will be here in thousands, and there may
be held a grand review, such as were often held in
Washington during the Civil War. Those reviews
had a powerfully stimulating effect upon the public
mind, and one held here in connection with the Red
Cross fair will attract thereto thousands from all
points within reach. There is a charm in a great body
of troops marching that attracts as no other pageant
can. j" â¢ *
In a properly inclosed arena, where admission may
be charged to swell the fund, there may be held
athletic games and sports, and at night we may have
the bombardment of Manila or Havana illustrated
after the style of the siege of Sebastopol, which was
seen here a few years ago. With public attention alert
to all military matters, as it is now, such a feature
would be a great drawing card. In it we could see the
representation of our military and naval heroes, and a
great variety of most interesting and exciting features
could be introduced. We have among us professional
pyrotechnists who could design such a spectacle and
stage it. During the Midwinter Fair the pyrotechnic
evenings were always patronized by thousands,
though their features were tame in comparison with
what can be produced now. Such an exhibition
could be run on certain nights in the week for an in
definite length of time and would draw to the end.
Interest in it could be sustained by the constant in
troduction of new incidents. As pyrotechnists know,
this is .easy when the scene is once laid and working.
The feat of Hobson on the Merrimac at Santiago de
Cuba could be promptly reproduced, and if in the
midst of the fair a sea fight occur, it could be put on
very promptly and be made to represent, with fair
exactness, the real action.
Nothing will better sustain interest in the fair than
this. By combining the many exhibits and various
features that are possible an immense sum of money
can be realized, which will represent, once for all, the
contribution of California to the treasury of the Red
Cross.
This State gave more than one-fourth of the $4,000,
000 raised during the Civil War to equip the Sanitary
Commission, which was the analogue of the Red
Cross Society and its forerunner. California will now
do something as significant for the successor of the
Sanitary Commission. If need be another Starr King
will arise to lead the hosts of generosity in behalf of
the wounded and suffering, and all classes in the com
munity will follow where such a leader proclaims a
red crusade of mercy and help for the suffering.
Let no one think of the difficulties of preparation,
for where all thoughts run to one center, as now, all
lier.rts and hands co-operate. This befng true, it is
incredible how suddenly affairs of this kind take form,
are installed, operated and made successful. Let the
movement begin now, for the time is not far off when
there will come from Asian tropics the cry of our
stricken men for help. Let us be ready to respond.
OFF TO THE WARS.
UNLESS something unexpected happens the sec
ond detachment of troops for the Philippine ex
pedition will leave San Francisco to-day. In
the East the movement of the American forces for the
descent upon Cuba is already well advanced. The
forward march has begun. Despite the terrors of
the hot season in the tropics, our soldiers are to de
lay no longer. In both the East and the West In
dies the blows are to be struck that will crush the
power of Spain and put a speedy end to the war.
It is inevitable that our interest should be mainly
with the troops engaged in the Manila campaign.
They have sailed from our own port, and many of
them are our own boys. Even those who hail from
distant States have been for a considerable time en
camped in the city and in some measure have been
our guests. As the transports which^ carry them to
the war steam out of the Golden Gate a thousand
evidences will show forth the patriotic fervor with
which our people bid them godspeed ami wish them
& safe return with victory and peace.
However beautiful or impressive the scene attend
ing the departure of the troops from this city may be,
it is clear we have passed the spectacular stage of the
war. The forward movement along the whole line
means the beginning of the campaign In dread earnest.
Hereafter the contest is not to be made solely from
the safe position of ironclad ships and with long
range guns. The first news which came after the land
ing of our troops at Guantanamo Bay was of a night
attack of Spanish guerrillas upon a small detachment
of Americans encamped near the woods. By stealthy
foes ambushed in the darkness and the thick under
growth of the tropic forests four Americans were
killed. That incident illustrates the nature of
the war that is to come. That is the Spanish method
of fighting. It is such news as that we must expect
until our men by one swift rush may force the evasive
foe into a corner and there crush him.
How long the war will last and how long our brave
boys will be absent it is impossible to foresee. The
intelligence of the world does not doubt the success
of our arms any more than the moral sense of man
kind doubts the justice of our cause. Were we con
fronted by a race that fights in the open and stakes
the issue of war upon battles to be decided by cour
age, discipline and military skill, the contest would
be over before the summer passes, and we might
even have peace in sight when we celebrate the
Fourth of July. We are not likely to have such swift
results, however, in a contest with Spain. The Span
iard is as tireless in his skulking as in his hate. He
will make it a long-drawn guerrilla war if he can,
and the conditions of his tropic islands will aid him
in doing 60.
Our troops, therefore, are going upon an expedi
tion which will require true heroism to bring to a
successful termination. Not valor only, but fortitude,
patience and an unswerving fidelity to duty will be
required of them. They merit, therefore, every honor
we can give to the patriotic brave as they set forth
from both sides of the continent to carry the power
of our arms and the glory of our flag beyond the
sea.
Nothing would please the people of thi3 country
more than to learn that Weyler was leading an ex
pedition to the Philippines. While the strict demand
of justice is that he be shot in Cuba, there is no use
haggling over details. The thing to do with Weyler
is to kill him on the spot, and never mind the loca
tion of the spot.
Kansas cannot be so much blamed for having
lynched a murderer. Even the humblest citizen is
entitled to justice, and there is no other method by
which the Kansas murderer ever gets it
The man who burned his wife's Easter bonnet made
a mistake. He would have found that to roast the
milliner would have been as satisfactory.
Germany's eyes may be on the Philippines, but the
guns of the United States are there also. In this case
possession is ten point* of the law.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15, 1898.
WOODLAND is as much involved in J the war
with Spain as any other city in the State or
in the Union, but just at this time she is not
giving so much attention to it as the rest of the coun
try. She wishes to send her quota of men to the front
and her sympathies are with the brave boys who are
going to battle, but for the present her thoughts are
mainly intent upon things at home. She has good
reason for this temporary indifference to the
wrinkled front of war and this absorption in her own
affairs. The Grand Parlor of Native Daughters has
assembled at Woodland, and the town is so full of
beauty that it cannot hold anything else or even talk
of it.
In devoting all her energies just now to the enter
tainment of her visitors Woodland shows no lack of
patriotism. In fact the assembly there of so many of
the noblest as well as the fairest of California's
daughters has probably infused the city with more of
ardent and fervent patriotism than it ever felt before.
We may be sure that through their speeches at the
formal meetings of the parlor, by their conversation
at receptions, by the subtle influence emanating from
their beauty and their womanhood, the Native
Daughters will instill into the minds of all who hear
or see them a feeling of patriotic loyalty as well as of
chivalric love.
The organization of the Native Daughters and the
annual assembly of the Grand Parlor at one point of
the State after another serves the general welfare of
ihe community in many ways. It is a good thing to
have the vigorous and loyal young womanhood of the
commonwealth always organized and ready to act on
behalf of any good cause which needs their services.
It is also beneficial to have the influential women of
the State visit in turn the various towns of the dif
ferent sections, thus making themselves acquainted
with the State as a whole and obtaining a comprehen
sive knowledge of the attractions and advantages of
all. From the association and from the meetings of
the Grand Parlor much has been gained in the past
both for California and her womanhood, and there
can be no doubt that in the future even more will be
gained with the increasing membership and power of
the organization.
The Grand Parlor is to be congratulated upon as
sembling this year in a city of so many attractions
and such boundless hospitality as Woodland. They
have been greeted there with a welcome that is truly
Californian. The occasion is one which will be long
remembered with pleasure on both sides, and the
people of other sections of the State as they read the
reports of the reception will feel a gratified pride that
California has such daughters, and possesses commu
nities that know so well how to appreciate their worth
and honor their presence.
JOSEPH LEITER'S COLLAPSE.
J~\ CCORDING to reports from Chicago Joseph
/ A Leiter has not made an assignment, but "his
* *â  interests have been trusteed." The words are
different, but the meaning is essentially the same.
Mr. Leiter has collapsed. Another young Napoleon
of the stock market has, like the mighty conqueror
from whom his vain title is taken, pushed too far the
favors of fortune and learned too late that the very
forces which tend to victory to-day may precipitate
disaster to-morrow. *^
Leiter began his career in the wheat market a^ a
time when every force in the commercial world fought
on his side. He was backed by millions of capital,
reviving prosperity throughout the country inclined
men of wealth to follow and assist enterprise, a fail
ure of the crops in Europe caused a large demand
for American grain; there was an upward tendency
everywhere. In his first ventures Mr. Leiter merely
embarked boldly upon a current which of its own
strength carried him to fortune.
This, however, is a mutable world. Things go by
turns. The highest tide sooner or later reaches a
point where it stops and from which it eventually re
cedes. In the very nature of mundane affairs it was
certain the currents of commerce which at first were
on the side of Leiter would in the end be against
him, and the forces that made his fortune would un
make it if he left it exposed to their operation.
Possibly if Leiter had been left to himself he would
have been on his guard against the turn in the tide
and would have retired from the wheat market for
tunate, prosperous and rich enough to be ranked
among the multimillionaires of the land. lie was not
left to himself. There gathered around him the
thousand flatterers that ever wait on success, the san
guine gamblers of the stock exchange who never
weary of the game, the horde of people who urged
him on to attempt the impossible. His name and his
picture were in every newspaper in the land. His head
was turned, so that he could see only the success be
hind him and not the impending ruin ahead. He held
en his course and shot Niagara.
His failure, of course, does not mean poverty for
him. There are other men who have been following
his lead, however, to whom it may mean absolute
bankruptcy and possibly penury. The affairs of men
in modern society are closely bound together, and
the fall of a great speculator nearly always entails suf
fering upon the part of men of small means. This
is one of the worst consequences of the evil of over
speculation and can hardly be guarded against.
All the banks that are supposed to have been in any
way associated with Leiter in his operations have
promptly announced to the public that they will not
lose anything by his failure. Such announcements
would of course be made in any case for the purpose
of preventing a loss of credit on the part of the bank,
but there are reasons for believing the statements are
correct and that the banks are safe. The effects of
the collapse of the speculator therefore will not be so
disastrous as they would have been had he been as
unscrupulous in his dealings as some other "ymng
Napoleons of finance." The moral of the story is the
old one. Nobody can corner wheat. There is too
much of it, in the first place, and in the second there
are too many other bread-making grains that people
can use in place of it.
When the New York Herald published a story of
the fall of Manila, and found the story was wrong,
it came out frankly with a statement showing wherein
it had been misled. The circumstance illustrates the
difference between the Herald and yellow journalism.
The latter would have stuck to the original statement
or passed the matter over without comment.
Spanish mutilate the bodies of the slain, and yet
have much to say about honor. They starve women
to death and whimper about American violation of
the ethics of civilization.
Perhaps the time is coming when such snubs as
pass between Lee and Blanco will find the latter in
the capacity of recipient.
One advantage the School Directors have in calling
each other names is that most of the names seem to
fit.
At least the Spanish cannot accuse the Cuba expedi
tion of indecent haste.
ENRAPTURED WOODLAND.
THE FRENCH TREATY.
Its Validity Denied and Its Effects Discussed by
Charles A. Wetmore.
Material for a pamphlet is being pre- i
pared on behalf of the San Joaquin Val
ley vine growers by Mr. Charles A.
Wetmore to be presented to the Califor
nia State Board of Trade at its regular
meeting to-morrow relative to the re
cent proclamation of the President low
ering the duties on brandies, spirits,
wines and a few other French prod
ucts in accordance with a provisional
understanding that canned meats, lard
and a few American products will be
admitted into France at reduced rates.
From a condensation of the argument
which will be presented to the board
the following conclusions of the oppo
nents of the measure were obtained
by a reporter of The Call:
It is erroneous to consider that any
commercial treaty has been entered
into or any international contract in
volving obligations which cannot be
terminated at any time w^iout breach
of faith. No treaty can be^ntered into
without the concurrence of the Senate
as provided by the constitution. Sec
tion 3 of the Dingley tariff act may be
repealed or amended by Congress at
any time without violating any inter
national obligations; so also may tho
President revoke or amend the terms of
his proclamation.
It may, however, be a question
whether the provision of section 3 au
thorizing the President to lower cer
tain tariff duties at his discretion in
favor of certain countries in considera
tion of advantages gained for certain
private parties is operative as a law
to define the duties of the President, or
whether the attempted delegation of
power is not unconstitutional inasmuch
as Congress alone has the power to
pass laws to regulate foreign com
merce, and the authority granted to
the President is not sufficiently definite
to guide his action.
It does not appear to be sufficiently
understood that, if the act of the Presi
dent should stand, lower duties on
brandies, spirits, w r ines and certain
other products have been extended to
France than the law otherwise imposes
upon other friendly nations and that
serious complaints may result. If all
kinds of spirits, brandies, gins, whis
kies, etc., may be imported from
France at $1 To per proof gallon, while
we tax Canadian, Irish and Scotch
whiskies, Holland gin, Swiss kirsch
wasser, Mexican mescal, etc., at the
rate of $2 50 per gal lan, and if we tax
German, Spanish. Portuguese, Italian
and other wines higher than the French
there will be such a regulation of for
eign commerce as only Congress has
the power to control. Under such a
discrimination in favor of France, other
countries would be compelled to yield
to the domination of French ware
houses in their trade with us.
The limitation in the President's
proclamation of the reduced duties to
products of France would be alto
gether illusory. France now exports
largely a.s the product of her skill wines
of Spain, Portugal and Italy
and of compounds of German
and other spirits, whica aftt-r

SPANIARDS NEVER READY.
Notwithstanding its frequent wars Spain
has always been unprepared for the
trouble it haa Invited and Its many de
feats have failed to teach its government
the lesson of being ready for war. Eng
land gave the Spaniards many a severe
drubbing, destroyed their navy and dock
yards, captured distant possessions time
and again and In the peace settlements
were, of course, largely the gainers, but
Spain never took heed of tha primary
causes which caused its defeats. Commo
dore Dewey'a successful attack on Cavite
and the fleet before Manila is partly due
to this chronic otate of unpreparedness.
Otherwise the result would not have been
attained at the nominal cost of shot and
shell. This latest experience is the third
at Manila, the first being in 1762, during
the war between Great Britain and Spain.
War was declared by England against
Spain on January 4 and the latter ac
cepted the resort to arms fourteen days
later. The Britl6h squadron In the East
Indies under Vice Admiral Cornish was
lying at Madras when a frigate arrived
there In June with orders to attack Ma
nila, and the fleet, consisting of eleven
vessels carrying 570 guns, made Ball for
that port, arriving there September 27,
much to the surprise of the Spaniards
who had not yet heard of the war and
were Illy prepared lor so sudden an at
lation would become French products,
so far as our custom houses are con
cerned.
It is not conceivable that Congress
realized that under section 3 of the
tariff act it was granting power to the
President to so disturb our friendly
commercial relations with foreign
countries. The inevitable result would
be trouble with other countries and
either the revocation of the proclama
tion discriminating in favor of France
or the extension of the favor to a!!
friendly countries.
As it stands we agree to discriminate
in favc-r of France against all other
countries in consideration of receiving
certain advantages which France here
tofore has given to our competitors
without equal discrimination in our
favor.
The French tariff discriminates
against all countries with which she
has not commercial treaties, so that
nearly all American manufactured
articles are excluded from her trade.
American alcohol, wines, raisins, cot
ton goods, carriages, etc., etc., are ex
cluded from French trade because she
admits the similar products of other
countries at less rates of duty.
France, however, is not excluded
from this country, her products being
received on equal terms with those of
all other countries.
We cannot consider reciprocity with
France and probably with no other
country until we have so arranged our
tariff that we have mutual discrimina
tions to i~.ba.te.
French industry is protected by a
special tariff, which is constantly main
tained as her interests demand. This
tariff is granted to countries with
which she has commercial treaties;
against all others, lie United States
included; she imposeSTier general tariff,
which is much higher and in many
cases absolutely prohibitive.
In order to be in a position to make
a satisfactory reciprocity treaty with
France and other countries, which give
discriminating favors, we must first
agree on the tariff we intend to main
tain for our own protection and declare
a higher and broader one against all
countries which do not admit our
products on equality with the most
favored nation. If to the duties of the
Dingley act 50 per cent additional were
declared and 25 per cent ad valorem
to all the free list, to be applied to all
countries discriminating against us,
we should have a fair opportunity for
a reciprocity treaty with France with
out endangering our protective system.
Until such change is made all efforts
toward reciprocity are dangerous.
Other industries besides the viticul
tural will soon feel the importance of
this question, as it is well known in
what directions new treaties are
sought. Silk and wool will soon be
heard from. In our State raisins, nuts,
prunes and oranges will be attacked.
If reciprocity is to be entered upon to
keep Mr. Kasson busy earning his sal
ary, we may have little faith in a set
tled protective tariff policy.
The remedy is a revocation by the
President of his proclamation and a re
peal of the sections of the law which
give rise to as much uncertainty as
did the advent of the Cleveland admin
istration under a promise of lower
tariffs.
tack. The siege of the city began at
once, but violent storms and torrents of
rain protracted the taking of the placo,
which was stubbornly defended by Span
iards and Indians.
The latter, although armed with only
bows and arrows, were savagely ferocious,
and rushed on to the very muzzles of the
British muskets and died like wild beasts,
gnawing at the bayonets. The English
landing force consisted of 906 seamen and
marines and about 2300 soldiers, mostly
Lascars. On October 6 Cavite was taken
by storm. To save Manila from pillage a
ransom of $4,000,000 was offered and ac
cepted, but this was not agreed to after
ward by the King of Spain, peace having
come in the interim of the negotiation and
demand for the settlement. The capture
of Manila netted only about one million
dollars in prize money of which the Ad
miral received J70.603 18 and each sailor
and soldier J3O. The loss was inconsider
able to the British, amounting in all to
32 killed, 13 drowned and 111 wounded.
Thirty-six years later two British frig
ates, La Sybiile. Captain Edward Cooke,
and the Fox, Captain Poultney Malcolm,
practiced a ruse by which they captured
several Spanish war and other vessels in
Manila Bay in the following manner: On
January 18, 1798, the two frigates passed
Corregidor Island in the evening with the
French flag flying. Next day the ships
stood toward Manila. The unsuspecting
Spanish officials hurried to do honors to
their French allies and the guard boat
with the second captain of a frigate
boarded La Sybille. Next came the Span
ish admiral's barge with the governor's
nephew, followed by a felucca with the
admiral's aides-de-camp extending con
gratulations and offering hospitality and
boats with anchors and cables to "assist
the frigates into port. The Spanish of
ficers were completely deceived and en
tertained for an hour and a half in the
cabin, and while they were opening their
hearts freely to their supposed French
friends the crews of the boats were in
vited on board and a number of British
sailors exchanged clothes with the boat
men. Tha ne*xt performance was a row
up the bay in the Spanish boats which
were accompanied by British boats. Three
gunboats lying at anchor were carried by
boarding. J
These proceedings were witnessed from
the shore and mystified the captain of the
port, who came on board T,a Svbille for
a categorical answer why the other boats
We n e .fi d S tain ! d v He also waa temporarily
mollified and handed down into the cabin
and all were entertained at dinner, while
the British blue jackets prowled about the
bay and it was not until nearly 4 o'clock
in the afternoonâ the farce having begun
at 11 o'clock in the forenoonâ that the
Spanish discovered their grievous blunder
They were sent ashore in three of their
own boats and an inventory was taken of
the captured floating property which con
sisted of three gunboats, a lot of guns and
some small arms and ship ammuni
tion. The expedition was only partly suc
cessful for the plan had been to capture
or destroy the larger Spanish ships lying
at Cavite arsenal. The wind, however
became unfavorable and the two intrepid'
British captains after a stay of four days
in the bay, left their work unfinished and
departed with their thiee captured gun
boats without having lost a man or a
rope-yarn, for the Spanish fleet was un
prepared then as it had been before and
as Spanish fleets seemingly always will
be.
ON THE TRANSPOBT.
The wind comes dead ahead- the sea
Ts pitching straight across the channel-
My parching palate seems to be
Lined with a most repugnant flannel;
Below, the mules with doleful bray
Proclaim disgust beyond concealingâ
I sympathize with them, for they
Peel just about as I am feeling.
Along the decks lie rows and rows
r,Â°v, f yj^'?^ l Boldlers . weaÃ and paling;
Behold! they leap from their repose
And fight for places at the railing-
They m on n and groan and rave and curse,
And wish the ship were at the bottom.
Or, what is traitorous and worse
That Spain might come along'and pot
em."
The starry flag, the stricken Maine
The sulking foes, the search to find 'em.
The vicious cowardice of Spain
The darling "Girls They Left Behind
Em,
And all those other memories
That soldier boys make food and drink
of
Are churned away by pounding seas
Lemons alone are what they think of.
O, war, how terrible thou art!
Inhumanâ wickedâ foolishâ cruel !
I've lived, I may say on my part
Three days on half a gill of gruel.
Whafs that? Eat pork? EAT PORxk?
O Lord!
My strongest will is unavailing!
Room! Room! Look out! I'm making
toward
That vacant spot there at the railing.

City. A dime of 1824 is not one of these
that commands a premium.

RELIEF FOR CUBAâ J. F. D., Pre
sidio. Cal. On the 17th of day. 1597. the
United States Congress voted $50,000 for
the relief of destitute Americans in Cuba.
THE UNIONâ C. F. R., City. There
are forty-live States in the Union at this

lowing States were admitted: Idaho,
July 3. 1880; Wyoming, July 11, 1890, and
Utah, January 4, 1896.
SHORTHANDâ S. A. M., City. To be z,
good shorthand writer the individual
should be able to report a speaker who
delivers 120 words a minute. An expert
writer should have no difficulty in taking
down from IGO to ISO words a minute.
GOVERNMENT WORKâ N. D. As you

kind of Government work you desire to

BRASSEY'S ANNUAL â An Inquirer,
Pacific Grove, Cal. Brassey's Annual
contains a list of all the navies of the
world as they are a very short time be
fore the date of publication. The cost of
the work is $5 per volume and it may be
obtained from any first-class book seller.
GUNPOWDER â Reader, Blue Lakes,
Humbddt County, Cal. The invention of
gunpowder is generally credited to Ber
tholdus or Michael Schwartz, a Cordelier
of Goslar, south of Brunswick, Germany,
about 1320. Many writers declare that it
was known much earlier in various parts
of the world. Some say that the Chinese
and Hindoos possessed it centuries before.
NATURALIST AND TAXIDERMTSTâ
Subscriber, City. The difference between
a naturalist and a taxidermist is that
the former is one who is versed in the
natural history of animals, while the
other is one who is skillf-cl in the art of
preparing and preserving the skins of ani
mals, also of stuffing: and mounting the
Skins so as to make them resemble the
living animals as much as possible.
ENGRAVING ON EGGS-S. J. W-, City.
The art of writing or engraving on egg
shells is very simple. It merely consists
in writing on the shell with wax or var
nish, or simply with tallow, and then
immersing the egg in some weak acid,
such, for example, as vinegar, diluted
dydrochloric acid or etching liquor. Wher
ever the varnish, wax or tallow has not
protected the shell, the lime of the latter
is decomposed and the writing remains in
relief.
MOTHSâ A Subscriber, City. In your
communication you say that you have
tried several remedies to destroy moths
and that they have not proved successful.
Now, as in your communication you do
not state what you have used, this de
partment is at a loss to give you a rem
edy against moths, as it might offer one
you have already tried. If you will give
information as to the ones you have tried
it is possible that some other will be fur
nisned.
NATIVITYâ L. B. 11., City. The ques
tion, "What would be the nativity of a
child born in China of American parent
age, also of a child born in America of
Chinese parentage?" answers itself. The
former would be Chinese and the latter
American, for an individual is a native of
the country in which he is born. Citizen
ship Is a different matter. A boy may be
born to American parents while they are
traveling in China. The boy would be a
Chinese, yet be an American citizen.
MINT MAKKSâ A. D. L... City. Coins
issued from the parent mint at Philadel
phia do not bear a letter to designate the
place of issue. There were no mint
marks prior to 1888. C is on gold coins
only Issued from the mint at Charlotte,
N. C. ; C. C, Carson City, Nev., coins; D.

Cal., coins.
There were but twenty-four dimes
coined at the San Francisco branch mint
In 1594.
SERVING THE COUNTRYâ S., Usal,
Mendoclno County, Cal. There is no law
that declares that because a man was in
the Confederate army during the war of
the rebellion he cannot now volurtteer and
take up arms in the service of the I'nited
States. In 1862 the President was au
thorized to grant full pardon to all in the
rebellion, excepting the most prominent
movers, if they would swear allpjdance to
the United States. The first proclamation
of amnesty was Issued by Lincoln, De
cember 8. 1563, oth^r proclamations were
issued subsequently, and December 2n.
1868, there was granted full amnesty to
all. The Congressional act of May 22,
1872, removed the political disabilities
from all but the most prominent Confed
erates.

ACQUIRING HAWAII.
Speaker Reed Says That Republicans
Will Surely Live to Regret
the Administration's
Course.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, June 14.
The Democrats of the House held a

son of Tennessee acted as chairman.

Alabama and Williams of Mississippi
In opposition to the Newlands resolu
tion. Sulzer of New York, De Vries of
California, Cockran of Missouri,
Brucker <>f Michigan, Taylor of Ala
bama and Ermentrout of Pennsylvania
spoke in favor of it.
King of Utah moved that the action
of the caucus be considered as binding,
but this was defeated. Dinsmore's res
olution against annexation was finally
adopted by a vote of 51 to 17.
In the course of his remarks oppos
ing annexation. Fleming of Georgia
said Speaker Reed, In conversation
with him recently, expressed the opin

TODAY THE HOUSE WILL
VOTE ON ANNEXATION
Fate of the Newlar.ds Resolution to
Be Decided at 5 O'Clock This
Afternoon.
WASHINGTON, June 14.â Eight hours,
comprising the afternoon and evening
sessions of the House to-day, were de
voted to the debate on the Newlands ros-
OlutiOQ for the annexation of Hawaii.
Twenty speeches were delivered, most of
them brief. A vote will be taken at 5
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, and in order
to give time for speeches which members
desire to make the House agreed to meet
at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. The
resolution, according to estimates to-day,
will receive, with the exception of not
more than twelve, all the Republican
votes and will enlist the support of from
fifteen to twenty Democrats and members
of other parties.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio was recognized
first, and In Introducing his remarks said
the pending question was not one of party
politics, and he would not appeal to any
of his Republican colleagues who might
oppose annexation to be contrary to their
convictions and support annexation as a
party project.
Arguing for the constitutionality of the
proposed annexation, he contended the
power was given to Congress in the "gen
eral welfare clause" of the constitution.
Replying to the claim that Hawaii is un
necessary as a naval or commercial point
in Pacific transit, because I'nalaska, on
the Aleutians, now an American posses
sion, is a route 800 miles shorter than the
Honolulu route, Mr. Grosvi-nur pn-sented
a h-tter from Commodore Melville in
which he said that, while the T'nalaska
ruute was the shorter, the dense and
long-continued fogs, the ice floes and
storms at and off Unalaska, and the ab
sence of commerce in the Aleutians made
the northern route unsafe and unprofit
able for merchant and passenger ships
Proceeding, he touched lightly the sug-
p<-sr!on that American labor, with its vig
or, intelligence and energy, would bo af
fected by the slight competition which
it would meet at the hands of the Asiat
ics in the Hawaiian Islands. Mr. Gros
venor said 1,.' advocated the resolutions
upon a ground entirely separatd from any
war emergency. He saw in the near fu
ture a wonderful development in tin- com
merce of the East, and in order to pro
vide for the western part of the country
to secure a just and profitable share in
that wealth of commerce, "this half-way
house upon the highway of the Pacific 1 '
was essential. The Ohio member was el
oquent in his defense of the Hawaiian
people against charges of ignorance and
barbarism, and referred in terms that
brought generous applause to the atti
tude of that republic in ignoring all neu
trality law and standing out against the
world to give American soldiers a resting
place in order that they might go on to
victory at Manila. He denied that the in
telligent natives of Hawaii wer opposed
to annexation.
Mr. Richardson (D.) of Tennessee fol
lowed In opposition to the pending meas
ure, laying down the general proposition
that only self-interest should be consid
ered in contemplating any step affecting
the Government, and from that point of
view alone would he treat annexation.
Mr. Richardson said he was a linn be
liever iri the Monroe doctrine and wanted
its integrity to be preserved, hut he w.ih
convinced that annexation would be a
Btep that would end unavoidably In the
abandonment of the doctrine.
Mr. C'oohran (IX) of Missouri, in a
speech replete, with comparisons with
policies of the countries of Europe, ar
pued in advocacy of colonization, not of
conquest. Failure to annex these islands.
Mr. < 'ochran said, would be to invite war,
for in five years, left to the present con
dition of population, the Government ff
Hawaii would be revolutionized and in
five years the country given over to
pngan control. The Philiijpine Islands
formed an entirely dUfereni proposition,
and he protested vigorously ngainst the
foisting of that proposition at this time
to strangle a righteous Issue.
Pearce (R.) of Missouri disputed the
contention that Hawaiian annexation
marked the beginning of a policy of col
onization contemplated by this country,
lie announced that if the question were
brought up In Congress he would vote for
a territorial government there.
Howard (DO of Georgia, in a speech oc
cupying BQOre than an hour opposing the
resolution, elaborated on the principal ar
guments advanced by the opposition and
devoted much time to a careful review
ofAmerican diplomatic relations with Ha
waii. He denominated the dominant gov
ernment in Hawaii as the 'government of
sugar, for sugar and by sugar."
Sulzer <D.) of New Yiprk and Hamilton
(It.) of Michigan In bnef speeches sup
ported annexation. Shafroth (Sil. Rep.)
Df Colorado concluded the afternoon's de
bate. He opposed the resolutions. At S:U
a recess to 8 o'clock was taken.
At the evening session few members
were present and but a few scattered oc
cupants of the- galleries looked upon the
speechmakers. Those who addressed the
House were Barhiim (R.) of California
Speery (R.) of Connecticut, BromweJl (R )
of Ohio. Hilborn (R.) of California, Show
alter (R.) of Pennsylvania, Stover (R.) of
Michigan, De Vries (R.) of California
Packer (R.) of Pennsylvania, Davidson
(R.) of Wisconsin. Gibson (R.) of Ten
nessee, for. and Crumpacker (R.) of In
diana. Kitchen (D.) of North Carolina,
and Broussard (D.) of Louisiana against
the resolution. The House adjourned at
11 o'clock.
SENATE LOBBY TO
BEJNVESTIGATED
Lodge's Resolution Ordering an
Inquiry Is Passed by the
Upper House.
WASHINGTON, June 14.â At to-day's
session of the Senate the resolution of Mr.
j Lodge of Massachusetts, directing that an j
inquiry be made into the disposition made
of the Methodist Book Concern claims
which were paid recently by Congress,
was adopted without a dissension. In the
course of the debate upon it, Mr. Morgan
of Alabama charged that the resolution
was insincere and had been drawn for po
litical effect. This statement Mr. Lodge
denied vigorously, saying his only purpose
in offering the resolution was that all the
facts concerning the matter should be laid
before the people to the end that more
care-should be exercised in the future. He
hoped that as a result of the proposed in
vestigation a general law would be passed
to eliminate the professional lobbyist from
legislative equation.
In the course of the discussion Mr. Mor
gan said that only to-day he had been
informed that a claim of $388,000 paid re
cently by Congress to the estate of John
Roach had been lobbied through Congress
and that the lobbyist had received 50 per
cent of the money. He maintained that if
the Senate was going into the investigat
ing business this and other similar re
ports should be looked into.
The measure to incorporate the interna
tional American bank was under discus
sion for three hours. Final action was not
taken on the bill.
A bill to authorize a retired list for en
listed men and appointed petty officers of
the United States Navy was passed.
Air. Allison called up a joint resolution
passed by the House yesterday appropri
ating $17:U."1 to pay the Rering Sea award.
Allison explained that precisely the same
provision was contained in the sundry
civil bill. As the award had to be paid on
June It!, and as it was manifestly impos
sible to secure the enactment of the sun
dry civil bill by that time, it was neces
sary to present a special measure to car
ry the appropriation. The resolution was
agreed t...
A Senate bill to provide a home for aged
and infirm colored people was passed.
At 2 o'clock the bill for the organization
of a Pan-American bank was laid before
the Senate and Mr. Pettus spoke in op
position to tho granting of the proposed
charter. He Bald such institutions as this
were calculated to stimulae such gam
bling transactions as those which had re
cently occurred in Chicago, where it is
made impossible for the poor to secure
bread notwithstanding the abundance of
wheat. Speaking of the Chicago trans
actions, PettuK said he thanked God that
the perpetrator had gone where he ought
to go.
In an extended reply to some of. the le
gal propositions advanced by Pettus, For
aker said the Committee on Foreign Re
lations had most carefully considered all
phases of all questions bearing upon the
bill, ami hail unanimously reported it in
the belief that it was an excellent meas
ure.
Pettus offered an amendment to the bill
providing that the proposed bank should
not charge or receive more than 6 per
cent interest on loans.
Pending a vote upon the amendment,
Perkins of California presented an argu
ment in favor of the bill. He argued that
the proposed bank was a duty to the peo
ple of this country who desired to do busi
ness with our Central or South American
neighbors, and it was a notice to the
world that the United States proposed to
make an effort to reach out for the busi
ness of the Western Hemisphere.
The Senate ;u 6:10 p. m. went into ex
ecutive session nnd soon after adjourned.
A DISHONEST DOMESTIC.
Lawyer T. Z. Blakeman's Mongolian
Scoops Up the Family Jewelry
and Decamps.
Until Sunday afternoon the household
of T. Z. Blakeman, an attorney residing
at lfiO7 Gough street, was the proud pos
sessor of a Mongolian Servant whose
equal would be hard to find in tho kitchen
and about the house in general, but un
fortunately for the ladies of the family
there was too much faith reposed in
"John," and there is now weeping and
wailing in the home that was happy be
fore he departed. It is not at the Mon
golian's sudden leaving, however, that all
this sorrow la to be found at the Blake
man residence, but in John's going he
scooped up the entire stock of jewelry be
longing to the ladies of the family. Dia
mond rings of milky hue and clusters of
prismatic elegance, with gold watches,
bracelets, brooches and diamond pins, be
sides all the loose coin that was left with
in his reach, disappeared at the same
time that the dutiful servant bade the
family a silent adieu, which was on Sun
day afternoon.
The Mongolian had been left at home
while the family went out to see the boys
in blue at Camp Merritt, and on return
they found t li.it John had also gone out
mid with him all the valuables that he
could gather up. The upper office was In
formed of the Mongolian's flight, and the
venerable Chief sent for two of his best
thief catchers and put them on the case.
Immediately after tho hous* was visited
by Detectives Bee a::d Harper, who with
grief and sorrow heard the pitiful tales of
the lailies over their Losses, In order to
trap the Mongolian without any very
great amount of exertion on their part
they suggested that the back iCJte be
nailed from the inside and a regular or
dinary everyday policeman !n citizen's
clothes be placed on duty in Austin street
to watch for the Chinaman's return .lui
ing the night, when it was suppose! ! c
would return for his everyday working
duds. But John was too wary to be caught
with chaff; he failed to return, nnd as a
corwetruence the archives "f the upper of
t'n i arc onp notch short on thei" splendid
record of "Forty years' experience as a
thief-catching institution."
Chinatown is being carefully watched
by Detectives Gibson and Wren, win will
probably yank in the thieving domestic
ere long.

New parlors were organized as follows:
Vendome ', Parlor No. 100, Conrad Par
lor No. 101 and Alelia Parlor No. 102.
The membership has steadily increased.
During the year the grand president
visited fifty-seven of the sixty-seven
parlors. Sickness prevented her from
carrying out her original plan of visit
ing every parlor. The recommenda
tions of the report are:
Firstâ the grand officers have

Second â That a subordinate parlor in
the locality of the Grand Parlor be
held to exemplify the ritual.
Thirdâ That the past grand presi
dents and grand officers attending the
grand parlor be required to deposit
with the grand secretary, a receipt
showing they are in good standing on
July 1 succeeding the meeting of the
Grand Parlor. â .
Fourth â That there be a relief com
mittee in San Francisco, to consist of
three representatives of each parlor;
that it should be the duty of such re
lief committee to consider and refer all
cases of sickness or disability of sis
ters not members of San Francisco par
lors to said city in rotation, which in
any case referred are to take entire
charge of said case.
At the afternoon session a congrat
ulatory telegram from Grand President
Conley and Grand Secretary Lunstedt
of the Native Sons was read: The re
port of the grand secretary was sub
mitted, showing a healthy and prosper
ous condition. The membership is 2882.
AJta Parlor ranks first in membership.
The report of the grand treasurer
shows a balance of $3259 35 in the treas
ury. . .
The greater part of the afternoon
was devoted to patriotic service in
| honor of the anniversary of the adop-
I tion of the stars and stripes by Con
gress.
Addresses were delivered by Past
! Grand President Wittenmeyer, Miss
; Eliza D. Keith, Miss Lillie Richling,
i Mrs. Baker and others. Mrs. Carlie of
J San Francisco sang "The Flag That
I Stirs Our Souls," and also a song of her |
own composition, entitled, "Yes, "We
; Remember Thee." The service was con
cluded by the singing of the "Star
spangled Banner" by the Grand Par- |
| lor. Grand President Conrad, on behalf j
â of 'the Grand Parlor, in an eloquent
; speech, presented a flag to Past Presi
dent Bertola, who responded in a i
1 touching and pathetic speech.

THE DUTY OF MOTHERS.
Daughters Should be Carefully
Guided in Early Womanhood.
What suffering frequently results
from a mother ignorance; or more
frequently from a mother's neglect to
properly instruct her daughter!
Tradition says "woman must suffer,"
and young women are so taught.
There is a little truth and a great deal
of exaggeration in this. If a young
woman suffers severely she needs
treatment and her mother should see
that she gets it.
Many mothers hesitate to take their
daughters to a physician for examina-
tion; but no mother need hesitate to
write freely about her daughter or
herself to Mrs. Pinkham and secure
the most efficient advice without
charge. Mrs. Pinkham's address is
Lynn, Mass. â t . '.' > â 
The following letterfrom Miss Marie
F. Johnson, Centralia, Pa., shows what
neglect will do, and tells how Mrs.
Pinkham helped her :
"My health became so poor that I
had to leave school. I was tired all the
time, and had dreadful pains in my
side and back. I was also troubled
with irregularity of menses. I was
very weak, and lost so much flesh that
my friends became alarmed. My
mother, who is a firm believer in your
remedies from experience, thought per-
haps they might benefit me, and wrote
you for advice. I followed the advice
you gave, and used Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound and Liver Pills as
you directed, and am now as well as I
ever was. I have gained flesh and have
a good color. I am completely cured of
Irregularity."

D. APPLETON AND COMPANY'S
NEW BOOKS.
MR. PEMBERTON'S NEW ROMANCE,
Kronstadt.
A Novel. By MAX PEMBERTON. Illus-
trated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.
Mr. Pemberton has written a stirring
romance of love, adventure, and political
intrigue, and no reader who begins his
tale will be content to leave it unfinished.
The interior of the gloomy fortress of
Kronstadt, the Baltic, the Finnish Isl-
ands, and London, furnish the background
for swiftly moving scenes which â  are
tense with suspended interest, with the
power of love, and with the stress of
peril. Although a story of the present
day, the pulse of adventure and romance
throbs as strongly in these pages as in
a mediaeval tale.
Arachne. :
An Egyptian Romance. By Dr. GEORG-
EBERS, author of "Uarda," "Joshua,"
"An Egyptian Princess," etc. Uniform
edition. In two volumes. 16mo. Per
vol., cloth, 75 cents; paper, 40 cents.
In "Arachne" Dr. Ebers returns to the
Egyptian field in which he has gained
such wide popularity. The story opens In
274 B. C. The opening scenes are laid In
a little town near the Nile Delta, and
later the movement of the romance
transfers the reader to Alexandria.
Messrs. D. Applcton and Company are the.
publishers of the complete edition of Dr.
Ebers't works. .- â¢â  -

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June âThere was a dispo
sition in speculative circles to-day to await
the further â  progress of events after a series
of testings by the professional element. There
was evidently an expectation at the opening
that there might be renewed pressure of forced
liquidation on account of- the collapse In the
wheat deal. The bears were prepared for such
a development and sold with considerable con
fidence, bringing about declines of a point In
some cases.' No heavy offerings were encoun
tered at the 'decline, however, and prices had
come back about to the opening level before the
end of the first hour. Later in the day there
was renewed 1 selling: on quite a large scale,
.which was attributed to Chicago account and
this served to reawaken some apprehension
as to the extent of the damage done to the
financial fabric by the collapse In wheat. This
feverish tendency of prices unsettled the tone
or th>Â» speculation and resulted In a rather
dull .market for the rest of the day. The
strength of. Manhattan and the firmness of
â Sugar and Tobacco on the later dealings help
ed to sustain the market. There is pome anx
iety, in the street to ilnd how the subscriptions
to the new Government loan will progress. it
is . considered probable that money will be
come dearer, though no actual stringency Is
looked for by any competent observer. The new
revenue law in force to-day has one or two
features whose effect on the stock market
values Is a matter for consideration.
Prices of bonds yielded in sympathy with
stocks, but losses were less and there was no
pressure to liquidate. Total sales, $1,840,000

The Seligmane announce the details of the
United States Government loan, and that they
are prepared to remit subscriptions from here.
It is understood that the Brazilian funding

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 14.â The flurry yesterday
seemed to have cleared the atmosphere on the
Board of Trade and to-day there was nothing
to remind one of the disturbance but the
lower prices. The Letter deal was generally
considered to be dead and burled, so far as the
trading in deferred futures was concerned, but
the obsequies of the cash end of that remarka
ble speculation were still to . be perfected.
Wheat started not far from the closing prices
of the day before for the bulk of the transac
tions, although a few sales were made at %c
Improvement in September and December de
liveries. Weakness very soon developed, how
ever, and July sold down 3 cents and Septem
ber and December about l%c each during tho
half hour's trading. It became rumored dur
ing the forenoon that besides buying from Lei
ter all the June wheat the latter had com
ing to him. Armour had bought all the cash
wheat held by the young speculator in Mm(
( nesota and Duluth. That gave a little firmer
tone to the proceedings In the pit. The gather-
Ing strength was increased when the rumor
referred to received the substantial confirma
tion of the President of the Illinois Trust and
Savings Bank. To complete the bullish com
bination the .weather was still 1 wet in Texas
where about half of the wh^-it Is in snock
and It rained heavily in Ka. ..as and other
Western States. where wheat cutting had
commenced. Liverpool contributed a further
item of bullishness by cabling that the wheat
throughout \ the East Central Russia was
threatened with total failure from drouth and
that the worst was probable unless rain re
lieved the situation within a week. The Liv
erpool quotations, however, were anything but
bullish, giving clear indications of the aban
donment of a threatened July corner in that
market. July wheat there was Is 3d per cental
or the equivalent of - ISc a bushel lower this
morning than it closed yesterday, but Sep-
I tember was only the equivalent of l%c a bush
el and December %c lower. July at Liverpool
had recovered about 6c per bushel of its early
loss before the close. July closed with a loss
of l%c and September %c lower. "
The continued showery wonthor and the more
settled feeling In the wheat pit created a firm
tone In corn. July closed unchanged â 
. After a weak start; oats firmed up on' re
ports of wet weather. Prices at one tin show
ed a slight advance. The close was unchanci'd
from yesterday. . ;:-, . ?^.

Wool still shows rather mora steadiness. A
local circular says: "Reports from the East
all generally more encouraging, and while thla
has not had its immediate effect in Increasing
the sales locally, nevertheless there Is a better
feeling and holders look forward to a good
market shortly. There is a feeling locally that
prices will be well sustained, and there is no
disposition at present to shade prices in order
to effect sales."

LEATHERâ The circular of W. B. Sumner &
Co. says: "During the past season Leather has
been growing firmer, with advancing rates.
For several years harness was neglected until
but little stock was on hand, either manu
factured or cut up. In consequence a sudden
demand sprang up, aided materially by the
Government requisitions, and to-day harness
Leather Is ruling at the prices of several years
ago, and with liberal sales, at full values.
Sole Leather is relatively lower, but much of
the stock which was put into sole Is now go-
Ing Into harness Leather. The finished product
Is being sold in the North and West,' as the
dry season in California . has prevented any
thing but the smallest trade In the interior
towns of this State. It seems as though this
active trade will be sustained and harness
Leather rule at high figures for some time.

Building Contracts, Recent
Sales and Realty
Notes.
The real estate market for the past

Jarge and unusual sales and tra-isfers
was. nevertheless, marked by a steady
and active progression. The "number of.
building contracts was largely in advance
or the previous records of the entire
month, hoth for the country and the
city, but more especially for the latter.
Bales, although small were numerous, and
hardly a realty firm of the entire city
passed through the week without record
ing at least a dozen. The value of these
transfers ranged from Â£00 to $15,000, and
were made in nearly every section of the
city.
The number of mortgages and trust
deeds was also in a perceptible minority,
the only one of mure than passing promi
nence being for $78,000, from Charles
Mayne, in the interests of Ellen M.
Mowry.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15, 1898.
MADRID PRESS
URGES PEACE
Sentiment of Leading
Newspapers.
PUBLIC OPINION CHANGING
YET THE MASSES ARE GAINING
COURAGE.
They Are Led to Believe That
the Americans Are Beginning
to Encounter Serious
Difficulties.
Copyrighted, 18DS. by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, June 14.â Instead of the
general feeling here being pessimistic
! It is that the Americans are only be
; ginning to feel the pinch of the shoe
which, the further she goes, will hurt
â  her the more.
That three papers â the Pals, the Na
cional and the Vida Nueva â take as
' texts for the feature of the day the
question of peace Is significant as
showing that public sentiment is being
rapidly molded to accept the inevita
ble. The Pais Is rabidly republican
and all along violently jingo. The Vida
Nueva is a new paper, born upon the
present condition of affairs. Its pro
gramme is to renovate Spain; it is the
voice of young Spain. At the end of
an impassioned patriotic article, it
says:
"Peace is what our country needs to
day. All men of character and strength
should support it, thus putting an end
to the terrible suffering of this unfort
unate country."
The Herald agent is pilloried in the
Correo, which says that not only from
Gibraltar but now from Lisbon the
Herald's correspondents send news of
the Spanish ships and their arma
ments. It reproduces Lisbon telegrams
to the Herald.
The Bourse was buoyant to-day and
up one point on rumors of interven
tion of the powers and a reported Span
ish victory at Santiago. The Govern
ment holds no confirmation of such ru
mors.
In connection with the prospects of
peace a long consultation between j
Senors Moret and Sagasta to-day is j
commented upon. Private telegrams j
tell of a conference at Manila between !
the German Consul and Governor j
Augusti.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs,
Duke Almodovar de Rio. told the news
paper men to-day that the Spanish
Government had not taken any step in
the direction of peace negotiations. The
Minister said he had not received any
confirmation of the reported third at
tack on Santiago.
The Minister of War, General Correa,
declared the situation at Manila better
than was supposed. He said Captain
General Augusti had concentrated 20,
000 men for the defense of the city and
his batteries of artillery were asserted
to comprise 199 long-range guns.
It was officially announced to-day
that Senor Dubosc, the former Spanish
Charge d'Aftaires at Washington, and
Lieutenant Carranza, the former Span
ish naval attache at Washington, have
been "invited" to leave Canada, owing
to the "Canada authorities having in
tercepted a letter which Lieutenant
Carranza addressed to the Minister of
Marine, giving an account of the con
dition of the American fortifications."
The optimism of the press is increased
by a belief that Germany intends to
prevent a bombardment of Manila by
making a naval demonstration. The
newspapers urge sacrifices, with the
view of securing Germany's assistance
and political leaders express themselves
in favor of offering Germany the fol
lowing concessions in return for her
"taking the Initiative in forcing Ameri-
i ca - ."
Firstlyâ Naval stations and coaling
I depots in Spanish Oceanica.
Secondlyâ Spanish concurrence in the
1 development of Germany's commercial
relations with Morocco.
BERLIN. June 14.â Advices received
from Shanghai by the Frankfort Zei
â  tung say news has been received there
from Manila to the effect that there Is
fighting every night around the town.
The insurgents, it seems, are trying to
capture Manila and to establish an in
: dependent government before the
Americans land.
The German Consul at Manila, it is
further reported, has 300 Germans and !
Swiss on board a refugee steamer in
the harbor.
VIENNA, June 14.â The Neve Preie
' Presse says that Spain has requested
! the powers to urge the United States
to occupy Manila, should the town sur
; render, and not to allow the insurgents
I to do so.
YOUTHS' DIRECTORY.
Committee of Arrangements for the
Laying of the Cornerstone
at Work.
The committee having in charge the ar
rangements for the laying of the corner
stone of the Youths' Directory at the cor
ner of Eighteenth and Guerrero streets on
July 17 met at the home of the society
at 2030 Howard street last night to per
fect the arrangements for the occasion^
There were present: Chairman James R.
Kelly, Secretary David J. Costello. Dr.
John" Gallagher representing the sodality,
the Rev. Fathers Crowley and Melville
with delegations from the various Irish
societies who will participate in the lay-
Ing of the corner stone.
The formation of the committees was
partly perfected at the meeting last night.
On the reception committee George E.
Gallagher was made chairman with power
to add to the number requisite to give the
committee a working power; on trie com
mittee on music, Joseph Sullivan was
made chairman; on the committee on in
vitations, General P. F. Walsh was made
the chairman. By unanimous consent T.
R. Bannerman was elected marshal of the
day with power to increase the number
of "his aids to suit the occasion. Eugene
Hanna will have charge of the grounds
and see that the Invited guests are prop
erly attended to. It is estimated that the
procession will number over 60W and to
supply this body with appropriate music
it waj thought that at least three bands
would be necessary, which will be sup
plied.
Side Arms Barred.
An ortfer was issued at Camp Merritt
yesterday prohibiting privates from car
rying their side arms except when on
duty. Anticipating this order, the offi
cers of the different regiments have de
cided to have the tents of their mon
searched for pocket guns and other wea
pons that the men are known to carry.
It is a notorious fact that evry gun shop
in this city has been utterly depleted of
small arms.
First California Recruits.
The blanks necessary for the enrollment
of the additional 300 recruits for the First

been received at the oTlce of Adjutant.
eGr.cral Barrett. The recruits have all

mustering officer, will begi/ mustering

AN UPROAR IN
THE DEPUTIES
Meline Ministry Meets
With Defeat.
THE FRENCH PREMIER AT BAY.
HOOTED AND TAUNTED BY THE
OPPOSITION.
Adoption of a Qualified Vote of Con
fidence Will Probably Cause the
Resignation of the
Cabinet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, June 14.-~The Meline Minis
try was defeated In the Chamber of
Deputies by 296 to 246 votes, amid in
tense excitement and an uproar. The
House was crowded, as were the pub
lic galleries.
The Premier, M. Meline, opened the
proceedings by vehemently repudiating
the statement that he was engaged in
an anti-democratic policy, but he de
clared that the accession of Socialists
to power would spell ruin for France.
Ex-Minister Bourgeois followed,
taunting M. Meline with being unwill
ing to cut himself free from the Right
ists, and several Extreme Leftists con
tinued their severe strictures of the
Premier's "undemocratic policy."
M. Ribot then delivered a warm
eulogy of the Premier and proposed a
vote of confidence in the Government,
but its terms elicited loud protests from
the Rightists, amid general excitement.
M. Meline, however, accepted the
terms of the motion, whereupon M.
Cassaignac charged him with throwing
over the Rightists.
The Premier retorted that he had
| never asked for the support of the
i Rightists.
The first part of M. Ribot's motionâ
"the chamber approving the declara
tion of the Government"â was then
adopted by a vote of 289 to 272. The
second part â "is determined to put in
force the policy of democratic reform
based on the union of republicans" â â¢
was adopted by 525 to 5 votes.
Thus far matters went comparative
ly smoothly. Then M. Henri Ricardo
moved to add the words, "and support
ed by a majority exclusively repub
lican."
M. Meline refused to accept this ad
dition. M. Ricardo insisted upon a
vote, and the addition was carried by
256 to 246, whereupon there was a ter
rible uproar.
The members of the extreme left
arose en masse and shouted for the re
tirement of M. Meline.
M. Berteaux yelled: "Get out; you
are defeated." Others, pointing to the
Ministerial bench, indulged in a chorus
of "boohs." The socialists vociferated,
"Resign, resign."
When a lull occurred another vote
was taken on the entire motion, which
M. Meline accepted, swallowing the ob
noxious addition, and the motion was
adopted by 254 to 272 votes. The Cham
ber of Deputies then adjourned until
Monday.
In the lobbies of the chamber the
opinion was freely expressed that M.
Meline would resign after the council
to-morrow, though nothing is certain,
owing to the contradictory character of
the votes.
DEADLY FIRE OF
THE AMERICAN FORCE.
Twenty-five Spaniards Slain in the
Second Fight at Guan
tanamo.
ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT WANDA,
! OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 13,
via Kingston, Jamaica, June 14. â Dur
ing the second night attack by the
Spanish, which ended at daybreak, the
marine held their grourfd against des
j perate odds, and the bodies of twenty
| five Spaniards, including a lieutenant,
were discovered, which shows how
deadly was the American defense.
Every man in Admiral Sampson's
fleet is anxiously awaiting the soldiers,
for it is recognized that no decisive
movement is possible until the troops
effect a landing. At no place are the
troop shlpsjnore anxiously watched for
than on the sun-blistered hill top where
Lieutenant-Colonel Huntington's 600
marines lie in rifle pits, under almost
continuous hail of Spanish bullets.
Forty-eight hours of practically cease
less fighting has well nigh wrecked the
men, who arrived here incapacitated
for active field duty by the long wait
on the Panther.
With few exceptions, however, the
marines showed spirit under the per
sistent fire of the Spanish bushwhack
ers, the officers particularly exhibiting
the coolness and nerve of seasoned
campaigners.
To-day the work has been the light
est since the landing on Friday, the
Spaniards having fired few shots since
daybreak. Whether the enemy has
been driven back to the city fortlf.na
tions, or has merely retired for the day,
cannot be told until the darkness has
arrived.
A grim touch of realism was added to
the warlike scenes when the flags on
land and on the warships were placed
at half-mast at noon to-day and gal
lant Sergeant Major Goode was buried
on the hillside, scarcely twenty paces
from the spot where he fell last night.
The burial services were impressive, as
the men felt that their situation was
desperate and openly said they ex
pected to be gradually slaughtered until
the arrival of the troops.
The men freely criticize a policy
which compels them to hold a position
that could be retaken, they say, by a
half hour's shelling, but not the faint
est disposition is manifested to do
otherwise than to fight It out.
The Dolphin arrived late last night
and spent the greater part of the fore
noon in pitching shells into the Span
ish blockhouse believed to be the ren
dezvous of the Spaniards on a hill a
mile and a half east of the American
position. What damage was done it is
impossible to learn.

THE GREGORYS ARE
FREED FROM BLAME
DISCHARGED FROM CUSTODY
BY JUDGE MORRIS.
The District Attorney Did Not Think
They Should Ba Heldâ A Clear
Case of Self-Defense.
ALAMEDA, June 14.â 1t was apparent
from the statements of the District At
torney in summing up the Gregory case
yesterday that there was no likelihood of
the defendants being held for trial for the
killing of Williams. He said then that
there was little use in putting the county
to the expense of a trial whose conclu
sion was practically foregone.
Acting upon this statement and upon
his own conclusions from the evidence
presented, Justice Morris this afternoon
discharged both defendants from custody
and they are now free from all legal
blame for the death of Williams.
As soon as they could get away from
the crowd the couple went together to the
home of the wife on Eagle avenue, where
the tragedy occurred. It is considered
probable that they will resume their mar
ital relations with each other. All through
the trial there has been marked evidence
of affection between them, and when Mrs.
Gregory broke down her ex-husband
showed her every attention and endear
ment possible under the circumstances.
The result of the examination meets
with the approval of public sentiment
here. Williams invaded the Gregory
home and broke it up. and then sought to
still further force his attentions upon
Mrs. Gregory. That he should have met
his death was only to have been expected.
The fable that Williams was an English
baronet Is exploded by the fact that the
"Peeragi" does not give the name of any
such person as entitled to a baronetcy.
There was once a Sir Hugh "Williams, but

Phrenology and Character Beading.
- Barefooted and dressed in a most gaudy
and picturesque costume Professor Wil
liam Windsor, the phrenologist and por
trayer of human character, made his sec
ond appearance on the platform at Met
ropolitan Temple last night. ; The hall
was weir- filled and the audience listened
attentively to the speaker's theories on
character building and hints on health of
mind and body. â¢ He claims the ability to
place each man in his proper business,
and argues that all the failures in life
are due not to lack of ability, but to the ;
fact that the man Is misplacedâ is wast
ing time and energy as a poor physician
when he might Instead make*a successful
speaker or engineer, or vice versa. Two
subjects were selected by the audience
and the professor gave a. very satisfac
tory demonstration of his skill.

ASKS THREE
MILLIONS FOR
THE PLANT
Los Angeles Water Corpo
ration's Proposal to
the City.
Contested Crystal Springs Rights
Rated at One-Third of the
Total Valuation.
LOS ANGELES, June 14.â When it I
was predicted by The Call correspond
ent almost six months ago that the j
Los Angeles City Water Company j
would demand $3, 000,000 for its plant
from the city that prophecy was made
advisedly. That is what the company :
by its attorneys asked to-day, although
the offer came in the shape of two j
propositions, made at a joint meeting ;
of the directors of the water company |
and the members of the City Council. :
One was to sell to the city all of the â 
corporation's improvements to the city's
plant within the city limits for $2,000,- !
000. The second was a proposal to sell ;
the property owned by the Crystal
Springs Company, which is a corpora
tion auxiliary to the City Water Com- |
pany, all of its water rights and prop- |
erty for $1,000,000 additional.
The main feature of the holdings of \
the Crystal Springs Water Company
Is a contested water right. The city !
claims the Crystal Springs water rights
are invalid and of no value, as the
water claimed by the Crystal Springs I
Company is simply percolating water :
of the river, all of which belongs to the !
city. One million dollars is the amount !
really asked for the contested water ;
rights.
The proposition of the water company
was not at all favorably received by the
Council. An inventory of the property
owned and alleged to be owned was ;
supplied. After hearing it read the ;
Council ordered the water supply com- ,
mittee and the City Engineer to check
up the inventory with the estimate of
value previously made by the City En
gineer, and ascertain how far apart the
City Engineer's value of the company's
property and the valuation of the cor
poration itself are. Another meeting is
to be held on Friday next.
Mayor M. P. Snyder was not at all
satisfied with the meeting held to-day.
He was an interested spectator and
participated in the conference. The ;
previous estimate of the City Engineer
was that the property which the city
desired to and should purchase of the
water company was worth approxi
mately $1,200,000, but that did not in
clude any allowance for the allecrf-d
Crystal Springs water right upon
which the company has placed the j
liberal valuation of $1,000,000.
As to this right, Superior Judge Yorke
has not yet rendered his decision. The j
case has been tri^d before him and |
submitted. An opinion is now awaited, j
One thing is certain: The people of i
Los Angeles will not vote $3,000,000 in |
bonds to buy out the present company.
If it should be done an immediate ex- i
penditure of $500,000 would have to be j
made to put the plant into shape.
When the conference was called to |
order this morning it was found all \
principals were promptly on hand, j
Judge J. S. Chapman was the legal j
advisor of the corporation and City At- i
PILING U P THE
SINEWS OF WAR
Collector Lynch Up to
His Ears in Business.
RECEIPTS FOR THE DAY.
LARGEST KNOWN IN THE HIS
TORY OF THE OFFICE.
Tobacco Men and Brewers Making
Inventories of the Stock on
Hand and Large Dis
counts Offered.
Collector Lynch and all of his force were
up to their ears in business yesterday is
euing circulars to the makers and sellers
of tobacco and malt liquors Informing
them' as to the details of the new war
revenue bill and the taxes which they or
rather the consumers will have to pay in
order to continue the war against Spain
and to pay the war bills already incurred
by the Government.
The law requires all" tobacconists â¢to
make an inventory of all their stock on
hand stamped and ready for sale yester
day, the day on which the new revenue
tax bill went into effect. All stocks under
20,000 cigars or cigarettes and under 1000
pounds of tobacco are exempt from the
new tax. Hence the necessity for the in
ventory. â¢â â -â¢
Manufacturers of beer and other malt
liquors may buy the new stamps in any
quantity, whether needed for immediate
consumption or not, and they will be al
lowed a discount of 7% per cent.
The following circular was Issued for
the information of the brewers:
You will require every brewer on his return,
form 18, for June, to account separately for the
number and kind of stamps purchased, and the
number and kind of stamps used by him dur
ing the portion or the month before and in
cluding the day of the passage of the act In
creasing the tax; and to account separately
tor the number and kind of stamps purchased,
and the number and kind of stamps used by
him during, the portion of the month after the
passage of the act; and to show the number
.and 'kind- of stamps -returned by htm and ex
changed for stamps at the .. Increased rate.
Also to show separately the, quantity of liquor
removed from ' the ' premises ' before, and after
the passage of the act. V
Attention Is celled to the fact that the in
crease In the rate of tax will probably necessi
tate the giving of new bonds by all brewers,
as the amount :of tax. which. in the opinion
of the Collector, the brewer will :be Ilablo . to
pay during .any one month. You , will ; please
soe ' that new , bonds In sufficient amounts â  are
given in all cases where the present bond Is too
email to satisfy the requirements of the law in
this respect.
The receipts of the office yesterday were
$26,900, about $20,000 in excess iof the ordi
nary, daily receipts of the office. \-. This in
crease in receipts -will not' be permanent
because the payments made yesterday
represent amounts due on stock held back
' torney W. E. Dunn acted for the city.
' In opening the meeting President Her
: man Silver of the City Council said:
"Gentlemen of the Council, we meet
with the representatives of Los An
geles City Water Company to discuss
! the question of what improvements the
water company claims the city should
take over under the contract made be
> tween this city and the water company
on July 22, 1868, which expires on the22d
| of next month; also to determine the
; price demanded for such improvements
as have been made by the company
i from time to time, on the original plant
; leased to the company by the city. We
[ shall be glad to hear from the repre
sentatives of the water company."
Judge Chapman, on behalf of the
water company, responded:
"We have endeavored in our report,
] made to the Council, to outline what
i properties of the water company we
claim the city should purchase under
the contract. This schedule of prop
erty is complete and accurate in its de
scription. Now, while the company
has fully outlined what property it
holds as falling within the terms of
the contract, I have never yet heard the
city's interpretation 86 to what it
claims comes under the headof improve
ments, which the city must purchase
undor the contract.
"We come prepared to name a price
for all the properties owned and con
trolled by the Los Angeles City Water
Company, or for the portion of those
properties which we maintain must be
paid for under the contract. We con
cede that the city is not bound to take
the Crystal Springs Company property,
but we do claim that the city will find
it absolutely necessary to own such a
system of additional supply in order to
adequately furnish the needs of this
city. There is no necessity for referring
to the growth of Los Angeles. It is too
conspicuous to need reference, but that
very growth makes all the more evi
dent the value of properties such as the
reservoir sites not now used by the
water company. We are prepared to
talk over all these matters with you
and to reach a final determination at
the earliest practical moment, so that
the city may proceed to the Issuance
of bonds for the payment upon such
properties as it is agreed shall be pur
chased under the contract." #
City Attorney Dunn at this juncture
announced that the City Council was
prepared to hear the price the water
company had fixed upon its property.
Then it was that Judge Chapman made
the two propositions outlined hereto
fore. The Judge explained that all of
the stock of the City Water Company
had been placed in the hands of trus
tees preparatory for any transaction
tending to the purchase thereof.
The Council will continue to hold ex
tra meetings continuously until some
thing is done, but what that some
thing -will be no one can foretell. The
municipal ownership problem seems to
be as complicated as it ever was.
while awaiting the action of Congress on
the bill.
AN OAKLAND SENSATION.
Charges of Perjujy and Libel Filed
Here Arising Out of Annie
Johnson's Death.
The statements in the answer filed by
Mrs. Gertrude K. Jones in the Superior
Court. Oakland, last Wednesday to the
suit brought by Attorney George H.
Franeoeur against her and her husband
for the recovery of $500 due on a promis
sory note have stirrod up a hornet's nest.
Yesterday afternoon Francoeur ap
peared before Judge Mogan and swore to
a complaint charging Mrs. Jones with
perjury in swearing to statements in the
answer. The allegations that are de
clared to be false are principally in con
nection with a conspiracy between Fran
coeur, Jones and Attorney Henry N. He
atty to get "hush money" from Mrs.
Jones regarding the death of Annie John
son in January, 1897.
Attorney Beatty also swore to a com
plaint for the arrest of Joseph Hutchin-
Bon, the attorney for Mrs. Jonos in her
suit for divorce against her husband, on
the charge of libel. In her affidavit Mrs.
Jont-s repeated the allegations in regard
to the betrayal and subsequent death by
a criminal operation of Annie Johnson
and the attempt to get "hush money"
from her. In the complaint it is alleged
that Hutchinson drew up the complaint
for divorce and the affidavit knowing that
the statements therein were false and
malicious.
Hutchinson was arrested yesterday aft
ernoon and released on $sr*o bonds.
MARRIED AT
MILL VALLEY
A Lineal Descendant of
George Washington
Weds Miss Bacon.
The wedding of Miss Alice Bacon and
Francis Bedinger Washington took a
large number of people from San Fran
cisco to Mill Valley yesterday. Miss Ba
con is so well known in the musical world
that the event was of unusual interest.
The ceremony was performed at high
noon in the Congregational Church in
the valley by the Rev. Horatio Stebbins.
The quaint little edilice was bright with
red and white flowers, relieved by palms
ancj ferns and pungent thlnga from the
woods.
The bride who is a tall, stately brun
ette, looked queenly in a whtto satin
striped gown and large white picture hat.
Mips .Catherine Sc-lfridge, the maid of
honor, was gowned in white swiss, as
wore the bridesmaids, Miss Florence
Sharon, Miss Lucie Brown, Miss Merle
Morrison and Miss Edith Allen. They all
wore large leghorn pokes, trimmed with
white chiffon and ostrich feathers
John Washington Twiggs acted as best
man. At the conclusion of the ceremony
a stringed orchestra rendered with mar
velous effect an aria of Bach's, after
which a delightful luncheon was served
at the hotel.*
Mr Washington is assistant cashier in
the Mint and is highly connected, being a
lineal descendant of the "Father of his
country." He has built for his bride a
charming little nest in the redwoods in
the protecting shadow of Mount Tanial
pais, and in this cozy home the couple
will spend their honeymoon.

TO AID THEIR
ALMA MATER
Plan of the Lowell High
School Alumni.
AFTER A NEW BUILDING.
CALL FOR GRADUATES TO AID
THE INSTITUTION.
The Board of Education Will Be
Asked to Provide for a Suitable
Structure of Brick and
Stone.
An effort is being made by the alumni
of the Lowell High School, or the Boys'
High School, as it was known for so
long, to have erected a suitable build
ing for the old school, and one that will
make it compare more favorably with
the buildings erected for the other high
schools of the city.
A petition is being circulated for sig
natures and it will be presented to the
board at the first meeting after the
schools close. The petition is as fol
lows:
To the Honorable Board of Education and
the Honorable Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of ban Francisco: We, the
undersigned residents and citizens of San
Francisco, taxpayers and. for the most, pa
trons of the Lowell High School, and we, the
alumni of the school, interested In the cause
of public education, and desirous of teeing the
welfare of our schools promoted in every pos
sible way, do respectfully present to your hon
orable boards the following petition:
I. To the Honorable Board of Education:
We would respectfully present that the build
ing on Sutter street, between Gough and Oc
tavia, now occupied by the Lowell High School,
built in 1875, is no longer adequate to the needs
of that school in either size, plan or accommo
dation; and we request you to forward this
petition with your approval to the Honorable
Board of .Supervisors at as early a date as
possible, together with whatever further state
ment of facts may seem to you necessary.
11. To the Honorable Board of Supervisors:
Tour petitioners, the undersigned, In behalf
of the Interests of our schools, respectfully
present the following facts:
1. That the building now occupied by the
Lowell High School, as indicated above, is no
longer adequate to the needs of that school.
This Inadequacy is specifically shown In the
overcrowded condition of rooms, the lack of
proper laboratories and study-rooms and the
entire lack of an assembly-room.
2. That the school lot on which this build- |
ing stands <a fifty vara) is too small for the ]
construction of any further accommodation, or |
for any building of sufficient size to meet the !
needs of this school.
3. That the city and county of San Fran
cisco ia the owner and possessor of a half
bli ck of land on the north side of Sacramento '
street, between Gough and Octavla, and that
tliis half-Mock can be most advantageously de
voted to use as a school site for the Lowell i
High School.
4. That the premises now occupied by the !
Lowell High School are sufficient, and, with
slight repairs, would be satisfactory for a
primary or grammar school, and that such ac- j
commoilatlons are now very much needed In
that locality.
5. That since the Lowell High School Is es
tablished in the midst of a well-settled and
populous portion of the city, and is surrounded
on all sides by long-established and well-at- [
tended elementary schools*, at least twenty-two j
In number, which must always continue to re- i
quire a high school in that locality, a perma- 1
nent building upon pome site in the vicinity of ;
the one suggested is a necessity.
â Wherefore. In consideration of the above !
facts, we respectfully petition your honorable j
board :
I. To set aside the half-block of land on the â¢
n> rth side of Sacramento street, between Gough i
and Octavia. for a school site for the use of !
the Lowell High School.
IT. To place the sum of $2(V\oflo In the annual
tax levy for the fiscal year of ISSS-99 as a spe
cific appropriation for the construction of a
gubctanUaJ ars.l commodious brick building for
the Lowell High School and for furnishing the
same.
The alumni will go further than
merely ask for an appropriation, how
ever; they will help to raise the money,
and to that end there Is a plan under
discussion by which each alumnus may
donate $1 to a building fund which will
be used in conjunction with any money
the department may secure.
The present building was erected in
1875. It is out of date and the rooms
are all small and crowded. It cost
originally $37,590, and there have been
two additions built at a cost of $9,108 55.
There are at present nearly four hun
dred and fifty scholars and the grad
uating classes will average nearly sixty
since the school was established in 1564.
This year's class numbers ninety grad
uates.
A BUGLER BOY
SAVED FROM WAR.
JAMES PRESNALL RELEASED
ON HABEAS CORPUS.
The Boy Wanted to Go to Manila, but
His Father Prefers to Make a
Lawyer of Him.
James M. Presnall Is an 18-year-old
American who became inspired by patri
otism and enlisted In Denver In the First
Regiment of Colorado Volunteers and
pitched his tent at Camp Merritt in this
city. His father, James W. Presnall, is
not as recklessly patriotic as his son, for
he sought the return of his boy to his
home under a writ of habeas corpus is
sued by Judge de Haven yesterday. The
order commanded Captain Smith Rucker
of Company E of the regiment mentioned
to produce the boy in court.
The boy's father appeared In court in
the afternoon, having come all the way
from Denver to snatch his child as a
brand from the burning of horrid war.
The boy was there, too â a slender, bright
looking youthâ with a nickel plated buglo
under his arm. He was a bugler, and he
was sad, not because of the softening and
refining influence of music, but because
he had set his heart on going to Manila
and witnessing the raising of the stars
and stripes over the lovely isles of the
Philippines.
Mr. Presnall had no difficulty In prov
ing that his son was under the lagal age.
The father showed also that the xioy had
granulated eyelids and his sight would
be permanently Impaired should he re
main in the tropics for any length of time.
He said that he intended to put his son
to school In this city and mako a lawyer
of him.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Anna M. Meyer has sued William Mey
er for a divorce, alleging intemperance as
a cause of action. Delia Lang has ap
plied for a divorce from E. M. Lang on
the ground of extreme cruelty. Suits for
divorce on the ground of failure to pro
vide were filed by Mamie Cunha against
Antone Q. Cunha; Lizzie Sater against
George W. Sater, and Mary Fuller
against Frederick Fuller.

The weapon with which these men have

that will prevent and cure consumption
Taken in time, it will always ward off this
deadly disease, and even after the devastat-

â¢makes the appetite keen and hearty. It is
the great blood-maker, flesh â  builder and

THEY ARE SCHOOLGIRLS NO LONGER.
The Graduating Class of the Girls' High School Closes Its
Studies With a " High Jinks,"
Nlnety-three girls, the graduating class of the Girls' High School, broke Into revelry yesterday afternoon. All
schoolroom rules and the discipline of the teachers were thrown aside and the festivities were classed as "high jinks."
The rule of the school was turned upside down. Principal Brooks was made to toe the mark and his assistant
teachers were drawn up in line and asked many pointed questions. All the wit and humor of the school was let
loose and the teachers joined with the pupils In the jollification. Miss Alice Jobson was the president of the com
mittee that arranged the "Jinks" and she was assisted by Mlsa Mercie Pacheco, Miss Annie Bennett, Miss Laura
Denson, Mi?-s Blanche DuÃols and Miss Hermione Lask. The ecnool was dismissed for the afternoon and the
whole bulMing was turned over to the Jolly graduates. A programme full of surprises and cleverly carried out
furnished the atnusi-iriiMit for the occasion. The opening address, by Miss Jobson, was full of pleasant witticisms
aimed at both the teachers and pupils. Then the teachers were called into the room as though they were pupils
and asked some questions that almost exhausted their wits to answer. Their Interrogators were Miss Emma Wehrle,
Miss Laura Denson, Miss Sadie Gaffney and Miss Viola Kleinberg. The valedictory address was given by Miss
Elsie Wenzelburger, after which there began a pilgrimage through the different class rooms, In each of which a
farewell address was given. Those who made tho addresses were Miss Rebecca Hoss, Miss Beatrix Cooley, Miss
Camilla Meyer, Miss Lulu Becker and Miss Myrtle Rose. Vocal solos were gllven by Miss Hermlone Lask, Misn
Florence Hawlty and Miss Elsie > Priber. There was a piano solo by Miss Idabel Long and a violin solo by Miss
Fannie Jacobs. The hit of the 'programme was made by Miss Myna Hepburn who, in a burnt-cork makeup,
rendered several "coon" songs in a manner that would do credit to many of the professional soubrettes. Miss Mer
cle Pacheco and Miss Shirley Hay;s as fortune tellers caused much amusement by predicting the futures of their
classmates.
On Thursday evening the graduating exercises of the class will be held In the assembly-room of the school.
the Democratic party of San Fran
cisco will have none of the hand-made
pacitiers assumes the proportions of a
moral certainty.
Last night's meeting demonstrated
the weakness of the new organization
to the entire satisfaction of those who
are shrewd enough to read between th>=
lines. The committee has been in ex
istence for more than two weeks and
has held two meetings, yet it has nut
yet completed its organization and has
taken no steps toward the very neces
sary work of directing the organiza
tion of the party preliminary to th^
campaign that is already begun. The
committee is in the position of the
commander-in-chief of a mutinous
army. He is afraid to issue orders be
cause he knows they will not be obeyed,
and because he knows that the mere
fact of disobedience would lay bare his
weakness.
In the meantime something must be
done to keep up the appearance of
strength, and this was the Intent of
last night's proceedings. After call-
Ing the meeting to order Chairman
Dunn announced that he was ready to
name the various committees called for
at the meeting held last Friday night,
with a single exception. This excep
tion was the committee on district or
ganization, the most important of all
of the subcommittees. Dunn said that
h(- had not had time to give the matter
the consideration it deserved, but that
if the appointment of the committee
was Insisted upon he was prepared to
â¢Bv^RRY BALOW/N

ME* IBER â¢ . â¢
name its members. He thought, how
ever, that it would be wise to postpone
the matter until the next meeting in
order that so important a matter might
be given the consideration it deserved.
Barry Baldwin moved that the chair
man be given further time in which to
appoint this particular committee and
the motion carried without a dissent-
Ing voice.
The other committees named were as
follows:

mittees the so-called governing body of

DEAQGED OFF TO PRISON.
Mrs. Carleton, a Married Woman,
Arrested While Going to a
Bakery for Bread.
Mrs. Carleton, 153 Minna street, was ar
rested Monday night by Policemen G. P.
Chase and L. J. Deeley and taken to the
City Prison, but was released later by
Judge Mognn. She appeared before
Judge Low yesterday morning and after
hearing the testimony of the arresting
officer he at once convicted her and sen
tenced hor to pay a fine of $5 or spend
twenty-four hours in the prison. She was
not represented by counsel.
Mrs. Carleton is forty-three years of
age and has been the mother of eight
children, four of whom live with her. Her
husband is a ship's carpenter and is at
present out of the city. She and her fam
ily came here from Visalia about four
weeks ago.
Mrs. Carleton said she left her house
between 9 and 10 o'clock to go to a bak
er's store on Mission street for broad.
She met a man in plain clothes who
questioned her as to where she was go
ing and where she lived. She answered
him and went to the baker's, followed by
the man, who continued to shadow her
till she reached her home. Just as she
was opening jthe door he called her to
stop, and seizing her roughly by the wrist
displayed a star and told her she was un
der arrest.
Her daughter Myrtle was sick in bed,
but hearing the noise at the door got up
and inquired what the men wanted with '
her mother. By this time the arresting \
officer, who -was Chase, had been joined i
by Deeley and the young girl for an an- !
swer to her question was struck in the j
breast, and fell. Mrs. Carleton's brother- i
in-law also appeared on the scene, but
was treated with scant courtesy.
Mrs. Carleton intends to bring the con
duct of the two officers before the Police
Commissioners. She declares she Is a
respectable married woman and feels
keenly the Indignity thrust upon her.
GIVES JUDGMENT IN
FAVOR OF THE CITY
THE FIDELITY AND DEPOSIT
COMPANY LOSES.
It Must Pay the Amount of Its Lia
bility Upon the Bond of Widber,
the Defaulting Treasurer.
Judge Belcher yesterday rendered a de
cision in favor of the city and county in
the action Instituted against the Fidelity
and Deposit Company of Maryland to re
cover $100,000, the amount of the liability
of the surety company upon the bond of
Augustus C. Widber, the defaulting City
Treasurer. Despite the fact that all the
money in the treasury had not been
counted as the law directed, the court
held that the company was responsible
for the full amount of the bond.
During the trial of the case the defend
ant corporation sought to establish the
fact that the city and county was in some
extent responsible for the large defalca
tion by reason that the funds had not
been counted as the law stated that they
should be. but Judge Belcher held that
the fact stated was no defense to the ac
tion brought by the city and county.
As the Fidelity and Deposit Company
had stated that it would take no appeal
from the judgment rendered by Judge
Belcher it will, in all probability, pay the
amount of the bondâ sloo,oooâ to the city
and county at once. Whether or not any
action will be taken against Widber per
sonally by the Fidelity and Deposit Com
pany in an endeavor to recover a portion
of the amount for which it has been held
liable is not as yet known, but as the de
faulting Treasurer has considerable
property of value it is thought that some
effort will be made to get judgment
against him.

AN UNFOUNDED CHARGE.
Health Inspector Dockery Says the
Story of Poisoned Berries
Is Untrue.
A report was made at the Health Of
fice a short time ago that several people
had been taken violently ill after eating
strawberries. They believed that some
poisonous wa-sh had been used Uy the
growers to kill off insects and that the
berries were poisoned. Inspector Doek
ery was detailed to make an investiga
tion Into the matter. He took samples
of berries from all of the commission
houses and they were subjected to a
careful analysis." No trace of any poison
was found. The health officials believe
that if any persons have been sickened
by eating strawberries the berries were
taken from boxes that had been repeat
edly filled. Some growers use the boxes
a half dozen times without cleaning them
and they become tainted. An ordinance
has been drawn up by the health officers
forbidding the use of berry boxes more
than once.

WERE BUNKOED
New Dodge Worked by
Three Clever Crooks.
TAMPERED WITH MACHINES
A DICE GAME THAT WORKED AS
A BLIND.
"Royal Flushes" Gained Without
Depositing a Nickel â The
Police on Their
Trail.
A well -developed scheme to defraud
cigar dealers has been brought to the at
tention of the police by 13. Mirsky. the
proprietor of a cigar store at Tenth and
Market streets. â¢
Three neatly dressed men have during
the past few weeks visited cigar stores
where the fascinating nlckel-in-the-slot
machine rested on the counter and by
a clever fraud have swindled a number
of leading retailers by their fraudulent
system. It was their rule to act in the
following manner: One of the trio would
enter the store and ask the man behind
the counter to allow him to look at his
newspaper. This favor was generally
granted and he would take up his position
iio.xt to the machine and while presum
ably reading the paper was actually hid
ing the device. His confederate would
then enter and invite the man in charge
to shake him dice for the cigars. This
invitation was never refused and while
they were engaged in the game, still an
other confederate would step In and go
to the machine. It was the last comer's
duty to slide a wire down the slot of the
contrivance and by a simple process drop
the cards down until he had secured a
royal flush. When this was accomplished
he would snap the handle down without
dropping a nickel and with an exclama
tion say, "I have a royal flush," which,
by the way, entitled him to 100 cigars.
Many dealers were mulcted in this way
until it became so frequent that suspicion
was aroused. Word was quietly passed
along the line and a sharp lookout was
kept for the swindlers. Yesterday the
plan was tried on Mr. Mirskv and might
nave succeeded but for the fact that he
was advised. He allowed the three bunko
men to go through their little act without
Interruption until he was told that the
man tampering with the machine had
landed his usual "royal flush." The lat
t'-r demanded his cigars, but was greatly
disappointed when Mr. Mirsky told the
trio to leave the place. The supposed win
ner began to arguo, when the propri
etor stepped from behind his stand with
the Intention of calling a policeman, when
the nun hastily left. Mirsky reported
the matter to the police last night, and
gave im accurate description of the men.
An effort will be maÂ«le to land the clever
crew, but In the meantime cigar dealers
are warned ngain.st them.
AGAINST THE DEATH TRAPS.
Commercial Men Ask for Regulation
of All Sailing Vessels.
At the regular meeting of the directors
of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday
the matter of enacting a law for securing
the safety of sailing vessels was discussed.
A short time ago the Board of Supervis
ors of this city came to the conclusion
that there should be some law by which
all sailing vessels could be inspected by
Federal officers, and any found unfit for
the transportation of freight and passen
gers could be condemned. To this end a
committee was appointed, consisting of
Supervisors Clinton Morton and Lack
mann, to confer with the members of the
Chamber of Commerce and the Collector
of the Port. The conference was held at
the meeting yesterday, and as a result the
following resolution was passed, which
Secretary Scott was directed to telegraph
to the Pacific Coast Representatives at
Washington:
Whereas, There does not appear to be any
law, national or State, covering the Inspection
and supervision of sailing vessels engaged In
our coast trade, applicable either to the con
struction of the vessel, manner of loading or
ability to carry passengers; and whereaa,
owing to the deficiency, we belle vt ; many sail
ing vessels have left our ports during the past
season which were unseaworthy fir dangerously
loaded, particularly those destined for Alaskan
ports, notably the bark Helen \V. Almy and
the schooner Jane Gray, which were lost and
many lives snoriflred. He It therefore
Resolved, That we earnestly request and re
spectfully urge upon our California delegation
In Washington to take immediate steps to In
duce Congress to pass such a law or laws as
will give to the proper Cnited States officers
full control of all sailing vessels carrying
passengers out of our ports.
The chamber appointed the following
gentlemen to represent it at the inter
national mining congress that is to meet
in Salt Lake City in July: C. W. Cross,
Tirey L. Ford, W. C. Ralston, George
Stone and W. S. Keyes. They will also
be delegates to the California Miners' As
sociation. Charles Christensen, the Ameri
can Central Manufacturing Company, the
St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Com
pany and Lloyd's Plate Glass Insurance
Company were elected members of the
chamber.
SOLDIERS AS ODD FELLOWS.
A Permanent Organization Is Ef-
fected Among the Volunteer
Troops From Idaho.
By special legislation the volunteers oi
the United States army can now embrace
the hrotherhood of the Odd Fellows' As
sociation and become active members,
with all the privileges and benefits de
rived from the usual membership roll.
A committee was appointed by the as
sociation of this city to make a canvass
of the entire volunteer force now sta
tioned at Camp Merritt for the purpose of
organizing separate branches of the so
ciety in each regiment. In the -further
ance of this object the Idaho regiment
was visited last evening and a perma
net organization effected among the boys.
Those who were elected to govern and
control the interests of the new branch
society are as follows: President. D. L.
Badley, sergeant major; vice-president,
Brother Stephonson, chaplain of the
Idaho regiment; secretary, Brother Ribb
lett; treasurer, Brother Kipp; guardian.
Brother Ferguson; warden, Sergeant Gil
man.
These officers will Immediately resolve
themselves into a special committee for
the purpose of making a thorough can
vass of the members of the regiment pre
paratory to the enrollment of the hoys as
members of the society. The by-laws of
the new organization will be effected on
the transports which will sail shortly for
Manila. At Honolulu the committee will
forward its report to the permanent or
ganizing committee of this city, which
will be submitted and acted upon by the
Odd Fellows' Association proper.
It is the intention of the home organiza
tion to petition the leading power of the
Odd Fellows' Society in the United States
to issue special legislation for the organ
izing of branch lodges of the society at
Manila upon the arrival of the troops.
Members of the Rebecca Lodge will
commence the work of distributing iden
tification badges among the troops this
evening, which will serve as a means of
identifying those members of the new so
ciety who may fall in battle.

TROOPS TO PARADE
ON OUR NATAL DAY.
EXERCISES TO BE HELD IN MET
ROPOLITAN HALL.
It Is Expected That There Will Be
Over Twelve Thousand Soldiers
in the Procession.
Tho executive committee of the citizens
having In charge the management of the
coming Fourth of July celebration decid
ed last night to remain within the $3000
appropriation made by the Board of Su
pervisors. Contributions to the celebra
tion fund will not be solicited, but any
donations .from patriotic citizens will be
accepted and devoted to securing features
to add to the grand parade contemplated.
When Chairman Joseph E. O'Donnell
called the meeting to order there were
but few absentees.
Grand Marshal Borlinl reported that he
was in communication with Generals
Merriam and Merritt relative to having
the volunteer troops now on their way to
Manila take part in the parade. He said
that he expected that there would be ful
ly 12,000 soldiers in line and that $1832 50
would cover the expenses of the parade.
This money will be used to defray the
cost of necessary bands.
William 1 Humphrey, chairman of the
literary committee, was of the opinion
that $o0 would cover all the expenses of
the literary exercises to be given after
the procession. The committee recom
mended that Metropolitan Hall be rented
for the exercises. The hall committee
had decided upon Woodward's Pavilion,
and as a result a lengthy controversy en
sued. It was finally decided by the ex
ecutive committee that Metropolitan Hall
was the proper place for holding the ex
ercises and the hall committee was in
structed to secure it.
Frank Lester, owing to a press of pri
vate business that precluded him giving
the necessary time to the duties of chair
man of the decoration committee, re
signed from that office and Frank B.
Gibson was appointed to succeed him.
The fireworks committee reported that
it would require $1000 to make a credit
able evening display of pyrotechnics.
Chairman O'Donnell said that the Call
fornla Fireworks Company had reported
to him that it would furnish nine set
pieces for $331. He was consequently un
able to understand why the committee
should ask for $1000. After considerable
debate it was decided to refer the matter
back to the original sub-committee.
The regatta committee asked for $525,
to be expended In medals and cash prizes.
Some of the members favored the doing
away of the regatta feature of the pro
gramme, but It was finally decided to
hold a regatta on July 3. No appropria
tion was allowed, however, to the com
mittee.
James H. O'Brien moved that the ex
ecutive committee be restricted to the
$3000 appropriation of the Supervisors.
The motion was carried, but all dona
tions to the fund from the people will be
accepted and the money so contributed
allotted to the several sub-committees to
be used in extending the original pro
gramme of celebration.
The executive committee will not at
tempt this year to decorate the streets.
That part of the work will be left to the
patriotism of the people along the line
of march.
Caesar Berthau and O. Icharl were
added to the finance committee.
The committee then adjourned to meet
next Friday evening.
The grand marshal has announced the
following officers of staff: Chief of staff.
Colonel J. C. O'Connor.; chief aids. Colonel
Ritchie L. Dunn, Captain F. E. Webb and
Lieutenant W. A. Borlini.
FURTHER CUT IN RATES.
Second-Class Rebate Tickets Now
Being Sold From New York to
San Francisco.
The second-class rates which were lately
put Into effect via Ogden by the Southern
Pacific were Intended to apply only from
San Francisco to points eastward. Yes
terday afternoon Jay W. Adams, the Pa
cific Coast representative of the Nickel
Plate line, which runs from Buffalo to
Chicago, received a dispatch from the
general passenger agent of the road that
second-clnss tickets from New York to
San Francisco, via Ogden, will now be
sold on the rebate plan which would m'a.ke
the rate the same a-s applies from here
eastward. The ticket will be sold at the
usual rate of 868 50 with a rebate collect
able in this city of $23 96, thus making the
cost of a second-class ticket $42 55.
It is supposed that the reduction was
brought about at the urgent request of
the West Shore railway running from
Buffalo to Chicago and the move would
naturally include all the lines that had
been a party to the reduced rates east
ward from this point which were in ef
fect June S. What effect if any the re
duction will have is not known, but it
would appear that the rebate plan is not
bringing much business. In the case of
tickets sold to Chicago the rebate of
$20 is a great deal of money to be tied up
by the average traveler and the system
does not appear to meet with much favor.
The FHirlington route has also put in a
second-class rate of $21 to St. Paul and
Minneapolis, the present rate of $47 carry
ing with it a rebate of $26.
A Turntable Nuisance.
M. H. de Young has filed a petition to
the Supervisors asking that the turntable
of the Geary-street railroad, which is
just before the door of the Chronicle
building, be declared a nuisance and
speedily abated. The petition sets forth
that in isist the Geary-street road pro
cured a permit to extend its line from the
west side of Kearny street, its terminus
at the time, to connect with the tracks
of the old Central railroad that ran on
Market street. It extended its tracks as
far as the northwesterly side of Market
street and there It built the turntable It
now uses. In the petition it is cited that
the privileges allowed in the order grant
ing permission to extend were not taken
advantage of and so they have been for
feited; also that the city does not allow
a turntable to hp within eleven feet of
any sidewalk and that the Geary-street
turntable is so close that the turning cars
overlap tho curbstone.
