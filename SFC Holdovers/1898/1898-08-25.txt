. Henry T. Gage of Los Angeles
ha> been nominated for Governor
!by. the Republican State conven
; tlOUv
\V : - T-he great body of delegates,
aroused to an intense pitch of en-
;; thusiasm, conferred the honor of
â  nomination by acclamation. The
:s.cene in the hall has seldom been
.equaled and will not soon be for
gotten. Personal ambitions and
individual aspirations were for
" gotten in the great cause of the
.:'. Republican party. One by one
;: the candidates, who had entered
the field against Gage, recog-
Y .nized his tremendous popularity
and dropped from the race. Only
':"' one remained â Dr. George C.
Pardee â and he. impelled by a
.purpose to see victory crown the
.'struggle of his party, publicly
withdrew his name after it had
â  eloquently been presented to the
.consideration of the convention.
' Such a spectacle of self-sacri
fice for the cause of a party's suc
cess won the instant tribute of a
..storm of applause. Dr. Pardee
â publicly expressed that an over
-.]"whelming majority of the dele
â¢.-â¢.gjiftefl felt that the man from the
: ;.so:uth is the logical leader to
:':â  eairry the Republicans to victory
'.?. fit the existing campaign. There
â¢â¢â jia?- never been in the history of
apolitical affairs in California a par
: aliel for such an action.
â¢ : ' : :' Harmony and union, a devo-
V ttoii to principle and a sacrifice
; yof personal ambition were the
â .-'motives of the candidate from
.;â¢ tHe. north, when, in the face of
-â â¢odds,, he gracefully withdrew.
The San Francisco Call.
When the convention responded,
rising to its feet in uncontrolled
enthusiasm, the retiring candi
date knew that he had obeyed
the unspoken wishes of hundreds
who in a few moments would
have registered their fealty to
Gage with their ballots. There
was in the cheers for Pardee the
strong expression of congratula
tion that the way had been
cleared for the convention to
voice its preference in the race
for gubernatorial honors.
Under such remarkable condi
tions Henry T. Gage of Los An
geles accepted the exacting con
ditions that the present campaign
force upon him. He thanked
the convention for the confidence
reposed in him. He was deeply
touched, he said, to feel that
upon his shoulders had fallen the
duties of leadership, and while all
knew that his own ambition
would spur him to succeed, he
begged all to believe that he as
sumed with the honor the sacred
obligation to win in the cause of
the great principles. As a leader,
he declared, he would strive for
the success of his party and for
the defeat of the dangerous ele
ments that have combined to in
jure the State, prejudice its in
terests and darken its fame before
the nation. With such a purpose
he will plead with all the people
of the State. He will carry the
war into the very stronghold of
the common enemy and chal
lenge it to a defense of its blight
ing principles.
As the leader of a great party,
determined to defend the welfare
of the State, he will fight for tri-
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1898.
I am not a politician and probably know as little about the political machinery of this State as any man who ever entered into a political
canvass. I attribute my success in securing the nomination for Governor on the Republican ticket entrely to the efforts of my friends and
the press of Cali ornia. The ccntest just clcsed has been a spirited one, but lam confident that no ill- eeiing has been created and that we
will all fight shoulder to shou der throughout the campaign. This confidence is supported by the fact that the candidates for all of the leading
offices visited and greeted each other with the heartiest ot handshakes while the fight was being: made, and I thank them for their generous
conduct toward me.
I believe that this convention will nom'nate a strong ticket and believe that it will be successful. Cur plattorm is a strong one, and,
taking all things into consideration, Ido not see how we can lese next November. It is my intention to canvass the entire State. If elected
Governor of California it shall be my s'eadfast purpose to insist upon a businesslike and economical administration of State affairs baszd upon
the principles of the Republican party as set forth in our platform. HENRY T. GAGE.
Henry Tiflft Gage was born near Geneva, in the State of New York, November 25. lftÂ» At an early age Mr. Gage was brought by his parents to Saginaw, Mich., where
he received his education He came to Los Angeles. Cal.. nearly thirty years ago, and after a brief residence returned to Saginaw, where, completing his education, he was admitted to
the bar in 187s. He again came to Los Angeles in 1876. since which time he has practiced the profession of law, winning for himself a large clientage and a lucrative practice. He has
never been attorney for any corporation except, as the associate of Hon. Stephen M. White, as counsel for the Los Angeles Times. He refused a retainer by the United Mates Govern
ment to prosecute the suit "against the Chilean vessel Itata. both because of his sympathy with the insurgents and because of his opinion that there was no legal warrant for the seizure
His judgment in this last particular was justified by the decision of Tudtre Ross and that of the United States Supreme Court in its judgment of affirmance. Mr. Gage s practice is large and
lucrative being both civil and criminal He has taken pride in the fact that he never accepted a case against a personal friend nor foreclosed a mortgage upon any man s home It is like
wise a matter of pride to him that he never received nor used a pass upon any line of railroid. He has always been opposed to the indiscriminate granting of franchises to railroads and
other corporations, which are a menace to labor. His political career is almost 'coeval with his advent to the county of Los Angeles, he being always a consistent and ardent Republican. He
has always actively assisted in the organization of the Republican party of his county and has frequently been sent as a delegate to both county and Mate conventions. He has never
before sought or accepted office, although many tempting offers have been extended to him. He was sent as a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. and was
the last of "the California!! delegation to vote for Blame. he refusing to change to the successful Harrison. At that convention he seconded the nomination ot Hon. Levi P. Morton for the
In addition to his legal business Mr. Gage has taken an active interest in mining, farming and fruit growing. He is a large owner in the rich Red Rover mines near Acton, and
has a large ranch near Downey He is married to an estimable lady and has five children, his residence being 1146 West Twenty-eighth street, in Los Angeles city. He is broad in the
treatment of all legal and political questions, and is gifted with keen, ready comprehension. He is prompt and energetic when called into action, and quickly appreciates the strength
?ind weakness of an adversary. No man is more unassuming than Mr. Gage, and none more in touch with the common people of his county, among whom he is familiarly known as
"Henry." He possesses executive powers and is conservative in his views of all public questions.

MENTO, Aug. 24.â Frank F. Davis of Los
Angeles, in placing Mr. Gage's name be
t ire the convention, spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
< (invention: Two years ago the Republi
can party in the State and nation
marched to imperial triumph. On every
hilltop and mountain peak our beacons
biased, and we wakened the echoes of
every valley with the songs of our re
joicing. We brought California into the
Republican column under the captaincy
of William McKinley. and united we :
stand fast in the common cause of pa
triotism and prosperity. We won that
splendid fight along the lines of honest
money and protection to American in
dustries and the integrity of the consti
tution. We defended the American eagle .
upon the American dollar, making it
honored and respected throughout the
commercial world.
We spread the shield of loyal veneration
before the breast of the constitution, and ;
faithfully parried every thrust of an
archy. We opened wide the doors of the
American workshop to the American
wage-earner, and crowned with the bene
diction of the nation the laboring man's
toll. We are again to-day in the same
trenches. Before us rises the common
enemy. It marshals in awkward column
the guerrilla, who deploys between the
lines and calls himself "Silver .
Republican." (Laughter.) Joining
hands with rag money Populist
and repudiation Democrat. It is a mot
ley crew that blows again the trumpet
of discord in the temple of peace, we
met the combination on the nation's bat
tlefield and checked it. We will meet the
combination on the battlefields of Califor
nia and exterminate it and its leaders.
(Applause and c .eers.)
Pause for a moment, my fellow-citi- i
CHOICE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR,
Jacob H. Neff, the Old War Horse
of Placer.
Our next Lieutenant Governor is one of those exceptional men whose
private arid public life has been so true to the dictates of honor and
the impulses of neighborly kindness and justice that his good name is
unassailable to the most reckless political opponent. Jacob Hart Neff's
citizenship is a worthy pattern for men and his personality makes loyal
and respecting friends of all who know him.
He is one of the surviving Argonauts, having come to California as a
young man in 1850, about twenty years after his birth in 1830. in the town
of Strausburg, Pa. In his boyhood he lived at Springfield, Ohio, and
for several years in Burlington, lowa, from where he came to this State.
He at once located in Placer County, which has ever since been his
home. His residence for many years has been at Colfax. He began win
ning fortune with a rocker on the American River, and mining has been
his business ever since. His mining career has been distinguished by
grc-at ability and success. He has for many years borne an able and
creditable part in public affairs. He was elected Sheriff of Placer Coun
ty in 1867, and was State Senator in 1871. He has, besides, been a Kail
road Commissioner and a State Prison director, and is now a trustee of
the State Library.
In these places of trust he has displayed the great administrative
ability and faithfulness to duty which characterize him, but perhaps his
most distinguished services to the State have been those performed as
tho leader and guiding spirit of the California Miners' Association in the
splendid work which it has accomplished since its organization In 1852.
He was chairman of the initial conference of Placer County miners,
called in the fall of 1891 to see what could be done to revive the lan
guishing industry of hydraulic mining. He became chairman of the ,
Placer County Miners' Convention, Into which that meeting developed,
was chairman of the executive committee which issued the call for a
State meeting, and when the California Miners' Association was organ
ized in January, 1892, he was unanimously elected chairman. He has
been enthusiastically re-elected every year since. During these years he
has been at the helm behind all the Important work of the association,
which has secure* the Caminettl law, the appropriations for restraining
dams, new mining laws for the State .and much else of great benefit to
this great industry of California. Before committees of Congress and
the Legislature his strong but wise and politic arguments have had
great weight. To his wise and conciliatory influence, more than to any
other single cause, was due the welcome disappearance of the old ran
corous hostility between the miners and the farmers.
While not a millionaire, he is a man of considerable wealth, though
plain of manner and speech. His mining interests are varied, but his
chief success has been that of the Morning Star drift mine on the
lowa Hill divide, In Placer County, the greatest and richest drift mine in
the State. Its discovery and development were due to him. He has
for the many years of its career had a large interest In the mine and
has, from the start, been its superintendent and general manger. He
has never married and his nearest living relatives are two sisters resid
ing In lowa. He has for many years been distinguished in Masonic cir
cles. He Is a Scottish Rite Mason, as well as a Knight Templar, and
has held a long succession of the most important offices in these orders.
I zens, to breathe the atmosphere in which
I we are to-dayâ this atmosphere of pa
triotic- fervor wakening the best im
pulses in the American heart. Do you
know where those impulses were born?
1 Born at the birth of the Republican
party. At its inception it confronted a
. ci isis such as the civilized world never
â¢ saw before. It solved that crisis to the
glory of the constitution and the flag. It
i called frum the dark valley of human
! bondage out upon the uplands throe
'â  dusky millions, leading them up to the
! heights where the sun of human liberty
! shed abroad its golden sunshine. It main
talned a national credit unimpaired, un
; touched, unstained, providing the people
; a currency which could purchase at 100
cents on the dollar American warships
in the markets of the world to defend the
American Has. (Applause.)
1 bring a man who espouses in all their
breadth the principles of this paijtyâ the
man to lift the standard of leadershipâ
and I name you Henry T. Gape of Los
Angeles. [Applause and cheering.] He is
i.;" the plain peopleâ a man who from his
boyhood has known what it is to be the
architect of his own fortunes. The Em
pire State gave him birth. Her motto is
"Excelsior," and that is his. A boy of 14
years he stood upon the frontiers of civil
ization to commence his career, to make
for himself fame and a namÂ«-. Thirty
yeara ago he came to California, and for
thirty years her splendid career of prog
ress has been along the line where Henry
T. Gage has traveled from the obscurity
of pioneer boy up Into the successful man,
lawyer, miner and farmer. He has not
often been in the public eye, but you shall
not determine the merit of men by offices
they hold. Men stand upon platforms and
claim for their lives the principles there
embodied. Henry T. Gage was never a
candidate before upon the platform of
any convention: but he comes fresh from
the people, plain, unassuming, earnest,
courageous, eloquent. He seeks no plat
form for the free and unlimited coinage
of Bllver at ihe ratio of 16 to 1, nor a
platform for the free and unlimited coin
age >.f brass at 16 to nothing; but he
stands upon the platform which is for an
ihonesi dollar, paying an honest day's
wages to an American wage-earner in an
American workshop. (Applause.)
His sympathies are broad. Let it be
said cf him to his honor that while he
enjoyed a lucrative practice in his prfl
fesion of the law he never foreclosed a
mortgage on a man's home in all his life.
I would rather have the record of such
a life as proof of sympathy with the toil
ing masses than the demagogic utterances
of men who stand upon any platform and
for any stripe of politics pleading their
vantage groun^ and not their deeds. He
is of the stalwart type of Republicanism.
I saw him in the National Republican
Convention of ISBS. the last Californian in
that great assemblage who cast a vote
for this State's and this nation's idol,
James G. Blame. [Applause.]
The same stalwart Republicanism
which marked him there has marked him
all through his life from the moment he
made his first public speech twenty-two
years ago until this day. He Is a win
ner. His reputation in his profession is
unsurpassed. As Daniel O'Connell once
said: "A good speech is a good thing,
but the verdict is the thing." He is a
man who can lead his fellow-men and
hold their hearts to his side and sym
pathy. Tie will prove the man who on
the platforms of this State in this cam
paign will meet and overthrow the soph
istry of our opponents and lead our rftirty
on to victory. (Applause.)
His role in this campaign will be like
that of Clark upon the Oregon, and In
the strife you will find him where you

JUDGE DAVIS IN NOMINATING GAGE PAID IE SOUTHERN SON A GLOWING TRIBUTE.
will find the American sailor in battle,
behind the kuh and on the deck.
He is independent of corporate influ
ences, but he is no demagogue. He rec
ognizes, as every citizen should recog
nize, under the law that men may unite
capital with brains and do business, but
when that union infringes upon the right
of the individual no man will stand more
earnestly for the people from which he
springs and with whom he sympathizes,
no man more courageously defend their
rights, than Henry T. Gage, the plain
man of the common people. (Applause.)
Fellow-citizens, we have upon oar
hands in this campaign no easy fight.
While I believe that Republican success
is in the air. it will demand energy, cour
age and activity of heart and brain on
every hand. We need a leader, strong.
wise, young, earnest, clean. I give him
to you in Henry T. Gage of Los Angeles.
(Applause and cheers.)

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 24.â Dr. George C. Pardee
of Oakland was placed in nomination for
the office of Governor by Timothy Guy
Phelps of San Mateo. The address was
a happy one and was well received by
both the friends and the opponents of
Dr. Pardee. It follows in full:
Mr. Phelpsâ Mr. Chairman and Gentle
men of the Convention: To me has been
assigned the distinguished honor of plac
ing before this convention, as a candi
date for the nomination for the high of
fice of chief executive of this State,
a native son of California, one whom I
have known since his birth and whose
career I have watched for years, as a
student, as a _ professional man, and as
Mayor of a great city. In all depart
ments of life he ha*, proved himself a
clean man. an honorable, high minded
gentleman and officer of distinguished
ability. I have the honor, gentlemen of
the convention, of placing before you for
nomination for the office of Governor
the Hon. George Pardee of Alameda.
(Cheers.) I want to say to this conven
tion and to my friends in it that from
my long and close acquaintance with this
gentleman I believe there is no man in
thlÃ commonwealth who is better
equipped for the high office than is
George C. Pardee, in ability. In high
character, in independence of character,
in freedom from all those entangling al
liances that would prevent independent
action and from his intimate acquain
tance with the people the Industries and
the interest of the State of California.
Grand old Alameda County, whose ma
jorities were more than 5800, and saved
California to William McKlnley for Pres
ident of the United States! (Cheers from
the Alameda delegation.)
Alameda asks at your hands this nomi
nation. I ask, Is she entitled to it for the
majorities that she has given us right
along In the past and for what we hope
from her in the future? Right here I
want to correct a most unmerited and
most malicious slander. It has beea
stated that Alameda County and Ala
raeda's favorite candidate would, in case
of non-success, be so much disappointed
that they would falter at the polls. Let
me say there was never a more malicious
slander heaped upon a man or a county.
George C Pardee Is too broad a man to
balk In harness, or skulk away when the
flght comes on, and old Alameda Coujnty
has too often proved her loyalty to the
Republican party in the majorities that
she has rolled up. (Cheers).
Nominate George C. Pardee and I be
lieve the majority of 5000 and more which
she gave at the last election will be in
creased to in the neighborhood of 10,000.
With him as a candidate there would be
no stayaways from the polls, no laggards
whatever. He would bring up from the
mire of Democracy hundreds. If not thou
sands, and plant them upon the solid
ground of Republicanism. Whether you
nominate him or whether your choice
shall fall upon another, Alameda County
and George C. Pardee, her favorite son,
will ever prove their loyalty to the Re
publican party. (Cheers.) There never
was a time, fellow citizens, when a Re
publican victory was more important to
us than now. The march of progress, the
war which has just closed have opened
new fields of commerce and Industry to
us. New fields to be occupied If we have
but the ability to seize upon them. Our
country is compoaed of mort than 75,0<Ki.000
of people. We have added under the pro
tection of the flag more than 12,000,000 ad
ditional, which we have to govern. I
am heartily in accord with the resolutions
which have been passed in regard to gov
erning those territories, conquered and an
nexed to the United States. This war will
result in more benefit to California than
perhaps any other part of the nation. It
will insure to us the building of the
Nicaragua canal, which will save the
peqplÃ of this coast ten times the cost
of Its construction.
Now, fellow-citizens, whether you
choose one candidate or another, I be
lieve that the Republican party of Cali
fornia is a solid army and will march so
to victory. [Cheers.] I believe, while it
seems to be the business of the Demo
cratic party to tear down and to destroy.
It Is the business of the Republican party
to build vp â to build up the industries de
stroyed by the misrule of the Democracy
and to lift the galling yoke of bondage
from the oppressed, so far as our influ
ence goes. Fellow-citizens, in the ides of
November we will pierce this old com
posite ship of Democracy, manned by its
motley crew, composed of different par
ties and 'isms, as the solid shot of Dewey
pierced the fleet of Spain in the harbor of
Manila and as did those of Sampson
and Sehlo.y the fleet of Cervera
on the coast of Cuba. [Cheers.] I trust,
gentlemen, that your deliberations will
reach a wise conclusion, and thank you
for listening to me.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 24.â After the applause
which had greeted the eloquent speech of
Mr. Davis had subsided, speeches sec
onding the nomination were made as fol
lows:
C. R. Stewartâ Mr. Chairman: I de
sire to second the nomination of Henry
T. Gage. Of the entire people of the
State of California, there iF no man more
thoroughly acquainted with right and
has more ability to down this unholy
combination of Bryanitcs and silverites
than Henry T. Gage of Los Angelee.
The Voice of Sonoma.
A. B. Lemmon of Sonomaâ Mr. Chair
man: Sonoma County expected to come
to this grand State convention of Re
publicans with a candidate for the first
place on our ticket in this contest. We
are here as the warm personal and de
voted friends of one of the brightest and
one of the best young men in the State
of California, and if his name had been
proposed to this convention our hats
would have gone into the air and our
voices would have rung in his behalf.
His name Is not to be brought into this
convention at this time, but we have
studied the situation since we came to
Sacramento from every standpoint,
want to say to you that every one of
the twenty-one delegates from grand old
Sonoma came here unpledged to any
body. I want to say to you mat every
one of those delegates has stood un
pledged to anybody until this moment.
We nave met the several candidates; we
have conferred with the several candi
dates; we have studied the situation and
these twenty-one votes say that Sonoma
has made her choice among the candi
dates, and that, for the first time, the
badge of any man is pinned upon the
coat of a Republican from Sonoma Coun
ty when together they pinned the badges
bearing the name of Henry T. Gage upon
their coats and go into the contest
pledged to as loyal and as true a support
from that county as ever was given to
any man in any contest. (Applause.)
Powers Speaks for Gage.
Frank H. Powers of San Franciscoâ Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen: San Francisco
Is not the banner Republican County of
the State, but we have some men whose
Individual desires sometimes make them
do things, forget their party fealty. For
them we apologize. We did, however, in
the last campaign under the earnest,
painstaking, constant, laboring supervi
sion of Major Frank McLaughlin, as chair
man of the State Committee, change
I eleven thousand against us In the cam
! paign of 18JH into 215 for McKinley in 1896.
The battle ground of this campaign, gen
tlemen, is going to be on the battle ground
nf lsM. Therefore, San Francisco, study
ing the notes of that battle, familiar with
the tactics of the enemy, looking around
hero for the man best able to cope with
that enemy, thinks that man is the Hon
orable Henry T. Gage of Los Angeles.
(Applause and cheers.) This State is tired
of Jim Buddism. For the last four years
i the affairs of the Stateâ the appointments
i to office â seem not to have been deter
! mined by the ne,eds of the commonwealth,
but by the dictates of the dice box.
We need now under the crisis
In the diplomacy that is neces
sary to come with the acquiring of addi
tional territory to place this State under
the control of a party that has a principle
to govern it and there maintain that prin
ciple. (Applause.)
In such a battle as this we dare not
| make a mistake in our nominee. There
i fore, we have turned to that man who is
I an honor to his profession and honored by
every man in his profession; who is be
loved by his family because he lives for
i his family, and goes to it every day in the
I suburbs -of Los Angeles, and whose nelgh
| bors feel that they are part of his fam-
I ily; whose oratoryâ strong, convincing.
! logicalâ heard upon the stump, will carry
ennviction as against the isms of the
Democracy. The little giant of the Dem
ocracy Is not to be treated lightly. The
battle Is on. The gage of battle â (cries of
time!)
Gentlemen, we apologize again for some
of our San Francisco hoodlums. If it Is
necessary, gentlemen, we can give you
their names. There are only four or rive.
The little giant of Democracy got to
gether an aggregation of talking cranks
the other day. and they voiced their isms.
A military gentleman said that he was
satisfied that anybody looking at it would
know that the rnpld-flring guns "of their
lings had been misfit with the slow-firing
single-shot brain;-. (Laughter.)
Now, then, we are going into this fight
with San Francisco doing her best to
keep up the majority of 1896, and we feel
that the fight Is going to be won because
we arc going to be behind .a man who. in
thought. In Intelligence, in courage, in the
defense of the right and In defiance of cor

I am the next best thing. I married a

And I have in my house two native sons

they have leveled the natural barriers
and have gone to Tulare County and to
Northern Butte for oranges when the
blight struck their own fair fields. (Ap
plause.)
If there is anything that I admire from
tho bottom of my heart it Is a good fight
er and a man who knows what he wants
and knows how to get it. I submit to the
Republicans of this great convention both
north and south that the business of the
Republican party in its management, in
its speeches, In ita platform, is to address
itself not so much to the past as It is
to the young men of the present. Old
men will soon die, but young men are
coming to the front to take the banner
of Republicanism in their hands and to
carry it to future victory. I stand on this
platform to-day as a representative of
the young men of my adopted county and
State. Some one yesterday referred in
terms of criticism to the young men who
followed the!'- beloved leader and ma.je
the stri*t>rs of Sacramento ring with their
Joyous peals. I said to that man, "Never
you mind; every one of those young men
has a vote and every one is a Republi
can." (Applause.)
They came here because we could not
keep them at home. We had conserva
tive men in our own county who said "Do
as the Los Angelenos do â bring up their
bankers and their orange growers and
their lawyers, their wise, gray-haired
and bald-headed menâ and you will win
your fight." (Laughter and applause.)
We said "No; if the boys want to come,
in God's name let them come." and they
came and they paid their own fare out
of their own pockets (applause and
cheers), and many a boy In that devoted
band will wear his shoes six months
longer to pay the expenses of this trip.
Those are the young men that we want
to get behind any leader, and these are
the young men we want to get heart and
soul" into the Republican party. I am
glad to be here an advocate of the Hon.
George C. Pardee. (Applause).
I heard whispered on this floor within
the last hour the term "demagogue." If
there is one term more than another that
has a blighting influence upon the young
men of this State in their attempt to
show 'independence, it Is the whisper of ]
â¢"demagogue." Lincoln never bothered
about that. Garfleld was never troubled i
about that, and if the Republican party i
shall ever fall from its high position in j
the affections of the people of this coun
try it will be because its young men are !
afraid to do right, because they are afraid f
of being called "demagogues." There is ,
only one other thing that has a blight- j
ing* effect upon the young men of this ;
State, and that is the fear that they i
won't get on the wagon in time â the band i
wagon. If you feel that you are right,
go ahead and the people will fall In right
with you.

men of the convention. Calaveras desires
to second the nomination of George C.
Pardee from Alameda (applause and
cheers), and in doing so I bring you a
message from the mountains, telling you
that it is with pride and pleasure that
we come here to further the ambition of
that gallant young Republican who seeks
the exalted position of Governor.
We have known him in the mountains
by hie record for years. It is true that
we are but distant observers of the great
events that are occurring in this great
State. It is true that we can only see
thorn at a distance. We have not come in
contact with the great question of cor
poration influence. We are living remote
from them, but for that reason we can
form a dispassionate opinion of men who
are seeking high places.
We In the mountain counties have ob
served with pride this young man who
has been battling in Alameda County
against corporation and monopoly influ
ences. (Applause.) We have observed
that in every act that he has performed
he has been a friend of the people. We
know him from everything that he has
done, and that he has stood as a valiant
defender of the people's rights. We know
him to be a young man born and raised
in the State, and, ny reason of that fact,
he has a broad and a Just experience in
the handling- of all the great questions
with which he has come in contact.
We know him to be a graduate of the
University of California, and we know
that the influences of that loyal institu
tion have gone forth in every act that
he has been called upon to perform In
his public duties v I say to you gentle
men, that from a distance, we have ob
served all this, and it is for that reason
that I come from the mountains to sec
ond the nomination of George C. Pardee
(Applause.) I tell you further, gentlemen
although it has been at a long distance
that this experience and knowledge has
come to us, when I come here into the
convention and look into the faces of the
gallant men who have followed him from
Alameda, I know t-hat our judgment wns
right. I know that Dr. George C. Pardee
Is a man that to-day can lead us on to
victory in the great campaign that is com
ing on. For that reason I second his
nomination and appeal to you, gentlemen.

Eloquent Words of the Lawyer Who
â¢Seeks to Be United States Senator
; for California.
â¢â¢' CALL HEADQUARTERS, Aug. 24.â
General W. 11. L. Barnes, who
avowed candidate for the appointment of
tJhited States Senator to succeed Senator
Stephen M. White, addressed the State
' convention this morning. The address
\ras delivered during a break In the pro
ceedings, due to the failure of one of the
committees to report at the expected
.time. General Barnes responded to a call
made by the members and spoke as fol
. lows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
â Convention: In this world, as probably
In the world to c< me, no man knows what
is to happen to him. (Laughter.) I was
flatteredâ extremely flatteredâ by my ad
vancement In this body. On my first en
try 1 took my Beat like the young man
in the Scripturesâ "Outside the pale"â and
along came one of the secretaries, and he
.said, "Why. General, this is no place for
â  you; come in." And be put me In most
agreeable Ibciety â among the ladles,
thinking, probably. I was an old one.
(Laughter.) I had not been there a
great' while this morning before one of
â¢ the secretaries, with courtesy and wear-
Ing a smiie ana suitable apparel for this
n. came to me and Invited me to
take a Beat upon the platform. I am
'.'always afraid when a man approaches
.me. with a gift. (Laughter.) But 1 Anally
' concluded it would be a pleasant thing
to' hobnob with George Knight and with
â¢ the- chairman of the Suite Central Com
' rnittee. and I came upon the platform.
â They, knew very well that the chairman
of the committee on platform and resplu
tions would not be ready to make his
tnent to you here of the principles
that were to guide us in this present cam
â¢ paign, and so they had me. as they have
â  :my friend. Knight, unless h*> has run
â away (Laughter), ready to 1511 the gap.
it is pretty much as In one of those
' country races. They send a man around
the .track on a pony and with a bass
."drum to pound his way through the
.crowd before the big trotters come on.
â .(Laughter.)
; ' But. gentlemen, this is perhaps as good
â¢i as another to congratulate
â  ourselves upon the position
tlonal Republican party. It is wonderful
to !".'k N;uk upon its history and its tra
â  dl tions of honor, and see how it was
' bom, under what circumstances of dis
' aster and danger it came into existence.
how splendidly it grew, until it reached
: .the. to\\ , : i!!^ stature that commanded
Of t:.- world. In all the
changes of time and conditions of men it
: -,\n in the hour of advancement; in
â¢the. hour of peril It is in charge of the
'.helm of state, and under the administra
te'!) of the Republican party the most
â¢pflendid victories that the annals of war
.'will ever relate are those of the American
and n.ivy upon sea and upon the
land. (Applause.; I don't know how it
: is: with you, gentlemen, but within the
rour months this flag of ours has
grown to have a new beauty ami a wider
'meaning. Its stars, its mue, its white, its
crimson, were always the emblem of
â¢man's best hope and desire â always the
::i of something good and bright, to
cojne as i!:.- sunlight, breaking ' through
Cstern light, streaming with crim
.! with gold, and mingling its col
or's with the .-tars that God's great hand
larited to burn, like torches Im
.niortal, in the midnight sky. (Applause.)
It was to me the grandest emblem of
'all times, and to-day, when we look at
it. with the new -triumphs that surround
it. as it leads in the van of the new era.
ling beyond the limits of our own
country and passing over seas and cast
ing its" benediction upon other peoples, I
V. cm to think of the time imagined bi
t-he poet when the war drum should beat
ne longer and the battle flag be furled in
the parliament of mail and the federation
' -i>f , the world.
.â That flag floats to-day over islands yet
' unknown to the best civilization of the
time. Is it going to hurt the United
States to hold th.-m? (X'ries of "No.")
Is it going to do anything else to them
but bless them? Why. our fathers
â¢ taught, and wisely perhaps at the time,
that we should form no entangling al
liances, and preserve ourselves like a
sort of hermit nation, unmoved and un
' disturbed by the sujrms that beat on
â o'fh'T continents; but when George
.-Washington wrote his famous farewell
address there were but three million
'.white people In all the colonies of the
: United Statesâ three millions of people,
'â  and that was allâ and a half million ne
. cto slaves. England held the north.
.Spain held the Floridas, France and
: Spain were contending for thfe territory
west of the Mississippi River, and Mcx-
Icd lay at the southwest, and Washing
ton said over and over again, in his cor
; respondence, that the Mississippi River
. was the natural boundary of the United
States. And we know that every time.
â  since then that territory has been ac
quired it was met with resistance on the
part of a great many thinking people,
because they supposed the constitution
of the United States could never stand
â  the strain of such extension.
. Wh<-n Mr. Jefferson, by the Louisiana
â purchase, and the expenditure of $15,000,
'.QT<O, took that vast territory west of the
.Mississippi, there were thousands of the
most thinking men In the United States
who declared it was the commencement
of the ruin of the great Government un
der which we had lived to that time.
When, in 1819, we made the mistake of
buying the Floridas from Spain and pay
ing thÂ« claims of American citizens for
the depredations which Spanish bucca
neers had committed in the G'jlf of Mex
ico, seeking refuge in the "arbors of
Cubaâ those very harbors where our
â¢ ships in the last four months have been
â¢sending their mlsslk-s of war, when they
had taken and destroyed about eight
millions of dollars' worth of American
property, and for the Floridas, we agreed
to pay those bills â there was a mistake.
We should have taken the Floridas and
taken Cuba, too, then. (Prolonged ap
plause.)
When we annexed Texas and took It
into the Union, you will remember how
iitrenu-tusly the "Whig party of the time
-"sisu-d that operation. It has passed
into history that the great speaker and
orator of Ohio, Thomas Corwln, said he
â¢hoped the Mexican armies would wel
â  come those of the United States with
â¢bloody hands and hospitable graves. Vet
.we conquered Mexico, and. under the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, acquired
Ihoso territories, and the blessed land
where we now live. The Oregon pur
chape had already preceded It. And when
Mr. Seward. In 1867, leaped over the Brit
ish possessions and traded with Russia
for Alaska, you ail remember with what
shouts of derision the press of the United
States, from one end of It to the other,
accepted that transaction. So it is to
day. Yet. singularly enough, there is
.less resistance to the idea of ncqulring
possessions outside of the present limits
â¢of the United States thun to any other
.proposed acquisition of territory the
united States has ever made.
. For my part I hope and 1 believe that
not one foot of the territory of which we
have acquired possession, either by the
-sion of the foot or by the theory
.of law, will ever be surrendered. [Ap"
plau.se and cheers.] I hope never to know
that a single grave beneath which, under
the tropic sun, lie the rotting remains of
'an American soldier, mingling with the
soil of those Islands, shall ever be sur
rendered by this Government to nny
other on the face of this earth! [Tremori
â¢ douÃ applause.] That it will rem;.*); foiÂ»
â ever the sentinel over our heroes who
have fought and died for the extension
of American commerce and the rectifica
tion and chastisement of three hundred
years of the vilest outrages oy the vilest
Government the world has ever known.
TA-pplausf.]
I Deueve I voice your sentiment, and I
think a man might start from New York
and travel across the continent until his
â eyes caught the glimmer of the shining
waves of the Pacificâ he might begin at
any one of the great lakes and pans to I
the southern extremity of Florida, and
be would find in the great mass of the
American people the determination that
the Government should be compelled to
keep whatever territory we acquired
either by purchase or b\- the art of war,
and that on any soil anywhere where the
banner of light and freedom and life and
love for mankind has unfolded its glis- ;
tening beauties to the glories of the sun !
or the shining of the stars, it shall never '
again be hauled down by any hand that
God ever made. [Applause and cheers.]
I arose, gentlemen, for the purpose or |
thanking youâ (Cries of "Go on. go on"] j
I think my time !s up. [Cries of "Go on. |
go on."] I wonder if the chairman of
the committee on platform and resolutions
is up yet? I would suggest the appoint- |
mont of a committee to go down to the
Golden Eagle Hotel and see whether he
is out of bed.
The Chairâ That has already been at
tended to.
General Barnesâ What reason have we,
gentlemen, for looking forward to any
thing but a victory in this campaign?
They say that Maguire will be hard to
beat. I don't think so. They hold him
ufc> to us pretty much as they used to in
the country in the summertime hold up
a watermelon [Laughter] out of which
the boys had scooped the contents and
on the 'rinds of which they cut eyebrows
and then a couple of holes for eyes, a
triangle for a nose ami a slit for a
mouth, and put a tallow candle Inside of
It and set it upon a fence. [Immense
laughter.] Maguire is the compound got
by Democracy out of fusion. [Laugh
ter ] The Populists furnished the water
melon [laughter] and the n-mnnraoy
has cut out the face. [Prolonged laugh
ter and cheers'.] Now, I say this with no
personal disrespect for James Gallagher
Maguire. [Laughter.] I have enjoyed
his acquaintance for a good many years.
I have tried cases before him as a Judge;
I have had a good deal of badinage with
him on the subject of politics, and per
sonally I like M:iguire very much. What
there is of him is very good. [Laugh
ter.] The only trouble is there Is not
quite enough of it. It is singular to see
what powers of admiration the Demo
cratic party can evolve for an Individual
Democrat on the slightest possible pre

text. [Laughter.] Mr. Maguire has been
some time in Congress, and I pause, as
we shall pause as we go through the
State, to ask his personal friends to tell
us what great measure was over emitted
from the seat occupied by Judge Ma
guire in Congress. You will find none
whatever. It is true he fought the fund
ing bill, but he ilid not fight it half as
hard as S. G. Hilborn In the Alameda
District. i Laughter and cheers.) And
when the funding bill measure, made a
rider to another bill, was oefore the
House they all acquiesced in it.
DR. PARDEE WILL SUPPORT THE ENTIRE TICKET
SACRAMENTO Aug. 24.â Alameda County, with her usual loyalty to the Republican party, bows to the inevita- ,;
ble am: pledges her support to Henry T. Gage and the Republican ticket. Her services to the party were not ren
dered because of any expected reward, but because sh>> is loyal to the party thai has saved the nation in its time of
sorest strait and has carried the Stars and Stripes into the uttermost corner of the earth.
Whenever Alameda County has been called upon by the party she has responded in no uncertain tones, and in (
November next she will not only retain her proud position as the banner Republican county of the State but will put (
to blush all her previous services to the party. .
As to myself, I have this to say: lam only a Republican, and my earnest, hearty support will be given to the
ticket The spontaneous, enthusiastic support given to me by my friends and neighbors (who have watched me grow <
up from childhood to manhood and know me better than I know myseif) has touched me deeply. I would that I could (
express a" tithe of the gratitude I feel. GEORGE C. PARDEE.
And since Maguire's friend. Senator
Morgan, declared in San Francisco the
other day that the railroad issue might
now be laid out of slpht we find Mr. Ma
guire absolutely stripped of his capital.
Mr Hitt of Illinois declared in the I nion
League ClUb of San Francisco not long
ago that Mr. Hilborn had been in his scat
and in his committee-room at every ses
sion that had been held while he had been
In Congress, and he turned to me and
said: "If you will have those records
examined" (we were talking about it be
cause it was the night when those gen
tlemen were received by the Union
League Club in San Francisco, and when
the funeral procession of the slnele tax
was coming up Market street [Laughter]
âhe said, "If you will turn to the rec
ords you will see that Mr. BCagUlre was
not in his seat attending to public busi
ness one day in twenty." And vet he
comes home and they pack him. after all
his pilgrimage through almost ev> ry
party to be found that had an "ism" or
a "crankism" In it, and hold him up and
sit him down like :i Chinese joss for the
Democracy of the State to burn candles
before. [Laughter.]
We snail take this subject up during
this campaign, and the peopla will under
stand pretty well before they get through
what they are asked to do. We shall get
back many wanderers from our folds, and
the silent punishment of the ballot-box
will teach a lesson to those who have en
deavored to fuse two parties together.
Then will be the result that has always
! followed where you tie a couple of cats
I tail to tail [laughter] or tie a couple of
mules tail to tailâ they scratch and kick
I each other to death. And that is what is
going to happen In this State. [Laughter
and applaus.. ] The regular Democracy
won't have it; the Middle-of-the-road
Populist, who knows how he is being
swallowed up, won't have it.
Fellow-citizens, the registration of the
voters of this State is some :;o,im)o or 40.000
iess man it was in the last Presidential
campaign. Who kept away from the regis
tration" Not the Republican [applause]
because his heart was beating high and
answering, echo for echo, to the guns oi
Dewey and the guns of Sampson, iAp
plause.] He marched as a victor, and his
] registration meant more than the nromise
I of a vote for the election of a State of
ficer. He knew that it meant approval
i for the statesmanlike course that Presl
r dent McKinley has pursued. [Applause.]
: There is no Republican in this State to
day who, when he votes, will not feel
that he is speaking with a heart-throb to
that magnificent man at Washington who
deserves to sit high in the temple. In
I the Pantheon of human greatness, by the
side of Lincoln and Grant. [Applause.]
That trinity of names will go down to
I farthest history, and this age will be a
great age to posterity when it shall be
known that in a single generation, out of
the common citizenship of a nation like
this, have been evolved three such men
as Lincoln, Grant and McKinley. [.Tre
mendous applause.]
And so ! say that whoever votes the
Republican ticket this fall will say to
the President of the United States. "Well
done, thou good and faithful servant; re
ceive the heartfelt congratulations and
the undying love of one of your fellow
citizens;' although thousands of miles
away, his heart is beating in sympathy
with yours; his hand Is writing your
name high upon the scroll of fame. anS
in your case as in others will be taught
to all time, the lessons that republics
are. after all. not ungrateful." (Cheers.)
I have often said that we do not love
our country enough. We do not. We do
not realize what a heritage we have. We
do not realize how it is that in a cen
tury and a quarter we have nearly a
hundred millions of people. The church
and schoolhouse and farm and shop, and
the means of living, have grown here so
that we can never fear being hemmed
in by any people on the face of the
globe*. What a thought It isâ that al
though all the world were to unite to
shut up the United States and blockade
its ports, and from inside and outside
put an embargo on the receiving or send
ing out of any product of this earth of
the industry of man, no one of the 100.
000,000 people would have less to eat, less
to wear, or know, except for the his
torical fact that we were at war with
anybody. (Cheers.)
We are a queer people. We went into
this wnr without getting mad. We have
not got mad yet. (Laughter.) We have
spent $150,000,000. and nobody thought of
It, and when at last the protocol was
signed and peace was practically assur
ed, nobody cared anything about that!
(Laughter!) All you did was to haul
down the flag that had been floating and
needed mending; our wives mended it
and laid it up for the next fight. (Laugh
ter.)
I wonder if there Is any people on the
face of the globe that can present such
a record? What other nation permit
the people of the nation with whom they
are at war to live among them in the
enjoyment of all the blessings of peace
without disturbance of any kind? Is
there a people on the face of this earth
as magnanimous as the American peo
ple? History presents no record of such
a nation, and we shall go on until the
great war for commercial supremacy
that within the ne:a ten years is to in
volve this nation, because the difference
in exchange is getting to be so vast in
favor of this country, for we sold the
world a billion of dollars more lust year
than we bought, and Bye yean of such
differences will bankrupt the world.
(Cheers.) What will happen? They will
attemptâ and cause of war is always
easy to be foundâ to check the Americaikf
commerce, and then war will come again.
And I hone to God that when it does
come the "world will find us better pre
pared than. when this war began.
(Cheers.) That wo shall not send troope
to camp barefooted, shirtless and ragged.
I shall never forget the day I stood in
the streets of San Francisco and saw thai
regiment from Tennessee, under that
splendid old Confederate Colonel AY. C.
Smith, marching through the streets,
some hatless. some almost in rags and
some as nearly shoeless as the army of
Washington in the winter at Valley
Forge: but every face lit up With the light
of patriotism, and all singing and shout
ing as they wi at to tight for the flag of
their country. (Cheers.)
It was a shame. It was a shame that
these men ever Buffered as they have.
What touching scenes have occurred in
these camps. I hoard the other day of
a gentle, lovely boy. tola father's and
mother's only trust and hope, who en
listed and was sent to sleep upon the
danip sand at Camp Merritt. drilled in
the day time until the perspiration ran
from every pore and then turned loose
without a coat to shiver in the cutting
fog and the afternoon northwest wind.
At last canu disease. He lay waiting for
the hour of his death. Beside him the
captain of his company, the chaplain and
the surgeon of the regiment. In a wind
swept tent, where the night breezes flick
ered the light of the candle, that young
soul ebbed away, the vii'tim of mismnn
ag. nvnt and inattention. "He will live,
perhaps until taps come," said the cap
tain. "He will not," said the surgeon.
But he did and the last melancholy note
Of the soldier's good-night rloated over the
camp. As it ceased the boy's breast grave
one last heave and the convulsions of
death ran through his limbs and his eyes
closed. As the breath went out forever
the sentry halted in front of the t.'tit.
brought his piece to port and said "10
(/clock and all is well."
Aye! So it was all well with the suf
ferer. But it shall never be well until
the American Government has learned
that the lift of a single soldier is worth
as much as the life of the United States.
Never shall we do our duty until, when
we have a call for men. we shall send
them out equipped and ready for the dis
charge of the great duties of war, and not
keep them imprisoned in such sinks of
misery and Iniquity as that which lay on
the â¢ dges of San Francisco, where fog,
sickness and horror reign and where on
the range of the cemetery of the Presidio
are 130 graves of American boys murdered
before the battle by neglect, carelessness
arid want of proper attention. Let us
learn this lesson and to those who are
legislating, whether here or at Washing
ton, let the lesson be inculcated that from
this hour out this army is the army of
civilization, equipped and prepared for
any event; that our navy is not the seventh
but equal to the first, and that we shall so
fully equip the boys that they will always
be ready to fight for the flag, the heritage
of our fathers and the hope of mankind.
(Cheers and prolonged applause.)

REA'S SO-tf IN REBELLIOUS MOOD
Trouble Caused by the Action of the
Political Gang in Deposing
Professor Smith.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 24.â Great interest is
now centered on the outcome of the San
Jose High School trouble. School opens
Monday, and it is not thought that more
than 100 out of the 350 pupils of the
school will attend. The boys voted unani
mously not to attend the school unless
Professor Smith was reinstated. Instead
the board elected Professor Uueason to thu
place, and the outcome of the strike of
the scholars will be watched with inter
est. A majority of the pupils will go to
the Santa Clara high .scnools. Parents
who stand in with the gang are deter
mined to drive their children to school.
but many of the pupils are obstinate and
will refuse to go.
Tom Rea, a son of "Boss" Rea, has
rebelled against his father's Interference
in the School Department. Young Rea
declares he will go to the Santa Clara
school. The boss says the boy must go
to the local school, and just who will
come out ahead in the matter remains to
be seen. Rea has offered his son all kinds
of presents to induce him to change his
mind, but without avail, and it looks now
as though the political boss will have to
make some big sacrifices in order to keep
lorn in the school.

A Few Sidelights on the Serious as Well as
the Humorous Features of a Day
of Speechmaking.
By Henry James.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 24. â There are intervals
at which a convention is dry, and one
of these arrived this morning. An
nouncement ha I been made that order
would be called at 9 o'clock.
Of course nobody really believed it
â¢would be, yet the possibility had to be
recognized and cut short many a nap.
When the gavel fell tardily the dele
gates were still sleepy. Perhaps this
Is the rtai n they listened so quietly
to the reading of the report of the cre
dentials committee and adopted the re
port without comment, and, I am
bound to say, without any enthusiasm.
Thon chairman Nefl made known
that the platform committee would not
be ready for twenty-five minutes and
suggested that the space be filled by
speeches.
General Barnes was on the platform
and after a little vociferous persuasion
he advanced to the front. The general
is not only a journalist, but a candidate
for the Senate. To say what is his
reputation as an orator would be a
waste of words. That his speech was
bright and witty, marked by a happy
humor, and abounding in sonorous
phrase needs no telling. His tribute to
the flag was beautiful of sentiment and
expression, and when upon the grave
of soldier and sailor dead he laid the
wreath of memory there was tender
ness and poetry in the phrasing and
across the great audience, sitting
silent, there swept a wave of emotion.
To General Barnes stars are not
stars, but torches immortal in the mid
night sky. At times a patriotic climax
brought the listeners to their feet with
shouting and waving of banners. The
idea that where the Stars and Stripes
had been lifted there they should re
main wa3 exactly in accord with the
Idea of the audience. It was when the
speaker drew the picture of a volunteer
dying in fog-swept Camp Merritt, a
boy whose soul had fled just as the
sentinel had cried at the tent "Ten
o'clock and all is well," fven the men
could be seen - -ping their eyes. At the
end there were three great cheers.
Perhaps the speech had no legitimate
place in a convention, but I am glad it
was there, and venture to assert that
no space-rate inspiration will ever in
duce Barnes to write half so well for
a yellow journal.
There had been an expectation that
George Knight would follow, but when
at last Barnes made his bow Knight
had disappeared, taking with him the
justly celebrated thunder tones which
he has, on provocation, been known to
loose. A hasty search was made with
out avail, and the platform committee
still being out of sight a recess was
taken until 1 o'clock.
General W. EL H. Hart was in the
throng and might have been induced to
make a speech, but everybody waited
for somebody else to suggest this and
as a result nobody did it. Hart was
r^ady. He could have told the story
of the time he -vaa not a drummer boy
and how he had been wafted into office
on a rataplan he had never thought of
JUDGE FRANK F. DAVIS, Who Nom
inated Gage.
playing at a place he had never
thought of being. He could have told
of th^ brigade he did not r-.ise and the
commission he did not get, for that the
cruel war was over before he and the
President had time to arrange these
thing-s. Chock full of eloquence, Hart
did not get a chance to speil, and there
Avere several others. It was really too
bad. To make matters worse some
country* delegate started the rumor
that Knight had flown the coop be
cause he did not care to enter upon an
oratorical contest after he saw the gait
Barnes had struck. Knight said later
that it was no such thing, and I prefer
to take his word against that of the
country delegate, whose favorite son
has been smitten neckwise by the mis
fortunes of political war.
This is written at noon. There is a
cheering 1 rumor that Reuben Lloyd has
shaken the slumber from his lids and
will be on hand to let the convention
know about the platform immediately
after lunch. It ought to be a good
platform for the element of haste has
been wholly absent from its prepara
tion.
The afternoon session was interesting.
This story should have begun .vith it,
but it could not wait. There was some
delay owing to the fact that Reuben
\ H. Lloyd had an important report to
! present, and had not completed his
lunch, so two thousand people waited
in tb^sweltering pavilion for him to
get through. I trust he enjoyed the
lunch, that it set well, and that on
the glad morn of resurrection the gen
tleman will not delay proceedings by
a similarly elegant leisure.
To speed the moments T. V. Eddy
made a speech, but with all respect for
him I could not notice that it speeded
them particularly.
At last Mr. Lloyd arrived, and the
clerk read the platform. It is a vol
uminous document, thoroughly Re
! publican, as anybody may observe.
â  The only fault reasonably to be found
j with it Is that it contains too many
i -words. I do not see the utility of em
' bodying in a platform an essay on ir
rigation when there is an understand
i ing on the part of everybody with the
years and sense to vote as to what ir
! rigation is. But the platform was
j American in every plank. It was se
i vere on Maguire, and it is instinct with
I patriotism. It did not contain a thing
j to which a Republican can object, but
! I cannot understand why the compila
â  tion of it should have required a num
ber of lawyers to sit up all night. Of
course it was adopted after it had been
applauded, and it deserved both the
applause and the adoption.
The effort to limit nominating
speeches ran against the frost belt and
collapsed. There were too many fonts
of Ciceronian eloquence bottled up to
stand any such effort as this to nip
genius.
T. G. Phelps nominated Pardee. He
is a man of commanding figure, bear
ing well the dignity of years. He
spoke calmly, sensibly and avoided
flubdubbery. Alameda rose in its seats

DE YOUNG AND BUNKER MURPHY EXCHANGE VIEWS.
to cheer the mention of Its leader's
name.
Judge Davis of Los Angeles, who
nominated Gage, was a different mold.
Small, self-contained, he is more an
elocutionist than an orator, and except
as the representative of the great
event of the crucial day would attract
little attention in a convention. But
he knew what he wanted to say, and
his grammar and gestures were fault
less. When he had finished Los An
geles went as wild as Alameda had
been a few moments before. Then
seconds began to pour in.
A fat man from the south projected
into the situation an element of comedy
which had been lacking. He had writ
ten a speech and proposed to read it.
As nobody could hear he did not re
ceive attention. There were cries of
"louder." The fat man lost his place,
but never his temper. He would go back
hunting for the lost place, and, having
found it, begin over again. At last his
friends pulled him down and drowned
him in a sea of mirth. He looked mild
ly astonished and settled in his cfcair
as a scuttled ship settles into the
ocean. There were suggestions that
the secretary read the speech, but it
went astray among a clamor of other
suggestions that the secretary re
frain, and I fear the world can never
know what the fat man Intended to
say.
People desirous of learning of all the
speeches will be oblieed to turn to an
other column. Fisher of Alameda made
one of them. There was a tendency
at first to regard him as a Joke, and
he struck Los Angeles on the funny
bone. Later he corrected the primal
impression and turned the laugh on the
south so neatly that the Gage delega
tion had to join in the chorus. Powers
of San Francisco hurled himself Into
an opening which few but himself had
been able to discern. He talked for a
while, and seemed displeased at cordial
invitations to quit, going so far as to
denounce some of his associates as
hoodlums. He seemed to be correct in
this, for not long after this two of
them engaged in a fight. Unfortunately
neither was hurt, and for some reason
both were allowed to remain in the
assemblage.
After Powers came the incident which
was to be the climax of the day and
of the convention. The assurance was
by this time complete that Gage was
to be the nominee, and Pardee ad
vanced to the platform. He could have
but one purpose, to tear down the ban
ner his followers had so valiantly up
held, to bury his own honorable am
bitions and to throw his strength to
his opponent. I could not help but ad
mire him, realizing that which he
was giving up, and I think his manly
and gracious act will be remembered
to his good at some later day.
Then Alameda cheered for its over
thrown but still erect champion, and it
was the voice of Alameda which first
proposed that the Gage nomination be
made unanimous. There were cheers
for Pardee, and cheers for Gage. Up
rose the multitude and gave utterance
to its feelings. There was more enthu
siasm in the few ensuing moments
than there had been in the whole Dem
ocratic convention of the week before.
It was the sort of enthusiasm which
we had expected to see, and yet to see
It come from all the delegates regard
less of whom they had supported in
the beginning was a surprise and a to
ken. The Alameda rooters, headed
and shouldered by lengthy Billy
Friend, marched around the hall sing
ing an improvised Gage sonp- and they
were applauded until people were
hoarse. There were three cheers pro
posed for Billy Friend, and Friend,
not noticing the words, but realizing
that cheers were due somebody or
something, swung his hat and yelled
as loudly as any one, a circumstance
which detracted nothing from the hi
larity of the occasion.
The formality of having an individ
ual cast the vote of. the convention was
then duly observed, not because there
was necessity for it, but because some
body said there was, and the success
ful candidate c^me upon the platform.
I had seen him before â a man of good
appearance, a strong face, a sturdy
figure and an abundance of dishev
eled hair. While the event would have
been one to inspire a speaker less emo
tional, Mr. Gage's feelings almost over
came him, and it was apparent that
whatever he might say there would be
no great speech from him while the tu
mult of his triumph had scarce died
away. He made a frank expression of
his gratitude and appreciation. He
gave to the party the pledge of his
honesty of purpose and his honor. He
was sincere, emphatic, at no moment
eloquent.
It was a sin of omission, easily for
given, that he should have neglected to
express publicly his knowledge that his
Alameda foe had capitulated without
malice and without disloyalty.
To name Jacob Neff for Lieutenant
Governor required a number of speeches
and for the nonce the temperature
seemed to rise. Neff was nominated
after Selvage had been eulogized. Reu
ben Lloyd made the Neff nomination,
using few words but Lloyd's manner
was indicative of the utmost confi
dence. He extolled Neff as a citizen
belonging to the whole of California.
The mood in which the audience re
ceived his laudation was indicative of
the ultimate outcome. Here George
Knight took the platform. When he said
he was opposed to programming there
was a snigger. Knight seemed to have
been displeased that The Call men, after
days among the politicians feelins the
pulse of them, interviewing the dele
gate from a distance, had been able to
predict with accuracy as to the nom
ination of Gage, and, as they had also
predicted that of Neff he wanted to fool
them. He spoke in the highest terms
of McGowan and McGowan himself
made a favorable impression, but the
votes fell to Neff. This was not until
both Eddy and Preston had made
warm remarks tending to convey the
idea that they were not taking any
tips from Mr. Knight. Thereupon did
both Knight and McGowan get swatted
harder and harder as the calling of the
roll progressed. At the end the duty
of casting the convention's 788 votes
for Neff fell to Mr. Preston, and the
large man from San Mateo cast them
with the air of one who had done a
deed of virtue and felt thereat a glow
of Joy. Mr. Neff, returning to the plat
form, made an address of thanks and
as the echo of the applause still lin
gered the crowd passed out, a recess
having been taken until 8 o'clock. At
that hour the opinion prevailed that
the work of the convention would be
completed to-night. The opinion also
prevailed that it wouldn't. At this mo
ment the two opinions still prevail and
have about equal weight.
The evening session opened with a
season of praise heaped upon aspirants
to the Supreme bench, all good men.
I doubt if they can be quite so good
as portrayed, however, else would they
be translated in chariots of fire and be
associated of the only really Supreme
Tribunal. The speeches were made by
lawyers, whose tongues are trained to
honeyed words, but in whose hearts
there is no guile. If they exaggerated
the terms of approbation it was not
with intent to deceive, but to give the
honeyed words a chance to drip and
dribble, charming the ear and lulling
to somnolence the listener. But there
was brightness and beauty to the
scene, for ladies were there, clad in the
catchy hues of summer, and kept
awake by the rustle of their own fans.
Neither must it be supposed that the
speeches were all mediocre. The worst
of the lot was more interesting than
the long roll call, and the best
of the lot was in respect of
eloquence, the best delivered by any
delegate during any part of the session.
This was the speech of T. B. Hutchin
-son of Napa in nominating Judge
Buckles.
Hutchinson has the rare faculty of
swaying his hearers until they regret
when he reaches the limit of his time
and feel impelled to cheer him as he
takes his seat. In honor of this orator
the house resolved itself into a tumult
of applause.
There was another gentleman finding
instant way into popularity. A. T. Mat
lock was the name by which he was
announced when he came forward to
nominate Judge Ellison. He is a genu
ine wit and there was a roar of
laughter into the vulnerable spots of
which Matlock projected remarks
which chased the quietude to such dis
tance that it did not come back until
Matlock had retired amidst a storm
of congratulations. There was consid
erable show of enthusiasm over the
contest for Secretary of State, but it
was not much of a contest after all as
Austin, so far as I could notice, was
never in it and the space between the
opening vote and the hullabaloo of the
Curry victors was short. As this is
written the racket continues and a look
of pain is flitting across the counte
nance of Jim Rea. Nevertheless the
Santa Clara people yielded with the
statutory extension of the glad hand,
which was heartily clasped.
STOCKHOLDERS' LIABILITY.
Important Decision in the Sullivan-
Fraternal Life Association Suit.
An important decision relative to the
liability of members of corporations hav
ing no capita! stock, for their separate
proportion of its debts and liabilities, was
nanded dov. n by Judge Seawell yester
day in the ease of Mary A. Sullivan
against John F. Merrill and some eighty
members of the Fraternal Life Associa
tion.
Mrs. Sullivan brought suit against the
various defendants to recover $9 37*4 from
each of them as payment on an insur
ance policy issued on March 10, 1891. on
the life of Martin G. Elmore in favor of
the plaintiff. Klmore died in September
of 1594, and suit was brought to recover
on the policy.
In the decision handed down yesterday
the court hold that in the case of French
vs. Teschemaker it was concluded that
the section of the constitution providing
that "each stockholder of a corporation
or joint stock association shall be individ
ually and personally liable fur his propor
tion of all its debts and liabilities" was
not self-executing, and that legislation
was necessary to ascertain the proportion
of debts and liabilities for which a stock
holder was liable. "Such considerations
have peculiar force In dealing with a cor
poration organized as was the Fraternal
Life Association, for the purpose of in
suring the lives of its members', and in
which the amount of premiums or as
sessments paid varies, .acording to the
amount of insurance and the age of the
member," reads the complaint. "The
certificate of membership annexed to the
agreed statement provides for varying
rates of premium or assessment. Is each
member liable for an equal amount ol
tne debts, or does his proportion depend
upon the amount of his interest or con
tribution? Upon this question the stat
ute is silent. If I should be justified in
holding that In case of members having
an equal interest they should be equally
liable for the debts, I cannot presume,
in the absence of either allegation or
proof that each of the defendants was
insured for the same amount, or that
the premiums paid by each was the same.
Judgment will be entered for defend
ants."

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 24. â The Republican
State convention is nearing the end of
its labors. Five of the executive of
ficers have been placed in nomination,
most of the distriot conventions have
made their choice and to-morrow the
remaining standard bearers of the par
ty will be chosen.
Events have crowded quickly upon
each other to-day. The convention hall
has been crowded morning, afternoon
and night. Scenes of excitement have
relieved the monotony of nominating
speeches and the enunciation of polit
ical principles. Several spirited con
tests for honors have been fought and
won. Henry T. Gage of Los Angeles
wil) make the race for Governor and
Jacob H. Iseff of Placer will be his
associate for the position of Lieutenant
Governor. Justices T. B. McFarland
and W. C. Van Fleet have received re-
nominations and Charles F. Curry will
strive for the position of Secretary of
State.
The renom!nation of Justice McFar
land has created a great deal of discus
sion and unfavorable comment. It is
openly charged that the railroad has
surreptitiously exerted an influence in
favor of McFarland and through its
power has secured for him the honor
sought.
Before the contest had progressed
far enough to suggest in McFarlands
candidacy a danger to the State The
Call sent forth a warning and a pro
test. Many of the delegates found an
answer to both, but their opposition
availed nothing. A majority of the
delegates placed the aged Judge upon
the ticket to add to it a weight that
will do it no good.
During the proceedings of the day-
George A. Knight furnished the inci
dent that created the greatest excite
ment. The convention had subsided
into comparative quiet after the storm
of enthusiasm that marked the nomina
tion and acceptance of Henry T. Gage.
Jacob H. Neff, the nominee for Lieu
tenant Governor, had been in the
hands of his friend for eulogy and ad-
vancement. Then George A. Knight
appeared on the scene to disturb the
deliberations and attack the motives of
the great body of delegates. Knight
and his allegations supplied an incident
that has had a few parallels in the his
tory of the State.
This excitement of the afternoon ses
sion furnished a theme for the most
earnest discussion among the dele
gates and the throngs of politicians
now assembled at Sacramento. When
George A. Knight presented himself on
the platform to rail at the convention
and insult by unsupported insinuations
the delegation of which he was a mem
ber, a murmur of anticipation was
heard throughout the great pavilion.
"Knierht would cease to exist," some
one said, "if he could not live on noto
riety. If his associates will not give
him the center of the stage he will
seize it and we may expect him to
adopt his customary plan."
The fear of the speaker was not un
founded. Knight arose to present the
name of one candidate and in the pre
sentation to disparage the aspiration of
another. He threatened the San Fran
cisco delegation with an expose of con
ditions of which the general body knew
nothing, and of which the speaker ex
plained nothing. He announced that
because his associates refused to ac
cept his domination they had fallen be
neath the sway of some one else. The
manner in which the insult was pub
licly cast created a great deal of excite
ment and intensified rather than modi
fied the angry mood of the convention.
But Knight persisted in attacking the
convention itself, charging the exist
ence of a "programme" and admitting
the startling fact that no public man in
California iÂ» a greater "programmer"
than he is if he be happy enough to be
on the "programme." The speaker's
confession upon a platform before near
ly two thousand people received the
response of a hiss and a sneer.
The members of the San Francisco
delegation were enraged and those of
the general conA'entlon were hurt. Both
felt the sting of the insult hurled at
themselves, and both resented in angry
words the clumsy attack that Knight
had made upon Neff, of whom no one
before had dared to speak aught ex
cept in tribute due to distinguished
ability and untarnished fame.
Many In the convention hall remem
bered that four years before George A.
Knight had been the "programmer"
chairman of the tlepublican State con
vention. Many remembered that even
as a "programmer" he violated his
tompact and his own public confession
to obey the contract implied in a "pro
grammer." The San Francisco delega
tion determined that under the condi
tion Knight's unwarranted bitterness
should be punished. At the conclusion
of the afternoon session of the conven
tion indignant groups of San Fran
ciscans gathered on the street corners
and in the hotel lobbies to discuss the
affair. It was proposed to call a spe
cial session of the delegation from the
metropolis to denounce Knight and
deny his insinuations.
Better counsels prevailed, however,
when the motive of the attack was
partly understood in the explanation
that Knight felt piqued because he had
not received the consideration of mem
bership on any of the convention com
mittees. He had publicly remarked the
circumstance and in a way to Indicate
his displeasure. Understanding this
the San Francisco delegation refrained
from any official notice of the attack.
The fact was called to the attention
of the delegates that Knight's only at
tempt to sustain his accusation was his
unjustified assumption that the fore
cast of nominees published this morn
ing in The Call was a "programme."
Knight learned later in the day that
the forecast was a prediction justified
by a careful poll of the convention and
an understanding of the combinations
made by the different aspirants for of
fice. The absolute accuracy of the fore
cast was mistaken by Knight for the
certainty of knowledge that a "slate"
would give. When the lawyer learned
his absurd mistake his mood changed
and all discussion of the incident In
which he had figured was allowed to
drop.
At the night session of the conven
tion there was another incident of more
than usual political meaning. In tho
contest for the nomination for Secre
tary of State the most formidable op
ponent of Charles F. Curry was Paul
P. Austin of San Jose. Austin had
many powerful friends in the conven
tion. He is admitted to be able, popu
lar and well fitted for the honor ho
sought. Possessing qualifications that
clothed him with an advantage, he was
handicapi^d by one serious and, as
events proved, fatal disadvantage. His
fight for political honor was managed
by Jim'Rea of San Jose, and as soon
as that fact was known the chances of
success had vanished for Austin. On
the other hand Curry's fortunes were

death in camp. Tears were brought to

orator's eloquence. The display of whlf 1

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 189 S.
Mr. Knight word came to the chairman
that the committee on platform and reso
lution would not be ready to report be
fore 1 o'clock p. m. In order to give dis
trict conventions a chance to dispose of
the work in hand the main convention,
on motion of E. C, Hart of Sacramento,
took a recess until 1 o'clock. .
The afternoon session of the convention
was enlivened by a scrap in the San
Francisco delegation. These words, or lit
tle dispute between Alex Truman and
Charles Morris, delegates from the Thir
ty-eighth District, were regarding the
vote for McGowan for Lieutenant Gover
nor. Blows were exchanged in which
Truman landed first on his adversary.
The convention got a little excited over
this illustration of metropolitan methods
of adjusting differences and order was
not restored until the chairman rapped
with great vigor. The combatants later
in the session shook hands and resumed
friendly relations.
Chairman Neff rapped the convention to
; order at 1:40. He announced that Reuben
H. Lloyd of San Francisco, chairman of
the committee on resolutions, was ready
to report, but Mr. Lloyd did not. appear
as advertised. There was another long
wait for him. Delegates called "time, 1
"time," and "Knight." The day wore on
and Knight came not. - \
To quiet the impatient audience Chair
man Neff stated that Mr. Lloyd, who had
been working steadily on the platform all
night and morning, was taking lunch in
order to obtain strength to read the reso
lutions.
Failing to bring on Knight, who was
again called for, cries went up for '.'Eddy,"
"Col. Eddy," "T. V. Eddy." Responding
to repeated applause Colonel Eddy step
ped to the platform and made a speech,'

Stone received applause as he "ascended

a speech. â¢'.-'- : -...," â  '. ;
Mr. Lloyd at length came. Pleading
hoarseness, he asked the secretary, Frank
D. Ryan, to read the platform. As the
reading progressed, signals of approval
greeted the frequent allusions to the
achievements of the army and navy In the
war with Spain. The name of President
McKinley was cheered. Declarations in
favor of retaining the conquered territory
if Porto Rico and the Philippines evoked
applause. Commendation of Senator Per-
kins and Representatives Loud. Barham
and Hllborn for supporting the annexa
tion of Hawaii was given by the audience.
The censure of Senator White and Rep
resentatlve Magulre was applauded.
The paragraph condemning Maguire for
accusing the Americans of piracy in seiz
ing Spanish ships was heartily cheered.
The denunciation of single tax .schemes
advocated by Magulre elicited hearty ap
plause. The plank urging the early con
struction of tht- Nicaraguan canal was
bailed with cheers. Many other salient
points in the platform commanded the
attention of the assembled delegates.
The report of the committee was on
motion of Mr. Lloyd adopted.
The way was now clear for the trans
action of the real business of the con
vention and the announcement of Chair
man Xeff that nominations for Governor
were in order was received with delight.
It was ruled that the roll of counties
should be called and each county having
a candidate should present his name.
Alameda, lirst on the roll, responded
by sending to the platform Timothy Guy
Phelps of Kan Mateo, who delivered a
speech of character and force, in which
he presented the merits of George C. Par
dee. The Alameda delegation responded
to the eulogy of the doctor In a brave
manner.
When Los Angeles was called, Frank F.
Davis went to the platform and made a
clear-cut address, setting forth the traits
and accomplishments of Henry T. Gage.
Mr. Davis is an apostle of the modern
school of oratory. He does not seek to
play on the emotions, but addresses his
remarks to the judgment of his listeners.
The nomination of Gage was seconded
by C. K. Stuart of San Diego. C. W.
Seamans of Los Angeles, Judge Short of
Fresno, Frank H. Powers of San Fran
cisco and A. B. Lemmon of Sonoma.
Tributes to the worth of Dr. Pardee were
spoken by Frank J. Solinsky of Cala
veras and P. M. Fisher Great enthusi
asm was excited, delegates rising in their
places and cheering when George C. Par
dee arose and walked toward the plat
form.
His commanding figure and superb
benring excited the admiration of all be
holders. The audience was eager to hear
what ho had to say. anticipating that
be would declare his purpose to with
draw. There was not a trace of bitter
ness or regret In the utterances of the
doctor. He withdrew from the contest
in the most graceful style and gained the
friendship of a host of Republicans
Cheers, prolonged and repeated, hailed
the loyal declarations of the retiring can
didate.
G. B. Daniplls, on behalf of the Alameda
delegation, then gained the recognition
of the chairman and moved that Henry
T. Gage be nominated by acclamation
Then another scene of cheering followed
The applause was tumultuous. When or
der was restored E. F. Preston of San
Mateo suggested to the chairman that
the law required the ballot of the con
vention to be cast. The secretary -was
directed to perform this function, but the
further point was raised that the secre
tary was not a member of the conven
tion. To keep the record clear and the
proceedings In due form Mr. Preston was
directed to cast the vote.
He made the simple announcement: "I
cast 7SB votes for Henry T. Gage of LO9
Angeles."
Chairman Neff then declared Henry T.
Gage to be the nominee of the conven
tion for Governor.
George C. Pardee, E. F Preston and
L. H. Brown were assigned to the duty
of escorting the nominee to the platform.
The remaining proceedings were here di
versified by the advent of the Alameda
rooters, headed by their leader, William
Friend. They bore the banner of Ala
meda County, and created a fine senti
ment in the convention. They were cheer
ed to the echo when they stood in the
center aisle and sang this campaign
song as revised to meet the new situa
tion:

The chairâ The next business in order is
the report of the committee on platform
and resolutions. I am informed that it
will be twenty or twenty-flve minutes be
fore that committee will be ready to re
port. I want to say to you that upon the
platform are some of the greatest and
best speakers of the State, and during the
interim, while we are waiting, I think a
speech from General W. H. L.. Barnes
would be very acceptable. (Applause and
cheers.)
Gentlemen, it is not necessary for me to
introduce to you General Barnes. He is
known to every one of you. 1 propose
three cheers for General Barnes. Give
them with a will.
The convention responded in an earnest
manner.
General Barnes then delivered an ad
dress which is published in full in another
column.
At the close of General Barnes' address
calls were made for George A. Knight,
but that gentleman could not be found.
The chair â When 1 suggested that a
speech from General Barnes Is always
pleasant, I notified Mr. Knight that his
turn would come next, but it came too
soon and he has slipped out. Now I am
sorry that Mr. Knight is not here.
A delegate â What's the matter with
Joe Campbell.
The chairâ Bring Joe Campbell here
and we will hear him. Mr. Campbell. I
have Just been informed, is on the com
mittee on platform, and that committee
â will not be able to report until 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Of course for that I am
not responsible, and I suggest to you that
unless some other matters shall be pre
sented that we had better take an ad
journment until that hour. On motion of
Judge Hart the convention took a recess
until this afternoon at 1 o'clock.
The convention was called to order at
1:30 p. m.
The report of the committee on platform
and resolutions not being ready, and the
chairman of said committee not being
present, Colonel Eddy was called upon to
address the convention during the interim,
and responded as follows:
Colonel Eddy â Mr. Chairman and gentle
men of the convention, I desire to ac
knowledge my grateful thanks for your
kindness in calling upon me on this occa
sion. I realize the fact that you are all
impatientâ as am I â for the appearance of
Mr. Lloyd with the platform of tho prin
ciples which we expect to adopt here to
day, so that we may proceed with the
business before the convention. In the
interim perhaps I may say a few words
regarding my ideas of the campaign that
is now opening before us, and if I may be
permitted to say anything that will have
a tendency to increase the enthusiasm of
those who are before me and compose this
convention I shall be glad indeed. If
there is anything extraneous to the grand
principles of the Republican party whfch
would have a tendency to kindle profound
enthusiasm in the hearts and breasts of
those who would come beneath the grand
banner of that party and keep step to the
music of Republicanism it is to stand be
fore such a magnificent assemblage as is
here gathered together and look into the
faces of the intelligent representatives of
the greatest political party that ever ex
isted in the history of the world. [Ap
plause.] Gentlemen, this is a Republican
year. The stars are fighting for the Re
publican party and it.s principles this
year. The banner under which we march
is the banner of Republicanism, and the
Republican party is as sure of success.
I believe, in the great State of California
as that an election shall occur, if no mis
takes are made in the deliberations of this
body. If no mistakes are made here to
day and before the conclusion of the lie
liberations of this body, then indeed will
the "Mene mene tekel npharsen" that
appeared in letters of light upon the festal
walls tip the startle.) gaze of the Babylon
lan Kings be as nothing but the fantastic
dream of a disordered mind compared
with the handwriting on the wall that will
appear to lead the giant of Democracy
and Populism, and they will not need any
Daniel to interpret it, either. [Ar-"iause
and cheers.]
I had the great fortune to be upon the
floor of what I consider the most mem
orable national convention that was ever
held under the auspices of the Republican
party, save perhaps one. In ISBO, I had
the "fortune to listen to the magnificent
and matchless eloquence that came pour
ing forth from the lips of the majestic
Conkllng. I heard the words that came
seething from the patriotic fires that
raged within the walls of the great Lo
gan; I heard the words of wisdom that
camo from Harrison; from all those
groat leaders, but 1 remember distinctly
that after all was said by these great
orators there arose a man in that con
vention, perhaps more majestic, more im
pressive in his mion than any that had
gone before him. It was immortal Gar
tield (prolonged applause) and from his
lips came the solemn words of admoni
tion. He said to tho assembled dele
gates: "Gentlemen, it is not in the
midst of an enthusiastic convention such
as this that the great battle that is upon
us is to be won, but it is by the fire
side of the lowly and the great, the rich
and the poor, the farmer, the artisan
and the banker, by the fireside and at
the polls on election day that that great
question is to be determined and solved
as to whether or not success shall crown
the efforts of the Republican party."
Lot me borrow those words from the
Immortal Garfleld, and admonish you,
gentlemen, taking some admonition your
self, that if we make no mistakes, if we
avoid contention, if we avoid difficulties,
if we go before the people of the State
of California united as a people, with a
ticket that shall command the respect of
all alike, success, as sure as the sun
shall rise on election day, will crown the
Republican party of the State of Cali
fornia. (Great applause.)
In conclusion, as I see the chairman of
the committee here, let me say to you
that no longer should we allow California
to be misrepresented in the T'nited States
Senate and in Congress. (Applause.)
No longer should a man who does not
represent the progressive spirit of the
grand citizenship of the State of Cali
fornia be allowed in the gubernatorial
chair in this city. fGreat applause.)
Finally, California should grasp zhe ban
ner, afhd assume her rightful position at
the head of the column carrying the ban

Successful Before the Convention.
ner of Republicanism on to triumph, so
that from new on no man should hesi
tate to say whether California is a Dem
ocratic or Republican State. (Applause.)
The Chairâ Now. gentlemen, we are
about to listen to the reading of the
platform drafted by your committee, and
I hope tt;at you will observe perfect or

(Mr. Phelps 1 address is published in full
in another column.)
After the speeches nominating Mr. Gage
and Dr. Pardee had been made and the

of the convention.
The chair â Gentlemen, it affords me
more than pleasure to introduce to you
the Hon. George C. Pardee of Alameda.
Mr. Pardeeâ Mr. Chairman and Gentle
men: To say that I feel honored by your
reception of me would be to put it mild
ly. Beggar that I am. lam even poor
in thanks. I come before you to-day as
a Republican of the Republican banner
county of this great State of ours. From
sunny Shasta on the north to San Diego
on the south, from the west where the
waves of the Pacific leap upon our shores
to where the barriers of the great Si
erras stand, clad in eternal snow, there
is no more loyal county for the Repub
lican party in this State than is the
county from wnich I hail. (Applause
and cheers.) Its loyalty to the party ha 3
been tested upon many n'elds of battle,
and it lias never wavered in the contest.
Whenever the fate of battle was hanging
trembling in balance. Alameda County
stepped into the breach and rescued the
Republican party from defeat. (Ap
plause.) 1 feel that every loyal Repub
lican, coming from the north or from the
south, should hold above all personal am
bition, above all the love he hasÂ« for his
country, that greater love which he
should hold for his party. I believe that
the Republican party to-day, if it pre
emmv, will win tile day. There tore^ui
ordef that there may be no question as
to the Utter harmony of this convention
and the party behind it, I ask that my
name be withdrawn, and that the solid
vote of this contention be given to Henry
T. Gage of Los Angeles. (Applause and
cheers.)
Three cheers were proposed for George
C. Pardee, and given with a wai.
Mr. Daniellsof Alameda â Mr. Chairman,
on behalf of the friends of Dr. Pardee, I
move you, sir. that the nomination of
Henry T. Gage of Los Angeles be made
by acclamation.
Motion seconded and carried unani
mously.
Three cheers were then proposed and
given for Henry T. Gage.
Mr. Prestonâ Mr. Chairman, I move
you that the secretary of this convention
be instructed by the convention to cast
its ballot for Henry T. Gage for Gover
nor. Motion seconded and carriefl.
The secretary. Mr. Chairman, I have
the honor to cast 788 votes of this conven

FUGITIVE WILLIES GARBAGE.
WHEN the fact was made known that the circu
lation of the Examiner in this city was carried
on largely through the garbage crematory, it
was everywhere recognized that the practice entailed
a drain upon the fast vanishing estate, which,
small as it was, the fugitive Mr. Hearst would sooner
or later have to cut down. Such of the people, there
fore, as take an interest in the capers of the faker
waited to see what was going to happen.
They did not have to wait long. It was soon noted
that the Examiner circulation was diminishing. Ac
cording to the statements of the affidavit "swear man"
of the Examiner itself the circulation was reduced
more than 5000 copies inside of two months. That
wa>. something saved on the garbage bill of the con
cern, but it appears it was not enough.
The Examiner now maintains that its garbage
should be burned at the expense of the public. In
an editorial it stated yesterday: "The cremation of
garbage is a public function that should be performed
by the municipal government. In the larger cities of
the East and in Europe the refuse is collected from
private houses and destroyed at public expense.'"
The meaning of the new movement of the faker is
plain. The fugitive Hearst desires to impose upon
the people the cost not only of the copies of the
Examiner they may be deluded into buying, but also
that of burning those he sends to the crematory. He
would now like to have all his garbage unloaded
upon the municipality, and eventually he will concoct
a scheme to make the city buy his siren.
The proposition as put forth by the faker
will be opposed by all taxpayers, but if it
were amended so as to include the whole issue of the
paper with all the plant and the siren in the general
term of garbage, the people would be well nigh unani
mous in favor of the project. Let the fugitive Willie
make a clean sweep of his premises and send the en
tire outfit to the crematory' and the city will gladly
pay the cost of the burning.
JAMAICAN PLEBISCITE.
DISPATCHES from Jamaica announce that
when the sugar conference assembles at Bar
badoes in September to consider the interests
of the sugar-growers of the British West Indies a
proposition will be submitted from Jamaica request
ing permission from Parliament for the people of that
island and of the British West Indian colonies gene
rally to arrange for annexation to the United States.
Jt tr stated the Jamaica people will endeavor at the
conference to induce the other colonies to act with
them in the proposed movement, but if they fail in
that they will act alone. They have, it seems, ex
hausted all means of obtaining from Great Britain
protection for their industry, have lost hope of ever
getting such protection, and now are desirous of
separating themselves from the empire and becoming
a part of the great American republic.
The movement is the result of changes recently
t>r<. ught about in the sugar industry by the enormous
increase in the output occasioned by bounties in Ger
many and France and protection in the United States.
The sugar-planters of the British West Indies under
free trade have found themselves ruined. Parliament
has long had their claims under consideration, but
has not been able to find a way to remedy their evil
plight.
A duty on foreign sugar entering Great Britain
would help the West Indian colonies, but all parties
in Parliament are wedded to free trade and such a
proposition would be rejected at once. Equally futile
have been all suggestions of subsidies. An attempt
was made recently to induce France and Germany to
abandon their bounty system, but nothing came of it.
At present, therefore, the sugar-planters of Jamaica
can see no escape from ruin except by annexation to
the United States, where they would have the bene
fits of protection.
The proposed plebiscite may partake of the nature
of a bluff in some respects and be put forward to
force the hands of Parliament. It is probable, how
ever, the project is seriously entertained. A British
precedent for the surrender of the West Indian colo
nies is to be found in tJie surrender of the British pos
sessions among the lonian Islands to Greece some
years ago. The proposition therefore might find favor
in England itself. It is consequently one that may
become a question of practical politics with ourselves,
nnd we may yet count the British as well as the Span
ish West Indies among our colonial possessions.
Announcements that a certain actress is near
death's door come with just the same regularity as
the denials. Space rates are too high, too, but per
haps in this instance special rates are made by reason
of the magnitude of the contract.
Possibly J. Aubrey Jones was less surprised at his
nomination than he thinks he was. If the nomination
really startled him election would shock him to death,
and it behooves his friends to see him protected.
If the Spanish Government is displeased with
Blanco he may count [ himself _as without friends.
Everybody else began to get displeased with him long
ago.
THE CONVENTION'S HEAD.
THE Republican convention showed a good head
in getting a good head when it chose Neff for
president.
No man commands in a higher measure the confi
dence and esteem of the State. He is an officer of
' the old guard, such a man as Parks of Yuba was in
his prime.
When Neff says a thing is so it is so. and that ends
it. With all the moral power of a clean record and
the advantage of an acquaintance in numbers and
quality second to none enjoyed by any public man in
the State, it was not in the power of the combined
anti-Gage field to beat him for the chairmanship of
the convention.
It must be admitted, in all fairness, that it was the
favor with which gentlemen like Neff looked upon
Mr. Gage's candidacy that commended it to the con
vention. His record has been so perfectly independ
ent, so free from that fever of ambition which dements
men and turn politics into typhoid, that others were
ready to take his judgment and follow where he was
willing to lead.
The convention could not possibly stray beyond
public confidence with such a guide, and that it
placed itself in a position where its good faith cannot
be doubted is due to such expressions of its character
and purpose as his election to the chairmanship.
It is a most notable certificate for a candidate to
carry the nomination and commission of a convention
organized by Jake Neff. and the party is fortunate in
the first formal act of its representative body.
It causes a torrent of slanders to die in the throats
of their utterers and withers such as have already be
fouled the air. If the pinto forces intend to make a
personal campaign, as was indicated by their organ,
they must revise their plans and go to judgment on
the principles they profess. Having promulgated
platforms which attack every institution of society
and government and civilization, they must fight it
out with those who believe in representative govern
ment, in the rights, of property and the necessity of
their judicial protection.
The Republican party and its candidate will sup
port the public credit, the international dignity of the
republic and the fireside rights of the people.
On these lines the campaign must be fought and
not on personal innuendo and misrepresentation, for
the convention was so begun, conducted and closed
as to make this impossible and impolitic.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRODE.
STUDENTS of commercial statistics have noted
that despite the vast increase in our exports of
recent years our trade with South American
countries remains virtually at a standstill. The fact
would not be a surprising one if the commerce of
those countries showed no evidence of expansion in
any direction, for it would then be in the natural or
der of things. It happens, however, that the trade of
South America with European nations, and particu
larly with Germany, is growing rapidly. It is there
fore clear that the stagnation of our business with
those countries is largely if not mainly our own fault.
Several theories have been advanced to account for
this condition of affairs and several suggestions
made as to the best means of obtaining our rightful
share of South American business. A strong body
of influential men are of the opinion that the chief ob
stacle in the way of our trade with those countries is
the lack of proper banking facilities, and they pro
pose to establish an international bank with branches
in the larger South American cities. Another class
hold that by proper reciprocity treaties we can gain
an increase of trade, and these are eager that such
treaties should be arranged as speedily as possible.
Much can be said in favor of these views. Each of
them has a solid basis of fact to rest upon. It is
doubtful, however, if both remedies combined would
be sufficient to advance our trade to any great ex
tent unless another factor is added to them. Com
merce is carried on by ships, and to compete in for
eign trade with the great nations of the world we
must have a merchant marine equal to that of any of
the great nations.
A good deal of light is thrown upon the subject by
a recent report from our Consul at Chemnitz, who,
after giving statistics showing the rapid growth of
German commerce, says: "If we are to take part in
the trade with South America and with the East we
must emulate this empire in the matter of ships. Of
all the ships that came into and went out of German
ports in 1896. 72.4 per cent bore the empire's flag.
Of the steamers 68.3 per cent were German."
Conceding all in the way of benefits that may be
derived from an international bank or from reci
procity treaties, the fact remains that we must have
American ships if we expect to have an extensive
American commerce. We are now paying tribute to
foreign ship-owners to carry our exports to market
and to bring imports to our shores. It is a wasteful
policy in a double respect, for it hampers our com
merce with many countries and compels us to pay
heavily for such commerce as we carry on with
others.
A large expansion and extension of our merchant
marine is the imperative need of the country. Our
industries are productive beyond our power to con
sume. We must find for them new markets, and we
must provide ships to carry' them to market. When
that has been accomplished we need have no fear of
German or British competition in South America.
When we have emulated the example of Great Britain
and Germany in promoting a merchant marine our
ships will carry our flag to every port in the world,
and trade will go with the flag.
There was no real harm in the ovations extended
to Cervera except the danger that the enthusiastic
populace would be charged with being a lot of asses,
and some people are so constituted as not to mind a
little thing like that.
Mrs. Botkin's opinion that anonymous letters
necessarily come from an underbred person stamps
her as a woman of discernment, and will naturally
create some sympathy for her in her trouble.
When churches complain that the Salvation Army
prevents their growth a counter charge that the
churches hinder the growth of the army would be
received with toleration.
Cuba is not demonstrating a right to be free. On
the contrary, the Cubans are trying to prove that they
deserve about six months apiece for petty larceny.
Jim Rea's candidates will have to come to the front
with some betteT backing than the fact that they are
the property of the gentleman from San Jose.
Everybody will give the Pardee men credit for yell
ing with as much enthusiasm as a lot of college root
ers at a football game.
The fact has been established that a Californian Re
publican convention knows the stars and stripes when
it sees them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1898.
WITH an eye on the clock and mindful of the
lapse of time, Judge Maguire has accepted the
Populist nomination and signed the Populist
platform.
The letter is a singular evidence of the Judge's
mental and moral peculiarities. He says: "I take
pleasure in advising you that I have accepted the
platform adopted by the convention, and herewith
return the same signed as requested by your com
mittee."
Of course this means that he accepts and adopts
the principles of the Populist platform as his princi
ples. He accepts State communism, a limitless issue
of irredeemable paper currency and all the fads and
fancies that are the warp and woof of that platform.
Having squared himself with the communists and
the advocates of "a more and a fittener currency," the
Judge continues: "I am pleased to state that upon a
careful reading of your platform and a com
parison of its terms with those of the plat
form adopted by the Democratic party, I find they
substantially agree in all matters relating to the func
tions of the office of Governor, and that they are not
in any respect inconsistent."
The first clause of that sentence is conceived in a
feeling of solicitude for the scruples of old-time
Democrats, who smart under the destruction of their
party in Oregon and Washington and the disappear
ance of its name as a result of fusion. The Judge de
sired to so frame a sentence as to limit the agree
ment of the platforms to the functions of Governor.
But before he finished fear of the wild Populist over
came him and he wrote, "And that they are not in
any respect inconsistent."
His friends may try to conciliate scrupulous Demo
crats by insisting that this clause merely refers to
their agreement as to the functions of the Governor.
But the word "any" shuts out this desirable interpre
tation. If he had used "that" instead of "any" the last
clause of the sentence would have plainly been limited
to the functions of the Governor.
As it stands he finds the Democratic platform to
be expressive of Populist principles, and he is there
fore able to stand on the two as one platform.
This being his judgment, what use is there in keep
ing up the appearance of two parties? If the princi
ples of Populism and Democracy are identical, why
sail in two ships? Why duplicate organizations
and headquarters? Why not accept Maguire's judg
ment and go under one name and one organization?
If the Populist principles of this year's Democratic
platform are to be its principles next year and the
next, why not say so?
If, however, these principles are put on this year
only, as a disguise, as Black Bart used a flour sack
when he desired to rob a stage, the Populists are wise
in remaining on guard and watching the treasure
box.
As his benediction and doxology the Judge says
that he approves the purpose of the fusion, and will
earnestly devote himself to its accomplishment. Now,
as he finds the platforms identical, we must go to
them in search of the purpose to which the Judge so
fervently consecrates himself. Looking over the list.
he will support the constitutional amendment for lo
cal option in taxation by which it is intended to put it
in the power of a majority in any county in the State
to take away the land from its owners without any
compensation. In his discussion with the Duke of
Argyle Henry George declared that the single tax
meant the confiscation of all the land in private
ownership. Confiscation means taking the land with
out compensation. He will, inconsistently with his
single tax ideas, support the income tax demanded
by the Populists. He will support the free coinage
of silver at 16 to I, and also the unlimited issue of
irredeemable paper currency, which would drive both
silver and gold out of circulation under the Gresham
law. He will support Government ownership of all
public utilities, railroads, gas, water, telegraphs, tele
phones, coal, gold and silver mines, and, of course,
under land confiscation, of the land itself. That is to
say, he adopts the cry of the French communist,
"Property is robbery," and proposes that there shall
be no private property at all. As the campaign
progresses the other purposes to which he dedicates
himself by accepting these two platforms will be dis
cussed.
WHILE the attention of the people gene
rally has been directed to the events
of the war with Spain, the far-sighted
leaders of our commerce and industry have
not overlooked the need of preparing for a suit
able exhibit of our products at the coming exposition
in Paris. There has not been much public talk of the
work in this direction, but nevertheless a great deal
of work appears to have been accomplished.
According to the latest reports more than 600 ap
plications from Americans have been made for space
at the exposition. The fear once prevalent in Paris
that the United States might not make a full display
hat now been changed to a fear that the exposition
authorities will not be able to grant the room needed
for the exhibit we propose to make. It is said that
in order to meet as far as possible the demand that
has been made upon him Commissioner Peck is to
ask from the French officials 500.000 square feet of
space instead of the 150,000 originally set aside for
American exhibits.
The zeal displayed thus early in the work of prepar
ing for the exposition is another evidence of the
energy and enterprise of our merchants and manu
facturers. The war, so far from weakening our in
dustrial and commercial impulses, has stimulated
them. The value and the variety of our exports of
manufactured goods have been long increasing, and
by the great nations of the earth we are now felt as
the most potent of competitors in all lines of in
dustry.
This has been the inevitable outcome of our rapid
development in manufacturing arts. With an expand
ing output of products there is a need for an expand
ing market. Commerce must keep pace with pro
ductive industry, or industry will cease to be profit
able. It is therefore a matter of great importance to
us to make at Paris an exhibit of goods which will
win the favor of consumers in all parts of the globe.
It is certain the great mass of people who visit
Paris during the exposition will pay more attention
to the American exhibit than has been given to our
exhibits at any previous display of the kind. We oc
cupy a larger place in the commercial and industrial
world than ever before, and the war has given us
more prestige in the domain of international politics.
Our displays will no longer be overlooked at a uni
versal exposition by any class of people.
In the Eastern States these things are understood,
and the people of that section are preparing for the
coming competition with the world at Paris. Cali
fornia should be equally alert.
Theorizing against forest fires will be found, useful
as it is. less effective than sending a few specimen
arsonists to jail.
"Our flag now waves proudly over Hawaii" re
marks an evening paper. Well, at least it waves.

In looking for work, and after nearly
losing his eyesight In the effort, he final
ly heard by chance that a boy was
wanted to tend the office of the Weather
Bureau, which Is situated on the top floor
of the Mills building, to which place he
repaired forthwith. The youngster was
in blissful ignorance of the swift run
ning elevators in the building which
would have whisked him up to his des
tination in less than a Jiffy, and armed
with his directions and In eager haste
be bravely started to walk up the ten
flights of stairs. He felt no fatigue un
til after he had climbed the sixth flight
and his movements of necessity became
somewhat slower. At the eighth his
courage commenced to fail him and he
was on the point of turning back, but
visions of that three-dollar-a-week posi
tion flashed through his mind and he
stuck to his task like a little man. When
he had passed the ninth flight he was
obliged to sit down from sheer exhaus
tion, but the short rest having strength
ened him he went up the tenth and last
flight in a hop, step and a jump. After
locating the rooms of the weather offi
cials, he opened the door and putting in
his head, he said in plaintive accents to
Prophet Hammon, who was busy fixing
up the weather for the next day, "Say,
Mister, is God in?"
Needless to state the youngster was
engaged on the spot.

LOVE'S DREAM WRECKED.
They were swinging In a hammock.
He and she;
Gentle winds were sweetly blowing
O'er the lea.
He was strong and brave and handsome.
She was sweet.
And he kept the hammock going
With his feet.
Would you know the tale he told her.
As they swung?
Ah, It was the sweet, old story â
They were young.
E'en the leaves. It seemed, were bending
Down to hear
Those fair words that he was pouring
In her ear.
E'en the birds and gentle breeies
Seemed to stay,
Charmed by what that gallant lover
Had to say.
Unto her It seemed a lovely-
Waking dream.
But, at length, she left the hammock
With a scream.
In a trice her airy castle
Was a wreck â
She had found a caterpillar
On her neck.

state of preservation.
CORNSâ T. M.. City. If you are
troubled with corns in the manner de

held that a contract made on Sunday is

AMERICAN REGIMENT OR CREWâ
Constant Reader. City. To answer the
question. "Have we a regiment 62 soldiers
composed entirely of American born or a
battle-ship's crew all American born?"
would require an examination of the mus
ter roll of each company in each regiment
of the United States army, regular and
volunteer; the same with the navy's mus
ter roll of each battle-ship: and as this
department has neither the time nor the
opportunity to make such an examination,
the answer cannot be furnished.
TECHNICAL DESIGNâ H. H. M.. San
Jose, Cai. The California School of Me
chanical Arts in San Francisco has a
course of technical design, but it is re
tricted at the school for lack of facilities
for executing designs for oil cloths, fab
rics, stained glass, wall paper, mural dec
orations, etc., but this defect is corrected
as far as possible by frequent visits to
factories and by inquiry among manufac
turers. The school has means for execut
ing designs in wood, clay, terra cptta and
iron, so the fundamental law of design is
deduced from the work done in these ma
terials.

THE STANDARD THEATERâ W. R.
M., Los Angeles. Cal. The Standard The
ater, as the Standard, closed April 10,
1886, with a farewell performance Riven
by Reed's minstrels. It was reopened on
the 29th of May of the same year as
Haverly's Theater, and performances
were given until the 15th of June. On
the 30th of August of that year It was re
opened as Emerson's Standard, and re
mained open as such until the 13th of

minstrel troupe gave a variety show, con
cluding with "Nana, or the Blonde Ve
nus." It was announced that the "Robes

loth of November, but the dally papers
do not give any notice of the perform
ance, and there appears no advertisement
of the place after the 13th. After that
there were a few performances given In
the place, but It would require a month's
search through the files of the papers
to ascertain what those performances
were.

The Earth's Crust in Motion.
John Milne, late professor of seismol
ogy at the University of ToJcio, tells a
writer in McClure's Magazine that during
an earthquake the earth's crust rises and
falls just as the ocean does. "You see,
the earth's crust is very elastic; it is con
stantly quivering and pulsatory, I might
almost say breathing. The earth fre
quently comes up three Inches right under
us and then goes down three inches. We
do not see or feel it because it moves so
slowly and evenly; fifteen seionds, per
haps, for the lift, and as many more for
the descent. And then the waves are so
longâ several miles between two crestsâ
that everything about us rises and falls
together; half of all London heaves up
and settles down with a single breathing.
These waves do not travel around the
earthâ they travel through the earth;
that is one of the most important discov
eries we have made. If they were trans
mitted in the earth's crust around tne
circumference we should get two recoras
for every earthquake â one coming tne
shortest way round, the other coming the
longest way; for, of course, these wave
movements would be propagated in- bom
directions. Waves through the air, for
instance, from volcanic explosions, al
ways come to us both ways around the
earth, the one being recorded after the
other. We never get two records of
earthquakes, we only get one; so we con
clude from this and other reasons that
the transmission is straight through the
earth."

. To the Republican State Convention
âGentlemen: Your committee on
platform and resolutions begs leave to
report the following. Respectfully,
' REUBEN H. LLOYD. Chairman.
â  Sacramento, Cat, Aug. 24, 1898.
. The Republican - party of California. In
State convention assembled at Sacramento.
this :3d day of August. MM, as expressive
Â«â ' its views upon the political questions of
the day, and a* a platform upon which all
the candidates of the Republican party in
California shall stand, does hereby respire:
. 1 That we reaffirm our belief in and ad
herence to the statement of the principles
of the Republican party as adopted at the
. national ' convention, held in St. Louis In
.June, 1596 Time has tested the strength â¢
and proved the truth of the doctrines there
in enunciated, while the country at large
â¢' ha's u"nder the Influence of their enforcement
"grown in ricbea and happiness.
â  In behalf of ourselves and of the Republi
can party of this State we thank those brave
'sailors and soldiers of the great army and
â  navy ol the republic that have achieved
such" brilliant victories, wnlle marching be
'â  hind ' the star-spangled banner, and who
have made the American flag respected
'and honored In every quarter of the world.
We congratulate the nation upon the fact
that it has produced such leaders upon the
' ocean as Dewey, Sampson, Schley â¢ and
'Hobson and upon the land as Miles,
Shatter, Wheeler and Lawton, who have
written their names upon the scroll of the .
history of the world as leaders excelled by
.none and equaled by few since the begin
ning of time.
Their genius, however, would have been
unavailing but for the valor and steadfast
ness to duty displayed by the sailors who.
-for many long months, were , jnnnned to
â¢* the narrow limits of their snips in the
heat of the tropics: and the soldiers who
laced death not merely by the bayonet,
' the rifle or the cannon, but by dread dls
â¢ ease in Cuba, and Who have proved that
the American makes the best citizen in
â  peace and the best fighter in war of any
nation upon the civilized globe, and we re
pudiate with indignation the accusation
made by -he Democratic candidate for
Governor of this State at the commence
ment of the late war that the seizure as
prizes of war by the gallant sailors of our
. . navy of certain Spanisn vessels was no
better than piracy.
We rejoice In the deeds of these sailors
and' soldiers, admirals and generals, and
. pledge to them and thetr ramiltes the un- \
dying" gratitude of the American people,
whose-spirits have been exalted by the
spectacle-of the flag of the Union borne in
' triumph around the habitable globe by the
army and navy of the United States.
The victories won by our sailors and
soldiers at .Manila and Santiago, and the
. consequent acquisition of new territory,
" have . increased our national horizon and
imposed new and great duties upon us. To
â : properly care for what we have conquered,
to adequately protect American citizens en
gaged In travel or business abroad, to ap
propriately . guard .our national honor and ...
make our flag the safeguard of all who seek
the shelter of its folds, demands of us a
" navy large enough to compel foreign nations
â¢ whether savage or civilized âto recognize
'the claim of American citizenship wherever
made., â¢ as â¢ entitling the claimant to safety
'.'and protection for his property, his business
. an<l his person.
â¢ We pledge our Senators and Representa
â¢ lives in Congress and our candidates and 1
-.our-party to work and vote to secure the
building of an adequate navy, as recom
mended by the present Republican Secretary,
of.the Navy, and request that a proportion- .
ate. share thereof be constructed on the Pa
cific Coast.
ThÂ» wisdom of the people's choice in I*Â» 6
has been made more and more apparent as
"time' progresses. The patriotic devotion to
his country which called our candidate. in
that 'campaign, to the ranks of its soldiers
â¢ in the' hour of rebellion., has characterized
his ever}- act 'since inauguration as Presi
dent. He has remembered the claims of
his' friends and his party, but never at the
expense-of the nation. He has protected
the credit and maintained the honor of the
' United States. His firmness prevented the
-mistake of recognizing Cuban belligerency
â¢and the plunging of the country into war
unprepared: while his untiring activity since
the war was declared has made possible the
glorious -successes we have achieved on land
and on sea. He has proved himself equal
' In-diplomacy to the astute minister! of the
â¢ Old World and has Inaugurated the reign
â¢ of honesty and fair dealing in the diplomacy
. "of the age. Each day adds to his glory and
deepens the satisfaction we have in the
Republican we nominated and elected in
â  18S6. whore official career since March 4.1857,
' ' is approved by all classes and parties, and
whom all delight to honor as President.
William McKinley.
We congratulate the people of the United
States upon the fact that the broad Ameri
can policy of our President. William McKln
ley. has dissipated all sectional issues. His
policy both as to the leaders and the rank
â and "file, and In all matters pertaining to
â¢'..â  late war has been of the broadest and
most patriotic character, so that side by
Â«ide for a common flag and a common cause
â¢ have marched and fought the son of our
. jepartP'l hero and patriot. U. S. Grant.
â¢ Fitzhugh Lee, Shafter and Joe Wheeler,
and â  the boys who wore the blue and the
'boys'who wore the gray. All under the old
flag and for patriotic love of country, so
that to-day we are In truth and In fact, In
' peace-and in war, one united people.
We /eaffirm our belief In the financial

inee of the Sixth District.
plank of the Republican national platform
of 1886 as being a sound and correct ex
position of the views of the Republican
party upon the finances of the country.
We commend the efforts of the national ad
ministration to secure an International
monetary agreement and urge that the at
tempts be renewed whenever an opportu
nity to do so shall be presented.
' We call attention to the fact that since
the return of the Republican party Into
power, the balance of trade has changed
in i:. more than $<00.000,000 against the
United Stales to about $550,000.000 In our
favor, and all of this Is due to the wise
and conservative financial policy adopted
and her- 1 to by the Republican Con
gress and President. We commend Presi
dent McKinley for his refusal to consider
any proposition looking to the assumption
of the Spanish-Cuban debt.
The United States in the pursuit ' of its
purpose of freeing the people of Cuba from
Spanish misrule has taken possession of
that 1.-land and also of Porto Rico and
other West India islands and of the Phil
ippines. The Kepublican party of Cali
fornia is in h?arty sympathy with the de
clared policy of the President to accord to
the people of Cuba an opportunity to form
a stable government, thus redeeming the
promise made to the world.
The national welfare demands the reten
tion of the island of Porto Rico and other
West India islands coming under our con
trol, and of the Philippines. In order to
permit the expansion of American trade,
and in case of the latter to safeguard the
commerce already secured in the Orient.
In the event of the retention of this for
eign territory it should be the policy of
the United States to extend to it the bene
fit of free commercial Intercourse with all
sections of the American Union and to
that end the provision of the constitution
requiring "that all duties, imposts and ex
cises shall â ' be uniform throughout the
United States" should be rigidly enforced.
We pledge th? nominees of the Republican
party In the various Congressional dis
tricts in the State to use their utmost ef
forts. If. elected, to secure the speedy ex
tension of the revenue system of the United
States to the Islands of Porto Rico and the
Philippines, that all parts of our country
may enjoy the benefits or' trade intercourse
with our new acquisitions on the same
terms that now prevail throughout the en
tire Union.
All legislative candidetesof the Republican
party are hereby pledged to choose a United
States Senator who. In dealing with the
question of the retention of the Philippines
and Porto Rico, will devote* their energies
to retaining, in its integrity, the protective
policy of the United states.
We rejoice in the acquisition of Hawaii
and Porto Rico, and favor the retention by
our country of every foot of soil that has
been conquered by the victorious hosts of
our great republic.
We condemn the action of the Democratic
Senator of this State and the present Demo
cratic nominee for Governor, then in Con
gress, Cor opposing the annexation of Ha
waii and wholly falling to represent the In
terests or wishes of the people of this State
in that regard. '
We approve of the conduct of the Repub
lican Senator, George |C. Perkins/ and . our
Representatives in Congress from California,
J. A. Barham, E. F. Loud and S. G. Hil
born. They have ever - labored for the ad
vantage of our State and have secured wise
legislation for Its Interest.
The necessities of war and the demands of
peace Ike call upon the American people
to unite the Atlantic to the Pacific by the
construction of a canal across the Isthmus
Of Nicaragua. It should be immediately
commenced and vigorously prosecuted, so
that in the near future the commerce of the
world may seek the Pacific Slope and the
Atlantic coast through a canal constructed
and maintained by the United States, with
the American flag, spreading its protecting
folds over Its entire length; we pledge our
every exertion to secure this result and hope
the Pacific Coast built warship, the Ore
gon, that made so gallant a sail around
Cape Horn, may .be the first to bring the
good news through this great artery of
trade.
The last Congress having unanimously
rissed a law providing for the collection of
the indebtedness due from the Central and
Western Pacific Railroads to the Govern
ment, the Republican party favors the en
forcement thereof and unless such law and
all the provisions thereof be promptly ac
cepted and compiled with, by such speci
fied, railroad companies, that the law be
strictly enforced and the Hen on said roads
and properties be foreclosed and said roads
and mortgaged property be sold according
to law, and that all funds that now or
hereafter are realized from either or both
Of the said Pacific Railroads or from the
collection of their debt to the Government,
whether voluntarily or by foreclosure, be
applied to the construction of the Nicaragua
canal.
We pledge our candidates for Railroad
Commissioners to reduce wherever practi
cable and needed the rates of freights and
fares now charged by the transportation
companies of the StatÂ». having, in bo doing,
a just regard for the wasres of their em
ployes and . the rights of the people.
The Republican party commends the ap
propriation for and congratulates the peo
ple on thÂ» proj^cfd improvement of San
Pedro harbor. It commends its Represen
tatives, who have aided In accomplishing
the work already done and pledges them
to the fullest, support of all measures de
signed to Improve our rivers and harbors.
NOW, as ever, the Republican pnrtv Is the
champion of the wnere earner of the nation:

tion, furnished him remunerative employ
ment, and by its homestead laws given him
frt-e DOOMS. It now declares that the man
must be protectedÂ«as well as the product of
his labors.
Wherefore, we demand that the immigra
tion laws be amended so as to absolutely
prohibit the filling of the marts oi labor in
America with laborers from foreign kinds.
We demand the enactment of such legis
lation regarding Hawaii/ Porto Rico and
such other territory as may be acnulred by
the United States as will protect American
workmen against contract Chinese, Japan
ese or other contract labor found therein
and will prevent any further influx or ex
tension thereof
We also demand that Congress pass an
exclusion act prohibiting further Japan
ese and coolie Immigration, and that such
exclusion act shall prohibit both the Japan
ese and Chinese now located In the_ Ha
waiian Islands from entering the I nited
States.
Economy in the expenditures of t! -ev
enues of the individual or t-e State is ab
solutely necessary to the happiness of the
man and the security of the community.
The Republican party now, as ever, be
lieves In a rigid economy In all depart
ments of the government, city, county and
State. We pledge all our candidates to an
economical administration of public affairs,
to the end that taxation may be reduced
to the smallest rate commensurate with
the needs of the public welfare.
We oppose the doctrine of the ' 'single
tax." of which the Democratic nomine- for
Governor lf> the apostle, as being socialis
tic and anarchistic, and the practical work
ings of which will be to release fctocks,
bonds, corporations and usurers from tax
ation and place all Its burdens on the
farmers and owners of homesteads.
We approve of the war revenue recently
PÂ«Â«Â«>-d by Congress as being In line with
the above sentiments, as It compels the
luxuries and the corporations and aggre-
S.-it?Tl wealth of the nation to pay a greater
yet not Improper share of the taxation made
necessary by the war than any revenue
measure heretofore adopted. Its provis
ions for the issuance of bonds wisely ex
tended the payment of the expenses of
the war to include the generation who will
receive greater benefit from Its results
than the present, while it enables the peo
ple of America to show their patriotic
faith in the country by purchasing the
amount of the bonds" required, a striking
contrast In financial and uttitesrranllke
policy to the selling of bonds to a greedy
syndicate by the last Democratic national
administration.
This is a law-abiding country and we are
n law-abiding people. Under our system
of government there Is no '.anger of any
one of its departments assuming power to

ALAMEDA
WAVERED
It Weakened Pardee's
Fight by Not Stand
ing Fin.
A Reckoning Awaited in Sev
eral Camps Before Har
mony Is Restored.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, OAK
LAND, Aug. 24.â Resolved. That
George C. Pardee be constituted a
committee of one to trade the
68 votes of the Alameda County
Convention as he sees fit, provid
ing that he does not infringe on
any special privileges granted the
delegates from Alameda City.
The foregoing resolution, passed at the
caucus held In Sacramento Monday
night by the Alameda delegation, Is said
to need some explanation, and there is j
no doubt that It will be demanded before
the county convention which meets Sep
tember 19.
Some of the returning delegates declare
that Alameda County was disparaged in
the eyes of the rest of the delegates by
the claim that her own delegation was
not unanimous, and that Lou Brown
could count on nearly a dozen votes from
this county. . The report sent out to all
the newspapers of the State that the nine
delegates from the city of Alameda were
not for Pardee and did not wear his
badges is calculated to have done as
much harm to the Alameda man's cause
as though they had bolted the Alameda
delegation in the convention. To this
alleged position of Alameda City's deleÂ«
gates is largely attributed the defeat of
l>r. Pardee.
Ten days ago a letter was received
in this city by a politician from Lou
Brown. Mr. Brown referred to his
chances of winning the nomination and
informed his correspondent that any
ticket on which tile name of J. B. Lank
tree appeared or in which Lanktree
was especially interested might be sup
ported by his (Brown's) friends with con
fidence. This letter was shown to many
responsible people and created mucti
comment. bince the manner in which
the Alameda City delegation, of which Joe
Lanktree Is a member, acted at Sacra
mento has become known, the subject
has been revived with considerable in
terest, and when Joe comes back he will
no doubt tell all he knows about it.
There was some suspicion that the letter
was a forgery, but it has been vouched
mr to-day as being genuine.
Dr. Pardee's stanchcst friends declare
that it was thoroughly understood before
the primaries that the "unpledged" ticket
In Alameda City was solid tor him, and on
that acount. anil relying upon that assur
ance, his regular ticket was withdrawn.
It appears that there was some misunder
standing, for which also an explanation
will no doubt be demanded.
All sorts of stories have been circulated i
in Oakland during the past twenty-four I
hours regarding the purposes and plans â¢
of the Alameda City delegation. It is
more than probable that many of them â 
were started by Oakland candidates for
county otTiees who a.re interested in in
juring the chances of Alameda's two an
nounced candidatesâ Jim Barber for Tax
Collector and Oscar Kogers for Sheriff.
However this may be, there will have to
be a reckoning between certain camps if
harmony is to prevail. There are many
ready to defend Joe_ Lanktree and E. K.
! Taylor, who were supposed to have led j
their delegation, and the point is made
that Taylor, who is a candidate for State
Senator, would hardly be likely to take :
a stand opposed to the unanimous wish ;
of Alameda County, which if taken must \
have jeopardized his political future. I
These are some of the matters that will
be threshed out before the end of the
: week.
Some of Lanktree's friends declare that
: the Alameda City delegation was a unit
I with the county all the time and i
! that the stories of in>armony were
circulated by interested parties, who |
thought that in the Alameda in
cident they BftW a straw to grasp at
which might be used to injure the entire
county. This element of speculation will
also enter into the general reckoning.
IRISH PAIR EVENTS.
Firemen Will Have the Right of
Way To-Night.
One of the new features at the Irish
Fair last evening was a voting: contest
| on the map of Ireland, in charge of Miss
i Nellie Sullivan ;uul Miss Josie Malloy, for
| the most popular county in the Emerald
| Isle. The sod of the county receiving the
! most votes will be placed in a stone re
ceptacle in Golden Gate Park, in a con
spicuous location, and planted with
shamrocks.
Another attraction is the voting on the
candidates for Governor. The Young
Men's Republican Club will soon attend
li a body and swell the vote for their can
didate. At the pretty booth presided over
by Mrs. Ellen Frost packages of genuine
Irish dillisk from Oalway Hay are having
I a big sale. In the Irish restaurant, in
I charge of Mrs. Tuitt. old-fashioned Dub
lin stows are served in true Irish style.
In the theater, under the direction of
Mrs. Melville Snyder. the bill last evening
consisted of scenes from "The Honey
moon" and "The Merchant of Venice,"
with several recitations and the "Legend
ol the Blarney Stone." arranged by J. A.
Haran, who played the chief. Miss Lil
i Uan Forsythe. with the dance of the Irish
| fairies, in charge of Mrs. Dreyfus, met
with hearty applause.
The art collection in the theater in
cludes many pictures by celebrated art
ists. These paintings have been loaned,
and came from some of the most refined
and wealthy people in this city. Last
evening the famous painting of "The Mur
i phy Party at Dormer Lake," by Andrew
I P Hill, was added to the collection, and
attracted a great deal of attention.
This evening the firemen will be present
in force. It is "Firemen's night," and is
I the first special attraction of the fair.

CONVENTION DELLGATES
AT THEIR CAUCUS
Continued from Fifth Page.
pecially to a man who has taken so lit
tie part In State politics as I have, here
beneath the dome that closes above us. ,
with the spotless white, the fervent red
and the blue of our flag, the stars and the i
eagles looking down upon us, to ask for ,
a place upon the State ticket. The eyes i
of the nation and the world are at this
moment upon us. We have just drawn
With the clasped hand of the North and
the South from the sword hilt, that sword
which was sheathed when the civil war I
came to a triumphal close. i
We have drawn that sword on behalf or
an-, oppressed race, and now it has been
returned to its scabbard. In that war we !
planted our eagles upon the heights of ;
. Santiago and unfurled our flag over the |
waters of Manila Bay. Our influence and
jurisdiction followed the sun in its west- j
â ward course till it stopped on the western
shores of the Philippines.
Out of that war have come issues vast '
and momei.tous, not only to this State
and our nation, but to universal man. I
But these issues depend to a great ex- |
tent as to their decision upon the action i
of California to-day, and the election :
which is to follow. That great states- ]
tnan whom General Barnes placed side
by side with Lincoln and Grant in the i
Pantheon of our national heroes, has left I
it to the enlightened public opinion of !
to ..decide what course shall be i
taken and how those issues shall be de- [
Cided. We must elect our ticket in this
campaign in order to have an influence j
in directing that national p^lcy and de- ;
elding the course which shall be pur- |
sued, and in taking the place which I
California may make in directing the j
public -opinion of America and the world. I
Along the western shore of the Pacific,
with her thousand miles of seacoast,
washed by those emerald waters, and
s<>as with commerce stretching from Ha- â¢
waii, the Ladrones and Philippines to the ;
Orient, a mighty conflict for the trade
and commerce of the world is to take
place in the coming century. The great j
struggle which is to be upon the Pacific j
will either give us a place as one |
of the worlds powers, or will rel
egate *is -to third place. With those
issues presented we must place before ]
the people of California a ticket that
can be elected, and one of the things nee- i
essary for us to do is to recognize every .
portion of this State. I am here from j
a county situated 500 miles north of your
county, which has given to this State
the standard bearer under whose leader
ship victory will be assured, and from
that county that gave McKinley 700 ma- i
jority in 1896.
' I come before you to ask for the sec- ;
ond place upon the ticket. I believe we j
have the man for the place and for the |
hour. If you will give us a place upon |
the ticket we will have a personal Inter- '
est in its success. Of course, we have |
that anyhow, and no matter what the ;
result may be, you will find us with
coats off, sleeves rolled up. doing our best
for the success of the whole ticket. The
man whom I would nominate, like Lin
coln and Garfleld and Grant, sprang from
the humblest ranks of life. By his own
efforts he has gained a place â a warm
place â in the regard ami affections of
those who know him best. An able ora
tor, an able lawyer, a man of great en- 'â 
ergy, a man who will strongly appeal to j
the" young men of this State, I believe
that "he is the man that you should pre- '
t^ent as the running mate of Henry T. i
Gage of Los Angeles. Gentlemen of the
convention. I appeal to our justice, I ap
peal to your patriotism. 1 appeal to your
nope and desire for success in the great
battle which now awaits us, and I ap
ical In the name of that duty which we
owe as Californians, and the Republican |
party of California, a part of the great
Republican party of the nation, to show !
the whole people that California is capa- ,
â¢ble of rising to the grand opportunity ;
that awaits her. Give us our delegate
and California will nobly respond. I ask
you to nominate Thomas H. Selvage far
the second place on your ticket. (Ap
plause and cheers.)
R. H. Lloydâ Mr. Chairman and gentle- j
men of the convention: I have heard the j
praises sung of Native Sons placed in |
nomination; I have heard the praises i
sung of candidates from different locali- ]
ties In this State. I have no NÂ«ative Son
to put in nomination here, but I have ]
a gentleman who was here before any
Native Suns arrived (laughter), or before !
any of them were expected (laughter), j
I have a gentleman whose name is hon- '
ored by every true American Native Son j
in California." 1 will not sing his praises, j
it i? not necessary. His fame and his
reputation belong to the State. If you
want his biography, read the history of
your State. If you want a man against
whom not one thing can be said, a man ;
who loved his fellow men. a man who j
would sooner do right than anything on :
earth, who respects the rights of every- !
Imdy. who is able, intelligent and has the j
ability and honesty to perform every duty j
which will fall upon him in this position,
I give you the name of a man who be- i
longfl to no part of this State, but who '
belongs to the entire Stateâ Jacob Hart
Neff. (Applause).
Mr. George A. Knight â Gentle
men of the Convention, I owe to you
as a Republican sitting in this con
vention to at least tell you the truth.
(Laughter.) I was never in a Repub
lican convention in my life that I
did not tell the truth â when I can
not tell the truth I will keep still. ;
(Voices â Good boy, George.)
We have nominated Henry T. Gage
for Governor of this State, a clean
cut lawyer; a man who can make
a campaign of this State with
honor to himself and honor to the
party; a man that we need not be
f.3hamed of; a man who is able to ,
take care of himself, and he does not
need any assistance. Now, as far as
!L-enry T. Gage is concerned, that is
enough. We want a Lieutenant Gov- !
ernor to preside over the delibera
tions of the Senate; a man who is up
in parliamentary rule 3, who is clean- ;
cut and quick in his decisions; a man ;
who is next to the Governor of this
State; a man of whom also we ought
not be ashamea and that is the kind
of a man I am going to give you,
and it is Frank McGowan. (Voices â
Good, good.)
Nnw I want to talk right down the row
of the San Francisco delegation some
good common sense. I know how you
â¢feel. lam one of you, and when I can
not talk, I do not say anything. I want
you to vote right. No harm is going to
oome of thisâ and, gentlemen, I am go
ing to talk right from the shoulder, too.
The gentleman who has just been put in
nomination, Hon. Jacob Neff, has been
crowned with all the glories that man
needs in this world; a man who sits now
in the eventide of his life, witb more
honor than any Republican that I know
of in this State. There is not a man
that dare question the integrity of Jacob
Neff, or his life long work, in the inter
f-MH of the Republican party. And this
convention, as men, should do him the
honor and say to him, "Rest from your
labors, well done, good and faithful ser
vant." (Applause.) You cannot heap
honor upon Jacob Neff by giving him
the onerous dunes that are involved upon
the presiding officer of the State Senate.
Let me tell you fellow Republicans and
members of this convention, that the
time has come now; this us the time
when you ought to pick up the papers
that were printed this morning and read
the names of those who are to be on
your State ticket. A voice, "Good boy."
I am a programmer. There never was
a straighter programmer than I am, but
when I tell you I cannot do that thing, I
tell you I won't, and my forefoot Is stuck
in the mud and you cannot budge me
on the proposition.
Vote for Frank McGowan and when
you go to your homes you will not have
made any mistake. Four years ago I
stood in this convention and told you
that Judge de Haven would bring votes
to your ticket and down the line, the
center line of the San Francisco delega
tion, In their hearts, knew he was a
tower of strength. But they did not
have the gray matter at the roots of
their hair, or something that grows up
the backbone to air their judgment.
Now get right in on this. This man is
a good presiding officer. He has been in
the State Senate; he can make a campaign
equally as good as Henry T. Gage, and he
will be by his side. He is one of the best
orators in this State. His superior is not
in the State to-day, and it will help the
ticket. With all the honor and the glory
for ever and ever to my friend Mr. Neff,
I do this in kindness to relieve him of the
arduous duties of an office and confer a
favor upon the Republican party of this
Siate by putting in nomination a young i
man, full of energy and full of experience, i
who is looking to the rising sun of a better
! age in political life. He will do the party
I more good than any man that has been
I bominated for the position, in my opinion,
I to-day. Vote for Frank McGowan, and
you won't make a mistake. (Voices: j
"McGowan! McGowan!") â j
Mr. McGowan of San Franciscoâ Mr.
Chairman and fellow-Republicans of this
! State Convention, this is an auspicious
year for Republicanism. We are blessed
: at this time with the grandest President
! since the days of Lincoln. Our army and
navy have won and excited the admira
tion of the world, which we are about to
face as a new nation. We are making
i rapid strides in material, moral and po
1 litical progress, and these conditions are
I the result of the sterling Republicanism
of the age in which we live. The great
thoughts that are moving to action the
men of this nation of ours are the senti
j ment and thoughts of the Republican
! party. It is eminently fit and proper that
i California, the land of peace and plenty;
California, abounding in the blessings ot
freedom; California, whose loyal sons are
now consecrating an imperishable Ameri
canism on the soil of the Philippines,
should be in the vanguard of this great
Republican march of great patriotic
ideas.
I promise you, my fellow-Republicans,
if you honor me with this nomination
that I will carry the banner of the He-
Ilican party from one end of this State
he other. If elected. I will endeavor
lischarge the duties of that office to
best of my ability. I assure you if I
Honored as a Republican in the full j
iciousness that I will see the light as
gives me the right to see it. that
harging the duties of that office I
do it according to the law, and will
not bend my knee to corporate influences,
nor I will be tne jumping-jack of any
devil-inspired political boss in the State
of California. (Applause.)
Colonel Eddyâ Mr. Chairman and gen
tlemen of the convention: I desire to say
to you that under no other cir
cumstances than those that have
happened here within me last
five minutes would I evtr as
sume to come before you to speak in be
half of any candidate for this office. I
wish you to distinctly understand that it
was riot intended that I should say one
word in behalf of any gentleman for this
high office, but I wish to say that under !
no circumstances will I sit as a delegate !
in the body of this convention and allow
any manâ whether he be George A. j
Knight or anybody elseâ to hurl insinua- ;
tions at me, simply because I happen to i
be a delegate from San Francisco, that
I had subscribed to any programme in the
world. (Applause.)
I wish to say that the insinuation is ab
solutely false and baseless, so far as I !
am concerned, and I believe this moment
that there is not a gentleman who is as
sociated with me who has been pro- j
grammed upon this question of the can
dlflacy for Lieutenant Governor or any
other' office. (Voices, "Sit down, sit
down.") Just one word: I am not here
to speak disparagingly of any candidate; :
far be it from me to do so. I expect to ;
work for any man who Is nominated
upon this ticket, whether it be the Hon.
Mr. McGowan or any other man. I am
not here for that purpose. I am here to ;
say that I will do whatever I can for any
man who is nominated, but I do say, and
I say now, that I believe that since these
words have been spoken the strong
est mao we can nominate is the Hon.
Jacob Neff.
Mr. Preston of San Mateo â Mr.
Chairman and Gentlemen ol the Con
vention: I do not propose to take up .
your time with a lengthy speech, but
in the interest of the Republican
party, in the interest of the success
of the ticket composed of men who do
not tear down, but men who are
builders in the land, men whose in
tentions are yours, men who are iden
tified with you, men who believe in
the welfare and glory of California,
I bow in humble reverence to the
Hon. Jacob Neff in the interest of
California and in the interests of the
Republican party.
The secretary proceeded to call the roll, ;
and before the roll call was completed,
on motion of Mr. Knight, the nomination
of Jacob Neff for Lieutenant Governor
was made unanimous.
Chairâ Gentlemen of the convention, I
introduce to you Hon. Jacob Neff.
Mr. Neff â Gentlemen of the Con
vention: It is hardly to be expected
that at this time, after crying my
self hoarse to make myself heard ,
over this vast body, I should make
an address. Gentlemen, in the few
words that I have to say, I hope
that you will bear with me. In the
first instance, I wish to say that this
honor has come to me without being
sought. I did not seek this hojaor,
but through the partiality of my
friends I was brought into this con
test, and I have been successful. I
do not desire to have it understood
that I have the least feeling of re- ;
sentment toward any delegate that
thought Senator McGowan was a bet
ter man for the place. I want to say
that I indorse your platfcnn â every
word and every syllable of it. It
breathes the true spirit of Republi
canism, of which I am a believer. If
I should be successful in the ensuing
campaign and be elected 1 can only
pledge you that so far as my abili
ties go, the duties of president of the
Senate shall be discharged in a sat
isfactory manner. I shall know no
Democrat, no Republican, no Popu
list when it comes to a discharge of
duty. I believe in fairness in poli- '
tics, fairness in business and fair
ness in the every-day affairs of life.
I have been honored, gentlemen, !
and I thank you. With this I retire.
(Applause.)
Ifter several announcements by the
retary the convention adjourned until
'clock.
Evening Session,
he chairman called the convention to
er at 8:20 o'clock. .
The Chairmanâ The convention will be
in order. Take your seats.
A motion was made and carried that
henceforth nominating speeches be limited
to five minutes.
Mr. Meserve â Mr. Chairman and gentle
men of this Republican convention: It is
my privilege for the first time in the his- |
tory of this convention or of any other
State convention to appear upon the plat
form and place before it the name of a
man whom we want to receive your suf
frages. Los Angeles came here, and came
here for a purpose. Part of that purpose
has been realized in the placing at the
head of your ticket the incomparable j
Henry T. Gage. Now, gentlemen, long be
fore it was thought of placing the name
of Henry T. Gage before you, young men
had thought for years of elevating to the
Supreme bench a man who. though a
young man, has been elevated and hon
ored, and it Is as a young man and a
young member of the bar of that county
that I appear before you in the short
space allowed to tell you something of
that young, able and grea.t Jurist. 1 say
that the young men of to-day have a
right to be proud. The young men of to
day have a right to say something and
ask something at your hands.
General Barnes, my friend General
Barnes, whom I personally love, has told
you in words which none of us could hope
to imitate, the story of the great war
Just closed. He has not told you ail that
appeals to us young men and of that
which he, at" an old man, has not thought.
He and you went through the troubled
times of 1861 to 1865. You have learned
lessons of patriotism in those hell fires.
We have learned them Pimply as tradi
tions at your knees, but to-day the young
men of this nation, Inspired by the
thought that their lives are of value in
its support, a lesson learned in this war,
come here to-day believing that they are
of the same value. It is not the life of
the man whose days were nearly run,
and who simply crowned the efforts that
appeals to you. It is the life of the
young men we bring before you. It is the
death of a Bagley, it is the death of a
young man. It is the life of a Hobson,
of a Flnley that says to the young men
of to-day, you have something in this
You axe the young men who pick up
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1898.
THE CALL'S SPECIAL CONVENTION SERVICE.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 24.â The arrival of The Call special train each morning is one of the
events of the day to the delegates and to persons interested in the Republican convention. Never in
the history of political gatherings in California has such service been accorded to the people as that
rendered by The Call during the past two weeks.
The news has been given in its entirety by men versed in the arts of politicians. Not only has it
been ably gathered and written, but it has had the added quality of being presented to The Call's
readers in pleasing form. The importance of the forthcoming struggle has warranted all this effort, of
which the flying special train has been the outward and visible sign, on the part of the paper.
The delegates to the convention, the residents of the Capitd City and the other strangers within
its gates are not the only persons who profit by the enterprise of The Call. In the gray of these sum
mer mornings, as the special thunders over the rails at the rate of sixty miles an hour, bundles of
papers are dropped at the various towns along the line, the residents thus learning of the doings of
the outside world as soon as the people of the metropolitan district.
The forecast of the work of the convention has been so accurate and so just as to excite the ad
miration of the men interested in it. They take it as an indication jf the confidence placed in The
Call staff as well as of the clever manner in which they have anticipated the moves upon the political
chessboard. The Call will continue to serve the people in the future as it has in the past, both in the
quality of its news and in the delivery of the completed paper to its readers.
the thread and carry it forward to make
a. success of that which has been laid
before you Gentlemen of this conven
tion the man whom I am going to pre
sent to you to be nominated Is W. H.
CTirk known by the members of the bar
as' "Ally" Clark. His life is a peculiar
one In ISSS he was nominated for bu
perior Judge and he ran ahead of his
ticket. In IS9O he was nominated again,
received the highest vote of the conven
tion and ran ahead of his ticket. In 189b
he was again nominated, receiving the
highest vote in the convention, leading
the Republican ticket in that county by
over 1000 votes, getting the largest vote
ever received by any man in any election
in that county. Gentlemen, on behalf or
the Los Angeles delegation, I present to
you the name of W. H. Clark.
Delegate from Orangeâ Mr. Chairman,
on behalf of the county of Orange, whlcfc
is contiguous, and for many yea* 3 was
the largest part of the county of Los
Angeles, 1 second the nomination of
Judge Clark. -
Mr. Hutchinson of Napaâ Gentlemen of
the Convention: Sometimes in the ex
tnent of the moment in the rivalry
attendant upon a Republican convention,
we delegates do not give that careful
consideration to qualifications and ele
ments of strength of the various candi
dates that may appear before us, and
that applies to every office, and it ap
plies with great force to the gentlemen
who are asking for the nomination for
Associate Justice of the Supreme bench
at your hands.
It behooves us to note that the gentle
men who are placed as candidates upon
this ticket for that high and honorable
office that they shall have not only the
qualification for that high office, but that
they should also bring elements of
strength to the ticket upon whlcn they
may be placed. I have the honor to
place before this convention a gentleman
who has education, who has natural abil
ity, who has experience upon the Supe
rior bench of this State, whose record
as a citizen and a soldier make him emi
nently fit to grace the Supreme bench
of this State, and whose name will bring
thousands of votes to the Republican
party, it' placed upon it. That man is
the Hon. A. J. Buckles of Solano County.
(.Applause.)
We, the young men of this convention,
have within the last year heard the sound
of the bugle and the beating ofc the drum
that have summoned the army and navy
of this country to a great conflict, and
within a few months we have seen the
Atlantic squadron, with her Brooklyn and
her Oregon, come back in safety. With
a loss of less than a thousand men in
battle we have seen the leaders of our
forces humble Spain and set the people of
* country to studying the geography
c nation to tell where the state ends
>egins. But the time was, gentlemen
le convention, and, many of you on
this floor will remember those brave men
who laid down their lives to battle and
â r to honor that old flag, for when the
was fired at Fort Sumter it black
thirteen of the stars on that flag of
and it opened a chasm in this coun
try out of which was pouring the lives of
thousands of brave men.
When that time came in history Judge
Buckles, then a lad of 15 years of age, In
the State of Indiana, heard the first call
for volunteers, and he with others
marched up to Washington under that
first call. As they marched they kept
step to the chorus, "A\ c are coming*
Father Abraham, three hundred thousand
strong." (Applause.)
In the battle of Bull Run he was in the
Nineteenth Regiment and in that battle
he was wounded. He was taken to the
hospital and after some time recovered.
Then at the battle of Gettysburg, the
Nineteenth Indiana at that time consti
tuted one of the regiments which formed
the band of noble men in the army of
the Potomac, known as the "Iron Bri
gade." At the battle forces were pouring
through the Union line, the colors of the
Nineteenth Indiana were taken from the
regiment and Buckles saw them and, fac
ing the storming shot and shell, rescued
them and brought them back to the Union
line. When he came back, he had a bul
let through his shoulder. xFor that act
upon the battlefield, he was made the
standard bearer of his regiment, and
when he was carrying the same flag in
the battle of the Wilderness, he was again
wounded on the field of action. In 1865,
when commanding a skirmish regiment,
he was again wounded, this time resulting
in the loss of his leg. That is the record
of the soldier. (Cries of "Time.") I beg
your indulgences for one moment. He
then came to this country. After having
been admitted to the bar, he was elected
district attorney of Solano County twice.
He was then elected Superior Judge of
that county and the second time he came
up fur re-election, the Democrats indorsed
him to a man. They did not have a man
whom they said would be nominated
against him. That is a part of his record
as a judge of that county: for eighteen
years he has sat upon the Superior Bench
â Jolano County and out of forty appeals
en but six have been reversed. That
ils record as a judge. (Applause.)
entlemen of the convention: Sixteen
thousand old soldiers are valtlng to see
what recognition we will give them upon
this State ticket. I venture to say that
there is not one man within the con
fines of this State who can be named that
will aid tne strength and power of this
Siato ticket more than the name of A.
J. Buckles of Solano. Recognize this old
soldier and put him on the ticket.
General Sullivanâ Mr. Chairman and
gentlemen of the convention: Fortu
nately, it is not necessary-, after the elo
quent remarks of the speaker who has
Just preceded me, to say much. But since
I have had the. honor to fight side by
side with Judge Buckles on the battle
field of Gettysburg, I cannot remain in
my sent and let his name go before this
convention without indorsing It. and add
a few words to those so eloquently ut
tered by the gentleman who spoke before
me. The 20.000 old soldiers of the war of
the Union ask you to place upon this
ticket the name of A. J. Buckles. (Ap
' They are the principles of a great or
ganization which is not a political one. I
said on a former occasion, and I repeat It
â¢it this time, that that organization is
composed of old soldiers and is one in
which we have no politics and no Dem
ocrats (laughter), therefore they are en
! titled to your consideration. We hope

Mr Webbâ Mr. Chairman and pentle
â¢ men" of the convention: I apprehend
' that the people of the northern part of
; this State will not be lamented because
! of the rreat number of its citizens whose
names they will find upon the ticket
here being nominated. (Laughter.) Com
intr fn>m the northern portion of the
State representing the county of Plumas,
I I desire to place before you the name o*
a gentleman for the office of Justice of
the Supreme Court of this State. His
name is Stanley A. Smith of Sierra
County. He has an experience of many
rears upon the Superior bench of the
county He served his time as District
Attorney. He is a lawyer and a Judge
of mature years, and a man of strict in
tegrity and a man of -undoubted capae
itv His ear can no n^nre catch the con
fident demands of tho imperialist wealth
than it can the meekly whispered prayer
of ruined poverty. Gentlemen, it is time
that we should "remember loyalty north
of Sacramento, I call your attention to
the fact that unless a candidate for the
Supreme Court be drawn from the north
thÂ«-re will be none representing the north
ern end of the State upon the ticket. We
bespeak at your hands a fair considera
tion of the claims of the north. We sug
gest to you. gentlemen of the south, and
to you. gentlemen of the interior. In the
flush of victories here achieved and con
fident in the victories yet to fall in your
behalf, that you can do well to consider
the northern part of the State, to whom
you will look in November for your ma-
Gentlemen, again, representing the
northern part of the State, speaking for
the mining section, I ask you to consider
the name of the Hon. Stanley A. Smith
uf Sierra County.
Judge Seward of Sierraâ ln behalf of
Sierra County and the mining interests, i
take pleasure In seconding the nomina
tion of Hon. Stanley A. Smitii for As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court. I
heartily indorse what has been said in
his behalf, and we as miners btlieve that
a mining man ought to have a place on
the Supreme bench of the State of Cali
fornia.
C. T. Jones of Sacramentoâ Mr. Chair
man and gentlemen of the convention:
An able, upright and conscientious judi
ciary la the safeguard of the Republican
party in the State. What more exalted
position, what is more important in the
gift of the people of this btate than As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court?
They have in their keeping the life, lib
erty, pursuit of happiness, of the un
alienable right of the citizen, the execu
tive and legislative branches of the gov
ernment may become incompetent, may
become corrupt and venal, but if you
have the proper kind of judiciary, and if
we have men of ability there, if you have
men of standing and of purity, the rights
of the people are preserved. In
ing a candidate for Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court, it seems to me that
personal friendship even should be cast
aside. Liocality should not be thought of;
delegates who look for character in a
nominee should look for purity of char
acter and look for legal learning and
should look for peerlessness. In looking
over these characteristics for a nominee
I take pleasure and pride in naming, in
behalf of Sacramento Countyâ aye of the
people of the Stateâ Judge T. B. McFar
land of the present Supreme Court. (Ap
plause and cheers).
Judge McFarland needs no eulogy at my
hands. His life is as an open book. His
record as a Supreme Court Justice is be
fore you. All of you that know him as
a man know that his character is pure,
know that his very name is honesty it
self and know of his ability as a Justice in
the court. As a Republican, my fellow
citizens, no man within the confines of
my voice can say that any man is more
deserving- at the hands of his party.
I call your attention to the tact that
twelve years ago yoii placed him upon
your ticket as a Justice for the office to
which he now aspires at the Los Angeles
convention. At the ensuing election the
head of your ticket was beaten, many of
the candidates were beaten, but Judge
McFarland led your ticket to victory.
(Applause.)
I ask you to place him upon the ticket.
He is deserving of that nomination, and
if nominated he will be elected, and if
elected he will serve you faithfully. I
thank you for your attention.
Judge Van R. Patersonâ Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the convention: You
are now about to proceed to pronounce
your verdict upon the most Important
duties that you have ben called upon to
perform here â the selection of a Justice
of the Supreme Court of the State of
California. San Francisco has no aspi
rant for that position, but I am proud of
the honor which I have here to-night of
seconding the nomination of that tried,
unimpeachable, true jurist, that honest,
rugged, honorable man, the Hon. Thomas
B. McFarland. (Applauae.) There is no
place in the world when men come to
learn another so quickly nor so well as
in the consultation room of the Supreme
Court. Month after month, year after
year, in the interchange of views in the
search of those principles which are ne
cessary to the proper determination of
those great questions of life, liberty and
propetry which reach multitudinous
forms, every question of mental and
moral strength and weakness of every
member of the court, is necessarily a
question for every other member of the
court. Gentlemen of the convention, it is
from this standpoint, it is from such as
sociation and from such observation that
I have learned to know, and knowing
have come to learn to love, respect and
aumire Judge McFarland. (. -clause.)
He is absolutely true, conscientious â
thoroughly so â magnificently equipped by
nature as well as by training. He is in
the vigor of manhood, mentally and phys
ically, and as true to the Constitution and
the Impartial decision of discretion as a
Judge as the pole to the polar star.
Now, gentlemen of the convention, I
want to say this to you â that when the
founders of this Government divided it
into three departments they plact-d the
judiciary above all the others, with dis
cretionary and supervisorial control over
them, and with this ideaâ that if there
arose any question of policy, any question
of law, the Judges should be put there
with no pledge save their honor and no
bond save their own integrity; and when
they did that they impliedly said to the
people of this Government, "When you
put a man in that oosition you put him
there for life and far good behavior."
Now, gentlemen, if you want to get good
Judges you must say to them that if
in your judicial career you perform your
functions as judicial officers fairly and
well you will be preferred, and It Is only
upon that theory, gentlemen of this con
vention, that you can get Judges who will
aspire to those positions. Judge McFar
land Is invincible. He is -absolutely fear
leflS. There is no political tempest, there
is no storm of passion that can shake
him. You owe It to yourself, you owe it
to the party, you owe it to the people to
nominate this man who has been so loyal
to the Republican party, who has been
so firm in his convictions and in his de
cisions. Nobody can force him by fear
or by flattery or by cajoling or by whee
dling from the path which his conviction
has blazed out for him. His life is an
open book. All through his life he has fol
lowed this motto, "Round to swear to tho
Ipse dixit of no master. Whither mv con
victions carry me. thither am I borne, and
a willing and welcome guest."
General A. L. Hartâ l desire on behalf
of the Thirty-ninth District of the city
and county of San Francisco to second
the nomination of Judge McFarland for
Supreme Judge. (Applause.)
George A. Knightâ Mn. Chairman and
gentlemen of the convention: I rise at
this time with not so much enthusiasm
of speech as I had, but with the fervor
that this occasion should inspire. I arise
to ask this convention to nominate Judge
Van Fleet Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court. (Applause and cheers.) I
will tell you why I do so, gentlemen.
Judge Pateraon has just said there has
been a well denned tacit understanding
that all decent, llberty-lovlng American
fitlsens entertain the idea that when you
find a Judge that Is pure; when you have
found that a Judge is able, when you
have found a man that is fearless, that
exercises judicial function without fear
or favor that man should be retained for
the benefit of the people and not for the
benefit of himself.
Our United States District Judges, our
United States Circuit Judges and our
United States Supreme Judges are ap
pointed upon that theory and for that
reason. Now, gentlemen, Judge Van
Fleet Is no stranger to the people of this
State. It Is not my purpose to eulogize,
It is not my purpose to take up the atten
tion of this convention longer than to state
a few facts which I know to be true anp
which you can verify if you wait for fu
ture developments and the action of this
convention, and the election of Judge Van
Fleet at the polls. He is a good lawyer,
he Is a fearless man. He came to Sacra
mento and engaged in the practice of law
with success, was elevated to the Superior
Bench in this city and county and no
Democrat was found to run against him.
He also received tho nomination of both
parties and was overwhelmingly elected,
no one running against him. Tiring of
the irksome duties of the office of Superior
Judge of Sacramento County, he connect
ed himself with one of the best law firms
in San Franciscoâ Mastick, Belcher &
Mastiokâ and there he won distinction at
the San Francisco bar. Judge Paterson,
trrlng of the duties of the offloe of Su
preme Judge, resigned, Judge Van Fleet
was appointed to fill that vacancy. He
then went before the people and was
elected and he is now serving that term.
He comes to you to-night asking for
your support. He comes to you not
<1
craving; he comes to you with no prom
ises. He comes to you as pure as God's
sunlight, clean as a pebble, and as brave
v man as ever sat upon any bench in
the land. (Applause and cheers.) Gen
tlemen, he deals out the law to the pau
per and the King as he finds it. He gives
them a law as it is upon the statute
books, and there has never been any one
to question his integrity. His surround
ings as a man, his aoility as a Judge, and
his footsteps are as a good citizen. 1
ask you to renominate Judge Van Fleet,
and he will do honor to the Republican
party as a Republican, and he will do
honor to the bench in the equal dispen
sation of justice to all classes, religious,
political, and whatever kind. In him
you have a strong friend, a good man
and good Judge, irrespective of party,
an honor to the State and the pride of
the Iriends who know him. I ask you
to nominate him at this time. I thank
you for your attention. (Applause.)
Judge E. C. Hart of Sacramento â Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen of the conven
tion: The representatives in this conven
tion from Sacramento County with whose
judicial history he was for a number of
years identified in a career distinguished
by consummate ability, could well be ac
cused of unpardonable dereliction of duty
if they did not at this time indorse the
candidacy of the Hon. W. C. Van Fleet
for Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. (Applause.) Called to the nisi
prius bencn when a young man in this
county It was but a short time when he
was recognized by bench and bar as a
man singularly suited to the performance
of judicial functions. By the profound
learning that he displayed and absolute
fairness and impartiality with which he
presided over cases in that forum and his
career upon the Supreme Bench of this
State, though brief, stands as a monu
ment to his learning, to his erudition and
his integrity. His name, gentlemen of the
convention, will add to the strength of
this ticket, particularly in the northern
part of the State, where he is honored and
revered, and he will continue to do that
sort of thing upon the Supreme Bench
which we expect from a profound jurist.
(Applause.)
Judge Short of Fresnoâ This is not the
time fellow-Republicans for further
speech-making. Suffice it to say that in
the matter now under consideration by
this convention there is no politics. The
sole question for consideration is ability
and the honor and integrity of the gen
tleman who shall be nominated for the
postion here sought.
As une who has had opportunity of per
sonal knowledge and observation, as a
person who has as much interest as any
man in this State in fairness and hon
esty and ability of the Supreme bench of
this State, realizing that by reason of rhe
short term which he has occupied this
bench he is entitled to an indorsement
and re-election as a matter of right and
as a matter of courtesy. Realizing that
he is a man who inspires friendship, who
Inspires confidence, and who is an honest
friend and an honest man and an able
Judge, 1 second the nomination of Judge
Van Fleet. (Applause.)
Judge J. F. Davis of Amador â Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen of the conven
tion: Make no mistake about it. You
have come to the most important part of
your deliberations. In our complex sys
tem of government by checks and bal
ances the judiciary is the balance wheel.
People may lose faith in their Governors,
may lose faith in their Legislatures, but
if the American people lose faith in their
Judges the end is at hand of the Republi
can institutions.
To the judiciary is the life, the interpre
tation of the fundamental law of your
land, the interpretation of the constitu
tion itself. The maxim that Abraham
Lincoln gave in the middle of the war
is as correct in matters of judicial experi
ence as it is in war â "Don't stop .o swap
horses in the middle of a stream." (Ap
plause and cheers.) When you have found
a good man, tried and true upon the
bench, keep him there. I care not what a
man may have accomplished in other fields
of life, but I appeal in the matter of a fu
dicial nomination to his record as a law
yer and a Judge. I rise at this time from
force of my conviction and all the power
that is in me from my heart and my brain
to say to this convention that one of the
best names that you can place upon your
Judicial ticket Js \V. C. Van Fleet of San
Francisco. (Applause and cheers.; tie
started as a lawyer at the bar i:i this
town. He worked himself to the front at
this baf. His record as a Superior Judge
of Sacramento County for eight years in
this community of Sacramento, where if

votes in the heart of a lawyiv ftoarfva-"
tion and loyalty of the bar, namelyâ that
he is fearless, that he is able, that he is
fair and that he is correct in his decision.
That is a touchstone.
The man before whom you go to
try a case, feeling that you have a good
one, and know confidently that if the
law is with you he will be bound to give
it to you, and In brhalf of ability and
in behalf of fairness, in behalf of wide
learning, in behalf of everything that
goes to make a fearless Supreme Judge,
I rise at this time to second the nom
ination of W. C. Van Fleet of San Fran
cisco.
Mr. Matlock of Tehamaâ Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the convention: We
are all Republicans, or at least ought to
be. I desire on behalf of the Republi
cans of Tehama County and of Northern
California to present to you as a candi
date for a place upon the Supreme Bench
Hon. John F. Ellison of Tehama Coun
ty. (Applause.) Judge Ellison has been
a citizen of California for almost a quar
ter of a century, during which time he
has actively, energetically and honestly
discharged the duties incumbent upon
him as an attorney at the bar and as
Judge of the Superior Court of Tehama
County. It is an easy thing to win vic
tories in counties where you are all Re
publican, and when I near gentlemen
from other counties telling what they
have done in order to build up the Re
publican party and give grand victories
to the principles that It advocate?. I am
reminded that a Republican in Tehama
County, or in Shasta County, when he
easft his ballot is as potential as In a
county that gives 5000 majority for the
Republican ticket.
Judge Ellison has been a candidate and
elected twice to thf Superior Bench In Te
hftma County, defeating both times the
strongest men of the opposite party. Ho
is respectfd as a citizen, he is admired
and revered as a lawyer, and an honest
man. That is not a common thing in the
Democratic party, but we have lots of
thorn on our side. Now. gentlemen, let me
call your attention to a few things and
I trust I will not get over the five-minute
rule. It is a fact that two great wars
have come and gone and passed into his
tory. It is a fact that the whole political
appearance of this country since the elec
tion of Abraham Lincoln has changed in
policy, largely, but I tell you it has been
almost a third of n century since a man
in Northern California has had a placo
upon the judicial ticket. Generations of
men have come and gone, and still we are
up there fighting for the principles of the
Republican party and where are your Jus
tices of the Supreme Court from? Three
of them are from Sacramento County.
They don't want anything though. Where
are the balnnce of them from? Good
men, honored men. and all that sort of
thing, but we want sometimes to come In
for a part of this loaf. How long. O Lord,
shall we wait? (Laughter.) Hold ug here
and time will end and eternity commence,
but we will have no interest whatever in
our affairs.
We are entitled as Republicans to have a
place upon this ticket, because we are
true and loyal to the great principles <jf
the party. When I thought of Judge
Buckles being talked of here as bHng in
the great battle of Gettysburg I thought
of myself upon that occasion. I was
there, and I was almost scared to death.
(Laughter.) One of the reasons of that
was that I had too much exposure.
(Laughter.) We have the greatest navy, I
you are told, in the world. ; Spain has tne
greatest' submarine navy in ... the .worm
all under water. (Laughter.) Now, 1 un
dertake to say, gentlemen, that one -Re
publican is no better than another it ne
is an honest, man. 'If he knows the law
he is good for a Judge. (Cries â¢01
"Time."> ; Timeâ time will never end.
(Laughter and cheers.) We are entitled to
be recognized upon this ticket. AY c are
orphans of the. Republican: party. m
that matter â we have a mother, but we
have no ancestors. That is the condition
we are in. So : far ?as I am individually
concerned, I have no desire to have -ana
never have had a judicial office, because 1
never saw a. thing in the world tnat i
would not take sides on. (Applause.) it
is in my natureâ always has ueenâ be
for the bottom dog regardless of his color,
and 1 insist that we are. entitled to be
recognized upon this ticket. Judge JMij
son is an honest man. That is the hlgn
est compliment that you could pay to any
man. He is a lawyer of ability, and he is
a good Judge. Out of the forty or fifty
cases that have been appealed from his
court in the last eight â - years only four
have " been reversed in that time; ana
that was the fault of the Supreme Court.
(Applause and laughter.) As for,myseii,
it is just as natural for me to be a tie- j
publican as it is for a toad to hop. I in
sist that we are entitled to be recognized
upon this ticket. (Laughter and cheers.) ;
We are loyal as Republicans. We have
stood up and fought while we have .- a |
common enemy that outnumbers us and
we have got away with him. _ That is
the idea of it. I say to you that a quar
ter of a centuryâ a third of a cen
tury-has passed since we have been
recognized. Judge Sprague of Shasta
was nominated about thirty years ago
and he died a year afterward. (Laugh
ter and applause.) I insist that we ought
to be recognized. (Laughter). â â  We pre
sent you one of the ablest lawyers of
California for Judge, and an honest man,
and now I tell you in some localities that
is a rare thing. (Laughter.) I, have been
informed by the honorable gentlemen that
mv time is up. I will take an appeal.
(Laughter.) But I want you to remem
ber that we are entitled to be recognized
I say to you that there never was a. thing ;
that came before Judge Ellison or - his
consideration that did not receive atten
tion thorough investigation and a fair
decision, and I Insist that we are entitled
tO A be de r i e e C gÂ°ate 'from San , Â£?*Â£<%&
Chairman: I move you that the gentle
man be recognized. \. *Â«* â¦
Mr. Matlock-I move as a f substitute
that Judge Ellison be recr.emized How
long will you leave us out in the wilder
nesf and cold? Two-big wars have been
fought, and still we are standing out
there, orphans, and have had nothing to
do with it. We have been voting the
ticket and we can show a higher -per cent
of votes cast according to numbers and
fewer losses and no desertions. (Laugnter
* cVarfeTl Garter-Mr. Chairman and
gentlemen of this convention. I . will
take the liberty of recalling the atten
tion of this convention to the fact ] that
the Hon. John F. Ellison has been placed
in nomination as Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of this State. As an old
friend of Mr. Ellison, as a practitioner
at his bar. a long resident of Teh am a
County, as a present resident of the ad
joining county of Shasta. I am here to
night to add one voice in plea for recog
nition of our part of this State. lam
able to come here and speak from per
sonal knowledge to perhaps many who
are not acquainted with Mr. Ellison, and
I can confirm the opinions already
found in the multitudes of friends whom
he has gathered. around him and testily
before this convention that this man is
an absolutely pure man. He is a learned
man, he Is a Judge in every respect, he
is an affable man, he Is courtesy itself
joined to dignity and the strict observa
tion of the proprieties; he has learning,
resulting from studious habits; a T legal
mind, and he is in every respect a Judge.
We do not claim for him that he is the
bright particular star before whose light
all other luminaries are dim. but we do
say for him that if events should be so
ordered that he should be elevated to the
Supreme bench of this State, he will not
fall below the level of his surroundings,
and he will stand up on a plane of full
equality- with the society into which he
enters. We leave him to your gracious
acceptance, whose triumph shall better
publish his commendation. (Applause
and cheers.)
' Ernest Weyand of Colusaâ Mr. Chair
mam On behalf of Colusa County and
the northern part of the State, I will say
that Colusa County desires to second- the
nomination of Judge Ellison. There is
no â¢ more â  true saying that was uttered â  by
judge Matlock when; he was . nominating
Judge Ellison: "We are entitled to be
recognized; we are entitled to it and, we
should be recognized by this convention.
I second the nomination of Judge J. F.
Ellison of Tehama. -(Applause.)
. Orestes Orr â¢â¢ of Venturaâ Gentlemen
of the convention: I -rise to place in
nomination for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court the Hon. Benjamin P.
Williams of Ventura. Judge Williams
has had a long career upon the bench
in our section of the State. His decisions
have uniformly met with the approba
tion of the people with the possible ex
ception of fellows upon the other side.
We in that section of the State should
have something to say upon the matter
of the distribution of the Justices of the
Supreme Court, and I think we are en
titled to be heard upon it, representing
as we do more than a fifth of this con
vention here. We have not had for some
years a single member of the Supreme
bench of the State of California. We who
are attorneys, practicing at the bar down
here feel this to some extent and this is
known by all of you. The . interests of
that section of the State are somewhat
different from other sections'. .The liti

in the hands of A. J. Martin, one ot
the cleverest of political managers at
the convention. This combination of
facts resulted in one of the most em
phatic triumphs of the convention fÂ° r
Charles F. Curry.
After the adjournment of the con
vention to-night, there was practically
no effort on the part of candidates to
effect new combinations. The battles
were over this morning and the results
were published exclusively in The Call
this morning. These results were em
bodied in the forecast of the State
ticket, and were based, as already indi
cated, on a careful poll and canvass
of the convention. The accuracy of the
forecast was verified to-day by the
nominations made by the convention.
At this hour, 1:30 o'clock to-night, there
is no reason to amend the remainder of
the ticket, as published this morning:.
To-night the streets are crowded with
enthusiastic Republicans cheering their
nominee for Governor. The delegates
to the convention have one more day
of convention life before them and they
seem determined to inaugurate their
campaign of enthusiasm before they
leave.
placed upon the ticket, will add strength
to it not only in the southern but in any
portion of the State where he may come,
because he has that human Kindness in
his soul that attracts men to him. On
behalf of Ventura County I place the
name of Hon. Benjamin P. Williams be
fore this convention and ask his nomina
tion as Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. (Applause and cheers.)
EL Seviere of Humboldtâ Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of this convention: Not
withstanding the fact that the delegates
from the citrus belt seem to have for
gotten that Humboldt County is upon the
map of the State of California and seem
to have disregarded one thousand Re
publican majority which she will roll up
for the Republican ticket this fall, I sec
ond the nomination of a Jurist from the
citrus belt for Justice of the Supreme
Court There is not in the minds of the
Anglo-Saxon people a higher veneration
entertained for any American institution
than is entertained for the judiciary.
Tear down, if you will, every bulwark
of our freedom, but never dare trample
or besmirch the judiciary. You will re
member two years ago, in Chicago, the
Democratic convention met and performed
its labors, and but for an unwise criticism
upon the Supreme Court of the United
States the windbag from Nebraska would
have conducted the late war against
Spain. Now, in behalf of Humboldt Coun
ty, desiring a man in whom we can trust
and place the welfare of our widows
and orphans, of our old and in
firm and of God's unfortunate people, in
behalf of Humboldt Countyâ that county
famed for its unbounded forests â I rise to
second the nomination of Judge Williams
of Ventura as proper judicial timber for
Justice of the Supreme Court. (Applause
and cheers.)
H. C. Firebaugh of San Franciscoâ Mr.
Chairman, as a member of the San Fran
cisco delegation, I rise for the purpose of
seconding the nomination of Hon. J. F.
Ellison for Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court.
The nominations were then closed,
and the secretary was directed to
call the roll. At the conclusion of the roll
call the vote was anounced as follows:
Van Fleet 522, McFarland 475. Buckles 154.
Ellison 86, Williams 164. Smith 27. Clark
140. It was moved and seconded that the
nomination of Judges McFarland and Van
Fleet be made unanimous. Seconded and
carried.
The chairmanâ The next business in or
der will be the nomination of a candidate
for Secretary of State. Nominations are
now in order.
General A. L.. Hartâ Mr. Chairman and
gentlemen of the convention: It was in
timated on this floor to-day that the San
Francisco delegation was upon the slate
If the gentleman who made this state
ment in relation to that delegation will
only recall the history of the last four
years and remomber the occurrence in the
convention of this State and in this hall
four years ago he will become strongly
reminded of the fact that there is at least
one man of that delegation that is not
and never was slated and does not be
long to any association that is not in the
interests of the people. San Francisco has
but one slate. San Francisco during this
convention has asked for nothing. Our
delegates came here and honestly cast
their votes in favor of what they be
lieved to be the best interests of the
party. Our slate is Charles Curry. (Ap
plause and cheers.)
There has been no request â there has
been nothing askedâ of this convention
which would* have justified the gentlemen
who are associated with me upon that
delegation in joining in anything. We
have come here in behalf of San Francis
co's favorite son and we ask you gentle
men, without going into a long speech,
describing the war or tearing the flag to
give to San Francisco this nomination.
Our population justifies it and our can
didate is a popular man, known through
out the State as one of the strongest Re
publicans in California. This is all I have
to say and I believe that you will at least
accord to the village something and that
something is all that we ask â Charles
Curry.
Mr. Bowden of Santa Clara â Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of this convention:
Santa Clara County comes into this con
king for the nomination of Paul
ustin as Secretary of State. (Ap
plause and cheers.) Mr. Austin, gentle
ni. n. is upon no man's slate. Mr. Austin
comes here as unpledged us any man can
come 10 any convention of honest men
and honest Republicans. 1 will explain
to you, gentlemen, why it is that the
county of Santa Clara Bhould deserve
some representation upon the State ticket
ai this lime. For twenty-live years, gen
tlemen, the county of Santa Clara has re
ceived nothing at the hands of the Re
publican party of this State. For almost
ji quarter pt a centtiry Santa Clara Coun
ty Mood in the vanguard of Republican
ism in this State. That county to-day,
gentlemen, is rourth in population, ranks
fourth in wealth, among ail the great
communities of this great State of
California. I place population, gentle
men, before wealth, because it is a Re
publican population, and that is the best
and highest kind of population in this or
In any other State. Nnw, just one word
more, gentlemen, in reference to the can
didate that 1 name. You all know him.
Every man in this convention, I think,
knows Paul Austin. He is one of you.
He does not come here purely from the
county of Santa Clara. He is one of the
boya in the whole State, and you of San
Francisco â 1 am talking straight to you
nowâ you all know him. There is not a
delegate in this convention, gentlemen,
I think, coming from the great city and
county of San Francisco but knows Mr.
Austin. You know what he is. You
know his record. You know that he
comes before you with an untarnished
reputation. You know when he goes In
thÂ«- officÂ« of Secretary of Stateâ where
he will goâ that he will make a splendid
official.
Now something as to his record. In the
county of P.uita Clara where he belongs
at this time â of course, hereafter he will
belong in the great county of Sacramen
to â in the county of Santa Clara he has
received the highest majority as Mayor
of the city of San Jose that was ever
given to any candidate, either Democrat
ic, Republican or anything else, that was
ever presented before the people of that
county. After that, gentlemen, he was
nominated and elected a, member of the
Board of Supervisors of this great county
of Santa Clara, Subsequently to that, I
will be just as brief as possible, he was
nominated by the people of the county
bt Santa Clara and the city of San Jose
as a member of the appointing board
â which gave to the city of San Jose the
best municipal government that it ever
had so long as that city has existed. So
much, gentlemen, for the record of the
man we now nominate.
San Francisco has received a great many
things at the hands of this convention;
now give us hayseeds a chance. Give us
something. We come here asking you
only for this office. That is our slate, as
my friend. General Hart, says his slate
is Mr. Curry. Our slate is Paul P. Aus
tin. We give him to you, gentlemen, as
an honest man. We give him to you as
a man with a good record. We give him
to you now the same as an old soldier
would give up his sword â his best and his
highest possession. Nominate him. gen
tlemen, and he will add strength to your
ticket. Nominate him, and when the day
of election comes you will find that Paul
P. Austin will give the majority and the
strength that the Republican party needs
at the coming election. (Applause and
cheers.)
Judge Seward of Sierra, in behalf of
the delegation from Sierra County, sec
onded the nomination of Mr. Austin.
Mr. Marsden of San Francisco seconded
thr- nomination of Paul Austin. The nom
inations were then closed and the secre
tary directed to call the roll. During the
roll call the name of Paul Austin was
withdrawn from the convention, and on
motion, duly seconded, the nomination of
Charles F. Curry was made unanimous.
It was moved and seconded that the
convention adjourn until to-morrow
morning at 9:30 o'clock. Seconded and
carried.

be fostered and encouraged. In conclu

Receiving that support, he felt confident
that he would be elected by a handsome
majority.
Judge Davis of Placer moved that the

The convention then adjourned, after

the several counties in the district to â

Immediately after the adjournment of
the convention at noon to-day the mem- !
hers of the Forty-seventh Assembly Dis- i
tri< t met in their sets and elected Hugh
Diamond a member of the State Central '
Committee from Alameda County. The ,
j delegation then aujourned and visited the

ders of the institution and sampled its j
brew.
After caucusing on the candidates of
their choke the Nevada delegation this i
morning agreed on Charles E. Clinch of j
Grass Valley as its representative on the i
Congressional Committee and D. E. Mor- j
gan of Nevada as its choice for the post- I
tion of State Central Committee man.
Acting Chairman James Alva Watt of
the Fifth Republican District Convention
tried to effect a temporary organization I
of that body this afternoon without suc
cess. About three score delegates gath
ered in the north wing of Agricultural
Hall immediately after adjournment, but
owing to no notification being given a
majority of the members composing the
Fifth District were absent. This neces
sitated a postponement and the delegates
adjourned to meet again this evening.
Later, it was decided not to call another
meeting in Sacramento, but wait until
after the convention, when a meeting
will be called in San Francisco. This
will probably be next week, but in the
interim the candidates looking for the
nomination are on the anxious seat
An Interesting struggle for the plum is
now in progress and grow* warmer daily
Eugene F. Loud, the incumbent, is again
seeking the nomination. He is opposed i
by State Senator Eddie I. Wolfe and ex- !
Judge Daniel J. Murphy. The two last
named candidates have been in attend
ance on the convention and are energet
ically working to land the coveted nomi
nation. Mr. Loud's representatives
however, are not idle and are confident
that their man will again be named by
the Congressional convention.
H. O. Purington of Sutter County was
nominated last night in the Third Equal
ization District. For a time it looked as
if it would be impossible to secure a can
didate to run against "Dick" Beamer, the
Democratic nominee.
The convention was presided over by
Cutter of Yuba, Dndnon of Teharaa act
ing as secretary. When nominations were i
declared In order silence fell upon the
convention. The delegates looked at one
another to see who had a candidate, and
when the silence became almost oppren
slve Chairman Cutter broke the spell
by asking some one to trot out a candi
date The candidate stock was shy, and
there was another pause.
To break the monotony one of the dele
gates suggested that the nomination be
tendered to "Long Green" Lawrence.
"I guess he would take it," said an
other delegate.
"He would take almost anything."
"Thia is no time for Joking," said a
delegate from Tehama in chiding tones.
"We are here for work and not for horse
play," he concluded.
Chairman Cutter then came to the res
cue of the convention. "It seems that we
have no candidate," said he, "and under |
the circumstances I am willing to make j
a motion that we indorse Beamer. We
all know him and know hia record. It |
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 189 S.
would only be an act of justice to Indorse
him if we have not a candidate of our
own."
The suggestion mot with opposition.
"This is a Republican convention," said
one of the delegates, "and If we are un
able to make a nomination to-night I
would suggest that we adjourn, after
authorizing the State Central Committee
to till the vacancy."
It was at that juncture that the name
of H. O. Purington was presented, and
he was made the choice of the conven
tion.

NOR CORPORATION.
In His Acceptance of the Nomination
for Governor He Pajs Tribute
to Republicanism.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 24.â Henry T. Gage was in
troduced to the delegates at the conven
tion, after his nomination for the Gov
ernorship, by Chairman Neff. He was
greeted with loud, applause and spoke as
follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention: It is needless to say that no
words can express my thanks for the
honor of this nomination conferred upon
me by so distinguished and so representa
tive a body of my fellow-citizens. While
that is true, it is but fitting that my
gratitude should be expressed in deeds,
since the words, as I have just said, are
made' I promise you to go forth
anc" - / battle for this ticket with the
be4r -sHfill and judgment and energy I
possess (Applause), because I believe, in
my heart, that the welfare of this State
will be best subserved by a Republican
administration.
My Republicanism begun in my early
! boyhood, and it has passed through the
struggles of my early life and throughout
a professional career in California extend
: ing over a period of twenty-live years or
thereabouts. I had faith in the Republi
can party and was sincerely alive to it,
; because 1 saw in my early manhood; nay,
in my childhood, that the rank and tile of
the party were always battling for lib
erty and battling for right. (Applause.)
In 1563 the Republican party unlocked
the doors of slavery and liberated 3,000,
000 of slaves, and in I&9S it gave happiness
and freedom to the entire Cuban nation.
(Applause.) It has always battled for
the right, and a party that has always
been contending for liberty may be
! trusted in disposing of the rights of man.
! The Republican party is a safe guide.
j The rights of the workingman and the
j rights of property are secure un
' der Republican rule, but they are im
i perilled under a socialistic sentiment, un
der a single-tax sentiment or any other
I demagogic principles not founded on
sound ideas of justice.
I was born in the State of New York.
1 came to these Pacific siioi^s in my
boyhood. My interests have bee 1 here.
I have been engaged in business in Cali
fornia for more than a fifth of a cen
tury. What property I have, whatever
I have accomplished has beer, dour.' with
in the confines of California. While I
have achieved a little by my Independ
ent exertions, much has been done for
me by the people of this State. Just
i now you have been good to me. You
have conferred a distinguished honor
upon me.
Although having no adult relatives of
the Gage family west of the Rocky
Mountains, yet I love California, for my
wife and children are natives of this
State, and my admiration for my State
is best expressed when I say that I
would rather be Governor of California
than President of the United States. (Ap
plause.) This is a Republican year. It
needs Republican conservatism; it needs
Republican judgment; it needs Republi
can skill to handle the commercial ques
tions that shall grow out of this war,
which has so gloriously established the
prestige of the American flag, and by
peace the annexation of the Hawaiian
Islands. We trust to the intelligent ma
jority of California to reject the political
heresies of the Democratic-Populist par
ty, that heterogeneous party, the admix
ture of whose contrary doctrines is de
signed not for the betterment ot tne peo
ple but solely for the spoils of office. We
hope, in favor of the intelligence and the
exercise of that good judgment of our
people, that we will achieve a decisive
Republican victory in the coming con
test. I believe we shall have such. At
all events. I shall do everything legiti
mate in my power to reach that desired
goal.
Now. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of
the convention I know you are weary. 1
know that you do not care to be annoyed
with any lengthy discussion, either of the
general political questions of the hour or
otherwise, yet it is but just to you, since
we are about to separate soon and all to
go forth to battle for- the Republican
cause, that I should give you my assur
ance upon an important matter. I want
you to distinctly understand that in this
campaign for the Governorship I have
never made any political promise or com
bination with any living man or thing on
this earth. (Applause.) Not only that, I
promise you that, throughout this cam
paign, I will not debase nor degrade the
honor and the faith that you have con
fided in me by any such combination.

They are not discouraged because not
recognized, and are determined to wage a
bitter fight against Rea and his frang.
A full county ticket will be named by
the Good Government League. A few
Democratic and independent candidates
may be indorsed, but it is proposed to put
up an entire separate ticket.
The Good Government people affirm that
Rea has made all kinds of propositions to
them looking to a compromise, but they
refused all such offers. ThHr county con
vention is set for Saturday, but an ad
journment will then be taken for a couple
of weeks. The strongest men in the Re
publican party will be nominated. The
league has a membership of 1600. Mem
bers claim that they stand an excellent
chance of electing any ticket they nomi
nate, as decent people are so disgusted
with machine politics that they will flock
to the support of league candidates. The
frauds perpetrated at recent primaries
have aroused much adverse comment, and
citizens are loud in denouncing the meth
ods of Boss Rea.

SKIPPED WITH
HIS NUGGETS
A Klondiker Victimized
by His Wife.
The "tenderloin" is responsible for
another sensational robbery, and this
time it is of rather a peculiar nature
by reason of the fact that a wife de
spoiled her lord and master of the earn
ings of years.
William Walker returned from the
Klondike two- weeks ago and rejoined
Mrs. Walker after an absence of four
years, during which he toiled and en
dured the grim hardships of the frozen
northland. He brought with him some
thing over $4000 and deposited it In a
safe deposit in the Flood building.
The couple stopped at 850 Market
street and everything seemed to be
lovely. Last night Mr. Walker started
for the prizefight, but changed his mind
and returned to his rooms. He found
that his wife had abandoned him and
investigation revealed the fact that she
had drawn $4200 from the bank and
placed $200 of it in the pocket of a coat
of his in the apartments.
Walker was heartbroken. He says
that one of the worst features of the
case is the fact that she took the deed
to his Klondike mine, the sale of which
he had just negotiated for $10,000.
Chief Lees and several detectives
were on the case during the night and
succeeded in tracing the woman to
Oakland, where she went on the 9
o'clock boat. It is expected that she
will be arrested this morning, as it is
presumed by. her husband that she has
started for Montana, where she has
several children by a former husband.
ON THE VERGE
OF STARVATION
Workmen Are Penniless
at Barcelona.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 189 S. by James Gor
don Bennett. j
GIBRALTAR, Aug. 24.â 1n Barcelona
the labor question seems to be ap
proaching an acute stage. It is esti
mated that something like 6000 work
men are penniless and on the verge of
starvation.
Articles of primary necessity have
reached ; exaggerated prices and to cap
all is the heat, which is terrific and
causing outbreaks of disease among the
semi-starving. This is all the ; more
serious inasmuch as â¢ Barcelona is a
regular hotbed of republicanism. The
Publicidad, a cleverly conducted paper
of ferociously republican type, has
twice incurred the, displeasure of Cap
tain , General Dcs Pujols and has on
each occasion j been fined, but the sec
ond time the proprietor was informed
that another offense would incur sup
pression.
This really means a political conflict,
and its effect will bubble over to the
surface again at the first favorable op
portunity. Then again there is a so
ciety * formed in Barcelona with the
avowed object of seeking annexation
to France, and being so near the fron
tier and approachable in various - di
rections, the situation is extremely fa
vorable to the. inception of revolution
ary operations whether instituted by
Carlists or others. :^3|||i||

heavy rope was passed around the
trucks and pulling began by another
engine. Suddenly the rope broke, and
the end in which was the loop and a
heavy steel eye struck both men in the

UTAH VOLUNTEERS
HAVE GRIEVANCES
Company A Complains of 111-Treat
ment, but Is Pacified by
Captain Came.
MADERA, Aug. 24.â Company A,
First Utah Volunteers, who left San
Francisco on August 13 for patrol duty
at the national parks, departed from
here this morning, sixty-five, under the
command of Captain Joseph E. Kane,
going to Yosemite Park, and thirty-five,
under Lieutenant B. X. Smith, to the
Sequoia reservation in Tulare County.
Considerable dissatisfaction pre
vailed among the company on account
of the neglect of the quartermaster to
properly look after the food supply. On
their arrival at Madera at 10 o'clock on
Monday morning, after a twenty-five
mile ride in the hot sun. no provision
was made for rations until about 7
o'clock that evening. Those who got
anything to eat during the day had to
pay for it at the hotels and restaurants.
On account of this and other grievances
some of the men signed a petition ask
ing to be mustered out of the service.
When Captain Came heard of the in
subordination he sent for the leaders
and explained to them the nature of
the military offense they were commit
ting, whereupon they dropped the mat
ter.
In addressing the company the cap
tain said that he wanted to annul an
order he had recently issued to the
effect that he would not be bothered
with the private or military differences
and troubls of the men. This order
seemed to have been responsible to a
certain extent for the insubordination.

600 sick and wounded, whom I have provided
with beef.
There is perfect order In the town: new
municipal authorities have been elected and
everything is working regularly. The Lnited
States steamship Nashville was in the harbor
when I entered. I requested its commander to
ask his government to open this port to for
eign commerce, or with the United States at
least, for there Is great scarcity of provisions.
The Spaniards took everything they could.
General Luque is In Holguin with 12,000 men
and 24 cannon and I am trying to force him
out, although 1 can only count on 4000 men and
four cannon with which to fight him. v olun

FIND A PLANT
FOR MAKING
BOGUS COIN
Solution of a Mystery That
Has Long Puzzled the
Local Detectives.
Counterfeiter's Outfit Discovered
by a Mere Accident Near
San Rafael.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
e>AN RAFAEL, Aug. 24.â For several
months a clever counterfeiter of gold
and silver coin has been at work flood
ing: the marts of trade in this county
and San Francisco with spurious
money. During all this time detectives
and secret service agents have been in
dustriously at work searching for a
clew that would lead to the identity of
the rogue or rogues, without any tan
gible result. To-day a little San Rafael
. schoolboy discovered by accident a clew
that led the county authorities to the
very spot where the bogus coin has been
manufactured and placed them in pos
session of the plant.
The malefactor himself is known and
tn-nierht a United States Deputy Mar-
Btaal is in town aiding the authorities in
-their work of discovering his where
abouts.
For a long time business men in this
city have been reporting to Sheriff Har
rison and Under Sheriff Cottingham"
that some person was placing counter
felt coin in circulation. In Sausalito
especially has this been true. Two
months ago a large quantity of the bo-

terfeiting Outfit Was Hidden.
gus coin war- dumped into the coffers ,l
of the poolroom brokers. ThÂ»> playing
of this monej was; kept up so steadily
that the fact was reported to Chief ;
Lc-es and several detectives were sent
over to investigate the matter. Their
work came to caught, however, for the
clever operator 1-arned that detectives
were on his trail and thereafter dis
posed of his money In Pan Francisco.
Yesterday Uttle Harry Obits, a son of
Mrs. Jacob oiiitz, proprietress <Â»f the j
Linden roadhouse on Petaluma avenue,
-went hunting on San Rafael Hill. In a I
ravine on the northern side of the hill,
about one-half mile from town, he !
found a part of a mold for half dol
lars and took it home to his mother.
Acting on her advice he took the piece
of mold to Constable W. J. Trainor,
who had the boy lead him to the spojf
where it was found. A discovery was :
there made that filled him with
amazement.
On the side of (he mountain is a
vineyard and at Its lower end is a small
fruleh. In this ravine, secure from ob
servation, the counterfeiter had his j
headquarters. His bed was spread on j
PART OF A MOLD USED BY SCHULTZ IN
HIS WORK.
the ground under a large oak tree and
various cooking utensils were scattered I
about, while a set of buggy harness?
hung on a tree near by. Close to the
tree under which was the rogue's bed
a culvert opened from the vineyard
above. In this cuivert had been hidden
a complete counterfeiter's outfit.
Packed into a dry goods box were
seventeen molds for coins of various
denominations, from a dollar to a dime.
The twenty, ten and five dollar gold
coins were also represented. Acids, a
bucket of charcoal and an electroplat
ing outfit were found buried at the base
of the large oak. All the molds were
made of cement. In addition to sundry
other articles the box also contained a
volume entitled the "Techno-Chemical
Receipt Book." In the book certain
passages relating to the making of
molds with cement and to electroplat
ing were marked in lead pencil.
â¢ Trainor secured the outfit and
brought It to the Sheriff's office in a
buggy. Driving hurriedly back to Mrs. '
Obitz's house he learned that the man ;
wlki had been living in the canyon had ;
applied at her house for a room about
three months ago. He had secured the
room, but had spent little of his time
there, being seen every day to drive I
up the rough mountain road leading to
the ravine in a cart drawn by a bay
horse. He was described as a man of
medium height, evidently a native of j
Germany, with a florid face, high cheek
bones and a sandy mustache, shot with
gray hairs. He was last seen going up
the mountain road the day before yee- :
terday.
Trainor returned to the Sheriff's of- |
flee and was lucky enough to discover |
a portrait among the effects of the \
counterfeiter, which was identified by ;
Mrs. Obitz and others as that of the
man himself. Trainor at once recog
nized it as a man whom he had arrest
ed about five weeks ago for vagrancy,
but who was not committed by the
Justice owing to the fact that he was
able to show plenty of money. He had
refused to give his name to the ar
resting officer, but to Mrs. Obitz, at the
time of asking for a room, he had given
the name of Henry Schultz, which is
believed !b be fictitious.
After consulting with Constable
L,ouis Hughes Trainor notified United
States Marshal Baldwin of the dis
covery, and this evening a deputy was I
sent here. A guard was placed over |
the mountain "den," and all the incom
ing trains were watched, but Schultz,
as he called himself, did not put In an
appearance. The police have been noti
fied and furnished with a complete de
scription of the man, and are now
busily looking for a clew that will lead
to his whereabouts in San Francisco or
elsewhere. __

SECRETARY ALGER
IS NOW PREPARING
TO OFFSET MILES
Telegrams That Will Show the
Inconsistency of the
General.
NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: An open quarrel
between Secretary Alger and Major
General Miles seems inevitable.
The publication this morning of an
Interview credited to General Miles in
regard to the Santiago campaign in
which General Miles makes it appear
that his dispatches were garbled for
ulterior purposes by somebody in
Washington and that his recommenda
tions were disregarded and his orders
to General Shafter disobeyed, has ten
ded to increase the friction which has
unquestionably existed for a long time
between the Secretary of War and the
commanding general.
In the absence of Secretary Alger no j
one at the department to-day would '
discuss for publication the reported in- !
terview with General Miles, but con
slderabte irritation was felt through- j
out the War Department and every one i
is looking forward to some very lively j
times when General Miles returns to j
Washington.
The statements attributed to General
Miles are so much in Ikie with recent
publications emanating from his

friends here that no one questions the
accuracy of the interview.
The statement that the War Depart
ment garbled Miles' dispatches so as to
put him in a bad light before the pub
lic is emphatically denied. It is not de
nied, however, that many of his dis
patches have not as yet been made
public. A complete- record of all the
dispatches sent to and received from
General Miles has been kept, and when
made public. I am told, will show so
many inconsistencies in the various
recommendations by General Miles that
considerable difficulty will be experi
enced in determining what his line of
policy has been in many cases. This
is said to be particularly thus in re
gard to the recommendations he made
about affairs in Santiago.
In anticipation of Congressional in
vestigation of the conduct of the war,
instructions have already been given
to have all the correspondence put in
shape for transmission to Congress
when called for. Indeed, It is said Sec
retary Alger contemplates appointing
boards of Investigation of all subjects
which promise to be matters of Con

RUMORED ATTEMPT

Apparently well-founded rumors were afloat In this city and
throughout the United States yesterday that an attempt had been

Vfforuf'to secure definite information on the subject proved un

NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â Rumors reached New York to-day to the
effect that Collis' P. Huntington had been shot. Inquiries by wire
poured in by scores from San Francisco to Mr. Huntington's friends
and business associates. None of them had heard of the rumor, and
at his office, in the Mills building, no credence was given to the rumor.
Mr Huntington is spending the summer at Camp Pine Knot, on

NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Senator William P. Frye,
whose appointment as the third mem
ber of the peace commission was fore
shadowed in the Herald this morning,
has accepted and will meet Secretary
Day and Senator Davis in this city to
morrow to confer upon the work of th^>
commission.
I was told by a member of the Cab
inet to-night that these were the only
three members of the commission yet
selected. The same authority stated
that Justice White of the Supreme
Court was still a strong probability.
My informant said that former Secre
tary Tracy was no longer considered in
connection with the commission. There
are reasons for believing that Mr
Tracy was tendered the position, but
declined to serve.
President McKlnley expects to offi
cially announces the names of all five
commissioners on Friday next, wh<?n
formal instructions will be given 1o
them. These will be read and acted
upon at a Cabinet meeting. The. in
structions to be given them are now
being prepared at the State Depart
ment and will be informally discussed
by Secretary Day and Senators Davis
and Frye when they meet at the otate
Department to-morrow.
Senator Davis arrived in the city to
day and had a long conference with
the President and subsequently with
Secretary Day. When I saw him to
day he was in a happy frame of mind
and quite willing to discuss any ques
tion except that relating to the Philip-
Dines Territorial expansionists will
have every reason to be pleased with
the appointment of Senators Davis
and Frye, as they are both known to
favor the retention of all that has been
won by the war.
TYPOTHETAE 07? AMERICA.
MILWAUKEE. Aug. 24.â The United
Typothetae of America convened its
twelfth annual meeting at the Hotel
Pfister to-day, with about 150 delegates
in attendance. A. J. Aikens, president
of the Milwaukee Typothetae. and
Mayor Rose welcomed the delegates,
response being made by Louis A. Wy
man of Boston.
The annual report of the executive
committee, which furnished matters for
discussion during the convention, was
read.
President W. L. Burdick, in his an
nual address, noted with pleasure that
during the past year disturbances have
been brought to a satisfactory settle
ment in most cases. "Employers and
employes have begun to see at last that
their interests are not antagonistic;
that one side cannot succeed by crip
pling and harassing the other." said
the speaker, "and that it is for their
mutual interest to uphold and help
each other in all lawful ways. Ido not
wish to intimate that the millennium
has arrived, but surely the tendency
should be in the direction of a har
mony of interests; the workman doing
what he can to enable his employer to
make money enough to keep out of
bankruptcy and pay his weekly salary
list and the proprietor to pay his hands
what he can consistently afford out of
the profits of his business."
Treasurer Donnelly reported a bal
ance in the treasury of $2314.
President J. H. Bowman of the Inter
national Printing Pressmen and As
sistants' Union was admitted to ad
dress the convention on a nine-hour
work day, which, he said, would be
demanded about September 1, and thir
ty days given the employers to meet
the demand. He hoped an amicable
agreement could be reached.
A warm debate was had. but no ac
tion was taken by the convention up to
adjournment for the day.

Their Colonies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 25.â A dispatch to the
Standard from Madrid by way of
France says: A very unfavorable im
pression has been caused in Madrid by
telegrams attributing to President Mc-
Kinley the intention of instructing the
peace commissioners to insist upon the
cession of Luzon, that American com
merce should have the same footing as
Spanish in the Philippines and that
Spain should pledge Itself that none of
the Spanish colonies should be ceded to
European powers.
If such are the intentions of the
United States Government the negotia
tions are very sure to be' laborious, even
if an understanding is ever arrived at.
The Spaniards consider the cession of
Luzon, their best and most important
island, to be a death blow to their. pres
tige and sovereignty in these regions,
and *jÂ«vould be irretrievably j
wealuÂ£Â£~Â£ jL jT*he presence of Ameri
cans in the Heart of their colonies.
Commercial equality with the United
States in the archipelago would annul !
the only advantage -â¢ and compensation i
which they might have expected â  to
have derived from the cost and sacri
fices which have been necessary ,to
maintain their rule in the archipelago.
The . separation of church and State
would be most unpalatable to most
Spaniards and would create grave dif
ficulties in their relations with the Vat
ican and the church, let alone the re
ligious orders in Spain, which are al
ways disposed to side with Don Carlos
against the present dynasty.
Last, but , not least, any pledge to re
frain frc-m ceding any part to the pow
ers' would displease many statesmen
and people of all classes who are daily
more and more inclined to advocate the
sale of the Spanish archipelagoes to the
highest bidder, especially to the conti
nental powers most -likely to be in po
sition to arrest the growth of American
political and commercial influences in
the Far East:

Ranch Hand Killed Near
Balls Ferry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING. Aug. 24.â Early this
morning W. S. Spencer shot and killed
John Cummings, an ex-employe. Cum
mings had been working for Spencer
on his ranch near Balls Ferry for sev
eral months. On August 6 a little dif
ficulty arose between the men regard
ing wages. This morning, while Mr.
and Mrs. Spencer were eating break
fast in their dining-room, Cummings
walked In and began abusing Spencer,
who told him that â¢ he wanted no
trouble with him and for him to leave
the premises. He immediately grabbed
Spencer by the throat and threw him
against the table.
Spencer recovered himself and went
into the room where his wife was,
leaving Cummings alone in the dining
room. Cummings sat. down at the
table, ate a few bites, then walked out
of the house, again making his appear
ance on the front porch and looking
through the open doorway at them. He
again began his abuse, and grabbing
a hatchet which was lying near â¢by
] hurled it. at Spencer, but missed him.
; Spencer reached for a shotgun which
hung near the doorway and as Cum
mings advanced tired at him; hitting
him. Cummings did not stop, but
picked up a piece of stove wood and
threw it at Spencer. Spencer dodged
the missile and at the same time fired
another shot. Cummings turned and
walked away, passing through the gate
and falling as he got outside.
Spencer came to Redding and Im
mediately gave himself up and his
stepson started to Anderson . for as
sistance.*

The British ships Thornliebank and Mayfield anchored inside the lightship on Tuesday night in a

spent a few hours of the morning shooting at tne sea monster. The whale apparently enjoyed being struck by
the bullets, for it spouted about the vessels until the ship masters gave up the sport.

OPPOSED TO AN ALLIANCE.
Stanley Speaks of the Friendship of
England and America.
CHICAGO, Aug. 24.â Henry M. Stanley,
the famous explorer, journalist and au
thor, once an American Citizen and now a
member of the English House of Com
mons, has placed himself on record as op
posed to the Anglo-American alliance. He
recognizes the fact that England and
American are bound together by numer
ous ties and are yearly drawing closer to
gether, but, in spite of that fact, he ad
vises caution and thinks It to the interest
of neither nation to adopt a fettering and
entangling alliance. In a letter to a
friend here he expresses himself as fol
lows:
"My opinion is w*Â» must not be pre
cipitate. The two nations are gravitating
together, and true friendship cannot be
forced. It is a slow process, requiring
time. If either country were in distress,
that would be the proper time to breathe
more life into that spirit of friendship and
kindness which we know exists and to
bring these reserved and proud peoples
together. But to-day there is no neces
sity for either nation to think practically
about the matter. One is fat and proud,
with the Bank of England and its big
navy. The other Is in a quiver of de
light over Manila and Santiago and the
glorious heroism of Dewey. Schley and
Bhafter. The time 1b not suitable for
speaking of alliance. If you Americans
come out of that continent and take your
share of the Old World's concerns you
will know better what an alliance means."
RUSSIAN HARVESTS FAIL.
In Many Districts the Distress of
Last Year Is Renewed.
LONDON. Aug. 24 âThe St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Times says: Qreat
uneasiness is felt over the repetition of
last year's failure of the harvest. In
seven districts of the province of Kazan
and largely also in the province of Sa
mara, Sartoff. Simbirsk, Viatka and
Perm, the crops are almost worthless.
Even the landed gentry are beginning to
ask the Government for relief, and the
prospects of a famine an.' most grave.
The Ministers of the Interior and of Fi
nance are sending out agents to make in
quiry and to purchase corn. The Zemst
vos are bestirring themselves to meet the
situation. It is reported that in some dis
tricts the peasantry are breaking Into the
communal granaries and helping them
selves.

There Will Be a Great Parade of the
Knights of Khorassan in Full
Arabic Costumes, the Most
Unique Yet Held.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aue. 24.â The
Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias,
to-day continued work on the charges
of extravagance that have been made
against the supreme officers by some of
the representatives. One of the mem
bers of that committee announced this
morning that he would bring suit for
libel in the United States court for the
District of North Carolina as soon as
he got home.
While a strong fight is being made
against the supreme officers, it is un
derstood that the present officers will
be continued. Ninety votes have been
pledged to Judge Carter of California
for supreme vice chancellor, and in the
event that he cannot be elected, his
strength will be thrown to some one
against Charles E. Chiveley, who is
being pushed for the place by the
Knights "f Indiana.
J. F. Abbott of Massachusetts and J.
A. Turner of Virginia this morning an
nounced themselves as candidates for
major general of the Uniform Rank,
but the indications are that James R.
Carnahan of Indianapolis will be
elected.
A seat in the Supreme Lodge was re
fused this morning to Representative
Berry of Wisconsin on account of the
filing of a written protest that he se
cured his credentials in an irregular
way. He demanded an investigation,
and a committee was appointed for
that purpose.
The major general reviewed the Uni
form Rank at Camp Colgate this aft
ernoon.
The Knights of Khorassan this aft
ernoon re-elected John A. Hinzey of
Chicago imperial prince, W. E. R.
Belding of St. Louis imperial secretary
and H. B. Stolte of Chicago imperial
treasurer.
The laws of the order were amended
so as to create offices for three supreme
past imperial princes, changes were
made in the constitution providing for
the election of alternate delegates, and
there is no requirement now that the
author of the ritual shall be a member
of the order.
The great parade of the Knights of
Khorassan in full Arabic costumes, to
take place to-morrow evening, will be
the largest and most unique of its kind
ever attempted. About 5000 uniformed
men will be in the rank, and the im
perial officers will be escorted by the
First Regiment Indiana Knights of
Uniform Rank.
Supreme Chancellor Colgrove has ap
pointed John H. Alexander of Virginia
and William B. Dole of Massachusetts
supreme tribunals. These appoint
ments are for six years. Representative
Gale succeeds George Seavy of Tennes
see.
At Camp Colgrove to-day the prize
drills began. Companies from Kala
mazoo, Mich.. Alliance. Ohio, and Otta
wa, 111., drilled in class A. The drills
took place at Colby Oval, near Camp
Colgrove, in the presence of several
thousand persons. A cavalry' drill was
put up by the St. Joseph (Mo.) Hus
sars, the only troop entered. The prize
is $500, but it is a question whether
it will be awarded, since there were no
competitors.
At the session of the Rathbone Sis
ters to-day twenty-six past grand
chiefs took the supreme temple degree.
The Knights of Khorassan elected the
following officers to-day: Sublime ven
erable prince, J. M. Stratton, Philadel
phia; imperial prince, John A. Hinzey,
Chicago; imperial bashaw, James G.
Owen, Evansville, Ind.; imperial kadi,
H E. Parker Jr., Galesburg, 111.; im

The Ex-Pilot Boat Caleb Curtis en
Her Way Here From China
With a Party of Gold-
Hunters.
The supply of Australian coal in this
market was largely augmented yesterday.
Three vessels from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
made port during the day, and two more
put in an appearance. Tuesday night the j
ships Mayneld and Thornliebank were ;
outside, and when the wind fell light they |
were anchored inside the lightship. When '.
the fog lifted in the morning they were
picked up by the tugs Reliance and Res- i
cue and towed into port. Later the bark
Inversnaid hove in sight, but her captain
refused a tow until late in the afternoon.
This left outside the bark Inverurie and
the ship DuchaJburn, and in their com
pany was the American ship Santa Clara,
from Karluk, with a cargo of canned sal
mon, the first of the season. The Thorn
liebank made the best run of the quintet.
She came here from Newcastle in sixty
seven days, while the others were 74, 75,
76 and 78 days.
While the Thornliebank and Mayneld
were lying at anchor on the bar yesterday
morning Captains McÃrlde and Phllllpps
had some target practice with a gray
back whale for a target. They got fifteen
or twenty bullets into the mammal, but
it seemed rather to enjoy the sensation.
Captain McÃride claims an acquaintance
ship of nearly two years with the whale.
When the Thornliebank was being built
In Scotland a whale visited the shipyard
In which she was lying on the stocks.
Captain McÃride was superintending the
construction of the vessel, and he and a
dozen others thought it would be a good
joke to lassoo the whale. A steel hawser
was passed over the mammal's dukes and
then made fast to a pile. Now, this pile
was the main support of some staging on
which stood Captain McÃride and his
friends. With a swish of its mighty tail,
away went the whale and away
went the pile and splash went Cap
tain McÃride and his friends into the
waters of the Clyde. Their rescue took
some time, and when they collected their
senses whale, hawser and pile were gone.
Captain McÃride will not vouch for the
pile, but he asserts that the whale which
visited the Thornliebank yesterday morn
ing had something fast to his flukes, and
he believes it is the one that paid his ship
a visit when she was on the stocks two
years ago.
The launch Amy was out all of yes
terday with Charles E. Paxton and Hen
ry Peterson aboard, searching for the
body of Mrs. Paxton, who was drowned
a week ago yesterday by the overturn
ing of the Scandla's launch. Yesterday
morning the bereaved husband patrolled
the entire water front in the Amy and
went as far south almost as Baden.
During the afternoon he went over to
Goat Island and from there to the Berke
ley flats. No one in San Francisco knows
the bay better than Henry Peterson, so
that every current and eddy that would
move the body will be followed system
atically. It will therefore only be a mat
ter of time when the remains will be re
covered.
The ex-pilot boat Caleb Curtis is on her
way back to this coast. She is on her
way to Alaska with a party of gold
hunters from Hongkong, and is to stop
here on her way north. On July 9 she
put into Yokohama for water and sailed
again two days later. The Curtis was a
well-known pilot boat on the bar years
ago. and was once wrecked on Point Bo
nita. A few years ago she was sold, and
some parties here fitted her out as a
sealer. She went over to the coast of
Japan and made a fair catch, but her
captain not only sold It but also the ves
sel and then disappeared. The Curtis
was in Hongkong when the captain sold
her and there she remained until Cap
tain Whistler, late of the Northern Pa
cific Company's steamer Tacoma, secur
ed and fitted her out for a voyage to the
Klondike.

Why They Were Absent.
The family of the late Dr. John F.
Morse wishes It stated that there were
private funeral services at the home at 9:30
a. m. Tuesday, conducted by Dr. Cook of
Trinity Church, and that It was felt that
the strain of the public Masonic services
later In the day could not be undergone.
Hence the absence of members of the
doctor's family. The remains of Dr.
Morse were cremated at Odd Fellows'
Cemetery.
SWINDLED BY
HIS ATTORNEY
Miser P. Cunningham
as Prosecutor.
LAWYER COMYNS DEFENDANT
RECEIPT FOB BAIL MONEY
STOLEN AND CASHED.
Comyns Is Arrested on the Charge
of Petty Larceny
by Trick and
Device.
Attorney E. M. Comyne was arrested
yesterday afternoon by Corporal Gei
tnann on a warrant charging him with
petty larceny by trick and device.
The complaining witness is Peter Cun
ningham, the old miser who was sen
tenced on Monday by Judge Conlun to
six months in the County Jail for va
grancy. Cunningham gave notice of ap
peal, and Tuesday was released on giv
ing $50 cash bail. When he got back his
property from the property clerk he dis
covered that the receipt for his bail
money of $50, which he had deposited for
his release on August 17, was missing, and
further inquiry showed that the receipt
had been presented by Comyns to Clerk
Rivers of Judge Conlan's court, who gave
him an order on the Treasurer for the
amount.
Cunningham notified Captain Seymour
of the facts, and acting under the cap
tain's advice he yesterday swore to the
warrant for Comyns' arrest. His bonds
were fixed at $300. An attempt was made
to get Judge Joachimsen to release him
on nis own recognizance, but it failed,
and Comyns had to remain in the cell
along with other prisoners.
Cunninghams statement is that Com
yns spoke to him in the dock last week
and promised that he would get the
charge against him dismissed for a fee
of $10. Cunningham, accompaniea by an
officer, went to the xiibernla Bank and
drew $60â $10 for Comyns' fee and $50 for
his ball. Comyns advised him to give his
bank books into his custody for safety,
and in an envelope in one of the Dank
books was the receipt for the $50 bail
money and the receipt from Comyns for
his $10 fee. Chief Lees last Saturday
compelled Comyns to return to Cunning
ham his bank books, and they were given
into the custody of the property clerk.
Meantime Comyns had abstracted the re
ceipt for the bail money and had present
ed it to Clerk Rivers, receiving the
amount from the Treasurer.
It was principally owing to Comyns
treatment of a client named O'Malley
that Captain Seymour issued the order
some months ago preventing attorneys
from entering the prison except when
sent for by a prisoner. O'Malley was
charged with failure to provide and bat
tery upon his wife, and arter Comyns got
all" the money possible out of him he
dropped him. Comyns was also arrested
recently for battery upon Flora St. Clair.
a woman who accused him of getting all
her money on the promise of marriage
and then refusing to have anything to do
with her. ,
A "MIDDLE MAN" CATJGHT.
Shew Tong Charged With Conspiring
to Land Immigrants Illegally.
Officials from the Chinese Bureau cap
tured Shew Tong, a Chinese cook, yes
terday afternoon, and think they have
sufficient evidence to convict him of con
spiring to land Immigrants Illegally.
Shew Tong cooks for a restaurant
which has the contract for feeding Chi
nese held for examination, and as he car
ries the food into them he has always
had free access to the building where
they are quartered. His movements have
been closely watched for some time, and
yesterday afternoon he was arrested Just
as he was about to enter the building.
When searched he was found to have a
number of papers with the questions that
would be asked the coolies when brought
up for investigation, and the proper an
swers to make, together with the evi
dence given by witnesses who have al
ready been examined.
Bebecka C. Meyn's Will.
The will of Rebecca C. Meyn. who died
on the 12th inst., leaving an estate valued
at $10,000. was filed for probate yesterday.
The entire estate was bequeathed to Peter
Henry Mqyn. a son of the testatrix, to
hold in trust for the purpose of paying
off mortgages and taxeÃ and to improve
the realty and to pay the husband of de
ceased, Peter Meyn. $20 monthly during
his life and to divide the residue of the
income between himself and his brother,
William Meyn. At the death of the sons
and husband of the testatrix the estate
is to be divided equally among their heirs.
Guilty of Contempt.
Daniel J. Brennan was adjudged guilty
of contempt of court by Judge Seawell
yesterday, because of his failure to pay
Lllla Brennan alimony In accordance with
an order of court. Brennan was sentenced
to imprisonment in the County Jail until
such time as he paid alimony in the sum
of $40. He was granted a stay of execu
tion of two days In order to give him an
opportunity to get the money.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â There was several
quite important elements of positive strength ;
In the stock market to-day, but the preponder- |
â¢ cting influence of several features and the very I
heavy profit taking by large holders of leading
â â¢' -stocks nullified them. The last prices were In
nearly all cases below those of last night. The I
London market followed yesterday's New York I
" weakness and affected the opening here, caus- ;
ing declines in some of the Internationals. The
" Grangers made a strong opening In spite of J
selling for London' account on account of the |
high level of earnings disclosed by St. Paul's
statement for the third week in August. The
Increased movement of grain in the Northwest,
which has weakened wheat for the last few
days, is probably reflected in those earnings,
â which were $33,338 In excess of last year and
over $14 00 in excess of the high level for the
corresponding period in 1892. The grain move
ment, though augmented, is not yet up to last
year's profit by the people of the West. The
sharp advance in the Grangers at the opening, ;
due to the buying by commission houses and ;
bidding up of prices by traders, resulted only ]
â  in bringing very heavy offers to realize. There ,
was change of speculative interest from St.
Paul and the Grangers into some of the low I
priced stocks with dividend prospects. Northern
Pacific was most conspicuous In this class and
was absorbed In enormous blocks, closing at
the top at an advance of 1%. Union Pacific
sympathized in a less degree, but the preferred
stocks in neither case were largely taken. Ru- '
mors of an agreement to arbitrate the war !
with the Canadian Pacific helped to impart
strength to the transcontinental roads.
. There was marked strength in some of the
speculative bonds to-day, but prices reacted to
some extent in sympathy with the later weak
ness in stocks. Total sales, $4,210,000.
United States 4s advanced 1 per cent and the ,
Bs, when issued, declined % in the bid price.

LONDON MARKET.
iraw: YORK, Aug. â¢ 24.â Evening Post" a
Ixindon financial cablegram cays: The stock
markets here were irregular to-day, but had a
good tone, especially for Investment stocks, the
cnttnued absence of gold exports to New York
having the effect of easing the money market.
Americans opened dull on New York prices and
stock was sold here, but the market shows con
siderable strength and it is believed that the
next settlement will not show much of a bull
account here. Grand Trunk was higher, the
truffle receipts being better than had been
anticipated.
There was a sharp rise In Spnnish 4s to 42Vs
on Paris support and the rise in Spanish ex
change on London, which has for the moment
checked the Spanish buying in silver.
De lloers mines were again flat.
The new rupee loan offered to-day In India
was a little over applied for, the average price
of the nllotment, 94-v 4 , being Vi above the
minimum.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Aug. 24.â Liverpool market.
Instead of showing sympathy with yesterday's
strength here, was lower by %d for September
and %d for December. That was the principal ;
reason for a slight decline here at the start. |
The depression did not last long, and In a short
lime from the opening the market became |
quite strong. September rising %c above the ;
previous day's closing price. London reported i
good demand for cargoes on passage and that
helped things a little, but the chief reason for
the strength that bo quickly succeeded the first
decline was the nervousness of September
shorts on account of small stocks here and the
slight prospect for their speedy increase. Ad
vices from the spring wheat region favored the
expectation of continued liberal receipts. Some
reports were to the effect that the results of
threshing were disappointing, but such reports
did not disturb the general impression that a
spring wheat crop had been raised exceeding
the crop of any former season. The firmness
in futures was well maintained until the Paris
and Antwerp markets reported for the day.
Paris reported November and February wheat
SO centimes, or equal to 4%c a bushel, lower i
and Antwerp showed a loss of l%e a bushel. â 
\ September broke on the weakness abroad, but |
firmed up a fraction Just before â  the close. !
I September left off %c lower and December de-
I clined %c on the day.
Corn at the start acted In a way to make
glad the hearts of the bulls and then turned
around and rended them. The early advance i
was due to heavy buying on damage reports |
from Kansas and Nebraska. Later when these j
reports were denied the tumble left the closing
prices at the low point of the day, with a loss !
of %4j%c for September.
The firmness of oats was attributed to re
ports of considerable damage to that grain
from the heavy rains. September left off un- |
changed to %c higher.
Provisions ruled strong because of the disap
pointingly small run of hogs. Packers bought
heavily of lard and ribs. Pork closed 5c lower,
lard gained 2%(&5c and ribs rose sc.

The Steamer Scandia, With Supplies
and a Million Dollars, Goes to
Manila Without Any
Troops.
"Xo further shipment of troops to
Honolulu will be made until General Mer
riam returns and reports on campsites."
Such was the telegraphic order from
Adjutant General Corbin, received yester
day at military headquarters. As Gen
eral Merritt has cabled that he needs no
more troops, and as General Merriam,
whcr is to be absent at least one month,
Wtll in all probabalHty make an unfavor
. aWe 1 report upon the probability of se
curing a suitable camp at Honolulu, it is
si.fe to say that the forces now here will
never- get any further toward the Philip
pines- that the Presidio. This will prove
a grea* . disappointment to them, and the!
consequence will bo a general desire to
$â¢â  mustered out. Under the circum
stances it is more than likely that the
mustering out of the volunteers will oc
\ cor at an early day. Among the officers
â¢ &t military headquarters it was the ex
pected that happened this time in the re
vocation of the Honolulu orders, as the
' announcement that nearly. 10,000 soldiers
w'erc-to be landed at the islands was re
' garded as a useless move, and now some
dcr.hot hesitate to say that it was an in
temional bluff "to jolly the boys along."
â¢ l.ri. .fact, the revocation was looked for
.almost any day by some of the wiser
'heads, 1 and to them it was not much of a
surprise.
. "The .Scandia should leave with sup
piles â as soon as possible, and not take
tiny troops. She will be used as a hos
pital ship, if needed, after reaching Ma
ritla. Inform Colonel Long."
: The foregoing is the text of another
dispatch from Ueneral Corbin. and to gain
more definite information about the Scan
dltt, the Arizona and other transports.
Colonel. Long wired the War Department
at Once, receiving in reply the follow
ing:
â¢"The Question about the Peking has
' been referred to the President. Annul
ih'e charter of the Navy Department, and
ft later on you see fit to hire her you
may do so. You are authorized to cancel
the charters of thx- Australia and the Syd
ney, .and discharge the vessels. You are
requested to have a board of survey or
dered to act in concert with a board
nominated by the owners of the vessels
apd .determine the amount of damagre. if i
â  any.- that has been sustained by the ves
sew. It has been decided that no more
â  vessels .shall be sent to Honolulu, and
: tHerefore-. they are not needed. The
Seandia will be sent to Manila with sup-
J'lirs."
â¢N'-ihing is said concerning the Arizona,
â which- will fie tied up at Honolulu until
further orders.
'.â "the two and a half companies of the
First New York remaining at the Presidio,
an J -.which were scheduled to sail on the

SEVENTH CALIFORNIA.
Now Located at the Presidio.
. Denial That It Has an Epi
demic of Typhoid.
: The Seventh California Regiment moved
â¢over to the Presidio yesterday morning
â  and went into camp to the west Â«of the
First New York upon the cavalry parade
ground. The report of an epidemic of ty
ph.oid fever In the regiment is denied by
t'olonel Berry and his medical officers.
. Captain Roblee, one of the surgeons, said
': yesterday: "There is no epidemic of fever
and. the general health is good. The facts
. nTf that Companies I and H, when we
. -.went into camp upon the site formerly
i.rocupied by the North Dakota, were so
â¢â¢unfoYtunate as to locate over some gar
bage sinks, not known to us at the time.
Several cases of fever developed among
'the. men of tnese companies, and the fe
v.?r was entirely confined to them. Only
â  fourteen cases in the whole regiment
were' sent to the division hospital. Some
of- these are now convalescing, while
-Others have the disease in a mild form.
This fever was caused entirely by the
local trouble, and it was deemed best, as
t.he regiment was not to be immediately
sent away, that it should be moved. The
.fpy^er would have appeared under like
circumstances in any regiment, and it is
...not an f'i>idemlc."
. Colonel Berry confirms Captain Rob-
Je.e's statement by Raying that the fever
is not an epidemic, but the result of local
trouble, and he further states that his
â command is fit and ready for service.
COL. BARBER'S DAMPENER.
A Story to the Effect That His
Adverse Letter on Camp
Sites Played the Mischief.
The men at the Prufdlo are thoroughly
disgusted and especially so are the sol
fliers of the long, ill-treated Seventh Cali
fornia In finally being turned down. The
â¢ disappointment of again being ordered to
remain here in especially hard on this
regiment, and it would appear that it is
â¢destined to see all of it* service In San
Francisco. There is a story back of the
order for the sending of no more troops
to the Philippines that Is worth telling,
an it again brings forward the long
talked of and much discussed pull of Colo
nel Barber, of the First New V<irk Regi
ment. The facts as given out by a prom
inent officer at the Presidio show that the
aforesaid pull of Colonel Barber is respon
sible for the temporary delay in getting
the troops away.
General Alerriam was in receipt of a let
ter from Colonel Barber after he reached
Honolulu, in which that officer expatiated
"at some length upon the difficulty he had
experienced in finding a suitable site for'
a camp. It la said that Colonel Barber
was somewhat embittered because he was
unable to secure a particularly choice sit
uation. Whether true or not, he threw
such a damper upon available camping
sites, in hie letter to General Mtrriam,
that that officer deemed it best to leave
â¢at once for Honolulu to look into the
matter himself. This explains the gen
eral's sudden departure. The contents of
HAD A FRUIT BOX FOR A CRADLE.
A Dark-Eyed Little Foundling Left on Arthur
Tucker's Front Doorstep.
There is a new resident In Emeryville. She came In so mysterious and
unusual a* manner that the whole little town is excited over her advent and
frankly curious to know all about her.
Her name is Alice, and her age is doubtful, although experts declare
she cannot be over two days old. Her only possessions are a quantity
of coarse clothing, a tiny bit of pink ribbon, a card on which is written
in deformed characters, "Alice. August 24th," and a fruitbox, which did
duty for the little newcomer's cradle.
Early Wednesday morning Arthur G. Tucker found the little one on the
front doorstep of his residence on Summer street, near Adelaide, snugly en
sconced in a small fruitbox. Out of a quantity of 'coarse, ill-fitting gar
ments rose a tiny little face, with round cheeks, smooth and soft as
the petals of a rosebud. A "pair of glorious dark eyes, smiled confidingly
up at the man who gazed in speechless wonder at the little stranger,
two little chubby fists were spread out and two tiny '"tootsie wootsies"
kicked with delight at the pleasure of being, and the enjoyment of a
matutinal meal supplied by means of a nursing bottle, filled with the
nectar babies love.
Fastened with a bit of faded pink ribbon round the little one's neck
was a piece of paper with ragged edge, on which was written "AliceâAu
gust 24th."
Although the dark beauty of the little foundling leads one to believe
that little Alice Is of Spanish extraction, the characteristics of the writ
ten name are decidedly German. At the Home of Love for Children, 1301
Franklin street, little Alice has found a temporary home, where she
kicks and coos to her heart's content, all unmindful of a mother's love
and father's protection.
Colonel Barber's letter were communicat
ed to the War Department, and there is
but little or no doubt that it is responsible
for the orders issued by Secretary Alger.
The officer referred to above, in discuss
ing the matter yesterday, said: Ihe
idea of there not being suitable camping
sites in Honolulu for 5000 troops is ab
surd. They could certainly be no worse
than Camp Merritt. The people of Hono
lulu could easily find campfng sites if
they knew the troops would be sent.
ACCURACY OF GUNNERS.
A Test With the Ten- Inch Guns
at Fort Point Yesterday
Afternoon.
The accuracy of American gunners, to
gether with the irresistible destructive
force of the modern high power gun, was
never better illustrated than In the test
ing of the three big 10-inch guns at Fort
Point yesterday. The guns were fired by
Battery E. Third Artillery, under com
mand of Captain Pratt. This battery,
a disappearing one. was fired for the pur
pose of testlng\ie carriages recently ad
justed by Captain Babbitt of the Ord
nance Department. The weight of the
shells was 575 pounds each, and the
charge of powder to each was 280 pounds
The velocity was 2025 feet per second, and
the range was at a target off Point Bo
nita a distance of 4630 yards, or over
three miles. Both the first an<3 second
shots were liners and would have struck
a vessel, the first 20 feet above the water
line and the second 15 feet above. The
third fell ten yards short, but would
have struck on a ricochet. The test was
eminently satisfactory to the artillery' of
ficers. It was witnessed by the soldiers
of the Sixth California Regiment and the
First Battalion of the First Washington,
and a large number of officers. The
noise caused by the shells in the course
through the air was deafening. When
they hit the water they threw the spray
into the air to the height of a hundred
feet and then made a ricochet a distance
of 1500 feet beyond, where they first
struck.
DISTINGUISHED VISITORS.
Senator Faulkner and Repre
sentatives Moody and Loud
at the Presidio.
The Joint United States Senate and
House Committee on Post and Post
Roads, consisting of Senator Charles J.
Faulkner of West Virginia and Represen
tatives W. H. Moody of Massachusetts
and Eugene F. Loud of California, accom
panied by Postal Inspector Erwin, paid
an informal visit to the Presidio yester
day morning. The distinguished guests
were met by General Miller and staff.
They witnessed guard mount, and in their
honor the Fourth Cavalry band was
mounted. At the conclusion of this cere
mony a salute of 17 guns was fired by a
detail from Battery E of the Third Artil
lery, under command of First Lieutenant
McNair. The committee was then escort
ed by General Miller and staff to Fort
Point, where they were shown the harbor
defenses and the working of. the big guns.
They were accompanied by Colonel Whol
ley of the First Washington and First
Lieutenant Harris, adjutant of the Fourth
Cavalry. After Fort Point had been vis
ited the Congressmen thanked the officers
for their courtesies and continued their
day's pleasure by a visit to the Cliff
House.
War Incidents.
The court martial appointed for the trial
of the soldiers, against whom charges
were preferred for being implicated in the
attack upon the negro, Dan Thomas, was
in session for a short time yesterday
morning. Private Scruggs, Company E,
charged with having struck Thomas on
the head while being escorted to the Ten
nesset camp by Major Cheatham, was be
fore the court. It was found necessary to
make some technical revisions in the
charges against him. This was done and
the court adjourned. It will be in session
again to-day.
Post Quartermaster Sergeant Neisser,
with a detail from the Fourth Cavalry,
left the Presidio yesterday with forty
eight horses assigned to Troop A of the
same regiment now stationed at Fort
Walla Walla.
The remaining battalion of the Twenty
third Infantry and the Oregon recruits
will move from Camp Merritt to the Pre
sidio this morning. This winds up Camp
Merritt.
SEVERE ACCIDENT
TO DR. FITZGIBBON
THE RESULT OF A RUNAWAY
ON WALLER STREET.
His Wrist Broken and Body Badly
Bruised â Driver King Also
Slightly Injured.
A severe accident befell Dr. Gerald J.
Fitzgibbon of the Board of Health yes
terday morning while driving down Wal
ler street. His right wrist was broken,
and he sustaned several bad bruises. His
carriage driver, Frank King, was also
cut on the head and bruised.
The doctor had been called to the home
of Undertaker H. B. McAvoy, at the
corner of Broderick and Waller streets,
to attend a little daughter of Mr. Mc-
Avoy, who had dislocated her arm. l T pon
leaving the house he directed King to
drive him to his office, 204 Haight street.
While coming down the Waller street
hill the harness broke and the dash
board of the carriage struck one of the
team of horses, both of them spirited an
imals. A runaway resulted. At the
Scott street crossing the vehicle struck
sideways against a rock wagon which
was being unloaded, and was thrown on
its side, pitching out the doctor and his
driver. The former struck on his right
arm and head, snapping the wrist, and
fanning bad cuts. He was dazed by the
shock, and for some time afterward
seemed to be suffering from internal in
juries, but finally recovered to such an
extent that Dr. Ragan, who attended the
sufferer, pronounced him out of danger.
It was not thought necessary to take the
injured doctor to a hospital, and he was
carried to his home.
King was at first conveyed to the Ger
man Hospital and later to the home of
hfs employer. He will be confined to his
bed for several weeks.
It will be some time before Dr. Fitz
gibbon will be able to leave his house.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1898.
WANT CREEGAN AND
BECKER BEHIND BARS
PETITION TO RECONSIDER THE
FORGERY CASE.
Scate Officials and Bankers of the
World Fight to Prevent a Retrial
of These Criminals.
Attorney General W. F. Fitzgerald
backed by the local police and all of the
bankers of the United States and Europe,
is malting an effort to have the notorious
Beeker-Creegan forgery case reheard by
the Justices of the Supreme Court. These
fellows are a portion of the gang of
forgers who two years ago victimized the
Nevada Bank to the tune of $22,000 on a
forged check. The evidence upon which
these two were convicted and upon which
they were sentenced to life imprisonment
by Superior Judge Wallace was about
as strong as could be produced. How
ever, the microscopic eye of the law dis
covered a technical error or two and the
results of months of detective work was
upset by the cases being sent back to the
Superior Court for another trial, which
would create other complications that
mighl end in acquittal.
As shown by the appeal to the Supreme
Justices for a rehearing of the case, the
bankers of the entire world are deeply in
terested in having the chief forger, Beck
er, behind iron bars and out of harnVs
way, for during the past dozen or more
years he and his gang have swindled
bankers on forged paper in every large
city of the United States and Europe. A
few years ago the gang visited Paris,
Prague, Berlin, London and other big Eu
ropean cities and they cleaned up about
J2DU.OOO as the result of that one trip. Six
years ago the same fellows came to this
city and' fleeced the bankers out of a
iartje amount, the Nevada Bank being one
of the victims. It was the intention then
to make a raid on the Heliman bank in
Los Angeles, but somehow there was a
slip and the forgers went East. When
they were arrested for the last crime
they were preparing to go to South Am
erican cities and make a clean-up there.
The bankers, knowing that so long as
Becker is at liberty they are never safe,
were extremely anxious when the judg
ment of Judjge Wallace was reversed and
the forgers placed in a position to get a
new trial, and possibly secure their free
dom through other loopholes of the law.
In the petition for a rehearing of the mat
ter the situation Is thus distinctly set
forth: "We most earnestly urge that
the court recede from its present posi
tion anci give us an opportunity to show
why in the interests of substantial jus
tice, and of law and order, the judgment
against these defendants should be affirm
ed. Whenever these technical rules of
evidence become so rigidly inflexible that
they cannot bend to meet the exigencies
of those cases where shrewd and danger
ous criminals deliberately plan their op
erations with a view to rely upon such
technicalities, then the law itself will be
an accomplice in crime, and we will have
lost the most cherished feature of our
system of jurisprudence."
WOODMEN TAKE AN
OUTING ON THE WATER
PLEASANT EXCURSION ON SAN
FRANCIS. CO BAY.
Strangers Shown the Grandeur of the
Harbor and Points of Interest
on the City Front.
The head officers and delegates to the
camp of the Pacific jurisdiction of the
Woodmen of the World were the guests
of the reception committee of the local â 
camps yesterday, and they enjoyed the
hospitality of the committee in the nature i
of an excursion on the bay on board of ,
the steamer Caroline, Captain Leale. In
addition to the officers and delegates
there were a large number of ladles,
many of them delegates to the Grand
Circle of the Women of Woodcraft.
There were about 200 persons on board,
and the trip was enlivened by music by
a brass band. The steamer cast off at 10
o'clock and steamed from Pacific-street
wharf along the front to Port Point, giv
ing the excursionists a good opportunity
to view all points of interest. Then the
steamer was headed for Sausallto, after
which the excursionists were taken
through Raccoon Straits to within a rea
sonable distance of the quarantine sta
tion on Angel Island, where they had an
opportunity to obtain a distant view of
Beveral hundred passengers from China
who are quarantined there. Then they
were taken along the line of the eastern
Bhore of Marin County as far as San
Quentin, the steamer going close to the
landing place, from which point all had
an opportunity to see the State prison and
surroundings.
At noon the steamer slowed down and
the guests were treated to a fine collation.
Then a course southward was taken, the
steamer on the way down circling round
the United States ship Bennington, the
excursionists cheering the men on the war
vessel. After that they were taken to the
drydock at Hunters Point, where they
were allowed to land and view the dock,
a great curiosity to many of the delegates.
They were also taken close to the Union
Iron Works, where they had an opportu
nity to see the torpedo-destroyer Farra
gut and a number of vessels on the Vays
undergoing repairs.
Members of the local camps and the
committee were kept buÃy explaining all
points of Interest which could be seen
from the deck of the steamer. The ex
cursion was a most pleasant one, and the
strangers were loud In their praises of
the committeemen who had provided such
an interesting day's outing for them. They
were also praiseful of the beauty of the
bay and the surroundings.
In the evening there was an exemplifi
cation of the work of the woodcraft be
fore the delegates in Odd Fellows' Hall
by a team in costume.

Butchers Make Merry.
The Journeymen Butchers' Protective
and Benevolent Association entertained
their lady friends last night at Pythian
Castle Hall, and it was a well-attended
affair. An interesting programme was
presented which was opened by the Lur
line Orchestra. Past President S. Isaacs
made a few introductory' remarks, during
which he paid a high tribute to the retir
ing treasurer, John O'Keefe, who has held
the office for four years, at the same time
presenting to that gentleman a beautiful
badge suitably inscribed as a testimonial
of respect. Songs were contributed by
Messrs. Palmer, and Ben Davis, Misses
Kelly and Cora Davis. The rest of the
programme was as follows: Violin duet,
Messrs. Gutte and Smith; graphophone

WAS NOT POISONED.
The Death of Mrs. H. L. Foss Was
Not Due to Morphine.
The friends and relatives of the late
Mrs. H. L. Foss, who died on Sunday last
at the City and County Hospital, are
much incensed at the story of her death
that was published in the Examiner. That
journal in a sensational way stated that
her death was due to morphine poisoning,
taken with suicidal intent. Dr. T. B.
Roache. who attended the deceased, in a

TRADES' DEMONSTRATION IS TO
OPEN THE AFFAIR.
After the War Is Settled Oakland
Intends to Take the Lead
in Fostering Home
Progress.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 21.
The directors of the Oakland Exposi
tion, to be opened In this city November
12, at their last meeting announced that
the annual exhibition should be a State
affair. They decided that Oakland should
be the first in the field to take up the
question of booming commerce and prod
ucts after the close of the war. An exe
cutive committee was appointed, consist
ing of Theo Gier, H. O. Trowbridge,
George Roeth, John T. Bell and C. S.
Booth.
It is proposed that the first day of the
exposition be characterized by a mam
moth trades parade, and to invite all the
commercial bodies of the State to par
ticipate in the exhibits.
The following circular has been mailed
to every commercial organization in Cali
fornia:
OAKLAND, August 23, 1898.
Gentlemen: At a recent meeting of the Board
of. Directors of the Oakland Exposition a reso
lution was adopted to hold an Industrial exhi
bition, beginning November 12 and ending De
cember 3. 1898, which will be open to the
manufacturers and producers of the State of
California. This action has been recommended
by the manufacturer* and merchants of Oak
land, who have the interest of their city and
State at heart, and the feeling le unanimous
regarding the broadening of the scope of their
fourth annual industrial exhibition. The pre
vious expositions held in Oakland limited the
exhibits to the manufactures and products of
Alameda County only, and owing to the fact
that Oakland was the pioneer in America of
the holding of a successful home products ex
position, the directors, desirous of being pro
gressive in developing the interests of their
city, have decided to invite the manufacturers
and producers throughout the State to ex
hibit, and it is the wish of the directors that
your association lend its auspices and good
will in assisting them to make this exposition
a great success, as Its alms and ambitions
are In accord with your own.
We would consider It a great favor If you
will bring this matter before your association
at your earliest convenience and favor us with
your decision.
SHE WAS NOT
A LONE WIDOW
A Boy and an Estate in
the Mattingly Case.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 24.
A husband who was not known to ex
ist and a lady who piesides over a chil
dren's home in Alameda are contesting
before Judge Ellsworth for the guardian
ship of a boy and the administration of
an- estate.
Some months ago Mrs. Eliza Mattlngly,
who was always supposed to be a widow,
and who lived with her boy in North
Oakland, was found dead In her kitchen.
When the lad went to school in the morn
ing his mother was quite well, and when
he returned at 3 o'clock in the afternoon
she was dead. An autopsy and medical
testimony proved that she died of a rup
tured heart. This condition was said by
the physicians to be due to a sudden !
laugh, a violent cough, or even a heavy ;
sneeze, and on this showing the jury re
turned their verdict.
It has since been ascertained that Mrs.
Mattingly was not a widow, but a di
vorced woman, and it is probable that on
the day of her death she received some
information of her husband that led to
the peculiar accident that caused death.
The boy is 11 years old and was placed
after his mother's death in a home in
Alameda. Miss M. L. Jones applied for
and was granted letters of guardianship
over the boy. A little later she also sued
for letters of administration to take
charge of the estate left by Mrs. Mat
tingly. The latter application is now be- \
Ing contested by the Public Administra- ,
tor, and to the surprise of all concerned '
a Mr. Mattingly. who declares he is the
divorced husband of the dead woman
and the father of the boy. has come for
ward with a counter petition for letters
of guardianship. He declares that he is
anxious to bring up the boy and Is in a
position to do so. and has ~een cited to
appear and present his case in court.
Miss Jones has been summoned to show
cause why the boy's father should not
become his guardian.
EDWARD LAWREY
HAS TWO NAMES
Served With a Divorce
Suit in Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 24.
Mary 8. Lawrey has broagrht suit for
divorce from Edward C. l.avrey, the
author of the song which has rrequently
brought forth applause in San Francisco
theatersâ "Boys, Remember the Maine."
The couple have not been married many
years, but the wife alleges that there is
a sad lack of patriotic feeltng on the part
of her husband, as shown by his treat
ment of his wife. A peculiar Incident in
connection with the suit was discovered
when papers were served on Lawrey. He
has two names, and when he gets into
trouble he appears as J. Yarevell. Under
the latter name he is now serving a short
sentence for drunkenness in the County*
Jail and his identity would not have
been discovered had not his wife brought
suit for divorce just at the time when it
was so easy to find her husband.
When told of the action to which he is
defendant this afternoon Lawrey cried
like a child. "It is all due to drink,
drink, drink." said he. "My wife has
charged me with attempting to choke her
and with throwing her against the furni
ture and similar acts ot cruelty, and I
guess they are all true. I have been ren
dered so unnatural by drink that I do
n6t know what I might have done. I
have not supported her, although some
time ago, realizing I was not doing right,
I deeded to her a good gravel mine in
Auburn City."

THE OREGON'S
CHAPLAIN IS
IN TROUBLE
Unpleasant Episodes
in the East.
AN UNFORTUNATE LECTURE
A COUBT-MARTIAL MAY BE
THE RESULT.
Chaplain Mclntyre Is Now In San
Francisco Waiting to Hear
From the Navy Depart
ment.
The chaplain of the battleship Oregon. I
Rev. Joseph P. Mclntyre, arrived in San j
Fram-isco Saturday evening to obtain a i
rest from recent troublous incidents as
well as to visit bis foii, who is attend
ing school in this city.
Chaplain Mclntyre. who is receiving a
cordial reception at the hands of his
Methodist brethren, Balled from San
Francisco on the Oregon on her memor
able voyage around the Horn to Santiago,
and was a witness of and participant in i
the great naval battle that resulted in )
the annihilation of Cervera's fleet, and It ,
Is his proud boast that he can relate a
story the most thrilling, he thinks, that
any man living has to tell.
He told it in Denver, and thereby de- I
pends a narrative of woe. Leading up
to his debut as a lecturer in the Queen
City of the Plains, there occurred some I
unpleasant incidents in New York and
Chicago which for a time made life a
burden to him.
"Landing from the hospital ship in New
York, the first thing he encountered was
a herd of yellow newspaper reporters. He
was so Indiscreet as to talk to them. He
â¢ gave them a temperate and frank inter
view. The next morning, upon reading
their scare headlines, misstatements and
exaggerations, he was suddenly attacked
with chills. Hurrying on to Chicago, in
the hope of recovery, he there met with
a somewhat similar experience, the yel
low reporter of the Windy City throwing
him into a feverâ a sort of yellow fever.
Immediately the unfortunate chaplain
began receiving telegrams and letters
from friends and Government ofti.clais
warning him not to get into trouble. It
â¢ was evident that his friends were con
siderably exercised over the twisted news
paper reports of what he had said. How
ever, Chaplain Mclntyre rallied sufficient
ly to pacK. his grip and proceed to Den
ver, hoping never again to run foul of
a yellow newspaper reporter. He deter
mined to keep under cover until he fully
recovered from the chills and fever, but
alas! he was soon discovered. The chap
lain, however, remembering his experi
ences in New York and Chicago, was
careful to express himself to the report
ers that he was not disposed to talk.
So far, so good.
While he was recuperating, the Young
Men's Christian Association, In which he
has taken a deep interest for many years,
reiated to him a tale of woe in regard
to its inability to pay a debt of J750 for
back rent. It was suggested that a lec
ture by him on the naval battle of San
tiago would materially assist in lilting
the association's burden of debt. Although
Chaplain Mclntyre bad intended going to
Glenwood Springs to take a series of
baths at that health resort, he finally con
cluded to remain in Denver and give the
Young Men's Christian Association a kind
ly litt. He accordingly told in a lecture
the story- of "The Oregonâ Her Voyage
and her Victories" to an audience of
about 400 persons.
Next morning Chaplain Mclntyre. upon
reading the Daily News report of his
lecture, was simply astounded and then
paralyzed for a time at what he claims
was a monstrous mass of malicious men
' dai-ity. In his state of health it was a
severe blow, worse than any he had yet
received, and the wonder is that it did '
not cause either nervous prostration or ;
cerebio-spinai meningitis.
But what followed is best told in the !
words of Chaplain Mclntyre to a party
01 friends a day or two alter his arrival
In San Fmncisco. "It so happened that -
there is a yellow journal in Denver, called i
the Rocky Mountain News," said he, !
"and on its staff there is a woman who i
is a politician. You know women vote in \
Colorado. My brother about a year and
a half ago, in concluding his term of !
service in Denver, had preached a ser- I
mon on "Christian Womanhood,' which, I
it seems, displeased this woman. She de- j
â¢ nounced my brother for his unchristian '
characterizations. This same woman,
â sviih'-er animosity against the Mclntyre
family, was detailed to report my lecture.
The next morning there was published a
most outrageous report, the substance of
which was telegraphed to all the leading
papers of the country by the Associated
Press agent. I was charged with having
claimed in my talk everything for the
battle-ship Oregon; that I had denounced
'Fighting Bob' Evans as a skulking cow
ard; that I had declared the lowa a fail
ure as a fighter and as a piece of mechan
ism. There were other statements quite
a.Â« false. The matter naturally came to
the attention of the Navy Department,
from which I received an official com
â  munication. making inquiry as to the af
fair. Two of the four papers in Denver
defended me, saying that the attack was
infamous and the worst specimen of
journalis-tic mendacity ever known. The
Young Men's Christian Association gave
me a strong paper of indorsement, which
I forwarded to Washington, together
with my personal explanation. Upon
leaving Denver I left directions to a
friend to open any official communica
tions that mitint come for me and tele
graph me the fact. I have just received
this telegram: 'Sent forward letter last
night Jind another to-day. Important.
See no one and do not talk any more on
this subject.'
I am, therefore, placed in a delicate
position and must be excused from talk
ing any more about this matter at pres
ent. Later, provided the communl'-a
tions do not interfere, 1 shall be glad to
'tell the thrilling story of the Oregon."
To say that Chaplain Mclntyre's lecture,
as it was reported, has caused a great
commotion in Denver, as well as in naval
circles, half expresses it. It is understood
in Washington, says a recent dispatch,
that st'-j)s looking toward the court-mar
tialing of the chaplain for his alleged crit
icism? Of naval officers and shipbuilders
have been taken, as such criticisms are
prohibited by the n;ivn! regulations. Hero
is what he is said to have charged against
Sampson in his lecture:
"And Sampson wrote a report of the
battle and reported himself within four
miles of the Cristobal Colon when she
pulled down her flag. He did that to get
hIH share of the prize money, for a ship
must be within four miles to share in
the prize money. So Sampson will get
$10,000 of prize money, and Captain Clark,
who fought the Oregon as man never
fought ship before, will get only $500; and
you. who have just exactly as much to do
with the battle as Sampson had, will not
get a cent."
The shots alleged to have been fired by
the lecturer at Captain Evans of the
lowa, and at Eastern shipbuilders, wore
equally red-hot. The chaplain vigorously
denied ever having made any such state
ments, but, on the other hand, several
persons among his nudience came out in
published cards substantially corroborat
ing the newspaper report of his lecture
and scoring him unmercifully.
chaplain Mclntyre is anxiously await
ing the arrival of those two important
ofllrlnl communications from Washington
via Denver. Meantime he Is heeding that
telegraphic injunction from his home not
to talk any more at present about this un
fortunate episode.

NO MONEY
FOR CITY
EMPLOYES
August Salaries Will
Soon Be Due.
GENERAL FUND EXHAUSTED
COMBINATION OF EMPLOYES TO
SEEK ASSISTANCE.
Some Local Bank Will Be Asked to
Carry the Salary Warrants
Until Next No
vember.
The August pay day for city employes
I is now fast approaching and there is no
I money In sight for many of them. The
general fund is exhausted, and more than
1500 men are wondering as to where the
cash is coming from to pay house rent
and grocers' bills.
I'nder Sheriff Clack, speaking of the
matter yesterday, said: "We are up
against it this year, the same as we were
two years ago. The only thing to be
i done by the city employes is to combine
! and get one of the banks in San Fran
! Cisco to carry them financially until No
vember. This, of course, means a loss
to the employes, as no bank will cash
warrants for less than 1 per cent a
month. That means 2or 3 per cent for
the time that the bank will have to wait
on the city for its money. The percent
j age, or interest, comes out of our pock
ets It seems pretty tough that sal
aried men. working for the city, should
be held up in this way every year or
two There is never sufficient money to
carry the city through from one fiscal
year to another.
" "Two years ago the Bank of California
carried the men, for 1 per cent a month.
At that time a combination of employes
was made at the suggestion of the Sher
i iff's office. This time 1 suppose that we
I will take the Initiative. Of course we
will have to find a bank that will be
willing to do this for us. Steps will
probably be taken by the heads of the
various departments affected without
longer delay. There are very few of the
I city employes who can afford to hold
their warrants until more money comes
| into the general fund in the middle of
I November."
It is understood that Sheriff "Whelan
| will canvass the local banks to-day in be
half of his office force, to find one that
will carry the warrants. An arrange
ment with the other departments will
! follow. _____^____^
MUELLER WAS UNFAITHFUL.
Henrietta Seeba Sues Him for Dam
ages for Failing to Marry Her.
Henrietta Seeba declares that Sebastian
Mueller is an unfaithful lover. She ap
peals to the Justices' court to even up
matters by giving her $2f*9 as satisfaction.
Miss Seeba states that she has been a
domestic and that prior to March 1, 1898,
she was earning $20 a month and board.
Then Sebastian came along. He was a
young man of pleasing address and sym
pathetic heart. He loveu Henrietta and
did not want her to work fo hard. As a
result of his protestations of love and his
; scorn for hard work she gave up her po
i sitlon and with it her $20 salary and lodg
ing and went to boarding at an expense
i of $5 a week, waiting for the wedding day.
1 On July 21 Sebastian told Henrietta that
' he did not love her any more and that
i the engagement was off. The board bill
and the wages lost aggregate $299. Hence
she sues to recover.
Drank Poison by Mistake.
Walter Dray, a 13-year-old boy work
ing for a photographer at 230 Suttc-r street,
was accidentally poisoned last night. He
had been out on an errand, and on his
return saw what he thought was a glass
of water and drank it. The glass con
tained a solution of nitrate of silver. The
boy was hurried to the Harbor Receiving
Hospital and treated. He will probably
recover.

ERNEST NARJOT, the Oldest California Painter,
Who Died Yesterday.
There passed away yesterday In this city an art veteran whose lame
is familiar to all and whose work has been widely commended.
Ernest Narjot, the oldent painter in California, was born in St. Malo,
France, in 1527, and began his art education at a very early age, attend
ing a Parisian school before he was 16. He arrived in this city exactly
forty-five years ago, but after a year of spasmodic work with his brush
he joined an expedition to Mexico, returning to San Francisco in 1356.
Afterward he devoted himself to his art, and his pictures are well known.
He did a great deal of fresco work for churches and public institutions
both in California and Mexico. Narjot was later afflicted with paralysis
and partial blindness.
Narjot passed away at the home of his daughter and son-in-law, Mr.
and Mr?. Howard. He leaves a widow, two daughters and a son to
mourn his loss.
The funeral services will do held to-morrow at Notre Dame de Vlc

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1898.
TWO KNOCKOUTS
AT WOODWARD'S
Dud Evans No Match for
Fred Muller.
HE WAo A GAME FIGHTER
KID McFADDEN WHIPPED BUD
TERRY IN TEN ROUNDS.
Henry Slater Was Afraid of Young
Peter Jackson and Feigned a
Knockout to Escape
Punishment.
Manager Groom of the National Ath
letic Club felt pardonably proud last
evening when he surveyed the large
crowd of sport lovers who witnessed the
"mills" in Woodward's Pavilion between
locul boxers.
As per announcement the card was car
ried out to the letter, and the spectators
had the good fortune of leaving for their
respective homes at an early hour.
The contests were interesting and sat
isfactory, excepting the bout between
Young Peter Jackson and the faker,
Henry Slater, who took advantage of a
sharp rally in the second round and
dropped to the floor with his arms encir
cled in such a manner as to protect his
sweet face from hard contact with the
carpet. He feigned a knockout, but it
was so crude an impersonation that his
opponent, Young Peter Jackson, skipped
in disgust from his corner with the speed
of a startled cottontail rabbit and made
his escape to his dressing room unmo
lested. The referee should have certainly
declared all bets otf in the Interest of
"square" sport.
"rUA" MeFatiden, a natural born fight
er, and Bud Terry put up a rattling good
mill for feather-weights. In the . first
round Terry scored a good lead by
straight left hand jabs which tickled
the nasal appendage of the "Kid," whose
only effective blows were right-handers
delivered over the heart. In the second
round McFadden's right brought forth
a red patch under Terry's left arm, but
the rib-roaster got a good return on th&
face for every blow he landed on the
body.
In the third round the "Kid" changed
his tactics, and punished his opponent
severely with upper-cuts, causing more
or less â¢'ciaret" to flow from Terry's
nose and mouth. The fourth round was
evenly contested. The fifth was the hot
test of the bunch. Bud staggered the
"Kid" in the early momenta of the
round, but as the battle progressed both
swung their rights with the intention of
scoring a knockout, and Terry was first
to land. The blow sent McFadden to his
knees, but he was up and fighting be
fore the round ended. The remainder of
the rounds, up to the tenth were closely
contested, until McFadden in a rally
caught his opponent a short-arm right
hand punch under the chin, which sent
Terry reclining against the ropes, from
which position he fell forward on his
face. He remained on the carpet until
counted out.
Dud Evans of Portland and Fred Muller
were the last brace on deck. The heavy
lunged master of ceremonies announced
that the pugilists would box twenty
rounds, but the end came in the eighth.
Evans carries a luntern-jaw. which imme
diately caught the eye of his opponent,
who made several vain attempts to con
nect with the vulnerable point, but missed
many excellent openings.
In the eighth round Muller jabbed Evans
hard with the left, and a short-arm right
which followed immediately accomplished
the trick for the local boxer, who planted
the glove on the jaw point, and as a re
sult Mr. Evans fell into peaceful slumber
for fifteen or twenty seconds.
Muller carries as a memento of the en
gagement a beautifully blackened eye,
which gift of Evans' prowess he received
in the early rounds. Altogether, the en
tertainment gave first-class satisfaction,
considering the prices of admission.
WILL RACE FOR SILVER CUPS
Handsome Trophies for the Pacific
Interclub Yacht Association's
Regatta,
At a meeting of the Pacific Interclub
Yacht Association held yesterday at the
Merchants' Exchange the following were
present: Commodore J. S. Hanley and H.
M. L,andsberger, delegates from the En
cinal Yacht Club; E. N. Walter and R. R.
l'Hommedleu, delegates from the Califor
nia Yacht Club; J. H. Hopps, P. J. Mar
tinstein and A. J. Young, delegates from
the Corinthian Yacht Club; L. A. Haven
and A. D. Naylor, delegates from the San
Francisco Yacht Club.
A telegram from J. M. Macdonough was
read, authorizing the secretary of the as
sociation to order a silver cup to be raced
for at the association regatta on Septem
ber 9, and to be known as the Macdon
ough cup. The "Law cup" and the "Dele
gates' cup" will also be offered by the as
sociation at the regatta. A representa
tive of a firm of jewelers was in attend
ance with designs for the delegates' cup.
one of which was selected. To the second
yacht in each class a suitably inscribed
mug will be presented as a prize.
A suggestion that a referee be appointed
for the Admission day regatta was not
cordially received, the utility of that of
ficial being not very apparent. The man
agement of the regatta is to be left wholly
in the hands of the regatta committee.
Several amendments to the rules govern
ing yacht-racing were suggested, the
greatest discussion being provoked by the
proposed abolition of time-allowance and
the definition of a professional. It is de
sired to abolish the necessity for time-al
low.inre by encouraging the building of
yachts up to the limits of their classes.
A GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST.
PROFESSOR WILLIAM JAMES of Harvard
Arrives.
BERKELEY, Aug. 24.â Professor
William James of' Harvard Univer
sity, a brother of Henry James, the
novelist, arrived here from the
East to-day.
Professor James is one of the
recognized leaders of American
psychologists, and a. pnilosopher of
International fame. His publica
tions are well known both in this
country and in Europe. They all
have the merit, by no means com
mon to treatises of philosophy, of
being written in brilliant, entertain
ing style. His latest, "The Will to
Believe," is a popular exposition
of the position of a radical empiri
cist, and has served as the basis of
discussion for the Philosophical
Union of the University of Califor
nia for the past year. It is at the
invitation of the latter society that
Professor James comes to the Pa
cific Coast. He will deliver the
annual public lecture at the univer
sity, under the auspices of the
Philosophical Union, next Friday
evening. August 26. Admission is
open. to the public. The subject will
be "Philosophy Tested by Prac
tice."
PRODUCES THE
MARRIAGE CONTRACT
MRS. QUACKENBUSH ON THE
WITNESS STAND.
States That C. J. Noyes Was the
Father of Her First Child â Sur
prising Developments
Expected.
Some little surprises developed yester
day in the trial -f the action of Mrs. Car
lotta Quackenbush against Esther
SwortHguc-r to recover a portion of the
estate of the dead capitalist, Thomas M.
Quackenbush. Mrs. Quackenbush, if ,
such name the court holds she is enti
tled to, was on the stand and told the '
story of her marriage to Quackenbush in
December of 1566. The alleged contract ,
that made them husband and wife, ac- j
cording to the contention of the plaintiff,
Â«ai produced. It is dim from age, but ;
with a glass it can be readily deciphered. !
It reads: '
PEC EM HER 10, 1866.
This la to say that we are man and wife In
the eyes of all people.
THOMAS M. QUA.CKENBUSH,
CABLOTTA ORTIS.
The Christian name of the plaintiff is
very dim, and for the purposes of the
trial a correct copy was made and given
Into the custody of the clerk. After the
production of the document, which has
BiK-h a material bearing on the case, Mrs.
Quackenbush continued her testimony.
Bhe stated that her son, who was known
as Charles Quackenbush, was the son of
C. J. Noyes. He was born out of wedlock
and prior to her marriage to Quacken
bush. After her marriage Quackenbush
told her to institute a suit against Noyes
for breach of promise, which she did. but
the suit was finally dismissed by stipula
tion Later another son was born to her
and he died in this city in ISSB. Mrs.
Quackenbush became bewildered at times
at the rigid cross examination of Attor
ney Foote, but in regard to the matn
issue she could not be shaken. The trial
goes on to-day, and all are expecting sur
prising developments.

BOX OF DEADLY BONBONS
PROBABLY FIXED IN STOCKTON
A Suspicious Incident That
Hay Fasten the Crime
on Mrs. Botkin.
THE CANDY CLERK RECALLS A
STRANGE CUSTOMER.
Substituted Confections for Those Originally
in the Package==The Accused Woman
Makes a Statement in the
City Prison.
Reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of Mrs. W. A. Botkin, the
suspected murderess of Mrs. J.
P. Dunning and Mrs. Joshua A.
Deane, will soon vanish if the
statements made by John Gat
trell and W. K. Kuhn of Stock
ton are true and can be sworn
to. Gattrell is the head clerk in
the "Wave candy-store and he
says that about three weeks ago
a woman whose description is
identical with that of the woman
under arrest came into the store
and asked him for a box of bon
bons, saying she wished to put
in with the store candy some of
her own make. The clerk gave
her a plain box, as the rule of
the store is that none but candy
made in the establishment is sold
under the firm's name. The box
of candy was handed to the
woman and she removed a por
tion of it and substituted bon
bons she had in a small sack.
The clerk wrapped the box,
gave it to the woman and she
left the store. He had not seen
her since.
Mrs. Botkin was in Stockton
July 2S, 29 and 30. It was on one
of these days the Incident oc
curred.
W. K. Kuhn, proprietor of the
candy store referred to, says he
and also his clerk can identify
the candy made in his place, and
they can also identify the box.
If the box sent to Dover came
from Kuhn's store and if he iden
tifies the uneaten bonbons as his
manufacture, and then if Gattrell
identifies Mrs. Botkin as the
woman who bought them, she
stands convicted of the most dia
bolical, premeditated and cun
ningly executed murder in the
criminal annals of the century.
While in Stockton last week
the accused woman was ill and
hysterical, and it is rumored that
she uttered many significant
words bearing directly upon the
tragedy while her mind wan
dered.
The police have received an in
timation that a woman recently
bought poison in Stockton. This
is being investigated.
Mrs. Botkin is now in the City
Prison, where she will be de
tained until the arrival of De
tective McVey of Delaware, who
is now on the way here to secure
her extradition. She made a
statement to the Chief of Police,
absolutely denying that she is
guilty of the double murder, and
gave details of her actions since
August 27, on which date she
went to Stockton and remained
two days.
STOCKTON, Aug. 24.â Chief Gall to
day obtained unexpected and impor
tant evidence bearing upon the Dun
ning case. It is not too much to ex
pect that within a few days it will be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt
that Mrs. Botkin prepared the poisoned
bonbons for Mrs. Dunning when she
was here three weeks ago. Mrs. Bot

kin arrived here on the morning of
Thursday, July 28. She went at once
to the home of Mrs. Rauof on Fremont
street. Mrs. Rauof says that Mrs. Bot
kin was in poor health and went out
but little during her brief sojourn here.
Further than this Mrs. Rauof has
nothing to say concerning Mrs. Bot
kin's health or state of mind on tho
occasion of this visit. On the afternoon
of the following Saturday she bade
Mrs. Rauof good-by, saying she was
going to return to San Francisco. Mrs.
Rauof did not accompany Mrs. Botkin
to the train, as the latter said her hus

band was to be at the depot to see her
off and had said he would have her
ticket purchased for her. Mrs. Rauof
is very reticent and will say nothing.
Frank J. Gattrell, a young man of
good reputation, employed at the Wave
candy-store as head clerk, believes he
sold Mrs. Botkin the box and part of
the contents which brought about the
death of Mrs. Dunning and her sister.
Oattrell fixes his dates from thÂ« frict
that he spent the latter portion of July
In San Francisco on a vacation, re
turning here on the last day or there
abouts of the month in order to as
sume his duties in the store at th" be
ginning of the new month. He possibly
arrived two days before the Ist of
August, and as there was a rush at
the store he went behind the counter at
once. On one of the first days after his
return he was at the counter when .i
woman came in who he says "was of
medium age. My recollection is that
she wore a dark dress. She was not a
tall woman, but rather neat and stout.
I cannot give a description now, but
possibly if I met her I might recognize
her. I do not say I can identify her,
but I might."
Continuing his story, Gattrell says
the woman came up to the counter and
asked if she might have a bonbon box.
The clerk replied that it was against
his orders to allow any candy other
than that of the Wave to go out under
the firm label. She then handed him a
sack and told him to put the candy it
contained in a box and fill it out with
his own. Gattrell then went to the
back of the store and got a box on
which was written in script "Bon
Brms." He showed this to her and
asked her if this would answer, and
she said it would. He then emptied the
candy from the bag she brought with
her into the box and filled it in from
the show case. While the clerk was do-
Ing this the woman told him to put in
mostly chocolates. Gattrell says the
candy which she brought with her was
a mixture of what is known as French
bonbons. He is certain that it was
not cheap candy bought on the street.
Gattrell tied the candy up and the
woman left the store.
He says he would have Drobably

never have thought of the Incident
again, but when the poisoning case
came up and he saw the scene shifted
to Stockton he became interested. He
became doubly interested when he saw
the picture of the candy box in the pa
per. When Mrs. Botkin was arrested
last night and he learned of her build
and manner the whole matter flashed
on him and he made haste to lay the
matter before Chief Gall this morning.
W. K. Kuhn, the proprietor of the
Wave, and his clerk both say they can
positively identify the box as to
whether or not it came from their
place.
Young Gattrell comes of a good fam
ily, bears an excellent reputation, is a
High School graduate and the presi
dent of his class.
In his statement to Chief Gall he
said: "I naturally took an interest in
a case where a box of candy figured.
The woman's aft was unusual, but I
probably would never have thought of
it again had not this case come up and
the developments which occurred here.
The case flashed over my mind and
when I found that the accused woman
was right here in the city I felt it my
duty to tell of the Incident. The only
description I can give of the woman
is a general one. She was not tall.
She was dressed in the light summer
wear usually worn by the ladies here.
I can identify the box and possibly the j
woman. Of the latter I will not be j
certain. I am certain of the correct- )
ness of what I have stated to the chief, j
I have made my statement without \
bias or prejudice and if it has an im
portant bearing on the case I am
neither to blame nor entitled to credit ;
for bringing the facts out."
Chief Gall during the afternoon re
ceived a telephone message from Chief j
Lees giving a description of the box
sent to Mrs. Dunning. The description |
agrees with that of Gattrell in the '
main, but a comparison cannot be }
made, as the candy store is not at ;
present in possession of any of the box
stock which was on hand at that time, i
Both Gattrell and Proprietor Kuhn re- j
call, however, that they used plain |
white enameled boxes labeled "Bon
Bons." There were no ribbons on these
boxes, they having been removed.
There were ribbons on the box
which carried the poisoned potion,
but the sender might have put these on
in a position formerly used by the re
moved silk. These boxes did not bear
any advertisement of the "Wave" and
were kept on hand for such persons as
bought candy here and wanted the re
cipient to believe that it came from
San Francisco. To this end it was of
course necessary to eliminate the local
linn's name.
In the store is a stamp which the
boys u.sed in making an American flag
on packages. If there is an impression
of a flag on the box at Dover, the evi
dence of where it came from will be
conclusive. If it ie not, however, it will
be no proof that young Gattrell is mis
taken, as he says the rule of stamping
the Mag was not invariable and this
box might not have contained the flag.
It was a "four-bit" box and otherwise
agrees with what all the local officers
now know concerning the one who con
veyed the poison to Mrs. Dunning and
her sister.
Mr. Kuhn, the proprietor of the Wave,
says: "Any candy maker will know his
own stock or a box used in his store.
I feel safe in saying that when we get
a look at the box from Dover we can
state positively whether it came from
our store. We have none of the stock
on hand now, but I do not consider this
necessary to an identification."
Gattrell was cautioned by Chief Gall
this afternoon to do no talking, and it
is believed that the Chief is in posses
sion of fuller details than have so far
leaked out. This was not done, how
ever, until after Gattrell made his
statement to The Call correspondent.
The Chief confirmed the correctness of
the statements here given, but refused
to say whether he had learned anything
tending to corroborate Gattrell.
There is a rumor, however, that the
police have a clew to where the poison
was purchased. Mrs. Brueck, pro
prietress of the Windsor, where Mrs.
Botkin was arrested, was asked to-day
concerning the conduct of the accused
while at her place.
"Did you ever see any one else in her
room besides her companion, Mrs.
Rauof, her husband and her son?"
"No, I did not," said Mrs. Brueck.
"No one else ever came there. She did
not go out, and her meals were brought
to her."
Last night a bottle of poison was
taken from Mrs. Botkin at the sugges
tion of Dr. Stone, who suspected she
had it on her person. The physician
attended Mrs. Botkin about a month
ago, at which time she was staying
with Mrs. Rauof, a widow, who has
been her friend, nurse and confidant.
At that time Mrs. Botkin had a fever
and feared that it would develop into
typhoid. Dr. Stone during his atend
ance gave the nurse a vial containing
four grains of morphine, enough for
thirty-two doses. Dr. Stone learned of
the arrest and informed the Jailer con
cerning the poison. It is understood that
it was found on the prisoner when she
was searched at the jail.
"When asked if during his attendance
upon her the woman dropped any re
marks s-howing the state of her mind, or
having any bearings on subsequent
events, Dr. Stone declined to answer.
Mrs. Botkin was hysterical during her
illness and it was thought that possibly
she might have dropped some significant
remarks. The doctor said, however,
that he had formed his opinion of the
case from the first, and that opinion
had not been changed by subsequent
events. He declined, however, to state
what that opinion was.
The visit of Mrs. Botkin to this city
last week was wholly unexpected, ac
cording to the story of Mrs. Rauof.
Last Thursday morning a carriage
drove up to Mrs. Rauof's house in the
northern part of the town and Mrs.
Botkin alighted and said she had come
to remain a few days. She remained
at their place until Saturday, when she
sought her husband's protection.
"I knew Mrs. Botkin," said Mrs.
Rauof, "through her sister, who is the
wife of Professor McClure of Healds
burg College. When Mrs. Botkin was
sick in Oakland some months ago I
nursed her. That Is the way we be
came acquainted. I was, therefore, sur
| prised to see her again last week. After
the reports appeared connecting her
name with the poisoning of Mrs. Dun
ning and Mrs. Deane she became quite
nervous and went to her sister, who
advised her to come with me. I have
been acting only as a companion to
Mrs. Botkin and have been receiving
pay for my services.
"Do I believe she is guilty? No, I do
not," said Mrs. Rauof. "She is not the
kind of woman to do anything of the
j sort."
, Mrs. Rauof Is a widow and quite well
to do. She owns some, property in this
city. She was formerly an attendant in
the asylum here, but since has been
acting as nurse and companion to in
valid women. Last year she returned
from a trip to Johannesburg, South
Africa.

MRS. BOTKIN'S
STATEMENT
The Accused Woman Tells
Chief Lees of Her Doings
for the Past Month.
Immediately 'on her arrival at the City
Hall Mrs. Botkin was taken by Detective
Ed L. Gibson to the private office of
Chief of Police Lees. She removed her
coat and the double veil which she had
worn during the trip from Stockton to
the city and sat down to await the com
ing of the Chief, who had gone to lunch
eon. Chief Lees returned soon after, and
in a few moments Mr. Botkin arrived and
joined his wife. Chief Lees read the tele
grams and letters from the Delaware
authorities, which accused her of the
murder of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane,
and also handed her clippings from the
newspapetv which contained details and
Interviews regarding the crime. Mrs.
Botkin read a few of them and then
looked at the Chief inquiringly. Lees
fully explained the circumstances which
involved her and then asked her for her
statement, which she willingly consented
to give. Stenographer Otto heymman
was called in and the suspected woman
gave a detailed account of her doings
I since July 27 last. She was calm and
I self-contained, and gave her story in ; low,
â  well modulated tones. She dropped all her
dramatic mannerisms and affected ex
pressions, which indicated that she ap
preciated the gravity of her situation.
! She spoke slowly and carefully chose
every word, knowing that what she ut
tered would be investigated, and any
discrepancies or contradictions would
weigh heavily against her betore a jury.
She began her story with a general and
emphatic denial of the charges against
her and a sweeping refutation of all the
interviews which had been published as
coming from herself.
In reply to a question by Chief Lees
Mrs. Botkin declared that she had not
bought any candy at any place for
eighteen months, except a 10-cent bag of
lemon drops, which she purchased in
tins city for a little nephew who lives in
Mendocino County. Lees then asked her
if she did not buy a box of bonbons at
the Wave candy store in Stockton about
three weeks ago. Mrs. Botkin replied
very forcefully that she had not. The
substance of her statement follows:
"On the evening of July 27 last I took
the boat for Stockton and arrived there
the following morning. I was very ill
during the trip on the boat, and on my
arrival at Stockton I called a physician.
"On Saturday evening, August 30, I
started on my return to this city, and
arrived here Sunday morning, August 31.
I went immediately to the Victoria Hotel,
at the corner of California and Hyde
streets. I had not fully recovered from
my illness at Stockton, and I suffered a
relapse on the return trip. I felt so badly
after my return that I again sent for a
doctor and remained in the hotel until
â \Y< dnesday, August 3. That afternoon I
began making preparations for a visit to
my sister. Mrs. McClure, who lives in
Heaklsburg, but who was then at the
Adventist Sanitarium at St. Helena. I
gathered up my clothing and trinkets and
partially packed my trunk. During the
afternoon I visited a friend who lives
on Bush street to say good-by to her.
Prom my friend's house I returned to
the Victoria and remained there that
night and all the next day, up to the time
of my departure for St. Helena. This
was on Thursday, August 4. The train
left about 3 in the afternoon, and I went
directly from my hotel to the ferry. I
did not stop anywhere nor did I post or
cause to be posted a box of candy ad
dressed to Mrs. J. P. Dunning at Dover,
Del. From this city I proceeded, with
out stopover, to St. Helena. My brother-
in-law, N. C. McClure, was waiting for
mi- at the depot, and I rode with him
to the sanitarium, where I remained with
my relative until Sunday, August 7. On
Sunday we drove from St. Helena to my
Bister's home in Healdsburg. a distance
of thirty-five miles*. I passed a week
there, resting and enjoying- the quiet of
country life. Sunday, August 14. I first
read of the death of Mrs. Dunning and
her sister. I was shocked beyond expres
sion at the fiendish act.
"The next day (Monday) a lady reporter
on one of the San Francisco papers call
ed on me and asked for an interview.
I told her everything I knew freely and
frankly, and allowed her to examine and
copy letters T had received, from Mr.
Dunning. I wish to state here that I was
not truthfully reported by the paper the
lady represented. She informed me that
a very strong suspicion existed that I
was the person who sent the poisoned
candy to Mrs. Dunning, and I gave her
every detail of my relation with the
dead woman's husband. My sister and I
discussed the case and she advised me
to fX'i to my husband at Stockton, and
I acquiesced. The reporter before re
ferred to asked permission to accompany
me, and on the urgent request of my sis
ter I consented. We went to Stockton
Wednesday, August 17, and there I re
mained until arrested and brought to this
city."
At the conclusion of her statement Mrs.
Botkin addressed these words directly
to Chief Lees: "Now I am here, and I
have told you all I know about the
case."
The prisoner was then taken to the
City Prison and placed in charge of the
matron. Her name whs not entered upon
the prison- register, but probably will be.
as sho was arrested on a warrant.
Chief Leos sakl he did not cross-exam
ine the suspected poisoner. He only ask
ed her a few questions which were sug
gested in a letter received yesterday
from Attorney General White of Dela
ware.
The Chief is certain of one point,
however, which is that the "English
woman" referred to In the Eastern dis
patches and Mrs. Botkin are one and the
same person. She has all the physical
characteristics of an English woman, and
speaks with a decidedly English accent.
Without knowing her nationality any
one would declare sho was born in the
mother country. The letter received by
Chi* f Lees contains the information that
the bonbons arrived at Dover August
9, not August 10, as has been printed.
Mrs. Botkin was not questioned about
any persons whose names have been
mentioned in connection with the mur
der of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane.
The suspected poisoner's statement was
transcribed and a copy given to her, so
she could read it and make any correc
tions she wished.
Mrs. Botkin's trunk was delivered at
the Chief's office later in the afternoon,
and it was unlocked and the contents
carefully examined. The police say
they found nothing among her effects
which could be used as incriminating evi
dence against the accused, nor was there
anything in the trunk bearing even in
directly on the tragedy.

Interviewed in Her Prison

Kodak fiends and a batch of morbid
curiosity seekers were on hand when, at
12:15, the unfortunate woman, accompa
nied by her husband and Detective Gib
son, landed at the ferry depot. They
crowded around the accused, vainly
striving to catch a glimpse of the face
so securely screened from vulgar gaze
behind a double veil. Mrs. Botkin wore
a neat tailor suit with tight fitting
basque, the severe cut of which showed
to disadvantage the lines of her plump
short waisted figure. Jauntily perched
on her head was a white sailor hat â em
blem of everything that is gay and bright
and happyâ firmly secured by a heavily
dotted fishnet veil, over which was v. orn

meshes of which it was impossible to

eyes, broad low brow, strong large mouth
and white teeth.

erect, shoulders well squared and feet
firmly planted she stood until the car
riage drove up. Then Detective Gibson
chivalrously assisted her to enter, taking
his seat by her side, while Mr. Botkin
boarded the first outgoing street car.
On her arrival at the City Hall, Mrs.
Botkin was immediately ushered into the
presence of Chief Lees, with whom she
was closeted for nearly two hours. Alter
her interview with the Chief she went
to lunch with her husband to a cafe op
posite the City Hall. With a solicitude
no one expects to find in a detective, Gib
son stood watch at the cafe door, with
one eye on the strawberry shortcake in
the show window and the other on his
fair prisoner, who was allowed to enjoy
an interrupted tete-a-tete luncheon with
her husband-.
Mrs. Botkin pave the orderâ roast beef
and corn, with peaches and cream for
dessert. The shrimps which were brought
as an appetizer Mrs. Botkin tasted not.
She watched her husband as he slowly
picked the little pink things, frequently
moistening his lips with white wine, and
spoke in sharp, quick ejaculations. For
fully ten minutes she waited for the
luncheon, which did not come, and then
at a word from her Mr. Botkin summoned
the negligent waiter. "I want my lunch,"
said the woman who has been called a
modern Lucretia Borgia. "Bring it,
please; please bring it quickly!" she ex
claimed in eager tones, accompanying the
same with an impatient gesture and a
dramatic roll of her dark eyes.
When her lunch finally came she ate
quickly, with seeming enjoyment, during
which time she kept up a running con
versation. Her face, framed in by her
raised veil, looked pale and slightly
drawn, but there was no hunted look in
the eyes that gazed constantly toward her
husband, without one return look. Mr.
Botkin seldom spoke. He never raised
his eyes. After luncheon Mrs. Botkin
adjusted her double veil, while her hus
band settled the accoount. and then tak
ing his proffered arm went back again to
the Chiefs office.
After a short interview with the Chief
Mrs. Botkin was turned over to the cus-'
tody of Matron Casey, and her first words
to her keeper were: "I won't see any
newspaper people. I don't want to be
interviewed. I will see no one, not even
if they come from God"s footstool, except
my relations."
In her dread of the interviewer Mrs.
Botkin appealed to Detective Gibson for
protection. "While they were In the
Chief's office she implored the detective
to save her from press representatives,
who. she declared, were lurking in
every nook and corner, eagerly anxious
to hear anything she might say.
To requests for interviews Mrs. Botkin
returned answer "that never to her dying
day, and not even then, would she ever
make a statement for publication."
With her quarters in the prison Mrs.
Botkin is perfectly pleased. "I am as
easy and cheerful here," she said to the
matron, "as though I were in my own
parlor."
FORGIVEN BY
HER HUSBAND
After a Separation of Two
Years Mr. Botkin Comes to
His Wife's Rescue.
Mr. Botkin. the husband of the accuses
woman, has acted most nobly in endeav
oring to shield his wife, whether she is
guilty of the awful murder or not. Not
withstanding the 'exposure of all her
scandalous actions with Dunning, her
husband, with extraordinary fortitude,
is preparing to defend her name and
save her from conviction, if it lies within
his power. He remained with her while
she made her statement to the Chief of
Police, and accompanied her to the City
Prison, where she was placed in charge
of the matron.
Mr. Botkin lingered but a few mo
ments in the matrons room and then
said good-by to his wife. He left the
prison and went downtown to consult an
attorney.
Mr. Botkin took a long breath when
he passed out of the prison and the iron
door closed behind him with a rattle and
slam. He looked worried and careworn,
and he walked in a dejected and dis
pirited manner. He said to a reporter:
"There will be no more interviews with
my wife. She has been interviewed too
much already. For myself, I have noth
ing to say that has not already appear
ed in the papers. I am still convinced
that my wife is not guilty of murder or
any other crime, and in a short time she
will be free. Regarding our future life,
nothing need be said.
"Regarding Dunning and my wife s
association with him, I have only this
to say. I do not believe there is one iota
of truth in the stories which have ap
peared in the newspapers about them.
Mrs. Botkin was lively and jolly, and she
liked Dunning as a friend only. These
tales about orgies and wildly hilarious
doings at 927 Geary street are all lies.
"The arrest of Mrs. Botkin on suspi
cion only is a hard blow to me and toner.
But she has recovered from her trifrnt
and is now resigned and composed. Her
conscience is clear, and she has no ap
prehension as to the final outcome.
"For generations my family name has
never been tarnished, and this is the first
time, to my knowledge, that a Botkin
has ever been behind prison bars or ac
cused of a crime. ââ_
"I intend to remain here until to-mor
row and perhaps longer. This is a busy
season in the grain business, and I am
anxious that my business shall not sur
fer. I have never had any trouble of this
character to contend with, and L have
not formed any plans. I shall try to se
cure the services of George A. Knight or
General W. H. L. Barnes, but both these
attorneys are at Sacramento, and i do
not know when they will return.
"I have decided on one thing, however.
I shall see that my wife has every pro
tection the law can give her, as I know
she is innocent."
Mr. Botkin was born in Ohio, and mov
ed from his native State to Missouri
when he was a young man. He, like
many other venturesome men, has madÂ©
and lost money, and at present he is not
well fixed financially. He conducts a
branch of a San Francisco grain broker
firm at Stockton. His son assists him.
Some time ago they had an office at
Merced, but were not successful in that
field. Mrs. Botkin is a member of one ol
the most respected families in this Stata
âthe Browns of Mendocino County. ShÂ«
has several sisters, all most estimable
women. She was born in Missouri, anÂ«
the major part of her life was spent is
that State. She married Mr. Botkla
when she was 18 years old. That was
twenty-six years ago. Ten years ago she
came 'with "her family to California, and
she has since resided in this State. She
separated from her husband two years
ago and came to this city. He went to
Stockton and has been there ever since.
DUNNING HAS
SUSPICIONS
NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â "My lips have
been sealed by the State authorities of
Delaware, by whom I am instructed not
to make any statement in regard to the
death of my wife and her sister, caused
by eating poisoned candy."
John P. Dunning sat in his room in the
Astor House to-day when he made this
statement.
"Were you surprised at Mrs. Botkin's
arrest?" he was asked.
"No. I wish to say. however, that the
stories that I am endeavoring to shield
any one connected with this case are ab
solutely false. I am aiding and I intend
to aid the authorities of Delaware in
every way to secure evidence and assist
them to discover and punish the guilty
said he had asked the Dela
ware detectives to show him the box 01
poisoned candy his wife had received ana
also the paper in which it was wrapped
and upon which the name and address
were written. They did not have it with
them however, and he did not see it.
"Did you see the threatening anony
mous letters?" he was asked.
"That I do not care to say, as it may
be against the instructions I received.
"Then you will not say whether you re
cognized* the writing of the letters or
"Personally. I see no objection to tell
ing what I know but that I must pre
serve for the trial. â¢
"I shall be a witness and intend to tell
everythingâ all I know. I shall shield no
Dunning admitted he had a strong sus.
picion as to the guilty person, and also
that it was on the evidence he gave the
Deleware authorities that a dectective
was sent to San Francisco.
"There are several perons whose
names have been connected with the case
whom I know are innocent," said he.
"Two are Mrs. Corbally, who was a
good friend of my wife and myself, and
Paul Cowles. who worked with me in the
Associated Press office in San Francisco.
Beyond that I do not care to say any
thing, except that it is true that I know
the women whose names have been con
nected with the case, all of whom live in
San Francisco."
Dunning says he will continue to ob
tain all the evidence he can to convict
the person who is guilty of the crime
and that person he is confident he can
name.
ON THE TRACK OF
THE POISONER
WILMINGTON, Del., Aug. 24.â Attorney
General White said to-day when asked
about the progress being made by the
State authorities in the Dover poisoning
case: "We are confident that we are on
the right track. Weeks may elapse be
fore we can complete the case, but I can
assure you that nobody can get away."
The Secretary of State said that no
requisition papers had been sent to San
Francisco, but they were ready when
needed, which would probably not be un
til a hearing had been held In California.
