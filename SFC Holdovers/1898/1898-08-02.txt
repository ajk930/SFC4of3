TAMP DEWF.Y, July 23. vi& Hong
kong:, Aug. 1. â The Spaniards have be
gun a movement to concentrate their
forces In the inner line of the intrench
ments south of Manila. There was
heavy flphttne before Santa Ana early
Friday morning, and the Spanish forces
fell back from the English Cemetery,
where they had held a strong position.
They still hold the block house close to
the cemetery, thejr fire sweeping the
road to the abandoned position, which
the rebels did not attempt to occupy.
One insurgent was killed. â 
The Spaniards have also fallen back
from Mindoyalayon, on the north side i
of Pasig River, into Santa Mesa, but
there have been no insurgent advances,
the Santa Mesa batteries rendering the
villages untenable.
On Thursday night the insurgents
captured five Mestizo spies on the
Malate lines. They had passes from j
Captain General Augustl rolled into '
cigarettes. General Nortlal court-mar- â 
tialed them and condemned all to i
death.
It is reported by the insurgents that j
a Spanish officer was detected attempt- j
Ing to escape to Manila with numerous I
documents in cipher from Cavite.
Last night two of the Oregon senti
nels at Fort San Felipe fired on objects
they believed to b*Â» Spanish prisoners
escaping along the ramparts. The
startled camp turned out, 'but the ;
jrunrds reported no prisoners missing.
By the accidental discharge -of an Ore- I

General Anderson, acknowledging,
said that the American people had won
their own freedom, so they wished all
others free. The prtnptple of the Amer

Sixth-'-Internal disasters of the grav
est character threaten the Spanish
Government, and all the military
strength that can be mustered, includ
ing: the forces in the colonies, may be
needed at an early date to save the
monarchy.
So confident are all the authorities
that. Spain will submit to our demands
that the President is already giving se
rious consideration t-i many things that
must be done incident to the close of
the war. He discussed with friends to
day the question of an early call for an
extra session of. 'ongress not only for
the purpose of having the Senate ratify
the treaty of peace, but to procure the
necessary legislation in both houses to
continue the volunteers in service and
to put the regular army oh a wÂ«r foot
ing as long as it may be necessary to
occupy the conquered territory and also
for such legislation afTeciing Porto Ri
co and American possessions in the Pa
cific as may be necessary. There is
much yet to be done before the treaty
of peace is signed. Should Spain accept
the terms proposed by the President It
will then be necessary for a represen
tative of the United States, who will be
the Secretary of State and a represen
tative of Spain, who will probably be
Embassador Cambon, to meet and for
mally draft and sign a treaty based
upon the terms proposed by the United
States and accepted by Spain.

There are now two Spanish torpedo

NEW BATTLESHIPS
OF THE NAVY MUST
HAVE HIGH SPEED
Under Secretary Lord's Irjistruc
tions Designs for Very Swift
Vessels Being Considered.
NEW YORK, Aug. I.â A. Washington special to the Herald says:
Impressed with the necessity of adding fast battleships to the navy,
Secretary Long has directed the Board Of Construction to prepare
new designs for the three ships of this type authorized by the last
naval appropriation law. These designs are to be for vessels averag
ing a speed of at least IS knots. In accordance with the Secretary's
instructions, the Board, at a meeting held this afternoon, commenced
the discussion nf the proposed plans, but beyond the presentation of
views by Chief Naval Constructor Hichborn and other offi
cials little progress was made. Of course, the new designs will not be
completed on September 1. when bids for the construction of the bat
tleships on the old designs and on the private designs of shipbuild
ers will be opened. Should none of the private plans promise a higher
speed than the minimum limit fixed by the Government or meet with
the approval of the department, Secretary Long will undoubtedly re
ject all of the bids and await the completion of new designs when
bids on them will be called for. If the bids should be higher than the
limit of the cost fixed by lawâ s3,ooo,oooâ Secretary Long may bring
the matter to the attention of Congress, and ask that a larger sum be
appropriated. The Secretary is determined, to secure higher speed
with vessels equally formidable, at least, as those built in the past,
and while some delay in the construction of the ships may occur he
feels his action will be justifiable.
Ponce to Tauco is now in the posses
sion of our troops. Our troops found
seventeen Spaniards in the Vauro hos
pital, all of whom had been wounded in
Tuesday's fight. Two of them have
since died.
Proclamations have been, issued by
the authorities of Yauco as a United
States city, expressing delight at an
nexation and the administration of
General Miles and welcoming our
troops. The local Mayor and Judges
and police will remain in authority,
subject to the orders of General Wilson.
The customs h >use offices will also be
conducted as formerly for the present.
Their receipts amount to a considerable
sum of money.

tween the Spaniards and rebels for four
days past, neither side earing to fight
in ihe rain. There has been a shortage
of firewood at camp on several occa
sions. The natives have driven off with
knives the soldiers sent to cut down
trees, and clashes have been imminent
at several times v but the officers have
been able to restrain the soldiers.
Major Bell of the Bureau of Military
Information, accompanied by Lieuten
ant Connor of the Engineers, and Kear
Engelsjon, a Norwegian, and a former
resident of Manila, have returned to
Cavite from the most daring recon
naissance yet accomplished. They were
landed by the Petrel north of Manila,
and {traveled three days through the
rain and in the water sometimes waist
deep. They acquired valuable tono
graphical information.
The men encamped are exposed to the
weather, and unless a forward move
ment occurs goon much sickness is In
evitable, as the camp is on low lying
land not easily drained.
According to the present plans a
probable demand for the surrender of
Manila will be sent to Captain General
Augusti. If the surrender is refused
the fleet will attack in front ani the
First and Second Brigades under Gen
eral Anderson will advance southeast
through San Sodro, Macate and Wan
duyolayori upon the Spanish positions
at Santa Ana and Santa Mesa. If Cap
tain General Augusti surrenders the
American troops will land at Manila,
thf- troops at Camp Dewey holding the
insurgents in check.
..General Anderson will not co-operate
with the Insurgents. General Greene,
â¢commanding Camp Dewey, has estab
lished.outposts entirely regardless of
the position of Aguinaldo's soldiers. Or
ders have been given to impress from
the : natives whatever is desirable, re
gardless of the dictator's prohibition
\\p<<r.. the sale of horses and supplies to
jVrriericans.
PANGEROUS ATTITUDE
OF THE INSURGENTS
WASHINGTON, Aug. I.â General
MeFritt has again cabled the War De
partment relative to the situation in
: Manila, which he finds very unsatis
factory and dangerous, owing to the
attitude of the insurgents. In the opin
ion: of General Merritt the position of
th f insurgents there is similar to that
assumed by Garcia's Cubans upon the
question of their right to enter and
possess themselves of the city, although
in this ease the insurgents are a very
.much more formidable element, being
not only more numerous, but better
armed and filled with the arrogance fol
lowing numerous victories over their
Spanish foes. General Merritt, how
ever, indicates that he will do his ut
most to protect the citizens from the
.savagery of the insurgents, though his
task is a delicate and difficult one be
cause of the fact that he must, while
fighting the Spaniards, be ready at any
moment to repel the insurgents.
The general gave notice that he was
about to combine with Admiral Dewey
in a joint demand for tbe surrender of
the; city to the United States forces,
thus forestalling the insurgents, and
j this move may cause a rupture.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TCKSDAY, AUGT'ST 2, 189 S.
IN THE CHAMBER
OF DEATH AT THE
HOME OF BISMARCK
Features of the Prince Serene
and Natural, Little Changed
From Life.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. ISBB, by Jamejs Gor
don Bennett.
FRIEDRICHSRUHE, Aug. I.âPro
fessor yon Lenbach arrived this after
noon. He has just seen Bismarck's
body and tells me of his impressions,
Bismarck looks simple and dignified â
ve-ry much in death as in life, though
paler if possible. Hands always beau
tiful have become more delicate still,
but death has not changed Prince Bis
marck as it did Dr. Dollinger, who In
life had a somewhat reddish face,
which in death was idealized almost to
marble like cameo.
Professor yon Lenbach is eloquent
with anecdotes concerning his idolized
friend. He was here on the occasion
of Prince Bismarck's eightieth birthday
three years ago, and on parting told
the Prince he felt sure he had many
happy years yet before him.
"My dear Lenbach," Bismarck re
plied, "the first eighty years of a man's
life are always the happiest."
More recently still, last year, in say
ing good-by. Professor yon Lenbach
again expressed the hope that his
friend would sue still some happy days.
To this Prince Bismarck replied:
"There's only one happy day left for
me; it is the one on which I shall not
wake up again."
Two of the Prince's foresters in gray
and green uniforms hold guard by the
bedside. They are changed every two
hours. 1 glanced around the plainly
furnished room. On the wall over the
li'ail of the bed hang the pictures of
the Prince's favorite horse and dog; to
the left hang the pictures of Princess
Bismarck, their son William and a por
trait of Schweninger by Professor yon
Lenbach; at the foot of the bed still
stands the Prince's weighing machine,
and still further away is the couch on
which Dr. Schweninger slept watching
for months past when at Friedrichs
ruhe.
Passing into the next room I find it
fillled with objects sadly reminding me
of the departed statesman. A picture
of Li Hung Chang rests on the floor
for want of a better place, but a globe
of the world, with raised mountains
and deepened seas, has a place on the
table, and an article appropriate and
useful to one for whom the world was
indeed a stage â an arena of battle.
Drinking cups are there, too, and there
are a number of hats and sticks. The
room in which Bismarck died is being
draped with black, as the body is to
remain there until the mausoleum is
built.
This evening his remains will be
placed in a coffin which is of black pol
ished wood, with two massive silver
handles and four metal feet, represent
ing a lion's head. The funeral service
has t>een deferred until tn-jnornnv, as
it is V'ount birthday. A guard
of Bismarck's cuirassiers in their white
uniforms arrived from Halberstadt this
morning. Prince Hohenlohe, Imperial
Chancellor, has just come on a visit of
condolence.
OFFERED BURIAL IN
THE IMPERIAL TOMBS
Emperor William's Tender Letter.
Bismarck's Epitaph as Writ
ten by Himself.
BERLIN, Aug. I.â ln regard to
Prince Bismarck's testament it Is
known that Friedrlchsruhe, v.-ith the
title of Prince, descends to Count Her
bert Bismarck, the oldest son, the fam
ily of Count yon Rantzau, the husband
of Prince Bismarck's daughter, remain-
Ing thtre temporarily. Schoenhausen
goes to Count William Bismarck, the
second son. The late. Prince's money,
which is estimated to amount to sev
eral million marksâ a larger amount
than was generally supposedâ is divid
ed among the three children and the
young Rantzau. The money is partly
in the Bank ofJEngland_ and partly in
the Bleiroeder Bank. ~ The decora
tions, diamonds and art objects, valued
at about a million marks, are deposited
with a Berlin jeweler.
Dr. Schweriinger. the Prince's physi
cian, now says that the ' immediate
cause of death was effusion of blood
on the brain.
The remains of the great Chancel
lor's have been dressed in the uniform
of the Halberstcdt cuirassiers. An
enormous number of wreaths and other
Iloral tributes have already arrived at
Friedrichsruhe. So strict is the exclu
sion at the Schloss that Count Poso
dowski, the Minister of the Interior,
had to wait twenty minutes before he
was admitted.
The official Reichanzeiger, which
appears to-day with black borders,
publishes the telegram which Emperor
William sent Prince Herbert Bismarck.
It is as follows:
"In deep sorrow and sympathizing at
the grief which has struck you all for
yuur beloved great dead, I lament the
loss of Germany's great son, whose
faithful co-operation in the work of
uniting the Fatherland won for him
the lifelong friendship of my grand
father, resting in God, and the undying
thanks of the whole German people for
all time. 1 shall prepare a last abode
for his remains in Berlin, in the Cathe
dral by' the side of my ancestors."
The Emperor has ordered the court
to go into mnurning for ten days, and
has ordered the army to Â«ro into mourn
ing for eight days.
The flags on all the imperial and state
buildings will be at half-mast until af
ter the funeral.
The Reichanzeiger publishes a long
article to-day extolling Bismarck's im
mortal services and declaring the Fath
erland has lost her greatest so-n. After
saying that Prince Bismarck was not
only the unifier, but also the educator
of nis people, the Reichanzeiger con
tinues: "If it is true that states are
maintained by the spirit and power in
which they are created the name of
Bismarck will remain for us as a device
and a revelation at all times."
A dispatch from Friedrichsruhe to
the Hamburg Nachriehten says it has
been definitely decided that the remains
of Prince Bismarck are to be interred
at the spot selected by himseJf, where
a simple mausoleum will be built, and
to which the remains of his wife will
be transferred from Varsein. Until the
mausoleum is completed the funeral
rites will be confined to the simple cere
mony of .blessing the remains, which
will "be performed by the local pastor
of the village of Brunstorf.
Prince Bismarck's final written in
structions, signed by himserf, express
his desire to be buried in a selected
spot F*i th? Saohenswnid, and conclude:
"For an epitaph I wish: 'Prince yon
Bismarck, born April 1, 1815, died ,'
with the addition of 'A faithful German
servant Â©f Rmpefor William I.' "
-. Prince. Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chan
cellor, took a special train for Fried
richsruhe this afternoon, in order to
convey to the family the condolences
of the Prussian Ministry of State and
to place a wreath upon the Chancellor's
bier.
The City Councils of Berlin and Mu
nich will hold special sessions on Tues
day, the Prince having had the hon
orary freedo-m of these cities.
The Carlruhe City Council has passed
a resolution of condolence and has se
lected delegates to attend the funeral.
Baron yon Bulow tells the corre
spondent of the Associated Press that
nothing definite regarding Prince Bis
marck's funeral will be decided upon
until the wishes of Emperor William
and the family of the deceased are as
certained.
This evening Prince yon Hohenlohe,
the Imperial Chancellor, and Count yon
Schoenborn arrived at Friedrichsruhe.
In the presence of the Chancellor the
coffin was closed, after which Prince
Hohenlohe left Friedrichsruhe.
Emperor William, accompanied by
the Empress, who wore a mourning cos
tume, arrived at Kiel this evening. Ba
ron yon Bulow, the Foreign Minister,
and Dr. yon Lucanus, chief of the Em
peror's Civil Cabinet, are also at Kiel.
The Emperor has ordered that gor
geo.us funeral obsequies be held in Ber
lin on the square in front of the Reich
stag building.
The famous German artist, Hen-
Franz yon Lenbach, has been commis
sioned to paint a portrait of the dead
statesman.
The ceremony of blessing Prince Bis
marck's remains will be performed to
morrow, only the near relatives attend
ing. The coffin will then be closed and
will remain in the castle until the mau
soleum is completed, which will be in
October next.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. I.â The
newspapers here are unanimous in
lauding the greatness and eminent gen
ius of Prince Bismarck. â¢
The Novoe Vremya says: "He was
the most gifted diplomatist of all time 1 ."
WASHINGTON. Aug. I.âEmbassa
dor White to-day cabled the State De
partment as follows:
BERLIN, Aug. I.â Adee, Acting Secre
tary. State Department, Washington: I
â¢am requested to tender the thanks of the
Emperor and the German- people to the
President and people of the United States
for the messape of condolence referring to
the death of Prince Bismarck. WHITE.
FRIEDSDICHRUHE, Aug. I.âEm
peror Williams, who has ordered Pro
fessor Regas, the sculptor, to design a
sarcophagus for the German sover
eigns, has announced his? intention of
attending the funeral here, but Count
Herbert yon Bismarck informed his
Majesty that the service would be
strictly private and without ceremony.
Condolences and wreaths are pouring
in by thousands from all the courts,
governments and foremost statesmen
of the world.
LADY YARDE-BULLER
REACHES EASTON, PA.
Remains Quietly in a Hotel Await
ing Letters From Her
Friends.
NEW YORK, Aug. I.â An Easton, Pa.,
special to the Herald soys: L,ady Lellah
Tarde-Buller, who was liberated recently
from an Insane asylum in Paris, and who
upon reaching New York on her way to
San Francisco became separated
from her friends, has been found in
Easton, Pa- The etory of the woman's
coming eastward is almost as strange as
the tale of her life. She started on a
Lehigh /alley train Friday afternoon
from New York for her summer home
In California. She told the conductor
that in some mann&r she had become
separated from her guardian and friends
who were to have met her at the station.
She had no ticket and was without
money. Her manner and dress showed
her to be a person of more than usual
intelligence and culture, and the hand
bags she carried with her bore Cunard
line labels, showing that she had recent
ly crossed the ocean. Not knowing who
his passenger was. the conductor brought
her to Easton, and she waa taken to the
Franklin House, where Robert Horn, the
proprietor, agreed to give her accommo
dations until she might communicate with
her friends. At the hotel she registered
as "Hon. Leilah Kirkham," and directly
underneath the name "Yarde-Buller."
The signature was written in a large,
bold hand. She has been seen very little
about the hotel. She has spent nearly
all the time in her room, where her meals
are served. To the few persons who have
met her she has given the impression of
being an eccentric character. She has
written several letters and mailed them
since she came to Easton, but up to to
day she received no word from her
friends.
FINDS THE TREASURY
PRACTICALLY EMPTY
San Jose's Mayor Proposes a Bond
Issue to Raise Money for
City Government.
SAN JOSE, Aug. I.â Mayor Martin de
livered his annual message at a meeting
of the Common Council this afternoon.
It opened by stating that the present city
officials of San Jose were confronted at
the beginning of their terms with what
was practically an empty treasury. The
preceding administration had left some
money in the various funds of the city
treasury, but against these funds bills
had been contracted, which left the
funds that were in the bÂ«st condition
practically without money to their credit,
and several of the funds entirely bank-
rupt.
Mayor Martin recommended the issu
ance of bonds for the purpose of acquir
ing an electric lighting plant for the city.
He says he haa been investigating the
lighting question and finds that the city
Is at the mercy of the lighting companies.
The Electric Improvement Company has
the contract at present for lighting the
city, and the Mayor says the agreement
is all one-sided. The city pays $1510 per
month for street lighting, or $10 per light
per month. The streets are not lighted
on moonlight nights.
The messaee says this city could light
its streets for half the amount now paid.
Last year the city paid $20,000 to the
Electric Improvement Company for street
lights and lighting buildings. It is stated
a plant could be erected for $40,000 that
could furnish 200 street lights and illumi
nate all city buildings.
Some $13,000 is needed to finish the
basement of and furnish the new High
School, and the Council is asked to con
sider the advisability of submitting to the
people an issue of bonds for this purpose.
Extension of the city limits is also fa
vored.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CONEY ISLAND ATHLETIC CLUB,
Aug. I.â A draw was the decision ren
dered to-night at the Greater New York
Athletic Club, Coney Island, after Tom
my White of Chicago and Solly Smith
of Los Angeles had fought twenty-five
rounds to decide the feather weight
championship of the world. The men
met at 122 pounds.
Dave Sullivan was at the ringside to
challenge the winner and will deposit
$1000 to-morrow to bind a match with
White. The very best judges of boxers
who witnessed the fight all aerree that
White had won fairly and squarely.
Smith was the first to enter the ring
with his seconds.Jimmy Rose.Billy Self
ridge, Johnny Connors and Jimmy Al
len. Sam Fitzpatrick held the watch
for Smith. Tommy White got through
the ropes at 11:20. His handlers were
Billy Madden, Gus Ruhlln, Charley
Goff and Jack McAuliffe. It was an
nounced that the men would box twen
ty-five rounds and continue sparring
until ordered to break away by the ref
eree.
The first round was featureless, but
in the second Smith swung a hard left
that put White's eye in mourning:, and
in the third jabbed his right to the eye,
drawing blood, though he received sev
eral hard body blows in return.
In round four. Smith sent a left to
the head, followed by a right swing to
the head that sent White to the floor.
Rounds five, six, seven and eight were
full of lively sparring, but not import
ant. In the ninth Solly again started
blood from White's damaged eye.
In the twelfth round a left on the
head brought Smith to his knees. At
the end of the thirteenth Smith's nose
was bleeding freely. Some stiff blows
were exchanged in the succeeding
rounds, but the fifteenth, sixteenth and
seventeenth rounds were tame.
In the eighteenth White swung his
left to the head and turned Solly
around. Solly replied with a right
hook on the kidneys, and in the nine
teenth Solly rushed and got a stiff left
in the mouth. When they came up
again Solly was full of fight and rushed
again, some hot work being done in
the mix-up.
In round nineteen Solly rushed and
White met him with a very stiff left
on the mouth.
In round twenty Solly rushed and
jabbed a hard left on the face. He
rushed again and they clinched without
striking -a blow. Solly was full of fight
and sent another left to the face and
White met him with a hard right on
the face. White jabbed two lefts on
the face.
Round 21â Solly whipped his left hard
on the ribs and missed a right swing
on the breakaway. White swung left
twice to the head at the end of this
round.
Round 22â They rushed to a clinch
and Smith brought his right back on
the face. The referee warned him not
to repeat this. Solly jabbed right to
the face and they clinched. Solly
swung a hard right to back of the
neck.
Round 23 â Solly rushed and hooked
his right to the ribs and drove his
right straight over the heart. White
swung his right to the jaw and re
peated It, sending Solly to the floor on
his back. He was up in five seconds
and made a wild rush. They clinched
and both fell to the floor twice, amid
cries of "Foul, foul." White jabbed a
left on the face in wild fighting and
Smith was all but out when the bell
rang.
Round 24 â They rushed into clinches
twice, and Smith swung a light left on
the neck and jabbed his left on the face.
Pmith fought wildly without doing any
damage.
Round 25 â They shook hands and
rushed into a clinch. Smith rushed and
took all kinds of chances. Smith
roughed and both hit in the clinches,
which were frequent. Smith swung his
right lightly to the head. White jabbed
his left to the nose, drawing the blood
again. A clinch followed and there
was a great deal of rough infighting
on both sides until the gong put an end
to the fight. The spectators by this
time were wild with excitement and
were shouting for both men. Referee
Brown declared thp bout a draw.

Business and Victorians Are
Also Hit Hard.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Aug. I.â Local
marine underwriters who have been tak
ing risks on stern-wheelers going as
tows to St. Michael are panic-stricken.
Owing to the frequent wrecks they have
lost thousands in the past two months.
On Saturday they raised the rate from
5 to 10 per cent.
News of the wreck of the Vancouver
steamer Mono north of Wrangel reached
here to-day, and the underwriters decided
to go out of business altogether. The
Victoria underwriters who lost heavily by
insuring the 111-fated Moran fleet have
signified their intention of doing like
wise. Insurance men say fhe.v would not
take risks now at 20 per cent, and in con
sequence any stern-wheelers leaving here
for the north in future will po uninsured.
Most of the vessels lost recently were in
sured for $20.00<i to $3(1.000, ami nearly all
the marfne companies have been hit hard.

seven years ago. He had always been
extremely Jealous of her, and at times
he was thought to be insane. On Sun
day night the husband and wife at
tended a dance, where they quarreled
over the attentions offered the wife by
a young- man named Birley. Wasgo
threatened to shoot him, but finally left
for home about 1 o'clock, when the do
mestic quarrel was resumed.
'When neighbors entered the Wasgo
home this morning a horrible scene was
presented. On the kitchen floor the
wife lay dead in a pool of blood. She
had received two shots in the abdomen
and one in the head. In another room
on a bed were found the two innocent
victims of a disordered mind. Each
little one had been shot twice. The
youngest was still alive, but all that
human effort could do did not save her
life. The husband lay on the floor,
grasping a 38-caliber revolver in hia
right hand, with a bullet in his brain.
The murdered woman evidently made
a desperate fight for her life. She fled
from the bedroom to the kitchen, where
the furniture was knocked over and,
blood, hair and clothing lay scattered
about the room. An Inquest was held
to-day, at which the Coroner's jury
rendered a verdict that the deceased
had come to their death at the hands
of the husband and father through in
sanity and Jealousy,

AN AWE-INSPIRING SPECTACLE
ARMY OF CITIZENS FIGHTING
THE FLAMES.
Highland Springs Has a Very Nar
row Escap* â Deer Hunters Held
Responsible for the De
vastation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LAKEPORT, Aug. I.â For nearly a
week past fierce fires have been raging
! in the mountains west of town, denud
i ing them of brush and timber. Last
| Friday four of the fires ran together
i and created such a terrible conflagra
| tion that all of the available men in
! this vicinity were called to Highland
Springs to help fight it. There was also
a large delegation from Kelseyville.
I The men commenced back firing, ex
tending over an area of several miles
in length, and were successful in break
ing the force of the fire. Had it not
been for assistance that great resort
would have undoubtedly been burned.
Another fire is now threatening Big
Valley and the farmers are plowing the
outside of their fields and then plow
ing another strip parallel a few feet
from the other and burning the stub
ble between. This fire has destroyed
nearly all the timber in Manning's
Canyon and burned several rar^hers
out. One man alone, Peter Boggs, lost
several thousand dollars' worth of tim
ber.
Still another fire is raging northwest
of town in the: vicinity of Cow Moun
tain. It started in Mendocino County,
and has been burning for a week.
These fires are all supposed to have
been started by hunters who do it to
drive out the deer. .; One of the sus
pects is being hunted for by the offi
cers, and if captured and proved guilty
it will go hard with him, as the people
will stand no nonsense.
; The atmnsphere is; full of smoke and
the sun is. nearly obscured. It resem
bles a high fog in the bay region. The
heat is terrific and does not abate much
at night.

CHINA AT THE
REBELS' MERCY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. I.â According
to news received in a private letter by
the steamship Tacoma, the insurrection
in China is still spreading. Nine new
towns are reported to have been cap
tured and placards are appearing de
claring wax upon the Chinese officials,
who are classed as "the curse of
China." The rebels are most barbarous,
worse enemies to civilization than even
the Chinese authorities. They are said
to be reviving the Tai-Ping watch
words. The Tai-Pings were a set of
bloodthirsty savages wliose efforts
were crushed by Gordon and his "ever
victorious army." It is reported that
the rebels in the lower kwangs of Can
ton consist of Black Flags and An
namites, the latter being trained sol
diers who have deserted from the
French forces. They are led by for
eigners.
Six gunboats have been dispatched
from Canton with 3000 Manchu troops,
who are to march overland to Mv-
Chan. Great excitement prevails at
Canton. The authorities have bought
8000 rifles and are negotiating for ma
chine guns. According to news re
ceived the day before the Tacoma's de
parture the rebels have defeated the
imperial troops and 1000 bodies have
been taken from the river and buried at
Wu-Chau. The imperial losses were
very great.
At Canton it is said that Dr. Sun
Yatsen, whose detention at the Chinese
Legation in London attracted much at
tention some time ago, is one of the
rebel leaders The kidnaping of Dr.
Sun Yatsen by emissaries .of the Chi
nese Government and his illegal deten
tion in the Chinese Legation in London
occurred in October, 1596. The doctor
is an energetic member of the "Young
China Society," and took part in a rev
olutionary attempt on the city of Can
ton In October, 1895. The attempt
fa 'led and the doctor got away to Ma
cao, whence he went to England.
Ten days after his arrival* while
walking on the streets of London, he
was accosted by a number, of China
men, who lured him into the Legation.
There he remained for eleven days, the
design of the authorities being to ship
him off secretly to China, -where, ac
cording to the statements of the Chi
nese, he was to be boiled in oil. One of
the servants of the Legation managed
to communicate the intelligence of the
outrage to the doctor's friends. The
Foreign Office at once demanded the
prisoner's release, and on October 22
Sun Yatsen was set at liberty. He
passed through here on his way to
China on the Empress steamer about a
year ago, and according to. local Chi
nese gave out then that ori his return
he would cause his country to rebel
against the Imperial powers.

Dominion Creek claims have, been in a;
muddle for; months, so tied up that they ,
could neither "be sold', nor. .worked, the.
titles to nearly all those between the two-,
Discoveries being in question.;- The first
error was made when the : .two" Discov
eries ; were .allowed to be. recorded. Alt
other claims, are recorded, .with their : re- (
lationÂ« to . Discovery, and '. miners filed ;
on claims' below the Upper Discovery and' j
above the Lower - Discovery, until they,
overlapped with :others by several claims,: :
As the measurements are at first hurried,'
and " imperfect, .each , claimant . taking
over rather than under â¢ the. KM feet, so
as to be certain of securing his full limit,
later comers get 1 up claims' to ; fractions
between the .regular claims, where the !
ground is known to -be rich. , Each man's
ground is only determined when the offi
cial surveyor does his -work. When the
Surveyor.^ went to Dominion he discov
ered (wo and -three claimants for each ;
piece of ground for over two miles of the ;
creek between Upper ami Lower Discov- :
erv. Contests were entered and a day
fixed for a. hearing. Almost every claim
owner on the creek was summoned, and;
the matter is still to be" adjusted. t , .\, â¢
As one conclusion "reached, however;
Gold Commissioner Fawcett posted a no- 1
tice about three weeks ago .declaring that
all hill claims on the creek located since
November 15 would run be recognized by :
him; that no persons would ."be allowed to
prospect hill â¢ claims on Dominion Creek i
who had not first, secured permits from |
the Commissioner;, that these permits 'â¢
could be obtained on July 11 at 10 o'clock j
and that ail parties wishing to locate I
will be required to secure a suitable pros
pecf before they would be permitted to
record. Â° ' â :'â â '".â¢â ;; Â°Â°Â° .â ,!"â¢ '.-, â¢
This order struck the camp as a partic- |
ularly unwelcome innovation. â¢ The set- i
ting aside of the recorded claims was bad !
enough to those it hit, , but would have !
been generally welcomed if It had given ,
all an equal chance to stake, .a he per- j
mlts, it -was, seen, would give those who I
received them.' first -- a great advantage i
and no one seemed to c have faith in an j
equal distribution. The notice was -post- |
ed generally throughout the : district and
miners were on their way in from dis
tant points when they met, the stampedes
coming out. â .' -*.- â  ""â¢ Â° ! ; 'â¢ â¢ "." --' : \', â !â  '
On the 9th of the. month a notice dated
on the Bth was posted about town can
celing the first order and declaring that
hill and. bench claims on Dominion Creek
were then open for location and prospect-
Ing 'y. all free miners. This was well
enough if the â  miners at distant points !
up the creek and, indeed, even those in j
town, had' not already been deceived to i
their ruin so far as staking a claim was
concerned. â¢ The fact was, however, that
a knowledge that such an order was to
be issued was given out to a few the day
before it was posted. The news passed
from one to another and the big stampede
took place. Indeed, the' fastest runners
of this crowd found men already ahead
of them, located on many of the best !
claims in the hill class. They had re- 1
ceived even an earlier tip. ;â¢'
On Saturday evening, the 9th a mass
meeting was -held on Front street, in
front of the North American Trading
Company's store, which passed : resolu
tions asking for sweeping changes in the
mining laws and regulations briefly stated
fkc follows: That the royalty be abol
ished; that there be no alternate or other
reservations of mining claims for the
crown; that claims left vacant by non
representation be open to new claimants;
that no timber limit be issued to any in
dividual or company on any creek . or
adjacent to any creek where timber may
be necessary for use in development' of
mines and that the placer creek claims be
enlarged in length to 500 feet as hereto

FORTUNES BEING BROUGHT OUT
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. I.â A Dawson
paper just received contains an account
of the sailing of the steamer Alice and of
those who left on her. She sailed from
Dawson on July 14. amidst great excite
ment, her departure, the Yukon Midnight
Sun says, equaling In Intf-rest the sailing
of a Cunarder. Fully $3<X1.000 in gold dust
was shipped, out of which sum the Akiska
Commercial Company sent $.%,000. Among
the kings of the new Ei Dorado who took'
passage nn the Alice were Antone Stan
der, Humboldt Gates. John Erickson and
Neil McKay. The . aggregate pile of this
quartet represented the greater part oT
thp dust. Antone Stander and bride (for
merly Violet Raymond, a. variety actress)
had their pile encased in live strong tin
boxes. Stander brought out about SGO,
000, while his wife's wealth Is estimated
at about $50,000. Mr. Stander upon her
bridal trip has a collection of $5000 in
large and assorted nuggets, which she
personally collected from th^ dumps, and
also a metallic chest, containing $22,000.
John Erickson and Humboldt Gates were
the other two whose sack of gold dust
approximated equaled the StnmTprs'
pile. Humbolrlt Gates leavf-s for Eur^kn,
Humboldt County. Cal., In company v.ith
his relative, C. W. Hall, of Dominion
Creak. They will remain in California
for the winter and return next spring.
Fabulous Find of Quartz.
SEATTLE, Aug. I.â A substantiation of
the story of the find of fabulously rich
quartz in Southeastern Alaska, as pub
lished In Saturday's Call, comes from
Seattle men who have large holdings In
the locality referred to. The big find is
located on Thorn Ann, about twenty-five
miles from Ketchlkan, and but a little
distance from the regular course of
Bteamers running to Dyea.
In the belt known to be rich in free
fold quartz were originally fifteen claims,
'ive are principally owned by Joseph
Humblet, a half breed prospector whose
father lives but three miles from Seattle.
The other ten are owned by the Gladia
tor Mining Company of Seattle, of which
Dr. J. Eugene Jordan is president and E.
Lobe, formerly of San Francisco, is
treasurer. _________________

CAPTURE OF A
CLEVER FORGER
Wanted in Thirty Cali
fornia Towns.
ARRESTED AT REDWOOD CITY
TAKEN BY SHEBIFF MATTHEAS
TO SALINAS.
Says He Is Guilty on Every Charge
and a Companion
Whose Nanie He Will Not
Diviilge.
Special Dispatch to The Gall.
SALINAS, Aug. I.â For over three
I years Sheriff Mattheas has been look
ing for one of the most expert forge>-3
in the State, whose work extendea In
i every direction. For several months in
the early part of 1895 checks slgrned
"Albert John Miller" or "W. Miller"
were presented at the Various banks in
San Luis Obispo County and paid, only
to be found forgeries subsequently.
During 1595 a man known as L. Rypcs
zynski worked for Charles Louis at ]
Prunedale, and he was known to re- '
celve large sums of money from various
portions of the State. He suddenly dis- !
appeared after receipt of money from
San Miguel, and then the fact became
apparent that he was a forger. A check ;
for $35 and odd cents, apparently drawn I
to the order of A. Miller by J. W. Fret- I
well on the Bank of San Miguel, was!
paid;- also two on Watsonville banks
and others.
A check in July, 1597 for $165 on the
First National Bank here, through the
Bank of Gakdale, presented to the or
det of John Miller, followed; by others j
for smaller and larger amounts, were ,
refused as forgeries. They were signed
''Berges & Garrlssere," large liquor
dealers. The forger the same year
passed a check signed by the same firm
name for. $49 on a Watsonville firm, and
one on a San Jose- firm for $67, his plan
being to border goods and receive the
change in cash. The goods were never
called for.
The forger was last. heard of at Stock
ton, where he passed a draft for $60.
The accused suddenly disappeared, but
yesterday a telephone message from
Redwood City was received stat
ing that the man wanted was there and
he was ordered arrested.
Rypeszynski was brought back this
afternoon, and confessed that he is
wanted in over thirty places in Califor
nia and is guilty in every case. He says
he was only discharged froxn Folsom
two months ago, where he was known
as "37,070," He claims that an older <
man. whom he says is also wanted for
extensive forgeries in the East, is Im
plicated, but will give no description of
his partner or details of his crime. Offi
cers here say the prisoner is apparently
an Eastern offender and connected with
the, most extensive gang of organized
forgers iri the United States.

tired from the: meeting. On October 28. 1597, he announced the removal of the entire

using it as a lever with which they could
control the party In the State. Thepc
same men arÂ« now making- plans for the
capture of the State convention. Even
the Governor seems powerless to oppose
their wishes, a fact made evident by the
manner in which the proposition to have
him made the chairman of the convention
has been shelved.
When the chairmanship of the conven
tion was brought up for discussion some
days ago It seemea to be the ereneral wish
of the Democrats cf the Stjte" that the
Governor should be ask*Â»d to preside, not
only because of his position as chief exe
cutive, but because of his service to the
party and his thorough knowledge of all
the quarrels and petty differences that
might be made causes for sctrlous dis
sensions were the guiding 1 of the conven
tion left to an inexperienced hand. But
this did not suit the gentlemen who havo
assumed the role of dictators. Budd had
opposed the action of these men in steal
ing control of the local Democracy, and
if he were chairman of the convention
he might appoint a committee on creden
tials that would report favorably on
seating the Hamey delegates that will b.>
sent to Sacramento. So they put on the
screws and caused it to be announced
that Governor Budd would probably re
fuse to accept the chairmanship, and that
his mantle would fall on the shoulders of
Robert Fitzgerald, one of the men who
was an active participant in the local po
litical hold-up.
The case as it stands is that no one
but the self-appointed dictators of thn
party are to have a voice in the direction
of its affairs. In order to remove tempta
tion, all of the State officers have al
ready been distributed, and there Is noth
ing left to quarrel over. But the worm
has turned, and unless all signs fall there
will be the liveliest kind of a mix-up
within the next two weeks that the
Democratic party has ever Been.

keyed up to parade order yesterday. The
cui-asion was the monthly Inspection by
Colonel Soper. This Inspection took piftca
In the afternoon, and all of Its most
minute details were rigidly observed by
the colonel, who made a moet thorough
and complete Inspection. The regiment
waÃ found to be in excellent condition.
The First New York Regiment and the
corps of engineers were made happy yes
terday by a visit from the paymaster.
The men were paid for one month. The
paying off of these two commands would
indicate their early departure for Hono
lulu. In fact it may be authoritatively
stated that orders are daily expected for
the regiment and the corps of engineers
to get ready to so aboard the transport.
The two batteries of California Heavy
Artillery, and the Wyoming Alger Light
Battery, have been recently made happy
by the rumor put in circulation that these
two commands are to shortly be Sent to
Manila. .
No official orders have yet been issued
regarding this, but the artillerymen are

WORDS Of WISDOM.
THE commonest form of insanity known to poli
tics is thai Vs-hich impels its victim tq assume
tliat, by capturing a nominating convention, he
IS sure of election by the people. To this mania may
be attributed for the m^st part the mistakes of party
politics, and to hold it responsible for all of that ob
noxious species of political management called ''boss
ism," which is really leadership, is not unreasonable.
No aspirant for political honors need be blamed for
thinking himself the most popular man on earth and
the especial charge of Providence and the people;
but there never was any excuse for a political conven
tion assuming that a nomination won by fair means or
foul is equivalent to an election.
â¢/tinder the old ballot system control of the "works"
did. it is true, signify something. The political parties
placed in the hands of their followers a printed list of
candidates, and if their conventions interspersed the
list with a few strong men the effect on the voters was
favorable. In an effort to get the good men into office
the people usually voted the entire collection, "yel
low dogs" and all. But this system has become obso
lete. The Government at considerable expense now
places in the hands of voters an official ballot bearing
the names of all the candidates of all the parties. It
also supplies them with a rubber stamp and a private
booth in which to make their selections. It also for
bids the bosses to go near the booth, and provides
penalties for those who attempt to interfere with the
secrecy of the marking process.
? . tinder this system the form of political insanity to
which we refer ought to have disappeared long ago.
The. fact that it still prevails indicates that the politi
cians, like the Bourbons, are slow to learn.
However, there is no excuse for making further mis
takes. Republicans now understand the game that
.has heretofore been played upon them by the Demo
crats. While the former have been selecting candi
dates from the ranks of unpopular stalwarts or yield
ing to the demands of the friends of weak or "yellow
: ; :dqg" candidatesâ under the impassion that nomina
tions are equivalent to elections â the latter have been
putting forward their strong and popular men. As
the people vote most numerously for nominees in
whom they have confidence and with whom they are
acquainted, naturally under this practice the Demo
crats have been electing the greater number of men.
/This thing, however, should be stopped at once.
The Republicans must put forward from this on
their best candidates. In no other way can they per
manently wrest the State government from the con
trol of the Democracy. No further attention should
be paid to the personal demands of the "yellow dogs"
and their friends. It is no argument to declare that
"yellow dogs" are often good fellows, estimable citi
zens arid honest men. They cannot be elected and
th:it i^ sufficient. . :
â If.;* premium is put upon political reputation, which
is hound to result from the system of voting now in
vogue, the time will soon come when available and
impregnable candidates for every office in a State or
city will be as numerous in the Republican party as
fit"; in fly time. The breeding of popular Republican
politicians will become a regular industry, and the
Government will just as naturally fall into their hands
aJS; it now fall? out of the hands of the "yellow dogs"
with whom the party goes down to defeat at nearly
every election.
FOREST FIRES NOW RAGING.
DISPATCHES announcing the raging of forest
fires were received on Sunday from Santa
Cruz, Red Bluff, Salinas, Highland Springs,
Stockton and Los Angeles. It will be seen that al
most every section of the State is at this time suffer
ing from these conflagrations. The time is therefore
opportune for emphasizing the need of better forest
protection; By the damage that is now being wrought
in the Sate the people can learn the importance of
providing some legislation in that direction at the
next session of the Legislature.
The object lesson of the time is impressive not only
by the widely scattered areas of the State that are
being ravaged, but by the amount of destruction
caused at almost every point where the fires exist.
Thus it is reported from Santa Cruz that the fires
have bten burning in the woods of that county for
over two weeks. Hundreds of acres have been burned
over, and in some cases buildings as well as trees have
beer, destroyed.
from Red Bluff it is announced that several thou
sand :.cres in Shasta County have been swept by the
flames, which are so extensive that the whole of that
part of Sacramento Valley is clouded with smoke,
the Salinas reports stated that the fires in that sec
tion lu'.ve been extinguished, but not until they had
o\errun a wide stretch of country and inflicted heavy
losses upon the ranchers. At Highland Springs the
llamcs raged to such an extent that the summer hotel
at. that point -was in danger. Stockton dispatches say
that a chaparral fire terribly destructive swept across
tire foothills near Valley Springs, and at the time the
;4isjÂ»atCh was sent the flames were still spreading; with
a high wind blowing them forward.
The news from Los Angeles was to the effect that
the fifes in that portion of the State were surging over
the mountains west of Mount Lowe and in the vicinity
of Millard Canyon. Fortunately in that vicinity there
was aJjnost no wind, and it was believed the flames
y.ould soon be checked. The damage to timber and
gracing will, however, be great even if the fires go no
further.
It is not worth while attempting to estimate the
exact amount of the damage that has been caused by
these fiies.; That the amount will run far up into the
ihoAiu rids goes without saying. The loss to California
\.\ them alone will exceed the entire sum that would
be required to defray the cost of forest protection for
ia .year. The object lesson is before us. It remains
for tis to profit by it. The time has come for a prac
tical study of this problem so that an adequate remedy
may be devised for enactment by the Legislature next
: wtnief.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 2, 1898.
r~~* INCE the President and Embassador Camb&n
>^ of France, acting for Spain, have virtually
* â^agreed upon terms of peace it would seem that
the prospect of an early ending of the war is good:
.The of peace, it may be said, has been filled with
the tobacco of agreement, and now nothing is left to
Ibe done but to light it with the match of ratification
and pass it around for the smoking. It happens, how
ever, that the application of the match will have to be
made in this country by the Senate, and that fact will
give us pause.
We are to have a Senatorial peace talk as a pre
liminary to the ending of hostilities, and, having had
much experience with Senatorial war talks, we cannot
be very sanguine of a speedy ending of the coming
palaver. It is fairly certain that the Senators will de
bate the ratification syllable by syllable, and that w<i
shall hear much of the '"rat" before the final syllables
are adopted and peace established.
It the calling of the extra session to discuss the
treaty of peace can be postponed until Morgan of Ala
b?ma and Cullom of Illinois are away in Hawaii
something will be gained. Even then, however, there
will remain Mason and Foraker, Tillman and Chand
lc- and Lodge, likewise Allen ihe Populist; and last,
but not least, the verbose Vest. These mciv must
talk. It is their duty to uphold the prerogatives of the
Senate, and so far as those prerogatives assure the
right to unchecked streams of perfervid oratory, they
will fulfill that duty to the uttermost.
Our correspondent at Washington cheers us with
the announcement that it is believed at the capital the
Senators will make every effort to support the admin
istration, and will yield their own judgment as far as
possible rather than risk prolonging the war by re
jecting or so amending the treaty as to make it un
acceptable to the Spanish Government. In this
statement there is some encouragement to the hope
of an early peace, but the encouragement falls far
short of being an assurance. They will yield their
judgment, says our correspondent, "as far as pos
sible," but who can say how far that possibility- goes?
There are many Senators of many minds. In- addi
tion to the jingoes there are others. While the im
perialists would annex everything in sight there is
Wellington, who is opposed to annexing even a coal
ing station, and there is Hoar, who must always make
a speech on one side in order to emphasize his vote
on the other.
Finally the war question and the annexation of the
conquered colonies is going to be mixed up with party
politics, and the campaign is at hand. The peace
palaver, therefore, may be prolonged like a debate on
the tariff or the silver question. Meantime, however,
it is worth remembering there is always a saving
common sense in the Senate when public opinion be
gins to roar in rage at its long debates. That com
mon sense may occur at this juncture. The pipe of
peace is apparently rea<ly for use, and the Senators,
as soon as they are assembled, may get in at once and
smoke it. .
THE CALIFORNIAN WARSHIPS.
BY reason of the brilliancy of the feats accom
plished by the incomparable Oregon there has
been danger that she would attract public at
tention in the East to the exclusion of everything
else of merit on this coast. It is therefore gratifying
to note that the Eastern press has not wholly over
looked other records made by California since the
war broke out, but on the contrary has been dis
criminating and comprehensive as well as generous
in its praise.
The Chicago Times-Herald, for example, recently
directed the attention of its readers to the fact that
not only did the Oregon eclipse all sea-going per
formances of battleships, but that the .monitors Mon
terey and Monadnock have in their seven thousand
mile trip to reinforce Dewey at Manila broken all
records in their class. The Times-Herald very justly
says, "The Oregon's performance in its way was no
more surprising than the latter feat of sending two
heavy monitors from California to the Philippines."
Another phase of the subject of these record
breaking performances is noted by the Cincinnati
Commercial in making clear to the public the credit
due to the engineers of the vessels. In commenting
upon the successful accomplishment of the long voy
age of the Oregon around the Horn, and the.tre
mendous rush of speed by which she passed the other
ships of the fleet that were ahead of her when Cer
/era tried to escape from Santiago and made her way
to the forefront of the battle, the Commercial main
tains that the credit for the glory of tlie Oregon be
longs mainly to the engineers. It says:
''It was the men at the engines in this case and
not the men at the guns. The chief engineer was the
man. He knew his machinery as a man knows his
child, and he knew the capabilities of the magnifi
cent engines. We suspect that he had a head of steam
on that was risky, and maybe the safety valves had
an extra weight, but in this case he was going to
catch the Colon or lose his vessel in the attempt.
And he didn't lose his vessel, either, but the experi
ment was a success. If the hull of the Oregon had
been clean she would have run around the Colon."
All this praise from our Eastern contemporaries
is gratifying. We can forgive their bygone slurs upon
our State in consideration of the generous spirit
shown in recognizing the work achieved by California
for the nation in war. It goes without saying that
there will be less ignorant criticism of Pacific Coast
workmanship hereafter. Th . East has learned a les
son, and when we hold our Pacific Coast exposition
to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of our American
civilization we shall give a prominent place to the
models of the warships that not only did so much to
crush Spain, but helped to open the eyes of our own
countrymen.
It has been long since there has been such a tale
of corruption as is being unfolded by efforts to settle
the affairs of ex-Millionaire Hoolcy of London. Ap
parently the enterprising promoter had gone on the
theory that every person of title had his price, and
Kooley's mistake was in paying the price. The mat
ter ij. particularly interesting in view of the fact that
Rooley lately portrayed to the extent of several col
umns the beauties of the theory that honesty is the
best policy.
Senator Morgan does not believe the Spanish are
sincere in their clamor for peace. Sometimes the Sen
ator makes mistakes, but the present occasion does
not seem to be an instance.
When the soldiers under General Miles were under
going the experience of seasickness they were appar
ently learning the severest military hardships likely to
fall to them.
The New York palmist who reaped $120,000 out of

THE COMING PEACE TALK-
GRAND OPERA AND DRAMA
THE season of grand opera at the
Tlvoli opened last evening with the
production of Verdi's . masterpiece
"Aida.". it Was a success. The
reputations of the artists sufficed to fill â â 
the big opera house so that even stand-
Ing room was at a premium. The stag-
Ing was beautiful, the scenery being In
the Egyptian style, the characters taken
out of the misty past when the Pharaohs
ruled the country by the Nile.
Alda, daughter of Amonasro, King of
Ethiopia, is a prisoner in the hands of
the Egyptians and in Memphis is slave
to Amneris; the daughter of the ruler of
that people. Between the Ethiopian Prin
cess and Radames, a young captain in
the King's guard, a tender attachment
exists, which eventually causes the death
of the lovers by being burned alive, their
destruction being brought about through
the jealousy of the Egyptian Princess,
who also loves the captain.
The latter character is taken by Rhys
Thomas, whose fine tenor, good figure and
easy carriage made him a favorite from
the start. â¢
The principal part, Aida. is taken by j
Frl. Marie Brandis, whose excellent so
prano voice has a great range and shows
high cultivation. She won well-merited
applause and frequent recalls. Sig. Mau
rice de Vries, as Amonasro, was not given i
in the part he took a proper opportunity i
to show the range of his rich barytone.
One of the most trying and difficult char
acters was that assumed by Mary Linck '
the jealous Egyptian Princess, but her ef
forts showed that her contralto voice
ranks among the best in the country.
More than that, she is an actress of no
mean order and to her is due much of the
success of "Aida." This is her first ap
pearance here.
These vocalists are all recently from the
East, yet to one of the old Tiv.oli favorites
is due a word of praise. William H. West,
as the King of Egypt, did better w'jrk
than in comic opera, which he has been
singing for some time past with the Tivoli
stock company. Although not given a
part in which he could do justice to him
self, he demonstrated that his ability lies
in the more legitimate hnes of music For
a first night the opera ran with marked
smoothness, which Insures Its continued
success.
The Columbia.
"The Masked Ball,'* as presented by
the Frawley company at the Columbia
last night, is well calculated to promote
good hearty laughter and should be a
panacea for the blues. The subject is
fruitful of comical situations, the trans
lation from the French has preserved the
clean cut wit and brightness of the orig
inal lines and as the company is well
equipped for such work and individually
frtted their parts nicely the result was
a very enjoyable performance.
The ideas of the play were explained
in these columns on Sunday. Miss May
Buckley, as the loving young wife who
desired to punish her husband for prac
ticing deceit in securing her hand, again
displayed her ability to delightfully por"
tray a part of this kind. Edward Bell,
the jealous young husband; Eleanor Ca
rey as the aged, jealous and quarrelsome
wife; Sam Edwards in the character of
the henpecked husband, and Alfred Hick
man as the deceived and hopeless former
suitor, did due credit to their various
talents. Mr. Edwards, by reason of a
serious attack of tonsllltis, labored un
der difficulties, but gave a good account
of himself. By order of his physician he
will take, a temporary rest and his part
â will be assumed to-night by Mr. Burke.
The action dragged somewhat last even-
Ing, as is often the case on a first night,
ami the attendance was not what the
merits of the production deserved. How
â¢ever, "The Masked Ball" will doubtless
have a successful week.
Grand Opera House.
The "heather" was on fire at the Grand
Opera-house last night when the melo
drama, "Bonnie Scotland," by Sidney K.
Kilts, was presented for the first time In

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
There is quite a rivalry between the
Devonport, Chatham and Portsmouth
dockyards as to which one can turn out
ships quickest and cheapest. Devonport
la just now ahead, and the Admiralty has
sent a complimentary letter to the ad
miral superintendent with reference to
the Talbot, a 5600 ton sheathed cruiser
built at that yard. Her estimated cost
was $1,439,760. but she was built for $1,319,
595 while the Minerva, built at Chatham,
cost $1,369,185. and the Eclipse, at Ports
mouth, cost $1,377,725. They are identical
ships, and the time of building was two
years', four months and twenty-six days
for the Talbot; two years, eleven months
and twenty-seven days for the Eclipse,
and three years, one month and twenty
four days for the Minerva.
The British Admiralty has awarded $30,

the battle-ship Victorious when aground
near Port Said and succeeded in getting
the warship 'iff. Tin- Admiralty deslrod

to the owners of the Pectan, $2.'i00 to the
captain and $250(7 to the crew of the ship.
The Japanese iron-clad Fu-Soo. which
sunk last year off Nagasaki, was floated
July 5 and towed safely, to anchorage.
Captain Vriu, who was in command of
the ship when it sunk, was court- mar
tialed and sentenced to three months'
imprisonment, and it so happened that he
uas only liberated from prison on the
day previous to the raising of the ship.
Three warships were launched from the
Armstrong yard at Elswick, near New-
( â iiMl.-on-the-Tyne: A Japanese cruiser
on July 4, a Chilean training- ship on the
following day and another Japanese ar
mored cruiser on July 6. It is a very un

The Ocean, battle-ship of 12.050 tons, was
launched July 6 at the Devonport dock
yard, and on the same day the Amphl

lassie, and the other ladies had congenial
parts. Miss Sybil Camphor danec-d :he

charming grace.
The AlQazar.
Lewis Morrison, supported by Florence
Roberts and the Alcazar Theater Stock
Company, appeared last evening, in "'Sir
Edward Bulwer Lytton's poetical play, of :
"Richelieu." The performance was even:
throughout. Mr. Morrison gave a calm;
dispassionate reading of the tines that
fall to the lot of the statesman cardinal.
His acting was a bit too studied. In the
great scenes and situations he only par-
tially arose to the conventional heights
of his more famous predecessors. Hut the
large audience was more than pleased,
with his rendition of the part, and after
the famous "Curse of Rome," which
brings the fourth act to a close, he was
compelled to respond to the demands for
a speech. Miss Roberts iÂ» Â» pleasing
Julie. The other characters were un-.
usually well sustained, and the staging of
the play is above the overage.
Orpheum.
Not since the days of Dockstader or
Ezra Kendal has the Orpheum had such
a monologuist as James Thornton. He
is the champion song writer, and be: :
might enter the race for the laurels us
an ente-rtainer. His songs are peculiar to
Thornton in that they have an eyeii
cadence and swing- to them that makes
them catchy. "My Sweetheart Is the
Man in the Moon" and "It Don't Seem
Like the Same Old Smile" are samples of.
his style of work. His turn at the or
pheum is made up of songs and dialogue
and in either role Mr. Thornton is enter
taining. Valborn and Anthelmine have
evidently graduated from the operatic
stage to vaudeville for their work all
savors of the Italian opera style. They
are artists and on their merits were de
serving a much more demonstrative re
ception. They will no doubt grow in
favor. â¢
Gilbert and Goldie have a new act,,
quite as funny in its way as their turn
of last week. Joseph Hart and Carrie
de Mar are still favorites. Valmore is
the novelty feature. He. has some Tiew
imitations that are alone worth hearing.
The Macarte sisters on the high wire are
a pleasing feature. The Angela â â  sis
ters have a new repertoire and scoff.
a hit, particularly in their war song, but
in this line W. H. Windom and his Black
stone quartet have the call. â ""*â 'â¢â¢ "â¢'â '.':
Wilton and Stack seem to be doing tsveii
better work than on their first appear*,

they are artists in every sense of the

Olympia.
Bell and Dalton, Dutch knockabout
comedians, scored a great, hit at the Olym
pla Music Hall last night. They are very'
clever and stand an Incredible amount of
knockdowns and tumbles. Their dialÂ«guÂ«
is funny as well. Demarlo and Orlando
do sume clever work in the. dancirrg (in6j
and so do Charles and Mac Stanley,
though of a different variety. Maude
Rockwell, the soprano, has a m-w war
song that caught the house. She got
four recalls on it. Others on the bill are
Anita la Monte and the Royce sisters.

An electric launch built on the Isle of
Wlg;ht for the Russian Government was
tried last month. The boat is thirty-two
feet in length, eight feet beam and three
feet eight inches deep, and is built with
out frame, having a double skin. of mar
hogany planking. At seventy-two volts
pressure and a current of 120 amperes the
motor made 1000- revolutions . per minute, â¢â 
developing 11.4 horse power .and a. speed .
of seven knots. The boat .is capable, of
going four hours at seven- knots- and
eight hours with a speed of four' and
a half knots, making its radius twenty.-
eight knots at full speed arid thirty.-s.ix
knots under one-half power. Thr^i' bo&ta
of this kind have been ordered and will
be used oh the inland lakes in northern-
Russia. . .'â¢â¢â¢". .
Admiral Dalrj-mple Hay has written a.
racy article on the subject of names, of
ships. He tells of how an. officer was
twitted with the bad character of Go
liathâthe name of his shipâto which the
gallant captain replied.: ."What! Gulluth
not a great hero? Dld'he nptkill David?"
"v\"hen steamers were first Introduced in
the British navy the surveyor and the
first lord of the Admiralty wrangled ov^r
the selection of appropriate names,., and
the latter finally gave it up In despnir,
saying: "You may call them the devil.
if you like." The surveyor, took him at
his word, and named one the Keizebub
and the other Infernal. When the tim 6
arrived for launching the Government
had changed the Belzebub to Firebrand
arid the Infernal to Fair Rosamond.
Both ships proved themselves, very 'unC
lucky. â¢ â â â â¢" ; â  â  . ; ; ., â¢â

to possess the highest qualities sought to
be attained in a great battleshipâ* wide
practical radius of efficient action and
splendid fighting capabilities. Since these
results are not achieved by accident, but
reveal high technical ability, as well .. as
thoroughness and honest fidelity in the
countless, details of construction, I have
considered it proper to- address to you
this expression of the appreciation of the

UNION IRON WORKS,
San Francisco. July 26, IS9B.
Hon. John D. Long, Secretary of the
Navy, Washington, D. Câ Sir: On behalf
of the Unior^ Iron Works, and in its name,
I thank you cordially for your letter or
July 21, commending the performance of
the Oregon, and I beg to add that it has
been with great pride that we have looked
on her performance, not more as her
builders than we have as American citi-
American designed and American built,
she has offered a new lesson to older na
tions regarding the functions of a battle
ship, and we are proud in the fact that
under the most trying circumstances it
has been demonstrated to your satisfac
tion and approval that our contract has
been well and conscientiously performed.
Hut with all this, we believe that much
of the success of all vessels is based on
their intelligent handling by thefr skilled
officers, subordinates and men, without
which their usefulness would be greatly
impaired, if not wholly destroyed.
Next to the satisfaction enjoyed by us
over the performance of the Oregon comes
the gratification felt by us at the recog
nition so generously accorded to us by the
Department of the Navy and so courte
ously conveyed to us through your hon
ored self. Respectfully yuurs,
UNION IKON WORKS,
By H. T. SCOTT, President.
In the light of official and unofficial
reports of the ereat naval engagement
of July 3 near Santiago it appears that
the Oregon was foremost and most ef
fective In the fighting. Had the Oregon
been absent from the station at the
time Cervera's fleet sought to escape
the Cristobal Colon's dash would have
been successful and the Viscaya might
have eluded the Brooklyn. In his offi
cial report of the engagement Captain
Clark of the Oregon says of the Spanish
fleet:
As these vessels were so much more
heavily armored than the Brooklyn
they might have concentrated up
on her and overpowered her, and
consequently I am persuaded that
but for .the way the officers ana
men of the Oregon steamed and steered
the ship and fought and supplied her
batteries, the Colon and perhaps the Viz
caya would have escaped. Therefore, I
feel that they rendered meritorious ser
vice to the country, and while I cannot
mention the name of each officer and man
Individually I am going to append a list
of the officers with the stations that thny
occupied, hoping it may be of ser
vice to them should the claims of others
for advancement above them ever be con
sidered.

IT EXCEEDED
ITS JURISDICTION
BAILBOAD COMMISSION FXJK
THEB RESTRAINED.
Cannot Proceed Under the Robinson
Complaint â Case Continued Till
After Counsel Have Been
Advised.
A decision in relation to the application
of the Southern Pacific Company, and
other corporations, for a peremptory writ
of prohibition, to be directed to the Board
of Railroad Commissioners, compelling It
to refrain from taking further action in
the matter of the complaint filed with the
Board by John R. Robinson, was handed
down by Judge George H. Bahrs yester
day. Although the decision is not llnal,
the restraining order heretofore made on
the commission will be continued in force
until the further order of court,
The power of the court to prevent fur
ther procedure on the part of the commis
sion was invoked by a petition presented
by Collis P. Huntington, as a private citi
zen; Henry T. Scott and Charles E.
Green, as executors of the will of Charles
F. Crocker: the Southern Pacific Com
pany, Central Pacific Railroad Company,
Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
South Pacific Coast Railroad Company,
Pacific Improvement Company, Western
Development Company and the Market
Street Railway Company. In addition to
the petitionersâ two of them private cor
porations in no way engaged in the busi
ness of common carriers â Complainant
Robinson joined, as respondents, six pri
vate individuals, two private corporations
and Jane L. Stanford, as executrix of the
will of Leland Stanford, making In all
nineteen respondents, of whom but four
are engaged In the transportation of
freight and passengers.
The power of the Board, the court
holds, is, in the main, to establish rates
of charges for the transportation of pas
sengers and freight by railroad or other
transportation companies, and publish
the same from time to time with such
charges as they may make. !â¢ Rom this
central power all subsidiary pewera ra
diate "What then are such subsidiary
powers?"' reads the complaint:
Firstâ To examine books, records and papers
of all railroad and other transportation com
panies, and for this purpose they Khali have
power to issue subpenas and all other neces
sary process.
Second â To prescribe a uniform systpm of
accounts to be kept by all such corporations
and companies.
Thirdâ To hear and determine complaints
iiK^inst railroad and other transportation com
fiUil-K. to send for persona and papers, to ad
minister oaths, take testimony and punish for
contempt. In the same manner and to th>> same
extent as courts of record, and enforce their
decision* and correct abuses through the courts.
There are nineteen respondents, five
only being in any manner railroad or
transportation companies. For this rea
son, it is held, according to the Judicial
jurisdiction given the commission, the
complaint must stand or fall. and. pro
ceeding on this postulate, as the commis
sion refuses to dismiss the RobifiÃon com
plaint, the court is satisfied that the
complaint must fall. "No mattfr what
the hesitancy has been in the past, no
matter how "blind the way." states th<?
opinion, by a decision in what is known
as the Nebraska maximum rate case, a
broad and clear road has been based for
guidance, and. tested by that case, the
complaint must fall.
The court, in the decision, refuses |O
Interfere with any exercises of the legis
lative power of the commission and states
that after the complaint is filed, from
many objections, "the commission, with
its large powers, can quickly compel obe
dience to a lawful exercise of its powers.
Tne complaint and proceedings, while not
dismissed, in the mind of the court, can
not legally be determined by the com
mission, and in consequence it has ex
ceeded Its jurisdiction. Owing-, however,
to the fact that there is an answer on file
the restraining order will only continue in
force until the further order of curt, and
the matter will be continued for such fur
ther proceedings as counsel shall be ad
vlKexl are proper.

the first being the host. He has a
beautiful camp, bearing his name. The
party started out after 3 o'clock, and be
fore dark they landed 110 of the finest
rainbow and Dolly Varden trout that the
river affords. Mr. Morton had the pleas
ure of hooking a Dolly Varden that sealed
43i pounds, and Mr. Wuterhouse landed
mrite a number of the rainbow variety
that ran from 2to 2 1 i pounds. As the
stream is muddy the anglers had to aban
don fly fishing and use salmon roe for
bait. Mr. Waterhouse and several of his
guests will remain at the camp for a
week or so longer.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
j CHICAGO, Aug. I.â Wheat was depressed in
the first part of the session by the fine pro
; gress being made with the cutting of the spring
I â wheat and the commencement already of new
dtllvfiiÂ«.s of the new crop. Mlnnuipol's vt
i*?ive<i nine cars of new spring wheat, ar<l
there were about fifteen carloads of the <id ,
sold In the sample market here. ." The visible
eupply decreased 298.000 bushels, compared with
an. Increase of 1,782.000 bushels the corr^siv)!ii
ing week last year. Primary market receipts
: were still much below at the similar period of
laet year. Shorts grew nervous when thl* lie
cajne known and covered freely. It took a
strong corn market, however, to Infuse a lit
tle more buying spirit into the wheat crowd,
and getting that about an hour from the clow.
September, which had sold as low as tttHc,
recovered to 64% c about 15 minutes from '.he
end. September closed %c higher at b4"Â»@
64Hc asked. December gained %c, closing at
64@64*ic. ; Continuance of rains through rhe |
West where the drought had been feared start- ;
ed corn easy. The bullish ardor suffered in con- !
sequence and short sellers were emboldened to
Increase their lines. This in addition to a '
rather tame demand early forced prices oft.
Near the close of the session the decline was i
more, than recovered on Influential buying by j
bulls under the conviction that the rain would :
come too late to remedy the damage alr~.vsy I
done. . September closed with . a gain of ~jc.
Unfavorable crop reports accompanied with \
buying orders from the country caused the i
firmness in oats. - September closed %c better.
Provisions started easy on selling by pack
ers and ruled dull nearly all day. Toward the
end of the session prices recovered with a clos- i
ing rally In corn. Pork is unchanged, lard lost
2%@5c. and ribs are 2%c lower, than yesterday. :

JAPAN'S GOLD RESERVE.
The goH. reserve of the Bank of Ja
pan has been steadily decreasing dur
ing the past few months. The report of
the bank for the vreek ending June
4, however, shows an increase of
34,000 yen, which sum, together with
the amount in hand, constitutes a grross
total of 63,008,000 yen. This change
may be ascribed to the receipt of the
indemnity. In order to prevent any
sudden fluctuation In the market which
would take place should the indemnity
be brought home at once, the Nippon
Ginko has adopted a policy of gradual
transmission. Yet though the specie is
retained in London, there is no reason,
asserts the Malnichi, why it Bhould not
be indirectly utilized for the immediate
succor of the financial community. The
convertible notes issued up to the 4th
of June amounted to 172,360,000 yen,
showing a decrease of 111,700 yen as
compared with the previous week,
whereas the issue above the legal limit
totaled 26,870,000 yen. the decrease be
ing 260,000 yen. As to the loans issued
by the bank it may be stated that an
increase of 260,000 yen is noticeable in
discounted bills, of 2.720.000 y.^n in cash,
and of 2,010,000 yen in exchange bills,
these items together making a total of
4,000,000 yen. â Japan Daily Mail.

that the sack Is the 'most potent power
to break into th* columns of yellow jour

The truth is the Examiner accepts- as

Mrs. Stocker Testifies
for Mrs. Prescott.
MRS. S. C. SANFORD'S TEMPER
ONCE SAID IT MIGHT LEAD TO
DESPERATE RESULTS.
Much Bitter Hatred Shown to Exist
Amopg' Those Interested in
Little Darrell
Orth.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 1.
The entire afternoon was occupied in
Judge Hall's court with a further hear
ing Into the guardianship of Darrell Orth,
and a dozen or more witnesses testified to
the good reputation of Mrs. Lydia A.
Prescott, the child's guardian; among
them being Rev. M. Friedlander, Mrs.
Carrie Judd-Montgomery, J. T. Finn,
Mrs. Hammer, Officer H. McMurry of San
Francisco, W. B. Wheeler, Mrs. Ellen
WÂ«therbj . Colonel Irish, Frank J. Kane
of the Suppression of Vice Society, C. H.
Junes, Mrs. Alice Stocker, ex-Chief of
Police Lloyd, and others, and every one
testifk-il that such reputation was good.
Mrs. S. C. Sanford was also called, and
related at length her relations with Mrs.
Prescott. She said Mrs. Prescott had
taken a record book from her and had
refused to return it.
The sensation of the afternoon, how
ever, was the testimony of Mrs. Alice M.
Stocker. She testified that she was well
acquainted with both Mrs. Prescott. and
Mrs. Sanford and gave a sensational con
versation held between her and the lat
ter. ; :'Â» ;â¢
"It was on the morning of the last
annual election of the Suffragist Society,"
she said. '"^lrs. Prescott had been made
chairman of a campaign committee and
Mrs. Sanford said to me thai Mrs. Pres
cott had become very distasteful to her.
Mrs. ba.iiioitl had said that Mrs. Pres
cott had to be crushed and must leave
town.
"She said," continued the witness, "that
her bands were tied because of some
financial; business, and that if she came
out with the truth it would imperil her
position. She told me that Poundmaster
Wttzel had a case against her, but I
> asked hc-r to influence the man not to act
until after the election. Mrs. Sanford
said she was slow to anger, but when the
anger came she was like the devil, and
â  would not trust herself In the presence
of Mrs. Prescott: and that if she got rat
1 tied sometimes she would not be answer
able for her actions. 'I feel sometimes,'
said Mrs. Sanford, 'that at a certain
! stage of anger I could strangle Mrs.
! Prescott like a rat,' or words to that
effect.'
"I then told Mrs. Sanford that I would
rrlate our conversation to Mrs. Prescott,
:i!i.l .sin.' paid Bhe did not care." Mrs.
Stacker said that she had dearly loved
.-.lrs. Sur.ford up to this time.
Mrs. Sanford, who had been on the
stand sojne time previously, had em
phatically- denied having made any such
statements as Mrs. Stocker testified to.
"1 h-kve Jievt-r said that I felt like killing
her." said Mrs. Sanford, "and never tibia
any such "idea enter my head. I did say

that she ever eaid Mrs. Prescott ought
to be crushed. I meun to say that Mrs.
Prescott- is a lawless woman.
In answer , to -other questions she de
nied tHat she ever assisted those who
have been making life unpleasant for
Mrs Pr.escott. She had said that Mrs.
Prescott had become very abusive at
times, and on cross-examination testified
that this consisted In her pacing the
'floor of their office and crying. She had
heard Mr. Wendte. Judge Ogden and
Judge Frick express opinions of Mrs.
Prescott that were derogatory to her rep
utation.
Mrs. Prescott was subsequently called
to the stand again, testifying that the
!â¢ â â ' rd book that she carried off had been
giv.n heft by Mr. Theobold, a former sec
retary of the Humane Society: that she
had subsequently made entries in the
book which mado it improper to turn it
over to Mrs." Sanford. She also showed
by her testimony that when the child
I>'arrL-ll Orth had heen removed to New
Orleans sh.<> used every endeavor to se
cure his return, in which she succeeded,
and that since then she hns had the child
ut. her daughter's (Mrs. Alden) home at

the mother, had been paying without pro

WATER FAMINE
IS NOW OVER
The Call Forces the Ala
meda Company to
Terms.
A SUPPLY SOON AVAILABLE
IBBIGATION WILL NO LONGER
BE PREVENTED.
An Oakland Company Agrees to Sup
ply the Liquid Which Will En
able Berkeley Residents to
Water Their Lawns.
BERKELEY, Aug. I.â For all intents
and purposes the water famine, which has
sent nearly every lawn and garden in
Berkeley to waste, is practically over.
Within two weeks, or at the most three,
the town will be receiving a daily supply
of 200,'JiW gallons, which will amply suttice
for -sprinkling the streets, flushing the
sewers, and for turning all the withered
grass and shrubberey into their former
state of verdure. The appearance of
drought, which has seriously affected
sanitary conditions and brought real
estate interests to a standstill, will Quick
ly vanish, and the town regain its usual
look of prosperity and freshness.
Public sentiment, aroused by The Call,
and the prospect of losing all Its patrons
when the new municipal system is ef
fected, has at last forced the Alanieda
Water Company to come to terms. When
a famine seemed imminent two months
ago, Berkeley residents wondered why a
sufficient quantity of water could not In
purchased from either the Contra Costa
or Oakland company to make up the
deficiency. Superintendent Hall of the
local company denied that such a course
would be possible, and at once proceeded
to prohibit irrigation of any kind. A
committee of investigation, appointed by
the Board of Trustees, discovered, how
ever, that Superintendent Hall was mis
taken, and obtained written notices from
both Oakland companies saying that they
were willing and able to furnish any
amount of water necessary.
In the face of this the Alnmeda com
pany was forced to take action of some
kind. They opened negotiations with the
Contra Costa company, which resulted
In a contract being concluded to-day
This contract, signed by C. A. Grove and
Henry Pierce, provides that Berkeley
shall receive 200,000 gallons daily from the
Contra Costa mains, to be taken from
the pipes at the corner of Aahby and
Telegraph avenues.
In an Interview with a Call representa
tive to-day Superintendent Hall gave two
weeks as the time it will take to effect
the plans proposed. He said that Berke
ley would now have all the water neces
sary, provided only that the Contra Cos
ta company abided by its agreement.
When asked how irrigation would be af
fected he replied that the notice sent out
some two months ago forbidding the use
of water for any but sanitary and house
hold purposes would be withdrawn and
that no restriction would be placed upon
the consumption in any way whatever.
The news that Berkeley would soon be
relieved from any nnxiety over the. water
question was received with much satis
faction by all the residents in town.
VALUE OF THE LESSON.
Almost Certain That There
Will Never Be Another
Shortage.
BERKELEY, Aug. I.â Tt la expected
ttiat next Monday night the citizens' com
mittee engaged on a report regarding the
water supply of Berkeley will be prp- |
pared to present a plan to the Town Trus
tees that -will be feasible and economical.
During the past two weeks the committee,
which consists of Trustee L.. J. Le Conte,
Dr. Thomas Addison and School Director
E. F. Niehaus, have boen engaged in pre
paring pl&ns and forming Mttaaatea for
the purpose of discovering h<>w much re
liance can be placed on i. . rapply.
They are much encouraged b< tIM success
of Superintendent of Str-Â«ts (Suy 11.
Chick, who, in sinking w.Rh op th- City
Hall block, and in North Oakland and
West Oakland, has found plenty of wAter
to relieve the shortage that existed in the i
supply for street sprinkling. This whs re- |
garded as one Of the most objec
tionable features of the dearth, of water,
for Berkeley has been doing much street
improving Of late and to have ceased
sprinkling would have caused the ruin of
many thoroughfares.
The supply for the sprinkling is now all
that is desired, and the .streets are In good
condition. The ordinance introduced some \
weeks ago prohibiting irrigating lawns
and washing windows with hose and strni
lar practices was unanimously klll-ed by
the Trustees at their last meeting, on the I
ground that the Alameda. Water Com- i
pany, which supplies Berkeley, should be
In a position to give its patrons all the
water they require or else should enter
into a contract with the Oakland water
companies to supply it. The Trustees de
cidad that it was not 'within their Juris
diction to dictate to the consumers, but !
they decided that the water company
should deal directly with its patrons.
At the present time th,e residents have
voluntarily economized in the use of wa- ]
ter to Bucn an extent that the demand is ]
just about equal to the supply and the i
mains are always full, Insuring protection i
against fire.
The North Berkeley Jmprovement Asso
ciation is. taking the lead in the movement
to acauire a water plant by the town.
They have been officially informed by
Town Attorney H/anscom that Berkeley
can call an election and decide the propo
sition of bonding the town. The commit
tee now Investigating the matter, has at
its disposal $2500, which was appropriated
by the Town Board of Trustees' same
weeks ago to pursue its experiments and
prebare plans.
"The lesson of this last summer," said
Mr. Hanscom Jr. to-day, "will no doubt
prove of great value to Berkeley. While
the details of the scarcity of water have
no doubt been exaggerated it has opened
the eyes of the people to the fact that
the town is growing and that it is high
timo the water supply was attended to,
not only for the present, but for the fu-
ture.
"No one has suffered for lack of water
In bis house, although many of the lawns
have been neglected. We have never been
as some represented reduced to the plight
of refraining from taking a bath, and
since the Trustees sank wells to obtain
water for street sprinkling we have fared
pretty well.
"However, the fact tias been forced
home that Berkeley, needs a water supply
and everything now points to the con
clusion that we shall soon have one. The
Oakland companies do not feel like going
to the expense of piping all over Berke
ley, because as soon as the rains set In
the Alameda company's reservoirs north
of town and at Wildcat Creek will be re
plenished and the competition between the
companies will then De too acute to be
profitable."
In discussing the situation Town Trus
tee MaJoney said: "My position right
along has been that the Alameda Water
Company is playing the part of the dog
in the manger. It insists upon hrtving
the whole territory, while It has repeated
ly shown its inability oY unwillingness
to adequately supply even a paTt of It.
Berkeley is a town 6f many and extraor
dinary "attractions and a growing town.
It has outgrown the present resources of
the water Company which yet shows no
disposition to increase Its plant, and the
town must now take steps to prevent any
shortage of water In future years."
Trustee L. J. Le Conte is firmly of the
opinion that the only permanent relief
consists in the ownership of an adequate
â¢water plant by the town. As a member
of the committee he Is working on the
basis that the plan for a water pliant
should allow for an Increase of
1000 in the population each year. En
gineers have already located ample un
derpround supplies, and in the report
which the committee is now preparing
the cost of pumping stations, reservoirs
and a distributing system will be cov
ered practically and in detail. ,
ELOPED WITH
A POLICEMAN
Emma Lavelleand Offi
cer Murphy Wedded.
A ROMANTIC DENOUEMENT
OUTCOME OF AN ATTACHMENT
OF LONG STANDING.
The Hasty Marriage Came as a Sur
prise to the Members of the
Contracting- Parties'
Families.
"Then fly betimes, for only they con
quer love that run away," is the song
Police Officer Michael Murphy sang so
sweetly to pretty Emma Lavelle that she
left the home of her parents last Friday,
secretly, and linked her name and for
tunes with those of the stalwart guar
dian of the peace.
The attachment was one of long stand-
Ing, and, while the sudden denouement
was a severe shock to the family of the
groom, it created more indignation than
surprise in the home of the bride, ihe
young couple met for the first time some
three years since, the officer being on
duty in the vicinity of Miss Lavelle'fl
home, 2i)23 Pine street. Since that time
ho has been as devoted to her as a cav
a.ier of old. According to tfie girl's mo
ther hardly a day passed that they did
not meet.
Mrs. Lavelle accepts the situation phil
osophically.
"1 have been expecting something of
this kind for a lung time,'" she said yes
terday. "They met for the first time
some three years ago, and he has paid
my daughter most marked attention since
that time. She never confided in me as
to any formal engagement that existed
betv/een them and 1 was taken by sur
prise when she told me on Saturday
Horning that she was married and was
going to Sacramento on her honeymoon.
The first suspicion I had that matters
were nearing a climax w;ls when I, some
days since, taxed Emma with knowl
edge regarding the disappearance of
Mike's photographâ we always called him
'Mike'â from our family album. She
finally acknowledged that she had sent it
to be copied so that she could wear it in
miniature as a brooch for her neck.
"She was away all day Friday and I
have reason to believe that they went
across the bay and were married. She
left the house on Saturday murning after
giving me the information that she was
married. This is the first of my seven
children to leave me and I feel lonesome
without her. The couple are very much
attached to one another and I hope they
will be happy.
It is apparent that a reconciliation be
tween mother and daughter and son~ln
lp.w "Mike" can be readily effected by
the use of a little diplomacy.
Not bo in the Murphy home.
The fact of the marriage was not so
graciously accepted there. The son was
a contributor to the support of the fam
ily. The withdrawal of this is felt in
any instance and doubly so in the ranks
nf "the lowly. The members of the family
pleaded Ignorance yesterday of the step
taken by the son of the house, but in a
half-hearted manner, as though an Op
portunity was sought to gain time for
consideration of the matter. They, af
firmed that they had no knowledge of
Mr Murphy's movements other than that
he was away on his annual vacation. The
groom Is about 30 years of age and the
bride was 21 In May last.

A Victory for the City.
The suit of the city and county against
the Spring Valley Water Company and
Joseph Lawler for the recovery of what
is known as Franklin Square has been
amicably settled. The water company
waived all ripht. title or claim to any

to make a legai light. Law/er died some

given deeds to the city for the property

WOUNDED IN
MIMIC WARFARE
A Soldier Shot by a Care
less Sergeant.
USED A BALL CARTRIDGE
A SHAM BATTLE THAT WAS TOO
REALISTIC.
Private John Wayenbauer, Sixth
California Volunteers, Gets
a. Bullet in His
Leg.
- Private" John Wayenbouer, Company. H,
Sixth- California, was shot through the
left' leg yesterday .morning while partLci
pattrig'in a sham tattle on the Presidio
hills. He received his wound at theharids
of a -criminally careless sergeant of COm-.
peny D. .The sergeant's name : the- offi
cers of the regiment refuse .to divulge,
and every effort is being- made by them
to quiet the matter. : '
â  The. -oitHoe-rs of the regiment had -been
putXing their men through a hot iliam
battle. ' Company after, company had
fought its .Way across the rolling, foot
hills and. through the dense thickets of
the Presidio, and the mimic war had
taken on a decidedly realistic: aspect.'
Company I> h-ad won the top of a strate
gic-knoll and was 'there obliged to repel
a wild charge of Company 11. â  Excite-,
meht ran high and the din was well nigh
UL-^fenirig when out of the blowing smoke
and fog. came a yell of agony frorii one
of -the .assauftbrg party, and In the l-ull
that followed, -Wayehbauer was .found
writhing on 'the ground and bleeding from
a frightful wound- through the left hip.
â  The' investigation that followed dis
closed the fact that a' sergeant of Com
pany D.had come on tht: rield with a box
of ball cartridges and that one of these
was gone.
â  It was assumed tay his officers that in
the excitement 'of the assault he had
slipped from his" bo.x one of the ball ca-rt
:ri dees", and fired it. point blank into the
ranks of the- Oncoming 1 party.
â¢He. was immediately ordered to his
Quarters, where- he. will remain pending
further Investigation". Wayenbauer was
carried to the post hospital, where he will
probably i>ut In. .the next two or three
weeks-. .
A WARM FIGHT FOR
NEVADA'S SENATORSHIP
newlands mentioned as the
winning candidate.
Stewart Is Out for the Office and the
Political Contest Will Be a
Hot One.
Nevada politics has begun to seethe And
buil Over. . Francis . G. Newl&.n.ds,, it is
c. nrrally believed, -will be a candidate
for Senatorial honors tor the Silver State.
Newl&hds has not yet declared his inten
tions, but Stewart, who is soon to lpe in
San Francisco, has, and in very positive
terths. The. doubt will' soon be removed,
and in ;t short time it will be definitely
known whether Mr. Newlands is a can
didate for the Nevada Senatorship or not.
The .Legislature of Nevada meets nJBXt
January to elect a United Stat'-s Senator.
Senator Stewart's term expires In March
and a battle of money and political in
genuity may be expected before the Leg
islature decides upon the- person who is to
represent the State in the Senate for the
next six years. That Stewart will receive
a strong opposition is a conclusion whii-h
the politicians of the State seem to hu.ve
formulated some months, ago. If it is
not Xewiards it will be some other prom
inent political worker of Nevada. C. E.
Cleveland is the name mentioned as the
possible opponent to Stewart in the
event of Newlands' withdrawal fruin the
midst. of the Senatorial combat.
Should Newlands. .declare, himself a can
didate for the Senatofship he ' wfll of ne
â¢ be forced to sacrifice his chances
for rt--''l^ctinn as a representative <>f Ne
vada to Congress. The present aspect of
the .political situation of Nevada points
to a positive re-election of Newlands.
should he wish to return to Congress as
a representative- The greater honor Is
by DO n;<ans assured to him. Senator
gtewarf Is out to fight and as heretofore
h" will meet his opposition with a strong
front.
The unofficial announcement that New
lands intends to declare himself a candi
date, for the Senatorship hals heen a
source of surprise and wonder to Neva
dans. Both the present Senator and Con
gressman have worked harmoniously m
Washington and were always thf> Very
beet of friends. The Newlands advocates
say that Nevada needs new brood, that
at. least on?- Senator is wanted who is not
hoary with age and who will represent
the best interests of the State. The Stew
art faction hold up their idol as a man
full of experience and of proved ability.
Both men must n'-eessswily preach the
same political dogma of free silver to in
sure the least hope for success. It will
not be an issue of principles, but a per
sonal fight in which the popularity of the
opposing candidates will figure as an Im
portant element.
Mr. Newlands will not discuss the polit
ical conditions of his State. Ho simply
winks and waits for time to decide the
important political questions in which he
is primarily interested.

California Regiment will very likely soon
have a chance to fo to the front in the
Philippines.
Although the Eighth California is one
of the most recently organized regiments
it is by no means made up of inexperi
enced men. It Is mainly composed of
National Guardsmen who have seen sev
eral years' military service. It iH con
ceded that this rofriirent has within Its
ranfcs the very best material in this
State. The men are all robust and in
splendid health. In fact, it would bÂ© dif
ficult to find anywhere a military organ
ization that contains so many perfect
Biieclmcns of physical manhood. The reg
iment is well equipped and efficiently
drilled and is In every respect prepared
to take the field for active service at an
hour's notice and every man is anxious
to do bo.
At a meeting of influential citizens yes
terday afternoon a. dispatch was formu
lated setting forth all the above facts
and sent to Secretary of War Alger re
questing him to give the Eighth Califor
nia an early opportunity to go to the
Philippines. Similar telegrams have been
sent to Secretary Alger by x.rominent
niÂ»n In various parts of the State and a
favorable reply is expected to-day. It is
quite likely, therefore, that the Eighth
California willsoon bo on its way to the
Philippines. '

The Utah Light Artillery, which ar
rived at Oakland at 9:30 last night, will
come over to San Francisco early this
morning and go into camp at the Pre
sidio. Although coming with almost no
equipment, they will find everything- in
readiness for them, as the quartermas
ter's department yesterday sent to the
Presidio a full supply of tentage and
other outflttlngs.
THE SAN FH AN CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 2, 1898.
THE UNLUCKY
NUMBER "13."
Cold-Hunters Laughed
at the Fiction.
ONE OF THEM WAS DROWNED
WASHED OVERBOARD DURING
A HURRICANE.
R. Dutton Has Lost All Faith in the
Efficacy of a Rabbit's Foot
to Bring Him Good
Luck.
That unlucky number 13.
It had and has no terrors for the mem
bers of the Commonwealth Mining Com
pany of Boston, and yet they incorporated
A GALE IN THE GULF STREAM.
The Schooner Reub. L Richardson While on Her Way to San Francisco Ran Into Her First Storm
When Nine Days Out From Boston. P. Bengsten, One of the Gold-Hunters, Was Washed
Overboard, and As He Was Weighted Down With His Oil Clothes' and Rubber Boots and
Weak From Seasickness, -.He Soon Sank. The Vessel Was Under a Double Reefed Foresail
and Running Eight Knots an Hour Before the Storm, So Nothing Could Be Done for Him.
on the 13th, bought a schooner thirteen
years old and thirteen of them started
for the Klondike on the 13th, of the
rrionth. During the voyape they killed
thirteen albatrosses and caught thirtc ;i
bonita, brut the tb.irtoen.th member of the
party never reached San Francisco* Nine
days out from Boston he was washed
overboard during a galo and his com
panion could do nothing toward saving
him. One moment they saw him on the
crÂ«-Kt of a wave and the noxt he was ;
gone. Still they are full of hope and â¢
every man of them expects to make a
fortune in the frozen north.
They are a splendid set of men, the^e
members of the Commonwealth Mining
Company. Every one of them is pre
pared for rough times and the harder the
work the better they will like it. There
are no kid glove miners a-mong them and
yet each one has a fair share of this
world's goods and none of them will be
broke if their venture on the Yukon fails.
On February 18 last the schooner Reub
L. Klchurdson sailed from Boston with
4,he following gold hunters aboard â mem
bers of tho Commonwealth Mining Com
pany: Captain T. Murphy, Carl I-. John
eon, H. L. Ewell, O. C. Grant. F. E.
Niekerson, Howard Coleman, C. R. Baker.
Olaf Kollson, Michael Carey, George G.
Dow, A. H. Bryant, James Murphy and
P. Bengsten. From the time the schooner
left port rough weather waa encountered
and on February '12 it was blowing; a liv
ing gale. The vessel was put before It
under a double reefed foresail, but even
under that "rag" she was logging eight
knots an hour.
About 10 a. in. some of the men came
on deck to get a breath of fresh air,
nearly all having been seasick since leav
ing Boston. Among th<m was Nellson,
Ewell and Bengsten. They all sat down
aft, Bengsten being nearest the rail. A
heavy sea broke aboard and rushing aft
washed all three men into the scuppers.
Neilaon and Ewell managed to get hold
of something and hold on, but another
wave came along and washed Bengsten
overboard. He had his rubber boots and
oilskins on beside being weak from the
seasickness so his chances were very
poor. The only boats aboard were dories
and whllo they would have lived In the
sea that wa.s running they would have
been worse than useless owing to the
rapidity with which they would have,
been driven to leeward. The captain
dared not put the schooner about for fear
of foundering, so poor Bengsten had to
be left to his fate. He was In business
in Lvnn, Mass., but sold out and Joined
the Commonwealth Mining Company ex
pedition. He was aboat 30 years old. and
unmarried.
The gold hunters of the Reub L,. Rich
ardson' have quite a -number of memen
toes of their voyage, aboard. There are
sharks' fins, albatross skins feet of
Mother Carey's chickens, a big turtle
6hell and a pair of carrier pigeons that
came around the Horn on the schooner.
"We had four pigeons aboard when we
left Boston," said A. H. Bryant, secre
tary 1 of the company... yesterday. "When
we got into the gulf stream we let two
of them .go, but they never reached home.
The other pair we named Bill and Topsy,
and as we were too far out at sea to
risk another message with them they re
mained aboard and have the honor of be
ine the first carrier pigeons that have
ever come around the Horn from Boston
to San Francisco.
"During all the month of April we, were
off the River Platte and had a terrible
time of it. The distance we would make
one day wÂ© would lose the next and bad
luck did not forsake us until Mayday. On
June 6 and 7 the glass was down to 28.80
and it blew a hurricane. We were hove
to forty-eight hours and had it not been
for the oil bags we put over the sidf-t;
I dr. not know what we would have done.
With a hook and line we caught both
albatross and bonita. One day we saw a
big turtle floating in the water and the
cook determined to catch it. He let out
a line with a big hook op the end and
luckily he hooked the turWe. The sudden
plunge it gave nearly took him overboard,
but he held on and we soon got tho gen
tleman alongside. It took five of us to
get him aboard and maybe that turtle
soup didn't taste good."
The Richardson has in her hold a 50
foot ate: m launch in sections. When St.
Michael is reached the gold-hunters will
proceed on up the Yukon in the launch
after the launch has been put together.
They have also seven dories with them
with which they will prospect the differ
ent creeks that empty into the rlv<r.
All their supplies will be purchased here
and every man will he thoroughly fitted
out for a winter in the frozen north. In
spite of that unlucky thirteen it is safe
to say that if success is to be achieved
on the Klondike the members of the
Commonwealth Mining Company of Bos
ton will succeed.
R. Dutton. a teamster, picked up soma
body's luck yesterday and now he wishes
he hadn't, button is a strapping young
fellow who ha? never met with an acci
dent or had a day's sickness in his life.
Yf-stertiay morning while on his way to
work he picked up a rabbit's foot and
was highly elated over his find. He put I
it in his â¢ pocket and visions of . all the
good things that 'were in store for him
floated through his mind. '.Two hours
later he" was on the operating table in
the Harbor Receiving Hospital with a
strained 'back. While - handling some
goods on "Vallelfo-street -wharf he- gave a
sudden wrench to his 'spine that will keep
him in. bed for- many months, to come.
, As soon as- I)utt,on was clear of the
doctors he put his hand in his pocket and
drew forth the rabbit's foot. He looked
at It for a moment and, paid: . "N. won
der your former owner lost you. If that's
the kind of luck you bring tnÂ« sooner
you're out of the way the better." With
that â¢ he ' threw the foot out of the open
window into the bay, but before it sank
a seagull swooped down and swallowed
it. Duttorc says he will follow the career
of that gull with interest.
The American -ship Kennebec arrived
from Baltimore yesterday after an un
usually long voyage of 202 days:. Captain
Lewi? blames, light winds and -calms for
the long passage. - â  i â  â  . ' â¢â¢
' The British ship ' King David, 83 -days
from Newcastle, N. S. W., and the Ger
man bark Marco Polo,' 'l6l days from \ Si
cily, also got in yesterday." The King
David is here on her maiden voyage and
Is In command of Captain Jones,- who was
last here in the Dolbarden Castle.
Captain Jones superintended the build
ing of the King David and is very proud
of his ship. . At the outset of her voy
age the Marco Polo had a hard time of
it. On February" 25. she was 'caught in a
gale, during which the water casks broke
adrift and the pigsty was washed over
board.
- Walter Daggett, an assistant steward
on the river steamer H. J. Corcoran, fell
overboard during Sunday night's trip
down the river. A boat was lowered; and
he was saved* without much difficulty.
The steamer Humboldt arrived from St.
