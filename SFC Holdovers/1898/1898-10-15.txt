THE LIZARD
Steamer Mohegan Goes
Ashore Off the Coast
of England.
Only Thirty-One Saved Out of the
Two Hundred Souls Aboard
the 111-Fated Vessel.
LONDON, (Jet. 14. â The Atlantic Transport Company's
steamer Mohegan, formerly the Cleopatra, of the Wilson
& Ftimess-Leyland line, which left London for New York yes
terday with fifty passengers and a crew of 150, is ashore off The
Lizard, between the Manacles and the Lowlands.
A coastguard message reports that the passengers "are
drowning" like rats."'
Another account says: '"Bodies ure washing ashore, one
being that of a lady, lashed to a plank, with both legs severed."
Particulars of the disaster are difficult to obtain.
It appears that when the Mohegan struck a gale was blow
ing and the sea was running high.
Lifeboats put oil from the Lizard and from Falmouth, one
returning- filled with passengers. Several were drowned, how
ever, it is reported, on the passage of the lifeboat to shore.
Another lifeboat saved six persons.
The coast at this point is extremely dangerous, and has
been the scene of numerous wrecks. Some years ago there was
a movement on foot to get a lightship placed here, but it
failed.
A dispatch from Falmouth says the Mohegan was probably
blown ashore by the heavy east wind after her machinery was
disabled.
All the Falmouth tugs went out, but none was able to ap
proach the vessel.
A lifeboat has landed thirty of the Mohegan's passengers
and returned for more. One lady died after she was brought
ashore.
According to a dispatch received at 3 a. m. from Falmouth,
out of 200 persons constituting the passengers and crew of the
Mohegan, only thirty-one have been saved.
This intelligence was confirmed by a telephone message
from the coast guard to Falmouth.
The coast guards are watching for bodies and wreckage.
The lifeboats have gone into Port Houstock.

the immense deposits of gold bearing ore.
C. C. Black, Just back from Peace

E. Malcolm Garnett
Arrested.
PERSECUTED ETHEL RODGERS
SOUGHT THE HAND OF WALTER
HOBART'S COUSIN.
Challenged the Young Millionaire to
a Duel, and Now Must Stand
Examination as to
His Sanity.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 14.â A sensation
was sprung here to-day by two detec
tives of Harry Morse's detective
agency arresting E. Malcolm Garnett,
son of Louis A. Garnett, the well
known mining operator, on a charge of
disturbing the peace. The real cause
of the arrest is that Garnett for months
past has been greatly annoying Miss
Ethel Rodgers, a cousin of Walter S.
Hobart, by writing to her letters of an
exceedingly amorous nature and en
deavoring to Beck a personal meeting.
It is declared that the young man is
mentally unsound.
About three months ago Garnett .first
saw the beautiful Miss Rodgers at a
party given by prominent society peo
ple In San Francisco. He became at
once a sufferer from Cupid's pranks
and sent the young lady a letter attest
ing his undying admiration. No atten
tion was paid to this, and a few days
later another letter came, urging that
the lovesick swain be permitted to pre
sent himself and be introduced.
Later Garnett came to San Rafael and
sought admittance to Captain Wil
liams' house, on Sixth avenue and E
street, where Miss Rodgers has been
residing with Mrs. Lester, Mr. Hobart's
sister, and Miss Juliet Williams, a sis
ter-in-law. He was told nobody was at
home and went away.
Since that time the young lady has
received a!bout fifty letters and Gar
nett has called at the Williams house a
dozen times, only to be denied admit
tance on all occasions.
Finally Walter Hobart went to see the
\ father, Louis A. Garnett, who resides /
on the corner of Essex and Turk
streets, San Francisco, and informed
him of his son's peculiar actions. The
father pleaded earnestly with his boy
to abandon his reprehensible conduct,
but all to no purpose.
A few weeks ago Mr. Hobart re
ceived a letter from Garnett begging
for an introduction to his inamorata,
and proudly boasting of his own flaw
less character and the prominent posi
tion occupied in society by his rela
tives.
A caustic reply caused the desperate
swain to take another tack. He wrote
a letter challenging: Mr. Hobart to a
duel. On the front page of this epistle
was drawn a crude picture of an exe
cutioner in the act of beheading a man
with a broadax.

ARREST OF
NINE ITOLION
ANARCHISTS

Cairo.
Conspirators Being Compelled to
Change the Scheme, Shipped
Deadly Bombs to Port Said.
Special Dispatch to The Call
A LEXANDRIA, Egypt, Oct. 14.â The Alexandria police
f-\ have arrested nine Italian anarchists since last night, and
have thereby frustrated a plot against Emperor William,
now on his way to the Holy Land to be present at the conse
cration of the Church of the Savior at Jerusalem.
The first to be arrested is a cafekeeper, a well-known an
archist, in whose house the police discovered two wire-bound
bombs of great strength, full of bullets.
This arrest was made in consequence of the notification
from the Italian Consul General at Cairo that two anarchists had
left Cairo for Port Said.
The police investigation showed that the arrested cafekeeper
had bribed the steward of a steamer sailing to-day from Alex
andria to Port Said and Syria to take on board a box of bombs.
Apparently the anarchists originally intended to use the bombs
at the Palais Abidin, at Cairo, while Emperor William and the
Khedive were there.
When the Kaiser decided not to visit Egypt, the anarchists
changed their plans and decided to attack him in Palestine.
The liveliest satisfaction is felt over the smart captures, and
the German consulate has expressed its warmest thanks. The
two Cairo anarchists who left for Port Said have not yet been
arrested.
This was enough for Mr. Hobart. He
consulted with Harry Morse and Detec
tive Cleary was detailed to keep a
watch on Garnett. To-day the latter
came to San Rafael and was walking
around the Williams grounds, after
having been denied admittance to the
house, when he was arrested by Cleary
and Constable Louis Hughes and
charged with disturbing the peace. He
was taken to the Courthouse, and, after
close questioning, placed in confine
ment.
Garnett seems to be unquestionably
Insane. He admitted having written
the letters to Miss Rodgers, Miss Wil
liams and Mrs. L<ester, asking for an
Introduction to the former young lady.
He said he would not have come to
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
San Rafael at all, but that Mrs. Lester
had telephoned to him to come. He was
granted permission to write a letter and
scribbled one to Miss Williams as fol
lows :
"My Dear Miss Williams: This con
finement is very disagreeable. If it is
desirable, I wish you would explain
matters, as it is all a joke."
The man claimed acquaintance with
nearly every celebrity Jn the country,
including the late Ward McAllister,
Ned Greenway and Charles Page, the
capitalist. He said the latter would
go his bail.
At 3 o'clock to-morrow afternoon
Garnett will be examined by Drs.
Wickman and Jones, in the presence
of Superior Judge F. M. Angellotti, as
to his sanity. He dresses very neatly
and wears his mustache in a peculiar
fashion, with both tips waxed and
pointing straight forward from the
face.
Louis A. Garnett, the father, former
lyfwas in the mining business, and was
at one time a wealthy man. The fam
ily moves in the best circles of society
and the arrested son is a college grad
uate.
STATUS OF THE FIRST
NATIONAL BANK OF HAWAII
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â The organiz
ers of the First National Bank oÂ£ Ha
waii, Honolulu, of which the Anglo-Cali
fornian Bank of San Francisco is a large
stockholder, have wired here to ascer
tain what further steps are necessary to
perfect the organization of the bank. The
inquiry is based on the supposition that
the terms of the annexation of the islands
having to await the action of Congress
the status of the Government in Hawaii
may be in doubt. The question has been,
mooted not through any fear as to an
ultimate favorable decision, but is rather
prompted by natural precautions taken
by men engaging in vast business enter
prises. In the absence of Attorney Gen
eral Griggs it will be Impossible to secure
a formal opinion until next week, when
he will return to Washington. However,
the Assistant Attorney General and thÂ©
Solicitor for the Department of Justice
have both passed informally upon the
question of government now in force in
Hawaii. It Is held that territorial power*
Of the United States are not extended
over the islands, and that our Federal
laws are In full force and effect. The
Solicitor of the Department of Justice
further holds that native-born Hawaiian*
can be directors in the newly organized
bank.

PAX JOSE, Oct. 14.â Both sides in^Jie
Jannan-Rea (25,000 Blander Buit r<
this afternoon, arid argument before
the jury will co Tuesday
more . testimony
to-day was in behalf of Jarman.
Jacob Lenzen, an architect, was put
on the Btand this morning to rebut
the t of Jarman that the
tiff had received the painting of
the Rhinehart flats in competition and
not for his vote in the Council on the
the fire limits. Witness said
lie w ising architect of the
Rhini s. Mrs. de Wii and L. P.
Kraft, trustees of the Rhinehart es
tate, had spoken 10 him about the
painting of the buildings, and had toid
him that Jarman was tv be given the
painting, lit- said S. P. Hatcher, agent
of the property, had told him the same
thing. Owing to the terms of the will
of Mrs. Rhinehart creatin? the trust,
the work had to be don- ract,
and it was arranged thai in was
to have the work. Arraj tta had
been left to the witness aha Che work
â was given to Jarman. L. P. Craft, a
trustee, had also told him Jarman was
to have the work.
Under cross-examination Lenzen
told an entirely different story and
proved an excellent witness for Jar
man. He admitted that he had built
the City Hail, Agnews Asylum, Hall of
nd new High School, and had
had a hand in every big job given out
by the gang in the city and county for
the past fifteen years. Lenzen testi
fied he had frequently defrauded con
tractors who had figured on work he
was supervising by not giving it to
the lowest bidder. He had practiced
such favoritism many times.
Lenzen said bids were received for
paintiiiu the Rhiriehart flats from Car
rier, Baird and Jarman, and Jarman's
was the lowest. The plaintiff was to
have the work anyhow, but it was to
ar that he was the lowest bidder
and have his own price afterward.
Witness had arrang-d to do this. He
had before perpetrated the same kinu.
of a fraud upon contractors who fig
ured on work, and did not consider it
a fraud. He thought it perfectly legal.
Witness did not do this at all times,
but he liked to see his friends get the
work. He refused to tell how he'ma
'nipulated such things, but thought
Birch work perfectly honest tran
sactions. He finally admitted Jarman'?
bid for the work was the lowest and
plaintiff had performed the work ac
cording to specifications. Jarman had
done first-class work and had earned
every dollar he had received. Plain
tiff was entitled to the work, and even
with some extra work he had done his
bill was lower than that of the other
bidders. Jarman's work was satisfac
tory and honestly done. Lenzen said
he "had remodeled the Rea building a
few months ago and secured the work
at the instance of Boss Rea.
S. P. Hatcher, a real estate and in
surance agent, said he was the agent
of the Rhinehart property and had car
ri.-d the insurance on the buildings
burned. Some time after the fire Mrs.
Harper and Mrs. de Wit told witness
they had been before the ordinance
committee of the Council to get per
mission to rebuild the buildings of
wood. They had been unsuccessful and
i witness 4 o try and secure a modi
fication of the fire limits. He had seen
Boss Rea and asked him to use his in
fluence in the matter. L. P. Kraft,
another trustee of the estate, had also
asked witness to take an interest in the
matter. He said he had reported to
Kraft in the presence of Mrs. de Wit
or Mrs. Harper that Rea told him Jar
man would favor a change of the fire
limits and it would pass if Jarman was
given the painting without competition
of the buildings to be erected. He also
told Kraft what Rea had told him.
On cross-examination Hatcher said
the reason he â went to Rea and asked
him to lend his aid and influence in
having ihe fire limits changed was be
cause Rea had "worked in politics" for
years. JHe knew Rea had good friends
in the Council and could interest th^m
In the matter. He did not think Rea's
proposition that Jarman be given the
painting was just exactly right. It was
not proper, but witness would not say
whether it was dishonest or not.
I:<J not consider it a bribe for
a Councilman's vote. The matter was
fail and honest as far as he was con
cerned, and he had only interested him
n the matter out of friendship for
the Rhinehart family.
Attorney Delmaa recalled Mrs. Harry
Harper to contradict the testimony of
Lenzen and Hatcher. Her testimony
was strong and convincing. Mrs. Har
per testified she was a trustee of the
Rhinehart estate. She had never spoken
to Hatcher about having the fire limits
changed so their flats could be rebuilt
of wood. He was not an agent for the
and was simply agent of
a company that carried the ' in
surance on the buildings. She
had been before a committee of
the Council and asked permission to
rebuild of wood, but this was denied
because a large proportion of the build
ings had been destroyed. Later the
Council changed the fire limits. The
trustees hai never asked Hatcher to
gee Rea about having the limits
changed, and she had never heard
Hatcher make such a statement to
Kraft. Never even knew Rea had been
considered. She was equally as posi
tive in her denial of orders having been
given to Lenzen to give Jarman the
painting. The painting had been let in
competition and Jarman was the lowest
bidder.
Mrs. He Wit. another trustee of the
Rhinehart estate, ga#ve similar testi
mony. She denied the statements made
by Hatcher and Lenzen that Jarman
was to be given the painting of the
building without competition for his
vote in the Council on the change of the
fire limits. Hatcher had no authority
to go to (lea for his influence with
Coun.^ilnu n and she had never heard
Hatcher tell Kraft he had fixed the
rna'.i.-r up.
Attorney Delmas then said that that
finished his case. The defense also
made the same announcement.
The attorneys were then Instructed to
prepare instructions to the Jury.
An adjournment was taken until
Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock, when
argument before the Juxy will com.
niepce.

The Coroner's jury heard a large

JVarrants were sworn out to-day be

however, caused Colonel Young to re

he thought they might be needed as

ALTON OFFICIALS
GREATLY ENRAGED
CHICAGO, Oct. 14.â Complications
which threaten to assume greater pro
portions than the clash between Fed
eral and State authority during the
railway strike under Altgeld's admin
istration promise to grow out of Gov
ernor Tanner's seizure of the Alton
railroad at Virden. General Solicitor
Brown of the Chicago and Alton left for
Springfield to-day as the result of a
conference between the officials of the
road. Solicitor Brown will assume
charge of the situation at Virden so far
as the Alton is concerned. Steps will
be taken likewise by the Alton to secure
legal redress for Governor Tanner's ac
tion in refusing to allow the Alton road
to unload negro miners at Virden. The
officials of the Alton make no attempt
to conceal their anger and cast blame
upon the Governor for interfering with
a common carrier which has authority
to operate as such under State laws.
The officials of the Alton claim that
one of the most sacred prerogatives of
a common carrier was outraged, and
they express their determination to rind
out if the Governor of the State can
"exercise lawless force," as they term
it, without being called to account.
Vice President and General Manager
Chappell of the Alton road called the
general solicitor and other officers to
a conference to-day. The conference
lasted only a few minutes, and at its
conclusion Solicitor Bi-own cleared up
his correspondence and departed for
Springfield.
"Lawless force covers the entire sit
uation," said Mr. Brown. "The Gov
ernor has absolutely no right to pre
vent this road taking its passengers to
where -they are ticketed. It is an un
heard of thing, and nothing can be
found in the laws of tne State to jus
tify the conduct of the Governor. We
can take passengers, whether colored
jor white, from Alabama or from any
] other State and carry them to any dcs
! tination upon our line. It does not mat
j ter if they came under guard. We do
I not recognize the fuards as such, but
!as passengers. Even if they did carry
pun?, we have nothing to do but to take
| them to where they are destined so
â  long as they keep their guns out of
j sight. Our course in this matter is
! plain."
"Will the road institute legal pro
ceedings at once?"
"We will not take legal steps now,"
he answered. "I shall not talk for pub-
I llcation about my mission to Spring
! field. Next week there will be some
thing to tell. I cannot say any more
now."

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 14.â The Presidential
train came into St. Louis soon after 9
o'clock this morning. About an hour
before Just as the flyer was speeding
across the Missouri River, the President
breakfasted.
At Spanish Lake, about fifteen miles
from here, a reception committee of
thirty citizens of St. Louis boarded the
train to welcome the President. Among
them were Governor Stephens, ex-Gov
ernor Francis and Mayor Ziegenhelm.
Mr. McKinley walked through the car
where the members of the mmittee
were seated, and gave to each one a
warm personal greeting.
The President looks very tire after
the trying o: " :al of the last four days.
He said to General Shafter at Gales
burg, when the general inquired about
his health: "Well, general, I am wear

door speaking, but I am standing it
very well under the circumstances, 1

At Union Station, when the Presiden

was a terrific jam, every bit of avail
able space in the immense midway be
ing filled with an enthusiastic crowd of
people anxious to see the chief execu

The members of the general recep
tion committee, who had preceded the
Presidential train on a Burlington spe-.
cial, lined up, and when President Mc-
Kinley stepped from his car he was
immediately escorted by them to the
Twentieth-street entrance of the Union

wheeled into Market street the veter
ans of Santiago presented arms and the
immense throng that lined both sides
of that thoroughfare broke into cheers.
Hats and handkerchiefs were waved,
and the President was kept busy re
sponding to the noisy welcome. Car
riages containing other members of the
Presidential party and the reception
committee fell in behind that of Mr.
McKinley. The parade then moved east
on Market street, passing east over
the principal streets of the city to the
Southern Hotal.
After the review the President met
the members of the various committees
in the hotel parlors. This over the
doors were thrown open and the gen
eral public was tiven an opportunity to
pass, before the chief executive.
At noon the President spoke to 15,000
people in the hall ' the Merchants'
Exchange, the room in which Samuel J.
Tilden was nominated for President in
1876.
Five full minutes of applause fol
lowed the President's address, mingled
with cries of "Hurrah for Mac," and
"Three cheera tor McKinley."
From the Merchants' Exchange the
President returned to the Southern Ho
tel, where he had luncheon. This after
noon the Presidential party took a drive
through the western section of the city.
The carriages were occupied as in the
morning parade, but they were only ac
companied by a squad of mounted po
lice. Several stops were made en route.
Among the places visited were the St.
Louis High School and Institute. To
night there was a general reception
at the Coliseum in the Exposition
building, where Mr. McKinley made an
address.
The largest crowd under cover that
the President has come in contact with
during his present trip gathered at the
Coliseum to-night to hear his address.
Probably twenty thousand people were
inside the building when the address
was delivered, and twice as many more
were unable to get anywhere within
the sound of his voice. The President
was escorted to the Coliseum by the
president and directors of the exposi
tion. Mr. McKinley walked to the big
stage in the center of the building
while the people filled the air with ter
rific applause and Sousa's bajid played
"Hail to the Chief."
After a short address of welcome by-
President Sampson President McKinley
was presented.
The address of the President was re
ceived by his 20,000 auditors with the
wildest cheers, and at its conclusion
the demonstration was simply inde
scribable. For a short time the Presi
dent then viewed the sights of the St.
Louis Exposition, after which he left
for the train. The departure from the
city was made at 11 o'clock over the
Vandalia road.

SUICIDE WHO HAD
"NO KICK COMING"
Remarkable Letter Left
by Joseph Fleis.
THOUGHT HIMSELF "NO GOOD"
WANTED NO FUNERAL AND NO
GRAVESTONE.
Bequeathed What Little Money He
Had to a Santa Cruz Church
and His Effects to His
Landlord.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 14.â A remarka
ble letter is that left by Joseph Fleis, a
suicide -who was buried to-day from a
local undertaking establishment. Rev.
R. L. McHatton, pastor of the First
Christian Church, conducted the fu
neral services, and interment was made
at the Evergreen Cemetery. Fleis'
farewell letter, which was found in his
trunk, is as follows:
All to whom it may concern and I guess
it don't concern anybody: I don't suppose
. I am good to myself or anybody else, and
therefore might as well get oft the face
of the earth. Whether this is a cup of
bitter woe or not I guess 1 gm elected,
and off I go. I have no kllk coming
against the world, nor its wobbling sur
face, only perhaps, that the world is get
ting too small tor me; and do not suppose
I ever had any business on top of its sur
face on general principles.
I don't think I owe anybody any bills
or money, and if I did overlook anything
1 guess I have enough dough left to pay
for it; and If anybody owes me any
money this pays the bill. Well, I would
suppose it would pay the bill anyhow, for
1 would never get anything. What little
money I had here I sent away to the par
ty or parties whom I cared to have it,
with the exception of the few dollars in
the Bank of Santa Cruz, of which I here
by give and bequeath to the Fi-rst Chris
tian Church of Santa Cruz, as per check
enclosed, three hundred dollars, hereby
authorizing the pastor (I don't know what
his name is. It might be Beans, for that
comes nearest to being mine or anything
I know of now), or any one in authority of
the First Christian Church, to cash or
collect the same. .
If the First Christian Church refuses to
accept same, owiÂ£r to my/ rash act, any
. other denomination may have same by
\| applying for it; and if no other denomin
ation, I guess some one will call for it.
I have no particular reason for giving
the same to the First Christian Church,
j only, perhaps, Che same is in construction
! and incomplete for lark of funds; and
, whether I go into a hole in the ground or
i any place else I rannnt take any of it
along anyway. I do not suppose I belong
to any denomination, and if I did claim
to I would bo no credit to any one any
way, for I don't think any one would care
to recognize me after this act.
However. I believe if one denomina
i tion is good they are all good, regard
| less of creed, providing tuey live up to
thf'r dictates, or. as the fellow says,
, "Practice what they preach," otherwise
;it is all hypocrisy. \P I will go anywhere
else, outside of a hole in the ground, I
trust I won't go any further unless for
the better. I suppose I will be trans
. ferred as assignee to the Missouri De
partment for drying awhile, because I
. am too - â green to burn.
You can bury me wherever you want,
but permit no one to remove me from
here, regardless of party, and I appeal to
tht' authorities for the same. If you
want to place me out in the Pacific
Ocean, where it is good and deep, but
nowhere else. Do not dissect me or per
form any incisions.
I suppose I can give you the Cornner'9
, inquest substantially right here and save
'you unnecessary deliberat.on: "The de
i ceased or fool came to his death
! by deliberately administering laudanum
i by his own hand."
The balance of the money I have left
in the bank here, as per check Inclosed.
I can be used in getting me off the face of
I the earth. I need not say funeral -ex
, penses. for T won't have any. and don't
', give a cent if I do or not. There is about
i $50 fnr a cask, coffin; or. T suppose, a flry
; goods-box will do. Five dollars for a hole
in the ground and $5 for a space on top.
Tne balancp can be used for incidental
expenses. If thero is any left you can
also apply the same to the Christian
i Church. You need not place a grave
i marker or anything else on my grave,
! but let the weeds prow good, and plenty
I of them, and then I know I will get what
i I call for. What T have said here I sent
away, and that settles the whole outfit
without causing any one unnecessary ex
pense of coming here. What few traps I
nave here at the house the house can
keep or take or burn, for all I care. Be
cause I did not blow In all my dough is
not my fault. I have tried to do so, and
still have it.
Well, old boy. T guess you have talked
too much already. You might as well
come to the front, pass in your checks
and close your lamps. Good-by to all.

SEMI-MONTHLY DOG TRAIN

An Enormous Fortune Realized by

Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 14.â The Arctic
Express Company has completed ar
rangements for maintaining a semi
monthly dog train mail and express
service to Dawson over the ice, com
mencing November 4. A few weeks ago
a large scow loaded with lumber and
eighteen carpenters started down the
Yukon. It has left a trail of substan
tial winter cabins behind it. Every fif
ty miles the scow would tie up to the
bank and in two days its carpenters
would construct a cabin 16x24 feet, even
to floor and chinking.
Following the carpenters' scow others
loaded with provisions were sent down.
Each cabin wae given a supply of food
of every kind. During the winter these
supplies will be sold to parties coining
out over the ice. The last scows took
the mployes. many of whom had their
wives with them. Several relays of dog
teams will be kept at each station.
The list of stations and the distance
between from Bennett to Dawson fol
lows: Tagish Post, 55 miles; White
Horse, -50 miles; foot Lake Lebarge, 58
miles; Big Salmon, 66 miles; Little Sal
mon, G6 miles; Five Finger, 60 miles;
Fort Selkirk, 60 miles; Stewart, 60
miles; Dawson, 60 miles.
President Rattenbury of the Arctic
Express Company made these details
public to-day.
Arthur Spiess has returned from
Dawson, where he went as manager of
Pat Galvin's cattle expedition, which
drove a thousand head of beef in over
the Dalton trail. They were driven
leisurely, with the result that the catiie
fattened during the trip. Only six died
before reaching Fort Selkirk, where the
herd was slaughtered and thence rafted
to Dawson. Four butcher shops were
opened there, beef selling at $1 25 per
pound retail and 55 cents wholesale,
netting a fortune for Galvin and Spiess.
Henry Blackwood of Oregon drove in
265 cattle over the Dalton trail and also
made a good stake. He says that the
net profits on the first fifteen butchered !
and retailed amounted to $8000.
Word came to-day that George Gais- |
ford of Dawson lost several hundred
hogs which he drove over White Pass :
and was taking down the Yukon. They
were loaded on scows which were be
ing towed by a small steamer. The
scows grounded on an invisible bar and
the entire lot of swine was lost over
board. _________^^__
CHURCH UNITY THE
AB3ORBING THEME
Deputies and Bishops of the Episco
palian Conference Discuss In
teresting Topics.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â Church unity
was again the absorbing topic before the
house of deputies of the Episcopalian
conference to-day, the discussion of yes
terday being continued on Rev. Dr.Hunt
ington's proposition to broaden the scope
of the church by permitting Bishops to
take under spiritual guidance outside
congregations not conforming strictly to
the Episcopal liturgy.
The final disposition of the question
went over until Monday.
The house of Bishops adopted a propo
sition extending the offenses for which
Bishops may be tried to include "conduct
unbecoming a Bishop." Another 'amend
ment adopted extends the provision
against alienating church property.
The Bishops discussed and passed arti
cles IV, VII and VIII of the amendments
to the constitution, already passed by
the house. Article VII covers the "pro
vincial system."
Nominations were made for the vacant
bishoprics in North Dakota, Sacramento
and Boise, but the names were withheld
until final action is taken.
At 2:30 both houses adjourned In order
to permit the Bishops and deputies, some
400 in number, to start on the pilgrimage
to Jamestown Island, near Richmond,
Va., where 300 years ago the church was
first established in America.

Mooted Questions as
to Hawaii.
AFTERMATH OF ANNEXATION
COMPLICATIONS MAY ARISE BE
FORE CONGRESS ACTS.
Acting Attorney General Boyd of the
Opinion That Regulations Appli
cable to All Territories
Will Hold Good.
..'.! Pi spat eh to The Tall.
Call < 'iTVe, Rlggs House,
Washington, Oct. 14.
What laws have general dominion
over Hawaii? Wore United States
statutes, which govern our Territories,
applied to the Sandwich Islands when
Congress rut i lied annexation? These
are questions which have occupied a
great deal of attention of judicial cir
cles in Washington the past week.
Under what laws would an offense
described by our Territorial Federal
laws be punished if committed at this
time in Plonolulu?
This and kindred questions were
brought to the attention of the Depart
ment of Justice early this week by the
Comptroller of Currency in com,
with the establishment of the First Xa- i
tionaj Bank of Hawaii, in which prom- !
inent San Franciscans are understood !
to be interested.
When an opinion was asked by the ,
Comptroller of Currency upon the part)
of the Department of Justice ques- â 
tions much deerer and more serious
than the establishment of a bank arose.
It is known that at this time customs
duties, internal revenue and postal re- !
ceipts are being husbanded by the na- j
tive authorities in Hawaii to be ac
counted for to the United States Gov
ernment ass - the bill which the;
Hawaiian will recommend I
has b< â¢ . which will be in the j
earliest days in ; session of. Congress,
which conv< nes In December.
If a crime were to be committed in j
ection with the handling 1 of these
funds the question ariseÃ, How would
the offender be punished? If there ,
should be an infraction of international ;
it this juncture would the native
Hawaiian Government or the Govern
ment of the United States enter into
negotiations with the foreign powers I
Involved for adjudication? If treason
were to develop in the Hawaiian Isl- I
amis at this time would it be treason ;
against the United States or treason j
nst Hawaii? Unquestionably those
islands were annexed to the United
States by the act of July 7, after the
islands were turned over to the United
States Commission which was re- j
cently in Honolulu. If treason I
in Hawaii would be punished
as an offense against the United
States, then the question arises,
Were not all of the Federal statutes
that apply to ordinary territory of the
United States extended to Hawaii when
it was made possible to punish a man
for treason by act of annexation?
No formal opinion has yet been renÂ»
dered by the Attorney General, and in
view of the fact that Congress meets
on the sth of December, which is only
about six weeks hence, and Territorial
laws are to be immediately extended by
Congress over the Sandwich Islands, it
is believed that a formal decision by
the Department of Justice will not be
made. It is generally held at the De
partment of Justice that any crime |
committed under the circumstances In \
Hawaii described by our Federal
statutes would be punished thereunder
and our Territorial statutes made ap. I
plic-able to the situation.
So far as the establishment of a na- i
tional bank at this time in Hawaii is !
concerned, it is believed that the pro- I
jectors will not insist upon immediate !
action, as there will be legislation at j
the hands of Congress specifically au
thorizing the issuance of a charter for
a national bank by the time the bank
could possibly be established and bank i
notes printed for circulation.
Acting Attorney General Jamcp B.
Boyd, speaking to-day of the authority
of the Comptroller of Currency to issu^ i
at this time a charter for a national
bank in Hawaii, paid:
"What I have to say on this subject
is, under the circumstances, entirely j
unofficial and upon my personal r^spon- '

Th*e trouble is that they do not take the lit-

sary to preserve health. They pay no at-
tention to the signs of on-coming ill-health.
A little biliousness, a little indigestion, a
little loss of sleep and appetite, a little
nervousness, a little headache, a little
shakiness in the morning, and a little dull-

sibility, and should be regarded as the
opinion of a lawyer, and not that ot
the acting Attorney General.
"The resolution of Congress- approved
on the 7th of July, IS9S, anneaed thb
Hawaiian Islands as a part of the ter
ritory of the United States, and mads
them subject to sovereign dominion
thereof. This constituted said islands,
as much a part of the territory of the
United States as any other of its TerÂ«
ritorial domain, and made it as much
a subject to the general powers and
authority of the Government of the
United States as any other of its terri
tory. It is true that the resolution
says that municipal legislation of the
Hawaiian Islands not inconsistent with
this joint resolution nor contrary to the
constitution of the United States, noi
any existing treaty of the United
States, shall remain in force until the
Congress of the United States shall
otherwise determine. Instead of quail-.
fying the general authority of the Gov
ernment* of the United States over the
islands, this provision expressly says
that municipal laws, in order to remain
in force, must not be inconsistent with
this resolution. Any one, therefore, of
the municipal laws which is contrary
to the general laws of the United
States would be inconsistent because
such municipal law would interfere
with the complete dominion of this
Government. It may be that the Ha
waiian Islands have local laws in re
gard to the establishment of banks and
other local institutions; but this does
not interfere with the right of the Gov
ernment to authorize the organization
of a national bank in this territory, be
cause national banking laws are gen
eral and vest authority In the Comp
troller of Currency to authorize the or
ganization of national banks in any
part of the territory of the United
States. There is scarcely a State in
the American Union that does not have
some local legislation authorizing the
establishment of local banks, or State
Institutions with banking powers; still
this does not interfere with the gen
eral power of the Government to au
thorize the organization of national
hanks in such States. Such condition
might exist in any Territory where
there is a Territorial Legislature. The
Legislature might authorize the estab
lishment of local banks, and yet au
thority to organize national banks
would still exist.
"After looking over this matter and
considering it and the wording of the
resolution, with the qualifications
above indicated, I am of the opinion
that the Comptroller of Currency is as
much authorized to charter a national
hank in the Territory of Hawaii as in
that of Oklahoma or Alaska, which lat
ter is undisputed."

Adjutant General Barrett Presents
the State's War Claim Against
the Government.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â General Bar
rett of California to-day presented the
claim of the State of California against
1 the Government for expenses incurred In
I fitting out the volunteers of California in
â¢ the war against Spain to the Auditor of
1 the War Department. General Barrett
: will be given a hearing before the Audi
tor on Wednesday of next week, when it
I is supposed that the claim will be ac- j
cepted, as the chief clerk of the Auditor, I
j when handed the papers remarked:
| "Everything seems to have come up to
I the requirements of the Go /eminent, and
I am glad to say that California has
jirf-.^tnted her claim in first-class condi
tion and it will not take the department
i very long to settle it."
It was found that the Government is
not allowing claims for anything bought
or expenses incurred after June 8. This
was the day that the bill passed Cnn
i gress which provided for paying expenses
up to that day, and all expenses after
that date will need extra appropriation |
from Congress. As the amount d_ue Cal
ifornia for work after that day is very
small. General Barntt does not see why
California shoulcj complain.
The Secretary of the Interior has issued
an order patenting 160 acres of land in

AN OVATION TO

OMAHA, Oct. 14.â Major General Wil

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1898.
MILITARY MEN
IN CONSPIRACY
Plot to Overthrow the
French Government.
GENERALS ARE IMPLICATED
IT IS ALLEGED THAT PRINCE
LOUIS IS INVOLVED.
If Brisson's Cabinet Is Turned Out
Serious Complications With.
England Might
Follow.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 14.â 1t is announced here
this morning that a military plot
against the Government has been dis
covered. The Rappel, Aurore and Pe
tite Republique Francaise publish al
most identical stories on the subject.
It appears that the plot was discovered
by a general holding- an important po
sition. The plotters were to have taken
action on Saturday, during the ab
sence of the Minister of War, General
Chanoine. It further appears that
when the Government was warned of
the plot the Ministers were not sur
prised, having already obtained infor
mation regarding the conspiracy.
The Matin says the plot was not in
favor of one of the pretenders to the
throne of France, who has been talked
about for some time, but was only for
the purpose of changing certain offi
cials of the Government without touch
ing the President.
The Premier, M. Brisson was among
those who were not surprised when no
tified ofuhe plot. He promises to take
action in the matter.
The Government officials here refuse
to furnish any information regarding
the discovery of the plot, but It is ru
mored this afternoon that the conspi
racy involved Prince Louis Bonaparte,
a colonel of Russian Lancers, In whose
favor his elder brother, Prince Victor
Bonaparte, recently resigned the lead
ership of the Imperial party. It Is
added that certain political personages
handed the Premier Important docu
ments, including a cipher dispatch com
promising certain military men. The
Minister of War has recalled his an
nounced intention of leaving Paris.
The Liberte asserts that the military
men alleged to have been concerned In
the conspiracy are Generals Boisedef
fre and Pellieux. Attempts, it is added,
were also made to compromise General
Zurllnden, the military Governor of
Paris, who, for a short time, was Min
ister of War.
According to the Jour, the rumor of
the plan arose from a forged letter pur
porting to have been sent by General
Boisedeffre to General Zurlinden, con
taining the words: "Let us be ready
for Saturday."
The semi-official Temps this evening
minimizes the affair and says the offi
cials of the Ministry of War formally
deny that a plot existed. The Temps
suggests that misinterpretation was
placed on some of the numerous dis
patches now bein- exchanged between
the different garrisons in connection
with the present movements of troops,
which led to the strange reports of
plots.
SITUATION AT PARIS
REGARDED SERIOUS
LONDON, Oct. 14.â The situation in
Paris is regarded in well informed
quarters here as being more serious
than it has been at any time since the
commune.
The St. James Gazette this afternoon
says: A military .revolution, however
peaceful, which replaces the Brisson
Cabinet with the nominees of the gen
erals, would Imperil the relations be
tween England and France almost to
the breaking poin,t. The semi-official
and partly inspired Paris papers are
-still pretending that negotiations are
proceeding between the two Govern
ments, and France believes It, although
everybody In England knows the state
ment to be ridiculous. Even supposing
Major Marchand is unconditionally
withdrawn from Fashoda, the difficul
ties with France will in no way end.
Behind it lies the whole question of the
Bahr-el-Ghazel, the richest prize in
the Soudan.
The Paris correspondent of the Times
says: It is impossible to obtain clear
proofs of the existence of a plot, but
the idea of an act of force haunts cer
tain military minds. Maddened and
stung by violent criticisms of the army
arising out of the Dreyfus affair, they
are especially irritated at the attitude
of the civilians in claiming to interfere
In the detention of Colonel Picquart,
for which the entire military authority
Is responsible. Looking to the excited
state of the men's minds at the present
time and the conflict between the mili
tary and civil authorities, It Is only
surprising that such alarms are not
more frequent.
RAILROAD MEN
REFUSE TO STRIKE
PARIS, Oct. 14.â The Railroad "Work
ers' Union has posted placards ordering
a strike to-day, urging the strikers
to refrain from violence and Informing
the public that if danger threatens the
country the strikers will immediately
return to their posts. This strike in
cludes the Algerian provinces.
In spite of the placarding the threat
ened general strike did not take place.
The workmen stopped to read the pla
cards announcing the strike, but there
was no disorder. Nearly all the labor
ers are at work and the railroad service
is uninterrupted, the railroad men hav
ing apparently ignored the decision of
the committee representing them.
JOHN MILLER DIES
ON THE SCAFFOLD
Pays the Penalty at San Quentin for
the Murder of James W.
Childs.
RAN QUENTIN PRISON, Oct. 14.â An
uplifted hand as a sign to cut the rope, a
brief Jnterval of suspense, and the body
of Jotfn Miller, the crippled carpenter who
murdered James W. Childs, shot through
the trapdoor in expiation of his crime at
10:30 o'clock this morning, two years after
the commission of the deed. The execu
tion was attended by a horrible feature,
the head of the murderer being partly
several because of his great weight.
An hour and a half prior to his death
Miller's attitude toward religion changed,
and he was received into the Catholic
church by Rev. Father Lagan of San
Rafael. The sacrament and last rites of
the church were administered, and tjje
doomed man professed himself ready for
the end. Preceded by the priest, he
mounted the scaffold, closely supported
by two guards, and took his place on the
trap. His knees trembled, and be was
barely able to stand, while the fingers of
his hands twitched nervously. The noose
was adjusted, and Miller's lips moved in
mute response to a good-by from Father
Lagan. The black cap was drawn and
then came the end.
The crime for which Miller answered
with his life was the murder of James W.
Childs in San Francisco in November,
1896. He had been jilted by Mrs. Nellie
Ryan, and was pursuing her from the
house with a revolver, when Childs tried
to prevent a murder and was shot as he
grappled with the infuriated cripple. The
case has been fought in the courts on
various technicalities for nearly two
years. â¢

PITTSBURG, Oct. 14.â Executive busi
ness occupied the fourth and closing day's
session of the Grand Encampment,

the Grand Encampment on the occasion
of any future triennial conclave, the
Grand Encampment will meet in Wash
ington. The date of the meeting Is to be

bearer. Lee S. Smith of Pittsburg; grand
sword-bearer, Arthur McArthur of Troy,
N. V. : grand captain of the guard,

Washington: A. H. Wagner, Wisconsin.
The conclave then adjourned sine die.
The first to come and the last to go is
what the Pittsburg newspapers will say
to-morrow of the California delegation to
the Knights Templar conclave. The head
quarters of California Commandery No.
1 In the Carnegie building were closed
this forenoon. Many of the decorations,
all the silverware and glass used and
some of the furniture was packed and
made ready for shipment home. The
party began to disintegrate to-day.
EXECUTION OF EX-CHIEF
OF POLICE G. H. JACKS
Claimed to Be Innocent and Refused
Religious Consolation Until He
Approached the Gallows.
CHICAGO Oct. 14.â George H. Jacks,
formerly Chief of Police at Muskegon,
Mich., and John Druggan, both convicted
murderers, were hanged on the same
scaffold In the County Jail this after
noon. Some time before the hanging
Jacks sent the following letter to the
jailer:
"Mr. Whitmanâ My Dear Sir: Please
do not let any of the clergy in to see me.
If I, an innocent man, be hanged to-day,
without the right to have the highest
court in the land pass upon my case,
which has been all prepared at great ex
pense to myself and labor to my friends;
if I am refused this right, which every
man is entitled to. there certainly can
be no God above us, and in that case
the clergy can do no good. So please do
not allow any to see me. Yours
"GEORGE H. JACKS."
This request was complied with. Jacks
prayed constantly while the noose and
shroud were being adjusted. Just before
going to the gallows Jacks, notwithstand
ing his remarkable letter, consented to
be accompanied by a priest. On the way
he repeated aloud after the priest the
prayers which the latter voiced. Jacks
was very much agitated. "Oh Lord, have
mercy on my soul," were the last words
of Jacks.
Jacks was convicted of the murder of
Andrew J. McGhee, an aged collector and
solicitor, whom Jacks, assisted by Wil
liam J. Willows, now serving fourteen
years for complicity in the crime, de
coyed into an apartment house on In
diana avenue for the purpose of robbery.
Jacks had a long criminal record. When
Chief of Police of the Michigan city he
also held the position of deputy United
States Marshal, and was a member of
the Fire Department. While holding these
official positions he committed a long
series or burglaries, for which he was
finally convicted and sentenced to the
Michigan penitentiary for four years.
Upon his release he came to Chicago and
returned to his old mode of living. Jacks
was out on bond for a burglary when he
was arrested on the charge of murder.
Druggan was convicted of the murder
of Robert Gudgeon, a saloon-keeper,
whom Druggan attempted to rob.
THIEVING TRAMP
MORTALLY WOUNDED
Shot by Officers While Trying to Es-
cape, He Dies While Being
Removed.
SAN BERNARDINO. Oct. 14.â A tramp
was kiyed at Highland this morning: by
Constable Pike's posse. He had been
hanging around the neighborhood several
days, begging, stealing and" annoying and
insulting women and girls. On Tuesday
night he was seen to enter a barn near
Patton Springs by Santa Fe Agent Sav
age to steal a harness. Constable Pike
ran him down Wednesday afternoon on
the edge of a section o? rough, bushy
country, but while dismounting to follow
him he escaped. This morning a posse
took the trail. When discovered he re
fused to surrender and tried to escape by
running. He was shot in the leg by Eu
gene Worley, one of the posse. A mes
senger was dispatched for a physician.
The wounded man was placed in a wagon
to be brought to this city. He died before
reaching Highland. He was the man who
had caused so much trouble by petty
thieving and frightening isolated families.
On being searched, $46 in money and two
gold watches were found, also papers
showing his name to be John Rosenberg
of Cutler, F4a. _ /

SERIOUS BREACH
BETWEEN CUBANS
Masso Wants InsurgeQts to Dis
band, but Gomez Refuses
to Comply.
HAVANA, Oct. 14.â 1t is generally believed that a serious breach
has taken place between the executive department of the Cuban re
public and the leaders of the military forces.
Word was' received here to-day that General Wood at Santiago
had received through Colonel Ray a communication from President
Masso advising that nothing be done by the Americans that can in
any way be construed as recognizing the Cuban Government.
Masso has been joined by his colleagues In declaring the time
has arrived for disbanding the Cuban forces. He advises all soldiers to
return to their homes, there to resume their labors as before the in
surrection. He gives the assurance that in so doing they will serve
their own best interests and will be safe in the hands of the Ameri
cans.
This course will be vigorously qombated by General Gomez. Gen
eral Juan Ducasse, one of the closest advisers of General Gomez, ar
rived in Havana to-night to consult with the opponents of President
Masso and all those who favor the Cuban republic and oppose further
American intervention. General Ducasse declares that Gomez will
lead the insurgents back into the field before he will submit to dis
arming them while American and Spanish soldiers remain in Cuba,
PAINTINGS ADMIRED
BY THE MULTITUDE
WINTER, EXHIBITION OF THE
ART INSTITUTE A SUCCESS.
Local Artists Present the Work of
Months to an Admiring
Public.
A critical garnering of lovers of art
passed throujru the spacious rooms of the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art yesterday
and inspected the many hundred paint
ings exhibited by local artists. Through
out the day visitors with catalogues in
hand studied the creations with deep in
terest.
"The Camp by the Cross," the work of
Charles Rollo Peters, attracts marked at
tention. The picture brings back the days
when regiments were encamped on the
old Bay District track site, close to grim
Lone Mountain and its wooden cross. The
white tents are seen through the heavy
fog, and a sentinel stands with gu*h in
hand peering through the vapory mists
at the knoll of the burial place.
John W. Clawson, whose beautuul
pastel of Miss Mary Belle Gwinn received
favorable mention at the last exhibition,
has a number of excellent pictures exhib
ited. C. Chapel Judson has a splendid
collection of paintings on the wall, the
foremost of which- is the "Coming
Storm." Among the other contributors
are Miss Julia Heynemann, Joseph Green
baum, John A. Stanton, Miss Mary Cur
tis Richardson. William Keith* Yelland,
Cadenasso, Aaron, Altmann, Mrs.

Froellch. Miss Eleanor Warren, Harry
Fonda. Strong, Joseph Raphael, Charles
L. Turner, Bertha Stringer Lee, Oscar
Kunath, Sidney Yard, Robert Edgren, L.
Maynard Dixon and Robert L. Aitken.
The exhibition is said to surpass pre
vious displays of its kind, and its success
is assured. It will last five weeks, and
will be opened every day from 9 o'clock to
5 p. m. Many of the pictures are on sale,
and already a number have been dis
posed of.
On Thursday evening a grand vocal and
instrumental programme will be ren
dered under the leadership of Henry Hev
man. Marshall Giselman, a 15-year-old
boy, will render some difficult selections
on the grand organ which stands at the
head of the main stairway. The young
ster charmed those who attended the ex
hibition by his exquisite playing.
WITH THE GOLF
CLUB SWINGERS.
A golf league h&p been formed by the
Oakland, Burlingame, San Francisco nd
San Rafael clubs and a schedule is nov in
process of formation. A provisional
schedule has been prepared, but as there
are a number of conflicts in it. It will be
rearranged during the coming week. It
calls for match tournaments at the four
club links that will continue throughout
the year and the early part of spring.
The San Francisco links are being put
in shape rapidly and practice is resumed
among the members. A schedule of
tournaments has also been prepared by
this club and the first tournament will
be played under the schedule on Saturday
next. The plans for the new club house
on the Presidio links are prepared, but
several important changes will be made
before they are accepted.
At Oakland to-day the Burlingame Club
team will be entertained and an invitation
tournament played.
The San Rafael Club Is very gloomy at
the present time. Just when it was all
but settled to have a nine-link grounds
and everything in readiness to draw up a
contract with the lessors of the ground
the bottom dropped out of the scheme.
Now the San Rafael players will be
forced to do their playing on a five-link
field.

FOR TEN THOUSAND
DOLLARS DAMAGES
James Moore, a marine fireman, brought
suit In the United States District Court
yesterday against W. P. S. Porter, mas
ter, and Edwin L. Griffith and others,
owners of the whayng steamship ' Jessie
H. Freeman, to recover $10,000 damages
for breach of contract and his consequent
suffering. The complaint alleges that
on . December 6, 1893. Moore shipped as
fireman on the whaling steamship Na
varch for a three years' cruise in the
Arctic, the contract specifying that he
was to be returned to San Francisco at
the expense of his â¢ employers on the ex
piration of his contract. Moore was sub
sequently, with his consent, transferred
to the Freeman, and at the end of the
three years' term for which he had
signed articles he requested Master Por
ter to release him and forward him to
San Francisco in compliance with the
provisions of the contract. Porter de
clined to do either and kept Moore prac
tically a prisoner on board the Freeman.
The ship was wrecked in the Arctic, and
Moore was rescued by the United States
revenue cutter Bear.

A NOVEL LAWSUIT.
An important suit will be tried before
Judge Kerrigan next week Friday, in
volving an entire $300,000 issue of bonds |
by the California Electric Light Com- j
pany. The points In dispute are novel, |
and will probably be passed upon event- j
ually by the Supreme Court of the
State.
It appears that in 1888 the Electric
Light Company issued the bonds In ques- '
tion, giving each a face value of $1000 !
and stipulating in the contract that they j
were to be payable twenty-five years I
from date and to- bear Interest at the j
rate of 6 per cent per annum. A proviso I
was inserted that on July 3, 1898, and on I
the same day of every subsequent year, i
the company would be privileged to take j
up ten of the bonds each year, the ones i
to be thus taken up to be selected by
lots drawn from a wheel. The company,
however, prior to July 3, 1898. exchanged I
196 of the bonds for others of a different I
denomination. Hence when the first ;
drawing of 'ots fron: the wheel took place
on July 3 oniy 104 numbers, representing
the original bonds remaining, were used i
for the drawing. Two of the numbers |
drawn for payment represented the two !
bonds of Joseph Westall. He now con~ I
tends that none of the 104 remaining ;
bonds of the 1888 can be taken up. mas- :
much as the provisions of the bonds pro~ i
viding for a lottery of 300 numbers can- j
not be enforced, owing to the unauthor- (
ized taking up of 196 bonds prior to July ]
3, 1898. He refuses to surrender his hold
ings, and sues in Judge Kerrigan's court
for his interest.
It is understood that all of the other j
bondholders are behind Westall. and proÂ» |
pose to fight the Electric Light Com
pany's attempt to take up its bonds be- i
foi*e the same mature. In case the con
tention is successful the light company '
will lose about $12,000 in interest which i
will have to be paid to the bondholders. '
It Is said that there is no parallel to this i
case and therefore no precedents upon
which Judge Kerrigan can depend in
reaching a conclusion.

STANDS OFF CUBAN DEBT
PEACE COMMISSIONERS DISCUSS
WAR EQUITIES.
Commander Bradford, U. S. N., Ex
amined Relative to Conditions
Prevailing in the
Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 14.â Commander Brad
ford, U. 8. N., who has arrived here
from Washington, was examined this
morning by the members of the United
States Peace Commission relative to
the conditions prevailing and the main
features of interest in the Philippine
Islands, with which the commander is
well acquainted.
The fifth joint session of the two
commissions was convened at 2 o'clock
to-day.
The American reply to the Spanish
presentation of Tuesday was submitted
and read. An oral discussion followed,
when the commissions adjourned until
Monday next. f
It is believed that the Spaniards sub
mitted as their construction of the
protocol that it was just to consider
Spain as having equities fairly dis
chargable by the American assump
tion of Cuban obligations. It is not un
likely that the Americans voiced the
conviction that fair equities to the
United States, in war expense, were In
curred by the United States, and pos
sibly, though not positively, the Amer
icans may schedule the value of the
battleship Maine among the expendi
tures possible of classification against
the so-called Cubsn debt.
However, it may be considered cer
tain that the commissions have arrived
at a point in the negotiations from
which henceforth the joint sessions
will be occupied by oral discussions as
well as by written presentations of
propositions. The work is now thor
oughly entered upon, though it is not
likely that any segment has been pol
ished and finished for a place In the
final treaty.
The Philippine question has not yet
been entered upon.
SAGASTA AND COLLEAGUES
ARE GREATLY CONCERNED
BAYONNE, France, Oct. 14.â Accord-
Ing to advices received from Madrid
a rigorous censorship has been revived
there since yesterday.
Senor Sagasta and his colleagues are
reported to be greatly concerned re
garding the demands of the United
States Government, which, they assert,
not only refuses to assume any of
Spain's colonial debts, but wants to
take the heavy artillery in Cuba and
the floating docks recently sent to Ha
vana.
The same advices say the Madrid
Imparcial announces that the Govern
ment has cabled General Blanco not to
turn over any further territory to the
Americans until the peace treaty has
been definitely signed.
GUN CLUB'S JINKS.
A Large Gathering of Sportsmen En
tertained by tiie Olympics.
In the height of the duck season, when
shooting is said to be above the average
and the ponds throughout the surrounding
j counties abound with dusks, the Olympic
i Gun Club held a dedication jinks, the suc
cess of which may have a tendency to
keep many sportsmen away from their
favorite pastime to-morrow. The, popular
organization, which has in its ranks the
best shots in the State, held its initial
entertainment last night for the purpose
of dedicating its new home on Kearny
and Morton streets.
Success crowned the efforts of the com
mittee having the affair in charge. Presi
dent H. H. White, assisted by Correspond
ing Secretary Merton Allen, Recording
Secretary Clarence Haight, Treasurer A.
A. Borlini and Directors C. W. Hibbard,
E. T. Allen, C. F. Grant and W. J. Gol
cher, received the visitors and made them
at home. The programme was started
early. Chairman Golcher of the jinks
committee introduced the following well
known entertainers, who were greatly ap
preciated: Frank Thompson, barytone
solo; Henry C. Larsen, violin solo; Jack
Cathcart, comic selections; Ben li. Tar

E. F. Preston and Truman Reeves ar- j
rived here on the V 2:2?. train on their
nay from Fresno to Merced, where the
Republican candidate for Governor was ,
to have spoken to-night. A committee \
composed of W. C. Maze, Dr. E. H. j
Reid, J. F. Daulton, A. Jacobs, E. E.
Vincent. W. A. Hiller. A. White, G. G.
Parsons, J. G. Roberts and J. W. Has- |
viale went to Fresno and escorted the :
Republican leader to Madera, As the |
train pulled up at the station the Ma
3era brass band struck up an inspiring
air. an artillery salute was fired and i
the calliope strains poured from the
Whistle at the electric light power
house, while the whistle on the Sayre !
packing house kept up a continuous :
tooting and the large crowd that had \
assembled to welcome the next Go-v- j
ernor gave musing. cheers with hats in ;
air for the people's choice as he alighted :
from the train. Mr. Gage was kept j
busy shaking hands with those who
thronged around him.
After a selection by the band the au
dience at the hall w;is called to order
by E. E. Vincent, chairman of the Re- j
publican Central Committee, who in- |
croduced Mr. Gage as the first speaker, j
The applause was enthusiastic and
long continued as the standard bearer
made his first appearance before a Ma
dera audience.
Mr. Gage reviewed his early
history, leading up to his present
position The audience listened with
the deepest interest to the story of his
first political speech, which was \nade
more than twenty years ago in denun
ciation of the Southern Pacific com
pany entering into the politics of this
Etate. He said that many times he nad
been solicited by the railroad company
to represent it, but he had steadfastly
refused to act in its behalf und3r any
circumstances, and he had never taken
a do) ar from the corporation except
when he had made it disgorge thou
sands of dollars for having wronged or
killed his fellow men.
In speaking of the outlook for the Re
publican ticket Mr. Gage said that from
ration sained from extensive
travel and judging from the confusion
of the fusion forces, he was entirely
Justified in predicting the grandest Re
publican triumph on November 8 ever
recorded in this State. Said he:
"There are many reasons why we can
make this prediction with confidence
at this time. Firsi we must remember
that th" fusion party will not receive
the support of the old Jeffersonian
Democrats, who were guided by prin
ciple and who believed the doctrines
they advocated would accrue to the
benefit of the country and the glory
of the American Hag. Now they have
no party to go to except the Republican
party. Many of this noble class of men
hold in the highest regard the Republi
can party and President McKinley, who
granted military commissions ti> F:tz
hugh Lee and "Fighting Joe' YVh
thu.~ obliterating the distinction be
tween the North and the ri<>mh. Sec
tional feeling being a thing of the past,
the patriot i.- Democrat Is inclined to
assist the Republican in the present
election."
In closing. Mr. Gage said that if
elected Governor of this State he would
be dominated by no railroad company,
no corporation, no clique, no individual,
and that no man or child would come
â¢within his jurisdiction too poor to
receive justice. His administration
would be honest, pure and fearless.
Colonel E. F. Preston was then in
troduced and was received with a
burst of applause. He stated that
when at home he represented the Val
ley Railroad, bat that he was not here
as its attorney, for it was not in poli
tics in any way whatever. He said
that there was but one solution to ill
railroad question, and that was to lay
steel rails on a good, Bound roadbed
and equip th< m with first-class rolling
stock and have it managed by honest
business men.
He most emphatically denied the
rumor that the Valley road had been
sold to the Southern Pacific, branding
such as a miserable campaign lie. He
stated that the chief engineer of the
Valley road was to-day In the moun
tains for thr- purpose of extending the
road frum Bakersfield to connect with
the Santa Fe system, and that the peo
ple of this district soon would hear thÂ»
Whistle at engines on a road extending
not only to the limit of this valley, but
across the American continent.
Truman Reeves, candidate on the
Republican ticket for State Treasurer,
â¢was introduced and made a brief
speech.

MERCED, Oct. 14.â Henry T. Gage.
the Republican nominee for Governor,
accompanied by Colonel E. F. Preston,
journeyed from Fresno through Madera
and Merced counties to-day. At every
halt place they were greeted by en
thusiastic crowds. Messrs. Gage and
Preston did not arrive at Merced until
twilight. At the depot of the Valley
road they were met by a large throng of
men, women and children. When the
standard bearer alighted from the train
the people gave three cheers for the
next Governor of California. Artillery
salutes and music by the Fountain City
tsanci heralded the â¦arrival of the dis
tinguished campaigner. No time waa
lost in forming the procession to escort
him to El Capitan .Hotel. A delay in
the arrival or the (jage party con
strained the Merced committee to omit
from the programme the reception
which as to have taken place at the
hotel.
Before the hour appointed for the
meeting to open every seat in the Mer
ceU .Pavilion was occupied and all ihe
standing room was taiten. It was the
largest assemblage of the campaign in
Merced County, nenry T. Gage and E.
F. Preston were escorted to the pa,
vilion by a committee. The audience
cheered when Air. Gage was recognized
and the Merced Concert Band at the
same nine discoursea patriotic music.
The meeting was caueu to order by J.
W. ivnox, who announced J. H. bimon
son as cnairman, with vice chairmen as
follows: A. Bickford, E. C. Baker, M.
D. Atwater, G. W. Abbott, H. H. Cole
man, L.. V. Herrod, Henry G. Peck, H.
J. Ostrander, James Minturn, C. B.
Herren, N. S. Stockton, William Whea-
Lan, E. Grimes, Frank Heimer, George
Deane, H. W. Brouse and Joseph King.
In some respects the meeting present
ed new and interesting features. A reg
uiar pro ramme of exercises offered an
opportunity for the display of Merced
musical talent. The ulee Club, com
posed of ladies and gentlemen, made a
great hit in the 'singing of popular
songs paraphrased for the campaign. A
song, "Our Candidate for Governor,"
by Miss Jolly, delighted the large au
dience. ,â -..;
'Ihe introduction of Henry T. Gage
was the signal for general applause,
and the auuience manifested its pleas
ure with the clapping of hands. The
standard-bearer spoke for over an
hour. He warmed up to his work as
the argument advanced, and soon gain
ed the favor of his hearers by his sin
cere and manly wa â  of stating the
propositions of the campaign. He ad
hered to the line of discourse in the
Fresno speech last night, and soon
elicited responsive cheering. In resent
ing Maguire's assaults upon the integ
rity of the Republican State Conven
tion and regarding Maguire's humbug
gery in the settlement of the railroad
fuding measure, Mr. Gage used plain
language.
The ventilation of the single-tax
scheme commanded the profound at
tention of the people of Merced. WoVds
were not minced in condemnation of
the scheme to place the entire burden
of maintaining the government on the
owners of land.
Mr. Gage received round after round
of applause when he demonstrated to
the audience that during the entire ser- j
vice of Maguire in the .Legislature and
in Congress the "Little Giant" had
done nothing for the people.
After Mr. Gage's speech Mr. Abell
sang a campaign song. Hon. E. F.
Preston was the next speaker intro
duced. He spoke with his usual elo
quence and force, using language so
clear and pointed that his meaning
could not be misunderstood. He nailed
the campaign calumny that the Val
ley road was in danger of passing to the
control of the Southern Pacific and
evoked cheering commendation by his
demonstration of the fact that anti
monopoly jawbone never had done any
thing to better the condition of the peo
ple of San Joaquin Valley and never
would assist in the settlement of the
industrial problem of the day. The
fallacies of the Maguire single tax
dogma were exposed in a manner which
convinced the audience that Mr. Pres
ton had studied the question and was
capable of meeting and overthrowing
the arguments of the socialists. The
eulogy of President McKinley's remark
able administration called out cheering
applause.
The enthusiasm increased as the
speaking progressed and the audience,
which at first seemed a trifle undemon
strative, responded with great enthusi
asm to the patriotic sentiments ex
pressed by the logical and eloquent ex
ponents of Republican principles. The
great mass meeting, the largest held
during this campaign in Merced Coun
ty, dissolved with three rousing cheers
for Gage and Neff.
In Merced, as in other places in the
1 San Joaquin Valley, the Republicans
j are alert and confident. They are sure
I that the fusion majority for Bryan will
be greatly reduced and all doubt of the
triumph of the Republican cause has
vanished.
A. Li. Levlnsky addressed the audi
ence after the conclusion of Mr. Pres
ton's address.
Gage and Preston will journey on to
Stockton via Modesto and Oakdale.
Every hour of the tour increases con
fidence in the triumph of the cause
which they represent.

Webb Hali, seating over 600, was

the street and was addressed by dis
tinguished speakers, .besides Judge Ma-,
quire there were present Congressman
de Vries, H. M. Larue. Thomas Scott,
E. L>. Hutchison, Robert Ferral and S.
K. Burkham of Mono, candidate for
State Senator.
Ex-Congressman A. Caminetti. the
chairman, made a lengthy speech,
praising the Democratic State ticket
and contending that the nominees were
free from railroad influence and wore
opposed by the Southern Pacific, while
the railroad company was doing its ut
most to elect the Republican ticket.
He introduced Maguire as a former
farmer, pointing to a plow placed on
the stage, as a former blacksmith,
whose emblem, an anvil, also was on
the stage, and lastly, as the next Gov
ernor of California.
Maguire was received with rousing
cheers. He said he was unable to ad
dress the meeting at length, as his
voice was hoarse because of much talk
ing, and he had to address also the
overflow meeting outside. He said the
reason why hi.s voice had suffered per
haps more than that of his opponent
was that he did a good deal of his own
talking, while the Republican candi
date for Governor was wearing out the
throats of railroad attorneys who were
talking for him.
He said the issue in California was
the one handed down from the days of
Jefferson â "equal rights for all. special
privileges for none." The Democratic
party was on the side of popular
rights. The Republican party was in
favor of the allied monopolies. What
ever Gage might be individually as re
gards thÂ£ railroad company, it was a
notable fact that he was traveling in
company with well known attorneys of
the Southern Pacific. In the south he
was accompanied by Barnes, a leading
attorney of the company; in other parts I
of the State by Judge Carpenter, a po
litical manager for the railroad, and in
the mountains by J. C. Campbell, an
other well known lawyer of the corpor
ation. ______________

MR. LOUD EXPOSES
MAGUIRE'S RECORD
ON FUNDING BILL
Congressn)ao Shows h\ovJ His
Colleague Is SailiQg Under
False Colors.
Inside History of House Proceedings Giver) at
the Great Republicao Raily at
Redwood City.
REDWOOD CITY, Oct. 14.â Eugene j
F. Loud, Republican nominee for Con- \
gress in the Fifth Congressional Dis- j
trict, addressed a large and enthusias- [
tic audience to-night in the Alhambra
Theater. He showed in a masterly
way that James G. Maguire, the stand
ard bearer of the Populist, Democratic
and Silver Republican parties, has been |
posing In a false light on the funding
bill question and other measures <-;f
local and national interest. .
The meeting was called to order by
B. F. Cooper, who in a brief address
introduced Congressman Loud. The ap
pearance of Congressman Loud was the
signal for an outburst of applause and
frequently during his speech he was
interrupted by cheers and hand clap
ping. In referring to the appropriation
for Redwood Creek Mr. Loud said:
Whether Mr. Craig be elected or
myself, in the regular order oÂ£ proced
ure, next winter, before Mr. Craig, even
if elected, could take his scat, this creek
will be provided for. It would have been
provided for this year were it not for the
fact that, after consultation between the
leaders of the Republican party, when we
came together a year ago, it was conclud
ed to be best to go a little slow in the use
of public money, for the reason that the
Democratic party had been in power so
long and had so depleted the public treas
ury that the income was only about suf
ficient to meet the ordinary expenses of
the Government.
1 believe you know that I seldom dis
cuss publicly questions in which 1 have
a personal interest, but certain things
have been said which force me to make
some statements in defense of myself, and
I shall not discuss men as individuals, and
I shall be as careful as it is possible for
me to be to discuss the candidates tor
public office simply in respect to their
public capacity and as leaders of the
party or combination of parties which op
pose us. -,
Prom that standpoint I shall discuss Mr.
Maguire, the nominee of this combination
for Governor of the State of California. I
will not call him the nominee of the Dem
ocratic party, because the Democratic
party is existent no more. The principles
enunciated by that party since its very
Inception have been cast to the four winds
of heaven, forcing the men who have en
deavored to be true to Democratic prin
ciples to leave that party and join the
Republican, in order that they might pro
tect and better conserve the interests ol
our people. , . Â
If the principles proclaimed by Mr.
Maguire are for the best interests of our
State and our country, then he shoiuu
be elected. There are two points that
must be considered by citizens when they
vote for any man: First, is the man fit
ted for the office to which he aspires?
and second, are the principles enunclat
! Ed by the party to which he belongs the
i best to be adopted?
On his return to California Mr. Maguire
'â  Immediately took the offensive, condemn
ing every man in the Republican party
who had anything to do with its conven
tion at Sacramentoâ condemning, I say.
every candidate upon its ticket. Now, 1
j wish to say by way of parenthesis and
| also justice that Mr. Maguire and I have
been personal friends for many years,
and I have had much admiration for him.
But 1 do not believe at all in his political
principles nor in his political acts. On
Mr Maguire's return from Washington,
referring to Mr. Barham. a colleague of
mine and the representative from the
First District of California, he said he
had been a traitor and untrue to the
trust reposed in him. Referring to me he
said: "While Mr. Barham voted for this
funding amendment"â as he calls itâ Air.
Loud did not vote at all."
Possibly some time Mr. Maguire may
see fit to explain this utterance, because
it is *'n injustice to me. I have never
seen the time when I could not afford to
be honest to the people whom I repre
sent, and should that time ever come I
hope I shall be retired. .
Mr Maguire well knew why I did not
vote He well knew that I was paired

Democratic convention at Chicago, Mr.
Richardson of Tennessee, and he weh
knew how he would have voted, ana ne
well knew how I would have voted.
would have voted for the amendment to
the deficiency bill which Mr. Maguire so
strenuously opposed, because I believed it
was right, and I am prepared to defend it
Mr Maguire has, probably, had as
much free advertising in this State as any
man who ever went to the House x>l Rep
i resentatives. You have seen in the pub-
I lie press time and again that he has de-
! feated funding billsâ and there have bet-n
I two or three before Congress. Lot ua
seeâ and I propose to deal strictly with
the record, not trusting to my memory in
the least.
The first funding bill presented was in
the Fifty-third Congress, of which Mr.
Maguire was a member. That bill was>
debated in the House for some days. We
have In the House of Representatives a
custom, when any great question is up
for debate, that the chairman of the com
mittee having the measure in charge is
permitted to control the allotment of time
on his side of the question, and some one
representing the other side is designated
by unanimous consent of the body to con
trol the time on that side of the ques
tion. In the Fifty-third Congress, when
the time was yielded up on this bill, Mr.
Maguire was given five minutes on a de
bate occupying several days, and it was
heralded through every newspaper In the
State of California that James G. Ma
guire, the "Little Giant of "the PacifiÂ«
I Coast," had defeated the funding bill. The
! same thing was repeated in the Fifty
fourth Congress, Mr. Maguire being ylcjd
ed again five minutes, that being consid
ered all the time he was worth upon a
great question of national importance. In
that time he defeated the funding bill
again. What great power, force and elo-
I quence a man must possess to accomplish
in five minutes a result which all the rest
iof Congress must deliberate upon for
days!
In the session of Congress just closed an
amendment was proposed in the Senate to
the general deficiency bill carrying this
year some $220,000,000. This amendment
; was new legislation, and could only be put
, | upon the deficiency bill or any appropria
; i tlon bill in the Senate by unanimous con-
I sent. I will explain that no general legis
lation can be placed upon an appropria
1 tion in either House of Congress if the
point of order is raised against it. Some
time prior to the adoption of the amend- ,
ment in the Senate Senator Morgan, to
whom probably more is due for the defeat
of funding bills in Congress than any
other man, together with Senator White,
whom no man can deny is head and
shoulders above Mr. Maguire â yes, head }
' and shoulders above many Senators whom ,
: we have had from the State of California j
| â got together and reasoned In this v.#y:
, We are in the midst of a great war. This I
is no time to foreclose this debt on the |
' Central and Western Pacific railroads. !
Money is not seeking investment, and a I
little more time should be given In order I
1 that we rray look around and be sure of \
â  our position. Conference after conference :
1 took place, and the ultimate result was
the adoption of the amendment as in
troduced in the Senate.
While It is not history, yet I do not be
; | lieve that Mr. Maguire will deny that he
' | was a party to these conferences day â 
; after day until the final amendment
reached the shape in which it was offered. â 
I charge that he was a party to the act !
; of putting this amendment upon the de
. ficiency bill in the Senate in order tnat
j the amendment might then be presented :
to the House of Representatives for his
agitation and discussion.
Now let us see how the amendment !
was placed on the deficiency bill. Sena- |
tor Gear of lowa, chairman of the Com
mittee on Pacific Railroads in the Sen
ate, offered this amendment, framed upon
an understanding between men in that
body irrespective of party. As soon as
it was offered Senator Hale, in charge of
the bill, arose in his place and raised the
point of order upon it for the reason
which I have previously stated. Senator
White then got up and said:
"Mr. President, I hope the Senator will
withdraw the point of order, for I can
assure him that there will be no objec
tion made to it and that there will be
no debate upon it."
Senator Hale replied that "if the Sena
tor from California who has in days gone
by opposed measures similar in charac
ter to the amendment will assure me that
there will be no objection and no debate
then I will withdraw the point of order."
The point of order was .withdrawn and \
not a single negative vote was cast
against the amendment as offered. I
I ask in all candor whether it is rea
sonable to assume that there is more
honesty, more wisdom and more acumen
in Mr. Maguire than in the ninety Sena
tors representing the different States
throughout our country?
I call attention to the revenue cutter
now lying in San Francisco harbor, which
was bunt under authority of an act in
troduced and passed by me within three
months after I first took my seat in Con
gress.
Now what were the facts about that
case? On October 23, 1893, about three
months after Mr. Maguire took his seat,
this revenue cutter measure came up in
this way: Mr. Maguire had introduced a
bill providing for a revenue cutter for
San Francisco harbor and an appropria
tion of 550.000 to build it. This bill went
to the committee on interstate and for
eign commerce and one day, Mr. Mallory
of Florida called up a bill reported by
that committee to provide revenue cutters
for the Great Lakes. Immediately I rose
in my place and offered as a substitute to
that bill, the bill introduced by Mr. Ma
guire providing for a cutter in our har
bor. While the fight, which was bound to
be successful, was in progress Mr. Ma
guire came in, and coming up to me, said:
"As this is my bill, and this is a Demo
cratic Congress, I ask you to withdraw
the substitute and let the bill providing a
cutter for the Great Lakes pass."
I had been in Congress longer than he
and I begged him to seize. this opportunity
to secure the cutter. He was insistent and
I was forced, as the record plainly shows,
to withdraw the substitute. This bill subse
quently passed Congress and became a
law, but the record shows that Mr. Ma
guire was not present when it did pass.
Mr. Maguire has referred to the meas
ures providing for the preliminary sur
veys in connection with the obstructions
in the harbor of San Francisco. While I
am willing' to admit that Mr. ! Maguire
may have brought this matter before the
river and harbor committee, yet I know
that when the order of survey was made
in the Senate the language of it .very
much resembled a measure Introduced by
another party. â¢-â¢.'-: .;-â â â â¢â â 
He refers also to the resurvey of the
harbor, but the record conclusively proves
that that was commenced In 1892â the win
ter of IS92â before Mr. Maguire went to
Congress.
Then he refers to the postofflce appro
priation and the revision for the re-ex
amination of the Postoffice site. In rela
tion to that I will say that the Postofflce
appropriation for San Francisco was
made in 1886, before either he or I went
to Congress.
I would like to ask the people of Cali
fornia if there are not some questions
which to them are more important than
even the survey of San Francisco har
bor or the passage of any bill of a local
character. I would like to ask where the
party or parties which he represents
stand upon other questions at issue to
day. Are they trying to fool the people of
the State of California, or do they Intend
to carry out their promises when elected
to office? "
The old Democratic party has stood for
sound money and sound finance from its
inception. Another party has been
formed whose fundamental principles are
the grinding out of money from the
treasury irrespective Â«of amount and Ir
redeemable in character. Another party
calling itself the Free Silver Republican
party believes that every ill that flesh is
heir to can be healed by issuing 16 to 1
dollars. But I believe that this combina
tion of parties is for public plunder and
not for public principle.
Mr. Loud then referred to President
McKinlÂ»?y as follows:
McKinley is a Republican in full ac
cord with the Republican party recom
mending to Congress the legislation
which that body had enacted. The oppo
sition condemns the party, but applauds
its leader, commending him who Is almost
the party itself. The Democratic party
approves the acts of our President, but
attempts to strike from his reach the
very means by which these acts are per
formed, to remove from him the means
tbrouffh which the great work before this
nation to-day must be acomplished.
"Consistency, thou art a jewel!"
D. E. McKlnlay followed in a brief
address, In which he discussed the Is
sues of the campaign and predicted a
grand victory for the entire Republican
ticket on November 8.
NEEDHAM AND KYLE
CHEERED AT TULARE
Large Gathering Addressed by the
Apostles of Republicanism and
Prosperity.
TULARE, Oct. 14.â Hon. J. C. Needham,
Republican candidate for Congress in the
Seventh District, and^ Major C. W. Kyle
addressed a large and very enthusiastic
audience at Library Hall to-night. This
wuMhe first appearance here of the candi
date for Congress, and a most favorable
impression he made. He discussed fairly
and freely the questions at issue in this
campaign, and uttered no word of abuse
of his opponent.
"If elected to represent the Seventh Dis
trict," said he, "I will favor the fore
closure of the railroad debts if the road
does not make good its compact."
He defined clearly his position on the
tariff and money questions, and advocated
the immediate construction of the Nica
ragua canal. His mention of President
McKinley brought forth tumultuous ap
plause.
Major C. W. Kyle's speech was warmly
received and loudly applauded. Major
Kyie kept the large audience In good
k humor during the entire evening.
This was one of the most successful
meetings of the campaign. The Tulare
silver band entertained the crowd with
patriotic and stirring music. W. P. Rat
liff called the meeting to order and Judge
J. W. Davis of Tulare was chairman of
the evening. Judge Davis presented E. O.
Larkins of Visalia. who made a short ad
dress. Mr. Larkins was a delegate |o ...ie
convention which nominated Mr. weed
ham for Congress, and he assured the
nominee that though he favored the nomi
nation of A. J. Pilisbury, yet he, with all
Tulare Republicans, was heartily support
ing J. C. Needham for Congress, une
meeting closed with three cheers for
Needham.

AT HIS TOUCH
BOCKS YIELDED

A Klondike Nabob
Comes to This City.
WILLIAM LIGGETT'S LUCK
THREE TIMES HE STRTJCK GOLD
ON THE YUKON.
The Last Strike Netted Him Hun
dreds of Thousands in Nuggets
and Dust â His Ad
ventures.
On the train from Portland there will
arrive this morning in San Francisco one
of the most noted celebrities of the
Klondike. The man in question is VV il
11am Liggett, formerly the Partner of
Swiftwater Bill, but now an independent
ly wealthy El Dorado king, with hun
dreds of thousands of yellow money at his
command. He is a Quiet, unassuming
Croesus, with none of me swagger of
Swiftwater Bill in his composition and a
deep-seated aversion to notoriety.
Liggett is just out from Dawson, hav
ing reached Seattle four days ago. He
has had an adventurous nine years' ca
reer In Central Alaska and the British
Northwest Territory, which reads very
much like a romance. The facts as given
are gleaned from one of Liggett s com
rades in Alaska.
In the spring of 1889 Liggett entered the
Yukon Valley for the first time, packing
his supplies on his own back over the
Chilkoot Pass. He was a farmer's son,
from Buchanan, West Virginia, but it did
not take him long to secure a profitable
placer claim on Forty Mile Creek, where
Kold-digging had just commenced. Later
he made an adventurous trip with the
Frank Leslie Exploring Expedition across
the heart of unknown Alaska to the
Tanana River. The next year he located
a claim on Birch Creek and cleaned up
$7000 at the end of the first season. Tak
ing this money with him, he went back
to Buchanan, West Virginia, and salted
It down in real estate. Then he went
back to the Yukon for more, and trying
Miller Creek this time secured another
JtiOOO. Out he came with this gold, again
salting his profits down in West Virginia
and for a third time returned to the
Yukon. "You see. I knew a good thing
when I saw it," remarked Liggett one
day, "and I thought that where national
banks were lying around loose, was a
suitable place to be. I intended to stay
by Alaska until I had secured a fortune
if it took twenty years."
When the Klondike gold was dicovered
Liggett was back on his Miller Creek
claim. Hearing of the discovery after a
lapse of several weeks, he abandoned hia
claim and about $1200 worth of tools and
provisions and on thirty minutes notice
started down the Yukon for Dawson.
When he arrived there all of the good
claims were staked. Liggett was not to
be left in the cold, however. He sped
up Bonanza and finally El Dorado creeks,
inspecting the various shafts. Reaching
No. 13. El Dorado, he jumped down the
shaft, hastily glanced at the pay-streak,
which had just been uncovered, and then
turning to the owner of the claim offered
him $40,000 for it. No such price had been
named up to that time for the choicest
land on the gulch and it was instantly ac
cepted. Liggett was given an hour in
which to make his offer eood. He had
but $48 in his pocket, but he was a "rus
tler," and quickly found a friend to whom
he made successful application for a $5000
loan. Skipping back to the claim he
handed the $5000 in dust to the owner and
then made a bargain that the remaining
$35,000 should be paid within thirty days,
and in default the $6000 was to be forfeited
and the claim surrendered. Two hours
later Liggett had secured Swiftwater Bill
and two other partners to assist him
in mining on the claim. The four of them
worked night and day. in shifts of two
and two, never stopping until twenty
seven days had elapsed, when they had
the remaining $35,000 in hand and paid it
to their creditor. Liggett had reserved

a controlling interest in the property and
continued to work it. It soon developed
that No. 13 was good for $2500 to the
linear foot of the pay-streak and as the
streak was just 500 feet In length, there
was a cool million and a quarter in sight.
Recently Liggett sold his undeveloped
part of the claim for a handsome figure
and taking the money which he had al
ready dug out, started for the States to
enjoy his fortune. He figures upon being
a banker.
STATE FAIR A SUCCESS.
The Agricultural Society Clears Six
Thousand on the Enterprise.
A statement has been made showing
that the State Agricultural Society has
reduced its indebtedness by about $7000.
This lessening of the society's liabilities
Is due to the skillful management of
those who arranged in detail the State
Fair recently held at Sacramento, and is
highly gratifying to those concerned.
Secretary Edwin F. Smith of the asso
ciation is among those who are jubilant
over the fact that the last racing meet
was crowned with success instead of fail
ure. He said:
"It was a matter of surprise to us all
when we found that instead of increasing:
our debt we had lessened It by the fair.
From $28,000 we have dropped the debt to
about $21,000. that is, in round numbers.
In consideration of the hard times we
proposed the curtai..ng of all expenses,
and to the economical expenditure of
money we attribute our profits. The re
duction In expenses amounted to $2500, and
we fell short about an equal amount on
our gate receipts. Our privileges yield
ed us $4000 or $5000 clear coin, and the re
duction of entry lists saved us some
thing more."
Mr. Smith was elected presiding judge
at Ingleside for the coming season by
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club yesterday.

DEMOCRATS AT SILK'S HAXL.
The Job Chasers Hunting Votes in
the Thirty-Fifth District.
Ther--> was a meeting of the clans at
Filk's Hall at Precita avenue and Mission
street last night, at which the rank and
file of the Democracy of the Thirty-fifth
Assembly District attended. In addition
to the. regular army from the base of
IV-rnal Heights the Democratic nominees
from all parts of the city put in their ap
pearance dressed in their finest, with pol
ished shirt fronts, which distinguished the
lib chasers from the honest and hard
â working men who came to hear them,
liut who will not vote the ticket.
Jefferson B. Martinet presided, and in
his first essay made the unpardonable
blunder of introducing John Patrick Dunn
as th.c nominee for State Controller. Mr.
Dunn, however, set the young president
right by informing the audience that he
â was a candidate for member of the
Hoard of Equalization. This much neces
sary information having been imparted
):h proceeded to praise the great old party
for its past good acts.
Dr. Clinton followed with a long eulogy
en the party and its nominees. He cited
the many virtues of Single Tax Jimmy
(Maguire), Hefting Jimmy (Phelan), Cen
tipede. Jimmy Barry), and did not stop
mull he had gone over the entire list of
nominees, all of whom are saints.
In comparing the qualifications of Dr.
jM'dg-e for the office of Assessor as against
I John D. Siobe, he said that Slebe was af-
Jlicted with a most dangerous maladyâ
that of optical delusion, which at certain
periods blurred his eyesight and at others
made him see the smallest objects. The
periods at which these afflictions beset
liim was about the springtime, or in the
early part of the month of March. Then
lie could not see a corporation building
or a moving railroad train, but when his
bight became restored he could observe
the smallest sized sewing machine in a
poor man's 'â  m. As a physician he
would prescribe for Mr. Siebe'a ailment
sndwoula not charge him one cent for
the same. It was restâ perpetual restâ
from office duties, and as a friend he
asked the co-operation of ail those pres
ent to_ assist- In giving Slebe that needed
rest after the Bth of next month

the meeting were; t. F. Bonnet. John H.

HENRY S. MARTIN, Republican Nominee for Sheriff.
Of the many candidates who will seek the suffrages of the peo
ple at the coming election none are better known or more popular
than Henry S. Martin, nominee for Sheriff on the Republican ticket.
He has for more than a decade been grand treasurer of the Native
Sons of the Golden West, and as such has endeared himself to the
heart of every member of that great organization. His popularity
is equally as great outside the order, and it is confidently asserted
that his majority on election day will be sufficiently large to leave
no doubt as to the quality of the esteem in which he is held by the
whole people.
his own satisfaction, but he got through
with the job after a fashion and the of
fice chasers made their bows.
First on the list was Mayor Phelan.
â¢who told a story in which he described
Judge Mogan as having been on the po
lice bench a. great many years, and then
helped himself to some of the glory that
has been showered upon Maguire by
claiming to have assisted him In draft

the crowd was good-natured and gave
the Mayor a nice reception.

TO INJURE A CANDIDATE.
Graham Discovers Cards Not Bearing
the Union Label.
Thomas P. Graham, the Republican
candidate for Police Judge, says he has
been placed in a false position before the
public by some one to him unknown. In
the party platform is a clause by which
all of its candidates promise to have their
campaign printing done by a union print
ing office, the evidence of their keeping
their promise being that their cards, etc*
shall bear the union label.
"I found a lot of cards bearing my name
as a candidate," said Graham yesterday,
"from which the union label had been
omitted. All of the cards that I have had
printed have come out of union shops and
bear the label of the union. The cards

of which I speak were not ordered by me
nor was any one authorized to have them
printed. I would hate to think that any
of my political opponents would stoop to
euch a trick as to have printed and dis
tributed cards bearing my name but not
the union label, but, nevertheless. It does
look as though some one was taking this
method of fdvlng me a rap and injuring
my cause with the labor union people. I
am In full sympathy with the cause of
union labor. In fact I am a member of
a labor union to-day. For ten years I
worked in the Pacific Rolling Mills, and
am still a member of the Amalgamated
Iron Workers' Union."

Merchants' Reform Club.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Merchants' Political North End Reform
Club was held at Irwin Hall, 410 Kearny
street, last evening.
President J. H. Irwin, who is a large
property owner on Kearny street north
of Pine, reported that he had done all in
his power with the Board of Supervisors
to induce them to hasten the completion
of th? Hall of Justice. The intercession
of himself and his co-workers had not
met with success, as the present condition
of the structure showed.
John T. Kidd, the well-known architect,
showed clearly that the work had been
delayed without any probable cause. Sev
eral speakers followed in the same strain.
The consensus of opinion among the Dem
ocratic members of the club is that they
will not vote for any self-nominated can
didate on the local Democratic ticket.
Officers were elected for the ensuing
year as follows: J. H. Irwin, president
(re-elected); M. J. Hart, vice-president;
M. F. Donleavy, recording secretary (re

tary; J. Catania, treasurer; Wellington
Sullivan, sentinel.

The Independent Municipal Club held

at which the different candidates would
appear and address the club on the issues
of the day. The committee reported that
all arrangements had been perfected for

at Odd Fellows' Hall on Monday evening,
October 17. Charles S. Patton, Mayor
Phelan, Julius Kahn and James H. Barry

WANTS TO SEE GAGE ELECTED.
Master Harold Maguire Is Opposed
to His Father m Politics.
Out In the Humboldt Primary School
the boys have organized a Gage Republi
can Club, and Harold Maguire, son of
James G. Maguire, the Democratic nomi
nee for Governor, is its president.
One of the brightest boys in the school
Is Master Harold. He is first in his class,
the leader in sports, and molds the poli
tics of his fallow-pupils. The boy comes
honestly by his love for a good, woll-con
tested campaign, as his father has been
in politics for nearly a generation.
There is a split in the Maguire camp,
however. The father, as before stated, is
an ardent Democrat, for the time being,
â while the son is an avowed Republican
and a stanch supporter of Henry T. Gage.
Harold is a Gage man, or, more correctly
speaking, a Gace boy, first, last, and all
the time, and candidly admits that he
would like to see his father beaten In the
gubernatorial race.
Before vacation Harold went to school
daily with two Gage buttons In the lapels
of his coat, and now says he will con
tinue wearing them until his candidate
has been chosen Governor of the State.
Harold loves his father dearly, but i I
opposed to him In politics and expects to
see him defeated when the votes are
counted in November.

by P. B. Nagle Jr. and was unanimously
adopted by the league:
Whereas, It is the desire of all citizens of

A. C. Berthier. the regular Republican nom
inee for the office of County Recorder Is a gen
tleman raised in this State and well known to

ness man. having been for many years In the
real estate business In our city and is a prop
erty-owner and taxpayer; and whereas, Mr.
Berthier was educated in the public schools
of our city and la a graduate of Santa Clara
College, and in all respects would make a
efficient official, therefore be it
Resolved, That we. the Municipal Reform
League, do hereby endorse the said A. C. Ber
thier for County Recorder of San Francisco.
Many kind words were spoken in favor
of Judge Troutt and the members will
make an individual effort to secure his
re-election, it being claimed that honest
and capable Judges should be on the
bench, especially in the Probate Depart
ment of the Superior Court.
The meeting then adjourned until Sat
urday.

Scientists Arrive.
Professors W. J. McGee and W. H.
Holmes of the Smithsonian Institution are
guests at the Palace. They represent
two Governmental departments of the
Institutionâ Professor McGee the Bureau
of American Ethnology and Professor
Holmes the National Museum.
"We are out here," said Professor Mc-
Gee last~evening, "to examine into the
condition of the Pacific Coast Indian
tribes and look up Indian antiquities, and
shall leave here to-morrow for James
town, Sonora and the Surrounding coun
try. Then we go to Los Angeles, where
we separate. Professor McGee to visit
the Pueblo Indians of Arizona and New
Mexico and I to go southward and take
a long horseback trip through South
western Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. We
shall probably return home together in
about two months."
The Cost of Freeing Cuba.
The United States are. certainly entitled to
retain possession of the Philippine Islands If
the peace commissioners so decide, for the cost
of the war runs far into the millions, and the
end Is not yet. The money paid out reaches an
astonishing total. To free the stomach, liver,
bowels and blood of disease, however. Is not an
expensive undertaking. A few dollars Invested
in Hostetter's Stomach Bitters -will accomplish
the task easily. The poor as well as the rich
can afford It,

"I have used Ripans Tabules and they have done me lots of
good, at least my wife says they have." asserts William Donaldson,
a blacksmith. "After a hard day's work I would eat too much, I
guess," continued he, " and suffer like everything. : My wife's brother
-told. me that Ripans Tabules had helped him and he thought they â 
would help me. I believe they have cured me, but I still take them
tegular, for I would not have them pains again for anything. My
partner said, after I was so much better, that I was ready to get well .
anyhow, and that I would have got well without them. I believe
there are lots of people that are ready to get well just like I was.
They will get well when they take the same medicine I did, and not
before. I have worked hard all my life, first on a farm and then in a
blacksmith shop, and have been troubled with dyspepsia ever since I
was 18 years old. Now I feel like I was sweet sixteen. I think

TALKING TOO MUCH-
rOR talking too much the parrot was denuded
of its feathers, a San Francisco Chinese was
shot by a tired auditor, and now Chaplain Mc-
Intyre of the Oreyon has been sentenced to loss of
his position. Ultimately the human mind may begin
to grasp the value of silence, for surely the human
mind is acute as that^of a parrot, and the bird caught
on quickly enough.
The sentence passed upon the chaplain will be re
:d by the public as severe. It is not plain why he
should have been singled out for condign rebuke
when so many others have kept their jaws on double
time ever since the opening shot at Santiago. The
Rev. Mr. Mclntyre's mistake was not in telling an
untruth, but in telling the truth, and expressing it in
- of frankness not calculated to soothe the savage
breast of glory-hungry warriors of the sea.
had been on board the Oregon during
the battleship's wonderful journey and while its guns
were thundering at the Spanish fleet. Chaplain Mc-
Intyre naturally thought the Oregon was doing it all.
Thinking so did no harm. The expression of opinion
wrought only sentimental damage. Every citizen has
a clear right to consider his own wife the best in the
1. and it would be a queer sort of a neighbor who

There is a supposition that this country is pos
the precious boon of freedom of speech.
Mr. Mclntyre will be excused if he is inclined to
doubt it.
c BETTER FERRY SERVICE.
A QUICKER, mure frequent and more com
us ferry service between this city and
Oakland has long been desired, and seems at
last about to be realized. Flans proposed by the
Realty Company of Oakland, recently published by
The Call, give promise of a competitive ferry system
which will not only be in itself an improvement on
the existing line, but will force the present monopoly
to make improvements also.
It is clear that until competition is established the
Southern Pacific Company will do nothing to make
their firry service adequate to the requirements of
the two cities. It is equally certain that when com
petition is assured the demands of the people will re
ceive attention at once. These facts have been demon
strated by what has occurred in the San Joaquin Val
ley since the construction of a competing road there.
A competing ferry line will, therefore, work a double
good for the people <>:i both sides of the bay. inas
much as it will not only furnish a new service, but
compel the improvement of the old one.
Several projects for ferry competition have been
put forward of recent years, Inn have failed for lack
of capital sufficient to fight the aggressive opposi
tion of the Southern Pacific. This time there seems
to be abundant capital back of the enterprise to make
it successful. The company has been doing business
in ( hikland for six years and has acquired large prop
erties there. It owns seven of the street railways,
some 4000 acres of land adjoining the city, and has at
Emeryville, where the terminus of the proposed ferry
line will be. upward of 200 acres of land, including an
ample water front for all purposes.
With this property in hand it will be seen the new
company will be in a position to make its ferry ser
vice convenient to all parts of Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley. At the Emeryville terminus connections
will be made with the various railway lines, so that
passengers can be distributed swiftly to any part of
the city or its suburbs, and the time required for the
trip to and from San Francisco will be largely re
duced.
It goes without saying the new company will be
fought by the Southern Pacific as all others have
been fought It will, therefore, depend upon the at
titude taken by the people and the authorities of Oak
land whether the project will be hastened to a prompt
completion or delayed for years.
Owing to the shoal waters on the other side of the
bay a ferry service is not to be easily obtained. A
long mole will have to be constructed and consider
able capital invested before any returns can be ex
pected. That a profitable return will be gained in the
end can hardly be doubted. San Francisco and Oak
land have already reached proportions that justify
the maintenance of two ferry lines, each superior to
the one now operating. If fair play is given the
projectors of the enterprise now under way, the
benefits will be great, and it is to be hoped Oakland
will not permit the Southern Pacific or its agents to
prevent a consummation so much to be desired.
All that Aguinaldo needs in order to hang himself
b a supply of rope, and Manila is a good place for
rope.
(\ SOCIAL TRAGEDY AVERTED.
THE incident has passed as a news feature, but
is subject to comment in its relation to the
function of journalism. The Call was for a brief
space the recipient of unfriendly criticism, which was
probably the source of profit to the evening papers
which printed it, because it made timely exposure of
the machinations of an adventurer who had pushed
his shape and veneering of manners to the verge of a
matrimonial union, which would have been advanta
geous to him, but infinitely distressing to its beautiful
and wealthy victim and humiliating to her family and
friends.
We were careful to avoid that sensational treatment
of the matter to which its dramatic and revolting fea
tures were a temptation that sensational journalism
would not have resisted, as we preferred to apply to it
the severely judicial manner in which The Call treats
all things of human interest.
Our object was not only to prevent a grievous
social tragedy and the sad wreck of a personality en
dowed with every endearing quality that shines as a
refined example, but to make San Fra.:cisco an un
profitable field for the operation of other adven
turers who may find it convenient to ply their arts
under the mask of an assumed name, used to cover a
life led in defiance of morality and honor.
Women are peculiarly susceptible to abuse through
their affections, and all good men, in memory of their
mothers, owe to the world a duty in the exposure
and the punishment it brings of men who adopt this
abuse as at trade profitable to themselves and destruc
tive to their victims.
The Call is glad to have been the means of that
moral sanitation which has made all homes within its
influence safer from a risk that is more appalling than
a physical pestilence. Ills of the flesh may be treated
and cured, and physical health, and life's enjoyment
that goes with it, may be restored and the havoc of
disease so repaired that it leaves no trace and is for
gotten. Not so with those wounds of the spirit,
those set sorrows which are inflicted by the sinister
adventurer who has counterfeited with a cold heart
the sincerities of affection, which have but one pure
fountain, and that in the upright character and honor
as stainless as a star.
The case which we have treated from a desire to
protect the innocent and guard the community from
sinister invasions in the future is not so singular as
to warrant any other feeling on the part of those who
have been rescued from impending ruin than grati
tude for their escape. Their position is no way dif
ferent from what it would be had any other form of
peril and disaster been avoided by timely warning
and friendly caution.
What passing humiliation may have come is not re
membered by others, who, looking into the peace and
happiness that brighten their own homes, feel more
sure that t+iese are to continue unbroken by the in
vasion of the plotting schemer.
Life has sorrows and separations, cares and bur
dens enough in the natural order without the intro
duction of these tragedies which blight and tarnish
all within their influence. â¢
The purpose of The Call is accomplished, and
hereafter in all homes the danger signal we set flying
wili be remembered, and momentous issues of life,
which must always be, will have in their decision that
proper caution and sleepless vigilance upon which
future happiness and contentment must depend.
From all sides have come commendations;
fathers and mothers have expressed their gratitude,
and young women whose graces and gifts might mark
them as tbe spoil of the adventurer have not repressed
their expressions of approval. In some of its aspects
the duty we have discharged was not pleasant; in
others it had certain elements of risk and danger.
Rut none of these deterred us in its timely discharge
and we are content with the result.
c DESERVED RENOMINOTION.
DR. W. J. HAWKINS has well merited from the
Republican party the compliment of a re
nomination for the office of Coroner, and ha?
an equal claim upon the county at large for the
honor of a re-election. His administration of the office
has been not only faithful and honest, but thoroughly
efficient, and it would be an act of political folly for
the voters to reject a man of approved worth when
an opportunity is afforded of continuing him in the
public service.
The record of Dr. Hawkins' management of the
Coroner's office is made the brighter by contrast with
that of the management in times past. Under his
administration there have been no scandals either di-
rectly or indirectly associated with the office in any
branch of its work. Every duty imposed upon him
has been fulfilled with an unsullied integrity and con
spicuous success. He has been called upon to deal
with upward of seventy-five cases a month, and
among those which came before him during his pres
ent term were several of extraordinary nature, such
as those of the Durrant murders, and yet in no single
instance has he failed in any particular to accomplish
all that the law and the public welfare required of his
office.
A success so complete in itself and so notable by
contrast with the inefficiency or worse of former
Coroners is a clear evidence that Dr. Hawkins has
not only an honest fidelity in his work, but a special
aptitude for its duties. This aptitude has been in
cieased by the studies and the experience of his pro
fession. A graduate of the medical department of the
University of California, his learning and his skill
as a physician have been of great service in the
Coroner's office, and have enabled him to satisfac
torily solve many problems that would have been
hopelessly bungled by a less competent man.
Dr. Hawkins is one of those Native Sons who have
taken a keen and public spirited interest in civic af
fairs. He has not neglected the general good in his
devotion to his private fortunes. His rank in his pro
fession is attested by the fact that although still a
young man he has been chosen to fill the important
position of lecturir on physiology in the medical de
partment of the university. He is, therefore, one of
those men whom independent citizens desirous of
capable administration in all branches of our local
government should take delight in supporting. His
past four years of office have proven his worth, and
his re-election should be made by a majority so large
p.s to show that the people of San Francisco appre
ciate the services of men who, like him, have honesty,
brains, energy and civic patriotism.
There seems to be a determination that when Gen T
erals Ezeta and Letona meet they shall have a fight
to the death. The fact that neither gentleman has the
slightest idea of resorting to violence has been given,
but no trifling circumstance like this is permitted to
interfere. Several reporters have determined the
encounter shall take place. Either their reputation for
veracity must suffer, or there must be a scrap. The
sojourners from Salvador, ever ready to oblige, must
be in a quandary.
Yellow journalism's war against Shafter has reached
the stage of idiocy. It never had far to go in order
to reach that stage.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1898.
/CONSTITUTIONAL amendment No. 2 (known
I to the statutes as Senate amendment No. 10),
which proposes to authorize the people of
counties in this State, through Boards of Freehold
ers, to frame (jharters for their own government, is
objectionable on other grounds than that it provides
an entering wedge for Maguire's single tax. The
amendment is based upon the "home rule" prin
ciple â which if not carried too far is a good thing â
but besides throwing the farmers of the interior into
the hands of owners of personal property who might
desire at some future day to deprive them of their
lands, it opens the door to a system of laws which
would if enacted prove ridiculous.
In short, the amendment gives the counties more
home rule than they can reasonably ask, and cer
tainly more than on principle they should possess.
For instance, it is proposed to confer upon Boards of
Freeholders which may be chosen to frame county
government charters the right "to prescribe the man
ner and method by which all elections by the people
shall be conducted, and may, in addition, determine
the tests and conditions upon which electors, po
litical parties and organizations may participate in
any primary election."
Since the amendment provides that the charters so
framed shall not be subject to general laws upon the
same subjects, the clause quoted would authorize the
County Boards of Freeholders, as to their particular
counties to repeal the Australian ballot law or any
general primary act which might be passed by the
Legislature. The people of the State cannot sanc
tion any such grant of power as this with safety.
Ballot laws and primary laws ought to be general.
It would be absurd to have fifty-seven different ballot
and primary systems in California, yet Senate
amendment No. io throws the door open to such a
condition. If a particular Courthouse ring of a par
ticular county should desire to return to the straight
ticket system, all it would need to do would be to
capture a County Board of Freeholders and get the
matter before the people. The latter might not be
persuaded to adopt the change, but amid a multi
plicity of issues there is always danger of losing sight
of important ones, and the grant of power might lead
in many cases to turning back the hands of progress.
The Australian ballot system is now well rooted,
and it should be permitted to bear its full fruit.
Whatever good there is in it can only be got out of it
by enforcing and developing the system which it has
established.
Home rule for the counties is an excellent thing,
but in our judgment the framers of Senate amend
ment No. io have given them too much of it. The
counties do not for their own good government re
quire authority to control the manner of voting
within their limits at general and primary elections.
Neither will it subserve their interests to be allowed
*o adopt taxation systems. Legislation on both these
subjects may safely be left to the State, which in pass
ing general and uniform laws may best maintain the
interests of all classes. Amendment No. 2 (Senate
No. io) should be buried out of sight along with Ma
guire.
(\ SUGGESTION FOR PHELfIN.
WE hesitate to say anything concerning the
campaign of Mayor Phelan which will cause
our motives to be questioned, being desirous
of making only a dignified and conservative opposi
tion to his Honor's attempt to become boss of San
Francisco; but there is one suggestion which seems
so apt and appropriate that in the interest of good
government and the public amusement we are im
pelled to submit it for consideration.
Mayor Phelan, in our judgment, could help along
his vaulting ambition by giving an exhibition of his
"hefting" abilities at Metropolitan Hall. As a hefter
he is said to be the champion of the coast. True, he
failed to correctly heft the translated money bags of
ex-Treasurer Widber, but that single failure need
not destroy his reputation.
As boss of San Francisco Mr. Phelan will have to
do a great deal of "hefting," and it is entirely proper
that he should, before entering upon the discharge of
his duties in January next, demonstrate his abilities
before an audience.
This could be done at Metropolitan Hall, or if that
place is too small at the Mechanics' Pavilion. An
interesting feature of the exhibition would be the
hefting of the sack with which the Evening Bulletin
has been fixed. Of course this sack is not large.
TliÂ£ sheet is notoriously cheap and greedy, but the
introduction of the identical sack and a public exhi
bition of the Mayor's ability to tell by hefting how
much there is in it after Old Man Crothers had
counted it would constitute a pleasing and enter
taining spectacle.
TAKING AN ARTISTIC TUMBLE
IT is not easy to understand why an actress should
be required to tumble downstairs. She is human,
and therefore subject to bruises. She has bones
liable to breakage, and she has flesh over the bones,
else would she not be in the business of bumping
adown a rickety set of stage stairs.
Perhaps there is some value in knowing how to
fall, if fall one must, and to alight on the spots least
susceptible to discoloration aivi jar might be reck
oned a fine art. However, the man who would let go
all holds and yield himself to the law of gravitation
just to show how unscathed he could escape would be
considered foolish. It is well to know an antidote
for poison, but not to swallow the poison so as to
demonstrate the efficacy of the antidote.
Comparatively few people fall downstairs. There
is a decided preference for getting down some other
way. The landing is more satisfactory if not too pre
cipitate. Provided one is thoughtful enough to keep
sober and to avoid being kicked at the top of the
flight, there is little danger, and small need of prac
tice. However, there are suggestions brought up by
consideration of the matter. Let a scene be intro
duced showing a graceful and safe method of leaving
a car and touching the street ear first. Let the pub
lic have an object lesson in the glide resultant from
stepping upon a banana peel, the essential gyrations
following collision with the deadly wheelbarrow, the
proper angle to assume after having been met by a
bicycle. All these things would be picturesque, prac
tical and instructive. Nobody wants to know how to
tumble downstairs, but rather how to avoid doing so.
But the other experiences mentioned are parts of life
as we have to live it.
Soldiers who have enlisted and have been kept on j
duty near home may find comfort in the thought that
had they gone to Manila some would never have
come back. And even the glory won over there
does not seem to have been distributed in a satisfac
tory manner.
Howard Gould happens to be in a condition to
forfeit $5,000,000 if necessary for the privilege of ac
quiring a wife, and still have enough left to keep the
wolf from not merely the door, but to chase the ani
t mal off the premises.

THE SINGLE TAX
AND LABOR
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 13, 1898.
To the Editor of The Call: I have
read Mr. Pon y's statement of the
good things that will happen to the
people when they adopt the single tax
with considerable interest. As to the
first proposition, that it will cheapen
land, I think no one will try to combat
that statement, as land is always
cheaper where the tax rate is too high.
I think it would probably discourage
speculation so far as farmers are con
i n, â â >!. It takes cash to speculate or
gamble, whichever term you prefer,
and if the farmers had to pay all taxes
for State, county and school purposes
I rather think their available cash
would hardly be sufficient to speculate
with to any great extent. As to rais
ing the wages of labor I, as a working
man, am of the opinion that it will
raise the wages of labor provided it
will change the nature of the bosses
and make them want to give all the
profits of their business to their em
ployes. Otherwise they will continue to
want the biggest day's work for the
least money possible. It would probably
increase the net earnings of capital in
1 in certain lines by relieving the
same of its just portion of taxes. But
why single taxers or any one else ex
cept said capitalist should want to do
this I am at a losa to know. How it
would reduce farmers' taxes by making
them pay all the taxes is a conclusion
that only a aingle-taxer cou:d possibly
arrive at. In other words they propose
in diminish a quantity by increasing it.
Mr. Single Tax had better go back to
his arithmetic.
If it will make men live up to the
golden rule it will probably prevent
one man from living off the labor of
another, but this is not done to as great
an extent as some agitators presume.
As for collecting the single tax I hardly
see how they would do it, for they could
not sell the land for the taxes as cer
tainly no one would want to invest in
land just for the fun of getting taxed.

That the boys who have already voy

that had not they recei ed such supplies

of the food could not be eaten and was
thrown overboard.

OPENED TO A LARGE CROWD.
Holy Cross Fair Attracted Many Vis
itors to Native Sons' Hail
Last Night.
Native Sons' Hall bore a handsome ap
pearance last night, the occasion being
the opening of the Hn]y Cross fair. The
large hall was beautifully decorated, and
the booths and their pretty dwellers,
dressed as they were in white and colored
silks, made the interior take on a gala
appearance. The large gathering that
assembled was entertained by sweet mu
sic and by the amateur spielers who
stood outside the various booths appeal
ing for recognition. Pretty girls moved
through the throng gelling tickets for
raffles, each advertising her own as tho
only booth worth visiting. As there were
many booths In the hall and as they were
constantly crowded it was apparent that
their appeals were effective.
Before the close of the evening a large
number c* sales were recorded, and.
judging by the large number who gener
ously distributed money last night, tbe
charitable affair should be a success.
Mayor Phelan opened the fair with ap
propriate remarks, and during the even
ing an excellent orchestra furnished mu
sic.

the vessels were in collision.
The news was quickly sent to the Mer
chants' Exchange; â <! in a few minutes
the tugs Reliance and Aiert were on their
way to the scene. When they got to
Meiggs wharf the two vessels were lying
side by side as though nothing had hap
pened. The captains of both were ashore
and the mates would not accept the as-
Eistance of the tugs. Later, however, the
Lurline was towed to another anchorage.
The ship lost considerable paint; and me
Lurline was badly chafed, but apart from
that neither vessel suffered.
The triangular light for the Alviso-San
Jose freight and passenger business has
reached the acute stage. The steamer
trail Jose has been frozen out, and now
the F. M. Smith and Alvlso are rate-cut
ting in all direction The owners of
both vessels are in the fight to stay, and
"liorax" Smith says he will spend his
last cent before the F. M. Smith is taken
off the run. To show that he is in earnest
he yesterday completed a contract for a
year's supply of coal for his vessel.
The rival steamers and their passen
gers have lots of fun in the Alviso
slough. There is not enough room for
them to pass each other, and when one
secures all the passengers and freight
the other gets away first and generally
succeeds in sticking in the mud and
blocking the way. Then the rival comes
along and in order to reach San Fran
cisco has to pull the disabled boat off the
mud. This happens once or twice a week,
and on each occasion the compliments
fly between the two crews. Things are
now about even up between the rival
steamers. The Alviso carries nearly all
the freight and the Smith nearly all the
passengers. In the meantime the South
ern Pucilic says nothing but saws wood.
The tug Rt-fimond met with an accident
in Oakland Cre<=>k the other day. While
going after a vessel that was in the mud
flats her propeller struck a sunken pon
toon and every blade of it was snapped
oft. .Another tug had to be sent to tow
her back to San Francisco, and she is
now on the California drydoek for re
pairs.
I'at McAvoy, employed at the Angel

not, so the cars jumped the track and one
of the eels went over McAvoy - foot
as he lay on the ground. A big 250-pound
bowlder struck him a glancing blow on
the chest, but luckily only bruised him.
McAvoy was taken across the island to

There was a lively little election row
on the water front yesterday. J. Keene,

over the hoad of P. Sweeney, a solicitor
for McPherson and Rucker. Sweeney's
hat was ruined, but Keene's age saved
him from a thumping-. The latter is long
past the three score and ten mark but
is hale and hearty, while Sweeney Is mid
dle-aged. They met near Isom-street
wharf yesterday morning and began dis
cussing the various candidates for office!

the old man. "You are one of his flun

SUSPECTED OF
ROBBING THE
DEAD WOMAN
Mrs. Barry's Friend
Can't Be Found.
PAWNED HER DIAMOND RING
HEB HUSBAND WILL BEACH
THE CITY THIS MOBNING.
t
The Police and Coroner Believe That
the Woman Drank Herself
Into an Untimely
Grave.
The police are uslnp every effort to
find the young man who lived with Mrs.
K. Barry at S Anthony street, but so far
without success. A description of him has
been sent broadcast and his arrest ia
only a question of time. He is described
as about 5 feet 5 inches tall, thick set,
with stubby hair on his upper lip, of me
dium complexion, dark eyes, s;illow, and
looks like an opium Bend.
Yesterday morning Pawnbroker Frank
lin, on Dupont Btreet, near Suiter, vis
ited Captain Bohen and informed him
that a young man answering the descrip
tion Of Mrs. Harry's friend, called at his
store Thursday night and pawned a dia
mond ring for $15. He gave his address
as 8 Anthony street, and signed thÂ« name
Of Mrs. Barry on the book. Franklin re
quested him to sign his own name also
and be wrote "John Lambert."
It is supposed that when the young
man returned to the house late Wednes
day night he found that the body bad not
yet been discovered, so he took the dia
mond ring and other jewelry and what
money she had left, as her purse was
found empty on the bed.
The police believe that the young man
\h Alexander Donovan of Sacramento,
and are working on that theory. It is
n that he left Sacramento with her
for this city.
Captain Kohen thinks that the woman
drank herself to death. She was suf
fering from consumption, and Dr. (Jal
lagher, the autopsy physician, is satisfied
that death was due to natural causes,
but the contents of the stomach will be
analyzed to satisfy the police.
"The woman was an opium fiend," said
Captain Bohen yesterday. "We have that
from Winnemucca, Nevada, where she
and her husband are well known. She
drank heavily, there Is no doubt of that.
I don't know who the young man is,
whether Alexander Donovan or not, but
from his description i should say that he,
too, was an opium fiend. It is probable
thai the two went on a debauch together,
us no one seems to have seen them from
the time they went to the house till the
woman died. Then when he found she
was dead the temptation came to him
to rob her."
Captain Bohen received a dispatch yes
terday from the dead woman's husband
st:iting that he would reach the city to
day, and would like to take the body
back with him to Paradise Valley to be
burled there.
CAME FROM SACRAMENTO.
Mrs. Barry Said to Have Been Very
Fond of Young Donovan.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 14.â Mrs. Alexan
der Donovan, whose husband is a chirop
odist here, says she became acquainted
with Mrs. Barry shortly before her mar
riage in Reno, and that ever since Mrs.
Barry had visited her every year. She
said Mrs. Barry arrived here on Septem
ber 11 last and stopped with her until a
week ago yesterday, when she left for
San Francisco with Alexander Donovan,
nephew of Mrs. Donovan's husband. Said
Mrs. Donovan:
"She had been sick all summer with a
severe cold, and when I saw her last she
was not feeling well. It was at her re
quest that young 1 Donovan accompanied
her to Sun Francisco. A few days pre
vious to their leaving, he remarked that
he was going to San Francisco to look
for employment, and Mrs. Barry, in my
hearing, asked him to wait for a few
days and go with her, as he could save
her a great deal of walking by assiHt
ing her to get a room and looking after
her luggage. He said he would assist
her, and that is how he came to go away
with MrH. Barry.
Mrs. Donovan said Alexander was very
fond of Mrs. Barry. During the summer
he worked for her husband in Paradise
Valley, Nev. His parents are dead, and
he was his own boss.
Mrs. Donovun exhibited a letter from
Mrs. Barry, wherein she told how sick
she was. adding an inquiry as to Alexan
der's n-turn. sending her regards to him
and hoping that he would be feeling good
when she visited them, so they could have
some fun.
Mrs. Donovan disclaims all knowledge
of young Donovan's whereabouts, and
aays Mrs. Barry was in no way related
to any of them except as a friend.

To Prevent Frauds.
Registrar Blggy has determined upon
an important change in the method of
counting the votes in the next election.
Numbers will not be used on the tally
sheets. Instead, the inspector will call
out the names of candidates voted for,
as they appear upon the ballots. The old
time custom was for the inspector to call
out the numbers of the successful can
didates. This left an opening- for fraud,
as few of the persons In the voting
booths could tell from the numbers
whether candidates were credited prop
erly by the inspector.

FRIENDLY HAND FOR HAWAII.
The Islands Invited to Join the State
Board of Trade.
J. A. Filcher, 4 manager of the Califor
nia State Board of Trade, has written a
long letter to the editor of one of the
papers in Honolulu asking him to use
his influence in promoting the project of
making an exhibit of the manufactured
and natural products of the islands with
the California exhibit in this city. Mr.
Filcher sets forth that the objects of the
board are for the purpose of promoting
the Interests oÂ£ this State and inducing
immigration of the better class of citi
zens of the East. Much good has been
accomplished and much more good is sure
to result from the efforts of the body.
Mr. Ftlcher states that since the an*
nexation many inquiries have been made
by people in the East looking to the 'isl
ands for an opportunity to make invest
ments or establish homes. The board has
not been able to furnish all the data
asked for.
The invitation is extended to the islands
to become members of the board, the
offer being to admit the new Territory on
the same terms and conditions as though
it was one of the counties of this State.
It was suggested that this could be ef
fected by interesting the Hawaiian Bu
reau of Agriculture In the subject. In
conclusion the writer says:
It is possible that this board may send a
representative to the Islands some time this
winter for the purpose of acquiring some of
the information and data of which we stand in
need, and Incidentally arranging to cement

MATRIMONIAL AGENCY DUPE.
Mis. Grace Allison Wanted on the
Charge of Felony Embezzle
ment.
Another victim of Mrs. Grace Allison,
the "rich widow" of Bain's matrimonial
agency, swore to a complaint In Judge
Mogan's court yesterday for her arreat
on the charge of felony embezzlement. He
is Frederick Slick, an old man, employed
at the Union Iron Works.
Shek became a member 01 the agency
in August last and was introduced to Mrs.
Allison. After a few interviews he pro
posed marriage and was accepted, giving
her a diamond engagement ring, for
which lie paid $175. When the time for
the marriage came round Mrs. Allison
made the excuse that she had to go E;ust
to attend to very Important business, but
on ber return she would make him happy,
lie waited and then called upon her
again. This time the excuse was that
her physician was attending to her eyes,
and he would have to wait for a while
longer. Finally he became convinced that
he was being made a fool of and de
manded the return of the engagement
ring, which Rhe refused. Now he wants
her arrested for felony embezzlement.
Liquor Copyright Suits.
The United States of America brought
suit yesterday in the United States Dis
trict Court against M. Cronan and George
Wisseman of Sacramento for $500 damages
for infringement of copyright on the la
bels of a certain brand of Angostura bit
ters and Holland gin.
In the United States Circuit Court
Boord & Son brought suit against John
Sroufe and Charles J. Crowell to perpetu
ally enjoin them from Infringing on the
copyrignt of a liquor label or from using
the device of a cat standing on a barrel.
In the same court Jacques R. M. Hen
nessy and others filed an action against
Sruufo and Crowell for infringing a
brandy label bearing the word Hennessy
and a device representing a mailed arm
and a battle-ax.
Hanged Himself.
The dead body of an unknown man was
found hanging to a tree in the Butro
woods near Lake Honda yesterday after
noon by Victor Sartorl, the cook at the
Almnhouse. The deceased was dressed as
a laborer, wearing a worn brown coat
and vest and a cheaj? pair of striped
trousers. From the appearance of the
body he had been dead four or five
months. A silver watch, a pair of spec
tacles and a knife were the only articles
found in his possession-
SENATOR AND
VALENCIA TO
SAIL TOGETHER
Both Vessels Should
Leave Tuesday.
WEEDING OUT THE UNFITTED
KANSAS CAPTAINS COULD NOT
MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE.
Presidio Finally Selected by Colonel
Middleton as the Site for
the General Military
Hospital.
The order assigning troops to the trans
port Valencia was issued from depart
ment headquarters yesterday. As pre
dicted in The Call earlier in the week, the
troops assigned are a battalion of the
First Washington and a portion of Bat
teries A ai.i L> of the California Heavy
Artillery. The Third Battalion of the
Washington Regiment, which has been
stationed at Angel Island, has been the
one selected to go on the Valencia. It is
composed of Companies F, G, 1 and L>,
under the command of Lieutenant Col
onel Fife. From the two batteries there
are 100 men and two officers to go.
Including the assistant surgeons and the
members of the Hospital Corps the Va
lencia will carry altogether 509 men, sol
diers and officers. No notification \va*Â«
sent the troups yesterday to go aboard,
but it is expected to-day. The troops will
in all probability go on the transports on
Monday, and the Senator and the Va
lencia, will sail together. The Ohio and
Indiana will be ready the last of next
Week, and the Newport by the last of the
month. It Is generally conceded that
General Miller und his headquarters,
with a battalion, possibly from the Ten
nessee Keglment, wil sail on the .New
port.
The Pennsylvania and the Kio Janeiro
are expected to arrive any day. The lat
ter has a number of sick, soldiers aboard,
who are to be cared for at the Division
Hospital. Major Matthews stated yes
terday that he was prepared to take care
of tho men just as soon as they should
arrive. With these two transports in it
will hardly require over four more to re
move all of the troops that have been or
dered to the Philippines.
Major Field, Second Artillery, acting
inspector general, began the work yester
day of weeding out the undesirable men
from the Tennessee Regiment. When the
Tennessee Regiment was mustered in it
was already recruited up to the SI maxi
mum, and when the order came to recruit
up to 106 the regiment was about to start
for San Francisco, and under the circum
stances several hundred men were rapid
ly recruited without very close attention
being paid as to their desirability or iit
ness for soldiers. It is these men who
have been largely responsible for the
regiment's bud name, and it is the same
men that aro to be dismissed from the
service.
The board of officers apppointed to pass
upon the efficiency of Captains Towers
and Watson of the Kansas Regiment did
not meet yesterday. Colonel Funston
said yesterday regarding the fact of tho
two officers having been ordered before
the board, that there were no specific
charges against either of the captains,
but that they did not possess pufticieiit
ability to command companies and pre
serve discipline. Personally, the colonel
stated that he thought highly of both
officers, but that as he was responsible
for the discipline of the regiment it was
necessary to have men who could control
the men under them.
L.pon the application of Colonel Long
the following board of survey was ap
pointed yesterday for the purpose of as
sessing the damage to the transports that
are to be turned over to their owners by
the Government: Major S. F. Thorn,
First Lieutenant J. A. Lockwood, Fourth
Cavalry: and Second Lieutenant F. S.
Munn, Eighth California.
At last a site has been selected for the
general military hospital. Colonel Mid
dleton has finally decided upon the Pre
sidio as the best suited location, and
General Merriam has approved his selec
tion. The hospital is to be built upon
the present camp of the ThiTd Battalion
of the Twenty-third Infantry, which is in
close proximity to the Post Hospital.
In the Divorce Courts.
William Meakln has been granted a di
vorce from Louisa Meakin on the ground
of intemperance. Rose H. Vidaver has
been granted her application for a divorce
from Nixon J. Vidaver on the ground of
willful neglect. Mrs. B. Fromberg ob
tained an order yesterday compelling D.
Fromberg to pay her alimony in the sum
of $20 a month. Frederick T. Bond was
ordered to pay Annie A. Bond $2;> a
month alimony. Suits for divorce have
been filed by Ella del Monte against Tony
del Monte for desertion, Edward Kaut
mann against Frederika Kaufmann for
desertion, Millie F. Trimble against
Claude F. Trimble for desertion, George
W. Held against Mary Ann Reid for de
sertion Edward Milton Elkers against
Lillian Elkers for Intemperance and John
Fauser against Kate Fauser for cruelty.
The marriage of Malsum Nordstrum to
Annie Nordstrum has been annulled on
statutory grounds. Etta L Cabot has
been granted a divorce from John W. Ca
bot on the ground of willful desertion.
A School Girl's Battle.
From The Mall, Milford, Ind.
Miss Emma Bybolt, a prepossessing
school girl of Milford, Ind., is of more
than usual intelligence, and is ambitious
to rise in the literary world.
"In the fall of 1890," said Mrs. Rybolt,
"Emma was taken ill. She was a close
student and her work began to tell on her.
She grew weak, pale and nervous, and
complained of pains in her back, chest
and limbs. A few weeks passed and she
grow worse. The doctor said she was a
victim of nervous prostration, and should
have been taken from school weeks ear-
lier She gradually grew worse, her
nerves were so tense that the least noise
irritated her and she had a fever and a
continual twitching in her muscles. The
symptoms were much like St. Vltus'
dance. ÂÂ»
"A year
passed, and
under a

p h ysicians,
Emma be-
came some-
what better

day I read of
a case simi-
lar to hers
which was

Her Battle,

"Emma had no faith in proprietary
medicines but tried the pills and after
taking a dnzon doses, she began to im-
prove. It was about the first of April
when she began and by the middle of
May, ifter taking about eight boxes, sho
was entirely curfd.
"While ill sho lost twenty-eight pounds,
but now weighs more than ever before.
Her nerves are strong and she is in per-
fect health. We are all confident that Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People
cured her. and I cheerfully recommend
them in all similar cases.

REPORTS FROM
THE
FOOTBALL FIELDS
ThÂ© second game between the Olympics
end the University of California eleven
will be played to-day at the Recreation
Grounds. The season is in full blast,
and the air is permeated with football
talk â so much so that at the two colleges
there is but one subject worthy of con
sideration and that is the gridiron sport.
The public has now a chance to see
both the university teams in action and
to form comparative judgements. The
Olympics, the one team which has played
the California and Stanford elevens and
Buffered defeat at the hands of both, is
the minor premise from which the com
parative judgment is formed. Every
where is heard the question which is the
Stronger team, Stanford or California?
The answer to that is difficult. Neither
team is in a state of even approximate
perfection. Stanford has boon in train
ing but a. few weeks, and California not
much longer. The Olympics have not I
been in actual training ai all, that is as j
far as the playing of daily practice games j
1b concerned. When the University of
California eleven defeated the c}ub men
IT to 0 the enthusiasts raised their hands
and shouted that is the team. But the
following week Stanford defeated the
Olympics 23 to 0, and the shouters
changed sides. The Olympic Club's
strength is not a positive Quantity, and it
wil vary until the men have some other
team to plas against, so it cannot be a ,
true basis of judgment.
Stanford's team of last Saturday showed
Borne strong and some weak spots. The
backs are as yet unsteady, due no doubt
to the little practice they have had.
Fisher, Dole, Burmeister and Murphy
should develop Into a strong and effective
Quartet Murphy Is the sunn- fast run
ner, and he is difficult to equal on a
clear field. However, he seems to make
a clear Qeld every time he starts out,
and then the runner who can overtake
him must indeed be fleet of foot. Mur
phy's kicking is also very tine, and his !
general play Is full of the dash and spirit
that won him hi.-; place at quarter. Stun- |
ford has ends in Parker and Smith who !
are not only str"nK but who display a
knowledge of the frame which is the re- j
suit of experience. Both these men are
developing very Quickly, and before the I
end of the season they will, if they pro- j
grese at their present ratio, be towers
on the extremities of the line. Here !
Stanford's strength stops. At the pres- I
ent time there is a weakness in Stan- j
ford's line that will undoubtedly be dis- j
sipated as the season advances. The cen
ter, guards and tackles are compara
tively Inexperienced and will have to be ]
trained to their positions, but in this !
Stanford does not suffer to any greater j
extent than California; and It is this I
which gives California a favorable chance j
in the big game of the year.
California is not the team it has been
In former years. To discover this one i
needs only to see a single practice game j
on the campus. Where laxity, indiffer- !
enee and carelessness reigned before
there is now close interest, even enthu- (
slasm, among the players. The practice ;
games are full of ginger and earnest
work. Just as much pleasure may be de- !
rived from watching a game on the j
Berkeley campus as in seeing a match â¢
contest. This is no new thing at Palo :
AHo, but it is at Berkeley. Never before \
did a Becond eleven wearing- the blue !
and gold colors wurk as this one does. !
For the first time in the history of the
college there is really a spirit of com- '
petition among the candidates for the po
positions on the 'varsity, which are open I
to all with the exception of a very few
fixtures.
Cochran is putting his men through
all sorts of evolutions, some new and
come of the regulation order. It is very
likely that they will be used to-day
against the Olympics, and some surprises
â will be In store for the spectators. The I
team has been lining up with Klerfoot i
as quarter to replace Hopper, who is now
on the shelf with a lame knee. Hopper's
injury while not of a serious nature, will !
prevent his playing for some time. He I
â was fast developing into an exceedingly
good quarter, and played very well with
the other backs. It Is to be hoped that
he will soon be upon the field. Another
man who was laid off on account of an
Injury is GreJsberg, who Is not yet in
good shape. He strained a tendon and
the result was an absence from practice
lor about a week. He is scheduled to
play in to-day's game, however. Outside
of these two men the condition of the
men has been excellent. California has
engaged Al Lean, the well-known pro
fessional trainer, permanently. lie re
ceives a yearly salary, and will give all
of his time to the athletes of the uni
versity.
Coach Cross expressed himself as being
eatisfled with his men after the game
â which brought another cardinal victory
to Stanford. This week the work has im
proved at Palo Alto. There is not so
much of that carelessness that was noted
before Cross arrived. It is work and hard
â¢work on the football field there and the
men are gradually reaching the point
â where there will be grilling practice every
day. About the end of the coming week
the regulation full time play will begin
and from that time on to the end of the
season there will be nothing- but the hard
est kind of work.
The Olympics will be strengthened this
afternoon as far as individual playing is
concerned. Back of the line will be seen
once again the redoubtable Percy Morse,
perhaps the best back who has never had
a collegiate football training. He kept
away as long as possible, but when he
caw that the club team needed some
bolstering up and that things were going
to pieces he relented and is now one or
the Olympic team. Back of the line in
to-day's game there will be for the Olym
pic's: Code, quarter; Morse, right half;
Wilson, left half and Weldon, full back.
This quartet is the strongest the athletic
club has put In the field this year_ The
line has met with many changes and will
not be fortified to any great extent.
Bandy will still play center. The guards
â¢will be changed and herein lies the weak
spot of the Olympic line. It was the In
tention last night of the captain of the
clubmen to put Sexton at left guard and
Parker, a big 200-pound Hawaiian, as
right guard. Sexton is not In the best
of condition and Is a little weak for guard
â while the Hawaiian is an untried man'
Erskine will play left tackle and Sheehy
right tackle unless a subsequent change is
determined. The ends will be McLaln*
and McNutt. The weakness of the latter
In the game last Saturday was mountain
ous. All the long runs were made around
his end.
The freshmen teams are playing for
all there is in the game. There is every
Indication that the game this year be"
tween the freshman classes of both uni
yersities will be as pretty a contest as
the big game. Last Tuesday the fresh
men of the University of California de
feated the lightweight team of the Olym
pics on J he college cam . the same team
that defeated the Stanford freshmen two
weeks ago. There does not seem to be
much difference in the strength of the
two teams at this day. Both are playing
g-ood ball and the result should be a close
game when they meet two weeks from to-

HOW TO CATCH
THE
STRIPED BASS.
Anglers of this city who religiously
read The. Call for information concerning
a'pastime which affords enjoyment to
several members of the so-called gentle
! art fraternity were agreeably surprised
I on scanning over last week's s orting de
! partment to learn thnt tho near future
sport of the angler would be the hooking,
playing and the landing of the game
striped bass.
To the credit of the Deputy Fish Com
missioners, Messrs. Wilson and Cross, be
it said that through their untiring ef
forts the manner of capture of the bass
i lias been discovered in this bay. Wilson,
! with whom every angler of any note is
acquainted, has, for the past two years,
devoted much of his valuable time in re
search, lie has prospected for striped
bass in San Pablo Bay and in many of the
lagoons and estuaries indigenous to the
bay, but without any degree of success
until recently, when furtune finally
crowned his perae%-eranee and efforts.
In the last month Wilson has success
fully hooked and landed several large
i bass by means of trolling with a Wilson
spoon and still fishing. The latter method
I he, however, has proved to be the most
i successful. In a chat with the expert on
i bass n-shlng recently Mr. Wilson said:
"These striped bass are darned cunning
fellows, and unless you are well up in the
; game of hit and stick you will lose more
!ish than anglers generally care to part
: with. I've tried every known device for
1 their capture, and until within the last
' f^w weeks I have been literally off the
j track.
"1 had an idea that the striped bass
! and the black bass had similar ways of
i feeding, but those ideas have very ma
i terially changed -within the past few
! weeks. Experience, of course, teaches,
and through experience I have discovered
that the striped bass is at least 100 per
' cent a more artful cuss than his fresh
1 water brother, commonly known as the
black bass. Why, the striped bass will
dodge away from the shadow of a sea
; gull wing. The sound of an oar or the
I shadow of a boat will scare the striped
I crab and clam eater half out of its wits.
You can say without the least fear of
! contradiction that to be a successful fish
erman for anadromous bass you must
1 have great patience and use rirst class
', judgment in the selection of tackle and
also in the knowledge (which can only be
i gained by experience) of how to present
i your charm to his royal bass-ship.
"The striped bass will not acknowledge
i by touch any old thing. I have tried, all
manner of lures, but until of very recent
date 1 failed to hit upon tne morsel Mr.
Bass fancies most. A few weeks ago I
'â . learned that striped bass were being
i caught in the Oakland estuary by anglers
i who trolled with a spoon by the light of
, the moon. The fish taken, I afterward
ascertained, were of small size, yet oc
i casionally a big foljpw would book on
and as a rule clean out the midnight fish
erman completely of fishing gear.
"As I care little for moonlight fishing
! I will not dwell much on that subject, but
i from what little success I have had with
: the striped bass I will endeavor to give
: you an idea of what I consider the most
I successful contrivance for their capture.
In the tirst place I consider the ordinary
i stiff rod used for steelhead fishing good
I enough for Mr. Bass. A good reel which
i will contain 100 yards of strong line is in
dispensable. The hook, a No. 6, should
be of the very best material. I use a box
] swivel attached about twenty inches from
: the hook to the line and above the swivel
:Is my egg-shaped lead with a hole
i through its center, so that the line can
, run freely through it when the bass
â¢ strikes the bait and makes his first run.
The moment the fish starts on a run you
i must strike quick and hard, otherwise
i Mr. Bass will drop the bait the instant he

feels the hook, and your prospective sport
is over. I have found that clams are the
best lures for the capture of the striped
bass, but doubtless there are other tempt
ing morsels which they fancy and which
we anglers have not as- yet discovered.
"Henry Skinner, the well known fly
caster, has rigged up quite a number of
hooks and tackle, which anglers desirous
of bass fishing can see by paying him a
visit. Striped bass fishing on this coast
is yet in Its infancy, but in a year hence
I expect to see it the leading sport with
those who fancy angling in preference to
other pastimes/

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1898.
YACHTSMEN ARE
ENDING
THE SEASON
The directors of the San Francisco
Yacht Club at a meeting held last Mon
day decided to hold a minstrel entertain
ment in the clubhouse at Sausalito on
the evening of Saturday, October 29. A
committee of five was appointed to secure
performers and make the necessary ar
rangements. October 22 had been set as
the closing night, but, as the Corinthians
have their jinks on that date, it was
thought best to select a later day. The
entertainment will be for the benefit of
the club, which will provide transporta
tion back to San Francisco for those
who wish to return.
Vice Commodore O. T. S. W hite will
sail to El Campo to-morrow to witness
the Corinthian baseball game.
LaÂ«t Sunday several of the Corinthian
yachts went for an outside cruise, among
them being the sloops Clara, Speedwell

Miss Foster surprised her friends as well
as her opponent, winning out In two
straight sets, 6-4, 6-4. Miss Clark met Miss
Curry in the opening match of the second
class, the former winning two out of
three sets, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Then Miss Eisen

BASEBALL HINES
WILL NOW
DO BETTER.
There has been much speculation re
garding Mr. Mines, who some time ago
made his first appearance with the Ath
letics.
As every one knows, his initial attempt
on this coast was a most dismal failure,
yet every one does not seem to know that
Mr. Hines, up to the moment he entered
the box in that memorable slugging
match, had not touched a ball in over six
weeks, and was, therefore, necessarily in
capacitated from such really hard labor.
Those who have never played ball ex
tensively cannot conceive how -difficult it
Is for a player, especially a pitcher, to
throw a ball at all after remaining out of
the game any length of time. Just see
what pitchers have to do in the National
League preparatory to entering the league
race. Why, it takes some of them until
the middle of the season to be able to
pitch effectively. The New York team,
were it not for the fact that Rusie and
Meekin, their "star twirlers," and, I dare
say, two of the best in the league, take
from two to three months to put their
arms in proper shape, would, in my opin
ion, come very near winning the pennant
And the New York club fs not tne only
club handicapped in this manner. Every
club In the league has its troubles in this
respect, and, in view of this fact, fans
Bhould be considerate wlrti a pitcher like
Mr. Hlnes, who, as I said before, at
i tempted to work without conditioning his
i right bower.
All pitchers seem to be alike when it
comes to a proposition of this kind. I can
sympathize with Mr. Hint's sincerely, for
i" experienced a like drubbing not many
weeks ago in the town of Redding, but
was more fortunate than he, as my co
horts batted out a victory.
At the request of some friends, I at
tempted to pitch a game against the Red
ding team, and was. of course, out of con
dition, a* I had not touched a ball in
months. Those country b*ys took advan
tage of this fact, and just hammered my
I shoots in every direction. It was useless
for me to continue, as I had no speed or
control and would have been compelled
to retire had not my side by a batting
rally made enough runs to win tne
game, the score at the finish being 18 to
12 in my favor.
Now it was very foolish of me to have
ever tried to pitch a game with my arm
ptiff and sore from lack of work, and so it
was with Mr. Hincs. It was plain to see
that he worked poorly and was sadly out
of condition, and I would suggest that the
management of the Athletics crive n.m
another chance after he has practiced up
a bit, and I would wager, wore I sure he
took advantage of the time allowed him
to practice, that his record in the later at
tempt would be a glorious one.
It is unjust to criticize a pitcher like Mr.
Hines too severely. He was not given a
fair trial, and people should realize after
being informed, that it was impossible for
a man to pitch out of condition and that
Mr Hines took unto hlmseif a most diffi
cult task. He will surely do better on h.s
next venture. re 3t3 t assured CORBBTT ,
HOW TO DISCOVER A
CHAMPION MARKSMAN.
"Within the next few days It is likely
that a rifle match somewhat novel will
be arranged for the marksmen of this lo
cality. It Is what Is known as an indi
vidual championship match. In the East
such contests have proved to be very
popular, and every year sees such an
event In each of the big centers, such
as Cincinnati, Milwaukee and New York.
In these placea the proprietor of one
of the several ranges offers some kind
of a trophy f'>r the marksmen to shoot
for usually 100 shots, single entry. The
match Is held on the range of the one
niHkinir the best offer, the donor of the
prize being reimbursed for his outlay by
the business done at the refreshment
stand on the grounds.
When T>. W. McLaughlin was in the
East !)<â¢ observed the benefits of these
contests, and It Is he who suggested that
something of the kind be given here.
His suggestion was well received, and in
the course of a few days a number
of riflemen will hold a meeting to ar
range for one here. MeLaughlin is of the
opinion that Thanksgiving day would be
appropriate.
The benefits can be readily understood
by those familiar with the rifle history
of this State. The country is alive with
so-called champions of rifle shooting. In
every shooting organization two or more
have the good success of defeating the
other members of the club and win med
als on which the word "champion" is
inscribed. Ninety-nine out of a hundred
are not entitled to the title. The so-called
champions of some of the clubs are only
first-class men in other clubs. The good
to be derived from such a match as con
templated is that 100 shots would deter
mine who is "the" champion, and if many
who are now wearing champion medals
decline to enter Into such a competition
then they will be obliged to narrow their
claims down to being only high men in
their respective organizations. Another
benefit would be that it would bring to
gether in a match men who do not often
compete with each other under test con
ditions.

GREAT QUESTIONS OF THE WAR
In Next Sunday's Call.
GALA DAY FOR
OARSMEN
AT GUERNEVILLE
Probably never before in California has
a rowing regatta been held amid natural
surroundings so picturesque as the two
days' water carnival which begins to
day at Guerneville. The Russian River,
which runs between high banks through
magnificent forests of redwood, has been
dammed so as to create a lake about one
and a half miles long, and broad enough
to permit three boats to be rowed abreast.
While the surface is calm and unruffled,
the water still has enough current to give
it life. Lake Bohemia is overlooked by
banks which slope down to the water's
edge and command a clear view of the
whole course. Its smooth waters are
most favorable to shell rowing, which is
almost impracticable in the rough waters
of San Francisco Bay, and is at all times
rendered difficult by strong tides.
The Uuerneville Improvement Company ;
has taken great pains for the comfort of
visitors. A grand stand, capable of seat- j
ing from ftOt) to ltxX) persons, has been I
erected nearly opposite the finishing line, I
and in front of the grand stand, where
the lake is widest, the water polo and
other aquatic contests will take place.
The railroad track is about 100 yards in
the rear of the course. Shady spots to
the south of the grand stand have been
selected for the refreshment booths, at
which Sonoma County Hour, fruit, wine,
meat, vegetables and tobacco will be
served. To-day is Sonoma County day,
and many visitors are expected from
Santa Rosa, Petaluma. Healdsburg, Clo
verdale and other towns. The proceedings
will be enlivened by a brass band, and
to-night a grand ball will be given, to
which all the visitors from the city will
be welcomed.
The barges, skiffs and canoes to be used I
at the regatta left the city on Thursday
morning m charge of K. Shea of the Pio
neers and At well Webb of the Alameda
senior barge crew. Some of the officials
and contestants went to Guerneville by

AMERICAN KENNEL CLUB
AFTER THE LOCAL FANCY.
It is already quite evident that the
American Ker.noi Club intends to deal
drastically with the secoding clubs of the
coast. The secretaiy of the late con
vention, at which the Pacific Kennel
League was organized, has received from
Mr. Vredenburgh. the American Kennel
Club secretary, a telegram requesting a
list of the clubs voting for and against
secession. This information was promptly
wired by Mr. Norman, and further de
velopments are expected.
C. R. Harker, the secretary-treasurer
of the new league, will shortly issue the
printed constitution and rules. The Facl
iic Kennel League intends to notify all
dog owners and exhibitors on the coast
that they and their dogs will be disquali
fied if they show the latter at any shows
held under American Kennel Club rules
west of 110 degrees longitude west. This
will sharply define the situation, and will
probably result in the ultimate disrup
tion of the league, as dog fanciers will
undoubtedly give the preference to such
shows as offer money prizes and gen
eral recognition of wins over the entire
county. This desideratum is to be at
tained only at the San Francisco, and,
in a lesser degree, at the Oakland shows.
The Ps'cifk Mastiff Club holds n.s

FINE GAME BIRDS
UNFIT
FOR TABLE USE
The warm weather of the past week
has prevent ed many sportsmen from en
joying the pleasures of the chase.
According to the local game-dealers
large quantities of wild duck and quail
which were shipped to the markets since
the commencement of the warm snap had
to be cast aside as untit for table use.
Quail are very scarce this year, and
command the high price of $3 per dozen
in the markets. Canvasback duck are $9
per dozen, and the little English snipa
command $3 50 per dozen.
Market hunters report that the north
ern birds are arriving in goodly num
bers, and. with the adv< nt of the next
storm, duck-shooting should be at its
best.
Among several letters which have been
received during the week from local
hunters, one communication says that
during the opening days of the shooting
season birds were verj scarce on the So
noma marshes, and particularly in the
vicinity of Tubbs Island, which is a
favorite feeding ground of canvasbacK.
The writer terminates his letter by stat
ing that owing to the continuous report
of shotguns In the vicinity of the Ala
meda Club preserve during the light of
the moon on the night prior to the open
ing day the ducks received such a scare
that they gave the marshes a wide berth
on Saturday and Sir.' tober 1 and L.
.Members of the Black Jack <lun Club
who shot on Sherman Island last Sunday
returned with forty-five birds, which in
cluded black jacks, canvasbacks, sprig,
widgeon and teal.
A few good bags of birds were made by
the sportsmen of the Ibis Gun Club last
Sunday, but as a rule the sport was fur
below the average. Shooting on the Sui
sun preserves should be very good from
now until the heavy rains will water the
dry and panned ponds south of Merced.
The attention of the Supervisors of
Alarm da County will be called to the fact
that the rail, once so plentiful in the
marshes on the east side of the bay, are
fast becoming extinct, and unless an or
dinance preventing their slaughter is
passed in the near future the rail will, be
a bird of the past, to be remembered
only by those who assisted in their ex
tinction. The following loiter on the sub
ject from a local sportsman is self-ex
planatory:
SAX FRANCISCO, October 12. ISPB.
Editor erf The Callâ Dear Sir: I desire to
brlriK before the sportsmen who frequent tha
marsh as well as the tieM the fact that rail,
â wiu.-h were once found In abundance on tne
Alameila and Marin County marshes*, are now
fast )â¢â  I would suggest that
in the near future a law should be made pro
â¢ . â  years, anti
also that during the shooting season no blrda
phall be kill."! when a hieh tide prevails.
Such a law every true sportsman should stand
by. W. S. T.
The division superintendent of the nar
row gauge railroad running to San Jose
stated !ast Friday to a Call representa
tive that the lirst hunters' train of the
season would positively leave the pier on
the east side of the bay on last Saturday
night at the usual hour To connect with
the 11:45 p. m. boat from Tin- Market
streel Cerry. It appears, however, that
the new schedule did not go into effect
until sixteen minutes subsequent to the
time mentioned for the departure of the
â s" train, ;;nd as a result many
sportsmen on finding that a train convey
ing sportsmen to the Alviso and Alva
rado marshes would not leave, owing to a
delay in the making up of the schedule,
until this evening. The bo.it connecting
with the hunters' train will therefore
leave foot of Market street to-night at
11:45 o'clock. The railroad managers did
not intend to put on a hunters' train un
til next month, but at the suggestion of
The Call they decided to pive th- ?orÂ»rts
men who are compelled to work late %
chance to enjoy an early morning snoot
from favorite sloughs and blinds.
A Monterey sportsman writes the sport
ing editor that the Supervisors or his
county, some of whom are devotees of
quail shooting, did not hesitate to use
their best efforts for the protection of
the quail, and as a result only four days
of an open season, which commenced on
October 1 and endpd on October .". were
allowed for hunters to enjoy a favorite
pastime.
Unless the Supervisors of Marin Coun
ty ordain that the quail shootiner si
will end this year after the sportsmen
Will have a few months of shooting tho
prospects for future sport will certainly
be very slim, as the birds did not pair
this spring, owing to tho extremely dry
summer, and as a consequence very few
young- birds are now found among the
flocks. It would be to the interest of the
sportsman that the season for shooting
would be limited to a few months.

ENLIGHTENING CANDIDATES.
Information Given on Serious Mat
ters Coming Before the Leg
islature.
From now until after the election the
: Industries has a big
task upon its hands, thai of enlightening
the Assembly and Senatorial candidates
of all parties on a number of the most
important budj< cts which the council is
interested in. One is the pure foods ques
tion. Much valuable data hap been gath
ered, and the matter will be presented
to the next Legislature, with the view of
having thi- laws mail<- rnon- stringent
against the making or selling of impure
ttr,'] adulterated foods.
Another matter will be the considera
tion of appropriating money for sending
an exhibit of California products to the
world's exposition to be held In Paris.
The exhibits of Western products at Chi-
I eago, Atlanta and Hamburg. Germany, |
have brought more trade to the State i
| than the general public appreciate. It is j
believed that a fine display at Paris will j
be the means of turning thousands of
! dollars to the producers of this State.
Special laws against forest arson and
for the protection of the timber lands of
the State will also be seriously consid
ered with a view of preventing the re
currence of the disastrous fires of the
past summer and fall. Another subject
will be the protection of home Industries
and a consideration of the convict labor
question and the protection of free white
labor from competition with felons. Still
another move is the establishment of a
State quarantine against diseased cattle.
Within the lust few days Secretary Lewis
of the association has sent to the County
Clerks of every county in the State let
ters requesting him to send the name of
all of the legislative candidates to the
president, J. A. Filehcr. So far the de- |

THE SA& FRANCISCO CALL, SATUKDAT, OCTOBER 15, 1898.
A WILLING
PARTNER TO
HIS SHAME
Trend of the Evidence
in the Nead Case.
RETRIAL OF NETTIE NEAD
THE WIFE A FEATURE OF THE
HUSBAND'S CASE.
Testimony Going to Show How He
Was Cognizant of the Life
That She Wai
Leading.
The salacious details of the trial for
vaprancy of John M. Nead before Jurtpe
Conlan yesterday were sufficient to draw
a courtroom full of people to stand and
gape and laugh whenever the testimony
gave the slightest reason for it. They
filled all the aisle-? and sat two deop In
the seats, and not one had business
enough to attend to to call him away be
fore court adjourned at 5 o'clock,
The defendant was the object of most
sustained Interest. How a man, once a
minister, can sit quietly and hear the name
of the woman he calls his wife so "be
fouled and made a laughing stock and a
ifome of the Prominent Figures in the Nead Case.
Jest of such a crowd as haunts the police
courts is a mystery even to the crowd
that stands and listens. Tf he be inno
cent Nead is surely finding all his pun
ishment In this world; if he be guilty ho
probably does not care.
The filling: of the jury box took but a
few minutes, and then Policeman Joy, the
complaining witness, was called to the
stand. The first question brought out
objections, and these served to show
' which way the trial was to be directed.
Nead, charged with vagrancy, must be
shown to be a disreputable character
himself and to have been habitually con
sorting with disreputable charactersâ and
the prosecution proceeded to demon
| strate that the first and worst of tftese
I was Nettie Nead, his wife. It was prac
tically a retrial of the woman.
The court ruled that the prosecution
could show the character of the asso
ciates of the defendant regardless of who
they were, and the witness was allowed
to proceed. The woman herself was not
in court. Mr. Gallagher, counsel for the
j defense, by objecting to officers saying
she was the one they saw walking the
streets, nearly had her ordered to ap
pear and be identified, but the court did
not want to subject her to the gaze of
the courtroom crowd, and said so, and
Mr. Gallagher ceased his objections.
Joy's testimony was the same as given
; in the trial of the woman â how she spoke
; to him on the street and invited him
home; how he knew her because he had
; seen her a few nights before in the
Thalia, an underground resort on Turk
i street, where she was seated at a table
talking to her husband and two other
I wonr-n. in whose footsteps she was fast
following. He said Need stood on the
corner and watched while the woman
plied her trade.
Policeman Sylvester, whose beat Is on
: O'Farrell street, told how he had watched
: the woman and had seen her speaking to
men on the street while the defendant
hovered near, but on the other sidewalk,
and whistled whenever he saw the officer
approaching. To him she was "the woman
In black." He had had his attention
called to her by a business man, and his
idea was to watch her until ..e could es
tablish a case of vagrancy against her.
For five nights he saw the woman and
! the man and then she disappeared from
his beat. He had kept a record of her
comings and goings on a little card, but
when she ceased to roam the streets of
his beat he tore the record to pieces and
thought tin more of her until he saw her
under arrest. Policeman uillen testified
to seeing her aimlessly wandering around
McAllister. Jones and Leavenworth
streets and Golden Gate avenue, the de
fendant still keeping his distance on the
other side of the street, but never far
away.
Phillip J. ITaskins then came to tell
how in Police Court 4. of Wiileh he Is the
clerk. Mrs. Nettle Neau had been con
victed of vagrancy, and also of plying the
trade Of a fallen woman.
After him came Mrs. Augusta Frost,
who keeps a lodging house on O'Farrell
street. It was to her that Mrs. Nead had
come to rent a room, saying it was for
herself and her husband, but It was not
the husband, she said, who was the most
frequent visitor there. She spoke to the
woman and asked if her husband knew
what she was doing, and in spite of Gal
lagher's objections the witness told how
Mrs. Nead had declared that her husband
knew the whole truth. From Mrs. Frost's
house Mrs. Nead went to a house kept
by a Mrs. Etta Ralph, and there she met
Tessie Smith and Hattle Roberts, with
whom she and her husband were talking
when first they were seen by Policeman
Joy in the Thalia. Mrs. Ralph was called
to tell how she introduced Mrs. Nead to
Tessie Smith and of the manner of life
led by the two women while they lived
under her roof.
A. Davis, a Jeweler, then took the stand
to tell of an encounter he had had with :
Mrs. Nead on Market street. He said she '
asked him to go home with her, and when
he asked her where she lived she pointed
out a Hgar-store across the street where
the der<T.<lant used to do business. He
nsked who was the man who stayed in the
cigar-store, and she told him It was her
husband; but he need not mind, her hus
band would not interfere with them.
Davis said, too, that one evening sue |
came into his store to buy a locket and
chain, and that when It came to the pa"
me-nt for the Jewelry she showed herself
to be a woman without shame or virtue.
And then the crowd in the courtroom guf
fawed and the loungers nudged each other
and winked at the defendant, who sat In '
his chair and said nothing, while the bail
iff had to hammer on the desk before the '
case could proceed again.
The story was too good to keep, Davis
paid, and ho had told it to a few friends,
and again the bailiff had to hammer on |
the dt sk to keep in check the humorous .
disposition of the crowd.
Tessle Smith was the last witness of the
afternoon. She had an interesting story
to tell of how Nead had come to her in
the Thalia and had be^n introduced to her i
by his wife. She said he wanted her to
tell him how his wife could escape the
vigilance of the police and what was the
best way In which she could make money
at the Thalia. She gave what advice her
. \; . rience had shown her was good. And
then she was turned over to Mr. Gal
lagher for cross-examination. She had to
tell of the life she was leading, and her
efforts to shield herself brougot new
amusement for the loungers, who laughed
and joked even after the adjournment and
while they trooped out of the courtroom
and out Into the corridor.
The case will go on again Monday.

MISS MAY HOFFMAN
AS A TRAINED NURSE
THE YOUNG SOCIETY LADY SUR
PRISES HER FRIENDS.
Left Wednesday Evening to Take a
Three Years' Course in Bellevue
Hospital, New York.
To many of Miss May Hoffman's
friends it will be a surprise to learn that
she has gone to New York to enter the
Bellevue Hospital, where she will take a
u.ree years' course with a view of be
coming a trained nurse. This young lady
Is the talented daughter of Southard
Hoffman, the clerk of the United States
Circuit Court. She started alone last
Wednesday evening for the East. Miss
Hoffman's decision was not according
to the wishes of her family, as she had a
brilliant future before her in other walks
of life. For siÂ»me time past she has been
one of the leading lights in San Fran
cisco's social circles, in which sphere she
filled a very important place, as have all
of her relatives, who have and do now oc
cupy prominent positions in Federal
offices.
In her social position Miss Hoffman
became interested In works of charity,
and this led her to become interested in
the management of the Children's Home.
With the greatest of interest she watched
the nurses who cared for the little ones,
and she often expressed the desire to take
upon herself a life of charitable useful
ness. Society's calls did not appeal to
her so loudly as the cries of the little
suuerers, and her relatives believed that
if she ever broke from the former and
applied herself to caring for the latter It
would be in the Children's Hospital, in
which she had taken so great an interest.
However, recently the young lady decid
ed that the field here was not large
enough, and she announced her Intention
of going to the New York institution and
there pass through the entire course
necessary In order to become a trained
nurse.
To the protests of her family she
turned a deaf ear, and so earnest was
she that at last all objections were with
drawn, and she departed with the best
wishes of all who had been Informed.
Miss Hoffman's intimate friends con
sider it strange that one reared as she
has been should give up a life of luxury
to minister to the sufferings of humanity.

To take their linen to any other laun-
dry in San Francisco would not be tol-
erated for a moment by our patrons,
who have been taught to know fine
laundry work when they see it, by the i
exquisite work that we execute every
week on their shirts, collars or cuffs.
Our laundry work is above competition.
One trial will convince you.

FASTERN MARKETS.
" NEW Y^RK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â The local stock mar
ket overcame successively the opening depres
sion reflected from the earlier transactions on
foreign exchanges and the unsettling effect of
early weakness !n seme of the industrials. A
relapse later in the day in a rather extended
list of specialties put a stop to the upward
movement of the market and brought trading
In the general i:st almost to a standstill. The
list of smoks traded In was largely curtailed
and activity much diminished even in the
stocks which led the. decline. The relapse car
ried prices for the most part a fraction below
last nights close and the reaction from the
hijhe^t reached a point in some railroad
Pucar, Tobacco, Manhattan, Brooklyn
Transit. Metronolltan and Northern Pacific,
the latter the only active railroad stock, were
all active centers of weakness. Some of the
m and Southwestern railways were con
isly firm, the belatlng movement of cot
ton serving to imrrove their earnings. None
cf the large speculative interests which took
the lead in yesterday's market were at all
prominent to-day. There was a disposition to
take rather m r >re account of the depressed con
dition of foreign markets, with a growth of a
conviction that the money situation in Berlin
and the resultant effect on other financial cen
ters is more responsible for the depression than
political questions. The prob'sm of the inter
national exchanges seems to nave devolved It
self into a question of how to shift the" pres
sure of credit balances In favor of the United
Â£;;it. s. To-day's additional small engagement
of sold for Import is significant, in view of the
high money rates prevailing in Europe. It is
a fact that money is cheaper in New York than
In any other great financial center, excepting
possibly Paris. Yet the heavy demand for ex
port of our wheat and coarse grains continued
to-day. Rates for ocean freights are strong,
not only for present but for future shipments,
and the large offerings of exchange in the mar
kets for future delivery are said to be against
grain engagements for November and December
and even into January. There is no room for
surprise in view of the preliminary statement
of the foreign trade for September given out
to-day at Washington, showing an excess of
merchandise exports over imports of over $42,
account of the Hank of Eng
land In advancing the minimum discount rate
to 4 per cent and in borrowing from the market
in onier to make that rate effective and in so
doing secure control of international exchange
with a view of protecting specie reserve. It Is
evident that the pressure of this country's
credit upon the old world's money markets is
destined tr> increase in the near future.
There were continued evidence of investment
demand for high grade bonds as well as stocks.
Total sales. $2,200,000.
United States old fours registered, the new
fours and the fives were N higher and the old
four coupon higher In the bid price.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 14.â Evening Poste
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here opened steady , to-day,, but gave
way later on the reported military conspiracy
In France. They rallied on reassuring tele
grams from Paris, but finally closed flat on
pessimistic telephone messages from the French
capital, which were of a character to confirm
the earlier reports. Americans shaped their
own course consistently. They were good all
day, although the support was almost entirely
from New York. Norfolk and Western pre
ferred was especially good. Prices closed at
about the best.
Spanish 4's and all the French specialties
were fiat. '
A feature to-day was the sharp drop In bar
gold to 77b lOd. The buying for New York has |
ceased but Berlin has commenced purchasing j
and the price closed at about 77a 10% d. -
The London discount market is still unsettled,
but with a firm tendency, the Bank of Eng
land making further efforts to control the mar
ket at 3'i per cent.
The Germans are liquidating investment
stocks and mines, but are retaining Americans
fairly well.
Lazard Freres announce that they will import

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Oct. 14.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Speculation
in the early part of the week was dull and the
market heavy. Later it assumed more activity,
displaying a tendency to rally from the recent
depression. Professional trading and manipu
lation supplied, however, the bulk of the
transactions throughout, and the public has
been conspicuously Indifferent. It would seem
that the decline in the Industrials, the alleged
unfavorable Influence of election uncertainties
and the unsettled political outlook in Europe
have combined to reduce the outside Interest
to very small dimensions. Bearlshness on the
part of traders, resulted, however, in the
creation of a fair short interest, and while the
large financial interests show very evident
signs of disposition to wait until after the
election, certain powerful interests in the street
seem to have taken advantage of the situation
to create a rally in shorts. This was facilitated
by a change of sentiment due to the rise in
grain prices and the heavy foreign purchases
of American breadstuffs. Railroad earning
also continue to make remarkably favorable
exhibitions, even in comparison with the large
revenues of a war ago. The continued and
apparently increasing ease of money is another
sustaining factor, and is partly responsible
for the absence of any decided liquidation of
speculative holdings in the stock market. No
effect was produced by the advance of the Bank
of England rate and the rise of discount rates
in London to 3% per cent, and It is noted that
the large supplies of money and easy, rates here
encourage investments In foreign exchange, a
class of transactions which was sufficiently
familiar a year ago. The bond market Is dull,
with prices well sustained in the railroad de
partment. Government* are strong and the
demand for the new 3 per cents from banks
has this week carried their price up to 105%.
Industrial stocks have again been the prin
cipal objects of attention.
Sugar continued its irregular decline, falling
to 105%, but has had frequent rallies on the
short interest. On Friday, however, it broke
on alleged new cuts. Tobacco, though lesÃ ac
tive, has been Irregular. The announcement
that the control of the Drummons factors at
St Louis has been secured was accompanied by
reports of the Issue of considerable stock to
pay for it and of a renewal of the plug to
bacco war. Of this the price of the stock sold
down from 127% to 116, but support was ex
tended to it and the *tock Issue denied, where
upon it rallied to 120%.
People's Gas and Brooklyn Rapid Transit
were leaders In the recovery of the general
market and some attention is given to the new
Federal Steel stocks which are dealt in in the
outside market, a brilliant future being pre
dicted for the securities.
While a better fueling has been apparent
about railroad stocks, that part of the list has
been as a whole dull and neglected. Prices i
sagged wearily until Wednesday, and then re- j
covered early. An Incident was the advance
of Great Northern to 140%. the highest price
ever recorded for it. The very favorable week
ly earnings of the St. Paul road make a good
Impression, but fall to create any decided
movement in the stock. Nor have the yellow
fever reports from the South encouraged the
bears to attack the securities of railroads in
that section. The principal feature of the
railroad list was the movement of Northern
Pacific. Under selling induced by stories of an
Internal disagreement in the management the
price of the preferred was put down from 75%
to 74% and that of the common from 42% to
38%. Later they were rallied to 76 and 41% re
spectively on short coverings and fresh buying,
due to reports that the dissensions had been
settled and that a dividend on the 'common
was in prospect.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Oct. 14.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
With actual payments through clearing-houses
Vt per cent larger than in the same week of
1592 It cannot be said that business is in any
sense falling off, and yet many are complain
ing because the amount realized as profit Is
smaller than was formerly realized in good
times. In almost every branch of business
trade Is now transacted on a narrower margin
of profit than In any other time of fair pros
perity. There is a great change, and perhaps
a permanent one. in the percentage of profit*
derivable from the trade and manufacture as
well as in the profits obtainable by transport
ers. Progressive civilization calls for a lower
range of profits and of prices as the volume
of business transacted increases In order to
make possible improvement In the condition of
the working millions.
Wheat business is more active, with prices
about 2c higher for spot and nearly 3c for De
cember options. Very heavy purchases have
been- made within the past few days, not as
yet reflected In the official record of shipments,
but the exports from both coasts, flour in
cluded, have been 4,101.770 bushels, against
4.556.015 for the same week last year. It Is es
pecially Interesting that in spite of the general
disposition of farmers to hold back their wheat
the Western receipts have been for the weefc
much larger than last year and for two weeks
20.790.455 bushels, against 16,685.554 last year.
While attention is now paid to the official re
ports they seem to foreshadow a larger return
for the crop than has been made in any pre
vious year. The price of corn has advanced
about 2c, though the receipts are just now
larger than a year ago. The. price of spot
cotton 1b a sixteenth luwer than a week ago
and the\January option has also lost a rew

goods. This is partly due to the official ad
mission that the prices of print cloths, now a
sixteenth below 2c, cannot be sustained wltn "
out a selling agency, which Is now proposed
Although the production at Fall Klver is in
excess of demand the difficulty in prices is
probably largely due to the belief that a oig
yield of cotton must reduce the price or tne
material. While come woolen mills nave
started operations during the week quite aa
many have stopped. Although wool is about
10 per cent lower than it was February l tne
manufacturers are not buying and the marKet
Is remarkably dull, with sales during the past
two weeks of only S, 178,700 pounds at the tniee
chief markets, against 24,331,600 last year and
14.53G.3U0 in 1596 and 13.703.500 in 18*2. The gen
eral feeling is that the price of the material
must decline before the manufacture can much
increase its sales. Orders for^goods have been
a little better and a few mills have resumed
operations, but there Is as yet no such demand
as is necessary to sustain current prices or
The Iron manufacture again reports a small
increase in the weekly output, 21u,630 tons,
against 213.043 a month ago. and with the de

BRADSTREET' R REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: While the advent of cooler
weather in most sections of the country has
undoubtedly been Instrumental In causing
Improvement In the tone of the distributive
trade, perceptible at most markets this week,
beneficial effect upon general business and par
ticularly upon agricultural products, the report
of improved demand abroad for our staple
.ereals should not be lost sight of. At most
Western centers an improvement In the re
tail and jobbing trade in seasonable dry good*,
clothlnr and shoes is reported, and more
seasonable weather at the South is responsible
for some relaxation of the absurd quarantines
which have done so much to cripple trade in
that section. Particularly prominent in this
connection Is the loosening of the quarantines
in the lower Mississippi Valley, where it be
gins at last apparently to be appreciated that
the quarantines are worse than the disease they
aim to fight. Good export demand in general
European account, smaller shipments from
Russian nnd Danublan ports, less favorable
reports regarding Russian and Australian crops
and an undoubtedly active home demand for
wheat for milling, superinduced by the active
foreign call for flour,' have all worked to
strengthen the price of wheat this week, and
sympathetic reflection is found in the Improved
call for other cereals at slightly better prices.
Another favorable feature In the foreign trade
situation, too. has been the apparently satis
factory progress makine in developing the
trade with our new possessions in the Atlantic
and Pacific. Large orders on Cuban account
are said to have been placed recently in New-
York, and heavy phipments to Manila and
other' Pacific Ocean points, with the reported
starting of new lines of steamships to Hono
lulu and Australia, all bear testimony to the
energetic efforts of American business men to
build up our trade abroad. Railroad earnings
and bank clearings continue to furnish favor
able measures of current business. The leather
situation has attracted more attention this
week because of the reported intention to shut
down a large number of tanneries In an effort
to affect the prices which are now said to be
relatively higher than the finished production.
Iron trade reports are a repetition of recent
weeks, new business being of moderate pro
portions, but mills and foundries are kept
busily employed on early orders.
Wheat. Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4.729,935 bushels, against 5,397,
224 bushels last week. 5.939.720 bushels In this
week a year ago, 4,516,817 bushels In 1536. 2,409,
446 bushelÃ in 1895 and 3.192.09S bushels In 1894.
Since July 1 this year the exports of wheat
aggregate 56.625.116 bushels, against 66,920,132
bushels during the same period a year ago.
Business failures for the week number 233,
against 163 last week, 196 in this week a year
ago, 279 in 1596. 2R9 in 1595 and 253 in 1894.
Business failures In the Dominion of Canada
number this week 22, against 23 last week,
which are only half of what they were one
year ago, and compare with 30 in 1896, 37 In
1895 and 39 in 1894.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. Much to the surprise of
the leading portion 'of the grain trade, the
Liverpool market opened at a decline over
night of %d and closed at a loss of 1%@1%d.
The result was a decidedly weak opening here.
December started with plenty of sellers at 64%
@64% c, compared . with yesterday's closing
price of 64% c. This was practically a "put"
price, and a good deal of buying was done by
holders of these privileges.
Outside of the demand from this source, how
ever, there was little support given the market
and a still further decline occurred. December
finally getting down. to 64c. In the afternoon
the market became quite active and strong.
Reports from the seaboard showed very heavy
export engagements, the figures' ranging all
the way from 70 to 150 boatloads. This indica
tion that the foreigners were taking advantage
of the decline to satisfy their wants started
shorts on the run, December going up to 65Â®
65fte at the close, a gain of %c for the day.
There was a fairly active trade in corn. The
market was weak in sympathy with wheat, and
a decline in cables. When wheat turned strong
corn responded. The close is â¢ / -@ 3 / s c higher for,
December. , . >
Oats were quiet all day. The opening was
weak and prices- ruled lower until late in the
day, when they rallied with wheat and corn,
closing unchanged from yesterday.
A good business was done In provisions. The
market started easy with grain. ; There was a
little too : free selling > during the - early weak

demand from shorts was so heavy that prices
advanced very rapidly. The close Is 7%@12%c

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New Yoik Commercial under date of
October 8 says:
"Cooler and more seasonable weather Is
having its effect and there is more demand
for dried fruits. Inquiry Is also Increasing
somewhat showing that the distributing trade
is thinking about the winter supplies.
"There is little change noticeable In prunes.
Trade Is slack because of small offerings.
Holders of large sizes on the coast are keep
them tc work out their less desirable fruit.
Small sizes are muc â¢ in evidence in offerings,
and there isn't much question that small sizes
will be accepted eventually. The suggested
possibility of a French combination to cap
ture the prune market o f the Eas* hasn't ma
terialized yet. and the efforts will hardly bf;
made this year. The French crop lacks large
sizes and that Is what the Eastern trade wants
this year. , _
"The raisin situation is unchanged. First
arrivals of the new crop are reported satlsfac
"Prices are held firm, pending the probable
change October 15. Until then there will be
little business done, though inquiry is brisk
and demand will be likely to Increase.
"Figa are firm under reports of short crops.
I,ater reports cut the yield down to perhaps
11 f'oo camel loads. Fane- ->re selling at lVn^r
arid pulled at 16'ft24c. California fancy layers
sell at lO'-'&^c, and bags 5%@6c. Pome effort
Is being made to force the sale of California
fruit and if the keeping quality was as fav
orable as the packing there would be no diffi
culty In disposing of any quantity in this mar
ket
"Dates are held steady, but spot prices an;
email and trade restricted in consequence.
"Apricots are firm, with export demand in
creasing. Local trade Is somewhat restricted,
but prospects of higher prices are encouraging
to holders.
"Peaches show no change from last reports.
There are no stocks in first hands, and all in
second and third hands are held stiff, with
upward tendency.*'

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â The Journal of Com
merce says: As an advance In the price of
California raisins, to take effect at midnight
of the lGth lnst., has been expected. It has
been without material effect upon the Eastern
trade. The demand has not been stimulated to
any extent of late by the prospect of higher
prices and there has been no great effort to
sell goods. In fact Eastern commission mer
chants as a rule do not seem to like the meth
ods followed by the association, claiming that
they restrict business by causing an uncertain
feeling. They will sell goods under associa
tion terms because they cannot do otherwise.
they say, but they are not In sympathy with
the plans of those who regulate the associa
tion's operations. An evidence of this Is found
In flagrant violations of the association's rules
by some or the large handlers of raisins in
Eastern consuming markets. There is a good |
deal of dissatisfaction expressed .by Eastern
sellers in regard to the methods followed by
the syndicate and some of the handlers of Cali
fornia raisins here do not hesitate to express
the opinion that the organization has made it- i
self so unpopular that next season It will cease .
to control the market, while some assert that ;
It will be only a matter of a few weeks when ,
its authority will end. On the other nana
there are a number of people who contend that
the association by Its action in securing con
trol of the crop and regulating prices has been
a benefactor not only to growers and packers,
but to distributors, by putting an end to in
discriminate consignments which in past years
have kept the market in a demoralized con
dition.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week j
there have been three arrivals of coal from
Washington with 10,300 tons, two from Austra
lia, 4054 tons: one from British Columbia, 4218
tons; one from Oregon. 400 tons: total. lv-'T- j
tons. Everything in the fuel line is moving I
along smoothly; no changes to note of any mo
ment; stocks on hand are ample to fill all re
quirements, and prices remain the same. The
outgoing transports take barely sufficient fuel
to reach Honolulu, where they coal up for the
remainder of the voyage to Manila: the Gov
ernment supply is very large at Honolulu, as
the purchases made by the Navy Department
for that section were on the basis of a possi
ble continuation of the war for fully twelve
months, hence they are overstocked there. The
Australian list is gradually diminishing, which
Is evidence of a scarcity of coal carriers in
colonial waters, in fact, all the transporta
tion from that section is being done by our
coast owned vessels seeking to come home. All
the foreign vessels there have been diverted to
the grain carrying trade to Europe, as the com
incr harvest there indicates a surplus for ship
ment of over lOO.f'OO tons. It is early to predict
what our rainfall may prove to be this coming
season; the showers we have had to date have j
fallen most propitiously. Retailers have been
already benefited by the late storms, as their
sales have been materially increased."
RlCEâ Storms in the South and the yellow
fever quarantine render the market very firm.

AN UNKNOWN
WHO IS LIKE
MANY MEN
Several Pec p a Sure
of His Identity.
HE WILL NOT STAY DEAD
THREE TIMES RECOGNIZED, EUT
STILL A MYSTERY.
The Heavily Built Man Found in the
Bay Was Killed by Shoot
ing and Not by
Drowning.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
id way, Oct. 14.
The unknown man at the morgue must
be a very ordinary individual. He has
been "positively identified" three time.-,
and In each instance the man whom he
is not has appeared and denied very posi
tivelj ad. The first person to
identify him was a woman, who informed
the Dei roner that she knew the
corpse weli. She was an elderly lady and
when asked by what means she identified
him, she replied: "Oh, I know him well.
lie is a little heavier, but that was done
by the water." On being; asked for a
graph she produced one and an hour
later it was discovered that the photo
graph was that of a proprietor of a big
store on Washington street, who Is very
much alive.
The next identification was when the j
dead man was declared to be Oscar P. j
g, who worked for N. P. Reuss a I
igo. After "identifying" the man
Keuss went to Krieg's house and found j
him enjoying life with his family.
Jake feperb called at the morg-ue yes- j
terday and "identified" the man positive- j
ly as a drummer for the coffee flrm of |
Hills Bros, of San Francisco. Tins drum
mer denies being dead and is now attend
ing to business.
Two ladies called at the morgue, one of ,
whom was positive she knew the man as !
a friend of the other lady, but when the
other lady saw the heavy corpse with a I
bullet wound through its head she indig
nantly declared that the dead man was
never her friend. Then came Louis
Mauter, who was positive that the re
mains are those of his son-in-law Phillip ;
Deller. This "identification" held good
till this afternoon, when Deller sent a
dispatch from Bakersneld that he is alive '
and well.
The Coroner is satisfied that the deceas
ed did not die from drowning, aa there
18 no water in the lungs. The shot in
the head must have produced death in
stantly or when the body fell into the '
water the lungs would have absorbed the ;
fluid. The remains have been photo
graphed and all other identification must
be made from the deceased's picture.
Ask for Marsh's Pardon.
OAKLAND, Oct. 14.â A petition is be
ing circulated to secure the pardon of
William Marsh, who over a year ago, in
i company with three members of the
1 Sporting Life gang, broke in a house and
j assaulted Mrs. Lizzie James. Marsh was
merely an accomplice in the deed, but
his trial coming tirst he was convicted,
I the others escaping. He was sentenced
i to one year imprisonment, and his time
â  will expire In February. The petition has
\ been signed by Mayor Thomas, Chief of
Police Fletcher, the twelve jurors who
convicted him and the complaining wit
i ness.
She Waited Patiently.
â¢OAKLAND. Oct. 14.â Just one year to
ri;* v Mrs. Emma L. Harris was granted a
decree of divorce from Sampson Harris

SHOULD SEND
THE SWEEPINGS
TO THE PARK
The Board Can Eas
ily Have It Done.
WOULD RECLAIM THE WASTES
A PLAN TO HAVE THE STUFF
CREMATED.
Why the Park Commissioners Have
Not Been Able to Secure the
Refuse From the Streets
in the Past.
Give the street sweepings to Golden Gate
Park! The refuse from the streets that
coots the city $11,500 a month to gather up
and cart away would, If put to proper
use, convert every barren Band waste
within the limits of that magnificent re-
Bort Into a luxuriant grass plat or a beau
tifully wooded knoll In r\n incredibly
short space, for once those sand dunes
are covered with nourishing soil vegeta
tion grows like magic.
The Supervisors two years ago In
serted a clause in the street sweeping con
tract providing that the Sweepings should
be delivered to the park at the request
of the Commissioners, upon their agree
ing to pay the extra cost of transporta
tion. Superintendent McLaren had an
interview with the contractor, who told
him it would cost 50 cents a yard extra
to deliver the sweepings in the park. Of
course the terms were not accepted for
the simple reason that the Commissioners
can buy loam, thoroughly decomposed
and ready for spreading, for 75 cents a
yard. And this loam is nauled a distance
of over five miles. The contractor was
simply looking for a handsome profit for
disposing of the refuse he had already
been well paid by the city to take care
of.
The present contract for sweeping the
streets will expire December 1, and in let
ting the new contract the Supervisors
should give due consideratton to the wel
fare of the park. Moreover, a new feat
ure has arisen which demands attention.
The garbage ordinance which the Super
visors now have under consideration pro
vides that the street sweepings shall be
THE SAN FRANCISCO - CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1898.
MAYOR VETOES
THE TAX LEVY
ORDINANCE
Would CrippletheCity
Government.
LAKE DREDGING DISCUSSED
SCHEME TO LICENSE EVERY
MERCHANT.
Said to Be the Means by Which the
Large Deficit Is Co Be
Raised by the
Council.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 16.
Mayor Thomas has riled his veto of the
tax levy ordinance passed by the Council
a week ago. He shows plainly that there
will be a deficiency of $61,Sjuo, and that thj
most important branches of the city gov
ernment will be stultified and the city a
progress retarded.
After going into detail condemning the
apportionment of the money raised by
the ordinance, the Mayor shows that by
a readjustment a levy of $1 2U can be
made satisfactory. His language in this
connection is as follows:
I feel assured that such a readjustment of the
levy in the several department funds can and
should be maue by your honorable body that
no department in the city government should
suffer, more especially the High School, Free
Library and Street and Fire departments.
he taxpayers in the annexed district are
demanding, and they have a right to demand,
and should have granted to them a reasonable
amount of fire and police protection and such
other betterments as it may be possible lo give
them. ;^
The improvement of Lake Merritt should be
prosecutid as Car us practicable during the
flscal year. The general LmpreMlon la that not
more than one-half of the appropriation made
for that purpose can be earned prior to June
Su, Ib9iÂ», the clo6i: of the fiscal year. Should
that be true it would be unwise to tie up the
other half in the park and boulevard fund, from
which it could not be transferred to aid in pay
ment of any claims against the city accrued
against any other fund.
I firmly believe that the sewer fund can get
along with less than one-half of the amount
appropriated by the ordinance. 1 ditslike very
much to veto an ordinance. This is my ninth
veto out of one hundred and forty-nine ordi
nances paaaed by this Council. My vetoes have
been sustained with one exception.
The tax levy ordinance is perhaps the most
important one upon which we are compelled to
act and it is my belief that with a lf\> f
$1 liv an departments of the city, if economically
conducted, can be carried on without deficit,
and the improvement of Lake Merritt, the city's
water park, cuji be carried on as far as it la
possible to do so this fiscal year.
We must bear in mind that thf fourth month
of our fiscal year 16 now passing, and that all
the shortages mentioned will have to be made
up during the remaining eight month?. For
the reasons above given I feel compelled to
veto this ordinance.
The merchants are somewhat disturbed
by a report that a majority of the City
Council intends to stick to its intention
of building lakeside sewers and dredging
the whole of the lake in one year, ft is
rumored that the same Councilman who
have combined to put through this levy
have also agreed to put through a license
ordinance which will make up the deficit
by requiring every merchant and profes
sional man in this city to take out a li
cense. This ordinance is already before
the Council, and has been brought up on
several occasions. It is somewhat in con
flict with another ordinance which pro
vides for the cutting in halves of the
license fee now required of saloon
keepers.
DBILL FOR A TROPHY.
Boys' Brigade Companies to Compete
for a Cup.
OAKLAND, Oct. 13.â 0n the evening of
October 22, in the First Presbyterian
Church in Alameda, Company A (signal
corps), under command of Captain W. B.
Barber; Company D, under command of
Captain L. N. Cobbledick, and Company
E, under command of Captain Q. Tellar,
all of the boys' brigade, will compete by
companies for a large silver cup. The
company making the highest number of
points will be awarded the cup. Efficiency
Incinerated In the garbage crematory, for
which the city is to be taxed 20 cents a
yard in addition to the regular price for
sweeping the streets. That 20 cents extra
would pay the street sweeping contractor
handsomely for carting the refuse from
even the most remote down-town district
to the park.
The street sweepings that are now going
to waste, and which the Supervisors pro
pose to pay 20 cents a yard to have
cremated, If delivered to the Park Com
missioners would enable them to devote
$25,000 a year on an average, that they
now pay for the purchase of loam, to
other needed improvements. Moreover, It
would enable them to reclaim every por
tion of the park, where at present they
are enabled to use only a email portion
of the loam purchased in extending the
cultivated area.
It may surprise some people to learn
that it requires so much loam to replen
ish that portion of the park already un
der â¢cultivation, but it should not when
It is considered that the soil covering the
original sandhills is on an average not
more than two feet deep. The nourish
ment Is soon exhausted, and It is neces
sary to keep it constantly renewed to
prevent the plants and trees from dying.
How many visitors to the city's famous
resort are aware that in the nursery over
near the water works is one of the finest
and most complete collections of conl
ferae to be seen anywhere In the world?
But such is the case* Members of the
cone-bearing species have been collected
from every corner of the globe, and there
they grow and thrive and are being
transplanted to other sections of the park
as rapidly as they can be cared for.
Handsome specimens of the famed
Italian stone pine flourish alongside our
i own stately redwoods, while among the
, dozens of varieties are firs from the Him
alayas, spruce from the Pyrenees, Aus
trian pine, European silver flr, Eastern
white spruce, Indian cedar, pines from
Chile, Mexican spruces, Japanese red
woods, Alaska cedar. Eastern red flr,
Canadian balsam flr, Norway spruce,
Crimean spruce, Mount Etna cedar,
spruce from the Santa Lucia Mountains
in San Luis ObiÃpo Countyâ a very rare
specimen, there being only one small
cluster of trees of which there is any
knowledge; kauri pine from Australia, an
other very rare species, besides many
other varieties.
Theee trees cannot be set out hap
hazard on the bleak hills. First, there
has to be shelter provided in the shape of
hardier specimens of the family, and be
sides plenty of good rich soil for them to
grow in. It is a singular fact that a ma
jority of the species of coniferae could
not exist if exposed to the full force of
our summer winds; but set in among the
hardier firs and pines they will grow to
stately proportions if properly nurtured.
But it requires large quantities of manure
and loam for this purpose, and that is
one of the many reasons the Park Com
missioners are so anxious to secure the
street sweepings.
Let them have them and improve
every portion of the park.
Infant Illegally Detained.
Mrs. Kate Kelly was granted her appli
cation for a writ of habeas corpus yester
day on behalf of Mary Frances Cleveland
Kelly, an Infant, who, It is alleged, lias
been illegally held in the City and County
Hospital. Nellie T. Kelly,* the mother of
the detained infant, died in the hospital
a short time ago. and Mrs. Kate Kelly,
mother of the deceased, was denied the
custody of the infant. Habeas corpus
proceedings were instituted and the
prayer of the petitioner was granted.
In military tactics and appearance will be
important factors in deciding the drill.
Following this drill, a detail from each
company will drill for the regimental gold
medal which is now held by Sergeant
Stowe of Company D.
The medal wll be drilled for by each
detail falling in as one squad and
'â¢dressed" accordingly; then as an actual
mistake Is made the unfortunate "falls
out," and so o,n until there Is only the
winner left on the floor.
The affair will be free to all, ami a gen
eral invitation is extended to the public.
The board of officers of the Second
California Regiment, U. B. 8.. held a
meeting Saturday evening, October 1, at
the Eighth Avenue M. E. Church, to con
sider and discuss the affairs of the regi
ment. Colonel William M. de Wolf was
in the cflair, and was pleased at the good
reports of the officers and committees.
The regiment is in good condition, and
several new companies are reported to be
forming.
The hospital corps in Christ Church.
Alameda. has taken up the work again
and reports progress. Captain Victors.
a medical student, has consented to in
struct The corps.
Company E in the same fhurch has
about sixty members and they can boast
of much knowledge in military drill.
The Bible classes of the companies are
reported to be doing even better than the
drill. In Company A more men attend the
claps than the rtrill. which is a rare oc
currence in any company.
HE HEARD MEADORS
ADMIT HIS GUILT
CAPTAIN BARNES TESTIFIES AS
TO PRIVATE URYS MURDER.
Attorney Deuprey Expects to Show
the Slain Was Intoxicated at
the Time of the Affray.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 14.
Captain William S. Barnes was called as
a witness In James Meador's murder trial
to-day. He recited the conftsslon and
statement of defendant immediately afxcr
the killing. The defendant had at the
time of stabbing Jonas L'ry declared that
he acted in self-defense. He said Ury
had threatened him with a rifle and he
had cut him with a knife because he
feared fur his life.
Private J. M. Scott, the next witness,
testified that he had seen Ury holding- his
gun with the butt toward Meadprs, as if
to strike him.
Thomas N. Jarvis, another member of
Company C, proved to be the most im
portant "witness of the day. He was an
occupant of tent 13 at Camp Barrett and
witnessed the entire quarrel. He sui<i
that Meadors, on the morning of August
16. came to the tent with his knife un
clasped and that thereupon Ury grabbed
his gun; that when Ury had threatened
to report Meadors the latter followed him
toward headquarters; that when Ury
turned about saying, "Go away, 1 don't
want anything to do with you," he at the
same time made a pass at M^adors, when
the latter plunged the knife into his neck.
On cross-examination Attorney Deuprey
wished to bring out the general reputa
tion of the murdered man, asking as to
his drinking habits and his repute as a
boxer and pugilist. To these questions
Deputy District Melvin objected, but Judge
Ellsworth overruled them for the most
part. Then it developed that witness had
brought a bottle of liquor to the tent on
the night previous to the stabbing and he,
Ury and Barnett had drunk liberally.
Witness also testified that Ury had fought
an eight-round contest at San Leandro
for a purse of $25. Deuprey wished to
prove that Ury was ptill under the in
fluence of liquor on the next morning, but
here court adjourned and the trial will
be resumed next Tuesday morning.
Big Power House to Be Built.
OAKLAND, Oct. 14.â 1t was stated to
day by Superintendent Bishop of the Oak
land Transit Company that one of the
great improvements contemplated by the
company is the erection of an immense
power house for the vast system of street
railways now under its control, to be lo
cated on the water front. He says that
it will be built on a scale never before
attempted by any of the individual local
companies. It will, moreover, be so de
signed as to admit of any subsequent en
largements.
A Mysterious Burglary.
OAKLAND, Oct. 14.â Some time during
last night a thief forced a glass show
case in front of a bazaar on Washington
street, near the City Hall, and secured a
large number of small pieces of jewelry,
valued altogether about $30. The mysteri
ous part of the burglary is that a police
officer passes the point in question every
few minutes, while it must have taken
the thief quite a while to get access to
the case, as the lock sho"ws.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 14.â The Board of
Foremen and Engineers of the Fire De
partment met last evening and elected

SPARKS FLEW
FROM CAPTAIN
DELANY'S EYES
Denounced Rottanzi
in Hot Terms.
THE EFFORT OF HIS LIFE
SPEECH BEFORE COMMITTEE OF
SUPERVISORS.
Now Will Rottanzi Be Good or Will
He Challenge Captain De
lany to Mortal Com
bat P
Supervisor Delany appeared at the city
buildings yesterday morning in an angry
frame of mind. He was apparently even
more disturbed than when Supervisor
Devany and School Director Ragan flim
flammed him with that Stanyan street
lease. His countenance wore a heightened
color like unto that produced by the
bruising together of scarlet geraniums
and the rays of the setting sun. Both
prongs of his large black mustache stood
rigidly erect, and whole showers of don't
touch-me sparks flew from his orbs of ob
servation.
In his right hand the Supervisor flour
ished a large pac.-et of bills as he strode
before his confreres of the Health and
Police Committee in the Supervisors'
committee room.
"I would just like to get my hands on
that chap Rottanzl!" exclaimed Delany.
"What I would do to him would be a
plenty! Just look at these unpaid bills!
The city owes money to its clamoring
creditors, and who is to blame? Rottan
zi! He won't come to a committee meet
ing and sign bills so that they can be
paid. We chase him up and down the
streets of the city and then can't get his
signature. The merchants are disgusted
and threaten to boycott us! They say
that they won't sell goods to a deadbeat
corporation that holds up their claims for
a year! I tell you, gentlemen. I had to
blush for very shame the other day when
one leading merchant of this city said to
me: 'Captain. I don't mind dealing with
Chinese and Filipinos, but I do intend to
draw the line herea.ter on San Francisco
Supervisors. They never pay their hon
est debts when they can help it.'
"I told him it wasn't right to class us
ALL NATIONS
TO HONOR THE
EXPOSITION
"American Day" Said
Ito Be a Mystery.
SPACE REPORTED SHORT
APPLICATIONS TO EXHIBIT ARE
VERY NUMEROUS.
Women, Fraternal Societies and Chil
dren Will Present Special Fea
tures on Their Respec
tive Days.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9-JS Broadway, Oct. 14.
The director? of the Oakland Exposi
tion have undertaken to introduce many
features into the show, which will open
November 12, which arc entirely new, and
which will undoubtedly add to its pop
ularity. There are days set apart for.
nearly all nationalities, and, to the gen
eral surprise of the public, November 1*
has been named "American day." Much
inquiry has been made regarding the
special features of an American day baaed
presumably on the presumption that every
day at an industrial exposition should bo
pre-eminently American and secondarily
anything else.
Director Theo. Gier said this afternoon
that it was a question he could not an
â swer. "1 don't understand it," he said,
"except that it Is possibly the day on
which everybody can celebrate that has
been admitted to American citizenship by
naturalization. They ought ail to be
American days, and our manager can
probably enlighten us as to his idea fur
this distinction."
Secretary Charles Roeth te also amused
at the "American day." The opening day
will be devoted to preliminary exercises.
Woman suffragists are to share a Â«ay
with the French, and California, the pro
ducers and the militia will also celebrate
: the day. Red Cross societies and the
! Scotch will have another day. Hospitals
and the Irish have been accorded Novem
ber 17. Cyclists, flower lovers and Ameri
cans will enjoy November 18, and the fol
lowing day will be given over to children
of the public schools and commercial
travelers. The Germans have the sole
right of way on November 21, but the
following day will be divided between the
Italians, historians, pioneers and women.
Ait and the Grand Army of the Republic
will celebrate together, while a carnival,
nurses and native sons and daughters will
be the guests November 24. England and
the Foresters will share the honors at
night, and on the 2Uth weddings will be
celebrated in connection with private
school children and the Humane Society.
Merchants, suburbanites and firemen will
club together, as will also the manufac
turers, Oakland and the Elks. The Swedes
i and Knights and Ladies of the Maccabees
' will have the last day of November, and
' Labor day in connection with Mexicans,
: Cubans and the police force will own the
1 show December 1. Fraternal societies will
! make a showing the following day, and
j on December 3 there will be a grand fare
: well.
Oakland News Notes.
OAKLAND, Oct. 14.â Judge Hall to-day
granted the trustees of the Methodist Episcopal
Chun-h Extension Society of Oakland permis
sion to borrow $2500 for building purposes.
Herman Schoenl'eklt, arrested a few days ago
for selling liquor without a license, forfeited
his bail of $30 in the Police Court to-day.
A petition has been filed for the distribution
i of the $4007 11 estate of. the late Elizabeth D.
; Waterman.
i The appointment of James E. Clark as a dep
; uty sheriff has bef-n revoked.
Word was received to-day of the death of
I Supervisor D. F. Majors of Contra Costa Coun
! ty, which occurred while he was on a visit to
his old home In the East. Deceased was aged
60 years and leaves a widow and one son at
Martinez.
Little Harry Lynch, a 7-year-old lad, of 1622
j Bay street, Alameda, was treated for an ugly
scalp wound at the Receiving Hospital this
afternoon, the result of a kick from a vicious
I horse. The wound required ten stitches and
the patient showed remarkable nerve.
Jlapgie E. Price to-day applied for an order
compelling her husband to pay her $100 attor
ney fees, $25 costs and $40 monthly alimony,
pending the prosecution of the divorce suit
all as Mongolian flim-flammers, and that
he should talk to Rottanzi. He is the
one who gets us Into trouble with the un
paid bills. You know, I hear he is a re
former? That's a funny thing. Rottanzi
and Hefter Jimmy Phelan ought to go
into partnership. Phelan hefts the city's
gold bags and says they're all right. Rot
tanzi doesn't often take the trouble to
investigate city supply bills. About once
a yoar he hefts 'em and then throws the
bunch under the table, or at the clerk, as
; the humor seizes him."
All of this oration was not lost on the
committee, which proceeded to investi
gate the handful of bills which the cap
tain held and found most of them long
past due. Rottanzi not being present, the
bunch was laid away for future action.
The Merchants' Association was repre
sented by a committee, which petitioned
for a postponement of action on the pro
posed garbage contract for thirty days,
so as to give further time for the collec
tion of data from other cities. Captarn
Delany was opposed to granting the time,
stating that there had been enough de
lays already. Devany and Haskins. who
were the only other members present of
the Committee on Health and Police, sided
against the captain, and it was finally de
cided to let the matter of a garbage* con
tract go over until November 20.
The Bohemian Athletic Club was grant
ed a permit to hold an athletic exhibition
In October, the boxers' to be Charles
Johnson and E. Mulligan, John McMahon
and William Otts.
The Excelsior Club withdrew its peti
tion for a boxing contest on November 4.
It is understood that the club could not
get the boxing talent which it had ex
pected to secure.
HE THREW THE CLUB.
The Preliminary Examination of
Policeman Frank L. Kenville
Commenced.
The preliminary examination of Police
man Frank L. Kenville on the charge of
assault to murder was commenced before
Judge Mogan yesterday. Prosecuting At
torney Spinetti was assisted by ex-Judge
Cooney, and Senator McOowan repre
sented the defendant.
Kenville is accused of throwing his club
at Willie Lynch in front of Woodward's
Pavilion on the night of September 23.
The boy was hit on the back of the head,
and for some time it was feared that he
would die.
After Corporal Russell had exhibited
and explained a diagram of the scene,
made by him, John J. Sparrow testified to
seeing Kenville throw the club which hit
the boy. He saw the boy drop and Ken
ville stoop down and pick up the ciub.
Sparrow's full statement has already
been published. He was corroborated by
John F. Gallagher, stenographer, who
was with him :it the time. D. T. Taylor,
a steamfitter, also testified, but his evi
dence was unimportant.
The further hearing was by consent
continued till Mondnv afternoon.
Were Partial to Gum.
Detectives Ryan and ODea last night

BUNCH IS FINED
BY THE JUDGES
Disgraceful Driving at
Los Angeles.
APPARENT STEAL PREVENTED
FIRST DASH IN THE TROT DE
CLARED NO HEAT.
The Lynch Confederacy Attempts
Another Coup, but Fails Because
the Jockeys Ara
Changed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 14.â The grand
Btand was gayly decorated with the na
tional colors, the red, white and blue was
everywhere conspicuous anu a large crowd
a:-s. mbled at the park to-day to welcome
home the returning- Seventh Regiment,
which wai 1 to march to the
track and perform some military evolu
tions. Hut the gathering wits disappoint
ed. Colonel Berry marched his troops
from the depot to their armory, and there
they broke rai;k.<. Without them, tho
afternoon dragged wearily on, and tho
sport evoked but little enthusiasm.
Thompson captured the special trot and
the black colt Direct Heir enjoyed a walk
over for the Semitropio staJte. In the
running events, Miss Daly and Masoero
were the only winning favorites.
In the opening heat of the trot, Thomp
son looked like a legitimate favorite, and
he opened as such In the ring. The edu
iulml harness-horse set, the rawest set of
mechanics the turf ever saw, Bent their
coin in on Our Jack, cutting his price
fr'Pin 8 to 1 duwn to even money. In a
finish that would cause a blind man to
regain his sight. Bunch, behind Thomp-
Bon, all wed Sullivan, holding the ribbons
over Jack, to beat him a nead. It was a
coarse piece <>: grafting, ana the judges
promptly decided it no neat, and Driver
iJuncn was lined JiliK*. Thompson was then
tent out, ai\d wen in straight heats.
Jockey LtTw might ride a barrel tiown
some hillside, but he should confine his
future operations to the middle-man act
for some undertaker in the betting ring
and keep away from the saddle. He rode
his filly, lnola, a 2 to 5 favorite, in the
llrst running dash, and made a bad botch
vt it. Peter Webber, an 8 to 1 shot, had
him beaten long t-efore the wire was
readied, but swerved the last fifty yards.
Lew worked the old-fashioned i .uu
of pulling up, and in doing so was led out
for th i Ellen Wood. The judges
then disqualified Peter Webber, giving the
Ulen Wood. It was a most un
1-for decision.
One of the worst bunches of crabs ever
gathered together lined up in the live and
a half furlong scramble following. Miss
Daisy, ridden by Mike Hennessy, backed
from 6 to ii to *. to 5, won through superior
riding in a hard drive from Whistle Bird,
the second choice.
The downfall of Rubicon in the five-fur
long spin was the hardest blow of all.
The chestnut horse had a big following
that bucked him at short odds. Caldwell's
work with the gate, which all along has
been ragged, was in this instance bad.
Amasa. a 5 to 1 chance, slid away in tne
lead, and at the wire won almost easily
from the odds-on choice. Morinca, 100
second choice, was almost left standing
Ivy Powell, a young man with a belated
idea slumbering In his brain that he Is a
rider, will find out ere long that he has
been relating strange tales to himself. Ho
had the mount on Masuero in the hnal
run a Fix and a half furlong affair, and
the price against the hurso strolled back
from 3 to o to 2^ to 1. The judges men
replaced Powell with Piggott, and Maso
ero won easily from Pat Murphy. i ; ,e
latter was at one time "dead, but awak
ened when the shift came. Denny Lynch
and the smart set had their checks down
on Kal=or Ludwip. forcing his odds from
2 to 1 down to 7 to 1". but, like many of
the other choice cinches framed up by tnis
clique it fell through. Wh.n Piggott re
placed Powell on the back of Kaiser Lud

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATTHRDAY, OCTOBER 15, 189 S.
TRAVERSER'S LAST
RACE HAS BEEN RUN
The Ten Thousaod Dollar Colt
Breaks a Blood Vessel and
Dies oq the Track.
CHICAGO, Oct. 14.â Traverser, the much-abused son of Rossington-
Betsy Broeck, who won the last California Derby, is dead. He burst
a Blood vessel shortly after the start In the six-furlong race at Haw
thorne to-day, but gamely continued until, choking with his own
blood, he fell to his knees a sixteenth from the wire. Regaining his
feet he reared up, fell on his side and with a convulsive shudder died.
The carcass of this 510,000 colt was a few moments later dragged from
the track with as little ceremony as if he had been one of the lowly ani
mals whose avocation Is to haul th.c harrow over the race course. The
boy who rode him in the race was a colored jockey named Goodwin, who
has seldom been trusted with mounts on the cheapest selling platers in
this vicinity, and in the opinion of- many horsemen he is in a measure
responsible for the colt's death.
The race was fifth on the card, and Traverser was pitted against the
best sprinters of all ages in the West, including Espionage, Frank Bell,
Abuse and Mary Black. After going nearly a quarter well up with the
leaders, Traverser was seen to suddenly drop out of it. It is probable
that he was then bleeding internally, but' the jockey began to spur him
and he gamely did his best. He had been passed by all the horses except
St. Simonlan, ridden by H. Martin, who was off behind and outrun. When
Martin passed Goodwin at the eighth pole he told him that Traverser was
bleeding. The colored boy then began to pull up.
It is claimed that an intelligent rider would have known there was
something serious the matter with the colt when he began to drop out of
the race on the backstretch and would have pulled him up then. Had this
been done Traverser might still be alive.
"Virginia" Bradley was part owner, manager and trainer of Traverser.
Many racing men accustomed to handling horses of high class coveted the
splendid racing machine. Offers of $5000 and $6000 were refused by Bradley.
Two weeks ago W. Duke offered $7000 for him. This, like the previous
offer, was rejected. Xo one believed Traverser was worth any such sum
in the hands of Bradley, but it was the consensus of opinion that in com
petent hands he was easily a $7000 horse.

SLAUGHTER OF QUAIL.
Marin County Sportsmen Are Up in
Arms Against It.
SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 14.â 50 flagrantly
has the law making it a misdemeanor to
kill quail out of season been violated In
Marin County for the last three years,
and especially prior to the open season
this year, the true sportsmen are heard
in protest on every side. Realizing that
nothing can be done toward stopping the
illegal practice without united action, it
is probable that in the near future dele
gates from clubs controlling the vast
shooting preserves of the county win
come together to discuss the method of
procedure.
This indignant outcry over the wanton
slaughter of birds comes not only from
members of such organizations as the
Country Club and the San Rafael and
Tamalpais Gun Clubs, but from sportsmen
of every description who have the best
interest of the county at heart and wish
to see the law enforced. The commonly
expressed opinion is that the evil can be
remedied in only one wayâ by having a
game warden and an efficient corps of
deputies, who will not only be on the
lookoat for violations of the law, but will
punish the malefactors, rich and poor
alike. A suggestion has also been made
that the open season should be reduced
to two months.
"My idea of the matter." asserted Ar
mand de Courtieux Jr. to-day, "is that
above all a game warden should be ap
pointed for the protection oi sportsmen
in and out of Marin County. In common
with nearly everybody else, I know that
quail, as well as other game, are being
shot out of season. For the benefit of
sportsmen the season should also be
shortened in order to give the game more
time to propagate. Ido not care to name
any period for the simple reason that I
do not wish to appear before the public
in a dogmatic light."
D. Halrfleld is. if anything, more em
phatic in his statements than De Cour
tieux. He has personal knowledge of trie
violation of the law.
"To my personal knowledge," he said,
"people have shot quail for three years
past before the season began. I have
seen them go by with bags loaded with
the birds. I spoke to Achille Roos. of
Roos Bros., three years ago about the
matter, and he advised that something
should be done at that time. It is very
wrong that persons should be permitted
thus to violate the law, and a game
warden will furnish the only way of stop
ping- the illegal practice. It would be a
good thing to reduce the open season to
two months. The Board of Supervisors
has the power to help us a good deal
and should take an interest in the mat-
ter."
Ex-Mayor E. "W. McCarthy warmly
favors the appointment of a game war
den, with a suitable corps of assistants.
He believes that the Board of Super
visors of Marln County would gTeatly
popularize its Incumbency, especially with
sporting men, by reducing the open sea
son.
Birds are very scarce this year on ac
count of their wanton destruction out of
season and for other reasons of a local na
ture. Now that the reform movement
has beeun it is believed there will be
no "let up" until present conditions are
chang-ed for the better.

STOCKHOLDERS
INDORSE THE
MANAGEMENT
Valley Road Trustees Pass a Resolution of
Confidence in the Handling of the
Santa Fe Combination.
A Meeting to Consider the Letter of Mr. Doyle, Which
the Bulletin and Mr. Phelan Took as a Charge
of Betrayalâ Phelan's Change of Heart.
That the action of the directors in the matter
under consideration meets the approval of the
trustees, as it is clearly in the interest of the stock
holders of the road and the people of California.
It Is a little over a week since the
Bulletin, with flaring headlines and
display type, printed as a charge of
betrayal a letter sent by John T. Doyle
to the directors of the Valley Road. Mr.
Doyle had been an ardent supporter
and stockholder of the road, and when
the proposition to form a combination
to complete transcontinental connec
tions was broached he embodied his
Ideas of the dangers to be avoided in
such a course In the letter the Bulletin
took such pleasure in distorting.
It was made to appear that Doyle
feared a betrayal of the stockholders.
a charge none hastened to deny more
than he, and that the idea was to turn j
the stock of the Valley Road over to ]
the Santa Fe without any guarantee j
that It would continue to be used in j
the cause which called the road Into ex- j
istence â an eternal war against exces- {
slve rates of transportation.
It was the natural course of the Bul
letin to heap vilification and abuse
upon the road, but it was somewhat |
unexpected when Mayor Phelan took I
up the bludgeon the Bulletin had re- i
gretfully laid down and proceeded to I
apply it to the people's road and its '
managers with all the vigor and much
of the venom of his conscienceless
predecessor.
To argrue with the Bulletin were use
less, and the directors knew It, but j
with Mr. Phelan a plain statement of !
the case might do some good if he could
only be persuaded to heft it, so a meet-
Ing of the trustees of the stockholders
was called yesterday to consider the
matter, and Mr. Phelan was present.
The whole plan was then discussed.
As soon as cars started over J.he Val
ley Road rates began to go down and
CHIEF LEES WAS NOT
M'VEY'S BACKER
HE WILL NOT STAND FOR HOS-
MER'S FAILURE.
The Chief's Advice Was -Against the
Delaware Man's Petition for a
Writ of Habeas Corpus.
Chief of Police Lees denied yesterday
that he was in any wise connected- with
the abortive attempt of Detective Mo-
Vey and Attorney John Hosmer, formerly
of this city, latterly of Delaware, to get
custody of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin through
a writ of habeas corpus from the Su
preme Court. In fact the Chief states
that when Hosmer approached him with
the scheme he advised against it, and
told Hosmer that while the present peti
tion of the defense was pending the Su
preme Court could n-ot legally consider
another.
"I don't know whether McVey got Hos
mer to go down there or not," said the
Chief yesterday, "but it is my Impres
sion that Hosmer made the application
on his own hook. He might have been
following- the suggestion that Governor
Build, made when he granted us that war
rant. Budd said that he would issue his
Warrant, but he wanted the Supreme
Court to pass upon the case before ft was
Used, and we agreed to get the court's
opinion if it could be done. George
Knight, however, did not stick to his
ment and take it to the Supreme
('â¢lurt, because be found out that we
would both have the right of appeal
from that tribunal. He threw it into
the Superior Court instead, and I
Suppose that it was for this reason
th;it Hosmer tried to get It before the
Supreme Court in Los Angeles. But it
didn't go, and I told him it wouldn't."
George Knight of the defense is of the
opinion that the prosecution has made
Its greatest mistake in allowing McVey
to make his application. "They found
put that the Supreme Court will not have
&nything to do with them." said Knight
k-esterday. "and thpy ought to have
known th.it before they paid Hosmer' 8
rar fare to Los Angeles. With our writ
pending here the court could not even
recognize them, and it did not. If the
trip did not do them any other good It
CRUSHED UNDER WHEELS.
Eddie Collins, a Bright Boy, Run Over and
Killed by a Sand Wagon While Piay
ing on the Street. His Father
Is With the Third Ar
tillery, Manila.
Eddie Collins, a bright boy four and a half years of age, was run over
and killed yesterday afternoon by a sand wagon driven by one of Warren
& Malley's teamsters. The boy lived at 1005 Francisco street, and was
playing on Leavenworth street, between Bay and Francisco, when the
wagon came along, knocking him down, the wheels passing over him.
The teamster drove on and left tho mangled body of the boy on the street!
An undertaker happened to be driving past at the time and he picked
up the boy and drove as fast aa he could to the Receiving Hospital. His
leg was fearfully crushed, and Drs. Thompson and Morrison performed
the operation of resection of the hip joint. The boy died a few minutes
after the operation. It was found that the wheels had also passed over
and crushed the abdomen. Before the body was sent to the Morgue the
boy'B mother, with a baby in her arms, called at the hospital, and her
grief was pitifv.l when she was informed that her boy was dead. She In
sisted upon seeing his body, and her cries were heartrending. What adds
to the sadness of the poor mother Is the fact that her husband is in Ma
nil i with the Third Artillery.
John Curry, who had charge of the team, was arrested last night and
charged with manslaughter. According to the statement he made to the
police he did not see the boy. He knew nothing 1 of the accident until some
time afterward, when he returned to the scene and was informed of what
had happened.
, they kept falling: as the rails reached
down the valley and until Bakersfleld,
the present terminus, was reached. It
has been of incalculable benefit to the
section It serves, but It can go no
further until Its field has been widened.
To do this it was decided to reach down
to Los Angeles and there connect with
the Santa Fe. a line with transconti
nental connections. This would make
the little road started as a protest
against Injustice and greed a power
from the East to San Francisco Bay.
The stockholders were asked to turn
their stock over to the trustees, accept
j ing in return a guarantee that within
three months if the combination had
! proved successful the shares they
turned In at $40 should be paid for at
| $100. All or nearly all complied with
I this preliminary step at once. In the
j meanwhile capitalists had taken hold of
the matter and surveyors were already
in the field laying out the extension on
i to Los Angeles.
It was a big undertaking: and an lm
[ portant one, and for that reason Mr.
i Doyle addressed the directors offering
â  such advice as he thought the occasion
demanded.
When the meeting was called to order
yesterday Mr. Phelan submitted a num
ber of questions which he had carefully
prepared, dealing with every phase of
the transfer, and these were taken up
and discussed and answered to the sat
isfaction of all, including Mr. Phelan
himself. The result of the session was
the submission of a resolution of confi
dence in the directors and indorsing the
plan which they are so ably carrying
out. This resolution was seconded by
Mr. Phelan. It is quoted above.

THE SA]ST FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1898.
TALKED OF MILK AND BUTTER.
The California Dairymen's Convention Considers Questions of Great
Interest to Their Business â After the Trade
of the Orient.
THE annual convention of the Cali
fornia Dairy Association opened at
the Chamber of Commerce yester
day afternoon with each of forty
of the cow-grazing counties of the
State represented by Its best-informed
dairymen. First Vice President A. P.
Martin of Petaluma presided. He was
assisted by Second Vice President d<s
Long, Secretary S. E. Watson and
Treasurer W. H. Roussell, and, thanks
to their skillful management, the af
ternoon's work was accomplished with
out hitch or hindrance.
The afternoon programme was as
Interesting to the man who does not
understand the science of silos or bal
anced rations or the runnfng of a sep
arator as to the man who does. It
consisted solely of, the reading of a
number of interesting papers prepared
by men of the highest attainments in
the art of dairying, and based upon the
practical and costly experience of years
in the business.
One of the first and most note
worthy papers read during yesterday's
session was that of L. Y. Chlashi, a
dairyman of Tokio, Japan, and a
graduate of the dairy' school of Wis
consin University. In his paper Mr.
Chlashi emphasized the Importance of
adhering closely to the declared ob
ject of the Dairy Associationâ the per
fecting of the facilities for the making
of dairy products in California and the
fostering of an export trade.
In this connection he said:*
A growing demand for dairy products.
PERSECUTION
ALLEGED BY
MRS, SUTRO
Reason for the Filing
of a Suit.
HER HUSBAND'S CRUEL ACT
BEAT HER AND NOW WOULD
LEAVE HER PENNILESS.
His Action to Compel the Foreclosure
of a Mortgage the Culmination
of Much Unwarranted
Abuse.
If the allegations of Mrs. Henrietta L.
B. Sutro are true the action on the part
of her husband, Edgar E. Sutro, who
lately filed suit to compel the foreclosure
of a mortgage on property held in trust,
of which his wife is the beneficiary,. Is
without precedent in the legal annals
of this city, as it shows a husband en
deavoring to deprive his wife of means
of livelihood. Mrs. Sutro contends that
the suit, tiled by her husband. In which
she is joined as defendant with William
Crane Spencer, is simply the culmination
of abuse and persecution she has been
forced to endure for a number of years.
The case was partly heard before Judge
Hebbard yesterday, and at the present
stage of the proceedings Mrs. Sutro has
carried her points. As before stated Su
tro peeks to cftmpel the enforcement of
a mortgage for $8571 80, which, it is al
leged, he executed to Defenuant Spencer
on June 3, 1896. The plaintiff states that
his father, Adolph Sutro, deeded aome
valuable property to trustees for the
benefit of his wife and children. Edgar
Sutro, as one of the beneficiaries, mort
gaged his share of the property, held in
trust, to Spencer. Subsequently the
plaintiff deeded his reversionary rights
In the trust property to his wife for her
benefit and their minor son, A. G. Sutro.
Mrs. Sutro now refuses to recognize the
validity of the mortgage, and Spencer
declines to press his claim for payment.
Sutro prays the court to declare the
mortgage valid and to compel his wife to
recognize it. He avers that the interest
is accumulating at the rate of 8 per cent
per year, compounded monthly, and that
In the event the debt 1b not liquidated it
will soon consume the entire property.
In conclusion he asks that a receiver be
appointed to care for the property dur
ing the litigation and for a decree de
claring the mortgage valid and provid
ing for its foreclosure.
Subsequent to the filing of the suit an
order to show cause why a receiver
should not be appointed was served upon
the defendants. Yesterday proceedings
In court were inaugurated. A brie/ hear
ing resulted hi the court dissolving the
motion to show cause and denied the mo
tion to appoint a receiver. A demurrer
to the complaint was then filed by Mrs.
Sutro's attorney, and later a petition for
alimony was presented. The application
for alimony, which Is also Included In
such as butter, cheese and condensed milk,
in Japan, China. HawaM and other Orien
tal countries, makes dairying in California
one of the most Important of Its rural in
dustries, which fact should induce a very
careful attention by the people and Legis
lature of the State.
San Francisco is and will ever be the most
important point for the Oriental commerce,
especially so with dairy products, because
these products require quick transportation
and San Francisco has the best facilities
for this trade.
Treasurer W. H. Roussell read for
C. H. Sessions of Los Angeles a well
written paper on "Alfalfa as a Dairy-
Crop," In which. In reference to the
advisability of foods balanced with
the object of getting- the largest
amount of protein at the minimum of
expense, Mr. Sessions said:
A very good combination can be made by
feeding- alfalfa with the grain hays, green
or dry corn fodder, corn ensilage, beets and
pumpkins, and without buying grain.
At present we are feeding 20 pounds al
falfa hay, 4 pounds oat hay and 30 pounds
green corn fodder with good results. Thin
makes a ratio of 1:4.6. This gives us an
excess of protein, but as it is produced with
cheap feede it may be cheaper than to try
to balance it with more concentrated food,
such as cornmeal or barley.
Milk produced by alfalfa hay is of the
best quality, being well up in solids and
butter fats. Green alfalfa, either pastured
or fed in an uncured state, while making a
good milk, gives it an objectionable flavor
which most people dUUke.
AVhile agreeing with Mr. Sessions
that green alfalfa hay Imparted an
undesirable taste and odor to milk,
R. G. Sneath of the Consumers' Ice
and Jersey Farm Dairy said he had
found it possible to eradicate this
drawback by a simple system of
aeration.
the answer, resulted in a continuance of
the case, as Judge Hebbard wished to
look into the law bearing upon the point
raised in the application.
Mrs. Sutro, in her answer, states that
her husband is a young man of good
physique and physically Bound and able
to earn a good living by his labor, but
that he does not choose to labor and sup
port her. On March 1, 1596, young Sutro,
it is alleged, willfully and without cause
abandoned and deserted his wife and
child and has since lived apart from
them. By preference, avers Mrs. Sutro,
her husband has "habitually spent his
time and money in the company and bo
ciety of lewd and dissolute persons, both
male and female." To further show the
incentive which prompted Sutro to file
the suit to take the property from her
hands Mrs. Sutro alleges that on May 11
her husband brutally assaulted her. He
struck and abused her and left the marks
of his fists upon her body. Many times
prior to the date mentioned Mrs. Sutro
says her husband assaulted her in a cruel
and brutal manner. Not content with
this abuse he now seeks to deprive her of
her sole means of support. . Mrs. Sutro
further states that she has always con
ducted herself with kindness toward her
husband and always had and still enjoys
the confidence and respect of her hus
band's family and of his father and
mother during their lifetime.
In conclusion Mrs. Sutro asks that the
court make an order compelling her hus
' band to pay into her hands sufficient
funds to enable her to defend the action
filed against her. She states in her de
murrer that her husband has no legal |
right to attempt to deprive her of her
sole means of support. If he has she asks
that he be made to bear the expense of
the trial. She contends that he has not,
however, and asks that the mortgage
be declared invalid and no lien upon the
trust estate in her hands.

Mr. Sneath also read an interesting
paper on "Refrigeration," in which
he gave to his hearers much practi
cal advice upon his subject, upon
which he is an expert.
Among the other papers read was
one on the "Question of Creamery
Wages." by Jules Jorgens. W. H.
Roussell dealt entertainingly with
"Dairying in California From "a Birds
eye View," and Professor E. J. Wick
son of the University of California
dealt with "Our Opportunity for Dairji
Exports."
A letter from Secretary of Agricul
ture Wilson was read, asking Secre
tary Sam Watson to ascertain for the
department what refrigerator facili
ties were available on this coast and
on trans-Pacific boats. Henry E. Al
vord, chief of the dairy division, alsc
communicated with Mr. Watson, say
ing that the department wished to ex
tend to the Pacific Coast the experi
ments that it is making with export
shipments of dairy products, and ask
ing that a report of facilities be ren
dered.
To-day at 10 o'clcok the executive
business of the convention will be be
gun, and in the afternoon reports of
the different committees will be con
sidered.
An additional lot of delegates ar
rived last evening, and to-day's meet-
Ing, it Is expected, will be a lively one.
NORSES UP IN
ARMS AGAINST
JUDGE TROUTT
"Cessie" Kelly Taken
From Them.
HER GRANDMOTHER WINS
AWARDED THE CUSTODY OF THE
PRETTY CHILD.
With Tearful Faces They Listen to
the Verdict of the Court De
priving Them of Their
Pet.
The nurses of the City and County Hos
pital are up In arms against Judge
Troutt. They consider that he did wrong
In awarding Mary Francis Cleveland
Kelly, the "sunshine of the hospital." as
the nurses affectionately refer to her, to
Mrs. Kelly, her grandmother. The mother
of the child is a cripple. On account of
her physical deformity the doctors at the
hospital had to resort to the Caesarian
operation in order to remove the child.
This was about a year ago. The nurses
became greatly attached to the baby, and
concluded to adopt it. .
To their surprise yesterday they were
served with a notice to produce the in
fant in Judge Troutt's court, as Mrs.
Kelly, the grandmother, had sued out a
writ for the purpose of getting possession
of her daughter's offspring. In obedience
to the writ Miss Kane, acting head nurse
at the hospital, appeared in court with
the child in her arms.
After listening to the statement of Mrs.
Kelly Judge Troutt ordered the child
given to her grandmother. With much re
luctance Miss Kane handed the baby to
Mrs. Kelly, who at once left the court
room.
"I think it is a shame," remarked one
of the nurses last night, "that Judge
Troutt should see fit to deprive us of the
little treasure. We were all greatly at
tached to the baby, and intended to rear
it as if it were one of our own. Only re
cently we had an offer from a wealthy
man of Carson City to adopt the child.
We could not part with it, and so de
clined to accept his offer. After all our
trouble this woman appears on the scene
and succeeds in getting possession of our
little darling.
"If we had known that Mrs. Kellv was
after the baby we would have made a
bitter fight to retain possession of it As
it was Miss Kane went into court not
knowing that little 'Cessie,' as we' call
her, was to be taken away from us
Judge Troutt merely heard Mrs. Kelly's
story and then awarded her the custody
of the child."
On learning that "Cessie" had been
taken away from them many of the
nurses shed tears, so attached were they
to the child.
