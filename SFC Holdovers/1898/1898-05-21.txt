Instructions were to-day tele
graphed to Admiral Sampson at Key
West to coal and provision his ships
without delay, to take on board all
available supplies of ammunition and
start at the earliest possible moment in
pursuit of the Spanish fleet now be
lieved to be at Santiago de Cuba.
These explicit and manda
tory instructions are believed
to outline, the preparations re
ferred to in a press dispatch
from Key West late this aft
ernoon, stating that "events
of surpassing interest are ex
pected to develop near here
within twenty -four hours,
details of the movements not
being permitted to pass the
censor." Secretary Long to
day suspended the rule re
garding the giving out of
news concerning fleet move
ments long enough to con
firm two important press dis
patches, one locating the
Spanish fleet at Santiago and
the other announcing the ar
rival of Admiral Sampson at
Key West.
Concerning the first repoit
the Secretary would only say
that from the information re
ceived by the department it
was believed that Admiral
Cervera has entered the har
bor of Santiago de Cuba with
his fleet The earliest report
made to the department by
Admiral Sampson upon his
arrival at Key West embraced
the intelligence that the mag
azines of certain of his ships
were in need of replenishing,
having been depleted during
the bombardments in which
the vessels had been en
gaged.
Subsequently, by an ex
change of dispatches, it was
developed that by a redistri
bution of the shells of cer
tain calibers among the ves
sels of the fleet only a few
of the larger sizes would be
lacking and could be pro
cured -at Key West without
delay. Hence the depart
ment does not expect that
Admiral Sampson will remain
more than twenty-four hours
off the Florida coast. â

fleet fight or run

problem that the ad

If Cervera means either to

is believed he has been ad
vised from Madrid to-day of

MADRID, May 20, 8 a. m.â At
10 o'clock last evening the Minis
ter of Marine. Captain Aunon, re
ceived a dispatch from Admiral
Cervera, in command of the Cape
Verde squadron of the Spanish
fleet. It read:
"SANTIAGO DE CUBA,
May 19. â This morning I
have without incident entered
this port accompanied by
squadron. CEBVEBA."
The Minister of Marine imme
diately went to the residence of
tho Premier. Senor Sagp.sta, and
communicated this information.
Up then proceeded to the palace
for the purpose of informing the
Queen Regent, but her Majesty
had already retired, and the
news was conveyed to her by the
Infanta Isabel.
Captain Aunon then went to
the Admiralty and cabled his
congratulations to Admiral Cer
vera on bis arrival at Santiago
de Cuba.
Admiral Cervera, says a cable
dispatch from Santiago de Cuba,
did not sight an American ship
during the voyage. He an
nounces that the crews of his
ships are in perfect health and
enthusiastic. Continuing, the
dispatch says:
"The blockading vessels quick
ly left on the approach of the
squadron, whose arrival has
created the greatest excitement
and enthusiasm at Santiago.
Immediately crowds of people
thronged the quays and cheered
our sailors. Havana's relief at
the safe arrival of the fleet is
very great, as it was feared the
American ships which left the
blockade there had gone to inter
cept the Spanish fleet. It is now
believed the Americans fled in or
der to avoid a reverse."
A Spanish official version of
the engagement they say has
taken place off Santiago de Cuba
yesterday previous to the arri
val of the Spanish fleet says the
American warships were re
pulsed, and adds that one of
them was injured.

ANGLO-SAXON iLLIANCE
PLEASING TO SPAIN.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
VALENCIA, May 20.â People feel re
lieved here that the advanced Spanish
squadron finally arrived across the At
lantic, even if only to play a game of
hide and seek among the West India
Islands.
Its return to Spain without striking a
blow or giving any evidence of ita
strength would have been regarded as
a moral defeat.
A large and influential section of thÂ«
Spanish press, far from regarding the
suggested Anglo-American alliance
with apprehension, hails it with a sort
of grim satisfaction. With England as
a declared enemy, openly allied with
the United States, Spain, It argues,
should no longer stand alone In her tre
mendous and unequal struggle. The
big European powers, which, under
cover of selfish neutrality, have hitherto
turned a deaf ear to the cry of Justice
and outraged international right and
morality, would then be forced to take
up the cause of this country from mo
tives of self-interest, the only lever
said to move them.
EVIDENCE OF THE
STRICT CENSORSHIP.
ST. THOMAS, D. W. 1., May 20.â
| Important arrival from the north at
; noon to-day.
This dispatch illustrates the strict
ness of the censorship which the Gov
ernment for good reasons has estab
lished over cable dispatches. Corre-
I spondents are not permitted to cable

The Herald-Ball's correspondent has
; done the best he could. As there would
i hardly have been any objection made

â¦ which are of great interest to them, in
view of the fact that the insurgents
have a considerable force in the rear of
Santiago. They assert that it will be
useless for the Spanish admiral to at
tempt to land provisions and supplies
for Blanco's aid< as there is no railroad
communication between Santiago and
Havana, and an overland trip would oc
cupy from six weeks to two months.
The Cuban insurgents have had no
difficulty in controlling operations in
this territory, and Gomez's marauding
band would like nothing better than a
chance to capture sujiplies intended for
the relief of Havana. The only thing
Cervera can do, the Junta believes, is to
establish a base of operations at San
tiago and keep in tuoch with the
couriers which the Spanish Government
has undoubtedly dispatched to several
ports in the West Indies.
It is regarded as extremely doubtful
that the Spanish fleet will await the ar
rival of Sampson's squadron at San
tiago.
If a battle occurs within a few
days it is likely to be fought in the
Yucatan channel or in the neighbor
hood of Havana.
While the Spanish fleet is known to
be in Cuban waters, there will be no in
vasion of the island by American troops
until it has been disposed of. This
does not mean that the projected expe
dition has been abandoned, but merely
that the administration does not think
it wise to land a large force at a time
when it may be necessary to withdraw
from it the support of Sampson's fleet
in order to attack Spanish vessels else
where.
The report that General Miles favors
postponing the invasion until October
cannot be officially verified and is de
nied by his closest friends. The propo
sition is not entertained at the White
House.
After the Cabinet meeting to-day
Secretary Long said he expected to hear
nothing for several days.
"So completely has the Spanish strat
egy board covered up the evolutions
of the Spanish shies of war," said he,
"that it is difficult even to hazard a
guess as to the date of the next engage
ment."
"Will there be any engagement at
all?"
"I cannot say," he replied. "Of
course we will try to force a battle, but
we must catch our Spaniard before we
do anything to him."
The Cabinet discussed the matter of
the Philippine expedition and decided to
send as many troops as may be re
quired.
Major General Merritt arrived here
this morning and was an early caller at
the War Department. He was accom
panied by his aids de camp, Lieutenants
T. B. Mott and Harry C. Hale.
General Merritt is en route to San
Francisco, and only stopped over to
complete preparations for the Philippine
expedition. He spent most of the
morning at the War Department in con
sultation with Secretary Alger and Ad
jutant General Corbin. The Philippine
question was considered at great length
in almost every possible phrase. Gen
eral Merritt was asked if he had com-
pleted arrangements and replied "Yes.
in a measure. I have seen the Secretary
of War and the President."
"Will you return to New York before
leaving for San Francisco?"
"No; when I left New York I start
ed for the Philippines, and only stopped
at Washington at the request of the
President and Secretary of War. I
will leave Washington for San Fran
cisco to-morrow morning. I may stop
in Chicago for a day."
General Merritt was asked if he ex
pected tc get a sufficient force of men
for the expedition and said: "I expect
to get what I have asked for."
"How many regulars do you expect?"
"About 5000."
"What will be the probable size of the
entire expedition?"
"Anywhere from 16,000 to 17,000 men
or thereabouts."
Among the members of General Mer
ritt's staff already selected by him are:
Colonel J. B. Babcock, adjutant gen
eral; Lieutenant Colonel J. W. Pope,
quartermaster; Colonel R. P. Hughes,
inspector general; Captain Mott and
Captain Hale and Colonel Porter of the
Engineers.
POLICEMAN ACCUSED
OF TALKING TREASON.
A Charge of Disloyalty Preferred
Against an Officer on the
San Jose Force.
SAN JOSE, May 20.â E. S. Hinman,
a well-known resident of this city, to
day filed charges with the Police and
Fire Commission, accusing Police Of
ficer James F. Prindeville with having
uttered sentiments that were disloyal
and treasonable to the United States.
Hinman alleges that Prindeville said:
"They had no right to send the Maine
there. She went in for trouble and
she got just what she deserved. The
United States has no cause to go to war
with Spain, and ought to be licked."
The commission gave Prindeville ten
days in which to file a written answer.
Police Sergeant Thomas F. Hughes,
who went to Santa Cruz on Thursday
on an excursion and is alleged to have
indulged in a drunken escapade with a
number of women, was suspended for
ten days for leaving the city without
permission.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ON BOARD THE CRUISER
CHARLESTON, via Vallejo, May 20.â
The Charleston will sail for Manila at
11 a. m. to-morrow. This is official. The
repairs to the cruiser were finished at
5 o'clock this morning, and Captain
Glass knows now that his ship is ready
for her voyage across the Pacific. It
was found when the after condenser
was opened y sterday that but one tube
in the vacuum chamber was leaking.
The leak was a bad one, for it was this
condenser that had given most trouble.
The leaky tube was replaced ! y a sound
one from the lot received last night
from the Union Iron Works, the lot be
ing tubes it had been designed to put
into the condenser of the battle-ship
Wisconsin. Then the condenser was
tested most thoroughly and found to
be perfect.
The force from Mare Island yard la
bored all night and by midnight had
opened the forward condenser, where
seven tubes were found to be leaking.
The leaks were slight in all cases, but
the defective tubes were taken out and
replaced nevertheless. At 5 a. m. the
work was completed and the Charles
ton was once mure ready for sea and in
better shape, certainly, than she had
been when she made her first start on
Wednesday. All of to-day the ship has
been moored in the steam waiting for
the rest of the tubes received from San
Francisco to be cut to tit her con
denser. Captain Glass, it is clear, pro
poses to be prepared for all emer
gencies.
There Is yet some slight adjustment
of the compasses to be made. The ship
will reach Red Rock between noon and
1 o'clock to-morrow, and it will take an
hour and a half â certainly not longerâ
to swing ship and correct the deviation.
That will be the last preliminary. Not
later than 2:30, Captain Glass esti
mates, he will head through the Golden
Gate. He will run down through
Raccoon Straits, making a stop at San
Francisco.
The city people. If it is clear, will have
a chance to see the warship passing
through the Gate. She is worth seeing
as she lies grim and dark in the stream
here. She will be better w< th seeing

else in her war paint, her great guns
gleaming as the only bright spots on
her somber sides and the beauty of Old
Glory fluttering at the peak.

HOW EUROPE VIEWS
CERVERA'S MANEUVER.
Spanish Strategists Have Forced
America Into a Defensive
Attitude.
LONDON, May 20.â Admiral Cer
vera's maneuver excites the keen
est speculation here. In some
quarters the whole story is regarded
as a ruse designed to hurry the Spanish
Government, and the spreading of it
broadcast is supposed to hide sinister
motives. The bulk of opinion, however,
regards the news n authentic, and is
inclined to the belief that Admiral Cer
vera well knows re-enforcement is at
hand and that otherwise he would not
have risked bein? bottled up at San
tiago.
The Daily News directs attention to
the great secrecy preserved about what
is happening at the Canaries, where the
cables have been seized and the censor
ship is severe. It says:
"The question now arises whether
t!ie reserve squadron from Cadiz is not
already half way across the Atlantic.
One thing comes clear. The Spanish
strategists have a prearranged plan of
operation, while the Americans have
been forced by circumstances into a
defensive attitude. However, If Cer
vera is in Santiago de Cuba it ought
not to be difficult for Admiral Sampson
to find him. Thus it is possible that
there may be a big fight within a few
days."
The Daily Chronicle, on the other
hand, think* Admiral Cervera has
walked into a trap, from which he can
not escape, "thanks partly to the im
becility of the Spanish Government In
publishing his dispatch, which was
doubtless done to avert domestic
evils."
The Dally Chronicle concludes: "As
to hinted negotiations by Spain with
the powers, the best answer to them
would be an American victory, which
we hope to record Monday or Tues
day."
The Times says editorially: "Whether
publication will assist the success of
Admiral Cervera's operations Is ques
tionable, but it has undoubtedly helped
the new Ministers to make a favorable
debut in the Cortes. Certainly the sit
uation has Increased in interest."
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily News says: "Admiral Cervera's
dispatch from Santiago de Cuba to the
Minister of Marine contained further
details for the information of the Gov
ernment alone. It is pointed out here
that the American plan was to gain
command of the sea as a condition to
future movements. Admiral Cervera's
brilliant move â reminding one of Lord
Nelson's race from the West Indies to
Trafalgar and his escape from the
French â deprives America of the com
mand of the sea and demonstrates to
the world that the blockade of Cuba is
merely nominal."
"Admiral Cervera has given the slip
to two powerful fleets that have been
scouring the ocean for a fortnight in
an endeavor to catch him. All the
American schemes depend thereupon.
Admiral Cervera, with four cruisers
and a few destroyers, alone in the At
lantic, ignoring events in Cuba and in
Porto Rico and the position of the
American squadron, has outmaneu

"The torpedo-boats Azor, Rayo and

and covering their lights by night. The

BERNABE AT
LAST FORCED
TO DEPART
Goes F ror 0 Canada To-Day, but
Leaves Behind a Consul to
flct as Spy.
NEW YORK, May 20. â A Montreal special to the Herald says: It has
not been possible for Spain to postpone the departure of Senor Polo y
Bernabe any longer. To-morrow he will sail with all his staff by a Domin
ion liner for Liverpool.
He leaves behind, however, the Spanish Consul to try to continue gatn
ering information for the Spanish Government relative to United States mili
tary and naval movements. Authorities here are closely watching the Con
sul, and he will be promptly placed under arrest if the slightest deviation
from the neutrality law is detected.
Senor Polo y Bernabe now practically admits that he was requested to
return to Madrid, for it was learned to-night from an unimpeachable
source that the Canadian Government advised his departure. Owing to the
diplomatic fiction that such questions are not dealt with by the Canadian
Cabinet, it was possible for our Secretary of State to say that the Govern
ment had not interfered. The action was taken by the Governor-General,
who is the Queen's direct representative here, and who in such matters Is
supposed to, but never does, act without the knowledge of the Cabinet

FOUR BIG BUT
NOT BRAVE MEN.
They Pluked at Camp Tanner and
Received Harsh Treatment
From Comrades.
CAMP TANNER, Springfield, 111..
May 20. â Four men of the Fourth Regl
ment who at the last moment decided
not to be sworn in, were pelted with
mud, chased into a creek, and finally
drummed out of camp amid the jeers
of their late comrades. Four men of
Company D, of Belleville, fell out of
the ranks Just as the mustering officer
had the men raise their hands to be
sworn in. The men refused to volun
teer their services and sneaked away
amid the hisses of other members of
the crack company of the Fourth Regi
ment.
The four were: "Walker Knolboch,
Phil Martin, Adam Martin and J. L.
Lrenare. They were the four largest
men of the company, only one of them
being under 6 feet tall.
When the mustering of the company
was completed the four members which
"fluked" were followed through the
rear of the camp and were first pelted
with mud.
The treatment gradually became
more severe, and one of the fellows
cried and begged for mercy. All of the
four were finally pushed into the creek,
and there is no telling what would have
been done to them had not an officer
put in an appearance and ordered the
other members of the company to de
sist The four were then drummed out
of camp. All of the 150 soldiers followed
the drum and hissed the four as far as
they could see them.

TECHNICAL CHANGES
MUST NOW BE MADE.
So the Senate Finance Committee
Will Devote One More Day to
the War Revenue Bill.
WASHINGTON, May 20.â The Senate
Committee on Finance finds it neces
sary to make additional amendments
to the war revenue bill before proceed
ing further with the measure, and an
adjournment was taken at the close of
to-day's session until Monday In order
to allow the committee to devote the
entire day to-morrow to this work. A
session of the committee was held to
day, but there was not sufficient time
to reach a conclusion. There is no di
vision on party lines on most of the
changes required, as they are largely
of a technical character.
The most important change which
has been urged and which now seems
likely to be made is that altering the
tobacco schedule. It looks as if the
House rate of 12 cents a pound wiould
be restored on manufactured tobacco
and as if there would be a change in
the schedule, as it affects cigarettes.
There are some technical errors to be
corrected in schedule B, regarding pro
prietary medicines.
The question raised here is as to the
time the stamp should be affixed, and
there is much difference of opinion on
this point. There is also a desire to
have the mutual life insurance com
panies exempted from some at the re
quirements of the provision in regard
to insurance organizations, and a
movement to restore the House pro
visions relating to the building and
loan associations. It is probable other
matters will be considered at to-mor
row's meeting.
Shoes for the Volunteers.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May 9 (via Vera Cruz,
May 13).â The weight of the blockade
is beginning to be felt here. Business is
almost at a complete standstill, and
there is hardly any movement in the
.streets, which have a sort of holiday
ippearance. The parks are almost de
serted, and there are very few people
o be seen on the Plaza dcs Arms at
light, although the band plays there,
:nd everything passible is done to keep
ip the spirits of the people.
There is a feverish desire to leave the
â ?land. and over 5000 people are booked
t the office of the consignees of the
Â» rench steamer Lafayett*. which leaves
aero to-day for Vera Cruz, Mexico,
with this letter, which will be posted at
that port. In fact, an actual panic now
prevails, while, when the blockade
commenced, there was a feeling almost
of serenity among all classes. But
things have changed. The grim earn
estness of the Americans is steadily
forcing itself upon the minds of even
the most hot-headed Spanish officers,
though the latter are working vigor
ously at the fortifications, which have
been considerably strengthened and
improved since the war began. The
Spaniards, it must be admitted, are
preparing to fight as desperately as
possible under the circumstances.
Many families without means, desir
ing to emigrate, are endeavoring to
borrow money from more fortunate
people in order to pay their passage.
But it is impossible to see how their
condition will be improved to any con
siderable extent, even if they do suc
ceed in leaving the blockaded city, for
they have been rendered penniless and
their chance of earning a livelihood in
any foreign country is very slim.
There is considerable feeling against
the men who are desirous of leaving
the city, and posted on the corners of
houses all over the town you can see
such notices as follows: "Here are sold
women's skirts for men who are aban
doning the island of Cuba."
There has been no disorder in the city
or in the provinces, so far as is known,
though it is true people here are en
tirely ignorant of what is transpiring
at Santiago, no mail having been re
ceived from there for some time past
and the cable being in the hands of the
Government and almost exclusively
devoted to military operations, which
are about limited to evacuating the in
terior towns and . concentrating the
Spanish forces at or about the large
cities.
It is reported here that Santa Cruz
del Sur, on the south coast of Puerto
Principe, has fallen into the hands <>f
the insurgents. If this is the case the
latter now have a port at which their
friends can land arms, ammunition
and supplies without interference.
Other important events are said to
have transpired at Santa Cruz del Sur.
The officers of the Spanish gunboat
Cuba Espanola have reached Sancti
Spiritus, province of Santa Clara, by
land and are on their way to Tunas,
and from there by coasting steamer to
Cienfuegos. One report has It that the
commander of the Cuba Espanola
burned or blew up his vessel In order
to save It from falling Into the hands
of the Insurgents. Another version of
the affair says the gunboat may have
been captured by the insurgents.

MERRITT AT WASHINGTON.
Consults the War Department as to
the Philippine Troops.
WASHINGTON, May 20. â General
"Wesley Merritt was at the "War Depart
ment nearly all day In consultation
concerning the troops which are to be
allowed to him for the work he has In
hand. It has been decided to give the
greater portion of the Fifteenth Infan
try, now on the Pacific coast, the entire
Eighteenth and Twenty-third Regi
ments of Infantry, two batteries from
the Third Artillery and four troopa of
cavalry.
The remainder of tha expedition will
be made up of volunteers.
The department to-day gave orders
sending the battalion of infantry from
North Dakota to San Francisco to
join the expedition. It is the expec
tation of the quartermaster's depart
ment to send to the Philippines a con
signment of 40,000 hammocks to be
purchased, and which are regarded as
essential to the comfort of the soldiers
in tropical climes.
General Greely has suggested, and
the President has nominated half a
dozen officers for positions on the signal
corps party which accompanies the ex
pedition under General Merritt. For
the rank and file of the corps, recruit
ing will be resorted to in the Pacific
States.
At 10:30 to-night it was announced
at the adjutant-general's office that
104,000 volunteers had been mustered
into the United States army. It is ex
pected that from now until the re
mainder of the 125,000 men called for
have been mustered, the work will pro
ceed very slowly.TROOPS MAY

"So far as I am individually concerned, I would respond at once to

ascertaining the number of duplicate volumes and then telegraphing to
the trustees of tho library, asking for permission to comply with The
Call's request. You may say that I shall do everything in my power
to provide our boys with whatever books can be spared without doing
any injustice to the interests of the library."

FRANCE AND THIS
COUNTRY FRIENDS.
Pleasant Result of Recent Exchanges
Between the Two Govern-
ments.
WASHINGTON, May 20.â As the re
sult of several recent exchanges be
tween the officials of the State Depart
ment and those of the French Em
bossy, an agreeable understanding has
b^en reached which gives assurance of
t continuance of the traditional friend
ship existing between the United States
and France. It has served to make
clear that each Government has the
fullest confidence In the friendly atti
tude of the other, and many criticisms
or animosities aroused by recent inci
dents in the war have not been shared
by the Government of either country.
French Goods Boycotted.
CINCINNATI, May 20.â Patriotic
feeling has risen to such a pitch here
that leading women are persistently
refusing goods known to be of* French
manufacture. Merchants have found
It to their advantage to remove French

OF FRANCE
President McKinley to
Retain It.'
WILL AID THE EXPOSITION.
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS TO BE
CEMENTED.
Neat Arrangement by Which the
French Government Will Be
Kept From Aiding Spain
in the War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 20.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
President McKinley is taking a deep in- I
terest in pending legislation for Ameri- '
can representation at the Paris expo- ;
sition. His interest is two-fold. He,
believes that proper representation by ;
the United States will be a material I
benefit to commercial interests of this
country.
Aside from this, however, there are
still more important and urgent reasons
for desiring prompt and liberal action
by iiur Congress.
The President is fully alive to the
feeling existing in France against the
United States and to the efforts being
made by the French press to induce
the French Government to mix up in
the pending war with Spain in the in
terest of the latter country. He is anx
ious to do something to counteract
this sentiment and to assure a con
tinuation of the close ties which have
always existed between the United
States and France. He believes that
the Paris Exposition furnishes the op
portunity, and he is accordingly urg
ing his friends in Congress to provide
liberally for the proposed American
commissir.-n. He hopes that Congress
will provide for nine Commissioners
and will appropriate at least $1,000,000
for the exhibit.
Senator Allison, chairman of the Sen
ate Committee on Appropriations, will,
it is understood, favor this proposition
and in doing so will take occasion on
the floor of the Senate to publicly de
clare that the relations existing be
tween the United States and France
were never better than at the present
time, and that there is no foundation
for many reports indicating that
France is not strictly maintaining neu
trality or that this- Government has
any reason to fear France will give its
moral support to Spain. His speech
will be communicated to the French
Government.
AMMUNITION FOUND
ON THE ARGONAUTA.
Court Decides That Five Captured
Vessels Are Legitimate
Prizes of War.
KEY WEST, May 20.â Over forty
cases of ammunition were found to-day
in the Spanish steamer Argonauta, cap
tured during the first days of the war.
It was on board this steamer that Lieu
tenant-Colonel Cortijo, Weyler's broth
er-in-law, was captured, with other
Spanish soldiers, now prisoners at Fort
McPherson.
The discovery of the war supplies on
board the Argonauta will not change
the status of her case before the prize
court; it had already been decided to
day, before the learning of the find,
that the steamer was legitimately a
prize of war, no claims having been
filed by the owners of tne ship or cargo.
A like decision was rendered in the
case of the steamer Ambrosio Bolivar
and the schooners Candidata, Mathilda
and Sophia. The only formality re
maining to make these vessels the ab
solute property of the United States is
the confirmation by the Federal Court
authorities of the findings of the prize
commission.
The cases of the Buena Ventura, the
first capture of the war, and the Pedro,
Catalina, Miguel Jover, Panama and
Guido, all large and valuable steamers,
will have to be tried in regular form
by the United States Court, claims
having been filed by the owners of the
ships and cargoes.
The barkentine rarlos T. Rosas, 750
tons, captured by the New York off Ha
vana, on Tuesday, was brought in here
to-day by a petty officer and a prize
crew. She had on board a cargo of
garlic and Jerked beef.

EULOGIES OF
GLADSTONE
English Statesmen Pay
Tribute.
PARTY LINES FORGOTTEN.
50VERNMENT LEADERS TELL
OF HIS WORTH.
Premier Salisbury Says His "Was a
Great Example, Hardly Paral
leled in the Annals of
History.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 20.â The eulogies of
Mr Gladstone formed a historic epi
sode in the House of Commons to-day.
There were more members assembled
in the House to-day than upon any
occasion since Mr. Gladstone himself
introduced the home rule bill. They
filled every seat and clustered on the
steps of the Speaker's dais, and the
Peers 1 gallery was crowded with the
foremost members of the House of
Lords. The United States Embassa
dor Colonel John Hay, and all the
members of his staff were among the
diplomats present.
After prayer, the House silently
awaited Mr. Balfour for a quarter of
an hour, arid when he arose all heads
were bared. The members were gen
erally attired in black. All the galler
ies were full. The House went into
committee to consider the address to
the Queen in regard to the interment
of the remains of Mr. Gladstone in the
Collegiate Church of St. Peter at West
minster, otherwise Westminster Abbey.
Mr Balfour, the Government leader,
in spite of his illness, was able to move
the address. He prefaced the motion
with a lengthy eulogy of Mr. Gladstone,
speaking with evident emotion. The
Liberal leader, Sir William Vernon
Harcourt. seconded the motion. In do
ing bo, the Liberal leader paid a heart
felt tribute to the deceased statesman,
and John Dillon, the Irish leader, did
the same. The address to the Queen
was then adopted.
In the House of Lords there was a
full attendance of members. The
Marquis of Salisbury spoke feelingly
of Mr. Gladstone, who, he said, was
"ever guided in all his efforts by a
lofty moral idea." Continuing, the
Premier said: "The deceased will not
be remembered so much for his politi
cal work as for the great example,
hardly paralleled in history, of the
great Christian statesman."
The Earl of Klmberly, the Liberal
leader, followed with a touching trib
ute, and the Duke of Devonshire ex
pressed generous appreciation of Mr.
Gladstone's services in behalf of the
Liberal Unionists, saying their sever
ance from Mr. Gladstone was a most
painful incident.
"But," he added, "he could recall no
word from Mr. Gladstone which added
to- the bitterness of the situation."
The Earl of Rosebery delivered an
eloquent panegyric on the deceased
statesman.
It is virtually decided that Mr. Glad
stone's body shall be interred in West
minster Abbey.
Telegrams continue to arrive in great
number at Hawarden Castle from all
parts of the world. Mrs. Gladstone is
as well as can be expected. The Czar
has telegraphed to the widow in Eng
lish, saying: N
"I have just received the painful
news of the decease. I consider it my
duty to express my feelings of sincere
sympathy on the occasion at the cruel
and irreparable bereavement which has
befallen you, as well as the deep regret
which the sad event has Riven me. The
whole civilized World will weep for the
loss of the great statesman whose po
litical values were so widely human
and peaceful. NICHOLAS."

NOT AFRAID OF THE
WHOLE SPANISH FLEET
Captain Claris of the Oregon fished
Not to Be Tangled Up With
lostructions,
NEW YORK, May 20.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
In connection with the trip of the battleship Oregon an Interesting story
Is In circulation at the Navy Department which cannot be confirmed,
but which illustrates the intrepidity of Captain C. E. Clark, command
ing the vessel. Upon his arrival at Rio de Janeiro the War Board took
under serious consideration the question of protecting the battle-ship
from the enemy's fleet, then supposed to be awaiting her at some ad
vantageous point. One or two members of the board urged the advisa
bility of sending a squadron to convoy her to Key West, but this was
scouted by the majority and voluminous instructions were sent to Cap
tain Clark in regard to the course which he should take. The reply
which, it Is said. Captain Clark sent to the department was something
like this: "Please don't tangle me up with instructions. I am not
afraid of the whole Spanish fleet."
Apparently the Spaniards are more afraid of the Oregon than that
vessel is of them. Although the Oregon is unaccompanied on her voy
age through the West Indies by a single ship, the Marietta and Nich
theroy having been left In Brazilian waters, no attempt has seemingly
been made by Admiral Cervera to intercept the American battle-ship,
although the department experts say that it would properly be his pol
icy to destroy detached ships, and especially such great re-enforcement
as the Oregon will undoubtedly be to the American fleet. The Oregon
will arrive at Key West before Sunday or Monday, and upon coaling
will at once join Rear Admiral Sampson.
TEA INDUSTRY
IS DECLINING
Outlook in Japan Not
Assuring.
CROPS DAMAGED BY FROST.
COST OF MANTTFACTXTRING HAS
INCREASED.
Skilled Labor Commands Higher
Wages and America Now Offers
a Poor Market for the
Surplus Product.
TACOMA, May 20.â Reports received
at Yokohama up to May 2 show that
Japan's tea crop was greatly damaged
by a severe frost occurring on April 23.
The damage was most pronounced in
the Shidzuoka and Kyota districts,
where there was already a decrease in
acreage compared with last and pre
vious years.
Japanese papers state that the tea In
dustry is surely declining in several
i districts, owing largely to the increase
j of expenses attendant upon tea manu
! facture.
Estimates fo the cost of picking, fir
ing, etc., amount this year to 8.70 yen
per 30 kemamme, compared with 6.45
yen last year. Skilled labor is found to
be higher throughout the districts thaji
ever before, because of the greatly In
creased cost of living.
The Central Tea Dealers' Guild of
Japan received cablegrams from New
York on April 22 stating that the tea
market prospects there were rendered
very unpromising by the outbreak of
: the Spanish war.
The Guild then sent circulars to tea
dealers throughout Japan urging that
the most stringent rules be adopted in
manufacturing and shipping tea to this
i country, which constitutes Japan's best
j market.
The tea growers are considerably dis
heartened. The last season was a poor
! one, the Japanese market being greatly
! overstocked after June 15, previous to
which shipments were unusually large,
because the United States was expected
to collect a duty on tea after July 1.
GOMEZ IS CLOSING

Eight Hundred Spaniards Put to

has reached that place that General
Gomez, at the head of an army of 15,
000 insurgents, is closing in on Havana.
His advance guard, led by Quentin Bal

with and put to flight 800 Spanish
troops. Santiago de Cuba, according
to the same report, is menaced by 5000
insurgents under General Garcia. The
dispatch also reports that Spanish
warships have been sighted off Yuca
tan, convoying three transports carry
ing troops and provisions for Havana.

He Will Now Meet God
dard and Choynski.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SYRACUSE, N. V., May 20.â The
fight here to-night between Kid McCoy
and Gus Ruhlin, the latter of Cleve
land, resulted in a victory for McCoy
after twenty rounds. Three thousand
persons were in the Alhambra, where
the fight was held. There was little
betting and the showing made by Ruh
lin was a surprise. He stood a lot of
punishment and was always ready to
come back for more. He was apparent
ly strong at the finish. McCoy says he
will now meet .Goddard and then
There was a great difference in
weight of the men, McCoy, according
to his statement, weighing 157
pounds, and Ruhlin, according
to Billy Madden, his manager, tipping
the scales at ISO pounds. Sixty per
cent of the gate receipts are to be di
vided between the men, McGoy taking
75 per cent and Ruhlin 25 per cent, in
place of a $2500 purse.

ter End.
Weylerites Arraign the Cabinet
Because It Follows the Plans
of Its Predecessor.
MADRID, May 20.â The Ministers, In
full uniform, appeared In the Senate to
day.
Owing to the circumstances, the new
Cabinet is already nicknamed the "cir
cumstantial Cabinet." The Premier,
Senor Sagasta, explained the ministe
rial crisis and asserted that the new
Ministry would continue the policy of
the former Ministry. He related how
"Spain did everything to avoid war un
til America, violating all recognized
diplomacy, attacked Spain with an in
justice unprecedented in the annals of
civilized history and compelled Spain
to respond with war to war, which
Spain would continue to the utmost un
til an honorable peace is obtainable."
"This," the Premier continued, "is a
strong policy, and the new Govern
ment will also energetically conduct
negotiations with European and other
states."
Count Penaramiro proposed the Sen
ate's congratulations to Admiral Cer
vera on his arriving safely at Santiago
de Cuba and "cleverly dodging the
American squadrons."
Captain Aunon, the Minister of Ma
rine, responded in the name of the
navy, highly extolling Admiral Cervera.
In so doing he said the arrival of the
Spanish squadron in Cuban waters
would "cement the friendship of the
Cubans with Spain and will prove to
the world that Spain will never aban
don Cuba while the mother country re
tains her vitality."
The congratulations were voted unan
imously.
In taking possession of the admiralty
the new Minister of "Marine made a
patriotic speech to the assembled offi
cers, recalling "the splendid example
set by our sailors at Cavite in dying
for Spain."
In the Chamber Senor Sagasta re
peated his Senate speech. Senor Sil
vela. leader of the Dissident Conserva
tives, replied that his section of the
Conservative party approved the policy
announced by Senor Sagasta and would
support the new Cabinet.
Senor Romero y Robledo. leader of
the Weylerite faction, presented an in
terpellation, maintaining that the ojd
Government was in a crisis in the very
declaration of war, and that if the pres
ent were a continuation of the policy of
the old Cabinet, then the Cabinet also
was in a crisis.
Senor Romero y Robledo then pressed
Senor Gamazo. Minister of Public In
struction and Public Works, to disclose
his individual opinion and to say how

Ruhlin jabbed his left to the face in a
rush He was badly handicapped by his
eye, which made it difficult for him to
Round 10â They exchanged left swings
on the head. McCoy chased Ruhlin
around the ring. The Kid poked a light
left to Ruhlin's stomach, then swung a
left to the head. McCoy uppercut with
a left swing. The Kid was doing a little
leading and seemed waiting to land a de
cisive blow.
Round 11â Ruhlin rushed, but failed to
land McCoy jabbed his left to the wind,
and Gus swung a wild right to the head.
They exchanged rights on the face. Then
McCoy sent a left to the body. Ruhlin
got his man to the ropes, but missed a
great opportunity. McCoys left jabs set
Ruhlin's eye bleeding once more and he
was covered with blood. Gus sent a
right to the face and got a bad upper
cut on the face. Ruhlin was landing
about one in ten of his leads.
Round 12â The Kid rushed and jabbed
a left to the face. He rushed again and
put his left to the wind. The Kid swung
a light left on the jaw and got a light
poke on the face in return. Gus poked his
left to the face.
Round 13â Ruhlin's seconds fed him
brandy during the intermission. They ex
changed left jabs on the face. The Kid
swung a right on the head. Siler cau
tioned Ruhlin for striking low. The Kid

sive work, and finally landed a left swing

far he endorsed the ministerial policy
of the reconstructed Cabinet, insisting
that if the present was a continuation,
of the former policy, then Senor Ga
mazo, unless he had thrown over his
former theories, ought to be in the op
position, not in office.
Senor Gamazo replied that, without
abandoning his present ideas, he had
accepted office patriotically, and would
carry out the Government programme
irrespective of his own personal theo
ries.
Senor Segasta explained that the
Cabinet changes were due to the fact
that several Ministers were "ill and ex
tremely fatigued after the recent anxie
ties." He said the Cabinet found itÃelf
confronted with war or dishonor, and
accepted the former, adding solemnly:
"The Spanish Government will never
accept peace if the territorial integrity
of Spain is not maintained, and other
wise Spain Is determined to fight a tout*
outrance." [Loud cheers.]
Later Senor Sagasta promised a day
to debate the "Red Book." Altogether,
however, the debate was disappointing
to the Chamber and to the public gal
leries, which had expected sensational
scenes.
Professor Salmeron made a speech
vigorously attacking the Cabinet.
In an interview to-day the Minister
of Marine is quoted as saying:
"I am greatly rejoiced at the safs
arrival of the Spanish fleet at Santiago
de Cuba. It is an immense triumph for
the Spanish navy. The sailors who ex
ecuted the movement and those who
planned It are worthy of all praise."
Continuing the Minister said he con
gratulated himself upon the first event
happening in his administration augur
ing so well for the navy and for the
country.
A dispatch from Havana says two
American ships have bombarded Gun
atanamo, and adds that the Spanish
gunboat Santuaro and a regiment of
troops repulsed the attempt to land
there. According to the Spanish ver
sion the Spaniards did not suffer ally
loss, and the Americans retired.
Admiral Camara, the commander of
the Cadiz squadron. Is here receiving
instructions relative to the destination
of his ships, which, it is explained, "de
pends upon the requirements of the
war." The new Minister of Marine has
injected the greatest activity into his
department. It is said he has bfÂ»en
offered war munitions from many quar
ters.
It is evident the new Spanish Cabinet
intends to push the campaign vigorous
ly, and, it is said, the Minister will ne
gotiate actively with the foreign diplo
mats to protect Spain against a com
bination of her enemies.

his right to the face. The Kid swung a
left to the jaw and then clinched. Ruhlin
put a right to the face. Gus jabbed a bad
left to the jaw, and the Kid fell back,
Ruhlin put a left to the face again, and
McCoy swung a left on the ear. The Kid
swung a left on the ear once more in an
attempt to reach the jaw. and failed. Tha
Kid rushed and was blocked. Ruhlin up
percut with the ry?ht. Ruhlin fought well
in this round, and appeared to be very
strong.
Round 18â McCoy poked a light left to
the face. Gus put a hard left to the
face and brought forth cheers when he
repeated it. McCoy fell short on a right
lead and Ruhlin came back with the
left. The Kid rushed and tried to reach
the jaw with a left swing, but failed.
Gus sent his right hard to the body.
Round 19â They fiddled and McCoy at
tempted to step out of the way of a right
jab and nearly slipped to the floor. Gus
poked a terrific left to the face and got
inside of McCoy's right swing. The Kid
rushed and they clinched. The Kid poked
his left to the face. Gus jabbed left and
rushed, and the Kid swung over his
shoulder.
Round 20â Gus swung a left to the body
and fell short, and met the same fate
with a stronger one. The Kid landed
lightly with his left on the face. Gus
sent a right to the face hard, and then
poked his left to the body and his right
to the bead. The Kid swung a left, but
went over the shoulder. Gus put a right
on the body and left on the face, and
they exchanged lefts. Gus drove a hard
right to the kidneys and jabbed his right
to the body and then to the jaw very
hard, with but little return.
The decision was given to McCoy.

NEW EXPEDIENT TO
DESTROY OUR SHIPS
Spanish Officials Are Sending Out
Dummy Hulks Loaded With
Dynamite.
KEY WEST, Fla,. May 20. â The fertile Spanish brain that has been
adopting all sorts of devices to entice the blockading ships within point
blank range of the Havana batteries has been adopting a new expedient
to destroy the warships. The latest device is the sending adrift of
hulks made to resemble torpedo boats, after first loading them with
dynamite, in the hope that American ships would ram them In the
darkness.
Several of these hulks have been sent out of the harbor. One was
sighted two mornings ago off Cardenas by the tug Hudson. It was lying
motionless and appeared to be a torpedo boat. It had two funnels and
a gun over the bow. Signaling the tug Leydon, "that looks like one."
the Hudson steamed down and the Leydon went along. The tugs open
ed fire at three thousand yards, and one of the shots knocked off the
emokestack, which proved to be a wooden structure, for it flew Into
splinters. Satisfied that the boat was merely a derelict the tugs ceased
A similar hulk was sighted by the Wilmington the next day. This
also was rigged up so that it would appear at even a short distance to
be a torpedo boat destroyer. The Wilmington blazed away and sunk
the hulk As it was sinking the forward part of the craft was blown
out, and cans containing explosives were picked up after the wreck
sank. These facts were reported to Commodore Watson.

LAKE BENNETT
Contracts for Material
Awarded.
WORK IS TO BEGIN SOON.
FORCE OF LABORERS WILL BE
SENT AT ONCE.
The Line Is to Be Built Over White
Pass, and May Ultimately
Extend Four Hundred
Miles Inland.
SEATTLE, Slay 20.â Within a few
weeks a railroad will be in operation
between Skaguay and Lake Bennett,
which, it is said, will ultimately run to
the Yukon River. The work of con
structing the road is in the hands of
the Pacific Contract Company, a
branch of the White Pass Railroad
Company, which is to operate the sys
tem.
To-night contracts were awarded in
this city for the purchase of material
necessary in the building of the road,
as well as for rolling stock.
Arrangements were made by which
the construction trains will be shipped
to Skaguay from Seattle the next few
days. A large gang of laborers will be
tent north with the rolling stock, and
will be put at work as soon as it ar
rives and be kept in Alaska until the
ruad is built and in operation.
E. C. Haw.i ns of Denver is managing
head of th* construction department.
He taid tu-iiijht:
"The contracts which we have just
let involve thousands of dollars. The
Illinois Steel Company of Chicago,
which is represented in Seattle by Wil
liam Piggott and William D. Hopins,
has been awarded the contract to sup
ply all the steel rails. The contract to
supply timber, which includes material
for ties, bridges, roundhouses, stations,
etc., was awarded to G. M. Forbes of
Trinidad, Colo. This timber, I under
stand, is to be obtained in both the
State of Washington and in Alaska,
and is to be of a superior quality.
"The contract to supply the rolling
Btock has been let to the Pullman Car
Company of Pullman, 111., and accord
ing to the terms of this contract thirty
five cars and three engines, which are
to constitute the construction train,
will be delivered to Skaguay imme
diately. We have perfected arrange
ments to send our first gang of labor
ers to Skaguay next Sunday, and it
will be taken thither by M. J. Henry, a
railroad engineer, who has the reputa
tion of being one of the most skillful
railroa.d constructors on the Pacific
Coast.
"The road Is to be built over the
White Pass to a point on Lake Bennett,
a distance of approximately forty
miles, but from there it is the intention
to rush the work of construction to
Fort Selkirk, a distance of nearly 400
miles from Skaguay. The men inter
ested in the White Pass Railway Com
pany are of both Biitish and American
extraction and they have arranged
matters in such a way with the Gov
ernments of both the United States and
Canada that the most feasible route
can be adopted."

Washington to-morrow for Hampton
Roads to take command of the fine pro

THE CAPTURE OF A
SPANISH WARSHIP.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. May 20. â The Norwegian steamer America,
from Baltimore, has arrived at Port Antonio, bringing news of the cap
ture of a Spanish warship. When some distance from Jamaica yesterday
the America saw an American warship towing a Spanish gunboat. The
vessels were too far distant for their names to be distinguished, but the
captain says that the United States vessel that was doing the towing was
either the St. Loui t. Paul.
vacancy may not be filled at present,
though there is favorable mention of
the name of Admiral Ramsay, retired,
In that connection.
Another loss to the department will
occur to-morrow, when Lieutenant Gib
bon leaves to serve as one of Captain
Barker's officers on the Newark. This
young officer has displayed the greatest
energy in securing for the services of
the navy the various naval military or
ganizations of the States, and as an in
cident to that work he was obliged to
put forth his best efforts to secure the
formation of new organizations where
none existed, and additional battalions
in the States that already possessed a
naval militia. The great value of this
work is shown by the fact that many
of the vessels of the auxiliary navy and
most of the old monitors that have been
commissioned for coast defense pur
poses are manned almost altogether by
the naval militiamen.

SPAIN AND HER
TANGLED FINANCES.
Will Endeavor to Float a Big Loan
Before Sending Aid to the
Philippines.
LONDON, May 21.â The Madrid corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says: Lieu
tenant General Correa, Minister of War,
assured me that nothing definite has been
decided upon with respect to the expedi
tion to the Philippines. The Government
will be guided by circumstances. In offi
cial circles here it la believed that Em
peror William will not for the moment
answer Joseph Chamberlain's utterances
about an Anglo-American alliance, but
will wait for a better opportunity for do
ing so.
I am unable to state precisely the rea
sons why this purpose of the Kaiser
should be known here earlier than In any
other European capital, but it is so, and
Ministers are most positive about it.
Rumors regarding a new big loan have
been In circulation for some time. I
know from a good source that Senor
Puigcerver. Minister of Finance, will wait
until the Cortes is closed before taking
action In that direction. He will then ne
gotiate a loan in gold for twelve million
pounds ($60,000,000) sterling.

SANTA ROSA, May 20.â The Pythian
rose carnival, the greatest in the his
tory of this city of roses, is a thing of
the past. Though the events of the
day are over, the memory of the gor
geous spectacle presented as the floral
pageant swept down the principal
streets will forever linger as a pleas
ant recollection In the minds of those
fortunate enough to have witnessed it.
The wealth of floral beauty lavished
upon decorations, floats and carriages
would have bankrupted any but a city
whose capital in that line is unlimited.
While trainloads of roses and other
flowers were used, the gardens of the
city hardly show the effects of the
stripping to which they were subjected
the last few days.
Santa Rosa has been crowded all
day. It was a good-natured throng
and all seemed to realize the fact that
everybody was out for a good time.

points arrived in this city. Several
thousand people came on this train
alone, three engines being required to
haul the well-filled coaches. Three big
excursion trains came in during the
forenoon from San Francisco, and by
11 o'clock standing room was hardly to
be had on the streets. While awaiting
the parade many visited Camp Hah
man, the picturesque spot where the
Uniformed Rank, Knights of Pythias,
is encamped. Four bands marched
through the streets at the head of the
several military companies rendezvous
ing in this city for the day, and Park's
band gave an open-air concert on the
courthouse portico.
Promptly at 2 o'clock General Rob
ert Ross, commnnder-in-chief of the
parade, accompanied by his staff, and
preceded by a platoon of mounted po
lice, came into view headed down
I Fourth street. His appearance was the
' signal for a mighty shout, which was
I taken up along the line from the Athe
neum to the Donahue depot, a distance
of fifteen blocks. General Ross was
accompanied by the following aids: A.
I L. Fisher, Dr. R. P. Smith, Charles
; Lee, Don Elliott, J. F. Kinslow, L. L.
: Viers, F. P. Grace and J. B. Davis.
In the first division, under commajid
lof Major L. W. Juilliard, were the
I military companies of San Rafael, Pet
aluma and Santa Rosa, and Ellsworth ;
| Post, Grand Army of the Republic.
The second division, commanded by
i John M. McLaughlin, contained the
Uniform Rank, Knights of Pythias, the I
Rathbone Sisters and visiting lodges of
the Knights of Pythias from various
towns in the county, all wearing re
galias or uniforms forming some dia
| tinctive feature. A unique feature in
j this division was the parade of the
"D. K. K. S." in full costume. They
gave a mystic yell every few yards,
much to the delight and amazement of
the spectators.
The third division, Hood Burnett
! marshal, consisted of the Juvenile car- j
j nival parade. There were over 100 en
tries of the most unique creations con- i
ceivable. There were dogcarts, pony- i
| carts, tricycles, bicycles, goatcarts and !
| A. W. Fosters Shetland six-in-hand.
The fourth division, in command of
Charles O. Dunbar, constituted the
principal carnival features of the
parade.
By common consent the handsomest
private entry was Walter Morosco's j
! handsome drag and eight-in-hand, !
1 driven by Morosco himself and attended
,by two liveried footmen. Upon the
i drag were seated Misses Juanlta Con
ley, .Helen Overton, Nettie Peck, Lor
ena Hoag and Nettie Royal, Mrs. L. W
Burris and little Edith Wylie.
Among the unique features was an
old dump-cart, daintily decorated with
handsome flowers, the harness wrapped
throughout with satin ribons. Seated
on the floor of the cart were Misses
Hahman, Carrie Hood, Fannie Rey
nolds and Clara Hahman. Each wore
a great white dairymaid's bonnet, and
all were nearly covered by a mass of
roses, which they scattered among the J
spectators as they drove merrily along.
A dainty pony cart in which were
seated the children of J. Ed Hall at
tracted attention. The private car
riage of Mrs. C. L. Kopf and a phaeton
in which were seated Misses Nieta
Stoff and Elsie Morris, themselves two
of the fairest buds that ever bloomed
in this land of flowers, were loudly ap
plauded. Uncle Sam, in the person of
little Calvin Rohrer, mounted on a tiny
bicycle, called for hearty cheers.
Of course the principal feature of the
parade was the eagerly awaited car
nival fleet, which consisted of three
shipsâ the "Queen of the Carnival," an
I exact representation of the cruiser
Charleston, though on smaller lines,
and the two monitors, "Damon" and
"Pythias." Each was built according
to plans and made under the personal
supervision of Grant O. Richards, ed
itor of the Press Democrat, and one
sad feature of the day was the knowl
edge that the one who had worked so
hard to make this principal feature of
the parade a success was so seriously
ill at home that he could not witness
the happy fruition of his labors.
The warship "Queen of Carnival" was
over forty feet long and was propelled
by a steam engine concealed in the
j body of the vessel. The good ship was
gayly decked with garlands of roses.
Seated upon the upper deck, under a
canopy of royal purple, was sweet lit
tle Grace Dougherty, the daughter of
Judge S. K. Dougherty of this city,
surrounded by her court. Upon the
bridge stood gallant little Edward Gage
in full uniform, field glass in hand, his
eye ever and anon scanning the horizon
in quest of an enemy who mitrht be so
bold as to attempt to harm his beauti
ful sovereign. As the fleet passed down
the streets the crowds cheered to the
echo. A band seated upon the lower
deck of the Queen's craft discoursed
patriotic airs.
This evening the carnival ball was
held in honor of Queen Grace and her
dainty court. It was the concluding
event of the most gorgeous floral fete
ever held in Sonoma's capital.

WAR MEASURE
AMENDMENTS
Several to Be Decided by
the Senate.
AS TO ISSUES OF BONDS.
DANIEL OP VIBGINIA IS IN
OPPOSITION.
Many Important Substitutes for Par
agraphs in the Original Bill
Remain to Be Acted
Upon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 20.
At the conclusion of to-day's Bession
of the Senate, the reading of the war
measure had been completed. About
seven-eighths of the amendmentd pro
posed by the Senate committee have
been agreed to. Those remaining are,
quite naturally, the most important in
the bill, and will provoke a great deal
of discussion. The principal amend
ments yet to be passed upon are those
relating to the issue of bonds and cer
tificates of indebedness, the tobacco
tax, the tax of proprietary articles, the
issue of greenbacks, the coinage of the
silver seigniorage, the issue of silver
certincates, the inheritance tax and the
tax on corporations. The action upon
some of the amendments will be de
pendent upon that on others. Aldrich
(It.) of Rhode Island, to-day offered as
a substitute for the paragraphs relat
ing- to the coinage of the seigniorage,
the issue of silver certincates and the
issue of legal tender notes, the bond
provision prepared by the Republican
minority of the Committee on Finance.
If the bond provision should be accept
ed by the Senate, the amendments of
fered by the Democrats in lieu of It
will naturally be rejected.
Daniel (D.) of Virginia delivered a
speech strongly opposing an issue of
bonds and supporting the substitute
paragraphs opposed by the Democratic
majority of the Finance Committee.
Soon after the Senate convened to-day
Hale of Maine, chairman of the Commit
tee on Naval Affairs, favorably reported
from the committee House Joint resolu
tion providing for the organization and
enrollment of an auxiliary naval force
which shall form an Inner line of defense.
An amendment by the Senate committee
provides that the force shall not exceed
3000 men. The resolution was passed.
A bill was reported from the Commit
tee on Indian Affairs and passed authoriz
ing the- Secretary of the Treasury to re
fund $15,335 to the Chicago. Milwaukee
and St. Paul Railroad Company, the sum
having been deposited in the United States
Treasury many years ago as a guaran
tee and for which no value was received.
A joint resolution was passed calling
upon the Secretary of fl'ar for a report
OH the Sablne Pass improvement.
At the conclusion of the morning busi
ness, consideration of the war revenue
measure w;ts resumed. Daniel then com
menced his speech.
Every man in Congress, whatever his
political affiliations, Daniel said, stood
squarely behind the President and indi
vidually and collectively would give him
earnest and sincere support. He main
tained, however, that absolutely no neces
sity existed for plunging: the country into
a great bonded debt on account of exist
ing war. He was unwilling, he said, to
mortgage posterity, to burden future gen
erations with a debt, the example of
which would be a constant temptation to
extravagance.
Daniel maintained that the authors of
the House bill had protected the wealth
and taxed the property of the country.
He said that the stamp tax was the most
odious and pestiferous tax invented by
man. It was a tnx which must be paid
daily. The corporations, he thought,
ought to be willing to be taxed their
share of the burdens imposed by the war.
and many would receive great sums of
money from the Government itself for
contracts for war supplies. In conclusion,
he expressed the hope that the com
mittee amendment levying the tax on cor
porations would be agreed to, as, he was
assured many of the corporations them
selves would not object, and the people
would most heartily approve It.
The committee amendment striking out
the tonnage tax was agreed to.
The committee amendment relating to
the taxation of legacies and distributive
snares of personal property was read. A
committee amendment maintaining the
legacies excepted $10,000 instead of $5000
was agreed to.
Lodge could see no good reason for ex
ceptlng bequests from a wife to a hus
band, or husband to a wife. He therefore
moved that the provision making this
exemption be stricken from the bill.
Lodge said he was in favor of an inheri
tance tax. but any exemptions or excep
tions were if n fair. â¢
Elkins opposed the levying by the gen
eral Government of an inheritance tax.
Lodge's amendment was rejected.
Ponding the discussion of an amend
ment by Bacon, tho inheritance tax para
graph was passed over.
Upon the completion of the reading of
the bill, Aldrlcn offered the bond pro
vision and the provision authorizing cer
tificates of Indebtedness, as substitutes
for the sections of the bill reported by
the majority of the committee providing
for the colnnge of silver seigniorage, the
issue of silver certificates and the issue
of United States notes.
The bill was then laid aside. The Sen
ate, at 4:35 p. m.. went into executive ses
sion and shortly afterward adjourned
until to-morrow.
TO BE TAKEN OUT
OF DEPARTMENT HANDS.
Some Congressmen Believe Too Much
Time is Lost in Sending Aid
to Dewey.
BOSTON. May 20.â A Washington spe
cial to the Journal says: CongTess is pre
paring to take the matter of sending re
llef t<> D*wey out of the hands of the de
partments because of the inexcusable de
lay, some Congressmen believing the ad
ministration has no intention of sending
an army to the Philippines.
FOR REASONS^NOT TO
BE MADE PUBLIC.
Announcement That the Spanish Em
bassador to France Is Effecting
a Rapprochement.
LONDON, May 20.â The Madrid corres
pondent of the Times says: A newspaper
which is officially inspired makes the
oracular announcement that Senor Leon
y Castillo, the Spanish Embassador to
France, is engaged in effecting a rap
prochement with the French Government
for reasons which must not bÂ© made
public.
COAL FOR OUR SHIPS.
Large Quantities Being Sent From
Puget t.ound to Honolulu.
SEATTLE, Ma- 20.â The ship Henry
Villard will be towed to-morrow from
Seattle to Comox to load 3000 tons of
coal. She will then run to Honolulu
with other sailing vessels, and the coal
will be put ashore for the United States
Government to be used on war vessels
and transports.
E. E. Came said to-night that he sold
the bark Enoch Talbot with her cargo
of 2300 tons of Comox coal to the United
States Government. The purchase was
made by Commander Green of the Port
Orchard dry dock. It is said that the
present order of the Government is for
13,000 tons of British Columbia coal.
SMOKELESS POWDER
FOR THE WARSHIPS
Vessels Will Be Equipped With It
and a Government Factory
Soon Established.
NEW YORK, May 20,â The Herald's Washington corre
spondent telegraphs: Captain Charles O'Neil, chief of the Bu
reau of Ordnance, proposes in future to equip as many vessels
as possible with smokeless powder. I learned to-day that the
cruiser Newark", which will be formally placed in commission
to-morrow at the Norfolk navy-yard, has been fitted out with
smokeless powder, not only for the guns comprising her sec
ondary battery, but for the twelve 6-inch rapid firing guns
comprising her main battery.
Under contracts given by the Ordnance Bureau several
thousand pounds of smokeless powder of all caliber are being
manufactured daily so that a large supply will shortly be on
hand. Besides the Newark the only other ships in the service
supplied with the smokeless powder are the cruiser Marblehead
and auxiliary cruiser Prairie, tne latter attached to the squad
ron of Commodore Howell.
Captain O'Neil intends to place contracts for $250,000
worth of smokeless powder of all calibers in the near future in
order that it may be possible to supply as many ships as needed
with this kind of ammunition. "In addition to placing orders for
its manufacture Captain O'Neil is proposing the work of estab
lishing a smokeless powder" manufactory. Plans are being
perfected for the construction of such a plant, and Congress
having appropriated the money necessary for building it, it is
proposed to select a site as soon as possible and place contracts
for the erection of the building. Unfortunately the plant will
not be ready for operation undei 1 a year, but should the war
still be in progress at that time it will be possible to supply
ships with an unlimited supply of smokeless powder.

WHOLESALE THEFT
OF LEAD PIPE.
DUFFEY BROS., PLUMBERS, ARE
SYSTEMATICALLY ROBBED.
Suspicion Fastened on Two Em
ployes of the Firm, Who
Will Be Arrested
To-Day.
Through the efforts of Detectives Ryan
and ODea the quantity of lead pipe which
was systematically stolen from Duffey
Brothers, the plumbers, has been recov
ered. Yesterday afternoon the detec
tives, who have been working on the case
for several days, found about $1000 worth
of the stolen property In a junk store at
17 Misson street. It was removed to the
Central station and turned over to the
property clerk.
Duffey Brothers have the plumbing con
tract for the new ferry depot, and during
the past few months they have missed
large quantities of lead pipe. Suspicion
was fastened on an employe, but despite
the vigilance of the brothers the thefls
continued. How they managed to get
away with the property puzzles the po
lice It is believed, however, that after
working hours the thieves would drive
a dray up to the place where the pipe lay
and then cart it away. It was not until
about a week ago that Ryan and ODea
learned where the stolen property had
been disposed of.
They consulted Duffey Brothers, with the
result that it was decided to lay a trap
in the hope of catching the thieves. After
waiting for several days, and as the sus
pects railed to appear, the detectives con
cluded to move the stuff to the City Hall.
During the past several months it is
claimed that the men have stolen over
$500 worth of pipe belonging to Duffey
Brothers. The detectives know who they
are and expect to arrest them to-day.

REMENYI HONORED
BY HIS FRIENDS.
IMPKESSIVE CEREMONIES HELD
OVER HIS REMAINS.
Colonel Kowalsky Delivers a Touch
ing Eulogyâ The Body
Shipped to His
Family.
, Although far from home Edouard Rem
enyi, the great violinist who dropped
dead last Sunday while entrancing a vast
audience In the Orpheum Theater by his
matchless music, was not forgotten in
death by the friends he made in this city.
They came nobly to the front to honor
their distinguished visitor with eulogy
and tears of respect.
The ceremonies in B'nai B'rith Hall
yesterday were sad and impressive. Seat
ed around the bier of the departed genius
were those who had listened with rapture
to his wonderful bowing and who now
honored his remains with their presence.
The Hungarian Society sat on each side
of the coliin, while at the foot were pall
bearers chosen from the ranks it leading
musicians and professional men. On the
stage Stark's Hungarian orchestra dis
coursed pathetic strains, while the gal
lery and the main iloor were crowded
with hundreds of both sexes.
The ceremony opened with the magnifi
cent prelude to King Manfred by Rei
nicke. As the wailing of the violins filled
the room a stillness crept over the hall un
til the music ceased, when the enwrapped
listeners awakened as from a dream.
Colonel H. 1. Kowalsky then paid his
respects to his departed friend in a eulogy
that came from the heart. Ke told of his
family in the East, of his great gene
rosity. In concluding he said: "He played
his last engagement before an earthly
audience. He bowed, never again to re
spond to the plaudits of his admirers. But
his soul sped with all haste to that ever
lasting home, where angel musicians
awaited him â where sorrow is a stranger
and where sweetest melodies are ethereal.
God rest his soul."
The orchestra then played Gounod's "Avp
Maria," and at the close a last look was
taken and then the funeral cortege wend
ed its way to White & Porter's undertak
ing parlors, where the body was arranged
for shipment East. It left on the G o'clock
train in care of Sol Levy, and on its ar
rival in Xew York will be met by the
Hungarian Society.
The flowers were few and simple. Colo
nel Kowalsky sent a laurel wreath, and
his daughter's tribute was a sheaf of
wheat. An American and Hungarian flag
wreath was the token of the Hungarian
Society.
The violins and other personal effects of
the departed musician will be forwarded
shortly to the widow.
REPUBLICAN CLUBS LEAGUE.
Reception Committee Has a Warm
Time Over a Communication
to Senator Perkins.
A little disturbing element crept into
the proceedings at the meeting of the re
ception committee of the Republican
State Clubs which was held at the Union '
League clubrooms last night. It occurred
over the sending of "a communication to
Senator Perkins, requesting him, as an 1
officer of the Pacific Coast Steamship i
Company, to allow the committee the use
of their steamers for a hay excursion to
the visiting country delegates, number- '
ing 700, to the convention of Republican '
clubs on May 31 and June 1. The commu
nication was signed by E. M. Galvin,
chairman of the reception committee, who
presided over the deliberations of last
night. A faction led by Colonel Stone was
opposed to the sending of such a letter
to the Senator, which, by the way, had
already been sent, Stone claiming that it
savored too much of the "stand up and
deliver" proposition, that the committee
had exceeded its powers in sending the
communication and that the convention
could get along without a bay excursion.
The discussion waxed very bitter, and It
was agreed to eliminate the bay excur
sion from the programme. Xo disposition
was made in regard to the letter to Per
kins, and the committee will abide by his
reply in the matter. At this juncture
Jtsse Marks moved that all the subcom
mittees of the reception committee be dis
charged forthwith, and the motion was
carried. All that will now be done will be
to properly receive the delegates. It was
reported that Colonel Stone had wired
Senator Perkins not to recognize the com
munication requesting the use of a ves
sel from his company.
Discussed the Charter.
A debate was held on the value of
the new charter in the Turk street
Temple last night under the auspices
of the Ran Francisco Trade and Labor
Alliance, an organization made up al
most entirely of Socialists. The only
defender of the new charter who could
be found in the hall was Alfred Cridgt.
He expressed himself as being opposed
to the greater portion of it, but said
that there was a clause in it which ren
dered it easy of amendment by the
people, so for this reason he favored
it. Speeches opposing the charter were
made by Neal Bassett, Dr. Willey, P.
Ross Martin and many others.
Will of J. W. Cudworth.
The â¢will of James W. Cudworth. who
died May 12, leaving an estate valued at
$100,000, has been filed for probate. The
fair>ily residence on Union street, near
Buchanan, was left to his wife, Johanna,
and upon her death or remarriage is to
pass into the possession of her children.
The residue of the estate was left en
tirely to the latter.

GEiMERDE9(iMATCHING ON TO CAMP RICHMOND
(Advance of Volunteer Legions
From the Middle West.
Zealandia Chartered for
Manilaâ Duty for Na
val Reserves.
MAJOR OSCAR F. LONG. U. S. A.,
chief quartermaster of the de
partment, yesterday received a
-wire from Washington that the Zeal
andia of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany had been chartered by the Gov
ernment for transport service in the
Philippine expedition. There is talk
of chartering- other vessels, but no defi
nite announcement of further engage
ment in this respect could be made yes
terday. The fitting of the Zealandia
for the voyage will be of the same char
acter as that wh,ich has proved so ac
ceptable in the case of the Australia,
Patent berths will be installed and
other features of comfort introduced.
The Zealandia's regular run will be
taken by the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company. The Doric will be the first
vessel out.
Regarding the City of Peking's fit
ness for carrying troops without dis
comfort to the men it was remarked
by Major Long yesterday that the ship
had been prepared for the expedition
under the personal supervision of Cap
tain Gibson of the United States navy
and Mr. Schwerin, an ex-officer of the
navy. The ship had been inspected by
the Sanitary Commission and by Gen
erals Merriam and Otis. The Govern
ment has now decided to limit the
number of soldiers to go on the Pe
king to one regiment. The former plan
was to send a regiment and a battalion
on this ship. In consequence of this
change much of the space for berths
will be given to cargo, and the men
will not be crowded. It is said that
every vestige of Chinese occupancy has
been removed and the Chinese crew
discharged. Changes have been made
to insure perfect ventilation by ad
mitting an abundance of fresh air and
exhausting the impure atmosphere.
General Merriam. commanding the
Department of California, has been ad
vised that the extensive barracks at
Benicia, which can comfortably shelter
1000 men, are now vacant and can be
used if desired. General Merriam be
lieves that the incoming troops should ,
be encamped in San Francisco, where i
the supply department and subsistence
stores are established. It is thought ,
to be better to have all the troops for
the Manila expedition concentrated j
here under the immediate direction of j
the officers appointed to command the j
forces. It is estimated at department j
headquarters that the space on the j
Bay District ground is ample for 10,000 j
men. As troops go forward to Ma- j
nila places will be vacated which may j
be filled by regiments arriving late*-.
Concerning the mishap to the
Charleston. -Irving M. Scott remarked
yesterday that he had taken condenser
tubes from his own ship to enable the
Government to mak* the needed repairs
on the cruiser. The Charleston was
constructed fourteen years ago and no
doubt new condensers were needed, but
the fact remained that thÂ« Government
plant at Mare Island was not able to
supply condensing apparatus. In all
the rush of war preparations the man
agers of the Union Iron "Works have
not been solicited to rush the work of
any ship at their yard. On their own
motion the Scotts have advanced the
work on the torpedo-boat Farragut and j
will soon have the vessel ready for
service.
The change of climate and open air
life have given the troops on the tented
field of the Presidio an ar.n?tite that
the army ration hardly satisfies. There
is some complaint that the food Is not
sufficient in quantity for the demands
of these robust youngsters. The in
adequacy of the ration may be due in
b. measure to the inexperience of the
regimental commissary officers and
the company commissary regiments, but
whatever the cause may be. the fact
Ptill remains that troops encamped in
California should have all the food they
want. In the volunteer distribution of
fruits, and dainty good things, the men
from "Washington and Oregon may not
have been so bountifully provided for
as the men of the California organi
zations, whose friends and kin folk
flaily troop out to the camp with of
ferings of good things to eat. It would j
he in eood form and In line with broad j
principles of hospitality for our people {
here In San Francisco to pay especial ;
attention to the wants of the rai- |
ments from other States thrn Califor

DELAYED B^ A WRECK.
Arrival of Nebraska and Kan-
sas Battalions â Troops in
Fine Condition.
One battalion, the Third, from Nebras
ka, completing that regiment, and two
battalions of the Twentieth Kansas Val
hnteers, were all the troops that arrived
(n this city yesterday, though several
:rainloads reached Oakland last night
md the men 'will cross the ferry and pro
teed to camp early this morning.
At leapt 3000. men should have arrived
Curing the day, but a disastrous wreck
on the Central Pacific, near Boca, de
.ayed all the troop trains nearly half a
Say. As a result, the streets leading to
the old Bay District track will resound
Kith the tramp of boys in blue from
*arly this morning until late at night.
ffany more will follow to-morrow, so that
.he patriotic citizens of San â¢ Francisco
yill be kept busy welcoming the march
ng hosts.
All day long yesterday a big crowd
waited outside the ferry depot for the
men from beyond the Rockies. Within
â¢he big structure a bevy of ladies as pa
triotic as any wearer of the army blue
Uso waited, but not from idle curiosity
Their mission was to minister to the
loldiers, and most nobly they performed
fheir labors. These were the members
>f the Red Cross Society, reinforced by
L delegation from the King's Daughters
they had been notified that the troops
irould begin to arrive early in the morn
ing, and long before 8 o'clock they as
sembled in the baggage room, laden with
dibles and flowers. A wagon containing
leveral milk cans filled with â â  steaming
ioffee drove up and soon everything was
l readiness. The long tables were taate
ully decorated â ' with flowers, and huge
unch bowls The long tables were taste
jlly decorated with flowers, and huge
unch bowls filled with lemonade, but
leir quests failed to materialize. Finally
rord was received that thÂ» first dot&ch-j
ment would not be in until 3 o'clock, bif.
the ladies would not desert their posts.
They were fearful some band of hungry
soldiers might get through, so they wait
ed for hours, whiling away the time in
singing patriotic songs and feeding the
band and railroad employes.
Among the members of the Red Cross
Society in attendance were: Mesdames
I. Ivowenberg, W. H. Mills. C. R. Wlns
low. AY. B. Harrington, Snook. Gitvin.
Buckingham, Parnell. Judge Slack, Mc-
Kluny, Requa. Captain Lovy and Bur
nett; Misses McEwen, Jpnnle Blair, May
nard, McKlerny and Gertrude Burnett,
besides a number of King's Daughters.
At 3:20 p. m. the third battalion of
the Nebraska regiment arrived, and after
stacking- arms, wore taken in hand by the
ladies. They rewarded their hostesses
with three cheers and a tiger, and then
marched up Market street to Golden Gate
avenue and out to camp, headed by the
band of the Merchants' Association.
The battalion was in command of Major
H. B. Mulford of Omaha, the companies
composing it being as follows:
Company M, Broken Bone; captain, J.
G. Painter; iirst lieutenant, V. C. Talbot;
second lieutenant, C. T. Urr.
Company B, Fullerton; captain, W. H.
Oury: first lieutenant, J. T. Smith; second
lieutenant, J. A. Storch.
Company F, Madison; captain, C. A.
Vickers; lirst lieutenant, Fred Gegner;
second lieutenant, Jacob Henderson.
Company X, Columbus; Captain J. N.
Killian; first lieutenant Charles W. Jens;
second lieutenant, E. O. Weber.
Meantime, the Twentieth Kansas had
reached Oakland, but there was some mis
understanding regarding us going into
camp last night. But at 6:20 p. m. two
battalions landed at the ferry. This regi
ment is the victim of a Populist Gov
ernor, and, as a result, is the poorest
equipped of any that has yet arrived.
Few of the men are uniformed and will
have to be supplied from the army depot
here.
While Kansas has a finely organized
and equipped National Guard, the Gov
ernor insisted upon paying off some polti
cal obligations when the chance came for
him to appoint officers. This, naturally,
made the Guardsmen angry and many re
fused to enter the volunteer service with
out their regular officers. Consequently,
independent companies were formed and
hurried to the front before they could be
properly equipped. The men are weil
drilled, however, and as soon as they are
uniformed, will compare favorably with
any of the other regiments.
Colonel Frederick Funston, the com
mander, has an enviable record. He was
formerly Lieutenant Colonel and chief of
artillery on Gomez's staff. He was once
captured by the Spaniards, but escaped
and was afterward shot through the
lungs. He is now on detached service,
being on duty with General Miles' staff.
The regiment is in command of lieuten
ant Colonel Little. United States Consul
to <'airo, Egypt, during Harrison's admin
istration. His staff consists of Majors F.
H. Whitman and Wilder S. Metcalf. com
manding the First and Second battalions,
which arrived yesterday; Major John A.
Rafter, surgeon; Captains Charles S.
Huffman and Henry D. Smith, assistant
surgeons; Captain W. A. Deford, adju
tant; Captain J. G. Schliemann, chap
lain; First Lieutenant Lafe C. Smith,
quartermaster.
The companies of the First Battalion
are officered as follows:
Company X, Ottawa â Captain, Edmund
Bottwood; first lieutenant, J. F. Hull;
second lieutenant. Iris Parker.
Company G, Independenceâ Captain, D.
â S. Elliott; firet lieutenant, Howard A.
Scott; second lieutenant. Will A. McTag
gart.
Company E, Burlington â Captain, Chas.
M. Christy; first lieutenant, D. F. Craig;
second lieutenant, P. S. Ray.
Company M, Salinaâ Captain, W. H.
Bishop; first lieutenant. E. L. Glasgow;
second lieutenant, E. H. Agnews.
Second Battalion: Company H. Law
rence-Captain, A. G. Clark; first lieuten
ant. A. H. Krause; second lieutenant, A.
C. Alford.
Company D, Ptttsburgâ Captain, H. D.
Orwlg; first lieutenant, W. J. Watson;
second lieutenant. Thomas Rlchers.
Company I. Paola and lolaâ Captain, C.
S. Flanders; first lieutenant. Walter Hull;
second lieutenant. A. W. Flanders.
Company C, Leavenworthâ Captain. W.
S. Albright: first lieutenant. Harry S.
Seller; second lieutenant, John W. Haus-
Hc-rwater.
It was nearly 7:20 p. m. when the last of
these men had been fed, and with the
hand as an escort they proceeded out to
camp. They are well provided with tents,
but the Government will have to make
immediate provision for blankets for most
of them.
A SIGNIFICANT DETAIL.
Forty Men of the First Califor
nia Ordered Aboard the
Peking.
Late last night Quartermaster Dohr
mann of the First Regiment received an
order to detail forty men to go aboard
the City of Peking this morning to assist
in loading supplies aboard the ship. He
will also begin the hauling of the recently
issued supplies from the camp to the ves
sel. The. rifles and ammunition will be
taken first, and the other supplies will !
follow afterward. This would seem to
point to the fact that the troops may get
away sooner than the present circum
stances indicate.
The officers of the First do not seem to
think that the order of the Secretary of
War, ordering two regiments of regulars
to this coast, will have any effect in de
laying their departure, as they do not
anticipate that the Government Intends
the substitution of either of the regi
ments for the First.
The First regiment is now practically j
resting upon its arms. Colonel Smith's \
command is fully equipped in every way,
and prepared to sail for Manila, but j no
one seems to know just when the City of
Peking will leave this port. Some declare
she will sail to-morrow night, but from
the present outlook it is hardly possible
that she will sail before Tuesday.
Colonel Smith was absent from the
camp the greater part of- yesterday. He j
went to the city to confer with Generals i
Merriam and Otis, and also to make a
personal inspection of the City of Peking.
It is certain that no orders have yet
been received by the First or Fourteenth :
designating the exact day when the j
troops will leave this port. The officers ;
are hopeful of an early departure, as the
soldiers are chafing under the delay.
AH danger of an epidemic of measles
from the cases that have developed
among the Oregon troops seems" now to
have been safely passed, and owing to I
the rigid quarantine, no cases have so
far been reported among the other troops
in camp. Several suspects in the Oregon
Regiment were removed yesterday morn
ing to the â¢ Marino Hospital, and the
quarantine is still rigorously maintained. !
Outside of the measles, the general health
of the soldiers encamped at the Presidio is
excellent, and no serious cases were re
ported yesterday at either the brigade or ;
regimental, hospitals. â

Colonel Berry of the Seventh Regiment
yesterday issued an order appointing Ma
jor Frank C. Prescott. the senior major
of the regiment, as field officer's court.
The ladies of Alameda have prepared a
number of well-stocked baskets of lunch

soldiers of Colonel Berry's command.
In the Fourteenth Infantry the enlist
ment reached the large but unlucky num
ber of thirteen, which is the largest num
ber of men yet recruited in one day by
Lieutenant Hunt. Major Robe reports
his battalion as ready to move when so
ordered, but he has received no notifica
tion as to when he may expect to em
bark.
The Red Cross Society has issued to the
members of the various hospital corps
their badges of identification. The badge
is of platinum, with the insignia of the
Red Cross and the regimental designation
upon it.
Major McCarthy last evening ordered
the brigade hospital removed -from the
present location near the main road,
where visitors constantly intrude, and
perched on the hillside above the camp.

OAKLAND, May 20.â The West Oak
land railroad yards were alive with blue
coated soldiers to-night for the first time
since the great railroad strike of 1894. In
fact the stirring times of that year were
recalled by many as they saw train after
train roll into town loaded with soldiers.
The First Battalion of the First Minne
sota Regiment Volunteers arrived at 6:30
and were placed on a siding at Seventh
and Bay streets. A guard was put out
and military law established. The senti

ias Sheriff of Steams County. A few
months ago, while attempting' to arrest
a couple of vagrants, they fired on him,
but he returned the fire, killing one and
riddling the other with bullets. His com
pany is newly recruited and consist
largely of railroad men, and thirty-five of
them are six feet or over in height.
Company I) and Company A are the
two crack commands, having been com
plimented by General Mile* as equal to

The! people of the State raised and pre
sented the regiment with over $17,0X1 be
fore they left home to be used as needed.
The whole regiment traveled in Washer
sleepers ami carried a complete camp
outfit.
The members of Company G have a
bull pup as a mascot, which ranks above
the colonel. He fell off the train at Au
burn, but a quick pull on the bell cord
brought the train to a stop, while one
of the men dropped off to run back and
get him. He was found running after
the train unhurt, and will march with
the command in Manila.
Section 1. consisting of Companies G,

The Colorado and Wyoming troops left
Sacremento at midnight and will arrive
between 3 and 5 o'clock at the mole and
go over on the early boat.
PATROL DUIY IN SIGHT
The Naval Reserve May Get
a Chance to Serve the
Country.
The California Naval Reserves* eager
desire for active service may soon be
gratified. Last evening Adjutant General
Barrett received the following from Cap
tain Crownlnshield, chief of the Bureau
of Navigation. Washington; D. C:
"Please confer with Rear Admiral Mil
ler, flagship Monterey, San Francisco,
concerning the supply of trews for pa
trolling vessels. He has been notified."
General Barrett will call on the admiral
to-day and doubtless make a tender for
Immediate service of all the men that
the a-dmiral may need for patrol duty.
Rear Admiral Miller was seen at the
Occidental last evening In reference to
the above telegram, and although per
fectly willing to discuss other subjects he
courteously refused to give out any* in
formation'at present, as the strictness of
the navy regulations would not permit
It He stated that he had not received
word from the adjutant general on the
subject, and did not know at what hour
he would he visited by mat official to
day When asked whether the coast
would be guarded by a patrol
fleet, he answered that as soon as the
Fearless, now the Iroquois, Active and
Vigilant were ready they would be
manned and officered and be used for
that puroose. He was unable at present
to say whether the Naval Reserve would
be called upon to man these boats or
whether crews and officers would be de
tailed from the Mare Island Navy Yard
or from vessels about the bay. He sug
gested that Adjutant General Barrett or
the head of the local Naval- Reserve
might better be able to givo the infor
mation: as for himself, he could not dis
cuss the subject.
ARMY HEADQUARTERS.
,
General Otis at Work Organ
izing the Manila Ex
pedition.
There axe no'men in San Francisco who
are harder worked ;at , present ; than the
Officers at United States army headquar
ters. They are kept ; busy from early
morning until 10 o'clock | at night In car
rying out the Instructions received ; from
Washington in regard to the fitting , out
of the Manila expedition. ' â 
The first column of this expedition will
bo transported â on the steamer City ' of
Peking, but at what time is not definitely
known. The steamer was expected to sail
to-day or to-morrow, but, owing to un
avoidable delays and changes of plans,
her departure will probably not take !
place until next Tuesday or Wednesday, j
It was at first intended to crowd about i
2000 troops on board of this steamer, but
as a supply of commissary stores, naval I
repair outfits, etc., is deemed of the ut
most importance to Admiral Dewey's
fleet, the number of bunks has been limit
ed to 1000. The excess is now being torn
out, and the extra space thus afforded la
being filled with supplies.
It has not yet been decided what troops
will go on the Peking, nor is it yet cer
tain who will go in command of this ad
vance guard, although it is intimated that
Brigadier-General Anderson will be
placed In charge.
General Anderson, who has returned j
from Skaguay, is now in Portland, and |
can reach Ran Francisco In time to sail
on the Peking.
General Otl.s has thoroughly Investi
gated the condition of the volunteers who
have arrived here, and is very much
pleased with their physical state. He
found, however, that their equipment is
deficient in several important particulars,
which he has takpn steps to remedy as
promptly as possible. It is a settled fact
that no troops will be sent to the Philip
pines until they are properly equipped In
every respect.
WASHINGTON TROOPS.
Third Battalion Scheduled to
Arrive To-Morrow
Evening.
The Washington volunteers, whose
quarters are in the Fontana warehouse,
are very comfortably located, as the largo
building is well ventilated and supplied
with water, electric lights and other con
veniences. They would not change their
commodious and convenient barracks for
any other quarters in San Francisco, and
they consider themselves very lucky in
getting such good' accommodations. They
will begin to do their own cooking- to-day
on the army field ranges, which have
been suppled to them. Four hours a day
are devoted to drilling, the adjacent
streets and lots and the grounds at Fort
Mason being used for that purpose. The
health of the "Washington men is excel
lent, there being only one out of the 700
that Is in the hospital and he will return
to duty to-morrow.
It is not expected that any portion of
the Washington volunteers will form
part of the first installment of the Manila
expedition, as it will be impossible to
have the men properly equipped. Their
equipments are defective in several impor
tant particulars, and the deficiency must
1 c supplied before they can go to the
front. This is being done very slowly, as
the War Department is overcrowded with
The Third Battalion of the Washington
regiment will arrive here to-morrow
evening on the steamship Puebla, accom
panied by Colonel Jnhn H. Wholly, the
regimental hearkiuartr r? and thÂ« band.
This re-enforcement will complete the
regiment. Colonel Wholly was a lieuten
ant in the regular army, and was for sev
eral years in charge of the recruiting sta
tion 'at Seattle, and for the last three
years he has been military instructor in
the State University of Washington.
Lieutenant Colonel Fife, commanding
the Washington Volunteers, allowed his
men their liberty last night until 10
o'clock, and most of them spent the even
ing in town.
CAMP AT RICHMOND.
Kansas Troops Pitched Their
Sibley Tents by tlectric
Light.
The camp of volunteers at Richmond is
now dividing honors with the Presidio
encampment. Throngs of visitors assem
bled at the Bay District grounds yester
day and cast admiring glances at the
Kansas and Nebraska volunteers.
The Third Battalion of the Nebraska
regiment arrived in camp at 6:30 p. m.,
and at once pitched tents south of the
Nebraska regiment. They found on the
premises an ample supply of wood and
straw. Connection with the water main
had been made before the troops came in;
hence water was handy.
Two battalions of the Twentieth Regi
ment of Kansas Volunteers arrived in
camp at 9:30 o'clock last night. Their
camp was supplied in advance with wood,
water and straw. By electric light the
Kansas volunteers pitched their tents of
the Sibley pattern, and made themselves
comfortable for the night. Four of these
tents are sufficient to shelter a company.
The Kansas boys had supper last even
ing but no provision was made last night
for' breakfast this morning. This little
incident will not disturb the Kansans.
They come from a State where it is
necessary sometimes to "rustle."
It is a sure thing that they will find
something to eat this morning, if there
is anything in the Nebraska camp or the
houses of the neighborhood. It was a
rare thing in the Civil War for a Kansas
regiment to go hungry while passing
through a productive country.
Before the electric lights of the Rich
mond district were turned on last evening
many of the Nebraska boya ran the
guard for a jaunt downtown.
Yesterday a patriotic lady bought a
wagon-load of oranges, and amused her
self by tossing the fruit to the Nebraska
volunteers.
The camp at Richmond will be aug
mented to-day by battalions from Mia
nesota and Colorado. The streets of the
Richmond district are sewered, so that
the drainage is excellent.
FEEDING HUNGRY TROOPS
The Red Cross Society Brings
Cheer to the Weary
Soldiers.
Fourteen hundred weary, hungry bol
diers were fed at the ferry by the Red
Cross Society yesterday, and although
there was a shortag-e of sandwiches,
doughnuts and other edibles, the men who
are going to the front were happy that
they fared so well. This morning, not
long after the break of day, more col
umns of blue will be pouring into the city
from near and far, and in fear that the
fpod supply will again run short the so
ciety that is doing so much good appeals
to the people of this city to con
tribute to the soldiers' larder. Sand
wiches, doughnuts, cakes, in fact any
thing that is wholesome, will be accepted
with the thanks of the committee in
charge. Contributions can be it-t't at the
ferry at any time during the day, but if
it is there as early as 6 o'clock It will do
the most good and will bring the most
cheer. To-morrow again the soldiers will
come in hundreds and they, too, must be
fed. Again contributions are wanted and
all that can be spared. Many' prominent
merchants have donated supplies, and
doubtless to-night will not see one hun
gry soldier beneath the tents at the Pre
sidio grounds.
The life of a soldier is not an easy one,
and it is frequently made the harder by
the lack of luxuries when the boys lie
stricken by disease. All this the society
knows, and eggs by the case and wine
likewise are at the camp grounds, and the
man'- sick are carefully and skillfully at
tended to.
entertainments to augment the coffers
of the society are not decreasing in the
least. A vaudeville entertainment, the
receipts to go â  > tho society's fund, will
be given by the Verein Oesterreich at the
Chutes on Saturday, May _o>. A good pro
gramme is promised and 'a iarge gather
ing is exported.
Among the most enthusiastic workers of
Alamcda County is Miss t,thel I,angfort
of Golden Gate. Under ncr direction an
entertainment will he given in Klinkner
Hall on June 1. It is but a short distance
from this city to the scene of the enter
tainment and many people from this city
are expected by the fair manager and her
assistants.

A CHANCE TO VOLUNTEER
Patriotic Ladies Needed fop
Service To- Day in Receiv
ing Troops.
The Red Cross Society is doing noble
work in providing for the soldiers upon
t;\<-ir arrival, but there is a limit to the
physical endurance of the ladies, and they
are obliged to call for volunteers for duty
at the ferry to-morrow. Yesterday tha
ladles were on duty for twelve hours,
and to-day they will begin at 7 o'clock
and it may be 10 p. m. before they get
through. Therefore, it will be utterly
impossible for them to resume their labors
to-morrow morning. Ladies who will vol-.
unteer for to-murrow will confer a great
favor by notifying the officer of the so
ciety to-day either at headquarters In
the Claus Spreekels building, or at tha
ferry depot.
The society also calls for provisions of
all kinds to bo delivered by 8 a. m. to
day and to-morrow at the ferry depot.
Pies, cakes, sandwiches, boiled eggs, cold
mÂ«-;its and the like for the soldiers are
!,â¢ eded .- 1 n > 1 in large quantities.
Cut flowers for the boys in blue are also
wanted, ami the people across the bay
who come over to the city to-day and
while tin- troops are arriving are urged
to bring flowers and leave them in the
baKÃ.ige room. A rose or pansy is prized
almost as highly as food by the men.
Many of the soldiers are unfortunate in
losing their hats and arrive at the ferry
bareheaded. The Red Cross Society
would be grateful for contributions of
hats to supply these unfortunates until
they can draw upon the Government
stores.
Sword Presentation.
Charles J. Hogan, first lieutenant of
Company M, First Regiment United

sword by the members of engine 13, of
which company he was formerly a

made by District Engineer McKittrick,
and Lieutenant Hogan, although some
what taken aback, responded in a very
neat speech.

& FITTING FAREWELL TO THE BOYS.
IN this city now are thousands who have taken up
arms at the call of their country. Other thousands
are coming. The heart goes to these boys in blue.
The people feel for them more than respect. The sol
diers share the love a patriot nation holds for the flag
above it. They are the visible tokens of the right of
the flag to wave in honor. They have made oath that
to sustain the stars and stripes they will, if need be,
lay down their lives and give themselves to nameless
graves on a distant and alien shore.
Let it not be forgotten that most of these boys are
already far from their homes. Many of them come
fiom quiet farms in Kansas and Nebraska, from the
mines and ranges of Colorado, and the journey to
this city has seemed long to them, has carried them
far from all they love, has set them down among
strangers; friends to the last man and woman, to
the last wee school child, willing friends, but still
strangers.
It would be an excellent plan to attest in some pub
lic manner the regard which thrills San Francisco
when the troops go marching by, or when a glimpse
is had of the tented fields in which they live. This
could not be better done than appointing a day when
there shall be a grand review at which civilians shall
meet the soldiers, speak to them face to face, carry
flowers, and listen to a farewell speech and a god
speed to them from the lips of a civilian orator, 6ome
man who is crowned with the dignity of years, whose
soul is responsive to the impulses of patriotism, who
perhaps has known the baptism of fire.
When the ships start for the dreary voyage to
Manila they should not pass unattended toward the
Golden Gate. Every yacht in the harbor, every tug,
every launch, should be alongside, a voluntary guard
of honor. From each mast fluttering the stars and
stripes, rigging gay with the national colors, decks
crowded with Americans shouting their farewells to
the soldiers, waving their handkerchiefs, cheering â
it would be a convoy which would be remembered
under a tropic sun and lend strength to the young
arm in the hour of peril to come. The tribute would
drive away the deadly yearning for home, and it
would give San Francisco a chance to voice the
emotion of patriotism.
Probably these soldiers, save the Californians. will
not return. It is more likely that they will reach
Washington by Eastern waters for the glad day of
mustering out. Let them be cared for while here as
best we may. Let their last recollection of San Fran
cisco recall to them always a vision of flowers and
friendly faces and clasping hands, the sound of music
and of kindly words.
They come from every direction. But we are one
people. They are all our boys.
Oh, calm and immutable cheek of the "special com
missioner" of Fakedom! Now that driveling dotard
cables as follows: "The Prince of Wales has sent me
word," etc. All the while the Prince probably does
not know of his existence, and probably would not
under any provocation send anything in his direction
but a lackey with orders to kick the fellow out and
then fumigate the royal premises.
One thing having a tendency to prejudice teachers
against the proposed charter is that it injures their in
terests at every point where it touches them. It les
sens the sum set apart for their salaries and it cuts
of! pay during the vacations to which teachers are
now entitled.
Before accepting the news of Spanish successes in
West Indian waters it is well to recall that the news
is sent over wires under the control of Spain. And
Spanish diplomacy is only another name for lying.
To term the Philippine contingent a "relief expedi
tion" for Admiral Dewey is hardly a proper use of the
term. Dewey does not need relief half so badly as do
some of the people he has met.
Admiral Cervera seems to be a man of nerve. Ad
dressing his men recently he said: "You are Span
iards, and that is sufficient in war." And the admiral
had heard from Manila, too.
Of course the news that the Oregon is safe is cheer
ing, but out this way there has all along been an idea
that the Oregon was constructed with a view to tak
ing care of herself.
There are reasons for hoping that Spain may not
rush more troops to the Philippines. Dewey has no
facilities for taking care of prisoners.
Americans are not ready to believe that Sampson
has shot all his ammunition away without hurting
somebody*
WAF^ FINANCIERING.
THE breaking of the blockade by the Spanish fleet
is a revelation of the very serious nature of the
military task in which we are engaged. There
has never been a war that did not exceed first esti
mates in time and cost, and this promises to be no
exception. When the people of the temperate zone
have made war in the torrid zone they have always
iound it to cost them dearly, as England and Holland
and France can testify. We are about to add our ex
perience to theirs, and probably at higher cost.
All of this outlook is an admonition to wisdom in
our financial scheme in the beginning, so that it will
serve without change to the end and be the promoter
of economy Instead of extravagance.. The fiatists in
the Senate are willing to take advantage of the coun
try's necessities for the purpose of exploiting their
theories. The war revenue bill prepared in and
passed by the House is on the right lines. It imposes
war taxes which have served the purpose of every
civilized nation in martial emergencies, and provides
a popular war loan at a low rate of interest to raise
$500,000,000. Senator Jones of Arkansas and others
of the fiat side have antagonized this bill in the Sen
ate. They propose to strike out the bond provision
and, as one of them puts it, "strike out of the bill
taxes on consumption and put them on property."
This is to be one of the campaign cries, alternating
with that against bondholders. Consumption is the use
of property. Any tax on any kind of property is a tax
on the use of that property. Stamp taxes on mort
gages, checks, notas, drafts and bills of exchange are
taxes on the use of property. Senator Jones objects
to an increased tax on beer, but is silent about a tax
on wine. They are both imposed upon property, but
Jones has an idea that the large German vote of the
country will resent a higher tax on beer, and will vote
the Democratic ticket if it is imposed by the Repub
licans. This is about as high as any of the fiat reason
ing on the war revenue bill, and is a low and grovel
ing estimate of the intelligence and patriotism of our
people of German blood. The people were but re
cently represented by the fiat party in Congress as
hot for war. There is no sorcery by which the cost
of the war can be evaded. It is contemptible in any
man in Congress to vote for war and then attempt to
make political capital with the people by misrepresen
tation of the financial measures necessary to carry
it on.
It is evident that the war is to exceed in cost all
estimates heretofore made. By and by there will ap
pear a proposition to recoup the country by holding
captured territory, either for ransom or to collect its
public revenues until our treasury is made whole, but
that is in the distance and does no present good.
The emergencies of to-day must be faced and those of
to-morrow estimated. The fiatists propose to do this
by adding $150,000,000 to the greenback issue. They
demand this without making any preparation for the
redemption of such issue. Added to the greenbacks
now outstanding this will make that form of our pub
lic debt $496,000,000, with no provision for canceling
or funding or paying it. If this fiat plan be adopted
other issues of the same kind will follow, and there is
no power on earth that can prevent the fall of these
greenbacks below par. What then will be done to sus
tain their par?
When this discount happened during the Civil War
the only feasible plan in sight was adopted by provid-
ing for funding the greenbacks in interest-bearing
bonds, as the treasury had no money in which to re
deem them. This expedient probably kept the green
backs from going to a discount of 90 per cent, but it
did not prevent them falling 66 2-3 per cent. At the
latter rate of discount they were converted into inter
est-bearing-bonds to prevent a further fall, but no
more ruinous and burdensome financiering was ever
undertaken. Yet if the fiatists have their way we will
go all over that hard road again. It is highly prob
able that an issue of $500,000,000 in greenbacks will
fall to 50 per cent. The Government will be able to
pay with them only $250,000,000 of the cost of the
war. Then they will have to be funded to prevent
further discount. An issue of $500,000,000 of bonds in
a popular loan at 3 per cent to run twenty years
would be taken at a premium of at least 4 per cent.
It would produce $520,000,000 in gold. The interest
for twenty years less the premium would be $280,000,
000, and the whole burden would amount at maturity
to $780,000,000. An equal issue of greenbacks, finally
funded, would pay only $250,000,000 of the cost of
the war, and, adding discount to interest, would at
twenty years' maturity produce a burden amounting
to $1,050,000,000, or just $270,000,000 more than if the
money were secured by a bond issue in the first in
stance. That the discount on greenbacks will appear
is certain. That it will be limited to 50 per cent is
not certain; but to whatever percentage it appear,
so much will be added to the final burden as compared
with the plan proposed in the House bill.
"PURELY ADMINISTRATIVE."
IN the course of an address at the Mission on Thurs
day evening Mayor Phelan scouted the idea that
there is any occasion to fear the Czar-Mayor
created by the proposed new charter. "The powers
of the Mayor," he is reported as having said, "form
the main poinf of the attack of the opposition to the
charter. He can be neither a Czar nor an autocrat,
no matter how willing he might be. His duties will
be purely administrative, but instead of being a figure
head he will have power to stop corruption and cor
rect abuses."
Nothing could be more specious or misleading than
this. Mayor Phelan knows very well that the duties
of the Mayor under the proposed charter will not be
"purely administrative." He knows also that the
official will have power not only to "stop corruption"
and "correct abuses," but to promote corruption and
create abuses. Probably all the Mayors elected by
the people of this city have had power to promote
corruption and create abuses; but all of them have
been restrained to some extent by the law.
The Mayor of the. new charter is invested with no
restraints whatever. He is given absolute control
of 80 per cent of the patronage of the municipality;
he is authorized to appoint and remove at pleasure
and is even empowered to suspend elected officials;
through the Civil Service Commission, which he ap
points, he may control the patronage of the elective
heads of departments; through the Board of Public
Works, the Fire and Police commissions, the mem
bers of which he appoints and removes at pleasure,
he may direct the political destiny of the municipality;
through the Election Commission, which he also ap
points and removes at pleasure, he may canvass the
votes of the people and declare the result of ballot
box contests.
These are not all his functions, but they are some
of those which are not "purely administrative." While
the proposed charter sets up a rule of action for every
official elected under it. no rule is prescribed for the
Mayor. That potentate is simply elected and turned
loose with unprecedented political powers, unchecked
by legal restraints of any kind or character. It is
ttue.that Mayor Phelan will not exercise the powers
of this Czar until he has been twice re-elected. We
THE SAN FRANCISCO. CALL., SATURDAY, MAY 21, 1898.
can, therefore, conceive of no reason for his support
ot the proposed charter except that he desires to
fasten upon us a government which will enable the
politicians, by combining for the election of a
Mayor, to loot the city.
RESENTING A WANTON ASSAULT.
THURSDAY the Evening Bulletin made a
strange and vicious assault upon the integrity
of the work turned out by the Union Iron
Works. The assault was strange because the natural
impulse of a local paper would be to sustain the repu
tation of an industry at once a credit and a profit to
San Francisco; vicious because entirely without
grounds, wanton, ridiculous.
Yesterday the Bulletin apologized in a weak and
inadequate way. The apology was as devoid of the
semblance of sincerity as one of the confessions of
Rev. Mr. Brown. It had been forced from the even
ing paper by the employes of the Union Iron Works,
men of brain and muscle who take pride in the high
character of the ships they build, and who have
never constructed for the Government a single ves
sel which has not been above the grade of excellence
named in the specified requirements, a strength and
an ornament to the navy.
To people who follow the fortunes of the navy the
superior quality of the ships built here is familiar.
The list can speak for itself. It includes the Charles
ton, San Francisco. Monterey, Olympia, Oregon,
Wheeling and Marietta. The Charleston was the
first. It has cruised in all waters, has done every ser
vice required of it, and, though launched in 1887. it
is fit to represent the dignity of the navy, to respond
to the call of a Dewey, or to fight. The San Fran
cisco was long the pride of the navy. It is as good as
ever. It was selected to be the flagship of the Euro
pean squadron, and it never visited a foreign port
without exciting open admiration, particularly from
naval men. The Monterey is in our harbor. It is
ton for ton as formidable a fighting machine as ever
rode the waves. Who does not know the glorious
record of the Olympia, flying our colors under com
mand of Dewey through the greatest naval fight
between armored ships? Who has not watched the
progress of the Oregon, that giant, as powerful a
battle-ship as floats, and the Marietta, called to im
portant duty in the time of need?
No wonder the men who made these ships felt in
dignant at the slur cast upon their handiwork. No
wonder they forced the Bulletin to retract, even if it
did so half-heartedly.
THE WEST INDIAN CAMPAIGN.
ADMIRAL DEVVEY'S swift and glorious vic
tory at Manila, while rousing and stimulating
the people, has had two effects upon the popu
lar mind which are not altogether beneficial. In the
first place it has given the public too much contempt
for Spanish prowess and an exaggerated idea of our
cwn superiority. In the second place it has caused a
popular impatience with the comparatively slow pro
ceedings in the West Indies. By reason of this con
tempt for the Spaniard and this impatience with our
cwn authorities there has risen among a certain class
of newspapers a tone of fault-finding criticism against
the administration and the board of strategy.
That the Spaniards are inferior to the men who
compose our armies and man our fleets is true. They
are not, however, a contemptible foe, neither are they
either so weak or so cowardly that we can afford
to prosecute the war against them with inconsiderate
rashness. Over confidence has led many a gallant
army to its ruin, and our own history is not without
striking illustrations of the folly of such a course
even when fighting against undisciplined and almost
unarmed Indians.
The strategy of the campaign in the West Indies
La essentially the same as that employed by Dewey at
Manila. Its object is the destruction of the Spanish
fleet. Differences in the conditions, however, compel
the adoption of different tactics in the West Indian
waters from those which were so successful in the
Philippines. Dewey managed to find the Spanish
fleet in the Orient at a place where it could not escape
him. He had only to go forward and strike. Samp
son has yet to find the Spaniards against whom his
force is directed, but when he has maneuvered them
within striking distance we can count on the ac
complishment by his force of a victory not less bril
liant and not less effective in its results than that with
which Dewey opened the war and destroyed Spanish
power in the Pacific.
Certain of the yellow journals, and in particular the
extreme examples of that kind of journalismâ the
New York World and Journal â have been waiting
impatiently for an opportunity to attack the President
so as to make party capital for the Democrats and the
Populists this fall. It has seemed to them that some
thing can be done in that way by denouncing the de
lay in the invasion of Cuba, and accordingly they are
declaring it an evidence of unfitness for command
either through cowardice or lethargy on the part of
the President and his war council. With that motive
they have begun to clamor for an immediate advance
on Havana. Having no responsibility they assume in
their comments on the course of the campaign all the
ardor and genius of Napoleons. They would take
Havana in three days and blow the Spanish fleet off
the seas without waiting to come up with it.
The unwary among the people may be fooled by
such criticism, but the intelligent comprehend very
clearly the difficulties in the way of Commander
Sampson. They have confidence that in due season
he will drive the Spanish from the West Indies and
that in doing so he will not by any folly of rashness
lose the life of a single sailor more than is necessary
to win the victory over a fleet equal to his own in
strength and manned by crews who are capable of
fighting with a fury born of hate and desperation.
Hope has arisen in the savage breast of an Oakland
murderer that he will escape punishment because
some official has mislaid a paper, the contents of
which is known and of which a. copy exists. An es
cape on such grounds would be an insult to justice
and a fairly good pretext for the substitution of lynch
law for the present statute, Lynch law at least has the
merit of not permitting idle technicalities to hamper it.
Better have still more delay than that the transport
6hips should sail without having been properly
equipped. The soldier boys are our friends and the
public would not patiently receive information that
they were to go to Manila in quarters worse than that
given to Chinese.
Let not the boys from Nebraska and Kansas, where
r.o flea abides, be worried by the attentions of the
California variety. It is annoying at times, but it
diverts the mind, stimulates the circulation and makes
possible the luxury of scratching.
It was at Santiago de Cuba that the men of the
Virginius were murdered years ago. In all human
probability enough Spanish blood will be shed there
soon to remind that nation that vengeance, while not
always swift, is tolerably sure. .
PROPOSED TAX ON NEWSPAPERS.
The Call's Reply to a Request Which Was Not Dictated by
Patriotism.
The following self-explanatory dispatch was received by The Call last
night:
CHICAGO, May 20.â T0 Newspaper Publishers: The war tax bill now
pending in the Senate contains a provision putting a tax of one cent on every
package forwarded by express, including- bundles of newspapers. If prompt
action is taken by newspaper publishers telegraphing Senators it will be prac
ticable to secure an exemption of newspaper packages, or at least of all pack
ages containing less than 100 copies. It is suggested that publishers take the
matter up promptly and energetically. CHA RLES W. KNAPP,
President American Newspaper Publishing Association.
Compliments to Mr. Knapp, and what sort of an American paper does he
suppose The Call to be? While there was a prospect of war die papers did
much to promote it. Noh for them to endeavor to sneak out of paying a
share of the expense would be cowardly and unpatriotic. They are engaged in
printing the news of the war and in selling the accounts to the public. They
are even assuming the right to direct the Government. Yet here is more than
an intimation that the publishers of newspapers are so dctestibly selfish, so
lacking in the elements of good citizenship and honor that they would evade a
responsibility when the evasion would savor of treason.
When the country is sending its men to battle, when every nerve is
strained to provide the means of equipment, when the plain duty of every man
is to do his part willingly, and the natural impulse is to do it eagerly, the suppo
sition that publishers of daily papers are a class apart, a set of thrifty vampires
drawing substance from a country they are too mean to defend and too low to
live in, comes with a shock. If Mr. Knapp thinks he is dealing with a lot
of knaves, to undeceive him is a pleasure. He is dealing with men, and men
who are proud of being Americans. Any citizen who is capable now of acting
as Knapp is counseling could do the country no better service than to leave
it. He is a traitor. He might feel at home in Spain.
The Call is willing to pay any tax the Government may impose. It will
pay a cent a bundle or 10 cents. It will leave to legislation the settling of the
limit and make no protest. It will be glad to know that it can contribute.
Any paper t'rtat objects to sharing the common burden is unworthy the sup
port of citizens, untrre to the flag, and the sooner it shall cease publication the
better for the patriotism of the land.
THE WAR AND THE CANAL
Among the many lessons this war Is teaching the American people is that of
the strategic necessity of a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
either at Panama or by the Nicaragua route.
Dealing with a sÂ»cth-rate power like Spain, we have been able to get along
without the battle-ship Oregon during her long passage around Cape Horn; but
it is easily conceivable that we might have needed herâ needed her very much,
indeed.
Suppose the fruits of Dewey's great victory in Manila Bay were threatened,
with a canal across the isthmus through which a few strong ships could be sent
it would be possible to make all safe in a short time compared with the delay
incidental to the voyage around the entire continent. And when our fleets are
dependent on coaling stations and practically all the world has proclaimed neu
trality, this means a great deal.
That there must, at no distant day, be a chip canal between the Gulf of
Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, and that the United States must absolutely con
trol this canal, has been clearly shown to the satisfaction of the American
people.â Boston Post.
AN IMPRESSIVE OBJECT LESSON.
The war teaches an impressive object lesson of the necessity to us of the
Nicaragua canal. If the canal had been dvg 1 the Oregon would now be in Ad
miral Sampson's fleet and the Navy Department would not be distracted over
the question whether to send the fleet to meet her or let her take her chances.
The plight of a great nation with no direct water communication between one
half of its sea coast and the other half is liable to become serious in time of
war. â New York Commercial Advertiser.
A DEMONSTRATED NECESSITY.
The war with Spain has demonstrated the necessity for a canal across Cen
tral America. Had the Nicaragua canal been completed, when the Oregon, lying
at San Francisco, was ordered to join Admiral Sampson's fleet in the West Indies
she would have carried out the order in at most one-sixth of the time. As It is,
the Oregon, though she left San Francisco nearly two months ago and has
steamed over 10.000 miles, is still almost as far from her destination as she
would be were she still at San Francisco with the Nicaragua canal open. In
addition to this the nation has been in a constant worry for weeks
for fear that during her lonely cruise she might be attacked by a superior force
of the enemy.
Without a Nicaragua canal the T'nited State* is in need of two navies to
give her proper protection. It is to be hoped tha-t one of the results of our war
with Spain will be an Isthmian canal.â Sacramento Bee.
GIVE AMERICANS A CHANCE.
Will those well-meaning but terribly misguided people who have been oppos
ing the construction of the Nicaragua canal please be kind enough to hold their
yawp and give genuine Americans a chance? With that canal completed it is
but a matter of days between New York and San Francisco, instead of weeks, as
it is now. The Nicaragua canal is a measure that ought to have been pushed
to completion years ago, and would have been had it not been for sham econ
omists and pseudo Americans. â Citrograph.
VALUE MADE OBVIOUS.
The present war makes obvious the necessity for a canal across the Isthmus
of Panama, and will undoubtedly result in its being built. With such a canal
the Oregon would long ago have joined Sampson's fleet, and in case the coast
was threatened by an enemy a strong fleet from the Atlantic could soon reach
our Western shores. This necessity has been fully understood by naval men,
but its importance has not been grasped by the multitude, partly, no doubt, by
reason *of the fart that they have not considered war as a probability. They
understand the strategic importance now, however, and it is safe to predict that
the canal will be built very soon. It should be Duilt: but let us be careful that
we avoid the errors of the past. The Government should not pay for the work
and give the canal to private parties.â Oroville Mercury.
EMPHASIZED BY WAR.
The necessity for the speedy building of the Nicaragua canal Is being
strongly emphasized by war events. For instance, the long voyage of the
Oregon to Atlantic waters, "which should have been accomplished in a fraction
of the time through the canal and the battleship have been with her sister ships
of the North Atlantic squadron. The United States should lose no time in the
construction of the canal, and then should control it for all time.â Chino Valley
Champion.
WILL HASTEN THE CANAL
There Is little doubt that the war with Spain will hasten the building of the
Nicaragua canal. The necessity of that waterway has been so clearly demon
strated of late that opposition to this great undertaking appears to have
melted away. It would not be at all surprising if Congress, before the present
session closes, were to take the necessary steps for having the canal built and
controlled by the United States.â San Diego Union.
The outcome of the present war with Spain will undoubtedly be the sppody
construction of the Nicaragua canal, which will be of great benoflt to the United
States, not only in time of war. but in time of peace also. If this const should
be in danger at any time from fleets on the Asiatic Coast, where Japan.
Russia, England, France and Germany have large forces, we could gain no help
except by ponding vessels around Cape Horn, with more liability nf rapture,
and no chance of coaling under recent regulations of neutrality.â Yreka Journal.
A STRANGE SPECTACLE.
The war With Spain will serve to teach this nation several valuable lessons.
Among them the necessity of a water way connecting the waters of the Carib
bean Sea with the Pacific. The spectacle of the Oregon rushing to the assist
ance of the Atlantic squadron by way of the uttermost parts of the earth, on
forced draft and followed by the anxious thoughts of every American patriot
to find When safely around the Horn, and nearfng Cuban waters, that she Is
needed now on the other side, Is one to move the wily Spaniard to Machiavellan
mirth.â Reno (Nev.) Evening Gazette.

WOODEN SHIPS
AND
IRON MEN.
s
: . â  â  was engaged In
conversation with a party of military men
at the Occidental last night, the topic
under discussion, of course, being the
presept difficulty, between our nation and
Spain. One of : the party â¢ made reference
to the large number of armored war ves
sels which the American Government pos
sesses at : the present time and the fight-
Ing qualities of our naval i heroes. At
this the British: ex-offlcer: became remin
iscent.and said: "I remember the time,,
and it was many years ago, when th<>
United States were not so well equipped
In ,thQ' matter of armored -ships as they
are now. At the timo of which I : speak
the majority of your war vessels were of
the ancient wooden; type. The . British
Government had : already procured ." quite
a number of < iron â  battle-ships, but : your
Government i was a'; little slow â¢in follow
ing: ?. the 5 good example. At that period,
which, by the way, was a time of peace,
there were gathered .at ' a foreign port
three or four, of our iron vessels and sev
eral of your wooden ones. One night
minstrel : chow was ; given on ? one of the
American \ ships, and I - along with somt,
brother : officers were ' Invited to the per
formance, i an " lnvitation, gladly â  ac
cepted. There was considerable talent
among the participants and. needless to
state, the affair was a huge success from
first to last.
"The hit of the evening was made by
an endman, who propounded the ques
tion, 'What's the difference between ths
American navy and the British navy?'
The interlocutor, of course, did not know
and asked, 'what was the difference, etc?'
The comedian replied: "One has wooden
ships and iron men and the other has
iron ships and wooden men." While I
and my associates did not entirely agrea
with all the fine points involved in thÂ»
conundrum, we peacefully joined in ths
hearty laugh which greeted this sally,
and it is pleasant to note that In thÂ«
present day, though you have changed thÂ»
material entering into the construction of
your vessels, the material of your men
has not changed one particle, for they are
still 'iron' men and always will be."

A rreat barrier of secrecy has been
drawn around the Pacific Mail dock for
the past few days. The curious sight-
Beer and the eajr<r newsgatherer have
been alike excluded, and It requires
boundless ingenuity to elude the eagle
eyes of the watchers who guard the gate.
There are dock officials and policeman
and soldiers, and no kind of pass yet in
vented will satisfy their requirements.
When once you get on board the ships
you see how marvelously little has been
done toward making the soldiers com
fortable during the long and trying voy
age to Manila. Take the City of Peking.
She is a fine, big, roomy steamer, one of
the most comfortable passenger vessels
of her class afloat. That is, for saloon
people; the steerage doean't count for
much in the eves of money-making
steamship companies. Yet no corpora
tion, however grasping, would expect pas
sengers to accept the accommodation pro
vided for the troops. Even cuttle or
horses would not be shipped under such
conditions. The mortality would be too
awful. Fortunately, soldiers can go on
deck, and it is there that they will have,
to live during the greater part of the
voyage.
The steerage of the City of Peking, nÂ£>w
to become the troop deck, is belew The
saloon deck, and but feebly lighted, by
email ports. These are so near the water
that it will be impossible to keep them
open while the ship, is at sea, and what
little ventilation is provided will have to
come through the hatchways and wind
sails. Above is the saloon, cheerful and
airy, where the officers will have no rea
son to complain of their quarters.
Even the steerage deck, however, could
have been made fairly habitable, had not
some amateur in office, who seems never
to have seen a troop-ship before, con
ceived the Idea that standing bunks were
necessary for the soldiers' existence at
Eea, On board European troop-ships such
a thing is never heard of; experience baa
taught the nations which have long been
in the habit of conveying troops by sea
that hammocks are infinitely mure con
venient and healthier.
The result of this mistake is that a
large force of carpenters have been at
work during the week filling up the troop
deck with a cumbrous mass of wooden
framework. Amidships and on each side
the bunks are erected, leaving only two
narrow passages for the circulation of
light. Ordinarily the steerage deck Is
used for the conveyance of cargro, so it is
very low, yet the carpenters, with an in
genuity worthy of a better cause, have
managed to squeeze three tiers > i bunks
Into this narrow space. Each tier in the
centra] row contains six berths, so that
eighteen full grown men will be com
pelled to Bleep on a space about the size
of a large billiard table. Unless a man is
lucky enough to get an outside bunk he
will have to climb over two or three of his
comrades to reach his sleeping place.
As an ingenious method of getting the
greatest number of men into the least
possible space this system may recom
mend itseif. but it has no other attrac
tions. The condition of these troop decks
when the vessel Kets well into the tropics
will be Bon too awful lo contem
plate. It must be remembered that there
[a do mess deck, no place where the men
can sit and eat tneir meals and enjoy their
leisure. The unlucky soldier who ships
on one of these steamers must either be
in his bunk or on deck; there is absolute
ly no other place for him. It does not
seem to have occurred to the officials who
planned the expedition that a soldier re
quires at lea^t some of the rudiments of
civilized life, a table to eat off and a
bench to sit on. even if they be made but
of plain wood.
No doubt the soldiers will be fully pre
pared to rough it. The discomfort in
volved by these arrangements would not
be such a serious question in timÂ» of war,
were it not for the sanitary danger in
volved. If an epidemic should break out
on these crowded troop <1> cks it might
rapidly develop Into a national calamity.
Certainly there is a hospital on board,
but it can only accommodate a limited
number of patients, and beyond a certain
point would be quite useless. There is no
way by which the decks can be cleared
and fumigated; it will be Impossible to
remove the bedding and air it, and dis
ease, once it gains an entrance, will have
everything its own way. The only re
deeming feature about the whole affair
Is that the City of Peking has a fine,
roomy upper deck, and most of the men
will find it necessary to sleep up there
during the voyage.
A similar condition of affairs exists on
board the City of Sydney, though per
haps thÂ«* berths are not quite so crowded.
In addition this boat has a covered hur
ricane deck, which will provide shelter
during bad weather. As long as the voy
age is finÂ«". and the men are enabled to
live in the open, things may go on all

right, but if storms are encountered, di
the ship runs into one of those terribl<
typhoons, so common at this time of tht
year about the Philippines, disastrous,
consequences may be expected.
It would have been much cheaper, as
well as healthier, to have dispensed with
all this useless encumbrance of bunks.
At a nominal cost, each soldier could
have been provided with a hammock, to
sling from hooks on the beams overhead.
Even the rawest landsman soon learns
how to manage these swinging beds, and
as to comfort they are infinitely prefera
ble to a hard mattress in a tixed bunk.
But this is not the main point about a
hammock; its chief advantage Is thai
during the daytime it can be rolled Up
and stowed in the nettings, leaving th< j
troop deck airy and unencumbered. Mess
tables, hanging from above, after the
man-of-war style, should have been pro
vided, and these, with benches, would
have made comfortable living quarters for
the men during the day. It is quite
evident that whoever is responsible for
the work of fitting out these steamers
has taken as his model one of the Klon
dike human cattle carriers, of which some
brilliant examples have lately left this
port.
As to supplying the ship for the voy
age, little or nothing has been done. The
dock is still encumbered with a vast pile
of military stores and provisions, all of
which have yet to be put on board. The
Army Department seems to be hopeless
ly paralyzed by its efforts to send away
this first small detachment of troops.
What will happen if it becomes neces
sary to send thirty, or even fifty thou
sand soldiers to the Philippines Is a ques
tion which may well be referred to Prov
idence for an answer.
The scow schooner Apache brought
down the last of the storea required for
the voyaicc yesterday | and Captain Bing
ham is getting things on board as quick
ly as possible. The bunks for the sol
diers were all finished last night, the
carpenters have deserted the ship, and
the military authorities will make their
inspection to-day.
TROUBLE ON THE OMEGA.
The Barkentine's Crew De-
serted When Grays Har
bor Was Reached.
The barkentine Omega is In trouble at i
Grays Harbor. She left here with a full
crew, but as soon as the vessel reached
port the men left her In a body. It was
impossible to secure another crew at that
point, so the captain telegraphed to Seat
tle but failed there also. He then pent
word to the owners here, and if the men
can be got together they will be sent
north on the steam schooner Signal to- j
day. The chances are' that In order to
get the barkentine back to San Francisco
her owners will have to pay the sailors
union wages.
The new steamer Roanoke is shortly to
go into commission in the St. Michael
run. Dr. E. A. Diggins, one of the very
capable and popular internes at the liar
.bor Receiving Hospital, will go out as \
surgeon on her. While the vessel is lying ,
off the mouth of the Yukon Dr. Diggins
is going to fish for nuggets, and he ex- |
pects to get enough specimens to supply j
his host of friends on the front with one !
each when he returns.
The barkentine Catherine Sudden will !
probably get away Tuesday next with 125 j
gold-hunters for Kotzebue Sound. Be- ,
tween fifty and sixty of her passengers !
are now living aboard and are praying
that the sailing of the vessel may not be I
delayed. The two launchesâ Nugget and
Mattie Farnsworthâ that are going up on
the barkentine had their trial trips yes

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 21, 1898.
DARKNESS IS THEIR FRIEND
Under Its Cover Advocates of the Charter Post
Bills and Violate the Law.
T'RIENDS of Mayor Phelan and the new charter. In one last endeavor to
p Inaugurate a reign of one-man power over the people of this city, have
X lately banded themselves together In gangs of midnight raiders and law
breakers. This was not unexpected, but It was hardly thought that they would
commit any forbidden act out under the sky even under the cover of dark
ness, but as It would have greatly Interfered with their plans to have carted
their secret chamber, with its bolted doors, around with them they left it be
hind. Each night sees them at work, and the voting booths recently erected
for the coming election, notwithstanding the fact that the law forbids, are de
faced with gorgeous posters which appeal to the voters to forget their own
interests and manifest the fact that they prefer a monarchy to a republic by
voting for the new charter.
â¢'Vote for charter. Election May 25, 1898. For good government and home
rule. Indorsed by improvement -clubs. Merchants' Association and labor or
ganizations. Opposed by the combined bosses." So reads the poster, and em
blazoned In the colors of Old Glory It makes an appearance more formidable
than Its influence, as the voters are aware that behind Its beauty and its ap
peal a story of questionable ambition lies.
Ench and every man who has had a hand in the hanging of the posters Is
guilty of crime. The law on the subject cannot be misinterpreted, even by
the immature minds of the law-breakers, as It is too plain. It reads:
"Every person who willfully puts up, affixes, fastens, prints or paints
upon any property belonging to the State or city and county any no
tice or advertisement, or any picture, sign or device without license and
permission, is guilty of a misdemeanor."
Printed in bold type on the election proclamation this section of the law
appears, but right beside it hang the posters of the new charter advocates.
These men, now criminals, who did the work knew that they were violating
the law, but as they read the section doubtless they laughed contemptuously
at those who framed it; at those who regard It, and at those who, angered at
the vandalism, will see that it is obeyed.
Registrar Blggy, when he heard that the law had been violated by the
friends of the charter, was greatly surprised, but not more so than he was
determined that the work of the political tools must cease. "The hanging of
posters on the election booths is In direct violation of the law," he said yes
terday afternoon, "and in the morning I shall report the condition of affairs to
the Election Commission. In the meantime I will have my deputies endeavor
to locate the bill posters, ascertain their names and see that they cease their
law breaking. On the action of the commission my further actions will be
based, and prosecution may follow. Although the law states that bills may
be posted If license ar.d permission is granted, It Is certain that I have not been
consulted by the bill posters or those who put them at their task. Neither has
the Election Commission, and It naturally follows that the bill posting Is
criminal. Under no circumstances would I grant any person, faction or party
a right to hang bills on thtTbooths. My position is undoubtedly a judicial one.
I must see that all parties are Justly dealt with, and an action on my part of
that kind would be undoubtedly unjust and narrow-minded, if not illegal. In
any event, the work shall be stopped, and that already done shall be attended
to."
Auditor Broderick and Mayor Phelan both manifested surprise when they
were informed of the action of the bill posters. Auditor Broderick was in turn
greatly angered that the law should be so flagrantly violated, and promised
that there would be a surprise In store for some clique a very short time after
the commission meets this morning. In the meantime, however, or at l^ast
during the hours of darkness, the skulking, mysterious bands will paste
away, unmindful of the law, uninformed as to its possible effect.
City and County Attorney Creswell stated that he gave no person or
party permission to hang the posters, and that such a practice was contrary to
the orders of the Election Commission. He said: "The Election Commission
has given an order right along that there should be no bill posting done by
anybody on the election houses, and if any such bill posting has been done it
is in violation of the orders of the commission. The commission will meet to
morrow morning, and it appears to me that they will do in this case as they
have done in the past if the matter is brought to their attentionâ that is, order
\he Registrar to tear down the posters."

NO VACATION
Policemen Hurt on Duty
Must Pay for It.
A QUESTION IS ANSWERED.
CITY EMPLOYES UNDER THE
CHARTEB IN BAD FIX.
Auditor Broderlck Plainly Says That
He Would Befuse to Audit
Demands for Time Lost
in Service.
The following correspondence on the
liability of the city officials and em
ployes under the new charter will be
read with peculia* interest:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 20, IS9B.
Hon. William Broderick, Auditor City
and County of San Francisco, City.â Dear
Sir: I desiro to call your attention to a
communication published in The Call on
May 19, signed by I. Outte, late a
member of the Board of Freeholders. In
the communication In question Mr. Outte
declares that the provisions of section 33,
article 16, of the new charter do not affoct
employes of the Fire, Police and School
departments under the instrument. The
provisions of Baid section are as follows:
"No deputy, clerk or other employe of
the city and county shall be paid for a
greater time than that covered by his
actual service." (Page 145, Charter Pam
phlet.)
Mr. Gutte contends that no deputy,
clerk or other employe working for an
annual salary would be affected by the
section quoted, and he holds that It was
intended to apply and does apply only to
temporary attaches of the municipal gov
ernment.
I also desire- to call your attention to
the provisions of section 6, chapter 2,
article IV of the proposed charter. This
section reads in part as folows:
"No demand shall be allowed by the
Auditor * â¢ â¢ in favor of any officer or
employe for the time he shal have ab
sented himself without legal cause from
the duties of his office during office hours.
The Auditor must always examine on
oath any person receiving a salary from
the city and county touching such ab
sence."
The question I ask you, in view of this
condition of the proposed law, is this:
Would you audit a warant In favor of
any deputy, clerk or other employe of the
city and county for time not actuelly con
sumed in the service of the city? Of
course, I except from this question fire
men who have been disabled in the dis
charge of their duties, as there is a
special provision in the Fire Department
article covering their cases.
As Auditor, the charter makes you re
sponsible on your official bond for passing
illegal demands. Would not a demand
drawn jÂ£ iaver of a deputy, clerk or other
employe for time not actually consumed
In the service of the city bÂ« an illegal
demand?
This question is of neat interest to all
employes of the municipal government.
and for the purpose of resolving whatever
doubt may exist In their minds as to the
probable action of yourself, or any person
who may occupy the position of Auditor
under the proposed charter, I respectfully
request you to return me as soon as pos
sible your answer. Very respectfully
yours, W. 8. L.IOAK K.
SAX FRANCISCO. May 20, 1898.
W. S. L,eake Esq.â Dear Sir: Your
favor of even date is at hand. I have
carefully examined the Quotations
made, and in answer would say that I
believe the Auditor would bÂ»- obliged to ;
refuse the audit of all demands notsus
tained by the provisions of section 33
Of article XVI of the charter, If acting
as auditor under its provisions.
The consolidation act, section 82,
made it the duty of the Auditor to re
fuse to audit -demands of officers who
absented themselves from office during
Office hours, and that he might exam- .
me such officers on oath touching such
absence. The charter has - amended
that section to the extent of adding
the words "or employes" and that th<; i
Auditor "must always" examine on
oath any person touching such ab
sence.
The courts have decided that the
provisions of section 32, as a principle, j
cannot apply to statutory officersâ
that salaries to statutory officers go to
the offices filled and not to the detail of
service rendered.
The salaries are based upon the title
to office and not the detail amount of
service. ';'. \ ':â '' ,.'. i
It is quite evident that the intent of
the Board of Freeholders was to appl>
the penalty to all kinds of employes as
well as officers, and while their inten
tion may not affect officers, it may em
ployes. I have no knowledge of any
court decisions on the question of sal
aries to clerks and employes, and
therefore In the absence of such, I am
of the opinion that the Auditor would
be compelled to recognize the provis
ions of section 33 as those to govern
his action and as a clear and definite
expression of the intent of the law
making power. The courts have al
ways held that the Intention of the
Legislature should govern in the exe
cution of all laws (not unconstitution
al or void). I consider demands, except
those of statutory officers, drawn in
conflict with section 33, illegal under
the charter, and the Auditor would b?
liable on his bond should he sign such.
Yours respectfully,
WILLIAM BRODERICK, Auditor.

DROPPED A
POWDER IN
HIS COFFEE
Jos. Hayes Drugged
by a Stranger.
MET HIM ON THE STREET.
! TAKEN TO A LODGING-HOUSE
AND BOBBED.
Chief Lees Notified and Two Detec
tives Are Detailed to Hunt
for the Desperate
Thief.
I Joseph Hayes, living at 109 Grove street.
! complained to the police last night that
I he had been drugged and robbed by a
stranger whom he met on Kearny street.
According to his story he was walking
along the street, and when near Clay ho
was accosted by a middle-aged man who
pretended to have met him some time
ago. After a short conversation the
stranger, after announcing that he hail
just returned from a trip to Dawson City,
Invited him to have dinner with him.
Hayes accepted his offer, and together
they wont to a restaurant on Third street,
where his new found friend claimed that
his brother worked. After partaking of
the meal Hayes became dizzy, as he ex
pressed it, and walked outside. The
stranger followed him, and advised him
to seek medical aid. At his suggestion
Hayes allowed his new found friend to
i take him to a room In a lodging house
at 663 Mission street.
After reaching the room he became un-
I conscious, and remained in that condi
! tlon until the next morning. When he j
i started to dress himself he discovered |
i that the stranger had robbed him of a j
i diamond ring, a silver watch and chain, j
j a gold scarf pin and $12 in money.
Realizing he had been drugged by his
despoiler, Hayes at once visited police
headquarters and reported the matter to
Chief Lees. He claimed that after enter-
Ing the restaurant he noticed the stran
j ger drop some white substance in his
' coffee. H<- asked him what he meant,
| and was told that the "powder" greatly
! improved the beverage.
"We always use it In Dawson," he re
! marked. "Coffee without the powder
would be considered dishwater in the gold
j regions of the north."
A short time after drinking the coffee
! Haves felt sick, and went outside. The
waiter, evidently thinking that he in
'â  tended to "beat" him, asked him to settle
! for the dinner. Just then his "friend"
! produced his purse, and tossing a $20 gold
piece on the counter. Informed the waiter
â  that he would pay the bill. By this time
Hayefl had reached the street, and as he
realized ne was fast losing consciousness
he accepted the offer of the stranger to
â  go to his room.
Hayes describes the man as being about
35 years of age, and had a light mustache.
li. spoke with a slight foreign accent
â¢ which Hayea thinks was assumed.
After listening to the story Chief I.ees
detailed two of his best men to hunt the
robber.

Vice-Commodore G. T. S. White's Will
o* the Wisp, of the San Francisco Yacht
Club, returned to her moorings at Sau-
Balito early last Sunday. The vice-com
modore has lost two of his crew: F. A.
L. Bobarts, formerly of the Bank of
British Columbia, having returned to
England via the Canadian Pacific Rail
way, and Arthur Naylor having bought a
sloop of his own, which he sailed down j
from Benicia last Sunday, reaching Sau
salito on Monday evening. She is not
named yet, but will be enrolled with the
San Franeiscos.
There will be a dance at the house of
the San Francisco Yacht Club this even
ing, under the management of the house
committee, which consists of Port Captain
Dr. A. W. McKenzle, Financial Secretary
W. G. Morrow and Secretary Charles B.
Hill. For the convenience of visitors from
the city a tug will leave Mission street
â¢wharf at 7:30 p. m., and ' will leave the
clubhouse on the return trip at 11.
The opening entertainment and dance of
the Encinal Yacht Club at Alameda last
Saturday were very successful, in spite
of the bad weather; but the opening
cruise -set down on the programme for
Sunday did not come off. To-day is an
owners' day, and to-morrow la open.
E. A. Wiltsee, whose fine schooner Ag- i
gie was the flagship of the Pacific Yacht

raters built by Engelbrecht for the Pa
cifies last season, only one is at present
In. a seaworthy condition; this whs kept
by R. R. l'Hommedieu in the Oakland
Creek during the -winter.
Now that the San Franciscos have ac

LATEST NEWS
OF THE
NATIONAL GAME
BY JOE CORBETT.
"Dutch" Strleb Is coming around Into
his old form again as a hitter. His re
cord of a week ago was a single, a two
bagger and a three bagger out of four
times up.
The Santa Cruz team has lost two
games straight, and In view of that fact
the "ancient order of hammer throwers,"
which society Is apparently weil repre
sented In the seaside town, is beginning
to weep and wail, and has already In
flicted severe damages on the atmos
phere, but if it were not for these "fa
natics" where would our glorious game
of baseball be? When one considers that
the league has hardly started these cries
of "we have a poor team and cannot win"
are certainly out of place. The "Beach
combers" have lost but two games, and
the town is beginning to kick, and such
kicking Is ill timed. Give the boys a
chance, and always bear In mind that a
team must lose occasionally. The "^each
combers" will lose a few more games ere
c.ie finish, and so will every club in the
league, for that matter, but don't start
in to condemn before the boys have been
given an opportunity to at least get in
playing condition. Manager Tuttle be
lieves he has the "crack" team of the
league. He saya "as stoon as the Beach
combers strike their gait the other teams |
will have to hustle to keep in sight. We
intend breaking the string of victories the
San Franeiscos so proudly stagger un
der next Saturday, and thence to Sac
ramento on Sunday, with the grim de
termination to take some of the polish
off the famous 'Gilt Edges.' " Tuttle
does not jest in matters pertaining to
baseball, so keep your eye on his "salted
almonds"; they will be a hard nut to]
crack from now On.
The Fresno fans are very jubilant over [
the success of their team. They claim :
to have the best bitting, surest rield'ng ;
and fastest team in the State.
"The Pacific Northwest League" prom
ises to make a barrel of trouble for our
"consolidated friends," and if some move
Is not made by the "strategic board"
which will prevent players from jumping
contracts, there is no telling what may ;
happen. Already Manager George Bor- -
chera of the "Portlands" has enticed one i
of the famous "Beachcombers"' to leave
the Kuyety of the seashore, and from all
accounts has opened up negotiations with
the majority of our best players. Man
ager Tuttle writes that Captain Dever
eaux received a very flattering offer from
Mr. Borchers, including expenses, but be
ing assured as good a guarantee by him
he wired Manager Borchers that he
would remain with his "first love." t
"Smiler" Hopkins, "however." has left
and he cannot be blamed for bettering !
himself. There Is only one way to stop
this sort of work, and that is to offer
the same Inducements to players
as does Mr. Borchers. Neither league
is under the National protection and both
would have to take it before players
could be stopped from Jumping their con
tracts.
If the Pacific Coast League should go
under National protection it could Dot
prevent its players from joining an in
dependent organization. And the same
holds goods of the Pacific Northwest
League. If both, however, should take
this protection, then players would be
compelled to remain with the club which
holds their signatures. This business will
cause no end of trouble, especially if play
ers take advantage of it. They cannot
be blamed for accepting an offer which
will bring more money. The managers
should discuss this very important ques
tion at their next meeting.
George McLaughlin of the Athletics has
an arm that any big leaguer would be
proud of.
"Hen" Stultz's playing on the Initial bag
has caused no end of comment among
the players. In two games he has ac- j
cepted thirty-one chances with only one I
i error. Great work. Hen.
Managers Kaplan and Crowley are nego
tiating for the services of an Eastern
catcher by the name of Zekenbach. The
gentleman carries his own "shed" to pro
! tect himself from being killed by "foul
flies." The little joke emanates from
witty Kaplan, whose reputation as a
"joker" has yet to be equaled in the
baseball arena.
The Olympic Cyclers not only ride on
wheels and street cars, but they have a
ball team which has defeated every cy
clers' team in the State except the Bay
City boys, and judging from the article
i of ball these "heavyweights" have been
I putting up ever since they organized it
is no wonder that they have won a stand
ing in the amateur baseball world for
years to come. Out of all tho games in
which they participated, the percentage
| column never changed, they having at
| tamed the highest possible recordâ looo per
cent. This was brought about only after
hard and faithful service, every member
of the team doing his part. Their only
i regret is the abrupt ending of the league,
j before they were given an opportunity to
meet the Bay City boys, who, however,
arf behind them, having been defeated.
The team from all accounts has dis
banded for the season, but is prepared to
reorganize should any of the cyclers'
teams wish satisfaction. Their pitcher,
Mr. Head, by his clever work and great
batting, has demonstrated that he Is quite
fast enough for the Pacific Coast League,
and should be given a chance.
Following is the line up for to-day's
game:

AMATEUR BOXING
IS NOW BOOMING.
Unless some restrictions are placed on
the members of amateur boxing clubs
that are springing up here and there like
mushrooms in April, this city will be
overrun with scrappers of all sizes,
weights and colors within a few months.
There is scarcely an evening, of the
week now that a boxing entertainment is
not held in some quarter of the city, and
the great wonder is that the boxers have
escaped so far without severe results,
considering that the rings within which
the contests are held are free from pad
ding. .
The authorities who are supposed to
look out f,or the ; safety of life and limb
should certainly insist on boxing club
managers seeing that the floor of a ringon
which fistic contests are held must be
padded with boiler; felt, and not with
sawdust that is "generally used because
it is cheap, before an exhibition is al
lowed to proceed. .
Boxers, and especially tyros, who go in
for hard punching without, paying the
least , attention ;â  to < the ' scientific part of
the game, frequently receive heavy ails t
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 21, 1898.
which not infrequently crush thÂ« skull
To avoid accidents of this kind the floor
should be covered with two inches or
padding. It may cost more than saw
dust, but in the end It will be found
pleasantly cheap for all concerned.
As all kinds and manners of boxers are
now seeking notoriety, It would be as well
also that the police authorities insist on
having a physician's certificate pronounc
ing the contestants physically sound.
Many of the young men who participate
in boxing contests are not by any means
sound of body. It Is a surprise to many
thut casualties of a severe nature have
not occurred before now.
The Manhattan Athletic Club ha* an
nounced that it will give a first class en
tertainment on Monday evening at Its
rooms, 1749 Mission street. Fred Muller
states that he is ready and anxious to
meet Lon Agnew or Frank McConnell in
a twenty-round contest, to weigh in at
145 pounds at the ringside, or he will meet
"Spider" Kelly at 135 pounds.
The Excelsior Athletic Club will enter
tain its members on Friday evening next.
The programme is as, follows: Three
round contests between Jimmy La wlor
vs. Billy Otts, Joe Kennedy vs. Joe Ma
her. Joe Kane vs. Jack O'Brien. Kid Par
sons vs. John McMahon, Frank Skruse
vs. Billy Hogan, Jim McDevitt vs. Tom
Devlne.'Jack Lahey vs. Fred Muller and
an eight-round contest between Jim Lee
and Pat Brown for the championship of
the club and a gold medal.
The main event will be an eight-round
contest between Yank Savage and Jimmy
Rlley for a valuable trophy.
The Occidental Handball and Athletic
Club will hold its inaugural entertainment
at 120 Grove street on Tuesday, the 24th
Inst. It will consist of boxing, wrestling
nii.l handball exhibitions. The events of
the evening will be an eight-round bout
between Eugene Mulligan and Jack Gran-
Held and an eight-round bout between
Joe Henderson and Mike Young.
The Health and Police Committee de
cided yesterday to report favorably the
resolution granting the Occidental Ath
letic Club permission to give a boxing ex
hibition between May 20 and 30.
The committee also decided to report
favorably the application of the Manhat
tan Athletic Club for permission to give
an exhibition of boxing between June 6
and 30.
The California Athletic Club petitioned
the board for permission to give monthly
boxing exhibitions at 1108 Golden Gate
avenue, and the committee agreed to re
port the resolution granting the permis
sion with the recommendation that it
pass.
The committee reported adversely the
petition of the Pythian Athletic Club for
permission to give monthly boxing exhi
bitions.
ARIEL ROWING CLUB

1-ast Sunday was a quiet day at the
South Knd Boat Club house. A few men
boxed or punched the bag, but no crews
went out. Kmmett ilaydcn, manager of
tlie Xl Campo picnic grounds, says that
he is prepared to submit to the Pacific
Amateur Athletic Association a definite
proposition for a regatta to be held at
Xl Campo in the latter part of June. To
enable the management to offer more sub
stantial Inducements to the oarsmen and
scullers he will suggest that the races
should be held on two successive Sun
daysâthe outrigger skiff and shell races
on the lirst Sunday and the barge races
on the second. All the rowing clubs are
to be invited to take part in the regatta.
Should such a regatta be held, the South
Knd Rowing Club will endeavor to be
well represented in all the events. It has
plenty of good material to select from
and many members ea^er to take part.
As one of the "midget" crew Is unable to
go Into training the club may be repre
sented by a new senior crew and expects
to be able to get a strong one. The "Irish"
crew will meet all corners in the interme
diate barge race, but the junior crew has
not yet been selected. The South End
Club will also be well represented in the
sculling events.
The Dolphin Swimming and Boating
Club recently passed a resolution to admit
none but American citizens as members.
W. O. Patch and Victor Caglieri have
been going out three times a week In
skiffs, and the latter, being heavy and In
good training, should have a very good
chance of winning the A. B. Treadwell
medal for junior skiffs, which will be
competed for to-morrow. The entries
closed last Sunday and are as follows:
Victor Caglieri, T. J. Hopkins, C. M. Far
rell, T. R. Keenan and J. 1-alb.
There was very little doing at the
Olympic boathouse at Tlburon last Sun
day, but half a dozen rooms are being
painted and put in order for members, so
that from this time forth greater activ
ity may be expected.
The Alameda Boat Club has lost an
other member through the Hlspano-Am
erican conflict, for Samuel Marston has
enlisted as a volunteer.

RELAY BETWEEN
OLYMPIC
AND RENO RIDERS
The relay team of thÂ« Olympic Club
Wheelmen will leave on a special Pull
man car attached to the S o'clock over
land to-night for Reno. Nev., being billed
to race a team of ten men from the Keno
Wheelmen In a relay race at 52^ miles
to-morrow, each man to ride 5Vi miles.
The event is to take place on a horse
track, and the Olympics expect a hard
rare, but if the higher altitude does not
affect them they will give a good account
of themselves.
PJx-Captaln Herman D. Hadenfeldt Is
the manager of the team, assisted by
Trainer Dent. The Olympic team will
comprise H. D. Bean, K. A. Bozio, K. O.
Kragness, L. H. Smith. E. F. Ross,
George Tantau, George E. Kroetz, J. H.
Ward, J. E. Wing and E. Tucker; O. E.
Bozio substitute.
Stanley, who was a member -of the
Olmpic relay team, will ride for the Renos
in thlÃ race, as he halls from that city.
Captain Loos, Chester S. Myrick, F.
Alonteulegre. Henry Buss, Harry Cos
griff, Ed Bose and a number of other en
thusiastic Olympians, will accompany the
team on the trip. They expect to get
back early Monday forenoon.
E. A. Bozio will not try for the rive
and ten mile road records to-morrow on
account of hia trip to Reno with the
Olympics.
Wilbur P. Knapp is still in Chicago,
but Is anxious to get bark to California,
according to Jimmy Joyce. Joyce also
met George Strattoii In the Windy City,
and says the ex-road racing chairman
has lost fully twenty-five pounds, and
also pines for his native heath.
In spite of the heavy downpour of rain
last Sunday the Olympic Cyclers held
their outing at Escalles. It might more
properly be called an "Inning," as those
of the members who did make the trip
went minus their wheels, and the games
and entertainment were conducted in
doors. About sixty attended, whereas
fully 200 were expected had the wtather
been fair. The club Intends holding an
other picnic at the same place for those
who missed the Bport last Sunday. The
date will probably be June 19.
The postponed "Old Men's Hun" of the
Reliance Club Wheelmen will be held
to-morrow under the same conditions as
told In last Saturday's Call. There will
be no "hold-over" chicken from last Sun
day, ami every one who attends, is prom
ised a gala time.
H. Austin (Joddard of the Bay City
Wheelmen departed on the Mariposa for
Australia Thursday afternoon, and a
large delegation of his clubmates was
down to the boat to Bee him Off. Tues
day evening previous President Frank H.
Kerrigan gave a dinner party at a down
town rotisserie in honor of Mr. Goddard
and James Joyce Jr. TbOM Dresent were:
H. Austin Â»;Â«,'Ul.inl, Janus Joyce Jr.,
Frank 11. Kerrigan, George. P. \\ etmore,
William 11. Toepke, Herbert IÂ». Clark,
David McT. Marshall, Ivan Treadwell
and 11. W. Spaldlng.
Mr. Joyce is still in the city, but ex
pects to go back East in a few lay. I .
A touching scene was enacted in a
promlm-nt local club the other evening,
when H. Austin Goddard and Edwin S.
Battles met for the first time since their
memorable match race over the San Le
andro course two years ago. At that
time it was the event of the month, as
both were known as hardy road riders.
and bringing them together was the
matching of champions. Both belonged
.to the Bay City Wheelmen, and the club
members split in their partisanship, one
half favoring Battles and the other God
dard. A good deal of feeling was en
gendered and considerable sums of money
changed hands on the result. Goddard
won after a hard fought contest, but
Battles, though beaten, was not dis
graced, and he and bis backers sat down
to a banquet thirty strong that night,
not to drown their sorrows, but to show
that they were "easy losers."
After that night Battles and Goddard
kept out of each other's way, and many
thought an enmity for life had been
formed, but not so. Goddard went East
shortly afterward, and returned last week
after eighteen months' absence, passing
through this city en route to Australia.
He visited his club and almost the first
man he met was Battles. "Hello, Ed
die": "Hello, Austin." they greeted each
other, and with a hearty handshake sat
down and for an hour rehashed the old
story of that memorable ride. And
neither would consent to a return match.
The Touring Guide and Road Book of
the California Associated Cycling Clubs
for 189S Is at last out. The highest praise
that can be awarded the efforts of the
compilers Is to say that the book justifies
the long delay. Nothing so elaborate and
complete has ever before been prepared
for the touring wheelman. Jn addition
to tabulated routes and maps covering
the principal traveled roads in the State
and the list of hotels and stopping places
(with the rat^s given C. A. C. C. mem
bers), there Is a mass of general Infor
mation, Including an article on the law
of the road, a digest of the bicycle and
road ordinances In force In the various
counties of the State, an article on tour
ing, containing many valuable hints, and
a full description of the most popular
tours.
The selected tours are arranged with
reference to the time required therefor;
so that a person may select his tour in
accordance with the time at his disposal.
Among the longer tours the Yosemite
Valley tour and the Lake County tour
may be especially mentioned; a full and
complete itinerary Is given for each of
these tours. In the article on touring
there is a short chapter devoted to "first
aid" for injured cyclists, with clear and
explicit directions for the treatment of
wounds, fractures and other Injuries.
The tabulated routes are very ingen
iously arranged and show at a glance
the directions to be taken, distances be
tween points, the total distance from the
starting point, the condition of the road
and post, express and telegraph offices,
as well as railroad and stage stations. .
The book is bound in substantial flexi
ble cloth binding, and is of a size to be
conveniently carried In the pocket. It
is not for sale, but Is given free to every
member of the C. A. C. C.
On May 4 last, Horace Dennie, W. W.
Gray, W. W. Knapp and George Booth,
members of the Tiger Cycle Club of Bos

California. It Is their intention to make
the trip overland via the central route,
and they will try to reduce the existing
record.

WHEN WILL THE COAST
STREAMS BE STOCKED?
Anglers regret very much that the lakes
of the Spring Valley "Water Company will
not be thrown open this season.
During the summer months when the
streams are very low and clear the Spring
Valley lakes were the only solace of the
lovers of the rod. who have enjoyed many
pleasant hours in trolling from boats or
â¢whipping: flies over the crystal water in
the early morning before, old Sol popped
up with his blazen face from behind the
hills on the east side of San Andreas
Lake.
How such of the old army of spooners
as Braunsdorff, Rondeau, Smith,
Dolliver, Banker, Hewson, Andy, Walker.
Brooks, Butler, Benn, Lemmer, Taylor,
Watt, Johnson. Eaton, Precht, Green,
dimming. Finch, McÃae, Newman, Wil
son, Marcus and many others who are
passionately fond of fishing will miss the
old lakes this year!
The grand open st: ams and rivers of
the mountains are too far distant from
this city to be reached by the fraternity
who can't afford a vacation, and unfortu
nately the coast streams contain only fln
gerllngs, which, although toothsome and
excellent for table use, afford little sport
to the angler who takes a special delight
In hearing the reel "kick up a rumpus"
when a game fish has taken possession at
the end of the line.
This should be a splendid year for
stream stocking, by the way, and It can
\<f said without fear of contradiction
that unless the Fish Commissioners will
give some attention to the creeks which
are within easy reach of this city and
stock them during this summer there
will not be any sport for anglers next
year. The steelheads were unable to
reaoh their spawning grounds last win
ter, owing to extreme low water, conse
quently the annual supply of fry not be
ing in evidence the prospects for the fu
ture are not by any means encouraging.
This forenoon the Fly Casting Club will
hold a contest at Stow I^Â«.ke, where the
usual smashing of records in long dis
tance casting will doubtless result,
weather permitting. On Tuesday evening.
the 241h inst., the club will hold a busi
ness meeting in Assembly Hall, Mills
building.
CRICKETERS AT THE
GOLDEN GATE.
The opening cricket match *of the sea
son of 1898, Alameda vs. Pacific, began at
Golden Gate ground on Sunday, May 8,
the first Innings being not quite played
out. The first Innings should have been
finished and the second innings played last
Sunday, May 15, but on account of the
rain so few of the cricketers put in an
appearance that it was Impossible to con
tinue the game. The event set down on
the programme of the California Cricket
Association for to-morrow is Married vs.
Single, on the Alameda ground. It Is un
lucky for the Pacifies not to have been
able to finish the match last Sunday, as
they made so good a score in the first
innings that they reasonably felt pretty
certain of winning the first match of the
season.
Until a few weeks ago the highest ag
gregate score in one Innings was 887,
made by Yorkshire against Warwick
shire at Birmingham in May, 1596, four of
the Yorkshire eleven making centuries.
The next highest aggregate scores in one
innings was 843, made by the Australians
against Oxford and Cambridge, Past and
Present, at Portsmouth in August, 18SÂ«;
and 803, made by Non-Smokers against
Smokers at Melbourne In May. 1597. But
these scores have been entirely eclipsed
by that made In a match played at Mel
bourne between the University of Mel
bourne and Kssendon, in which five fcats
nien of the University team scored cen
turies, their agregate score being 889, and
the total score of the eleven 1094. As P^s
sendon scored only 7t> runs, the University
won by an Innings and 1018 runs.
At Singleton, in Victoria, Australia, C.
Maguire recently took all ten wickets for
one run, the result of an overthrow. In
the Becond innings of the same match
Maguire took five wickets with five suc
cessive bulls. There are more than a
dozen instances on record of all ten wick
ets in an innings being taken by one
bowler, and there are five instances 'of
four wickets being taken in four consecu
tive balls; but Maguire's performances
surpass these.
A POSTOFFICE PARTY.
Postmaster Montague Gives an Out
ing on the Bay to the Chief of the
Salary and Allowance Division.
Postmaster Montague yesterday gave an
outing on the bay to George W. Beavers,
chief of the salary and allowance division,
who is paying the postofflces on this coast
an official visit of inspection. Mr. Heav
ers and a select party of invited friends
bf the postmaster went on* board the
custom house launch Golden Gate and
took a delightful trip around the bay.
Among the points of interest visited were
the Union Iron Works, the Golden Gate.
Raccoon Straits. Belvedere, Sausalito, An

This Week's Wasp.
The gathering of the volunteer army Is
naturally the prominent feature of this
week's Wasp's illustrations. A number
of scenes at the Presidio are given, in
cluding one of Major Roe and other offi
cers of the Fourteenth Regiment U. S.
Infantry. Of the cartoon features, the
depletion of the school fund cupboard
and the opening night incident at the dog
show are especially clever. Besides pic
tures of several of the United States na
val vessels, there are pictures of Rear
Admiral Dewey and feampson, and one of
"KiÃhting Hob" Evans. The pretensions
of shoddydom is discussed interestingly
by Tabltha Twiggs in "The Old Maid's
Diary." Other features are a "Wife's
Grievance," a short tale without a moral,
by the Story Teller, and an expose of the
tricks to fool the credulous, by the Pro
fessor, in the X-ray column; the weekly
financial review, and the musical and
dramatic criticisms. In the Plain Talks
to Public Characters the Board of School
Directors is severely scored. Honorable
Lawrence Mullrooney tells how our
statesmen rule the nation. The editorials
are vigorous and entertaining, and alto
gether this weeks' Wasp is an especially
clever number of that always up-to-date
weekly.
Mrs. Mahoney's Judgment.
Mrs. Delia Mahoney, who has been su
ing Lucky Baldwin for the amount of a
debt she claimed was due from G. W.
Dexter, Baldwin's manager, was awarded
a judgment of So yesterday by Judge Car
roll. She claimed that Baldwin had made
himself responsible for the amount of the
debt, but Baldwin said he had agreed to
pay but half of it and he had already
paid her $05. This was accepted by the
court and Mrs. Mahoney was given judg
ment for the 55 still due on Baldwin's half
of the debt.
Battered His Father.
Frank Costagalinl of 600 Francisco
street swore to a complaint in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday for the ar
rest of his son Louis, 17 years of age, on
a charge of battery. Thursday they had
a dispute, when the boy knocked bis fath
er down and beat him badly.
TOURNAMENTS
OF THE
TRAP SHOOTERS
The Olympic Gun Club will burn pow
der at bluerocks to-morrow at Ingleside.
end the South End Gun Club will do like
wise at Colma.
The next and most important features
of the seasonâ that is, so far as trap
shooting Is concernedâ will be the annual
meeting of the California Inanimate
Target Association at Ingleside on the j
29th and 30th inst., where the sixth tour- j
nament of the association will be held; j
and the State live-bird tournament, wiiich j
will be held on the same grounds com
mencing on June 3 and ending on June 5.
The gun clubs represented in the asso
ciation of inanimate target-smashers are
the Lincoln, Olympic, Empire, Garden
City, Monterey Wing and Reliance. It is
doubtful If the Reliance Gun Club will
be represented this year by a team from
the City of the Oaks. The San Joaquin
Gun Club, the Stockton Gun Club and its
annex, also the Antioch Gun Club should
have some representation; but it seems
that the once popular sport of smashing j
inanimate targets is fast losing its charm, j
doubtless because of recent years there
have been too many "dead" shots among |
the clubs, who carry away the cream, j
leaving the skim milk to the fairly good
trap. shots, who seldom run up a clean
score.
The representatives of sporting goods
houses should be penalized heavily or
otherwise be not permitted to enter
club shoots or tournaments unless there
be an understanding between the shooter '
and the club that prizes cannot be won
by sportsmen who travel through the j
country in the interest of firms who deal
in sporting ware.
But it would not be altogether sports
manlike to deny them the pleasure of en
tering a club shoot if they desired to join
in it Just for the sport of the thing.
It is said that the L,os Angeles uun Club
will not figure in the coming tournament
because of the treatment it received last
year. One of its members â Leighton â
holds one of the individual trophies,
which he won at Monterey last fall. He
may put in an appearance.
In the live bird shoots purses in all high
gun events will be divided according to
the following schedule: Ten entries or
less, two moneys, viz, 60 and 40 per cent;
eleven to fifteen entries, three moneys,
viz., 50. 30 and 20 per cent; more than hf
teen entries, four moneys, viz., 40, 30, 20
and 10 per cent.
English snipe and quail on toast are
very popular dishes at some of the bon
ton city restaurants. The Game Warden
of this city and county should awake
from his hibernating spell and do. some
thing more serviceable to the country
than bagging $125 per month regularly, j
Of course, there is, unfortunately, no law
covering snipe, consequently the purvey
ors of the toothsome bird cannot be pun-
IsnecL The snipe was omitted from the,
list of game birds by the by no means
Intelligent sportsmen who helped to frame
the game laws. Their contention was
that the snipe did not breed in this State
and should not, therefore, be protected. \
What bosh! The put-their-foot-in-it law- !
makers should have inquired of some I
person who understands something about
game birds if the eanvasback duck is a
home breeder.
SOME METHODS OF
THE YELLOW FAKERS
HOW AN ARTIST BECAME A WAR
CORRESPONDENT.
And How He and His Paper, the Chi
cago Record, Were Imposed
Upon by Treachery.
It was by mere chance that John T.
McCutcheon became a war correspond
ent at Manila. For many years he was
an artist on the Chicago Record, and in
conjunction with Mr. Adee produced
every day two columns of matter en
titled, "Stories of the Street and Town."
The illustrating was of a high grade and
firmly established Mr. McCutcheon's
reputation as an artist. The stories treat
ed of every-day affairs, but were told in
a charmingly attractive style, evidencing
that the author was a man of consider
able literary ability.
About six months ago- McCutcheon ac
cepted from the captain of the McCul
loch, his warm personal friend, an invita
tion to join him in a cruise which his ves
sel had been ordered to make. His de
parture from Chicago was made the oc
casion of a. most kindly farewell demon
stration on the part of his newspaper as
sociates, who hold him In the highest
esteem.
McCutcheon, being a guest on board of
the McCulloch. was an eye-witness of the
naval battle at Manila, and of course he
took advantage of the opportunity to send
a dispatch to his paper. The only other
newspaper man present at the engage
ment was the Herald-Call correspondent,
who was on board the flagship Olympia.
â¢ McCutcheon went with the McCulloch
to Hongkong and there cabled the Chi
cago Record a dlspatcii that was graphic
and realistic, covering every important
phase of the engagement from beginning
to end and devoid of the padding which
has characterized so much of the war
news appearing in the yellow journals.
McCutcheon's cablegram reached Chi
cago Saturday night. Unfortunately the
Record does not publish a Sunday edi
tion. The New York Journal, learning of
the receipt ol this message, asked per
mission to use it, and Victor Lawson,
proprietor of the Record, furnished the
Journal with 500 words, upon the distinct
understanding that the matter was not
to be published until Monday morning, at
which time the Record would be able to
give the dispatch in full to Its own read
ers. The New York Journal violated its
promise, which should have caused no
surprise to those acquainted with the
character and methods of the*yel!"w fa
kers. It published the dispatch Sunday
morning, padded out to several thousand
words, and sent the matter to its twin
sister, the Examiner, signing the name of
McCutcheon to the expanded cablegram,
claiming him as its own correspondent,
and making him responsible for many
things he never said. But more exasper
ating than all else, the New York Jour
nal furnished the padded dispatch to the
Chicago Tribune, a competitor of the
Record.
Who Owns the Cushion and StrapP
The police want an owner for a leather
cushion and hitching strap which were
dropped out of a buggy during a runaway
on Market street a week ago.
Bills of Fare in Fashionable Res-
taurants.
The question has been mooted over and over
again whether the engrafting of French and
German dishes upon the bills of fare of the bet
ter class of American restaurants is or is not
an improvement. Many pretend that before
their Introduction our cooking was coarse, bar
baric. This is an open question, but no bill of
fare presents attractions to the dyspeptic, but
they, like the bilious, malarious and persona
with weak kidneys, can be cured by Hoa tetter's
Stomach Bitters.
A SERIES OF
LADIES'
TOURNAMENTS
The ladies are ruling at the California
Tennis Club at present and the gentlemen
players are resting free from the excite
ment and exertion of tournament con
tests. On Wednesday last the junior
ladies' class met in a doubles tourna
ment. Though the entries were not large
the matches were of unusual interest.
The first match was between Miss Eck
art and Miss Dempsey and Miss Tick
ner and Miss Chesebrough. The score
6-2 does not tell the character of the con
test. Every point was hotly contested,
and the game showed some close playing.
Miss Foster and Miss Middleton drew a
bye and met Miss . Tickner and Miss
Chesebrough In the finals. This match
was the best two out of three sets. The
first set was won in rather easy style by
Miss Tickner and Miss Chesebrough.
They scored six games to their opponents
two. The second game was of a different
kind altogether. At one time it lo Â° ked
very much as if Miss Foster and Miss
Middleton would win the set, but the
superior steadiness of the champions
proved efficacious and the second set was
Attached to their credit column with a
score of 8-6. .. _ #
Next week will see the inauguration of
a continuous tournament a , m Â° n Â£ ;; n ~
ladies. The players will be ranked by the
Ix-st judges of form and then the chal
lenging will begin. Each player will have
the right to challenge the player abo\e
her on the list, and in this way the inter
est in the game is sustained, while it is
also productive of many good contests.
This afternoon there will be a general
ladies' tournament, and the entries are
as follows: Miss Hoffman, Miss Mason,
Miss Bowman. Miss A. I'oorman, Miss L.
Farnsworth. Miss E. Redding, Miss M.
Foster Miss B. Drown, Miss F. Curry,
Miss K. Bckart. Miss R. Foster, Miss L.
Mann, Miss E. Clarke, Miss L. Denson,
Miss Tickner, Miss Middloton, Miss E.
Chesebrough, Miss IF. Chesebrough.
On account of the rain last Saturday
the intercKib match between the Ala
meda and Oakland teams did not occur.
This afternoon the teams from the Cali
fornia and the Oakland clubs will cross
rackets on the Oakland courts.
During the week the following inter
esting matches were played: Stauff and
Daly defeated Walter and Root, 6-2, 6-4.
W. McGavin and Stauff defeated Walter
and Root, 7-5, but the tables were turned
in the second set, which went to the
latter, 6-0. N. Eckart and Miss E. Warner
vie re defeated by Misses Bowman and
Foster, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. Robert X. Whitney
arid Bradshaw defeated George Whitney
and Root three sets to two. Cornell beat
Smith, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. Yale defeated Wood
bury 6-3 6-4. Miss Hoffman defeated
Miss Mason, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

BUDD WINS THE CUP.
Clean Score for the Wing Shot Cham-
pionship of America.
KANSAS CITY", May 20.â The Kansas
City Star cup, representing the wing shot
championship of America, was won in the
Missouri shooting tournament to-day by
Charles Budd of Dcs Moines. After the
sixty-five men â  ' ring for the event had
shot at twenty-live birds there remained
but five *vho hnd clean scores. These
were: Sim GHover of Rochester. N. V. :
T. J. Graham of Rosedale, Mich.; Charles
Kudd of Dcs Moines and C. S. Gottlieb
and J. B. Porter of Kansas City. Mr.
Graham was erroneously reported yester
day as having missed one of the first
twenty-five birds.
When the five cracks stepped up for
the shoot-off a heavy wind was blow
ins. Porter missed his third bird, Gott
lieb his fifth. Graham his twelfth and
Glover his fourteenth. Budd killed fifteen
straight, winning the cup.
His possession of the cup, however, may
be but temporary for, under the rules laid
down by the donor, the trophy Is to be
put up again to-morrow, when the five
marksmen who have at different times
held the cup are to compete for its per
manent ownership. Mr. Budd will have as
opponents T. A. R. Elliott, J. E. Riley,
Fred Gilbert and Sim Glover.

FAVORITES
Joe Terry the One Beaten
Cheice at Oakland.
HORTON A SPEEDY COLT.
CODA AWARDED A DOUBTFUL
DECISION OVEB ALVESO.
Wheel of Fortune Ahead of Bey de
Tierra at the Wire â Toluca
Too Fast for Her
Company.
One lonely outsider In the betting, Al
vero, endeavored to poke his nose past
the wire In front at Oakland yesterday,
but a questionable decision knocked him
out of the purse. Every other race of the
afternoon was captured by a first choice
in the betting. This one in question was
awarded to J. Naglee Burke' Coda, a
heavily backed second choice. The track
was In good condition and the attendance
large.
By Holly turned a very warm maiden
in Ilorton loose In the opening three and
I a half furlong scramble, with a field of
twelve youngsters lining up at the bar
rier. He was sent to the post a 6 to 6 fa
vorite, with Thorpe In the saddle, and
won as he pleased. In a hard drive the
10 to 1 shot. Sir Urian. took the place
from Santa Flora, a rank 100 to 1 out
sider.
If there is an ounce of the gray matter
encased in the skull of Jockey Frawley,
who rode the 11 to 5 favorite, Joe Terry,
in the mile and a furlong selling affair, he
failed to give evidence to that fact. Get
ting away from the post well, he allowed
his mount to fall back in the bunch and
stayed there. Below the paddock Miller,
astride The Dragon, had the race won,
but grew rattled and tossed it away.
Clawson on the 10 to 1 shot, Alvero, came
with a rush the last thirty yards nd to
all appearances won by a long neck but
Coda was given the decision. The show
fell to Lost Girl.
The Burns & Waterhouse colt Excur
sion was extensively supported at the
short price of 6 to 5 to beat the speedy
Toluoa in the four furlong spin for two
vear-olds, and not only failed to accom
plish the trick, but was beaten for the
show by El Mido. Toluca assumed the
lead below the paddock, and led her com

run decided under selling conditions,
Recreation was a short favorite and
leading Elsmore from the start hit the
wire half a length ahead of Honig's .horse
in 1-41% Formella handled her light im
post to good advantage, getting the show
from Morlnel by the shortest of heads.
Notwithstanding the rumors that the
Wheel of Fortune had thrown a splint,
was lame, and all that sort of paddock
bosh the mare pulled off the mile and a
furlong â¢"â¢â llirg event, fifth on the card, in
Sever" fashion. 'Perhaps if little Kiley
could have given Rev del Tlerra a more
fashionable ride the result might have
been different, for he certainly was a
good horse with the weight up. The bulk
of the money went in on the latter, which
was played down in the ring from fours
to 8 to "5. At one time during the pro
ceedings it looked as if Fortuna might
fand but after showing the way until a
furlong from the wire, she cashed in. The
Wheel then took up the running, and,
ridden out downed Rev del Tlerra a

Ferguson's hands a prime choice in the
concluding seven-ftttlong tour and after

Miller, on Zamax, aroused himself when

TRACK NOTES.
With Contra Costa Tunnel Day the long |
â¢ieere of -aolng will be brought to a close ;
at Oakland track this afternoon. Seven
events are flown for decision, including j

not be surprising if several good things
were unloaded.
The big June meeting at Denver Is at
tracting some of the best horses now rac
ing here. Fred Edwards has decided to
have a try for Colorado gold with the
flying filly Magdalenes, the speediest piece
of two-year-old racing furniture in Cali
fornia, the handy filly Lady Ashley and
the good mare Etta H.
By Holly's good coit Horton narrowly
escaped being cut down as Thorpe was
pulling up after the finish. He was
jumped on by Santa Flora, the latter fall
ing to her knees, but forunately escaped
without a scratch.
Clawson and Woods were the people
yesterday. The former rode three win
ners, and "Dugan" got home in front on
two occasions.
What a grand thing these "cheap, end
of the meeting" purses are for the hun
gry-looking poor owners. A glance at the
names of the owners of the winning
horses yesterday will show at a glance
that not one of them has an Idea where
he 1Â» going to get his next meal. Not all
of the Eastern horsemen went Into ec
staeies over the "Corriganesque" features
introduced into the game during the sea
son about to close, and they may not
come hr.ck again. Some of these owners
unfortunate enough not to have a "pull 11

NEEDS A CUSTODIAN.
Judge Troutt Decides to Appoint a
Special Administrator for the
Emeric Estate.
The contest aa to who has the legal
rl^ht to act as the special administrator
in the estate of Mrs. Eugenic E. Emeric
was opened before Superior Judge Troutt
yesterday, and the victory of the day
was evenly divided in the protracted
wrangle of Attorney Metson in behalf of
Miss Barbier and Attorney J. D. Sullivan,
representing Public Administrator Freese.
Mr. Metson arpued that under section
1413 of the Code of Civil Procedure the
preference must be given to some person
entitled by law to letters of administra
tion upon the estate.
This immediately led to a discussion on
the subject of the contest considered as
a whole, which resulted in Judge Troutt
reminding the attorney for Miss Barbier
that hisdientmust be proven to be "enti
tled to letters; the mere naming in the
will would not so entitle h?r if she should
be shown to be disqualified or incapaci
tated."
Judpre Troutt finally decided to give Em
eric until Monday to amend his contest.
A special administrator will be appointed
Tuesday.

camp Sunday, but civilians will get

"HOWLING" AS
A SUCCESS
San Francisco's Bench
Show So Declared.
A LONG LIST OF AWARDS.
THBEATS OF SECESSION AMONG
THE MASTIFF MEN.
To-Day Will Be the Last Chance
to Visit the Canine Car
nival at Mechanics'
Pavilion.
The attendance at the Bench Show at
the Pavilion yesterday exceeded that of
the previous days, and Indeed surpassed
all expectation and broke all records for
this city. There can be no question that
this year's show is a "howling" success
in more ways than one, and the Children's
Hospital Is to be congratulated on the
certainty of a substantial bonus.
The raising of Old Glory at 9:45 last
night was the signal for a spontaneous
outburst of patriotic enthusiasm.
The San Francisco Kennel Club an
nounces that to all winning exhibitors
who so desire a medal will be presented,
instead of the cash. For first prizes a
I silver medal, and for second and third
: prizes a bronze medal each.
The annual meeting of the Pacific Mas
tiff Club was held In the press room.
Routine business was transacted and two
new members elected. The board of direc
tors and all officers except the delegate
' to the A. K. C. were re-elected.
A meeting of exhibitors was held to
discuss a return to the old rules. Noth
<â  ing definite was adopted, and the meet
ing was adjourned until to-night, when
detlnite action will be taken.
Mr. Lane was elected chairman and W.
E. Chute, secretary. J. P. Norman, J. J.
Stewart and H. T. Payne spoke in favor
I of a return to the old rule, and E. S.
; Heller against it.
Dalmatians showed a remarkably large
: class, considering that the breed Is not
; very popular in this State. There was,
however, little to comment on, as the
dogs were nearly all about the average.
Hector, the winner In Limit dogs, wad
the one bright exception, and deservedly
received the winners' ribbon.
Poodles were well judged, the bitch
' Feora winning in limit and open classes
from Tricor and receiving the winners'
I ribbon.
Bulldogs were few in number but good
iin quality. No bitches were shown, and
that magnificent, sound and fine animal.
Commissioner, won from his competitors
with lengths to spare. It was all but a
â welkoyer.
In bull terriers, special attention is due
;to E. S. Heller's Torpedo. She took first
in the open and then captured the tri
color.
Rastus, the winner in dogs, should de
cidedly have given place to Woodcote
Venom. â¢
In wire-haired fox terriers, the well
known Rlley Grannan waÂ« shown in two
classes. He took both first prizes and
the winner's prize.
Smooth-coated fox terrlerÃ, Count Orh
mar took first puppy. He Is a fine young
terrier, but partly spoiled by the prick
ears characteristic of the reefer blood.
In Boston terriers, Bessie won out, and
in Trish terriers Rodger in dogs and Flos
sie II in bitches were winners without
competitors.
One poor black and tan ( terrier was
shown, and was well served with a third
prize.
The ekye terrier aroused considerable
Interest. Bismarck properly won out in
dogs, with Little Billee as reserve. In
bitches. Trilby took the winners' ribbon.
Yorkshire terriers proved full of sur
prises, although but a small class. Little
Joker captured the winners' prize in dogs,
and Gypsy in hitches.
In spitz dogs and bitches, Prince proved
a winner, with Ophelia as reserve.
Japanese spaniels were properly placed,
the dog winner. Mikado, being an excep
tionally fine specimen, though not as
handsome as the winner in bitches. Yum
Yum.
Dapchhunds were a very fair class
Valtiena, the winner in dogs, is a good
type, as Is also they reserve. Waldmann
In bitches, the resefve, Hilda II shwul.l
have won over Valtiena, the winner ITT
pups, prizes were well awarded. Tiny

A Dairy Maids' Convention.
One of the most successful entertain
ments ever given In the city was that
tendered by the young ladies of the
Young People's Alliance of the Twelfth
street Evangelican Lutheran Church
to their friends last evening in Native
Sons' Hall on Mason street. The en-
tertainment assumed the form of a mam
moth social and in character way based
on the usual dairymaid convention. There
were milkmaids galore, dressed in the
short dress and white frock, who dis
pensed their wares among the youth of
the sterner sex, who manifested an insa
tiable thirst for pure milk, principally be
cause a smile accompanied each drink.
After the rendition of â  well arranged
programme dancing was announced.

A Beautiful Girl's Affliction.
Prom the Republican, Versailles, Ind.
The Tuckers of Versailles, Ind., like
all fond parents, are completely wrap-
ped up in their children. Their daugh-
ter Lucy in particular has given
them much concern. She is 15, and
from a strong; healthy girl, three
years ago, had become weak. and kept
falling off in tlesh, until she became a
mere skeleton. She seemed to have no
life at all. Her blo<*l became impure,
I and finally she became the victim of
nervous prostration. Doctors did not
help her. Most of the time she was
confined to bed. was very nervous and
irritable, and seomed on the verge of
St. Vitus' dance.
"One morning," said Mrs. Tucker,
"the doctor told us to give her Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills f<-r Pale People,
Which he brought with him. He said
he was treating a similar case with
these pills and they were curing the
patient. We began giving the pills
and the next day could see a change
for the better. The doctor came and
I
Discussed Their Daughter's Case for Hours.
was surprised to see such an improve-
ment. He told us to keep giving her
the medicine. We gave her one pill af-
ter each meal until eight boxes had j
been used, when she was well. She
has not been sick since, and we have
no fear of the old trouble returning.
We think the cure almost miraculous."

COST OF SCHOOLS
THE COMING YEAR.
THE BOABD OF EDUCATION SUB
MITS ITS ESTIMATE.
A Lively Discussion Over the At
tempted 'Institution of a New
System of Drawing Into
the Department.
Although the meeting of thÂ« Board of
Education last evening was protracted al
most until midnight little or nothing was
accomplished.
The only business of Importance wa3
the presentation of the financial estimate
for operating the department during the
coming year. This estimate, which will
be acted upon at a meeting to be called
for the purpose, next Tuesday evening. Is
as follows:
Teachers' salaries, $1,023,000; Janitors' sala
ries, $Â6,000; office. $7390: shop salaries, $5400:
Board of Examiners. $400; books for indigent
pupils. ${,000; stationery, $7000; drawing paper.
JJikJ'l; furniture ' apparatus. Mission Hish School,
pS.OOO; globes, maps and apparatus, $4000, mak
ing a total of 129,000; ful. wood and coal, $65,000;
Janitors' supplies. $3000; postage, $360; rents,
Â£i?sÂ£' d i oms ' 7 S0O; lights, gas and electric.
li^vi-in bo Â° ks for school library, $7000; printing.
CSb.OOQ; advertisements In the newspapers, $500;
telegraph and telephone expenses, $500; water,
$75; legal expenses, $1000; school census. $6000;
Incidentals, $1500; painting, whitening. con
struction of new roofs, new yards, and general
JSPâ¢! 8 per re PÂ° rt of Inspector of buildings.
$o0.000; new lot. Noe Valley, $15,000. and con
struction of 12-room brick, including building
?.?^JI" room building for the Barrington School.
$30,000; total, $1,296,125.
The estimate for conducting the School
Department under the laws and regula
tions of the new charter is between $995,
000 and $999,000.
This amount, which Is considerably ex
ceeded by the above estimate of the Board
of Education, is not ample to operate the
department, as the last census shows an
increase of 1500 school children for the
coming year, and, at the rate of ?2S for
each pupil, the sum total will greatly ex
ceed the original figure.
After two hours of continued discussion
a decision was at last attained declaring
that the present form of drawing instruc
tion be continued until the Supreme Court
renders a decision as to whether this sys
tem has been legally adopted.
A Concert on the Aeolian.
At Kohler & Chase's Hall this after
noon at 3 o'clock a recital will be given
upon the new and marvelous musical
Instrument known as the aeolian. As
this will mark the first time that the In
strument has been exhibited In thi3
city an unusual public interest is mani
fested to know exactly the nature of It.
During the siege of Paris 150,000 official
dispatches were carried Into the city by

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 20. â Indisposition of
the stock prices to move widely pending the
decisive engagement In West Indian waters
became even more pronounced to-day than
during the early part of the week. To-day the
professional traders were apparently unwilling
to await over night for a turn in the market.
In the last hour they sold the stocks they had
bought in the morning, the process involving
the wiping out of all the early grains except
for a small number of stocks which showed
special elements of strength. The supply of
stocks was small and prices moved up quite
easily on the buying movement, but the de
mand was equally small and the sale of hold
ings Involved the return of the price level al
most exactly to last night's level. There was
the same tendency as has been manifested for
some time past to take up particular stocks or
groups of stocks and advance them inde
pendently of the market. To-day the local
traction companies were selected, and they
â¢were advanced between one and three points.
There was selling for London account
during the morning, but this was offset by
some small outside buying through commis
sion houses.
The money market continued easy in all de
partments, foreshadowing another strong re
turn by the bankers to-morrow. This is an
element of strength so far as it indicates a
relaxation of the withholding of credits. There
was very little movement or activity In the
bond market. Total sales. 625,000.
United States old fours registered declined
M per cent on the bid price. The last sale to
cay of the new fours coupon at 122% showed a
decline of 7 per cent from the last sale on the
preceding day.
Total sales of stocks to-day 283.500 shares.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May Wheat was helped chief
ly by Paris gossip of cold wet weather and
estimated Continental requirements, which
were reported to be 50,000,000 bushels for the
next ten weeks. There was also some gossip
as the likelihood of a prolongation of the
French tariff suppression. Statements on this
point have been conflicting, some apparently be
lieving that an extension to August or Septem
ber 1 Is possible. Liverpool cables were Â»s^
2%d lower. The wet weather in the wheat
growing sections of the United States gave
rise to some apprehension of rust, which is
more destructive to the wheat plant than cinch
i bugs or locusts. A novel feature was intro-
I duced by an attempt of one or two bears to
! do some business in the June delivery at -so
I Teat a discount under May price as to create
! a weak feeling In the latter deliveries. The
price bid for June was $1 11% to begin with,
hut there was none for sale, and then brokers
for the controlling interest took the matter up
and without mincing matters bid Jl 35 for June,
and from that to $1 40 without discovering a
seller. That at once disposed of the little June
by-play May was for sale to a limited ex
! tent at from $1 42 to begin with down to $1 40
and back again to $1 43. The dullness for the
trade was the chief local encouragement to the
: bears. There was a report current that a
French party was trying to buy a large parcel
of cash wheat from Lelter. and this had a
strengthening influence. July wheat started
lie lower to %c higher at Jl 06%01 07%, ad
vanced steadily to $1 09. and closed $1 08%. Sep
tember opened H'SVic. better at 89Â®89%c, rose
Ito 89% c and closed at 89% c. May and June
j closed at $1 45.
< Heavy rains In most of the corn States with
more predicted to-day had a bullish influence on
that cereal. July closed %c higher.
Oats ruled firm with corn, but trade was
light and featureless. July closed %c higher.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 20.â Bradstreet's to-morrow
! will say: The excellent foreign demand at
j good prices for most products of American ag
j riculture constitutes as for some time past the
leading feature of the country's trade. Second
only to this and of necessity forming an im
portant link In the chain of good trade may be
mentioned the almost uniformly good crop situ
ation, furnishing the best evidence that foreign
demands now and In the future will be ade
quately met. The immense balance of trade
already piled up in this country's favor con
stitutes an element of strength which. In Its
effect on the money market, can hardly be ex
aggerated. Naturally dependent upon and mere
ly a phase of the forcing demand is the activ
ity visible In nearly all lines of transportation,
showing that this industry, like others,
is sharing to the full In the preparation of busi
ness having its rise In our heavy export trade.
! An increased willingness to regard the exist
ing war as merely an Incident in the country's
business seems evident in the trade reports re
ceived this week. The volume of bank clear
ings, reports of railroad earnings, the move
ment of prices and the reports received from
the Iron and steel trades all seem to concur in
indicating a maximum volume of business for
the period of the year, with even greater hope
fulness manifested than for some time past
as to a continuance of favorable conditions.
There are, it Is true, some features indicating
that the present trade conditions are not uni
versally favorable. - While the reports as to
the winter and spring wheat crops, both as
regards acreage conditions and prospects, seem
to favor unprecedented yields, advices from
the foreign crops are hardly as favorable, ow
ing to continued wet and cold weather tend
ing to check germination. There seems little
doubt, however, that the acreage In corn will
I be very large this year, and that Its increased
; value as a food product will be more -univer
sally recognized both at home and abroad. In
manufacturing lines the reports from the wool
en goods trades are no more favorable, except
where the stimulus of army orders Imparts ac
tivity to some lines of manufactured products
and raw materials.
Business failures for the week number 211, a
falling off of 39 from last week and compared
with 245 In this week a year ago, 214 In 1896 and
206 in 1895.
Business failures In the Dominion of Canada
aggregate 36 against 25 last week, 21 ' in this
week a year ago, 2S In 1896, and 25 In 1895. '
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. May 20.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
Growing accustomed to war possibilities,
which are mostly far from probabilities of evil
and finding the country moving: along steadily
in its Industries, people are#grasping the idea
that It Is throwing away some months of ac
tive and profitable life to wait until the war
clouds have passed. Western prosperity has
so greatly overbalanced the timidity of Eastern
capital that the actual business done In
creases; railroad earnings promise better for
May than a month ago for April, and pay
ments through clearing-houses for the week in
May show a gain of 36.0 per cent over last
year and 7.5 per cent over 1892, while a month
ago the incn-ase over last year was 33.6 per
cent, and, compared with 1892, there was a
decrease of 7.2 per cent. Several large con
tracts, kept back for some weeks because of
hostilities, have now been placed, and Instead
of works closing or reducing force returns
show the starting of some works long idle, and
Increase of force and of hours at others. Gov
ernment work occupies many establishments,
but it counts for little compared with other
demands. The key of the situation Is the pros
perny of the West, which the altogether un
precedented marketing of breadstUffs has
caused, with the prospect of good crops to
come. These prospects and actual receipts of
wheat, amounting to 5,876,716 bushels for the
week, against 2.439,169 bushels last year, with
advances also in other grain and cattle, have
produced a demand for rails, cars, car ma
terials, agricultural Implements, boots and
shoes and all textile goods which was not
anticipated from Eastern indications. Exports
of wheat do not diminish, but In three weeks,
from Atlantic ports, flour included, have been
7,955.586 bushels, against 4.778.742 bushels last
year, and from Pacific ports 1,738,123 bushels,
against 610.C37 bushels last year. The price of
May wheat fell 4Vi cents on Saturday, rose 7o
to Tuesday and closed 5%c higher for the
week.
In iron, notwithstanding the greatest output
ever known, the demand has caused some ad
vance In Bessemer pig. with only a slight de
cline in the price of Gray forge at Pittaburg,
but full quotations are obtained at Chicago
and Philadelphia. In bars and sheets the
markets are dull, but at the West are strongly
sustained by demands for car building, tin
plate manufacturei and other uses. In plates
and structural forms all the works are fully
employed and generally crowded for months
ahead. One contract for 6000 tons of armor
plate for Great Britain has been taken by
works far Inland with another of smaller
quantity, showing that the export demand, in
spite of higher ocean freights, is not yet ar
rested. Tin Is sustained at 14.50 cby large
consumption and lake copper at 12c In spite
of American production amounting to 2^.909
tons for the month. 10 per cent larger than
last year, with a slight decrease In the pro
duction of foreign mines. . Â .i...
The textile works are doing rather* better
even than the cotton mills In spite of their
over production, for some of large Importance
have recently started again and print cloths
are a sixteenth higher. Numerous woolen
mills have been pushed to new activity by
Government orders, and prices for a few
grades of goods are better with a stronger
tone in the market generally, although some
mills of importance have stopped as their or
ders for the season have run out. while sales
of wool are small, 6 335.900 pounds for the three
weeks past, against "7 963.700 pounds last year,
the manufacturers have ample stocks although
some are obliged by Government orders to seek
in the market grades of wool which they had
not expected to require. _. , â_
Failures for the week have been 250 In the
United States against 268 last year, and 19 In
Canada against 35 last year.
BRADSTREET'S FIXAXCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 20.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review will say: Waiting for a decisive action
between the hostile fleets In the West Indies
has had a tendency to restrict speculation and
keep the public out of the stock market. Lon
don has been a fairly constant seller of stocks
here, and the market at times has appeared
weary and overbought: yet the undertone has
been strong, the bear element cautious, and
the tendency of prices was In the main toward
a higher level. The professionals, which for
the time being control the speculation, are In
fluenced more or by a belief that a vic
tory of any deci'--' character would result In
a sharp advance, and the London selling is un
derstood to proceed from a speculative uneasi
ness due to fears about the genera! state of
European politics and not to a distrust of the
position here or the chances of the United
States In the war. Spain's securities. It may
be observed,, show renewed weakness, the
Spanish fours in London falling from 3'% to j
32^, while the gold premium at Madrid after |
dropping to 74 has risen to 89.

That defendants, and each of

course it has, but now deeply feel
the innocence of the accused must
be made patent to all, and that in
this connection, for the good of the
Church, the interests of Christianity
and the elevation of the Christian
ministry, said E. Francis Brown,
nnw pastor of said Thirty-fourth
Street M. E. Church, must be and
hereby is publicly, and on the
ground hereinbefore set forth,
among others, charged:
1. Of corrupt, negligent and par
tisan administration.
2. Of falsehood and immorality.
3. Of high imprudence and un
ministerial conduct.
And defendants demand that full
inquiry into said charges be made,
and that defendants go hence with
out delay.
Defendants further say they, and
each of them, have endeavored to
lead a consistent Christian life, in
accordance with the spirit, as well
as the letter of the law, and that
no fault with said Xall or his ad

has been in any way found, until

GEORGE C. NALL.
CHARLES ARMSTRONG,
Defendants.
H. D. TALCOTT,
Counsel for Defendants,
&o<j Broadway, Oakland.
Such is the conclusion of the sensa
tional answer filed at the trial to-night at
the Thirty - fourth Street Methodist
Church by the two men who are "being
tried for immorality by an ecclesiastical
board.
Among other things, the answer con
tains the following paragraphs:
"Allege that said George C. Nail has
not been in the home of Hattie F. Long,
in such charges mentioned, since the
summer of A. D. 1596. when, as he was
passing on business, said Hattie P. Long,
from either the steps of her home or near
its front gate, accosted said Nail and
asked him into her home. That said Nail
did not remain but for a few moments;
that the conversation was general; that
no proposal such as is intimated in said
charges was made or thought of; that
the tenor of the remarks or said Hattie
F. Long was such that saia Nail formed
the opinion that said Hattie F. Long was
not discreet, and when he left said house
he felt any free association with said
HatUe F. Long would be unwise, at least.
"That some time thereafter said Hattie
F. Long made statements against said
Nail to the pastor of said church, Key.
G. H. Jones, similar and of the tenor of
the charges now made and hereinbefore
referred to, and that said statements had
been fully investigated by said pastor,
Rev. G. H. Jones, and found to be with
out foundation and false.
"That until au^r 'ii, c September con
ference in 1597 the church was at peace
and the internecine conflicts which had
disgraced it seemed a thing of the past
unaer the kind and able pastorate of Key
G. H. Jones. With the advent of Rev. E.
.brands Brown, in September, 1897, there
came a rapid change, and a small, irre
sponsible faction sprang up, headed by
said Brown and one Mrs. jfanny Arnold
who have fanned the embers of contest
ana brought about a situation that is
most unfortunate in every respect for the
church and the cause of Christianity
"That thereafter said Brown was in
formed that witnesses from his own
church in Winnemucca, Nov., had sever
ally stated he had insulted, by improper
proposals, one of his parishioners there
Mrs. Alfred Cook, and had also in said
btate of Nevada been guilty of similar
Improper conduct.
' "That said Brown stated he wished all
this kept quiet, and that If it was he
would withdraw all charges made That
In pursuance of this plan said Brown pro
cured the attendance at his house of said
N all and his wife and said Armstrong
and his wife, and in their presence with
drew all charges and stated in that con
nection that Mrs. Hattie F. Long had
lied to him, was a bad woman, and that
be (Brown) would not believe her in any
thing, and that if Mrs. Long had not
signed certain papers he would have
read her out of the church.
"That after said charges had been with
drawn as aforesaid, said Nail, in the in
terest of peace and quiet, and wishing to
escape the constant friction and annoy
ance he had been subjected to, tendered
voluntarily and in the best faith his res
ignation as superintendent of the Sunday
school. That thereafter said board al
most unanimously refused to accept said
resignation, and before the adjournment
of said board passed a set of resolutions
without a dissenting voice, of which the
following Is a copy, to wit:
" 'At a regular meeting of the Sunday
school board of the Thirty-fourth street
M. E. Church, held Friday evening, April
1, IS9B, the following resolutions were
passed:
" "Resolved, first. That the Sunday
school board heartily approves of the
manner in which the Sunday school has
been progressing under the leadership of
the present superintendent, George E.
Nail.
" 'Resolved, second. That we feel in
Brother Nail we have ' a competent and
worthy superintendent, and one who has
always been found faithful. at his post of
duty, to which we attribute largely the
success of the school. . . â¢ â  .
â  " 'Resolved, third. That the services of
pis wife, Mrs. S. Nail, have been and are
invaluable to the good of the school.
Resolved, fourth. That these resolu
tions be spread upon the minutes of this
meeting:, and that the secretary be re
quested to forward a copy of the same
to Brother and Sister Nail.
Â_' 'LESTER B. HISCOX. Secretary.'
mat thereafter said Brown procured
the charges herein to be formulated and
filed, not only in fulfillment of his said
scheme and conspiracy, but in fulfillment
of his public threat uttered at said meet
ing of said Sunday school board, that 'if
the -oard did not accept Mr. Nail's resig
nation as Sunday school superintendent
they would be sorry, and it would involve
several of the best families, and the board i
would be greatly surprised at the amount
or nastiness it would bring: un ' "
George Nail, Charles Armstrong and
heir attorney withdrew from the hearing

chairman, Rev. A. T. Needham. "refused

THIRTY THOUSAND ARE EXPECTED.
President Arper's Final Appeal on Behalf of the Inter-County
Tunnel Day.
OAKLAND, May 20.â Nothing has been left undone to Insure the success
of Tunnel Day at the Emeryville track by the merchants and enterprising
citizens of two counties. Not a word has been said against the proposi
tion, and it has been pushed with all the energy possible. It Is expected
that with the small balance in hand enough will be raised from the enor
mous crowd that will attend the last day of the races to build the tunnel
that will open up a new commerce and lead to the development of vast
tracts of valuable land in Contra Costa County.
This morning President George W. Arper of the Merchants' Exchange Is
sued the following address:
SS To the Citizens of Alameda, Contra Costa and San Francisco Counties: Tunnel
55 day at the racetrack, what does it mean to Oakland? It means that the whole city,
rm the.' rich and the poor, the banker and the mechanic, the merchant and the manu
â¢ faeturer, m? and all, can lend a hand and contribute a dollar to complete a great
â¢o commercial highway between two of the best' counties in this State. It means that
Â£â¢ they can do this and at the same time have a delightful half holiday and outing,
oÂ» worth the full face value of the dollar contributed.. It means that by the united
Â£Â° effort of all. who can easily afford it, .the natural barrier, the "everlasting
â¢ 5 hills" which rise up to a height of seven hundred â¢ and fifty feet, separating Ala
23 meda and Contra Costa Counties like a gigantic wall, can be pierced by a.large tun
2* nel. thus breaking the blockade which has existed since time begun to record ms
5, beats upon the pulsations of this old world. It means the development of new com
*s mercial possibilities to the manufacturer and the merchants, â¢ and a new Â» our Â«Â« Â°*
SS pleasure to all who enjoy a delightful ridÂ© into the country. It means tnat every
S3 person who owns a carriole, a buggy, or even a bicycle, can enjoy their dollar over
SS and over again., and each one can say to himself as he passes over the road into
Â£ the beautiful- canyons and fertile valleys beyond. "I helped to build this great
a highway." It means not profit alone to the tradesman of every line, .but a .new
S3 source of pleasure to all who can take a day's outing, . and It Is to be hoped that for
Â£ once Oakland can unite to work. or. more correctly, play for ÃB^ half day n t0 _ h^
c, the good cause along. The tunnel will cost about $25,000, and If 25,000 people will make
58 up their minds to assist the project by contributing one dollar each the object will be
X aCC T^e"road' completed, will be an everlasting source of profit, pleasure and pride
Â£ and will endure as long as the rock-ribbed hills shall stand The money expended in
S? this work will go into the hands of those who need it most, the laborer and his i family
23 and will prove to them a veritable boon In these . times of unusual depression and
Â£â¢ hardship. Who can tell how many heavy hearts will be lightened and how many
â  tear-stained eyes brightened by the employment thus provl^ 7 ââ...â â  Â»* â¢Â«- .
*' So come, each and every- one who can, "put a shoulder to the wheel and have a
SS share in this good work. You will be proud of It when it is done. _
2? We appeal to all to help, for while a few may do something by great- effort the
c. many cÂ£i do much with but little effort. It is hoped that all business houses will find
SS U p^sible to close for a few hours on "Tunnel Day." in order that employer and
2? impWe may have the opportunity of assisting this work If they are so disposed The
Â£* larger your business the more you will be benefited and the better you can afford to
â¢ close. The merchants spoken to are willing to close "if the other fellow will and
"Â° so it has ever been in Oakland that the other fellow will not close if he thinks he can
83 Dick up a few cents from a customer or two who may find his regular trading place
ct closed So here is the difficulty, and to that other fellow we appeal to close and Join
with his competitors for the general good and assist In swelling the road fund which
â¢3 will enable trade to the extent of thousands of dollars annually to flow Into Oak
s' land over an easy grade, into the coffers of the other fellow as well as of all others.
Â£â¦ Times are hard, but strain a point, the money will return a hundred fold. â¢

Here Rev. Mr. Bovard objected to this
mode of testimony, and Mr. Talcott de
clared that he was going to prove that
the pastor was "conspiring, lying and im
moral." He charged Brown with neglect
Df duty, and declared it an outrage that
this affair, two years old. which was set

The Slayer of Charles Gates Is Not

Attorneys Can Save
Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 20.
Joaquln Eslaba's trial was commenced
to-day and the greater part of the morn-
Ing was occupied in argument between
Deputy District Attorney Church and ex-
Judge Frick, who, with W. B. "White,
represented the defendant, as to the
proper procedure of the court. The origi
nal copy of the indictment has been lost,
and although the law declares it must
be read to the Jury, it could not be found,
and Attorney Frick objected to a copy
of it being used. The District Attorney
introduced an affidavit along with the
copy, but the prisoner's counsel demanded
that the letter of' the statute be complied
with, but eventually they were overruled.
For the purpose of obtaining permission
to substitute the copy for the orginal, Mr.
Church placed on the stand Frank D.
Thompson, the official stenographer, Dep
uty County Clerk T. F. Mock and J. P.
Cook, Attorney Brearty, Attorney Church,
E. H. White and William White, for the
purpose of showing that the original in
formation was drawn up, filed with the
County Clerk, served upon the defendant
and subsequently lost.
Judge Ogden decided as follows: "This
paper shall remain and be treated as the
original information. Proof has been of
fered to show that the information was
filed with the County Clerk and served
upon the defendant. This I believe estab
lishes sufficient foundation for prosecu
tion. The case may proceed."
The prisoner's counsel offered several
objections and noted numerous excep
tions, after which the reading of the In
formation proceeded.
Another sensational incident connected
with the trial appeared when the testi
mony of John Metz, taken at the prelim
inary examination was read. Metz was
one of the chief witnesses for the prose
cution, and a week ago, without any ap
parent cause, he swallowed a quantity
of carboiic acid in his rooming house on
Ninth street, then walked a few blocks
and fell dead on a street corner. This
necessitated using his original testimony,
and as it proceeded several objections
were made by Attorney Frick to various
questions and answers.
Eslaba, after his arrest, was found with
his clothes covered with blood, and ad
mitted beating to death Charles Gates, a
tamale man. He declared that the two
were quarreling at the time and that he
was not the sole aggressor.

DYNAMITE
FOUND WHERE
TROOPS PASS
Probing a Mystery at
Emeryville.
A WATCHMAN'S DISCOVERY.
POLICE AND RAILROAD MEN
INVESTIGATING.
Division Superintendent Agler Now
Has the Explosive Found by
Watchman O'Brien.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 20.
The discovery of a stick of dynamite
at the Emeryville depot is causing the
police authorities and the railroad offi
cials much anxiety. The dynamite was
found yesterday morning hidden among
some rubbish in the depot and is now in
the possession of Division Superintendent
Agler.
Much significance is attached to th* dis
covery owing to the fact that nearly
every day trains loaded with troops are
passing through that locality on their
way to the Mole. The dynamite was
found by the watchman when he was
sweeping out the depot.
John O'Brien has been watchman at
the depot for a long time, and part of his
duty consists in sweeping out the waiting
room every morning befora he leaves his
work. As he was doing this yesterday
morning he found a large stick of dyna
mite about eight inches long in one cor
ner covered with a little loose rubbish.
After satisfying himself that it was really
dynamite, lie reported the matter to the
Police Department and the stick or ex
plosive was sent to the Mole, and is now
in the keeping of the division superin
tendent. . . .. .
There Is nothing to show how the dyna
mite came in the depot, and very little
clew exists, so that the hope of finding
the person who placed It there is not
very great The matter is being investi
gated but so far nothing is known of the
manner in which the dynamite got into
PoliceÂ°Offlcer Rand, who Is on duty at
the depot, is of the opinion that the dyna
mite was placed there for the purpose of
being used when some trainload of troops
should stop. No regular train Btops at
the Emeryville depot on its way to the
Mole except trains carrying troops, which
come in a few minutes behind each
other and are brought to a standstill as
they near the Mole, so that one can keep
clear of the other.

LEFT IN A
GREAT HURRY
H. L. Norton Rushes
Away From His Hotel.
HIS WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN.
FRIENDS SAY HE IS ON A BUS-
INESS TRIP.
Off to Close a Deal That May-
Make or Lose Thousands
of Dollars for
Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 20.
About a week ago H. L. Norton, one of
the partners in the management of the
Gallndo Hotel, took his grip and without
saying good-by to his partner or his
friends left for parts not within the
knowledge of any one at this time.
All kinds of rumors have been started,
but although no one, not even his wife,
knows where he is at this time, all as
sert that his sudden departure was per
fectly businesslike and proper.
H. E; AJlen, a real estate dealer, has
long been the bosom friend of Norton.and
knows more of his affairs than* any one
else.
"I must admit that Mr. Norton made a
silly mistake in leaving so hurriedly,"
said Mr. Allen to-night, "but he could
not help it. He should of course have
j told hia friends and those with whom he
j was interested in business, but I was
| partly responsible fnr it. L.ast Friday
; night I received a very important letter
| from Mr. Norton. It concerned a big deal
! in which he was Interested, and made it
| imperative that he leave in fifteen min
| utes for Redding.
"I cannot tell you the nature of the
I deal, but it means thousands to him if he
:is successful and he will lose all if it
. prove a failure. I really could not tell
i where he is at present and could not
i reach him by telegraph, if I desired, as he
!is traveling. That is all I know. Mr.
i Norton did not clear out to avoid any
1 thing, and neither did he go away with
' another woman, as I have heard. His ac
' counts are all clear, but this deal was of
j such great importance that he could not
delay even an hour, and of course his
; friends think his hasty departure very
! funny; but it is all right
"I expect he will be back in a couple of
] weeks, but he has such a deal of travel
ing to do that he may be longer."
Mrs. Norton and her children are still
lat the hotel, but cannot tell where Mr.
Norton is Just at present. "About a week
â  ago." said Mrs. Norton tc-night, "my
: husband received an important letter,
and he rushed in to me and kissed p-"
'â  good-by and said he would be back in
i two weeks. All these stories are very un
: pleasant, and I am sure they have no
foundation. Mr. Norton expected to be
called away in just such a hurry, because
he told me he had a big deal in hand.
"I don't know the nature of it, but he
expects much from it. 1 do not know
where he is now, as I hnvo not heard
from him since he left, but I am sure
he will be back in a couple of weeks."
Mr. Renter, who is the partner of Nor
i ton in the big hotel management, says
! everything is in good shape, althoug his
j partner left at a few minutes' notice. He
pays there may be a change in the man
! agement before Norton comes back, but
says such an event is not at all strange.
In the meantime inventories are being
i taken, a representaive of the Galindo es
i tate is on hand, partnership arrangements
i are somewhat complicated, and new par
ties are seeking the lease of the hotel.
CHINESE-MADE UNIFORMS.
That is What Many of the Volunteers
Will Be Obliged to Wear.
A committee from the Building Trades'
Council is investigating a rumor to the
effect that wholesale tailors who have
received contracts for uniforming the vol
unteers are giving Chinatown the prefer
ence in having the goods made up in
order to get the work done cheaper. At
the last meeting of the council it was re
ported that Messrs. Hoffman, Rothchild
& Co. had received a contract for 30,000
uniforms and that the goods were being
distributed among the Chinese for man
ufacture. Much indignation was ex
pressed over the matter, and it was said
that many of the volunteers would refuse
to wear uniforms made by Chinese.
E. 3. Rothchild, when questioned re
garding the matter, said:
"Yes, we have received a large con
tract from the Government and are hav
ing a portion of the work done in China
town, but not from choice, by any means.
The Chinese never patronize us, and there
is no reason why we should patronize
them. We have simply found it impossi
ble to find enough white people who are
willing to do the work, and if anybody
wants to take any of it out all they have
to do is to come here, and we will .give
them all they can do. so long as they are
willing to take it at a reasonable figure.
When we received the contract we were
visited by union tailors, but they wanted
more to do the work than we were get
ting for It ourselves. We have adver
tised for men and women to take , the
work out, but there were so few who re
sponded that we were forced to send a
portion of it to Chinatown in order to
fulfill the contract. I caw see no reason
why they object to our doing this, as
many other firms have been forced to
take the same course. We will give white
men the preference any time." ::- v ;Â« :

Fetaluma Runaway Accident.
PETALUMA, May 20. â Charles Heidron,

speed. Heidron was thrown from his car
riage, striking on his head on the stone
pavement. He was picked up uneor.^'Mous.
and owing to his advanced age his re
covery is doubtful.

office and $oO,iXK) to the reporters' expenses in
criminal cases.
Adding to this amount $76,000, the late Treas
urer's deficiency in the general fund and the
total of expenses unprovided for will be in
round numbers $168,000.
In addition to this the School Department
shows a shortage of $140,000, to which the
Board of Education will doubtless call attea-
The report is figured up to April 30 of
this year, and the probable deficits in the
\ arious funds are estimated by adding
the estimate for expenditurese for May
and June. Many of the funds show over- i
drafts of considerable size already, to
which must be added various amounts in
unpaid bills, while some axe Just even for
this month and will have to run on credit
for the remainder of the year. In other
funds there will be surpluses, but the
deficit will reach the figure named in
spite of these small measures of assist
ance.
No attempt is made to demonstrate the
cause of the shortage in the School De
partment besides the terse but pointed
suggestion "to which the Board of Edu- I
cation will no doubt call your attention." |
The shortages estimated in the various
funds are as follows:

The $91,850 would have included the mv- i

the total along with the $140,000 of the
School Department, which has outreached j
both the municipal offices and the Treas- |

were as follows:

These surpluses will be used to reduce
the deficit, but there will be much more
to settle even after the surpluses have
been put to that use. As will be noticed,
the largest deficits are over large appro
priations.

BARK LAIRA WRECKED.
Sunk by the Steamer Wakatipu

VANCOUVER, B. C, May 20.â Advices
received by the Australian liner Aorangi,
which left Honolulu on the 11th inst.,
state that the bark Laira has been
wrecked in Dunedin harbor as a result of
a collision with the steamer Wakatipu.
The captain of the latter says the Lalra
was out of her course and that his vessel
struck her almost straight stem on. hit
ting the bark between her fore and main
rigging and causing her to founder. Very
little difficulty is anticipated in raising
the Laira. Her crew was saved by the
steamer. Captain Smith of Wakatipu
states that the Laira's action in running
across his course was due to trouble
aboard, an incipient mutiny being in prog
ress at the time and the men's attention
being distracted. He says he learned this
from some of the crew.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, SATURDAY, MAY 21, IS9B.
NEVILLS ON
THE STAND
The Millionaire Talks of
Mrs. Williams.
CONSPIRACY AND MURDER.
AZHDALRIAN SAID TO BELONG
TO A SECRET SOCIETY.
Startling Testimony of Plots and
Counterplots in the Fresno
Extortion Case.
Captain W. A. Nevills was the central
figure In Judge Joachlmsen's court yes
terday afternoon when he appeared on
the witness stand to testify against My
ron H Azhdaerian. Mrs. Elsie Williams and
Mrs Grace Loose, whom he charges with
extorting $2000 from him on February 25.
last, by threats to expose him to his wife
for having Improper relations with Mrs.
Williams The crowd that filled the court
room expected to hear some -salacious
disclosures, but nothing of the kind oc
curred owing to a timely objection by
the special counsel for the prosecution.
The first witness called was Charles H.
X Smith, agent for an improvement com
pany at Jamestown. He had several busi
ness dealings with Azhdaerian. and In the
early part of February last in conver
sation with Azhdaerian he showed witness
a check signed by Captain Nevills for $200
or $300. Azhdaerian told him that he
expected a lot more money and expected
to be able to go to Europe. He spoke as
if he would soon own the whole of James
town. A motion to strike out this evi
dence was overruled.
Frederick Erickson, a railroad contrac
tor at San Luis Obispo, testified to having
a conversation with Azhdaerian last Sat
urday night in the Orpheum Annex.
Azhdaerian spoke about the case and said
that Billy (meaning the son of the cap
tain) had him arrested for blackmail, and
he was sorry that Billy had gone against
him. He added that if the two ladies
would do as lie said he knew that he
would win out.
Captain Nevills was then called and all
eyes were focused upon him as he took
his seat upon the witness stand. He ap
peared nervous, and answered the first
two or three quescions in an almost in
audible voice. Then he was urged to
speak louder and obeyed. He never once
looked in the direction of the defendants.
He testified to having been sick with
pneumonia in the Palace Hotel on Feb
ruary 25, last. Azhdaerian called upon
him about 9 o'clock that morning and
told him that the women were in the city,
and if he did not give Elsie money she
would sue him for betrayal. If, how
ever he would give him $6000 he would
fix the matter. Witness asked him to go
for Elsie, and in about half an hour she
came She said that she wanted money
and unless he gave her it she would ex
pose him to his wife. He told her to
wait, and sent for Mrs. Warren New
comb. , ,
Mrs Newcomb and Elsie came into his
bedroom and after propping him up in
his bed with pillows he wrote out and
signed a check for $2000. He was trying
to s^n it for $200. Then they went away
and soon afterward Elsie returned with
a young man from the bank who asked
him if he had signed the check, and he
nodded his head and then marked it
In cross-examination he said that he
had known Mrs. Williams for four or five
years. He became acquainted with her
in the Palace Hotel. He knew her here
for two years before she went to his vine
yard in "Fresno. She went there at her
own request, and Mrs. Newcomb accom
panied her. She went in September, ls%
and remained until October, 1897. She had
charge of the house and kept the books
for which he paid her $25 per month and
her board. After some hesitation he ad
mitted that he had a controversy with
her prior to February 25 and wrote her
the following letter:
JAMESTOWN, November 13. 1897.
Pear ElFle: I am just In rooelpt of your
short note informing me that upon reflection
y..u had deckled that any business that was
done must be done through your attorney. WTÂ»y
should you talk to me if you did not mean It;
Tour sister, as I expected, is the cause of thip.
and I want to tell you now, my dear girl,
that not one dollar will I ever pay you through
any attorney as blackmail. I have already
told you that you did not need to get an at
torney and if you wish to follow that you will
find your mistake when it is too late, for I
will fight any attempt r.f that kind to the end.
as it is all out now. Hut when you come to
me and want to do what Is right that is an
other matter. I will be in San Francisco on
Monday all day. Will be in Fresno on the
2Sth, if nothing happens, at the Hughes Hotel,
and if you want to meet me to talk the matter
over all right. Yours, WILL.
"Witness said he wrote that letter be
cause Mrs. Williams was threatening to
expose him to his wife for having illicit
relations with her.
"As a matter of fact, you did have il
licit relations with her?" asked Attorney
Baker.
The question was objected to, and a
long argument followed, the Judge finally
sustaining the objection!
Witness admitted that Mrs. Williams
had threatened to bring suit against him
before February 25. After that date she
had been in his rooms for two days and
nights at a time. He was a frequent vis
itor at McNutt's Hospital to see her, and
Bent her flowers, but denied having her
occasionally on his lap. He paid $217 for
doctor fees, but she promised to repay
him. He had her in the hospital to get
her away from the others, to obtain the
truth from her about the conspiracy 'to
get money out of him and murder him.
Mrs. Warren Newcotnb, who lives on
Powell street, testified that she first knew
Mrs. Williams when she was a stenog
rapher at the Palace Hotel about five
years ago. She afterward came to wit
ness for lessons in French. In September,
18%, witness went with Mrs. Williams to
Fresno on a visit to the La Favorita
ranch. She spoke of numerous visits and |
of letters that had since passed between
them. She could not remember the con- j
tents of the letters, as she always burned
them, but on being prompted she remem
bered that in one in January last Mrs.
Williams had written that Azhdaerian
was to erect several buildings in James
town, and wanted $10,000, which would
bring in a fine income for them, meaning, I
as she supposed, Azhdaerian and Mrs.
Williams.
While Mrs. Williams was in McNutt's
hospital she sent for witness, and told her
that Azhdaerian belonged to a secret so
ciety of Armenians, ana one'aay < aptain
Nevills would be assassinated. She would
be glad to hear of the captain's death, as
she always disliked, him very much. Mrs.
Williams asked her to go to Fresno to
her sister, Mrs. Loose, and get from her
$500 and a package of letters. She went
and got $800, but Mrs. Loose refused to
give her the letters, saying that Azhdae
rian had them, and it was very wrong for
Elsie to ask for them. Elsie seemed to
be going back on Azhdaerian, but after
they had so plotted and schemed against
Captain Nevills it was now too late to
draw back. She referred to the obtain
ing of the check for $2000 on February 25,
Mrs. Williams having told her that she
wanted the money to pay off a mortgage.
The check was written, "Two thousand,"
but Captain Neviils had omitted to put In
one of the ciphers and Mrs. Williams
wrote it in.
The cross-examination of the witness
was deferred till next Thursday after
noon.

THE PRINTERS' STRIKE.
Proprietors Refuse to Consider Offers
of a Compromise.
The strike of the printers. for a shorter
workday seems farther from settlement
Just now than it dtd during the first week.
Theodore Perry, vice-president of the In
ternational Typographical Union, arrived
in this city yesterday from Nashville to
make an investigation, and bring about
an adjustment of difficulties if possible.
He found that over half the proprietors
in the city had agreed, to the new sched
ule, but the balance .held out as strong
as ever, and seemed perfectly satisfied
with the present condition of affairs. "I
visited almost every proprietor in the
city," he said yesterday afternoon, "but
none of them seemed willing for a con
ference. 1 made the offer of a compro
mise on nine hours work for nine hours
pay, but was informed that the day for
this was past. Of course each man spoke
simply as an individual, and said that any
action must come from the executive com
mittee of the Typothotap, but I have ob
tained the same expression from each of
them as individuals. I can see but one
thing for it now. and that is to make a
long and bitter fight. I noticed that the
Typothetae all complained of a slack sea
son, while the nine hour offices are work
ing night and day. This is a favorable
indication, but this Is not a fighj. to be
won in a week or two â It may drag out
Into months or years."

WARNS THE PEOPLE
AGAINST THE CHARTER
Clear and Businesslike Statement of Its
Perils for Practical Men.
John T. Doyle Addresses an Open Letter to
Thomas Magee â Not a Workingman's
Charter,
In the war of words over the proposed charter for the city and county
of San Francisco there arises more and more frequently a sharp note of warn
ing from some thoughtful leader. Clear as a bugle-call, the following open
letter from John T. Doyle to Thomas MaÂ«ee will be heeded by all citizens who
favor a fair and representatii"* city government. Mr. Doyle is well known as
a capable man of affairs, who enjoy? opportunities of taking the broadest view
of transactions as a whole and in tinii .<.LÂ«uuiis, while his experience has
brought him into intimate association with municipal systems, past and present.
He addresses Thomas Magee, who, in common with many business men,
only see certain defects in the existing organic law, and will doubtless appre
ciate formal warning of the perils stored in the new charter. In regard to the
autocratic power lavished on the new Mayor, the litigation and expense which
the new instrument will open up, the complications attending realty trans
actions, the immunity of railroad companies in cases of valuations and assess
ments, the difficulty of amendment â in a word, the dangerous eccentricities of
the document â Mr. Doyle's comment is singularly logical, distinct and convinc
ing. He sums up the situation in the words: "It can do no good to real
workingmen It is merely a concession to political bummers." The
text of the letter follows:
Thomas Magee, Esq.â Dear Sir: The
Interest you take in municipal reform
leads me to address to you some obser
vations on the proposed new charter
for San Francisco. You are advocat
ing its adoption. With great regret I
am forced to disagree with yourself and
other friends, for the following among
other reasons:
A leading objection to the adoption
of the proposed charter is the Inordi
nate and uncontrolled power it gives
to the Mayor. He not only appoints
the members of the Board of Public
Works, Board of Education, Police
Commissioners, Fire Commissioners,
Civil Service Commissioners and Park
Commissioners (to which, I think, there
is no objection), but he has the power
of removing all or any of these offi
cers, at pleasure, by merely commun
icating the fact to the Board of Su
pervisors with his reasons for !t. As
those reasons are not required to sat
isfy any one but himself, it will always
suffice for him to say that he consid
ered that the public Interest required
the change. This power of removal
is not confined to his own appointees,
but extends to all city and county of
ficers, who owe their positions to ap
pointment, as distinguished from elec
tive officers, of whom, besides the
Mayor and Supervisors, there are but
ten, namely: The Clerk, Auditor, Treas
urer, Assessor, Tax Collector, District
Attorney, City Attorney, Coroner, Re
corder and Sheriff. All other princi
pals and subordinates, numbering (in
cluding the Police Department) proba
bly SOu. or more, are subject to instan
taneous removal by the Mayor for any
reason satisfactory to himself. This
is a greater power than has been within
my knowledge confided to any Ameri- :
can citizen iess than the President of j
the United States. Exercised by him
even, it has given rise to the gravest
dissatisfaction and led during the last
twenty-five years to constant agitation
in favor of its curtailment; its inevita
ble tendency to produce corrupt admin
istration is undeniable; successive
Presidents have deplored the evil and
have, by extending the application or
the civil service act of Congress, passed
as a remedy, striven to diminish it.
Nevertheless, though diminished, it still
exists, deplored by all but mere poli
ticians. Many of the States have en
acted laws in the spirit of the act or I
Congress referred to, and earnest re- â 
formers of all parties, the country over, j
are steadily working on that line. The
acceptance of it is universal, except by
political hacks and corruptionlsts. ThÂ»
new charter itself recognizes its impor
tance and provides for a civil service
commission with its examinations,
rules, etc. The cardinal principle of
this reform, briefly stated, is that all
appointments to office shall be based on
merit and capacity, ascertained by open
competitive examination; and no re
movals made, save for proved miscon
duct. Yet in violation of this whole
some rule and of the experience and
judgment of the whole country, here is
a Mayor clothed with power of arbi
trary removal, which destroys the inde
pendence of every executive officer and
makes them all his servants, not those
of the city, beraus^ they owe their daily
bread and that of their family, to his
forbearance and favor. These are pow
ers not for a frail man, but for an an
gel, or a demigod Coupled with the
enlarged power of veto given by this
charter they make the Mayor practi
cally an autocrat, and will probably
cause the political conventions to set on
a nomination for the office a price cor
responding to the power and patronage
conferred on its incumbent. The nom
inee when elected will find himself sub
ject to an amount of political indebt
edness fatal to his independence an<s
usefulness. He will have to pay thesÂ«
debts in offices and preferments and
offices and salaries will be multiplied
accordingly. In several departments
under this charter there is no limit to
the number.
I need only add that there is abso
lutely no check on or punishment for
thÂ» abuse of this enormous power.
There are numerous other faults,
omissions and contradictions in the
proposed enactment which will surely
entail litieration and loss. The provis
ions a.s to revenue and taxation are
specially faulty in this respect, but
they are too technical for popular dis
cussion. Among other omigsiona I miss

PIMPLES
CURED BY
CUTIGURA SOAP
Before using Cuticura Soap, my face and
hands were just as rough as could bo and my
face was all covered with pimples. I was un-
fit to look at, but after using Cdticuba Soap
three weeks, my face was equal to Telvet.
Feb. C, 1898. PAUL DUPKE, Chaler, La.
I suffered with blackheads and pimples for
two or three years until it became chronic. I
tried everything imaginable, but it did me no
good. Cuticura. Soap cured me.
Feb. 20, '98. L. V. GILLIAM, Oak P. 0., Va.
I was troubled for eight years with pimples
on the face. I commenced using Ccticcra

that enactment now in force which re
quires the Mayor to assist in counting
the city's money periodically. 1 do not
suppose that this was designed as an
affront to his Honor, based on a re
cent mishap, but it is open to that con
struction as well as to another equally
objectionable.
You and others interested in real
estate, street improvements, etc.,
would do well to study the provisions
of chapter 3 of artfcle VI, which treats
of opening, straightening, widening
and extending streets, and changing
grades. I made a digest of its curious
provisions for insertion here, but the
exigencies of newspaper space in war
times require its omission. In brief,
such work may be undertaken and or
dered by the Supervisors, when recom
mended by the Board of Public Works,
on petition â  erf the property-holders.
The Supervisors, instead of general
rules for valuation and assessment in
such cases, are to enact special ones
for each particular job. Thus we are
to have "one law for Rome and another
for Athens" â one for cases where
friends are interested, another where
enemies are to be punished. It is diffi
cult to see what honest purpose this
sanction of different rules of valuation
and assessment in each separate case
was intended to serve. Railroad com
panies whose receipts may be largely
increased by the proposed improvement
are adroitly excused from contributing
to the cost, by confining the assessment
to lots, a term which does not include
the sort of property they own. When
a lot is sold to pay the assessment on
it and brings a sum above the amount,
the surplus is not returned to the un
lucky owner whose property was sold
against his will, but is put into a com
mon fund, with that of all other de
faulting owners, and divided among
them proportionately â but in propor
tion to what is not mentioned! The
sale, too, in such cases is not to be
reached by a foreclosure of the lien of
the assessment â the usual and proper
remedyâ but it is expressly directed to
be a sale on execution. The draughts
man does not appear to have known the
difference between them. But every
lawyer will recognize the absurdity of
a sale on exeeutic-n, without any per
sonal judgment to support it. Whose
right, title and interest will the Sheriff
offer for sale and sell? Again petition
ers for an improvement are to deposit
money to secure the expenses incurred
if the project is defeated, yet there is
no provision for applying the deposit
to their payment in such case or for
returning it to the depositors in the
contrary one.
It is forbidden to open in the new
parts of the city any such streets as
| the small intermediate ones in the
Western Addition, so useful to the Fire
Department in getting at the rear of a
fire and extinguishing it without mis
chief incident to a mob of people tramp
ling through halls, parlors and dining
rooms to get at the kitchen, wherein it
usually originates. Owners of prop
erty holding in common cannot even
subdivide It, leaving streets agreed on
by themselves, for in such cases a par
tition map is almost always necessary,
and the County Recorder is forbidden to
file such map, unless it bears the written
; approval of the members of the Board
of Public Works. Without such ap
proval it is even declared to have no
legal validity; not even good as a con
tract. Again, the charter has a pro
vision designed to facilitate the closing
of petty streets and alleys in the bus
iness part of the city, which, by a blun
der of the draughtsman, insures their
perpetuity by requiring the land to be
i twice paid for before they can be
I closed. The provision for an election
| and popular vote on any ordinance
asked for by 15 per cent of- the voters
and also on the grant of certain fran
chises (the referendum), I regard as a
I stupid and mischievous fad; it is bor
j rowed from the Swiss constitution and
experience has proved it to be wholly
unadapted to our people; but if we are
to have enactments by popular votes,
why are grants of railroad franchises
excepted from the rules applied to those
supplying light and water? The latter
accommodate every house on the street
without obstructing it in the least. The
rails, on the contrary, obstruct travel
j on the street and yield profit only to
the railroad companies. Our elections
now occur every two years; their fre
quency is, however, an acknowledged
j evil of great magnitude, not only be
| cause of the loss of time and waste ol
! money entailed, but because they tend
; to breed and support a class of people
who live by politics only. The new
charter simply doubles their number
: without reference to special election?
i liable to fcrcur under it. This is ver>
! bad.
I see that apologists for. this innova
tion in city government, admitting its
many defects, seek votes for it on the
plea that th^se defects can be easily
amended. There is no warrant, how
ever, for this suggestion. The pro
visions for amendment contained in the
instrument itself are in direct conflict
with the constitution, which requires
three-fifths of the votes cast for that
purpose, while the charter only calls
for a majority vote. Amendment will
be anything but easy; the amendment
will have to be proposed, published,
voted on, carried by a three-fifths vote
and then passed by the Legislature.
As this body meets only in alternate
years, delay and inconvenience are un
avoidable. If the financial article leaves
the city's revenues deficient for want
Of penalties for non-payment, as I fear,
the consequences will be very disas
trous.
I have not enumerated half of the ob
jections revealed by a study of this in
strument. Its defects can, I think,
nearly all be traced to the mode in
which it was prepared. The constitu
tion entrusts such a task to a board of
only fifteen freeholders because of the
difficulty of securing agreement among
laree numbers without vicious bar
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 21, 1898.
g-ains and compromises. This Instru
ment was prepared by a body of one
hundred gentlemen selected by his
Honor the Mayor, and though adopted
by the Freeholder convention, after
slight amendments, it remains in its
j cardinal features the work of the May-
I or's original committee. When he
nominated that body he was fresh from
a contest with the Board of Supervis
ors wherein, though backed by the po
lice, and claiming to act under a judg
ment of the Superior Court, his action
was arrested by the decision of the Su
preme Court, and failed of its purpose.
Conscious of the rectitude of his own
intentions, and having no confidence in
the integrity of his late adversaries,
the Mayor became dominated by the
idea of concentrating power in hands
he knew to be honest, and depriving of
it his recent adversaries, of whom he
had formed the contrary opinion. His
committee of one hundred was nat
urally composed of gentlemen holding
similar opinions, and the instrument
resulting from their labors fully re
flects their origin. Under it the Mayor
is practically the autocrat of the city.
It is built upon the fundamental idea
and assumption that a Supervisor is a
born rogue, and that a Mayor, on the
contrary, is sure to be a high-minded,
honorable man, endowed with integ
rity, intelligence, vigilant, discernment,
ability and courage of the highest or
der, incapable of being swayed by any
selfish or improper motive. Hence no
necessity of guarding against abuses or
failure of duty on his part, but the high
est need of depriving thÂ«*Sune'" tr| BorÃof
power to do aught without his con
sent. The concurrence ol fourteen
votes out of eighteen is therefore re
quired to overcome the Mayor's veto,
a provision that plainly intimates the
provision of dishonesty In the Super
visors. I will not say that there are no
grounds for such apprehension, but if
that is the sort of people we are to ex
pect for Supervisors, why do we want
so many as eighteen of them, or why
give them any power beyond what the
constitution itself confers? On the
other hand, I know of no warrant for
expecting such eminent virtue and in-
I tellect in a candidate for the Mayor
] alty. On looking back over the long
list of gentlemen 1 have known in that
position since the days of H. P. Coon,
while I gladly recognize that with few
exceptions they were estimable men, I
fail to find one of them possessed of
such transcendent merits as this new
charter assumes in all, or to whom I
would entrust such enormous powers
as it confers, without at least some
corresponding responsibility. Here
i there is absolutely none. On the other
hand, the number of eccentric provis
ions (some of which have been adverted
i to) lead to the inference of swapping
and bargaining among a number of
persons, each anxious to secure adop
tion of his particular fad: hence come
the referendum, the mandate and the
like.
You support my proposal as to the
Board of Public Works and T will sup
! port ynurs as to the referendum. The
; anxiety to secure adoption for their
plans Is very apparent in the provision
that no one shall work for more than
eight hours a day nor he paid less than
I two dollars for it. This condition is re-
I quired to he inserted in all city mn
| tracts, so that one who cannot earn
; two dollars must not earn anything. It
i practically forbids the employment of
the old and feeble men who now ke^p
our streets so admirably clean, and
! hands over the work to political bum
! mers who have a pull. Tt will probably
! send us back also to the state of filth
; from which the Merchants' Association
delivered us and relegate the poor men
| who now keep the streets Hean to the
'. poorhouse by depriving them of their
I present means of gaining an honorable
I living. His Honor the Mayor owns
i large properties, and many members of
j his committee of one hundred were
I doubtless in the same happy plight.
i These gentlemen in the course of each
year must pay out large sums for just
this rlass of work. Their annual dis
j bursements for it probably amount to
! many thousand dollars; yet it is safe
I to say that not one of them ever in pert -
i ed such a provision in a contract of his
! own or ever instructed an agent to do
j so. Indeed, an agent who did it, unless
I compelled by law, would be pretty sure
lof a hasty leave of absence. What rot
j then, under pretense of honest adminis
j tration and giving the city official serv
ice on business principles, to insert
such a requirement in its charter! It
can do no good to real working men.
because they rarely have the political
i influence needed to secure employment
â  from the public. It is merely a conces
; siun to political bummers. Yours truly,
JOHN T. DOYLE.

GOING OVER OLD SURVEYS.
Senator Gleaves and Party to Investi
gate Alleged Land ifrauds.
Surveyor-General Gleaves and several
surveyors departed yesterday for an ex
tended trip through the southern part
of the State, where he will make investi
gations into the merits of a number of
surveys of public lands that have been
called into question by the reports of 11.
L. Collier, who once held the position of
United States "Examiner of Surveys and
Special Agent of the Interior Department.
Collier has been in a peck of trouble since
he first took office, and it is now believed
that he is out of the department, as an
indefinite leave of absence without pay
generally means this. After his first
break, which resulted in his being ex
cused from duty, he caused himself to
be reinstated by promising to reveal to
the department fraudulent surveys. He
made good his word to the extent that
he sent to his superiors several king re
ports of alleged fraudulent surveys. This
of course tied up all the titles to all of
the lands in question and prevented the
surveyors from getting their pay. Mr.
Gleaves has made a partial investigation,
enough to satisfy himself that the reports
of Collier were wrong, and he so reported
! to the department.
In order to learn all about the surveys,
Mr. Gleaves makes the trip accompan
ied by the surveyors who run the lines
and several of the best surveyors of the
State, who are wholly impartial and who
have nothing at stake in these matters.
The trip will take them to the San Ber
nardino forest reservation, to Inyo Coun
ty near Owens L,ake, to the Randsburg
district and to mountains near Santa
Monica, in all of which places much val
uable land has been under a cloud for a
long time. Aside from the investigations
mentioned the party will correct any sur
veys of the past that are not true.

HUNTINGTON
IN CONTEMPT
He Leaves the State
Suddenly.
IS WANTED AS A WITNESS.
HIS ATTOBNEY ACCUSED OF
SHABP PBACTICE,
The Bailroad Commission May Charge
Both Counsel and Client With
Breaches of Court Dis
cipline.
C. P. Huntington said good-by to San
Francisco on Thursday without the for
mality of first informing the State Board
of Railroad Commissioners of his inten
tion. E. S. Pillsbury. his attorney in the
suit of J. R. Robinsun against the South
ern Pacific Company, now pending before
the Commissioners, also professes that he
was not aware of the magnate's inten
tions until yesterday morning.
The result of Huntington's hurried de
parture is a complication in the proceed
ings before the Commissioners. He had
been summoned as a witness in the Rob
inson suit, but was excused from attend
ance on the board until the question of
jurisdiction had been argued and decided.
The arguments were made on Thursday,
and 10 o'clock yesterday morning was the
hour set for giving the decision. In the
meantime, Huntington quietly folded his
tent and departed beyond the confines of
the State.
When the board met yesterday morning
Chairman L,a Rue announced the decision
that the Commissioners have proper jur
isdiction to hear the Robinson case. He
also said that he had just been informed
that Huntington had left the State in
spite of the fact that he was under orders
from the board to appear and give hia
testimony. He asked Attorney I'illsbury
to explain.
"I have no knowledge of Mr. Hunting
ton's absence from tiie city," said tne
attorney, "but It is quite likely that such
is the case. If he has left the State, I do
not see just how the fact affects this
case, for it has been our intention all
along to test this question of Juilsdietion
in the courts, and until such a test has
been made there is no need of my cli
ent's presence here."
"The question of your intentions does
not enter into this matter," replied L,a
Rue, with some asperity; "and it appears
to me that this board has been made the
victim of sharp practice."
"It was my understanding," said Pills
bury, "that Mr. Huntington was excused
from attendance here until the question
of jurisdiction was linally settled. As
you knew it to be our intention to take
the question into the courts, it follows
that the witness was excused until the
courts had passed on it."
"There was no such understanding," re
plied L.a Rue; "and I repeat that there
peems to have been some charp practice
here."
"I see no occasion to get up a contro
versy here for outside purposes," protest
ed the attorney.
"I resent any such insinuation." put in
Commissioner Hinton, "and 1 will ask you
not to repeat it."
Attorney Monteith. who appeared for
Robinson, called for the reading of the
stenographic report of the previous meet
ings. This developed the fact that at the
mer-ting at which Huntington was ex
cuaed J'rom immediate attendance Attor
ney Pillsbury had, in an aside to the
stenographer, requested that the record
be made to show that Huntington was ex
cused from attendance "until the ques
tion of jurisdiction was finally disposed
of." The stenographer testified that as
Minn as Pillsbury had made this request
he left the room. In order to protect him
self the stenographer had read the entry
made at the request of the attorney to
the Commissioners, and they had ordered
it changed to read "until the question of
Jurisdiction la linally disposed of by the
board." The record shows that this cor
rection was made.
"1 wish to inform the board," said Pills
bury, "that Mr. Huntington declines to
appear here as a witness In the Robinson
case."
"Is he within the reach of the orders of
this board?" asked La Rue.
"I do not know."
"Is he in this State?"
"I do not know."
Attorney Monteith asked that a recess
of an hour be taken in order to afford him
time to prepare an order for the arrest of
Huntington and Pillsbury for contempt.
This was granted. When the board again
convened the order was produced and
read. It set forth the allegation that
Huntington has left the State in direct
violation of the orders of the Commis
sioners, and that he did so by the advice
and with the connivance of his attorney.
E. S. Pillsbury. For these and other rea
sons a request was made for the issuance
of a bench warrant for the arrest of both
men and that they be given an oppor
tunity to show why they should not be
punished for contempt.
On account of some minor errors in the
order as It was presented it was agreed
to postpone action in the matter until
next. Tuesday afternoon, at which time
a new order will be submitted and the
board will decide as to what course it
will pursue. ,
Huntington left this city at 11 o clock
Thursday morning by special train. His
immediate destination Is said to nave
been Portland, Or.
Huntington in a Collision.*
MARYSVII,I.E, May 20.â The engine at
tached to a special train bearing C. P.
Huntington, Julius Kruttschnltt and
party collided with a handcar a few
miles south of this city last night. The
engine was rendered useless for the trip,
so the coaches were attached to the local
train, which hauled them to Red Bluff.
There another engine was procured to
complete the tour of Inspection in the
north.
DEATH FROM MALPRACTICE.
Mrs. Dr. Goodwin of Golden Gate Ay-
enue Accused by a Dying Woman
of a Serious Offense.
The body of Miss Effie Morrison was
brought to the Morgue yesterday for an
investigation, she having died under sus
picious circumstances at the residence of
Mrs. J. H. McCallum, her sister, 273 Thir
teenth street. An autopsy held by Au
topsy Surgeon Gallagher, assisted by Dr.
William D. Clark, disclosed that death
had been caused by a criminal operation.
Dr. Clark denies any complicity in the
crime. He says that he was standing
on the street not far from the McCallum
residence last Tuesday morning, when he
was approached by Mrs. McCallum. who
inquired whether he was a physician. On
his replying in the affirmative she said
that she wished him to attend her sister,
who was dying.
The doctor proceeded to the house,
where he found the deceased lying very
low. She stated to him that Mrs. Dr.
Goodwin of 410 Van Ness avenue had
attended her and had performed a crim
inal operation. The patient died at half
past 5 o'clock yesterday morning. She
was a native of Scotland, 37 years old and
a nurse by occupation.
Coroner Hawkins will hold an inquest
on the remains next week, in order to
determine the identity of the responsible
parties.
A Blacksmith's Cruelty.
Until a few days ago John Murphy, a
blacksmith employed in the Dundon
works, 318 Main street, lived with his
wife and child at 3214 Seventeenth street.
Yesterday he was arrested on complaint
of his wife on charges of failure to pro
vide and battery. Mrs. Murphy while
swearing to the complaint staled that
last Tuesday her husband left the house,
taking all the furniture with him. He re
turned Thursday night and took away
all the provisions and she was compelled
to go to her mother's house at 156 Hickory
avenue while her baby was aick. They
were married in December, 1898.
BOYCOTT THE
"BULLETIN"
Labor Resents Insults to
the Charleston.
A CAUSTIC RESOLUTION.
NO BLAME ATTACHES TO THE
CRUISER'S CONSTRUCTION.
Union Iron Workers Will Ignore the
Sheet That Attempts to Blacken
Home Indus
try.
On the early morning cars going out to
the Union Iron "Works yesterday there
was but one subject of conversation that
received any attention from the mechan
ics ready for their day's work. For the
moment the war was submerged. What
held the minds of the artisans was a
bitter attack on the Charleston in Thurs
day evening* Bulletin.
"Whenever two or three men collected a
general condemnation of the Bulletin ar
ticle was certain of vociferous utterance.
The condemnatory spirit was so strong
that the bacillus of mass meeting was in
the air, and no special call for a general
assemblage was necessary. Hardly had
the hammers begun to fall and the wheels
to spin round when a notice, was posted
on the bulletin boards attached to both
the entrance gates of the plant that there
would be a general mass meeing held to
consider the ".scurrilous article published
in the Bulletin" of the previous evening.
The workmen of the Union Iron Works
considered the Bulletin's article a vilify
ing attack upon them as well as a re
flection upon their workmanship, and
they were ready to resent it. â¢ They did
so by a boycott of the paper.
The mass meeting was called by the
workmen themselves and was held in the
street whicn cuts the iron works in two.
Aroused to a pitch of excitement that
could hardly be restrained, th* men as
sembled as soon as the whistle sounded
the lunch hour. Edward T. Morris was
chosen chairman by acclamation, lie told
them the story of the building of the
Charleston o'er again. He was with the
Charleston on tne trial trip and stayed
on the ship until it was handed over to
the Government at Mare Island. "It was
our first ship," be said, "and wo all took
special pride in making her a great suc
cess. She was accepted by the Govern
ment at an indicated horsepower of 6566,
and her official .speed was 15.2 knots per
hour. The best material and the highest
class of workmanship were put into h< r.
"After having been accepted by the
Government the Charleston made some
notable runs, particularly the chase of the
itata. which was the longest run under a
forced draft ever made by any warship
at that time. At no time was anything
discovered which would in any way re
flect discredit on the builders. The con
densing tubes were made of very thin
brass and ;ire only guaranteed to last four
or live years, and it is now ten years
since the Charleston was turned over to
the Government."
Then followed an excoriation of the ar
ticle in the evening paper, the criticism
evoking a storm of applause for the
speaker and obstreperous censure for the
libelants. Mr. Morris was followed by
D. L. Howard and J. H. Todd. both of
whom spoke in the same strain.
Resolutions were then adopted which in
themselves are the best evidence of the
indignation which caused the mass meet
ing. They read as follows:
We, workmen of the Union Iron
Works, in mass-meeting assembled,
protest against the insults given to
us in the evening Bulletin of May
19, 1898, with reference t-. the cruis
er Charleston and hereafter pledge
ourselves to boycott the Bulletin
until charges have been retracted
and suitable apologies made to us.
The irate and indignant artisans, re
lieved by what they considered a proper
and meritorious action, went their sev
eral ways and soon after the whirring
of wheels and the sputtering of the fires
were heard again.
STABBED IN THE BACK.
Fight Between a Candy Peddler and
a Boy'
J. C. Mitchell Bremer, who has the
privilege of selling candy and peanuts at
the pony and dog show in Central Park,
was arrested yesterday afternoon On a
charge of assault to commit murder.
Bremer has been for some time annoyed
by a crowd of boys known as the Ki^hth
street gang, hikl yesterday afternoon
while he waa counting < â¢ *i t his packages
to be distributed the boys kept calling
out the numbers in a loud voice. This
angered Bremer and he started for the
hoys. He i aught hold of Henry Wehrli, a
boy about 14 years of age. and a fight en
sued. W.-hrli kick-'d Bremer and they
rolled on the floor. Then Bremer grabbed
hold of a knife and plunged It into
Wehrli'a back.
Wehrli was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital where Dr. Fitzgibbon attended to
the wound. The knife penetrated about
an inch and a half, but no serious conse
quences are expected. Wehrli lives at 21
Rausch street.
DEATH OF AN OLD SOLDIER.
Captain John J. Shepheard Dies Only
a Few Hours After Having Re
ceived His Commission.
Captain John J. Shepheard, a member
of George H. Thomas Post, Grand Army
of the Republic, died last Thursday night
at his residence at the Abbotsford House
of pneumonia. The deceased served as a
lieutenant in the California Regiment
! during the Civil War. Up to three years
ago he had been employed for several
years in the Naval Office In the Custom
house in this city, and made many warm
friends.
Immediately upon the declaration of
1 war against Spain by the United States,
j Mr. Shepheard offered his services to the
Government, and received his commission
! as commissary, with the rank of captain.
: last Thursday, only a few hours before
! his death. He was gladdened by this
j mark of appreciation on the part of the
â¢ Government, but a relapse came in the
i evening, and he died in the still watches
lof the night. The deceased leaves a
j widow and two children in this city.
