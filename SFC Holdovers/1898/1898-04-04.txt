Call Office. Rlggs House,
Washington, April 3.
If there is any one in Wash
ington who knows the plans of
the administration.it is the Pres
ident himself, and much doubt is
expressed by his most Intimate
friends as to whether he has yet
made up his mind to send in his
message on Tuesday, Wednesday
or Thursday.
Representative Adams of Pennsyl
vania, who is Acting Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, says it will
be Tuesday; so does General Grosvenor
of Ohio; while another authority as-
F<Â»rts on the word of the President him
that it will be sent on Wednesday.
The Democrats and recalcitrant Re-
I'Ubli^an^. ho are tired of the delay
and eager t<j precipitate action before
Spanish torpedo flotilla can reach
Porto Kico, are to-night trying to cre
he impression that the administra
ii! continue for an indefinite pe
riod its temporizing, vacillating course,
again, there is much talk in hotel
ngst Democrats and Reputt
ki<k-rs of making another at
â¢ to-morrow of passing a Cuban
â  > -ndence resolution.
The army reorganization bill will be
.UJK.en up to-morrow, and they urge that
:â .&â  'rider" be attached to it, recognizing
:Cuban independence and recommending
â¢iirmfed. intervention. Some of the Re
0 .publicans loudly boast of their intention
â to break away from the Speaker, but
:\ria faith is longer put in their preten
sions. In their hotel lobbies confer
'". ehces they are lions, but in the House
tit Representatives they are a flock of
â¢\ controlled by Shepherd Reed. As
to. the nature of President McKlnley's
message, there is Just as much doubt
expressed. No one seems to know
whether he will merely lay the diplo
matic correspondence before Congress
and let them shoulder the responsibility
or whether he will urge Cuban inde
pendence and active intervention,
The San Francisco Call
The Democrats and Republican kick
ers are circulating a report that the
President will ask that Spain be grant
ed a delay of thirty days (till May 1)
when the Cuban Parliament meets.
Whether true or not, their obvious pur
pose is to excite Congress to immediate
action. On the other hand, Congress
man Grosvenor, who is generally re
garded as the President's mouthpiece,
holds out a hope that "his message,
when transmitted, will meet the expec
tations of the American people," who
should be patient and rest confident
that there is a good reason for any de
lay that may ensue. The President's
henchmen are, without making any
positive declarations of his policy, hint
ing that although his plans are al
ready well formed, it is desired by the
President to delay precipitate action
until certain preparations for war are
completed. They mention the fact that
munitions of war purchased in Europe
cannot reach here for a week or two,
and must leave foreign ports before the
neutrality laws intervene, and also in
time to escape Spanish privateers. This
is really one ground for the President's
delay, for whether his message to Con
gress is temporizing or not, he realizes
that Congress will take action which
will precipitate war before we are fully
prepared for it Another reason is un
doubtedly a hope that In the meantime
Spain will accede to our demands.
Senator Perkins of California, usually
very conservative, says that Congress
cannot be restrained longer than Wed
nesday or Thursday.

SPAIN SENDING
A SECOND FLEET
Powerful Ships of War to Join the Tor
pedo Flotilla, and If War Is Declared
Experts Fear They Will Bom
bard Coast Cities.
NEW YORK, April 3.â The
Herald's Washington corres
pondent telegraphs: Spain's for
midable fleet gathered at Cadiz
is on the eve of proceeding to
sea. Its destination is not
known. This, in effect, is the
contents of a cablegram received
at the State Department this
morning from Minister W^od
ford. It was deemed of sufficient
importance by officials of the de
partment to be sent at once to
the Navy Department, where it
was placed in the hands of Com
mander Richardson Clover, Chief
of the Office of Naval Intelli
gence, to whom all matters relat
ing to the Spanish navy are re
ferred. Naturally there is a
great deal of anxious specula
tion in official circles as to the
destination of this second fleet.
Will it be sent to Cuba? Is it going
to Porto Rico? Will it join the torpedo
flotilla at Cape de Verde and convoy it
across the Atlantic? These are some of
the questions which the officials have
been asking themselves during the af
ternoon, and they say to-night
they are as much in the dark concern
ing the destination of the fleet as they
were this morning when the first in
formation of their departure came from
Minister Woodford. There is strong
reason for the desire of the officials to
know whither the tleet is bound, and
the department will depend upon Min
ister Woodford and Lieutenant Dyer,
the latter naval attache at Madrid, to
inform them immediately of the depart
ure of the fleet and its destination, if it
is possible to learn what that is.
The Spanish fleet is said to be su
perior at this time to the flying squad
ron under Commodore Schley's com
mand, and additions which will be
made to it during the week will make it
a force, which combined with the tor
pedo flotilla at Cape de Verde, will rep
resent practically the total available
fleet of Spain. As the flying squadron,
which will be the force probably called
upon to meet this fleet, consists of only
one battleship, one second-class battle
ship, one armored cruiser and two pro
tected cruisers. It Is recognized by the
officials that it will have to he consid
erably strengthened, and additions will
probably be made during the present
week. As the Herald stated, the New
Orleans is one of the ships which will
be placed under Commodore Schley's
command, and the San Francisco will
probably be another. There seems to
be a prevalent belief in naval circles
that the Spanish fleet will make its
first stop at the Canary Islands. This
point places the force but 700 miles from
Spain, 800 miles from Cape de Verde,
UNCLE SAM'S
SHIPS STRIPPED
FOR ACTION
KEY WEST, April 3.â Two
battleships, an armored cruiser,
1 monitor, three protected cruis
ers, two gunboats and six tor
pedo boats comprise the naval
force assembled at this port.
This fleet is practically cleared
for action, and is ready for serv
ce at a moment's notice. Should
3eclaration of war come to-mor
row, I am assured that the fleet
would be under way and heading
for Cuba within ten minutes of
the receipt of the notice, except
for giving the monitor Terror her
fighting garb of gray. Nothing
remains to be done in the way of
preparing for battle. The ships
are all coaled and provisioned,
rheir magazines are full of am
munition, and the vessels them
selves have been stripped of all
woodwork, even to their boats,
rhese, with the exception of life
i>oats, have been towed to the ba
jin at Government Station, *. :ere
they have been moored in flo
tillas. In addition to all, the
irews of the ships of war have
been "keyed to concert pitch," to
use the phrase of an officer from
the flagship, who described to me
the state of discipline which now
prevails in this fleet.
where the flotilla is waiting orders, and
about 2600 miles from Porto Rico,
should the Spanish Government deter
mine to send it there. Some fear is ex
pressed by naval experts that instead
of sending the fleet to Porto Rico and
Cuba for the protection of those islands,
Spain will order them to make an at
tack upon one of the coast cities of the
United States.
In view of the prospect of early hos
tilities, it is not believed at the Navy
Department that Spain will direct the
torpedo boat flotilla at Cape de Verde
to proceed on its way to Porto Rico, but
will take steps looking to its junc
tion with the fleet from Cadiz.

"VICTORY IS WITH US,
FRIENDS OF PEACE."
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, April 3. â Last night the situation looked as black as It
could be, but this evening all is changed. Early this morning Senors
Sagasta, Gullon and Moret received notices to attend at the Palace.
When they reached there a communication of historical importance
was conveyed to them. Two days ago the Spanish Government refused
an armistice. To-day, upon the intercession of the Pope, Spain accepts
an armistice, and this speaks peace. -
There are many events which have occurred on this Palm Sunday
which will make it a day never to be forgotten in the annals of this
country's history, many of which discretion bids me to suppress, but
some of them I can give you, and if you are of diplomatic trend you
will read much good news behind them. First there was a conference
at the Palace, which was all important. Next the visit of the Austrian
Embassador to the United States legation. That visit was of a reassur
ing nature. Next came the prolonged call of Senor Gullon, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, which lasted, I think, a couple of hours. The inevit
able signs are that diplomatic relations are far from being broken off.
Lastly, General Woodford, tired, but triumphant, looked as though say
ing, "Victory is with us. friends of peace."
WASHINGTON, April 3. â Assistant Secretary Day has authorized
an official denial of the statement that the Pope is to mediate between
this country and Spain.
The President's closest friends
insist that they have no definite
idea as to the specific recom
mendations the President will
make. Representative _ Gros

FORMIDABLE SHIPS
IN THE SQUADRON
'â¢ Flyers " Under Command of
Commodore Schley the Best
of Their Kind Afloat,
HAMPTON ROADS, April 3. â The practical completion of a flying
squadron of th? American navy by the assignment of Commodore W.
6. Schley to take charge and his acceptance as marked by his active
operation on Monday last is an epoch-making event in the history of
the present difficulty. No other action of thJs Government since the
Maine disaster so actively determines the fact that actual warfare
has been expected. The North Atlantic squadron is always organized,
and the appointment of Captain Sampson to its command is but the
natural sequence of the retirement of Admiral Slcard from active
duty. So, too, the assignment of ships of war to that squadron or to
the Pacific squadron are but moves toward the mobilization that might
occur at any time.
The fleet practically gathered and altogether proposed that will
bear this euphonious title is one of the most formidable that can be
gathered by any nation. Egotistically in favor of the United States
as this statement may be, facts bear it out.
In average rate of speed, in armored protection, in caliber and
number of guns, and in fighting quality and discipline of men, it can be
proved that the composition of this flying squadron is superior, point
of numbers being equal, to any organization of a like nature that
can be formed by a foreign power.
A summary of the points in comparison with the best boats that
Spain can offer in making up a similar squadron follows:
Name. Tons. Horsepower. Speed Knots.
Brooklyn 9,275 18,000 22
Columbia 6,375 12,000 23
Massachusetts.... 10,288 9,000 17
Minneapolis 7,375 11,000 23%
The four best armored cruisers that Spain has, compared with this
fleet of flyers, would be as follows:
Name. Tons. Horsepower. Speed Knots.
Viseaya 7,000 13,000 20
Infanta Maria 7,000 13,000 20
Pelayo 900 8,000 16
Oquendo 7,000 13,000 20
The total displacement tonnage of the United States flying squadron
!s 43,109 and of the Spanish 30,900. The average horsepower of the
United States vessels is 12,500 and that of the Spanish 11,750. The av
erage rate of speed of the four United States ships is 21% knots per
hour, while the Spanish fleet has to content itself with 19 knots.
It is possible that the battle-ship Massachusetts, being somewhat
slower than the rest of the fleet, will be supplanted by the New York,
and the average of speed and fighting capability of the squadron will
be increased. It must be remembered that the Brooklyn and New York
are two of the finest types of fighting machines in the world, having
their main batteries supplied with rapid-fire guns, with which very
few warships are equipped except in a secondary battery. The great
point of advantage of this fleet, however, is in thickness of armor, cali
ber of guns and the fighting qualities of the men. There are five 13
inch guns on the American flying squadron, while the whole Spanish
navy has not one, and only two 12-inch guns. Of 12-inch guns, our
squadron has four and of 8-inch guns fourteen.
operate with him without making a
declaration of war. The most that can
be said as to this is that Congress will
wait until Wednesday for the message.
The character of the message and
time alone can tell whether Congress
will follow out the President's recom
mendation. There are no visible signs
that Congress is less bellicose to-night
than it was a week ago. It is only
being held in check because the Presi
dent is expected to offer some imme
diate and radical solution of the great
problem.
For some reason not quite clear there
has been a bis? wave of peace talk in
Washington to-day. As one official ex
pressed it, "There is a big international
hen on, which may, after all, hatch out
peace."
Pressed for an explanation, he said
the administration was exoecting much
from the action of the representatives
of the powers in Madrid in pressing
Spain to resume negotiations with the
United States for the purpose of ar
ranging terms of peace for Cubans on
an independent basis. This official
further informed me that a lengthy
cable had gone to Minister Woodford
outlining what the President intended
to say to Congress and leaving it dis
cretionary with him as to the advisa
bility of letting the Madrid authorities
know that the time had now come for
action.
Confronted with these facts showing
that the United States is at last deter
mined to make a final and vigorous
stroke for the independence of Cuba,
Spain will thus, the official thought,
"be in humor to heed the advice of
Great Britain and France and the
financial interests of those countries and
immediately find some way of comply
ing with the demands of the President
for letting go of Cuba.
This, coupled with reports in circula
tion about the influence of the Pope
being exerted in this country to stave
off war, may account for the peace talk
which is heard about Washington to-
night.
It was reported to-night that Arch
bishop Ireland had arrived in Washing
ton and had conveyed to the President
through Senator Elkins a message from j
the Pope. It was said that he spent i
the day with Senator Elkins. The lat- j
ter was with the Preident for quite a '
while this evening, and his presence at i
the White House was regarded by j
some as a confirmation of the rumor
of his conference with Archbishop Ire- !
land. Senator Elkins, however, after !
leaving the White House, indignantly
denied that Archbishop Ireland was in
Washington or that he had gone to the i
White House on any such mission as
Indicated.
The President has had but little tlm<> !
to-day to work upon his message had I
he been prepared to commence It. From

liy special invitation Senator Hoar of
Massachusetts was invited to be pres
ent during the conference.
The presence of Senator Hoar indi
cates conclusively that the President

lecting the phraseology he intends to
employ in his momentous communica
tion to Congress. This senior Senator
from Massachusetts is regarded as the !
most scholarly man in the Senate, and !
he is a past master in the art of using
English language to the very best ad- j
vantage.
This is not the "!rst time he has been

WILL ABANDON
THE BATTLESHIP
Wreck of the Maine to Be Left in Havana
Harbor, and Spaniards Declare They
Will Raise the Vessel to Vindi
cate Their Honor.
NEW YORK, April B.â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: Secretary Long has
finally directed the abandonment
of the wreck of the battleship
Maine. This decision is osten
sibly the result of the recom
mendation of the Chadwick
board of survey, whose report
reached the Navy Department
yesterday afternoon. In reality
it was directed by a desire on the
part of the administration to re
move from the harbor of Havana
the wrecking outfit and divers
sent there to recover valuables
from the Maine, and it was
feared that they would fall into
the hands of Captain-General
Blanco's forces in case of war.
Abandonment of the Maine is a
strong indication of the purpose of the
administration not to arbitrate the
question of the cause of her destruction.
No direct request has come from the
captain looking to this adjustment of
the controversy between the two Gov
ernments, and. In fact, the only answer
which Spain has made to the finding of
the Court of Inquiry has been an eva
sive one, showing she did not consider
there was any action necessary on her
part, as she was not directly charged
v.ith the crime. Since this representa
tion was made, President McKinley has
had no correspondence with Spain, and
unless the Madrid Government comes
forward with a proposition to make
reparation for the loss of the vessel,

MADRID, April â The majority of the newspapers here to-day re
gard war as inevitable; They think General Stewart L Woodford has com
municated a final answer to the Government.
The Liberal says : It is clear that no concession will satisfy the
United States except the independence of Cuba, and we had better im
mediately end the uncertainty. . /
The whole article of the v Liberal on the subject is bellicose in i tone.
The Pais asserts that "great uneasiness prevails at Washington concerning
the attitude of the Southern States in case of war with Spain, and also
because the Spaniards are organizing in Mexico to invade the States from
the Mexican republic" In conclusion the Pais asserts that it will not be
all beer and skittles for the United States. - }
Much excitement was caused to-day by the receipt of a dispatch
saying the passports of the Spanish Minister at Washington will be handed
to him on Tuesday.
the President has determined not to
bring the matter again to the attention
of the Sagasta Ministry. The belief has
existed among administration officials,
however, that Spain, to avaid war on
this incident, may suggest arbitration.
The fact that the Maine is to be aban
doned* is thought to indicate that such
a suggestion will u:t be acceptable to
this Government.
In its report to Secretary Long the
Chadwick board of survey went at some
length into a description of the wreck
and the condition of the ordnance ma
terial and other stores which had been
recovered by the wreckers. The report
conforms with the statements made by
Captain Sigsbee, who informed the de
partment upon his return that the
wreckers had succeeded in raising five
of the six-inch gu -- and smaller guns
which form the secondary battery of
the ship. The wreckers have been un
able to raise the ten-inch guns in the
port and starboard turrets, but to pre
vent the after guns from being of any
use to the Spaniards In case of war
Captain Sigsbee removed the breech
plugs from the weapons, and they can
not therefore be mounted on the forti
fications of Havana, The ten-inch guns
in the starboard turret are under water
and cannot be recovered.
Captain Sigsbee requested thi* the

quantities of dynamite to break the

MADRID BELIEVES WAR
CANNOT BE AVERTED.
Minister Bernabe Cables That Mc-
Kinley Will Be Overruled
by Congress.
MADRID, April 3.â The Spanish
Cabinet has decided that the Spanish
flotilla Is to remain at the Cape de
Verde Islands until further orders.
The flotilla will be joined later by a
squadron composed of the armored
cruiser Emperor Charles "V, of 9235
tons; the cruiser Alfonso XIII, of 5000
tons; the armored cruiser Infanta
Maria Teresa, of 7000 tons, and the ar
the Spanish authorities, objection was
made and it was decided that it would
be impolitic to allow the employment
of explosives. The United States will
thus leave in the harbor of Havana two
formidable ten-inch guns, which, with
their mounts, are worth more than
$100,000. These guns will constitute the
only thing of value left on board the
Maine.
It is the expectation of the authorities
that Spain will direct the removal of
the wreck. I was told at the Spanish
Legation a few days ago that when the
United States formally abandons the
wreck it was the purpose of the Spanish
authorities to raise it for the purpose of
proving to the entire world that the
United States Naval Court of Inquiry
falsely reported when it found the ex
plosion was from the outside. Spain
will do this, he said, at her own ex
pense, and vindicate herself and her
Naval Court of Inquiry-, which found
that the explosion was from the inside.
Under instructions sent by Secretary-
Long to Lieutenant-Commander Rich
ard Wainwright, that officer will at
once take measures for getting the
wrecking outfit and employes of the
wrecking companies out of the harbor.
After they have gone he will return to
the United States on board the light
house tender Mangrove. The Fern will
be the only American vessel left in Ha
vana harbor, and she will be retained
there in order to convey Consul-Gen
eral Lee and other Americans from Ha
vana in case of a declaration of war.
mored cruiser Cristobal Colon, of 6540
tons, which will accompany the tor
pedo flotilla to Cuba.
It has also been decided by the Gov
ernment to send the armored cruisers
Vizcaya and Almirante Oquendo, both
of 7000 tons, back to Havana. They will
receive orders to this effect as soon as
they sight Porto Rico.
A national subscription to strengthen
the Spanish fleet will be organized by
a royal decree, but the decree will not
be published before a declaration of
war has been made.
The Cabinet, which met at 8 o'clock
last night, discussed the situation until
midnight. At the close of the confer
ence it was declared that no official
news had been received at that time
from "Washington, but it was admitted
that the Ministers were filled with
gloomy expressions. Each Minister de
clared that he had received private in
formation confirming the extreme
gravity of the situation.
The Minister for War, Lieutenant-
General Correa, submitted for the ap
proval of the Cabinet elaborate plans
for the organization of the military
forces of the kingdom. The Minister
for the Home Department, Don Ruiz
do Capdepon," in an interview declared
that everything pointed to war. The
Cabinet has examined propositions for
the arming of merchant vessels as
privateers, but it has been decided to
await events before coming to any de
cision on this subject.
Finally a telegram from the Spanish
Minister at vv ashington, Senor Polo

meeting. In which Renor Bernabe said
that President McKinley would be

WHAT MAY BE DONE
THIS WEEK IN SENATE
After a Report Is Made by the
Foreign Relations Committee
There Will Be More Delay.
â â r-in â â  â rrrr~> Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, April 3.
The expectation in the Senate is that the report of the Committee
on Foreign Relations on the Cuban situation will |c made to the Sen
ate not later tha.i Wednesday, and if the report should be made at that
time the probabilities are that it will engage the greater share of the
Senate's time for the remainder of the week. The committee Will
make an effort to secure action upon the resolutions which it will re
port without having them in the debate, but with very little probabil
ity of success. Undoubtedly, a large majority of the members of the
Senate are favorable to some declaration apropos to the Cuban situa
tion, but there is certain to be a difference of opinion on the course to
be pursued and the language to be used, which will be sufficient to pre
vent immediate action except in one contingency. This contingency is
the possibility of an agreement to details between the President and the
committee. If the committee's report should prove to be in accord with
the President's recommendation in all essential particulars, the Senate
likely would adopt the resolutions brought in without debating them.
There is, however, a considerable element in the Senate which is
opposed to war except as a last extremity, and there are several who
think there ought to be delay of at least a week or ten days before ac
tion is taken in Congress in order to insure the safe landing of ships
and war supplies now on their way to this country from Europe. The
Committee on Foreign Relations is not impressed with this line of rea
soning, and the statement is made that Spain is no better prepared for
hostilities than we. The members of the committee do not expect the
President's message before Tuesday, and they are prepared to wait un
til Wednesday. Under great pressure there might be a delay beyond
that time, but a request for delay would cause great restiveness on the
part of the majority of the committee. While desirous of giving the
President all the time he may actually require for the preparation of
his message, they are very impatient of the outside influence which Is
being exerted to hold them in check. This pressure, in the shape of
letters and telegrams throughout the country, is from people who are
opposed to a war policy, and with these the members of the committee
are being flooded.
"The writers," a member of the committee said to-day, "generally
asked to maintain an honorable peace. Of course we all want an honor
able peace, but the time has gone by when it can be secured under exist
ing conditions in Cuba. We cannot allow our conduct to be controlled
by such persons."
â Whfcn the President's message is received it will, on Senator DavlH
motion, be referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations, which will
bring in its report later in the day, or it may not do so until the follow
ing day. So far as it is informed as to the probable line of the Presi
dent's communication, the committee is now prepared to report, but the
members realize that there will be some details of the message that will
require careful consideration and in that event they will give more time
to it than an hour or two on the day of its presentation. Unless there
is a change in the committee's conclusions after the President is heard
from, the resolutions reported will recommend the recognition of inde
pendence, with a declaration for armed intervention to make independ
ence practicable. They will also include the Maine explosion as one of
the causes set forth for this action. The resolution will be accompanied
by the carefully drawn report, written by Senator Davis, Justifying
them.
WOODFORD YET HOPES
WAR MAY BE AVERTED.
Will Continue to Urge at Madrid the
Peace Measures Advanced by
McKinley.
MADRID, April 3, 6p. m.â ln answer
to a request from the Associated Press
General Woodford, the United States
Minister, made the following state
ment:
"The obligatio i of my diplomatic
position absolutely forbid my granting
an interview or giving the slightest in
timation as to the present condition
of the diplomatic negotiations entrust
ed to my care. I came to Spain under
instructions from President McKinley
to secure peace in Cuba, with a per
manent peace between the United
States and Spainâ a peace that should
be built upon bedrock conditions; con
ditions of justice to Cuba, with assured
protection to the great American inter
ests in that island.
"I have labored steadily to obtain this
result. I have never lost my faith, and,
doubtful as conditions may seem to
day I still believe these great and good
purposes of my President may yet be
realized. I shall not rest from my la
bors for a just and honorable peace un
til the guns actually fire, and my faith
Is still strong that war. with all its hor
rors can be averted. Enough blood has
been shed in Cuba already, and I can
not believe the closing hours of the
nineteenth century can be reddened by
a conflict between Spain and the United
"My country asks for conditions that
will make peace, and will have faith
that Spain will do what is necessary to
assure justice in Cuba, and, with jus
tice peace is certain."

Fearful Disaster Due to
a Breaking Levee
in Illinois.
Shaneetown Flooded to a Depth
of From Ten to Twenty Feet
and Houses and Tenants
Are Carried Away.
EVANSVIL.IJC, Ind., April 3.â A mes
sage was received here to-night saying
the town of Shawneetown, 111., was in
undated at 4:40 o'clock this afternoon
by th^ hr'-akinf- of the north levee, and
scores Â«>f people have been drowned,
and others are asking for aid. The wa
ters swept through the place with the
Bpeed of .i race horse, giving the people
little chance to reach places of safety.
Many people hastily mounted to up
per stories of houses, while others en
dpavored to reach high ground out of
the reach of the swirling flood, but the
pwlft waters speedily engulfed many
and swept them away. Small buildings
were carried from their foundations,
with their inmates clinging to roofs.
Thf full oxtent of the disaster has not
been learned, as all communication by
telephone and telegraph has been cut
off.
Shawneetown is seventy-five miles
below Evansville on the Ohio River,
and is situated in a valley of extreme
ly low land, with hills skirting it in
the rear and with a twenty-five foot
levee in front, running from hill to
hill. The town is very much in the po
sition of a fortified city, and when the
levee gave way a mile above the town,
under pressure of a very high river, the
water shot through a twenty-foot
opening and struck th* 1 place like a
hurricane, sweeping everything before
it.
Houses %ver<* overturned and tossed
about like boxes. The people had no
warning of the break, and for that rea
son so many were caught. Those at
home sought refuge in second stories
and or. housetops. Those in the streets
were carried before the avalanche of
r and probably a majority were
noil.
A citizen came from the place by
?kiff to telephone several miles away,
ii d asked aid from Evansville. He
said more than 200 people were drowned
and he had reason to believe the num
ber would reach 500 or probably 1000.
The water stands twenty feet deep all
iver town and total darkness envelopes
:he desolate scene. Consequently it was
impossible for him to have anything
ike definite information. The man
quickly left the phone, and no commu
nication has since been had with the
place.
All the telephone and telegraph wires
ire down and outside communication
appears to be impossible. At 10 o'clock
to-night two steamboats and a couple
if tugs started f<>r Phawneetown under
a full head of steam, and it is expected
pome of them will arrive there by 2
o'clock In the morning. They carried
large supplies of food and blankets,
quickly collected by the city officials.

loss of life at Shawneetown was at that
hour 200. Mount Vernon is but thirty
miles from Shawneetown, and the in
formation upon which the estimate is
based is believed, to be reliable. The
operator stated that the company's
wires to the stricken city failed soon
after 4 o'clock this afternoon. At that
hour it was known that the dam was
giving away, but it was not thought
that it would go to pieces quickly
enough to cause the loss of life.
By 8 o'clock It was known in Mount
Vernon that many people had been
drowned, the estimate then being one
hundred. A relief boat bearing- food,
blankets and surgeons was started
down the river and was expected to
reach Shawneetown before morning.
Gradually the reports of loss of life in
creased, the estimates and stories eom
itilt from various points near the scene
of the flood, showing clearly that the
disaster was far more disastrous than
was at first believed.
People at Mount Vernon and sur
rounding towns besieged the telegraph
offices, frantically asking for tidings
from friends and relatives in the flood
ed town. No attempt at an accurate
list of the victims is possible, however,
and the crowds stood all night before
the bulletin boards on which were post
ed the meager reports being received.
MOUNT VERNON, Ind.. April 3.â
The manager of the telephone ex
change at Shawneetown, 111., at 8
o'clock to-night gave Mount Vernon its
first definite news of the big inunda
tion at the little city down the Ohio
River. This is what he said:
"Shawneetown was inundated by a
break in the levee a mile and a half
above the city at 4:30 o'clock this after
noon. Three hundred persons are be
lieved to have been drowned. All frame
buildings were swept away, and brick
and stone houses and blocks are under
water.
"The survivors are in great need of
help, and have sent me to ask neigh
boring towns for immediate assistance.
"I am four miles from Shawneetown
now. I escaped and made my way here
with a portable telephone. I climbed
up the telephone post and made con
nection and that's how you are getting
the news.
"The flood came with a terrific dash
and roar. Of course the people had
been watching for any break in the
levee, but they thought they were safe.
The water came in an enormous wave,
with foam on top. At first a muffled
roar was heard. It grew louder and
louder, and before all the people in
Shawneetown who had divined what
was coming could rush to the hills for
safety it overtook the town.
"It is estimated that 300 were
drowned outright.
"All frame buildings left their foun
dations and were carried away on the
flood like straws, but brick and stone
houses remained on their foundations,
although they were more or less
wrecked They were under water
when I left. Most of the people fled
to the hills back of the city, and saved
their lives, but their possessions are
gone. They are in despair and frantic
with terror and grief. Send all the
help you can."
Mount Vernon people were advised at
once of the news from Shawneetown
and began immediate preparations for
relief. Evansville and other near-by
cities had been given the same tele
phone message by turns, and were
ready to co-operate In a scheme for
effective aid.
Mount Vernon agreed to furnish three
ferryboats capable of carrying ten
wagonloads each, and besides, all river
skiffs were pressed into service.
These craft were loaded partly here
and partly in Evansville, and in tow
of two steamers furnished at Evans
ville, proceeded to the city of death as
quickly as possible.
People in Mount Vernon expect to
hear from the rescuers at daybreak,
and nearly every one in this city is sit
ting up awaiting more complete news.
The city is profoundly shocked by the
disaster.
When the flood overtook Shawnee
town, if the weather was like it was
here, twenty-five miles away, the peo
ple were enjoying the peace of a per
fect spring day. The air was warm, a
light breeze was blowing, and people
were walking about the streets enjoy
ing the Sunday quiet.
It was in the midst of peaceful scenes
that the monster wave came tearing
down upon its unsuspecting victims,
hurling them to death.
In the twinkling of an eye quiet
streets were turned into beds for a roar
ing torrent, and the strollers of Sunday
afternoon, pausing to listen to the omi
nous roar, were carried into eternity ere
they could reach places of safety.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 3.âShawnee
town, 111., has a -lulation of about
3000 inhabitants and is situated on the
west bank of the Ohio River. The
Btreets are parallel with the river, the
principal business street being but' two
blocks distant from the water. The
level of the river is about fifteen feet
above the city and the levee bank is
about twenty feet thick. Situated on
this bank and level with the river is the
Riverside Hotel, a large four-story
building, built by Henry Docher. The
hotel is generally occupied fully all the
year round, being not only a transient
hostelry, but families also reside there.
It is feared the hotel has been washed
away. ____^________

Powers Bring Pressure

If There Be Mediation, It Must
Begin With the Madrid
Government.
United States Firm in the Declaration
That It Will Brook No
Interference.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 3.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: To
all suggestions for mediation the au
thorities in Washington are replying
that Madrid is the place for work of
this kind at the present time. France
and England are making one mighty
effort to induce Spain to concede the
independence of Cuba, If war between
the United States and Spain can be
averted at all through the medium of
diplomacy, the first steps in that di
rection will have to be taken from
Madrid.
Representatives of foreign powers in
this country who have sounded the ad-
ministration on the subject have dis
covered that mediation is out of the
question as far as the United States is
concerned, hence the great activity
among the powers at Madrid. It is
known that England and France are
putting the screws on Spain in Madrid
to-day, but the result, if any, has not
yet come to the knowledge of diplomats
in Washington.
One important deduction that the
American authorities have made from
the negotiations among European pow
ers which have transpired thus far is
that in case the worst happens and we
are forced to intervene to bring about
the independence of Cuba, there will be
no danger of foreign Intervention to
prevent it. Whether continued nego
tiations at Madrid will result in Spain
yielding to the demands of the United
States remains to be seen.
It is violating no confidence to say
that the President and some of his ad
visers are even more hopeful that the
Sagasta Ministry will make further
representations to the United States in
the direction of ending the war in Cuba
and giving the insurgents their- inde
pendence as the result of the tremen
dous pressure which they know is being
brought to bear by the Governments
and financial interests of Europe.
This hope, however, is not shared to
any extent by diplomatic and other
public men here. On the contraryt
most of the foreign Ministers have ad
vised their Governments that they re
gard war as inevitable.

The damage done by the floods can
not be estimated. In many portions of

Noumea itself was for a time about
three inches under water, and the
floods were very extensive and ruinous
in other portions of the islands. Resi
dents suffered heavy losses, but as far
as was known no lives were sacrificed.
The Hawaiian capital was flooded on
March 24 and considerable damage was
done, hundreds losing their homes and
their all. The flood was the greatest

HÂ«s Thoroughly Identified Herself
With the War Party at
Madrid.
Special Dispatch to The Cfc.ll.
MADRID, via Bayonne, France, April
1. â Despite the efforts of the press to
work up patriotic enthusiasm, the
public seem indifferent to the situa
tion. Except among officials it is rare
ly discussed. The people are chiefly in
terested in the result of a big lottery
just announced and in the preparations
for an extraordinary bull-fight on
Easter Sunday, at which celebration
toreadors from all parts of Spain will
perform. The people do not wish war;
rather they are indifferent, as they
always have one in progress somewhere
and do not regard war with the United
States as different from the others.
The feeling that exists here exists
also throughout the provinces. Poult
ney Bigelow writes from Barcelona
that with two other Americans he has
just completed a bicycle tour from San
Sebastian through Madrid to Alicante
in Valencia, clear across tho wildest
part of the peninsula, and he says:
"I found less Jingoism In the whole
trip than in one block of the New York
Bowery."
The Queen Regent Is taking a very
active part in the negotiations, and has
thoroughly identified herself with the
war section of the Cabinet. Her at
titude is much approved by the officials
in the army and has undoubtedly
strengthened the dynasty for the time
being. Her Majesty is reported to have
told Senor Segasta:
"I received from my husband a heri
tage for our son and will never agree
to have that heritage curtailed."
Senor Sagasta said to a friend after
Thursday's council at the palace:
"We went inâ seven menâ to see one
woman, and emeregd seven women,
leaving the men inside," meaning that
they went in disposed to yield, but that
the Queen's patriotism and firmness in
spired them.
At the same time it Is reported that
the Queen Regent is doing much to
avoid a rupture. The activity of Count
Dubosky, the Austrian Embassador,
In this direction within the last two
days is said to be inspired from the
palace. He has visited United States
Minister Woodford and a prominent
member of the Cabinet.
Apparently there is a pessimistic
feeling at the United States legation
to-day. __^_________^Â»Â»

DAY OF QUIET
AT MADRID
Republican Mass-Meeting
Proves Almost a
Fizzle.
Delegation Visits the Premier's
Quarters to Present
Grievances.
Told That the Cortes Will Con
sider the Reforms the People
Demand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, April 3.â There was little
excitement In Madrid this afternoon,
owing to the fact that there was no
bull-flght to-day. Extra precautions
were taken to prevent disorder at the
republican mass-meeting this after
noon. The number of guards at the
United States legation was Increased.
The object of the demonstration was
to demand a revision of the sentences
imposed upon political and other of
fenders, to protest against the tortur
ing of anarchists in the prison fortress
of Montjuich, Barcelona; to demand
free import of wheat and to demand
universal conscription without the re
demption of rich conscripts.
The demonstration, contrary to ex
pectation, turned out to be a very
quiet and informal affair. In fact it
may be termed a "fizzle." There were
no banners displayed, and only about
3000 people marched to the presidency
and remained in the street while the
deputation was conducted to the of
fice of Senor Sagasta, where its mem
bers were politely received by some of
the members of the Cabinet in the ab
sence of the Premier.
Senors Viendo and Dorendo, former
municipal councilors of Madrid, spoke
for five minutes, referring to the ob
jects of the demonstration, namely a
revision of sentence, the free Import of
wheat and universal conscription
without the redemption of rich con
scripts. No mention was made of the
alleged torturing of anarchist prisoners
in the prisons of the fortress of Mont
juich, Barcelona, although it was at
first understood that this was to be the
main representation to be made to the
Premier. The demands of the people
who took part in the demonstration
were embodied in a manifesto, which
was handed to the Minister of the In
terior, Senor Capdepon-. who replied,
saying he regretted that the indisposi
tion of Senor Sagasta made it neces
sary for him to receive the deputation
in the Premier's place. The Spanish
people, Senor Capdepon added, were
worthy of the liberty they enjoyed, and
the Government would always keep
abreast of public opinion. But the
manifesto was too serious to be im
mediately replied to. It would com
mand serious attention and would be
referred to the Cortes.
The Minister then thanked the depu
tation for the orderly behavior of
those who took part in the movement.
Senor Dorendo answered that the
deputation placed confidence in the
pood-will of the Government. The
deputation withdrew. Then the crowd
outside the presidency was Inclined to
linger and discuss the matter which
brought the people there. But the
Civil Governor mingled with the peo
ple, urging them to disperse. He said:
"Go home, my children. Everything
will be attended to."
The crowds then good-naturedly
scattered. ________________ __

HAVANA, via Key West, April 3.â
War is expected by all here now â ex
pected by some hopefully, by many
fearfully. It is in the air. There is a
new and sprightly note in the music
to which the soldiers of Spain march
this morning. Their step has a new

guns, to which no one gave a second
thought two days ago, have caused in
quiring words and glances for the last
forty-three hours.
The palace expects war. The censor
told me last night it was inevitable
now, the United States having forced
Spain to the wall, and Spain, with her
back to it, would give the enemy his
fill of fighting. The censor's idea of it
is that of the Spanish, military and
civil.
The wires flashed to Madrid last
evening the ne\vs that three American
vessels had been seen off Havana har
bor, and though Americans knew the
story was due to a smoke seen afar,
many ki the city accepted it as an evi
dence of the approach of a squadron
from Key West, which was lying with
in striking distance of Havana wait
ing orders to blockade the port.
This news lent new interest to the
movements of the Vizcaya and Oquen

o'clock, it is believed for Porto Rico
to join the torpedo squadron. In
quiries at the palace regarding the
object in sending the twin cruisers to
sea at this time met with uplifted
brows and a polite refusal to reply.
Thousands who thronged the piers
when the cruisers left port and who
answered the cheers of the soldiers
topping the battlements of Morro and
Cabanas thought the ships were going
to meet the United States fleet in the
open, and the idea fired their patriotic
hearts and opened their throats till the

weary months of waiting.
The guard around the American Con*
sulate was again doubled last evening,
and General Lee is assured by Captain-
General Blanco that every possible ef
fort will be made to protect him and
other Americans. Few Americans are
here, indeed only a handful besides the
correspondents and those in business.
The last of curious and sight-seeing
visitors left on the Mascotte to-day,
and would have gone yesterday had
chance offered.
Consul-General Lee now knows the
full details of the situation, but seems
not to expect hostilities on Monday or
Tuesday, as many do, thinking it more
probable that no encounter will occur
before April 15. British Mr. Gullon haa
told his friends that he does not think
actual hostilities will occur at all.
General i-^ee goes to and from his of
fice as usual. He feels the full grav
ity of the situation, but is calm and
cheerful as of old, believing that if ne
gotiations are suspended suddenly be
tween Washington and Madrid he and
other Americans remaining will go
away in safety under the protection, of
the Spanish authorities.
The Fern, with the Stars and Stripes
above her, lies in the harbor â a ship of
refuge in case of extremity. I am told
that Captain Cowles received three dis
patches last night, but it is not thought
the orders were in reference to the im
mediate departure of the ship with
General Lee and all Americans, but
rather as to procedure in case the
ship's departure becomes suddenly ne
cessary. To inquiring Americans Gen
eral Lee has said that Havana is no
place for pleasure seekers and men
whose duty does not keep them here,
and his advice and regard for their im
mediate bodily welfare swelled the
Mascotte's passenger list to-day.
General Lee had an informal con
ference with British Consul Gullon
and came to an understanding regard
ing the Englishman's course in case a
demonstration against Americans
reached open violence and threatened
a massacre.

(i FINE BUSINESS.
GENERAL trade conditions throughout the
United States are about as they were a week
ago. The bond and stock market in Wall
street continues more or less unsettled in sympathy
with the constantly changing aspects of the political
situation, and the public as a rule have left the mar
ket for speculators to play with. Interest rates there
have naturally increased under the pressure, but the
continued imports of gold, already mentioned, tend
to keep the money market free from stringency, hence
there is no anxiety. It is well known that there is still
$30,000,000 in New York and $12,500,000 in outside
banks, against which gold is likely to be imported,
so the balance of trade is still enormously in favor of
this country. As far as money is concerned this na
tion was never so well prepared for war as at present.
We have more actual coin in sight and in our vaults
than Spain can possibly raise in the European capi
tals, even if the European financiers were disposed
to accommodate her. winch, with the possible ex
ception of France, they are unwilling to do.
The merchandising of the country proceeds with
serenity. There is but little decrease in the distribut
ing trade, and that only in one or two sections. The
failures Tast week were 220. against 260 during the
same week last year. The bank clearings were 29.3
per cent better. The failure records bear witness to
the satisfactory conditions ruling in commercial lines
this year in a total for the quarter just closed of 3515
embarrassments, involving liabilities of $36,198,000,
: a decrease in number from a year ago of 13 per cent,
and from two years ago of 22 per cent, while as re
gards liabilities there is a falling off from last year of
30 per cent, and as compared with 1896 of over 42
per cent.
The price record continues favorable. The depre
'.:â â ' ciations for the week were confined to oats, flour,
.:'â  -prints and hide?, while the advances included wheat,
v com, lard, coffee, cotton and sugar. Most of the
â -*â â ".. leading staples showed no change during the week.
:. Hence it will be seen that the general commerce of
â  > the country is proceeding as if there were no such
â¢' â¢.'â .thing as war.
â¢ : ; . There is nothing especially new in local trade,
f:. There seldom is at this season of the year. The con
; dition of the crops is now pretty definitely deter
mined, and it is generally admitted by all interests
; . that the yield of grain will be moderate at best and
';. that of hay light. High prices will probably rule for
this latter staple during 1898 and at least the early part
of 1809, unless all present signs prove illusive. The
state of the fruit crop is less defined, but nobody ex
â¢ pects a crop of apricots this year, and a small yield
of peaches is equally probable; but a fair crop of
prunes and other small fruits will doubtless be har
vested and sold at good prices owing to the deficiency
-.in the two other fruits. Wheat and barley have been
;â¢'â .' irregular owing to the uncertainty of the weather, but
:!â¢; there was quite an advance in both during the week,
:. â¢â â  and oats and several kinds of feedstuffs went up in
v sympathy. The other staples have been less satis
;'v '.factory from the quotation standpoint. New wool is
.'â¢./.coming in, but it is neglected and no quotations for it
=:: : ; jjave thus far been established. Hides and leather
:â¢.-â¢ .rute quiet and unchanged in price. Beef has advanced
/. a fraction, but pork has declined owing to free re
. . teipts. The East is at last waking up to the fact that
. : .qut fruit crop has been severely damaged by frost,
'and more tone to dried fruits in New York is re
/ 'ported in consequence. The dried fruit market bids
: : fair to be a pretty good one this year, which will be
â va blessing to the orchard interest. Already local and
' country holders of apricots are refusing to sell at
â¢ . advanced bids from buyers, and peaches and prunes
V*re reported in better request at firmer prices.
Merchandise is meeting with an average demand and
â there are no violent fluctuations in anything to report.
Money continues easy and in ample supply for sol
.;: vent borrowers at the usual rates of interest. The
â â¢'ilocal bank clearings showed a marked gain in March
â¢..â¢over the same month in 1897, which indicates a bet
ter volume of trade this year. War talk has thus far
not affected local trade, except in those lines which
are directly dependent on the East, such as wool,
hides, etc., but actual hostilities would doubtless
produce a marked change, one way or the other, in
almost evcrj- branch of trade. Tin ..e who like to
observe commercial conditions will watch with inter
est the international situation from now on. It is to
be hoped that they will not be disappointed in the
outcome, nor is it likely that they will be.
When next the Vizcaya shall visit New York the
populace will not be rushing down to the water front
to get a look at it. and the saluting guns will be apt
to Be loaded with something solid.
"Under certain conditions," explains a London cor
respondent. "Spain would withdraw from Cuba."
There are reasons for believing that this country will
undertake to supply the conditions.
THE SOONER BEGUN THE SOONER
ENDED.
|~~X ISPATCHES of yesterday announcing that
j ) the President's message to Congress on the
crisis with Spain, which was expected to be
sent in to-day, may be postponed until to-morrow
and possibly until Wednesday were far froi.i satisfac
tory to the people. At this juncture delay increases
rather than quiets popular excitement. It serves no
good purpose. It cannot aid the cause of peace. It
simply gives more time for the Spanish torpedo
flotilla to make its way across the sea to a point of
hostile vantage against our coasts.
Ever since the report of the Naval Board of In
quiry removed all doubt that the Maine was de
stroyed by a Spanish mine the nation has expected
of the President not only firmness of decision, but
promptness of action. It received with indignation
every rumor or suggestion that the treacherous mur
der of American seamen would be treated by diplo
macy as a minor incident in our dealings with the
Spanish, and that the issue of Cuban relief would be
given precedence over it. The cry of the people was
for that justice which takes the form of vengeance,
and had the report of the naval board been followed
by an immediate declaration of war the armed
strength of the republic would have responded at
once and the civilized world would have approved.
As if the destruction of the Maine were not enough,
the Spanish Government immediately set about giv
ing our Government another cause for war. This
was done by the dispatch of the flotilla of torpedo
boats to Havana. Under the circumstances it was
clear to all that this action was a war measure.
Spain designed it as a means of striking a blow at
the United States. We have stood comparatively in
active and permitted that weapon to be drawn and
aimed at our heads. Had it not been for the accident
of a storm at sea the flotilla would even now be in
easy reach of Havana, if not actually within the port.
We have delayed long enough. Unless Spain at once
yields to our demands and makes every reparation
possible for the murder of our seamen there should be
war.
Moreover, it should be made clear to all the peo
ples of the earth that the war when it comes is made
by the American nation, not for the relief of Cuba,
however desirable that may be, but for vengeance on
the assassins that wrecked the Maine. The moral of
the battle should be made plain that the republic will
protect its flag and its seamen in every sea under the
whole heavens. That lesson should be made so im
pressive and so terrible that no such offense will ever
be committed again so long as America remains
powerful and nations fear her wrath.
It would be, in fact, an anti-climax to turn aside
from the high outrage of the fiends that exploded the
mine under the Maine to consider the cause of the
people of Cuba made destitute by war. We cannot as
a nation right the wrongs of suffering humanity.
There has been intolerable cruelty in Armenia, there
is spoliation in China, and doubtless there have been
many foul offenses committed against humanity in
the incessant revolutionary struggles going on in the
South and Central American states. We cannot right
all these evils. We cannot protect everybody. We
can. however, protect our own wherever they may be,
and to do that is our duty no matter what the cost.
Unless Spain makes a complete surrender war must
come, and it should be waged with such effectiveness
as to make it as short as terrible. It would be a
false economy to begin with half measures. The
fighting should be forced from the start. Spain
should have no moment of respite from the time war
is declared until it is ended by her complete subjec
tion. The whole struggle should be finished in time
for our harvests to be gathered in peace and shipped
across a sea untormented by the Spanish flag.
THE FOLSOM BOULEVARD BONDS.
IT has been arranged in Sacramento to make up
an agreed case involving the question of the valid
ity of the recent issue of bonds for the construc
tion of Folsom boulevard and submit it to the Su
preme Court for decision. This is a wise and timely
thing to do. At present the bonds cannot be sold
because it is seriously doubted if they have been
issued in accordance with law. That doubt must be
removed before any step can be taken in the work of
construction, and the only way to remove it is that
which has been arranged.
When differences of opinion as to questions of law
exist among high legal authorities, as in this case,
no power less than that of the Supreme Court can de
cide them. The Call, therefore, will not undertake to
argue the question involved in the controversy. It
is sufficient to know that while the issue of the bonds
was regarded as in every way legal by the law officers
of the State, other lawyers equally eminent advised
their clients not to purchase them. The construction
of the boulevard is blocked and the improvement for
which the people voted by an overwhelming majority
is delayed because of this legal doubt.
On all questions affecting public improvements
and on all issues that have been submitted to the
popular vote our courts should give a liberal con
struction to the constitution and the statutes. That
has been the course of the Supreme Court of
the United States in construing federal laws.
Strict constructionists who would impose the
restrictions of excessive technicalities upon the
course of growth and improvement of the na
tion or any of its communities have never
had as much influence in determining the decisions
of the Supreme Court at Washington as have those
Judges who, like Marshall, studied the law in its
broadest aspects and gave the republic scope in which
to develop from a Federal to a National Govern
ment.
It is but a fair expectation that our Supreme Court
will follow in this respect the example set at Wash
ington. A mere technical defect in the issue should
not be permitted to invalidate bonds which in every
important respect were issued as the law required. .
The Folsom boulevard is a much needed public
improvement. The people of Sacramento have by
their votes shown a desire for it and a willingness to
pay for the construction. It will cost them a great
deal of money to hold a new election if the present
bonds are invalidated. There will be also a loss of
much time in the completion of the work. The case
is one that should be decided in accordance with the
spirit rather than the letter of the law, and the way
made clear for the counties of California to go for
ward with the work of improvement.
The arrest of a fortune teller for theft is a poor ad
vertisement of her business. A gift of second sight
which cannot spy a policeman around the corner is
small capital for one in the soothsaying line.
It can hardly be said that a city which has contained

THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1898.
BY the vote in San Mateo on the proposition to
issue bonds for highway improvement the
cause of progress has met with a serious de
feat The strong majority given in Sacramento
County not long ago on a similar proposition encour
aged hopes that the people of the State had at last
reached a right understanding of the value of good
roads, and that hereafter there would be an extensive
movement in that direction all over the State. These
hopes have been disappointed in San Mateo, and
there can be no use in denying that the disappoint
ment has been severe.
Rarely has the issue of road Improvement been
presented under more favorable conditions than in
this instance. San Mateo has exceptional reasons,
founded on her peculiar situation, for favoring the
construction of highways of the highest excellence.
Her location is such that all travel between San Fran
cisco and either the rich valley of Santa Clara or the
romantic seaside resorts of Santa Cruz shall pass
through her territory. If opened up by good roads
the whole country would be virtually a suburban dis
trict. Every acre would be valuable. Every por
tion of the mountain and valley would have attrac
tions for men of means and culture. In a time com
paratively short after the construction of such high
ways San Mateo would have been one of the most
flourishing rural localities in the world, while without
such roads much of it must remain in the condition
of an almost inaccessible wilderness.
In addition to the arguments for the bond issue
drawn from the situation of the county, there were
others hardly less important drawn from the character
of the proposition itself. The plan of improvement
had been thoroughly studied out in every detail by
competent experts and was both efficient and econ
omical. It is hardly likely the people of that section
will ever have a better devised system of road im
provement submitted for their approval. This fact
adds to the regret at the result of the vote. When
such well-considertd measures for the public welfare
are rejected it is doubtful whether any progress can
be made until conditions have changed and a new
temper prevails among the people.
The only apparent cause for the defeat of the en
terprise is the feeling of despondency caused in the
minds of the people by the dry winter and the dam
age done to crops by the recent frosts. When the
weather is unfavorable to agriculture the people are
generally unfavorable to everything in the way of
progressive politics. Presidential contests have been
decided by the condition of the wheat crop, and the
course of much of our legislation has been deter
mined by the way the winds blew in election years.
San Mate~o cannot be persistently opposed to a sys
tem of road improvement which will add so much to
her wealth and her prestige, and when a good crop
is in sight it will be worth while for her enterprising
citizens to submit the proposition to the people for
reconsideration.
THE TRAVELING LIBRARY PLfiN.
IT is gratifying to note that the proposal to in
crease the usefulness of the State library by adopt
ing the traveling library system, which The Call
has so strenuously advocated, is being well received
in the State and has been warmly supported by some
of our most influential contemporaries. The propo
sition is one of no ordinary importance to the com
monwealth, and if carried out on a scale commen
surate with the needs of the people would be of
great benefit to all who live in localities where public
libraries are not within reach.
The scheme of the traveling library is simply an
adaptation of the wisdom shown by Mahomet in de
ciding to go to the mountain since he could not make
the mountain come to him. It is impossible to take
the State to the library at Sacramento, but it will not
be at all difficult to make the books of the library
circulate through the State. The plan is not a
hazardous venture into the unknown. It has been
tried in many States, and is now in successful opera
tion wherever tried. We have repeatedly directed at
tention to this phase of the question. In adopting a
system of traveling libraries for California we would
simply have to follow the methods which are used in
New York and other States of the East to achieve
success from the start.
The library at Sacramento is one of the best State
libraries in the Union. It is an institution of which
the commonwealth ha 9 a right to be proud. Unfor
tunately we cannot be equally proud of the use we
make of it. Few are the readers of California who
have an opportunity to profit by the volumes that are
stored upon its shelves. Under present conditions it
is in fact hardly more than a local Sacramento library,
and of the people who are taxed to maintain it not
more than one in ten ever gets a chance even to look
at it
Very different would be the condition of affairs if
the traveling library system were adopted here on a
scale approaching if not equaling that of New York.
The noble collection of books at Sacramento would
then be a State library in fact and usefulness as well
as in name. Its volumes would then be accessible
to readers in even the most remote counties, and all
Califomians who desired to share in the benefits of
the institution would have an opportunity of enjoy
ing the privilege.
The issue is one of comparatively little importance
to San Francisco, for we have here many libraries
and books are easily accessible to all who desire them,
but to the people of the smaller cities and towns
where there are no large libraries, and particularly
to the dwellers in rural communities distant from
libraries of any kind, the matter is one of the highest
concern. It is a well-known fact that in the United
States some of the most cultured and most earnest
readers of standard books live on farms or in small
villages. We are all aware of the difficulty ex
perienced by young men of the Lincoln type in get
ting books to satisfy their ambitious desires for
knowledge and intellectual advancement. California
has no lack of ambitious youth and earnest manhood
in her country districts, and she has at Sacramento a
library whose volumes are almost unused. It will be
a folly if she does not place the books at the disposal
of the man and make the library free to all who desire
to profit by it.
Editor Braun of Texas has at last been shot. It is
impossible to feel any emotion of surprise at this cir
cumstance. He has devoted his time to trying to
get somebody to shoot him, and Texan9 have the
reputation of being willing to oblige. As the editor
gave as good as he got in the final encounter the af
fair may be continued elsewhere.
Those Cubans who announce themselves as tickled
to ; the point of exuberant happiness by the brand of
autonomy doled out by ; Spain were a little ; tardy in
letting people know it. Spain herself never had a
suspicion that they were feeling this way. .

how 'twould be. These editors have

: "The Atlantic," "Helena" answered de

"I've always wished he'd sent me there
instead of to the Cosmopolitan. I've an

"Oh, have you?" interrupted "Helena."
"Well, take courage. You'll have an op

"It's only a question of time, my dear,"
said "Who'd be a Woman?" the dean of
the MSS. "He swears he'll never try
again when we come back, but along

fingers close upon one so lingeringly, so
tenderly. Almost unconsciously he be

ed (I never knew it to fail when an
author's his own audience) he reads to
the end, lays down the story and sits for
a moment, a beautiful light in his eyes, a
tender, proud smile about his lips. What's
he thinking about? What does he see?
I'll tell you what I sometimes think. He
sees us not as we are with all our faults
of execution, with all our little human
shortcomings, but as he conceived us,
full, warm and glowing with life, clear
and sustained as the note a tenor thinks
he sings. Each incident is a living,
breathing picture to him; he sees us as
we live In his own mind, each of us, all of
us, his beloved children evenâ even â "
"Who'd Be a Woman?" concluded al
most with a sob â "even those of us who
are least vigorous, who are old and yet
immaturely crude."
"I know," exclaimed "The Penance of
Peter" eagerly. "When he takes me up
like that, the power of appreciation, the
delicacy of perception which is in him,
seems to inspire me. I rise â or try to â
to the ideal he has of me, and Judging
by the triumph In his face I believe I al

good. When I arrived at Harper's and
was taken out of my shell I spread my-
Felf haughtily and crackled a little
superciliously under the reader's eye. I
watched her furtively as she read me,
waiting for the glow and sparkle that
comes to his face, but hers was as non
committal as the postman's when he
brings us back. My, how fast she read!
Hope died out of me; and perhaps (my
conscience gives me an occasional twinge)
it was my own fault that I came back to
him. But under that expressionless eye,
who could sparkle? Who could be light
and airy and gay? Not I. The meaning
faded out of the short, snappy lines he
had written with so much pleasure, the
wit became dull, the action slow. I felt
heavy and stupid, and tingled all over
with a sense of being ridiculous and ef
fortful. I could have edg<^d, of my own
accord, toward the return envelope; I
knew her mind before she read three
pages, and I was so mortified, I was glad
to be placed in the envelope and back on
my way to him."
"That's all very well," murmured
"Adrian the Musician," "but think of the
home-coming. Oh, how I shivered inside
the envelope when I came back to him!
He held me for a time, looking not at me
but straight ahead. 'So you're not avail
able, either,' he said bitterly. Then he
put me aside, and it was weeks before he
broke open the envelope. Oh, how I felt
for him! The very sadness that was in
me for his suffering must have tinged my
lines, for as he read me over â "
"He always will," interrupted "A

to find the fault the editor had discov

"âAs he read his face lost Its personal
pain, and when he finished there were
tears in his eyesâ for Adrian's pitiful
story, not for his own."

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Russian sauadron in Asiatic wa
ters consists now of twelve vessels, ex-
CiUslve of torpedo boats, and four battle
ships were due during last montu.
The German squadron on the China sta
tion will next summer be composed of the
Kaiser and Deutschland, and three sec
ond, two third and one fourth class cruis
er, carrying a total of 3154 men.
There are two cruisers and a torpedo
gunboat under construction at Tokosuka,
and a battle-ship and a first class cruiser
are soon to be laid down at the same
yard.
A slgrnalman on the British cruiser
Taurango, on the Australian station, has
been court-martialed for striking on offi
cer and sentenced to three years' penal
servitude and dismissed from the ser
vice.
Four torpedo boat destroyers are build-
Ing for Japan at the yard of Thorney
croft, the first to be delivered next June
and the others at intervals later on. The
boats, are to have a speed of 31 knots, with
6000 horse power and a displacement of
360 tons. The conning towers will be
armored and the coal capacity 90 tons.
The Japanese navy in commission num
bers six armored ships, fourteen cruisers
and coast defense ships, eight gun ves
sels and torpedo cruisers and fourteen
torpedo boats. This fleet of forty-two
vessels constitutes four-fifths of the
available naval force and includes nearly
all ships built and acquired since ISB2.
Lord Beresford has a direct and prac
tical way about him which evidently
troubles the admiralty. In Parliament
on March 11 Lord Beresford asked the
First Lord of the Admiralty whether he
would, settle ail doubts as to the perform
ance of Belleville boilers by ordering the
cruiser Diadem to steam across the At
lantic under full power, to which propo
sition Mr. Goshen declined to order the
experiment on the plea that it was inad
visable to run a ship at full speed for
such an extended voyage before the en
gine shaft had become fully accustomed
to the machinery.
The pride of the British navy, the
Powerful, is in a bad state. She made
21.8 knots at her trial trip last July, and
great things were expected from her on
her voyage from England to the China
station. The orders were to push her up
to 20 knots on the trip from Singapore to
Shanghai, but she accomplished only
about 13 knots. The cause of this remark
able reduction in speed is alleged by the
Hongkong Press to be due to the fact
that the port engines have settled slight
ly. This settling, however trivial, throws
tho shafting out jof line with the engine
and prevents smooth running of the
Journals. She was overhauled upon her
arrival at Hongkong and ma.de a brief
trial, developing 21 knots, but It 4s never
theless asserted that the ship must re
turn to England to have defects made
good.
French Journals have taken offense at
the names of British ships. These names
recall victories of the British over the
French, and they particularly dislike
such names as the Nile, Blenheim. Agin
oourt and Trafalgar. As the Agincourt

"All so alike, you mean," sarcastically

HAWAII IN CASE Of WAR.
San Francisco, April 2. 189 S.
Editor Call: Now that the country is
on the verge of war, I thought it would
be reasonable to show to those who think
that by annexing the Hawaiian Islands
we can better protect ourselves how fool
ish it would be to take such a step. Our
navy is being got ready for action, and
our seaports are being fortified, and as
the preparations for trouble are going
on we see how few ships we have to pro
tect the Pacific Coast.
I ask one question of the annexationist.
and that is this. Where in the name of
God would the Pacific Coast be in case
of war with Spain if we had already an
nexed the islands? As the United States
navy is none too large at present, it can
be seen at a glance that if war were de
clared either the Pacific Coast or the Ha
waiian Islands would have to be left open
to attack. Senator White did well when
he said that "we cannot protect ourselves
by acquiring other territory which needs
f>rotection." Uncle Sam cannot afford to
cave his own coast open to attack while
sending his warships out to protect isl
ands 2000 miles away.
Let every annexationist bear this in
mind. R. D. WHITE.

INGLESIDE.
A large qrowd of heavy bettors saw the
almost invincible Moondyno and Kennel
mate Connemara go down before some
fleet hounds yesterday at Ingle3id'Â» Park
with money in plenty as good as 5 and 5
to 1. The two courses were the principal
events of the day, and In consequence the
form players were thrown off their feet.
J. Dean, the owner of the hounds, was
not greatly surprised at the defeat of
Connemara, as that dog has been carry
ing considerable surplus fat for a few
weeks, but when Moondyne went down to
Flashlight, who won the purse, the owner
was unable to account for the defeat with
the exception that the hare favored the
winner to a great extent.
The puppy stake created conbilfrable
interest, but the many fleet old dog 3 and
the splendid condition of the hares were
the main topic of conversation. During
the afternoon the interest in the cours
ing event was transferred to the arrival
of the two celebrities, Anna Heii and
Tod Sloan, who entered the ground ar
rayed in furs on the one part an<l tne
light coat en the other which baa caused
so much envy among the "dressers
throughout the city. .
Taken all in all the sport was exceed
ingly good and all were satisfied when the
results were given, with one or two ex
ceptions. In the final of the all-aze stake
the bookie made a mistake in writing
tickets, anil in consequence the juil<;j de
cided the course without the assistance or
the flag rr&n and rode to the stake naiu

It all happened:

DR. MAITLAND HELD
IN SAN JOSE'S JAIL.
Alleged Swindler Awaiting the Ar
rival of Officers I'rom Los
Angeles.
SAN JOSE, April 3.â Dr. D. A. Malt
land, who is wanted by l<os Angeles
authorities for victimizing a number of
prominent people and hotels, is occupy
ing a cell at the City Prison pending the
arrival of an officer from that place.
The doctor Is 111 at ease, In his confine
ment, as he has been accustomed to 11 v
l ing on the fat of the land. He denies
I having victimized any one, and says he
: cannot understand why he was arrested.
Maitland is well educated. He speaks
with a Jewish accent, but claims to be an
aagiiÃuuuu).
Dr. Maitland came to San Jose about a
week ago. passing as Dr. "W. A. Marsh.
He engaged quarters at a North Second
street boarding house and ingratiated
himseli into the confidence of the mother
at his landlady. He told her stories of
his greatness and learning, and she be
lieved in him implicitly, and introduced
him to a gentleman in this city, who was
going to endeavor to obtain for him a
position as professor at Stanford Uni
versity. Dr. Maitland was to have gone
to Palo Alto to-day and make such ar
rangements as were possible to obtain a
position at the university. This plan was
thwarted by the discoveries by Detective
Anderson, of which Maitland was in
formed by thÂ«Â» woman previously men
tioned. This caused the doctor to change
his plans, and when arrested he was pre
paring to take an early train this morn
ing for San Francisco.
CORONA TO BE TOWED

Will Be Repaired in This
Harbor.
SEATTLE, April 3.â The tug Tyee to
day towed the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's Corona from the Quartermas
ter Harbor dry dock to Seattle, After
taking on a supply of fuel the tug will
leave in the morning and expects to pull
the Corona Into San Francisco five days
later, where she will receive thorough re

The Corona was wrecked in Alaska In
January last. The two holes and the
fractured part of her hull have been cov

with cement on the inside. It has been
found that a number of her plates were
damaged so that they will have to be
removed and the keel straightened. The
houses, cabins and saloons are either
completely gone or almost a total wreck.
It is estimated that complete repairs to
the Corona will cost over $60,000.

SOME CAUSES OF ENTHUSIASM AT CENTRAL AND RECREATION PARKS
Pitt, Sacramento's pitcher, both doubles,
i scoring two of the three runs credited to
the Qolts and sending in the other. Had
| his searchlights not been in such good
â¢ condition the game would probably have
I extended into the dinner hour and dark
: ness without either side scoring.
Sacramento made its initial appearance
j on the local grounds and though Manager
! Young took home a little white alley, the
I first shut-out of the season, the defeat of
his giants is nodlscredit. They played abril
liant game as shown by the manner in
which they held the Colts down, but they
were handicapped by having to face a port
side pitcher, and as the majority of the
Giants are left-handed batters they were
completely at his mercy. Three widely
scattered singles, one of them being very
much on the scratch order, were all they
could muster, while seven of them tore
large; rents in the atmosphere.
They are a good aggregation and when
they round to Into form they will make |
the best of the other members of the Call- j
fornia league realize they have been to a
ball game. Pitt gives promise of develop
ing Into one of the fastest pitchers in the
league. He has wonderful speed, remind- ,
ing one of Borchers in his palmy days, be
sides excellent control as a rule. Yester
day he went into the game without hav
ing done any preliminary work to speak
of this season, and held the Oakland slug
gers down to ten hits, divided up among
six Innings. There is not a point in the
team that can be pronounced w.-ak in
fielding, and all have records as heavy
willow-wielders. \ . -
The Colts show up to better advantage
each game they play, and Manager Ew
ing is already drawing pictures of the :
disposition he will make of the cham
pionship pennant. No argument can |
shake his belief that the trophy is al
ready within his grasp. With Russell to I
hold down opposing batters ; and his ; aids ;
to punch out runs, it certainly looks as
though Ewing had cause for his optimis
tic views. .
What a game it was yesterday! . Sat
urday's aftair was fast enough Â«to suit ;
the most exacting crank, but yesterday's
game went it one better. . Recreation !
Park is rapidly becoming ; noted for its
close and exciting contests, but the latest
game kept the 3000' spectators in a con- |
stant roar. Played in an hour and I
twenty-five minutes, with the . score at
the close standing 3 to 0 in favor of the
. Colts, everybody present knew, he -had i
seen a ball game. Besides -. Russell and I
Hardie, Mosklman. Oakland's change !
pitcher, took a leading part in the game. |
Owing to the illness of Fred Lange's I
wife Dean was sent to third, and Moski
man to the middle pasture. Two hits out
of four times up was his record. with the
stick while two i put outs rand an assist
constituted his outside work. But it was
the assist that earned him a great round
of applause. With : one out â â  Edwards
reached second on a muffed , fly J and
passed ball. Caverly was hit by a pitched
ball and went to first. Hoagland lifted a
high fly out to right center, which ; Mos
kiman " plucked * and shot ? the ; ball â¢ away
over to third; ahead, of Edwards, who
started for that cushion ias soon ,as | the
sphere was captured. It was a wonderful
throw, .; equaling that of . Lou Hardies a
week ago. ..". â 'â "'â  â  :
While none of the Giants did anything
worth mentioning , with < the bat, ; they all
showed un strong . in the - field, with â¢ the
possible exception of Edwards, but as |ho
had not - touched ; a .ball before this i sea- |
son it was. hardly to be expected that he
would play, up to his gait. y. . .:. . ;-> â¢; â â ,<â -
For three innings the game was of the i

DEFEATED IN THE EIGHTH.
San Jose Dealt a Solar Plexus
by Pompadour Jimâ A
Close Victory.
Hall to Jim; hall to the future Con
gressman from Harlem. To him all glory
Is due. Did he not lay aside his toga and
hie himself to Central Park yesterday
and bat the Olympics to victory? Did
he not with ease of manner accept the
glances of the fair sex and the swift
Bpeedlng ball while playing the Initial
position? Ay, that and more. Cor
bett endeared himself to the baseball en
thusiasts by accepting fourteen chances
without an error, a record that would,
if brought to the notice of his constitu
ents send him to Washington by an
overwhelming majority.
The news that the actor-pugillst-states
man was to appear on the diamond acted
as a lodestone in attracting nearly 3000
of both sexes to the grounds; principally
the fair sex. The latter seemed to have
been carried away with Pompadour Jim's
graces and many were the kindly re
marks that sped toward him. "Isn't he
Just lovely?" "On, he's just too clever
for anything," and so on throughout the
game The tall "Naval Cadet" could not
come to the bat without receiving an
ovation, and when he made a brilliant
play the sound that arose over Central
Park was like a park of artillery saluting
the incoming Spanish flotilla.
As to the game, it was an exhibition of
Corbett, hard-hitting and numerous er
rors all of which was forgiven when
the home aggregation were declared win-
San Jose was afflicted with the biggest
case of hoodoo that has been witnessed
upon the grounds for many seasons.
Starting out with two runs. San Jose
counted on an easy time, but they were
ignorant of the fact that Jim had a rab
bit's foot in his pocket, and to him they
partially owe their defeat. Knell was
first up' for Olympic, and reached first on
a single, and was advanced to second on
McCarthy's fumble. Corbett sent a swift
f rounder to second and White was
orced, Phil coming home on the play.
Steffanl began his presentation of bases
on balls by letting Hilderbrand walk.
Muller then bunted to third and filled the
bags on Foley's error. Bliss flew out to
right, and the moment the ball was cap
tured he flew home, beating the sphere
by aa inch. Johnson then endou the in
ning by going out on a bunt to first.
In tho second Olympic scored another,
and things quieted down till t..e fifth,
when San Jose alighted on Knell's deliv
ery for four long hits, scoring three runs.
Every spare momont of Jim's time was
spent in rubbing the hare's foot in the
hope of changing things, but no fruit was
borne till the seventh, when, by an extra
rub, fortune turned. Johnson was hit hy
Steffani, Scott singled and reached third
on the throw home to catch Johnson.
Rlhith was givpn a life and stole second.
Knell sent a liner to center and Johnson
and Scott scored. White struck out and
then mighty Jim came to bat. Taking a
grip on the ash he vowed to do or die. He
caught a nice low one and raised it over
second and Smith and Knell came home,
tieing the scor^. In his attempt to reach
second Jim was retired.
In the eighth Steffanl suffered some
moro. Scott singled, took third on Smith's
two-bagger and both scored on Knell's
two-cushioned strike over the fence.
In their half of the ninth San Jose tried
to overcome the lead, but the hoodoo was
too great. McGucken reached first on a
hit and was scored on Foley's two-bagger.
Things looked rosy for an extra Inning,
but Greeniger flew out to right, explod
ing the visitors' hopes.
Although striking out seven men Stef
fani pitched a poor game. He repeatedly
hit tho batters or guve them bases on
balls, and to this may be attributed San
Jose's defeat.
Knell pitched a steady game and proved
an easy thing for his opponents. Good
fielding alone saved him. McCarthy eufly
played the star game from his side, while,
next to Corbett, White deserves honor
able mention.

MYSTERY OF A
PISTOL SHOT
Mrs. Shuld, Known as Pearl
Hathaway, Found Bathed
in Blood.
Police Think it May Hays Been an
Attempted Murder, but the
Woman Blames Herself.
Mrs. â William Schuld, known as Pearl
Hathaway, an employe of the Midway,
on Market street, was wounded by a bul
let on Saturday night. Though it is gen
erally believed she attempted suicide, her
husband is now being held on suspicion
of having shot her in a fit of jealousy.
As soon as the news of the affair came
to the knowledge of the police Detective
Crockett was detailed on the case. He
called at their apartments in a rooming
house at 12 Mason street and unceremoni
ously ordered Schuld to leave his bed and
accompany him to police headquarters.
Mrs. Schuld is in no paxticular danger,
as the bullet entered her hip, causing a
slight flesh wound. Dr. A. P. O'Brien has
attended her and yesterday she was able
to leave her bed and move around her
apartments. In speaking of the affair
last evening. Mrs. fcichuld said:
"I am much worried because tney took
'Billy' out of bed for something he never
did. He is as innocent of the atttempt as
any one. I am the one to blame. I was
despondent and tried to end my existence,
just as I have tried and failed before. I
had a few drinks and they must have
turned my head. The revolver was lying
on a shelf, and I idly picked it un with
no intention in the world of doing what
I did. I had my thumb on the trigger
and snapped the weapon two or three
times, and all of a sudden the pistol went
off. The ball just grazed my hip, and I
fell to the floor groaning. Billy was ly
ing on the bed in a sort of stupor, hav
ing had some gin for the first time in
eight months. He lay there a few min
utes, but hearing me groan he arose and
said, 'Pettie, you're not hurt, are you?'
and lifted me on the bed. He opened my
skirt and found blood stains, and becom
ing frightened he sent for a doctor. I
swear he did not do it, and I am sorry I
caused him this trouble.
"This is about my sixth attempt to com
mit suicide, and I swear I will never do
it again. I tried to kill myself In Sacra
mento when I first bought the re
volver, but did not succeed. Then again,
on Howard street, I took laudanum, but
ray mother relieved me of the poison. I
have in my cups tried to cut my heart out

Hardy.
Jehxib E. Green, Denmark, lowa,
Writes to Mrs. Pinkham:
"I had been sick at my monthly
periods for seven years, and tried
almost everything I ever heard of, but
without any benefit. Was troubled
with backache, headache, pains in the
shoulders and dizziness. Through my
mother I was induced to try Lydia B.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and
it has done me so much good. lam
now sound and well."
Mrs. Harry Hardy, Riverside, lowa,
writes to Mrs. Pinkham the story of
her struggle with serious ovarian trou-
ble, and the benefit she received from
the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound. This is her letter:
" How thankful I am that I took
your medicine. I was troubled for
two years with inflammation of the
womb and ovaries, womb was also very
low. I was in constant misery. I had
heart trouble, was short of breath and
could not walk five blocks to save my
life. Suffered very much with my
back, had headache all the time, was
nervous, menstruations were irregular
and painful, had a bad discharge and
was troubled with bloating. I was a
perfect wreck. Had doctored and
taken local treatments, but still was no
better. I was advised by one of my
neighbors to write to you. I have now
finished the second bottle of Mrs. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, and am
better in every way. lam able to do
all my own work and can walk nearly
a mile without fatigue; something I
had not been able to do for over two

FOSSES ARE

Have Lost Trace of
Regan and His
Companions.
Believe They Are Still

Flats.
Two Noted Man Hunters Join
in the Pursuit of the
Pair.
REGAN SEEN IN MERCED.
Visit* a Oanoa Hall, but Leaves
When a Law Officer
Appears.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MERCED, April o.â The peace offi
cers of nearly every county in the San
Joaquin Valley are doing their utmost
to establish the identity of the myste
rious confederate cf Cliff Regan, the
Cross Creek train-robber. The move
ments of every known ex-convict, crim
inal or suspicious character within fifty
miles of where the crime was commit
ted are being traced, and unless Re
gan's companion is unknown to the
peace officers of this vicinity the Sher
iffs and their assistants hope soon to be
able to tell who the mysterious robber
is. The identity of the man would help
the officers in their effort to capture
the pair.
The posses on the trail of the bandits
to-day gained no further information
of the whereabouts of the pursued men.
It is thought, however, that they are
still in the vicinity of Schultz Mountain,
but that they are traveling slowly dur
ing the nights toward Fresno Flats,
where Regan has many friends who,
the officers believe, would be disposed
to befriend them and assist them to es
cape the law. Many of the residents of
thai district have no love for the South
ern Pacific Railroad and a person who
destroys any of that corporation's prop
erty and gains a few dollars by theft at
the same time is considered little short
<>f a hero.
F. T. Griffith and James Collins, two
'.â â : experienced man-hunters, joined in the
chase after the robbers to-day. Grif
fith is the crack rifle and wing shot of
â the San Joaquin Valiey and he is eager
f"r the opportunity to draw a bead on
either or both of the hiding men. Grif
. fith has a reputation of being able to
shoot quickly and with accuracy.
Regan has no fear of bullets while
'â¢;: he holds a weapon and has a ghost of
a show of winning a fight. The first
"time he ran foul of the criminal law he
grave battle to the arresting officers and
quit only when he had emptied one pis
'.ol and the other was shot from his
.. nand. He was then only a lad of 18
Â»ears. He has gained in courage and
rriminal skill since then, and the pur
suing officers expect that some of their
number will be sent across the divide
before the outlaws are caught.
The sorrel horse that the robbers had
': .vhen they were seen a few hours before
. :he hoid-up by Supervisor Ellis of Tv
: lare has been found. It strayed into a
ranch barnyard about twelve miles
.-south of Fresno the second day after
. :he robbery, tired and having the ap
. \ of having been driven a long
â¢ â way and at a fast gait.
..- Regan was in Merced on the night of
the fourth day after the robbery. He
was seen by Mrs. Joseph Tucker, the
wife of the keeper of a dancehall, who
/knew the robber. He entered the place
â  .at about midnisrht when the barroom
was deserted and walked up to the
â¢;. counter. He had hardly got into the
place 'when another man, a stranger
'â :.\.\JO Regan, entered the room. Regan
... walked away from the bar to the wall
:.â¢'â¢ and watched closely every move of the
stranger, with his hands deep In his
overcoat pocket. A few minutes later
? a town constable entered the barroom.
As soon as Regan saw the officer he
.'â¢ pulled the rim of his hat down over his
face and slunk away. Regan was not
./"generally suspected of being one of the
train-robbers at the time, though the
â /' officers wanted him for numerous
"'â¢ crimes.
Mrs. Tucker mentioned the fact of
'.'â "" Regan's visit to the dancehall to her
iv.sband that night, but until to-day
:he officers were kept in ignorance of it.
HILL PLACED IN
THE DEATH CHAMBER.
Doomed to Hang on Wednesday, but
Expects to Be Granted a
Reprieve.
PAN QUBNTIN, April 3.â Benjamin J.
. Hill, the Oakland wife murderer, who is
â  to be executed here next Wednesday, was
â  -,' taken from his cell in Murderers' Row
" . and placed In the death chamber this
' â  afternoon. Hill has exhibited no fear and
." devotes himself to religious work. He
had nothing to say this afternoon when
\. he was summoned to prepare for the
V journey to the top floor of the old furni
ture factory, where the gallows stands
ready to receive him in the room adjoin
ing the death cell. He carried his Bible
with him. Guards Jones and Abrogast
â  will act as the death watch.
While in Murderers' Row, Hill organ
ized a Bible class among the condemned
men confined there. He hopes to either

REMAINS OF
ENOS LAID IN
THE VAULT
Services Once More
Held Over His
Body.
It Was the Widow's Turn
and Mrs Snyder Was
Not Present.
Orders Issued to Have Her
Refused Admittance to
the House.
THEY WILL GO TO COURT.
A Bitter Fight Expectedâ How Perry
Sears Fared at the Hands or
His Sister.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SONOMA, April 3.â For the second
time prayers were said over the body
of John S. Enos, and once again friends
assembled around his coffin, but still
the man is not yet buried. He lies in
the city vault of Sonoma, while the
widow and the other woman fight over
his bones, and not until the courts have
finally decided who shall have the
corpse will he be allowed the rest of the
grave.
There were perhaps twenty-five or
thirty people to follow the hearse, most
of them friends of Mrs. Enos; on the
former occasic n there were as many at
the house of Mrs. Snyder, most of them
friends of Mrs. Snyder, but this time
there was a funeral procession as well
as funeral ceremonies, and so Mrs.
Enos is one point ahead.
The funeral services were set for
half-past 12 to-day, and at that time
there were more people waiting around
outside than entered the house of the
undertaker where the body lay. There
was a suspicion that Mrs. Snyder
would attend the funeral, and it was
known to many that if she appeared
she would not oe allowed in the house.
She was not there, however, and the
services passed off without any un
pleasant Incident. Rev. Charles E.
Chase of the local Congregational
church said a few short prayers at the
house, and then there were a few more
at the vault; the niche for the coffin
was closed, and the widow and her
daughter took the afternoon train for
San Francisco. That was all. but it
was only after invoking the aid of the
law that the widow secured even that
The first funeral services were held
, at Mrs. Snyder's house last Friday, but
lan injunction from the Santa Rosa
! court stopped any attempt at burial;
Mrs. Enos had thereby secured posses
sion of the body for one day, and in
that day she laid away the remains of
i her husband herself.
On the completion of the fight in the
i courts there will very likely be another
! funeral, but when that fight will ter
i minate is a question no one can an
! swer. Neither woman will surrender
! except under legal compulsion, and
both are ready to fight as long as the
courts will let them.
In Mrs. Snyder the widow has an ene
my who has shown a vindictiveness
which at one time aroused the country
round and caused the somewhat unus
ual spectacle of a town turning out
with a brass band to welcome home a
man who had been acquitted of the
charge of murder.
The man was Perry Sears, a brother
of Mrs. Snyder, and It was not her fault
he was notÂ» hanged. He had killed a
man named Reibli who had leased from
Mrs. Snyder a ranch upon which Perry
Sears had lived and from which she
evicted him. The ranch was owned by
Sears and his sister, and just before the
depression In the wine market six or
spven years ago he filled his cellars
with wine and held it for a raise
against the advice of his sister: he
would not sell, and finally she fore
closed a mortgage she held on the place
and then rented it to Reibli. Reibli
came to take possession and Sears
drove him from the ranch. He came
back, and meeting Sears made at him
with a pitchfork, whereupon Sears shot
him dead.
Sears was tried for murder and was
i acquitted on the ground of self-defense,
but all through the trial Mrs. Snyder
was the prosecutor and It was a lawyer
hired by herself who conducted the case
and fought to have the prisoner hanged.
! On his acquittal Sears went back to his
, old home in Sonoma, and the whole
town turned out to meet him. There
'' was blowing of horns and shooting of
anvils and the brass band of the town
met the guest at the station and es
corted him to his house, where there
was more celebrating. In the mean
1 while Mrs. Snyder was burned in effigy.
There will be the same bitterness in
the battle for the body of Enos, unless
years have worked a change In the wo
l man for whom he left his home. If
Mrs. Snyder would bury the man with
I his own people the widow would be
j willing to let it be done by her. but
Mrs. Snyder will put the body with her
own dead if the court gives it to her,
and because of that the fight will be a
j bitter one.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1898.
ALASKA FEVER
NOW ABATING
A Comparatively Small
Number Depart on
the Valencia.
Peculiarities Connected With
the Arrival of the
Schooner Inca.
Hulk of the Bark Almy Shifting
About â New Ferry Building
Opened â Stray Notes.
It Is not to be wondered at that those
who have invested their money in the
Alaskan transportation business are
somewhat alarmed over the outlook. The
rush for the gold fields seems to have in
a great measure abated, as was witnessed
in the sailing of the steamer Valencia
yesterday for Seattle and Copper River
points. On her last trip the steamer took
over five hundred passengers. Yesterday
forty first-class and seventy-three steer
age passengers embarked for Copper Riv
er. Portage Bay, Resurrection City and
other points. Eight took passage for
Seattle. On board also were eighty-one
fishermen, who will go to the Orea can
neries, and sixty Chinese, bound for the
same place. Six hundred tons of freight
were taken on board, as well as a number
of mules and a cow. At Seattle the
steamer will be boarded by a Government
expedition bound for Copper River to
prospect for a suitable route into the Yu
kon district. The steamer is sent out by
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. She
sailed from the new Folsom-street wharf
at 4:15 p. m., a large crowd witnessing the
departure.
For the first time the schooner Inca en
tered this bay yesterday afternoon. She
is the only five-masted and five-topmast
ed schooner that has ever been in port.
The Lewis is the only other five-masted
schooner on the coast, and has fewer
topmasts than the Inca, The cargo of the
Inca consisted of 31,763 bags of sugar, no
small item in itself, the first cargo of su
far that has gone to the new refinery at
'ort Costa. Shortly afterward the bark
entine Planter, also from Honolulu with
a cargo of sugar, followed the Inca to
Port Costa.
The new lightship. No. 70, was towed
over from the outfitting point at Goat :
Island yesterday by the Madior.o and i
moored at Union-street wharf. Next
Thursday the lightship will be taken to
the spot where the whistling buoy is now
located and anchored. All her future pro
visions will be received through the me
dium of the lighthouse tender Aiadrono.
According to orders the monitor Monad
nock steamed to Mare Island yesterday
morning to go on the drydock and be sup
plied with ammunition. It is asserted \
that the monitor will go to Norfolk as i
soon as she is ready for the trip.
The British bark Dominion, with a car- <
go of coal, consigned to J. J. Moore & Co.,
reached here last evening, 101 days from
Newcastle, N. S. W. Considerable anxi- !
etjr had been felt by those interested over
the fate of the vessel, and her safe arrt- :
val will relieve the tension. The Drum
mulr arrived about the same time. She
is also from Newcastle with a cargo of
coal.
The steamer George Loomls, from Yen- '
tura, reached here yesterday and reports !
that at 7 a. m. the remains of the bark |
Helen W. Almy were passed about a mile
southwest of Point Pedro. The hulk was
reported to be standing upright and bear
ing the appearance of a sloop. This is ,
good evidence that the hulk of the wreck
ed vessel is constantly shifting about and i
must be removed or destroyed soon or it :
will become a serious menace to naviga- ;
tion.
The schooner Hattie I. Phillips brought
from New York to enter the Klondike i
trade and chartered to carry lumber for '
a short period, made the trip here from
Astoria in four days, arriving with a car- j
go of lumber yesterday. This is remark- 'â 
ably fast time for a schooner, and espe
ctauy so in this case, where her captain >
is unfamiliar with the topography of the
seacoast.
I'ncle Sam's monitor, the Monterey,
was crowded with a large number of cu
riosity seekers yesterday, all eager to
view one of the warships that are expect
ed to blow Spain's navy out of the waters j
of the earth. A peculiar fact is, that i
not a man on board wearing the uniform
of a seaman is not eager for war â not so
much on account of what has happened,
as one of them expressed it, but "because
them treacherous cusses always did de
serve a good lickin", and we axe the ones
as can do it, too."
The tug Vigilant was placed on thÂ«
Merchants' drydock yesterday morning.
Captain Silovich is proud of his speedy !
boat and takes good care that nothing in i
her condition shall ever cause her to take
a back seat for "any of 'em."
The schooner Thomas Negus sailed for
Cooks Inlet Saturday and came back yes
terday, after going a short distance up
the coast. Some forgotten supplies
caused the return.
The new ferry building received its ini
tial usage by passengers yesterday. A
large number of people who went on a
Â§leasure excursion around the bay and to
chuetzen Park, as well as passengers for
Tibiiron. were permitted to pass through
the grand nave of the structure.
TUBNEBS' EXHIBITION.
Gymnastic and Musical Entertain
ment of the San Francisco
Turners.
The annual exhibition of the San Fran
cisco Turners yesterday afternoon and j
evening at the Turk-street hall was a !
success in every detail. In the afternoon |
the members of the boys' class, gym- |
nasts who have not yet cast off the
ehrysalffl of extreme youth, entertained
their friends by miscellaneous gymnastic
and acrobatic performances. The boys
were divided into twelve grades, and
prizes were bestowed vpon the. winners
of each lot.
The evening was quite another story, i
A programme, musical and gymnastic,
won the unremitting applause of the well
filled auditorium. There were fifteen
numbers altogether, and the turners in
three branches of gymnastics displavefl
their corrugated muscles to the best ad
vantage. The Turners' male chorus sang
several selections with strong Teutonic
choruses. A violin- solo by A. Trost and
a flute solo by H. Mueller were well re
ceived. The final numbers brought out i
the physical skill of the Turners in box- I
ing. fencing, wrestling and broadsword ,
play. Those who specially figured in this !
work of muscle were F. Hoffman. E. :
Fleischer, W. Hinz. T. Planz. H. Berg
mann. J. Hoops, H. Mueller and J. Ro
senstein.
The entertainment concluded, the Tur
ners gave themselves up to the light fan
tastic toe, tripping it merrily to a late
hour.

NATIONAL
GUARD NOTES
Much Enthusiasm Pre
vails in the Guard at
This Time.
Major Diss, Inspector First
Er.gade, Has Ideas About
the "Red Book."
Too Much Talking in the Ranks at a
Battalion Drillâ The Naval
Militia Recruiting.
The war fever 1b at Its height among
the National Guard members in San
Francisco, and should war be declared
the First Regiment of Infantry, Colonel
James F. Smith commanding, having al
ready offered Its services, as announced
In The Call of yesterday, will be ready
to move to the front at short notice.
The First, with pardonable pride, wants
to be the first to represent the State of
California In the field, and If orders
should come to have It move Influence
will be brought to bear to have it sent
to some point where It will be able to
demonstrate that it can make a record
for Itself and show that the men who
are enlisted within its ranks are a little
more than "tin soldiers."
Reports from other parts of the State
show that there Is as much enthusiasm
In ever>' organization as there is in the
First Infantry, and that there will be no
shirking should there be a call for men.
While the division commander is re
maining silent as to the guard of the
State and what is being done in the mat
ter of preparation, he is quietly, to use j
his own language, "gathering the various
strings in order to discover the status
of the guard." It is the opinion
of those interested, that as soon
as he has picked up all the strings the
major-general will, war or no war, place
the guard on a footing that will not be
excelled by the guard of any State in the j
Union.
The appointment of Major William A. j
Halstead, commissary on the staff of the
brigadier-general of the Second Brigade, j
as ordnance officer on the staff of the
division commander, with rank of lieu
tenant-colonel, vice William Edwards,
resigned and returned to the retired list, '
has not yet been officially announced, but ,
the major has accepted, and it will not
be long before he will have the right to
wear two silver oak leaves on his shoul
der straps.
Attorney J. J. Dwyer, who has been of- |
fered the position of judge advocate on j
the staff of the division commander, with
the rank of lieutenant-colonel, still has
the offer under consideration. His hesi- :
tancy in the matter is uncertainty to be
able to devote the time from his business
to attend to the duties of the office as |
he would wish to. He stated that should
be accept the offer at this time he would j
feel it his duty to accompany the division !
commander on his tour of inspection
through the southern part of the State |
during the month of May, but that bust- \
ness engagements will prevent him from ,
so doing. He was informed that the j
offer will remain good until after the re- [
turn of the division commander.
PRINTED ORDERS AGAIN.
It is understood that the next orders
from general headquarters will be print
ed and will supersede the unsightly and
unmilitary mimeographed documents
that have been sent out for some time. |
That tm one stev in advancement, and I
i now there is some hope that an effort !
will be made to bring about a revision of
the "Red Book," the vade mecura of ,
i every National Guardsman. This book.
' however, is not considered of any value, ,
i because a reading of it produces "confu- i
sion worse confounded." Major J. \\ . F.
! Diss. Inspector of the First Brigade, in
I one of his reports has the following on
! this subject:
Another source of perturbation to officers
and men is the volume of rules and regula
tions of the National Guard of California,
know as the '-Red Book." Of all combinations
of misinformation they have to contend with
this is unquestionably the worst. It is a com
plete compendium of military inaccuracy, sup- j
plemented by a mass of obsolete and useless
precautions, " rules and regulations formulated |
by successive adjutants general and added to
what there was before they came into office.
On every seven out of ten pages there are
rules prescribed for guidance which are dia
metrically opposed to the regulations of the
armyâ which should be the rule of conduct as
far as practicable. Sections of the Political
Code relative to the National Guard, which
have been amended over and over again, are
I side by Bide with instructions for inspections
j based on General Upton's tactics. Descriptions
of uniforms long since superseded, find place
side by side with rules which cannot be ap
plied in view of orders which have subse
quently been Issued. Men who are anxious to
learn what the laws are touching the National
Guard and what rules and regulations are
prescribed are continually led astray by the
perusal of this volume. All this militates
against discipline and good order, and I
would recommend now that we have attached
to the staff of the commander-in-chief, an
officer of the regular army, that he be made
the president of a board to completely revise
the rules and regulations governing the serv
ice In California, to the end that officers and
men alike may be intelligently educated. The
State owes it to them that they be properly
Instructed and informed in a legitimate and
business-like manner.
The views of Major Diss have been con- ,
firmed by every officer in the guard who
feelfl the slightest interest in its upbuild- :
ing. but no Board of Revision was ap- ;
pointed by the Commander-in-Chief. Â©or j
has the "officer of the regular army."
Who is Captain F. de L. Carrington of the ;
i First Infantry, IT. S. A., been called upon ,
I to act in the capacity suggested. It has
been recently suggested by officers and :
men who would like to have a good guide !
book that as the Division Commander is i
â  a lawyer, well versed in political and mil
itary law, and Captain Carrlngton is well
versed in rules and regulations govern
ing the United States army, they might
With a little assistance from some of the !
bright military men. such as Lieutenant- j
! Colonel Giestlng. Assistant Adjuiar.t
1 General on Brigadier-General Warfleld's '
staff, put the 'laws, rules and regulations j
: in a comprehensive shape and that the i
United States army inspector of the '
' guard could, between inspections, devote '
some time to a revision of the work. If
that were done there would not be any
occasion for remarks such as were made
in loud tones at the recent inspection of j

THAT BATTALTOX DRILL.
The night drill last Monday by a bat
talion of the First Infantry, under com
mand of Major Hugh T. Sime, was a far
mpre effective one, in the matter of prac
tice, than drills usually had on Van Ness
avenue, where the pavement is smooth
and the evolutions are few and simple.
The four companies were marched to the
Market-street cut, where Company B was
detached to make an ascent over Reser
voir Hill with a view to secure a position
at the western end of the cut and pre
vent two of the other companies from
passing through the cut. Owing to the
roughness and unevenness of the ground,
the men of two companies were forced
to trail through the cut. single file, Indian
fashion, while the other company went
around by the right of the hill to take
up a position on Webster street near
Waller. Company B was started over the
hill in double time and were in position
to stay the advance of the two companies
marching through the cut. Had it been a
real engagement they held such an ad
vantageous position that it would have
beÂ»n almost impossible to reach them,
and two companies would, in an endeavor
to retreat, have been under a heavy and
deadly fire. Company B's movement was
well executed and shows that the com
mander has good ideas in the matter of
selecting an advantageous position. The
four companies were then taken to a
large vacant lot west of Steiner street,
and In their march went over and under
fences and finally reached a spot where
the ground was very uneven and in many
places obstructed by loads of cobbles and
asphalt dumped upon it. Upon this ground
there was a line of skirmishers, supports
and reserves, and there was advance and
retreat with firing: at various distances
and in the three positions. The majority
of the movements were well executed,
but there was one, probably arising from
a misunderstanding of orders, that in
actual service would have been disas
trous to Company D. On the order to the
re/ir that company was in the advance,
and when called to halt was ordered to
fire standing and at the time the reserve
was ordered to halt and fire. Some one
saw the error and gave the order "Cease
firing," and in a few seconds the correct
orders were given. The men turned out
in good numbers and did well except In
one respect, from the standpoint of a
soldier. That was that in the execution
of the several movements there was too
much talking. Instead of acting on
orders from the superior officers, many
men in the ranks would endeavor to ins
truct their side comrades in loud tones
how they understood the movements and
how they should be executed. The result
was that instead of there being one com
mand there were dozens in each company.
THE TARGET PRACTICE.
It is stated that the long-expected
meeting of regimental inspectors of rifle
practice will be held within a few days
under the direction of Colonel Park Heh
shaw, inspector-general of rifle practice.
At that meeting there will be an effort
made to unravel the tangle into which
the guard has got in the matter of tar
get practice, and that rules will be pro
mulgated so as to enable the men to
shoot at stated periods that the law says
they shall shoot.

sonted in the vicinity of the old church
and the foundations of the new was one
of splendor and enthusiasm. Over the
new foundation a beautiful American flag |
waved, and above the old a white cross
gleamed, beautiful mingling of patriot
ism and religion.
People stood for more than an hour on j
the raised platform, crowded the side- |
walks, blocked the streets, stood on every :
uvailalrte veranda and peered eagerly j
from scores of windows to witness the j
beautiful ceremony of the dedication of a
church to <;<>il.
On the platform the clergy were numer
ous, thvir devottt manner impressing
those who were too far away to hear and i
who could only see the ceremonials.
ceremony proper began after the
chWr had sung a song, Archbishop Rior- :
dan formally laying the corner stone and
offering prayers fur the church. During j
this ceremony there was impressive si
lenoe, and whm the last words of the
prayer had died away the choir again i
sang, after which Rev. Father Yorke de
livered an eloquent address on the pur
pose and meaning of the ceremony.
The speaker was loudly applauded at
the conclusion of his masterful address, :
which wont in a brief and general way
over the entire field of the mission of re-
Ugion and the Church of Rome.
"Day by day and night by night this
sacred ed'ifico will stand here." he said, >
"as a solemn warning of the duties of
man toward the King of Kings and to

votlon. The old church is not destroyed
in this merging of its memories and asso
ciation, its aims and purposes, in the
new."
The orator then referred to the great
scope of the work of the church, its de
votion to the cause of humanity and its
consecration to God in all lands and amid
all sorts of conditions. lie argued that it
is the duty of man to build better houses
for God than for himself, for it is the
place of worship, the place where all the
children of God may assemble and pour
forth their hearts and become better men
and women.
Continuing, the speaker said: "As this
grc-tit work stands here now being fin
ished for the great work of redeeming
mankind I can foresee the good that is to
come from its building. It will remind the
living of their duties and obligations to
God and to man, and through the silence
of the night as well as under the blazing
suns of the day, as the years roll on, it
will sound the note of the old prophet that
all is vanity: that worldly life leads to
ruin. You are to show by deeds what you
think of this church and of your God. It
is not by words that you or I must make
our records or show how we appreciato
the churches which our prosperity enables
us to build. It is by lives of purity and
righteousness that we are to show the
depths of our sincerity and true feeling.
This is to be the house of our God, the
altars are to be hip, and he will be with
us here until the trials of earth are over
forever."
Ever since October. ISS7, Rev. Father
McGinty has presided over the destinies
of the little parish whose church is soon
to give way to the now one-. After years
of hard work he placed the affairs of the
parish on a linn and solid foundation, and
ho is deservedly popular everywhere.
The old church has an Interesting his
tory and a distinction that no other Cath
lic church ever hadâ its rechristenlng for
the third time.
It Is the pioneer of modern churches
here, having been erected in the early
part of I*sl on the site where the Palace
Hotel now stands. It was dedicated March
17, 1852, and christened St. Patrick's. It
remained there until IS7O, when it was re
moved to Mission street, where the new
church of St. Patrick now stands.
In 1572 it was again moved to Eddy
street, between Laguna and Octavla,
where for a time it served as a pro-ca
thedral, where services were held until
the completion of the cathedral which
now graces Van Ness avenue, and its
name was changed to St. John's to its
present position and again changed its
name to the Church of the Holy Cross.
To rechrlsten a church for the third time j
is something unique in Catholic history.
The little old church, vine-covered and j
set in the rear of a well-kept garden, is
now serving its last year as a house of
worship.
By the first of next year the new church
on the foundation of which the builders
started six months ago will be ready to
receive its people.
Father McGinty, the pastor, dug out the
first shovelful of dirt in the shape of a i
cross and just about where the new altar
will stand.
Since then the work has been progres
sing rapidly.
The church structure, without the pews,
altars or decorations, will cost $55,000, and
when thoroughly completed with stained
glass windows, frescoing and permanent
altars, the cost will be abou*. $80,000.
Tho exterior of the church will be some
thing unique in Its architectural features,
being of Grecian classic, adapted to the
Roman conception, and its main feature
will be a portico standing out from the
main facade of the building and sup
ported by six large monolithic pillars,
surmounted by lonic caps and sustained
by the same kind of a base.
The front of the structure will be of
stone obtained from Site's quarry, near j
Colusa. The rest of it will be of brick, !
covered with cement. Thar whole will bo i
surmounted by two beautiful towers !
about 150 feet in height, and the dimen
sions of the church will be 78x141:6 feet.
The seating capacity will be 750, not in
cluding the choir gallery.
Statisticians claim that the earth will
not support more than about 5,994,000,
000 people. The present population is
estimated at 1,467,000,000, the increase
being 8 per cent each decade. At that
rate the utmost limit will be reached
in the year 2072.
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
NOT SHADOWS,
BUT SUBSTANCE
Much Is Expected of the
Grand Jury Now
at Work.
Harry Thomas' Folly Should
Not Cloak Serious
Crimes.
Removal or Lloyd and Fair Was
Evidently a Popular
Action.
Oankland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 3.
Not for many months has this county
been so interested in its Grand Jury as it
is just now. For two months that body
has been probing into all sorts of scan
dals, but so far nothing has come of it.
The indictment of Harry Thomas Is not
the result of any work of the Grand Jury,
being simply a charge growing out of a
choice of stories told the jurors by a man
who committed perjury. It is time some
thing droppedâ that is, if there be any
thing to drop. The indictment of Harry
Thomas has not appeased public opinion,
because no one blames him for the long
and growing list of scandals at the City
Hall. Although he has tried to borrow a
hundred here and there, no one credits
him with buying and selling Boards of
Health and Councilmen or with raising
corruption funds. Proof of the fact that
either Harry Thomas or Robert Mc-
Kenzie tried to borrow money is not
of much value and will not purify
the Augtan stable of municipal politics.
People want to know something definite.
They want to know if Woodward was
bought and who bought him; if Henne
berrv received any inducement to hand in
so many resolutions: if policemen bought
positions on the force; if allopathic doc
tors put up a fund to pay the Mayor's
doctor's bill and capture the Board of
Health; who is resposible for the water
rate payers having to pay such exorbitant
rates after July 1. These are the ques
tions the public is asking and which they
would like answering.
The grand juries of the past four years
have been expensive bodies to this coun
ty. The actual payment of salary and
mileage to jurors is but a small item com
pared to the thousands of dollars that
have been spent in prosecuting indict
ments with no beneficial result. Indict
ments were returned against the Board
of Supervisors for alleged misuse of
county funds; nearly a score of Indict
ments' were issued against County Au
ditor Whidden; one was brought against
Deputy Tax Collector Ernest Mayriseh;
and another against Supervisor Roeth
What has become of them all? /Without
exception all the charges have been dis
missed by iuries in the courts. Mr. Roeth.
" ho was'acquitted on Friday, has averred
rirht along that hi? indictment was noth
ing but political persecution and the ver
dict would seem to justify his assertion.
Nevertheless, Mr. Roeth has had to pay
noVle-"than STfJ) for attorney's fees, and
The county's expense has not been less
th n n is s aÂ°notorlous fact that there is some
foundation for Mr. Roeth's charge that
political grudges are carried out inthJs
county through the medium of the Grand
Jury " The jurors are Innocent -of any
hand in the lnjurttc*. but they are oound
to listen to the plausible stories told them
under the ban of confidence and to act
accordingly. When the cases come. Into
court and are heard openly on their mer
its It is seen that they are based on
gossip, or if not, then a TOT Â»M boon
found to subvert the ends of justice by
other methods. Judgir,* by the verdicts
of iurors all the officials indicted b>
Grand Juries for years back haye â  been
subjt-cted to injustice. Whether this be
so or not, the public has Its own opinion.
Just now, however, the outraged public
would like to learn who are the guilty
parties and to have them brought to jus
tice In such a manner that charges against
them would stick. No one with any
knowledge of things ap they are expects
to see Harry Thomas go to San Quentin
on the strength of Robert MeKenzie's
story. If foolishness and impolitic actions
and" bad judgment were crimes, Harry
Thomas deserves a life time sentence,
but Harry Is not the responsible party
for the corruption at the city Hall. It
may have been very wicked for him to
borrow money from a prospective candi
date for a policeman's star, or to make
use of a messenger to aid in his borrow
ing, but such actions arc not going to rob
water rate payers of a quarter of a mil
lion during the next twelve months, and
the comparative peccadilloes of the
Mayor's son should not be permitted to
divert public attention from the crimes of
others.
Rarely have such Important qhanges
been made in the municipal departments
with less comment than those, made last
week at the City Hall. Outside of a few
disgruntled politicians not a protest has
been heard. Messrs. Clement and Thomas
have been somewhat criticized for the re
moval of Chief Lloyd. It has been argued
that he was an efficient officer. Three
years ago when he was appointed chief
by a Populist Board of Works he knew
absolutely nothing of police duty and was
appointed solely for political reasons.
Captain Fletcher, who has succeeded
Chief Lloyd, has been over twenty years
on the force, has always been a stanch
Republican, has the respect and confi
dence of everybody In the city and is the
natural and logical man for the place.
Mr. Lloyd has certainly been amply re
paid for his political services and cer
tainly has nothing to expect from the Re
publican party.
It iÂ» believed that a project is on foot
to remove Street Superintendent Miller.
This would be a grave mistake, especially
with all the street work now in progress,
and Mayor Thomas will do wisely to heed
the advice of the merchants, so forcibly
expressed by the Board of Trade and
Merchants' Exchange. Mr. Miller's poli
tics is an unknown quantity, but it is
nald he is a Republican. Certain it is that
politics has never entered into his depart
ment. Chief Lloyd and Chief Fair were
offensively partisan in their politics, but
such is not the case with Mr. Miller. His
department is a practical one and the
merchants of Oakland, almost unani
mously, indorse his official course; it is
indisputable that Mr. Miller is the right
man in the right place, for Oakland's
merchants are not always partakers at a
love feast.
A lady sent me a letter a few days ago
asking if something could not be done to
provide a woman attendant at the
Morgue for female cases. The need for
such was made painfully apparent last
week when a young girl committed sui
cide and was taken in charge by the Cor
oner. No fault was made with the man
ner in which the girl was handled, but
when the ladies visited the remains and
inspected the wound a woman attendant
would have seemed more appropriate.
The case cannot be argued, but the sug
gestion is obviously worth consideration.
It Is hardly likely that a public park
will be acquired, or that a new City Hall
will be built during the present municipal
administration. The Solid Six will reor
ganize the Council to-morrow night and
they have taken good care to put them
selves in positions as regards committees
âfor themselves. No matter in what form
anything may be attempted for the next
year, it will fall to meet with the appro
val and confidence of the public. Fancy
the Solid Six being intrusted Ây the peo
Â§le of Oakland to spend half a million un
er any circumstances. With Heitmann
for President, Woodward for chairman of
the Finance Committee, Watklnson at tho
head of the Fire and Water Committee,
what more can their friends and support
, ers desire? STUART W. BOOTH.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

"War With Spain" was the subject of
the Rev. Dr. R. F. Coyle's discourse this
evening at the First Presbyterian Church.
Dr. Coyle deprecated the too frequent use
of the sword to settle international dis
putes, but said that in the present crisis
with Spain the patient and highly com
mendable course of President McKinley
justified war if the Spaniards did not
speedily relinquish Cuba and make repa
ration for the loss of the Maine and the
murder of its gallant sailors. He spoke
in part as follows:
There is still a vast deal of the war spirit
latent in the breasts of men, and too often It
Is the spirit of hell. It breathes and burns
through the columns of many of our papers.
It sputters and fumes through the halls of
Congress. It flames out here and there In
mass meetings and sometimes It thunders in
pulpits dedicated to the gospel of peace. Nor
Is this outburst of feeling always wrong.
I am very far from saying that the war spirit
is always to be deplored and denounced, or
that the appeal to arms is never Justifiable.
There are times In the history of nations
when peace would be an outrage, an Injustice,
a cowardly exhibition of Inhumanity. There are
times when righteousness demands that the
pword shall be drawn. Nothing else can meet
the case. It was so when our colonies, after
uppealing and appealing In vain, rose up In
holy wrath and throw off the yoke of George
111. There was nothing el3e for conscientious,
liberty-loving men to do. It was God's war
and every blow they struck in that conflict
was 8. blow In the Interests of humanity and
for his glory. It was so when Fort Sumter
was fired upon. To have sued for peace at
the expense of the Tnion and by leaving the
shackles on the slaves would have been a sin
and an outrage in the sight of heaven. Abra
ham Lincoln said that it was also God"s war.
and he was right. The men who marched and
the men who fought and the men who died
to keep the Hag in the sky and to emancipate
a race were missionaries of righteousness. So
there are times when the war spirit is
worthy of free and right thinking men.
Nothing is ever settled until It is settled
rigbt. That Is Just as true of nations as It
is of individuals, and nothing is ever right
that is not religiously right, or In other words
right in its relation to the eternal God. All
compromises, all adjustments, all diplomacies
not founded upon that rock are the makeshifts
of an hour, mere temporary arrangements,
which cannot stand, because they ought notâ
a patched up peace, a peace purchased at the
price of Injustice or inhumanity or dishonor,
or by a weak surrender of principle, is a dis
grace and a humiliationâ l was going to say
as great an outrage as an unholy war. There
certainly are times when the spirit that would
demand peace at any price is quite as much
to be condemned as the spirit that would un
sheath the sword without abundant reason,
and I am not sure but more. First peace then
peaceable. First righteous, that is the pri
mary, the supreme thing, then draw the sword,
or put it in the scabbard as necessity may de
mand.
There I stand on Scriptural grounds, and
standing there, I beg leave to make a few ob
servations and to state my own convictions.
I do it I trust, with all due deference to the
opinion's of wiser men than myself, modestly,
hesitatingly, but, nevertheless, firmly. I be
lieve that the time has come for us, as a peo
ple, to realize that we belong to the fellow
ship of nations, commercially, politically,
philanthropically. religiously, and every other
way and that It is no longer right or possi
ble for us to remain isolated in our own hemis
phere and say, "Let the nations of Europe
and the nations of the East take care of them
selves, and we will take care of ourselves."
That doctrine will not do. It Is too narrow
and too selfish, and proposes a peace for us
that rests upon a foundation other than that
of righteousness.
So long as we belong to the community of
nations we are, according to our measure, re
sponsible for the peace and stability and well
luMng r.f the world. When the Turks were
slaughtering the Armenians, putting helpless
women and children to the sword by thousands,
pillaging and plundering, and scattering deso
lation, we had no right to foil back upon our
Isolation and say, "It Is bad. It is shocking.
It Is awful, but as a peaceable and far-away
people we can do nothing." Rather than In
terfere we allowed American property to bo
destroyed and American missionaries to be un
protected. It was not a reassuring display
either of patriotism or human brotherhood.
And what shall we say of the movements in
the far East? It looks as though China were
about to be divided up, partitioned out among
two or three strong and plundering nations, as
thieves divide their booty. England will prob
ably speak. Japan will probably have some
thing to Fay. Hut is America to shut herself
up within her own coasts and do nothing?
I'pon what principle of Justice, or liberty, or
humanity can she do it? Is it too much to
say, as was said in Brooklyn two or three
weeks ago, that the time is at hand when
America should say to those grasping nations
that would corner the trade of China and con
trol her ports for their own gain. "We, too,
! stand, not for our own aggrandizement, not
| for our own commercial wealth, not for our
own uplifting, but we stand for freedom in
other lands as well as In our own, and you
must take account of America If you under
! take to destroy that liberty." Without rlght
: eousness the nations may cry peace, peace,
i but there will lie no peace.
i Come nearer home. War has been raging and
! still rapes almost within sight of our shores.
An oppressed people have lf*g been struggling
to be free. With a heroism, a determination
I that commands the admiration of all who love
i liberty, they are trying to break away from
i the tyranny that grinds them to powder.
; Already 400,000 of them have gone down In
: starvation nnd death. It is an awful story to
1 rehearse at the close of the nineteenth century
ond ought to mantle the cheek of the Chris
tian world with shame. When told on the
floors of the T'nlted States Senate strong men
wept like children, so dreadful wns It. Even
now we are told that the wretched Cubans
are starving and dying at the rate of 1000 a
â¢ lHy. The blowing up of the Maine was bad,
a horrible murder that sent a thrill of Indigna
tion through the land and the world, but
awful as it was It becomes completely In
significant alongside of the larger question of
Justice to Cuba.
It will not do to say the people of thnt Island
are poor and weak and ignorant and degraded
and not worth fighting for. Such a statement
Is unworthy of an American citizen, and on
the lips of a Christian it is blasphemy against
God. The poorer they are the more prwerfiUly
should their condition appeal to the sympathy
and protection of the American people who are
strong. Say not that they are degraded. Say
not that they nrÂ° far below us In the scale of
civilization. Say not that they are poverty
stricken and immoral. Nay. they are our
brothers and have a right to our protection
and the delivcrenee which we have It In our
power to give. If ever our fathers who fought
at Bunker Hill and suffered at Valley Forge
and left the blood stains of their naked feet
deserved to be free, the Cubans deserve to be
free.
In this whole matter our President, In my
judgment, has manifested a patience, a discre
tion, a wisdom worthy of the people, whom he
represents and of the exalted office he fills.
Thrice Is he nrrnoil ivho hnth his quarrel lust,
and President McKlnley has conscientiously
soueht to do the just thing. He Is certainly
entitled to the support and confidence and sym
pathy of his countrymen In these days of
trial." And all things considered, our people
have exhlhlted a most commendable self
control. The provocation has been Immense
and hard to bear. But th<>v have borne It with
a coolness and eiulrvMse tVl at arp niwnvs char
acteristic of strength. Thank Cod for that.
Put occasions sometimes arise and the hour
sometimes strikes when forbearance ceases to
he a virtue. Who will say that hour has not
come?
I do not speak for war. God forbid. As a
boy I lived through the scenes of our own
Kreat rebellion. I remember enough of It to
make me shudder. In the gospel of peace I
believe with all mv heart, and I preach It
with ever-growing 1 delight. But If Spain does
not yield. If she Insists upon keeping her hard
heel upon the neck of Cuba: if she refuses to
end the outrages and abominations In that un
happy land, and If she will not make repara
tion for the destruction of our great warship
lyine: peacefully nt anchor In one of her ports
Rnd for the blood of so many of our gallant
soldiers â then. I say. let the sword of lustlce
fall, let righteousness strike, and afterward
f will come the sweet angel of peace.

JUSTIFIED UNDER
TWO CONDITIONS
Rev. C. H. Hobart's Stand
in Regard to the
Spanish.
The Cuban Warfare Compared
With the Armenian
Massacre.
Honored God by Moving Slowly, but
He Will Bo Dishonored by
Delay Now.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 3.
Rev. C. H. Hobart of the First Baptist
! Church delivered a stirring address to
! night as a prelude to his evening sermon
: on the question "Shall We Fight Spain?"
During the Armenian massacre Mr. Ho
bart delivered one of the strongest de
nunciations ever heard in a pulpit against
the inaction of the powers. To-night he
! compared the present Cuban warfare
' with that affair and declared that every
word uttered at that time was applicable
to the United States, should she permit
the present policy of starvation to con
tinue longer. His prelude was as follows:
Shall we fight Spain? This is a serious
question. Thousands of voices are replying,
yes, with no serious appreciation of the awful -
I ness of war. Only as a last resort should we
! go to war. It is too frightful in Its conse
! quences, it Is too brutalizing in its Influences,
; it is 100 terrible and too expensive to be under
1 taken unless stern necessity Is upon us.
Yet there are certain conditions upder which
we must fight. If these conditions are found
i to exist a declaration of war is the only thing
j left us if we would retain our self respect as
I a nation. A3 a nation we fought for our In
! dependence and before God were Justified. As
! a nation we fought to preserve the Union our
fathers had established and by deity and hts>
| tory we have been justified. Now the only
?uestion worth considering is, would we be
ore high heaven be justified In a war with
1 Spain? I think we would on two conditions.
First â We would be justified should Spain
â  finally and absolutely refuse to make reason
' able and just amends for the loss we have
â  suffered of life and treasure in the destruction
jof the Maine. We must not let the destruc
i tion of that vessel and those brave men go
Without all the reparation it Is possible for
Spain to make. But we must give her reason
! able time to make such reparation. If she
finally and absolutely refuses we must fight.
There is another condition under which we
must fight. It is this: The refusal of Spain
to cease her barbarities in Cuba. It was the
disgrace of Europe that the atrocities of Ar
, menla were allowed and that the unspeakable
Turk slaughtered her subjects with scarcely a
| protest on the part of the powers. God will
i hold the nations responsible for permitting
] such an Infamy, and that right at their doors.
Now the conditions are changed. The atroci
ties are at our donr. Cuba Is our neighbor.
The methods of Spain an? a disgrace to say
; ages, not to say to civilization.
Every demand of humanity calls upon us
. for prompt interference. In this matter wo
! have delayed too long. Forbearance long ago
ceased to be a virtue. As a nation we should
! have insisted months ago that Spain conduct
I her campaign against tuba according to the
rules of civilized warfare. This she has not
, done, as the starving thousands of women and
i children who occupy the prison pens of Cuba
; only too terribly testify. In the Interests of
| common humanity and In the fear of God we
must say to Spain, you have demonstrated
I your inability to rule Cuba with humanity and
; Justice. Now she must be allowed to rule hor
! self. Every sentiment of humanity, every
heart beat of Juetlce, every prompting or
; righteousness calls upon us ,-u= a nation to In
terfere In the Interests of starving and dying
i men, women and children, even though It re
i suits in war with Spain. Our leaders have
; honored Goii by moving slowly, but the time
! has come when God will be dishonored by our
] longer sitting still.
Spain must promptly act In the Interests of
; righteousness or we must fight Spain.

FROM THE GRAND MASTER.
Hearty Indorsement of the Masonic Fes
tival bu Senator Thomas Flint Jr.
HON. THOMAS FLINT JR.
One of the most interesting visitors at the headquarters of the executive
committee of the Masons' festival Saturday was Senator Thomas Flint Jr. of San
Juan. He is the grand master of the Grand Lodge of California, and has ever
taken an active interest in th^ progress of the Decoto Home. In "Uscussing
tli." matter Senator Flint said: "I am heartily in favor of this festival, and I
shall support it in every way possible."' He then explained how much good to
the community such charities do. and speaking for the country he said he had
.ittlo <'.<>ui>t that the fete would meet with greater support than even its
most sanguine supporters hoped for. The position that Senator Flint holds is a
most important one from a Masonic point of view. He is at the head of no leas
than nineteen or twenty thousand members of the order in this State, and in
giving, as he has done and will do, his very hearty support he shows distinct
fitness for his high office and at the same time a generous spirit. When the fair
opens on the 9th of May Senator Flint will declare it open, and ne will deliver
an address. His home is in the San Benito Valley, where he has immerse
property interests and where he is \ery popular. It is somewhat unusual for
so young a man to attain such an exalted rank in the Masonic fraternity.
From day to day cheering words come from all over the Slate as to the in
terest that is being manifested over the festival, and even at this early date
parties are being formed for the week of festivity. Offers of substantial help
have commenced to come from the country, too. and the State seems to be lit
erally bubbling with enthusiasm for once. The memorial booth committtee has
already received intimations from a great many people who desire to have their
names permanently identified with the completion of the home through the me
dium of engraved tablets and tiling in the main entrance, and it looks as though
before the commencement of festival week that most of these spaces will have
been applied for. if not actually allotted. The small contribution asked for
the privilege offered by the memorial committee has doubtless had much to do
with the popularity of the plan. Chairman Patton said yesterday that the ex
ecutive committee had such a pressure of work that it might be necessary to
add to its numbers, but that if the general committee continued to take such a
hearty interest in affairs that were open to them he and his colleagues would
bo able to pull through. There are a thousand and one things to be looked
after every day, and the correspondence has become so voluminous that no less
than three stenographers are employed to handle it. No inquiry that is made
with reference to the festival is left unanswered for a single day, and this
prompt action is bringing friends to the movement daily.
Senator Flint has issued the following letter to Masons of nls Jurisdiction:
GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY.
Delegates From All Over the State
Assist at an Entertainment in
Metropolitan Temple.
From early yesterday morning until late
In the evening Metropolitan Temple, on
Fifth street, was crowded with spiritual
ists and friends of spiritualists who had
come to witness and participate in the
Semi-Centennial Jubilee, under the aus
pices of the California State Spiritual
ists' Association.
The celebration was commemorative of
the fiftieth anniversary of the doctrine of
spiritualism, and the excellent pro
gramme rendered was helped along by
delegates from all over the State.
At U o'clock in the morning the meeting
was called t<> order, and, after the hymn
"America" had been sung by the entire
audience, the speeches, songs, spirit
messages and musical renditions that
made up the entertainment continued,
with practically no intermission, until 10
o'clock at night.
Taken as a whole, the jubilee was an
immense ruccess and those who witnessed
*â¢ whether soirltuallsts or not, were
forced to acknowledge that they had
spent a remarkably pleasant and instruc
tive day.

Has Deserted His Bride.
OAKLAND. April 3.â John Delancy, the
schoolboy who ran off to Stockton and

In the Handball Courts.
The departure of the two eastern cham
pions, Dunn and Casey, has only tended
to increase the desire of our local ath
letes in the exhilerating game. Denver
had the pleasure of witnessing the east
ern players yesterday in that city, where
they were billed to give the boys an ex
hibition of genuine handball sport. But
this fact had no effect on the San Fran
cisco players, as they congregated at Phil
Ryan's San Francisco court on Howard
street early and played until it was late.
The following are the scores made at
this court:
M. McNeil and G. McDonald defeated
L. Corraine and P. Steiner. Score, 21, 15,

Men Have Quit the
" Case."
The Result of a Move
ment for a Shorter
Work-Day.
Many Efforts Have Been Made
to Arbitrate, but All Have
Failed.
WILL BE NO VIOLENCE.
Strike Committee Has Been Instructed
to Maintain the Strictest Order
Everywhere.
The strike of the local hook and Joh
printers for a shorter workday may now
ho said to he fairly on, although the ac
tual number of men and offices Involved
will not he known until later on In the
day. The International Union decided to
Bubmit the matter of a shorter workday
to* a referendum vote of Its entire raem
bershlp.
The result was that the nine-hour reso
lution was adopted, but each subordinate
union was given the privilege of selecting
the time to enforce the schedule in Its
own city, provided It should not pass a
limit set by the International committee.
New York choM January 1, IS9S, and like
other Easurn cities had little trouble In
enforcing the new scale. San Francisco
union selected April 4. and for some weeks
past the committees from the union and
the Typothetae. or association of em
ployera, have been discussing the situa
tlon, looking toward a peaceable settle
ment.

Of these establishments as were not al
ready non-union offices quietly laid down
their sticks and rules, washed the ink off
their fingers, and without a word from
either side went home, to stay away until
they are sent for.
An adjourned meeting of the union was
held yesterday afternoon, and the reports
of the "fathers of the chapels" showed
that the men had all stood firm. A strike
. oinmlttee was appointed to watch the
â¢ -tikes and note down the names of all
who enter or leave, but In accordance
uith the old-established policy of the I.
T. U. no violence will be permitted under
any circumstances, no matter what the
provocation.
The actual number of men Involved is
not yet known, but it will orowd the three
hundred mark closely. Xon-union print
ers are, and have for some time been,
very scarce in this city, and it is part of
the tactics of the printers to pay a non
union man handsomely to leave the city,
j at her than resort to violent measures.
The proprietors themselves have abso
lutely no fear of violence, and in many of
the offices striking men who had belong
ings Inside were allowed to enter and
tarry them away without being molested
or even watched.
The majority of the proprietors regard
the action of their men as a very regret
table step, as they have the best of feel
ing toward the union and its members,
l>ut claim that the profit margins are al
ready bo small that they cannot pay the
itdvance Rnd meet their business obliga
tions. Many of the offices which are men
tioned as holding out against the union
have always been non-union offices, and
ts President Hawkes said, in speaking of
this: "There are some very good men on
the list, but they are in very bad com
pany."
It is needless to state that both sides
are confident of winning out within a few
days, but owing to the number of people
Involved, the struggle will perhaps be a
long one in some of the offices. Two of the
largest offices do work of a nature that
requires a man thoroughly accustomed to
that peculiar branch of the trade, and a
U*Â»w man, be he over so competent, would
make but a poor showing in attempting
to do it. It is expected that these offices
will be among the first to yield. Many of
the other offices are small concerns, em
ploying but one or two men, and these
Will be enabled to hold out an almost in
definito length of time, as much of their
work is of such a nature that It can be
flone by men with little experience.
Signs have been posted in many of the
offices to the effect that they are "open
Bhops"; open alike to union or non-union
men, but as a union man is not permitted
to work In these, this is considered as a
lock-out.
The union men will all assemble at
headquarters this morning, where any of
their employers who desire their services
under the new scale can obtain them.
None of the strikers will be permitted to
loiter arounl In tho vicinity of the boy
rotted Hhors, as the strictest order Is to
â lie maintained.

Rev. H. T. Shepard preached yesterday

| the text:
He hath sent me to proclaim release to the
captives.â Luke 1\:1S.
He said In part:
The struggle for Cuban freedom may be said
to have begun with Cuba's discovery In 1492,
when it was peopled by aborigines, "living in
a state of happy tranquillity among them
selves"; but the whole of this population had
disappeared from the island before 156U, and
the present conflict between Spain and native
Cubans of Spanish blood, reir.furc-ed by negro
allies, has been confined chiefly to the present
century. The revolution that broke out in
IMS was marked by a declaration of indepen
| dence by the Creoles of Cuba and continued for
ten years, this including Grant's administra
tion of eight years. Diplomatic complications
with England, and Secretary Fish's weakness,
left Cuba in the meshes of Spain's lavish and
faithless promises of reform, and Cuba re
newed its light for freedom from unjust taxa
; tion and military tyranny, and continued it,
till, to-day, success seems near.
1 Cuba Is fighting for the same cause of civil
and religious liberty that Moses defended in
Ugypt, and that Isaiah proclaimed to the He
| brew captives in Babylon In words which
Christ quoted and applied to himself in our
text. During the ten years war Cuba's end
was thwarted by duplicity that reminds one
I strongly of King Pharaoh's broken promises.
' Jehovah grew weary of diplomacy after the
tenth plague and marshaled Nature's forces to
intercede for the independence of the Hebrews.
But Secretary Fish was less determined than
Moaea, and Cuba's captives toil In chains to
; the present hour. A fellow feeling of the coni
1 mon cause of civil and religious liberty should
prompt us to befriend Cuba In her struggle for
freedom. The Insurgents are fighting for the
same principle of no taxation without repre-
I seiuatlon that Inspired our fathers in 1773.
They went without their tea, but Cuba Is
I starving for bread. The I'ilgrtms rebelled
I against civil and religious oppression, and a
I province that has been estimated within a few
I years to have "100,000 children of free par
j ents," of which "not a tenth part receive let
! tered education of any kind," and of which
I the chief city "can scarcely be said to have
! any literature," and a province where only
i one religion is tolerated, surely has most un
1 questionable cause for rebellion ngalnst the
barbarous paternalism of Its oppressor*, and
Insistence upon an independence from these
oppressors as absolute as that for which the
Pilgrims fought and bled.
The time has come when our Government
I has no right to consider more than two
I courses In Its relation to these suffering pa
; triots. One of these is declaration of Cuban
! Independence. There are two reasons for this
! step. One is that this Independence Is un
[ questionably and unqualifiedly right, and that
i anything less is most certainly wrong; and the
' other Is that evasion of this duty Is only an
i Invitation to Spain to repeat the farce of dip
! lomatlc dalliance and Ingenuous assurance
HOSSANA IN
THE HIGHEST
Palm Sunday was appropriately ob- I
served in the various churches of the city,
In the Catholic churches by the solemn
ceremony of the consecration and distri
bution of palms and the reading of the
Passion. And in the churches of other
denominations by the delivery of sermons
specially applicable.
The attendance at all the churches was
large, as the day was beautiful. The cer
emonies commemorative of the triumphal
entry of Christ into Jerusalem are impos
ing and attendance at Palm Sunday ser
vices is generally large.
CONFIRMATION AT ST.
PAUL'S.
Palm Sunday is confirmation day with
the German Lutherans. At St- Paul's
Church a class of thirty-five presented
themselves before Pastor Buehler to pub
licly take upon themselves the sacred
vows. Twenty manly boys and fifteen
modest, white-attired maidens knelt be
fore the smilax draped altar. Palms
waved and nodded all around, white cal
las In banks on either side gave a restful
sense of purity and serenity, and the
fragrant St. Joseph Illy wafted its per
fume as Incense above the fair young
heads. Roses, white and pink with smi
lax, wreathed the arch over a pure white
cross.
The organ prelude "Give Ear, O, Lord,"
was followed by the choral "Come, Holy
Spirit."
Examination of the class on doctrinal
points and general Biblical knowledge
followed. The pastor then gave an im
pressive address from the text, St. John
6:67: "Will you also go away?" in which
he emphasized the importance of the
question and answer. He said the ques
tion is put to each human soul from the
Master as it was to the twelve, and can
be answered rightly only from one motive
and for one reason as by Peter.
The motive Is love for Him from whom
the question came, and the reason im
plicit belief In Peter's confession that
there is none other to whom men can go
for words of eternal life. He dwelt upon
the necessity of considering well the ques
tion before giving answer, but having
once decided, of allowing no circum
stances in the shifting scenes of after life
to swerve them from the original faith
confessed.
A hand was laid upon each bowed head
In blessing and supplication as the in
dividual name was repeated, and the
3 - oung people passed down from the altar
steps with vows before their God upon
them and members of the church visible.
AT ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL.
The members of T. M. I. Council No. 58
and the cadets of Company A of the
League of the Cross received communion
in a body. This was followed by a sermon
by Rev. P. C. Yorke on "The Victor's
Palm."
Father Torke spoke of the success of
the mission week that has just closed,
and urged hia hearers not to forget the
lessons of the mission nor to turn from
the path of repentance that so many had
chosen. "This Is the day of salvation,"
he said, "and he who delays or turns
from the path of righteousness is in dan
ger of eternal punishment."
ST. IGNATIUS CHURCH.
The morning service was devoted to the
reading of the passion and the distribu
tion and consecration of palms. In the
evening a solemn benediction was ob
served, and a lecture was delivered by
Rev. Father D. MaVioncy.
CENTRAL METHODIST.
Rev. Charles Edward Locke delivered
a eertnon to a lajg-Q congregation. Hia
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 4, 1898.
which disgraced the regime of Secretary Fish,
settled nothing, and left poor Cuba to struggle
on alone.
The only honorable alternative of declaration
of Independence la immediate armed Interven
tion. One reason for this course is that dec
laration of independence without armed inter
vention might be ignored by Spain, and so re
quire enforcement, and another is that Spain
might choose the path of wisdom and Bubmlt
without resistance.
The United States owes Cuban Independence
to Spain as the friendly act of a Christian na
tion for crushing Spain's unholy pride. A
monarchy that exercises a strict censorship of
its press, and that will tolerate a paper that
repeats with approval De Lome's declaration
that our President Is a "pothouse politician
and caterer to the rabble," and that the United
States Government is at heart as base as its
jingoes, "scoundrels by nature, toads filled
with nactiness," and "not even worth Spanish
contempt, or the saliva with which they
might honor us in spitting at our faces,"
sorely needs humbling, and to supply this need
would be an act of Oirlstlan friendship.
The t'nited States owes Cuban independence
to Spain that her cruelty may be overcome.
It Is most unfriendly to Spain to allow her
captain-general to add another 200.000 dead to
the 200.000 formerly peaceful and happy Cubans
that Weyler's order has starved.
Autonomy, past, present and future, is far
ctcal and impossible. Belligerency could do
but little toward the goal that must be
reached before lasting peace is achieved. Sug
gestion of purchase comes too late. The least
that Spain should be compelled to do Is wholly
to loosen her cruel hold upon Cuba without
compensation.
We owe the Independence of Cuba to our
Government In pursuance of the spirit of the
Monroe doctrine, and above all, to common
humanity.
AMERICA WILL BE JUS
TIFIED.
From the pulpit of the Bethany Con
gregational Church, Rev. W. C. Pond, D.
D., last night poured into Spain a Bibli
cal broadside of righteous Indignation,
and declared that it would be consistent
with the teachings of Christianity for the
United States to engage in a war with
Spain. His text was Matthew 10:34: "I
'came not to send peace but a sword." In
part the speaker said: "Krom the Pacific
to the Atlantic, throughout all the mag
nificent breadth of this land, the people' 3
ears are attaint to hear, perhaps before,
the setting of to-morrow's sun, the
trumpet call to arms. The freedom of
Cuba cannot be submitted to arbitration.
God intends for Cuba to be free and He
has made us a strong nation in order that
we may free her. This is the Christian
view of the question. The American peo
ple have heard Cuba's cry for aJd, and
her vengeance is In our hands. The tem
per of the people is fast reaching that
point where It can be no longer held In
text was "If a man die shall ha live
again?" He said: "This has been asked
by many anxious Inquirers from the day
of the Patriarch Job down to the present
time.
"I desire to give you some arguments
on the immortality of the soul, outside of
the Bible, which you can place alongside
of the unanswerable Scriptural argu
ments as strong and influential evidence:
First, In the natural world annihilation
is a myth. Your home burns down, but
no force is destroyed. By a slow process
of growth the soil and rain and sunlight
and atmosphere are transformed into the
tree, which furnishes the building ma
terial. Combustion simply releases these
forces and they go back to their original
condition. So it was at a point In crea
tion, out of material in existence God
made mans body. But from the depths
of infinite resources God gave man what
other animals do not possess â a living
soul. Death is combustion. The body
in death returns to the earth, and the
soul to the region of its nativity."
A LENTEN SERMON.
Following Is an extract of the sermon
of Rev. F. B. Cherington at Plymouth
Church, delivered yesterday from the
text. "But I keep my body under and
bring it into subjection." I Cor., ix:27.
"This is ; the Lenten season, and
thoughts in keeping with this text are
uppermost in millions of minds. Sincere
ly and Intelligently observed the rigid
self-discipline of Lent ought to be fruit
ful- of great spiritual profit. If, how
ever, we have the Idea in observing Its
rigorous 1 requirements, that during the
remainder of the year we may let the
reins upon ourselves loose just In pro
portion as we tighten them now we will
miss the very heart of the whole signifi
cance of It. Self-denial lies at the very
threshold of the Christian life. 'If a man
will follow let him deny himself,' said
Jesus. The philosophy of the demand Is
that nearly all the most destructive
vices have their roots in self -indulgence:
The vices of temper, so : often regarded
as venial, so trifling, that one hardly need
be ashamed of them, but â  really second
only to the awful vice of drunkenness it
self in their misery breeding effects; all
the vices of greed, dishonesty, over
reaching in business, oppression. . The
true spirit of self-denial would strike at
the root of all these vices in destroying
self-indulgence, or . even checking it.
Lenten self-discipline ought to â  deepen 1
and 'â - intensify love of justice; ought to
increase loyalty to duty; ought to make
us as anxious to know and : perform our
duties as we ordinarily are to find out
and secure our rights. It ought also to
make us more patient, more- kind, more
tender in our sympathies; in short, more
Christllke. Let us not forget that en
during virtues - are not easily acquired.
Like the beautiful forms painted upon
delicate chinaware, they must be - burned
into the texture of our characters > by
fierce fires. To attain high spiritual ex
cellence like Paul we need ' to :â  keep our
bodies under and bring them into sub
jection." ' ' â â â  -â -..:-

Rev. Herbert N. ; Bevler delivered '? an
eloquent sermon, taking for his text the
words of ' the hosts as i Christ was tri

check. War is an evil, but there are
worse things than war. The President's
foot is upon the brake, but not from
fear, for when the time Is ripe he will
be found the right man in the right place.
If Spain is so unwise as to engage this
country in a war she will be beaten, de
spoiled and bankrupted, but from the war
she may be made one of the great na
tions, such as her blood entitles her to
be."
After the sermon the congregation
joined in with the choir in singing the
national hymn.
WAR THE AUXILIARY OF
LOVE.
Rev. W. A. Gardiner chose "War, the
Auxiliary of Love," as the topic of his
address, delivered yesterday morning in
the Westside Christian Church. Among
other things he said: "War is the topic
of conversation, and the questions asked
whether it would be Christlanlike to have
war, and in the event of such a move
should the Christian people Join the
forces? 'Love worketh no ill to his
neighbor,' 'if hungry feed him and thirsty
give him drink.' God is love, and this
love is learned by the study of Jesus
Christ. Christ drove the thieves from the
temple, which was a_spirlt of jÃ'ar as
much as 'it would "be for the United
States to stretch forth her hands to suf
fering Cuba and say to Spain, Forbear.
Christians should join where the law of
love demands war. War is certainly ter
rible, but far better than dishonorable
peace."
SPOKE OF MR. McX IN LEY'S
POLICY.
At the Richmond Congregational
Church last evening Rev. P. Coombs
spoke of President McKinley's policy in
the present emergency. In part, he said:
"Policy is characteristic of America. The
President of this nation is in hopes that
a point may be gained for the people
without bloodshed, and he is following
this course through the fear of God.
Many people want war, but McKinley will
gain the independence of Cuba, if possi
ble, without that dreadful move which
throws two countries into bloodshed and
misery. It is wise statesmanship and the
line he is following should please the
American people, as it shows conclusively
that our President is a God-fearing man
and believes in the Almighty. I pray
there may be no war, but peace between
the two countries and independence for
the suffering Cubans."
CAMPBELL DIES
IN SAN QLENTIN
The "Aristocratic" Book
Thief Has Gone to a
Higher Court.
Was the Scion of a Respectable
Family of New York
City.
Ha Was Afflicted With a Penchant
for Stealing the Property
of Others.
The police were Informed last night that
Calvin Warde Campbell, the "aristocrat
ic" book thief, who was sent to San
Quentin from this city, died in that in
stitution a few days ago. Campbell, it
was claimed, was the scion of a respect
able and wealthy family of New York,
but as he was continually in trouble on
account of his penchant for helping him
self to other people's property, his
parents decided to cast him adrift in the
hope that he would mend his ways.
He came to this coast several years ago
and located In San Joee, where he en
gaged in business. Meeting with reverses,
he became despondent and took to drink.
Finding himself penniless in a short
time, he returned to his old tricks, and
being caught in the act of taking the
property of another he was sent to the
penitentiary for eighteen months.
He was discharged about six months
ago and came to this city. Visiting Coop
er's book store on Market street, he
picked up a volume of Shakespeare's
works and, placing It under his coat,
started to leave. The clerk at once missed
the book, and suspecting that Campbell
had taken it, he called a policeman and
had him searched. The book was found
under his coat, and he was arrested on a
charge of petty larceny. During his trial
it developed that he was an ex-convict,
and accordingly a "prior conviction" was
recorded against him. He was convicted
after a short trial and sent to San Quen
tin for one year.
It is claimed that his death was due to
consumption.

RECORD MADE
AT SCHUETZEN
A. Streeker, on the San
Rafael Range, Taps His
Highest Score.
E. Eging Captures the First
Prize in the Annual Shoot
of the Turners.
Eight Thousand Picnickers Make
Merry at the California Schuet
zen Park Sunday.
The rifle range at Schuetzen Park, near
San Rafael, was crowded yesterday from
early morning until late in the after
noon, and the great park was a scene of
animation. Fully 8000 picnickers as
sembled on the grounds to celebrate the
opening of Schuetzen Park for the season
of '98. The morning trains conveyed
great crowds of pleasure seekers, and by
noon fully 6000 picnickers were making
merry. At least 3000 arrived on later
trains, and during the afternoon every
available inch of ground was occupied.
The crowds thronged the bowling alley,
shooting galleries, swings, dancing pa
vilion and the many other amusement
centers in the great picnic park. Manager
Fred Schueman was the recipient of in
numerable congratulations on the success
of the opening of the season.
The greatest interest was naturally
manifested on the rifle range, where the
San Francisco Turner Schuetzen held its
annual shoot for medals and prizes. As
the marksmen made bullseyes through
out the day the cheering grew apace, and
an air of excitement pervaded the range,
increasing in the afternoon as the contest
narrowed down to an intensely exciting
finish.
Besides the great shoot of the Turner
Schuetzen for prizes, the California
Schuetzen Club held its regular monthly
bullseye shoot. The shooting In this con
test would have taken place next Sun
day, but owing to the fact that the mem
bers of the California Schuetzen Club
hold their semi-annual prize shoot next
Sunday on the San Rafael range, the
builseye shoot was held yesterday. The
regular monthly medal shoot of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club was also held yes
terday.
The Vereln Eintracht also held its
monthly medal contest, and the members
of the San Francisco Grutli competed in
their regular monthly meual shoot. The
Turner Schuetzen also shot in its medal
contest. These four organizations had
their finest marksmen on the range, and
the targets were kept bobbing up and
down incessantly throughout the day,
while a perfect stream of lead perforated
the bullseyes and the shots resounded
throughout the canyons.
Philo Jacoby, the veteran marksman
and organizer of the world famous Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club, D. W. McLaugh
lin, the Shooting King, John Utschig,
senior and junior, and many others of the
crack shots participated in the contests
on the range. The wind was just, suffi
cient to blow the smoke of the powder
away from the butts, and the sun shone,
strong and steady, on the targets during
the entire day. The contest could not
have been held under more favorable con
ditions.
The Utschlgs, senior and Junior, won
the special prizes offered by the San
Francisco Turners for the first bullseyes
in the forenoon and the afternoon. C.
Eging secured the last bullseye in the
morning and also captured the prize
offered for the best shot in the 25 ring
after the first bullseye. In the afternoon
John Utschig, Sr., again captured the
prizes for the last 25 and the last bulls
eye and also the special prize for shoot
ing the most tickets. It was strictly
Utschlgs' day.
Adolph Streeker, one of the crack shots
of the California Schuetzen Club, beat the
world's record on the ring targets yes
terday by making 561 rings in 20 shots.
This extraordinary score was made in the
combined medal and hullseye shoot of
the California Schuetzen Club. Strecker
beat his own record by 9 points, having
made on a former occasion 452 points.
When Strecker's phenomenal score was
announced there were cheers given for
the marksman by all the members of the
California Club. Strecker's fine work did
not end at this record, for he scored 17
out of 20 bullseyes, equaling John
Utschig's record in the California Schuet
zen Club. The work done by Strecker
was the one topic of conversation during
the afternoon.
C. Eging captured the first prize in the
Turners' prize shooot, making a score of
96 out of a possible 100.
In the great prize shoot of the San
Francisco Turner Schuetzen the follow
ing marksmen made the highest scores in

be construed so as to affect the special
provisions as to grading contained in

lution of intention declares that the
expense of the work and improvement
is to be assessed upon a district, im
mediately after the contractor has ful
filled his contract to the satisfaction
of the Board of Public Works, or to
the satisfaction of the Supervisors on
appeal, the Board of Public Works
shall proceed to estimate upon the
lands, lots, or portions of lots within
said assessment district, as shown by
the diagram provided for in section five

district the total amount of the ex
pense of such proposed work, and in
so doing shall assess said total sum
upon the several pieces, parcels, lots,
or portions of lots, and subdivisions of
land in said district benefited thereby,

Sec. 10. If at any time there shaJl be
any street work or improvement done,
and none of the methods hereinbefore
provided are legally sufficient to au
thorize the Board of Public Works to
make an assessment to pay for the ex
pense thereof, then said Board shall,
before it passes a resolution of its in
tention to recommend the ordering of
said work or improvement, establish
by resolution a method by means of
which such assessment shall be made;
and on the completion of the work or
improvement to the satisfaction of said
Board, or to the satisfaction of the
Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex
pense thereof according to the method
established by said resolution.
Sec. 11. In making all assessments

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by tr-e City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by Uje City and County of
water works, gSs works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as tha
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place â¢
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the salo
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility nam^d in said peti
tion.- At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; "but in
i case the votes cast in favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half '
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
N "thing in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from resx>onding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the I
acquisition of any public utility by pro- ;
1 1 eding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore- |
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same ae>
provided in section six of this Article |
und from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the Hume in the manner herein
after provided.
See. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility Bought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of j
the public utility, the proposed method j
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon sui h terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded Indebtedness for such :
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
-. the amount of the proposed
â bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
fcary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
. 5. When the electors by vote
s-ball have determined, as hereinbefore
I pth, to acquire any public utility,
Kuch action on the part of the electors
'shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare ' such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.
3ec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adji urned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such- public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
â  â¢lection.
Sec. S. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes, for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City j
. and County shall issue for the payment
of- the-cqst of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
.accepted. by the electors), and shall fix
â¢ a day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the manner of voting
'â¢ for or against incurring such indebted
. ness Such election shall be held as
* provided by law for holding elections â 
nVth.- City and County.
..?â â¢â¢ SfeC: 9. Such ordinance shall be pub
'.'â¢lislfett. daily for at least ten days in the '
official newspaper. At the expiration
'. â¢oi.said .ten days the Supervisors shall
'. cause to- be published daily for not less:
! .than two weeks in the official newspa

A MOVE FOR BETTER LIGHTS.
The Merchants' Association Makes a Strong
Effort to Get the Board of Super
visors to Act.
The Merchants' Association, through its vice-president, A. S. Baldwin, has
prepared and sent to the Board of Supervisors the following petition and report
of Superintendent King regarding the better lighting of the business streets of
the city:
In view of the fact that a new contract for lighting the Btreet9 of this city will
begin August 1. IS9S. we beg to -v.....-it herewith a plan for Improving the lighting of
our business streets, and respectfully petition your honorable board to provide In thÂ»
specinYattons for the new contract for lighting our business streets with electricity
Instead of gas, in the manner set forth In the report presented herewith.
In presenting this plan and request, we desire to represent to your honorable board
that, during the previous year, the property owners and merchants, on certain business
streets, voluntarily subscribed over $14,412 25 tor the purpose of giving a practical experi
ment of lighting the business streets with electricity. The results of this experiment
were so conclusive that the demand is now universal for the use of electricity instead
of gas on business streets and that these lights should burn every night during the
year.
As further evidence of the public feeling in this matter, we herewith present a peti
tion signed by a number of taxpayers, engaged in business on the streets It Is pro
posed to light, asking that the business streets be lighted by electric lights Instead of
gaa lamps, and that the lights burn every night during the year. We also present a copy
of the resolutions unanimously adopted at the general meeting of the members of the
Merchants* Association May 20, 1897.
Therefore, the Merchants" Association respectfully asks that the following provisions
be included in the specifications for the next contract beginning August 1, 1898:
First â That the business streets of this city, together with Folsom
ptreet, Golden Gate avenue and Van Ness avenue, be lighted by elec
tricity instead of gas, in accordance with the plan presented herewith.
o^cond â That these lights be burned every night during the year.
Third â That the city be divided into separate lighting districts,
and that the contracts for lighting each district be let separately.
Fourth â That the contractois to whom the electric lighting con
tracts are awarded shall place end maintain upon all electric light
poles, which are or may hereafter be placed at the crossings or intersec
tions of streets and alleys, the names of said streets or alleys.
Fifth â That, in order to permit proper competition in bidding for
street lighting, and that the successful bidders may have sufficient
time in which to make the necesssary arrangements for assuming
their contracts, the proposals for street lighting be advertised not less
than ninety days before the expiration of the present contract, and the
contracts be awarded not less than sixty days preceding the expiration
of the present contract.
REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT L. M. KING TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
THE MERCHANTS 1 ASSOCIATION.
Gentlemen: Pursuant to your request for a practical plan of a general system of
electric lighting- on the business streets of the city, instead of the present Inadequate
system of gas lighting, with the view of having such a plan made a part of the speci
fications for street lighting In the new contract to commence August 1, IS9B, I beg to
submit herewith the following report and plan for such a system.
The plan proposed Is similar to the one previously presented to the board, but modi
fled to meet the possibilities arising from the fact that a new contract Is now to be let.
The leading principle of this system is that of suspending an arc light in the center
of each crossing of all the business streets of the city, and dispensing with the ad
jacent gas lamps, -which will thereby be rendered unnecessary. This applies not only to
the business streets In the central portion of the city, but also to those in the Mission,
Western Addition and North Beach districts.
The exceptions to this rule are Market street, certain blocks south of Market street,
and a few blocks In the wholesale district, which will be referred to later on. Busi
ness streets are considered to be all those streets throughout the city upon which a
majority of the frontage Is occupied by business houses which remain open during the
In addition to the regular business streets. It Is also proposed to place electric lights
at each crossing on Golden Gate avenue from Market to Devisadero, and on Folsom from
Third to Twenty-sixth, and on Van Ness avenue from Market to Broadway. It seems
very desirable that one of the main thoroughfares to the park, and to the Mission, and
through the Western Addition, should be well lighted, and thus made attractive to per
sons driving and riding bicycles at night. In this connection, I would call attention to
the fact that Folsom street, from Nineteenth to Twenty-sixth. Is at present lighted in this
manner and it is only necessary to compare this portion of Kolsom street with that
jM.rtl.->n'from Third to Nineteenth, to realize the advantage of using electric lights mc
"one"on those streets south of Market, where the blocks ore 550 feet In length. It seems
only right that on the main business streets, such as Third, Fourth. Fifth. Sixth, Ninth
ami Sixteenth, an additional lipht should be placed In the middle of each block, thus
making these lights the same distance apart as on the short bli>oks north of Market.
Dupont and other strepts In Chinatown are not Included in this schedule for the rea
son that on account of the many dark alleys, it is necessary to have many lights well
distributed, and this can be done better with gas lamps.
The wholesale commission district, north of California, and the foundry district, south
of Market, are not included in this schedule, as little If any business is done there at
night That portion of the wholesale district bounded by Market, California and San
some being traveled by many people going to and from the ferries, will have electric
lights on even' other crossing, and gas lamps on the Intermediate crossings.
It is proposed to suspend all of these lights, except those on Van Ness avenue, from
span wires over the center of each crossing. Different electric light authorities, who have
been consulted, are unanimous In their opinions that. In order to properly illuminate
streets the light should be suspended in the middle, rather than on one side. The objec
tion to this method on account of the wires and poles will hardly obtain, as the lights,
when so placed, can be lighted from underground circuits as easily as from overhead.
The necessary poles at the crossings are. to a great extent, already In position. In any
caÂ«e it requires only an additional pole and a span of wire to each block, which Is not
FO~niuch of an obstruction as would be poles with mast arms of the size necessary to
suspend the light In the middle of the crost-ing. Light Iron mast arms may be gradually
substituted In future years, but to do so now will result In a very large Increase In the
cost Out of 171 cities, from which we have data. 117 use span wires. On account of the
great width of Van Ness avenue, and the width of the sldewaik there, it Is proposed to
place the lights on this street on neat Iron poles to be located alternately on each side of
the street crossings.
The lighting of Market street has been most carefully considered, and
the following plan is presented as the one best adapted to the purpose
without incurring a very large additional expense.
It is proposed to install fifty arc lights on Market street from the
ferries to Valencia street. These lights are to be placed upon orna
mental iron poles, and are to be arranged alternately on each side of
the street in the positions indicated on Map No. 3, accompanying this
report. This plan will afford a very satisfactory general illumination
of the street, and while I believe that, in order to be most effective,
the lights should be suspended over the street, as near the center as
possible, yet, such a method will, unless span wires are used, necessi
tate the using of costly mast arms, which will entail so much addi
tional expense that it is not recommended for the present occasion.
A careful examination of the location and number of electric lights now In use by the
cltv shows that the greater number of these lights are. at present, located In the out
lvlhg portions of the city, and In some cases, such as Kentucky street, San Bruno road.
Minion street and Point I^obos avenue, extend for several miles. Owing to the expense
of maintaining poles and wires to such distances for a limited number of lights, the
c!U of lighting these portions of the city must necessarily be greater than the cost of
lighting the central portions of the city, .which are nearer the source of supply. It, there
fore seems very desirable that, In the new contract about to be let, the city should
be divided Into several lighting districts, and that the contract fOT each district be let
separately. This will, under proper competition, show about what It actually costs to
light different portions of the city. It -will also permit more competition In city lighting.
There may be responsible parties who wnuM desire to bid for the lighting of one or more
districts, "but who do not care to undertake the lighting of the entire city. A division
of the city, and the competition thereby made possible, will bring the cost of lighting
down to what it Is actually worth, and will be certain to meet with the approval of
citizens in general.
The districts into which It is proposed to divide the city are as follows:
District No. Iâ Beginning at the intersection of Market and East streets, alonr. and
Including. Market to Ridley; along, and Including, Ridley to Mission: along, and includ
ing Thirteenth to Division; along, and including. Division to Channel; along, and In
cluding, Channel to the bay; along the bay line to the point of beginning, at East and
District No. 2â Beginning at the Intersection of Market and Fast streets, along, and
not including. Market to Ridley; along, and Including Ridley westerly to Devisadero;
along, and Including. Devlsadero to the bay;' along the bay line to the point of begin
ning, at East and Market.
District No. 3â Beginning at the northerly termination of â¢ Devisadero. along, but not
Including. Devisadero to Ridley; along, and Including, Ridley to Buena Vista avenue;
along and including, Buena Vista avenue south of Buena Vista Park, to Frederick street;
along and including, Frederick to Stanyan; along, and Including. Ptanyan to Fulton:
along" and Including, Fulton to the ocean; along the ocean and bay line to the point of
District No. â¦â Beginning at the easterly termination of Channel street, along, but not
Including, Channel to Division: along, hut not Including. Division to Thirteenth; along, but
not including. Thirteenth tn Ridley; along, but not Including, Ridley to Buena Vista ave
nue to Frederick: along, but not including, Frederick to H street: along, and including,
H street to the ocean: along the ocean line to the San Mateo County line; along the
San Mateo County line to the bay; along the bay line to the point of beginning.
The total number of npw electric lights to be lnstallpd on the business streets under
these schedules Is 320. and the total number of gas lamps which would be dispensed with
is 11*2, or an average of nearly four gas lamps for each plectric light installed.
While the present rates of gas and electricity are excessive, and will undoubtedly be
reduced if the city Is divided Into districts and propÂ»r competition made possible, yt in
order to estimate "what will be the maximum cost of this Improvement. I have taken the
rates for the present contract as the basis upnn which to make these estimates. :
Cort per night of 3*Â» electric lights nt ES cents $ 180 93
Cost pef night of 1182 gas lamps at 12 cents 141 g*
Extra cost per right of electric lights 39 n
Extra cost per year of 365 nights $14,276 15
In other words it will, at the maximum, cost only $14,275 15 per
year to have all the business streets, in all parts of 'the city, well
lighted every night in the year by electricity instead of the glimmering
gas lamps, as at present, even if the rates are not reduced. The rates
should be reduced to such an extent that this proposed improvement
could be effected without increasing the appropriation.
The present contract xclÂ»h the city provides that the minimum number of gas lamps
â which the city will maintain shall be MOO. It is recommended that In the new contract
this minimum shall be 3T.00. In order to permit additional electric lights to be installed
In the residence district, when it is desirable to do so, and enough gas lamps can be dis
placed to cover the cost of the electric llehts so Installed.
It Is recommended that the names of streets shall be placed, as at present, upon the
ran lamps at street crossings and intersections, and that at all crossing and intersec
tions, at which electric, lights are placed, the names of the streets shall be placed and
maintained upon one of the poles upon which the electric light Is placed or from which
It is suspended. In the past, when pas lamps have been taken down and electric lights
substituted, no street signs have been provided by the company.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
v Several years ago I was troubled with an aggravated case of
dyspepsia and, of course, the first thing I did was to consult a physi-
cian., As I had always enjoyed the best of health I was worried a good
deal over this, my first illness, and my only desire was to get well as
speedily as I could. I took regularly all the medicines as my doctor
prescribed them. In a short time I felt all right, thought I was cured
and stopped taking the medicine. But it wasn't long before I was feel-
ing as badly as ever, and again I had recourse to the doctor. This
kept up for some time until at last I made up my mind I would quit
doctoring and try some of the remedies 1 saw advertised. I had read
so much of Ripans Tabules that I concluded I would give them
a good trial. It said 'one would give relief, 1 and I thought if one
could give relief a whole lot might cure me. I purchased a dollar's
worth, and when I had finished them I was feeling better than I had
for years. I continued to use them, and to-day I believe I am a per-
fectly well man. Once in a great while Ido have a slight touch of
the old malady, but a single Tabule fixes it all right I generalitf
keep a supply at home."
