WASHINGTON, April 20.â The text of the President's ultima
tum will not be given out here until it has been presented in Madrid
and McKinley has received notice of that fact from Minister
Woodford.
It embodies the demands of the resolutions passed by Congress
that Spain shall withdraw her army and navy from Cuba and Cu
ban waters at once, and the American Minister is instructed to im
press upon the Sagasta Government that he will not wait longer
than Saturday for his answer. There Is a dispute as to whether
the ultimatum runs by its terms until Saturday at noon or Sat
urday at midnight, but it is not thought probable the President
will attempt, as one statesman expressed it, "To hold a stop watch
on the Spanish Government."

He Is Permitted to
Do So.
MADRID, April 20.â Minister Woodford has received from the Pres
ident his ultimatum and will present It to the Spanish Government
to-morrow. The Spanish employes at the legation will pass the
night at Minister Woodford's residence.
After the opening session of the Cortes the Ministers met In coun
cil extraordinary and discussed exclusively naval and military mat
ters. No statement has been issued regarding the decisions reached.
After the council Senor Sagasta, the Premier, declared that the
Government had up to that time received nothing regarding the ulti
matum.
United States Minister Woodford has not yet asked for his pass
ports.
Herbert W. Bowen, American Consul-General at Barcelona, will
leave that city on Thursday, after transferring the papers of the
consulate to the British Consul.
The Ministerial paper, El Correo, says to-night: "When the ulti
matum is delivered Spain will worthily reply, stoutly defending her
honor.
LONDON, April 21.â The Madrid correspondent of the Daily Mall

south of France by the express to-morrow. He haa received exten

portunity of presenting the ultimatum since, in all probability, Senor
Gullon, the Foreign Minister, will send him his passports at 8 o'clock
to-morrow morning (Thursday) with, a declaration that diplomatic re
lations between the two governments have been broken off.
General Woodford has handed the archives of the legation to the
British Embassy, where he dined to-night.
The Republican minority met this afternoon and agreed to grant
the Government whatever measures might be necessary for war. Some
uneasiness is felt at the movements of Don Carlos, which are being
closely followed. It is asserted that the Government will not resort to
privateering.

SPAIN'S TORPEDO
FLEET NOW ON
THE HIGH SEAS
The Ships Sailed Away From the
Cape Verde Islands Yesterday
for Some Unknown
Destination.
NEW YORK, April 20. â The Washington correspondent of
the Herald sends the following: Spain's answer to President Mc-
Kinley's ultimatum may take the form of shot and shell. Her
formidable fleet, which has been mobilizing at Cape Verde Islands
for some days past, sailed to-day from that point for an unknown
destination. This information was received to-night by the at
taches of the late legation of Spain who have remained in this
city.
It is conceded to be highly probable that the fleet will hasten
across the ocean to Porto Rico and Cuba to prevent by force the
ousting from the islands of the naval and military forces of the
Spanish Government.
In order to ascertain the whereabouts of the Spanish vessels
it is probable that a swift man-of-war will be sent to Eastern
waters. As soon as they sight the enemy it will be their duty
to return and inform the Government of what they have seen,
when Commodore Schley's forces and those of Captain Sampson will
be gathered to administer a crushing blow to the enemy.
It is admitted to be possible that the vessels may not go to
Cuba or to Pcrto iiico, but may make a counter demonstration
against New York or one of the Northern ports, in which event it
would be necessary to draw ships away from the gulf coast to
give them battle. Officials say they will have plenty of time to
prepare for the Spanish fleet, as at least a week will be taken up
in making the distance between St. Vincent and Porto Rico.
ing, "'Will there be war ?"
Forcible intervention it will
be, and forcible intervention
means war, but President
McKinley still insists that
Spain shall fire the first shot.
The ports of Cuba will be
blockaded as a preliminary
movement for carrying out
the intervention plan. There
are such things as peaceful

blockades. If Spain does not
fire a shot while the block-
ading is in progress, the next
move will be to send a ship
laden with supplies and con
voyed by American warships
to Matanzas, where an effort
will be made to land them
and to distribute them to the
starving. A ship was char
tered to-day for this purpose.2
If war does not begin with
the blockading, Spain firing
the first shot when the at

supplies, the next step â the
landing of a large army to
drive the Spaniards from the
island â certainly will.
But the first shot
will no doubt come
long before an army

been landed upon the
island.
The navy must pave the
way for the army, and in doing
so there will doubtless be sea
fights and the bombardment

SPAIN'S PREPARATIONS
FOR OCEAN BATTLES
Gathering Her Fleets, It Is Be=
lieved, to Squarely Meet and
Fight Our Navy.
NEW YORK, April 20.â A Washington special to the Herald says.
Spain will further reinforce her squadron which left the, Cape \ erde
Islands to-day for some destination, unknown. Official information
has reached authorities here of the departure from Cadiz last Sun
day of the battle-ship Pelayo, which has just undergone extensive al
terations in France. It is expected that she will arrive at St. \m
cent to-morrow or Friday. The authorities have also been advised of
the sailing from Ferrol yesterday of the armored cruiser Carlos V,
whose destination is officially reported to be unknown. It is be
lieved in naval circles that she is bound for St. Vincent and will per
haps stop en route at Cadiz and the Canary Islands. Spain's action
in collecting such a formidable fleet at St. Vincent has been the sub
ject of considerable and anxious speculation at the Navy Department,
and it will receive consideration at the meeting of the strategic
board which will be held to-morrow morning. The fleet might be
able to dispose of Commodore Sch ley's flying squadron which con
sists of the first-class battle-ship Massachusetts, second-class battle
ship Texas, armored cruiser Brooklyn and protected cruisers Minneap
olis and Columbia.
In consequence of the collection of such a formidable force at St.
Vincent one thing is certain, the flying squadron will not be sent to
operate agair-t it until reinforced by the battle-ships and cruisers of
Captain Sampson's fleet, and it is not at all certain to-night that
this Government will be hasty in dispatching its vessels to eastern
waters. If Spain should use Cape Verde Islands as a base of ope
rations in time of war, Portugal will be called to account by the
United States. Cape Verde Islands belong to the Lisbon Government,
which recently informed the United States that â¢ had rejected prop
ositions by Spain to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance
and proposed to remain strictly neutral. Portugal will be expected to
carry out her intention in this respect. Her neutrality obligations will
permit her to give to Spanish vessels only sufficient coal to enable
them to reach the next Spanish port, -which in this case would be the
Canary Islands, and once they have left that port they cannot return
for coal or provisions.
"I expect that the Spanish fleet will leave St. Vincent immediate
ly after war is declared," said a well-known naval expert to me to
day, "and its destination would be unknown. There would be a
great scare in the United States, as it would be believed that they
are en route for Porto Rican or Cuban waters, possibly for one of the
coast cities, but in four or five da>s they will turn up at the Canaries
and there I believe they will remain to give the American fleet a
warm reception upon its arrival. It will be of interest to the United
States' forces to occupy one of the Canary Islands and establish a
coal supply there. Coal could be carried by colliers now being pre
pared to accompany the fleet. It looks to me as though Spain is
gathering her forces in order to give the United States navy a good
stand-up fight, and if she is defeated she will rely on the squadron
at Cadiz as her second line of defense. I don't think her men-of-war
will come westward, for being far from ttyeir base, they would be at a
disadvantage."
Spain's tactics ought to be to wait for American ships, which in
eastern waters would be at the same disadvantage that her ships
would be in the west, to follow up the advantage she may gain. Al
though Spain's second torpedo-boat flotilla was reported to be pre
paring to start some days ago no report of its departure from Cadiz
has been announced. This flotilla consists of the converted yacht
Ger"alda, the torpedo-boat destroyers Destructor, Prosperina and
Osada and the torpedo-boats Halcon, Habana, Retamos, Barcelona
and Orcon. Much to the relief of the officials here the latest re
ports concerning the condition of Spanish gun vessels under construc
tion in Spain show that but one, the Dona Maria del Melina, will be
abie to participate in the coming war. The Marques de la Victoria
will not be ready before December, and the Don Alvaro de Bazan
cannot be completed before next February. The armored cruiser Prin
cesa de Asturias is receiving her armor at Carraca and the Cardinal,
Cisneroa and Catajuna will not be completed under eight months.
The protected cruiser Lepanto is building, and the protected cruiser
Reina Regente is soon to undergo her dock trials.

MINISTER WOODFORD'S TASK
IS NOW VIRTUALLY ENDED
Although It Is Reported He Will Leave Madrid
Within a Day, He Is to Remain Until
the Last Moment.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, April 20.â Although Minister Woodford would not depart from the rule of sphinx-like silence
which he followed, when I called at the legation it was plain that he considered his task virtually ended. It
is even reported that he will leave within twenty-Tour hours, though you may be sure he will remain until the
last minute that duty calls upon him to do so. There is not the slightest probability that any manifestation
will be directed against Minister Woodford by the people here, but the closest guard is being kept to prevent
any mischance, and it is certain that the authorities will breathe easier when he is safely over the frontier.
His task has been an unpalatable one to Spain, yet he has managed to perform it in a way that has com
manded respect.
El Heraldo, in an article headed "A la Guerra," says: "In one moment all the confusion has ceased.
Spain is proud of her position and posterity will honor a country which has no fear."
The Correspondencia says: "It is not only cruel but infamous that the United States should pretend with
pharasaical hypocrisy to intervene in Cuba in the name of humanity, sacrificing thereby, without cause, thou
sands and thousands of men."
El Dia considers it possible that the will of the Cubans may alter the situation.
El Correro hopes that President McKinley may find means for delay which would give a chance for
peace.
camps will be maintained and
reinforcements will be for
warded from them to the
armies in the field as rapidly
as they are needed.
The President's ultimatum
was sent to the Spanish Min
ister to- day by Judge Day's
personal messenger, Edward
Savoy, one of the trusted em
ployes of the State Depart
ment, who was appointed to
his place in 1869 by Hamil
ton Fish.
The messenger was not
kept waiting long at the lega
tion, but in the course of an
hour had returned to the State
Department with the Minis
ter's application for his pass
ports. It was not until half
past 3 o'clock this afternoon
that Savoy made his second
trip, carrying with him the
desired paper. This was a
passport for the Minister, his
family and his suite. It was
not in the usual form, but
was what is known as a spe
cial passport. In general
terms, it is similar to that

At first there was some ex-
pectation at the State Depart
ment that a response from
Minister Woodford might be
received to-day. Later on,
however, after Judge Day had
calculated the length of time
that would be consumed in the
cabling of the ultimatum to
Minister Woodford, its trans
lation into cipher and retrans
lation, he became convinced
that it would 'be practically
impossible, owing to the dif
ference in time between
Washington and Madrid, to
receive any response to-day.
The next move must be
made by Spain, according to
the department officials. If
the Spanish Governmenttakes
a view, as might be possibly
be concluded from the action

that in language and terms

TO BEGIN WARLIKE
OPERATIONS AT ONCE
How It Is Proposed to Form a
Union of Regulars and Vol=
unteers to Invade Cuba.
NEW YORK, April 20.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald sends the following: Immediate offensive operations against the
Spanish power in Cuba will be the military policy of the administra
tion. This was determined this afternoon at an important war con
ference at the White House betwen the President, Secretaries Alger
and Long, Major General Miles, commanding the army. Lieutenant
General Schofield, retired, and Captain A. S. Crowninshield, chief of
the bureau of navigation of the Navy Department.
The general campaign plans formulated by the various army and
navy boards were thoroughly discussed and though the War Depart
ment authorities will not divulge the plans in detail it is officially an
nounced that the organization of the military forces is to proceed most
vigorously and an aggressive movement is contemplated for the ear
liest opportune moment.
Major General Miles to-day received General Estrada Palma, Senor
Gonzola de Quesada and other representatives of the Cuban junta and
discussed at length with them the military conditions in Cuba and plans
for conducting the operations of the United States army in conjunc
tion with the insurgent forces under General Maximo Gomez. The re
sults of the conference are understood to have been entirely satis
factory to General Miles and the Cuban representatives.
Orders have been issued by Secretary Alger and Major General
Miles to the general officers commanding divisions concentrated in the
South to proceed with all possible expedition and thoroughness in the
organization and field maneuvers of the forces under them.
President McKinley will issue a proclamation calling for 80,000 vol
unteers Immediately after he has signed the volunteer army bill, which
is expected to pass the Senate to-morrow. A separate call for militia
organizations of various States In proportion to their population will
also probably be made. This latter call will be for organizations to
support artillery posts on the coast and for general military service
within the United States. Many of the. National Guard organizations
are expected to enlist in the United States volunteer army by com
panies and regiments and may carry with them into the United States
service ,their officers up to and including the rank of colonel.
As stated in the Herald, those who enlist in the volunteer army,
whether National Guardsmen or not, will by so doing identify them
selves exclusively with a portion of the United States army and as
such will be attached to divisions which will be assigned to the invasion
of Cuba. In effect the military force of the country will consist of
two branches, one of which, composed of the union of the Unit<-^ States
regular and volunteer armies, will be liable to foreign service. The
other branch, composed of National Guards, who retain their State
organizations, will not leave United States territory. The general vol
unteer rendezvous wfci be at Chickamauga.
The plans of the department contemplate the organization of art
army of occupation of Cuba on a basis of brigades consisting of one
regiment of regulars and two regiments of volunteers. Colonel Green
leaf of the Medical Department, now stationed at San Francisco, has
been ordered East to be assigned as medical director of the armies in
the field. Captain P. Y. Seyburn, Tenth Infantry, has been ordered to
report to General Miles for duty. These assignments complete the staff
of the army in the field, which is composed of these officers: Lieuten
ant Colonel J. C. Gilmore, adjutant general; Brigadier General Joseph
C. Breckinridge, inspector general; Lieutenant Colonel F. C. Humph
rey, chief quartermaster; Major Henry B. Osgood, chief commissary of
subsistence; Colonel C. R. Greenleaf, medical director; Lieutenant
Colonel William Ludlow, chief engineer officer, and Captain Leonard
and Captain Wood, attending surgeons.
and cause a breach of diplo
matic relations within the
next twenty-four hours. If,
on the other hand, it should
neglect to return a satisfactory
answer before Saturday noon,
that line of policy will be
quite as effective as a posi-
tive act.
TO BOMBARD NEW YORK
WHEN WAR BEGINS.
That Is the Story Sent by a Spanish
Political Agent About the
Cape Verde Fleet.
NEW YORK, April 20.â The Times
says: An English army officer living
at San Francisco has just received
from a prominent Spanish political
agent in New York a letter relating to
the plans of the Spanish fleet. The
agent writes that he procured some
months ago copies of the official plans
of the fortifications of New York har
bor and dispatched them to his Govern
ment. These plans, he says, are now
in the possession of the admiral of the
Spanish fleet now at Cape Verde
Islands.
The agent states that Spain has
withdrawn all her good vessels from
Cuban waters, because she does not
propose to make any defense of Cuba,
except by means of forts, and that all
the available Spanish naval strength
will be concentrated at Cape Verde
Islands. The agent intimates that the
fleet, commanding 118 guns, will be dis
patched direct for New York when it
is seen war is certain. Transports
loaded with coal will be taken along,
bo after the run across the ocean ves
sels could be coaled one or two days
out from New York. The fleet would
then anchor in a body off Coney Island,
where it would be exposed to no dan
gerous fire, and bombard New York.
To Protect Miner-Soldiers.
WASHINGTON, April 20.â Senator
Shoup of Idaho to-day introduced a
bill in the Senate providing that where
a miner enlists in the volunteer army,
thereby rendering it impossible for
him to do the annual assessment work
on his claims, as now required by stat
ute, this failure on his part shall not
result in tc.feiture of his claims.
COMMENT OF
LONDON PRESS
See No Hope for Spain
in the Impending
Conflict.
United States Has Right on Its
Side and Englishmen
Sympathize.
One Editor Says the American Con
gress Could Learn a Lesson
From the Cortes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 20.â The Times says
editorially this morning: "At the open
ing of the Cortes the wildest enthusi
asm prevailed, and the American ulti
matum may almost be said to have been
answered by anticipation. The Queen
Regent's speech, couched in dignified
and even touching language, breathes
an unalterable determinatiio to fight
to the death for the honor and dignity
of Spain. Unless Spain keeps com
mand of the sea to such an extent as to
be able to land provisions and muni
tions of war at Havana the game is
lost so far as Cuba is concerned.
"Whether the struggle be brief or
protracted, there can be as little doubt
of the result as of the direction in
â¢which He the sympathy and hopes of
the English people."
The Daily Graphic says: "Apart from
the merits of the controversy between
the two countries, one cannot but rec
ognize the dignity and courage with
which the Spanish people comforts it
self in the hour of crisis. The American
Congress might well take a lesson from
the Cortes."
The Morning Post says: "The Span
lards will not accept humiliation, and
therefore there will be a war. That
the United States were justified in ex
erting their influence in favor of the
pacification of Cuba can hardly be de
nied."
The Daily News says: "Sentiment
must not blind Spain to the fact that
in this struggle for human freedom the
United States have the right on their
side."
The Standard says: "We cannot
doubt that the enthusiastic cheers
which broke out at the end of the
Queen Regent's speech truly represents
Spanish feeling. But the ultimate issue
Is hardly open to question, nor can
there be any doubt that in the end It
will be good for Cuba that she should
be delivered from Spanish domina
tion."
LIBERAL POLICY IN
TREATING NEUTRALS.
Privateering Not to Be Resorted to,
and Only Contraband of War
Liable to Seizure.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â An outline
of the policy to be followed by this
Government In the treatment of neu
trals and the matter of privateering is
contained in the following statement:
"In the event of hostilities between
the United States and Spain, it will be
the policy of this Government not to
resort to privateering. The Govern
ment will adhere to the following
rules:
"First â Neutral flag covers the ene
my's ships with the exception of con
traband of war. Second â Neutral
goods not contraband of war are not
liable to confiscation under the enemy's
flag. Thirdâ Blockades to be binding
must be effective."
This doctrine is undoubtedly laid
down to meet the various inquiries re
ceived by the diplomatic representa
tives of the United States for foreign
governments as to the attitude as
sumed by the United States. It is sub
stantially in line with the rules prac
ticed in the recent Chino-Japanese war,
and places the United States in a most
advanced position so far as the protec
tion of individual property and neutral
goods at sea is concerned. By it
Spanish goods are made free from
seizure on the seas in the bottoms of
a neutral power. This decision on the
part of our Government will be wel
comed in Europe.
PASSENGER OFFICIALS
DISCUSS WAR TAX.
Divided as to Whether It Should Be
Borne by Railroads or Ticket
Buyers.
CHICAGO, April 20.â Passenger offi
cials of the roads centering in Chicago
are divided on the question as to
whether the railroads or the purchaser
of tickets should pay the tax to be im
posed by the Government in case of
war. Some are of the opinion that the
maximum rate law effective in some
States will prevent them from adding
anything to the present price of tick
ets, and others say that the increase
will not be an increase in the price of
tickets, but will be a tax, and that the
Government and the passengers can
settle the matter between them, and
that as far as State laws on the sub
ject of maximum rates are concerned,
the law from the Government will take
precedence over any enactment by
State Legislatures.
Another question is whether the tax
will be made to cover all fares paid for
transportation or simply tickets sold.
If the latter construction is the rule
the roads say they will sell very few
tickets over the counter and that nine
out of ten passengers will pay their
fare on trains in order to avoid the
tax which would be imposed upon them
if they bought their tickets outright at
the regular offices.

arations continue. The Centro Gal
lego Society has given up several
houses belonging to it for use by the
Government in case of war.
The Union Constitutional, in an edi
torial to-day, commenting upon the
resolutions adopted by the United
States Congress, says: "Intervention
means war for Spain. But it is easier
to vote than to execute." Continuing,
the Union Constitutional remarks: "So
far Spain has treated the United States
with contempt. Now she will kick her
and use the whip."
The steamer Madrileno and the Mexi
can schooner Arturo arrived here yes
terday.
Although the Plant line steamers
have suspended their trips between
Tampa and Havana, possibly fearing
seizure in the event of hostilities, Cap
tain-General Blanco has notified Mr.
Alexander Gollan, the British Consul,
who is acting in behalf of the United
States, that, even in the case of war,
vessels sailing under a neutral flag
would be entered.

TO SEfD A BATTALION.

BUENOS AYRES, April 20.â The
correspondent of the Herald in Rio
Janeiro states that there is great en
thusiasm there among Spaniards, who
are about to organize a battalion to
send to Cuba to aid the Spanish au
thorities there. The authorities, how
ever, are in sympathy with the United
States and will prevent anything that
may affect neutrality. The Secretary
of the American legation has hoisted
a United States flag on the dynamite
cruiser Nictheroy, which has been pur
chased by the United States.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
DARKNESS TO LIBHT,
Every day and every week some family in this town and elsewhere on the
coast emerges from the dark cloud of a credit system into the marvelous light
of cash buying. The change is wonderful. From debts and collectors hour-
ly every day you have the comforting assurance that you "owe no man
anything." This may not be done in a week, as credit buying always gets
one behind-hand, but you can make the resolve now and put it in practice,
too â pay up the old scores as fast as you can and pay down the cash for every-
thing you buy. Your wants will decrease like magic and your ability to sup-
ply them Vill multiply continually. Happiness and peace will reign in the
home when no debts hang over it.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 20.â At the Easter
banquet at the Mansion House to-night
His Royal Highness, the Duke of Cam
bridge, most of the members of the di
plomatic corps and many other high
officials were present. United States
Embassador Hay's seat was at the left
hand of Lord Mayor Davies and to thÂ«
Spanish Embassador, Count Rascon,
was allotted the place at the right hand,
but at the last moment Count Rascon
wrote that a sudden indisposition
would prevent his being present. The
talk of the evening was the expected
presence of the representatives of the
United States and Spain, and much dis
appointment was felt by the Spanish
Embassador's absence. The Consuls
of the United States and Spain were
present.
Lord Mayor Davies, when proposing
the health of the members of the diplo
matic corps, welcomed the United
States Embassador and expressed the
hope, "in the name of the citizens of
London," that there would be no war.
Colonel Hay's reply was the event of
the evening. He was repeatedly ap
plauded by the company. Speaking of
the relations between the United States
and Great Britain he said: "We are
sometimes accused of looking out for
our own interests with a certain energy
and pertinacity. I might say, in the
spirit of pride rather than contrition,
that it only shows what stuck we are
of. but this truth is incontestable, that
for nearly three generations of men,
and in spite of constant differences,
there has been peace between us and
friendly regard â a peace growing more
firm and solid as the years go by and a
friendship which I ami sure the vast
majority of both people hope and trust
may last forever.
"The good understanding between us
is based on something deeper than mere
expediency. All who think cannot but
see there is a sanction like that of re
ligion which binds us in partnership in
the serious work of the world.
"Whether we will or not, we are asso
ciated in that work by the very nature
of things, and no man, and no group of
n â¢-â¢n, can prevent it. We are bound by
ties we did not forge and that we can
not break. We are joint ministers in
the same sacred mission of freedom
and progress, charged with duties we
cannot evade by the imposition of ir
resistible hands."

FAREWELL
YESTERDAY will long linger in memory
as the golden day when the First United
States Infantry marched forth from quiet,
woody places in the picturesque Presidio to
fight for the principles of government announced
by an American President and backed by an
American Congress.
From the moment the soldiers strapped on
their haversacks and canteens and marched to
the parade grounds to the wild, inspiring music
of war until they reached the ferries they were
greeted with cheers from thousands of patriotic
men, women and children.
Twice ten thousand adieus were waved
from twice ten thousand spots where sightseers
had gathered to wave flags and cheer â flags in
the hands of babes in arms, and flags in the hands
of old women at the gates, who cheered and cried
as they were reminded of the stormy times when
they bade farewell to their own sons and kissed
their pictures when they had gone, never to re
turn.
In many of its phases yesterday's scene was
the past enacted again â sorrowful farewells,
wishes of good luck and fears of loved ones who
remain at home.
Shortly after 2 o'clock the First Infantry as
sembled in response to bugle sounds, presenting
a picturesque sight as they marched to the east
side of the upper parade grounds and formed in
regimental order. The good-byes had been said
to sweethearts, mothers, sisters, wives, com
rades of the garrison and lingering friends. Sud
denly the eight companies marched in quick
step, heedless of everything save the commands
of officers.
At Van Ness avenue and Lombard the sol
diers halted, formed in platoons, consulted with
the Chief of Police through his aids, then wheel
ed into Van Ness avenue, headed by 200 po
licemen. From this point to the ferries the pro
cession was a continuous ovation. The soldiers
marched through a rose wilderness of flowers,
while thousands of bouquets and wreaths waved
above them, the soft April sky brooding over all,
opalescent and as beautiful as a dream.
The music of the First Infantry band was
stirringly sweet and thrillingly suggestive of pa
triotic impulse-,, now sending forth the melodies
of old war tunes, then bursting forth in Sousa's
marches, and again returning to Dixie and the
camp tunes of long ago. It was a scene never
to be forgotten either by the soldiers who went
forth to offer up their lives for the flag or by
those who cheered them as they passed
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1898.
STATE TROOPS FIRST.
Governor Eudd Wi'l Order the
Quota From the National
Guard.
If the President calls on the
Governor for troops, ,as he un
doubtedly will, Governor Budd
will direct the major-general to
order out from the National
Guard as an organization the
number required. This gives
all the promptness required in
respect to the President's call
and the organized, disciplined
and equipp "'d condition of the
guardsmen. Guardsmen when
called out as such by the Gov
ernor are entitled to $2 per day
from the State. The amount
received from the United States
Government would of course be
deducted from this, so that the
State would be paying but
about 544 per month per man.
The $2 per day would make
provision for the families of
the National Guardsmen, with
out putting much of a tax
upon their employers. Other
wise there must be great hard
ship. Those who go as volun
teers will not receive the same
recompense, as they must be
paid exclusively by the United
States. The amount paid by the
State is provided by an act of
the Legislature, which was
passed for the encouragement
of the National Guardsmen as
such, and to induce them to
serve for years before a call,
devoting their time and their
money in this behalf â each
guardsman drilling fifty nights
a yearâ the act giving assur
ance of the payment of the
amount specified to the fami
lies of the guardsmen in case
of war.
THE COLUMN
OF INFANTRY
The White Horse Cavalry
Escorts the Command
From the Presidio.
There was a stir of preparation at the
Presidio at an early hour yesterday,
for the boys in blue of the First United
States Infantry were to leave on orders
to fight for their < -lntry. Before noon
there were several hundred civilians on
the grounds â little children in white
gathering wild 11 wers, soldiers -wan
dering forth for the last time with those
they love, small boys waving Hags
whose meaning they little understood,
while Bong birds poured forth their
wealth of melody from the throats of
rusty cannons used as ornaments on
the grounds.
A former English cavalry officer who
was present when the soldiers assem
bled on the upper parade ground said:
"They are as tine a drilled body of men
as I ever saw, for every movement is a
poem."
That sentiment was in the hearts of
all who witnessed the departure of the
pride of California for the scenes of
future conflict. The scene was inspir
ing from start to finish, the music and
the marching appealing to the patriot
ism of all as "Good luck!" was cried
out all along the -me from the Presidio
to the ferries. The start was made at
2:20.
Every soldier marched as if his heart
was in the cause, and t was a beauti
ful sight to behold Captain Lockett's
troop I of the Fourth Cavalry escort
the infantry to their point of embarka
tion.
At the turn of every road there were
volumes of cheers, and the sight along
the winding paths of the Presidio was
as fine as was ever witnessed in the
State. Along the line of march be
tween the Presidio and Van Ness ave
nue the soldiers were greeted by the
ringing of bells and the blowing of
whistles, as well as by voliuaes of
cheers. By the time the procession had
reached Van Ness avenue the streets
were alive with spectators and the
cheering was begun with renewed
vigor.
Last January California celebrated
the semi-centennial anniversary of her
statehood with a parade of thousands
Of soldiers ana civilians along the same
streets traveled yesterday by the First
Infantry on its way to the front. On
that occasion, too, Colonel Miles' com
mand turned out, and exceedingly
handsome and soldierly the i..en looked
in their dress coats and stiff helmets,
proving one of the most attractive feat
ures <>f the display.
An immense crowd â estimated to be
the largest ever assembled on the great
boulevard â lined the sidewalks of \';ir.
Ness avenue and heartily applauded
the regiment that from long association
has become dear to San Franciscans.
That event had been advertised for
weeks; almost every county in the
State contributed to its picturesque
ness and hardly a city, town or village
but sent its quota to swell the crowd.
But yesterday, with barely forty
eight hours' notice and with no pre
paration whatever beyond an invita
tion to the school children to assemble
a far greater crowd choked the broad
avenue until it was only with the great
est difficulty that the police and cavalry
escort could clear a passage for the
regiment.
At Lombard street, where the col
umn swung into Van Ness avenue, a
battalion of police, under command of
Chief Lees, with Lieutenant Birdsall
acting as his adjutant, was drawn up
in column of platoons, ready to escort
the gallant First to the ferry. There
were three companies â A, B and C â
under command of Captains Wittman,
Spillane and Gillen, respectively, the
platoc-n:; being in charge of Sergeants
George B. Baldwin, Martin, Conboy,
Brophy, Perrin, Campbell and Mona
han. At -:i~> o'clock the soldiers, head
ed by the cavalry troop, wheeled Into
the avenue, the police took the lead,
and to the strains of "Tenting on the
Old Campground," the grand march in
review of the tens of thousands began.
The change in the appearance of the
regiment Horn the parade of last Janu
ary was striking. The dress coats had
given way to service-stained fatigue
blouses; drab slouch hats replaced the
heavy helmets; the neat-fitting trous
ers were partly concealed by brown
canvas leggings, while the roll of blan
kets, canteen, haversack and other ac
couterments did not add to the sym
metry of the lines. The dress parade
soldier had disappeared and in his
place marched the country's defender,
fully pano-piied for war.
He was admired before; yesterday he
was lovedâ yes, worshiped. Where it
was well-bred applause then, it w.s
cheering continuous and deafening
from one end of the street to the other
now. And the cheers were not confined
to the children. Men swung their hats,
canes, handkerchiefs, and yelled like
demons: women, from the bewitching
bud to the whitened grandmother, cast
all restraint to the winds, and, rray
>p, for the first time in their lives,
gave full Vent to their emotions.
Looking down the avenue to Gulden
Gate from the crest of the hill at Jack
son street, the sight wes thrilling be
yond description. Myriads of tiny flags
fluttered in the breeze, while fro-m the
buildings either side far out into the
street was a solid mass of people, a
narrow passage way down the center
alone being kept clear for the men.
With the appearance of the police a
cheer arose that swelled into a roar
when the cavalry escort forced its way
through the multitude and grew still
louder in volume as the glistening lines
of muskets swt-pt o-ver the hill like
successive billows on the sea-
Banners waved from every window
and in almost every- hand; flowers fell
upon the brave boys in blue thicker
than bulls'. : could be poured L. by any
foe; tears coursed down the cheeks of
staid citizens and proud dames until it
seemed as though there must be a sud
den collapse of the enthusiasm. But
it only grew with the advance of the
recipients.
Proudly the men sped along, scarce
looking to right' or left, and never a
break except when a hand was
stretched forth to receive from a by
standerâsometimes a little school girl,
again a richly gowned womanâ a bunch
of Bowers. Then the muzzle of the sol
dier's musket was called upon to do
duty as a vase, and by the time Market
street was reached almost every piece
in the command was thus adorned.
Wilder grew the enthusiasm and
more furiously rained the blossoms as
the column neared Golden Gate
avenue, where the crouds were
densest. It would be a marvel if the
soldier who less than an hour before
had kissed wife and babes good-by at
the Presidio should not for the mo
ment forget the tear-stained faces he
had left behind and exult at the pa
triotic demonstration over him.
While riding down Van Ness avenue
at the head of his regiment Colonel
Miles was captured by a band of
maidens, who decked his charger with
a magnificent wreath of roses. For a
moment the old hero's lip quivered and
his gantleted hand made a sudden
dash across his eyes. He could only
bow his acknowledgments as he re
sumed his march. A short distance
further the colonel was halted again,
this time by a handsome little fellow of
3 or 4 years, v hd, perched upon his
father's shoulder, held a beautiful
silken flag which he pressed into the
warrior's hand. A caressing pat on the
cheek in return and again the colonel
pressed on, carefully tucking the em
blem in his breast. These were only a
few of the incidents; it would require
a page to tell all.
Golden Gate avenue contained al
most as great a crowd as the wide;
thoroughfare, and so congested was the
Street that police, cavalrymen and in
fantrymen were obliged to break into
column of fours. The cheers swept
down the street ahead of the troops
like a mighty wave, telling those on
Market street that the men they had
gathered to pay homage to were com
ing.
Prom Golden Gate avenue to the
ferries Market stivet was packed al
most from curb to curb with a mass of
patriotic humanity that waited patient
ly for the moment to arrive to give
demonstrative greeting to the little
band of soldiers who are to bear their
share of the first shock of coming war.
Not less than 100,000 people were con
gregated between the points named,
and" not less than one-third of them
carried small flags. The fluttering
bunting and the gay costumes of the
ladies made as brave a show as ever
fired the hearts of the nation's de
fenders.
Although the troops did not reach
Market street until 3:30 o'clock the
waiting thousands held their places
with steady patience and sought to
gain such amusement as was to be
had from the circumstances called into
being by the occasion. The appear
ance of a band of make-believe sol
diers, ranging in age from seven to 10
years, was greeted with cheers that be
tokened a full appreciation of the mar
tial spirit that actuated the youngsters.
With laths for swords, vagrant bits of
variegated bunting for uniforms and a
tin can for a drum the young patriots
marched down the street with the dig
nity and assurance of veterans, appar
ently unconscious of the attention they
were attracting.
Another star attraction for the wait
ing multitude was a beautiful St. Ber
nard dog whose back was covered with
a canvas blanket on which was in
scribed the words, "T'll with Spain."
This sentiment seemed to strike a re
sponsive chord in the hearts of those
who waited, for the dog and his juve
nile master were greeted with an ova
tinn as they pnssed down the line. It
was :i suggestive incident, showing the
IV. Ling that has quickened tne public
pulse ;md made possible such a demon
stration as that witnessed yesterday. A
conspicuous figure that attracted much
attention was that of a butcher's ap
prentice, who stood on the edge of the
overhanging cornice of a building and
awaited the approach of the troops. He
still wore his soiled apron, but he had
wrapped a piece of red, white and blue
bunting about his body until, as he
stood there outlined against the sky,
he looked like a very sturdy and very
picturesque statue of Liberty.
The temper of the crowd was made
evident when, long before the appear
ance of the troops, three trucks, each
drawn by four horses and piled high
with camp equipage and stores for the
troops, passed down Market street on
their way to the ferry. Each truck
was accompanied by two or three sol
diers in uniform and these were greet
ed with cheers that must have been
gratifying to the ears of the boys in
blue.
When the body of police that pre
ceded the troops turned from Golden
Gate avenue into Market street the fac
was heralded by a cheer that acted or.
the multitude of people between that
point and the ferries like a spark on a
train of powder. The cheer was taken
up by the waiting thousands and from
one end of the street to the other there
swepjt a wave of sound that fired the
heart and sent the blood racing through
one's veins. It was but the prelude oÂ£
the vociferous bravos that greeted the
warriors as they passed on their way
through the narrow lane between the
two solid walls of humanity. Mer?
shouted themselves hearse and maids
and matrons vied with each other in
making oral and physical demonstra
tions of their love and pride for the
brave boys who will risk their lives In
defense of the nation's honor. .It waa
a sight that was good to see. and one
that will live long in the memories of
those who were so fortunate as to wit
ness it.
The most impressive scene along the
line of march occurred when the troops
n .v hed the foot of Market street. The
vanguard of police formed in single
column line along the south side of the
street, as did the troop of cavalry that
preceded the body cf infantry. Then,
as the troops marched past in review,
they were saluted by the city blue
coats and the troopers. Cheer after
cheer was given and returned with a
will that spoke volumes for the broth
erly love bet%veen those who were go
ing to repel a foreien foe and those
who remained to protect the home and
fireside. The soldier boys marched into
the building on their way to the boats
that were to take them across the bay,
and the cheers that followed them were
like a benediction.
The regular 4 o'clock boat carried the
regiment over and with it as many peo
ple as could crowd the decks. The band
wheeled aside as it reached the apron
and then played its liveliest while the
regiment hurried past.
As the head of the column stepped on
board the people onAhe boat raised a
cheer that was taken up on the wharf
uhere others could hear but not see,
nor would they let the cheer die down
until the regiment had embarked. They
cheered each company, they cheered
each man almost; they more than
cheered the flag as it came on board
and they went into fits of enthusiasm
over everything martial they saw.
When the boat pulled out those on the
piles of the slip commenced to shout
and as she ran out Into the stream the
cry ran along the wharves like a prairie
fire until the whole water front re
sounded with the mighty farewell.
Lying at Mission pier was the three
masted schooner Alga, and she seemed
the center of the cheer, for her decks
were black with people and her rigging
was dotted with men hanging on with
hands and feet and eyebrows.
The factories along the front added
their steam whistles to the din; a
bustling little tug tooted its loudest;
an ocean steam schooner Joined and
then the revenue cutters Grant and
Corwin turned loose with a cheer from
the men and a blast of shrieking steam.
But the ordinary steam whistles
faded into an echo when the utonterey
opened up her wailing siren. The men
formed at quarters aft of her after
turret and then after a few preliminary
coughs to clear her throat she joined
the chorus of the city's farewell and
sang the loudest and longest of them
all. Her siren call is like the cry of a
caged hurricane, deep, piercing, mourn
ful and prolonged, and the fact that
she, too, may soon find use for more
than her siren added emphasis to the
boisterous sung she sang.
As the boat neared the Oakland slip
the enthusiasm of the thousands on the
boat started up again. The flag was
cheered; the "boys in blue,"' "Colonel
Miles and the gallant First" and â¢ a
tiger for good luck to all its men.
There were two trains waiting at the
mole, and the men were at once as
signed to their places in the cars. The
train was to go in two sections, and
but one Pullman had been provided
for the officers, but when the firs:
tion got as far as Sixteenui street a
second Pullman was added to it. There
was a third section composed of freight
cars, which, being too big to handle,
overflowed on to the troop trains, add
ing five cars of horses and mules to
each.
Every one expected an early start,
but it did not come. The crowds hung
around the trains, and friends who had
said good-by on every previous occa
sion took advantage of the wait and
sought once more the boys that were
to be taken away.
Most of the men who had no more
farewells to say made themselves as
comfortable as possible in the cars.
They were very quiet, and they showed
how much they disliked leaving the
city that had been their home so long.
They are afraid they will not come
back againâ even what is left of them
should they go to warâ for they say
twelve years in one place is a tour of
duty that seldom falls to a regiment.
The thought that in any event they
have seen San Franc jseo with all its
virtues and faults fur the last time is
what grieves them most.
The last of the freight was late to
arrive at the yards, and so hour after
hour the two trains waited. Then the
overland drew out. and ten minutes
later the first section, carrying the
first battalion under Lieutenant-Colo
nel Bisbee drew out. There were not
many people left then, but those who
were there all had friends on the
trains, and so the farewell that filled
the big barn-like depot lost nothing
from the lack of numbers.
. Then there was another wait to give
the first section a chance to get clear,
and then the second section, composed
of twenty cars, drew away. Fifteen
minutes later, with many a toot and
wheeze and cough, the freight section
started, and the blinking of its red end
light as it swung around the curve was
the last good-by of the First.

WITH THE
BALLOT-BOX
Many Stormy Scenes 1
at a Democratic
Meeting.
Blows Struck, but No
Serious Damage

After a Hard Struggle the Po

Factions. '
R. MANN'S STATEMENT.
Claims That a Determined Attempt
WaÃ Made to Do Him
Up.
The Democratic meeting in the
Thirty-fourth District last night was
replete with disgraceful scenes which
finally culminated in one of the "push"
getting away with the ballot-box. Had
It not been for the presence of several
of Captain Gillin's men serious trouble
would have occurred.
The meeting which was called for the
purpose of effecting a permanent or
ganization and also to elect twenty
members to represent the district in the
General Committee was held in Mis-
Bion Turner Hall on Eighteenth street,
between Valencia and Guerrero.
There were two tickets in the field.
One was headed by John L. Herget,
professionally known as Young Mitch
ell, and the other by Robert Mann, As
sistant Prosecuting Attorney in Judge
Conlan's court.
When the balloting commenced a
gang of ward heelers surged around
the box and attempted to prevent the
respectable residents of the district
from voting. Mann's adherents, realiz
ing that they were "up against it," as
one of them expressed it, called upon
the policemen who were present to see
that they got a square deal.
The minions of the law, acting under
instructions from Captain Gillin. re
fused to interfere with the balloting,
but announced that they were prepared
t" Dreserve the peace at all hazards.

Just as the opposing factions were
about to clash a man named 'Jim '
Fennell, who is connected with the '
School Department, rushed upon the
stage, and, seizing the ballot-box,
threw it to a confederate. The latter
attempted to get away with it, but was
seized by a police officer, who took the
box from him.
Subsequently it was taken to the Sev
enteenth-street station and turned over
to Captain Gillin.
There were several lively scrimmages
after the box waj taken by the police,
but no serious harm was done.
Mann was sorely grieved at what he
termed the desperate methndsemployed
by the push.
"I was told yesterday," he remarked
when discussing the theft of the bal
lot box, "that a gang of ward heelers
and toughs would attend the meeting
for the purpose of seeing that Herget
was elected. Several of my friends
warned me to be extremely cautious,
I as the push would not hesitate at com-
I mitting murder to gain their end.
"After the polls opened I realized
that the 'push' was determined to
elect Herget. They gathered around
the ballot-box and refused to allow any
of my friends to vote for me.
"When a battle seemed imminent
Fennell, so T am told, seized the box
j and threw it into the wings to the right
lof the stage. Just as his confederate
vas about to get away with it several
police officers grabbed it and afterward
took it to the Seventeenth c t eet sta-.
tion."
Mann's friends say they >vill cause
the arrest of Fennell to-day on a
charge of malicious mischief.
MISS DAISY WRIGHT
BECOMES A BRIDE.
Marriage of a Young Lady Who Was
Born in Monterey's Old
Custom-House.
PACIFIC GROVE, April 20.â A quiet
home wedding occurred here this morn
ing, the principals in which are persons
of prominence in this portion of the State. I
Miss Daisy D. Wright was married at !
tho home of her parents. Captain and
Mrs. Jonathan Wright, to Cornelius A.
Culp, formerly of San Felipe but now a
resident of Pacific Grove.
The bride is a daughter of an officer of
General (then Lieutenant) William Te
cumseh Sherman's company. Her mother i
held the position of official telegrapher I
for the united States Government at !
Monterey during the Civil War and, as
such, received the dispatch announcing
Lincoln's emancipation proclamation.
Miss Wright herself is the only person
born in Monterey's famous old custom
house. Mr. Culp is a son of J. D. Culp
of San Felipe, the veteran tobacco grower
i of the State.

A GOOD EXAMPLE.
Fred C. Siebe Takes the
Initiative in Patriotic
Action.
There is more than one way of evinc
ing one's patriotism, and because a man
may be a little too far advanced in
years to go to the front with a gun and
fifty pounds of equipage on his back, it
is no reason why he can not do a great
deal of good in other ways.
Fred C. Siebe, the brother of the As
sessor, showed a spirit yesterday which
cannot be too highly commended, and
which will probably be the first step in
a direction that many other prominent
ami wealthy merchants will follow.
When the hour at which the troops
were to depart had been definitely ascer
tained, Mr. Siebe called over two hun

SEQUEL OF A DEBAUCH.
On Account of the Scancal Mrs.
Dean Has Lelt Her
Husbsnd.
First Lieutenant Alexander T. Dean,
I Troop B. Fourth United States Cavalry,
has again and for the last time en
tangled himself in the clutches of the
military authorities at the Presidio.
Wine, women and song are the cause
of his downfall. Yesterday it was
Lieutenant Dean, to-day it is plain Mr.
| Dean, his resignation having been ten
j dered to avoid a trial and certain dis
missal.
A military court had several times
tried Lieutenant Dean for drunkenness
and conduct unbecoming an officer,. but
so far he has only been reprimanded or
lost a few files in rank.
On various occasions while on
"sprees" he has used Uncle Sam's fire
arms to perforate the walls and ceilings
of saloons and gambling houses in
Arizona, and later in the Yosemite
: National Park. His escapades in the
i Yosemite have been the talk of the of
' fleers and men of his regiment since
they occurred.
His latest debauch, that happened
' only a few days since, has capned the
I climax. It is stated by one close to the
authorities that while under the influ
; ence of liquor he left his overcoat, cane,
I watch and chain with a woman of
1 questionable reputation. These arti
! cles were recovered in a saloon on
I Kearny street, letween Jackson and
dred employes of his shoe factory and
wholesale liquor store together and told
them to quit work, go out and see the
procession and not to return until they
had cheered themselves hoarse in honor
of the Hag.
When the parade was over, the troops
had departed and the clerks and labor
ers had returned to their several occu
pations, Mr. Siebe informed them that
all who wished to enlist might do so
with the assurance that their positions
would be open to them on their return
from the war; and that every man po
doing would be presented with a paid
up insurance policy, made payable to
any member of his family he wished to
provide for, and that the house would
stand the expense.
This is the first step taken by any lo
cal merchant to do what he can toward
encouraging enlistment that has neces
sitated his going down into his pockets.
When interviewed last night concern
ing his action, Mr. JVbe was at first in
clined to say nothing about it, but.

by the lieutenant to secure them.
In consequence of this last debauch
Mrs. Dean has loft him and is now liv

his first partner having secured a di

ground of non-sup.>ort. ..

finances, which show a deficit.
Mayor Martin's address was short. He
said the city"s finances were in bad shape,
anrl many needed improvements would
have to wait until there were available
funds. He favored economy, and as a
start in this direction he recommended
that the Council meetings be held in
the afternoon instead of evening, thus
effecting a Having- in gas bills. In con
clusion he asked the hearty co-operation
of the Councilmen in orde: that the 11th

EXPLOSION SCATTERS
DEATH AND INJURY.
Two Chinese Killed and Eighteen
Maimed at a Quicksilver Mine
Near Calistoga.
NAPA, April 20.â At the Oat Hill quick
silver mine, fourteen miles above Calis
toga, an explosion occurred this morning
at 5:15 o'clock, causing the death of two
Chinese and the wounding of eighteen
others.
About 150 Chinese and the same number
of white men are employed in the mine,
and there are two villages in which the
workmen reside, the homes of the Chi
nese being separated from those of the
whites by quite a distance. The giant
powder which is used in operating- the
mine is kept in a powder-house, and the
Chinese contract laborers go there and
get it from time to time and temporarily
place in their cabins what they intend to
use.
This morning J. J. Multer, assistant su
perintendent of the mine, discovered
flames issuing from one of the Chinese
cabins. An alarm was sounded, and the
Chinese crowded about the burning
cabin, throwing buckets of water on the
flamw.
Suddenly there was a terrific explosion,
which shook the earth for hundreds of
yards around. After the smoke cleared
away nothing remained of the building,
and the dead and wounded coolies lay
scattered over the ground.
Stagedrlver C. \v. G. Connor conveyed
a number of the wounded Chinese to Cal
istoga. and the remaining wounded Chi
nese are on their way to that town.
Rich Strike in Pine Nut.
CARSON. April 20.â The biggest strike
ever made in Pine Nut is reported from
the Noonday mine. The blue lead has
when convinced that the story was
known and would be published whether
or no, he finally said: "I did not do !
what I have done with any wish to ;
pain notoriety. The matter is simply .
this: I believe that patriotism is the
highest and best virtue that humanity
possesses, and that money spent in culti
vating it is never thrown away. It is a
protection, not only for our homes and
firesides against an invading enemy,
but for ourselves against ourselves as
well. Let a man be proud of his coun
try and that pride will make him exert
every effort to make his country the
best on earth. Consequently we will
get good morals, good laws and good ,
government and protection in all honest j
business.
"I deprecate war and the horrors that
accompany it as much as any one, and
would go far as any one to prevent war
if it could be done without disgrace. As
to the justice or injustice of the present
difficulty, I have nothing to say. All I
know is that those in authority are ex
been reached and it is a very rich dis
covery.
RIVER STEAMSHIP
CORCORAN LAUNCHED.
Whistles Sound and Bells King as It
Glides Into the Water at
Stockton.
STOCKTON'. April 20.-The H. J. Cor
coran, the new passenger steamer of the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company, was launched at 4 o'clock this
afternoon. The vessel is the finest river
steamer on the coast. It will make the
run between San Francisco ajid Stockton
in five hours. It has beautiful lines, a
length of 215 feet over all, and a double
engineering pear. The launching was at
tended by the blowing of whistles and
rinsing of hells. It was remarked by
spectators that the vessel may see service
as a transport or a member of the mos
quito fleet if one is organized on this
coast.

SOLOMONVILLE, Ariz., April 20.â The

I five miles north of Geronimo by two rob

ILWACO'S VICTIMS OF
SPINAL MENINGITIS.
Autopsy Confirms the Diagnosis
Made by United States
Surgeon Redmond.
SEATTLE. April 20.â The autopsy made
by Dr. Redmond. United States surgeon
at Fort Canby, on the bodies of those who
were supposed to f have died at Uwaco of
cerbro spinal meningitis, yesterday fully
confirmed the former diagnosis that it
was this disease in the worst form. It
is the same ;ts that at Skaguay some time
ago. The greatest alarm exists around
Ilwaco as well as on the other side of the
Columbia River in Oregon.
ACCIDENT IN THE OLD
MILL AT SAN QUENTIN.
Large Pulley Wheel Breaks Loose,
Endangering the Lives of a
Number of Convicts.
SAN QUENTIN, April 20.â An accident
to the machinery of the old mill occurred
in the prison to-day, and will necessitate
a cessation of work for at least two
weeks. The nature of the accident was
such that it is almost a miracle that sev
eral men did not lose their lives. Strange
to say, nobody sustained a scratch.
The main shaft that provides power for
the machinery of tho old mill broke with
a terrific crash, releasing a pulley wheel

erting every effort to prepare for a con
flict that seems inevitable and I con
sider it my duty as an American citizen
to help in every way I can.
"If war must come, I want to see the
victory on our side, and to that end I
am willing to go as far as the next
mar. I would rather, however, be al
lowed to do what I do in a quiet and
unostentatious manner. I don't mind
spending a few dollars in such a cause,
nor do I think, were I young and able,
I would shrink when it came my turn
to go with the rest; but I do fear you
newspaper men, and I don't, know of
anything that would cause me to turn
back quicker than the knowledge that
a reporter was in front of me."
SWORD PRESENTED.
Ser^eant Major McCleave
Will Soon Be Promoted.
Tuesday night Sergeant Major Robert
MoCleare of the First Infantry was
tendered a reception by the enlisted
men of his regiment, in the barracks
occupied by Company G, his former
company. He was presented with an
officer's sword, dress and fatigue belts,
and a pair of second lieutenant's shoul
der straps, as a slight testimonial of
the esteem in which he is held by his
fellow soldiers. Sergeant Major Mc-
Cleare will, in a few days, be ap
pointed a second lieutenant of infantry.
The universal wish of his comrades, as
expressed in their toasts, is that he
may be successful and attain the high
est possible rank in the army. Ser
geant McCleare- enlisted August 15, 1894,
and was promoted through the grades
of corporal, sergeant, to regimental
sergeant major, the highest rank ob
tainable by an enlisted man. Sergeant
McCleare is respected by all the men
of his regiment for his manly, soldierly
and accommodating qualities.
Last September he passed a competi
tive examination at Fort Leavenworth
for a commission, and stood third in
merit of seven successful candidates.
He is a son of Captain William Mc-
Cleare, U. S. A., retired, of Berkeley.

An Enjoyable Surprise.
OAKLAND, April 20.â 0n Monday even
ing, April 18. California Council. Daugh

Reynolds little thought the affair was a
surprise in her honor, hut she was grand
ly entertained with a fine programme, in
chief of the State forces, the honor of
leading the troops on the field would
devolve upon General Dickinson.
A telegram from Admiral Kirtland,
U. S. N., was read, in which the ad

"ON TO CUBA!"
Significant Words of Gen
eral Shafter Before the
Union League Club.
There were assembled in the Maple
room of the Palace Hotel last night a
large number of well known men, some
of whom are prominent, in military cir
cles, all over the State, the occasion
being a reception tendered by the mem
bers of the Union League Club to Gen
eral W. R. Shafter, commander of the
Department of California, previous to
his departure for the East to-day.
There were present many of the gen
eral's personal admirers whose friend
ship he has gained by his sterling qual
ities both as an accomplished gentle
man and a soldier of high standing h\
the army. His uniform courtesy to all -
with whom he has come in contact 9,
during the long period he was sta
tioned here made him many warm
friends.
In responding to the address of wel
come General Shafter spoke these sig
nificant words: '"The concentration of
regular troops in the southern part of
the United States means that the mo
ment the Government determines to
take decisive steps the entire force will
be landed on Cuban soil and there, in
conjunction with the insurgents, will
concentrate their whole force upon thÂ«
taking of the city of Havana, which
will be speedily accomplished."
If the well wishes and godspeeds
which the general received last night
are realized he will return again to
San Francisco covered with added
glory and greater honors than he has
yet accepted during his long and meri
torious service in the army. The fol
lowing were noted among those pres
ent: General H. C. Merriam. the new
department commander; Major T. H.

San Francisco.MERCY'S CROSS IN WAR.
IT is ever the fortune of war that
together the Angel of Death and
the Angel of Mercy hover above
the field of battle. Wounded men
are borne away to the ministra
tion of gentle hands. Benign emis
saries, the red cross upon their arms,
care for the suffering, soothe the dy
ing. Out of the clamor of combat
conies the tenderness of an unselfish
love. It is not for all to "go where
glory waits." Some there must be
who can only abide until the harvest
of desolation is over, and then lend
comfort to the suffering, assuage the
final pang, take the last message,
close the dying eye.
The annals of the civil war show
that where one man succumbed to an
injury received in action, seven died
of disease. Where men are in camp,
their diet perhaps coarse and ir
regular, scant protection against the
weather, subjected to the perils of
impure water and faulty conditions,
they die as no clash of arms has ever
oeen able to make them die. Disease
is the foe to be feared. The miasma
which floats on the mists of the
night, the sun which burns, the frost
that chills â these are the enemies
which spare none. Yet the victim of
malady is as truly a martyr as the
victim of the bullet or the shell.
Medical attention and nursing are
as necessary for the fever patient as
for the soldier who falls in conflict.
There should be a sanitary com
mission formed at once. When the
Gallant First marched away yester
day every loyal spectator felt that
the boys in blue were personal
iriends. Women wept for sympathy;
THE GREAT EXAMPLE.
There may be no war. I hope so and half believe It: but if there Is to be
a war, patriotism, i.nnor and humanity alike suggest that good citizens
I do all they ran to relieve its horrors and sufferings. What form
relief Bhould take it Is impossible now to say, but the United States
Sanitary Commission, organized in the time of the Civil War, Is our great
example. If the crisis comes let a company of well-known citizens take
â¢â ': together and project a scheme of organization, and on their advice
let a great public meeting be called to carry out and perfect the organi
zation and report the readiness of the people to meet the wants of those
suffering in hospital and on the field.
HORATIO STEBBINS.
VOICE OF THE CHURCH.
I am decidedly In favor of organizing a sanitary commission. If the hope
of the American people be fulfilled, and the war come to a speedy end, so
much the better. Hut if war be prolonged. I deem it not only advisable but
a necessity that we should be prepared. The Spaniards are a brave and
loua people, and this fact, together with the effect of the climate of
Cuba, so fatal during the rainy season to the stranger, will bring about a
mortality among our soldiers.
The commission should be formed on the lines of the one that did such
good work during the Civil War. I regret to say that, In my opinion, war
with Spain is certain. It is our duty now to face and to make the best of the
Inevitable. JOHN J. PRENDEKGAST.
men were silent because they could
not trust themselves to speak. All
â¢wanted to do something to Bhow that
the soldiers were not bearing the
burden alone, and that the yearning
to help them was not the impulse of
a passing moment. It was out of this
feeling there has sprung the plan
of organizing a sanitary commission.
What will be the duties of 6uch a
Dody? A sanitary commission would
attend to sending trained nurses to
the scene of war. It would embrace
doctors whose duty would be the in
struction of these nurses. A sanitary
commission would raise funds for the
supplying of medicines, lint, band
ages, dainties. It would do all in its
power to succor the wounded. It
would provide brave and tender
women for the field and the hospital.
It would give to them the shield of
the red cross, a shield which affords
Bofe protection against all but the
Bavage. It would by its humane ef
forts keep burning the spirit of pa
triotism. It would tend to rob war of
a portion of its horror. It would af
ford to those anxious to do something
for their country and yet not per
mitted to bear arms the opportunity.
It would be a lesson to youth, keep
ing alive the spirit of devotion to the
commonweal, and showing them that
the soldier is not a mere fighting
machine, but a part of the nation he
serves so well.
THE PAULIST FATHERS READY.
About the organization of a sani
tary commission there should be no
I delay. The time is now, before the
regiments bound south shall have
I met the hosts of Spain. Let the boys
! go into their first action inspired by
i the thought that the civilians for
whom they risk life have not for
gotten them, but are doing all that
is possible for their comfort. In this
matter there can be no sectarian
: line drawn, nor impulse to draw it.
It is a work for churches, for fra
ternal societies, for philanthropic in
dividuals, rich or poor; a noble work,
:in which all may join. During the
! civil war there was such a commis
j sion. It originated in California and
grew to embrace every State in the
Union. The commission for the pres
ent war will originate here, and it
i will grow as fast and perhaps to a
I greater perfection than the former
I one. The only step to be taken is the
; formulation of a unity of purpose.
The rest will follow quickly and nat
urally.
There can be no occasion for an
appeal. The circumstances make the
appeal. The army is gathering in
the South. It expects to fight. For
an army to fight an army
means mutilation, shattered limbs,
agony, death. Every nurse there
will be a blessing. There could
be no stronger appeal than this.
Women are volunteering to go.
There is no method by which their
fitness may be pronounced upon, no
way of getting them to the post of
duty. A commission duly organized
would attend to these details. Let it
be started while the flowers given
the First Infantry as it started off
are still unwithered, still redolent of
California perfume. It is a tribute
owed to the soldier. And who can
tell who yet may be a soldier before
this war shall be over? A mother
may be working unconsciously to
ease the pain of her son. A nurse of
fering her unselfish services may
place water to the pallid lips of her
next of kin.
THE RED CROSS.
Civilized Nations All Re
spect the Embtem of
Mercy.
By Lieutenant-Colonel Leonard B. Almy,
Medical Director Connecticut N. G.
It is but a few years ago, less than a
generation, since the "Treaty of Ge
neva" relegated to the dark ages the
treatment of wounded men and their
necessary attendants as "prisoners of
war." The oldor members of this as
sociation have, many of them, doubt
lr-ss suffered imprisonment and priva
tions when captured in the discharge
of their duties during "the late un
pleasantness."
At that time the order detailing a
surgeon to remain with the wounded
carried with it a very differont proba
ble condition of affairs than if the
same order were given to-day among
any of the civilized and some of the so
called uncivilized nations of the world.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1898.
Thar.ks to that treaty the medical of
ficers and men can now do their work
upon the battlefield with the satisfac
tion of knowing that friend and foe
alike recognize the fact that to the
wearers of the "Red Cross" are given
privileges which are accorded to no
other body of men on the field, and
that no prospect of imprisonment stares
them in the face. Th. .. rights of the
medical department on the battlefield
are matters of international treaty
among thirty-four of the nations of the
world, and even the "red crescent."
among those who will not wear the
cross, claims protection in the same
way.
The treaty which gives us this im
munity while in discharge of our duty
Is phrased as follows:
Articles of the convention for the
EVERY ONE MAY HELP.
Those Left Behind Can Be of Service in the
Before the last strain of "Marching Through Georgia" had died away
yesterday afternoon, before the excited crowd on Market street had dis
persed, before the last stern-faoed, blue-coated soldier had stepped aboard
the ferry-boat, San Francisco was making plans for the future of these men
of ours who have gone to the front.
The first proposal for a sanitary commission comes from San Francisco.
"We've bid you good-by." she says to the d. -parting soldiers. "Our
children have smiled for you, our women have wept for you, our men have
cheered for you. Now, all together, men, women and children, we'll work
for you."
That San Francisco is keeping her word any one would have realized
who went about the city as I did yesterday. Verily, she hath dried her tears
and rolled up her sleeves. There is other and worthier work to be done than
to sit and mourn.
"Men must work and women must weep." Tes, but fortunately women can
do something else besides weep, nowadays.
"Wait till the sanitary commission is once organized," said a bright-faced
leader of society, who was seated in her pretty morning-room; "then you'll
see that though we women can't fight, we can work to make those who do
fight happier and healthier."
"If the sanitary commission Is formedâ and I think It should be formed
immediately." said gentle-voiced Father Wyma.n, in the Paullst Fathers'
bare, severe reception-room, "and If I am Invited to be a member, I shall
feel It my duty to accept."
This is the feeling all over the city. People who differ most In belief, In
manner of speech, in ways of living, are united for once. There is one re
ligion that Is sacred to all the world; there Is a common ground on which
every soul in this most cosmopolitan of cities may meet. There is a pass
word that's known to everybody, an open sesame to every heart. And that
word isâ Humanity.
It Is the religion of humanity that America's first sanitary commission
to be formed since the Civil War teaches. California was first in the estab
lishment of the original sanitary commission. She is first again now that
another generation of Americans is to know what war means.
All over the State women are volunteering to nurse the sick when war
shall be declared. Whose business is It to receive such offers, to examine
into them, to accept or reject tHem and to send on to the front the warm
hearted, skillful-handed Sister of Mercy?
As the certainty of war becomes apparent to even the most skeptical,
supplies of all kinds will come from those who arc left behind for those who
have gone aheadâ perhaps never to return. Who will receive those supplies
and distribute them?
As hospitals are established and the great Reaper begins to sweep the
field with his mutilating scythe all sorts of surgical appliances and quanti
ties of material for bandaging will be required. Whose place is it to classify
and forward these things?
The sanitary commission's, of courseâ that great, non-sectarian repre
sentative of all that is best in the world, the other side of the bloody war
shield.
The West Intends to be first in this work. Whatever surprise the Span
lards may contemplate, when they hint of the first naval battle, whatever
Uncle Sam's hidden plans may be, the first blood shed In this war will find
California ready to care for the men who shall revenge the death of the
Maine's crew.
People of every denomination, of all ages, of both sexes, received The
Call's suggestion yesterday with enthusiasm. That those men who are
fighting for us shall not suffer one pang unnecessarily, this is the watchword
of San Francisco to-day.
For one soldier who dies on the field of battle there are seven who perish
for lack of proper medical treatment and nursing afterward. Of the million
men the United States lost in the Civil War Â£75,000 might have been saved.
The God of War Is not so cruel as are the Inexorable laws of nature.
The men of the First Infantry who marched down Van Ness avenue
yesterday, too devoted to discipline, too conscious of the stern solemnity of
war to relax for a moment and smile back at the thousands of fresh young
faces and ea?er youthful voices cabling hail and farewell, are but a type
nf those who, all over the Union, are hurrying on toward that terrible
island where the deadly twinsâ battle and feverâ wa.it. These men are but
doing their duty. Let us do ours.
If the old savage something that lurks in us all leaps to life in you at
the thought of war once again; if your heart and your pride have been
touched by the sufferings of Cuba and the loss of the Maine, here's an out
let for your patriotism. Join the sanitary commission.
If you don't believe in war, If you can't be convinced of the necessity
of that most Illogical of arguir 1 "' : -"tcarious suffering; if you're unable to
see the necessity of C killiiiÃ D bÂ«cÂ« ise A killed B, your very eppo ition
qualifies you. Join the sanltarj c i.ssion and do what you can to make
some soldier's fever-maddened rouch fresher, softer. Do what you can to
make some hero's deathbed easier.
If you belonged to the old commission of the '60's, help us with your ad
vice, your experience. If you're new to war and its terrors, join with us to
lessen these by the might of sympathy, of charity, of humanity.
That the old proportion of 7 to 1 shall be altered is California's deter
mination. With modern appliances, with advanced surgery, with that angel
of the sickroom, the trained nurse, and thousands of other women ready to
don the glorious regalia of cap and apron, humbly to serve their appren
ticeship beside their hospital-trained sisters, the horrors of this war, which
the whole civilized world dreads, must be mitigated. Against all the awful
instruments of war that nineteenth century ingenuity has devised we must
oppose the hygienic and surgical science experience has taught us.
War Is terribly nearâ so near that even those who refused to believe it
possible, whose experience of a third of a century of peace disqualified
them from realizing such a possibility, have lost all hope of a peaceable
solution.
If it must come, let it find us ready. MIRIAM MICHELSON.

GOOD WORK DONE.
Once California Performed
Heroic Red Cross
Work.
California performed noble work dur
ing the progress of the war of the re
bellion through the sanitary commis
sion. The people of the State responded
with their characteristic liberality to
the calls from the East. On May 17, 1864,
on the occasion of a municipal election
In San Francisco, when 10,916 votes
were cast, $4156 was contributed to the
sanitary fund. Fairs, picnics and en
tertainments were given, at which large
amounts of money were raised for the
same object. On May 18 a picnic was
held near Sacramento for the benefit of
the fund, and a hare which had been
shot on the grounds was put up at auc
tion and was sold repeatedly, each time
being donated back by the purchaser,
until $157 was realized. At an entertain
ment which succeeded the picnic In the
evening a sack of tlour, sold in like
manner, brought $2150. This sack of
flour had been first donated and put up
for salo for the benefit of the fund by,
R. C. Oridley. then a resident of Austin,'
Nevada, and it was carried by him to
the different cities and towns of Nevada
and ("alifornia and repeatedly sold at
auction, and) by the time it reached
Sacramento about $35,000 had been real-
CO-OPERATION NEEDED.
The possibility of war with Spain, the almost certainty of that fact, de
plorable as it is from the standpoint of humanity, suggests a series of
duties for the civilian as well as for the brave lads of the army and navy-
While the boys follow "Old Glory," the civilian at home has to strengthen
the defenses of the country in more than one direction.
The German-Austrian war of 1566 brought the worst type of cholera
that ever afflicted Europe. The fate of the wounded and the prisoners in
the army of the rebellion still recalls the saddest recollections. The remark
able devotion of the women of the North and South was barely equal to the
awful suffering caused by exposure and imperfect sanitation; since then
we have greatly progressed. The splendid equipment of the surgeon
general's office, the non-combatant attitude of the Red Cross service, im
proved surgical and medical skill, all these will tend to minimize the fatal
consequences of the war. and will aid the sanitation of camp life as well
as the saving of life in and out of baitle.
The army and navy, from the firing of the first gun, need the co-operation
of the women of the country. When the Spanish Cortes has refused to ac
cede to the terms of the President's ultimatum that same moment the
women of our country must organize. They know their duty. They have
learned from their mothers and grandmothers, of deathless memory, what
American women can do for soldier boys who march with "Uncle Sam" in
defense of "Old Glory." Upon the prompt action of our women the organi
zation of sanitary commissions may depend the minimizing of the awful '
consequences of war.
War is always terrible, but now that our country Is Involved, we have â

A NOBLE WORK.
The Red Cross a Welcome
Angel of Mercy.
"It will be a great organization and
one that will be much needed to assist
in the care of the wounded and sick
should war be prolonged," said Dr.
John Gallwey, brigade surgeon, and
one of the officers of the Sanitary Corps
of the National Guard. "There is al
ways great need of nurses and hospi
tal attendants on the fields of battle
and had there been large organized
corps of nurses during the time of the
civil war there would not have been
near as many deaths or half the suf
fering. The treaty of Geneva gives
honor and respect to the Red Cross in
all civilized nations during warfare and
in all probability during the war that
is now upon the nation there will be
a great call for skilled nurses in the
field and it is a grand idea to com
mence as soon as it is possible to or
ganize and prepare to meet the emer
gency. California I am sure will re
spond with its- usual liberality and
should it be called upon it will do its
utmost in its humane work."
"To begin with there must be or
ganization. Then volunteers must be
called for and they must receive some
training as to the duties that will be
expected from them. As for the train
ing, there will be plenty of surgeons
and physicians who will gladly give
lectures and demonstrate what is to be
done to give aid to the wounded and
nurse the sick. I can say for all the
physicians of the Sanitary Corps of the
National Guard that every one of them
will do all that is possible to aid the
work. Good corps could and should be
organized in San Francisco, Stockton,
Sacramento, Fresno and Los Angeles,
and perhaps in several other of the
larger cities of the State. Men and
women will be needed for this service,
and it will be a noble calling on the
field of battle."
A GREAT HELP.
The Red Cross Can Take
Away Many of War's
Horrors.
Dr. William D. McCarthy, of the San
itary Corps of the National Guard of
California, is enthusiastic over the
proposition to establish a Red Cross
League in this State. "During war
times," he said, "every large city
should have a Red Cross Association,
which should co-operate with the sani
tary corps of the army and navy in the
field. This organization should be
placed in direct communication with
the Surgeon-General of the United
States army and of the United States
navy, so that an offer of assistance
may be promptly accepted in case of
need. The duty of the organization
should be to supplement the force of
nurses in case the proper strength of
the organized sanitary corps depart
ment in the field should be depleted by
death or sickness. It should also send
to the front practical nurses to assist
the military surgeons; to supply ban
dages and dressings of all sorts; proper
food for the sick and a thousand other
things that may ameliorate the suffer
ingÃ and miseries that were so often
pictured in the late civil war."

Washington, April 20.
The Spanish Minister, accompanied
by six members of his staff, left Wash
ington at 7:30 o'clock to-night, and the
Spanish Government thus terminated
its diplomatic representation in the
United States. The Minister and his
party left by the Pennsylvania road,
going northward to Buffalo and Sus
pension Bridge, and thence to To
ronto. By 10:40 to-morrow morning the
Spanish officials will be on British soil.
They will stop for a day or two on the
Canadian side of Suspension Bridge
and will then spend some days at To
ronto. From there they go to Halifax
to take an ocean steamer. While the
Minister is on this side of the border
he has the protection of the passports
issued late this afternoon by the State
Department at his request, following
the delivery of a copy of the President's
ultimatum to Spain.
The departure of the Spanish party
was made without noticeable demon
stration, and, although a considerable
number of secret service officers and
police were on duty at the depot, there
was at no time any occasion for their
dome,- more than keeping back a crowd
of curious onlookers.
At 6 o'clock this evening Senor Polo
de Bernabe made a hurried call at the
French Embassy and the Austrian le
gation, where Spanish interests are left
in charge, and then joined his staff at
the legation and started for the train.
An express wagon was piled high with
the trunks of the large party. Just be
fore the departure from the legation
the Austrian Minister, Baron Hengel-
Muller and Baroness Hengel-Muher,
dropped in for a last word, and several
other members of the diplomatic corps
called to make their final adieus.
This done, the legation was vacated
and the party assembled at the Penn
sylvania depot. As the Minister en
tered the station he was recognized by
the crowd, which closed in about him
until cautioned by the officers.
No word of indignity was spoken, and
the salutations of those in the crowd
were rather agreeable than otherwise.
He smiled in acknowledgment of the
attention given him and several times
touched his hat. He wore a brown
tweed suit and a soft felt traveling hat.
Following him came Senor Pablo Solar,
first secretary of the legation; Senor
Aquaraoni, second secretary; Senors
Pla and Almieda, attaches; Captain de
la Casa, military attache, and Lieuten
ant de Carantha, naval attache. Senors
Dubosc and Galarza did not accompany
the party, as they will remain until to
morrow, in an unofficial capacity.
At the train platform the Minister
was greeted by Viscount de Santo-
Thryso, the Portuguese Minister, and
Calderon Carlisle, an acquaintance for
the last twenty-five years, and coun
sel for the legation. The party board
ed the Pullman sleeper Japan, which
had been taken entire. Secret service
men remained at the platform to pre
vent intrusion and half a duzen police
officers were grouped outside. At no
time, however, were their services re
quired. The Minister stood on the front
platform and had a few parting words
with his friends. He spoke feelingly of
his departure, saying the circumstances
were most painful to him. One of his
intimates ventured the suggestion that
he would be back soon again, unde?
much more favorable circumstances,
but he shook his head and said ha
feared this could not be the case. Ha
said his request for his passport had
been made only after the enactment of
a law which attacked Spain's sov
ereignty, Impugned her honor and in*
suited her.
Lieutenant de Carantha asked a cor*
respondent to make known the lieuten
ant's view on the war about to ba
opened. He said the Spanish people,
particularly members of the army and
navy, had always entertained the most
cordial feeling toward America, anc}
Spanish ships had found it a pleasurf
to salute ships of the American navjs
Now. however, a war was being pre
cipitated by an attack upcn Spanish
honor, and p.gainst this every spark o<
Spanish loyalty would be aroused.
"It is no longer a question of re-,
taining Cuba," said Lieutenant de Car-,
antha. "That was merely a question
of territory. Now a higher purpose
is in view â the honor and dignity of
Spain â since the United States has con
temptuously ordered Spain to vacate
Cuba and has made the infamou*
charge that we are responsible for tha
murder of the poor men of the Maine.
These orders and charges are made
with a kick of the boot, and against
such action Spain will resist to the ut
termost.
"There should he no mistake about
this. History has recorded that even
the legions of Napoleon, with 400,000
men, bearing the triumphs of all
Europe, were halted and retired from
Spain, after those legions had lost be
tween 200.000 and 300,000 men. We
recognize the gallantry of the Ameri
can navy and the notable heroes of its
past â Paul Jones, Farragut, Porter â
but Spain, too, has hÂ»r heroes, and
their blood is in the veins of those now
called upon to defend her honor. I
speak after recently talking with my
naval associates, commanders of Span
ish ships and of torpedo-boats, and I
know that there is but one sentiment,
namely, that not one Spanish ship
shall be taken. Your navy may send
many of them to the bottom: superior
forces may seek to annihilate them, but
not one Spanish ship â >â â¢*'' surrender to
the American navy. "With honor at
stake, that will be the response of the
navy of Spain."

INTO CHATTANOOGA.
Western Warriors Showered With

CHATTANOOGA, Term., April 20.â
Cavalry and artillery from all parts of
the country poured into Chattanooga
to-day. Major-General John J\. Brooke
and his staff of the department of ths
lakes arrived from Chicago to-day to
assume command at the Chickamauga
camping ground.
Following close upon General
Brooke's arrival came the first section
of the train carrying two squadrons of
the Third Cavalry from Jefferson Bar
racks, Mo., in command of Majors Wes
sel and Loud, with their horses, wag
ons and camp outfits.
It was not until 5 p. m., however, that
the thousands who had gathered in the
union station and in the railroad yards
had a chance to give vent to theÂ»r en
thusiasm.
When the second section came in
with ten coaches filled with brawny
blue-coated warriors from the West
cheer after cheer went up from the
crowds. The soldiers cheered in return,
while a bugler on the platform of the
front coach sounded the call to arms,
and as the train slowly pulled into the
depot the outstretched hands of the
troops were filled with flowers by
pretty Southern girls.
Far into the night companies of cav
alry kept coming in, four trainloads of
troops from Fort Myer, with their
horses and accoutrements, arriving at
intervals of about an hour. Besides
these, two trains with troops from
Forts Porter and Niagara, N. C, passed
through Chattanooga early in the
evening, on their way to Tampa, Fla.

FAREWELL TO ThjE FIRST.
THE march of the First Infantry yesterday was
a farewell of which the soldiers might well have
been proud. Doubtless it sent them toward the
front with a new idea of the place they hold in popu
lar esteem, with their hearts touched and the farewell
robbed of its bitterness. Along the line as they
passed thousands of banners waved, thousands of
children shrilled their enthusiasm, and men and
women stood voiceless, their eyes filled with unbid
den mist. They loved the men who tramped by, per
haps never to return. They looked upon them as
representing the honor of the flag, the dignity of
the Government, the certainty that no foe could
menace the public safety and go unscathed.
It is difficult to define with exactness the emotions
of which the display of flags and flowers was in token.
It is not just easy to understand why women shed
tears and why some of them could not resist the im
pulse to rush into the street and strew wreaths in the
path of the soldiers. Yet such were the impulses
stirring the throng, and it is good that it was so. It
renews faith in patriotism, the heritage of a people
who fought for their own liberty, a feeling the pes
simist has said was dead.
And the men, they deported themselves as be
came those who faced the certainty of peril, the pos
sibility of death. Steady, erect, grave-faced, they
kept time to the music every note of which carried
them nearer to danger and perhaps to death. It may
befall that the First shall stand guard in far away
Cuba, threatened there by armed foe and by the
more deadly miasma of the tropic swamp. At such a
time they can look back to the city which with tears
and cheers bade them godspeed and know that here
multitudes who never spoke to them, who only saw
them as they went by to war. hold them in tender
memory, will follow them with their prayers, and
some day, it may be, welcome them joyously home
again.
MR. BRYON AS THE FINOL CAUSE.
PUBLIC interest in teleology is aroused in the
South by a discussion of Mr. William J. Bryan's
place in the universe and his part in what
theologians call "the scheme of salvation."
The Memphis Appeal seems to doubt Mr. Bryan
as a final cause. It says:
"When the Governor of Mississippi stated that
William J. Bryan was the greatest man that had ap
peared on earth since the death of Jesus Christ he
made a statement which is hardly tenable. Some
people will be surprised that the Governor made any
exception at all; while others, pondering upon the
fact that such men as St. Paul. Dante, Shakespeare.
Goethe, Napoleon. Washington. Jefferson, Clay, Cal
houn, Webster. Bismarck, Gladstone, Pitt. Fox,' Lin
coln, Lee and Stonewall Jackson have lived 'since
the time of Christ, will be surprised that any sober
man should have made such a silly statement at all.
Mr. Bryan is a young man of fine oratorical gifts,
who made a remarkable canvass for President and
was defeated, and it in no way detracts from our ap
preciation of his character or his talents to deny
that he is divine."
The Appeal treads lightly. One admires the cau
tion of the statement that the Governor's position is
"hardly tenable," though there is a gradual vertebral
stiffening up to the expression of a doubt of Mr.
Bryan"s divinity. It is evident that the Appeal feels
that denial of the Governor's declaration may be
taken as treason to 16 to i. This fear is shown by
his holding St. Paul and sixteen other gentlemen be
tween himself and expulsion from the silver party,
just as Russell Sage held a clerk between himself and
the dynamite bomb which was exploded against him
as collateral for a loan.
Whenever it is admitted that Mr. Bryan is merely
"a young man of fine oratorical gifts" we may ex
pect a return to reason on the part of his devotees.
Tint admission brings him out of the clouds and
enters him in the vocal class along with Billy Mason.
Senator Stewart and Perspiration Allen, also of
Nebraska.
Mr. F.banks, who killed two people, will have to
harfe, which is proper, but to bring him to this pass
required the highest court in the Jand. notwithstand
ing there was no question of his guilt, but only as
to whether the requisite amount of red tape had been
expended in demonstrating it.
Citizens of Huntington, Or., think they saw "vic
tory's sign in the skies." Oregon whisky and a me
teoric shower constitute a peculiar blend.
POWERS OF THE SUPERVISORS.
A DISCUSSION of the proposed new charter
will be incomplete without some attention is
given to the power of the Supervisors. The
organ of the charter declares that the Freeholders
have completely reformed these historical corrup
tiorists by taking from them some of their executive
and legislative functions. Under the proposed in
strument the Supervisors will no longer directly par
ticipate in appointments to office. This function will
be exercised exclusively by the Mayor. Nor will
they be any longer empowered to grant special privi
leges to corporations.
We do not know but it is a good idea to clip the
wings of the Supervisors. Certainly if a system of
legislation ever grew up anywhere which deserved
the attention of a ruthless reformer it is the system
which prevails in this city. Under the tutelage of the
corporations, the political bosses and the spoilsmen,
the legislative arm of our government has earned the
disrespect of all intelligent people. No attention is
paid to its opinions, its laws are treated with con
tempt by the courts, and its public fulminations are
usually met with jeers. The principal subjects to
which its members have devoted their attention for
several years is selling franchises and special privi
leges, and ham-stringing corporations which are so
unfortunate as to fall into its clutches.
Surely a Board of Freeholders engaged in making
a charter cannot be censured for dealing such a sys
tem deadly blows. But why, in giving the bodkin
to the Supervisors, should the charter-makers have
placed a sword in the hands of the Mayor? Not
only have they lodged the -appointment of all the ad
ministrative bureaus of the government in the hands
of the Mayor without check â thus making it easy
for the corruptionists by electing one man instead of
twelve to capture the city â but they have created a
monopoly in street railway franchises which the
Mayor could not, even were he so disposed, over
turn.
The plan for granting street railway franchises
adopted by the charter-makers fixes the present
monopoly in street railway transportation. No one
but a four or five times millionaire could ever secure
a competitive privilege from the Supervisors under
the system proposed. The merest tyro in the law
may readily understand this by reading sections 6 and
7 of chapter 2, article I, of the proposed charter.
Under the instrument the Board of Supervisors will
have no real power. Even its ordinances may be
vetoed by the people. Perhaps this is well. A board
which deserves so little from history should not be
given much. But how about the powers lodged in the
Mayor? Will not one man abuse them more than
many? Is not municipal government after all, like
most other human institutions, a matter of character
and not of system? Had our people always been
careful to elect good men to the offices of Super
visor would the charter-makers have treated the
board with the contumely now apparent? There is
no principle of government under this shifting of
abuses. Instead of stripping the Supervisors of all
power, why did not the Freeholders place checks
upon them and checks upon the Mayor and his
commissions, and thereby create antagonisms which
always prevent abuses in municipal government?
It seems to us that the plan proposed is a fire into
which we are invited to jump. The question is bound
to be, Are we not better off in the frying-pan?
THE BURDEN OF ISLAND COLONIES.
ITIE sore straits in which Spain finds herself are
the effect of a cause remote in her history.
Her weakness to-day is in what she founded in
her flood tide of power to be her strength. She
took domain by conquest and colonization, in pur
suance of manifest destiny, to plant her power and
its outposts all over the world. She has coaling
stations, naval stations, colonial capitals, and instead
of leaning upon them now for support, they are
crumbling under her and will let her fall. She must
guard her Mediterranean islands and those in the At
lantic and Pacific, divide her military and naval
strength and so weaken herself thereby as to expose
her home coasts to attack and her peninsular domain
to invasion. The United States are happily without
such necessity. Our navy can attack the ships of
Spain which police her islands and destroy them
fket after fleet. One cannot come to the help of an
other without leaving a vital point exposed. If any
thing can impress our people with the unwisdom of
the annexation of Hawaii, or any other extraconti
nental territory which requires a navy to defend it,
current events should be sufficient.
It is proved that we can not only defend our own
extensive coast line, but can project offensive war
against a neighboring enemy, using our own ports
as a base of supplies and military operations. Cuba
is to Spain what Hawaii would be to us. She has
fortified that island and treated it as a strong mili
tary base, but even if its people were not in rebellion
against her, its possession would divide her forces
and weaken her position.
Spain was once a first-class power, exceeding Eng
land or any of the maritime countries. Her scepter
was over distant domain, but the necessity of defend
ing her far-planted standard has sapped her colonial
revenues and brought her home finances to bank
ruptcy.
Her history is a strong argument against manifest
destiny, against dividing the planet between a few
strong powers. It is better to let the small nations
alone, and to let their people develop institutions
suited to their genius and the physical conditions in
which they are placed. Schemes of universal empire
spring out of this fever for annexation and absorp
tion of small autonomies, but such schemes have in
them the germs of dissolution.
The United States are just now illustrating to the
world the value of a homogeneous people, made one
by similarity of conditions, fitted by environment to
live under one system of equal laws, and if we are
wise we will refuse to build on to this scheme colo
nial and excrescent annexes, which must be adminis
tered under a policy different from that which suffices
for our continental possessions.
Cubans in New York announce that they are satis
fied. Surely they ought to be. They have been re
quired to -do no fighting, and now a greater power
takes up arms in their behalf, permitting them to re
main in the metropolis and there wage war to the
extent of a bottle of ink daily.
About as many thousand people as could con
veniently line the route from the Presidio to the
ferry yesterday put in a few hours remembering the
Maine.
When the attitude of the Carlists is considered!:
can fairly be said tha* Spain occupies a position be
tween the devil and the deep sea.
Torpedo boats may be terrible engines of war, but
the crews seem to be concerned generally in an effort
to keep the things afloat.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THUESDAT, APRIL 21, 1898.
AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
THERE has, since the open hostility of Spain,
particularly since the Maine went down, been a
tendency to find fault with Mr. McKinley. It
has found expression in statements that he had not
acted with decision, that he did not have a fui" grasp
of the American idea. It was forgotten for the mo
ment that upon the President rests a fearful respon
sibility, that to his acts at the time of crisis must be
ascribed his own place in history, and upon the in
tegrity of his purpose must rest the reputation of the
people who have chosen him to rule them.
It cannot be said now by any patriot that the Presi
dent has not acted wisely and well. He read the
will of the country in the dictum of Congress, and to
it he has bowed. While he was anxious to uphold
the dignity of the country, perhaps by a different
method, he has not permitted his personal beliefs to
cast a straw in the way of carrying out the popular
idea. If he would have given Spai;. more time, he
has declined to do so. He has sent an ultimatum
about which there is no shadow of uncertainty. He
has allowed Spain a reasonable time, no more, in
which to make answer. He has assumed that the er
ply will not be in the nature of a concession. The
praise of America will be his present reward. No
more could have been asked than he has done.
The precise terms of the ultimatum are not known
yet, but the intimations are all that it has no uncer
tain tenor. The Spanish flag must retire from Cuba.
This is the penalty of crime. The people have said it,
and their President has conveyed their verdict to
Madrid. Perhaps the Spanish excel us in diplomacy.
They cannot outdo us in directness of speech and
purpose. President McKinley has risen to the oc
casion, as his friends said, and his foes feared, he
would.
T UDGE MAGUIRE has now learned by the re
pj suits of the recent meeting of the Democratic
State Committee that if he had given less of his
time and attention to making single tax campaigns
in other States, and had devoted himself to his duties
in Congress and to the affairs of his party at home,
his energies would have been of more service to his
aspirations for the governorship. As it is, while he
has been fighting all over the country in advocacy of
a scheme to place all taxes on land holdings and
make the farmers bear all the burdens of the com
monwealth, his enemies have got possession of his
party, slaughtered his friends in their homes and
achieved a distinct triumph.
By reason of the clever move carried out by Mr.
Gould the single tax champion has been heavily han
dicapped in the contest for the gubernatorial nomina
tion. Representation in the State convention is to be
apportionedamong the countiesnot ori the basis of the
vote given for Budd, as should have been the case
in a State election, but on that given for Bryan. It
is well known that many stalwart Democrats voted
against Bryan, and many silver Republicans voted for
him. Consequently the Gould scheme throws down
the Democracy in some of its strongholds where
Maguire has friends, and increases the representation
from the silver fusion districts, where the single tax
is not popular. It is not exactly a knock-out blow
for Maguire, but it will stagger him.
The trick of Mr. Gould is too characteristic of
Democracy to occasion surprise. That party is es
sentially a party of opposition, of factions and of
kickers. All through the year it kicks against the
government of the nation, and it begins each' cam
paign by a faction kick against some of its own lead
ers. Never has there been i.. recent years an election
contest of any kind that did not open with a Demo
cratic row of some sort, and as a rule the earnest
ness with which the party was going to make the
campaign has been pretty accurately foreshadowed
by the keenness of the faction fight that began it.
According to the ordinary course of human nature
faction trickery in a party at the outset of a cam
paign would create dissensions that would weaken it
in the contest that followed. Democratic nature,
however, is not human nature. Democracy never
really gets its mad up until it has seen its own blood,
and it has to have a fight in the camp before it is
ready to fight outside. Judging the present out
look, therefore, by the experience of the past, the
knifing of Maguire by Gould is an evidence that the
Democrats will make a hard fight for victory this
year. There will be nothing in the way of a walk
over for any candidate the Republicans may put up,
no matter how great may be his personal strength.
The lesson of the situation is clear. The Demo
crats are already at work â knifing one lother, it
is true, but nevertheless at work, and it is time for
Republicans to be making ready. The task of party
organization should be pushed forward at once. Let
every loyal Republican enroll, himself as a member
of some active campaign club and be prepared to do
zealous work in the contest that is to come.
The resolution to have no fiesta at Los Angeles
this year is a graceful and generous surrender to cir
cumstances. These floral events have been most en
joyable, and of a large practical benefit in making
known the beauty and productiveness of Southern
California. Yet an occasion purely one of merri
ment would not accord well with a time when the
country is engaged in war. In another year, v/hen
the trouble shall be over, Los Angeles may with pro
priety have a bigger fiesta than ever, and we will all
take a week off and go.
Butcher Weyler predicts that to accomplish any
thing in Cuba Americans will have to land several
hundred thousand troops, that fever will kill half of
these, and the Spanish "will take care of the rest."
After having undergone these dire experiences, it is
not easily seen how the Americans will have accom
plished much beyond founding a series of cemeteries.
Possibly Weyler is as bad a prophet as he is a sol
dier.
Perhaps the practical Mr. Huntington, when he
said there was no reason to fight with Spain, had not
realized that the troops would be transported over
his lines, and that thousands of citizens would go to
watch them march away, each contributing 10 cents
to Mr. Huntington's street car line.
It may not be out of place to inquire if the Ala
meda pickpocket who explained that he stole a purse
for fun, and who got six months in jail, couldn't
have had more fun in some other way.
During Minister Bernabe's sojourn in this coun
try he has given evidence of being a gentleman, a
particularly notable contrast with the example fur
nished by his predecessor.
Knights of the Red Branch and League of the
Cross cadets are ready to enlist for war. In other
words, these organizations are made up of patriotic
American citizens.
It is a sort of comfort to know of one defaulting
official whose bondsmen are not of the straw variety.
DEMOCRACY AT WORK-
SPAIN'S CRIMES AGAINST AMERICA.
The Maine Affair Only One of a Long List Which Have
Not Been Avenged.
PART 11.
After the Lopez affairs all American
papers were excluded from Cuba, and
a rigid surveillance was exercised over
all correspondence from or to the is
land. In October, 1852, the United
States steamship Crescent City, from
New York to New Orleans, touched at
Havana. The captain-general had be
come incensed at certain paragraphs
that had appeared in the New York
papers relative to Cuban affairs, which
were charged to have been furnished
by William Smith, the purser of the
Crescent City. Notice was sent to
Lieutenant Porter, the commander of
the vessel, that the purser must not
attempt to land at Havana. Porter
replied that he knew of nothing that
would render Smith's presence on shore
necessary, but that If he had duties
which would call him Into the city he
would leave to the authorities the re
sponsibility of preventing his landing.
The purser did not go ashore and the
steamer proceeded to New Orleans. On
her return trip the vessel again touched
at Havana and letters were sent on
board and also on board the steamer
Black Warrior, warning the officers
that Smith could not land. Spanish po
lice officers were also sent on board
the Crescent City, evidently to watch
Smith's movements and to prevent his
landing. Lieutenant Porter at once in
formed those parties that if they were
on board to arrest any one answerable
to the Spanish authorities, or to pre
vent the embarkation of any person
belonging to Havana, the ship was
open to them, but if they were there
to watch the officers of the ship it
could not be permitted and they must
go ashore. They accordingly left.
Anticipating further trouble the lieu
tenant addressed a letter to the author
ities warning them against offering any
indignity to the American flag. The
vessel left the port without further
molestation. The next time when the
Crescent City visited Havana with the
mails, on her way to New Orleans, she
entered the harbor without molesta
tion. At sunrise the Captain of the
Port came alongside and asked whether
Smith was still on board, and being
answered In the affirmative, an order
was immediately given that the steam
er should have no communication what
ever with the shore. A cordo-n of boats
was stationed to watch the steamer
and enforce the execution of the order.
Lieutenant Porter requested permission
to communicate with the American
Consul, in order to present to the cap
tain-general through him a protest
against the treatment to which the
steamer was subjected. After a parley
on shure this request was denied for j
some time, but finally, after an inef- I
fectual effort to ascertain the contents
of the protest â Porter refusing to com
municate further on the subject ex
cept through the Consul, the latter offi
cer was permitted to come alongside
In a Government boat, in company with
the Captain of the Port, to whom the
protest was delivered. The American
Consul, however, was not permitted to
go on board the steamer, nor to write
home by her. On his assurance that
nothing could be done to change the
position of affairs, the Crescent City
proceeded to sea with the American
flag flying at her masthead. This inci
dent produced. In connection with other
acts that were regarded as insulting to
the United States Government, a deep
feeling of resentment, and for a time
it seemed as if serious trouble would
result. In commenting on the matter
the San Francisco Alta said:
"There are indications of hostilities
to come between the United States and
Spain. Since the famous filibustering
expeditions to Cuba the Spanish au
thorities, both in Cuba and elsewhere,
have manifested a disposition to take
advantage of the leniency and Justice
of our Government, and have done
things which they would never have
dared to think of doing had not the
United States Government disclaimed
the action of the filibusters. The Span
iards seem to mistake justice for weak
ness on our part, and upon this false
hypothesis have made demonstrations
against our vessels and people which
they will have occasion to repent ere
long. Spain should bear In mind that,
while the magnanimity and conscious
power of the United States induce our
Government to bear with her presump
tuous impertinence, and prompts a de
gree of leniency that would not be
shown to a more powerful nation, we
are under no obligation to overlook her
acts when they become really trouble
some to us. The madman may rave
and bluster at the thundering locomo
tive with impunity provided he keeps
out of the way, but if he at
tempts to check the career of
the subject of his abuse the
chances are he will Â«et. run over.
So with Spain. She may fulminate
as she will against the United States
without exciting the resentment or
even notice of the Americans, but when
she so far forgets herself as to inter
fere with our peaceful and lawful vo
cations she puts herself in a fair way
of trouble."
The Crescent City affair was ad
justed by Judge Conkling, who had
been appointed Minister to Mexico, and
who touched at Havana on his way to
Vera Cruz, and had a conference with
the captain-general at the request of
our Government. Purser Smith made
an affidavit denying that he had ever
written or published anything injuri
ous to the interests of Spain in Cuba,
and that was accepted as satisfactory.
Spain, however, continued to annoy
American merchant vessels, and the
taking of the steamer Black Warrior
by the Cuban Custom-house officers
was an incident that occurred during
the administration of President Pierce
that threatened to lead to hostilities.
In May, 1854, the Warrior stopped at
Havana on her way from New Orleans
to New York. The port officers no
ticed that she had cotton on board, al
though her manifest certified that she
had no cargo, and- the cotton was de
clared confiscated on that account. The
owners of the steamer urged that it
was not usual for the manifest to men
tion cotton not shipped to Havana; that
ali vessels touching at that port had
uniformly made up their statement in
the same way, and that no objection
had been made before. If there was
an error in the manifest they asked
the usual privilege of twelve hours to
make the correction. This was per
emptorily refused, and the cargo de
clared confiscated. The captain of the
steamship thereupon hauled down the
United States flag and surrendered the
vessel to the local Government. Sen
ator John Slidell introduced a resolu
tion in Congress authorizing the Pres
ident to suspend the operation of the>
neutrality laws, so far as Spain was
concerned, whenever in his judgment
such a measure should be expedient.
The resolution was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations. On
the Ist of August a message was re
ceived from President Pierce by the
Senate stating that the formal demand
for indemnity, instead of having been
satisfied, had led to a justification en
the part of the Spanish Government of
the action of the Cuban authorities, and
that therefore the responsibility of the
acts was transferred to the Soar.ish
Government. Nothing hnd been done
to remove past grounds of complaint
or to afford any security for Justin*
and tranquillity In the future. Two
days later the Senate committee re
ported that full reparation for the past
and adequate guarantees for the fu
ture could alone satisfy the public, and
that they would not hesitate to re
commend the adoption of such pro
visional measures as would effectually
insure the observance of our rights and
the protection of our interests bu.t for
the fact that but four months would
elapse before the next session, and in
that brief interval they deemed ;t; t ad
visable to leave the matter in the
hands of the executive. At that time
Pierre Soule was our Minister at Mad
rid, and under instructions from the
President he endeavored to induce
Spain to cede Cuba to the United
States. At a conference of the Amer
ican Ministers to Spain, England acd j
France, held at Ostend In October, a
tender of 5120,000,000 was authorized to
be made for the purchase of Cuba. The
offer was declined by the Spanish Oov
ernment, which held that the sale of
Cuba would be a sale of the national
honor, and it was announced that the
supreme Government had decided on
the abolition of slavery in the island.
The matter there ended. The annual
message of the President of December
4, 1854, contained this brief allusion to
our affairs with Spain: "Internal agi
tation, assuming very nearly, the char
acter of political revolution, has re
cently convulsed Spain. The late Min
isters were violently expelled from
power, and men of very different views
in relation to its internal affairs hava
succeeded. Since this change there
has been no propitious opportunity to
resume and press negotiations for an
adjustment of serious questions of dif
ficulty between the Spanish Govern
ment and the United States." But the
President expressed the belief that the
new Ministry would be more favora
bly inclined to comply with our just
demands and make suitable arrange
ment for restoring harmony and pre
serving peace between the two coun
tries.

O The recent de-
O parture of the
O regulars for the
O front has given
o occasion for
o many heartrend-
O ing- scenes, but it
is doubtful if any
occurred that were more replete with
pathos than the following:
Not long ago there arrived from the
East a lady of such exceedingly great
beauty that it was only equaled by her
wit, tact and personal magnetism. She
took apartments at one of the fashion
able downtown hotels, and it was not
long before she had beaux galore, among
whom was a young, handsome and gal
lant army officer stationed at the Pre
sidio. Now, this son of Mars has the
reputation of being a great heart-breaker
of about 500 stamp power, and that the
reputation is based on fact can be at
tested by the aching void in many a
snowy bosom where once a heart flut
tered until charmed from its nest by this
Adonis in stripes and gold lace.
Among his victims was a pretty debu
tante, who was also an intimate friend
of the fair visitor from the East. This
maiden thirsted for revenge, and, seeing
her opportunity, took me new arrival
into her confidence, with the result that
Mr. Lieutenant was taken down to the
hotel by Miss Debutante and introduced
to Miss Easterner. The scheme worked
to perfection. He, who had been accus
tomed to call and conquer, had at last
met his match and capitulated uncon
tlitionruly.
The affair progressed with remarkable
rapidity. The first call was succeeded by
a second, after an interval of three days
the third call came forty-eight hours
later, and the progression from flowers
to theater parties was so rapid that the
five years' bank accumulation began to
go like mist before the rising sun. At
last the end drew nigh. Rumors of war

i is, I am sorry to say it can never be."
"Tell me what the three things are,

$116,000.

Whence He Fled

Makes â  Statement Assuming the
Entire Responsibility for thÂ«
f Shortage.
Augustus C. Widber and $116,000 were ;
missed from thp City Treasurer's office i
yesterday. Within a few minutes after i
this Information was conveyed to !
Mayor Phelan, the police authorities |
Bet the machinery of their office at
work, and as a result Widber was ar
rested at Walnut Creek, but, so far as
known, none of the missing money has
been recovered.
For many weeks It had been rumored
that City Treasurer Widber had been j
plunging on the races, and also that his |
accounts were not In the condition that
they should be. Nothing of a tangible
nature, however, could be obtained.
Bo stronc were these reports that i
Mayor Phelan caused an examination
to be made of Widber's books, and a
report was made to him that there was j
a shortage In Widber's accounts of
about (56,000. On a further investiga
tion of Widber's accounts, however,
the apparent shortage by some mys- j
terious process of manipulation had
disappeared.
From the facts that developed yes
terday it appears that there has been
a systematic and wholesale robbery of
the city's money going on from the
vaults of the Treasurer's office, and
that Widber Is solely and directly re
sponsible. The greatest shortage has
been found In connection with the gen
eral fund. Sacks of money which should
have contained $5000 in gold have been
kfound to be filled with about $250 In
Pfilver coin. The shortage in this fund !
Is estimated to be $76,000. In the col
lateral inheritance tax fund a shortage j
exists of $15,000, while the money of
the Pub!ic Administrator In the custody
of the City Treasurer is short $25,000.
Chief Deputy Treasurer M. de la
Montanya discovered the sensational
crime by first noticing that a seal on a j
$5000 sack of gold cola had been tam
pered with. He at once suspected that
Widber was the culprit, as only Wid
ber and he had the combination to the
time lock on the vault that contained
the sacks that had been tampered with.
On bringing the matter to the atten
tion of his superior, the latter admitted
that he alone was responsible for any
deficit. This was on Tuesday.
Widber had promised Montanya that
he would come to the office yesteiday
morning and fix matters up. Montanya
waited until noon, but Widber failed
to put in an appearance. Montanya
then sought the Mayor In order to In
form him of the state of affairs that
existed In the Treasurer's office. It
was not until after 2 o'clock that he
found Mayor Phelan. The latter at
once put the police authorities In pos
session of all the known facts. A
search was immediately instituted for
"Widher, and the police took chargi of
the Treasurer's oflice.
At about 4 o'clock Mayor Phelan,
Auditor Broderick, Deputy District At
torney Hosmar, City Attorney Cres
well, Judge Tmutt and Chief Lees went
Into conference in the Treasurer's of
fice. They decided to begin immediate
investigation, and statements were
taken In shorthand of each of the of
fice employes. All the moneys were
placed under lock and seal, and a
thorough examination of the funds
will be made to-day.
The news was not made public about
the City Hall until after 4 o'clock, but
ufter the first word got out it spread
like wildfire, and the threatened war
with Spain became a secondary matter
of interest.
It is a notorious fact that for many
weeks Widber went to a certain saloon
on Stockton street at about 6 o'clock
every evening. Here he met Thomas
A. McGowan and is reported to have
received reports from him of the re
sults of the day's races, and to have
placed commissions with McGowan for
the following day. Widber is also the
reputed owner of a number of race
homes. Rubicon, said to be one of the
animals owned by Widber. won the
last race at Ingleside yesterday. He
â was played heavily by McGowan and
his friends, and was entered in the
name of McGo\*an.
According to the statement of one of
tlio deputies in the City Treasurer's
office, Widber was under a bond of only
$100,000, with the Fidelity and Casualty
Company ot Maryland as surety. The
smallness of the bond occasioned con
siderable comment yesterday, as there
are times when the City Treasurer has
the custody of more than $2,000,000.
While the shortage discovered thus
far is believed to be not less than $116,
000, it is possible that this amount may
be increased, and materially, when the
Investigation is completed.
With one exception this is the largest
loss ever sustained by the city by de
falcation. Alexander Austin, who was
Tax Collector of this city many years
ago, stole $275,000, which was lost in
mining stock speculations. He had this
money deposited in bank In his own
*' ame for several years pending the de
cision of the Supreme Court relatiye to
the tax under which this money had
been collected. The money had been
paid under protest. When Austin's de
falcation was discovered he commr.tel
â uiclde by shooting himself. Another no
table defaulter in the city's employ was
Chief Deputy Treasurer Cassebohm,
who served under Charles Hubert. Cas
sebohm got away with $20,000. He also
committed suicide by shooting himself
when his crime was discovered. When
Cassebohm saw the experts come into
his office he took his hat, went hornÂ» I
and blew his brains out.
As shown by the City Directory.
Widber lived with his mother at the
Marchioness, 158 Golden Gate avenue.
Inquiry at that place revealed the
fact that son and mother had moved j
several months ago and had taken |
apartments at the Baldwin. Their ]
apartments were upon the second floor. |
Widber occupied room 132, facing upon
Powell street, while his mother had
room 168, which is on the opposite side
of the house.
Widber and his mother went to live
at the Baldwin upon December 1, 1597,
and at the office the head clerk de
clared that the Treasurer's bill was
paid in full to date, but that he had
given no intimation that he was going
to give up his room. He always paid j
his bill promptly and appeared to live
a quiet and unassuming life.
He was not at the hotel yesterday
nor had he been seen by any of the
employes of the house. It was posi
tively learned that he did not sleep
there on Tuesday night, for when the
maid went into his room at noon yes
terday she found that the bed had not
been slept in, but that it was slightly
disturbed, as might have been caused
by any one placing a valise upon It to
pack clothes in.
Mr?. J. H. Widber, the mother of the
Treasurer, and her sister, Mrs. S. A.
Miller, had Just gone Into the ladies'
cafe to dine about 6 o'clock when they
received the first intimation of the big
defalcation. The ladies had taken their
seats when the waiter told them of
| the report that Widber had defaulted.
! For a moment the mother of the unfor
j tunate man seemed hardly to realize
the dreadful news; then as the terrible
meaning of the words gradually
dawned upon her she managed by al
most superhuman control to rise
â  quietly from her seat and go to her
j room, accompanied by her sistor.
Once behind the friendly protection
1 of her own door the poor, heart-broken
! woman gave way to her grief in tears.
; The severe agitation of her feelings
I completely prostrated her and she was
1 unable to speak. Mrs. Miller, with sis
terly solicitude, did everything in her
power to comfort her, and finally got
her to bed.
Mrs. Widber told her sister that she
knew nothing of the whereabouts of
her son or of his habits, for he was
supposed to be by the entire family a
model young man. The last time that
they saw Widber was on Monday even
i ing. Mrs. Widber and Mrs. Miller were
walking upon Market street when they
passed him, and a few words were ex
changed between mother and son. He
seemed then to be in the best of spirits
and there was nothing in his manner
to show that he was financially em
barrassed.
Mrs. Miller said that WMdber's fam
i ily knew nothing abo-ut his business or
j of his having any financial troubles.
She said: "We would the very last to
'â â  know anything bad about him, for we
had no reason to expect anything of
i that kind. We had not seen him since
' we met him on Market street on Mon
: day afternoon. Neither his mother nor
I any of us have the slightest idea where
he is or has gone to."
For the present Mrs. Widber will re
| main at the Baldwin, as she is said to
i possess considerable means of her own.
! She would see no one last night except
i her sister.
Attorney Thomas A. McGowan, who
is reputed to be an agent of Treasurer
; Widber, was rather reticent last even
â  ing when questioned concerning any
, scheme operated by the Treasurer
; which could result in such an amount
of money being spent in such a short
: space of time.
"I have handled a few legal cases
i for the missing man," said Mr. *Me
' Gowan last evening, "but I have never
had any dealings with him on the race
courses or other gambling places. It
has been reported that he was an
owner of certain horses which are run
ning at the present time, but if so I
â am not aware of the fact. The only
thing in which he has placed his money
is in a mine situated in Grass Valley.
I am well aware of the fact that he
has spent considerable money there,
but just how much is a question. I
am surprised that he has taken advan
tage of his position and hope that the
entire matter will soon be satisfactor
ily settled."
At midnight Mayor Phelan.gave out
the following as a result of the investi
gation held last night. ITe said:
"The total amount of Widber's defal
cation is not positively known, but so
far it has been ascertained that there
is a loss of $116,000, of which amount
$15,000 belongs to the collateral in
heritance tax fund and $25,000 to the
Public Administrator, while theamount
abstracted from the sacks is probably
$70,000.
j "On December 27 last the deputy
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THTTRSDAY, APRIL 21, 1898.
Treasurer, Montanya, put the money,
which was in a hundred sacks, each
containing $5000 in gold, into the in
terior vault. The sacks were sealed
with the Mint seal. Widber admitted
to his deputy that he is a defaulter and
that the defalcations had occurred since
that time. The money was last count
ed on March 25 by the Mayor, Auditor
and Superior Judge Bahrs.
"Seventy sacks were taken out and
examined and the seals found to be all
right. The other thirty sacks were also
examined and found correct. In put
ting the sacks back Montanya found
that one of them was light and called
Widber's attention to it. He was told
that it was all right and the Treasurer
instructed him to put it back into the
vault.
HOW THE STEAL WAS DISCOVERED.
Chief Deputy Treasurer flu la Montanya Tells of Idler's
Admissions and Threats of Suiciie.
M. de la Montanya Jr., the Chief Deputy Treasurer, who made the
discovery of the immense shortage of City and County Treasurer Wid
ber and gave the Information to the authorities which led to W r idber's
exposure and arrest, made the following statement of his part in the
sensational matter:
"Some time after they counted the cash on March 25 I noticed that
one of the sacks was wrong â that the seal was broken on a sack that
was supposed to contain $5000. This seal Is of lead and is what is known
as a 'mint' seal. Made suspicious by this discovery, I examined all the
money in the vault and ascertained that there were sixteen sacks that
weighed light. Each of these was supposed to contain $5000. The
count was made by weighing the sacks. From the sound of these light
sacks I Judged they contained silver. As yet none of the money in
these sacks has actually been counted.
"Taking for granted that they are filled with silver, there would be
$250 in each sack. This would make an aggregate of $4000 in the six
teen sacks, or a shortage of $76,000. This money belonged to the gen
eral fund.
"Mr. Widber had sole charge of the collateral Inheritance tax
monoy, and also of the moneys belonging to the Public Administrator.
These funds were also manipulated so as to leave a shortage of
$15,000 in the collateral inheritance tax fund, and $25,000 in the Public
Administrator's account.
"The accounts of all the other offices are correct so far as I know.
I mention this because this exposure will cause considerable worry
throughout every department in the City Hall, and the knowledge that
no other office than those mentioned Is involved will make the men
feel easy.
"The sacks of money that were tampered with came originally
from banks and those who paid heavy taxes. They had never been
counted, as the mint seal was accepted as a guarantee that the correct
amount was In them.
"My examination of the sacks showed that the seal had not been
broken, but that the string around the sack had been cut close to the
seal and had afterward been retied in such a way as to leave the knot
concealed by the seal.
"I made the discovery of the first broken seal the day before yes
terday (Monday). I continued my examination of the Backs yesterday
(Tuesday) morning. When Mr. Widber came into the office I demanded
an explanation from him. This was about 11 a. m. Tuesday. Our con
versation took place in his private office.
"I told him I had counted the money in the vault that, contained the
$.'OOO sacks and that I had found a shortage. I asked him If those
sacks contained silver, and he said they did. I added that there was
probably about $250. in that case, in each sack. He replied that that
was probably so. I then asked him what his shortage would be. He
said that his books were correct, but that the amount of cash on hand
is not. I since discovered the other two shortages which I have men
tioned.
"I reported the matter to the Mayor to-day, as soon after noon as I
could find him â that is, about 2 o'clock. I did not report it sooner be
cause I wanted to make # an examination that would Justify me in mak
ing the exposure.
"Mr. "Widber, while I was speaking to him. admitted that he alone
was responsible for the whole matter, and that there was no one to
blame but himself. I went to Mr. Widber In reference to the matter
because I knew no one else who would undertake such a large defalca
tion. I don't know as a fact who did it, though Widber admitted that
he had made the substitution of the silver for gold.
"Mr. Widber and myself are the only two who have the combination
of the time lock on the vault that contains the money belonging to the
general fund. This lock can be opened at any time by a person who
has the combination, and there was nothing to prevent Mr. Widber
getting into the vault during the night, after everybody had left the
office. It will be seen from these facts that the blame for this matter
lies between Mr. Widber and myself. It was a knowledge of this that
led me to be very careful as well as secret in making the Investigation
and in not reporting it sooner than I did. I wanted to clearly estab
lish the fact that I was blameless in the matter.
"I have no knowledge of how Mr. Widber disposed of the money, or
what induced him to take it. Ido not know that he played the races,
although he might have played them through some agent without my
knowing anything about it. I know he has spent some money on a
mining property that he is interested In near Grass Valley, and I be
lieve that he is interested in several other mines.
"I saw Mr. Widber last Tuesday afternoon In the office, where he
remained Until about 4:15 p. m. At the time I spoke to him about this
matter he admitted his guilt and said that he was going to kill him
self. I told him that would not do, as he was young and might be able
to straighten things out. He then said that he would wait until morn
ing and would then try to fix things up. This was on Tuesday. He was
not around the office to-day, and so far as we could learn he was not
seen by any one in the city to-day."
"This aroused the suspicions of Mon- j
tanya and the next day he communi- I
cated them to one of the other depu
ties in the office. Some days after
Montanya made another examination
and found silver in the light sacks In- â 
stead of gold. He went to Widber and j
demanded that the amount be made j
good and the Treasurer drew his per-
Bonal check for $5000 upon the Bank of
Commerce and the amount was made
good.
"From that time on until last Mon
day, when Montanya found sixteen i
light sacks, there was nothing to arousu '>
his suspicions. This fact, however, pre- i
cipitated the climax. Montanya ac- ]
ctwed Widber to his face of the theft, 'â 
and the latter admitted that he was a
I'faulter and said that he alone was
responsible.
"The abstraction of the money from
the sixteen sacks must have beei done j
Si.:ce Lecember 27, and Widber admit- I
ted to Montanya that it was. Mucn o\ |
it may rave been taken from the Â«<ack3
sine-* I' arch 25, as since that ti.me the
Tn merer has been known to have been
in the office after office hours and
at nipht also."
Mayor Phelan was very emphatic In j
the declaration that in counting the !
money it has been the custom to accept
the Mint seals for the amount in the
sacks. The commission, he said, al
ways selects one. two or three sacks at
hazard and counts the money, but the
last time that the money was checked J
over the Mayor, the Auditor and Judge i
Bahrs, representing the commission,
whose duty it is to count the money,
displayed the sublimest faith in the
Mint seals and did not make an actual
count of any of the sacks and conse
quently they discovered no deficit. Had
they even broken any of the seals they
might have discovered the loss, but
they did not do so, and as a conse- |
quence of their negrlect the public <
money was stolen. The exact amount
of the defalcation will probably be defl- i
nitely known to-day, when the official
count is made.
THE ARREST.
Widber Taken Into Custody on
His Ranch Near Walnut
Creek.
WALNUT CREEK. April 20.â About
4 o'clock this afternoon Augustus C.
Widber, the defaulting treasurer of the
City of San Francisco, accompanied by
a friend, drove into this city and left
shortly afterward for Widber's ranch,
between this place and Alma. Young
Widber seemed very despondent, but
the reason for this frame of mind was
not known by the residents here until
Borne time after, when Constable C. E.
Palmer left for Widber's ranch to ar
rest him for embezzling the municipal
funds of the city and county of San
Francisco.
The afternoon train from San Fran
cisco brought among other passengers
another friend of Widber's named
Jordan, who came here to be with Wid
ber, it evidently being feared that the
absconding Treasurer would take his
own life. Jordan went to the ranch,
and a little later Constable Palmer,
with Widber in custody, accompanied
by the Treasurer's two friends, re
turned to town In a buggy.
About 7:45 o'clock the quartet started
for Oakland behind a fast team. It
was learned that their destination was
the Fashion stables on Broadway,
Oakland. Widber did not make any
statement while here.
WHAT WIDBER SAYS.
Admits His Guilt and Declares
He Alone Is Involved.
Widber and his custodians landed at
the Market-street ferry at twenty min
utes past eleven last night and were
driven direct to the City Hall. He was
conducted to the private office of Chief
Lees, who at once went to the Treas
urer's office to notify Mayor Phelan
and the others of Widber's arrival.
Messrs. Phelan, Broderick and Cres
well and Judge Troutt hurrk 1 down
the long corridor and were soon
closeted with the defaulter. Besides
these gentlemen and Chief Lees there
were present at the interview Constable
Palmer, Thomas Sullivan, who went to
Walnut Creek with Widber and was
detained as a witness, and a stenog
rapher.
Mayor Phelan conducted the exami
nation, Widber answering such ques
tions as he saw fit promptly; others he
ignored or turned aside. The prisoner,
though entirely sober, bore evidence of
having been drinking heavily, from the
effects of which he had not yet fully re- I
covered. He was exceedingly nervous |
; and seemed to hold himself together
with an effort.
"Are you aware of any shortage in
the funds in your custody?" asked the
Mayor.
"I am," came the prompt reply.
"Who took the money?"
"I did."
"Is anybody else Implicated?"
"No; I alone am responsible. There
was nobody in with me."
"How much did you take?"
"I have no idea. I kept no account
of what I took. When I wanted any
money I watched my opportunity and
helped myself."
"Mr. Widber, It has been stated that
you have been seen in your office at
night and that you probably took the
money there. Is that true?"
"No; I took it all in the daytime. I
did not take any at night."
"But how did you manage to get
away with so much money when the
clerks were present?"
"It was very risky; I had to watch
! for an opportunity and slip into the
vault unobserved."
"How long have your peculations
been going on .'
"Oh, the money has all been taken
within a year."
"But can't you tell when you took
the first money?"
"No; it has been within a year;
that's near enough."
Widber then described, In response to
the Mayor's questioning, how he man
aged to abstract the coin. He would
trke a sack containing $5000 in fold,
and, sealed with the Mint seal, which
covers the string the sack is tied with.
Deftly cuttinr; the string he would
work it through the seal without in
juring the latter.
Then abstracting the gold he would
refill the sack with silver, and with the
aid of a needle he would run a new
string under the seal and fasten it so
that a casual inspection would never
discover that the sack had been tam
pered with.
The needle Wldber used for this work
was found in the vault by Chief Deputy
Montanya.
Mayor Phelan next questioned Wid
bor as to how he had used the money
taken from the treasury.
In reply he said he had sunk some of
it in a mine at Grass Valley, more went
into the Walnut Creek property, some
was used to purchase property on
Castro street in this city, and at Moun
tain View, while the races absorbed a
considerable share of it.
"What induced you to first begin this
work?" asked the Mayor.
"Hard times. I had some property
and to save it I had to raise money;
then other demands on me were made
and I took more."
"Did you visit the race tracks?"
"No; I sent the money out."
"Whom did you send it by?"
"Now, that doesn't make any differ
ence. I took the money and am respon
sible for it; I don't propose to drag
anybody else into this affair."
All attempts to get anything further
out of Widber were fruitless, and after
the interview the Treasurer was locked
up in room 6, opposite the Chief's office,
in charge of detectives.
*
ONLY THE BEGINNING.
His Friend Tom Sullivan Hints
of Sensations to
Come.
OAKLAND, April 20.â The team that
brought the party into Oakland made
very fast time and arrived in town
nearly an hour before they were ex
pected.
As the party sat in the Fashion sta
bles waiting for the narrow-gauge
train, Widber refused to talk. He was.
protected from the little crowd that
gathered as much as possible by his
friend, Tom Sullivan. Tom, however,
told enough of a story to suggest that
the defalcation and arrest of Widber
are but an opening chapter in a sensa
tional series of events yet to be devel
oped.
"Widber and I have been friends for
years," said Sullivan, "and perhaps I
know as much about his affairs as he
knows himself. We went to school to
gether and our companionship has
never been broken. I had no idea It
would come to this. It is not new to
me, and I was told in the city that it
would all be settled and no one would
be any the wiser. I believed those who
called themselves his friends, but I
now find that they were not to be
trusted.
"Widber is not to blame. There are
others in this affair. He has a story
to disclose that will astonish San
Francisco. He has been hounded for
the past five years, but he has endured
everything and has not said a word.
The reason I am with him now is to
save his life. Had I not been his com
panion for the past twenty-four hours
he would now be in the hands of the
Coroner instead of the police. I took
a contract, as a friend, to keep him
alive in spite of his own desires, and I
have carried it out. I have kept my
part. Why did not the rest of his
friends keep theirs?
"I know more of Widber than any
one else, and he is to be pitied, not
blamed. He is at this time the under
dog, but his time will come, and if he
be not exonerated the facts will show
who is really to blame in this matter.
Widber has been a tool, but if he is a
criminal the fault lies with others.
"Yesterday I met him at the City-
Hall and he was depressed. I had
some conversation with him and he
said, 'Good by, Tom, I am going to
leave you.' Although I knew something
of his trouble I was surprised, and
asked for an explanation. He said,
'Tom, I am going to die to-night.' I
took an nath that he should not, and I
determined to stay with him. I did so.
I brought him over here, and our plan
was for him to stay on his mother's
ranch, about two miles from Walnut
Creek, until this business was straight
ened out.
" I was to stay with him, and, as I
said, keep him alive. How many times
I have prevented him ending his career
the world shall never know. We had
not been at the ranch long before
we were made aware of the fact that
his friends had gone back on their
word and that the whole business was
made public. It was planned that he
was to keep out of the way until every
thing had blown over, but instead he
returned in the custody of officers.
"Widber has a history, and no one
knows it better than I. It is a ro
mance, but so long as I live the world
shall never know it unless he makes it
public. This is but the first chapter,
but there is much to follow. He has
suffered for years silently and uncom
plainingly, but this is too much. He
will never take this dose. I have talked
with him and know how he feels about
it. He will let tlose suffer who are to
blame. I feel the same way about it
too. Things will be lively enough when
the whole truth is known."
As the party drove in from Walnut
Creek they were met about six miles
out by Detectives Wren and Cody,
who had gone from the city to get Wid
ber from Constable Palmer. They all
crossed to San Francisco on the 10:45
narrow gauge ferry.
WIDBER A GOOD THING.
Constable E. C. Palmer and Captain
Callundan were two of the first officers
on the scene, and they aided In making
the arrest. When they found Widber
he was making preparations to start
for San Francisco in company with his
friend Sullivan, who said:
"Widber spent his money in mining,
racing and real estate transactions,
being a 'sucker' for almost everybody
who wanted to work off a feasible
scheme. He spent about ten thousand
on the races. Though he has about
$60,000 in property, he cannot make
good the defalcation. He did not spend
his money on women, as was reported."
Captain Callundan said: "We made
the arrest without the least trouble.
The man was on his way here. I got
word from the fidelity Company, which
was on his bonds, that he was wanted
and I started for him. The arrest was
easy and the man talked when he was
first taken. He had evidently been
drinking a great deal and said that he
owned a string of five race horses on
which he had lost a great deal of
money."
"NOTHING TO SAY."
Chief of Police Lees Seems De-Â«
termined to Shield the Dis
graced Treasurer.
For some unexplained reason Chief
Lees endeavored in every way last
night to prevent Widber's confession
from reaching the public through tha
press.
After Wfdber was brought back to
this city he was at once taken to tha
office of the Chief, where he was closet
ed with him for over an hour.
After the interview the scheming
head of the Police Department coolly
informed the reporters that he had
"nothing to say." When asked if Wid
ber had made a statement to him the
self-imposed Czar of the department
shook his head and walked away.
On account of his friendship for Wid
ber it is strongly believed that Chief
Lees will do all in his power to save
â  the disgraced treasurer from spending
! a long term in the penitentiary. It fs
said that he knew for some time that
Widber was going the pace that kills.
HERE ARE PEDIGREES FOR YOU.
The Grosvenor family (Dukes of West
minster) trace their pedigree in England
back to 1066, having come over with Wil
liam the Conqueror, while the family in
Normandy from which they are directly
descended flourished there for at least a
century and a half before the Conquest,
so that the family pedigree goes back for
close upon a thousand years. The most
ancient family in Great Britain is that
of the Earl of Mar, in Scotland. Lord
Hailes, speaking of the title, says: "It
existed before our records and before the
era of genuine history, being an earldom
whose origin is lost in antfdjuity." The
Campbells, to whom belongs the present
Duke of Argyll, began in 1390. Of the
400 barons in the British peerage only
about a dozen actually date back 600
years. The most ancient family In the
world is that of the Mikado of Japan,
which has had an unbroken line of de
scent for more than 2500 years, the pres
ent ruler being the 122 dof the line.

CONGRESS
PREPARES
FOR WAR
The House Passes the Bill
Authorizing Call for
Volunteers.
soon the President May Proceed
to Secure an Army Large
Enough to Drive Span
iards From Cuba,
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 20.
The House to-day passed as an
emergency war measure the bill em
powering the President to call out the
volunteer forces and providing for their |
organization. Both the President and
Secretary Alger had urged the impera
tive necessity of passing the bill to-day,
and Chairman Hull of the Military
Committee drove it under whip and !
Bpur. The bill was drafted at the War
Department, introduced in the House !
yesterday and considered and reported
by the committee to-day. No such ex
pedition could have been possible ex
cept under the stress of war pressure.
The bill is permanent in its character.
The principal change made in the bill
as introduced was that the appoint
ment of all regimental officers are to
be made by the Governors of the States
Instead of by the President, as was pro- j
posed originally by the War Depart
ment. This action conforms to the I
practice of the Civil War.
When the House was notified that t> c
President had approved the Cuban rÂ«Â«',-
JuiiiiiiÃ the announcement Â»v is greeted
with a tremendous outburst of applause,
Chairman Hull of the Military AJtaira
Committee Immediately asked the unaii -
moua consent of the Houso cor the con
sideration of a bill authorizing the Presi
denl to call out volunteers. He sari he
had just received a message from the
White House urging the necessity 1-jv the
tit-ss-age of the bill to-day.
The House went into committee of >he
\Ui..|r> to consider the bill.
shyers d.i of Texas criticised the pcov
tiou authorizing the President to ap
uoi it the staff officers subject to the con
tiraation of the Senate or autiorlzn.g I
Mm to assign these officers from the refc-
Uiar army ur the volunteer officers ot the
rollUta
Hull explained that the committee
unanimously held that past precedents
Bhould he followed and that the Gover
f States should retain the power to
I all regimental omcei"s. The joint i
resolution passed by Congress authorizing
the President to employ the militia force
of tiie I'nitcd States he said would not
: the present situation. He felt au
thored to say that if we were to t gnt
this war it would !Â»â  with volunteers and
nut the militia forces.
Hull read the following teles; am he re
ceived from Secretary Algor this uiorn-
Inp: "1 hope you will introduce your bill
this morning. Time is now very valuaple.
On the whole. 1 am inclined t â ; thinx ihat
requiring commissions to be signed by the
President for the militia would l-e cause
for action and opposition by 'he Gover
nors, who naturally might reel that this
was taking some of their power tr->m
them. Can you consistently ch.i'ige that
and hasten its passage?"
Johnson (R.) of Indiana at this point at
tempted to secure time to address the
House regarding his attitu.le on the gen
eral situation. If war was to come, he
Bald, he was ready to BU3p>rt any meas
ure to prosecute it to a successful conclu
sion. But before hostilities began he |
thought the House should K've him a
chance to speak. The recjjest met with
much opposition and was refused.
Cox (D.) of Tennessee, the senior mi
nority member of the commit cc. gave the
bill as innditlod his indorsement.
Marshall (R.) of Illinois and Savers
both expressed the opinion that this
measure should be passed forthwith. We
were on the verge of war. The measure
was asked for by the President and the
Secretary of War, said Sayers, and there
should be no further quibbling.
A question arose as to whether, under
the provisions of the bill, additional legis
lation would not be necessary to permit
the President to call out volunteers.
To meet this deficit Lacey offered an
amendment authorizing the President to
raise Volunteers when Congress shall
have authorized him to do so, or when
he has been authorised "to call into the
actual service of the United States the
militia of the several States."
The amendment was adopted.
McMiilln iD.) of Tennessee moved to
reduce the term of enlistment of the
volunteer forces for three years, as pro
vided in the bill, to one year. He thought
many of the young men of the country
would not be willing to enlist for three
years.
Hull replied that it was not expected
that the war would be a long one un-
Ipss Spain resorted to guerrilla warfare,
but he did not believe a three years 1
term would terrorize the young men.
The amendment was defeated.
Handy offered a substitute, authorizing
the enlistment of 400.000 men for the war.
He said it was distinctly a temporary
measure, under the approval of eminent
military authorities.
The substitute w;is lost.
Talbot (V.) of South Carolina warned
the Houso that war with Spain was not
a light thing. Gentlemen who thought it
would be over in a few days would be
Badly disappointed, in his mind.
"I'reincmber at the opening of the last
war " said he. "Men at the North and
South believed it would not last thirty
days. I heard a man agree to drink all
the blood that was spilled. Every coun
try In Europe may be drawn into the
encounter before we get through with
Wttle (P.) Of Arkansas offered an
amendment, which was ;iereed to provid
ing that the Indian Territory shall fur
nish its quota.
Llnney <R) of North Carolina offered
an amendment providing that nothing in
the bill should be construed to prevent
companies and regiments from selecting
their own officers. The power to select
officers to fill vacancies, be said, would
be an incentive to enlistment. The
tyrannous discipline of officers, he said,
wns more dreaded by soldiers than the
bullets and bayonets of the enemy. '
The Linn.*y amendment was defeated.
An amendment was adopted providing
for a chaplain for each regiment.
An amendment was adopted providing
that regimental and all other medical offi
cers should keep the records of all officers
or men sick or wounded, and that upon
the disbandment of the organization
they should be filed in the records of the
pension office and War Department.
Section 15 was amended so as to provide
that the Governors of States instead of
the President might appoint officers in
the regular army to the grade of field
officers, in the volunteer army, such ap
pointments to depend upon the consent
of the President.
Cannon, chairman of the Appropriation
Committee, offered as an additional sec
tion an amendment providing that all
Government employes called into the mil
itary or naval service of the United
States while In service should be granted
leave of absence, and upon honorable dis
charge should be entitled to resume their
employment at the samo pay, and it also
provided, where necessary, for temporary
appointments to fill vacancies.
Faris (8..) of Indiana said the amend
ment was the legitimate outgrowth of the
civil service humbug. This proposition
contained the biggest bounty ever con
templated in enlisting soldiers.
The amendment was defeated.
The bill was then passed without di
vision, and at 5:15 p. m. the House ad
journed.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 20.
During the five hours of discussion
in the Senate this afternoon of its re
cent action on the Cuban resolutions, in
the course of which several extended
speeches were made by Senators who
voted against the conference report up
on the resolutions, only one point was
developed. That was by Foraker of
Ohio In the course of a brief statement
concerning the recognition of the Cu
ban republic's independence. He said
that on the very day the ultimatum
had been sent to Spain this Govern
ment had practically recognized the re
public of Cuba, This utterance, com
ing from a member of the Foreign Re
lations Committee, created a profound
sensation among the Senators. Being
pressed for the source of his informa
tion, Foraker replied that It was "posi
tive but not official."
The following resolution was present
ed by Allen of Nebraska:
"That in the opinion of the Senate no
circumstances can arise in the relations
of the United States of America and the
kingdom of Spain that will warrant an
increase in the interest-bearing bonded
indebtedness of this Government or that
will in any way interfere with the form
of financial affairs of the United States
on lines laid down in the National Peo
ple's party platform of July, 1896."
The resolution went over under objec
tion.
Consideration of the sundry civil bill
was continued, and Cockrell of Missouri
continued his speech on the Cuban ques
tion begun yesterday.
Vest of Missouri inquired sotto voce of
Cockrell if he proposed to "take the back
track" again to-day. In concluding Cock
rell said that he desired to have passed
by Congress such resolutions as would
dt-clare the Cuban patriots free and inde
pendent, and not the slightest restraint
or constraint should be placed on them.
They would, he doubted not, be able in a
short time to gain their freedom.
Teller of Colorado, speaking upon the
same subject, said that he had no desire
unduly to criticise the President or the
administration. He had felt from the be
ginning there should be a unanimity of
action on the part of all parties in Con
gress if th<:-re was to be warâ a war which
he thought mieht have been averted if
the preceding administration, and even
the present one, had acted properly its
part in the diplomatic negotiations.
Foraker called attention to statements
made in the Senate two years ago by the
present Secretary of State, Mr. Sherman,
to the effect that the Cuban republic had
an established form of government, ad
ministered by officials of high standing,
character and ability. He held, therefore,
that if those statements were true two
years ago their truth had been strongly
accentuated since that time and that it
was further entirely proper for the Unit
ed States to recognize the Government of
the Cubans.
It was here that Foraker made his
statement regarding, the official recogni
tion of the representatives of the Cuban
republic. In discussing the diplomatic re
lations between this country and Spain,
.Foraker read from a newspaper clipping
what was said to be a semi-official state
ment, in effect that in a formal dispatch
sent by the President to the Madrid Gov
ernment the Attorney - General had
changed the term "independent govern
ment" to "stable government," the
change being made because "stable" was
the word of diplomacy to be employed
in the circumstances.
When Minister Woodford had inquired
what construction was to bo placed upon
the word "stable," the President had re
plied that it must be regarded as mean
ing "independent." Mr. Woodford had
failed to transmit the President's meaning
to the Spanish Government, fearing that
such a statement made officially might
complicate future negotiations. Foraker
said that it seemed to be the explanation
why the independence of the Cubans had
not been demanded by the President.
Allison of lowa interrupted to say that
he did not think there was any doubt that
the correspondence with Spain would
show that the President had actually de
manded the independence of the Cubans.
In response to an inquiry from Pasco
of Florida, requesting him to be more
specific, Allison said: "I cannot, as a wit
ness, be very specific on hearsay evidence.
The President in his correspondence with
the Spanish Government did say that
there must be an independent government
in Cuba, This demand was transmitted
not only through Mr. Woodford, but also
through the Spanish Minister at Wash
ington to his Government. I cannot be
more definite at this time."
Foraker, resuming the trend of his re
marks, said the understanding was that
the President was endeavoring through
diplomatic negotiations to' promote the
independence of the people of Cuba, iie
thought the negotiations to-dayâ the sign
ing by the President of the resolutions of
Congress and the sending of an ultimatum
to Spainâ would amount practically to a
recognition of the independence of the
Cuban republic, and be thought it would
be so developed by to-morrow morning.
He had no doubt that the Cuban republic
would, of course, be recognized. Foraker
said he believed that criticism of the
Provident at this time was out of place.
Instead of caviling over these matters,
he deemed it desirable to secure a unity
of action. He had stood squarely by his
conviction in favor of independence, but
was anxious to secure action, and had,
therefore, agreed to the striking out of
the recognition clause. It was not known
now whether the President had made
mistakes or not. Only the future could
properly and truthfully develop the Presi
dent's position.
Tlllman asked Foraker for a more ex
plicit statement and Foraker replied:
"I think I made the statement that some
representatives of this Government were
dealing with the representatives of a
Government that will amount to thisâ
that the Government will, in the imme
diate future, be dealing with them just
as It occurred to me that we should deal
with them if we recognize the Govern
ment."
Tillman asked Foraker if he had no
positive information, to which he replied:
"I have positive information, but it is not
official."
Teller then concluded his speech, hold
ing it to be the duty of all to stand by
the country rather than to seek political
advantage.
Warren of Wyoming paid a high tribute
to the President, and said that it was
evident from the speeches thus delivered
that the political opponents of the Pres
ident were aligning their noses, and the
fight to come next fall would see all the
other animals in the "zoo" against the
elephant, and. as is usual, the elephant
would have his trunk with him and oc
cupy the center of the ring.
Stewart of Nevada followed in an ex
tended discussion of the Cuban problem
In the course of a speech by Allen, in
which he further explained the position
of those who voted agaist the conference
report on the Cuban resolutions, Carter
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AFRfL 21, 1898.
Interrupted him to say that flags were
being displayed throughout the country,
troops were being mobilized and the navy
was preparing for action. Through all
this the sundry civil and naval appropri
ation bills, both carrying money for the
support of the Government, were being
delayed.
"Why," he inquired, "could not the
thirty-five Senators who voted against
the conference report admit that they had
made a mistake and let us now proceed
with a united front to uphold the Presi
dent and the country?"
Allen replied that a suggestion, involv
ing a reference to the American flag was
not proper. He had carried that flag, he
said, amid shot and shell, and knew what
it meant to stand by It.
Carter remarked that nobody was dis
posed to question the patriotism of the
Nebraska Senator or of the thirty-five
who voted against the Cuban conference
report.
"I believe," he continued, "that in the
present circumstances it is better to
make preparations for the coming war
than to make exculpatory remarks or in
criminating questions."
At the conclusion of Allen's remarks
Thurston said that at 11:24 o'clock to-day,
when the President signed the Cuban
resolutions sent to him by Congress, the
time for party discussion had ended. All
but three Senators had at one time or an
other voted for the resolutions which
were now law, and he thought it the
duty of Senators to uphold the President
and the country with equal unanimity.
"The time will come in the hustings for
discussion of political phases of this
question. Now until Cuba is made free,
until her starving women and children
are fed and clothed; until Spain has been
driven from the Western Hemisphere for
ever, for God's sake let us cease this
political bickering."
Allison then presented an amendment to
the sundry civil bill, appropriating and
making immediately available $473,151
with which to pay Great Britain the
award for Bering Sea claims made by
the joint convention of February 29, 1596.
He nad been urged to place the amend
ment on this 1.111 by the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, instead of waitir"- for
the general deficiency bill. The amend
ment was agree to.
On motion of Allison the Senate at 5:35
o'ciock went into executive session and
Boon afterward adjourned.
"REMEMBER
THE MAINE!"
Throughout the Golden
State Resounds the
Slogan.
Presidio Light Artillerymen
Given an Ovation at
Bakersfield.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, April 20.â The train
bearing the artillerymen from the Pre
sidio to the rendezvous at historic
Chickamauga arrived here this morn-
Ing shortly after 9 o'clock, several
hours behind schedule time. An im
promptu reception had been arranged
and no sooner had the long train
stopped than It was surrounded by
2000 people. The Bakersfield brass band
struck up a lively air. Women and
young girls carrying bouquets and soon
the coaches in which the artillerymen
were riding were crowded .vith fair pa
triots, showering bouquets on the sur
prised soldiers, speaking words of en
couragement and bidding them God
speed on their gallant mission.
"Remember the Maine" was an ad
monition frequently heard.
For a time the artillerymen were
completely nonplused. Finally thvy
gathered and after pouring out to the
fair "enemy" all the chivalric oratory
in their possession they pulled the but
tons from their uniforms and present
ed them to L*.. ladies.
During this demonstration the band
kept up its lively strains. So thrilling
and spontaneous was the affair that
tears were seen to roll down the cheeks
of stroner men. The most touching in
cident came when a feeble old woman,
as soon as the train stopped, rushed up
with a shawl thrown over her head and
exclaimed:
"1 was a nurse all through the civil
war. I want to get into the train to
bless and grasp the hands of those
brave boys."
She was the first to enter the coaches.
A citizen was holding a tiny flag and
on it was penciled "Remember the
Maine." An officer came along and
asked for it, promising the citizen that
if he returned from Cuba he would give
it back to him. He was given the (lag
and by reason of that Incident every
one in Bakersfield Is wearing one of
those little flags having printed upon it
i "Remember the Maine." To-morrow
morning when the infantry comes along
: one of them will be presented to each
soldier.
Near where the train stopped is a
Spanish hotp' around which many al
ways be found many lusty fellows of
Spanish descent. They have been deep-
I ly interested in all the war pews, and
when they saw the cannons and the
i uniforms of the men many of them
t wept bitterly. While most of them are
; good American citizens they still have
I a strong feeling for their mother
I country.
The officers and privates were greatly
i pleased at their reception and much
surprised as well. Their horses were
watered here. Several young men of
Bakersfield will attempt to enlist in the
infantry when it reaches here.
SALINAS, April 20.â since the re
ceipt of the war bulletin there is a
. probability that one regiment of vol
i unteer militia win be sent from Cali
i fornia under the provisions of the Hull
i bill. The excitement among the mem
bers of j-roop C and citizens has be
: come great. Knots of people congre
gate on the corners and the boys are
recruiting and say that they will soon
have a full company of one hundred
and three enrolled. Captain M. J.
Burke says that the troop will volun
! teer to go to ' c front or to Cuba as a
j cavalry company in its entirety and
! that they could raise an entire regi
i ment as easily a one company. After
I Inspection last night the members of
', the troop paraded the streets until near
â  midnight, cheering for "Old Glory" and
i shouting "Remember the Maine!" The
enthusiasm increases hourly. To-night
the entire talk is of wÂ»j- and the in
dependence of Cuba.
FORT JONES, April 20.- Citizens of
Scott Valley held a meeting in Fort
Jones to-day and took steps toward
I forming a company of national volun
teer reserves. Major A. G. Myers was
elected chairman and M. F. Beem sec-
I retary. The Fort Jones band furnished
music and national airs were sung by
a quartet. Patriotic speeches were
made, including one by Rev. B. D. Sin
clair, the Episcopal rector, who favored
war if necessary to restore peace In
Cuba. His ringing words evoked tre
mendous applause from the large audi
ence. Signatures were then attached
by those who were willing to join the
reserves. Whenever there is any indi
cation that thÂ£ir services may be need
ed they will meet at the call of the
chairman, organize and begin drilling.
Over one hundred men here have sig
nified a willingness to go if their ser
vices are needed.
STOCKTON, April 20.â Colonel John
son has issued orders to all captains in
the Sixth Regiment to fill their com
panies to the maximum, 103 for each

good shots and hardy fellows.
CHICO, April 20.â The news that the
President had signed the Congressional

AN APPEAL
FOR THRONE
OF HER SON
Speech of Spain's Queen
Regent Presented to
the Cortes.
Christina Sees the War Clouds
Hanging Low and Asks Cas
tilians to Rally in Al
fonso's Support.
MADRID, April 20.â The opening of
the Spanish Cortes to-day was a mag
nificent sight. All the wealth and
beauty of Madrid gathered in the Sen
ate, wh^-e every available foot of
space was occupied. There was a ter
rific crush at the entrance leading to
the Senatorial seats, many of which
were occupied by ladies.
Large bodies of troops were drawn
up outside the building, including the
handsomely uniformed dragoons and
the magnificently attired palace
guards.
All the members of the diplomatic
corps were present in full dress.
The Queen Regent read the speech
from the throne.
The speech began:
"The grave anxieties which saddened
my mind the last time I addressed you
have increased and are heightened by
public uneasiness, conveying the pre
sentiment of danger of fresh and great
er complications as a result of the turn
which events in Cuba have taken.
These complications were brought
about by a section of the people in the
United States, which, seeing that the
autonomy previously offered in my
message was about to be put in force,
foresaw that the free manifestation of
the Cuban people, through its cham
bers, would frustrate forever the
schemes against Spanish sovereignty
which have been plotted by those who,
with resources and hopes sent from the
neighboring coast, have fettered the
suppression of the insurrection in that
unhappy island.
"Should the Government of the
United States yield to this blind cur
rent, the menaces and insults which
we have hitherto been able to regard
with indifference â for they were not
an expression of the sentiments of the
true American nation â would become
intolerable provocations which would <
compel my Government, in defense of
the national dignity, to sever rela
tions with the Government of the
United States."
Continuing, the Queen Regent
said that in the supreme crisis the
Pope "spoke words of peace which
were hearkened to by my Govern
ment in the consciousness of right
and in strict performance of interna
tional duties/
Her Majesty added: "Spain's
gratitude is due to the Pope and also
to the great powers, whose action
strengthens my conviction that
Spain's cause deserves universal
sympathy and that her conduct mer
its unanimous approval. It is pos
sible, however, that an act of aggres
sion is imminent and that not the
sanctity of our rights, nor the mod
eration of our conduct, nor the ex
pressed wish of the Cuban people
freely manifested, may serve to re
strain the passions and hatred let
loose against the Spanish fatherland.
"In anticipation of this critical mo
ment, when reason and justice will
have for their support only Spanish
courage and the traditional energy of
our people, I have hastened the as
sembling of the Cortes and the supreme
decision of Parliament will doubtless
sanction the unalterable decision of my
Government to defend our rights, with
whatsoever sacrifices may be imposed
on us in accomplishing this task."
Continuing, her Majesty said:
"Possibly, however, the peace ef
forts may fail to control the evil pas
sions existing against Spain. Lest
this moment arrive, I have sum
moned the Cortes to defend our
rights, whatever sacrifice they may
entail.
"Thus identifying myself with the
nation I not only fulfill the oath 1
swore in accepting the regency, but I
follow the dictates of a mother's heart,
trusting to the Spanish people to
gather behind my son's throne and to
defend it until he is old enough to de
fend it himself, as well as trusting to
the Spanish people to defend the honor
and the territory of the nation."
The Queen Regent then referred to
the trouble in the Philippine Islands
and, continuing, said: "Although a
dark and gloomy future Is before us
the difficulties are not beyond our
power. W r ith our glorious army, navy
and the united nation against foreign
aggression, we trust in God that we
shall overcome without stain on our
honor the baseless and unjust attacks
made upon us."
MADRID'S POPULACE
MAD WITH ENTHUSIASM.
Queen Regent and Boy King Loudly
Welcomed While Journeying
to the Senate Hall.
LONDON, April 20.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail, tele
graphing Wednesday, says: On few
occasions has Madrid witnessed such
scenes of popular enthusiasm as to
day, when the Queen Regent, accom
panied by the King, dressed in the uni
form of the infantry cadets and wear
ing the Insignia of the Golden Fleece,
traveled In state with all the pomp that
makes the Spanish court famous,
from the palace to the Senate hall.
The distance is very short, not more
than four minutes' walk. The Plaza
de Oriente and the Plaza de Min
stress, which the court and pro
cession had to traverse, were most
The fac-slmile ***& s/0/r *"* ** on ever wrapper
signature of Wu^/zZctfZj&tt â¢ of CASTOEIA. v
densely crowded, chiefly with the peo
ple of the upper and middle classes.
The moment the batteries announced
the departure of the Queen Regent and
the King the excitement became in
tense. When at the end of a long pro
cess of hussars, royal piquers, state
coaches, carrying the chief ladies in
waiting, the chamberlains of the court
and the grandees of Spain, the royal
carriage appeared at the gate of the
palace, the enthusiasm burst forth in
a long and interminable cheering, such
as had not been heard in Spain since
the day when the late King Alfonzo re
turned from Paris.
The infantry, which lined the way to
the Senate, the cavalry and the mount
ed civil guards, sent to preserve order,
had hard work to keep the crowd, fran
tic with enthusiasm, from approaching
the royal carriage.
The Queen Regent appeared much
moved, though she is usually of im
passive demeanor. The King looked
on the crowd with evident pleasure
with feelings as enthusiastic as theirs
and saluted in military fashion.
"Long live the Queen, long live the
King," and "Long live Spain," were
the cries incessantly given. The spirit
of the crowds in the streets pervaded
the secluded halls of the Senate, and
then the doors were thrown wide open
for the royal persons to enter. Thou
sands of distinguished spectators, who
filled the galleries, Deputies and Sen
ators, rose to their feet and received
the Queen and King with thundering
acclamations.
The hall of session presented a most
animated appearance. It was gay with
a bright note of color. Ladies in spring
costumes filled the front rows of the
galleries. They were most enthusias
tic, cheering and waving their hand
kerchiefs and fans. It was long be
fore silence was established.
The Queen Regent and the King,
escorted by commissions from the Sen
ate and the lower chamber, who had
met them â -.(. tho gate, took seats at
th<Mr thrne. The Government's Min
isters, the captains-general, the grand
ees and members of the court stood on
one side and the diplomatic corps on
the other. Senor Saprnsta advanced and
handed the Queen Regent the speech
from the throne, all others standing.
It is against Spanish etiquette to in
terrupt the reading of a speech from
the throne, but the enthusiasm and
emotion were too great, and the sol
emnity of the occasion was too im
pressive. Twice had her Majesty to
stop when the cheers, acclamations
and vivas for Spain, the Queen Regent
and the King made her speaking im
possible. The cheering was still more
frantic -when their Majesties left the
Senate, and so it was in the streets.
Senor Gullon. the Foreign Minister,
to-day received the British Charge
d'Affaires, who put forward on behalf
of his Government an urgent request
for an explanation as to how Spain
will carry out her right, of visiting
ships in the case of war.
SPANISH REFUGEES
DEPART FOR CUBA.
When the Steamer Panama Left New
York There Were Demonstra
tions on the Wharf.
NEW YORK, April 20.â There was a
large crowd on the pier when the Pana
ma sailed for Cuba with Spanish refu
gees aboard and a hostile demonstra
tion was made. Opprobrious epithets
were flung at the departure of the ves
sel. The captain and crew who were
on deck were cursed in voices raised in
the highest pitch.
"Kill them; kill them." "Hurrah for
Cuba," "Down with Spain," were some
of the cries heard. Hissing and fist
shaking continued until the Panama
was well out in the river. There was
not a sound heard from her deck in re
ply. The sailors, who were storing
away a hawser on the afterdeck,
stopped their work momentarily now
and again to look up at their enemies
ashore.
STARS AND STRIPES
HOISTED BY STUDENTS.
Interesting Feature of Arbor Day at
the University of the
Pacific.
SAN JOSE, April 20.â The students of
the University of the Pacific held their
annual arbor day on the campus to-day.
The pupils were out In force. Young men
dressed in their old clothes and were put
at work in gangs to hoe and rake off
weeds and dry leaves from walks and
lawns. The work began at 8 a. m. and
continued steadily until 12:30 o'clock.
Young ladies had, in the meantime, pre
pared an elaborate luncheon, which ah
enjoyed under the shade of the maple
grove. A short programme was given
afterward, â¢ but the principal feature of
the day was the raising of a new flag
over the largest building on the campus-
East Hall.
R. J. Trevorrow '98 presided, and Hugh
Baker '98 presented the flag to Dr. Mc-
Clish, who, in accepting it on behalf of
the university, spoke eloquently of its
meaning and the principles which it had
always symbolized.
The afternoon was given up to amuse
ments, the principal one of which was
tennis, at which game the faculty team
defeated the student team.

and after a few remarks by Chairman
Dray, Hon. Grove L. Johnson read an
address settins forth the Importance of

LABOR'S VOICE
IS PATRIOTIC
The Los Angeles County
Council Quick to
Take Action.
Begins the Organization of a
Company of Skilled
Mechanics.
Will at Once Offer Their Services
in Defense of the Nation's
Honor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 20.â Los An
geles County Council of Labor, repre
senting all organized labor in this
county, at its meeting this evening
passed resolutions to the effect that in
asmuch as organized labor had always
been the bulwark of free institutions in
this country, and that as it had never
been backward in coming to the de
fense of the nation, the patriotism of
members of various trade organizations
would never be questioned in the event
that their services were needed in the
impending war. The resolutions went
on to state that the county council ap
proved of the organization of a com
pany of its members, made up of
skilled mechanics, who wou,ld offer
their services to the regularly consti
tuted authorities.
Delegate Richard J. Colver, repre- j
senting the typographical union, re- i
cited the fact that in the war which i
now seemed imminent the services of
skilled mechanics would be in great de- j
mand by the United States, and, in his
opinion, patriotic, liberty-loving trades
unionists should not wait to be called
upon, but should offer their services j
before any call was made for troops.
He said that while labor had its griev
ances they could not be settled at a
time when the country's flag and the
country's honor had been outraged by
a foreign foe, and when insult to and
murder of American citizens by Spain
were unavenged.
Delegates Fiske and Harlow spoke in
favor of the resolutions. Delegate Har
riman, a socialist member, alone op
posed them. They were adopted with
but two opposing votes.
The muster roll was immediately
opened and signatures secured. The
company will be formed at once. In
all probability Frank Gill, president of
the Council of Labor, will be chosen |
captain. The design that will be fol
lowed is to recruit the company from
those trades that will most likely be
called upon to do effective work, like j
electrical workers. This will be the j
first company of volunteers organized
among the labor unions of the United
States for service in the Spanish-
American war.

KEY WEST, Fla., A; i 20.â Now
that the situation has become gTave so
suddenly the "Jackies" have ceased
their grumbling and naval officers are
awaiting orders to move. Key West
looks more like an armed camp than
ever before. Shore leaves are prac
tically suspended and sailors on shore
are here on business. The Cincinnati
and Marblehead' are coaling; filling
holes in their bunkers caused by doing
picket duty last night.
The swift auxiliary cruiser, Mayflow
er, Lieutenant Commander McKenzie,
has arrived from Newport. She ran
alongside the flagship for orders and
then came to anchor inside to get co:,!.a
She behaved beautifully coming dowrf
and is much admired as she rides at
anchor.
War correspondents are coming in
large numbers. Correspondents of tha
London Times and Daily Telegraph
came last night and will go with tha
squadron. Other English correspond
ents will go with the army of occupa*
tion.
All the coal needed by the warship*
is now on board, but water will ba

condenser now being set up by the
Government near the Custom House.
General Miles and Adjutant General
Corbin, his chief of staff, are expected
here to-morrow to confer with Captain
Sampson about the co-operation of the
army and navy.
I showed naval officers to-day the
dispatch announcing that the Spanish
cruisers Vizcaya and Oquendo had ar
rived at Cape Verde and that the Span
ish fleet would probably move to the
Canaries. They think it indicates that
the Spanish navy will not try to de
fend the Greater Antilles and that
Spain fears the flying squadron may
bombard Barcelona.
I visited the battleships lowa and
Indiana this evening. They are the
only ships of this class attached to the
Key West fleet, but the New York an i
the monitors can also stand in line of
battle. The lowa has four inches < f
steel armor and carries four 12-in?h,
guns in pairs in turrets, besides ei^ht
8- inch guns in pairs in turrets, two on
er;ch beam and a powerful battery of
smaller guns. The Indiana has Har

speed.
News of the signing by President Mc-

A regular fleet of newspaper boats is
lying at anchor .off the island, wit fa

Lively Scrimmage a Feature of
the State Medical Society's
Election.
FRESNO, April 20.â The second day's
session of the State Medical Society
was called to order by Tv. Baid, the
president, at 9 0 o'clock this morning.
The attendance was increased over that
of Tuesday s Fession by the arrival of
about thirty doctors from San Fran
cisco. Some twenty of these rentlemen
were the guests of Pr. Winslow Ander
son. Prominent in the list of those
v ho arrived last night were Drs. Bev
erley Cole, Winslow Andersu*. Farrell,
Yon Hoffman W. E. Hopkins, Ford
and Adams.
In spite of the many exc..ent scien
tific parers submitted polite -, was the
one all-absor. ng question, aid it led
to very v. -leasant results in the after
noon session. Noticeable among the
papers and qr Uio: 3 discussed were
the following: "Brain Surgery," by Dr.
D. D. Crowley of Oakland, the discus
sion being opened by Dr. Bi -Jnard of
Los Angeles; "Stranp"'lated Hernia, or
Report â¢ f Ten Cases," by Dr. Emmet
Rixford of San Francisco: "Where the
Leg Should Be Amputated," by J. P.
Dunn of Oakland; "Present Condition
and Advances in Renal Surgery," by
Dr. L. Bazet of San Francisco.
During the afternoon session the fol
lowing topics were discussed: "Acute
Yellow Atrophy oi the Liver." by Dr.
C. Murphy of Los Angeles; "Pathologi
cal Foundations of the Gastric Fluids
and Their :< "nificance," by A. J. San
derson of St. Helena; "The Relation
Existing Between the Sexual Organs
and Insanity," by Dr. J. W. Robertson
of Livermore; "Si idy of One Hundred
Cases of Epilepsy," by Dr Philip King
Brown.
The election of officers was made the
special feature of business for 3 o'clock,
and when that time was reached the
routine business and election of officers
were taken up. Dr. William LeMayne
Wills of i-.os . ngeles was the first man
recognized by the eh ir. and in an elo
quent speech he nominated Dr. William
Watt Kerr of San Francisco, who has
been the secretary of the society for
ten years, and was elected first vice

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 20.â The steamship
Humboldt brings the offiiclal list of the
dead recovered from the Chilkoot Pass
enow slide of April 3. A number of
new names appear on the list. They
are:
William Carroll, San Francisco.
A. O. Anderson, San Francisco.
Mark Welsh, Butto, Mont.
Henry Yearger, Los Angeles.
Jfff Sailing, Weiser, Idaho.
John Vogle, Los Angeles.
Curtiss C. Turner, Omaha, Nebr.
Albridge D. Bissell, Palarine, 111.
Thomas J. Wall, Hazel, S. Dak.
Albridge D. Bissell is undoubtedly
the A. A. Bissell mentioned in the first
list as being a resident of Seattle. Wil
liam Carroll of San Francisco is prob- i
ably the correct name for W. Carl of
California, as given in the earlier lists.
The only additions to the list of Se
attle dead are the names of Chris John
eon and Oscar Johnson. Several Seattle
people whose names were in the first
list of dead sent out do not appear on
the late list. Among them are Ed
Cook, George Overton, C. R. Homer,
Con Riser, Weed Garrison and A. Chap
pell. Some of these have been heard
from and all are believed to be alive.
Some of the bodies are still held at
Sheep Camp awaiting instructions from
friends or relatives in the States. Oth
ers have been buried near the scene of
the terrible disaster. In the new ceme
tery, provided by Colonei Anderson and
the Federal troops, a number of
mounds show where others have found
thHr last resting place. A number of
bodies have been brought to Seattle on
the steamers and turned over to rela
tives or friends.
Purser Twiggs says that on Friday
night last the work of digging into the
pile that lies across the trail and
marks the site of the crowning dis
aster of the most remarkable rush for
gÂ»ld the world has ever seen had
stopped. Travel has been resumed, and
no more bodies are likely to be recov
ered until the sun melts away the huge
pile of snow that it i 3 believed covers
the remains of possibly a dozen more
victims.
PATROL DUTY OF
THE FLEET CRUISERS.
An Increase of the Vigilance by the
Squadron on Guard at
Key West.
KEY WEST, Fa.. April 20. â The
cruiser Cincinnati is missing from the
squadron to-night. With the Marble
head she went on patrol duty last
right. Hitherto this duty haÃ taken
been aroused over this election for
president, the supporters of Dr. Kerr
claiming that Dr. Anderson had pr d
the expenses of thirty-six members to
come to Fresno- to vote for Dr. McNutt.
Dr. MacMonagle spoke very feelingly
in favor of Kerr, and said that while
he liked and respected Dr. McNutt, he
disapproved of the methods of Dr. An
derson and Dr. McNutt in undertakii-g
to secure the latter's election.
While the voting was in progress Dr.
S. O. L. Potter, a supporter of Dr. Mc-
Nutt, and a member of the faculty of
the College of Physicians and Sur
geons, and Dr. MacMonagle became in
volved in an altercation, and Dr. Pot
ter struck Dr. MacMonagle in the face
with an umbrella. The blow was severe
and made an ugly bruise on Dr. Mac-
Monagle's forehead. During the alter
cation Dr. Potter had exclaimed:
"Dr. MacMonagle, do you mean to
say that I am a liar?"
"I did not call you a liar, sir, but if
you wish to construe my remarks that
way you may do so," Dr. MacMonagle
replied.
Instantly Dr. Potter lunged at Dr.
MacMonagle with his umbrella, and, as
Dr. MacMonagle dodged, the ferule of
the umbrella struck him on the fore
head. They were at once separated,
and Dr. Potter attempted to bite the
arms of the men who interfered and
held him. Dr. Arnold struck at Potter
to help MacMonagle, but was re
strained and did not reach his man.
Another encounter occurred in the
melee between Dr. Potter and Dr. Arn
old, but was not serious.
A motion was made by Dr. Montgom
ery to appoint a committee of three to
at once investigate Dr. Potter's assault
and report to the society before the end
of the present session. Dr. MacMon
agle opposed the motion, saying that he
would personally attend to Dr. Patter,
but the resolution was carried. The
committee, composed of Drs. Pedlar,
Robertson and Brainard, received the
testimony of Dr. Potter and his friends.
Dr. Kerr was elected president by one
vote, forty-eight ballots being cast for
Kerr and forty-seven for McNutt. Dr.
Hodghead of San Francisco was. elected
secretary over Dr. Cheney, the incum
bent, by a majority of two votes. Dr.
Pedlar was elected first vice-president
and Dr. Cole of Los Angeles second
vice-president. Drs. Williamson, Wads
worth, Carpenter, Barbat, Kelly, Fris
bie and Dodge were elected as the
Board of State Medical Examiners,
with Drs. Woodward, Philip M. Jones
and Howard as alternates.
In the evening the society was ten
dered a banquet by the San Joaquin
Valley Medical Society, and an exceed
ingly pleasant evening was enjoyed
with these gentleman as hosts. Dr.
MacMonagle responded to the toast
"After the War." He said he was "still

aged."

usually returned early next morning.
Last night for the first time two cruis
ers were assigned instead of one. This
morning the Marblehead returned as
usual, but not the Cincinnati, which
had not been sighted up to nightfall.
Inquiry developed the fact that a
message was signaled to her from the
ilagship early this morning. Its import
has not been ascertained on shore, but
the answer was waved back, "Still nine
miles out. Will follow orders." What
these orders were are known only to
the commanding officers ;^ the fleet and

most likely sent further out to gain
greater command of the entrance to
these waters from the Cuban side. This
was the first occasion when the guard

LITTLE EAST SIDE PAGANS.
They Gamble and Know Less About
Religion Than Young Pata
gonians.
Magistrate Meade, in the Essex Market
Court yesterday, applied the usual test
to determine the knowledge of youthful
witnesses as to the nature of an oath,
with results which astonished him. He
was called upon to apply the test by
Lawyer Mandelbaum, counsel for Bernard
Raeder, proprietor of a candy store at 77
Lewis street, who -was arraigned on the
charge of maintaining a gambling resort
in the rear of the candy store. Agents
Agnew and Moore of the Gerry Society
raided the store late on Friday night and
found eight boys sitting around two
tables playing casino. There was
a pile of pennies in the center of the
tables and packages of chewing gum and
candy in front of the boys. The boys
explained at the time that thf-y were
playing a three-cent game and that two
cents went into the â¢â¢kitty" at the con
clusion of the game. The "kitty," they
declared, went to Raeder. The Gerry
agents arrested Raeder and the boy cujU
players. The ages of the boys ranged
from 10 to 14 years.
When the case was called in the Police
Court yesterday Agents Moore and Ag-
I new declared that they had witnessed no
' playing, but ottered the boys as witnesses
' against Raeder. The first boy called be
â  gan to explain tne alleged gambling. Mr.
I Mandelbaum sMd: "I object. This boy
does not know .he nature of an oath."
"We will see," said Magistrate Meade.
i "Little boy," said the magistrate, "where
do had boys go when they die."
"They go to heaven," answered the
boy.

tinuea the magistrate,
'â¢^es sir, it Is a book," replied the boy.

"Do you know what an oath is. asked
the magistrate when the next boy was
called.
"Yes, sir. It's where somebody asks you
to go to court when dey Is arrested to
swear against de cops.
"Little boy," continued the magistrate,
"let me ask you the first question in cate
chism. Who miulfi y v?"
"Ah, say, what you given me," replied
the boy.
"I cannot accept this evidence," naid
the magistrate. "It would not hold

SAN BERNARDINO, April 20.â The
Santa Fe overland No. 1 westbound
was held up at the Mojave River
bridge, two miles west of Oro Grande,
this county, at 2:40 o'clock this morn
ing. Engineer Gifford was killed by
Express Messenger Mott, stepping in
front of one of the robbers just as
Mott fired. The outlaw was mortally
wounded by the same charge.
The hold-up occurred at a sharp
curve, with a high cut on one side and
an embankment on the other, ending in
Mojave River. The train slackens its
speed to about ten miles an hour over
this stretch. The overland reached Oro
Grande on time. There the two rob
bers must have boarded the mailcar
steps, and when the train reached the
curve they climbed over the tender.
In the cab were Engineer A. C. Gif
ford, Fireman C. H. Hicks and C. F.
Clark of Barstow. A tapping on the
tender attracted their attention. Look
ing around, they saw the muzzles of
two guns held by masked men. They
were ordered to stop the train. Then
the robber, who is now known to be
Tolbert Jones of Oro Grande, march
ed the fireman and Clark back to un
couple the express and mail cars.
While they were thus engaged A. C.
Mott, the express messenger, looked
out and was shot at.
The train bein<r on a curve, it was
impossible to uncouple the baggage
car. The mailcar, which was on the
straightest track, was taken to a spur
some distance ahead by .the two rob
bers and the engineer. After it had
been ransacked the robbers came back
on the light engine for another try at
the express car, but in the darkness
â¢ hit the train heavily, jamming the
â¢. couplings.
While the robbers were away with
! the mailcar the messenger came out,
â¢ and, with Clark, took up a position on
I the steps at the rear of the express car.
I The robbers, unable to couple the car,
; ordered the engineer down to help
j them. When he was between the en
! gine and the car Mott drew a bead on
i one of the robbers, but as he pulled the
! trigger Gifford stepped out, receiving
i the charge in the head and breast, dy
! ing instantly. The outlaw was wound
' ed in the neck and chest and rolled
I over the embankment.
Clark then crawled up to reconnoiter,
i and, finding the other robber had fieri,
!he went between the engine and the
I car and found Gifford. About twenty
! feet down the bank was the wounded
! bandit, unconscious. In his hand was
i a bloody mask, and in one of his coat
j pockets were found six sticks of dyna
! mite, with fuse and caps. His first
! question on gaining consciousness was:
"Why did they shoot me? I was only
hunting stray cattle."
Conductor Platner. at the first inkling
of the hold-up, had stolen back to Oro
Grande, and about the time the outlaw
! recovered consciousness Platner arrived
; with a Constable and four men. The
; body of Gifford and the wounded robber
i were put into the baggage car and the
I train ran to Victor. While at Oro
i Grande the conductor telegraphed to
this city and a special was sent out at
; 5:10 with a Sheriff and posse aboard.
: Engineer Morgan of Victor took ("rif
ford's place, and the overland arrived
| here a little over an hour late.
Jones was left at Victor for medical
assistance. There he was recognized as
an Oro Grande butcher and an old resi
dent. He is very well known, but has
borne an unsavory reputation and been
regarded as a cattle thief.
During the forenoon another special
was dispatched with District Attorney
Daley, Assistant Sprecher, Stenogra
pher Benjamin, Deputy Sheriffs Wha
ley and Heap, United States Deputy
Marshal Pourade, Special Santa Fe De
tective King and Sheriff Johnson of
Riverside, with bloodhounds.
To-night at 9:15 the special train ar
rived from Victor with District Attor
ney Daley and party, who brought the
wounded robber. Jones was shot in the
neck and chest, the charge ranging
downward into the pleural cavity. It is
supposed his backbone was injured as
he is paralyzed from the chest down.
When told of the evidence against him
he claimed he was out hunting horses.
He saw the engine standing and went
up to see what was wrong. Just thtn
he received a load of buckshot. He
says that if a mask and dynamite were
found on him some one put them there.
Sheriff Johnson with his bloodhounds
also returned, a high sand storm hav
ing destroyed the scent.
Coroner Keating met the overland on
its arrival here, and with a jury viewed
the remains of Gifford, and then per
mitted the body to be taken to his home
in Los Angeles. The inquest will be
held to-morrow.
Gifford was well educated and well
to do. He was insured for about $5000
and was a member of the Masonic and
Knights of Pythias lodges. His widow
resides in Los Angeles. The run which
cost his life was not his regular run,
he having taken the place of an en
gineer whose locomotive needed minor
repairs.
Express Messenger Albert Clarke
Mott, who saved the company many
thousands, is a Colton boy about 29
years old and runs between Los An
geles and Albuquerque. He formerly
was assistant to W. S. Bullis of Wells-
Fargo, now general auditor for this
section. He is grief-stricken over Gif
ford's death. Both he and Clark de
clare Gifford was out of sight when
the gun was aimed, and no blame is
attached to Mott.
R. E. Bledsoe, a local attorney, was
on the train and his face was bruised

BARELY ESCAPES

BY ARGONAUTS.
The Promoter of a F^Ke Mining
Scheme Brought iQ IroQS
to Victoria.
VICTORIA, April 20â On board the steamship Tees, which arrived
from the north this evening, was a prisoner in irons. He was William
T. Grider, the Californian, who left here about the beginning of March
with fifty men, most of them well-to-do Stocktonians, who each paid
him $75 in consideration for his leading them to rich gold fields on Na
tion River, in the Omenica country, where, according to his circular,
sent out before the organization of the expedition, they could make
at least $100 a day.
Grider claimed to have been all through this country, but subse
quent events proved that he had never been north, having obtained all
his information from fining Recorder Wells of Hazelton and other
northern mining men and from Professor Dawson's report of the coun
try, made ten years ago. A portion of his circular is taken from this
word for word.
When the party left Victoria it proceeded north on the Boscowitz
to the Naas, and all went well until on arriving at the headwaters of
the inlet it found the trail impassable. The men then began to mur
mur and a miners' meeting was cabled to discuss ways and means. They
sent Mrs. Grider back to Port Simpson with most of the supplies and
went in light.
Arriving at Aiyansh they found the trail all but impracticable and
another meeting was held. Many of the party made threats of violence
against Grider, and if it had not been for the intervention of the
calmer members he would have been maltreated, if not killed. From
there until the time of the arrival at Hazelton the murmurings and
clamoring of the party against its leader increased in violence, and
on arriving there they took him prisoner and according to the miners
whom came down on the Tees it intended to lynch him. The authori
ties interfered, however, and a special constable was sworn in to bring
Grider to Victoria. He is now in jail awaiting trial on charges of ob
taining money under false pretenses and perjury, preferred against
him by members of his party.
Eleven of the party came down on the Tees. Most of the others
axe stranded at Port Simpson and Hazelton.
Grider, when asked if he would make a statement to The Call,
said he was satisfied that his character would be vindicated in the
end.

Smooth-Bore Guns Into
Service.
WASHINGTON, April 20.â The Board
of Naval Bureau chiefs Is considering
the advisability of utilizing some of
the old converted smooth-bore guns
for the auxiliary cruisers. Working
day and night and using up the raw
material for the manufacture of guns
as rapidly as it can be produced, the
naval ordnance bÂ»reau is unable to
minr.lv the enormous demand now
made upon it for guns of medium
caliber This is the case, notwith
standing the fact that almost all avail
able ordnance of this character In for
eign markets has been purchased. A
laree part of the guns that have been
, pt ar) art for the auxiliary navy have
"been absorbed by the recently pur
chased Morgan line vessels, and it is
the intention of the board to supply
deficiencies. _

Frontier.
AUSTIN. Tex., April 20.â Adjutant-
General Mabr- y this evening ordered
the ranger forces to concentrate on the
southern and western frontier for the
curDOse of repelling attacks from Mexi
can outlaws, fear of which is justified
by reports from that end of the State.
Captain McDonald's company will go
to Valentine, and Captain Hughes will
take his men to Langtry, while the
companies commanded by Captains
Rogers and Brooks will remain at
Alicia and Cotilla. Orders were also
issued for the immediate recruiting of
each company to double the present
strength.

Americans in Paris Serene.
LONDON, April 21.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Daily News says: The
war is the invariable topic everywhere,
but there is a strange absence of ex
citement in the American colony, which
is quite serene as to the issue, and does
not expect a protracted conflict. From
conversations with a naval expert, an
American authority who has just come
here from Spain, I learn it is expected
that the Spanish fleet will concentrate
at Cape Verde and steam on full force
across the Atlantic.

ABUSING AN EDUCATION.
The Neglect of Self-Culture Is a
Ruinous Wastefulness of
Advantages.
In a thoughtful paper on "A Waste
of Education," in the March Woman's
Home Companion, Brand Bunner Hud
dleston speaks of the tendency of wo
men to permit their talents to rust out:
"Mental culture may be the most
costly or the most valuable gift of par
ents to their children, just as they care i
of it after they get it. It is certain that j
few would equally neglect a material |
property of like monetary cost as they |
often do their educations. This, too,
when money is the very shortest tape
line by which a mental gift may be
measured. Perhaps it is due in part to
the mistaken idea that when we have
quitted the schoolroom we carry with !
us a stationary fund of knowledge that i
will or ought to be sufficient for our j
future. Â» * *
"Look at the piles of hard dollars and
the illimitable hours of time spent ev
ery year in the study and practice of
music alone; except for the good they |
are to teachers and to the makers of i
musical instruments, the half might as !
well be wiped out of existence at one
clean sweep. A decent little eternity !
might be made out of the time. And
thifl continues to exist and repeat it- I
self generation after generation in the i
very face of the fact that music is an |
incomparable addition to home life, and ,
on that account, if for no more lofty |
or selfish reason, ought to be perfected |
and never neglected by women.
"How many of your women friends j
will undertake to entertain even the j
family circle with a creditable per
formance? Usually their pianos stand
idle from the period immediately suc
ceeding their marriage until there are
daughters old enough to be put at les
sons; then the old folly will be re
peated. What folly? Not the plac
ing of children to study music or any
other accomplishment that is for their
good or that the purse will permit.
Let them have all the advantages
within reach, but also teach them ap
preciation; the folly consists in foster
ing through example, and by a tacit
acceptance of the existing state of
things, the idea that it can be other
than a sinful waste of time to acquire
a good thing and then neglect it. No
one has any business to learn a thing
that is not worth remembering. It is
foolish from a merely utilitarian point
of view. Thus it may not be possible
or desirable for every mother to teach
her own children, though some count
it a sweet privilege to do so, yet it
pays them to keeo thoroughly posted,
if only to judge of the quality of work
being done by the teacher, and to sup
ply that home co-oneration which is
so needful to the conscientious student
and the teacher."

MARTIAL LAW
AT SHEEP CAMP
Colonel Anderson Takes
Action to Preserve
The Peace.
Packers Tramp Over Bodies of
Victims of the Dyea
Avalanche.
News of a Double Murder Brought
From Fort Wrangel by tho
Del^Norta.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 20.â The steamer
Humboldt arrived in port to-day from
Skaguay, having left there on Friday
last. The most interesting information j
brought down is that on March 14 a j
declaration of martial law at Sheep
Camp was made by Colonel Anderson,
U. S. A., commanding the District of
Lynn Canal. This action was an after
math of the Chilcoot horror of April 3.
During the days immediately following j
Colonel Anderson saw enough to satisfy I
him that martial law was the only way
to hold the mob of eager Klondikers in
check.
Several of the scenes following the
disaster were disgraceful. For two
days after the slide the packers kept
off the trail, but they soon began to get
uneasy and started in to pack, con
trary to the orders of the citizens'
committee. This seriously interfered
with the work of the army of rescu- '.
ers, who were digging into the pile of j
snow to recover the buried bodies. A j
collision between the triends of the j
dead men and the packers, who per
sisted in pushing their way through, j
was narrowly averted. Threats of
lynching were freely made, but wiser
counsel prevailed. Fake embalmers ap
peared on the scene, and when their
designs had been exposed the excite
ment ran high.
Gambling at Sheep Camp has been
continually on the increase and sure
thing men are beginning to get in their
work.
These are among the reasons that i
caused Colonel Anderson to declare i
martial law. On the day that this or- :
der was issued a detachment of thirty
men was sent forward from the Dyea
military camp. They assumed control
and all" was quiet when the Humboldt
left. The order has the support o-f the
better classes.
The latest arrivals from Walsh and
Lake Creek districts are L. A. Davies
! and R. R. Reed. They left the former
I stream on April 5 and intend to return
very soon.
They say there are forty-five loca
tions on Lake Creek, which is four
miles long and is staked from the
mouth to the summit. Walsh Creek is
fifty-five miles long, and is staked for
thirty-five miles of that distance. A
good many of the first ones to stake on
the Walsh Creek took up 100-foot
claims only, but since learning that
they are entitled to 250 feet, they have
now been given the right to go up
stream\and stake 150 feet more. Mr.
Reed says that he believes that the ice
will be out of the river about April 25.
During the recent heavy weather
Peter Anderson, a boatman, was
j drowned while attempting to bring a
! passenger from Dyea to Skaguay. The
boat was upset and both men swam
around for a time, until Anderson final
ly went down. The passenger, who was
I a commercial traveler, caught hold of
the upturned boat and clung to it until
it floated ashore.
The bark Mercury still lies on its
beam ends in the water at Skaguay.
Much of her deckload has been taken
off on lighters. Many believe that the
Mercury can never be raised.
On April 14 a small snowslide on the
trail, near the summit of White Pass,
1 demolished the Ford Hotel. No one
was in the building at the time.
The steamer Del Norte, which ar
rived here to-day from Fort Wrangel,
Alaska, brings meager particulars of a
double murder on the Stickeen River.
The names of the murdered men were
Burns and Henrickson of hilliwhack
They were killed by a Swede named
Clow, who has not yet been appre
hended.
Other fatalities reported are the kill
ing of a man by the name of Collins of
Los Angeles, Cal., by the falling of a
tree, and the drowning of a man
named Black of lowa in the big
canyon.
THE GROWTH OF CITY POPULA
TIONS.
The sudden growth of great cities is
the first result of the phenomenon of Im
migration which we have to note. We
think of this as essentially an American
problem. We comfort, ourselves in our
Failures of municipal administration with
! that thought. This is a grievous decep
tion. Most of the European cities have
increased In population more rapidly than
in America. Shaw has emphasized the
' same fact in his brilliant work on "Mv
i nicipal Government in Europe." This is
particularly true of great German urban
centers. Berlin has outgrown our own
metropolis, New York, in less than a
generation, having in twenty-five years
added as many actual new residents as
Chicago, and twice as many as Philadel
phia. Hamburg has gained twice as many
in population since 1575 as Boston; Leipsic
has distanced St. Louis.
The same demographic outburst has oc
curred in the smaller German cities as
well. Cologne has gained the lead over
Cleveland, Buffalo and Plttsburg, al
! though in 1880 it was the smallest of the
i four. Magdeburg has grown faster than
! Providence in the last ten years. Dussel
[ dorf has likewise outgrown St. Paul. Be
i yond the confines of the German empire,
, from Norway to Italy, tiie same is true.
1 Stockholm has doubled its population;
j Copenhagen has increased two and one
! half times; Christianla has trebled its
1 numbers in a generation. Rome has in
! creased from 154.000 in IS6O to 450,000 in 1594.
Vienna, including Its suburbs, has grown
three times over within the same period.
Paris from ISSI to 1891 absorbed four-fifths
of the total increase of population for all
of France within the same period.âPro
fessor Rlpley in Appkton's Popular Scl
! ence Monthly for March.

WAR HEROES
ON PARADE
"Remember the Maine"
the Cry of Veterans
at Nevada City.
Imposing Procession Threads
the Streets of the Moun
tain Town,
Visitors Are Shown Miners at Work
Two Thousand Feet Below '
tho Surface.
Special DisDatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, April 20.â The day
of the great parade In honor of the
Grand Army organizations opened sun
less, but by 10 o'clock the clouds had
broken away and the fear that the
city's magnificent decorations might be
spoiled and the proposed pageant inter
rupted by rain were set at rest. People
began pouring in at an early hour from
surrounding towns, thousands coming
from Grass Valley alone. By 11 o'clock
not less than 6000 people were on tha
streets.
The procession was the most Impos
ing ever seen in this county. Thera
were two bands and the cadet drum
corps. Companies C and I of the Sec
ond Regiment, California Infantry.
commanded by Colonel J. W. Guthrie;
the colonel's staff; 200 Grand Army vet
erans; Hydraulic Parlor, Native Sons
of the Golden West; Nevada City Com
pany, Knights of Sherwood Forest;
volunteer fire department, and 700 chil
dren of the Nevada City public schools
in uniform. A platoon of police headed
the procession.
The line of march included Broad,
Main, Pine, Cottage and Commercial
streets. Every building along these
business and residence thoroughfares
was profusely decorated with red,
white and blue. The old veterans were
the star attraction of the day, and con
tinual cheering greeted them from
start to finish. Each of the school
classes had a patriotic yell and the Na
tive Sons kept up a rattling volley of
Rah, rah. rah! '
Here's to the Maine.
Cuba, Cuba.
Down with Spain.
They yelled this in passing the veter
ans on the countermarch. The old sol
diers took it up and shouted it over
and over with gusto.
This afternoon all available convey
ances in the city and vicinity were
brought into requisition and the city's
guests were taken to the quartz mine^,
where the men and the least timid of
the women were lowered to the boitora
levels, from 1500 to 2000 feet beneath
the surface, and saw the miners ex
tracting quartz. They were shown
through the mills and chlorination
works and saw the whole process of
separating gold from rock and making
it into bars of bullion.
To-night the various encampments
held business sessions in their halls.
They will hold morning and afternoon
sessions to-morrow, and in the even
ing will be entertained at a banquet to
be given at Ar;nory Hall under the di
rection of the local relief corps and Na
tive Daughters. Friday was originally
programmed by the committee of fifty
as Grass Valley day, but as the citizens
of that place have made no arrange
ments to entertain the veterans they
do not contemplate going to Grass Val
ley in a body.
The tight for department command
ership between Veterans Seamans,
Cahen, Stone and Cushing is waxing
warm. Cahen is making aggressive
efforts through his lieutenants to cap
ture the honor, but so far no candidate
appears to have any "cinch" on the
coveted place. To-night all sides admit
that on the first ballot in the morning
Colonel Stone is likely to lead, but his
opponents seem confident he cannot
hold his forces intact later.
Several more delegates arrived on to
day's trains. Among them were J. P.
Meehan, Captain R. P. Thomas and
Phil I. Fisher, of George H. Thomas
Post; Captain F. L. Clarke, quarter
master of the Veterans' Home at Yount
ville, and W. W. Stone, president of the
Lincoln Memorial Association, which is
striving to raise funds to erect a Lin
coln monument at San Francisco. The
association wants $100,000, but after
fourteen months' labor has raised only
51400 through the 25-cent certificate
plan. President Stone says there is a
scheme now formulating by which it is
believed the money will be secured in a
reasonable time. Veterans throughout
the country will be asked for offerings
on next Memorial day and then an ap
peal will be made to wealthy and patri
otic citizens at large to make up the
deficit. A number of liberal donations
have already been promised in the East
under this scheme.
The following were elected by the
Grand Army encampment to-night
members of the Veterans' Home Asso
ciation: Colonel J. C. Currier, re
elected past department commander;
Charles E. Wilson of Thomas Post. San
Francisco, re-elected; William J. Rud
dock, Meade Post; Judge R. F. Craw
ford, Santa Rosa; J. C. Campbell.

The "biggest" and most profitable
gold mine in America is probably El
Ora, 100 miles from the City of Mexico,
seven-eighths of which is owned by J.
B. Haggin and Marcus Daly, the other
fraction being held in London. It pays
a net profit of about $400,000 a month.
According to the Premier of New Zea
land a homing pigeon flev from Victoria
to New Zealand in three days The dis

must have flown without refet at a speed
of about fifteen miles an hour.

OLINTHUS WAS
MUCH THE BEST
Captured, the Schreiber
Stake Handily Ridden
by H. Shields.
Morinel Gave Away Weight
and Won Like a Real
Good One.
The Rubicon Party Made a Cleanup.
Three Favorite?, Met With
Defeat.
While Olinthus may never become as
shining a light on the turf as his illustri
ous brother Diggs, he is about the best of
the two-year-olds traveling around in
these parts. Yesterday the big chestnut
came out first best in a five furlong
scrimmage at lnglesiae, called the Schrel
ber stake, worth $700 to tne winner. It is
termed scrimmaee from the fact that all
sorts of choppy riding was indulged in by
the different jockeys, and with a timid
pilot on his back Olinthus would have
lu>e:; bamboozled out of the prize. Henry
Shields took a chance, and his daring was
rewarded with success. Olinthus ruled a
4 to 6 choice in the betting, and soon
after the start was blocked by Mossbrae
and Obsidian. On entering the stretch
Shields, astride the favorite, saw an open
ing next the rail and started through. He
managed to evade Thorpe on Excursion
after squeezing his way out of an un
pleasant predicament, beating the latter
colt finally by over a length in 1:02%, and
this with 123 pounds on his back. Ob
sidian ran better than usual, finishing
third.
Favorites performed indifferently
throughout the afternoon, three going
down to defeat, about the average num
ber these days. The attendance showed
an Increase, and the betting was ex
tremely good.
Although conceding all kinds of weight
to every one of the other entries in the
mile selling affair, ..lorinel was a big fa
vorite- in the betting and showed what a
really good filly she was by running
around h<-r field "when the bend for home
was reached, and leading Thelma out
with something to spare, tilting the dis
tance off in 1:41 flat. San Marco, second
choice, was third.
Ed Corrigan"s chestnut colt Major
Hooker looked an "airtight" for the open
ing mile run for maidens, but Clawson's
brilliant piece of buffoonery saw him led
out by the 9 to 1 chance Applejack, with
Charley Macklln up.
The brown colt San Mateo was made
favorite for the six furlong sprint follow
ing, but was headed from the start and
handily beaten hy Miss I.ynah, the 3 to 1 \
second choice. Imp. Mistral finished in
the show.
The mile and a quarter over hurdles
proved a gift ior the favorite. Our (Mi
mate, piloted by Doane. He outfooted !
and outjumpeil his field, winning in a sal
lop from George Palmer.
In the final mile purse run Rubicon was
oil out of the can, and at odds of 16 to 5 I
headed the other three entries from the j
time the barrier was released, finishing
with lots left over two lengths before ..sit- j
nardillo. Won't Dance, the favorite, ran i
like an Invalid, landing in last place, be

Captain Rees. the affable Memphis turf offi
cial, was kept busy all day at the track re
newing old acquaintanceship. The captain is
very popular with all classes of horsemen In
this section of the country, and much repret
was expressed at his absence from the stand
.luring the long meeting about drawing to a
li'isp.
I-.onnle f'laytnn, the crack colored rider, yes
terday signed a contract to ride for E. Corri
gan the coming season.
Many bettors were a trifle shy about placing
their coin on Our Climate with Doane In the
saddle, and the price against Honig's Jumper
went back In the betting. Some years ago
Doane was one of the best known riders In
the Kast and piloted any number of winners
while under contract with Mike Daly. Like
many another rider he overlooked the fact
that sr.me day he would be too heavy to ride
on the flat, and the dollars went as fast as
they came.
Henry Shields was suspended for the balance

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1898.
of the week after his win on Olinthus. While
Henry was endeavoring to get through next
the rail, 'Clawson, on Mossbrae, tried to block
him and he struck the latter with his whip.
To most onlookers the act looked Justifiable.
Now that Captain Rees is again in Califor
nia the {fiends of Jockey Tommy Butler will
endeavor to have that official look with favor
on Tommy'!! reinstatement. The latter was
BUSpe&ded for a ride on one or two veiâ bad
"skates," and when the fact Is taken into
consideration that good riders have put up some
very hazy rides on stake horses, it does look
as though Butler had been severely punished.
A wild plunger on Mtllbrae cut the colt's odds
from GO down to 20 to 1. W. J. Spiers traded
hlB old mare Mzetta with John Mackey for the
colt, and after the race said that pome weeks
ago the son of Midlothian showed him some
very fair work. Lately he seemed to train
off. and in the race run disappointingly.
Hohenlohe Is a very bad sample of a ract.
horse, it apparently being Impossible to get
him in poor enough company to win. Yes
terday he struggled along In fifth place and
at the wir<" moved up a peg.
W. J. Jennings did not think Miss Lynah
good enough to win and she went to the post
at odds of 3 to 1. She was better than for
some time past.
Old Tim Murphy is playing In hard luck
trying to win a purse. He was cut down
and finished last in the second race.
McKenna was questioned about his ride on
Gov. Budd, and told the Judges that he nearly
lost a leg by being slammed up against the
fence on the back stretch.
Bernardino should be sold to some circus, for
he is too useful an animal to be chasing
around on race tracks for cheap $400 purses.
With short training he should be able to turn
somersaults through terra cotta sewer piping,
balance pool tickets on his nose and describe
flip-flaps and pirouettes on the camel's back.
On April 1"). in a six furlong run, he was
beaten, according to the form book, over fifty
six lengths by the winner, Rubicon. On that
occasion his odds receded from 8 to 20 to 1.
In the last nice yesterday, this same horse
was beaten but two and a half lengths by Ru
bicon, the mile being covered in 1:41)4. This is
form.
Before the last event was decided, it was
hinted that Won't Dance had a suspicious leg,
and her showing In the race would Indicate
that the boiler inspectors should examine her
whole underpinning.
Thorpe gave an excellent exhibition of nurs
ing on the back of Imp. Tripping, and If his
nerve and dexterity could be applied In like
direction with billiard balls, the scores of
Pchaefer and Ives would soon be turned
toward the wall.
Tom McGowan pitched a hot one into the
ring when the Rubicon race came along. The
betting was as good as 4H to 1, and several
bank rolls suffered from contraction when the
tickets were cashed.

CONNEMARA WAS SCRATCHED.
The Fast Hound and Prize-Winner
Attacked by a Cat.
The Ingleside and Union Coursing parks
are making very extensive preparations
I for their respective Mayday meetings.
The tempting prizes that are offered to
leashmen should induce the owners of
fast greyhounds in all parts of the State
to enter their charges.
The best-two-in-three championship
stake, which will be run off at Ingleside,
will tost the staying qualities of the com
peting dogs, and especially will this be the
case if the hares are in a running mood.
At the Union Park great interest will
be centered in the race between Conne
mara and For Freedomâ that is in case
Mr. Deane, the owner of the local dog,
shall conclude to enter "Con" for the big
meeting. The leashmen are about di
vided in opinion as to which is the bettor
dog. and that question can be solved only
when the two great fliers meÂ«t in
tho slips.
Unfortunately, Connemara met with an
accident on Monday which may keep him
in his kennel for some days. The grand
dog was taking a little constitutional on
one of the roads leading to the Ocean
Beach, when he was attacked by an in
furiated cat. The feline sank its claws
deep into the flesh of the hound,
but the owner of the dog quickly ap
plied to the wounds such remedies as are
used to offset blood-poisoning, and under
careful treatment the hound is now doing
nicely, although the iniured part had
swollen considerably, causing Mr. Deane
much anxiety. It is hoped, however, that
Connemara will be in condition to give a
good account of himself on Mayday.
Out of the twenty-four courses held last
Saturday at Union Coursing Park The
Call tipped twenty-two winners, and in
the first round of the stake which was
run off on Sunday The Call tipped ten
winners of the twelve courses, and in the
consolation stake it missed only in one
of its selections.
NO INTEREST IN PETE.
The Heavyweight Champion of Mon
tana Finds Very Few Backers
in This City.
Betting on the Mexican Pete and Jeff
ries fight is very slow, and there is very
little hope that It will improve until the
men enter the ring.
The sporting people look upon Pete as
being nice game for the big. heavy hitting
man from Oakland, and although they
offer $10 on Jeffries they cannot find bet
ter than $3 against it in any of the pool
rooms. In the mutuels some money is
being played at Crowley & Raggett's
that Jeffries will put the champion of
Montana to sleep inside of five rounds,
but the wise ones are very liable to go
wrong in their calculations, as Pete is
quite a sprinter and will bother Jeffries
to no small extent In running and duck
ing. H will not surprise many judges of
pugilism to hear that Pete lasted fifteen
ro Â»' lds in front of his big opponent.
The Olympic Club is arranging for a
2 'V- ro ,V- IU , I contest between Jack Daly and
*, ii [/ay/ ayi K ne . but up to date neither of
the lightweights has consented to fight
under its auspices.
"Bull" McCarthy, the Eastern light
weight pugilist, has been matched to fight
Gnfto by the Sacramento Athletic Club.
Thomas Sharkey is expected down

DEMOCRATS SEEK
HARMONY IN VAIN
District Club Nominations Are
the Cause of Numerous
Local Rows.
ThÂ« Police Called In to Avert Hostili
ties in the Thirty- Second
Assembly District.
Last night was the time fixed for the
nomination by each of the recently or
ganized Democratic district clubs of
members for election as delegates to
the general committee. The election is
to occur next Monday, at which time
twenty-five of the nominees of each
club will be selected as delegates.
The proceedings last night demon
strated the fact that all is not harmo
nious in some of the districts, in spite
of the efforts of Major Harney to have
everything done according to pro
gramme. Local factions took ad
vantage of the opportunity to fight for
private grievances, a condition that in
some of the districts led to entangle
ments so grave that no nominations
were made and none are likely to be
made unless the bosses lay a heavy
hand on the combatants.
In the Thirty-second Assembly Dis
trict there was a row that resulted in
a call for the police. Under the pro
tection of two stalwart coppers the
secretary was enabled to reach the
headquarters of the campaign commit
tee with the returns of the meeting. It
appears that one of the disturbing fac
tors was Frank Lester, an astute poli
tician, who assumes the right to direct
the affairs of his district in such mat
ters as require the exercise of that par
ticular brand of political diplomacy
that is his by right of discovery. As
those who are so blind as not to be able
to see and appreciate his merit are set
ting on foot a very vigorous protest it
is not unlikely that he may feel the
heavy hand in the near future. The
way of the aspiring politician is indeed
a hard one.
Factional fights marred the harmony
of the evening's proceedings in the
Forty-first, Forty-seventh, Twenty
eighth and Fortieth Assembly Districts
and it will require the work of several
days to straighten out the local tangles.
As a rule, however, the slate prepared
in advance went through with a rush
that spoke well for the discipline of the
Rainey-Harney followers.
DICK WILLIAMS' TRIAL.
A Witness Swears That He Paid Him
One Hundred Dollars as a Brib?
to Land a Man.
Wong Kow Kirn occupied the stand dur
ing the whole of yesterday In the trial of
Richard S. Williams, ex-interpreter for
the Chinese Bureau, charged with extort
ing money from Chinese immigrants on
the pretense that his assistance was nec
essary in order to obtain for them permis
sion to land In this country. Kirn's testi
mony was that he had paid Williams $100
for landing Wong Ling Choy. Most of
the time was taken up with the cross-ex
amination by Attorney Collins, who, how
ever, failed to make any material breach
in the testimony of the witness.
The trial will be resumed this morning
and will probably consume a week's time.
For the Omaha Exposition.
Somo time ago the Hon. G. B. Brackett,
pomologist of the Department of Agri
culture, Washington, D. C, wrote to J.
A. Filcher, manager of the State Board
of Trade, asking the latter to collect as
large a variety of California fruits as pos
sible for the Omaha? Exposition. This he
wants for the governmental display at
the fair, as distinctive from any State
exhibit. Mr. Fileher went to work and
he has met with more than fair success.
Producers and jobbers from all parts of
the State, have offered him as much of
the finest fruits as he will care to handle.
Mr. Brackett sent out a large quantity
of franked boxes, so that the shipment uf
the fruit would not cost anything, but
the most of the contributors desire to
have their exhibits sent to the fair in the
original packages. The heaviest contrib
utors are from Fresno, Santa Clara and
this city.
Commission Broker's Failure.
The recent chanpes in the prices of ce
reals has caused anhther grain broker to
go to the wall. Aaron A. Adler of 212
Sansomc street was obliged to close his
doors yesterday, but it is believed that
his failure is not very extensive and that
it will involve no one else. Adler has
been doing a commission business, hand
ling grain principally, for the past thirty
years. While not giving any reasons for
his failure he says that he expects to be
all right again before long.
Dr. Bappin Laid at Rest.
The funeral of the late Dr. Gabriel F.
Rappin was held yesterday afternoon
from his residence. 1608 Stockton street,
where he had lived and practiced medi
cine for the past . -rty years. Rev. Oliver
C. -Miller officiated, an., a large number of
friends and acquaintances gathered to
witness the last sad rites. The deceased
was admired for his charitable actions
and kindly dispos..ion.
Grant Held to Answer.
Charles Grant, the gas inspecting burg
lar, was yesterday held to answer by
Judge Low before the Superior Court in
$2000 bonds for stealing a lot of jewelry
from the residence of Mrs. Amelia Heeht.
1201 Van Ness avenue, on March 25. When
he was asked if he had anything to say,
he curtly answered "no."
STOPPED THE
PERFORMANCE
Ferris Hartman the Recipient
of an Ovation at the
Tivoli.
Tommy Leary Spies His Old Com
panion Seated In a
Eox.
For a full five minutes the performance
of "Slnbad" at the Tivoli was Interrupted
by ecstatic applause and cheering on the
part of the audience for a speech by Fer
ris Hartman. Accompanied by George
Bowles, Ferris and his sister occupied the
lower right proscenium box. As soon as
they took their seats the Tivoli company
was in a flutter from Tommy Leary down
to the latest acquisition In the chorus,
and Hartman was the cynosure not only
of the optics of the company, but the
audience as well.
All went smoothly until the sextet, with
murder oozing out of every pore, came to
the front for one of its popular songs.
When Bob Mitchell had finished his verse,
Leary began to use the sotto voce. He
had saluted Ferris on his entrance to the
box, and now advanced a step on this by
calling out: "Hello, Teddy." The audience
I heard it and a gentle hand-clapping set
j in. Swelling and growing each instant,
a wave of applause swept over the house
that made it impossible for Leary to con
tinue his song. Hartman bowed his ac
knowledgments, but the audience was
not satisfied. By a subterfuge, Leary
| obtained comparative quiet and then sang
his song, of which Hartman was the
burden. There was no restraining: the
outburst that followed. After it had
spent its fury Ferris, acceding to the
continued importunities of the audience,
gracefully surrendered. He leaped over
the railing that separates the box from
the stage and was escorted to the center
of the boards by the gentle, guiding hand
of Carrie Roma. This is what Ferris
said:
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am much
moved and I don't want to stop the per
formance. I am enjoying it immensely,
and as you are also, the best thing is to
have it go on."
Then George Lask lost his smile in the
wings, blew his whistle and the perform
ance recommenced, just as Ferris recov
ered his equanimity and his broad facial
ornament.
CORTLAND-AVENUE CLUB.
Estimates Received for the Cutting
of Folsom Street.
Cortland Avenue Improvement Club,
notwithstanding its youth, has accom
plished much for the district which it rep
resents. It started in to get Folsom
street through from Precita avenue to its
junctuion with Cortland avenue to its
this it has made considerable headway.
So far it has succeeded in getting an esti
mate of the expense for the proposed cut
ting. This amount has been figured at
$2S,'JOO. The distance between the two
given points is a quarter of a mile with
a very .steep hill to be cut through.
In addition to this the club will ask
the Supervisors to appropriate sufficient
money out of next year's taxes for a
chemical engine to be located in the
vicinity of the inhabited portion of the
district. This, with a few more electric
lights, will satisfy them for the present.
Funds for the Strike.
Members of the strike committee of the
Allied Printing Trades Council visited the
outside unions which met Ifist night, and
after stating- the case made an appeal for
financial assistance, which met with a
hearty response in every casg. The Press
men and Feeders met last night, and the
reports of the financial secretaries of the
two organizations showed that contribu
tions aggregating $500 had been received
during the week. Both organizations
parsed resolutions to keep up the strike.
The Typothotae has nothing to say other
wise than that it is doing well under the
new regime. The executive committee
meets daily, and reports are freely ex
changed, a system has been inaugurated
whereby the work caji readily be divided
up if necessary, and when one office is
tied up another will have men and ma
terial to spare. The proprietors are thus
enabled to till all orders on time.
Tried to Rob the Grocery.
J. Snowgrass, accompanied by another
man, entered W. White's grocery store
on Eddy street last evening, and after
smashing several glasses attempted to
steal a number of articles from the coun
ter. The clerk caught them in the act
and gave the alarm. Snowgrass and his
accomplice started from the store and
were later overtaken by Officer O'Conner,
Snowgrass being captured, while his pal
escaped. Snowgrass struck the officer two
or three blows before he submitted to ar
rest, but was finally subdued and taken
to the City Prison, where charges of
battery and petit larceny were placed
against him.
Soldier Boys Will Entertain.
An entertainment and ball will be given
in the. Mechanics' Pavilion next Friday
evening by the First Regiment of the Na
tional Guard of California for the benefit
of the new rifle range now in process of
construction at Ingleside. It will consist
principally of a military display, showing
dexterity in erecting a bridge over an
Imaginary river, an attack and repulse, |
the caring for the dead and the treating I
of the wounded. Fancy drills will also be j
given; the facility with which the rapid- i
tiring guns can he brought into action !
will be shown. The programme will con- !
elude with a military ball.
Masons Installed in Office.
At a meeting of the Grand Chapter of I
High Masons held yesterday afternoon in !
the assembly room of the Masonic Tern; I
pie on Post street the newly elected offl- |
cers for the ensuing year were installed by '

Grand Commandery will be held and va
rious subjects introduced and passed !
upon.
The Twentieth Century.

FAILED HER
The Bark Trade Winds
Arrives After a Long
Passage.
Important Decision for Ship
pers in the Case of the
Steamer Sunol.
Ship-Owners Not Responsible if the
Case Is Due to Negligence
of Captain.
The four-masted British bark Trade
Winds arrived yesterday from Liverpool
after a' lengthy passage of 158 days. Cap
tain Ritchie blames contrary and light
â winds for the long run, and says that not
once during the entire passage did he get
a decent sailing breeze. On one occasion
the ship fell iii with some strong west
erly currents and got "back-strapped" off
the Horn. ]t took from December 15 to
Christmas day to -weather the cape, and
ever since then the good ship has been
trying to beat her way up to San Fran-
Thls is Captain Ritchie's first voyage
to San Francisco in twelve years. On the
last occasion be was here as master of
the Four Winds*, and left that vessel to
. superintend the building of the Trade
| Winds, which ship he has commanded
ever since. His wife accompanied him on
this occasion, and says that fche does not
care to make another trip it they are all
to be as lengthy as this one. She has
never made a voyage with her husband
before, but he persuaded her to come
along this time, never thinking that the
run would be a succession <>f light winds
and calms. The Trade Winds has a valu
able cargo "i" merchandise consigned to
J. J Is, Bros. & Co.
An Interesting decision for shippers was
banded down In the United States Dis
trict Court yesterday. In it the Judge
holds that '"if the owner of any vessel
transporting merchandise or property to
or from any port of the United States
shall exercise due diligence to make the
vesael m all respects seaworthy and
properly manned, equipped and supplied
Bsel nor her owner or own
ers, agents or charterers shall become
liable or be IMd responsible for damages
or loss resulting from faults or errors in
navigation or in management of said
\ i B
In March, 1897, the steamer Sunol and
the bark Olympic were in collision. The
I was on her way to Yallejo and the
Olympic was coming in from Xew York.
When off Alcatras the collision occurred,
and the Sunol was sunk. An inquiry fol
lowed, and Captain Dye of the Sunol was
; by the inspector of hulls and
boilers for negligence. Those who had
freight and effects on the vessel sent in
claims to the Piper, Aden, Goodall Com
pany for damages. The company em
ed C. A. Shurtliffe, ex-Uni ted' States
District Attorney, to take the matter into
the courts, in order to establish its lia
bility. Mr. Shurtliffe contended that un
der the Harter act, as above quoted, the
company was not liable for any damages,
and Judge de Haven took that view of
the case also, and gave a decision in favor
of the Piper, Aden, Goodall Company.
Dr. W. D. Deas was yesterday appoint
ed assistant police surgeon at the Harbor
Receiving Hospital by the Board of
H.-alth. At the same time two very hand
eorne medals were- presented to Drs. Deas
and Zabala by Mrs. Schuller, who was
shot by her husband about a month ago
and who was treated at the Harbor Re
pital by the doctors named.
Each medal bears the following Inscrip
tion: "A token of gratitude for skillful
eurgery." At the time Mrs. Schuller was
shot nobody thought she would recover,
but by skillful treatment, care and atten
tion she is now as well as ever. The med
als were given to the Board of Health and
by the chairman turned over to Dr. Hill,
who is at the head of the Harbor Hospi
tal, and that gentleman afterward pre
sented them to Drs. Deas and Zabala.
The British bark Inveramsy way much
mure seriously damaged in the collision
with the schooner James A. GarfiHd than
was at first supposed. Her forward bul
warks on the starboard side are very bad
ly damaged and the forward rigging has
all been torn away so that it will be at
least a week before she will be ready to
eail for Burope, The schooner lost her
bowsprit and all her head gear, and will
have to go on the dry dock for repairs.
Manuel Rodriguez, a ii'sherman, picked up
one of the Inveramsy's boats off Lime
l J olnt yesterday morning and towed it
back to Melggfl wharf. Ho was paid for
his trouble by the owners of the Garfleld.
The t'Rrkentine Jane A. Falkenberg was
put on the dry dock a few days ago in or
der to be stripped. When Captain Perri
the marine surveyor, saw the hull
he said it was a shame to strip it, as it
:â¢â¢< t condition. He strongly ad-
I Lynde & Hough the owners, to
vessel alone, but they decided to
make the barkentine as near perfect as
Ible, so air the sheathing was stripped
nd the hull will be recalked through
nd new nh^athing put on before the
Falkenberg starts for Kotzebue Sound.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda sails for Australian ports this after
noon With about fifty cabin passengers
and a very valuable cargo. Among the
li ngers are Dr, W. I. Terry and bride
â¢ kton. The young couple will spend
their honeymoon in Honolulu.
The wrwk of getting the bark Mermaid
ready for a voyage to the Kotzebue Sound
gold fields is rapidly progressing at the
foot of Howard street. When completed
she will be as comfortable a vessel as will
call for Alaskan waters. Her galley and
dining Baloon aro to be on the main deck
co that passengers who are inclined to be
seasick will not be rendered more uncom
fortable Â»>y the smell of food. She will be
provided with a powerful steam launch
which will have great speed, and as ncr
engine and boilers are very powerful in
proportion to her size she will be as good
; ordinary towboat on the waters of
the Kuhuck River. Tin; Mermaid was for
inorly owned and sailed by Captain Wicks,
present commander, and she is a
Htanch, safe and comfortable craft. She
been Inspected and passed by the ma
rine surveyors and should be a "safe boat
to travel in for those who want to reach
the Kotzebue gold fields.
ThomuH Murphy was arrested by Detec
tive Tnm Kills and Officer Mackey of the
Harbor Police yesterday and charged with
Durgiary. He broke Into a carpenter's
shop m Vallejp and stole a number of val
uable tools, h,. then came to San Fran
cis. o o h the Bteamer Sunol and was ar
rested as soon aa the vessel docked. The
carpenter- tools were found in his swag.
JORDAN SENTENCED.
He Will Spend One Year in the San
Quentin Penitentiary at
Hard Labor.
John W. Jordan was sentenced yester
day by United States District Judge de
Haven to one year's Imprisonment at
hard labor in the penitentiary at San
Quentin. Jordan was porter for the cen
tral rÂ»o.stofnce and was caught by Postal
Inspectors Erwin and Thrall in the act of
abstracting money from letters in the
general delivery department. He con
fer, his guilt, was indicted - byâ the
United States Grand Jury and nlPirt^i

The United States inspectors of local

The meeting of tho California Club,
which was to have been held to-day haa

count of the symphony concert, which
takes place to-day.
CAME IN WITHOUT A TUG.
The four-masted British bark Trade Winds arrived from Liverpool
yesterday after a lengthy passage of 158 days. Captain Ritchie
took advantage of the only favorable breeze he got during the
voyage and sailed into port.
BALL-TOSSERS
ARE PATRIOTIC
California League Men Will
Remember Soldiers'
Families.
They Decide to Donate the Full Pro
coeds or Saturday's Game
to Their Support.
The spirit of patriotism has penetrated
to the heart of the diamond. The man
agement of the California Baseball
League generously deemed yesterday to
contribute to the girls and others the gal
lant troops off to the war left behind
them at the Presidio.
There were present -' the meeting: H.
H. McPike, president; C. E. Wiggin, sec
retary; J. T. Moran, Oakland; L. V.
Merle, San Francisco; Marti Strouse San
Francisco; J. J. Raver, and T. P. Robin
son, Recreation Park Association.
The project of donating the gross re
ceipts of Saturday's game to a patriotic
object was broached ana taken up en
thusiastically. It was stated that many
of the families of the brave boys in bÂ»ue
had been left in a precarious financial
condition, and any assistance such. .as
proposed would be a real benent.
Telegrams were at once dispatched to
Stockton and Oakland, and the replies
from Campbell and Pollard of the former
place and Cal Ewing and Norman of the
latter were fully in accord with the idea.
They, with H. J. Corcoran, agreed to do
nate not only the gate receipts but the
proceeds of the bar and refreshment priv
ileges to the worthy cause.
The game next Saturday is now expect
ed to be a notable one. Recreation Park
has been recently Improved in every way,
and patrons are likely to witness a more
than usually gingery game under the cir
cumstances. The patriotic teams which
will play "without money and without
price" will be inspired to doughty deeds,
and who would not attend a game where
for the ordinary price of admission he or
she can witness a game "for blood" and
at the same time be performing a patri
otic service for the gallant defenders of
the flag?

Was Picking Pockets.
Pickpockets operated among the crowds
that lined the streets during the march
of the regulars to the ferry yesterday. At
Van Ness avenue and Turk street two
young men. H. L. Whipple and J. R.
Herting, noticed a man with his hand in
a lady's pocket. They grabbed him and,
notwithstanding his struggles, held him
till Policemen Hayden and Pyl e appeared,
and he was sent to the City Prison, where
a charge of attempted grand larceny was
bookea against him. He gave the name
of Louis Colli and his occupation as cook.
The lady whose pocket he was robbing
was Miss J. Hamlll, 3678 Seventeenth
street.
The Cooks Paid the Fines.
J. R. Cook, J. S. Cook and W. E. Cook
yeÃterday paid the fines imposed by United
States Circuit Judge Morrow for con
tempt in the matter of the restraining
order issued at the request of the Poke-
Kama Sugar Pine Lumber Company
against the Klamath River Lumber and
Improvement Company. The total fines
ana costs were $1153 50. They are of the
opinion now that it Is an expensive mat

AN OLD BANK BOOK
IN PROBATE COURT
William Schultz's Fortune
Held for German
Heirs.
More Than Twenty Thousand Dol
lars, Long Unclaimed, Is Still
in a Local Bank.
Some of the most pathetic romances
1 that have ever come to light In California
! cluster around the story of old bank ac
j counts, whose owners have been lost in
I the twilight of history.
Another Interesting case has just come
| to light in the matter of the unclaimed es-
I tate of William Schultz, who died in Ger
â¢ many on January 27, 1597. For many
[ years his silence has been a mystery' at
; the German Savings and Loan Society.
Though he had a fortune there no one
could ever find a trace of his where
abouts. Under the law a number of ad
vertisements, requesting the address of
| the depositor or his assigns, were insert
i ed, but no trace of his whereabouts came
i to light until Attorney Oscar T. Shuck
j began to make a thorough search through
', the various archives of the city, where-
I upon he discovered the fact that the de-
I positor had died Intestate and unmarried
in Germany. He has relatives, however,
! who claim the estate.
Attorney Gustav Gutsch of this city has
' charge of the case for the estate, though
1 he has kept in the background and al-
I lowed the Public Administrator to handle
j the case. This officer took out letters on
I October 10, ISftT, but no inventory has yet
! been filed, though it is known that the es
j tate of the man whose heirs are unknown
amounts to at least $20,575, which is in the
German Savings and Loan Society.
This case is another illustration of the
fact that the geographical location of San
! Francisco is such that a number of per
i sons come here, deposit their money and
j leave as suddenly as if the earth had
swallowed them.
POLK STREET'S FUTURE.
The Merchants Looking for Progress
When the Thoroughfare Is
Cut Through.
Daylight has at last been let In through
the hog's back at the northern end of
Polk street. The contractors have worked
with a will to such an extent that before
tho expiration of two months the street
will be so far extended as to permit the
passage of teams through what has been,
since the pioneers first crossed the Rocky
Mountains, an ungainly obstacle to the
progress of that portion of the city and
the opening of the streets running east
and west. It was not until the Polk-street
merchants took hold of the matter that
any steps in the work were taken. Now
that there is a prospect to extend the
street to the waters of the bay the mer
chants feel jubilant that a brighter era is
about to dawn on the commerce of the
dividing line between the older and newer
portions of the city.
The completion of Lombard street from
Van Ness avenue to the Presidio has
piv.-n the northwest a sudden boom, so to
speak. Wheq i'ulk street is eventually
cut through and paved, not only the Pre
sidio but Jiay street will be made acces
sible to the business men for the hauling
of thetr stock to and from the commer
cial center of the downtown portion of
the city.
In addition to this the Polk-street mer
chants will urge the Sutter-street Rail
way Company to extend the transfer
privilege to the Union-street line. This,
they consider, is no more than proper 'ln
view of the fact that the business done
on Polk street goes a long way to sup
port the travel on the Sutter-street and
Pacific avenue linos. To, catch the trade
or, at least a portion of it, from the Pre
sidio and northern section of the city,
they consider that tho Sutter-street Com
pany should do something. Bush street,
with its many drawbacks, has been an
eyesore for a number of years. The
traveling ghost oars have left a kind of
hoodoo behind which will not down. The
double gutter left by the removal of the
rails of the old track still remains as a
reminder of the unhappy period when the
crawling cars made their "one visit a
day" over the road. This street the mer
chants claim should be put in proper con
dition.
OLD AND DESPAIRING.
Frank Sundell, an Upholsterer, Sev-
enty-Three Years Old, Could
Not Wait for Death.
Frank Sundell shot himself through the
head shortly before noon yesterday, be
cause he was old and poor and sick, and
his body now lies on a slab in the Morgue.
He was 73 years old and lived back of his
little uphoisterer's shop at 1204 Pacific
street.
Tho deceased left a note addressed to
Herman Wrede. and reading as follows:
"Please forgive me for causing you
some trouble, but I can't stand this any
longer. So good-by to you all.
"FRANK SUNDELL."
Imitating a Trademark.
A final decree was entered yesterday by
T r nited States Circuit Judge Morrow in
favor of the complainants in the suit of J.
R. M. Hennessy against Felix Coblentz,
Coblentz being perpetually enjoined by
the court from imitating the bottles or
labels of Hennessy brandy. The defen
dant's attorneys consented to this dispo
sition of the case and Coblentz paid the
costs.

United States Army.
WILLIAM R. SHAFTER,
Brigadier-General U. S. Army.
General Orders No. 5.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT
OF CALIFORNIA.
San Francisco, Cal., April 20, 1898.
By direction of the President, the
undersigned hereby assumes tempo
rary command of the Department of
California.
H. C. MERRIAM,
Brigadier-General U. S. Army.
General Merriam now commands the
Department of the Columbia and Cali
fornia. Owing to important official busi
ness that requires hia presence in the
Department of the Columbia General
Merriam will shortly return to his sta
tion at Vancouver Barracks, Washing
ton.
Speaking of his probable sojourn in this
city General Memam said to a Call re
porter yesterday: "I shall remain here
a week to study the situation in this
i harbor and become familiar with the
! posts of this station. The departments of
I the Columbia and California are not con
| solldated, but there are two commands
i under one head. I will return to Van-
I couver next week unleÂ«s orders direc^ me
to establish headquarters elsewhere."
Major Thomas H. Barry, adjutant-gen
eral Department of Columbia, who ac
companied General Merriam from Van
couver Barrack 3, Wash., to San Fran
cisco, is well known in this city, having
served a tour of duty at the harbor
! posts He is better known to the officers
i of the First Infantry, in which regiment
! he served as second and lirst lieutenant
! and captain from August 31, ISSO. to Janu
ary W W97. when he was appointed
I major in the adjutant-general's de
. partment. Major Barry was captain
of Company A of the First Infantry, and
yesterday, while the boat was transport
ing the First to Oakland, every man of
Company A shook hands with their for
mer company commander. One thing was
especially nottceJâ that he not only rec
ognized "the men but remembered their
During Governor Markham's adminis
tration. Major Barry, who was then cap
tain First U. B. Infantry, served a term
as inspector and instructor of the Na
tional Guard of California. He was with
the troops In camp and visited every regi
mental and company armory in the State.
No one is better posted than Major Barry,
concerning the good points and defects
of the National Guard of this State^ He
knows the individual worth of the officers
of the organization from a military point
of view. He made to the Secretary of
War a breezy, accurate and concise re
port regarding the guard and its officers.
The document called forth a protest from
Governor Markham, but Major Barry
maintained his ground in good style.
General William R. Shatter, accom
panied by his aid. Lieutenant Robert H.
Noble "First Infantry; Stenographer
Bronson L. McClcllan and Messenger

Colonel Moore and Colonel Eagaa have

Troops C and X, Fourth Cavalry, Pre

C. Benson and George H. G. Gale, which
were detailed not long since to patrol the
Yosemite, Sequoia and General Grant
National Parks, are still at that post. All
the pack mules and aparejos that were to
have been used by the troops in the parks
have been shipped to New Orleans. It is
stated on good authority that if war is
declared the four troops of the Fourth
Cavalry, now stationed at the Presidio,
will be ordered to the front, and their
places filled by militia cavalry. The
special duties heretofore performed by the
infantry troops is now being performed
by the cavalry.
Collector Jackson was officially noti
fied yesterday that the revenue cutter
Rush had been taken by the Navy De
partment for use as an auxiliary
cruiser. The cutter went up to Mare
Island last evening for the necessary
alterations.
Colonel James F. Smith, First In
fantry, National Guard of California,
has issued regimental orders No. 4
directing the regiment to parade on
Friday, April 22, IS9B. The field, staff,
band and First and Second battalions
and cadet company will assemble at 8
p. m. at the regimental armory. The
Third Battalion will report at the Polk
street entrance of the Mechanic.*' Pa
vilion at 8:20 p. m.
Some of the officers of the First Regi
ment, National Guard of California, are
thoroughly satisfied that their regiment
will be the one to g-o to the front upon
the call of the President for volunteers.
In view of this possibility the military
entertainment to be given by the local
soldiers to-morrow night in Mechanics'
Pavilion may turn out to be more of a
farewell party than a reception.
But whether the troops remain or go
to war there will be no lack of interest
in the exhibition. Several weeks have
been spent in perfecting the men in the
various special features to be presented
and they are very much in earnest that
the public should understand the effi
ciency of the guard. This will be fully
demonstrated by the one thousand men
who will appear upon the floor in a
body.
The committee in charge last night
appointed all the sergeants as a floor
committee for the bail which is to fol
low the military display. Leader Cas
sasa o fthe First Regiment band was
also instructed to furnish some new
military airs and intersperse some
lively patriotic selections as well.
Troop A. cavalry. Captain Burnett,
has decided to participate and some
very interesting and instructive ma
neuvers are promised.
CONTEMPT OF COURT.
Judge Joa-ihimsen Fines His Prose
cuting Attorney Fifty Dollars.
Judge Joachimsen and nis prosecuting
attorney, Thomas F. Graham, had a mis
understanding yesterday morning which
resulted In Graham being fined $50 for
contempt of court.
Louis Metter, a carpenter in the Mission,
was tried on a charge of battery upon
Robert Downs, Sunday night. Metter is
a big, powerful man and Downs is a slim
built boy. From the evidence of Downs
and a companion. Joseph O'Brien, a boy
wearing glasses. It appeared that as they
were going home they met Metter and
they had some words. O'Brien. In a
spirit of fun, made a pretense to take
off his coat, when Metter hit him with a
cane and knocked him down. Then he
struck Downs across the face with the
cane.
Metter's story was that the two boys
were following him around, and one of
them assumed a threatening attitude.
Thinking that they were going to strike
him, he used the cane. Metter called B.
Solomon, stenographer in Judge Wallace's
court, who testified to Metter'a good
character.
Th* Judge remarked that citizens should
be protected against young hoodlums, and
accordingly dismissed the case.
"It's an outrage on justice," said Gra
ham. "A big man like that striking two
boys with a cane. These boys are not
hoodlums."
"For those words I will fine you $50,"
retorted the Judge.
Nothing more was said, but after court
adjourned Graham apologized to the
Judge, who, however, said that the apol
ogy would have to be made in open court
in the morning.
WANT IMPROVEMENTS.
South of the Mission Parks and
Streets Demand Consideration.
South of the Mission; which Is repre
sented by a league of improvement clubs,
has for its object the betterment of the
sections known as Precita Valley, Lick-
Wilmerdlng, Cortland avenue and Mis
sion and Potrero avenue.
The district embodied in these sections
has of late made its presence felt by ap
pearing before the Board of Supervisors
and asking for appropriations out of the
next year's tax levy for the improvement
of the streets running through that por
tion of the city. A claim is also set up
for sufficient funds to put the several
public parks that are dotted down on the
official map in condition suitable for park
purposes. Franklin square, Jackson Park
and Bernal Park are to-day in the same
condition as they were fifty years ago,
while it is claimed by the delegates to
the league that every square and park
in the northern and western portion of
the city has been Improved at the public
expense. This neglect on the part of the
Supervisors (not the present board In
particular) is looked upon as being the
reverse of fair toward the Mission tax-
payers.
The property owners, through their
representatives In the league, on the
slope of the Southern Heights, where the
Lick and 'Wilmerding schools have sites,
are loud In their complaints apralnst the
unhealthy condition of the low lying
swamps between Channel, Sixteenth,
Kansas and the San Bruno road. This
section was visited by the Mayor and
some of the Supervisors a few days
since. There was no difference of opin
ion as to the necessity of having some
thing done with the swamps and also
with the street grades, particularly that
of Utah, between Nineteenth and Twen
tieth, where the difference is all the way
from nineteen to twenty feet below the
grade.
The usual cry for lights accompanies
all othor complaints from every section
of the south of the Mission district clear
to the waters of the bay.
The Passion Play.
"The Passion Play," reproduced from
the original as it is presented at Ober
ammcrgau, opened its second week at
Y. M. C. A. Hall on Monday. The play
is a series of pictures of the scenes of
the great play, reproduced in a wonder
fully lifelike manner and with all the
suppressed action of a tableau of living:
figures. It will run every afternoon and
evening during the week, Sunday ex
cepted.

A prominent vocal instructor, living in one of the prosperous cities of
Connecticut, . relates a curious experience: "In learning," she Bays, "to
properly place and sustain the tone, pupils sometimes feel a faintness and diz-
ziness arising from the peculiar action of the diaphragm and the effort of con-
trolling of the breath. I have known a girl to actually have to sit down for
fear of fainting. I became convinced that the difficulty came from a weak
. stomach and â >, talked with my physician about it. He was inclined to think
that I had the right solution of the trouble. Some time after that I, from
time to time, gave a Rtpans Tabule, to a pupil, suggesting that it be taken
before coming to the next lesson. The effect was precisely what I had hoped.
The pupils were relieved of the difficulty and able to take "the full half hour of
vocal exercise without any of : the old trouble. It seems a queer use to __*_â¢

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
eure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of.
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is tm
frobable. With a "high" In the vicinity of

In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions 'Will produce an

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 20.â New York stock .
market offered a firm resistance all flay to the
depression which was reflected upon It from '
everj" other exchange in the world. Its declines
at no time reaching more than a fraction over a
point for active stocks. In the final hour, after i
trading on the foreign bourses had boon sus
pended for the day, a lively movement to buy
developed on the New York Exchange, which
â wiped out practically all the earlier losses and
lifted the level of prices sharply above that of
last night. The final recovery was brought
about by the dissemination of a rumor that the
period allowed Spain for a reply to the ultima
tum had been extended to Monday, with a
chance of a settlement being effected before
that time. There were some evidences of ma- |
nipulation for the purpose of making last prices
Bhow striking gains. For Instance, Burlington
pold at 90=^. and on the last sale Jumped to
81%. A broad view of the financial world
phows that New York was less affected by the
crisis than any other financial center. At no
time were prices depressed to the London par
ity. Ah a consequence there was large arbi- j
trage selling here of International stocks. New I
York prices showing a fair profit over London
quotations. The depression in London and on
Continental bourses was more due to the panic
In Spanish fours than to any other one cause.
These securities fell l*i In London and 3*4 In
Paris on forced liquidation, due to- financial
difficulties In France and Spain. Whatever de
pression there was on the New York Exchange
peemed to be due to sympathy with the de
pression in foreign markets. New York ab
sorbed the offerings of Its own securities for '
foreign account at prices above those prevail
ing abroad, and there was no heavy liquida
tion for local account. It Is to be observed i
that American securities have held fairly !
steady as compared with the marked weakness
of Spanish securities. It Is also to be observed
that weakness In foreign markets is due In
part to the dearness of money, and | this In
turn Ie caused by pressure for gold to reinforce
the American money market. The United states
Is still a heavy creditor to, the world, and the
continued withdrawing of â¢ these credits, while
errvlng to fortify the financial fabric at home,
Is a factor In the weakness of foreign mar
kets. Doubtless a part of the selling In New
York for foreign account Is due to an' effort to
equalize exchange conditions. That these of- â 
ferings should be so well absorbed Js a demon
stration of the sound financial conditions exist
ing In this country. Evidence to the same ef- !
feet Is given In the case of call money, which
loaned to-day at 2 per cent, although time
money continues to be firmly held at 6 per cent.
It is still further significant of the same condi
tion that the stringency of money nbrond
should have resulted In declines In the Brltlsn
and French Government bonds, while 7jiitÂ»..i
States fours of 1923 showed -a gain to-day Of Il*.*I I *.*
per cent for the registered and I<4 per c*--rx for

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 20.â Tne Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The feature
in the stock markets here to-day was the flat
ness In. foreign stocks, the Paris Bourse being
utterly demoralized by the continued fall in
Spanish 4's, which closed at the lowest, 34.
The weakness In consols caused the notion of
a rise of Bank of England rate to-morrow, and
in this belief discount houses drained to work
and all such business was done at the bank
Itself, which had the effect of making loan
rates easier. .'*. V
Americans were almost unsalable, but there
was no great pressure to sell, and a bear posi
tion, at least in St. Paul and Louisville, now
undoubtedly exists. The manner in which New
York absorbs the stocks is much marveled at.
The markets here are now thoroughly close
reefed and rrepared for war, but the Paris
Bourse will feel the blow .severely. As In
stancing how the market here is now looking
ahead. It Is common talk that war means the
final deleat of the sliver party in the United
States.
Arcentines were fiat. Uneasiness was felt
by some over a telegram received by some
large banks and firms associated with Argen
tina from General R.-wiuoa, urging the impor
tance of their Joining in subscriptions to the
"internal" loan which was announced in these
dispatches on Monday last. The telegram ad
vocating this loan says that it is required for
urgent Indispensable expenses, and "which
will form the best guarantee of peace."
The Paris Bourse is bordertnz on a panic,
and heavy realizations on tlntos and every
thing salable.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 20.-The Liverpool market
surprised the trade at the start to-day by
showing an advance of nearly 2c per bushel In !
wheat. The war news from Washington gave !
shorts a further scare, and first trades In July j
here were made at BSM.<3SS%c. an advance of j
I%@lHc. September was also remarkably !
strong. Profit-taking caused a brief reaction
during which July touched 88% c, but the
market acraln stiffened and rose steadily to
i 89% c. Heavy selling against calls" stopped
the advance and the market quieted down.
â  The announcement of the actual signing of the
I Cuban resolutions did not affect the course of
I prices, quotations remaining about stationary
, for nome time. The strength of the English
' markets continued to be the chief influence
; Letter reported free acceptances of cable offers
One carco was sold to London at Jl 26 per
bushel, an advance of 6c over yesterday's
â  prices. Domestic crop news of a reassuring
; nature and heavy receipts had little effect
| July continued to gain â trsngth after reach-
THE SAIN" FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1898.
Ing 89% c, or 2c above where It closed the
day before. A good deal of long wheat was
sold between that and 89c that rather over
loaded the capacity of the market, and Just
then New York' flung a bomb Into the pit In
the shape of a dispatch giving a rumor cur
rent there to the effect that the Rothschilds
had refused to advance more money to Spain
and consequently that Spain would be un
able to go to war. The market had a sudden
collapse of lc a bushel on that, running down
i In ten minutes from 89% cto SS%c. and then
I after a short fight around the latter figures It
I had a fresh tumble to 87%@87%c. and was
: bringing S7%c at the close. May sold between
â  $1 10-iil 11. closing at $1 10%.
Corn was helped by export sales of over a
: million bushels. ! Shorts bought freely, but th?
: collapse In wheat depressed corn and most of
the advance was lost. July closed a shade
higher than yesterday.
Oats were firm early on the advances abroad
and In sympathy with wheat. The advance
was lost near the close. July closed He lower.
Provisions were strong throughout on war
prospects. The trade was largely professional,
although some outside buying was noted. Pro
fessional shorts were liberal buyers, and pack
ers gave up their attempts to check, the rise.
July pork closed with a net gain of 62% c.
July lard and ribs gained 12% c each.

Harrison's circular says: "Since the Moana
lett, the following vessels have arrived from
Australia, viz.: Drummulr, 2794 tons; Domin
ion, 1945 tons; Undaunted, 2312 tons; Socotra,
2608 tons; Snow and Burgess. 2201 tons; total.
11,910 tons. As the total arrival of coal here
from the Colonies since February 22 only foot
up 16,192 tons, the stocks here in yard are al
most nil, still it is known that within the
next six weeks there are 14 cargoes fully due,
with over 31.000 tons which will amply supply
all our immediate demands. The engaged list
for Sydney and Newcastle loading, numbers
68 vessels with a carrying capacity of over
150,000 tons for delivery here: some of these
vessels will not arrive for six months. The
asking coal freights from Newcastle have been
marked up to lGs 8d; several engagements were
recently made at lCs per ton. As the demand
for steamers and sailers for the Alaska trade
Is slackening off. it Is very probable that a
number of these will drift back into the coast
coal trade, so that the anticipated scarcity of
coal tonnage later on will not be realized.
"There is no perceptible change of values
for a month past, as the requirements of the
market are fully supplied from Washington
and British Columbia, and freight rates from
there have returned to their normal condition.
The strike at ' Swansea still continues, hence
shipments from there have come to a stand
still." . â¢ * .

Sick and Desperate He Stole
a Camera From a
Store.
Governor Budd May Intervene
While Sentence Is De
ferred.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.''.roadway. April 20.
Mrs. A. J. Luckhardt, whose name
would certainly be more appropri&lÃ were
the syllables transposed, appeared before
Judge Ellsworth this morning and made
a pathetic plea in behalf of her husband,
who has been convicted of burglary.
A. J. Luckhardt Is a sick man. Doctors
declare that the foundation of consump
tion is already laid. A few weeks ago he
left his wife and little ones at home and
went out to try to earn a meal for them.
Work could not be found, but an oppor
tunity to steal presented itself. He no
ticed that the little store of Travers &
Leet was deserted at night and that it
would be an easy matter to break in. He
broke in and stole a camera, which the
testimony showed he sold for bread.
The circumstances were placed before
Travors & Leet, and much influence was
brought to bear on them to prevent a
prosecution, but the case went to trial.
No matter how strong the moral defense
of such a crime, there was no legal way
to escape justice. The court withheld
sentence for two weeks, and when the
case was called this morning a fur
ther stay was pranted, so that the pris
oner's friends could confer with Governor
Budd for the purpose of trying to secure
a pardon.
Mr?. Luekhardt, trembling and with
tear-stained face, made the following
brief statement:
"Our condition is that of extreme pov
erty. There were days* when my husband
i ork, but very many more when
he did not. For months bread and weak

Judge Ellsworth asked the prisoner rf
to make any statement before
J. The sick man said:

far as I am concerned. I have many times
hungry, but it was too much to see
my wife and babies longing for food.
That is all I have to say. I reauze that I
am in the hands of the law and must

Judge Ellsworth hesitated a few mo

"It Is certainly a very painful case." he
"and in many respects a remarkable
one. However, there is a more serious

NEW WORK FOR
GRAND JURORS
A. Case Something Like |
That of Harry
Thomas.
Detective Herbert Is Said to j
Have Influenced a
Witness.
Scandals WJJI Not Occupy Much
Time of the Present
Session.
|
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 20.
The Grand Jury will not meet till Tues
day of next week, and it is thought that
a very few days will complete its labors
for this session.
Some pressure has been brought to bear
on Foreman Crooks to induce him to call
the Grand Jury together earlier, but he
soon convinced himself that the pressure
came from parties more anxious to do
politics than morals, and he declined to
gratify such desires.
As things now Btand, there is prac
tlc&lly nothing definite before the jury-
They' have heard all kinds of startling
rumors and unverified stories about cor
ruption and similar things, but in no in
stance have they been able to get matters
in such shape or to procure evidence di
rect enough to warrant issuing any in
! dictments.
It is probable that subpoenas will be
issued for some of the directors of the
Contra Costa Water Company, but it is
not expected that they frill incriminate
themselves or allow themselves to be
caught in a trap.
There is a possibility that an entirely
new subject will be taken before the
Grand Jury- While testifying at the pre
liminary examination of Stacey Rogers
for shooting Edgar Halsey at Berkeley,
Mr. Hayne, one of the witnesses, contra
dicted the sworn testimony he gave at
the Coroner's inquest.
The testimony was in such conflict with
his former statements that ex-Judge Gib
son, who is defending Rogers, subjected
Haynes to a severe cross-examination. It
was then brought out that since testify
ing at the inquest Haynes had been vis
ited by H. V. Herbert, who is known as
the private detective of the District At
torney's office. Haynes said that it was
owing to the suggestions of Herbert that
I he changed his testimony. Judge Gibson
j brought this point out very clearly, and
I will make the most of it in the trial of
i Rogers. The first testimony of Haynes
was rather favorable to Rogers, but his
last testimony was decidedly unfavorable,
and it is this change which" is credited to
Herbert.
Herbert is the man to whom the Dis
trict Attorney gave the subpoenas for

ASKS FOR A SECOND DIVORCE.
Mrs. Bessie Cameron's Remarkable
Matrimonial
Career.
OAKLAND, April 20.â James T. Cam
eron is about to lose his wife, Bessie Cara
j eron. for the second time through the mi
i tervention of the divorce courts. Strange
j as it may seem. Mrs. Cameron is now in
volved in her third affair of the kind, but
only two men are interested.
Years ago she married Cameron. Later
she was divorced from him and married a
man named Foster. She was divorced
from him and after a while remarried
Cameron. Now she is seeking another
annulment. This time she charges cruelty
and asks for attorney's fees, costs and $25
; alimony monthly pending the trial.
Postponed Until Friday.
OAKLAND, April 20.â The meeting of
the Police and Fire Commissioners was
; not held to-day. The Mayor was busy
preparing for his daughter's wedding, and

MAY PLACATE
THE PULCIFERS
Young Men's Leagues
Desirous of Being
United.
Partisan Feeling Is Not Yet
Eliminated From the
Question.
Within a Few Days There May Bo
Perfsot Harmony in All
Quarters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 2U.
Overtures are now being made between
the Young Men's Republican leagues to
bring about a union. Harry Pulcifer has
been offered one of the vice-presidencies
of the league presided over by Mr. Breed,
but has not yet stated whether he will
accept or not. He has decided to call a
meeting of his followers next week, and
steps will be taken to try to end the un
pleasant controversy.
The offer of a vice-oresidency to Mr.
Pulcifer has not tended to bring the two
factions together, because it is an admis
sion on the part of the larger league that
something is due, and consequently nas
helped to foster the independent feeling
of the Pulcifers.
It has been suggested that If a union
cannot be arranged Mr. Pulcit'er should
diplomatically withdraw and organize a
Republican league under an entirely dif
ferent name that will not conflict with the
Young Men's Republican League. There
is really nothing to be gained oy continu
ing the struggle, for it is admitted on
both sides that if a joint vote of all the
parties Interested could be taken then;
would be a majority against Pulcifer.
Therefore he would be voted down and
all his plans upset, even supposing that
the two leagues joined.
The main bone of contention is not a
matter of who shall fill the offices of the
league. There is no disguising the fact
that the leaders of the Pardee and Davis
forces are anxious that it should appear
that the league is in favor of one or other
of these candidates. Although Mr. Breed
made an honest, square declaration on
this subject a week ago, there are so
many leading members of the league
pledged for their own individual interests
to support Dr. Pardee that it is very hard
for the Davis men to believe that they
will not attempt to swing the league into
line for Pardee. Of course. Mr. Pulcifer,
being associated in business with Mr.
Davis, is not going to do anything to help
Dr. Pardee; neither is he going to leave
any stone unturned to help Mr. Davis.
Consequently, the feeling of distrust is
mutual. While all are Republicans, they
have their preferences, and it would seem
fitting that those who cannot agree with
the principles of the league but who want
to reduce it to the level of a piece club,
should withdraw and organize little one
man bodies, who can follow their idols
without being subjected to suspicion of
duplicity.

Believes That Ships of War Are
Required for Protection From
Foreign Fleets.
BERKELEY, April 20.â As the neces
sity for strengthening the fortifications
along our seacoast and increasing our
naval force is generally admitted by
all patriotic citizens, I have concluded
to submit a few thoughts that have
have suggested themselves to me in
connection with this subject, with a
hope they may interest the public and
that some erf them may be utilized by
the men who are controlling the des
tinies of the nation. Several of our
seacoast cities lie so close to the ocean
that forts and guns, no matter how |
strong and powerful, cannot prevent i
their destruction by an enemy's fleet i
in time of war. This is especially true
of the cities of San Francisco and San
ta Barbara. One war vessel with mod
ern high-power long-range guns could
destroy either or both of these cities
with but little risk by approaching
them at night oÂ» during one of the fogs
that are so prevalent along the coast \
and commencing a bombardment, keep- :
ing in motion while in action.
Every projectile from the ship would
do more or less execution, while it
would be a mere accident if a shot
from a shore battery would hit the yes- j
sel. I have selected these cities as be
ing especially exposed to attack, but
there is scarcely a city on our seacoast
that is not in danger of being captured
or destroyed by an enemy's fleet if not
protected by war vessels. Even those ,
cities that are well inland on bays, \
harbors and rivers that are accessible â¢
to ocean vessels are not exempt from
this danger. As proof of this I would
call attention to the fact that Admiral
Farragut captured the city of Mobile in
1864 with a fleet of wooden vessels with
comparatively small loss, although the
city was defended by a number of for
tifications, shore baiterits, bunKei< i<_u
pedoes, rafts and some war vessels,
among them a formidable ram. The
monitors attached to Farragut's fleet !
took but little part in the combat, and ,
they were too slow and unable to keep j
up with the attacking squadron.
If the Confederates had had a fleet ,
of war vessels to give battle to Farra- '
gut's fleet in the lower bay, it is very '
probable that even if Farragut had
been successful his fleet would have
been so much injured by the conflict
that he could not have passed the for
tifications and obstructions and cap
tured the city.
Naval armor and armament have
kept up with fortifications and shore
batteries since then. What has been
done in the past can be done in the
future. The history of the wars of the
past teaches us that the more effec
tive way to defend is to attack, and
that a nation, city, army, fleet or fort
reduced to a purely defensive attitude |
generally succumbs sooner or later. ;
This has been the rule, with but few j
exceptions. In assuming the offensive, ,
the time, place and mode of attack can ,
be selected, which is a decided advan
tage in warfare, either by sea or by
land. I
It must therefore be evident to all j
who have given this subject much i
thought that fortifications alone are j
not sufficient for the protection of our ;
seaboard cities in time of war, and that
a strong fleet of war vessels is an ab- ;
solute necessity to prevent their de- ;
struction or capture by an enemy's !
fleet. If this is conceded, the question
naturally arises, What type of war :
vessel is best adapted, not only for
this purpose, but for the protection of I
our growing commerce and . our in- j
terests in foreign countries? Some of
the war vessels on which we are ex
pending large sums are to some extent
experiments, and may prove more
dangerous in action to those that j
serve on them than to the enemy. This |
is especially true of the battle-ship. |
It is so topheavy with armor and
guns that if it should meet with an ac
cident or be seriously injured in com
bat it would be likely to sink so fast
that it would be very difficult, if not
impossible, for the crew to escape even
in a smooth sea. This was fully dem
onstrated during the maneuvers of the
English fleet in June, 1893, when the
warship Camperdown accidentally
rammed the battle-ship Victoria, which j
caused the latter to sink so fast that
she carried with her to an untimely j
end over 400 of her officers and crew, j
This occurred in daylight during a j
smooth sea. This incident should of ;
itself be sufficient to cause our public |
men to hesitate before recommending
or authorizing the construction of any j
more battle-ships.
The unprotected cruiser is useful as j
a commerce destroyer, but as it stands
high out of the water it presents a j
conspicuous target for an enemy's j
guns, and is so constructed that the
guns and the men that operate them
are unprotected. If the men are killed
or wounded or the guns injured, the
vessel becomes useless as an engine of
warfare.
The monitor is too slow, and as it :
! possesses indifferent seagoing qualities j
it is useful for harbor defenses only. |
As a substitute for these vessels and ,
combining all of the best and most es- j
sential features of the three classes !
mentioned I would suggest a protected
torpedo grunboat that would Fit low in
j the water, with but few guns, some
large and some small, and as many
torpedo tubes ns could be advantage
ously used, with a high rate of speed,
light draught and good seagoing quali
ties. All of these important features
can be combined, and such a vessel
could be hastily constructed and easily
docked.
As all great naval engagements in
tho past have been fought near land, it
is very probable that conflicts of a like
! nature will also in the future be fought
near land. If such should be the case
vessels of light draught would have a
decided advantage over those drawing
more water.

ONLY PRAISE FOR
THE PRESIDENT
How McKinley Is Regarded by
the British Public in
General.
Hugh D. Craig Tells of His Impres
sions While In Europe
Recently.
Hugh D. Craig, president of the Cham
ber of Commerce, has just returned from
an extended trip through Europe. Ac
cording to his story, he has sipped the
finest wines of European cellars, tasted
the choicest fruits of ;ill sections, but
still he is very glad to get back to his
own State, and his praises are louder
than ever for California and her prod
ucts. Upon being asked what most at
tracted his attention while abroad Mr.
Craig answered without hesitation: "The
undisguised admiration of the people of
England for our President, McKinley.
The British nation to an individual is
with us in this trouble wiih Spain, and
for President McKinley every one speaks
In the highest praise for his marvelous
statesmanship. Not one word of criticism
did I hear of the manner in which he has
conducted the affairs of state.
â¢â¢I am satisfied that when the present
condition of affairs is fully understood
by the American people the President's
wisdom will be appreciated, as the Eng
lishmen now appreciate it. and the result
of this mutual understanding will surely
draw the two great nations, the Ameri
can and the British, together in one com
mon brotherhood, a condition that those
of the British Isles are. so desirous of
realizing. While in continental Europe 1
met many statesmen ami people of note,
and 1 did not hear one. even of those
races that we are inclined to regard with
suspicion, who had an adverse comment
to make upon the course oi our Presi
dent.* His straightforward and manly
course so impressed me that I wish to
have it Impressed upon the public. While
in Washington 1 had the pleasure of
meeting Mr. McKinley through Senator
Perkins. That was in the last week In
February, and then he promised to come
to California, business permitting. *'-';<â¢
then this trouble has arisen, and if it
continues very long he is not likely to
pay the promised visit. His intentions
were to come at the timo that Secretary
Wilson of the Department of Agriculture
makes his trip â¢â > this coast.
â¢While in Europe there was one thing
that attracted my attention, and that
was the- high standing of California
fruits, fresh and dried, in their markets.
I was surprised at the general demand,
and I am sure that if some good respon
sible jobber would make his headquarters
in London or Liverpool and deal in the
best fresh, dried and cann\d goods from
this State he would create even a gi
demand. They have the money there and
they are not afraid to upend it for what
Is good. Why. in the best hotels nf
Europe Lney are buying the best apples,
walnuts and almonds that the productive
district of northern Italy and southern
France produces; yet we would not dare
to send the stuff on to the market, as it
would he called â¢culls" of the crop. It
was not until I got on one of the Atlantic
Ftr-amers that 1 was able to get a.n
orange that was fit to eat. A Riverside
navel was placed on the table of the
steamer Majestic, and it was with pride
that I galled attention of the other pas
sengers to the fact that the fruit came
from my State."
Judging from Mr. Craig's expressions
he had a royal time and was well re
warded for his trip across the water. He
first went to Mexico, where he was inter
ested in grazing lands, and it was in the
interests of this project that he continued
"his journey on to Europe.
REBUILDING THE
SAN MATEO ROAD
Improving San Francisco's
First Electric Street
Railroad.
The Company Has Ordered a Supply
of New Cars From Carter
Brothers.
The San Mntco and San Francisco Elec
tric Railroad Company is just now en
gaged in rebuilding its lino from Thir
tieth street to Holy < 'ross. That portion
from the ferry to Thirtieth Btreet has
been finished with the very best material
to be found. The rails are the heaviest
ever put down on any street railroad in
the United States, a fifty pound rail hav
ing been substituted fur the original light
one formerly laid by the company that
built the road eight years ago. In ad
dition to this the entire roadbed has been
relald and paved with bitumen and basalt
blocks, according to the kind of pave
ments laid on the streets over which the
road runs. This rule has been adhered to
all along the line, and as a result the San
M.it .-I and San Francisco Railroad Com
pany has been the means of improving
th'- streets over which its cars are run-
A double track will be laid from Thir
tieth street to Holy Cross, thus doing
away with th" vexatious delays in wait-
Ing for cars to pass on the turnouts. A
similar double track is being laid on
Eighteenth street, from its Intersection
With Guerrero street to the Golden Gate
Pcirk
That portion of the line from Guerrero
to Diamond street is now undergoing a
transformation similar to that along the
main line from the ferries to Thirtieth
street. From Diamond street to the park
the road has already been put into Mrst
class condition. It will take about three
months to make the contemplated im
provements on the two arms of the road,
after which tin San Nfateo road will be
one of the bÂ°st in the city.
The management of this road, recogniz
ing the increased patronage, together
with the Increase of residents who have
lately bought homes In the outside dis
tricts, has given an order to Carter Bros,
at Newark tor an additional supply of
cars. These will be put on the line just
aa soon as finished, doing away with the
smaller cars which were n<<-d when the
road was first built and which have been
found Inadequate to meet the require
ments of the traveling public.
To give an Idea of the amouni of money
expended in the reconstruction < N f this
I :t ir safe to say that SW.iKHi has been
spent on the rebuilding of the road from
the ferries to Thirtieth strvi't. and it will
require as much to improve the two ad
ditional extensions now undergoing recon
struction. All this money has been spent
for material and labor in this city.

WILL RILE THE
GRAND CHAPTER
Royal Arch Masons in
Annual Session Elect
Officers.
Developments in the Coming
Benefit, for the Widows
and Orphans.
The Fair Estate Loans Its Property
to tho Order for a Floral
Show.
The Grand Chapter of Royal Arch
Masons of California, according to cus
tom, met on Tuesday, and has been in
cession since. Yesterday they elected
the following officers:
Companion Eli _T. Blackmer of San
Diego, grand high priest; Florin Leslie
Jones of Pasadena, deputy grand high
priest; Edward R. Hedges of Stockton, J
grand king; Samuel H. Wagener of !
San Jose, grand scribe; Franklin H.
Day of San Francisco, grand treas
urer; Thomas H. Caswell of San Fran
cisco, grand secretary and grand lec
turer; William C. Wittenmeyer of
Martinez, grand captain of the host;
Charles L. Patton of San Francisco,
grand royal arch captain; Charles
E. Stone of Marysville, grand chaplain;
Samuel D. Mayer of San Francbsco,
grand organist; Charles Gillet of Oak
land, grand guard.
Adolphus A. Hewel of Modesto was
appointed chairman of a committee t<Â»
revise the constitution of the Grand
Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the
State of California, and report at the
next session.
Before the session was closed for the
afternoon a motion was made and car
ried to donate $5000 to the Widows' and
Orphans' Home.
The Masonic festival, for which ex
tensive preparations are now being
made, is creating widespread enthusi
asm among Masons throughout the en
tire State.
The moms in the Masonic Temple
devoted to the sale of Mowers were
found to be much too small to accom
modate the increasing shipments, and
in order to supply the necessary room
the Fair estate loaned its property on
Post Btreet, adjoining the Temple, for
the purpose of carrying on the lucra
tive sale of the native beauties of Cal
ifornia.
The store at 16 Post street has al
ready been occupied by ladies of the
: committee of the coming festival.
Each day one of the booths will have a
numb<-r of Indies there to arrange and
distribute flowers. Either Mrs. Dr.
Flint or Mrs. L. \V. Moore will at all
times be found in the depot. The idea
is that all flowers sent will be received
there, and from there all merchants
nnd all others interested In the festival
will be able to obtain any flowers they
may want from now until the opening
of the fete. Arrangements have been
made for their prompt distribution, a
telephone has been Installed, and as the
country is supplying fresh flmvers from
day to day. it is more than probable
that those who will try to help char
ity will find excellent service In the de
livery of the flowers, tasteful arrange
ment and fair price.
One of the booths is to have a perfect
canopy Â°f flowers, and as patriotism
fills the air at this moment, the red,
white and blue, combined with the
stars, will be the leading feature.
Next Tuesday night the ladies of Fi
delity Lodge will meet and arrange
committees for special booth work. It
is their intention to increase the enthu
siasm and to add special features dur
ing the festival.
One of the latest features is a booth
â¢where many of the relics of Martha
Washington will be displayed.
The Grand Chapter of the Royal Arch
Masons yesterday made a donation to
the widows and orphans' fund which
was quite in keeping with the usual
generosity of that branch of the frater
nity.
EVILS OF GOOD FORTUNE.
John Comstock Is Arrested for Tak-
ing Money Which He Thought
His Own.
John Comstock, the well-known wrestler
and racetrack man, was arrested late last
evening by Detectives Reynolds and Gib-
Bon on a warrant sworn to by Ellen Hot
kins. Upon arrest he was taken to the
City Prison, and later released on a $2000
bond.
Comstock two weeks a#o won considera
ble money on tho races, and to celebrate
his good fortune he started on a carouse
around town, finally falling in with the
Hotkins woman, who proved to be more
than a genial companion in trying to help
him get rid of his money.

BOMBARDED WITH STONES.
Determined Attempt of Three Dissatisfied Employes
to Wreck the Bau Citu Iron Works.
Warrants to Be Sworn Out fop Their Arrest.
The Bay City Iron Works, at 228 Fremont street, has the appearance of having been bombarded by a hostile fleet.
In a moment of anger, due, so they claim, to the refusal of the proprietors to pay them their wages, three of the em
ployes bombarded the place with stones, breaking over 10) panes of glass and almost wrecked the front part of the
building. Fortunately nobody was injured by the flying missiles. The men. It is claimed. Importuned their employers
for their wages, and upon their refusal to pay them, they held a sort of an indignation meeting and resolved to attack the
building as their only means of revenge. They waited until the proprietors had left, and arming; themselves with
cobble stones made a concerted attack on the works. After completely wrecking the front of the bulldine the men
quietly left the scene.
Immediately after the occurrence was reported to the police Detectives Ryan and ODea were detailed to arrest
the window breakers. Last night they reported to Chief Lees that they had made a thorough Investigation and were
convinced that the men who wrecked the place were incited by a spirit of revenge due to their failure to collect the
wages due tlum.
Both the proprietors, however, deny that their employes had a hand In the outrage. They believe that the crimo was
committed by several drunken hoodlums, who were s-ien hanging around the works a short time before the place was
bombarded.
It is claimed that a private watchman witnessed the partial demolition of the building. He made no effort to arrest
the men, claiming that he had no right to interfere. He, however, says that they were employes of the Iron works,
and that they told him they were driven to commit the outrage through the refusal of the proprietors to pay them
their wages.
Hotel, where the woman, as Comstock
claims, attempted to rob him. They were
both under the influence of liquor at the
time. Comstock, Bjpon after he met the
woman, gave her $5, but when he found
that she was trying, and, in fact did at
tempt to rob him, he took the money
away from her, and it is for this robbery
âas she terms itâ that Comstock was ar
rested.

make any changes In its selection of
judges excepting that in E. J. Bull's
I place some local fancier may be appointed
| to judge greyhounds. The directors of the
club contend that Mr. Bull, the Eastern
judge who will pass judgment on all
i breeds of dogs, is a very capable man and
I that exhibitors can safely count upon a
fair field and no favor.
The Oakland Kennel Club will give a
show immediately after the exhibition
which will be held in Mechanics' Pavilion,
and in all probability the judge selected
by the Oakland dog fanciers will be J.ohn
Davidson, a man who has a wide reputa
tion* as a first-class all-around judge of
| dogs. There can be no gainsaying tho
j fact that the Oakland Kennel Club would
j have a very large entry if Davidson is
selected to judge.

SEATTLE
IS WIDE
AWAKE
Why the Northern
City Gets the Klon
dike Trade.
She Advertises Herself
Everywhere as "the"
Outfitting Point.
But Travelers Say That Her
Inferiority Is Being
Found Out.
A CHANCE FOR THIS CITY.
George E Miles and Dp. Hitchcock of
Boston Tell a Preg
, nant Talo.
Tn the opinion of George E. Miles
and Dr. W. S. D. Hitchcock, two well
known Boston citizens, on their way
to the Klondike regions, the merchants
of this city are not alive to the busi
ness opportunities that their rivals in
Seattle have discovered in the rush for
Alaska's golden shores.
George E. Miles, who has reached
prominence by his cable invention,
which is being used in the big library
at Washington, as manager for the
Mutual Mining and Trading Company
of Boston, is staying at the Occidental.
Mr. Miles stated yesterday that he
was surprised that the merchants of
this city have not displayed more
energy in advertising their wares, al
lowing Seattle merchants to get the
cream of the Klondike traffic.
"I came here from Boston with the
idea of looking for the best place in
which to buy goods and to out/It our
company," said Mr. Miles. "Having
heard and read of Seattle as the best
place to buy things, I went there, and
was surprised to find after a long ex
amination that the goods sold there
were of a very inferior quality. I also
found prices to be higher than they
are here.
"As I was unable to charter a vessel
at a reasonable figure, I came down
to San Francisco and was surprised
at the excellence of the outfits and the
easy time I had in chartering a ves
sel.
"The reason why Seattle is getting
much of the Klondike trade is because
they are extensive advertisers. Boston
people contemplating going north en
ter a railroad office in their city and
are informed that Seattle is the best
place to embark from. On the streets
men with placards on their backs and
dressed in Klondike outfits parade the
streets, advertising Seattle, while not a
line about this city is seen.
"I learned to-day that bureaus of in
formation were established throughout
the Eastern States by your merchants,
but not a word was heard from them.
"Then again there is very little ad
vertising done in your local papers and
if a person desires to order an outfit he
has to walk the streets until he finds
a big sign informing him that goods
can be purchased there.
"There are still many thousands of
New England people who are going to
visit the Alaska regions, and the soon
er the local merchants awaken to the
situation the better it will be for them."
Dr. W. S. D. Hitchcock, a well-known
physician from the "Hub," who will ac
company the expedition, substantiat
ed what Mr. Miles said, and added fur
ther that he intended to lay In a large
supply of drugs, which he would buy in
this city. He stated that the chances
of buying goods cheaper in this cit>
were so good that he telegraphed to Se
attle to two other members of the party
to come to this city.
As an example of the enterprise dis
played by the Seattle merchants, he
showed telegrams that he had received
to the effect that they would journey
here if they could do business with him.

ciety in the county, with over a hun
dred members, besides an intermediate
and a Junior Christian Endeavor So
ciety and a junior endeavor connected
with the East Santa Cruz Chapel.
A pleasant feature to-day was the re
ceipt of a congratulator telegram from
Evangelist Yatman, who will commence
a series of evangelistic 'eetings in con
nection with the church two weeks hence.
They are to be held at the armory.
Rev. W. W. Case, presiding elder of the
San Francisco district, arrived to-day
1 and presided this evening at the member
: ship rollcall meeting. The services opened
with an anthem by the choir, followed by
prayer. The stirring fellowship rr- -n,
"Blest Be the Tie That Binds. " was sung,
and then the roll of over 400 names was
called.
ILLEGAL DRAWING
OF TWO PENSIONS.
Greed of a Veteran Leads to His
Detection and Conviction in
the District Court.
NEW YORK, April 20.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Benjamin
Dorwart was convicted to-day before
Chief Justice Bingham of the District
Court on a charge of illegally drawing
two pensions. Dorwart was a soldier in
the regular army, and as such applied in
1875 for a pension. He wÂ»s allowed $10 a
month. He had also been a volunteer,
and in 1889 he applied for a pension for
this service. He stated in his application
that he was not a pensioner, and the bii
reau took his word for it. although both
applications were made out In the same
name. The bureau issued to Dorwart an
other certificate calling for $17 a month.
From that time until February of this
year he continued to draw both pensions,
bne being paid at the San Francisco
agency and the other at the Philadelphia
agenc'v. Dorwart might have continued
to defraud the Government for years had
he not made an application in January for
an increase in his $17 pension. Then it
was found that he was already drawing
two pensions. He is suffering from dis
eases of the stomach, is par"alyzed in one
arm and deaf in one ear. In view of the
fact that most of his troubles are due to
his army service the jury recommended
him to the mercy of the court.
