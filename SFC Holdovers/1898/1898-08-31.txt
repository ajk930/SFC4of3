..â¢.â -. SEATTLE, Aug. 30.â The steamer
â¢ : Roanoke arrived here to-day from St.
Michael, Alaska, with 458 passengers
and gold dust which a conservative es
timate places at $1,600,000. The bulk of
it was the property of the Canadian
Bank of Commerce and the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company. The amount credited to the
Canadian Bank of Commerce Is $600,
000. A majority of the passengers were
men who went to Dawson in last year's
rush. They have no gold, but lots of
experience. The fortunate passengers
numbered about seventy-five. Of these
probably twenty-five had over $10,000
each. The amounts held by the remain
ing fifty ran from $500 to $5000. The fol
lowing is a list of the richest ones and
the amount they brought out:
G. W. Jenkins, $53,000; Theodore An
derson, $50,000; George Carraack, $35,
000; Stick Jim. $35,000; Tagish Charley,
$35,000; Ike Powers, $15,000; D. Doane,
â¢ $lo,(W0; F. Renaud, $15,000.
These men were among the first who
- went into the Klondike. George Car
mack was the discoverer of the Klon
dike. He located the first claim on
.. Bonanza Creek. Stick Jim and Tagish
Charley are full-blooded Indians.
An unusual incident attending the ar- I
â¢-. rival of the Roanoke was the holding !
! â  and searching of her passengers and '
â their baggage for three sacks of stolen I
.. gold dust. Each individual passenger i
was examined as he came off the '
3teamer, but the missing gold was not !
.-. found. The sacks contained about :
â  124..000. The owners of the stolen gold
â¢ â¢ were Albert Fox. whose sack contained
â¢ 114,000; William Folmer, $9000, and Dr. !
0, F- Adams of Chicago, $900. The gold j
was taken from a stateroom on thf
Rorf-noke while she was lying at St.
Michael. There it) no clew to the thief, i
A search of the vessel was made at St.
Michael before she left, but with no '
. better success than was achieved to- I
day.
Another robbery is reported to have
â¢ occurred on the river steamer Cudahy
between Dawson and St. Michael. Some
one got hold of a sack belonging to 'â 
"Stick Jim," an Indian, containing i
$7000. They dumped out the gold and i
filled the sack with shot. The substi- I
tutlon was not discovered until St. j
Michael was reached.

COLONEL HENRY ARR STED.
Admits the Authorship of a Letter involved in the
Dreyfus Case.
Special Cable to The Call and the N>w York Herald. Copyrighted 1898 by
James Gorden Bennett. ' '
PARIS, Aug. 30.â Lieutenant Colonel Henry has been arrested
and taken to the fort at Mont Valerien by order of M. Cavaignac,
Minister of War. He acknowledged that he was the author of the
famous letter containing the phrase, "Cette canaille D ," in the
Dreyfus-7ola case.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry was one of the witnesses in the recent
trial of Emlle Zola to contradict minor points of testimony given
by Colonel Picquart. He was subsequently wounded in a duel with
the latter officer. The arrest to-day was the result of a discovery
that he was the author of the famous letter. After he had been
apprehended he made the confession.
The papers say that, owing to a letter from Colonel Picquart to
M. Cavaignac, revealing matters which professional secrecy had
hitherto prevented him divulging, the Minister of War examined all
the officers of the general staff on the Dreyfus affair. Lieutenant
Colonel Henry, on being pressed with question?, confessed that he
waÂ« the author of a letter which was one of the three documents
connected with the conviction of Dreyfus.
The arrest of Colonel Henry and the confession that he wrote the
letter containing the famous reference to "That canaille D " re
vives Interest in the Dreyfus-Zola case. In fact, the excitement
and feeling engendered by the trial of Zola had not yet died down
throughout France. The following from the London Speaker treats
of the situation as it waa before the sensational arrest of Henry:
"The Dreyfus-ZoW Esterhazy embroglio continues to exhibit fresh
developments. M. Zola's appeal against his conviction by the Paris
Police Court for libeling the handwriting experts has resulted In an
Increase of his penalty, and the decisions of the Court of Cassation
â¢.as to the connection of his defense and the Dreyfus case is, so far
as it goes, adverse to his claim to widen the issues in his own case.
And the opinion of the French prosecutor that there is no ground
for the prosecution of Major Esterhazy and Mile. Pays for forgery
6f documents and subornation of forgery is still a graver check.
â  This opinion conflicts with the views of M. Bertulus, the Juge d'in
struction who conducted their examinations. The proceedings have
bfought on the scene one Christian Esterhazy, a cousin of the
major, who declares that he himself both arranged the interview
with the veiled lady and secured the collaberation of M. dv Paty de
Clam in the maneuvers Intended to divert suspicion from Esterhazy
to Dreyfusâ all of which is invaluable material for the advocates of
a new trial "

The reindeer herds received a gratify
ing increase in the spring by the birth
of a large number of fawns.
Dr. Jackson also established the head
quarters of the Laplanders at Una
laklik, where they will be sent to vari
ous parts of Alaska where their services
may be needed in carrying the mall
with reindeer. Many of -these Lapps
have already taken out their first pa
pers, looking to naturalization.
Dr. H. K. Gambell of lowa has been
appointed Government physician at the
reindeer station at Unalaklik.

AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS
IN THE GOLD FIELDS
SEATTLE, Aug. 30.â One of the most
interesting characters who returned on
the steamer Itoanoke from Alaska is
George W. Carmaek. He is accompa
nied by his tillicum and partner,
"Skookum Jim." As the first claim la
cater in the Klondike mining district
Carmaek hus made his name familiar
the world over. His people came to
California in '49, and the fortunate
George, who will soon count his wealth
among the millions, llrst saw the light
of day on a cattle ranch near Port
Costa, Cal., September 24, 1860.
It is about fourteen years since
George Carmaek left his California
home and took up his abode with the
Indians in Alaska. Until quite recently
however, he was but a squawman of
indifferent success. During most of the
time that he roamed from Juneau over
the lakes and down the Yukon to St.
Michael, he had as his companions two
| brothers, "Tagish Charley" and "Skoo
kum Jim." They were with him August
17, 1896, when about twelve miles up
Bonanza Creek Carmaek accidentally
struck his shovel into the gravel at the
foot of a tree. The dirt he threw up
was full of gold. He staked a claim,
as likewise did his partners adjoining
him, and thus began the evolution of
"Squawman" George into a man of
wealth and prominence.
After locating the three men started
for Forty-mile to record their claims.
arriving there Carmaek proceeded
to celebrate his discovery by getting
the entire camp on a drunk. The
golden news that the long-looked-foT
bonanza had been struck was received
with shouts, and almost the entire
camp stampeded. Circle City heard of
it a few weeks later and Birch Creek
was soon deserted. Bonanza was soon
located from top to bottom, and those
who did not get claims on the creek
began to locate on El Dorado. This
proved even richer, and since then the
Klondike has been rapidly growing into
the greatest gold camp of the century.
When George Carmaek arrived in Se
attle to-day he presented the appear
ance of a fine specimen of Western
manhood. He Is over six feet tall and
has remarkably broad shoulders, while
a drooping black mustache adorns his
firm face. He is well educated for a
frontiersman and his cabin on Dis
covery Bonanza is well stocked with
late books and magazines. A small
organ is one of the most out-of-place
looking things it contains. To some of
his friends he has confided the idea of
having a yacht built for a trip to Paris.
Carmaek has looked well after the in
terests of his two Siwash partners and
the 1500 reet of placer ground they own
has turned out to be about the richest
spot in the whole Klondike. Had it
not been for Carmaek, "Tagish Char
ley" and "Skookum Jim" would have
been without claims to-day. He aim
ply would not let them sell out t
scheming white men and compelle
them to work their claims.
Carmaek has taken out of his mine
in the past two years about ?500,0"00 an
his kinsmen have realized about th
same amount from their properties
The combined claims of the three me
could .â * readily sold at Dawson fo
over $1,000,000.

ISLAND OF
TUTUILA MAY
BECOME OURS
Plan to Divide the Sa~
moan Group.
EFFECT OF MALI ETOA'S DEATH
PRESENT GOVERNMENT LIKELY
TO BE ABOLISHED.
Has Been Unsatisfactory From the
Start, and the Three Nations
Would Welcome a
Change.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.â The State
Department has not yet been officially
advised of the reported death of King
Malietoa of Samoa, and in all likeli
hood must remain in official ignorance
of the event for some time to come, ow
ing to the slow queans of communi
cation at the disposal of the depart
ment. It is the general impression
here that the death of the King will
result In the overthrow of the present
form of government of the islands,
maintained as it is by the joint action
of the United States, Great Brit
ain and Germany. Official reports to
the State Department show that this
Government is the most expensive and
unsatisfactory of any in the world,
having regard to the population of the
Samoan group. In the capital city,
Apia, there is maintained a tripartite
muntcipal government at vast propor
tional expense, while the reports show
that thirty-two rate payers are obliged
to bear the entire cost.
For years the existing arrangement
for the government of the Samoan
group has been satisfactory to none of
the three governments, yet It has been
continued for the reason that nothing
better could be suggested that would
be acceptable to the nations. There
are now indications that at least one
of the parties Is coming around to
what was a favorite plan of settlement
of the State Department, namely, a
disruption of the present tripartite
government and an absolute division
of the islands of the group between the â¢
United States, Great Britain and Ger
many.
The particular object of our Govern
ment has been to retain possession of
;i < â  Hdng or a full naval station In the ,
islands, so as to afford a base for naval
operations in the vicinity of Austra- .
lasia, as well as to insure an open port j
for our steamers on the long voyage â 
from San Francisco to Australia.
The United States now hold title to
some ground for a coaling station at
Pago Pago, on the island of Tutulla.
This island is the least in size of any
of the group, but it is large enough 10
support a naval station, so it has been
the plan of the State Department to
acquire it as a whole in the event of
the dissolution of the tripartite agree-
! ment.
Basing the division of the existing
interests of the three nations, Ger
many, holding the largest interest,
would take the island second in size,
possessing the capital, Apia, while
Great Britain would secure the largeit
lof the group, but the second In com
mercial Importance.
It is probable that among the first
duties falling to Mr. Hay when he as
sumes the office of Secretary of Stat-?
will be the consideration of som i plan
to tide over the crisis expectei to ful
'ow the death of the King.
TREATY OF BERLIN
MUST BE OBSERVED
Samoan Natives Will Elect the Suc
cessor of the Late King
Malietotu
NEW YORK, Aug. 30.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The President has notified the German
Government that the United States will
expect no interference with the natives
in Samoa in exercising their right and
privilege to elect as. cessor to the late
King, Malietoa Laupepa. When in
formation was received showing that
it was impossible for the King to live
any length of time, the German Em
bassador here, in accordance with in
structions from Berlin, addressed a
communication to the State Depart
ment, asking what action would be
taken by the United States in estab
lishing a ruler of the Samoan Islands
in the event of Malietoa's death. The
inquiry was only recently answered by
Secretary Day, who discussed it with
the President.
I was told to-day on good authority
that the Secretary informed the Em
bassador that the President fully ex
pected that the provisions of the treaty
of 18S9, signed by representatives of the
United States, Great Britain and Ger
many, would be carried out. It is the
contention of the administration that
the treaty was framed especially to
meet the contingency which now ex
ists, and that there ought to be no
question between the three signatory
powers as to the programme to be
adopted now in view of Malietoa's
death.
Instructions have been sent to Consul
General Osborne. setting forth the po
sition assumed by this Government and
directing him to sharply watch the
situation.
No action has been taken yet by this
Government looking to the dispatch of
a warship to Samoa, but it is be
lieved that It may be necessary to do
this. A vessel either from Rear Ad
miral Dewey's squadron or from the
Pacific Coast will be ordered to Sa
moan waters. Â«fcich action will be
merely precautionary and will be In
dicative of the purpose of this Govern
ment to .have the terms of the Berlin
treaty carried out.

NEW YORK, Aug. 30.â A Sun cablegram from Manila says: Aguinaldo, the insurgent leader, has is
sued a memorial address to all foreign powers, reciting the fact that the Filipinos have formed a govern
ment under the constitution adopted on June 23.
He adds that the Filipino forces have since carried on a campaign of liberty, have taken forty prov
inces and have reduced Manila. They have 9000 prisoners.
Peace and tranquillity prevail in the conquered provinces, and there is no resistance to Aguinaldo's
authority The campaign, the memorial says, was conducted with due regard to the rules of civilized
warfare.
He asks for recognition of the Independence of the Philippines republic, or, failing in that, to grant
the Filipinos belligerent rights.
The United States is not mentioned in the memorial.
LONDON, Aug. 31.â A dispatch to the Daily Telegraph from Manila, dated August 27. says:

SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Aug. 30.â
Garcia has been relieved of his
command by General Gomez, acting
under instructions from the Provi

to disapproval of his actions during
the Shafter incident and to the fact
that Garcia is persona non grata to

At the commencement of the war
the Cuban officers were ordered to
put themselves under the orders of
the American commanders, and the

upon as a breach of discipline. His

TEE SECRETARY ADMITS THE
"SECRET" DISPATCH.
If the General Made the Statements
Attributed to Him Ho
Will Be Court-
Martialed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 30.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following:
"I cannot believe General Miles made
the statements attributed to him by the
correspondent from Porto Rico. He
could not have made them and been
sane at the same time."
This statement was made to me to
day by Secretary Alger touching the al
leged arraignment of himself and Adju
tant General Corbin by General Miles
in connection with the suppression of
parts of certain dispatches and the con
cealment of other dispatches. The pub
lication of the story to-day has been
almost the one topic of conversation
in the War Department, but Secretary
Alger refused at present 10 regard the
matter seriously.
When his attention was called more
closely to the charges alleged to have
been made by General Miles, he said:
"General Miles perfectly understood
when he left Washington that he was
not to supersede General Shatter and
he so stated in an interview sent from
Washington City to the New York Her
ald."
Secretary Alger pointed out the sofa
on which General Miles sat when the
understanding was reached as to the
purpose of his going to Santiago.
"Did General Miles know that the
dispatch had been sent to General Shat
ter, saying that Miles wag not to su
persede him?" I asked.
"He did not," the Secretary replied.
"He had sailed, but he perfectly under
stood it from our conversation and
from his own understanding as to the
situation as given by himself to the
Herald. In view of the fact tbat Gen
eral Shafter was selected larj ly be
cause he was recommended by General
Miles, and in view of the fact that
Porto Rico was to be the obj active
point of General Miles when he started,
I say I cannot conceive how General
Miles could have made the statements
imputed to him and been sane at the
same time."
"Will General Miles be court-mar
tialed?"
Just then Secretary Alger told his
private secretary to get the papers to
gether relating to the controversy and
said he wanted the statements in the
Herald also, "which proved indisput
ably," he said, "that there was no
thought in the mind of General Miles
superseding General Shafter."
"Will General Miles be court-mar
tialed?" I asked again.
"If General Miles made these state
ments," answered the Secretary, "it
I was unmilitary and proper action will
be taken. I do not, however, care to
anticipate events until his acts are offi
cially presented."
Secretary Alger would not believe
that General Miles ever gave out the
dispatches or gave the interviews.
"Of course," he said, "he might, have
been arawn into imprudent speech, just
as men traveling together on a Pull
man car will often talk to strangers
about their most personal matters.
There's nothing that makes one so
confidential as traveling together. In
this light, after some compliment or
other from the correspondent. General
Miles may have said something which
he did not intend foT print."
GENERAL MILES WILL
HAVE TO EXPLAIN
WASHINGTON. Aug. 30. â When
General Miles rÂ»turns to Washington
he will be asked for an explanation of
interviews lately appearing and the
publication of certain dispatches which
the War Department had not made
public. Whether the Investigation will
take the form of a military court of
inquiry or of a private interview be
tween the President, the Secretary of
War and General Miles remains still
to be seen. Until the arrival of Gen
eral Miles, the War Department will
not discuss the matter.
Secretary Alger says the department
will not enter into any controversy
with its subordinates, and he does not
propose to discuss matters affecting
General Miles during his absence. The
department is of the opinion that Gen
eral Miles made public the dispatches
of the Secretary, General Shafter and
himself, published this morning. Such
action it regards as a breach of mili
tary regulations, but no military court
can secure proof that General Miles
made public the dispatches if he and
the person to whom they were fur
nished refuse to give the information,
as several military trials have made it
settled law that no military court can
compel a civilian to testify if he does
not desire to. General Miles also may
be called to account for the interviews
with him, as, unless disavowed, they
would place him in the attitude of crit
icizing his superior officers and subject
him to military discipline.
The publication of the dispatches to
day, taken together with previous in
terviews In the Kansas City Star, were
the topic of conversation among officers
of the War Department and already
there is a disposition by some to take
sides in the matter, while others deplore
the conditions as tending to lower the
tone of the army and to do irreparable
injury to the service.
It is expected the controversy will
extend to both houses of Congress, and
it is feared it will have an adverse ef
fect upon legislation which will be
asked for to better the army. It is
generally understood that the regular
force will have to be largely increased,
at least until the conquered islands are
disposed of, and it is feared that legis
lation in this direction will be hampered
by the controversy between the Secre
tary of War and the general Ij* com
mand of *he army.2

PAX JOSE, Aug. 30.â The High School

entire city in their strike, and the sec

than ever to continue the fight. The

of financial help, and the tuition of
students not able to pay will be taken
from a fund raised for that purpose.
There was an increase of nearly a
dozen to the strikers' ranks to-day, and
a steady withdrawal of pupils from the
local High School is predicted. Students
have promised to leave in twos and
threes .and go to Santa Clara, and it is
estimated that at least fifty at the
BOhool-will join the strikers in this
manner inside of a month.
The students were quietly conveyed
to the Santa Clara High School this
morning. All the excitement of yes
terday had disappeared and things ran
along in the usual way at the school.
No one would have thought the Santa
Clara school a haven for pupils unable
to longer bear the tyrannical rulings of
the Rea gang.
Principal Shumate of the San Jose
High School claimed some fifteen new
pupils registered this morning, but none
ofthe pupils seemed to know about the
increase. The . entire faculty of the
school were out skirmishing for pupils
last evening. Students going to Santa
Clara were visited and begged to come
back. All kinds of promises were made
to induce the scholars to return, but
without avail.
On the other hand the strikers are
meeting with great success. Students
wjtose parents have driven them to
school here are rendering the Santa
Ciara pupils great aid.

pleased with the school strike. They
blame the School Trustees for dismiss

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Aug. 30.â Seeking to save
a child from the attack of a 17-year-old
boy, Louis Rosenbloom, a Jewish rabbi
and a teacher of Hebrew, was himself
assaulted and kicked to death.
John Sehleeta, the boy charged with
the murder, lives with his mother at 230
De Koyen street. In the same house
lives a family named Levi, and Rosen
bloom had been intrusted with the edu
cation of one of the children of this
family. Young Schlecta had locked 3
year-oid Julius Levi in a shed and
when the child's mother objected he
struck her on the face. Hyman Levi,
11 -years old, the boy whom Mr. Rosen
bloom is teaching, interfered in his
mother's behalf. He was kicked into
the street.
At this juncture the teacher arrived
and ordered Schlecta to leave the boy
alone. Schlecta turned on Rosenbloom
and struck him in the mouth, then fol
lowed the blow up with' a fierce attack
with his heels. 'Rbsenbloom rolled into
the street and tried to regain his feet,
but before he could rise Schlecta was
upon him and renewed the assault.
A half dozen young men who had
been loitering in the vicinity took a
hand in the ; attack and did not desist
until the clang of a patrol wagon bell
warned ". them of . the approach of the
police. By 'the time the officers arrived
they had fled and only Rosenbloom
was in the street. He was picked up
and died' before the wagon could be
started .for the hospital. >
Rosenbloom .was born in Poland and
was 64 years of age. He graduated from
a university in Europe and was con
sidered a talented man. He came to
America, thirty years ago and settled in
Chicago. â -.> . â¢ .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PEKING, Aug. 30.â A high member
of the Tsung Li Yamen (Chinese For
eign Office), who is a British sympa
thizer, complained, in the course of a
recent interview, that Great Britain's
assurances of support against Russian
aggression were belated.
"Why," asks this functionary, "with
hold such a declaration until Russia
has secured Port Arthur and France
obtained considerable concessions in
the south? The disintegration of the
empire has begun and to-day the ne
cessity for strong action is less urgent
than when Russia first obtained a foot
hold."
He admitted that <~" ma had broken
her promises to England; but this, he
argued, was because Russian pressure
was too strong to be resisted. He com
plained of "British Ignorance of Rus
sia's, line of action," and argued:
"Why does not England approach Rus
sia directly wit'- a declaration that
Russia's interference in China will be
regarded as a casus belli? It is use
less to punish helpless China and to
participate in the disintegration of the
empire. The Tsuner Li Yamen pre
fers that British influence should be
paramount, but it is unable to do any
thing unless England helps, with sword
In hand." ____

EAGER TO AVENGE
AGED MRS. MORSE
Citizens at Point Arena
Will Act.
WILL APPEAL TO MR. BUDD
WANT A REWARD OFFERED BY
THE STATE.
Outspoken in the Belief That Sons of
Poisoned Woman Are Trying
to Shield a Guilty Rela
tive. 1
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POINT ARENA, Aug. 30.â Disgusted
with the slow progress in unraveling
the mystery surrounding the murder of
Mrs. Morse the citizens of this town
have decided to petition Governor Budd
to offer a reward for the apprehension
of the person or persons who caused
her death. They think that the Morse
brothers are not overanxious to have
the arrest made, knowing, it is claimed,
that such course would mean the im
prisonment of at least one of their
relatives for murder.
"We are waiting patiently until the
services of the private detective are
dispensed with," remarked one of the
leading citizens to-day, "and then we
intend to act. The investigation thus
far has savored of a farce. Shortly
after the commission of the crime we
wanted to have at least two suspects
arrested, but Le Grand Morse would
not listen to us. He, however, prom
ised us that Le would do all In his
power to land the poisoner in jail and
asked our co-operation. After consid
erable time had elapsed and the fiend
had completely covered up his tracks
he sent to San Francisco for a private
detective to work on the case. The de
tective has been here over a week and
as far : -. we know he has not been able
to obtal.i a clew which would lead to
the apprehension of the murderer.
"As soon as the investigation is con
cluded we intend to appeal to Governor
j Budd, asking him to offer a reward of
i $2000 for the arrest and conviction of
the murderers. After this is done we
will appoint a committee to appear be
fore the Supervisors of this county, in
form them of the miscarriage of justice
and request them to offer an additional
reward. By these means we hope to
make the guilty persons suffer for their
| awful crime.
"I am morally certain that there are
several people in this town who could
shed some light upon the mystery, but
for various reasons they have refused
to speak. A reward will no doubt in
duce them to tell what they know. Af
ter we obtain sufficient evidence it is
our purpose to lay the matter before
the District Attorney and ask for war
rants for the arrest of the guilty. If
justice then fails we will always feel
that we were not to blame."
"I ha.ye heard of the unfavorable
comments* about ray action in the
case," replied Le Grand Morse, when
told of the threatened appeal to the
Governor, "but I think they are very
unjust. When I recovered from the ef
fects of the poisoned mush which I had
eaten I at once communicated with De
tective Harry Morse of San Francisco,
asking him to send one of the best men
in his employ. As the detective whom
he was anxious to send was out of the
city he wrote me apprising me of that
fact and promising to have him here
as soon as possible. He came a few
days later and has since been indus
triously working on the case. I have
given him every opportunity to unravel
the mystery, frequently assisting him
in his work. While he has accumulated
some evidence against certain persons
there is not enough to warrant me in
having them arrested. It is an injustice
to me to have it said I have not done
all in my power to land the guilty party
or parties behind prison bars. I have
already spent considerable money in
trying to ferret out the murderers of
my poor mother and if necessary would
give all my earthly possessions to see
the fiends locked in jail.
It is understood that the detective
will in a few days make his final re
port to Morse and be dismissed. He
will accuse nobody of the crime, but
will strongly intimate it was com
mitted by relatives who are under sus
picion.
There are many persons here who are
inclined to believe that Mrs. Morse just
before her death spoke the name of
one of the persons who poisoned her.
This Is emphatically denied by Le
J Grand Morse. He says that after he
had partaken of a few teaspoonfuls of
the mush he felt sick and told his
mother that he thought he was pois
oned. She also complained of feeling
ill, and, mixing an emetic, she ordered
her son to take it. He begged her to
drink it, saying that he would wait un
til she had been relieved of the poison.
With true motherly devotion Mrs.
Morse ordered her son to take emetic
while she stood by, suffering excruciat
ing pain from the effects of the dead
ly mush. After her son had taken the
emetic Mrs. Morse hastily prepared a
fresh emetic, and, after taking it, lay
down on a lounge. When asked by
her son how she felt, the aged victim
whispered that she was very sick and
thought she would die.
"Who could have done this?" she
asked of her son.
He replied that he did not know, but
would do all in his power to find out.
According to Morse, those were the
only words spoken by his mother after
she was taken sick. After his mother
had passed away, the victim of a cruel
poisoner, Lewis Morse, suspecting that
Mrs. Bpaulding had committed the
deed, proceeded tc have her arrested.
His brother, however, refused to al
low him to act, claiming there was not
sufficient evidence against her. Since
then other relatives have been placed
under the ban of suspicion, but for
some unexplained reason no attempt
has been made to connect them with
the crime.

Inquiry Into the Clubman's Finan

Court Productive of a
Sensation. 3
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 30.â The
m rital woes of Nat Brittan and his
wife Isabella were aired in the Super
ior Court to-day. Mrs. Brittan began
suit for divorce "last June, charging ex
treme cruelty on the part of her hus
band. The proceeding before Judge
Buck to-day was the application of
Mrs. Brittan to secure $1500 per month
alimony and $5000 counsel fees. The
plaintiff was represented by George C.
Ross and Reardon & Lande of San
Francisco and the defendant by Ed
ward F. Fitzpatrick and John L. Love,
also of San Francisco.
An affidavit was read from the plain
tiff stating that during the last two
years her husband had lived apart from
his family and had refused to provido
for them the necessaries of life. There
are three daughters whom the mother
desires to rear in a manner suitable to
their station in life, but has been un
able to do so owing to her own small
income and to Mr. Brittan's indiffer
ence. In her testimony she stated that
Brittan had warned various tradesmen
of San Francisco not to give her credit
and on this account she was subjected
to much humiliation and insult. Dur
ing their residence in San Francisco
Mrs Brittan stated that her husband
was in the habit of spending successive
days and nights at the gaming table,
and once after a three days' bout with
the sports he returned somewhat in
ebriated in the company of Warren
Payne, and when she remonstrated
Payne took a hand in the discussion,
and informed her that Mr. Brittan's
conduct was perfectly proper and in ac
cordance with his rights as a free
American citizen, or words of that im
port.
In addition to lack of provisions Mrs.
Brittan alleged that she suffered from,
lack of firewood. On one occasion she
went forth and felled a tree herself and
provided the necessary fuel, but the ex
ertion cost her several days of sickness.
On cross-examination it was brought
out that her various creditors held Mr.
Brittan responsible for all bills, and
outside of a few dealers Mrs. Brittan
had no trouble in procuring the actual
necessaries of life. Mr. Brittan, it was
claimed, was willing to pay his wife
any reasonable alimony, but thought
the amount asked was exorbitant.
During Brittan's examination the at
torneys sought to bring out more testi
mony regarding his domestic affairs,
but were stopped by the Judge, -wYio art*.
vised that the only testimony required
at this proceeding was that which
would throw light upon the defendant's
financial status in order that the court
might dispose of the alimony question.
An examination on this line disclosed
an alarming condition of affairs. What
with trust deeds, mortgages, first and
overlapping, the genial clubman is lit
erally smothered in debt, his liabilities
, amounting to $149,000.

RECEPTION BY YOUNG LADIES
OF SAN JOSE.
Struggle for the Grand Presidency
â  Grows Exciting, With Chances
' . " Apparently in Favor oÂ£
. i Gildea,
"" " Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Aug. 30.â The framing and
adoption of amendments constituted the
principal work of the convention of the
"Tpung Men's Institute at Its second ses
el-on. Economy seems to be the basis of
; their adoption, as hardly one was passed
â .that had for Its purpose anything: other
. than the decrease of salaries and the
/total abolition of. all unnecessary ex
pense.
. .There was a little- more diversity In the
work of the convention during the after
noon session than that transacted in the
inornlng. Upon being called to order, a
â communication was read from Bishop
Montgomery of Los Angeles In answer
to the greeting extended him by the con-
verition on Monday. In it he expressed
his satisfaction and appreciation of the
good work of the society during the past
year, and extended the *iope that for the
future the present convention would se
lpct as Judicious a body of officers to
govern the society during: the coming
year as that which is now about to be
dissolved.
A resolution thanking Father Torke. as
the representative of the Monitor, for his
work In aiding the lecture bureau, by
helping to make it a success through the
columns of the Catholic paper, was in
troduced by A. F. St. Sure and unani
mously adopted.
' The selection of headquarters in the
Pioneer buildlnc by the San Francisco
councils was approved and the appropria
tion of $40 a month for its operation
voted.
. The motion to abolish the present cus
tom of allowing grand directors traveling
expenses was unanimously defeatedâ the
amount which Is now allowed them be
ing established.
The amendment to regulate thÂ« per
capita tax was also defeated. The time
for the annual meeting of the Grand
Council wan permanently established at
August 13 of each year.
A resolution iv.is in trounced by Emmet
Hayden, a delegate to the present conven
tion, to have the next Grand Council held
at San Rafael, and it is now safe to nay
that thf annual session of 1599 will be held
in that town.
The proposed amendment for the pur
pose or holding all annual sessions in San
P*ranclsco was defeated and Hayden haa
evidently everything his own way.
The proposition advanced to reduce the
mileage expense now allowed delegates
was voted down, as was also the sugges
tion that such expense be paid by sub
counclla.
An amendment that proved successful
and received the approbation of the entire
convention was that relating to having
the established time for the collection of
the per capita tax fixed at October 1,
June 1, April 1 and July 1. The suggestion
of having this tax collected in equal in
stallments wus also approved.
The appointment of A. F. St. Sure of
No. 24. Alameda, and W. F. Humphrey as
members of the finance committee closed
the afternoon session.
In the evening a reoeptlon was tendered
the delegates by the members of Council
No. 82 of the Young Ladies' Institute. An
interesting and well arranged programme
was rendered and the occasion made
memorable by those directly in charge.
The programme presented waa as fol-
lows:
Overture, Bchuberfs Auditorium Orchestra;
address by the Rev. Father Kenna of Bt.
Joseph's Church- vocal eolo. P. L. Unehan,
accompanied by Miss Rich of Oakland; recita

Schubert; violin solo, "I'm the Little Drum-
mer." E. "Williams, accompanied by Miss Maud
Caldwell; character bolo, A. Bendelebln.
Immediately after the rendition of thÂ«
programme refreshments were served the
guests. Upon departure each delegate
was presented a souvenir consisting of
three artificial moon flowers of the three
colors of the American flag. Among
those present were the following:
Misses Mary and Belle Marmolejo, Miss Anna
Keefe, Mies Daisy Fox. Misses Edith and
Grace King. Miss Minahan, Miss Lena Nangle

Floor committeeâ TVilllam "Wondra, W. T. Ag
gelcr. B. C. Healey, J. M. O'Keefe. The chair
man of the decorative committee waa Miss
Mary McDonald.
Dancing concluded the entertainment
or the evening.
There is still fierce rivalry among the
candidates for the grand presidency. The
general feeling of the delegates is against
Glldea. but unless Hasklns and Klerce
heal the breach between them he will un
doubtedly be the successful standard
bearer.
SICK LIST IN PORTO
RICO IS INCREASING
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 30.â The
yacht May, which arrived in this city
to-day from Porto Rico via Newport
News, brought the report of the repre
sentatives of the National Relief Com
missionâex-Mlnister to Italy William
Potter, William Van Rensselaer Louis
C. Vanuxem and Dr. G. G. Graffâ who
went to Porto Rico to superintend the
distribution of the supplies sent to the
sick soldiers by the commission. The
May, which was loaned to the Govern
ment by Mr. Van Rensselaer left this
city on August 6 and reached Ponce
Porto Rico, August. Following in the
report :
In almost every instance we found the
a u my .s. su rgeons most anxious to have at
their disposition money for the purchase
of needed luxuries for the sick, such as
fresh milk, ice (when obtainable) and
canned goods, and we are happy to re
port that in every rase we have been able
to meet the demands made upon us
There are about 16.000 American soldiers
in Porto Hico, and on the day of our de
parture, August 22, there were over 1000
men on the eiclt list. Of this numbtr one
half were cases requiring prompt and
careful treatment. There was"* a large
number of typhoid cases, but on the 224
inst. this disease was not on the increase
a fact which Indicated that the malady
had been carried from the camps at home
and is not indigenous to Porto Rico How
ever, there was a very large Increase in
diarrhea, dysentery, dengue or break
bone fever and malarial disorders due to
the hot, unhealthy rainy season Just com
mencing, which causes the water supply
to be filled with malarial germs from the
constantly decaying vegetation.
All medical authorities with the army in
Porto Rico agree that the sick list is in
creasing and that an alarming condition
may be expected unless the War Depart
ment promptly arranges barracks for the
army of occupation and Immediately pro
vides additional transports (the hospital
ship Relief being insufficient) to remove
such of the sick men as can be safely
transferred home, the convalescents and
those enervated by climatic changes. It
Is impossible for men from a northern
climate to recuperate in a tropical coun
try during its most unhealthful season.
fn conclusion, we are glad to report that
we reached Porto Rico with our medical
and hospital supplies Just at the time
when they were most needed.
Attached to the report is a letter
from General Miles thanking the com
missioners on behalf of the army for
the supplies and for a big consignment
of American flags; also a letter from
Colonel Greenleaf expressing thanks
/or the gift of an lce*making machine.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Augr. 30.â A Camp Al
ger (Va.) special to the Herald says:
Surgeons In charge of the Division
Hospital at Camp Alger are now pre
paring their monthly report on the con
dition of the hospital. The report will
show an alarming increase of sickness
over the previous month. During the
four months of its existence the hos
pital has treated 2131 patients, of
which almost one-half were received
within the last thirty days. On the
records typhoid intermittent fever and
rheumatism appear again and again.
Rheumatism in its various forms has
attacked thousands of young men. The
men were never taken to the hospital,
but lay sick in regimental quarters or
in their open tents and were reported
"sick in quarters."
If a complete list of those who have
suffered from ailments from which they
may never fully recover were made
perhaps more than half of the privates
in the camp would be included. The
rheumatic troubles have been caused
by the long stay in one of the lowest
plats of ground in all Virginia, where
thick fogs at night hang over loamy
soil that is never dry. Men once
stricken with this ailment are subject
to intermittent attacks all the rest of
their lives.
CAMP WIKOFF WORSE
THAN CHICKAIViAUGA
Dr. Senn Says It Will . Be a Horrible
Plague Spot Unless Broken
Up in Six Weeks.
NEW YORK, Aug. 30.â Medical offi
cers at Camp Wikoff, Montauk Point,
deny there have been deaths at the
camp hospital from yellow fever. The
two men, whose death here yesterday
! was said to be attributable to the dls
i ease named, were, according to the sur
geons in charge, victims of pernicious
malarial fever, which those unfamiliar
with yellow fever frequently diagnose
as the latter. Dr. Nicholas Senn, assist
ant surgeon general, U. 3. A., is quoted
as saying to-day at Camp Wikoff:
"In justice to the camp, I want to say
that almost none of the sickness among
j the soldiers up to the present time and
none of the deaths have been due to
the conditions which now prevail here,
â¢ or have prevailed in the past. Sickness
i has been almost entirely limited to fe
i vers contracted in the south, and the
death rate would have been much more
S than now had the men remained in the
i south instead of being brought here.
"The only sickness which can be at
tributed to this camp is dysentery, or
: lesser troubles, which may have been
> caused by the change of diet or water.
"So far none of the fevers have been
I Indigenous to the camp, but if the men
remain they will certainly be attacked
with typhoid fever. This will be due to
i the germs which they will get in the
water.
"To make this place healthy we
should have a system of drainage
which would carry away all these
germs, but to build such would cost a
large sum, owing to the extent of the
camp."
Dr. Senn was asked if he had brought
his views to the attention of the sur
geon general at Washington.
"I have not done so in regard to
Camp Wikoff," said he. "My protest
in regard to the other camps have
passed unheeded. In regard to Camp
Wikoff I have written an article em- j
bodying all my views, which was print i
ed in a medical journal over my signa
ture, and will be reported to the au
thorities in Washington. I am sure.
Then I will be asked about and empha
size my opinions. I want you to reiter
ate that unless this camp is cleared out
within six weeks it will be the worst
infected place in the TTnited States. The
soil will be permeated with typhoid fÂ»
ver and epidemics will follow. It will
be worse than It has been at any time
at Chickamauga.
In regard to that ramp I want to say
that I warned the Washington authori
ties before the soldiers were sent there
that danger would result from massing
a body of men there. I told them that
the water supply was insufficient, and
ihe Ã¼Ãe of river water would result in
William S. Howe.
typhoid fever. My protests went un
heeded. The result was shown when I
was in Porto Rico with General Miles.
Almost the first men sent him were
from Chickamauga. They were run
down and half sick when they arrived.
They were in no condition to stand the
southern climate. General Miles
noted their weakness and I told him
the cause of it. I nsked him to notify
the Washington authorities and have
the Chickamauga camp broken up.
did so at once and the evacuation of
the place followed.
"I want to say that bad as Chick
amauga was. this place will soon be
far worse. Within three weeks all the
disease contracted in Cuba will be
cured. After that there will be no sick
ness in this camp, except what is in
digenous to itâ but the death rate will
be vastly greater than It is now. The
men with sickness will die from the
typhoid fever which will inevitably fol
low. Unless this camp is broken up
within six weeks I predict that it will
be. Instead of a recuperation camp, a
horror camp worthy to rank with the
Infamous pest-holes of the Civil War."
Camp Wlkoff is to be investigated.
General Wheeler has ordered General
Adelbert Ames, chief of staff on Gen
eral Kent's staff, to conduct an investi
gation. He is given almost autocratic
powers. General Whoeler has ordered
him to get at the bottom of all the
things which have been complained of.
SICK WELL CABED FOB.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.â The sur
geon in charge of the hospital at Fort
McPherson, Atlanta, reports to the
surgeon general that tv ie 600 patients
there are being well tared for. He
has seventy-one female nurses and
p'.nty of ice. :nilk and 'other things and
a fund of $2000 to expend for anything
that may be needed. Any reports of
starving, he says, must have come from
some typhoid convalescent who was
not allowed all he wanted to eat by
surgeons' orders to prevent a serious
collapse.

OPIUM SMUGGLED
BY THE GUARDS
Startling Discovery at
San Quentin.
CONFESSION OF A CONVICT
INVOLVES AN OFFICIAL OF THE
PBISON.
Warden Hale Admits That Certain
Men Are Under Suspicion and
Several Have Been
Discharged.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUKNTIN PRISON, Aug. 30. â
The efforts of Warden Hale to discover
the persons who have been smuggling
opium Into the prison have resulted In
an Important find. It is now believed
by the authorities that only a small
quantity of the drug has been carried
through the gates by the convicts
themselves, and that the major portion
obtained by the prisoners has been
through the medium of the guards.
The facts have been ascertained from
admissions of certain of the guards.
During the last few days four con
victs were released and the tale told
by one of them shows that the red room
discovery, chronicled exclusively in
The Call, led up to the more important
one, Implicating several of the guards,
and, it is said, one omcial in a higher
position.
"When Hefferman was caught with
the opium under his pillow," said the
informant, "he tried to square himself
with the omcial by squealing and gave
the names of several guards and one
higher omcial Implicated in the smug
gling."
This talk of his has created a bitter
faction among the convicts in the Jute
mill. One of the guards admitted,
when questioned, that it was common
taJk around the prison that several
guards were under suspicion, and one
official in a higher position as well.
"I have heard on good authority," he
asserted, "that one of the suspected
men went to the warden and explained
his connection with the affair, saying
he wished to show that the stoTy about
him was untrue. The higher omcial has
been here only a short time, and in the
opinion of the boys generally should
have known better than to get into
such a mess."
"Warden Hale Is very conservative in
his admission about the affair, and
shows plainly his disappointment that
the story should have leaked out. He
had concluded his investigations.
"It is true," he said, "that certain
men are under suspicion now, and that
several have been discharged because
It was believed they had engaged in
opium smuggling, though not recently.
I cannot give any names because my
suspicions are not founded on any tan
gible evidence. I am working hard in
the matter and hope to discover the
guilty parties before long. No guard
h;m yet visited mv office to make any
explanation, and I believe the quantity
of opium now in the prison to be
small." _________________
A VERDICT OF POISONING.
LIVERMORB, Aug. 30.â The Jury Jn the
McPherson inquest which was held to
day brought in a verdict of death caused
by peptic poisoning, due to injuries re
ceived from a blow struck by a falling
load of timber. The verdict was signed
by David McDonald, Gilbert Hitton, H.
W. Morrtll. H. F. Ellis, A. J. McDonald
and William H. Bowles.
The inquest was held about noon un
der the direction of Coroner Baldwin.
Key. Mr. Hicks was called and testified
that he visited McPherson last Sunday
evening at 6:43 o'clock and found de
cedent unconscious. The minister said
that McPherson did not receive decent
treatment, that the bed on which he lay
was foul and that he saw no nurses about.
Ralph Fallon testfned as an eyewitness
that while MoPherson was unloading
lumber from a cnrt at the mines a heavy
timber fell on him. Abe Ryan gave tes
timony of a corroborative nature. Dr. H.
S. Hill of Livermore, who made an au
topsy on the dead man's body, testified
that he found a fracture of the pelvis
and an injury to the bladder. In his
opinion death was caused by septic poi
soning. Dr. Lilly, who attended Mc-
Pherson at the Tesla mine hospital, and
Dr. Jump, who was in charge of the hos
pital, were not present.
Much dissatisfaction was expressed on
account of the verdict of the Jury.
Big Blaze at Nashville.
NASHVILLE, Aug. 30.â Fire broke out
this morning in the top floor of the flve
story building of the Phillips & Buttorff
wholesale and retail hardware store on
the corner of Bank alley and Cojiege
street, and in an incredibly short time
had completely destroyed the entire build
ing and its contents. The fire spread
south across the alley to A. J. Warren &
Co.'s furniture store and destroyed that
fine four-story structure and its contents.
The loss is $300,000.

WOLFE TONE
CELEBRATION
A BIG AFFAIR
Monster Demonstra
tion in Dublin.
MANY VISITORS FROM ABROAD
GATHERED TO HONOR A HERO'S
MEMORY.
Great Procession Through the Streets,
Followed by a Magnificent
Rally at the Site of tha
Monument.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
â 7 Correspondence of The Call.
bur-LIN, Aug. lT.^The Wolfe Tone
celebration which took place on Mon
day watf unquestionably one of the
greatest demonstrations which has been
held in DU-blin consequently, in
Ireland for naany years. The only one
which can be at all compared In size
with it was that which occurred on.
the occasion of the first anniversary of
the death of Parnell. This latter was,
I think, bigger, and there was much
more. excitement about it; 'but with this
exception Monday's display was the
greatest which 1 recollect since the un
veiling of the O'Connell monument in
1875, while it had one feature which all
other demonstrations have "been with
outânamely, the participation of for
eign visitors in the proceedings. As to
these visitors a few words first. To the
agreeable surprise of us at home a good
many Irish-Americans found their way
to Dublin for the ceremonial, and,
moreover, a good many of them came
over expressly for the function. One
bishop and several Catholic priests
were present from the New England
States. This, after all, was only what
was to be expected; what was not so
natural was the presence of several
Frenchmen and Italians, who arrived
in a body on Saturday and were ac
corded a public welcome on the arrival
of the mail steamer at Kingstown. One
of these foreigners excited a particular
amount of interestâ l mean Signer Ci
priani, an Italian, who has been in no
Jess than forty pitched battles from the
time of the rising against Austrian rule
in Italy down to the last Greek war, in
which, of course, he was on the side of
the Greeks against the Turks, and in
the course of which he received a
dangerous wound in the leg. All â
Americans, French and Italians â were â 
surprised at the magnitude of Monday's ]
demonstration. The comment of the \
Frenchmen, I believe, was that, though !
they had seen more picturesque and |
better organized displays in Paris, they
had not seen a larger one in the course
of their lives or one with which there ,
seemed to be more general sympathy i
among the general population.
The proceedings of Monday com
menced early by the assembling- in
O'Connell street of the, various con-,
ttngents from the city and th,e -pro
vinces which were-to naake Up the pro
cession. All the railway lines poured
thousands into the city and each con
tingent carried a banner showing where
it' came from and was accompanied by
a band. Every man of many of the
contingents carried a pike or a battle
ax, and boom <>f those odd old-fashioned
implements were actually used in the
ftisurrection of '9S. I myself handled
ope of them and I can well imagine how ;
effective they must have been In those I
days when hand to hand encounters
were still the rule in many combats.
Among those contingents north, south,
east and west were represented, but
particularly the north and still more
particularly, strange to say, the capital
of the north. Orange Belfast. The
Mayor of Cork and other provincial
dignitaries were in attendance in their
robes and chains of office, and so were
many representative politicians who do
not occupy any elective positions. The
. city of Dublin, of course, turned out in
great force. The Lord Mayor and the
other members of the corporation were,
to use a well-worn expression, "in full
regalia." The members of the various
city trades marched after their respect
ive banners, which seemed to have
been, in many cases, specially reno
vated for the occasion. The same may
be said of such organizations as the
Foresters and kindred societies. A
prominent place in the procession was
allotted to the Irish members of Par
liament, and they went on foot imme
diately after the vehicle which con
veyed the French and Italian visitors.
. .Comparatively few of them, however,
attended. The Parnellites, who are the
smallest section, were pretty fully rep
resented; but of the Dillonites only Mr
Dillon himself and nine or ten of his I
followers were in the procession. T. M !
Healy was not In the procession, but
it must be added that he was in the
crowd and that he sent a subscription
of Â£10 to the fund for the statue to
Wolfe Tone.
The route of the procession was un
usual, for it went through the old
quarter of Dublin, which is now given
up to the poorer classes. But the rea
son for this departure from precedent
was plain enough. The streets through
which the procession marched were
those in which many of the most mem
orable events and incidents of 1898 oc
curred. Wolfe Tone himself, for in
stance, was born in a street which
though a leading quarter of the city
100 years ago, is now a back street
Emmet was executed in Thomas street
which, still a leading business street, is
not one of the show streets. The same
may be said of the street in which the
home is situated of the yeomen who
took in Tone's body after his alleged
suicide. But there was one advantage
gained by resorting to this unaccus
tomed route. It showed much more
than could otherwise have been done
how the mass of the population sym
pathized with the demonstration and
its effect. The working class and mid
dle shopkeeping classes of all the
streets to which I have referred crowd
ed the windows all along the route
waved their handkerchiefs and cheered
bo that the welkin rang. When the
procession emerged into Dame street
and Grafton street, supposed to be
loyalist quarters, the windows and
balconies were crowded, too, but a
good many who filled them were, of
course, only spectators. The thou
. sands, however, which lined even those
streets were Nationalist, and they
made the fact known by the cheers
with which they greeted every portion
of the procession.
Tt was pretty late in the evening
â¢when all were assembled at the. site of
the Wolfe Tone monument, but' lt was
a really magnificent spectacle when the
vast concourse had gathered together
to listen to the speeches which were
delivered from the platform erected on
the spot. On that platform many
reDreeentatlve men of all sections of

the Nationalist party occupied places, I
together with the more prominent of |
the visitors, but the leading figure was
tlw venerable John O'Leary, the Fen
lan leader. In 1865 he was one of the
lea dins spirits of the Fenian organiza
tion and soon after was condemned to
a long term of penal servitude which
he gallantly went through, fiut. though
aged to-day, he is still unchanged, and
he was deservedly the object of en
thusiastic popular admiration. He
opened the proceedings with a charac
teristic speech, and he was followed
by Mr. John Dillon. M. P. Mr. John
ltt-iiinond, M. P., the Lord Mayor of
Dublin, and some of the visitors,
among whom were two or three Amer
icans. I need not dwell on thn.Â«e
speeches. To Englishmen who think
that the new local government act is
going to solve the Irifh difficulty they
must be infinitely disagreeable and
disa-ppointing. But they can bo so only
to persons who take an utterly wrong
view of the Irish question. That ques
tion Is simply a question of whether
Ireland is to have national liberty at
not. An Independent Irish Legislature
may be its solvent; but nothing else
can be except absolute independence.
The day wound up with a banquet
given by the Lord Mayor in the Man
sion House, to which all the foreign
visitors and all the prominent parson
ages in the day's proceedings were in
vited. It was a splendid entertain
ment, and here again England might
have heard things said calculn.t'-'l to
open her ey^s as to the real situation
in this country. Altogether, the day
was a memorable one in Nationalist
annals, and especially In the National
ist annals of Dublin.

SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Aug. 30.â
Enthusiastic scenes were witnessed
when the United States warship New
Orleans, the first American vessel en
tering the harbor of San Juan since
the war with Spain began, came into
port and anchored near the English
cable ship. This arrival of the New
Orleans was rather unexpected and
created considerable excitement, when
the vessel entered the harbor at slow
speed, the stars and stripes flying from
the forepeak and sounding lines being
constantly in use.
Along the walls of Morro Castle
Spanish soldiers formed in a solid
mass, while great crowds of citizens
swarmed on the housetops and along
the wharves, eagerly watching the ad
vance of the American vessel.
After the New Orleans had dropped
anchor her commander came ashore at
once to pay his respects to Captain
General Maclas. He was met at the
wharf by an immense crowd.

Special Dispatch to The Coll.
SEATTLE. Aug. 30.â Dr. Sheldon
Jackson, general agent of education in
Alaska, returned from the north on the
steamship Koanoke. He brings the
news of the loss of the whaler Rosa
1 rio, on the east side of Point Barrow,
about July 10.
But meager information is available
as to the manner in which the Kosario
was crushed out of existence by the
terrific ice pack of the Arctic. When
the steamship Del Norte, with Dr.
Jackson aboard, put into Port Clar
ence on August 6, the whaler Belve
dere waa in the port. She, had escaped
from the frozen waters of the north
and was taking on coal and supplies
preparatory to again going into the
neighborhood of Point Barrow to en
gage in whaling during the present
open season. The Belvedere crew told
of the crushing of the Kosario, but
thought that no lives had been lost.
They were unable \o give particulars
or Dr. Jackson failed to obtain them.
However, they expressed the belief
that all the other whaling vessels would
have a safe deliverance and spend the
open season in the Arctic before re
turning to San Francisco.
When Captain Tuttle, with the reve
nue cutter Bear, left Port Clarence the
latter part of July, he expressed the
belief that he would get to Point Bar
row, take on board impoverished and
sick sailors and return by August 15.
Nothing, however, has been heard
from him up to August 19, at which
time the Del Norte again put into
Port Clarence, en route to St. Michael.
The Kosario was one of the impris
oned whalers for whose relief the ex
pedition recently went northward from
this port. The vessel was owned in
this city by J. D. Spreckels & Bros. Co.,
Sheldon, the Arctic Oil Works and
others being interested in the craft.
For a number of years the Rosario
had been engaged In whaling, sailing
out of this port, and it was very well
known along this coast.
The Rosario was built at San Fran
cisco In 1878. She was a vessel of 141.25
net tonnage.
The Rosario was in command of
Captain E. Coffin, a competent naviga

Special Dlaratch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 30.â General Weyler,
according to a special dispatch from
Madrid, published here to-day, has
outlined his future policy. Hj prc
poses, it appears, to be Independent of
bcth the Government and at th* oppo
sition, "always aiming t,i preserve the
counjrx and to reorganize the army."
He expresses the belief that the Car
lists have plenty of money, some of
which, he alleges, comes from France.
Â£!â¢â  says that the Republicans have no
personal animus against the Queen,
their only object being to adopt a firm
international stand, "one result of
which would be to check in some meas
ure England's ambition."
Weyler's statement was made to a
committee of the Weylerites who called
on him this morning at Palma Majo
rica. He expects to speak this even
ing before a club convention. It is
reported that the general is returning
to politics in response to many appeals
from Spain and abroad, and it Is added
that he will attend the sessions of the
Cortes and expound his views as to the
causes of the war disasters.
The. substance of Weyler's declara
tion to the delegation of the Weyler
Club is as follows:
The general intends to advocate a
sweeping policy of rehabilitation of the
Government. He will refuse to aid
in any temporary measures and will
propose a military dictatorship for the
reorganization of the army and navy.
Their honor, he remarked, had been
lost, as well as the Antilles, owing sole
ly to military deficiencies.
General Weyler expressed the belief
that the present Cabinet would be suc
ceeded by a military dictatorship or
by a Silvela Ministry. He added he did
not desire a change in the form of
Government, but he pointed out that
the Carlists had an excellent organi
zation. Continuing, the former cap
tain general of Cuba urged Spain to
abandon her attitude of international
neutrality in order to be prepared to
oppose Great Britain when the latter,
desiring to enlarge her sphere of ac
tion at Gibraltar, demanded the Sierra
Carbonera, Melllla or other adjacent
Spanish possessions. The general
deemed it better to lost the Philip
pines, the importance of which he did
not appreciate, than the territory
around Gibraltar. In conclusion, he
deplored the loss of the Antilles for
the sake of the Spaniards who resided
in the Islands and also for the sake of
the country's commerce.

to send troops to suppress the rebellion
in Hai Nan and protect the American
missionaries, the United States Consul
at Canton has made strong representa
tions to the acting Viceroy, demanding
the prompt suppression of the general
disturbances.
The unrest appears to have been fo
mented by the Triad and White Lily
societies, which have combined for
that purpose.
PROTECTION" AT SAN JOSE,
Prohibitive License Imposed Upon
Non-Resident Hackmen.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 30.â The City Council
this morning passed an ordinance Impos
ing a license of $100 per month upon all
hackmen not residents of the city. This
was done to prevent San Francisco hack
men coming down here to the Admission
day celebration of the Native Sons and
competing with the local Jehus. Hack
men here have promised not to advance
their rates on the occasion.
An ordinance was adopted fixing the
amount nore. u sary to be raised by taxes
for the next ttsoal.year at $202,509 45. The
rate has not yet beon decided upon.
The Council decided to wtthhold $17,000
due Contractor Byron on the new High
School until the builder and his creditors
have come to some settlement.

Well Pleased With His
Southern Trip.
SOME POLITICAL HISTORY
DENOUNCED THE LEADERS OF
THE PARTY.
Considered His Self -Respect Jeopard
ized by Association With the
' Ken He Now Asks for
Support.
Judpe Maguire returned from Los An
geles'yesterday. He expresses himself as
well pleased with the result of his south
ern trip and declares that he found the
. utmost enthusiasm among the Demo
cratic workers In I-os Anpeles County.
During the day Judge Magutre was oc
cupKKl In consulting hi? political friends
concerning the personnel of the executive
committee of the State Central Com
mittee. Late In the afternoon he an
â¢nbunced that the list of names was not
yet complete, but that enough selections
had been made to justify the statement
â¢:tha.t the entire li?t will be complete by
to-morrow and that it will be made public
â¢ ;at; that time. He refused to discuss the
matter of the chairmanship of the rom
' mittee, but said that the names of Seth
Ma an. C. C. Wright and Robert M. Fitz
. â -.â gerald were being considered. Since hie
return much pressure has been brought
to bear on the Democratic nominee for
: Governor to Induce him to surrender his
plan of putting Seth Mann at the head of
: the committee, it being asserted that such
. action would not be to the best Interests
of the party. The statement that other
. v names are being considered is taken as a
partial assurance that this advice has
'-: had" some weight. His advisers are doing
â  ' .everything within their power to smooth
â¢'." <)v'er the rough places In their candidate's
â¢past- political history.
â  ..'â When Judge Maguire withdrew from
'-. \t"be. Democratic party in IBS 7he took oc
! ea&ion- to pay his compliments to the
â¢. ;i'arty and to all of Its members who had i
; .;. iiat. at a previous State convention, In- !
-.doraed his single-tax heresies. Among j
V other things he said:
â ''â 'â "/La a self-respecting man I would feel
...justified and bound in honor to withdraw
. from a party which has fallen to such
â¢'â¢levels; but there is another and potent
â¢ reason for my withdrawal, which is that
:â¢ anew national party is being formed for
.-.; t.he purpose of restoring the natural
Rights of the great landless democracy of
. :' America."
;. . -in ..other words, Maguire withdrew from
â¢â¢â¢â ; th>-- party because he believed that he
'could ho longer associate with its leaders
..â¢and' retain his self-respect, and for the
. j' additional reasun that he wished to join
: a band of mildiy insane dreamers who
widhed to supnort the Government by
; .taxing the land-ownerâ that Is to say the j
â ;. farmerâ and allow the corporations to go j
. ;.free.
'â¢'â¢. '.Tne State convention, the acts of which
.' so Incensed Maguire as to cause him to
â .: denounce its members as unfit for the
â¢ company of self-respecting men. waa j

Maguire now seeks the support of these
men, though he is aware that ttfey still
â¢ hold to the same views that colored their
; political acts in 1887. This is somewhat
remarkable In view of the fact that he I
ha.i publicly declared within the past few 'â 
weeivs that he still maintains the views
â  that "prompted the utterances made :

his duty to do all that he can to cause!
..the owner of a farm to pay all of the
.-â taxes, - while the owner or a railroad is
â  ' exempted-. In. the face of all this he has
'. -this to say of the Democratic party:
. "Wealth is still the standard of re-!
' .spectability, just as it was under the
. Republican administration, and the 1
rights and wishes of the great Demo- !
cratic masses of the country are just as
completely ignored. Rival bidders for the i
affections of monopolists, the great na- i
ti'>nal parties' have become like as two
â peaÃ, both in action and principles."
After referring to the acquirement of â 
land by aliens, Maguire has a few more â 
pertinent remarks to make regarding the :
standing, of the Democratic party. He;
sa-ys:
"This is a system of human servitude |
just as cqrhpiete as chattel slavery and
In many respects more atrocious; yet
tiw so-called Democratic party, while j
claiming to be the friend of the laborer, j
expressly defends this system and bids
for the support of those who profit by |
it."
And now Mr. Maguire is bidding for
the support of the party which he ac- j
â  cusps of bidding for the support of mo
nopollea and alien land-owners. It is a '
situation somewhat puzzling to the j
. mind of the average voter.
He !; ; also bidding for the support of i
tho Populists, but In this case the worm !
has already turned. The Populists are i
crying out that they were bunkoed into \
0 fusion agreement by a few office-seek- 1
ers Â«vho had secured temporary control j
of their party organization. The posi
tion In which the party Is placed by the
fusion agreement Is thus set forth by 1
J. V. Wetetfer, who Is the recognized i
- lr>ad< r of the party in this State:
"â¢'Here you have the whole situation In!
a nutshell â equal to a declaration by the !
Democrats, saying:, 'If you-plnk-of-per- j
fi ctfon Pops want to come into the Dem- j
ocxatlc party, g^t down on your bellies j
nnd crawl In, then we'll do what we
c with you afterward.' "
A. I). Dunn, editor of the Advocate, a
recognized Populist organ, adds his tes
timony to tho Kwr-lllngr tide of Indigna- J
.'tion against the acts nnd motives of the j
. so-ralled roforim-d Democracy. Ho says:
"The redeemers fire a non-blushing set!
â¢ of Bhysters, and instead of allowing a
fair criticism of their political records,
expect to carry the State by storm by
howling redemption. Long live Buckley!
Uwk live McNab. Ions: live the stinkpots

The Maguire - Gallagherites Carry
Through Their Programme
Without the Least Show
of Opposition.
The clan Magutre-Gallagher-Hutchlnson
wing of the Popo-Democratlc party met
last night and indorsed a part of the
"slate work" carried through at Sacra
mento. The programme was carried out
without a hitch. The first number was
the Indorsement of James H. Barry, who
accepted the nomination for Congress
from the Fourth District, after "Whis
pering" Gavin McNab refused to accept
the "honor." McNab was nominated as a
matter of "vindication." then he declined
and Barry stepped over the "vindication
to take the place on the ticket. Barry
believes that he is the logical candidate to
succeed Congressman Magulre, who heads
the kangaroo ticket for Governor.
J. Placehunter Dunn, chairman of the
self-appointed committee of one hundred
and nominee for member of the Board of
Equalization from the First District,
was "unanimously" nominated. In order
I that he might not be uncertain as to his
i nomination, a committee was appointed
| to notify him that the Populists who are
i lighting the "middle-of-the-road men
: are going to make "a fight" for the for
| mer "watchdog of the treasury- The
farcical proceedings came to an end,
when William M. Hinton was "unani
mously nominated" for member of the
Railroad Commission from the Second
District. He will be "officially" notified
i to-day that there was no "break" In the
i slate. It will be cheering news to Hin
i ton to know that the Populists have in
dorsed him in his candidacy, and at the
call of "time" he will be found on hand.
The Democrats of the Thirty-first As
| sembly District met at Trades Hall, Mis
sion street, near Eighth, last night and
I organized a Maguire Club, 115 signing the

HEIRS TO CONTEST
ADOLPH SUTfiO'S WILL
A THREE-CORNEIIED BATTLE
NOW ON.
Four of the Children of the Dead
Millionaire Attack the Validity
of the Document Filed.
The will of Adolph Sutro was not ad
mitted to probate yesterday as was ex
pected. The way of the will is not as
smooth as desired by many of the lega
tt--s, and four of the children of the de
ceased capitalist promise to make It ex
tremely rocky. If, Indeed, they do not
completely side-track it and leave the es
tate to be disposed of in a manner entire
ly different than was desired by the ac
cumulator of the. property.
When the case was called yesterday
morning In Judge Coffey's court Attorneys
Garret McEnerney and Charles S. Wheel
er moved for a continuance. They repre
sent Mrs. Rosa V. Morblo, Mrs. Kate
Neusbaum. Edgar E. Sutro and Miss
Clara Sutro, who have decided to contest
the will. They claim that under recent
decisions of the Supreme Court the trust
will is invalid and they will also resist
payment of several bequests to brothers,
sisters and nieces of the deceased.
Furthermore they Intend to contest the
claims of Mrs. Kluge, who claims to be
the widow of the testator.
When the attorneys representing the
dissatisfied heirs asked for a continuance
ReubÂ»n H. Lloyd, representing the exec
utors of the estate named in the will, ob
jected to a continuance longer than one
week. This was satisfactory to all con
cerned and the matter of the application
to admit the will to probate went over un
til the 6th inst. Then by consent the
consideration of the question of special
letters of administration was deferred un
til Thursday.
There is now a three-cornered legal bat
tle to be fought over the will of the dead
millionaire, provided Mrs. Kluge stays in
âa condition Mr. McEnerney seemed
to doubt last night in discussing the
case. He said, however, that t.e knew of
nothing that had been said or done by
any or the parties looking to a compro
mise of the claims that Mrs. Kluge may
have. Nor was there any action of com
promise undertaken on behalf of tne con
testants represented by Mr. Wheeler and
himself. But if Mrs. Kluge does persist
in her claim that she Is entitled to sub
stantial recognition of her children her
claim, as we.ll as the claim of the execu
tors of the will, Is to be attacked, as well
as the trusts and the bequests maae to
the brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces
of the testator, amounting to a half mil
lion dollars.
While Mrs. Dr. Emma Merrltt and
Charles Sutro are apparently on good
terms with the four contesting heirs they
could not well have joined In the contest
since Mrs. Merrltt is one of the executors,
and there could have been no contest had
she not offered the will for probate. Mrs.
Kluge is said to look upon this new ele
ment in the case as an effort to block her
progress in making good her claims.
JUMPED TO DEATH
WHILE DELIROUS
DAVID COBLENTZ, A SOLDIER,
SPRINGS FROM A WINDOW.
Had Been Suffering From Typhoid
and Was Taken Home Sun
day for Treatment.
David Coblentz. a member of the field
hospital corps, stationed at the Presidio,
Jumped from the- window of his home at
Page and Broderick streets last night to
the sidewalk. He fell about fifty feet and
was picked up unconscious. He was car
ried into the house, where he died a few
mlnuteh later.
Coblentz. was taken sick with typhoid
fever about a week ago, and his parents
obtained a permit to have him taken
home for treatment. When he was moved
last Sunday he was in a high fever, but
the next day he showed signs of improve
ment and hopes were held of his ultimate
recovery.
Last night he seemed resting easier
than ever, and the watchers withdrew for
rest leaving him In the care of a nurse.
At about 10 o'clock he became violent,
but the nurse, managed to quiet him down.
In a few minutes the delirium seized him
again and he sprang out of bed. Tho
nurse a plucky little woman, Beized him
and cried loudly for help, but her efforts
â¢were unavailing 1 against the feverish
strength of the young soldier, who sprang
to a balcony, dragging her with him. He
would have carried her to death with him
had It not been that his mother arrived
and grasped the nurse just as Coblentz
sprang to the ground. He struck on his
back, fracturing his skull.
The deceased was 21 years of agre and
the son of Felix Coblentz, a prominent
wholesale liquor dealer.

THINKS HIS
PARTY WAS
BETRAYED
A Prominent Populist
Makes Protest.
A SACRIFICE OF PRINCIPLE
BELIEVES IN OPPOSING THE
DEMOCRATS.
Refused a Fusion Nomination. Be
cause an Acceptance Would
Mean Surrender of Self-
Beepect.
The manner In which the conscientious
Populists of the State look upon the
fusion arrangement by which their party
wu sold out to the Democrats through
the manipulations of a tevt men who were
seeking office and were determined to
have it at any price Is illustrated by the
following statement from one of the most
prominent and most respected Populists
In the State:
Editor Call: I have been asked by some
of the friends of Hon. C. A. Barlow why
I cast my lot with the middle-of-the-road
or straight Populists at Sacramento, and
why I accepted their nomination for Con
gress in the Sixth District against the
said C. A. Barlow, the incumbent, who
was elected as a Populist two years ago.
As there may be others who would like to
know, a few of my reasons will be given
la the following article:
It is deemed a sacred right belonging to
every man, no matter to what political
party he may belong, to oppose by every
honorable means at his command every
other political party, and It is the duty of
eWBiJ party to sustain its members in the
exercise of this right.
No action had by any convention or
party trenching upon this right can bind
its individual members without their con
sent, even though such action be sanc
tioned by a majority of such convention
or party.
This right from the very nature of
things is Inherent in the Individual, and is
not subject to majority rules. It is so
sacred that any Infringement upon it by
any party convention, no matter by what
majority thereof, Is in derogation of the
spirit and policy of our Government and
subversive of every principle of political
ethics and public morals.
The convention held at Los Angeles Oc
tober 22, 1891, which first organized the
People's party in the State of California,
and in which I participated, guaranteed
to every man who should become a mem
ber a free and unlncumbered political
home, free rum the domination or in
fluence of the old parties, both of which
were by this as well as by all subsequent
People's party conventions most ve
hemently denounced as being antagonistic
to the best interests of the common peo
ple of this commonwealth and unworthy
of public confidence. The People's party
was built up under this guarantee, and
under this opposition to the dishonored
old parties. Any disregard or sacrifice of
this principle by any faction of the Peo
ple's party should be considered by its
loyal members as an abandonment of its
organization and a sacrifice of its princi
plesâa boltâ and I believe any court of
justice would so hold.
Fusion as consummated at Sacramento
by a domineering faction of the People's
party was theoretically, practically and
to all intents and purposes a surrender
of the party and its principles to the
Democratic party, and I, a Populist, could
not and would not become a party to such
action, preferring to stand with my own
party and nominate a regular, straight,
middle-of-the-road People's party ticket
as distinguished from the fusion ticket.
This convention was pleased to tender
me the nomination for Congress for the
Sixth District. I accepted. I would have
declined and gladly have presented the
name of the said Hon. C. A. Barlow had
he remained loyal to the People's party
and its principles, but it was my under
standing then, and It still is. that he had
measurably abandoned both party and
principle.
It is a principle of Populism incorpo
rated in both our National and State
platforms that office holders shall not
participate in making such platforms, in
shaping our party policy, nor In any way
manipulating nominating conventions.
Mr. Barlow unquestionably used, ac
tively, his personal and official influence
to bring about a fusion between the Popu
list and Democratic parties, thereby deny
ing to every conscientious Populist his
guaranteed right to oppose the Demo
cratic party or brand him as a bolter for
so doing.
Mr. Barlow accepted an appointment as
a member of the National Congressional
Committee for the State of California-
Mr. Barlow participated in holding con
ferences with the officers of other politi
cal parties while In Congress.
Mr. Barlow has be,en publicly charged,
and it has not been denied so far aa I
know, with having participated with oth
ers in issuing an address advising Popu
lists to unite with the Democrats on a
platform other than any heretofore adopt
ed by any National or State People's Par
ty Convention.
Mr. Barlow participated in the meeting
of the National committee of the Peo
ple's party at Omaha in June of this year,
all of which is in flagrant violation of the
principles of the party that honored him
with a seat in Congress. By these acts
the servant has sought to become the
master.
I do not Impugn Mr. Barlow's honesty,
his Intentions may have been good all
through, but no amount of good Inten
tions will suffice to cover up or counteract
the Injurious effects of his abandonment
of principle.
Mr. Barlow cannot plead In extenua
tion a lack of knowledge on the subject,
for such Ignorance would be fatal, nor is
the fact that others have been guilty of
the same errors any defense in his case.
The fundamental principles relative to
the inherent and guaranteed rights of
members of the People's party are of
vital importance and are necessarily in
volved in the question of fusion, some lit
tle skimming editors, whq never get be
low the surface of any subject they
aspire to treat, to the contrary notwith
standing.
If a political party desires to disband
It has the unquestioned right to do so,
but no party has the right or the power
to commit its members to the support of
any other party. Such right belongs to
the individual member and to him alone
and cannot be honestly delegated or sur
rendered.
I say to my People's party brethren of
this State, if you would have People's
party principles prevail, you must stand
firmly by the party and jealously guard
the principles upon which it is founded,
until they triump throughout the land.
Keep forever in your mind these factÃ
and axioms: The solving of new problems
requires new forces; no party having once
become corrupt can ever become a true
reform partyâ it has not the power, if it
would, to purify itself; reforms must
come, if at all, from a new organization
free from such dominant and corrupting
influences as now handicap both the old
parties.
For the People's party to fuse with an
old party at this time is destructive to
its existence. Every Populist leader, in
cluding my friend. Mr. Barlow, have all
along said that the Democratic party is
a party of pledge breakers and spoilsmen,
corrupt to the core. For us Populists now
to combine or fuse with it for purposes of
reform would be stultifying ourselves and
placing our party in the same category
with the disreputable old parties.
The world would say and justly, too.
that we were insincere, that we were
frauds that our pretentions of reform
were deceptions, our opposition to the old
parties and their practices is a sham, a
delusion and a snare, that we were false
to our own teaching and were after office
and pelf only.
It must be apparent to all observing
men that fusion is based solely upon local
and Individual selfishnessâ a basis upon
which no party can stand or ought to
long survive.

FUSION MAY
BE FAVORED
Alameda Populists Will
Meet This Evening.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 30.
The County Central Committee of the
People's party will meet to-morrow night,
and the most prominent question before
it will be that of making an indepenuent
campaign or fusing with the Democrats.
Opinion is not unanimous and there are
those who hold up the horrible example
of fusion two years ago as a reason why
it should not be again attempted.
It is probable that at the meeting: a
committee will be appointed to sound the
Democrats on the subject, so as to get a
basis upon which tp outline tho county
campaign.
Just three weeks from to-day the Re
publicans will meeet in this city to name
a complete county and legislative ticket.
Next Saturday the County Central Com
mittee will meet to decide the method
of calling the convention and of electing
the delegates.
There Is just a suspicion that many
plans will be upset at this meeting. All
the politicians of the old school have
been laying their plans on a supposition
that the ward and township plans will be
followed. Some members of the County
Committee are in favor of following the
plan of electing from Assembly districts,
such as was followed at the last two
primaries. Should this be done it will
mean a complete split-up of the present
political lines and would on the whole be
a good thing for the party. It is not
known how the County Committee stands
in point of numbers on this subject. It is
said that of the thirteen members six fa
vor one plan, six another, while the odd
member is in doubt.
A quiet little scheme Is being worked
to put to the test the sincerity of Justice
Wood. A few weeks ago Judge Wood de
clared that his office was unnecessary,
that the salary paid mm 13 wasted and
that it should be abolished. He also de
clared that it would be no use In his
resigning, because the Supervisors would
undoubtedly elect some one else to the
vacancy. The proposition now is to in
duce the Supervisors to pass a resolution
declaring that should Judge Wood resign
they would not appoint any one to the
place Two Supervisors have already ex
pressed their approval of this plan, and
if a third vote can be obtained the reso
lution will undoubtedly pass, after which
it is presumed tne Justice will resign.
A rumor was circulated last night that
Councilman H. B. Rowe of the Seventh
Ward would come out as a dark horse
against Frank Jordan for the nomina
tion for County Clerk. Mr. Rowe denied
this to-day, and said that he is not seek
ing a county nomination. It Is generally
understood that Mr. Rowe will not re
fuse the nomination for Mayor next
spring, should the opportunity to accept
it be presented.
There will be 297 delegates to the county
convention made up as follows: First
Ward. 19; Second Ward. 24; Third Ward.
22; Fourth Ward, 21; Fifth Ward, 17; Sixth
Ward, 16; Seventh Ward. 26; Brooklyn

Other candidates are being heard from
in different parts of the city. Dr. W. 11.
Blood of West Oakland is now making
a strong fight for the nomination for Cor
oner. Dr. Blood has for some years been
prominent in politics, and is able to put
up an effective campaign.
John F. Teague, who has held office In
the past, would like to be the Assembly
man from the Forty-ninth District.
Teague has lived in that district thirty
eight years, and whenever he has run
for office has always landed three or four
hundred votes ahead of his ticket. He
thinks these facts justify him in want
ing to be a law-maker.
George Frick of the Second Ward is
now in the field for County Superintend
ent of Schools. P. M. Fisher, also in this
ward, wants the same nomination, which
is likewise desired by aspirants in many
other parts of the county. One of the
politicians on the inside said to-day that
either the Public Administrator or tho
Superintendent of Schools would have to
come from the interior of the county.

HEARST'S MONUMENTAL ASSURANCE
SEVERAL days ago there seemed to be neces
sity for asking for an accounting of certain
money being collected for Mr. Hearst by
means of a pyrotechnic show. What Hearst may do
as a private citizen is his own business, but when he
asks the public to patronize his show, using the plea
that a part of the profits are to go to the erection of
a monument to the men of the Maine, the public de
mands particulars. That the monument if ever reared
will be to the glory of Hearst, with the valiant dead
of the Maine secondary or overlooked, is not a point
to be discussed here. The chief question now is as to
how much money is being contributed and what
share is to be devoted to the proclaimed purpose.
Confidence in the enterprises of Hearst is at rather
a low ebb and needs bracing up. There is still lively
recollection of the "charity" baseball tournament,
from which charity fattened in so slight degree that
the whole scheme won the reputation of being a fake.
Such it undoubtedly was. It is remembered also
that the beauty of the monument project has already
been marred by the publicity given to the fact that
solicitors were promised 10 per cent of all they could
collect of spontaneous offerings. Thus Hearst need
not be surprised that when people are besought to
attend a show in order to raise funds for his pet ad
vertising dodge the} r want to know all about it.
There are a few interrogatories which might be
projected into the situation, for instance:
What were the receipts of the show?
What share is to be applied to the monument?
How. much was charged for the pages of advertis
ing the Examiner contained setting forth the beauty
of the exhibition and the loveliness of patronizing it?
Will the cost of this advertising come out of the
monument's share?
Of course these questions might seem to the care
less observer to be an interference with personal mat
ters, but it must not be forgotten that appeal was
made on the ground of patriotism, and for a purpose
concerning every citizen. It is a public affair, the
money pertaining to it is public money, and the peo
ple who supply it have a right to know what is being
done with it.
THE LORDSHIP OF THE PACIFIC.
SENATOR CUSHMAN K. DAVIS in a re
cent interview on the problems that have
arisen out of the conquest of the Philippines
pointed out with great force and vigor the growing
importance in the world of the countries surround
ing the Pacific Ocean, and emphasized the impera
tive need of special efforts on our part to uphold our
rightful prestige and obtain our due share of their
trade.
As a means of accomplishing these desirable ends
he is reported to have said: "You may quote me
just as strongly as you can as saying: More battle
ships, and after that more cruisers, and then more
battleships again. The men to man them will step
forward as fast as we can build the ships."
With this plea for an enlarged navy there would
be little objection found if the Senator had gone
further and demanded also ships for other purposes
than that of fighting. The lordship of the Pacific is
not going to be determined solely by the battleships
that float upon its waters. Commerce is already a
greater power than war, and its superiority will in
crease with the years. The people who hope to win
a portion of the rich reward that is to follow the de
velopment of the Pacific Ocean countries must have
a mercantile marine as well as a navy. Senator Davis
should have declared not only for more battleships
and more cruisers, but for merchant steamers and
sailing vessels.
There would be a greater advantage to us in a
system of legislation that would promote, protect and
advance our shipping interest than in a policy of an
nexing the Philippines and dominating the recalci
trant inhabitants with warships. Commerce is the
civilizer of the world, the promoter of industry and
the giver of dominion. If Congress will provide
for the shipbuilders of this country anything like the
help that is given to those of Germany and Great
Britain by their Governments, the lordship of the
Pacific will be won by the profitable energies of trade
more surely than by the wasteful forces of war.
Secretary Alger is reported as being in a defiant
mood, and it is not easy to see how he could be in
any other. Either he has been shamefully lied about
or he is guilty of unexampled military malpractice.
In either case circumstances demand that he put on a
bold front.
Those brotherly love remarks of the Czar might
have been kept awhile and appropriately launched un
der the date of April i.
At the same time Germany has everything her way
in Samoa she will be ceded a part of Goat Island as
a coaling station.
GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF RAIL
WAYS.
THROUGHOUT most of its longitude the
fusion platform demands Government owner
ship of railroads, and much of its length is de
voted to demanding, also, Government ownership of
other business enterprises, the net effect of which
would be to put the Government in control, as an
employer, of a majority of the business of the
country.
The argument for all this departure from the past
ways of the republic is the cost of transportation.
Mr. Bryan in his speech accepting the Presidential
nomination in 1896 said that all prices had declined
except railroad rates. That declaration seems to
have been the beginning of the present demand for
Government ownership of railways. In the recent
Democratic-Populist convention of Nebraska Senator
Allen gave loud and long voice to this demand. As
it is made and put in issue in current politics, its
basis, the reason given for it, should be calmly ex
amined.
At the outset of such examination it is seen that
Mr. Bryan's statement had no foundation in fact.
Whatever fault may be found with present rates, it is
not true that they are the rates of the past.
In 1852 the Pennsylvania Railroad received 376
cents per ton per mile. In 1895 it received only .56
of a cent per ton per mile.
The report of the Interstate Commeice Commis
sion shows the average rate for freight and passen
ger transportation in the United States to have de
clined as follows in the eight years from 1888 to 1896:
1888â Fares, 2.349 cents per mile.
1888 â Freights, 1.001 cents per ton per mile.
1896â Fares, 2.019 cents per mile.
1896 â Freights, .806 cent per ton per mile.
Between 1870 and 1895 freight rates on all roads in
the United States fell 80 per cent and passenger rates
fell 46 per cent During the same period wheat, corn,
cotton, oats, barley, hemp and tobacco fell an average
of 7.2 per cent; food fell 12.3 per cent and clothing
28.9 per cent. Taking groups of railway lines repre
senting different sections of the country, the fall be
tween 1872 and 1895 was:
Lake Shore and Michigan Southern â From 1.88
to .55.
Chicago and Altonâ From 1.89 to .86.
Texas and Pacific â From 5.13 to I.IL
Southern Pacificâ From 3.65 to 1.26.
Experience, not only in California, but throughout
the country, has shown competition, and other ele
ments inherent in business laws and principles, to be
the real force in the fall and equalization of rates, of
which we have a local example in the changed con
dition of rates from San Joaquin Valley points since
the construction of the San Joaquin Valley Railroad.
Therefore it is not politics that has effected this de
cline in the cost of travel and transportation in the
United States. It cost eleven billions of dollars to
build and equip the 190,000 miles of railway in this
country. Do the fusionists propose to reach Govern
ment ownership by buying those roads at that price?
Or do they propose to duplicate them at the less cost
at which roads can now be built? This less cost
would enable duplication of the system for, say, six
billions of dollars. Where do they propose to get the
money?
These propositions are made upon the theory that
Government ownership will give cheaper service, and
the roads of France, Belgium, Germany, Austria and
Italy are cited as examples of successful Government
ownership and operation. The latest reliable com
parison of rates here and in Europe gives the follow
ing results:
Passenger, Freight,
per mile. ton per mile.
United States $2 14 $ 97
Prussia, - 2 99 132
Austria 3 05 1 56
France 3 36 159
Belgium 2 25 139
England 2 20 195
At the Belgian freight rate the American railways
would have received $286,000,000 more than they did
on the tonnage of 1897; at the English rate about $400,
000,000 more. If American rates for both freight and
passengers were the average of European rates, our
railroads last year would have taken from the people
one billion of dollars more than they did receive.
With this difference in rates in favor of the Ameri
can traveler and shipper, the European roads pay to
their labor just half the wages paid by American
roads.
We enter no defense of American railway policy,
and do not intend to be alarmed by such an accusa
tion. Men are seeking high office here and elsewhere
by advocating Government ownership of railways and
are asking votes by telling the people a fairy tale
about the economies of such ownership in Europe,
and by not telling the truth about American rates and
wages.
If figures can be found, outside of party platforms,
to controvert the foregoing, we will be pleased to
examine them.
THE LEGISLATIVE TICKET.
A STATE ticket of exceptional strength and
merit having been nominated, the next step
to be taken by the Republican party in pre
paring for the coming campaign is that of providing
for tbe nomination of legislative candidates equally
deserving of popular support. It is not to be a yel
low dog year in the contest for the Legislature any
more than in that for Governor. In the one field as
in the other, good men will win easily, while vicious
men or weak men will be defeated.
The Republican party in California has started out
this year to clean the camp of all corrupting elements
of every kind. Thus far it has done that work well.
The State Central Committee in adopting regulations
for the election of delegates to the State convention
set the bosses aside, called for primaries in all the
principal counties of the State, and opened a way by
which the rank and file could assert their preferences
for State candidates. As a result the convention was
free from the domination of bosses or corrupting cor
porations, and the candidates named as the standard
bearers of the party are everywhere recognized as
the representatives of the best elements of our citizen
ship, and have the support not only of all loyal Re
publicans, but of all intelligent independent voters.
The work of party purification which has been so
well started should be kept up. The selection of
legislative candidates should be as free from the dom
ination of bosses or the intrigues of scheming cor
porations as was that of the candidate for Governor
and his colleagues on the State ticket. No man
known to be subservient to any such boss or cor
poration, or who is likely to sell out to them after
election, can be elected this year. To nominate him
would simply put him up for defeat, and to that ex
tent diminish the sweep of the coming Republican
victory.
The people demand legislators who can be counted
on not only to elect a Republican to the United States
Senate, but to perform faithfully, honestly and with
ability the important duties of State legislation.
Party politics will not be the sole factor in determin
ing the election of legislators. The personal Itness
of the candidate will have much to do with it, and
rightly so, for at this time California is badly in need
of the clean sweeping broom of a Legislature that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 31, IS9S.
will serve the people and not the bosses, the welfare
of the commonwealth and not the greed of corpora
tions or intriguing combinations of any kind.
To attain the nomination of a meritorious legisla
tive ticket the rank and file of the party should be
gin preparations at once. Good citizens, taxpayers,
progressive, public-spirited men, should take an
interest in the task. Capable candidates should be put
forward for every place on the ticket. Clear warning
should be given that men who are willing to make
trades with corporations or with bosses for Sena
torial votes will not be accepted by the honest masses
of the party, and will be defeated if nominated. We
have started to make a clean camp as a preliminary
to a clean canvass, and it should be made clean
throughout.
BY their revolt against the political bosses who
have been using the schools of San Jose and
of Santa Clara County as a part of the spoils
which they distribute among their henchmen, the
students of the San Jose High School have made
themselves prominent factors in the fight now going
on all over the United States for the preservation of
the honor, dignity and usefulness of our public school
system.
While the revolt of the High School students is
the most notable event of the kind that has occurred
in Santa Clara County, it is not the first. Some time
ago the citizens of the school district at Alviso were
compelled to adopt similar tactics to save their edu
cational system from the corruption of politics. A
teacher at Alviso, thoroughly competent for the
work, highly esteemed by the taxpayers and the
parents of the pupils, and respected and loved by the
pupils themselves, was dismissed from his position
in order to make a place with a salary for one of the
henchmen of the gang. The supporters of the Alviso
school refused to submit. They provided a school
of their own, retained their old teacher and placed
Alviso on record as one of the American communi
ties where the purity of the public school system is
not to be subjected to political bosses.
While every good citizen must respect the motives
and admire the firmness displayed at Alviso and now
being displayed at San Jose, it will nevertheless be
noted with regret that such actions are necessary in
any part of California. The people are taxed to main
tain public schools for the education of their chil
dren, and it becomes a gross outrage when school
trustees conduct the schools in such a way that self
respecting parents having a proper regard for the
training of their children are compelled to go to a
further expense to maintain private schools or to
send the children to distant schools in order that their
sons and daughters may be rightly taught and be free
from the debasing influences of the bosses and their
creatures.
It has become evident that under the existing con
ditions it is to be a difficult task in any American
community to keep the public schools from becoming
a part of the spoils system of politics. The greedy
bosses and their hungry followers are continually cry
ing out for more salaries, and the School Department
affords many places for providing them. It is there
fore gratifying in the extreme to note the earnestness
with which the better class of Americans are every
where making a fight for the purity of the schools.
Just at present this fight in California has its storm
center in San Jose. The revolting students and their
parents are upholding the true principles of American
life. The stand they have taken will be honored
wherever it is known, and in the end victory will be
with it.
STATISTICS OF REGISTRATION.
IT has been stated that there has been a falling off
in registration of 40,000 throughout the State this
year. In this city the total decrease amounts to
10,027. In 1896 72,992 citizens voted in San Fran
cisco; in 1898 62,965 only have qualified themselves
to vote. It is reported that citizens apply every day
to the Registrar for permission to enroll, which
makes it appear that the early closing of the books
is in part responsible for the local decline. It is ab
surd for the law to close registration ninety days be
fore election, but it does so, and those who have been
left will be compelled to grin and bear it.
How the estimate has been obtained that there is a
falling off of 40,000 registrations in the State is not
disclosed. In the interior many of the great registers
are preserved from year to year, and the only manner
in which indifference or apathy manifests itself is
abstention from voting on election day. However, a
few registers are destroyed and remade by order of
the Board of Supervisors each year, and in every
county there is a natural increase in registrations.
Probably the statistician who promulgated the figures
quoted based his statement upon the loss in this city,
the losses in the counties where the great registers
have been replenished, and the failure of the usual
number of new citizens to register throughout the
State.
While all this does not indicate that the estimate
is reliable, there is reason to believe that it is not far
out of the way. The total vote cast in the State in
1896 was 298,691. If there is a falling off in registra
tions of 40,000 and 5 per cent refrain from voting on
election day, which is the usual thing, the total vote
this year will not reach 250,000. This is a decrease
ovejj 1892, when the total vote cast was 269,608.
It would be interesting to know exactly how this
decrease is going to affect politics. Generally when
party voters are dissatisfied they manifest their dis
pleasure by refusing to register. But this year the
registers closed before either State convention had
met and before the crop of soreheads generated by
both parties in all campaigns had been sown.
Probably some of the falling off in this city may
be attributed to the action of the McNab-Gould-
Alford syndicate, which grabbed the Democratic or
ganization and appointed a delegation to the State
convention. There is no doubt that Democrats in
this city are generally disgusted at this usurpation.
Color is given to the idea that the decrease is largely
Democratic by the fact that the heaviest falling off
is observable south of Market street, which is the
stronghold of that party.
But whether Democrats. Populists, mugwumps or
cranks have failed to register this year, or whether
the apparent apathy and indifference are due to sore
headedness, disgust or whatnot, there is one thing
the Republicans can do. They can induce all who
have registered to vote. The loss on election day is
usually 5 per cent. This may, by proper effort, be
cut down to zero, for it is a notorious fact that Re
publicans are more apt to overlook the day of elec
tion than are Democrats.
The police have in charge a boy of six years who
was found dead drunk. The father of this boy con
fesses to having been in the habit of giving him
whisky. There ought to be some way by which the
police could get charge of that father.
While Captain Clark of the Oregon is enjoying a
deserved rest ashore his pay diminishes to the extent
of $1800 a year, which shows that to be a hero and
work one's self sick for the old flag is an experience
not free from disadvantages.
c FIGHT FOR PRINCIPLE.
THE PASSING OF MALIETOA
AND THE PARTITION OF SAMOA
So poor old King Malietoa, who was supposed to reign over the Samoan
group of islands, is no more. He has taken his canoe and, according to
the pretty native legend, has sailed away over the great waters to join
the spirits of his forefathers. The passing over of his anganga will Â°e r Â°f~
ally celebrated; doubtless there has been a magnificent, funeral at Mane,
where the Kings are buried. A long procession of mat shrouded boats
has already passed down within the reef, along the palm clad shore, in
the prow of each a wailing chief, chanting in doleful chorus: "Let us
bow our heads. The clouds have passed along, taking with them his Ex
cellency King Malietoa. He is dead."
The funeral feast has been baked and eaten. The three Consuls, rep
resenting the powers signatory to the Berlin treaty, are running the Sa
moan Government just as they have always done, King or no King. But,
tho.ugh there never was such an opera bouffe monarchy as the Samoan, the
death of Malietoa brings us face to face with a very difficult problem which
concerns the United States as much, if not more, than either England or
Germany. Poor old Malietoa was never much of a monarch. He was
hardly more than a figure head. When I last saw him he was a prema
turely aged, decrepit old man, sitting in a pathetic imitation of royal
state in his so-called palace at Mulinuu. The King's palace, it may be
remarked, is only a four-roomed wooden cottage, of the type occupied by
any respectable Californian workman. It owes its origin to American gen
erosity, for it was built out of the funds derived from the sale of the
wrecks of the American warships lost in the great hurricane of 1889. The
United States gave the wrecks to Samoa in recognition of the services ren
dered by the natives in saving life and property. Thus the King was en
abled to have a palace of his own, and to remove from the leaf thatched hut
which had hitherto formed his home.
Malietoa never had much to say about local politics. Either he knew
nothing or was exceedingly discreet, and his remarks, when one visited
him, were mostly confined to the state of the weather and the lamentable
irregularity with which the trade winds were blowing. After all, one can
not expect much from a cheap monarchy, and the Samoan is probably one
of the cheapest in the world. The royal salary is $150 per month, and even
this is irregularly paid. The mass of the King's adherents, the chiefs
forming the native faipule, or Parliament, who live in shabby huts clus
tering round the royal residence on the peninsula of Molinuu, exist as best
they can upon their families. The Samoans contribute nothing toward the
expense of governing the state. The funds are furnished by the white tax
payers of Apia, so that perhaps there is some excuse for this shabby
household outfit.
Still, though he was but a royal negation, Malletoa alive was very
much better than Malietoa dead. There is certain to be a row about the
succession. A peculiar trait of the Samoan character is that they know
not the meaning of the word unanimity. The people can never be brought
to agree upon anything, whether it be merely a village law or the choice
of a King. Tamasese, the rebel chief, has been openly in arms for years.
He commands the support of perhaps half the population, and hostilities
have hitherto been checked only by the presence of European men-of-war.
Then Mataafa. who has been in exile, is coming back, and, as he com
mands the entire support of the Catholic party, he has a strong following.
I do not know yet who the Malietoa people will nominate as their choice.
But it is a moral certainty that there will be three candidates for the
throne, and only armed intervention by the three powers can prevent a gen
eral conilict. The mere native fighting would not matter very much, for
Samoan warfare is proverbially harmless, were it not for the international
complications it is sure to bring about. The Germans, ev^r since the fu
tile attempt to place their puppet, Tamasese, on the thr<Jhe, have been
watching for a chance to grab Samoa. Unless we keep a sharp lookout
this may be their opportunity.
The very proposal for the subdivision of the group which came to us
the other day by cable indicates the German intent. The will is father
to the deed, and imperious William only needs an excuse to hoist the Ger
man flag.
The idea apparently is that the present tripartite control of the group
should be abolished and the islands partitioned among the three powers
interestedâ Germany, England and the United States. Germany is to take
the wealthiest and most populous of the islands, Upolu, in fact pretty well
the whole of the cake. England is to be put off with the large and barren
Savuii, while the United States is to be asked to tusume the respon: Lbliity
of governing the little Isle of Tutuila, which has, at the most, some 4000
inhabitants. Tutuila is a charming place for the tourist, but from a com
mercial point of view its value is absolutely nil. It consists mainly of high
volcanic peaks, around the base of which, ensconsed in the little bays indent
ing the coast, are a few sparsely populated native villages. The one feature
of Tutuiia is the magnificent harbor of Pago-Pago, the finest in Polynesia.
On this harbor, as is well known, the United States already possess a coal
ing station, and steps are even now being taken to erect sheds and wharves
so as to bring it into practical use.
Savaii, though the largest of -he islands, is the newest from a geologi
cal point of view. The era of volcanic activity on this island has ended
but recently, within a few c Uuries. Consequently the interior is a mass
of rocky lava-covered desert, where even the agi.e native 5 cannot penetrate,
and where nothing but the hardiest of scrub will grow. The belt of alluvial
land around the coast is too narrow to admit of profitable cultivation,
and the whole island, though it is some fifty miles long, only supports a
population of about 12,000 natives. There are no good harbors, a large por
tion of the coast is inaccessible and rock-bound, the surf breaks with de
structive fury on its shores and the tittle trade in copra which is carried
on is only c --.ucted unde. conditions of th> greatest difficulty.
Upolu, on the other hand, has large areas of fertile and level land. Its
population is over 15,000. and even before the white people came to Samoa
at all it was the center of government for the group. To-day all the
commerce of the island passes through the one port of Apia, the only place
where the mail steamers and foreign going vessels call. Apia Bay, though
it has been the scene of grave disasters in the hurricane season, is a per
fectly safe haven during the greater part of the year, and, with a little
expenditure upon a breakwater, could be made secure for all time. Here
are the stores and warehouses, the leading white residents, all the wealth
of the islands, in fact.
The Germans, we are gravely told, propose to take whatever there is
of value in the carcass of the defunct Samoan monarchy, and to throw
England and America, by way of compensation, the scraps and offal. Even
the wildest supporters of colonial aggrandizement could hardly favor such
a scheme, and it is inconceivable that the English Government would ac
cept it. There is just this possibility, that the German diplomats, by giv
ing England a substantial quid pro quo in some other direction, possibly in
Africa or China, might induce England to yield a point with regard to
Samoa. But we have yet to learn that the United States is to derive any
equivalent advantage if she gives way to imperial direction. The advo
cates of an expansive colonial policy, those who, on the strength of the
recent war, would saddle the United States with the maintenance of a co
lonial empire, have to show where our gain will be. We are asked to take
the responsibility of governing an island which can be of no advantage to
us commercially, and is only of strategic importance as far as the coaling
station on Pago-Pago is concerned. And the right to use this coaling sta
tion we already possess.
If it were a question of annexing the whole Samoan group, the impor
tance of American trade interests might justify us in taking such an ag
gressive step. Already there is considerable commerce between San Fran
cisco and Apia, and this business, under proper management, might be
largely increased. All the cabin biscuits used by natives â and they are
large consumers â come from the factories of this city. All the lumber for
boat and house building is imported from California, also a great variety
of miscellaneous goods, household notions, and so on. Tinned and corned
moats, which at present come from the Australian colonies, might be sup
plied from this port, as well as many other kinds of goods and groceries.
By giving the Germans Upolu we would entirely destroy this growing
trade. Once Apia became a German port the restrictive tariffs which are
universally applied in the colonies of this nation would come into force.
Neither English nor American goods would be admitted except under pro
hibitive conditions. The great German trading firm which practically
controls the trade of the group would assume the unrestricted sway for
which it has long been hankering, and no white man of any other nation
ality need attempt to carry on business in Apia or other parts of Upolu.
It is true tha*t Savaii, under English control, would still be open to the
United States' trade, but this would be a poor compensation for the aban
donment of the best portion of the group.
There are many American storekeepers and traders in and around Apia.
The two leading stores in ihe town, the only places where Europeans can
find a variety of goods to suit their requirements, are, in fact, kept by citi
zens of this country. An American has recently planted large cocoa plan
tations, which â will soon be living a profitable yield. Shipments of copra are
sent to San Francisco by nearly every mail steamer for use in our oil fac
tories. These men will have to go, their business must cease, under German
control. And that is why in Apia you invariably find the English and Amer
ican sections of the community firmly united in opposition to German at
tempts at aggrandizement.
There is another and even more serious side to the question. The occu
pation of the island of Tutuila will entail exactly the same responsibilities,
will involve the maintenance of just as strong a fleet, as if we held the whole
of Samoa. Pago-Pago, as a coaling station, is valueless to any nation which
does not possess tl.e control of the sea. It can be easily fortified and ren
dered impregnable from the ocean at a comparatively small expense, but
unless the United States vessels could at all times pain access to it the place
would be worthless in the event of war. The recent Spanish experience at
Santiago has shown the value of a bottled up fleet. And Pago-Pago is a
harbor which is particularly favorable to the bottling up maneuver.
If our enemy possessed control of the sea no United States ship could
approach Pago-Pago, or if she once gained the sheltered haven could leave
it. Moreover, the place would have to be protected from land as well as sea
attack, and this would Involve the maintenance of a strong garrison. At
Leone, only a dozen miles away, troops can be easily landed, and the road
overland, though difficult, is by no means impracticable. To render Pago-
Pago impregnable, both from land and sea, will involve the expenditure of
millions of dollars and an enormous yearly outlay for maintenance. These
things should induce the people of the United States to pause before they
listen to the wiles of the German charmer. Also, if we wish to be practical
we should hurry off two or three war vessels to Apia at the shortest possi
ble notice. J. F. ROSE-SOL.EY.

and throughout the State. Hart's ver
sion is as follows: "Many years agoâ
somewhere in the 70sâI loaned Tripp $100.
The days passed and it was not repaid.
Then weeks passed and then months, and
sad to relate, years. Like a hideous
nightmare the recollection of that unpaid
debt clung to my memory. About a month
ago a friend accosted me in the street and
told me that there was a personal in The
Call and I had better read it. The per
sonal was inserted by the same Mr. Tripp
and he wanted to see me at the earliest
possible opportunity. I answered the
pei-sonal and Tripp called two days later.
He made mention of the debt and apolo
gized for its non-payment, but promised
that it would be canceled in a few daya
as he was about to dispose of a piece of
property, the sale of which would give
him the necessary money to settle both
principal and interest. I thanked him anl
indulged in a reverie, the text of which
was: 'Cast bread upon the waters and it
will return.'
"A week elapsed and no Tripp to gia,l
den my eyes. Finally he put in an ap
pearance. He apologized very humbly
this time and pleaded his inability to dis
pose of the property and offered tin
to me in satisfaction of the debt. I ac
cepted, and the deed in all its legal deco
rations was delivered. It was a sni;
far out in the Western Addition close to
the terminus of the McAllister-street car
line. But that didn't matter. It was
property and I always wanted to own
property. The desire of my life was at
last realized.
"I couldn't wait for the day to break
on the morrow. I forced a friend to go
with me to see it. We started out and
we had a merry hunt, I can tell you. Oh,

SAVE DOCTOR BILLS,
Better Than Blood Purifiers
; and Nerve Tonics
Is the New Remedy for Dyspep=
.."â¢..sia and Indigestion.
Better, Because PerFect Di-
. gestion Makes Pure Blood
and Strong Nerves.
: Some Interesting Facts Concern-
: : '".. ing This Remarkable
f Remedy.
, NOT A SECRET PATENT MEDICINE.
Whether we eat to live or live to eat. It
". Is certain that the possession of a healthy
â ' stomach and sound digestion go a long
way toward making life desirable, suc-
cessful, enjoyable. Beauty in woman,
- 'strength, mental capacity, endurance. In
â¢ man. depend more upon vigorous digestion
. than upon any other one thing.
The dyspeptic man is irritable, uncer-
'â¢ tain, fearful of the future. The dyspep-
' . . tic', woman is nervous, sallow, subject to
headaches and despondency.
â â¢â¢And. what Is the cause of these com-
mon types of men and women? Simply.
- ". .undigested food, nothing more nor less.
Â°"'. o The appetite being capricious, not enough
â  food, is eaten, and what is eaten. instead
â¢/ of being" properly digested, remains in the
", Stomach for hours, a sour, fermenting
â¢"â¢'â¢.mass, poisoning the blood, a source of Ir-
â¢ rHat-ion. to every nerve and organ. No
.-' wonder people suffer from poor blcxxi,
. shattered nerves, headaches, palpitating
â¢â¢.hearts, irritable tempers and gloomy, dis-
â  . contented feelings.
.. . -Now, what is the rational cure for th?> \
.â¢ common condition? Is it "blood puri- j
fiers" and "nerve tonics"? By no means, j
. â because they don't reach the seat of the |
'. trouble. Go to the fountain head, thÂ»
: ptomach, get that in good healthy work-
ing order, and pure blood, strong nerves,
ri^hi eyes, clear color will be the nat-
Jf-iral result.
- Why not? Where does blood, nerve,
' â  bone, sinew and flesh come from anyway.
'": if not from the .stomach, the food we eat
" and digest.
â¢â ' To' cure digestion, the one thing neces-
â¢ â¢ sary Is to j^ve the stomach a rest or par-
tial rest â¢by the daily use for a time of
Â° . some remedy which will digest food.
â  .. â¢ There is a very excellent preparation of
" this kind, not a marvelous secret patent
â¢ medicine, but h pleasant, harmless com-
. bination of vegetable essences, fruit salts,
;â¢ pure pepsin and Golden Seal, sold by
"'â¢' druggists under the name of Stuart's Dvs-
. pepsia. Tablets, and nothing to equal It
has yet been produced in the whole cate-
.gory of patent medicines.
I Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is superior
to- thorn .all. because when these tablets
are used you know what you are taking ;
Into your stomach. No secret is made ot |
their : composition and physicians and i
chemists know that one grain of the di- j
(restive principle in Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will digest 3000 times Its own
weight nf wholesome food. Dr. Jennison
recommends them highly, not only as a
J recommends them but also because they
cure for digestion, but also because they
increase 'flesh by* increasing nutrition.
' Dr. Harlandson says to increase flesh,
appetite arid to secure healthy digestion
'. I have' found nothing so safe, so effectual
as -Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. Mr. Jas.
.; Behtori of Rosston says: "I suffered five
years with nervous dyspepsia and catarrh
;â . of the stomach. Everything I ate seemed
Â£. to :sour on my stomach; could not enjoy
j a meal.' for fear of the distress afterward.
.. My" druggist advised Stuart's Dyspepsia
â¢ Tablets and I can now eat anything I
â¢â¢" want, 'have gained in flesh and good spir-
' â¢ Its and I know the tablets did It and I
"V shall always keep them within reach."
Â° â  One of the most remarkable cures ever
Â° made by these tablets was in the case or
Â° 'Mrs. Sarah Skeels of Lynnville, lowa,
Â«. who had chronic dyspepsia for twenty-five
; â¢ years 'and doctors pronounced her case
-,- Incurable, yet she enthusiastically writes
â¢ .that the tablets completely and perma-
nently cured her.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets save doctors'
' bill; because a full-sized package costing
â¢Â° : 50. cents at any drug store will often do
â more good for a weak stomach than fifty
.-.dollars* worth of ordinary doctor's fees.

A PROMINENT SAN FRANCISCAN,
Honored by High Official Position, Strongly In-
dorses a Well=Known Preparation.
All Californians know and admire the Hon. John T. Dare,
now United states Appraiser of this port. His experiences have
i been varied, and he lias been the recipient of many honors.
! He came around the Horn in ISGI as officer of a ship, and, going
I to Arizona, became noted on the frontier as a pony express rider,
i afterward serving as a member of the Territorial Legislature.
Returning to San Francisco, he was admitted to the bar in 1874.
Later he visited Honolulu, became a member of the King's
Cabinet, and was appointed by King Kalakaua Attorney-
General of the Island Kingdom.
Two years later he returned to San Francisco, resumed the
practice of law, and acted as fiduciary agent for large con-
tractors engaged in railroad building.
In 1877 he represented Solano County in the Legislature.
He served a term in the District Attorney's office, and his splen-
did record as Prosecuting Attorney is conceded to bo one of the
best and most successful in the history of the office.
Mr. Dare is a man of action, resolute and fertile in re-
sources. He has rendered valuable service to the Republican
party on the stump, and is widely known as a practical news-
paper writer.
The fact that Mr. Dare has been willing to make public the
great benefit derived from the U3e of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
is a strong argument in favor of that widely advertised prepara-
tion. Here is what he has to say :
San Francisco, June 20, '98.
F. A Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich.
Dear Sirs â In view of the fact that I have been for
years a great sufferer from Dyspepsia and kindred stomach
troubles, I think it only a matter of justice to make public the
remarkable effect of your well-known remedy, Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets, for the cure of such maladies. While one year ago
it was practically an impossibility for mo to eat anything but
select foods, I am happy to state that after three months' use of
the Tablets I find no difficulty in eating the heartiest meals of
any kind of food desired without disagreeable after effects.
You are at liberty to use my name in the exploitation of
your remedies, as I consider it is your due that those who are
benefited should make public the benefit so derived.
Yours very truly, JOHN T. DARE,
Appraiser of the Port of San Francisco.
FACTS WITH POINTS.
Every One of These Statements Ab-
solutely True.
Mr. A. V,'. Sharper, 61 Prospect street,
Indianapolis, Ind., says: "Gratitude
within the police power of the Legislature.
Another point is that the employe Instead of
the employer should have been prosecuted.
Where clerks and salesmen are employed for
the specific purpose of selling to customers
the goods contained in a store, so far as the
sale of such goods is concerned the acts of
such clerks and salesmen are the acts of the
proprietor. The evidence in this case shows
the salesman to have been employed as a sales
man by the defendant and that the goods sold
were taken from the stock of goods In the
store, which he was employed to sell. "We are
satisfied that such proof is all that Is required
to hold the employer guilty, provided, in sell
ing the goods, the law was violated.
The last and main point made by appellant
is that the prosecution failed to show that de
fendant knew the goods Hold to be adulterated
and that defendant should have been permit
ted to show that he did not know them to be
so. This point calls for an interpretation of
the statute under which the prosecution is
had.
The statute here In question nowhere re
quires any knowledge of the adulterated char
acter of the goods as an essential to the com
pletion of the crime of selling such goods.
The provision is that he who sells adulterated
goods is guilty of a crime. Not to know what
he Is selling is clearly made by the statute
criminal necligence. Taking the words of the
statute as indicating the intent of the Legis
lature we find that certain elements are spe
cified as necessary to the completion of the
crime. No allusion Is made to knowledge. Had
the Legislature Intended to make a knowledge
of adulteration an element of the crime they
could and would have said bo.
It is clear to us that he who, by himself or
\hrou2h a clerk, sells food which has be*:n
adulterated, whether he knew it to be adul
terated or not, commits a crime under this
law. He sells it at his peril and Is guilty of
criminal negligence If he does not know it to
be unadulterated.
A MISTAKE WAS MADE.
Young Walter Nagle, Accused of
Picking Pockets, Is Promptly
Discharged.
' Walter Nagle, who in company with
Frank Wall was arrested on a Mission
street car Sunday evening on the charge
of picking pockets, was discharKed yes
terday morning after a brief questioning
by the police authorities, who were con
vfnrpd that a mistake had been made.
Wall who is out on $100 bail, will also
he discharged, in all probability.
No one who knows Nagle thinks for a
moment that he would be ~ U ilty of

REVIEW OF TROOPS
AT THE PRESIDIO
INTERESTING EVENT BEGIN
NING AT 10:30 A. M.
All the Evidence in the Case of the
Tennessee Rioters Has Been
Heard.
The review of the troops now at the
Presidio, under command of General Mil
ler, will take place this morning: at 10:30
on the Prenidio Drill Heights, or, as bet
ter known, the Presidio Golf Grounds.
The formation will be line of masses with
the second brigade in the- rear of the
first. The division will be under the
command of Colonel Funston, while Colo
nel John R. Berry will command the First
Brigade, and Coionel W. C. Smith the
Second. The First Washington Regiment
and the troop of Nevada Cavalry, dis
mounted, will be attached to the First
Brigade, together with the two troops of
the Fourth Cavalry. Prior to the review
there will be regimental inspection and
muster of the troops in their own camps
for the purpose of pay and the monthly
Inspection returns. Major Frank S. Rfce
of the California Heavy Artillery will
muster the Nevada Cavalry. The troops
will he in light marching order and the
review will be concluded by noon.
ThÂ«> Board of Officers appointed by Gen
eral Miller to assess the damage done the
property of Zero Thomas by the soldiers
of the Tennessee Regiment will convene
again this morning for the purpose of al
lowing the counsel for Thomas to present
their views of the case. The board will
then go into the matter of fixing the
amount of the damage. All of the evi
dence has been heard. The court-martial
appointed to try the men implicated In
the affair has about concluded its work
and will, probably some time this week,
submit its finding to General Miller.
There are over two hundred type-written
pages of testimony In the case.
A new general court-martial was ap

STUART'S DYSPEPSIA TABLETS.
well and have none but words of praise
for Stuart's Tablets.
Mrs. Sarah A. Skeels. Lynnville, Towa:
"It has been six months since I took
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and am fully
cured. Have not had a particle of distress
or difficulty since. This Is in the face of
the fact that I had suffered from stom-
ach trouble for twenty-five years and was
pronounced incurable by the doctors.
James Newmestes, Eau Claire. Wis..
says: "Two 50-ccnt packages of Stuart s
Dyspepsia Tablets did me more good than
any remedy I had ever before tried. They
hit the spot with me, and I once more
have an appetite and can eat what I
please without fear of distress and bloat-
ing afterward."
Dr. Harlandson relates the case of Miss
Helen Sholes of Nashville, who was cured
of dyspepsia and gained 18 pounds In
weight after suffering from stomach trou-
ble for eight years. The doctor uses them
In all stomach troubles because they are
not a secret patent medicine, but contain
pure pepsin. Diastase, fruit acids and val-
uable digestives, which digest the food
whether the stomach works or not, gives
It the needed rest, and a cure Is the nat-
ural result.
Dr. Jennison says nine-tenths of disease
Is caused by Indigpstion and Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets is the safest and best cure,
because they are not a secret patent med-
icine, but contain the valuable digestive
principles needed by every weak stomach,
and a whole box would not hurt a child,
being absolutely harmless.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at 50 cents per package.
Send to Stuart Co.. Marshall. Mich., for
little book on symptoms and treatment of
stomach troubles.
A GOOD COMPLEXION
Depends on Good Digestion.
This Is almost an axiom, although us-
ually we are apt to think that cosmetics,
face powders, lotions, fancy soaps, etc.,
are the secret for securing a clear com-
plexion.
But all these are simply superficial as-
sistants. It Is imposible to have a good
complexion unless the digestive organs
perform their work properly, unless the
stomach by properly digesting the food
taken Into it furnishes an abundance of
pure blood a good complexion Is Impos-
sible.
This is the reason so many ladles are
using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because
they promptly cure any stomach trouble,
and they have found out that perfect
digestion means a perfect complexion and
one that does not require cosmetics and
powders to enhance its beauty.
Many ladies diet themselves or deny
thomselvos many articles of food solely
In order to kc-ep their complexions clear.
When Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets nre
used no such dieting is necessary. Take
these tablets and eat all the good, whole-
some food you want, and you need have
no fear of indigestion, nor the sallow, dull
complexion which nine women out of ten
have, solely because they are suffering
from some form of indigestion.
Bear in mind that beauty proceeds from
good health, good health results from per-
fect digestion, and we have advanced the
best argument to Induce every man or
woman to give this splendid remedy a
trial.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tahlets can be found
In drugstores, and costs but 50 cents per
package. They are prepared by the
Stuart Chemical Co.. Marshall. Mich.
If there is any derangement of the
stomach or bowels they will remove it.
and the resultant effects are good diges-
tion, good health and a dear, bright com-
plexion. Ask your druggist for the tab-
lets and a free book on stomach diseases.
INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
Of an lowa Lady Who Was Cured of
Dyspepsia After Suffering for
Twenty-Five Years.
Mrs. Sarah A. Sker-Is, an estimable lndy
residing at Lynnville, Jasper County.
lowa, was for twenty-five yars a sufferer
from Dyspepsia, and her complete restor- j
atlon to health is so remarkable that we j
present the facts In the case for the bene- i
fit of our readers, many of whom have j
doubtless suffered in the same manner
and will, therefore, be Interested In learn-
ing how all stomach troubles may be !
avoided and cured. Mrs. Skeels says: I !
used only one package of Stuart's Dys- *
pepsia Tablets and I received such great
and unexpected benefit that I wish to ex- j
press my sincere gratitude. In fact. It has
been six months since I t<>ok the medi-
cine and I have not had one particle of
distress or difficulty since. And all this In
the face of the fnct that the best doctors
I consulted told me my case was Incur-
able, as I had suffered for twenty-five
years. I want half a dozen packages to
distribute among my friends here who are
very anxious to try this remedy. Yours
truly. MRS. SARAH A. SKEELS.
The reason why Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are so successful In curing indi-
gestion and stomach troubles and the rea- |
sop why It never disappoints those who
need it and use it is because nothing Is
claimed for it except what It will actu-
ally perform. It Is not a cure-all, and no
such claims are made for it. It is pre- !
pared for the sole purpose of curing j
Dyspepsia and the various forms of Indi-
gestion.
There is scarcely a patent medicine
made but what Is claimed to cure dyspep-
sia as well as a hundred othor troubles.
When, as a matter of fact, a remedy to
cure Dyspepsia must be prepared especi-
ally for that and nothing else: and among
nil the remedies, patent nostrums, bitters,
etc.. so extensively advertised you will
find that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is
the only one advertised as a cure for dys-
pepsia and nothing f-lse. The remedy is
prepared by the Stuart Co. of Marshall.
Mich., and for sale by all druggists at '*) '
cents per package, and if you suffer from i
any form of stomach derangement or I
indigestion, a trial will not disappoint
you.

AN OLD MAN BEATEN
BY HiS BLIND SON
HELD WITH ONE HAND AND
STRUCK WITH THE OTHER.
Theo. Barkhausen Causes a Sensation
in Judge Joachimsen's Court
by Falling in a Faint.
Theodore Barkhausen, an aged man liv
ing at Powell and Green streets, created
a sensation in Judge Joachimsen's court
yesterday morning. He was sitting on
a chair waiting for a warrant when he
fell in a heap on the floor. It was thought
at first that he was dead, but an ex
amination showed that he was still
breathing. Three policemen carried him
to the patrol wagon and he was driven to
the Receiving Hospital, where he n v
ered in about half an hour. The case was
diagnosed as synocope.
The old man's face was a pitiable Bight.
It "was swollen and discolored to such an
extent that the physicians thought at
first he was suffering from erysipelas.
He said that he has a blind son living
with him who has been a source of trou
ble for years. Because the old man did
not give him enough money to squander
he threatened to injure him at the first
opportunity. Being afraid of him the old
man kept out of his way, but about a
week ago the son caught him, and grasp
ing him tightly with one hand struck him
repeatedly on the face with his other
hand. The old man was unable to leave
the house until yesterday morning, and
when he reached the court room he felt
so weak that he fell in a dead faint.
Hia object in visiting the court was to
swear to a warrant for the arrest of hia
son on the charge of battery and threats
to kill. He is afraid that the son will do
him serious injury unless he is punished
by the court. After recovering in the
hospital he was advised to wait for a day
or two until he got stronger. Meantime
the son will be warned to keep his hands
off.

CRUELTY ON
THE HIGH SEAS
The Cyrus Wakefield a
"Hell Ship."
OFFICERS TO BE PROSECUTED
SECOND MATE LEONARD HAS
LEFT THE VESSEL.
Sailors Say They Were Beaten,
Wounded and 111-Treated From
the Time the Ship Left
Baltimore.
Another "hell ship" reached port yes
terday. According to the crew of the
Cyrus Wakefleld a tougher set of officers
never commanded a vessel, and if there
is any law in the land the sailors intend
to make Captain Henry, First Mate Wil
liamson and Second Mate Leonard an
swer for their brutality. The record of
the voyage from Baltimore to San Fran
cisco is to be laid before the Unitea
States District Attorney to-day and war
rants sworn out for their arrest. United
States Marshal Shine will have some
trouble in locating Second Mate Leonard,
as he disappeared yesterday as soon as
the ship dropped anchor.
The Cyrus Waketieid left Baltimore four
months ago. and during the entire pas
page, according to the sailors, there was
hardly a day passed but one of them was
beaten and ill used. J. A. Jansen came
ashore yesterday afternoon with his nose
swollen and his face marked with blood
from a blow he received from the mate
while the ship was entering port. His of
fense was letting a drop of varnish fall
on the deck, and for that he was knocked
down and kicked.
"I have traveled in some pretty hard
ships, but the Cyrus Wakefleld takes the
cake," said the boatswain yesterday.
"The first day out Paul Peterson was
knocked down with a knuckle duster and
brutally beaten by the captain, mate and
second mate. I really believe they would
have killed him If the unfortunate fe low
had not escaped aloft. Charlie Mattson
was on the main crosstrees doing some
work and was not getting along fust
enough to suit the second mate. Leonard
went aloft and struck him a blow with a
scraper, almost knocking him overboard
Had it not been for P. Webb, who caught
him when he stumbled, Mattson would
surely have gone to Davy Jones' locker.
'A few days later Second Mate Leonard
had a row with Webb and struck the
latter on the face with an iron punch,
almost putting his eye out. While he was
down. First Mate Williamson called out
'Kick the life out of the lazy sailor and
the second mate answered, I d kill him
if we were only going to Hongkong.
"When they got tired of beating us they
started in and threw our clothes over
board, and when the men said they would
have the law on them Second Mate Leon
ard laughed and said. 'We're KOlng to
Frisco; there's no law in that hole. Part
of the evidence we have against them is
the belaying pin which did most of the
damage. There is hardly one of us but
has felt its weight, and nearly all of us
have marks on pome portion of our body
left by it. Herman Lensky secured it be
fore he left the ship. Tbe second mate
hit him over the arm with it on one oc
casion and laid him up for a week. Leon
ard has been on other ships and was for
mtrlv known as O'Connor. He went
ashore first thing with the captain yes
terday morning, but we will catch him if
we have to hunt him from one end of
California to the other. We tried to have
thf harbor police arrest the tnree offi
cers but they would not do it. saving we
would have to get the United States Mar
shal to do that. Well, we are going to do
that, and we will soon find out whether
there is any law in California or not.
Captain Henry says that the men were
the worst lot of kickers that ever sailed
on a ship Many of them had never been
to ?pa before, and only two or three of
them were "A. B.'s." He denies the sto
riea of brutality in toto. and says tnat
while one or two of them may ha*-e got
an occasional cuff they did not get half
what they deserved. The chances are that
the whole matter will be aired before
United States Commissioner Heacock to-
m A r H Evans, the private secretary of
Goodall. Perkins & Co., is about to sever
his connection with that firm after twenty
years of faithful service. He has been
apointed general manager of the Pacific
Trarisfer Company and will begin his new
duties to-morrow. All the vast shipping
interests of Goodall. Perkins & Co. Mr.
Evans had at his finger's end and his loss
will ho very much felt by the firm. Their
however, is the gain of the Pacific
Transfer Company, as Mr. Evans is a
first-class business man and a great fa
vorite with the traveling public. At the
meeting at which Mr. Evans was elected
k n-ral manager. Captain C. Miner Good
all was elected vice president and \\ illiam
Babcock a director of the transfer com
pany, so that that concern has been
strengthened al! around.
The cannery steamer Equator, owned by
J D. Hume, had a narrow escape in Koo
gak Bay recently. An Indian pilot ran
her high and dry on the beach at low
water one night. When the tide came in
she siid down into deep water and at
next low tide nothing but the top of her
smokestack could be seen. To the Italian
fishermen employed at the Hume Can
nery the loss of the steamer meant the
1. h of an entire season's work, so they
went to work and by dint of bull strength
and perseverance they got the vessel up
and beached. She was then patched up
and put in commission again.

"Fire" Ault, a teamster for Farnsworth.
and Levi Gibson, his friend, were booked
at the Harbor Police Etatlon on a charge
of petty larceny by Officer L. Shaw yes
terday." Haas Bros., at 110 California
street, have been missing groceries for
some time and yesterday morning they
put O. Schrieber to watch from an up
stairs window. He saw Gibson take a
case of condensed milk and put it into
AuKs wagon and then Ault covered it
with a blanket and drove away. Officer
Shaw followed them to a grocery and
liquor Store at 42 Minna street and thf>re
located the milk and a bag of suirar, which
also belonged to Haas Bros. The sugar
and milk were only left at the grocery
for safe keeping.
HOP RATES REDUCED.
The Former Tariff of 82 per Hundred
Lowered 50 Cents by the South
ern Pacific.
The freight department of the Southern
Pacific announces a reduction In rates on
hops from California and Oregon points
to Missouri River and Eastern points.
The former rate was $2 per hundred, which
will be lessened tr> $1 50. This new rate
will go into effect in two weeks.
The hop season will begin just about tho
time the reduction becomes effective. As
California and Oregon are large producers
of this agricultural commodity the lessen
ing of the rate in its effect upon local
I producers is of great Importance,

SHE'S A CAPTAIN.
A Woman Wearing Shoulder Straps
Is Attracting a Great Deal of
Attention.
The war with Spain has developed
among the women a taste for military
dress, and blue Jackets and brass buttons
are now all the rage. It remained, how
ever, for a certain San Francisco woman
to devise a military costume both unique
and original. It is a plain black silk
dress, a captain's shoulder straps and the
terra cotta slouch hat now In vogue in
the army. In this costume the woman
can be seen every afternoon parading on
the north side of Market street. To say
that she is the observed of all observers
is no exaggeration, for every eye is on
her and every neck is turned to catch a
passing view of her.
Yesterday afternoon this female cap
tain, who Is evidently very proud of her
uniform, was passing the military head
quarters building at O'Farrell and Mar
ket streets and seÂ»>ing a colonel and a
major standing at the door she gave them
the regulation salute, to which they gal
lantly responded, not, however, without
being amused at the woman's rather ec
centric dress.
"Do you know to what branch of the
service she belongs?" asked the colonel
of the major. "I see she wears no In
signia to indicate either the artillery, the
cavalry or the infantry-"
"She is probably a commander of In
fantry," replied the major, who never
cracked a smile.
"Just so," observed the colonel, with a
far-away look.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STH 'CX MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 30.â bears continued
their campaign against prices of stocks to
day. Their efforts were at one time attended j
â¢with moderate success. But before the day s j
session had ended they found themselves under
the pressure of advancing prices and they
were obliged themselves to contribute to the
advance by buying to cover short contracts.
There were several elements of the situation
In their favor. There was continued firmness
In the rates for money and continued losses
by the banks to the sub-treasury to pay for
Government bond allotments, causing appre
hension of a money squeeze at a later period.
There was also some evidence that the opening
advance in prices was manipulated to afford
opportunity for profit-taking, thus giving en
couragement to the bears. There was evidence
of public 'support in many stocks at a level
slightly below yesterday's prices and there was
large general buying also invited by any de
cline. Evidence of this influenced the recov
ery The buying for London account which
held a number of the international favorites
firm nearly all day also formed an effective
point of resistance. There were authoritative
denials late in the day on behalf of the officials
of the coalers of any extensive price cutting.
Further weakening of exchange gave promise
of early gold Imports though the reported buy-
Ing of gold in London yesterday for New York
account was not confirmed.
Some of the speculative bonds reacted early
lii sympathy with stocks, but prices generally
recovered before the close. Total sales, $3,035,
000 * *
United States Is. when issued, declined %â  In

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 30.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram from London says: The
stuck markets here wore irregular and the
tone was firm. The chief feature was the flat
ness on the Paris Bourse, which was said to be
due to the unfavorable F;-ench interpretation
ot the Czar's peace message. This weakness
Mas doubtless assisted by the promising
monthly settlement, to-morrow being option
day.
Americans opened dull In sympathy with
New York prices, rallied on continental sup
port, then weakened and finally closed good on
the resumption of New York buying.
In spite of the dullness Interest in Americans
here tends to spread. Grand Trunk was lower
on fears of a bad revenue statement, bpauish
4's are flat on Paris dullness.
The New York demnnd for gold here con
tinues, but orders which existed to take eagles
from the Bank of England to-day were can
celed for the moment.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Aug. 30.â Receipts of wheat In the
Northwest and at Chicago were heavy, and
Liverpool before the day's business commenced 1
here had declined %d for September and Hd
for December wheat. For those reasons there
was some disposition to sell at the opening for !
somewhat less than the prices current at the
close yesterday, but that rather general wish j
was no sooner gratified than it was being re- i
pented of. It soon became evident from the ]
number of buyers at the slight decline at the :
i start that shorts were numerous and their ,
I feelings far from satisfied with their position.
I News from abroad was In the main of a bull- ;
i ish character. Liverpool cabled that weather >
I In the United Kingdom was unsettled and crop
, reports from Russia were still of a disappoint- I
I Ing character. The feeling In cash wheat w,is
easy and prices ruled from H to 1c a bushel
I lower. The Atlantic port exports were itO.ooo
bushels in wheat and flour. One point in the !
I day's Statistical developments that attracted '
â  a good deal of attention and added to the firm- i
' ne^s that generally prevailed in the pit was
\ the small quantity of contract wheat In Chi- ;
| cago regular elevators, the total being under :
79,000 bushels.
That of course principally affected shorts for
September. September closed V4@V*c higher,
i and December rose Sc.
i Corn was strong, due to continuation and re-
I Iteration of previous items from the country
! concerning what was claimed to be the very |
unpromising outlook for the crop. Another
hot wave was predicted for to-morrow, and as \
I the reports of damage have been from heat
already more of It made traders apprehensive
; September gained He >
Oats ruled steady with corn, but the fluc
1 tuatlons were narrow, closing unchanged to %c
up.
A fair amount of speculative business was '
done in provisions and more than ususal of. It !
on orders from outside. The chief feature of i
the business from the manufacturer's point of
view was the excellent and heavy demand for â 
cash prodi cts. Pork and lard closed un- j

LIQUOR MEN TO BENEFIT
MAYOR THOMAS FAVORS THE
NEW ORDINANCE.
Another Effort Will Be Made to
Induce the Council Not to
Finally Pass thÂ«
Measure.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 30.
Nearly every prominent merchant find
1 men in this city were
i this morning at a special meeting
of the Board of Trade called to consider
the matter of taxing the merchants and
nse fees 1 keep
ers. This is the most Important matter
â¢ baa come before the City Council
Binoe it took office. The ordinance pro
vides for the reduction of liquor licenses
from $luO to $50 a quarter, and provides
The taxing of all other business by a
graded scale of from $15 t> carter.
The main argument put forward by the
merchants is that as every one is now
selling goods at the lowest price In order
to hold trade, the additional tax must of
Blty be borne by the consumer, and
this Is said to mean that more Oakland
trade will be carried to San Francisco.
At to-day's meeting the merchants de
clared that it was unfair to -~mix
the questions of licensing saloons and
merchants. C. W. Kinsey said: "It seems
to me that the liquor men propose to
lower their liquor licenses by tagging the
tax on the merchants. I think the two
parts of the ordinance were coupled to
gether for a pur]
A resolut ting against the pas
sage of the ordinance was adopted, and
will be sent to the City Council. Among
those who condemned the measure as be

of the city wore liugh Hamilton.

everybody should pay a share."

residing at 1031 Seventh avenue, East Oakland, as their husband. Both say
they were legally married to him. Each Is the mother of three children,
of whom Trip Is said to be the father. One of the women, is Louisa A. Trip,
formerly of New York; the other Is Mrs. R. M. Trip of East Oakland, and
whom Mr. Trip believed he had a legal right to marry, claiming that he
had obtained a divorce from Mrs. Trip No. 1 about fifteen years ago.
Mrs. Trip No. 1 is now bringing suit to set aside this divorce, and out
of this suit complications are anticipated. Plaintiff claims that the di
vorce was procured by fraud, and that consequently the decree Is not ef
fective, and as Trip has since married again she holds that his present
marital relations are of a bigamous character, notwithstanding that the
present wife married him with the conscious understanding that he had
been absolved from all obligations to his first spouse. Mrs. Trip No. 1 asks
that the decree be set aside and that she be restored to her rights as the
legal wife of Trip.
The broker's present wife Is Intensely mortified over the notoriety the
action brings with It, while Mr. Trip is away on a business trip and knows
nothing of the suit.
torney Emil Nusbaumer appeared for
Mow. Ball was fixed at $10,000.

lot worth $4uoo, which, however, he had

THE SEVENTH OBJECTS TO BEING MUSTERED OUT.
The men of the Seventh Regiment, United States Volunteers, are in
censed at the latest move of persons in Southern California, who are en
deavoring to have them mustered out. It is Affirmed by officers here that
the move Is a political one. The following peppery correspondence has
passed between Colonel J. R. Berry and J. R. Newberry of Los Angeles:
J. R. Newberry Vice President War Board, Los Angeles, Cal.: Your
telegram of this date is received, in which you say:
"Disclaiming any knowi^ ' â¢ of the retention in camp of the. Seventh
Regiment or of the causes of so much sickness and great mortality and
with no disposition for fault finding or censure, yet the facts stand out
so apparent to the families and friends of 'the boys that the members of
the War Board are constantly besieged to make an effort to have the
regiment mustered out, that the boys may return home."
In reply permit me to say that we are dumfounded at your sudden
change of attitude. You came here last week profusely asserting your de-
Bire and that of your so-called War Board to further the wishes "of the
Seventh Regiment to be sent abroad. Your very last words to me before
you left for home were an assurance that anything the Seventh asked
for in that direction would be done. Now suddenly, without consulting
with us and as if inspired by some mysterious political Influence, you
face abruptly about and talk about getting us mustered out. You are
hereby notified that the Seventh Is not made of that kind of stuff. We have
the assurance that we will yet go to Honolulu, en route to Manila, where
there is still work to be done. The Seventh does not want to be mustered
out. You and your so-called War Board have nothing to do wu.i the Sev
enth Regiment aa a military organization in the service of the United
States. Since it appears that you and your War Board are not our friends
we simply ask of you to keep your hands off. We are not in need of cold
footed meddlers to show us the way to be mustered out. You do not, in
this matter, represent the sentiments of the Seventh Regiment nor of the
good people whom the Seventh Regiment represents. Will you undertake*
to tell us whether, in the course you are pursuing, you do or do not rep
resent the sentiments of Brigadier General Harrison Gr?- Otis, whom you
as vice president of the so-called War Board now represent? In conclu
sion, permit me to suggest that what the Seventh wants is to be permitted
to serve out an honorable military career to its end. Up to the present
time no one can say that its career has not been honorable. Will you
kindly permit us to round out and finish thlÃ career as honorably aa it has
been begun? J. R. BERRY, Colonel Commanding.

RETURN PAPERS
TO MRS. SATHER
Thus Probably Ends a
Sensational Suit.
DISPUTE AMONG ATTORNEYS
ONE HELD THEY HAD BEEN AL
READY RETURNED.
M. M. Estee Claims That the Docu
ments Were Valued at
Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 30.
The suit which promised to be one of
the moat sensational evc-r tried In this
county, brought by Mrs. Jane K. Sather
against Colonel Joseph F. Evans, will
soon be withdrawn. On behalf of Evans
Morris M. Estee has forwarded the pa
pers demanded by Mrs. Sather to her
attorney, A. A. Moore, and as this was
the chief purpose In bringing the suit it
is not supposed that the action for dam
ages will be prosecuted.
Colonel Joseph F. Evans was some time
ago appointed Collector of Customs for
Manila under the United States Military
j Government at the Philippines, and it
was stated that the result might be that
he would not be able to leave the State
â¢without being put to much trouble. A
i few weeka ago some depositions were
{ taken.
Colonel Evans* deposition was in effect
I that Mrs. Sather had engaged him and
I that he had :l;arge of the papers winch
she complained of having lost.
The Colonel was Mrs. Bather's attorney
some years ago, when W. J. Dingee was
her agent, and a demand was made
on Mr. Dingee for 138,254. Evans discov
ered In December, 1897, that Mrs. Sather
had guaranteed $11,000 of notes due the
Oakland Bank of Savings on mortgages
on her property, said to have been made
by her agents. He also learned that she
had made Incorrect statements of her
claim against her former agent and that
these discoveries led to his wathdrawal
as her attorney. She then demanded that
he return the papers which he held be
longing to her. Those papers, according
to Evans, were kept in a tin box in M. M.
Estee's safe and he gave it to one of his
clerks â a man named Noyes â with in
structions to deliver it to Mrs. Sather.
That was the last he saw of box or pa
pers. Noyes, he said, delivered the box
as instructed.
The colonel could pot swear positively
that the papers were in the tin box when
it was delivered to Mrs. Sather, but he
believed they were. It was also brought
out that Mrs. Sather had employed an
expert accountant named Woodard to in
vestigate her business affairs, and that
he had suddenly and mysteriously gone
East. It was also intimated by Attor
ney A. A. Moore, during the proceed
ings, that the mortgages held by the sav
ings bank of Oakland on property alleged
to have been purchased by Dingee for
Mrs. Sather, stood in the names of oth
ers, and that they had mortgaged the
property to the bank as security for mon
eys borrowed by Mr. Dingee.
Mrs. Sather was confident that she had
not received the papers, and in making
her deposition she stated that when Col
onel Evans acted as her attorney she
turned over to him all the papers relat
ing to her transactions with Mr. Dingue.
When the colonel settled with Mrs. Sath
er she says he did not return the valu
able documents, but "a lot of old trash,
smelling very strongly of tobacco." Mrs.
Sather also stated that the papers she
sought were monthly statements re
lating to the collection of rents and the
purchase and sale of real estate.
She believed there were one hundred
and ten of these statements not in her
possession, and she further believed that
they would be of great value to her
should she be able to procure them. It
was to recover these papers that suit was
brought against Coloned Evans for $25,000.
About a year ago Mr. Dingee ceased to be
the agent of Mrs. Sather and her new
agents Heron & Holoomb, put an ex
pert to work on hor former accounts. A
little discrepancy was found and she then
employed Colonel Evans as her attorney.
Dealings between them were not alto
gether satisfactory and Mr. Sanborn be
came her attorney and brought suit to re
cover the missing monthly statements.
After tbe taking of the depositions
vague hints were dropped that all kinds
of sensations would be brought forward
at the trial. Many attorneys were en
gaged by both sides, A. A- Moore am:
John Sanborn were retained by Mr^
Sather, while Colonel Evans engaged
Morris -M. Estee and Martin & Robin
son. Mr. Dlngee protested that he haÂ«.
turned over everything to Mrs. Sathei
and declared that if any of the paper.
were missing they could be easily dupli
cated, and he would be glad to suppl..
duplicates. He also referred to the fact
that he had Mrs. Bather's written ac
knowledgment that a. accounts between
them were settled and correct.
Now, the missing papers which it was
declared existed only In the Imagination
of Mrs. Sather, have been returned to A.
A. Moore, Mrs. Sather's attorney, by Mor
ris M. Estee. Messrs Martin and Robin-
Bon, attorneys of this city have also been
notified by Mr. Estee that the missing
tin box has been found and the papers re
turned.
"It is true that we have been notified
of the return of the papers to Mrs. Sath
er's attorney," said Attorney Robinson,
to-day. "I do not know just what effect
such an action will have on the suit mow
on file, but it will probably end it. I do
not know where the papers have been all
this time, but Mr. Estee says they are
now in the possession of Mrs. Sather's
attorneys and that ends it so far as we
are concerned."
\V. J. Dingeo did not know to-night that
the papers had been found and returned.
"I have paid no attention to the mat
ter," he said, "but if the attorneys saÂ»y
that Mrs. Sather has what she wanted, I
suppose ft is true. I have not seen Col
onel Evans for two years and do not
know where he is at present. This case
did not concern me."
The hiding place of the papers since
they disappeared is something that no one
will discuss. A. A. Moore refers to Mr.
Sanborn, ,but no one is anxious to disclose
the secret.

LITTLE WAS SAID ABOUT
HIS DEATH AND BURIAL
PASSING OF
THOS.CARTER,
MILLIONAIRE
His Romantic Attach
ment for Miss Red
mond Recalled.
If She Is Not "Remembered"
In His Will a Suit Will
Follow.
- Thomas Carter, the millionaire car
builder of Newark, is dead and buried,
and the chances are that nine-tenths of
the business men who met him da.ly on
California and Montgomery streets do
not know that he has passed over to the
great beyond.
Even the lady who knew him best and
â¢who for fifteen years was his closest
friend, only heard of his demise In time to
â hurry to the undertakers and get a mo
mentary gaze at his faoe before the coffin
was closed forever.
Thomas Carter was on the street as
usual lat^t Wednesday. lie chatted with
some of his frierifls on the corner of Mont
gomery and California streets during the
early hours of the day, and then crossed
over to Collins' shortly afterward and
joined a business associate In a drink.
Then he said he was going out to the
hospital to have an operation performed
on a cancer tn his throat. lie got on a
passing car and that was tho last any of
Ills ohi friend.* ever ?aw of him. lie died
on Friday morning last, and that after
xioon he was removed to undertaking par
lors on Mission Btreet and was buried in
Holy Cro.-s Cemetery on Sunday. A
liearse and two carriages formed the
funeral cortege, and the interment was of
the most private character.
The cur-building firm of Carter Bros.,
Is'ewark. AJameda County, !s known from
one end of the United States to the other.
The cars of the Southern Pacific and
Central Pacific Railroad are nearly all
turned out of their workshops, and nearly
every street railroad in California has
been equipped by that firm.
The deceased was a partner of the late
Senator Fair and A. E. Davis in the build
ing of the narrow gauge road to Santa
Cruz and in many other ventures. He
came to this country from County Gal
way, Ireland, many years ago. and was 58
rears and 9 months old when he died. Mr.
Carter was an inveterate smoker, and It
â¢was that habit that was the indirect
cause of his death.
Although Thomas Carter never married
there was quite a romance In his life,
and the chances are that when his will
becomes public it will be found that a
large portion of his wraith has been left
to a most estimable lady of this; city.
Nearly fiftpen years ago Mr. Carter met
Miss Mollie Redmond and fell in love

BLANCHE RATES WILL
REJOIN THE FRAWLEYS
A BALDWIN
SEASON OF
SIX WEEKS
Will Appear in a Series
of Famous Dramatic
Successes.
San Francisco Favorite Is
Much Improved by Her
Recent Experience.
Blanche Bates, the Idol of Ban Fran
cisco theater-goers, who won her fame in
this city as leading lady of the old Fraw
ley company, and who is regarded as the
standard by which leading ladles who
have followed hf-r must be Judged. Is
coming back to San Francisco to amuse
and delight her many admirers.
She will arrive here on Sunday next
and rejoin the Frawley company, taking
the position in which she had so many
successes. This Is certainly good news
for the thousands Â©f San Franciscans
who sincerely regretted her departure for
Eastern fields. .-._.. *Â»_.
There Is a story of interest behind this
row move in the Frawley company.
It will bo remembered that Miss Bates
was engaged to play the leading lady
Â«art in the supposed great war drama
*Chattanooga," which was produced at
Chicago' during the past summer. It was
a play in which the Judgment of the man
agement was not accepted by the pub
lic and "Chattanooga" proved a lament
able failure. Tho critics of the Windy
Cltv said that the acting of Miss Bates
was about all tho production had to

Following this experience, which was a
severe one, the littk lady did not find it
necessary to seek engagements. The of
fers airne to her. Sho iinally accepted a
proposition from Auguntin Daly to play
prominent parts and assume the position
of understudy to Ada Kenan. The con
tract stipulated thnt "our Blanche" was
not to appear in any part which was not
suited to her abilities.^
It transpires that Mr. Daly could not
meet his compact and Miss Bates was cast
In a part which she declined to undertake.
The situation was disagreeable and she
opened correspondence with T. Daniel
Frawley looking to the acceptance of her
old position for a short season at least.
It fa unnecessary to say that Mr. Fraw
ley was only too glad to talk business and
Mr Daly found it advisable to give his
California prize a temporary' release, stip

of the continent. iMr. Daly, was in an

with her. They became fa ft friends, and
It did not take"them long to find out that
each had a temper of their own. After a
fierce quarrel Miss Redmond vowed sho
would never marry him. but would al
ways remain his friend, and Carter re
plied. "Well, if that Is the case. I will
never marry, either."
Things went along In this groove for
years, ar.d then another quarrel arose.
Then Miss Redmond found that she
wanted to marry, and when Carter re
fused she placed her affairs in the hands
of Henry E. Hlghton, tho attorney. The
result was a suit In the Superior Court
for $150,000 damages for breach of prom
ise. The case never came to trial, but
was settled out of court. Certain papers
changed hands and certain agreements
were made, the nature of which are only
known to Miss Mcdmond and her attor
ney. One thing has leaked out, ana that
Is "that Mr. Carter promised to remember
have not as yet completed their reports |
It is Impossible to give an exact summary j
of the total enrollment In the day and |
night schools. It Is found, however, by |
adding the aggregate of the attendance I
of the eighty schools which have reported !
and comparing it with the aggregate of
the same schools last year, that there has
been a gain of 497 pupils. When the crea- !
tion of several new schools is taken into i
account, which were not In existence last
year at this time, and their roll of 455
pupils is added to the 497 already men- j
tioned, it brings the total up to nearly
1000 more pupils than attended the schools
of San Francisco in 1597. It .is quite pos- j
sible that the number will exceed the 1000 i
mark when the remaining schools are
finally reported to the clerk of the School 1
Board.
The gains and losses of various schools
in the number of their pupils is shown in
the following table, comparison being
made In all cases between the present
year and last year:

admirers of tho only Blanche can con
gratulate themselves.
That Is what Mr. Frawloy was doing
last night in his dressing-room at tho Co
lumbia.
"Thin is one of the paramount things
that has happened in the theatrical world
for a long time," saJd he. "It means a
great dc-nl to me and I am surf it will
be very pleasant news to the people of
this oity, who appreciated Miss Bates*

assisted her in her struggles for recogni

"Miss Bates will arrive here on Sunday
next, and at tho close of the Frawley
company's season at the Columbia the
organization will go to Los Angeles, when
we will present 'The Prisoner of Zenda,'
returning here two weeks later. Prepara
tions will be then made for producing a
series of high-class plays to be presented
at the Baldwin Theater, during a season

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 31, 1898.
Miss Redmond substantially in his will,
and also said that his brother Martin
knew all about the arrangements he had
made.
It was only by the merest accident that
Miss Redmond heard of the death of her
lift-long friend. She knew that he was
to have an operation performed, but she
did not know when it was to take plaÂ«e.
When, therefore, she learned of his death
Bhe was prostrated. With a friend she
hurried to the undertaking parlors and a
few minu.es after she arrived the coffin
lid was screwed down. No mourners were
present and no friends of the deceased
were there to pay their respects to his

'The Prisoner of Zenda,' 'Love In Har

"We can look for some exceptionally
pood work from Miss Bates in this en
gagement, particularly in 'The Last
Word' and 'Love In Harness,' two of
Miss Rehan's great successes, in which
Miss Bates was understudy. This special
training will bo of great advantage to her
and the young lady's admirers will re-ap
the unexpected benefits therefrom. At the
close of the Beason witn the Frawley
Company she will return to New York
and resume her position with the Daly
Company."
The Frawley Company will be further
strengthened by tho addition of six new
people, among whom will be the bright
and capable actress, Lucille La Verne
who has resigned her position as leading
lady of the Clay Clement Company, to
join Frawley. Frawley refuses to divulge
the names of the others on the ground
that he wants to give the people of (3an

The fluctuation in the attendance on the
various evening schools during the two
years is marked, more so, perhaps, than
in the day schools. The Business Even
ing has lost. 41 pupils, while the Horace
Mann shows a remarkable painâ los
pupils. The heaviest loss is that shown by
the Lincoln Evening, which has IG3 less
pupils this year than last.
The nine evening schools which have so
far reported show that the average at
tendance this year is almost the same as
last year, the total attendance of the nlno
being 2943 in 1897 and 2940 in 1898. It is fair
therefore to assume that the remaining
evening schools will show about the same
averages, the loss in one being taken up
in another. There has probably been
neither gain nor material loss in the at
tendance upon the night schools.

MRS. CORDELIA BOTKIN
WILL NOT BE INDICTED
She Seizes an Opportunity
to Give Timely Advice
to the Police.
Mrs. A. Rauof Tells What She
Knows of the Accused Woman.
Dunning's Gay Life.
The police of this city have begun
their task of attempting to weave
around Mrs. Cordelia Botkin a web of
Incriminating evidence. Very little
material progress has been made, al
though the local authorities are forti
fied with the scraps of evidence sup
plied by Detective McVey from Dela
ware. The Chief of Police is summon
ing every one who has thus far fig
ured in the case with a promise of fur
nishing a clew or adding a fact that
may have a bearing upon the solution
of the mystery. No definite testimony
Involving the guilt of Mrs. Botkin has
been obtained and the inspection of
the poisoned candy and the bonbon box
has tended to weaken rather than
strengthen the case of the prosecution.
There were in the tragic story yester
day three important developments.
The first resulted from the interview
with Mrs. Botkin which was published
exclusively yesterday in The Call. This
interview was the first free expression
made by the accused woman since her
arrest, and it cleared away for the first
time the obscurity of her position and
her plan of defense. The police and
the public knew this morning that Mrs.
Botkin will base her fight for life upon
an alibi. The second important de
velopment of the day was the dramatic
appearance of Mrs. A. Raouf, the
woman in whose home Mrs. Botkin
spent many hours on a bed of danger
ous illness while the plot against Mrs.
Dunning and Mrs. Deane was being
hatched. A day of varied incident and
s,im? exciting scenes closed with an
abortive attempt of the authorities to
indict Mrs. Botkin before the local
Grand Jury.
Shortly after her arrest Mrs. Botkin
made a detailed statement of her move
ments to the Chief of Police. In this
statement the accused woman confined
her recital to the days during which
her actions may have been of moment.
The material part of her story began
with July 27, when she left this city
for Stockton to visit her husband and
son. She remained at Stockton until
the evening of July 30, when she re
turned to her apartments at the Vic
toria in this city. Illness confined her
to her rooms until the afternoon of Au
gust 3, when she paid a visit to a friend
during which she accounts for her
movements. On the afternoon of Au-
Just 4, at 3:30 o'clock, she took the
Tiburon ferry steamer on her way to
St. Helena.
Mrs. Botkin explained ever}' move
ment that could suggest itself as ma
terial. She denied emphatically that
she had ever at any time purchased
the smallest amount of candy at
Stockton. This statement is in the
possession of the Chief of Police and
has not yet been shaken in the slight
est particular. Every fact in It has
been verified and no one has appeared
to say positively that during the period
covered the accused woman did any
thing that she has not freely admitted.
The exclusive publication in The Call
of her assertion of innocence and her
plan of defense has seriously disturbed
the other morning newspapers of this
city.
A representative of one of them
sought and obtained yesterday an in
terview â with Mrs. Botkin, who inform
ed the reporter that her interview pub
lished in The Call was In every partic
ular absolutely correct. In the course
of a general conversation not bearlne
directly upon the case, Mrs. Botkin
digressed to discuss the episode sup
plied by J. E. Fennessee. The accused
woman remarked that every one agreed
that she could not have been thÂ»
woman who acted so strangely at
the ferry postal station. That being
the case, Mrs. Botkin suggested that it
might be a wise endeavor on the Dart
of the detectives to try and discover
who the mysterious woman really was.
They might be rewarded for their suc
cess, she said, by discovering the cruel
assassin who had taken the liveÃ of
Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane. Fur
ther than this Mrs. Botkin declined
to talk, except to say that she was well
and hopeful of the outcome.
Early yesterday morning Mrs. A.
Rauof arrived at police headquarters,
accompanied by Detective Wren. Mrs.
Rauof came all the way from Healds
burg to tell the police what she knows
of the affairs of Mrs. Botkin. The
visitor was closeted for hours with the
Chief of Police, but after her long talk
was over she had added no material
fact to the evidence and had imparted
no information that has not already
been published. She verified Mrs.
Botkin's assertion that she had been
ill at Stockton from the morning of
July 28 to the evening of July 30.
Mrs. Botkin was occasionally hysterical
and Mrs. Rauof thought unusually
suspicious on incidental matters.
As Mrs. Rauof very frankly confesses
that she is not friendly with Mrs. Bot
kin, her construction of the latter's ac
tions will probably be taken for what
it is worth. Mrs. Rauof also told the
Chief of Police that Mrs. Botkin once
sought from her $500 with which to as
sist John P. Dunning in his necessi
ties. This naturally led to a discus
sion of the relations existing between
Dunning and Mrs. Botkin, but Mrs.
Rauof could tell nothing more than
was already generally known. Dun
ning and the accused woman were very
friendly. Whatever -else there may
have been between them Mrs. Rauof
did not know.
In her interview with the Chief of
Police yesterday Mrs. Rauof carried
the authorities no nearer to a solution
of tho mystery than other witnesses
have done. She knew nothing tWat
shed light as actual evidence upon the
murder. She knew, as many others
know, and Dunning admits, that he and
Mrs. Botkfn were very friendly. But
Dunning was friendly with several
other women, who have not yet been
found by the police. Dunning was a
frequent visitor to the race tracks, to
Ingleside and Emeryville. He had
passes to both tracks and used them
very often. He sought and obtained
mnny passes for his women friends.
Horsemen, gamblers, Jockej'B and track
follower's will tell the police, If inquiry
be rrnde. that Dunning went often to
the tracks, but not often in the com
pany of the same women.
He admits himself that he was on
tormp of intimacy with at least three,
and the frequenters of the racecourses
will say that he seemed to be more than
friendly with several others. Who these
women were the authorities have yet to
learn. As a woman's jealousy is the
only assigned motive for the terrifying
crime at Dover it is not improbable
that some other of Dunning's many
women friends may have been quite
as jealous as Mrs. BotKln is represent
ed to have been. If the police pursue
Mrs. L Rauof, Once Friend and Companion of Mrs. Botkin, and Detective McVey
Compare Notes While Enjoying Lunch."
th^ir inquiries upon this line, which
promises to be fruitful, they will
find also that Dunning and his women
companions were frequent visitors to
the winerooms at the tracks. This fact
and a little judicious investigation may
lead to the discovery oi the mysterious
blonde woman of whom so much has
been said and of whom the police know
nothing.
While this field of Inquiry is as yet
untouched the case against Mrs. Bot
kin is daily becoming weaker. There
is now practically no evidence to show
that the poisoned candy was pur
chased at Stockton. Neither the box
nor its contents answers the descrip
tion given by the people at Stockton.
The candy manufacturer has said that
the box contained some chocolate
wafers. -with a white button on each.
There are chocolate wafers in the poi
soned candy, but they have no white
button. The manufacturer declared
that his strange customer placed a
large quantity of home-made candy in
the box. In the exhibit brought by
Detective McVey there is not a single
piece of home-made candy, and the
box is still almost full of the deadly
sweetmeats.
The discrepancies are carried still
further when the wrapper is inspected.
The candy manufacturer is positive
that blue wrapping paper was used.
The exhibit of death was folded in buff
colOTed paper. The box sold to the
mysterious unknown woman at Stock
ton had a candy tongs. That which the
Dunning family received had none. It
has been noted also that tho handwrit
ing on the wrapper is very unlike that
of Mrs. Botkin in those examples which
have already been published. When
these discrepancies are noted in con-
Junction with the fact that the strange
woman of Stockton has not been iden
tified as Mrs. Botkin, the case becomes
more mysterious than ever.
It is even said now that Frank Gat
trell, the clerk who sold the candy at
Stockton, will not be summoned by the
police. There is a possibility that the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 81, 1898.
whole matter may be simplified and
the uncertainty removed by Charles Le
Grand, the candy maker of the "Wave"
store. Le Grand is positive that he
can identify the candy made by him.
There is a defect in the mold used at
the store and Le Grand knows that the
product of his shop had a certain in
dividuality. By summoning him it
would seem that the police could at
least determine once for all whether or
not the poisoned candy was bought at
the Stockton store.
As the authorities progressed in
their inquiry yesterday they became
convinced that it would be a wise plan
to have Mrs. Botkin indicted by the
local Grand Jury. Before the day was
over the District Attorney and the po
lice realized that they were on the
point of committing a serious if not
fatal blunder. The authorities in this
city do not wish to try the accused
woman in this State. A trial here
means a tremendous expense to Cali
fornia. Witnesses cannot be forced to
come from Delaware to California and
if any one should refuse there is no
law to force them here. In addition to
this, the local prosecutors do not
possess evidence enough against Mrs.
Botkin to warrant an indictment.
Before the District Attorney and the
police realized where they were drift
ing Subpoenaes had been served on
several persons who might be wit
nesses of value. The witnesses were on
hand and the Grand Jury was in ses-
sion last night when the decision was
reached not to attempt to secure an
indictment. A new tangle of technical
ity would have been created and no
advantage would have been won. Mrs.
Botkin will be retained In custody
through oth*r means.
Her attorneys were eager to see the
authorities fall into the pitfall, and
they are chagrined at the escape. There
are several days more, however, in
which to make mistakes. The extra
dition papers will not arrive here for
a week. There was dHay in securing
affidavits. Information was received
from Wilmington last night showing
that the last obtained was that of
John P. Dunning, husband of one of
the murdered women.
GRAY HAIRS TO BE
SAVED FROM SORROW
Every Effort Being Made to Keep the
Aged Parents of Mrs. Botkin
From Knowing Her Disgrace
If the kind intentions of friends and
loving children prevail the last days of
Colonel and Mrs. Brown, the aged par
ents of Mrs. Botkin, will not be sad
dened by the shadow of crime and scan
dal which involves their daughter.
Since the first publication of the ac
cused woman's name in connection with
the Dunning case her sisters have kept
sdl the newspapers from reaching their
parents. Friends of the family have
been warned not to refer to the trouble
when visiting the old people.
Mr. and Mrs. Brown have long since
passed the allotted span of four-score
years and it is feared by their children
that they would not long survive the
shock which would surely follow a
knowledge of the charge against their
daughter.
CATHOLIC TRUTH SOCIETY.
The ladies of the Catholic Truth Society
are continuing their good work among
the soldiers at the Presidio.
"We are greatly in need of funds to
carry on the work," said Mrs. R. J. Byrne
yesterday. "The impression has gone out
that since the war is practically over
there is no longer any need of funds for
the society. We know the war is at an
end, but our labor is not, for as long as
there is a soldier here. Just so long will
there be something for the Catholic Truth
Society to do. We propose to keep the
tent open and to do this we need funds."
The society malls on an average 1000
letters each day for the men, besides sup
plying paper and envelopes. Major Rice
of the California Heavy Artillery has
kindly furnished an orderly each day for
the ladies in charge of the tent and he is
always on duty.
There is a petition being circulated by
the men asking Father Yorke to repeat
his splendid lecture of last Sunday. Ihe
young ladies of the society are doing a
noble work in visiting the convalescents
In their quarters. They have been given
permits by the various commanding of
ficers and are accompanied by an orderly
when they make their visits. They carry
the men delicacies and attend to their
many want:?. The society is furnishing
a large quantity of milk to the different
regiments and they are greatly in n.-.-d
of all that can be sent them by their
friends. Father Yorke will probably de
liver a lecture at the Metropolitan Hall
shortly for the purpose of raising funds
for the society.
Delicacies for the sick soldiers have
b4en donated by the following persons:
Miss B. Tobin, Mrs. Shea. Mrs. Gardner,
Mrs. J. F. Sullivan, Mrs. Richard Queen,
Mrs. Eleanor Martin, Mrs. Egan, Miss
Nolan, Mrs. Wilson, Miss Marchand, Mrs.
Mayo and Mrs. Luke Robinson. The so
ciety hopes that a ready response will be
made by its many friends to its call for
funds,

PICTURESQUE ROUTE CHOSEN
THE HIGHEST POINTS ARE TO
BE CROSSED.
Surveyed So As to Afford Magnifi
cent Views of All Surround
ing Objects ot
Interest.
Thoso who enjoy equestrian exercise
will learn with satisfaction that the Com-
missioners of Golden Gate Park have de
cided to build a bridle path to the Cliff
House for their exclusive use. At a re
cent conrerence of members of the board
It was decided that In view of the fact
that drives, roadways, bicycle paths and
footpaths had been provided It was time
to do something for that part of the
community who are horseback riders.
In accordance with that decision Presi
dent A. B. Spreckels of the commission
and Park Superintendent Mcl,aren sur
veyed the proposed path yesterday after
noon. It will be constructed fourteen
feet wide, and beginning not far from the
lodge, will pass over the highest points In
the great play ground, with the excep
tion of Strawberry Hill, and end at the
Cliff House.
The route selected will cross the mam
drive three times, and at various alti
tudes will afford magnificent views of
this beautiful public domain. Its prin
cipal points of Interest include the speed
track, the main drive, the museum, the
proposed site of the new music stand and
concourse, the ocean and Sutro Heights.
One of the great attractions of the
bridle path will be the picturesque sec
tions through which it will passâ portions
oÂ£ the park almost entirely unknown to
the general public. It will be diversified
with open reaches, shady lanes, rustic
bridges and as nearly as possible laid out
in imitation of the famous driving
course In Central Park, New York. It is
expected that by reason of the superior
beauties of San Francisco's celebrated
outing place it can be eventually made
even more attractive than that after
which It is to be modeled.
Work on the path will be commenced at
once and completed as soon as possible.
WANTS HIS FOUNTAIN BACK.
Dr. Cogswell Bequests the Beturn
of Statuary Presented to Golden
Gate Park.
The venerable and persistent Dr. Cogs
well Is still engaged In having sore trials
with those famous Cogswell plug-hat
fountains that will not "stay put."
The general public has settled down to
the comfortable belief that with. the tur
moil which followed the destruction by
vandals of the fountain at the Intersec
tion of MiCrket and Davis streets, the
painful Incident was closed. However,
the Doctor was not so certain of this
proposition.
He had a hazy idea that somewhere
there was one of his loved images se
questered to the detriment of the name of
Cogswell. He dreamed and thought <*f
the matter until he unearthed the book
lnwpichgift fountains of the Cogswellian
brand were recorded, and there after
checking back ho located the missing Idol.
It was ancient history, but it made the
Doctor exceedingly wroth. What was his
chagrin and indignation to find that
eleven years ago he had presented the
Commissioners of Golden Gate Park with
a brand-new fresh-painted fountain, In
tended to beam down upon coming gen
erations from some conspicuous point in
the park.
The Doctor thought some warm senti
ments and hastened to put them on pa
per before they became cold. Then he
placed them in an asbestos envelope and
sent the hot epistle to the Park Commis
sioners.
It was read yesterday by the officials.
The letter said that if the statue was not
erected at once In the park it must be re
turned to the donor forthwith.
What the Commissioners said was a
different story that can't be printed.
They sent the irate doctor a communica
tion* in which he was Informed in diplo
matic language that the quicker he took
back his fountain the sooner they would
have the use of some very valuable stor
age room that had been unavailable
j eleven years.
The question that will now deeply con
! cern the public is as to where that resur
rected statue fountain is liable to be
planted next.

A SHORTAGE IN CANNED SALMON
Yesterday's advices from the North confirm the large shortage of this
year's pack of canned salmon. The summary of the reports on the 1898
pack is as follows:
British Columbia 400,000 cases.
Alaska ~ 840000 cases.
Puget Sound 260,000 cases.
Sacramento River spring pack.- 20,000 cases.
Columbia River spring pack 360,000 cases.
Total 1,880,000 cases.
The fall pack in 1597 on the Pacific Coast was about 300,000 cases. It is
estimated that the pack will not be over 200,000 cases this year, making
the total shortage of this year's pack over 1,000,0000 cases. Most of the
canners, expecting a very large pack, sold futures *at low prices and many
of the districts are heavily oversold. The shortage of 600,000 cases in
British Columbia leaves large markets uncovered. The largest Alaska
canners did not sell futures and having packed within 10 per cent of the
pack of 1897, are in a comfortable position. The Puget Sound has sold fu
tures to the extent of 135,000 cases for export and 400,000 for domestic mar
kets. The export sales will be filled, having been made by canners who
made a comparatively good pack, but not over 30 per cent deliveries will be
made on the domestic sales.
The Sacramento spring and fall packs are sold, the Columbia River
canners are at least 100,000 cases oversold.
UPHEAVAL IN THE
TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION
THE LATE ELECTION OF OFFI
CERS DECLARED ILLEGAL.
At the meeting of San Francisco Typo
graphical Union Sunday afternoon the
resignations of W. B. Benolst, who has
for several years been financial secretary,
and Terry McGowan, who has served sev
eral terms in the exalted position of ser
geant-at-arms, were called for.
The office of financial secretary of the
local union carries with it a substantial
salary and as the duties are comparative
ly light It is hotly contested for each year.
Mr. Benoist has served several terms and
was always considered a faithful and effi
cient officer. This year he was unusually
anxious to be elected, as he had an
nounced himself a candidate for State
Printer on the Democratic ticket, and he
thought his standing In the union would
pave his pathway to political fame with
roses. He enlisted all his friends to can
vass for votes, but soon found that he
was up against a harder game than he
thought. The result of the election
showed him to be winner by thirty-two
votes, but fraud was at once openly
charged by his opponents. â 
A formal protest was filed by Harry
Gibb, a defeated candidate for delegate to
the International convention, and an in
vestigating committee was appointed. The
committee found that several members
had voted who were In "bad standing
and not entitled to a vote. hen an at
tempt was made to prove this by the
books they were found to be in such a
chaotic condition that. an expert was em
ployed, but after vainly struggling with
them for three days he handed them back
to the committee, saying that he could
do nothing with them. was procured to
Â° Sufficient evidence was procured to
prove that eighty-six fraudiuent^ votes
had been cast, and Mr. Benoist accord
ingly waived the right of trial and hand
ed in his resignation. Evidence was
brought to show that "Terry" McGowan
had been an active factor in bringing
"stutters'" to the polls, and 4 things were
made so warm that the fiery little door
kceDer handed in his resignation, which
was accepted with applause. It Is not
definitely known whether Benoist Is
short in his accounts or not. but all are
satisfied that if there Is any deficit It is
due wholly ;to carelessness and will : not
exceed the amount of his bond. He says
that he does not know just how . he
stands, but if there is any deficit he will
set It right at once.
The election has been declared illegal
and the old officers will hold the - chairs
until new ones are elected. . The date for
the re-election has been set for Wednes
day, September 7. J. J.O Neil has been
appointed temporary secretary.
Alhambra Theater Opening.
The advance sale at the Alhambra The
ater has been something enormous and
far beyond the expectations of the man
agement. The bill for the opening week
is undoubtedly the great attraction. MÂ«".

amusing and entertaining act. Mr. and
Mrs. Tom Mclntosh will offer a sketch
which Is said to be clever. Hyde and

tain to make a hit. while the Three
Rossis will satisfy the admirers of
