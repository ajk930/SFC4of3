CERVERA`S FLEET PENNED
IN SANTIAGO HARBOR
COMMODORE
SCHLEY HAS
SO REPORTED
There Is No Escape for the
Dons from the Ships
* on Guard.
Obpyrtgrhted, 189 S. by James Gordon Bennett.
MOLE ST. NICHOLAS,
Hayti, May 29. â i can state
positively that Commodore
Schley has a part, if not
all, of the Spanish fleet
bottled up in Santiago har
bor. This had been sus
pected for several days,
but it was not defi
definitely known until this
morning, when Captain
Sigsbee of the St. Paul,
who has been cruising off
the harbor for the past
week, steamed close enough
todistinctly see two cruisers
of the Vizcaya class and
two torpedo-boats lying
just inside the mouth of
the harbor. It is believed
that the rest of Cervera's
squadron is also there.
The St. Paul has been watching
Santiago for eight days. Sigsbee
thinks that two Spanish torpedo
boats ventured out of the harbor
Saturday night to attack the St.
Paul, but, anticipating such a
move, he changed his position
every night in order that they
could not locate him. To-day
Commodore Schley took up a posi
tion with his entire squadron to
prevent the escape of Cervera.
He hopes the dons will come out
and fight. The opposing fleets are
about of equal strength.
The Herald-Call tug passed
Sampson's fleet of eighteen ves
sels fifteen miles east of Cardenas
Friday at 3 o'clock in the after
noon, headed west. It is probable
that Admiral Cervera will remain
Jnside and postpone an engagement
indefinitely, but the blockade will
be effectively maintained.
NEW YORK, May 29.â The
Herald's Washington correspon
dent says: Spain's fleet is
definitely located and securely
locked inside the Santiago harbor.
This is now an official fact. In ad
dition to the Herald's cable from
Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti, giving
this gratifying information, I am
authorized by the Navy Depart
ment to state that Commodore
Schley has reported to the Secre
tary of the Navy stating definitely
that he has personally observed
Cervera's fleet in the harbor.
Commodore Schley's message to
the department is brief. The
text has not been given out for
publication, but Lieutenant Whit
tlesy, the officer on duty at the
Navy Department, acting under
previous instructions from Secre-

U. S. REGULARS ON THE WAY TO CAMP RICHMOND.
The information was cabled
from Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti,
and was taken there direct from
Santiago by the scouting vessel
St. Paul.
Cable messages were sent to
Admiral Sampson at Key West
to-night advising him of the grati
fying intelligence conveyed by
Commodore Schley's message.
This was done in order to prepare
him for the important work which
will now devolve upon his squad
ron in co-operation with the army
in laying siege to Havana. Com
plete and definite arrangements
will be decided upon by the Presi
dent after consultation with the
war board and members of his
cabinet to-morrow morning.
Admiral Sampson is holding a
large fleet off Havana ready to
clear a landing for the troops as
soon as the War Department gives
the signal. All the transports
necessary for the movement of the
largest force that may be sent are
now at Gulf ports, and the Gov
ernment is paying $25,000 a day
for their services until their work
is finished. They will be used at
the earliest possible opportunity,
which it is believed will be as soon
as Schley solves the mystery of
Santiago harbor.

Commodore Schley Reports That He
Has Admiral Cervera Safely

WASHINGTON, May 30.â At 12:30

Navy Department received a dis
patch from Commodore Schley an
nouncing definitely that he had located

ron In the bay of Santlgo de Cuba. The
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, MAY 30, 1898.
TWENTY THOUSAND TROOPS
FOR THE PHILIPPINES
Call Office, Riggs House. Washington, May 29.
The President to-day took highly significant action in increasing the number of troops to be sent to the
Philippines from 12,000 to" 20,000. Urgent orders were issued to the commissary department to provide 1 .iforms,
tents, rations and equipment, and the ordnance bureau to supply arms and ammunition. In both cases the offi
cials were directed to place the prompt equipment of the additional troops for the Philippines expedition before
all other considerations, and to sacrifice all other interest?, that might interfere with the early departure of Admiral
Dewey's re-enforcements.
The 8000 additional troops will be embarked at the earliest moment, but it does not follow that the volun
teers now being mobilized on the Pacific Coast wii,l be sent to Manila. The War Department has developed a
theory regarding the special characteristics of men desirable for service in the Philippines, and while details are not
given to the public, it is stated that great care will be taken in the selection of this new contingent and that it will
be drawn from various p?rts of the country.
The distance from the port of embarkation will not be an important consideration, for the reason that
troops can be sent from^any State to San Francisco before their equipment can be made reaJV. The mainspring
of the President's action in enlarging the expedition to the Philippines is believed to be his desire first that the
foothold of the United States in the islands shall be absolutely secure, especially in the event of an cirly peace,
and. second, that good order shall be maintained there throughout the occupancy of the islands by the American
forces. The President dreads the possible results of a" insurgent victory over the Spanish troops, which might
be followed by bruta! excesses that Admiral Dewey with his present force would be powerless to prevent. The eyes
of the world are now upon us, the President realizes, and our responsibility for the proper conduct o- affairs in
the Philippines, where we have practically disarmed the Spanish authorities, is a llÂ£a#y one. It must be discharged
in such a way that no European nation can find an excuse for interfering.
I commodore states that he has seen and
! recognized the vessels of the Spanish
; fleet.
"While the navy officials have been
' morally certain for several days that
j Cervera's squadron was In the harbor
j of Santiago, the official announcement
I from Commodore Schley was received
by the officers on duty at the depart
ment with intense satisfaction. Assur
ance is now doubly sure that the Span
ish fleet is bottled up and that the cork
is in the bottle.
It is not believed that Admiral Cer
vera will attempt to escape from the
predicament in which he now finds
himself, as such a course would surely
result in the destruction of his vessels
and the loss of many lives precious to
Spain. The suggestion is made, how
ever, that the Spaniards may blow up
the ships rather than have them fall
into the hands of Schley, as they cer
tainly will if they remain in the harbor.
The definiteness of Commodore
Schley's dispatch would indicate that
he has effected a landing near San
tiago and made a personal investigation
of the harbor. It would be impossible
from the entrance to the bay definitely
to see and recognize the Spanish ves
sels, but by effecting a landing at some
point on either side of the entrance a
vantage point could be gained very
likely from which the entire harbor
could be examined. In all probability
Commodore Schley or one of his trust
ed officials has succeeded in performing
this hazardous undertaking in order to
obtain the valuable information con
tained in his dispatch.
It is impossible owing to the lateness
of the hour, to obtain any official ex
pression upon the news from Commo
dore Schley. What effect the certainty
that Cervera is practically helpless will
have upon the plans of the naval sta
tion with referr c to the invasion of
Cuba can only be conjectured. The
transportation of land forces to the
island, it Is understood was delayed be
cause of the uncertainty concerning
the location of the Spanish squadron.
If that understanding in correct the
probability of an early Invasion of
Cuba is strong. It is not unlikely that
the movement of troops, which has
been delayed from time to time, will be
gin this' week, and that before the end
of the week the United States forces
will have obtained a substantial foot
hold upon Cuban soil.
WILL SINK HULKS IN
THE CHANNEL
Plans for Penning Admiral Cervera's
Fleet in Santiago
Harbor.
NEW YORK. May 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: "I have no reason to change
my belief that Admiral Cervera is still
in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba. I
have heard from Commodore Schley.
All that I can say is that he is off the
harbor of Panting. "
These statements were . made to me
to-night by Secretary Long, and it "g
the first announcement as to the o--ra
ting fleets recently made by him. The
Secretary's advices from Schley were
rc-eived yesterday, as stated in the
I~erald this morninp. ' vlng been
transmitted from Kingston, Jamaica,
where they wÂ«rÂ« fllÂ«d by C!u.nt.a.!n CL R.
Cotton, commanding the auxiliary
cruiser Harvard. Commodore Schley
did not communicate with the depart
ment to-day, but it is understood to
night that he will inform Washington
whether or not he has satisfied himself
that Cervera is in the harbor and what
steps he has taken to prevent his de
parture.
The fact that the Secretary and his
official advisers stick so pertinaciously
to the belief that Admiral Cervera has
remained at Santiago de Cuba illus
trates the confidence th-^y have in their
source of information. Their - mfi
dence may also be due to messages re
ceived from Consuls stationed along
the Isthmian coast and among the
West Indies, some of which reached
the department to-day, that the Span
ish fleet had not been sighted in the
neighborhood of thtir ports. While
this information Is perhaps negative in
character, the officials say that it indi
cates that Admiral Cervera has not
been cruising in the Caribbean Sea for
a week at least; otherwise the Consuls
or scouts would most certainly have
picked him up and have reported con
firmation to the department. It is
known that the Spanish fleet put into
Santiago ten days ago to make repairs
and take on board coal, of which they
stood in great need, according to reli
able information furnished by Consul
Smith, stationed at Curacoa, and state
ments made by Captain R. B. Osbon in
an interview published by the Herald
this morning.
The department has been advised
that the reason why he failed to sail
at an earlier date was that he sighted
ships in the offing which he took to be
American armorclads, hut which were
in reality scouting ships. Commodore
Schley arrived off the coast of Santiago
on Wednesday, he having remained at
Cienfuegos until Tuesday night.
It developed to-day that the cause of
Commodore Schley's failure to earlier
sail for Santiago was his confidence
that the Spanish fleet was lying at an
chor in the harbor of Cienfuegos. In
fact, in an official dispatch to the de
Centinuwd on Second Page.
FAR EAST
AS A SCENE
OF STRIFE
Russia Competing With
Great Britain for Amer-
ica's Friendship.
NEW YORK, May 29.â Trie
Herald's Washington correspon
dent telegraphs: Fearing an ef
fort on the part of Spain to pre
cipitate foreign complications by
ceding to France or some other
power the Philippine Islands,
American representatives abroad
are under instructions to closely
watch negotiations of Spanish
diplomats. While the authorities
profess to have no knowledge of
the reported protest of Germany
to the cession of the Philippines
to France, it is known that Em
bassador White at Berlin, and
Embassador Porter in Paris have .
been carefully investigating the
entire subject, and they are con
vinced that in view of the atti
tude of Europe a transfer will
not be effected.
It if? conceded in all quarters here
that it would be a sharp diplomatic trick
for the Madrid Government to attain
the support of another power in return
for such cession.
It was pointed out to-day that Spain
is still proprietor of the Philippines, for
Rear Admiral Dewey. representing the
American Government only has con
trol of Cavite and Manila Bay. and in
ternational law declares that In a con
quest of country, sovereignty only ex
tends as far as the conquest extends,
and conquest gives the Invading enemy
dominion as long as he retains his mil
itary possession. Furthermore, the
holding of conquered territory, is re
garded in the eyes of international law
as merely military occupation until its
fate shall be determined by treaty of
peace.
The effect of a transfer of the
Philippine Islands to France would
make that Government an ally of
Spain, and is what tha latter desires.
Bussia would prefer that France get
the islands rather than the United
States for the reason that the policy
of this Government would throw
American and British interests in the
same channel, undoubtedly resulting
in an alliance of the two govern
ments in such interests.
Jealous of American trade, Germany
would prefer; as dispatches .his morn
ing indicate, that the Philippines be
governed by several powers of Europe,
and that they never pass under the
sovereignty of the United States or
Frarkce. It is no secret now that Pres
ident? McKinley desired to escape from
these prospective complications. Had
he been guided solely by his own
wishes, I understand, that he would
have instructed Rear Admiral Dewey
to withdraw from the ; Philippines
as soon as he had destroyed the Span
ish men-of-war. The sentiment of the
country, however, required the con
quest of the islands, and the pressure
was so strong that the President was
unable to resist it.
Now. ; that troops have' been ordered
to the : far East and that ; Rear Admiral
Dewey ? has ' retained 'â¢, possession ; of ; Ca
vltÂ« and Manila. Hay. tVi<Â» PnÂ»MÂ«nÂ».wÂ«Â«

come to the conclusion that the United
States will be required to take and to
hold the Philippines at least until a
treaty of peace' is signed. That is as
far as he cares to go in outlining his
policy at this time. And in following
such a policy, he appreciates that it is
necessary to oppose any foreign inter
vention looking to the wresting of the
islands- away from American domin
ion. It can be regarded as absolutely
certain that this Government would
earnestly protest against any Govern
ment of Europe entering into negotia
tions with Spain for the transfer of the
Philippines. In this protest tne Ameri
can administration believes that it
would be joined by Great Britain.
That Russia and Great Britain
both believe the far east will be the
scene of a great naval struggle in the
near future naval officers believe
from preparations both are makirg
to put their forces in the Pacific in
the best possible condition.
If the Cramps establish a ship build
ing yard at Port Arthur, as they con
template doing, it is appreciated that it
will he under Russian control nnd will
give the Czar's Government a construc
tion and repair station of great im
portance in the event of war.
Great Britain has been buying up all
the steamer coal available in the west,
and been storing it at Esquimalt, and
now the latest report is that Russia
contemplates placing contracts for
ships with the Union Iron Works. Offi
cials ascribe the placing of contracts
with this firm and with the Cramps to
the desire of Russia to show her friend
ly feelings for this Government and its
citizens and to prevent by such a dis
play the development of the warm
relations existing between the United
States and Great Britain. One of sev
eral of Russia's immediate objects in
this move is to necessitate, if possible,
the consideration of her position in re
lation to the United States in case an
alliance is proposed.

Madrid Celebrating a Great
"Victory Over Samp
son and Schley.
Press Gives Extensive Details of
a Battle in Which Cervera
Crushed His Foes.
MADRID, May 29.â El Progresso pub
lishes dispatches purporting to come
from Paris giving details of an alleged
battle near Jamaica in which, it is said,
two American warships were destroyed
and one Spanish warship was injured.
Although the account is very circum
stantial as to time, place, incidents and
results, it is received here with sus
picion.
The story is that Commodore Schley's
squadron parted from Rear Admiral
Sampson's off Cape Maysi, the eastern
point of Cuba, and steered toward the
Yucatan peninsula, followed closely by
Sampson's ships. Both were sighted
from the watch towers of Santiago de
Cuba. Rear Admiral Sampson arrived
off the Province of Puerto Principe,
continuing thence in the direction of
Jamaica.
Admiral Cervera left Santiago on
Thursday, May 26, at midnight, all his
lights being extinguished, with the Viz
caya and the Almirante Oquendo pre
ceded by the torpedo boat destroyer
Furor. He took a position in proximity
to Jamaica. Two hours later the re
mainder of Admiral Cervera's squadron
withdrew from the harbor of Santiago
and proceeded in a southerly direction.
On the morning of Friday the Furor
came up rapidly to the Vizcaya and the
Almirante Oquendo, advising Admiral
Cervera of the approach of the enemy.
Rear Admiral Sampson's ships steamed
with full speed toward the Spanish ves
sels, which accepted combat, but moved
in a southerly direction, to ' effect a
junction with the remainder of the
Spanish squadron.
Presently the battle raged furiously
on both sides. The Americans detached

partment, he stated In a most positive
manner that he believed that the Span
ish fleet was at that point, and that
he Intended to destroy or capture it.
Communication with the insurgents de
veloped the information that he was
mistaken, and as soon as he satisfied
himself of its correctness he coaled and
sailed for Santiago. In his dispatch
to the department yesterday he did not
commit himself to the bald statement
that Admiral Cervera had not gone.
Perhaps he did not care to again put
himself in a false position, but the offi
cials with whom I have talked assume
that he is basing his future action on
â¦he assumption that the Spanish fleet
is in the harbor. The officials profess
to be still ignorant of Commodore
Sohley's plan of ascertaining whether
Admiral Cervera is really in the har
bor, and of bottling him up if he is
there, but among members of the
Naval War Board much favor is ex
pressed for the proposition of sending
old hulks to Santiago de Cuba; of sink
ing them in the channel so as to pre
vent the egress of the Spanish fleet,
of mining the harbor near these hulks
so as to insure the imprisonment of the |
Spaniards and finally to leave one or I
two vessels on guard to fire upon any
expedition that may attempt to remove
the obstructions from the channel. No j
doubt exists that Commodore Schley's I
opinion on this plan has been asked, j
and if it should meet with his approval |
Instructions will be sent to Commodore j
Remey at Key West to load several old
vessels with stone or old scrap iron
and send them to Santiago de Cuba.
The reported departure of the troop
ship Alfonso XIII from San Juan, Por
to Rico, for Mayaguez, Porto Rico, is j
regarded with suspicion by navy offl- j
cials, it being their belief that Havana
is the real destination of the vessel.
Mayaguez is situated in the western
part of the island, facing what is gen- j
erally known as Mona Channel, and is i
but a short distance from San Juan, j
which is situated on the northeastern !
coast. The Alfonso XIII is an auxil- j
iary cruiser armed with 5-inch Honoria j
breech-loading rifles. When she left
Spain six weeks ago she had on board
half a million dollars in gold, a cargo
of supplies and 800 soldiers, destined !
for Havana, but so strict was the I
blockade maintained by the American â 
ships that she was unable to get
through and she put back to the Bar
badoes, subsequently proceeding to j
San Juan. It is supposed that she left j
the soldiers and gold at San Juan and j
will now attempt to get through the
blockade with provisions for Captain
General Blanco. The authorities have
ordered Rear Admiral Sampson to keep
a sharp lookout for the Alfonso XIII,
and she will be captured, it is confi
dently predicted, if she goes near the
blockaded section of Cuba.

three cruisers and three smaller ships
to surround the Vizcaya and the Almi
rante Oquendo. The Furor, between
the crossfire of the enemy, made for the
American flagship, notwithstanding
the fire of the heavy guns. The out
come of the contest was that two
American warships were sunk and one
Spanish warship disabled in its steer
ing gear. The remaining vessels of the
American squadron were so much dam
aged that they were compelled to take
refuge in Haytien waters.
It is reported that the Cristobal Co
lon captured an American ship, which
had been disabled from a shot by the
Vizcaya, that perforated her side.
The Vizcaya risked destruction from
an American destroyer. It is believed
that after the combat the Spaniards
sailed for Havana, or, if the conditions
of the vessels or the presence of a su
perior force of the enemy required, took
refuge within Cardenas or Matanzas.
The publication of this dispatch from
Paris caused an excited discussion of
the conflicting reports from various
sources which completely absorbed all
sections of the press and all circles of
the public in Madrid. Speaking to-day
of yesterday's rumors of the defeat of
the Americans and the death of Rear
Admiral Sampson, Captain Aunon, the
Minister of Marine, without crediting
it in the absence of official confirma
tion, remarked that it was within the
limits of possibility. It is hoped that j
the result of to-day's Cabinet council
will disclose information confirming or
denying the report.
WASHINGTON, May 29.â The dis
patch from Madrid giving an account
r>f a naval battle between the combined '
squadrons of Sampson and Schley and
that of Cervera is absolutely discredit
ed by naval officials. Their advices j
show that it is not possible that a fight |
?ould have occurred.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Much work has yet to be done before
American troops can be landed in Cuba.
The authorities are, however, doing all
in their power to have the entire in
vading army ready to move to the
point of embarkation as soon as Com
modore Schley definitely reports that
he has Cervera's fleet cooped up at
Santiago. Secretary Alger positively
stated to me that no troops would leave
the United States for Cuba until such
report had been received.
The Government has now chartered
all boats for the purpose that will be
necessary- Assistant Secretary Meikle
john ho assured me yesterday. The
process of transporting the army from
its present position to Cuba will occupy
â¢at least three days.
Admiral Sampson will command the
convoys that will accompany the
troops on their trip from Key West to
Cuba. This fleet of convoys will consist
of many of the most powerful ships
now doing blockade duty off Havana.
Some little fear is felt by the Gov
ernment that the troops will be attack
ed by Spanish soldiers while they are
landing in Cuba. The big guns on the
vessels of Admiral Sampson's fleet are
relied upon to afford protection and
every precaution will be taken before
any men are landed from the ships.
Sf-nor Quesado of the Cuban Junta
Informs me that the United States has
made arrangements with General Go
mez for an immediate junction with the
insurgents on the arrival of United
States troops in Cuba. Members of the
Junta claim also that the insurgent
force under General Gomez is 25,000
strong. They admit, however, that this
army is greatly lacking in arms and
ammunition. I am informed that it is
the purpose of the United States to
provide the Cubans with such ammuni
tion and arms as they actually need.

Section 2â Public and private property
of the enemy, protection of persons and
especially of women, of religion, the arts
and sciences and punishment of crimes
against the inhabitants of hostile coun

Section 3â Deserters, prisoners of war,
hostages, booty on the battle-field.
Section 4 â Partisans, armed enemies not
belonging to the hostile army, scouts,
armed prowlers, war rebels.
Section sâSafe5 â Safe conduct, spies, war trait

ance with the laws under usages of
war. It extends to property and to per
sons, whether subjects of the enemy or
aliens of that Government. Whenever
feasible martial law is carried out in
cases of individual offenders by mili
tary courts; but sentences of death
shall be executed only with the ap
proval of the chief executive, provided
the urgency of the case does not re
quire a speedier execution, and then
only with the approval of the chief
commander. Military necessity admits
oi all direct destruction of life or limb
of "armed" enemies and of other per
sons whose destruction is incidentally
"unavoidable" in the armed contests of
the war. Military necessity does not
admit of crueltyâ that is, the infliction
of suffering for the sake of suffering
or for revenge, nor of maiming or
wounding except in fight, nor of tor
ture to extort confessions. It admits
of deception, but disclaims acts of per
fidy.
When a commander of a besieged
places expels the non-combatants in or
der to lessen the number of those who
consume his stock of provisions, it is
lawful, though an extreme measure, to
drive them back so as to hasten on
the surrender. Commanders, when-
ever admissible, inform the commander
of their intention to bombard a place,
but it is no infraction of the common
law of war to omit thus to inform
them. Surprise may be a necesssity.
Retaliation will never be resorted to aa
a measure of mere revenge, but only
as a means of protective retribution,
and moreover, cautiously and unavoid
ably.
A victorious army appropriates all
public money, seizes all public movable
property until further directed by its
Government and sequesters for its own
benefit or that of its Government all the
revenues of real property belonging to
the hostile government or nation. The
title to such property remains in abey
ance during military occupation and
until the conquest is made complete.
The United States acknowledges and
protects in hostile countries occupied by
them, religion and morality; strictly
private property; the persons of the in
habitants and especially those of
women and the sacredness of domestic
relations.
Deserters from the A/nerican army
having entered the service of the enemy
suffer death if they fall into the hands
of the United States. It is against the
usage of modern war to resolve in
hatred and revenge to give no quarter.
Outposts or sentinels or pickets are not
to be fired upon except to drive them
in, or when a positive order, special or
general order has been issued to that
effect. Whoever intentionally inflicts
additional wounds on an enemy already
wholly disabled, or kills him. or orders
that this shall be done, shall sufrer
death if convicted.

suff, chief surgeon on General Brooke's
staff, announces that he cordially in
dorses the plan adopted by the national
relief committee of receiving and dis
bursing supplies to sick and needy
soldiers contributed by friends at home.
He states that he himself received a
number of communications from var

plies of the character mentioned might
be sent to the soldiers in camp here.
He therefore asks the Associated Press
to say that the committee organized in
Chattanooga will take care of and dis
tribute all contributions of this char

The health of the camp is remarkably
good, and It is believed that, aside from
the usual slight complaints incident to
these seasons the worst of it Is over
now with the men who have made such
a radical change in temperaure, water
and diet. There were three deaths to
day, as follows:
Pierce Collier, aged 18, Company H,
Fourteenth Minnesota, of Beaver Falls,
from pneumonia, contracted in campp
before reaching Chickamauga.
Harry O. Burnham of Lynn, Mass.,
Company D, Eighth Massachusetts,

Two troops of cowboys arrived to-day
In command of Captain J. S. Gregory
from Fargo, Dak. There were 160 men

the regiment of 1000 officers and men.
It is understood that the two army
corps, the First and Third, now being
formed, will be the only troops to oc

are now proceeding to lease a tract of
3000 acres just north of the park near a
body of fresh water. The Sixth corps,
to be commanded by General Wilson,
will occupy this site. The ground Is
high and rolling, a most desirable point
for the encampment of such a large

REGIMENTS MUST FILL
TO THE MAXIMUM.
No New Ones to Be Formed Until
Those Already Organized Have
Full Complements.
"WASHINGTON, May 29.â About
twenty Goven . of States and Ter
ritories have replied to Secretary Al
ger's telegrams asking for their views
regarding the filling of the present vol
unteer regiments to their maximum
before beginning the formation of new
organizations. Some of these indicate
a preference for the recruiting of en
tirely new regiments, as under the first
call, leaving the present organizations
with the number of men now contained
in them, though practically all promise
the Government any amount of troops
that are wanted. It is the President's
desire, however, that the organizations
already formed shall be filled to their
strength as the law provides, and this
policy will be carried out in recruiting
under the second call.
The apportionment to the States has
been made up but not yet given to the
public. Through urgent representa
tions to Secretary Alger some of the
States were permitted under the first
call to furnish a greater number of
troops than they were legally entitled
to on the basis of population. Conse
quently, in raising the 75,000 men under
the second call, these inequalities will
be remedied as far as practicable, with
the result that some of the States may
not be called on to furnish any of the
men needed. This course, probably, may
give rise to discontent in States where
men are to serve, but it Is regarded as
the only fair way to Droceed.
LEGISLATION
OF THE WEEK
The Hawaiian Question
May Come Up.
WILL HAVE RIGHT OF WAY.
GENERAL DEFICIENCY BILL
MAY BE REPORTED.
Tlie War Revenue Measure Will Oc
cupy a Great Deal of l.me, as
Several Speeches Are Yet
to Be Made.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 29.
The House will not be In session to
j morrow, having adjourned until Tues
day because of Memorial day. The con
sideration of the Hawaiian annexation
resolutions by the House this week is
I possible but not assured. Speaker Reed
stands ready to give the resolutions
full right of way in the House if they
! pass the Senate, but is opposed to
sending them first through the House
and forcing them upon the Senate, be
cause, he contends, it would precipitate
a fight there and would prolong indefi
nitely the session and end likely in the
whole matter going over to next win
ter. Especially is he opposed to forc
ing the Hawaiian issue to the front
until the revenue bill is through the
Senate. It is stated upon high author
ity that other Republican members of
the Committee on Rules are in accord
with the Speaker's position, notwith
standing they favor as he does the
non-annexing proposition. Considera
tion of the resolutions early in the
week is not to be expected and
consideration late in the week
Is improbable. There is still talk
of a Republican caucus to consid
er the question, and one may be held.
The general deficiency bill may be re
ported during the week, but owing to
the development of new demands upon
the War and Navy departments, not
ably the former, incident to the war,
the bill may be withheld until nearer
the close of the session. The bill so
far as it relates to ordinary deficien
cies has been ready six weeks. Confer
ence reports upon the sundry civil,
postoffice, Indian and District of Co
lumbia appropriation bills may be
expected at almost any date, although
the sundry civil bill is likely to be de
layed until after the revenue bill passes
the Senate owing to the demands
thereupon of the attention of Senator
Allison of the Finance Committee.
An effort to pass the anti-scalping
bill will be made during the week.
Bills of minor importance will be
pushed meantime by members gener
ally.
Having decided at the last moment
on Saturday to observe Memorial day,
the Senate will not be in session again
until Tuesday. The Finance Commit
tee will, however, meet in an endeavor
to perfect the revenue bill in minor de
tails.
There is still no certainty aa to when
the vote may be taken on the revenue
bill It looks as if the entire week
would be spent upon it, and none of the
members of the committee undertake
to predict the exact date of the Sen
ate's conclusion of its work. There are
still a number of speeches to be made
upon the bill, and upon amendments.
It is probable that there will be more
or less debate upon the Lodge amend
ment for the annexation of Hawaii,
and the Morgan amendment relating
generally to the government of the an
nexed territory. Both Senators Lodge
and Morgan announce their intenti<>:
to make speeches on the subjects in
volved, and Senators espousing the op
posite views declare their purpose to
reply if the subject is opened. Repub
licans generally predict that Senator
Lodge will refrain from pressing his
amendment, and it is the general opin
ion that he will at least not go to the
extent of asking a vote upon it and
thus subjecting the measure to a mo
tion to lay upon the table.
Whenever the final vote is reached
on the revenue bill there is no longer
much doubt as to the shape in whic
it will be passed by the Senate. Th
decisive vote of Saturday on the cor
poration tax renders it quite certai
that all the Democratic amendment
will be eliminated from the bill, am
the Republican suggestion for the is
suance of three hundred million bond
and one hundred million in time cer
tincates will be substituted for th
House amendment. The expression o
the Senate is that the House will accep
the Senate amendments and conse
quently the bill will not be long In con
ference.
With the revenue bill disposed of
there may be an effort to secure an in
j dependent expression on Hawaiian an
j nexation, but this will depend on the
future developments. The conference
reports on the appropriation bills will
also be in order. There will be several
of these, the sundry civil being the
most important.
THEOREGCN'S OFFICERS
AND MEN COMPLIMENTED
Secretary of the Navy Highly Pleased
With the Successful Voyage of
the Battleship.
NEW YORK, May 29.â A Washing-
ton special to the Herald says: Secre
tary Long has officially commended
Captain C. E. Clarke and officers and
men under his command for their ex
cellent work in bringing the battle-ship
Oregon safely to Key West. This com
mendation was given upon telegraphic
announcement from Captain Clarke of
his arrival at Key West, and not upon
his mail report, which is expected to
reach Washington on Tuesday. The
Secretary's letter is a pleasant state
ment of the facts concerning the cruise,
and highly compliments Captain
Clarke and his subordinates for their
work.
The assignment of the battle-ship to
Rear Admiral Sampson's command
gives that cfs eer off the northern coast
of Cuba three armorclads â the armored
cruiser New York and the battle-ships
Indiana and Oregon â besides four mon
itors and protected cruisers.
No surprise need be felt if it is learn
ed within the next few days, in case
Admiral Cervera's presence in the har
bor of Santiago de Cuba should be ab
solutely confirmed, that two of the
monitors have been ordered to Commo
dore Schley's assistance, these vessels
to relieve, perhaps, the lowa, which
may be returned to Rear Admiral
Sampson's immediate command.
Cornell Grants the Bequest.
ITHACA, N. V., May 29.â Cornell has

gratification of the Cornell navy was ex
pressed for the courtesy shown by Har
vard and Yale in their efforts to arrange
matters satisfactorily to all Darties.
CRUISER AND
STEAMSHIP IN
COLLISION
British Vessel Foscolia Runs
Into the Columbia
During a Fog.
Badly Disables the Warship and
Is Itself Sunk in Nineteen
Fathoms of Water.
NETv" YORK May 29.â When the
United States cruiser Columbia, in
command of Captain Sands, anchored
off Tompkinsville, S. 1., this afternoon
It was seen that she had a large jagged
hole stove in her starboard side,
abreast the mast, and immediately for
ward of the after barbette. Above the
water line the hole extended about ten
feet In height and six feet wide. Just
how far below the water line the crui
ser was damaged could not be ascer
tained, and none of the naval officers
would give any information in regard
to the accident.
As soon as the vessel came to anchor,
the captain and crew, twenty-one in
all, of the British steamer Foscolia,
which left this port yesterday with a
cargo of machinery and general mer
chandise for Bordeaux, went ashore.
Neither the captain nor any of the Brit
ish crew would talk and they left at
once for New York to report the acci
dent to their agents. No one was al
lowed to go on board the Columbia, but
to a correspondent who rowed out to
the cruiser, the officers of the deck
made the following brief statement:
At about 7:40 a. m. the British ship
Foscolia, in command of Captain John
Evans, collided with our vessel during
a dense fog. We were then about eight
miles southwest, off Fire Island. We
lowered two life boats and rescued the
captain and crew, numbering twenty
one all told. We stood by until the Fos
colia sank at 3 o'clock this morning.
As soon as we arrived here we sent the
rescued men ashore."
Further information in reference to
the accident could not be obtained.
At 4 o'clock one of the navy yard tugs
steamed alongside the cruiser and de
livered some messages from Rear Ad
miral Bunce, commander of the navy
yard at Brooklyn. A few minutes later
the Columbia headed for the Brooklyn
Navy Yard, where it is supposed she
be drydocked and the extent of her in
juries ascertained.
Captain J. Evans of the Foscolia, af- j
ter reaching this city, said regarding i
the collision:
"The Foscolia cleared from this port j
at noon on Saturday with a general j
cargo of about 2200 tons. All went well i
until evening when a heavy fog set in. !
I was on the bridge and ordered the
lights up and the fog whistle kept go- j
ing. As the fog grew denser the speed ;
of the ship was reduced to one-half.
"At about 8 o'clock the lookout, John
son, on the forecastle and Thompson :
on the bridge, re.rorte* a steamer on j
the port bow. Our lights were burning
brigbtly and the fog signal was whist
ling. I looked up and saw a big ;
steamer with four funnels dead ahead.
As the steame- s were not 200 yards
apart, I saw that a collision was in- j
WAR REVENUE
BILL BLOCKED
Annexationists Delay the
Vote.
ADOPT PECULIAR TACTICS.
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
PRESENT CRISIS.
May Even Go to the Extent of De
priving the Government of Means
for Waging the
Conflict.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 29.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Were it not
for the Hawaiian annexation question
Congress could pass the war revenue
bill, finish the appropriation bills and
adjourn -within two weeks.
The debate on the revenue bill has
been practically concluded, and a vote
could be reached at almost any mo
ment but for the threat of Senator
Lodge and other annexationists to
press the annexation amendment and
precipitate a long debate. The oppo
nents of annexation believe they can
prevent this, however, by moving to lay
the amendment on the table after Sen
ator Lodge has made his speech upon
It. This motion is not debatable, and
could be brought to a vote at once. It
is understood a number of annexation
ists will vote for it on the ground that
it is not a proper, subject for incorpora
tion in a revenue measure.
It may be that the motion to- lay
Lodge's amendment on the table may
not carry, as the Senator by no menaa
stands alone in his disapproval of the
means taken and bargains made to de
feat annexation. Should the amend
ment not be laid on the table a debate
would ensue, the end of which it would
be impossible to foretell. Interests
which are opposed to annexation are
so strong and have been able to con
trol a number of Senators so absolutely
that they might even go as far as to
delay the passage of the revenue bill
until the Government is left without
means for carrying on the war through
complete exhaustion of the available
cash in the treasury-
Speaker Reed, who has become ac
customed to speaking for the entire
House of Representatives, has been a
party to the attempts to sidetrack the
Hawaiian resolution by an agreement
i that it should not come up in either
house during this session. He is
threatened with an even more serious
rebellion than when a large element In
| evitable. I blew three whistles and
i the approaching vessel answered with
! one blast. That was the tirst time I
heard tLe Columbia's whistle. Instantly
I ordered our engines full speed astern.
The vessels came together, however,
with a terrible crash, and the b<>w of
the Foscolia ran up on the cruiser'^
armor belt and then cut through her
sponsons. They remained locked for a
couple of seconds, but the backing of
the Foscolia'a engines tore off her bow
|as far back as th-> first water-tight
bulkhead. The wreckage stuck in the
cruiser's side above and below the wa
ter line and cauat.-d the Columbia t<> list
considerably. Had it not been for the
bulging of the sponson from the side
j of the warship, the Foscolia would have
Struck the Columbia only a glancing
blow. The bow of the Foscolia became
wedged between the sponson and hull
of the cruiser and the bow of my boat
I was completely wrenched off.
"It was dead calm at the time of the
I collision. After backing away I saw
i the injury to the Foscolia was serious
! and instantly ordered the lifeboats
I launced. They were in the water In
, Just four minutes and my crew were
j ordered' into them. I remained aboard
j the wreck with my five officers. My
I engineers, after trying the engines, re-
I ported them to be so badly damaged by
; the collision as to be incapable of work
i ing the ship. The Fnscolia was leaking
| badly and the pumps were started. The
i crew was sent aboard the cruiser,
j which had a hole in her starboard large
j enough to drive a team and carriage
i through. The pumps were kept wnrk
| ing until 10:30 p. m.. but the Foscolia
was getting lower and lower in the wa
ter.
"Two boats from the Columbia were
standing by me and Lieutenant Wil
liams asked me at that hour what I
intended doing. I replied that I would
! stand by my ship until she went down.
I Then I ordered the officers into the life
i boat and I remained at th.^ main rlg
! ging while the steamship continued to
j sink. I got into the small boat and re
i mained with my officers about fifty
I yards from the sinking shin.
"Exactly at 3 a. m. the Foscolla went
', down head first in nineteen fathoms of
, water. It reappeared again a few min
utes later and then disapp.-nred for-
I ever, stern first. None of my men were
hurt, but I cannot tell if all the men
ion the Columbia escaped Injury. I
think not.
"The Foscolla, which I commanded
for twelve months, was an Iron vessel
iof 9SO tons net and 1536 tons gross,
launched at Newcastle, England, in
1579, and her hailing port was London.
She was 252 feet long, 34 feet beam
and 22 feet 7 inches deep. She was
schooner rigged, had two masts, a
double deck, four bulkheads, compound
engines and carried water ballast."
the House practically compelled action
on the Cuban resolution, before either
the Speaker or the administration
wished it. This time the rebellious Re
publicans include nearly all the men
on that side of the House, and they
have the advantage of having the ad
ministration with them, instead of op
posed to them, as in the case of the
Cuban resolution.

NOT DISCUSS
HIS PLIGHT
Declines to Offer Explana
tions of Wea^ Points
in His Story.
peeling iQ Madera Grows More
Bitter Against tf)e Young
Official's Accusers.
MADERA, May 29.â 1f there Is any
mystery concerning the details of the
alleged robbery of Deputy Tax Collec
tor Krohn it has not yet been solved.
Circumstances have developed that are
held by some to point to a conclusion
not in accordance with the story told
by Krohn, but they have served no
more definite purpose than to accentu
ate the bitter feeling the majority of
the people in this community hold
agrainst those who pretend to look with
suspicion on the story told by the pop
ular young official.
Krohn is still confined to his room
from the effects, so his physician
states, of the beating- he received at the
hands of the two masked robbers. His
numerous friends are permitted to see
and converse with him, but newspaper
correspondents are excluded. To all
queries the reply is that Krohn does
not care to be Interviewed. This re
luctance on his part to discuss the de
tails of the alleged robbery is unfortu
nate, as It leaves the public in doubt
on several Important points that, as the
case now stands, are certainly not in
Krohn's favor.
One of these points has to do with
the question of the time at which the
supposed robbery occurred. On the day
following the robbery Krohn stated he
was attacked by robbers at about 10:30
o'clock in the evening, and that during
the struggle that ensued a pano of
glass in the counter railing was
shattered. Several persons who were
near tho office heard the crash of the
breaking glass and all agree that it
occurred at 11:25 o'clock â fifty-five
minutes later than the time fixed by
X: hn.
This fact, taken In connection with
Kr< inn's statement concerning the time
'ii the steel safe inside the large
vault, forms a bit of circumstantial
evidence that is troubling the minds of
the friends of the young man. The
was kept in this steeh safe, and
Krohn says the time lock on the safe
was set for 11 o'clock. In other words,
the safe could be opened by any one
familiar with the combination before
lock, but after that hour no one
could open it until a fixed hour on the
.ing- morning. According to
Krohn's story, he was held up at 10:30
k and was told to open the safe.
He replied that he could not, as the
time lock was on. The robbers said
they knew the time lock did not begin
to work until 11 o'clock, and If he did
not comply with their demand they
would kill him. Krohn then went to
the safe and opened it.
One of the robbers looted the safe,
and then both attempted to lock Krohn
in the vault. During the struggle that
ensued the glass was broken, Krohn was
beaten into Insensibility and the rob
bers escaped with the coin.
All of these things are supposed to
have occurred within the space of ten
minutes. The glass was broken at 11:23
o'clock has been established beyond a
reasonable doubt by the testimony of
three or four reputable witnesses, who
heard the crash and located the noise
as coming from the interior of che Tax
Collector's office. One of these wit
nesses is Night Watchman Tooker, who
was within 150 feet of the office at tho
time. He, in company with others,
made an immediate Investigation, but
was unable to discover anything. Pre
suming that the glass was broken ten
minutes after the robbers first entered
the place, and after they had obtained
possession of the cash, it follows that
the time when Krohn was fored to open
the time when Krohn was forced to open
did open the safe, therefore, is a mani
fest impossibility, for at that time the
time lock had been at work fiften min
ntes.
If it is conceded that three or four dis
interested witnesses are telling the
truth regarding the time when they
heard the crash of breaking glass, then

the story told by Krohn Is impossible of
belief, because it is contradicted by
facts that cannot lie.
It is possible that Krohn can furnish |
] some explanation for this and other !
I apparent contradictions to his story,
but he prefers to let the public place its
own construction on the suspicious cir
cumstances of the case as it now ap
pears. So far as the county is con- I
cerned, the alleged robbery will result
in no public loss, as Krohn's bondsmen
are responsible under the law. The ]
| money that Krohn claims was stolen I
{ should have been paid into the treas
; ury some time ago, and the fact that
; it was not paid makes Krohn and his
J bondsmen responsible for its loss.
The work of experting Krohn's ac
j counts is going slowly forward, but the
j result will not serve to throw any light
on the supposed robbery. The books
will show that Krohn should have had
in his possession the amount of money |
he claims to have had, but they will I
not show whether Krohn had appro- ]
priated to his own use or whether it j
was stolen at the time and in the man
ner in which he says it was. The only
result that the expert will be able to at
tain will be to try to fix the exact
amount which will have to be made
good by the bondsmen.
In this connection the generous action
of Krohn's brothers and relatives is
worthy of special notice. They have |
signified their intention of turning over
to the bondsmen all of their property
without reserve in order that the
bondsmen may indemnify themselves
for the money they will be forced to
turn over to the county. The property
so off^rf/d amounts in value to more
than $30,000.
COMMERCE OF COUNTRIES
NEAR THE PHILIPPINES.
Statistics of Interest to American
Producers in View of Present
Conditions.
WASHINGTON. May 29.â The com
merce of the countries adjacent to the
Philippine Islands is the subject of a
series of tables which will appear in the i
next monthly publication of the Bureau
of Statistics.
The statement consists of tables
showing the population and commerce
of the islands adjacent to the Philip
pines, and the share which the United
States and other nations had in the
commerce for a series of years, and is
accompanied by a map showing the
steamship routes and distance from
that port to the ports of the adjacent
countries. The fact that the countries
now in easy reach of the Philip-pines
contain a population of 85,000,000, that
their purchases from other parts of the
world amount to over a billion dollars
every year and their exports to a like
sum, and that the larger portion of
these purchases comprise the classes of
goods produced in the United States,
add greatly to the interest in this sub
ject. The tables will show the popula
tion and area of the countries, their
trad^ with each of the leading nations
of the world and the percentage which
each nation obtains of their exports
and imports, the articles which have
been exported to each by the United
States during the past five years and
the total commerce of the United States
with each of the principal countries of
that section by years since 1880.
THREE SPANISH SPIES
MAKE THEIR ESCAPE
Futile Efforts to Capture the Men
Who Tried to Destroy a Fort
Taylor Mortar Battery.
KEY WEST, May 29.â The three sup
posed Spaniards who tried to blow up
the mortar battery near Fort Taylor
on Thursday night have not yet been
captured. Captain Merrill, command
ant at tho fortifications, had armed
searching parties out looking for them
last night, and to-day the torpedo boat
Porter has been scouting in the adja
cent waters in search of them, but
without success. They are thought
either to have gotten safely (iff to Culm,
or to be in hiding on one of the neigh
boring: keys. â 
Two of the suspects were seen driv
ing along the beach road near the for
tifications yesterday afternoon. They
were followed to the eastern end of the
island, where they were joined by a
third man. All boarded a rowboat "and
made for Stock Island, a neighboring
key. One, who is thought to be the
leader, carried a rifle. When last seen
their boat was approaching a sloop or
schooner lyinr off Stock Island. This
morning both sloop and small boat
were gone. The authorities have de
tailed descript ! ns of the men.
TO DRAW GERMANY
AWAY FROM RUSSIA
England to Accomplish Its Object
May Make a Colonial Concession
of Great Value.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett.
BERLIN, May 29.-I am in a posi
tion to inform you that English offi
cers' expressions of friendship to Ger
many, ambiguously referred to by
Joseph Chamberlain at Birmingham,
were of a most decided character. In
fact, they have taken official as well as
non-official Germany rather by sur
prise. It is even asserted here that the
project includes a possible colonial con
cession of great value to Germany, pre
sumably as the price for drawing Ger
many away from Russia.
I have also authority for the state
ment that the idea of England, Ger
many and America joining hands is be
ing seriously entertained, not so much
here, but in Washington and London,
whence it Is forced on German atten
tion.
The rumor that Sir Frank Lascelles
was about to be transferred from here
le utterly unfounded. The British Em
bassador Is persona gratlsslma with
the Emperor. J

NEW POLICY
SHAPED BY
THE WAR
Henry Norman Writes of
the Probable Course of
This Government.
Believes It Will forsake Tradition
and Retain Territory Wrested
from Spain.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 29.
Henry Norman, editor of the London
Daily Chronicle, whose letters from
Â§city during the Venezuelan bound
dispute attracted such widespread
rition. is in Washington again as
correspondent of his paper. To
t he cabled the following to the
Chronicle, and through his courtesy the
Associated Press is able to present the
matter from this side.
Since my arrival I have sought dili
gently in all quarters for some outline
or suggestion of the policy to be pursued
by the United States in the immediate fu
ture. The result of the war is a fore
gone conclusion. Each day's news has,
therefore, only an incidental interest.
But, wholly without intention on the
part of the administration, the country
is rapidly approaching a situation where
a decision more momentous than any for
j a century past must i><- taken. The re-
I suits of this decision will affect European
nations hardly less than America Itself.
Upon such matter I have been unwilling
Ksay a word until convinced it was
ed on solid facts. I have conversed
h almost every man, beginning with
highest, where authority will mold
issue, and with many other friends
new acquaintances, representative of
all shades of opinion. The inquiry has
been like the search for a needle in a
haystack, and 1 have now reached the
conclusion that in this particular stack
there Is no needle at all.
I mean that neither in the White House
nor the State Department is there any
definite conviction or determination on
the future direction of the national pol
icy with regard to the disposal of these
over-sea possessions over which the
American flag will be flying when the
war is over. This may sound like a hos
tile criticism. Nothing is further from
my mind. The United States has drifted
steadily toward its new fate. If the
Maine had not been blown up war would
not exist to-day. The neutrality of Eng
land forced Admiral Dewey's squadron
to sea, and to smash the Spanish Asiatic
Iron and seize Manila was his only
â¢ -â¢â¢. This accomplished, it became in
stantly imperative to send him re-en-
Mients, and these had to be strong
-â¢ h to defeat twenty Spanish regi
ments and occupy the principal islands.
The same is true of the Atlantic. When
war was declared it was believed that
the insurgents were capable of taking the
field against the Spanish if supplied with
arms, ammunition and food. It is now
known that they arc wholly incapable of
this, and the military authorities have
become deeply averse to any co-operation
with the insurgents, holding the view that
the American army should act with com
plete Independence, sq as to be free to
face whatever situation may arise after
the Spanish are expelled.
To President MoKinley alone Is due tho
escape of this country from the fatal
blunder of recognizing the Insurgents as
belligerents, and for this every tninking
American to-day is - rofoundly grateful.
Again, there was originally no intention
of bombarding or seizing Porto Rico.
Admiral Sampson's bombardment was a
failure; it should have been sooner and
final or not at all. That mistake Is not
to be repeated, and the second Spanish
fleet will not find a base there.
Moreover, nobody could have foreseen
the extraordinary change of public opin
ion after Admiral Dewey's victory. Be
tween April 3 and May 1 a revolution took
place. On that day the Idea of keeping
the Philippines had not occurred to any
body; on the next day few people thought
of giving them up. Now, also, it is ap
preciated that it is impossiole to dispose
of them to any other power without the
gravest complications, while public senti
ment is intolerant of the idea of restor
ing them to Spain's misrule.
Thus, in every direction, events have
moved and the administration has follow
ed. . In Ambassador Hay's words, it has
been a case of imposition of invisible
hands. The moving finger has written]
and it cannot be lured back to "cancel
half a line."
The question is, will the United States,
when peace is signer!, withdraw within
its rid limits, abide by its old traditions
and resist the temptation of empire; or
will it accept boldly what the fortunes of
war have brought and turn its face
toward a new destiny? The struggle will
be long and bitter.
The opponents of annexation urge that
the constitution permits no territory to be
incorporated in the Union which cannot
become a state. It is replied that
America must no longer let George Wash
ington do its thinking for it.
"Why," ask some, "would we needlessly
entangle ourselves with European powers
and enter the far Eastern political are-
na?"
"We are always entangled, reply the
others, "our interests are equal to those
of England in keeping open the vast mar
kets of China, and England will he over
borne and China seized piecemeal unless
we range ourselves alongside her."
"It will take a great navy and army,"
say the objectors.
"It is perfectly certain," reply the an
nexationists, "that the country has al
ready determined to have such a strong
navy and army that we never again shall
be caught in this disgraceful state of
unprepared ness."
In view of this sharp division of opinion
it is obvious the only statesmanlike
course of the President is to finish the
war first and let the policy take care of
itself.
Moreover, I have reason to believe it

V Hudson Medical. Institute, Stockton, Market and Ellis Sts., S.F. M
has been decided to enforce only a mod
erate revenue tariff upon the Philip
pines, to which American goods will be
subject like the goods of other nations,
and this is already so great a departure
from tradition as to render other de
partures lees surprising. Cuba will be
given every chance of freedom, but if, as
may be, she lacks the elements of inde
pendence, she must become American.
That Porto Rico will be retained I feel
sure. Europe, therefore, needs to en
visage a development of American pol
icy which will upset many calculations
arid possibly radically modify the pres
ent balance of power.
CERVERA CARRIED NO
FOOD TO SANTIAGO
Landed Men and Arms, but Brought
No Provisions to Relieve the
Famine Situation.
PORT AU PRINCE, May 29. â Two
Italians who set out from Santiago de
Cuba in a small boat on May 19 and
landed near Mole St. Nicholas on the
22d, arrived here to-day bringing in
formation as to the situation at San
tiago. The state of affairs there is
critical, particularly so because of the
lack of food. A great many of the un
fortune people, especially the recon
centrados, are dying of starvation.
The whole population is terribly dis
couraged and keenly desirous of peace.
The arrival of the squadron under
Cervera without food supplies for the
city deepened the general despond
ency.
The squadron has disembarked 800
men, artillery men and engineers, and
landed 20,000 Mauser rifles, a great
quantity of ammunition and four big
guns destined fur the fortifications.
In spite of the strict silence main
tained by the officers and the com
manders, the general expression was,
when the Italiar left, that the squad
ron would set out for San Juan, Porto
munition there.
THE HARVARD TAKING
ON COAL AT KINGSTON.
She Will Be Allowed to Remain in
Port Twenty-four Hours Longer
Than Usual.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 28 (de
layed in transmission).â The United
States auxiliary cruiser Harvard, for
merly the American line steamer New
York, is coaling here. The Colonial
(Government is undecided as to how
much coal she will be allowed to take
on board, but she will probably ship
six hundred tons at least, enough for
all present purposes. As something
trifling is wror - with her steering
gear and her boilers are dirty, she will
be allowed to remain hÂ«ro 24 hours
longer than usual, under the neutrality
regulations. With the exception of
medicines, the Harvard has not taken
on board any supplies.
Captain Cotton of the Harvard said
that all were well on board the squad
ron when he left the vessels under the
command of Commodore Schley on Fri
day. Rear Admiral Sampson was then
supposed to be off the northwest coast
of Cuba.
STORES FOR THE ZAFIRO
SEIZED AT HONGKONG
Dewey Is Fortifying Corregidor
Island and Mining the Channel
of Manila Bay.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
-ONGKONG, May 29. â The police
last night seized a quantity of stores
which were being supplied by a Chi
nese "compredore" at Hongkong to the
United States auxiliary cruiser Zaflro,
now being 1 used as a transport. The
stores were conveyed in three lighters
and a steam launch to the Zaflro,
which is still at Kowloon Bay, in Chi
nese waters, where she has been coaled
and provisioned.
Americans are fortifying Corregidor
Island at the entrance to Manila Bay
and are mining the channel. They will
give a warm reception to any possible
antagonist.

ETHEL. For more than ten years I suffered severely from dyspepsia, and duT-.pr'
ing that time consulted many physicians. First it was thÂ« family jÂ»
doctor in New York, where I then resided, and later I had treat-
ment at the New York Hospital, but obtained no permanent) relief** j
For over a month I had visited my family physician in B^yonne, ; :; -J| .
twice in every week, and as a last resort an appointment had been
made when 1 was tc^teibmit , to the process of having the stomach
washed out by the siphon arrangement, which is found a mode QjÂ£*
treatment more beneficial in its .effects than enjoyable in the pro-
cess. About this time, however, I had a conversation with a.*
friend who w?i acquainted with the merits of Ripane Tabulet, and \
he presented me with a box for trial, -Well, I did try them, and *â  ;
could feel that | they did me good, bo I . bought more, and in my
house nowadays you will always find a supply of Ripans Tabules.
I find them easier to take than powders or liquids, or even than -
swallowing i hot .water in the morning, . M^ condition is so much
Improved that of late I hare had ; no ; occasion to i resort to them
at all. : Before I found the Tabules, my â¢ bill for attendance and.

INCREASING ACTIVITY IN TRADE.
COMMERCIAL reports from all sections of the
country point to a further increase in the vol
ume of trade. Last week it was the West that
showed the greatest activity, but this week the East
i? also expanding. The movement of merchandise is
fully up to the normal at this season of the year, and
in some sections it is above it. The bank clearings for
the week were 29.4 per cent larger than for the cor
responding week last year, and the failures were 245,
against 257 for the same week in 1897 and 277 in 1896.
Not a single large city in the United States showed a
decrease in its bank clearings, while the gain in New
York was 27.7 per cent, in Chicago 32.8 per cent, in
Philadelphia 21.3 per cent, in Baltimore 40.7 per cent,
in San Francisco 22.3 per cent, in New Orleans 1 1.8
per cent, in Minneapolis 32.8 per cent, and so on,
showing that the gain in business as represented by
these clearings was general throughout the country.
The railroad earnings also exhibited a gain over 1897.
The expansion of trade is not confined to two or
three leading staples, but apparently characterizes the
whole field of merchandise. Thus the iron trade,
starting the month with the greatest production ever
known, has made surprising progress with new orders,
mainly for agricultural implements, though car
building and structural work come in for a large
share. The long-expected recovery in wool seems
nearer realization, rather more business being re
ported at almost all Eastern centers. Textile goods
are likewise in better demand. Hides and leather
have lately been tending upward, with an increased
movement. The distributive trade of the whole coun
try was never better. Provisions are still active and
firm, with higher price-, for hams, bacon and lard at
the principal packing points. The increase in railroad
earnings for the week was 15 per cent, and the ship
ments from Chicago, eastward during the first three
weeks in May amounted to 389.000 tons, against
150,800 during the same period last year. This in
creased movement was due to the enormous move
ment of breadstuffs, the Atlantic exports of wheat and
flour last week being 3,726,000 bushels, against 1,536,
000 last year. When the greatly advanced prices of
grain this year are taken into consideration, the effect
of this increase in the export movement on the coun
try at large will be immediately realized.
Wall street continues in a state of innocuous
desuetude, to employ a famous phrase which has be
come incorporated into the regular jargon of trade.
The public still keeps aloof, and the professionals are
perforce obliged to depend upon their own resources.
Still, the feeling is bullish. As an influential factor in
the situation the war has become a subordinate issue,
as the large financial interests are paying more atten
tion to the crops and railroad earnings than to the
brush with Spain. It would not take much to start
a general advance in Wall street, as the condition of
general trade, as shown above, is brilliant, and Europe
owes us something like $100,000,000, which is slowly
finding its way into the capacious Yankee pocket. It
is only a short time since we were a chronic debtor
of Europe, but within the past year she has been bor
rowing millions from us, and we are taking the first
steps in becoming what England has long been â a
great creditor nation. It is manifest destiny in a new
form, and one little suspected by those who coined
that phrase two or three generations back. The United
States is rapidly becoming a great "world power" all
around, and one which Europe cannot afford to qunr
rd with, as France has recently learned to its chagrin.
Locally things are quiet. We are approaching the
summer season, when trade generally eases off. We
are harvesting crops which are more profitable this
year than for many years, pausing every now and then
to cheer a passing regiment of soldiers or a fleet of
transports conveying troops to our new possessions
beyond the seas. Apropos of this, the acquisition of
the Philippines will prove a bonanza to San Francisco
if her mercantile bodies are energetic enough to see
that nobody else gets the hanging plum. We are the
natural shipping and receiving point for the Manila
trade, and we ought not to allow the opportunity thus
presented to slip through our fingers. A word to the
wise is sufficient.
The late rains continue to improve agricultural con
ditions. Some damage has been done, but the' benefits
derived more than counterbalance it. All indications
point to a year of more than ordinary prosperity.
Our grain and hay will probably sell high and our
fruit crop will yield more than the usual revenue, as
stocks of canned and dried fruit are practically ex
hausted, and the incoming crop is not heavy enough
to cause a glut.
The quartering of large bodies of troops in this
city is helping local trade in many ways, notably in
provisions and clothing.
There is considerable discussion as to the wisdom
displayed by Cervera, which is in a measure useless.
As nobody known what he has done, the basis for
argument is at least frail.
DECORATION DAY.
ALL the solemn and patriotic services of the an
nuak decoration of the graves of those who
gave their live? that the republic might live
will be observed to-day with a more ardent and fer
vent feeling than has been felt for many a year past
The ceremonies may not be statelier, the processions
larger or the orations more eloquent than those to
which we have been accustomed, but it is certain the
responsiveness of the people will be more tender and
more earnest.
While we decorate to-day the graves of the heroes
of the war that freed the slaves and kept the Union
whole we cannot be oblivious of the fact that we arc
now dedicating a new generation to the same arduous
service of war in the cause of the nation. Around the
sacred graves, beneath the glorious banner of the
nation, there will gather to-day along with the Grand
Army veterans a host of youths forming the Volunteer
Army of the younger generation, who in their turn
have taken up the sword and placed their lives at the
service of their country.
The thought which will be dominant in the minds
of all to-day will be that of the complete success which
under God has blessed the arms of the heroic Grand
Army. To-day the Union is restored not only in ter
ritory and in power, but in the loyal love of all hearts
North and South. Lee and Wheeler and Butler, men
who wore the gray with distinguished valor and mili
tary skill, are types of thousands of veterans of the
armies of the South who under Davis fought against
the Union and are now demonstrating th;ir genuine
loyalty to the flag by going forth under its folds to
fight for the restored Union against a foreign foe.
It is a significant fact which should be widely noted
and profoundly reflected on that this is the first war
in which the whole people of the United States have
been united. During the Revolution there were many
loyalists in all the colonies. Almost every family had
one or more members on each side of the struggle.
In iÃt2 the republic was not yet a nation and the war
was not cordially supported by thousands who be
lieved that we ought to have sided with England
against Napoleon rather than fight her. Large num
bers of patriots of the North regarded the war with
Mexico as an act of aggression on the part of slave
holders for the acquirement of further slave territory,
and in that, therefore, as in previous wars, there was
a lack of that unity of sentiment which constitutes the
true harmony of national life.
There are no dissensions among us in this war.
There are no sections or States of the Union holding
back from it. no large classes of people averse to it,
no poets who denounce it as Lowell and Whittier de
nounced the war with Mexico. We are not only a
mighty nation, we are a united, harmonious and
mighty people with a common love of the flag, a
common reverence for the constitution and a common
aspiration for the accomplishment of a national des
tiny of the highest moral and political grandeur.
For this Great and momentous result we are prim
arily indebted to the heroes of the Grand Army. The
battles they fought won for us the strength and power
to wage not only this war of to-day, but all wars that
are to come. As we stand by their graves, remember
ing what they did, considering what duties are re
quired of the young volunteers around us and with
earnest patriotism striving to solve the vast problem?
which are already rising upon the horizon before us.
we enn but recall the solemn words of Lincoln:
"It is for us to dedicate ourselves to the great task
remaining before vs â that from these honored graves
we draw increased devotion to that causr for which
they gave the last full measure of devotion â that the
nation under God shall have a new birth in freedom
and that a government of the people by the people
for the people shall not perish from the earth."
FACTIONS AND RUCTIONS
NO little surprise was felt throughout San Fran
cisco by the announcement made yesterday that
the gentlemen appointed by the Democratic
State Committee to investigate the condition of the
party in this city had reached the conclusion that
neither of the contending factions claiming to be the
regular Democratic City and County Committee had
any virtue or validity in it. The conclusion was re
cognized to be right enough, but the wonder was
great that the members of the State Committee had
sense enough to reach it.
Discomfited, divided, disorganized and demoral
ized, the shattered fragments of Democracy have been
whirling around the vacuum where the head and the
double tail of it went down in 1896. Many a wild
eddy has been caused in different parts of the Union
as a result of the whirling, but among them all there
is no other eddy like that which swirls in this city.
Here is confusion worse confounded and demorali
zation reduced to old chaos and pure cussedness.
Here are Phelans, Sullivans, Raineys, Buckleys,
Maguires, Harneys, Poppers, McNabs and Patsy
Bolivars skirling around in maddening mazes lost,
with endless combinations made and broken, to the
utter bewilderment of the beholder.
It is surprising that the State Committee arbitrators,
themselves involved in the general Democratic con
fusion, could have so accurately diagnosed the dis
order around them. Possibly they did not diagnose
it at all. It may be they desired to have a city faction
of their own, and pronounced all existing city factions
no good as the shortest way of getting at it. At any
rate they put up a faction of their, own and started a
new ruction. There are now three Democratic com
mittees in this city and county and the campaign is
still young. It is a veritable devil's barber-shop of
a party â the call is "next," but no man knoweth what
is coming next.
Senator White will not be a candidate for re
election, Governor Budd will neither be a candidate
for a second term in his present office nor seek the
Scnatorship. Mr. Gould, satisfied with hi- place as
a trustee of a lunatic asylum, where he has managed
to get snug places for his relatives, will not run for
anything unless the governorship should be forced
upon him. The rats are leaving the sinking ship, and
no one stays with it but the pirates, who believe there
is still some boodle left in the old hulk and are hope
ful of their ability to swim ashore with the plunder
when the wreck sinks.
Thus the fracas goes on with noise enough. The
State Democracy has now devoured county Dem
ocracy, but the end is not yet. Perhaps ere long a
national committee will devour the State organization
and then be in its turn swallowed by a fusion com
mittee, and so the whole thing disappear into the vor
tex of Populism and nothingness.
Senator Teller says the United States ought to take
?11 Spanish territory which is outside of Spain itself.
There are many who will agree with him, although
not all would have the courage to say so in a public
way. A war for the promotion of humanity cannot
well stop while there is barbarism to be abated, and
such there will be while the Spanish flag waves over
a single colony.
It is well to remember that while training for a fight
it is not regarded as wise to gorge en piÂ»
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY* 30, 1898.
THE BEST NATIONAL GUARDSMEN.
OUR much esteemed contemporary, the Boston
Journal, commends as warmly as ourselves the
request of General Merritt for an increased
number of regular troops for the expedition to Man
ila, but not for the same reason as ourselves. It holds
that the regulars are more needed for the Philippine
than for 1 the Cuban expedition because, "generally
speaking, the best of the National Guardsmen are in
the East and are concentrating at Tampa. Troops
like our Massachusetts men are schooled and steady
enough to fill the place of regulars."
With regard to the West it says: "The National
Guardsmen of Washington, Oregon, California, Colo
rado and Utah are splendid material for an effective
army, but as yet they are 'in the rough.' They have
not the perfect equipment nor the opportunities for
drill and discipline of the militia of the old Eastern
States, and it is judicious policy on a great expedition
of this kind to stiffen them with a powerful nucleus of
the regular troops of the United States."
There is nothing in this serene assumption of the
superiority of Eastern volunteers over those of the
West to find fault with. When all the trumpets of the
nation are blowing blasts of war we must of course
permit Massachusetts to blow her own little trumpet
along with the rest. We quote the blast not to con
demn it, but to approve it. The rivalry in war be
tween the sections and the States of the Union will
be as generous as that in times of peace. These little
local patriotisms are feeders to the great stream of
national patriotism and help to rouse men to high
exertions by awakening a spirit of emulation among
the soldiers of every State in the glorious galaxy of
the Union.
Of course we who live in the West know that this
claim of a superior breed of guardsmen on the part
of the Bostonian is simply an illustration of the per
fection which can be attained in boasting by a strict de
votion to bean 3 and culture, but we are not going to
get angry on that account Massachusetts has no
climate to brag about, nor any prunes; her poets are
all dead, her magazines have gone to New York and
her mills are going South, her statesmen are back
numbers, her college professors are mugwumps, her
best girls come West to hunt husbands, her largest
pumpkins are not bigger than Californian strawber
ries, and there is nothing left her now that is suffi
ciently bright to inspire a boast of local loyalty except
the uniforms of her ancient and honorable artillery.
So with a large Californian tolerance we welcome
the sounding challenge of the Boston bugle and will
leave it for the hazards of war to determine what vol
unteers shall show themselves most steady when the
battle rages. For the present we content ourselves
with pointing out that when the President called for
volunteers from the National Guard the guardsmen
of California responded at once and there was never
an objection to the call. It was different in Massa
chusetts. It took the Governor of that State and his
officers a good long time to decide whether the Mas
sachusetts guard could go at all or not as members
of the Volunteer Army.
In the first movement of the war, therefore, it was
the West and not the East that furnished guardsmen
best fitted to act with the promptness and unques
tioning obedience of regulars. With that exception
the claim of the Journal is all right, and we are glad
to know that it approve? of General Merritt and has
confidence that when they are no longer "in the
rough" the Western volunteers will make a pretty
good army.
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.
BY reason of the intense interest felt in the pre
parations for the invasion of Manila and in the
maneuvering of the hostile fleets in the West
Indies the people have but little attention to give to
the proceedings of Congress. In fact, if the â¢ two
houses would arrange for a prompt enactment of the
war revenue bill the country would then be well sat
isfied to see an immediate adjournment, leaving all
other issues to be dealt with at the coming winter
session.
While waiting for the solution of the revenue con
troversy, however, both houses have been transacting
more or less business and have even ventured, by way
of pastime probably, to put forward two propositions
for amending the constitution. The House proposes
an amendment which will provide for the election of
Senators by direct vote of the people, and the Senate
proposes one fixing the date of future inaugurations
on May 4 instead of March 4.
Each of these proposals has been before the public
in one form or another for a long time, and has con
siderable support among the people. Neither of them,
however, is at all likely to be pushed to settlement at
this time. The amendment changing the system of
electing Senators would certainly precipitate a fierce
contest with the conservative element of the people,
and no party would care to enter upon such a conflict
at this juncture.
The proposed change in the time of inaugurating
the President is one which ought to receive general
support. The beginning of March is an unfit time
for carrying out the ceremony of installing a new
occupant of the White House and for making a new
departure in the administration of the Government.
Even this measure, however, will be confronted by so
much conservative opposition it is not likely to make
any progress at this session.
Had both houses devoted their energies to a single
one of the two propositions perhaps something
might have been accomplished in the direction of
procuring its enactment. As, however, the Senate
has made one proposal while the House has made
the other, neither of them can be considered as much
more than a side issue. The statesmen of the two
houses evidently regard constitutional amendment
debates as very good and safe means of killing time,
and each is sufficiently considerate of the other not
to venture upon its preserves and not to use any of its
ammunition.
Arrest of milkmen who sell an impure article ought
to continue until the last rascal of the lot is safely in
jail. To adulterate milk is a crime somewhat after the
style of poisoning a well.
Those Cubans who were to devastate the island
and drive the Spanish into the sea the moment Amer
ican support was sure seem to have changed their
minds.
One reason for not getting excited about the plot
to blow up the Oregon n,..; be found in the circum
stance that there probably was no such plot.
Since the war began somebody has always been
getting "bottled up," but only by the astute Dewey
has any occupied bottle been found.
Not much interest will be taken in the Spanish ac
count of the Manila fight. People are too busy now
to read fiction.
There are reasons for believing that the first shots
to reach the Spanish ships will catch them in the
stern,
A LETTER FROM MR. MAGUIRE.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 21, 1898.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: I have read with interest your recent edi
torial attacks on me. Their chief qualities are falsehood and malice, or per
haps a pretense of malice to cover some meaner motive. The attacks were
not unexpected, as I had had an intimation that, the Evening Post being dis
credited, The Call would be the bell-wether of the railroad newspaper flock. I
found ample corroboration of this in the long and consistent records of some
of the present guiding spirits of The Call as political henchmen of the South
ern Pacific Company, and was therefore quite ready to credit the suggestion.
While your attacks did not surprise me, I was surprised by your utter
and shameless disregard of truth. I did not hope that you would be re
strained from falsehood by the promptings of your rudimentary conscience,
but relied rather upon your appreciation of the commercial value of truthful
ness which, it is said, sometimes exerts a controlling influence even among
less reputable men. Without giving the matter much thought, I did believe
that the new management of The Call would, as a matter of business, keep up
some semblance of the former honor of that once exemplary journal. But
I have been disappointed. The Call, "sad relic of departed worth," has fallen
to a level of journalistic depravity lower than that occupied by the Evening
Post, although it is hard to imagine why Lucifer should want any servant or
any instrument baser than the Post.
I dislike to deal In invective, but some occasions require It. There are
some kinds of wickedness that cannot be properly handled with gloves, and
The Call's mendacity comes within that category.
In forming this judgment, I do not hold you responsible for falsehoods
into which you may have been led by excusable mistake, but only for such
falsehoods as must have been written willfully, maliciously and with the cor
rupt intention to deceive.
FALSEHOOD NO. 1.
In your issue of May 9 you say that I admitted having said that "the
seizure of Spanish merchant ships â¢ * * â¢ was no better than piracy.
That statement is a willful, deliberate, premeditated falsehood. You knew It
to be false when you wrote it. You had the conclusive written evidence of
its falsity before you when you wrote it and when you published it. Why
then did you write and publish it? You had a motive. Every willful, de
liberate, premeditated falsehood has a motive, and the motive is never goodâ
never honorable.
That what I said was a perfectly proper argument against the passage
of a retroactive law, which might have undesirable effects, is as clear as
language could make it. It is equally clear that my statement involved no
criticism of the conduct of our naval officers who simply did their duty in
Stopping the ships and taking them to port, leaving the question of their
confiscation or release to be decided by the courts in accordance with the
existing law.
Even the conscienceless Evening Post recognizes this plain difference be
tween the statement originally attributed to me and the actual statement as
set forh in my Examiner interview, although, of course, like the accursed
Giaour," it returns to its loathsome work of defamation.
which, perforce.
Must feed its livid, living corse."
You, however, not only repeat the original misstatement. but willfully
write and publish as an admission made by me, a manifestly false statement
of what I said concerning It. .
You take a word here and a phrase there from my Examiner interview
Â«nd putting them together, with corrupt and deceitful intent, form and pub
lish a sentence entirely different from mine and attribute it to me. mat
infamous method of distortion can be practiced upon the writing of any
man. It does not even require cleverness, but only a base instinct for mis
representation. .Â»Â»_Â«â¢.
There is a passage in the. XIV Psalm which reads: "The fool in his heart
hath said: 'There is no God.'" Following your journalistic principle I can
imagine Borne fool crying out: "The Bible is an atheistic book. It says:
'There is no God.' (Psalms XIV.)"
My statement was made in defense of the honor of our flag, against leg
islation which, it seemed to me, would be discrpditable. It invoiced no criti
cism of our naval officers, nor even of the abstract rectitude of the bill itself,
but it did in plain and strong terms point out the inexpediency of taking a
position in favor of the seizure and confiscation of private property at sea
contrary to the general practice and agreement of nearly all other great
nations* of the civilized world. That general practice of the nations is defined
and regulated in the treaty of Paris. Assuming, as some contended, that
\he treaty of Paris places unreasonable restrictions upon the right
of prize-taking in time of war; assuming, as some contended, that
it would not be unfair or improper to pass a retroactive law involving the
confiscation of ships taken before the declaration of war, I took the position
that it would be inexpedient to pass such a law, because it would place us be
fore thc< world in the false position to which I called attention.
I am well aware that your are not alone in. entertaining and upholding
the contrary opinion, but I believe that the great majority of our fellow
countrymen are in favor of having our Government maintain the moral
standard of the treaty of Paris in all that pertains to respect for private
rights and property in times of war.
President McKinley has taken this view of the matter and, by proclama
tion on April 26 regulated the seizure of prizes in accordance with the terms
of the treaty erf Paris. The effect of the retroactive clause of the act recog
nizing the existence of a state of war, being beyond his jurisdiction, must be
determined by the courts.
Lincoln, of whom it was said that his brow was:
Pv honesty annointed.
While Wisdom taught him all her nobjest plan,
declared that: "The duty of protecting the honor of our flag rests as strong
ly upon those who legislate for the nation as upon those who fight her bat
tles on land and sea," . â â 
Let us cover our flag with the glories of victory; let us honor the soldiers
and sailors who carry it to triumph through the storms of battle, but let
us never forget that its honor is as sacred as its glory. Let us preserve its
character in war as well as in peace, as the emblem of the highest earthly
standard of justice.
Let us see that no breath of pollution
Shall tarnish one star on its fold.
Before this controversy arose, on April 28, 1898, C. C. Carlton, The Call's
Washington representative, asked me for the statement which I had made
on the 25th, and, particularly, if my language had any reference to the con
duct of our naval officers. I gave him the desired information in the form
of a signed statement as he requested. In the course of that statement I com
pared the position of our naval officers in seizing the ships in question to
that of a Sheriff serving a warrant or writ of attachment, leaving the rights
of the parties interested to be determined by the proper courts. I also said
that my remarks had no reference to the conduct of our naval officers in tak
ing the ships.
Of course it did not serve yo-ur purpose to publish that statement. Even
such show of fairness seems to be contrary to the present policy of The Call
now "held in vassalage by the demon of falsehood."
So much for what, in legal parlance, may be denominated "Falsehood
FALSEHOOD NO. 2.
In your issue of May 6, referring to me, you say:
"In his speech at the Henry George memorial services In this city last
year he said: 'Great problems affecting mankind had remained unsolved
before the coming of Henry George. Before his day professors, philosophers
and publicists had proposed to cut the Gordian knot with pools of blood.' "
That statement is another willful and malicious falsehood. I ÃBed no such
language at the George memorial services nor elsewhere.
I did not say that professors, philosophers and publMs'o. or any of them,
had "proposed to cut the Gordian knot," or any knot whatever. I did not
say that anybody had "proposed to cut the Gordian knot with pools of blood."
I did nr.-t use the phrase "pools of blood" in the speech at all. What I did say
was that philosophers, statesmen, theologians and other scholars "having
failed to suggest a satisfactory remedy for the soeiaJ injustice admittedly pre
vailing throughout the civilized world, there were those who proposed to cut
the Gordian knot, and wipe out the injustice in a carnival of blood."
On that occasion my audience was made up principally of educated ladles
and gentlemen, all of whom would have been so shocked and humiliated by
such an exhibition of Illiteracy on my part that they could never have for
gotten the circumstance, had I used the language which you attribute to me.
It is not strange that a reporter should blunder in attempting, from hia
own imperfect notes, to condense a two column address into three squares
of news matter. Newspaper reports of speeches are fearfully and wonderfully
made. It frequently happens that one reporter will attend a meeting, take
such notes as his fancy may suggest, and furnish copies thereof to the repre
sentatives of other papers; who, in turn, write up reports of the meeting
each giving variety to his report according to the quality of his imagination
(.r judgment. That overworked and underpaid reporters should make such
inaccurate reports is not particularly discreditable to them, but that the editor
of a newspaper pretending to greatness should take such a report of an ad
dress as a basis of literary criticism of thÂ«Â» speakpr, indicates a dishonesty
so infamous that its crimes against truth an-d justice are likely to be limitPd
only by its opportunities. eu
It is a favorite and often successful practice with political libelers tn

upon its traditions, but upon the principles of democracy, for which more
than ever since the days of Jefferson, the Democratic party now stands.
In your issue of May 9, referring to me, you Bay: "In 1800 the Demo
cratic party meantime not having changed its principles or professions, the
FALSEHOOD NO. 4.
Judge was back In the organization."
This is probably a very harmless false
hood, but it is false, and it is difficult to
imagine that you can have been so dense
ly ignorant as to believe it true. Do you
really believe that the Democratic party
did not make a material change in its
professions or purposes betmju
January, ISS7, and July, lffÂ»n?
Hundreds of thousands of IK'n
left the Democratic party and *ent
over to the Republican party in 1888, on
account of the Democratic National plat
form of that year, and a less number, but
still hundreds of thousands of Republi
cans came over to the Democratic party
on account of the same platform; yet,
with a sublime audacity, which brooks
no restraint of conscience, you assert that
there was no change in the professions of
the Democratic party during that period.
That partÂ«bf your article must have been
written to influence a very stupid and
very ignorant class of Call readers. If
you believed your own statement, in thi*
behalf, you must indeed Lave secured your
present position like the Right Honoraliio
Sir Joseph Porter, K. C. 8., through your
persistent avoidance of tTie manly ha^t
of thinking.
You may remember the thrilling narra
tive of Sir Joseph's promotion:
"I thought so iiuie they r<"wafse<J Rio,
By making me the ruler of the Queen s
navee."
Should it be desirable to immortalize your
present dignity in song, a little moa;;i
cation of ttfese lines of "Pinafore' might
serve the purpose. You might well sing:
"I thought so little they rewarded me.
And now I am editing The Call, as you
see."
FALSEHOOD NO. 5.
In your issue of May !Â», referring to me,
you say: "As chairman of the Metropoli
tan Temple meeting he sustained the
Buckley organization, which he denounced
in 1887."
That sentence contains two distinct
falsehoods. I was not chairman of the
Metropolitan Temple meeting to which
you refer and I did not sustain the Buik
ley organization.
I was present at the meeting in q>:
as a member of the general committee,
which was established by the r<
who drove Buckley and Rainey from their
control of the Democratic munlcipa
ganizatlon in 1892. The pending proposi
tion was to disband that general commit-
I opposed disbandment on tv >
grounds: First, that the method
pursued was irregular and undemoi r
and, secondly, that the disbandment :
the committt â Â« would restore Rainey to
the control of the Democratic party or
ganization in San Francisco. The contest
was between the old general committ- â .->.
and the committee which had held sway
during the last two years. Many i
with some reason, feared that this
committee might be dominated by Raine> ,
but your designation of the old commit
tee as a "Buckley organization' accords
fairly with your recklessness of state
ment in other matters. That committee,
or, more accurately speaking, the organ
izers of that committee, had <*rÂ»ren Buck
lev from power and the hostility of that
committee had kept him out of San Fran
cisco politics for four years before the
date of the meeting in question.
If yOUv OU base your statement upon tno
fact that a number of Democrats
prior to 1592, acted with Buckley i 3
Democratic municipal organization, were
with me. opposed to disbanding _ the old
committee, that fact affords no basis for
your .statement. An appeal to that fa< t
begs the whole question. If it was wrong
to disband the old committee should I
vote for that wrong simply because a few
of Mr Buckley's former associates were
In favor of the right course? Certainly
no sensible man will make that claim.
Your suggestion that I had denounced
their former organization and its prac
tices is quite true, but it does not fol
low that my feeling of hostility should
extend to the individuals so as to preju
dice me against them in their subsequent
Bffort to do what I believed to be right.
Early in life I learned that splendid
-hriptian motto: "Lord teach my soul
o hate the Bin and yet the sinner love.
[ have tried to apply that rule in all my
relations with my fellow-men. If. there
fore, you shall repent and return to ways

you, in all sincerity: "Misguided man,

tiOn '' THE LETTER OF IST.
You have rescued one of my letter from
the shades of oblivion and have shaken
from It the dust of eleven years. I trust
you may find it worth the spare you have
given o"t it. It is an interesting relic of
that period of opportunism which the
Democratic party has lons since out
grown. I have nothing now to say about
the 1. tter except that it represented my
sentiments when it was written. If you
are determined to fiine your bubbling
venom over the flowers of my thought, so
be it:
"TVhat is writ is writâ
"Would it were worthier.'

is that you shall not distort it nor fals
ify it. . A 1
I will not defend it as the perfection of

all that I have written I do affirm that it
represented my honest thoujrnt at the
time of its utterance.
You may think, and the public may at
first think, that I have given too much,
attention to you In this letter, but a long .
experience has convinced me that ono I
cannot give too much attention to a yen- i
omous serpent until he has extracted it 3 I

THE MALIGNANT MAGUIRE
That the shafts of Th? Call have been
sufficiently sharp and penetrating to
pierce the thick skin of Congressman
Maguire is made evident by the letter
from him which we publish this morn
ing. The hissing discharge of his bit
terest venom shows that he has felt the
keen point of the criticisms on hia
course and wr'thes under it.
Mr. Maguire doubtless thought that
his letter would be thrown by us into
the waste basket. He will be disap
pointed when he sees it this morning,
and his friends will regret that he wrote
it. The Call is a newspaper that never
suppresses either events or documents
of current interest, and this letter is
certainly interesting. It clearly reveals
what manner of man the writer is, and
it is well that the pubic should have
that knowledge.

GET WARM FOOD.
A Red Cross Meal Causes Vet-
erans From New Orleans
to Give Cheers.
Two regiments of United States infan
try, the Eighteenth and Twenty-third, ar
rived from New Orleans yesterday and
went into quarters close to General Otis'
h. -idQuartera at Camp Richmond.
i umpany A of the Battalion of Engi
numbering sixty men, in charge of
First Lieutenant C. P. Echols and Second
Lieutenant W. P. Connor, also arrived,
coming direct from Willits Point, New
York.
With the arrival of these troops all the
available space in the old Bay District
track, with the exception of two squares
immediately east and south of General
Otis' headquarters, are occupied by
troops. Tho â¢ reservation of these two
blocks, while the First Montana has been
cTned to a. location north of Point Lo-
UU-. avenue, three blocks distant from the
main camp, and the two regiments from
the Dakotas will also go there, indicate
that more regulars are expected here in
the near future, though, so far as known,
none have been ordered to this point,
with the exception of the headquarters
and four troops of the Fourth Cavalry.
As these will in all probability be quar
tered at the Presidio, the chances are
that at least two more regiments of in
fantrj will be ordered here in the imme
diate future.
The Twenty-third Infantry, eight com
panies was the first to arrive, landing at
the Market street ferry at 11 "a. m. It
would not be just to compare them with
volunteers, but somehow even the women,
when they saw the men marching off the
boat, exclaimed:' "Those must be regu
lars!"â¢
Pt-rhaps the completeness of their out-
Jits aided somewhat in their recognition,
but that soldierly bearing that can only
bo acquired by long experience, was their
most distinctive feature. Even â¢ the re
cruitsâand there were many of them â
bore themselves differently from their
volunteer comrades who a month ago
v ere occupied on the farm, at the bench.
or in the office.
Bronzed by the Southern sun, under
â tthieh the regiment has been stationed for
eoine years, the men are a fine looking
k>t. Quickly they stacked their arms on
the dock and then marched into the head
quarters of the Red Cross Society with
tne determination to not leave anything
In the way of edibles for those who were
to follow. The ladies had been given am
ple notice of their coming, however, and
were fully prepared. Hot meat stew, cof
fee, sandwiches, bread and butter, fruits
and pastries of all kinds were heaped be
fore them, and officers and men were not
slow In getting down to work.
'â¢Have we done it?" asked a young lieu
tenant of a surpassingly pretty girl who
had kept his plate filled for half an -hour
spite his best efforts. As he spoke he
glanced around the big room and saw
the others fairly gasping from their ex
ertions, and all had called a halt.
"Done what?" asked tho pretty girl,
with a puzzled air.
â¢ Eaten up everything from the Eight
eenth," replied the officer. "You see, re
ports of the work of you ladies reached
us on the road, and as we have a good
healthy lot of feeders in our regiment
and were ahead of the Eighteenth we i
thought we'd play a joke on the others |
by causing a famine in the Red Cross
Society betore they got here."
"Oh. is that it? Well, we're willing,
but you'll have to start in again, for you
* haven't began to reach the limit, of our
supplies yet. Have some more of tht
Btew, won't you?"
"No, 1 can't; really, I'm disappointed,
but I'll have to call it off. and 1 guess
the others will, too, judging by their ap
pearance."
The members of the Twenty-third were
disappointed at the failure of their joke,
but they were profoundly grateful to
their entertainers, who had supplied
th'Â«n w.th the first warm meal they had
eaten since they left New Orleans. After
the regimental band had played several
selections U.e entire command joined in
three enters -for the Red Cross Society,
: which -were repeated again and again.
Then they marched out to where their
arms and accoutrements had been stack
ed and were Boon on their way up Mar
ket F'ireet to camp, cheered by thousands
of people along the- route. *

While the Twenty-third Infantry was at
breakfast, the company of engi
neers arrived and waited for a chance at
the tables. Their turn soon came, and
they made glad the hearts of the ladies
by their enthusiastic onslaught on the
commissariat. This company will proceed
to Manila with the second expedition for
the purpose of rebuilding the fortifica
tions at Cavite and Corrigidor and min
ing the entrance to the harbor as a safe
guard against an attack by Spanish war
ships.
The Eighteenth Infantry camÂ© In shortly
after noon and were bountifully provided
for as their predecessors had been, and
again the huge ferry building rang with
cheers for the Red Cross Society. The
ladies seemed to take particular pleasure
in showering attentions upon the regu
lars, and their favors were as keenly ap
preciated as they have been by any of the
volunteers.
Like the Twenty-third, the Eighteenth
Infantry is composed of eight companies,
averaging seventy men each, Several

SOLDIERS WILL PAY FARE.
Why Men at the Presidio De
cline the Union Street
Road's Offer.
There Is not a man In San Francisco
so thoroughly enthused over the good
work of the Red Cross Society as J. B.
Stetson, the millionaire merchant and
street railway magnate. Day after day
he spends many hours at the headquarters
at the ferry depot, cheering the ladies, the
arriving troops, the bands, and in fact
everybody and everything. Every time a
shout goes up Mr. Stetson's voice is
pitched above all the others; whenever
there is a waving of hats the shining
silk tile that adorns the merchant's head
swings higher and more frantically than
the rest.
And the California street cable road
waxes fatter each day on the scanty
nickels of the boys in blue.
Perhaps it is not Mr. Stetson's fault
that this condition still exists, but it does
exist, and the men at the Presidio, as I
shown by the following statement, are
loth to accept the generous offer of the
Union street line, while its ally reaps all
the profit.
The Union street road and the Hyde
street branch of the California street line
exchange transfers, and the only way by
which the men at the Presidio can reach
the center of the city is to transfer at
Union and Hyde to the California street
line.
The Union street road has issued an or
der that all soldiers in uniform shall rive
free, but of course it does not issue |
transfers to its connections. When the j
men board the Hyde street car they must
pay full fare and as they object to that
road receiving all the money at the ex
pense of the Union street line, they will
insist upon paying fare upon that road
until the other gives them permission to
ride free. When fare is paid and a trans
fer given, each road receives. 2% cents.
The communication- calling attention to
this condition is as follows:
Presidio, San Francisco, Hay 29.
To the Editor of The Call-Sir: On behalf
of the enlisted men stationed at this post,
regulars and volunteers. I wish to state that
while we are profoundly grateful to the Pre
sidio and Ferries Cable Company for having
extended to us the privilege of riding free on
Us cars, we feel that under the present condi
tions we would be doing it a great injustice to
accept its offer. Our only means of reaching
Market street is by that line to Hyde street
and transferring to the California street
tern, which lands us at O'Farrell and Mar-
Ret
At present we are charged full fare on the
latter road, after riding free on the Union
street line, and as the boys do not care to
have one company take it all, we shall Insist
upon paying our fare on the Union street cars
The men in the regular service do not mind
this but it is hard on the volunteers, who
have received no pay yet and in consequence
most of them are "broke." Those men have
never seen the objects of interest in San Fran
cisco and they could spend their leisure hours
in sight-seeing were they enabled to get down
town but as it is they must either walk or
remain close within their quarters.
Trusting that upon having its attention call
ed to this matter the California street company
will follow the example of the Union street
line at least =o far as the volunteers are con
corned, I am. respectfully. & MQRRKLI ,

SERVICES IN CAMP.
It Was Chaplain's Day Among
the Encamped Soldiers.
San Francisco went out to Camp Rich
mond yesterday. The thousands of vis
itors battled with great disadvantage
against the. wind and du.st. Despite this,
however, numberless curious and eager
people passed continuously through the
various camps.
The Sabbath was observed in nearly
all of the different regimental camps, and
in those in which no services were held
the soldiers were permitted to go to
church or to attend the service In some
neighboring camp. In the Seventh the
chaplain, Captain Clark, held service at
10 a. m. The companies were marched
into the regimental street, "where a short
service was read to them. The band
played "My Country. "Tis of Thee," and
the men sanj.. Chaplain Clark preached
from Proverbs, lv:2S, "Keep thy heart
with all diligence, for out of it are the
issues of life." He referred to the death
of Private Pruett, who died last week of
pneumonia, and alluded to Memorial day
and the heroic patriotism that its exer
cises commemorate. .__-_:.
Father Yorke, assisted by Father Mac-
Donald, held s< rvict-s in a tent erected at
the southeast corner of the Kansas camp
by the Sisters of the Holy Fair. The
League of the Cross Cadet Band ren
dered the music. Services were held in
the camp of the First Colorado by
Chaplain Fleming, and also in the First
Nebraska by Chaplain Moilly. The men
of the latter regiment were excused from
noon until retreat by Colonel Bratt, and
the boys all took advantage of the op
portunity to visit the various points of
interest about the camp.
The Kansas Regiment yesterday re
ceived a large amount of supplies from
the quartermaster's department, includ
ing shoes, shirts, socks and underwear.
The rustruments for the band have also
been purchased with the donations by
generous Kansas citizens and yesterday
the band played for the first time. Only
two cases of measles were reported yes
terday in the regiment, and these were
nuickiy quarantined.

MORAL FORCES ALERT.
The Christian Endeavor Union
Begins Good Work in
Camp.
The Christian Endeavorers have found
large numbers of their members among
the various Eastern regiments of volun
teers now at Camp Richmond. In one
of the Kansas companies forty out of the
eighty-three men belong to the organiza
tion and have formed a Christian En
deavor Society of their own. One of the
Minneapolis companies has thirteen young
men from one small Baptist church of
that city, headed by Sidney Pratt, sou
of Mayor Pratt of that city.
The California State Union has seized
the opportunity to institute a system of
reading and writing rooms in the camp,
where the men, regardless of religion,
(â¢reed or color, may gather to read or
write letters home. These tents are fur
nished with pen, ink, pencils, paper and
envelopes to be used free of charge, and
keep a supply of stamps and postal cards
on hand for sale.
General Merritt and General Otis have
sanctioned the plan and allowed space
in each regiment for the erection of tents.
The work is In direct charge of Misn Min
dora L. Berry. State superintendent of
missions, and she is ably assisted by a
large corps of workers from Golden Gate
Christian Endeavor Union. During the
day ladies will be in charge of the tents.
The tents may aIBO be used at certain
times for praise services if a desire is
expressed by the men for such at any
time.
The general headquarters have been es
tablished in the tt-nt of the KanÃas Regi
ment, but Monday will be transferred to
Scott & McCloud's warehouse, where the
citizens of San Francisco may send all
the reading matter they have at hand,
and it will be distributed from time to
time in the various regiments as needed.
There is a large demand for reading mat
ter by the ,90Â«W men now in camp, and it
will take large quantities to rill the de
mand.
The expense of this work will be con
siderable, but the State Union feels that
the demand is one not to be overlooked,
and the officers have no doubt but that
the local members and societies will give
freely to the work. A call will be issued
next week for contributions to be sent
to Miss Berry at 7Â«uA Harrison street.
Mrs. C. S. Wright has issued a call for
a mass meeting of Christian mothers, to
be held in the Endeavor headquarters
Tuesday at 2 p. m., to assist the young
people in their good work. The older
members of all the city churches are in
vited to attend and see the need and ap
preciation of the soldier boys for all of
the efforts being put forth in their behalf
by the citizens of California.
One of the surprising features of the
big army camp being established in the
city is the inability of book concerns to
supply the demands for cheap editions of
the New Testament. The demand has
been simply enormous. Not only in the
city, but from all over the State orders
are pouring in from dealers who have
numerous calls which they cannot supply.
At present it is said there are none to be
had in San Francisco.
The greater demand for these Testa
ments comes from the makers of the com
fort bags, as each of these has a Testa
ment along with the other useful articles,
and the cheap edition is desired, as they
take up less room and can be carried in
any pocket without the least inconveni
ence.
THE FIELD HOSPITAL.
Every Comfort and Attention
Provided for the Sick.
To-day will see the completion of the
big field hospital of Camp Richmond, and
it is about as nearly complete as any
field hospital can possibly be. The loca
tion is somewhat removed from the camp
proper, but there will be every facility
for attenumg to the sick. The hospital
is located just west of the Montana Regi
ment and is bounded by Point Loboa,
Jordan, Michigan and California avenues.
The hospital covers an entire square and
for the present it will be under the
charge of Captain Owen and Lieutenant
Page. U. S. A.
It has three large double hospital tents,
facing on Point Lobos avenue, that are
capable of accommodating forty men. To
the west of these is the chief steward's

CANNOT TELL. THE TRUTH.
The Examiner Taken to Task
by Utah Artillerists for Pub-
lishing a Yellow Fake.
The yellow Journal is at it again. After
publishing a blood-curdling fake on Sat
urday morning regarding the poisoning
of men in the First Nebraska Regiment,
yesterday it published an article regard
ing the distribution of a company fund
in the Light Utah Battalion in which the
facts were so distorted that the officers
and men of the battery are placed in the
position of being at loggerhends over th<>
division of the company fund, the men
mutinous, ill treated and half starved,
and the officers painted as unsympa
thetic and merciless autocrats.
The facts in the case are as follows:
The battalion left Salt Lake City with
a purse of $SOO raised by a committee for
the benefit of the men enlisted from that
city and county. Captains Young- and
Grant were empowered by the committee
to distribute the money equally among

the two batteries for such men as it was
Intended. Saturday, at the suggestion of
Captain Young, the men held a meeting.
The captain submitted the proposition
that the money should be used as a com
pany fund and kept for cases of emer
gency, and that such men as were not
beneficiaries of the purse under the reso
lution of the committee should at the
next two pay days put in their pro rata
amount and all have an equal share in
the purse. The men. after considering
Captain Young's proposal, stated that
they would like to borrow the entire
purso and pay it back out of their money
at tho next two pay days. This Captain
Young refused to consider, as he was
empowered to disburse the purse as he
thought best, and he thought the men
would spend it for articles they really did
not need, and that the batteries would
be without funds when they left here.
However, he gave each man in his
company $3, and Captain Grant distrib
uted $2 among his men. There is no dis
satisfaction among the men and they are
well ted and have plenty of fresh meat.
This statement is made by The Call at
the request of Captains Young and Grant,
who desire that the truth may be known.
CALIFORNIA RANGERS.
The First Battalion Drilled and
Inspected on Van Ness
Avenue.
The FirÃt Battalion of the California
Rangers was put through a number of
evolutions on Van Ness avenue yesterday
afternoon, and considering the fact that
they have Just been organized, they made
a most creditable showing. They are a
fine body of men and have been selected
for their horsemanship and marksman
ship. The four companies are In com
mand respectively of Captains Waller,
Lewis, Lockhart and Ross. After being
put through their evolutions they were in
spected by General Hart and Colonel
George W. Fox.
The "Second Battalion has Its headquar
ters at Healdsburg and the Third Bat
talion at San Luis Obispo. The regiment
could be mustered In for service in five
days, and as it has been recommended by
the California delegation General Hart
expects to receive orders from Washing
ton this week to have the regiment in
readiness for active service.
The Rangers will be really mounted
riflemen, and an effort will bo made to
haye them armed with the Lee rifle. They
will be serviceable as cavalry, artillery or
Infantry. Each company will consist of
1W men. Colonel Fox and most of the
officers of. the regiment have seen service
In the civil war.
A COLORADO KICK.
Yellow Journalism Gets That
. Regiment Mixed Up With
the Minnesotans.
The Editor of The Call: The Examiner
of Saturday morning stated that the Min
nesota Regiment would give a dress pa
rade that evening, the first ceremony of
the kind to be held In camp. This morn
ing it said "the dress parade of the Min
nesota Regiment was the feature of the
day," and highly praised the appearance
of the troops and execution of the move
ments and manual. The above state
ments are correct and very satisfactory
except that the word "Colorado* should
be substituted for "Minnesota, and it
should be explained that Instead of be
ing the first parade in camp It was merely
the regular parade given daily by the
Colorado Regiment since its arrival.
We are here for work, and not especi
ally seeking newspaper notoriety, but as
the Examiner saw fit to speak in such
complimentary terms of our parade, we
would like to have the above correction
made as a matter of justice and lnfor
.nation to the P^ bKAJ3Q pRIVATB .
War Incidents.

membership was informed that any one
of the council going to the front will be
maintained in good standing while in the
service of the United States.
Excelsior Circle of the Companions of
the Forest of America on last Saturday
visited Camp Richmond and distributed
a large amount of food to the soldiers.
Mrs Julia Wishman. the chief compan
ion of the circle, distributed about fifty
pouches of tobacco, which the majority
of recipients appreciated much more than
pies and cakes.
Several of the fraternal societies who
are anxious to do something for the sol
diers who are going to the front have
asked "What is best to give?" The an
swer has been "<3lve the boys suspen
ders, plain, strong, serviceable ones, shoe
laces and patent snap buttons for trou
sers that are put on without sewing.
These are needful articles and will always
be handy."
Professor Charles F. Graeber and his
mandolin, guitar and banjo club of sixty
or more will volunteer their services in
aid of the Red Cross Society at any time
such may be needed.
In Memory of the Dead.
Last Thursday night the members of
Lincoln Relief Corps, auxiliary to the
Grand Army of the Republic, held memo
rial services In memory of their deceased
fellow-membersâ Mrs. Carrie L. Arm
strong and Mrs. Annie Luther, who
passed away during the year preceding.
There was a short Impressive service,
which included music by Dot S. Martin
and an address by Alice L. Staples, the
secretary.
Mrs. Armstrong, one of the membfÂ«
who died, left two sons, one of whom ha^
since her death Joined the navy and is
now at the front.
The members of this corps will to-day
assist the Grand Army in arranging the
flowers for the decoration of the soldiers'
graves.
STREAM BROUGHT BACK.
ThÂ© Thieving Watchmaker Safely
Landed in the City Prison.
Fred Stream, who a short time ago
stole a number of watches valued at sev
eral thousand dollars from Hammer
smith & Field, Jewelers, by whom he waa
employed, and who waa arrested in Ta
coma by a brother of Mr. Hammersmith,
arrived here last night on the steamer
Topeka and was turned over to Detec
tives Dillon and Crockett. He was taken
to the City Prison and booked on a
charge of grand larceny.
Stream was employed by the Jewelry
firm in the capacity of watch repairer.
During an evil moment he appropriated
the most costly watches which were in
his care and pawned them, realizing only
a small amount. With the proceeds of
his crime he went to Seattle, where- he
was traced by Charles Hammersmith.
Before the latter reached the Queen City
Stream, evidently knowing that he waa
being followed, took the steamer for Ta
coma. Hammersmith pursued him, final
ly overtaking him as he was about to dis
embark from the steamer. Stream offer
ed no objection when told that he would

SOCIALISTS
IN POLITICS
Convention Nominates a
State Ticket.
THE CAMPAIGN DISCUSSED.
PRINCIPLES OF THE NATIONAL
PLATFORM ARE INDORSED.
Address to the â Tribute to i
the Memory of the Author of
"Looking Back
ward."
The Socialist Labor party of California,
represented by Its delegates, spent yes
terday in passing resolutions, nominating
a State ticket and discussing and adopt
ing plans for the State campaign. The
sessions were held in the Turk Street
Temple, and were presided over by Chair
man James Andrew of Berkeley, the sec
retary being Oliver Everett of San Fran
cisco.
The following address to the public,
presented by the committee on resolu
tions and platform, was adopted:
The Socialist Labor party of California, in
convention assembled, views with admiration
the ardent spirit of humanity which has im
pelled the worktngmen of this country to vol
unteer their lives and services to politically
emancipate the suffering- Cubans from the
barbarous expression of the Kingdom of
Spain. We extend the sympathy of American
â workinffmen to the oppressed Cubans and to
Bpanish workers who are trying to overthrow
the hateful despotism which is destroying
them.
Fellow workersâ the capital class, which is
the enemy of the oppressed Cubans and Span
ish workfngmen. is also our enemy. The cap
italist class show by their actions in the pres
ent war thier real spirit; while professing
great love for this country, they charge ex
orbitant rates for transportation and supplies,
feed our soldiers of unfit and unsuffietent food,
while the capitalists themselves enjoy their
ill-gotten gains at a safe distance from the
enemy.
We recognize that the patriotism of the
workers is enthusiasm for humanity, while
the patriotism of the capitalists is enthusiasm
for profits. We heartily commend the self
sacrifices of the former and condemn the self
seeking of the latter. Profit and not service
is the measure of capitalistic patriotism.
We therefore call upon the workingmen of
this country to be true to their own Interests
and those "of their wives and children, and
turn a deaf ear to the capitalist class, who rob
them economically all the year round as a re
ward for political support on election day;
and
Whereas. The life of a poor man is as dear
to him as is the life of the rich man to him.
and more necessary to the support of his wife
and children: and
Whereas, An overwhelming majority of those
who have volunteered to serve as private sol
diers in the United States army in the war
with Spain have come from the ranks of the
wage-working, non-property owning class, we
demand that in case conscription becomes
necessary to keep thÂ» army up to a war stand
ard that the conscripts be drawn from the
ranks of the property-owners, the percentage
of men to be drawn from each class of prop
erty owners, graded according to the wealth
possessed by the individual of the class, shall
be in proportion to the total percentage of
the national wealth possessed by that class;
. We further demand that no man conscripted
phall be allowed to purchase a substitute to
take his place in the ranks of the army.
The following tribute to the memory of
' the author of "Looking Backward" was
adopted :
Whereas, In the death of Edward Bellamy
the cause of. human progress has suffered the
loss of a great and good friend: and
Whereas, The Socialists of the State of Cali
fornia, represented by the Socialist Labor
Party, desire to testify to the respect and
honor with which we regard the memory of
this philanthropist and author;
Resolved. That we tender to his widow and
children our sincere sympathy, and assure
them that the high ideals and glorious aspira
tions which he has implanted in the minds of
oppressed and down-trodden millions, will e^r
remain an enduring and living monument to
his loving heart and his noble life.
The committee on platform and resolu
tions, recommended the following, which
were adopted:
That we heartily Indorse the principles and
tactics of the Socialist Labor Party of the
United States, outlined in the national plat
form.
The following supplementary resolutions
were adopted:
First, while the means of producing and dis
tributing wealth are in the possession of pri
vate capitalists, the condition of the wage
working masses will not be materially im
' proved by a gold standard or a bi-metallio
standard, or by any other money standard that
might be adopted.
Second, we denounce the present tramp law
of California as an infamous and criminal
measure, furnishing a pecuniary harvest to a
lot of political barnacles known as constables
and Justices of the peace, at the cost of great
Injustice to every worker in search of work,
and we demand the repeal of said law.
We demand that no person shall be detained
or punished for vagrancy in California until
said person, being physically able, shall have
refused an offer by the community of a chance
to earn a living at wages not less than the
- average wages of unskilled labor.
It was decided to nominate a complete
State ticket, and in accordance with this
resolution the following nominations were
made: Governor, Job Harriman of Los
Angeles; Lieutenant Governor, James
Andrew of Berkeley; Secretary of State,
Emil Leiss of San Francisco; Public In
structor, Jane A. Roulston of San Fran
cisco; Comptroller, John Robertson of
Cotati; Surveyor General, George Smith
of Oakland; Clerk of the Supreme Court.
Leonard D. Biddle of Los Angeles; Attor
ney General. A. F. Straun-Hamilton of
San Francisco; Superintendent of State
Printing. A. Conti of San Francisco;
Treasurer, E. M. Dewey of Tulare.
The Congressional nominations were
left to the Socialist organizations of each
district.
M. W. Wilkins made an eloquent and
earnest speech" in support of the State
ticket, saying, among other things, that
nothing would be left undone to show the
people of California that the Socialists
are sincere and that they exercise consid
erable influence in political affairs.
Last evening Job Harriman, the nomi
nee for Governor, spoke to the American
Branch of the Socialists, at 35 Eddy
street.
THE HIGH CHIEF RANGER.
Q. A. McElfresh of the Independent â 
Order of Foresters Banqueted
by His Deputies.
George A. McElfresh. high chief ranger !
of the Independent Order of Foresters of |
the Jurisdiction of California, who re
cently arrived in this city from Los An
geles, was on last Saturday night the
guest of his San Francisco deputies and i
a few of his friends' at a banquet given i
in his honor at the Nevada Restaurant i
A guest of the deputies was. Lieutenant
Walsh of the Thirteenth Minnesota :
Volunteers, who is a promiment member I
of the order in his State. Those present |
besides the two named were: (.'. S. Peery I
vice high chief ranger; B<-n L Salomon' j
chief deputy; l>r. H. M. Bock, Walter I '

Presley, A. L. McMlllen, J. E. Emmons

Stewart. J. H. Machan, Dr. Joseph o'
Crawford and E. Stock.
After the menu had been disposed of
the chief deputy acting as chief of cere
monies for the evening- called upon the i
vice high chief ranger for a response to |
"The Interest and Welfare of the Order." i
Lieutenant Walsh responded to "Our
Country" and took occasion to tell about:
the order in Minnesota: I)r. Crawford ]
favored with a charming recitation, "Jim
Mead, Who Saved the Colonel's Daugh
ter." Then the high chief ranger who
was nnt assigned any toast, but requested I
to speak on any theme, delivered a very
Interesting address upon tfci order and
Its rise, and dwelt particularly upon the
fact that the supreme chief ranger, Oron
hyatekah. had since the w r ar broke out
given a blanket permit to any member
of the order who has entered or may en- |
ter service of the United States in any |
capacity during the war to go to any part i
of the world to which duty shall call him |
without increasing rates or jeopardizing I
hi? rights in any way. He also spoke in a
patriotic strain for some time and his
remarks were loudly applauded. He was
followed by a short address by the mas
ter of ceremonies and one by L. Bagart,
after which the party bid Lieutenant

EXCURSIONISTS
BADLY SCARED
The Schooner Mary F.
Cruz in Collision.
DAMAGED THE GOLDEN GATE
THE VESSEL CROWDED WITH
HOLIDAY MAKEES.
Repairs to the Revenue Cutter Will
Cost a Thousand Dollars â The
Schooner Lost Her Bow
sprit.
The schooner Mary F. Cruz was in se
rious trouble on the bay early yesterday
morning. The vessel started out on a
pleasure cruise with about seventy ex
cursionists on board. ; but inside of an
hour the trip wound up in a collision, and â¢ j
i the badly scared pleasure seekers were
only too "glad to get once more on terra
firma.
Early in thÂ© morning the excursionists
boarded the schooner at Mission street
wharf. The intention was to have a
first-class time, and everything necessary
to obtain that result was on board. To j
j the strains of music the party left the
' wharf and headed up the bay. After a
! run to Hunters Point and over to the Al
i ameda shore the vessel was headed for j
I Meiggs wharf. In attempting to go about ;
| she missed stays and crashed into the
revenue cutter Golden Gate. The schoon
er's jibboom went through the steamer'3
! cabin with the first jab and pierced the
i captain's cabin with the second. Lieuten- ,
| ant Butt thought it was a Spanish gun- J
I boat, and lost no time in getting on deck. ;
In the meantime the Mary F. Cruz was !
! still bumping away at the Golden Gate, :
' and each bump carried away a portion of
! the Government vessel. The screams of
i the frightened excursionists could be
| heard a mile away, and nearly all of j
| them took advantage of the boats being .
close together to clamber aboard the ;
I Golden Gate and thence to the wharf.
Shortly afterward the vessels drifted [
apart. The schooner lost her bowsprit j
i and the Golden Gate is damaged to the j
i extent of $1000. â¢ |
Mrs. Pearl of Angel Island had a nar
row escape from drowning a few days :
ago. She drove down to the wharf to
meet the steamer McDowell, and her
horse, taking fright, backed overboard
with her. In the fall Mrs. Pearl struck
the water first and the wagon fell on top
of her. After some trouble she got
ashore. The wagon also was saved, but
the horse was drowned.
Officer George Lake of the Harbor Po
lice met with a painful accident last Sun
! day morning early. He and Officer Ma
i honey saw a couple of men acting in a.
1 suspicious manner on East street, and as \
j they moved toward them the men took to 'â 
! their heels. The officers gave chase, and j
i when going at full speed Lake stubbed ;
j his toe against a loose plank and turned
1 a complete somersault. He was cut and !
| scratched in a dozen places. His wounds i
I were dressed by Dr. Deas at the Harbor
j Receiving Hospital.
The work of getting the Zealandia, Chi- :
i na and Colon ready for their trip to Ma- â 
nila will begin to-morrow. Yesterday a
deatchment of troops was sent to the
! Mail dock, and they will keep watch over
I the vessels until they leave the wharf.
People who failed to get out on tugs and i
steamers to see the transports away last '
I week are taking time by the forelock on j
! this occasion. Parties of them were ,
i around the front yesterday chartering j
i every tug in sight, and those who have
j been laying back expecting to get a boat
the day the transports sail will be disap
! pointed.
The British ship Rahane arrived from
Newcastle, N. S. W., yesterday with a
cargo of coal, after a lengthy passage of
seventy-eight days. She was delayed by
light winds and calms.
ELK AND BUFFALO BABES
INTEREST PARK VISITORS.
i SOLDIERS ANT> OTHERS VIEW
SIGHTS AT THE BEACH.
Two Thousand Volunteers Enjoy Su
tro Baths at One Time, Conclud
ing the Sport With Many
Swimming Races.
There were thousands of strangers at
j the park and beach yesterday. Though
! the weather was windy and disagreeable
the crowds were very large and the en
thusiasm of spectators great. There was
a noticeable absence of city visitors and
a corresponding increase of soldiers and
strangers.
Superintendent McLaren, of the park,
was delighted over an increase in his I
pets. He found a baby buffalo yesterday
I morning, and a baby elk the day before.
! The infants excited great interest.
"I have named them Dewey and Samp
' son, respectively," said the superintend
! ent, "for they were born in times that
will be noted by naval events."
Thousands of people viewed the babes
in their semi-wild surroundings yester- j
I day, commenting on the odd appearance \
I of creatures of such types in surroundings
! like the park. The mother of the buffalo
| was very cross, and no one could ven-
I ture anywhere near her offspring.
There were thousands at the Cliff also !
during the day, the attraction being a I
swimming contest between soldiers of va- j
rious States, at Sutro Baths. At one
i time there were fully 2000 soldiers in the
! water. The race resulted as follows:
Fifty yard race, won by A. Chambers,
Company H, Kansas; seventy-yard race,
I wnn by G. E. Griggs, Company P, Wy
oming: 100-yard race, won by H. E.
Sleater, Battery A, Utah; 150-yard race,
I a dead heat between B. Davidson and
' H. H. Hecwer, Company B, Third Bat

Not Likely That Fabiola Will Ever
Again Receive a Benefit Day
at the Rac*
Track.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, May 29.
This is a time for heroes, not politicians, j
During the past week nearly the whole of j
Oakland has seen thousands of soldiers i
march through the streets of San Fran- j
actuated by no other motive than
that of serving their country. In view
of these stirring developments the politi
cal turmoil in this county is regarded by
comparison as a very picayunish affair.
Politicians have almost to apologize for
not being soldiers, and the boys in blue
can have anything they want.
It has been amusing to see the vast im
portance attached by a few interested In
dividuals to Borne of the politicaJ fandan
goes of the week. They have aroused no
excitement and loss general interest, and, j
In fact, bo nauseating has the prevalence
of personal politics become that there |
would be a Say of thanksgiving and re
joicing if Alameda's politicktns were to
organize a volunteer company and offer
themselves for service in Manila or any
place that would keep them away until
after next November.
It is rather a hard matter just now for
an office-seeker to preach patriotism, and I
et this time the public feels inclined to re- I
â ward nothing elne. A candidate talking j
.ism to an audience stands in great j
danger of being a^ked why he does not
wear a blue coat himself. The public just
now is very discerning, and platform ora
tors who will attempt to pave tneir way
Into office with stars and stripes and talk
cf banners subject themselves to all kinds
of inquisitive remarks.
A volunteer company composed of men
who nightly appear on political parade
would at once excite the admiration of
the whole county and would strike such
terror into the hearts of the Spaniards
that the war would end lnstanter.
A new art is being rapidly developed
in this county. It is the art of capturing
Itical meeting called by onÂ© faction
by an overwhelming force from another
n. Such actions are not at all now,
they have hitherto been known as
or a name not at all eu-
Buch jobs implied the of
. vulgar language and a general
rough time, resulting in a score
of arrests for battery and simi
lar ungentlemanly conduct. All this
is changed, and there is in this
city a well organized bar-d of young Re
publicans who are forever working to
turn everything their own way. They do
tent. but simply enter
the hall in such numbers that they can
control every vote. When the gentlemen
who called the meeting realize the situa
.:â¢â  an adjournment, the
visitors .'. the promoters of the
gathering leave, and the invaders proceed
to eiect a new sot of officers and transact
â¢ themselves. Prec< dents
it at naught, enthusiasm Is aroused,
and tnr boys retire to plan to capture the
â¢
m of stealing each other's
thunder may not add to the dignity of the
party, but there is in it one good element, i
It arouses opposition, antagonism, com
rhaps a little personal feei
gs out the party men, cs
v the young men of the party. It
lies party warfare, and hundreds of
those who have- been deluded in the past
ait' now entering the Republican ranks
for the life there is in it. After a little
while they will accent Republican prin
:'rom conviction, and the good work
is complete.
No one is pomp to win anything In poll-
In Alameda County without a figrht.
8 are too many model candidates for
and too few offices to permit of
ivers. There must be contests and
: nship until the constitution is over
turned, and all must admit that it arouses
new and prolonged interest in the party.
As a matter of fact these, preliminary
skirmishes are being taken altogether too
They are arousing both sides
. n, and are but toe amoke indica
tive o* the lire, the flames as yet not hav
ing burst forth. At present all the poli
tics is being inspired by thuse who have
personal Interesta ;it stake. "When the
time for th* primaries is announced there
will be more Kepublicans in Aiameda
County than ever before, and aft^r the
primaries all is guesswork. Alameda
County is rarely deceived by the veneer
of politics and politicians.
Fabiola day is past and its receipts
from the racetrack are now in the treas
ury of that great institution; Tunnel day
13 now history, ar.d its receipts will soon
be paying many laborers for their toil,
and the racing season is now closed for
six months. Everybody can therefore
take a breathing spell and think a little
about horse'Tacinjj and its use to the
public welfare in general and to Dr.
Dille's remarks in particular. This is a
good time to ask Oakland just where ehe
Ts on the subiect of the racetrack and its
influence*. To outsiders It must look as
though this city were carrying water on
both shoulder;;. Many merchants can be
found who declare that when November
1 arrives business decreases, as all the

surplus money of the spending classes !
goes to the racetrack. None can be |
.ound who will defend gambling, but
nearly all denounce it. All know that
without the gambling the track could not
run a single day. Yet nearly all con
sented to do something that insured the
reaping of a public benefit at the hands
of the track. With regard to Fabiola the
same argument holds good, except that
the ladies, even some on the board of di
rectors, have made stronger arguments
against the influence of the track than
the men. Now then, the question arises,
is the price paid by the racing peopleâ
and which In reality is only about one
third paid by them* because of the in
creased attendance encouraged â¢ to tlje
track by those interested in the benefits
equal in value to the license thus publicly
accorded it. and which Dr. Dille very
aptly called "a certificate of respectabil
ity?" It is no exaggeration to say that,
in the public eye, Thomas Williams is at
present the greatest benefactor this city
has known since James G. Fair built the
narrow-gauge railroad.
How long is this hallucination to last?
Surely it cannot be necessary for some
public official to loot a treasury or fill
a suicide's grave or be a fugitive before
the film will fail from the public eye.
Analyze the situation and we find that
if $6000 is received for both these bene
fits (?) fully one-half of it has been due
to the energy, not of the racetrack peo
ple, but of the ladies and gentlemen in
terested in swelling the gate receipts for
two days out of six months of racing. It
is indeed a question if the bookmakers
do not, on these days, take in as much
additional coin as is handed back to the
benefit committees.
Dr. Dille's logic was sound, but he was
probably too specific in his choice of
words. I candidly believe that the noble !
ladies of Fabiola and the active mer
chants of this city do not fully realize !
the full significance of closing stores so i
that their young men and women can |
attend the race track even for one day,
for poor Widber must have made his
debut at a track some one day in his
life. Nor can I think that there will ever
be another Fabiola day at the track. j
That worthy charity can depend on sup- j
port from less questionable sources.
It must be admitted that if anything I
can condone a public benefit at the race ,
track that thing is the necessity for the ;
tunnel road between the two counties. !
Many years ago, at the first public meet- '
Ing I attended in Oakland, the tunnel
road was the subject under discussion.
Its benefits were set forth by merchants,
contractors and others in the old quarters
of the Board of Trade. Whatever argu
ments were made then, when an electric
road was a novelty in this city, are four
times more forcible now. The obstacle
all along has been the impossibility of
raising funds, and consequently when the j
race track was proposed as a medium
everybody fell in line and the special .
committees did splendid work. The sit
uation no doubt appeared to them as
Tennyson made It appear to the heroes
of Balaklava. If some one had blundered
at the beginning It was not theirs to
make reply, but simply to do and die ana
they did their duty well.
These matters will no doubt receive
much consideration before next W^

FEUDNER AGAIN WINNER.
JUDY OF STOCKTON GETS ONE OF

Seven Interesting Events, in Which
Fully Eighty Shotgun Sharps
Eagerly Took a
Hand.
There was a large gathering of shot- |
gun shooters at the tournament of the
California Inanimate Target Association,
which opened yesterday at the Ingleside
grounds. In the six or seven events fully
eighty crack shots participated, this be
ing as good as at any tournament since
these gatherings were inaugurated six
years ago. The representation from the
country was better than usual. To-day's
events will end the tournament.
Taken as a whole there was not very
much brilliant work done, only a few of
the men coining up to their average.
However, Otto Feudner kept up his repu
tation in this line, carrying off the trophy
of the third event, the K. T. Allen cup,
on twenty straight breaks, and the Gold
Dust Diamond medal on nineteen breaks.
It was conceded that his was th>
shooting of the day. 0. M. Judy was the
winner of the fourth event, carrying off
th<-. Olympic Gun Club medal. He broke
twenty bluerockfl straight. In each of
the matches liberal cash prizes were
added by the association and a number !
of the shots did well in the pools put up |

O'Brien Is Convicted.
OAKLAND. May 29.â James O'Brien has I
been found guilty of felonious assault
upon Miss de Lopez, daughter of the
wealthy horse owner of Pleasanton. The
jury was out all night, as two of the ju
rors were not prepared to join the other
ten, but this morning ajl were' agreeri,
and after returning a verJlct they were
discharged.
The ease has been the most bitterly con
tested of any criminal suit in Alameda
County since the trial of Howells for the
murdrr of A. A. Moore. Senator McGow
an and Thomas Garrity appeared for
O'Brien, and Deputy District** Attorney
Melvln, M. C. Chapman and Thomas Scutt
prosecuted.
Silhouette Shooting.
ALAMEDA, May 29.â Forty-eight mem
bers of Company G went out this morn-
Ing to Diamond Canyon to hold a practice
silhouette shoot. The shoot was a sue
cc3s and good scores were made. After
the shoot the company went to Leona Ho
tel and had its anniversary banquet. On
the way home from there, while going
down hill, the harness of one of the teams
attached to a bus loaded with soldiers
broke and the team ran away. Two of
the r.;embers were thrown to the ground,
but escaped with only a few bruises and
torn uniforms.
A Pentecostal Celebration.
OAKLAND. May 29.â The Holy Ghost
or Pentecostal celebration by the Portu
guese in West Oakland to-day was a
great success. The children paraded with
a band in the foronoon and attended mass
at 3t. Joseph's Church. In the afternoon
the exercises were held in the hall. Sim
ilar exercises were held in San Leandro.
Officer Downey, who has been missing
for the past week and was suspended, has
returned home. He claims to have been
in Stockton, and says he had a leave of
absence. This is denied by Chief of Police
Fletcher, who says the man loft without
a word. After being gone two nights, and
his wife denying any knowledge of him,
Fletcher suspended him and will file
charges against him before the Police
Commissioners Tuesday.
Stimulating to Patriotism.
OAKLAND, May 29.â The attendance at
the First Bab+ist Church to-night to lia
ten to the annual Memorial Day sermon
by the pastor, the Rev. C. H. Hobart,
packed the house to the doors. The G. A.
R,, S. V., Relief Corps and kindred organ
izations wore largely represented. The
speaker took for his text: '
â¢'Remember the days of old." (Deut.
32:7.) He said a country without patriots
was to be pitied, and held that a study of
past conquest^ for liberty would help to
make patriots now.
G. A. R. Memorial Services.
ALAMEDA. May 29.â Joe Hooker Post,
G. A. R., attended the First Methodla*
Church in this city in a body this even
ing. Special services were held In honor

Beyond this there will be no observance
of Memorial Day in this city.

ALAMEDA, May 29. â The body of
Frank E. Bushnell, who was drowned in

Isobars, or folia lines, connect points of <â¢.,â :;!
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. . The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair whether: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is "usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars Of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result. .

OAKLAND PLAYS
A GREAT GAME
A Big Surprise? for the
Frisco Nirtte.
WHEELER PITCHED WILDLY
TOSSED AS THOUGH AT WOODEN
DOLLS.
The Team That Was Expected to Do
Some Great Playing Was a Dis
appointment to the
Crowd.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Mr. Oal Ewlng may not possess a very
ke^n perception of the uncertainty of the.
great national gume, yet the faith and
confidence he displayed when talking of
his team's ability to make the San Fran
ciscos look like a "bunch of question
marks" was certainly not misplaced. It,
however, developed after nine innings of '
â¢' rag-time" playing that the Oaklands
could play ball a little bit, and that their i
hustling manager, Cal Ewing, knew what
he was talking about. The San Francis
cos, who have evidently been playing a
game faster than they themselves l
thought possible, awakened to the cruel
reality after a few rounds with Ewing's :
braves that there was such a thing as
losing a game. They may have had what
is known in baseball as an "off day."
Their playing to-day was about as good
as Fresno's was tfae day before, the only
difference beine in the score. As was !
the oase In Saturday's game everybody |
expected to see a hard-fought battle, and '
in view of that fact a good crowd was !
present- in fact It was the banner crowd
Of the season.
The assemblage at yesterday's game,
while disappointed in the work of their
home team, was nevertheless given niuny
an opportunity to break loose, as theve
w<re many brilliant plays. H. Krug ac
(l'iiittd Himself admirably In left lield,
making some very pretty throws and '
fine running catches. The Friscos tried :
hard enough to wax, but such playing as
Stroecker put up in right field would de- j
moralize any team. Then AVheeler, who
pitches in "spots." was overcome with I
that tired feeling, as was Thomas in !
Saturday's game, and just to show that j
if necessary he could send a few men to j
bases in the fifth inning began pitching !
as though he was throwing at "wooden :
dolls." Lange, the first man up, was out, j
and then began the "wooden doll act."
Hardie was hit, and so was Sykes. Fail- |
ing to put Sullivan out of the game, b
was given a free passage to first, am
the bases were rilled. Then Mr. Wheele
endeavored to pull himsllf togther, bu
the "pardon came too late." Schmeer
the next batter, sent a hit into center. Sc
did Moskiman, and then Dean hit one t
first, sending in a run on the play. 1
this inning three men crossed the plat
and Mr. Wheeler was directly respon
sible for every one of them. Whethe
his wildness, or rather carelessness
caused the Friscos to work up a "don"
care sort of spirit" 1 am unable to stau
but up to this inning the game was a
very good one, both teams playing ex
cellent ball, and everything pointing to
a warm finish. But It seems as though a
hoodoo follows in the wake of some of
these teams when they play here. If they
do not put up inferior ball at the start
something happens to mar the beauty of
the same at some stage.
Yesterday's game was the same old
s toryâ a good start and a hand-me-down
finish, the peculiar part of it all being
the team that was expected to do all or
the brilliant playing fell down. It was
really the greatest surprise of the sea
son and no doubt the Oaklands are of
the same opinion. No one seems capable
of giving a sensible reason as regards the
change of form. The Oaklands' playing
yesterday in every department was su
perb. M'oskiman pitched a good, steady
game and was given almost perfect sup
port. He allowed the Friscos but seven
scattering hits and besides nelded his po
sition. Lang, however, was the brigh
particular star, putting up a game a
third that would have made many a Is a
tional Leaguer "bow his head in shame.'
He did not have so very many chances
but the clever way in which he a.ccepte(
the few that happened his way brough
down the stands "twice over." The game
while not as good as it might have been
contained many brilliant plays, prin
cipally on the Oakland side, and was a
times'interesting. although the boys from
across the bay outplayed their opponent
at all positions and stages of the con
test. The score is as follows:

GENERAL MERRITT OUTGENERALED
A Chinese Servant Puzzles and Outwits the
Major-General Merrltt. grim old warrior of a score of fields, head of the
Manila army. Military Governor of the Philippines, has met his first de
feat. He got it from a yellow, lantern-Jawed, slant-eyed Chinese armed
with a washrag and a bucket of suds.
When the general entered the suite which had been provided at the
Palace he found that important business awaited attention. He desired to
discuss affairs of state. A Chinese servant was in the room, washing win
dows. They did not particularly need washing, but the yellow fellow was
there under orders and he proposed to finish the Job. The general asked
him to take his suds and go.
"Me no sabe," replied the saffron son of toll, â¢plashing more water on.
The general argued, but it was useless. He scolded and harangued,
but to no effect.
Affairs of state might wait, bnt the Chinese was bent upon cleaning the
windows. He looked mildly at the general and dipped anew into the suds.
"Me no sabe" was all he said. The general, Jaeing a student of human na
ture as well as of the art of war, suspected* that the intruder was lying.
"John," said he with great solemnity, "don't you know I could have you
shot?"
"You no shootee me," replied John. "Go shootee Splaniard. Me Melt
can man's fiend. Me alle same stlars and stlipes," and a fresh dash of
suds struck the pane.
The general was getting impatient. There was no use in diplomacy.
"Git!" he yelled. "Vamoose! Clear out! You sabe 'clear out,' you
heathen?"
"Me no sabe 'clear out,' " answered John. "Me sabe Melican flag. Me
sabe washee window."
The Military Governor of the Philippines was in despair. Just then a
chambermaid passed the open door. '
"Say." said the general, "come in and induce this heathen to get out."
The chambermaid came in, broom in hand.
"See here," she remarked to John, "skip or I'll break this broom over
your cocoanut." . '
John picked up the bucket of suds and started for the hallway. As he
reached the door he winked at the general. "Me no sabe much; me sabe i
war," he said, and went his way. (

DRUNKEN DEFAMERS PUNISHED
Two Men Insult Soldiers and Are
Roughly Handled by a Citizen.
Fred Hanson and Joseph Donnelly, two
intoxicated hoodlums, were taught a les
son In patriotism yesterday that they will
not soon forget. Besides being roughly
handled for treasonable utterances they
were thrown into prison for drunkenness.
The two men were reeling along Mar
kt street quarreling with all whom they
met, and when opposite The Call office
stopped two of Uncle Sam's visiting vol
unteers. Curses and aspersions were
thrown at the latter with a view to en
gaging them in a brawl, hut the soldiers,
seeing their condition, tried to evade
them. Not so a passing citizen. Being
Imbued with the enthusiasm that per
vudes the general mind, the Insults that
were being heaped on the strangers and;
on the Stars and Stripes waa like placing
a red rag before an enraged bull. "With
out stopping for explanations he stepped
between the combatants and shot out a
good-sized American first, landing on
Hanson's nose, making him see stars and
striping his countenance with gore. Han
son fell to the pavement, and on rising
pulled a knife on his chastiser, making
a vicious lunge at him. A bystander
Jerked his arm at the moment, otherwise
he might have cut the patriot; as it waa
the knife grazed his hat. The now angry
unknown sailed in and treated the de
ramer to a well-merited drubbing. Upper
cuts, left swings and rights from the
shoulder landed all over Hanson's anat
omy and when merciful onlookers inter-
SV c< * he Presented a sorry spectacle,
mood oozed from his mouth and nose
and from a deep gash in the head. Han
son was taken into the Wonder Drug
btore by his cowardly and weeping pal,
Donnelly. Officers McNamara and Tyr
rell placed the men under arrest, to the
satisfaction of all who witnessed the !
trouble.
A SOLDIER INSULTED.
John Cronin Causes a Row and Gets
the Worst of It.
A party of soldiers were passing the
i merry cup yesterday afternoon In a sa
loon on the corner of Fifth avenue and
l>onqs street, when one of the bluecoats
was insulted by an inebriated civilian, and
a row Immediately resulted. The combat
ants were pushed Into the street, where
I the engagement was completed. The sol-
I dier proving the bettor fighter, laid nis
j opponent supine in the dust. The civilian,
I afterward booked in the O'Farrell street
: Police Station under the name of John
Cronin, recognizing his inferiority as a
, fighter with listie weapons, brandished a
; large and terrifying cheese knife, which
he had concealed under his coat, but be
; fore he had time to use it he was seized
j by Detectives Wrenn and Gibson, who
happened to be present, and the mal-
I feasor and the cheese cleaver were soon
j separated. Cronin was lodged in the
; O'Farrell street station, charged with car
rying a concealed weapon and disturbing
; the peace.

"REMEMBER THE DEAD!"
A NATURAL WATCHORD
OF MEMORIAL DAY
IT* H"E services in the churches throughout the city yesterday in honor, and to
the memory, of the nation's dead were observed with more than usual
solemnity, as crowded in the recollections of the past were the bold reali
â¢ -â â  ties of the present and the future. As the eulogies from a hundred pulpits
ascended in praise and honor of those who gave up their lives in the battles
of freedom in the past they were invariably terminated in a burst of emotion
and sadness for the fatalities that might come. and are probably awaiting our
boys in blue who are willingly risking thÂ«*r lives that the stars and stripes might
bring freedom over an afflicted and oppressed nation.
THE SLAIN OF THE MAINE.
â¢â¢Thy dead shall Iivo; my dead bodies shall arise.
"This thought of the prophet." said the Rev. \V. C. Pond.
In addressing a large congregation at the Pethany Congre
gational Church yesterday morning, "is the one that God has
given me for this Sabbathâ the one preceding Memorial day.
I propose to apply this text," he continued, "to some who
have more recently lost their lives in the service of their
country â the dead heroes of the Maine.
"We know that they do li\<- personally, each in his own
place, in the other world, but what I wish to show is how
they still live in the world, how being dead they speak;
how their apparently forfeited and waited lives will enter
into the life of our great commonwealth, and how long after
they are personally forgotten their blood will be the seed of
their country's welfare and glory.
"1 need not dwell on the details of that inhuman event.
They are fresh in the memory of us all. A magnificent
floating fortress entered the harbor of a nation with which
we were still tit peace and where she should have received
cordial welcome. She anchored under the direction of local
REV. WC POND
authorities in an unusual place and directly over a sub
marine mine. This mine was by some means exploded and the great ship
wreeJted. Entombed within its sinking remains were 2G6 of our brave, well
trained sailors. Many more were crippled and the whole nation startled by
a report which has now resounded throughout the nations of the world.
"Some men, on what are supposed to be Christian principles, object to the
slogan "Remember the Maine." It is said to have in It the ring of barbarism.
I do not view it so. At any rate the expression has become one of the nation's
battle cries. The nation's heart responds to it.
"I see in the present struggle the entrance of our country upon a new era
in its history, an era fraught with immeasurable blessings to the world, and
for this reason I aver that the siain of the Maine are immortal, not only in
their personal existence, but in that of country and the world.
"Let us breathe ;i prayer for their souls on this Memorial day, and let us
honor the brave heroes who went down to death in the service of their country
by erecting fitting monuments of devotion to their memory."
'MEMORIAL DAYS OF '61 AND '98."
The subject on which Rev. E. Nelander preached before
the Colorado, Minnesota and Washington regiments at tho
First English Lutheran Church yesterday morning was "1861
and IS9S." After the services the soldier boys were invited to
a delightful luncheon prepared by the ladies of the church.
Dr. Xelander spoke as follows:
"Never has a Memorial Day been so full of meaning.
Amid the clash of arms and the roars of cannon we are
called upon to celebrate it.
"War had become but a memory. As we annually placed
our flowers on the grassy mounds of those who died in the de
"t the Union, we thanked God that war was no more.
"But to-day all is changed. As we lay the wreath this
year for the dead, we again hear the call to arms and the
steady tramp of soldiery. Railroad trains are hurrying vol
unteers to the front; monster ironclads are gathered in battle
array. The scenes of 1861 are repeated. Again I hear the as
sembling of the host; again I see mothers dismissing their
sons with tender benedictions, and young wives buckling the
swordbelt around the forms they leaned upon. The streets
e--ho to the soldier's tread and the strains of martial music,
and with 'God bless you!' streaming over them like bannered inscriptions, our
brothers and our sons go forth.
"And so it is that Memorial Day 1898 comes to us with a new and startling
signiJicance. The lifetime of a generation has passed away since the youngr
men of ISGI gave their lives to preserve the Union, and now a new generation is
called upon to make the awful sacrifice."
RÂ£V Â£ NELANDFR
THE CELEBRATION TO-DAY.
Preparations are now complete for the celebration of the memorial day. The
old veterans of the civil war will, as has been the custom since the day was set
aside by the Government in memory of its departed heroes, form in procession at
10 o'clock this morning at Market and New Montgomery streets and inarch to
Golden Gate avenue and thence to Van Ness avenue, where they will be re
viewed and dismissed.
Immediately after the procession the members will proceed to the various
cemeteries where they will decorate the graves of their dead comrades. At the
Odd Fellows' Cemetery the Utah Light Artillery will fire a salute over the
graves of the dead heroes.
Memorial services will be held by the League of the Cross Cadets this morn-
Ing: and solemn high mass said for the ueceased members of the organization.
Delegations from the" George H. Thomas Post No. 2 and Liberty Post No.
133, Grand Army of the Republic, owing to the want of time to-day, decorated
the graves of the veterans in the cemetery with flowers yesterday.
MEMORIAL DAY AND BOYS IN BLUE.
"Memorial Day and the Boys in Blue" was the subject of
Rev. W. E. Dugan's address lust evening at the Stewart
Memorial U. P. Church.
"Paul's favorite figure of the Christian life," said the
preacher, "is that of a soldier. And well is it so, for the ideal
military life has more analogies to the Christian life than any
other character. The military life is the model life and mili
tary tactics and rules come nearer heaven than any other
code.
"The soldier has always been an Interesting character, as is
vividly illustrated by those in our presence to-day. Before
him actors, orators and all other characters pale. He is more
attractive to us than commerce and tariff laws, over which
the nation frequently divides Itself, and accordingly we have
pet apart a day to which we pay respect to our departed he
roes. Lovingly, with our hearts swelled with sympathy, let
us go to-morrow to lay a flower on their graves until the per
fume shall fill the whole earth and come back to grasp the
brave heroes in our midst who go forth to fight against that
iron-hoelod, serpentine-tongued, aspen-llpped monster of ini
quityâto grasp these heroes by the hand and say, 'God bless
REV WE .OfOAN
you:
"The soldier's Is a model life because It Is a life of definite decision; he has
decided to turn his back upon idle pleasure and the trifles of the world and to
cot his face towards duty. His life is a model life because In the military life
we have a vivid illustration that in union there is strength. No soldier goes for
ward according to his own plan or will. His life, while one of submission, is a
life of equality, there being- no castes, one soldier being equal to every other sol
dier of the same rank. Therefore, to this model hero let us pay our tributes of
respect, giving him our love, our courage and our sympathy. God bless the
soldier boy!"
THE HERITAGE OF HUMANITY.
G. H. Thomas Post and Liberty Post, G. A. R., attended Ply
mouth Congregational Church In a body last evening. A spe'c
il memorial praise service had been prepared, and the deeo
ations were of the most extensive kind. The national colors
ould be seen every place, and the pulpit was a mass of flowers,
ilk flags decorated each pew.
The pastor, Rev. F. B. Cherlngton, delivered a Memorial
<ay address, and spoke as follows: "The conflict that is now
pon us is an Inevitable clash between two essentially antag'o
istic civilizations. It is a logical and Inevitable forward step
n our national development toward that higher conception of
overnmc-nt which regards as a sacredly imperative duty the
â¢stabllshment and maintenance of righteousness, justire and
iberty as the common heritage of humanity. It is because the
â¢used aational conscience has come to feel the necessity of
uppressing national ruffianism under its very shadow.
"America has not been precipitate. Yellow journalism and
ingo statesmanship have been unfortunate accompaniments, but
ot the directing forces in this great movement. Beneath all
t ipse surface indications there has been a deep, strong, re
stless and sublime current of Influences that in majesty and
power have been like the swelling ocean tide.
"For twenty-five years we have protested with constantly increasing emr-ha
lis against the impolicy, the inhumanity, the cruelty of Spain in Cuba The sue
cesslve administrations of Presidents Grant, Harrison, Cleveland and McKlnlev
have spoken in the same tone, but in vain. Not until It became evident that
every resource of diplomacy had been exhausted did the nation draw its sword
and in the name of God and humanity command the cessation of the atrocities "
REV r D
CHÂ£RÂ«N<iTON
PEACE THROUGH WAR.
Mfcev. "Warren H. Landon. D. D., professor in the Presbyterian Theological
Seminary at fcan Anselmo, delivered an eloquent and stirring memorial Pennon
yesterday morning in Calvary Presbyterian Church. "Peace Through War" was
the subject upon which he spoke and he chose as his text Matthew x-34 "Think
not that I am come to send peace on earth: I come not to send peace but
sword." In part he said:
"To-morrow is Memorial Day, a day sacred to the memory of those who were
fighting for their country more than a third of a century ago. For the first tima
in a generation we observe this day in the presence of war.
"I believe it is the Christian duty to take up the sword which Christ mat
upon earth. Ml
"The question is sometimes asked, what right had this nation to interfer* â¢h*>,
affairs in Cuba? That island belonged to another nation. Perhaps when
think of what the war Is to cost us. we put the question to our own henrr*
What right had we to interfere? In my opinion, the same right the C d
Samaritan had to interfere on behalf ofthe poor wounded man in the narai 1
Our right grew out of our neighbors' need. Our duty grew out of the resnonii
bility that rests upon a nation of whom much therefore is required -pmsi
"Wtat was the state of affairs In Cuba when this nation through its P r Â»=t
dent insisted that Spain's course In Cuba should cease?" The speaker th
quoted a few extracts from Senator Proctor's report, which he believed thecal "
est statement made upon the subject. It recited the terrible scenes witnessed
the oppressed country and caused shudders of horror to pass through his listene Â°
"We have feared that we were not as strong and brave as our fathers th t
our young men were effeminate and lacking the heroic spirit of former times
but as we have heard their prompt response to the nation's call and seen them
marching through the streets with firm step and brave faces, we have shouted
'the spirit of '76. the spirit of the fathers, doth rest upon the children.' And we are
encouraged to believe that the Lord God of our Father is the Lord God of their
children and that He is with us In this conflict.
"We Know not where the war will end. "We know not yet what It will cost
the nation In blood and treasure, but if our alms are right and our trust in God
if we accept our victories with humility and our defeat* with patience, I believe
the rwult will be a larger peace for the world."

VERY NEARLY ASPHYXIATED.
Dr. A. E. Harding of the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital Had a Narrow Escape.
Dr. A. E. Harding had a very narrow escape from asphyxiation at the Har
bor Receiving Hospital yesterday morni lg. He was discovered in an unconscious
condition by George Lilly, driver of the ambulance, and it was nearly three
hours later before Dr. Deas was able to say that the patient was out of danger.
A woman is mixed up in the case, and if she is found a charge of "attempt to
murder" will be placed against her.
Saturday night at 9:40 o'clock a drunken woman was brought from the cor
ner of Dupont and Broadway to the Harbor Receiving Hospital, to have a lac
erated wound of the scalp dressed. Officer Meagher, who had the woman in
charge, did not know his prisoner's name, as he was new on the beat, having
been temporarily transferred from the North End to the California street
station, so she was entered on the hospital register as "Jane Doe."
After Dr. Harding hnd dressed her wounds and seen that she was com
fortable in the ward, he retired. The hospital is supplied with both gas and
electric lights, but the former is rarely used except for heating water in the
operating room. Before entering his bedroom Dr. Harding turned on the electric
current from the hallway, and before getting into bed he turned out the light
at the lamp. His clothing he hung up on the pegs in the telephone room, which
adjoins the bedroom.
All went well until about 3 a. m., when "Jane Doe" went to Driver Lilly and
asked if she might go home before it got light and people were about. Lilly
woke up Dr. Deas and asked if the woman might go, and was told yes. "if she
was sober." Lilly said she was, and answering, "Let her go then," Dr. Deas
turned over and went to sleep again. At ten minutes to 6 Lilly was back in Dr.
Deas' room, shaking him and saying: "For God's sake, doctor get up quick or
Qr. Harding will be dead."
Both men rushed into the adjoining room, and there lay Dr. Harding at the
point of death. The room was full of the fumes of gas, the unfortunate man
was black in the face and almost gone. Doors and windows were at once
thrown open and the patient moved out onto the operating table. After three
hours of unremitting attention the danger point was passed and about an
hour later the patient was sufficiently recovered to be sent to his home at 006
Octavia street.
While Lilly was getting Dr. Deas' permission for "Jane Doe" to leave the
hospital she stole the key of the side door." When everybody was asleep she re
turned and made the rounds of the place. She ransacked Dr. Harding's pock
ets and took ail his money save a few nickels and dimes in his vest pocket.
His clothes, which he had hung up in the telephone room, were lying all over
the floor.
The matter wa reported to Chief of Police Lees yesterday and several of his
men are now out looking for the woman.

BIG BOATS MAKE FAIR TIME
OVER THE COUxvSE.
After Winning the Prize Flags in
Their Classes Edna and Phoe
nicia Meet With Serious
Mishaps.
Yesterday the California Yacht Club
held Its fifth annual regatta for class
flags.
The course was estimated at ten nauti
cal miles, and consisted of a beat to wind
ward and two reaches. Punctually at
12:55 p. m. the preparatory gun was fired,
and at 1 o'clock the gun signaling me
yachts of the first class to start; a red
flag was also hoisted. At 1:10 p. m. the
signal gun for yachts of the second class
was fired and a white flag hoisted. At
1:20 p. m. the starting gun for yachts of
the third class was fired and a blue flag
hoisted.
A strong northwesterly breeze was
blowing, but, as the tide was flooding,
there was not much sea; consequently the
boats did not make such heavy weather
of the beat to windward as if the stiff
wind had met an ebbing tide. However,
the prospects of a rough trip caused sev
eral of the small boats entered In the first
cla^s to drop out. Of the five boats en
tered in class 1, Secretary G. F. Gaithers

U & I R- R- l'Hommedieu's Phoenicia
and G. turn Suden's Regina started, Allen
M Clay's Sea Fox and the Mist with
drawing. The sloop Regina crossed the
starting line first at 4 minutes and Â»3 sec
onds past 1 o'clock, being followed nearly
ten minutes later by R. R. l'Hommedieu a
Phoenicia. The rest of the boats crossed
the line In the following order: lawl
Hope sailed by A. Duncombe; Secretary
G. F.'Gaither's U & 1. sailed by the own
er; Halcyon, sailed by C. P. Moore; Thel
ma sailed by Stevenson; Sappho, sailed
by G. B. Edgar: Edna, sailed by E. Sager;
and Embla, flagship of the California
Yacht Club, carrying Commodore C. J.
Lancaster and Treasurer E N. Walter.
Embla was the last of the fleet to cross
the line.
After the yachts had all crossed the
starting line and made their way to Goat
Island nothing more whs seen of them
from the pier-head until Edna, Embla
and Theima were observed reaching along
the city water front towards the can buoy
to the southeast of Mission Rock. As
they drew nearer Edna was seen to be
well in the lead; she finished at 8 min
utes and 31 seconds past ?,. in an elapsed
time of 1 hour and 43 seconds, or a con
rer ted time of 1 hour 3rt minutes and 14
seconds. Theima finished second and Em
bla third. These werp followed by Regina
and Phoenicia of class I,'and by Halcyon.
Hope and U &I of class 2. Phoenicia won
the flag in the first class. Halcyon in the
second class and Edna in the forty-foot
class.
So far the day had been without mis
hap, though the weather was rough and
blustering: hut as Phoenicia, after cross
ing the finishing line, was cruising off the
narrow-gauge mole and was on the star
board tack, giving her the right of way.
the sloop Royal, which was on the port
tack and running free, suddenly luffed
up and fouled Phoenicia, snapping her
bowsprit right off and tearing her jib to
bits. Phoenicia, stripped of all unneces
sary hamper, had not even an anchor on
board, and so drifted helplessly in the.
strong tide. By good luck, however, she
was not carried onto the pier-head, but
down past It. Then the victorious sloop
Edna, winner of the prize flag in class 3.
sailed towards Phoenicia to throw her a
line. Edna, however, not getting near
enough at the first attempt, put about
and tried again; this time she sailed close
to Phoenicia's bow; the line was thrown
and caught, but the strong breeze caused
Edna to heel over considerably, and. as
she passed to windward of Phoenicia the
latter came up suddenly and spitted Ed
na's mainsail on her mainmast, ripping It
to pieces and breaking the gaff between
the first and second blocks. Edna then
