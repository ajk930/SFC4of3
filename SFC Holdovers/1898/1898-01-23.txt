IMPERIAL HOTEL
STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA
SINCE Has assumed the management of the IMPERIAL HOTEL
MR. ROTHENBUSH at Stockton, the change has been much appreciated by the
traveling public. It is without question the best conducted and most finely appointed
interior hotel in the State. The service is perfect, the most captious cannot complain
of the accommodations, and the menu is unsurpassed. Carriages are always on hand
for the convenience of the guest, and no charge made to any point in the city. The
rooms are all light and airy, and the furniture new and up to date. It is the favorite
stopping place for all the first class trade going to Stockton. Mr. Rothenbush has
introduced many an innovation which tends to please the guest, and no one visiting
Stockton should fail to register there.

Golden Eagle Hotel
AT SACRAMENTO, CAL.
IS AND Â®ne Â°^ l^ e l eac^ n
ALWAYS HAS BEEN hotek in California.
Its history is identical with that of the city
itself, and to-day it stands as a modern first
class hotel, of which any community might
be proud.
The GOLDEN EAGLE has entertained
most, if not all, of the famous men from
all parts of the Union. It is now the bus-
iness and political headquarters for all par-
ties. During the legislative sessions, the
GOLDEN EAGLE is the one place of
rendezvous in Sacramento where you may
be sure of meeting any prominent official
I of either branch in its spacious lobby or cafe.
The hotel in 1894 was placed in elegant
shape by its proprietors, Messrs. Gray &
Titus. An elevator of the latest pattern was
added and a large annex on the K. street
front. The suites and many of the larger
rooms contain baths, and all the rooms have
hot and co!d running water.
The location in the wry heart of the city
makes it popular with the commercial
travelers, and the proprietors strive both in
the service in the dining room and office to
give their patrons the home-like feeling that
makes one feel he wants to come again.
A well conducted hotel is of benefit to
the city in which it is located, and the ver-
dict of both our home people and our patrons
is that such is the standing of the

Ail through the spring: and summer Cali
ornia waited, and her mysterious sunny, sleepy
smile blossomed into myriads of golden poppies,
tinged with the color of that she held. And through
the winters, too, she waited, weeping softly in her
tie disappointment, til! tin- spring came
again.
And summer followed spring, and winter came
again and again, and still no one came. The world
was hungering, for gold. Men had suffered and
struggled and murdered for gold. And the dumb
gold-mother lay enchained, ready to give with freest,
fullest generosity out of the store of treasure that lay
in her lap. if only the messenger who knew the ma
gic word would come to break the spell that bound
her.
All through the ages when the naked red men
roamed through the majestic forests, and up and
down the beautiful valleys, California despaired. Her
rescuer was none of this race. These degraded sav
ages knew not the mighty power that lay locked up
by Nature's hand. They plucked the wild fruits,
they hunted the birds and the beasts. They found
blue and white stones, the pipe clay and the red
pcher, with which to stain their misshapen bodies
and their brutish faces. But the gold which Cali
fornia held they valued not.
. And so she waited.

The sleeper stirred and smiled in her sleep. But
the southern land was a sleepy land itself, and those
who dwelt there were content with little. The great
store was undisturbed, and California dozed again
through many a sunny and many a rainy day.
v A scientist, one versed in Nature's sly ways,
passed the spot, and to his dis Honing eye the hoard
of gold was visible. He to.d of his vision to the
world, and California dreamed she heard the tramp

Yet still her mighty energies lay slumber-bound.

In 1844 and 1545 there were not 10,000 people in all
scattered through the infant empire. Yet tha reve
nue amounted to $290,000. The public debt was nearly
as much again. The tariff on such necessaries as
coffee, sugar. Hour and cotton made them luxuries,
far out' of reach of the average Californian. There
was an almost complete cessation of emigration. Cali
fornia's merchants were deep in debt. Down at Mon
terey, the "\ ersailles of the western empire, a few
families lived in comparative comfort, in luxurious,
idleness, enjoying the dolce far nlente of th"
effortless, sensuously beautiful life; while to the
north, restless, eager prospectors and pioneers,

Spaniard's love of ease, roamed through the

Among the early pioneers was one who. quitting
New Jersey for Missouri, Missouii for Oregon, and
entering California by way of the north, was des
lii ed to bring about greater prosperity than any
iman tr economist the United states has pro

The leader of the expedition was a millwright
by trade, ; strong, straight, active man, about Js
years old. His features were rather coarse, rough

joined his short brown hair at the temples. His eyes

become historical? These people were not starting
out without a definite end in view. Marshall had
â already seen the place where be intended to erect
th.v saw-mill. He had it in his mind all the time
they were traveling <>n. He would describe it to his
companions, that narrow little valley, shut in by
Steep hills. He vould draw rude diagrams showing
ju.-n the spot on the south side, where the declivity
was the gentlest and the level stretch of land broad
ened, and the river curving around made an ideal
mill site for the dispatching of those noble pines that
covered the mountains all about. Months before* he
had crossed this same path across the valley and
then along the ridge over the mountains and down
to where the American River flows, washing the hem
of the great hi! is' skirts, and carrying with it un
known, andisc vered dust and liakes and nuggets of
goid.
*****
The little company made its way down along
the mountain's side into the valley below. Every
thing was t>> bÂ«- done, and almost immediately they
mt to work. A double logtiouse was built for Mrs,
Weimer and her family, a quarter of a mile up from
the river in a little gulch amid the pines. And later,
when more men came up from the fort to assist in
building the mil?, and the old story of boarding-house
feuds was repeated, other little loghouses were
1 nearer the river and the mill, and men
"batched" for themselves. But the whole little set
tlement counted only eighteen, including Mission In
dians, who would work under' supervision. Things
uont on very slowly. They had so few tools: they
had to supply so many deficiencies and do without
l-ii many necessaries. And after the rains began, the
river swelled and swelled till it flooded the Qttle val
ad very nearly undid all the work that had been
;â â  painfully, n wearyingly done.
Six months had passed and that mill was not yet
finished. The dam had been built, the frame for the
i"ill was BUmdteg and the flume and the bulkhead
were completed. Marshall grew impatient. There
was no possibility of getting m<.-re hands to work, so
the pioneer turned to Nature for assistance. Every
night after the men had finished work and sought
the snug comfort of their cabins, the gate was raised
and the clear, mountain river, freed from the arti
ficial bound:: that held it during the day. dashed
madly. Joyously through the ditch, washing out the
sand and singing at its work all the night while the
tired laborers slept
"I used to go down in the morning," says Mar
shall, "to m<â¢ what had been done by the water
through the night About 7:30 o'clock in the morn
ing I \\<-r.t down ;is usual, and after shutting (.-ff the
- from the r.-i pped into it. near the
lower end, and there, upon a rock, about six inches
beneath the surface <>f the water, I discovered the
gold."
Never in all the history of rising betimes has the
early bird found so precious a worm as this! If this
millwright could have gathered up the treasure he
had discovered, he might have been worth $1,303,571,
598 to-day.
Marshall stooped down and gathered a few more
pieces of the metal. Picking up gold was as easy
in that old millrace as it is in a dream of treasure
trove. Meditatively, tentatively he placed a piece
upon a rock and with another rock hammered It flat.
It was malleable, surely. Marshall scrambled up the
bank, bearing in his old hat a collection of bright
shining particles. "Boys," he said, "by , I be
lieve I've foiyid a gold mine!"
Work on the mill was stopped and the men gath
ered about cuiiosly, (inubtingly, eagerly. One can
imagine the various tests suggested. We know,
though, from Mrs. Weimer's own account, that her
boy, Martin, brought her a piece of the gold, saying:
"They want you to put it into saleratus water to
see if it will tarnish."
"This is gold," Mrs. Weimer said. Mrs. Weimer
came from Georgia and had seen gold dust before
"I'll throw it into my lye kettle, which I've just tried
out with a feather, and if it is gold, it will be gold
when it comes out." 9Â£nl
'Which was wisdom. Mrs. Weimer's narrative
bom sn:
"I finished off my soap that day and set it off to
cool, and it stayed there until next morning. At the
breakfast table, one of the wurkhands raised up his
head fr-rm eating and said: 'I heard something about
gold being discovered: what about it?* Mr. Mar
shall tuld him to ask Jenny, and I told him it was
in my soap kettle. Mr. Marshall said if it was there
it had not gene bark to California. A plank Vas
brought for me to lay my soap onto, an/1 I cut it in
chunks, but it was not to be found. At the bottom
of the pot was a double handful of potash* which I
lifted in my two hands, and there was in> gold as
bright as it could be."
But M;u shall was net quite satisfied. Sutt^r had
failed to send a supply of provisions to the mill. Mar
shall determined to go down to the fort, see what
reason there was for the delay, and report to Sutter
the finding of what he believed and hoped was gold.
"I was Bomewhat surprised to see him." Sutter
s-iys in him account, "as he was down a i'.'\\ days
previous. After I had sent up to Cokwna a number
of teams with provisions, mill irons, etc.. he told me
then that he had some important and Interesting
news which he wished to communicate secretly to
me, and wished me to go with him to a place wh>>re
we should not be disturbed, and where no listeners
could come and hear what we had to say. * * *
Th-n Mr. Marshall began to show me this metal.,
which consisted of small pieces and specimens, some
of them worth a "few dollars; he told me that he had
expressed his opinion to the laborers at the mill, that
this might be gold, but some of them were laughing
at him and called him a crazy man, and could wt
believe such a thing.
"After having proved the metal with aquafortis,
which I found in my apothecary shop, likewise with
other experiments, and read the long article "Gold' in
the Enclycopedia Americana, I declared this to be
gold of the finest quality, of at least twenty-three
carats."
Then hey, back to the mountains! Marshall
could no longer rest at the fort. Off he started for
that little valley, magical to him now as it hi a be
come to the rest of the world. He implored Sutter
to come with him and immediately. But the
matic Swiss could see no necessity for hurry. M"
advised Marshall to stay for supper aril sleep ai rue
fort. Then in the morning they both could ride
over to the valley of gold. But Marshall would not
listen.
"Will you come to-morrow morning?" h<' asked
Putter with the intentness of extreme preoccupation.
Sutter promised. Marshall went out ol fhe warm
adobe, down the steps, across the yard and out be
yond the walls. The gateway closed behind him, and
Marshall rode out into the rainy night.
The next morning at 7 o'clock Sutter followed.
"When he had left th^ valley and bo*eun to climb the.
mountains, he saw a man crawling out -of the brush
wood. It was Marshall, so mad now with
fever that he could not wail at Ce-loma for Sutter's
coming. He had ridden fifty-four miles u\> from
the fort to the mill, and then, mounting another
horse, had turned back to meet his partner.
"Just as the mill hands were finishing break
fast," relates Henry Bigler. one of that disband- 1
Mormon regiment of sc-ldiers, who became miner,
store-keeper, and followed half a dozen . different
trades as circumstances required, "we saw the old
gentleman come stubbing along with his cane In his
hand (a well-dressed old gentleman, too), Mr. Mar
shall on one side and Mr. Weimer on the ether, Sut
ter in the middle. As they neared our shanty \ j
went out and met them. After shaking hands and
passing the common salutations \vÂ«' were all invited
by Sutter and Marshall to go along- and have a gen
eral time prospecting in the race."
Fancy the old Swiss land baron issviinar a sort
Of general invitatii.-n to his men to join in the merry
game of picking up fortunes!
But the man who could play the rolo of the Treas
ure King in a fairy-tale role was not elated.
"On my way home." he says, "I was very un
happy, and could not see that it would benefit me
much. Before my departure I had a conversation
with all hands; I tc-ld them that I would consider It
as a great favor if they would keep this dis
secret only for six weeks, so that 1 c

sand dollars. The people up there promised to keep
it secret so long, but 1 thought at the time that it
could hardly be kept secret for six weeks."
Hardly: Can you imagine yourself felling trees,
planing lumber, digging out the mill race, carrying
stones, hammering and sawing and laboring in all
the varied ways that are necessary to turn a wilder
ness into a town, while at your feet lies the smiling,
glittering, inviting gold, alluring you with its rich
promisi ng, beseeching you only to stoop and
pick up fortune, pleasure, power, all the things man
j â¢ rr.s for?
And yet for a time the building of the mill went
on. Until one day a carpenter named Bennett, em
ployed by Marshall, left Coloma for Monterey. He
carried with him a quantity of the dust, and passing
through Terba Buena met Isaac Humphrey, a miner,
who had washed gold in Georgia. Humphrey came
up to Coloma with Bennett, where they arrived early
in March. He found a few of the men half-heartedly
hunting for gold; but work was going an at the mill.
as if there were no better use to make of those hours
set apart from all the myriads of hours since the be
ginning of time as the most fruitful.
But Humphrey changed all this. He washed a
pan of dust: and the men, clustering round, saw the
pi bbles washed away, and then the coarser rock, and
then the lighter earth. And with every cradling
movement of the experienced miner's hands, with
every new washing, the bottom of the pan grew
brighter and brighter. The black dust appeared
and the gold smiling up from under the thin coatlnr
of water lay in Hakes and grains, pure, fine, rich
Then Humphrey built a rocker. And sudumly
every man there found that a rocker was Uk j one
thins he needed. All the little Coloma world set to
building rockers. The Indians, the carpenters, the
blacksmith, even the children and Mrs. Weimer her
self had to have a rocker.
It was the first case of clearly defined, well-de
veloped gold fever. Unfortunately, there was no '
physician at Coloma to watch the progress of the
malady. But even if there had been, he himself
would have caught the delightful contagion, and the
first symptom, as all the world knows, is the loss of
memory, of wit, of wisdom, of everything but the de
sire for gold-getting. , ?â¢ /.
* * * * *
Even before that careless sixty- word announce-]
ment of the finding of gold, in the Monterey Call- '
fornian, the rush to the valley of the American River
began.
"I have seen boats with blankets for sails," writes
the man who owned the first store in Coloma, "pass
Benicia loaded with men who were working with
might and main, bailing out their frail crafts with
hats, shoes, and other such things, and even then, in
some cases, they did not succeed in preventing them
from swamping."
Men didn't care how they got to Coloma, pro
vided only they got there. They depopulated New
Helvetia, they left set traps and uncared-for cattle.
They walked over the mountains, they crawled, they

"I have slept out in the winter rain without a
tent, and merely something over my head to keep
the rain from battering my face, and little trenches

forty-niner.
This man had come west on a sailing vessel that
left Baltimore in March, and arrived at Yerba Buena
in November. Just about this time the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company was ready for business, and
then all the world poured into California. They came
from Oregon and Washington, from Mexico, from
Hawaii. The population sprang up to 100,000 and
increased by 50,000 annually for the next five or six
years.
In June. 1848, there were only five people left In
Terba Buena, women and children. I wonder why
they, too, didn't pro on that wondrous pilgrimage.
Everybody else did. Towns and farms were deserted.
Rancheros. vaqueroa, wood-choppers, soldiers and
sailors who had deserted or obtained leave of ab
sence devoted all their energies to washing the sands
of Colo-ma.

Sierra Nevada, resounds with the sordid cry of Gold!
Gold: Gold! while the field is left half planted, the
house half built, and everything neglected but the
manufacture of picks and shovels and the means of
transportation to the spot."
This was the cry of the Californian on May 29.
And after Inveighing against the sordidness of the
gold desire, its editor promptly and very humanly
succumbed to the fever himself. The Californian
suspended. In fact, everything was suspended but^
gold hunting.

minutes to pass through.
Ther#Â» are probably a hundred people left in Co
loma to-day.
Such a Â«jui' t. respectable little hamlet has Co
loma become in Its demure old age. You wouldn't
dream of accusing this tiny town, lying bedded in
of anything thai wasn't strictly conventional,
and edifying, and somnolent. There isn't a soul on
the streel save the Bchool children, a dozen or. so,
who stare at one with the open-eyed, speculative
gaze with which the salmon trout, caught floundering
high and dry in the drained mill-race, might have
regarded those oddly dressed, bearded men, whose
b""ts sank int" the soft, black ooze of the American
River.
Long before you reach Coloma you're struck with
the fact that every depression of earth, every union
of hill with hili is bordered <>n either side with bare
stones. This is the mark the gold-seeker nas left
oehind him. But if you would realize the frenzied
search, and th^ thoroughness with which it was ac
complished, turn to the river â Coloma's back door
now. for the town is mainly on the nortn side.
That r >() or, tortured American River! It has been
turned and twisted from its bed till it no longer
knows its original resting place, and it goes mur
muring discontentedly on, its sullied waters nfer
â¢permitted to regain their original transparent moun
tain purity. On either side there are piled rocks
upon rocks, pebbles without number, great bowlders
stripped bare of all covering. It seems impossible
that mere men could have wrought such desolation.
There isn't a foot of unsifted earth on all the river's
border. The framework of the town lies all exposed,
as though a company of giants, with rapacious hands,
had combed the town and picked its bare bones clean.
Of course, Marshall did not really discover gold
in California.
If you have the time and are interested in tha
( subject, you can readily convince yourself and others
that there are a dozen claimants, beginning with
those of the sixteenth century, who are more or less
entitled to what fame there is in being the first to
know of the existence of gold in California.
But t-o my mmd â and I have read patiently and
painfully all that has been printed on the subjectâ
th<' later discovery, the real discovery that was fol
lowed by such fruitful results was made by Mar
shall. The claim of Weimer is offset by the fact that
Weimer's wife names Marshall as the man who
picked up the gold. The claim of Bennett, made late
in the day, is rendered rather doubtful by the fact
that in first telling of the discovery re said. "Gold
has been found," and not "I found the gold," as
would have been only natural. To counterbalance the
stories of various ntht-r old pioneers are ihe stories
of equally old pioneers, who give to Marshall's tale
their faith and allegiance.
As to the discoveries of gold before Marshall's
tini". they are of no practical Importance, for they
were Dot followed up. They were premature dis
coverieSi barren of any real effect upon California's
welfare and the world's prosperity.

The interesting part of Marshall's connection with
the history of gold in California is in the effect that
discovery made upon the man himself. â  Â»i^ ;
After that historical day which uncovered rathe:
gold in the millrace Marshall took to mining like tha
rest. He also finished the mill and supplied most
of the lumber of which the town of Coloma was built.l
He had all the opportunities other men had in that
day of golden opportunities. He, in connection with
Sutter, collected a sort of royalty onmining claims.
But what he found he lost.'and what he earned was
quickly spent. The gold that was his slipped from
him as does treasure trove in one's dreams. And he
died in poverty after making way with about $10,000
in addition granted him by the State Legislature in
Â . the course of six years. X- ;^:
f / Marshall is not to be judged harshly for his in
temperance, his thriftlessness. They were qualities
: of the time as well as of the man. Neither is he to be
made a martyr, of. and California accused of ingrati

can imagine that the last seven years of the old
man's life, when the pension was discontinued, must
have been hard and bitter years.
"The first piece of gold which I found" this is
Marshall's own story â "weighed about 50 cents. Mrs.
Weimer, being my treasurer, used $440 of my money,
(to purchase stores ordered by me), among which,
was the first piece of gold which I had found. Where
that went, or where it is now, I believe nobody,

GENERAL JOHN BIDWELL'S TRIP ACROSS THE PLAINS IN 1841
THE first emigrant train from the
United States enterod California
In the fall of 1841. The first set
tlement reached was Dr. Marsh's
ranch, and the date November 4.
Bo far as is now known there are
but two men survivors of that memor-
able Journeyâ General John Bidwell of
Chico, CaL, and Michael C. Nye of
Crook County. Oregon.
In his twentieth year Bidwell became
possessed of an idea to see the great
Western Reserve and that longing even
tually led him to what afterward be
came California. He had J75, which he
had saved to enter college, and this he
spent In getting as far west as the
Platte reserve. There he became ac
quainted with men who like himself
were resolved on going West. There
were public meetings, and gradually
600 of them banded themselves together
for the trip. They styled themeslves
the 'Western Emigration Society. But
reverses came and the movement went
to pieces, leaving young Bidwell the
only one bent on the undertaking. He
redoubled his exertions among distant
neighbors, and finally a party of sixty
nine persons were plodding slowly
westward. There were five families.
Young Bidwell had a wagon and a
yoke of oxen. A man named Bartleson.
from Jackson County. Mo., was elected
captain. Each man furnished his own
supplies. Nobody was to have less than
a barrel of ffeur, with proportionate
amounts of sugar, etc. Teams of horses,
mules and oxen were used.
The great trouble of the party at first
was that nobody knew which way to
go. In a general way they know that
California was somewhere out west,
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF THE ILL-FATED DONNER PARTY.
THE attractions of California
made themselves felt in the East
even before the da- s of the
Golden Era, Though no hint had
as yet reached the world of the
vast stores of mineral wealth concealed
in her gullies and ranges, the agricul
tural and pastoral resources of the
State were sufficient to attract many
immigrants, and party after party,
traveling slowly in wagons laden with
all their household goods, made the
tedious and dangerous Journey across
the desert and over the Sierras.
Many, attacked by Indians, or perish
ing slowly of hunger and thirst, left
their bones whitening by the side of the
track to mark the path for the next
comer. Many, more fc. -v. ate, got
through safely and prospered exceed
ingly in the land of promise. The story
of these overland disasters has never
been fully told, party after party of
immigrants perished unnoticed In the
desert, and no historian has written of
their sufferings. But contemporaneous
accoÂ«mts throw a lurid light on the
tragedy of Dormer Lake.
In 184? San Francisco, or Yerba
Buena, as it was then called, was but
a little village by the side of the bay,
yet its few hundred inhabitants had
energy and resource, the nobler feel
ings of humanity were strong within
them. When the news reached the town
that a party of immigrants had been
enowed up in the Sierras whilst at
tempting to cross the Truckee Pass, the
generous citizens made immediate re
sponse and a relief fund of $1500 was
subscribed. Search parties were organ
ized and with infinite trouble and dan
ger the remnant of the miserable Dor
mer party were brought forth from the
mowy range by the side of the lake
which still bears their name.
Though well equipped and furnished
with all needful supplies, everything
seems to have gone wrong with the
Dormer party from the outset. The
trouble began when the immigrants,
after leaving Fort Bridger, attempted
to follow a new route over the moun
tains. The track, though largely used
during later years, was then entirely
unopened, and often the party had to
halt for days to cut away the brush or
to explore the country in front of
them.
Thus they dragged their weary way
along until September, nhen it was al
ready getting late in the year, to at
tempt the passage over the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains. After passing Twen
ty Wells they attempted a two days'
journey from water to water. The pas
sage took them three days, they had
to abandon a number of wagons and
lost half their cattle. This disaster
beyond that they had nothing to guide
them.
Providentially they heard of a com
pany of Roman Catholic missionaries
who were on their way from St. Louis
to establish a mission among the F.'at
head Indians of the Rocky Mountains.
This company had engaged an old
mountaineer for a guide, whose name
was Fitzpatrlck and would be up with
Captain Bartleson's party if they would
wait another day. They chafed at the
delay, but it proved a most fortunate
wait for them. The missionary band,
headed by Fathers De Smet, Pont and
Mengarinl, accompanied them as far as
Soda Springs, now in Idaho. It was
rare pood fortune to be accompanied
by such a man as Father De Smet,
genial, even-tempered, experienced in
rough travel and withal one of the
saintliest of men.
Until the party reached the Platte
River nothing unusual happened.
Headed by Captain Fitzpatrick and the
missionaries tbey each day made what

Fate of the Logan Party.
progress they could. It was customary
at night to draw the wagons together
into a hollow square, picket the ani
mals inside and detail a guard to
watch. At times the train was half a
mile or more in length, but when dan
ger threatened a compact body was
kept for safety. For most part these
first pioneers had their own roads to
make, but when obstacles were to be
removed or gulches filled all hands
worked with a will.
From Fitzpatrick much was learned
about the Indians. As a precaution
cooking was usually done by day, so
as to have no fires by night. Of course
the emigrants were treated to an oc
casional scare from the Indians; as
when Dawson, who chanced to be
separated from his companions while
hunting, was so frightened by forty
friendly Cheyennes as to report that he
completed the demoralization of thÂ«
party. Many families were entirely
ruined, but the others brutally refused
aid, and savage fiÃhting: resulted.
One would think that the common
dangers to which all were exposed
should have developed their spirit of
humanity. Under proper discipline this
would undoubtedly have happened.
But as It was, the fear of death only
intensified each traveler's selfishness,
men fought like brutes over trifles, and
one old man whose feet were swollen
was actually abandoned in the wilder
ness.
It was late in October before the
straggling remnant which had escaped
death from privation or at the hands
of the hostile Indians reached the base
of the Sierras. They found it lmpossl
ble to cross the Truckee Pass, a heavy
fall of snow barred the way, and they
were forced to winter as best they
could near the Dormer Lake.
Here, lacking all proper clothing and
shelter, they strove to shield them
selves from the icy blasts of winter,
and when their provisions were ex
hausted had recourse to the most ter
rible of all nourishment in order to
preserve their miserable lives. Six
teen of the party, under the leadership
of Eddy, made a gallant attempt to win
their way out on snowshoes, leaving a
crimson track over the spotless Sierra
snows as they toiled wearily on day
after da
Several relief expeditions at once
started out: the first, under the leader
ship of Glover, reaching the camp on
February 19. Fourteen of the wretched
party had already perished of starva
tion, and the appearance of the sur
vivors, as they crawled from the hovels
where they strove to shelter them
selves, their hair matted and filthy,
their faces haggard, their flesh wasted
to the bone, was ghastly in the ex

had been surrounded by thousands of
Indians, who had taken from him his
mule, his gun and the major part of his
clothing.
The buffalo was a new source of In
terest. Almost from the start many
antelope, elk and much smaller game
had been seen, but buffaloes were
scarce till after the P'.atte had been
reached. It Is impossible lor young per
sons to conceive of the vast herds of
these huge animals that swept over
prairie and hillside, thundering at
times all night long, making the very
earth tremble with their wild indescrib
able rush. At times some of the party
were compelled, on the approach of one
of these vast herds, to advance some
distance from camp to turn or divide
them by firing guns and making fires,
lest they should in their mad sweep
trample under foot the entire camp. By
the time the party had reached the
Sweetwater buffaloes had compara
tively disappeared. Great numbers of
mountain sheep were seen at Scott's
Bluffs, below Fort Laramle. on the
North Platte, but because of their ex
ceeding wildness none were killed.
When the missionary party was
about to leave lovely Soda Springs one
half of the emigrant party â now num
bering sixty-four in al! â were so dis
couraged that they decided to continue
with the missionaries to Fort Hall
rather than to venture Into the un
known regions toward California,
and, not without misgivings, penetrated
the trackless western *wilds, following
down the west side of Bear River
toward Salt I.nk'-.
Using whnt scanty Information they
had been able to gain from Fitzpatrlck
and other sources, it was September be

ity of the lake. Progress was Impeded

frequent delays. The smoky atmos

treme. Glover, himself short of provis
ions, was only able to bring out a por
tion of the party, and when the second
expedition, under Reed, reached the
camp a week later the condition of the
survivors had passed from bad to
worse.
At first a few of the sufferers had
phere at times made It Impossible to
discern obstacles far ahead; the de
ceptive mirage occasioned many a sore
disappointment by Its phantom hopes
of water and foliage. Without know
ing it they were making directly for
the lake. The salty plain becamo softer
and softer, the water of the river no
longer quenched thirst, and at last the
poor, almost famished animals were un
able to proceed with their loads. This
compelled the party to lie by a day i'ur
rest; but it was not long till grass and
water were found to the north. The
condition of the animals made it im
perative to rest there nearly a week. It
is impossible In a short sketch like this
to relate fully even the most thrilling
incidents and momentous hardships,
much less the Innumerable experiences
of mountain and plain, with Indians
and wild beasts. More than once those
hardy emigrants traveled all day and
all night without water.
After sustaining many delays and en
countering obstacles that tried the
stoutest hearts, they came within sight
of great mountains to the westward.
Then it was quickly decided that the
wagons must be abandoned or the par
ty would be overtaken by the snows be
fore reaching California. None of the
party ever forgot the indescribable dif
ficulties of this undertaking. They were
all inexperienced in the methods of
packing horses, mules and oxen. It
soon became a caravan of loose packs,
frightened horses, kicking mules and
bellowing oxen.
Having oxen instead of horses, young
Bidwell had a harder time than the
others. Not infrequently the oxen
with their packs were left from six to
ten miles behind the party, and would
only reach camp about midnight. On
one occasion the animals failed to come
up, so next morning the owner return
ed In search of them; and, though tray
shrunk from cannibalism, but now Jt
had become universal; the bodies of
those who died were deliberately used
for food, and one human monster was
more than suspected of having mur
dered women and children in order to
gratify his appetite. The relief party
was horror struck at the scene which
met their gaze.
< n:t of the eighty persons who started
with the party nearly one-half, or 86,
perished, and that any survived was
due solely to the heroic exertion of the
Californlans, who spared neither life
nor expense In attempting the rescue.
cling all that day and night and nearly
losing not only the oxen, but his horse
and gun, Bidwell saw nothing of the
party till late on the day following. He
was indignant to learn that they had
not waited for him according to prom
ise.
The party had been warned against
going too far south and thus getting
into a desert country: they could not
then go west; there seemed no alterna
tive â they must turn to the north ana
cross a range of mountains. Would
they ever reach California traveling
northward? The dangerous canyons
leading toward the Columbia were
feared. At length the river was reach
ed which, four years later, Fremont
first saw and named the Humboldt.
Following the Humboldt many daya
they came to the Sink.
Fully one-half the party were now on
foot, the provisions were nearly ex
hausted, and there was almost no
frame. Some food was purchased from
Indians; but when the Americans saw
of what this was made, all relish for it
was gone. The faithful oxen now con
stituted the entire food supply.
Being compelled to drive the packed
oxen, the party made but eighteen or
twenty miles per day. Some were In
favor of leaving the oxen and hasten
ing on to California, where, they were
assured, there was plenty of beef. One
day, after circumstances peculiarly
trying to Bidwell, Captain Bartleson
and seven men, after taking most of
the store of meat, abruptly separated
from the remainder of the party and
Etarted off, the captain calling out to
those left behind to keep up If they
could.
Following their trail for two or three
days, all indications of their course
were lost in the sand, and Bidwell's
party were thrown wholly upon their
own resources. Maintaining a gen
eral westerly course, they crossed the
Caraon River and followed up the Wal
ker River â these were not then named
â to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, not
then knowing their name.
The party was preparing to make the
difficult ascent and had just killed the

a sorry sight as he ate the best sup
per that could be provided. He ex
claimed: "Boys, if I ever get back
to Missouri I will never leave that
country. I would at this moment
gladly eat out of the trough with my
dogs'."
Climbing the mountains with diffi
culty on the north aide of Walker
River, the reunited party at length
came to the summit, then found the
extreme head waters of what proved
to be the Stanislaus. This was fol
lowed for several days. Then the last
ox was killed; then the party killed
whatever they could â even crows and
wildcatsâ to keep from starving.
They came down into the San Joa
quln Valley; but seeing another range
of mountains far to the west, some
thought it yet 800 miles to California.
How tired, how utterly exhausted they
were on the evening of that day they
entered the valley. And the poor
Jaded horses had nearly perished.
Next morning Bidwell breakfasted
upon the lights and windpipe of a coy

an Indian, found on horseback, those
pioneera of pioneers were shortly
brought to Dr. Marsh's ranch, and
there they first learned where they
were.
It was almost exactly six months
since they had set out from Sapling

Stevenson's regiment, while ridins
along the Mokelumne River, stopped to
drink from a stream, and discovered a
gold nugget weighing between twenty
and twenty-five pounds. He hastened
to San Francisco and placed his prize
in the hands of Colonel Mason for
safety. The latter sent it by General
Beale to the Eastern States. The ex
hibition of this nugget in New York
Increased the gold fever, and the nation
began to realize the Importance of
newly acquired California.
A mass of gold was exhibited at the
World's Fair, London, which is said to
have been three hundredweight. It is
stated that this specimen was brought
up from a deep mine on the back of a
man. If the English hundredweight
is meant, it would be 336 pounds avoir
dupois, or 4.599.59 ounces troy. It was
brought from Chile.
With the exception of the Chile nug
get, the largest mass of gold on record
was found at Ballarat. Victoria Aus
tralia, in 1559. The mass is known as
the "Sarah Sands." Its weight was
2653 ounces. Of all the great Australian
nuggets, those from Victoria were the
largest and most plentiful.

The Blanch Barkly nugget, which j
was exhibited at London, weighed 14? }

In July, 1851, a very large nugget was
found in a pile of quart at Meroo
Creek, fifty miles from Bathurst, New
South "Wales. It was in three pieces,
but was considered to be of the same
origin, and is reckoned as one mass.
It was found by a native boy. who saw
the glitter of some exposed portion.
The total weight was 100 pounds' troy,

of iron were removed by hammering
the gold weighed 120 pounds. Being
melted at the Sydney mint it yielded a
little over 1182 ounces of gold, 874 fine,
and valued at Â£4389.
The Ural nugget, found in 1842 in the
valley of Taschku Targunka, near
Miask, Russia, is' now preserved in the

IN the days of '49 It took an emi
grant train from five to seven
mcmths to cross the plains. Nine
years later the overland stages by
the southern ro-ute made the Jour
ney In twenty-one days.
In 1561 overland stages by way of Salt
Lake covered the distance In nineteen
to twenty days, and in June of '69
travel by this method gave place to
Bteam. The good old days of overland
staging are now only a memory, but
that memory is exceedingly vivid with
those who crossed the plains behind
horses or mules, not knowing what
their adventures might be en route.
Hundreds of mules and horses, men
and coaches were required to carry on
this vast overland traffic, which stead
ily increased each year. One man con
trolled the western half of the business
and he is known throughout the coun
try as the pioneer holder of reins â Ben
Holladay.
By stage coach from St. Joseph, Mo.,
to Sacramento, Cal., was nearly 1900
miles. The trip could be made In fif
teen days, but the specific time in mall
contracts was nineteen days, in order
to make allowance for winter storms,
snow blockades ar.d other causes of
delay. The strictest discipline and an
excellent system prevailed with the
management of the company.
Over each 250 miles of road was
placed an agent or superintendent, who
had absolute authority, the distance
under his jurisdiction being called a
division. His duty was to buy horses,
mules and harness and feed man and
beast. Supplies he distributed among
his stage stations according to his esti
mate of what was required. He dug
wells at will and erected station build
ings at fancy. Hostlers, drivers, black-
Emlthe and station-keepers were hired
end discharged by him. In short, he
was a genuine despot, before whom the
stage driver, important though he
might elsewhere be, quailed In humble
deference. There were about eight of
these grand moguls on the old overland
route.
Next in rank to this great and gl'Ti
ous king of the plains was the conduc-

STAGE ROUTE."
tor, his beat being also two hundred
and fifty miles. He rode night .-md day
seated by the driver, snatching what
rest and sleep he might on that lofty,
flying perch. He had entire charge of
the mails, passengers, stage coach and
express matter until he delivered them
over to the next conductor, taking his
receipt therefor. While the conductor
was not invariably a gentleman, he
was a man of Intelligence, executive
ability and firmness, paying the closest
attention to his duties. As for cour
age, he was a veritable bulldog for
tenacity and determination, and lack
ing these qualifications he could not
have kept order nor protected human
life. There being a dally stage each
way, and a conductor on every stage,
sixteen or eighteen such officials were
constantly employed.
Then In importance came the driver,
his beat being long and sleeping time
at stations short, his days and nights
full of hard and wearing work. These
drivers traveled back and forth each
day over the same section of road, in
order to become thoroughly familiar
with each foot of the way. As the
watch changed the new driver was
equivalent to a new chapter in a book,
each having his peculiarities, his own

fund of stories and good or ill humor,
ata his disposition might be.
Unlucky indeed was the driver whose
fellow worker at either end of the road
got sick, for the coach had to go on,
and instead of climbing down for a
good reÂ»t aft>>r a rough Journey he
would have to go ahead, perhaps in
wind, rain and darkness, doing the
sick man's w* rk. It was not an un
common sight to see a driver sound
asleep on the box, the mules traveling
along at breakneck speed. The con
ductor, however, never reprimanded
him, for none knew better than he that
it was beyond the endurance of any
man to keep awake and double on his
track of seventy-five miles â one hun
dred and fifty milesâ with six fractious
mules to hold in check.
Here is how Mark Twain describes
his trip across the desert in a stage in
the early sixties: The mules, under
violent swearing, coaxing and whip
cracking, would make at stated Inter
vals a spurt, and dragged the cdach a
hundred or maybe 200 yards, stirring
up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled
back, enveloping the vehicle with dust
to the wheel tops or higher, and mak
ing it seem alioat in the fog. Then a
rest followed, with th<> usual sneezing
and bit champing. Then another spurt
of a hundred yards an<l another rest at
the end of It. All <luy long we kept
this up without water for the mules
and without changing the team; at
least we kept it up for ten hours,
which I take it as a day, and a pretty
honest one, in ar. alkali deaert. It was
from 4 in the morning until 2 In the
a ft -moon. And it was so hot and bo
close and our water canteens went dry
in the middle of the day, and wa got
bo thirsty. It was so stupid and tire
some and dull. And the tedious hours
did lag and drag and limp along with
such a cruel deliberation. It was so
trying to give one's watch a good long
undisturbed spell and then take it out
and find that It had been fooling away
the time and not trying to get ahead of
me.
The alkali dust cut through our lips,
persecuted our eyes, it ate through the
delicate membranes and made our
noses bleed and kept them bleeding â
and truly and seriously the romance all
faded far away and disappeared, and
left the desert trip nothing but a harsh
realityâ a thirsty, sweltering, longing,
hateful, reality. .' o .'.-?>â : .
Two miles and a quarter an hour for
ten hours â that was what we accom
plished. It was hard to bring the
comprehension away down to such a
snail's pace as that when we had been
used to making eight and ten miles an
hour. When we reached the station
on the farther verge of the desert, we
â¢were glad for. the first time that the
dictionary was along, because we never
could have found language to tell how
glad we were, in any sort of diction
ary but an unabridged one with pic
tures in it. But there could not have
been found in a. whole library of dic
tionaries language sufficient to tell
how tired those mules were after their
three-mile pull. To try to give
the reader an idea how thirsty they
were would be to gild refined gold or
paint the Illy.
A queer frontier town was Overland
City, 470 miles from St. Joseph, where
the stage was exchanged for . a "mud

passengers at one mouthful., The mails,
however, had to go. though the wheels
often sank to the hub in transit.. Break

several hours, during* one could

Passing Fort Laramie, the Indian
country and Black Hills were reached,
and here the imagination would read

every hill. Ambushed Indians often
pent bullets Into the coach, and the pas
sengers for the most part slept at night
with one eye open and arms ready for

IN a little while all interest was
taken up in stretching our necks
and watching: for the "r<>ny rider"
â the fleet messenger who sped
across the continent from St. Joe to
Sacramento, tarrying letters 1900
miles In eight days! Think of that for
perishable horse and human flesh and
blood to do!
The pony rider was usually a little
bit of a man, brimful of spirit and en
durance. No matter what time of the
day or night his watch came on and
no matter whether it was winter or
summer, raining, snowing, hailing, or
sleeting, or whether his "beat" was a
level straight road or a crazy trail over
mountain crags and precipices, or
whether It led through peaceful re
gions, or regions that swarmed with
hostile Imflans, he must be always
ready to leap into the saddle and be off
like the wind. There was no idling
time for a pony rider on duty. He rode
fifty miles without stopping, by day
light, moonlight, starlight or through
the blackness of darkness â as it
happened. He rode a splendid horse
that was born for a racer and fed and
lodged like a gentleman; kept him at
his utmost speed for ten miles and then,
as he came crashing up to the station
where stood two men holding fast a
fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of
rider and mailbag was made in the
twinkling of an eye, and away flew the
eager pair and were â¢ out of sight be
fore the spectator could get hardly the
ghost of a look.
The stage coach traveled about one
hundred to one hundred and twenty
five miles a day (twenty- four hours),
the pony rider about two hundred and
fifty. There were about eighty pony
riders in the saddle all the time night
and day, stretching in a long scatter
ing, procession from -Missouri to Cali
fornia, forty flying eastward and forty
toward the west, and among them,
making four hundred gallant horses
earn a stirring livelihood 7 and see a
deal of scenery every single day in the
year. We have had a consuming de
sire, from the beginning, to see a pony
rider, but, somehow or other, all that
passed us and all that met us managed
to streak by. in the night, and so we
heard only a whizz and a hall, and the
swift phantom of the desert was gone
before we could get our heads out of
the windows. But now we were expect
ing one along every moment, and would
see him in broad daylight. Presently
the driver exclaims:
"Here he comes!"
Every neck is stretched further and
every eye is strained wider. Away
across the endless dead level of the
prairie a black speck appears against
the sky and it-Is plain that it moves.
Well, I should' think so! i In a second
or two it becomes a horse ; and rider

hand, but no reply, and a man : and

Manager of the French Hydraulic Mining Company.
APTEft the discovery of K<>ld in
California, in 1848, the number

soon covered all ihe strean
California and Oregon, was
mostly dcvuti :i to individual mining.
The pick, Bhovel and sunn- light wash

forming the modest outfit of those

dividual laborer had a small chance of
success and which required the union
of a certain number of men.
tip to that period the prehistoric
methods of working gold - bearing
ground were the only ones known. Ttv
Caiifornia miner could be seen at that
time using the ground sluicing about
ki the same way as did
of the time of King Solomon, who
â washed out the high placet tnlm
the southern coast Oi Spain. They di
verted the water From ir.u moui
creek-?, accumulating it sometimes in
a reservoir, and mining with a bi.^
head of water the rich bed of some
gulch, into which they also wheeled or
shoveled whatever concentrate â¢
was encountered on the rims.
The inconvenience ol that lon^
costly method brought to light in the
ingenious and Inventive mind of the
California miners two Ideas which revo
lutionised tii" gold mining pro
The sluice appeared Brst a wooden
canal, paved with rocks, blocks or rif
fles, which, taking the place of the ir
regular bed of the ground cut, alloweci
them to save quicker and more com
pletely the gold of the gravel. But it
was yet necessary, to bring the gravel
to the sluice, by the tedious means of
the shovel or wheelbarrow. At this
juncture (1852) in the quick develop
ment of mining E. JVlaUhison of ruu
hydraulic miner, and" million- of dollars have been in
; in the work. In the hr-t place it is necessary

bridges, dams, pumping plant-, roads, and eve::
cities. There are instance- on record in California
.â .here water has been carried miles and miles in
flumes into a reservoir and then pumped into the
- that carried it to the monitors. This v .a- of
course due to the peculiar formation of the land at the
necticut had the great idea or sweep
ing the gravel into the sluice by means
of a jet of water under pressure.
August 7, Bowie, in his "Practical
Treatise on Hydraulic Mining," de
scribes the original process accurately:
"For this purpose water was conveyed
to the claim In rawhide hose and dis
charged through a wooden nozzle
against a â¢ bank. Torn by the water'
the earth was carried into the sluices
and shoveling was thus avoided. A
large saving In the cost of mining was
effected, a greater amount of material
being washed in a shorter time. This
was the first step in hydraulic mining.
â¢ It is this remarkable invention which
rapidly improved and brought to its
present state of perfection, put . the
California miner in position to work
economically the immense deposits
of auriferous gravel which have been
since fifty years one of the greatest
sources of prosperity in the Golden
State.
It is a wonderful tool for recovering
gold, put to-day In the hands of the
hydraulic miner by the genius, indus
try and practicalness of the present
generation of miners. We are in
debted to the geniuses for that power
ful "Giant," manageable as a well
trained horse,' obeying to the lightest
pressure of the hand, brings to the ex
act spot where U is wanted the tre

hydraulic fall scientifically managed to
feed it.
The improvement brought by this
single tool is easUj | by com
paring the old work, \, here one miner
shoveling only fifteen to twenty
cubic yards per twelve hours in liis

machinery one man working a giani
discharging lfiOO miners' inches of
water, can wish 2000 cubic yards or
more- in the same time. Such a gimt.
working under an effective pressure of
300 feet, distributes a force of jrvoo
horsepower. One understands
easily that when a miner turns
that 1000 horsepower broom against a
bank of gravel it rips, tears and easily
sweeps the gold bearins dirt smoothly
to the sluice, where the gold is left.

After having run through the "giant"

Fires are kept up. and cans of hot water arc constantly
near at hand, where the woolen mittens worn by the
V'per are taken about every five minutes and thawed
operations of hydraulic mining. But,
in order to understand the economy
and the high practical character of
that method, it is necessary to have
seen it put into practice in the various
conditions presented by the picturesque
mountains of California. From the
small mine, retired in the deep forest,
where two partners work with a 7-inch
pipe and a small stream of water, to ,
the big works ranging five or six big *
giants against gravel banks 200 to COO
feel high, . developing their pipes,
sluices, ground cuts on a half-mile
working front, with their imposing ma
terial of derricks, wire ropes, electric
plants and telephones, one finds always
the same peculiar character to the
works. You get the sensation of a tre
mendous amount of work being done
with little or no labor. The immense
pits look like deserts. And when, dur-
Ing the night, under the quiet illumina
tion of the arc lights, you see the tre
mendous streams of water thrown in
long parabolic curves, v imbroiling in a
thundering war gravel and bowlders,
and ramming the mountain that melts
before them into caves, you cannot help
feeling an overpowering emotion. It
seems that for a time some . Satanic -
force Is at work destroying the earth,
that the work is more than human.
But, after all. it is simply the focused
'â â rain efforts of those persevering, in
domitable pioneers who fifty years ago
opened the mountains of California to
civilization and industry.
The perfect adaptation of hydraulic
mining to the special conditions of
placers in California has produced
enormous financial results. They would
be yet more valuable had not hydraulic
mining been partially .stopped by the
anti-debris law.
Most of the gold production of gravel
deposits, figuring from official sta
tistics, is due to hydraulic mining. The
field open to hydraulic mining in Cali

State there are a great many valuable

law. Those fields were neglected in the
early mining days. Some of them are
still difficult of access. Those fields
are only waiting for the opening of the
country to be put in competition with
the famous old mines of the, Sierra Ne

mines temporarily stopped by the anti

Something about the matter. I have

thing better than silver and dirty
bank bilis. Moreover, l was a miner
for a number of years. I can mention
a number of things that should be
added to these lists, and which an- just
as useful as half the articles now on
them.
In the first place, take along your
full-dress suit. Gold hunting is adven
ture pure and simple, and almost
every adventurer I have seen wears a
full-dress suit. In fact, often he pos
sesses no other. Cigarettes should be
added to go with the dress suit; also
patent leathers and monocle. The lat
ter is also useful while actually look
ing for gold.
None of the lists mention whisky.
Take lots of it. It is weary work wait
ing for the gold to turn up, and you
want to pass away the time as happily
as possible. There is no danger attend
ing its use, for as soon as you find gold
you can take s the gold cure.
Take along at least twenty pounds of
axle grease to rub on the runners of
your sled. It will make the sled slip
over the snow easily. Moreover, you
can eat it if your, grub runs short.
Every list i have seen contains a
cooking-stove. Remember that you
cannot cook over a camp fire. For the
same reason you should take along a
large base-burner heating-stove -A'
camp fire wouldn't keep you \> inn.
Don't forget your silk hat.

AMONG THE WOMEN
MINERS OF RANDSBURG
I WENT to Randsburg the other
'lay to see if there were not women
miners there, and the first one I
met was Mrs. Furgerson. She is a
Kentucky woman. ' who, although
she was hut a girl then, made things
BO extremely lively in her vicin
ity during the v. ar that it was neces
sary not only to imprison but to
Shackle her for sis months. In addi
tion to being actually destitute when
released, she was so crippled that she
could not walk for months; but J don't
think she blames the North for it, for
she admits that nothing short of that
could have kept her in the prison. She
has lived in Los Angeles for thirty-two
years, and is a brilliant example of
what a woman whf has had no train
ing may accomplish in business if she
only have intelligence and confidence.
She said: "I really understand more
about water systems and real estate
transactions than mining, but I have
become interested in these mines here
and am convinced of their value, and I
believe Randsburg will be a most im
portant mining center as soon as we
can get a good flow of water into the
town, so I have left my other interests
in competent hands and am devoting
all my time to this place. I have a
mine of my own and an interest in
serera] others about nine miles from
here. The ore is mostly silver and
lead, and we are tunneling for it. I
would have been back earlier, . but I
thought the boys would like a batch
4ht bread, and I stopped to make
it. I have located a new mine at Pa
hute Rock, and am putting up a mill
to crush my own ore and thus save
the expense of hauling to the mill that
1 have to do here."
Mrs. Sophie W. Knight, who is well
known all over the country as a Chnu
tauqua lecturer on cooking and its in
troduction into the public schools, is
living in Randsburg and is part owner
in a number of mines. The balance of
the company are in San Francisco,
and she manages all their affairs in
Randsburg. She said. laughingly :
"I'm very busily engaged in mining,
but I'm not the sort of 'material' you
want at all. I'll take you to s-e Mrs.
Sutherland and Mrs. Garrison, who i i
the work themselves." Mrs. Gfau
had located a new claim, and wa
lant over the prospect. She was dressed
in- a short skirt and waist of wool,
thick shoes and leggins and a cap, ali
showing signs of heavy wear, and her
face was much tanned by exposure.
"Indeed, my clothes have had hard
usage," she said, 'and a number of
suits before this. I was a student of
geology and wildly interested in min
erals in my school days: but I mar
ried, and my duty to my family came
first. I had to wait until my four
children were grown and married be
fore 1 had a chance to go on with this
Work. For the last few years I have
given all my time to it, and I hope
never to live in a city again.
"I am completely happy* in this life;
the mountains are my friends. When
I die I want to be buried in them, and
until then I will live among them. 1
learned the business by taking an old
prospector out with me and making
him explain over and over again every
foot of ground we covered. Then I be
gan to experiment myself, and I have
had splendid success. I located alone
fourteen mines in Inyo County, all of
which turned out well. I lived five
months in the canyons where those
mines are, with one of my little grand
sons for company.
â¢How do 1 prospect? Well, I take
my miners pick, the long handle serv
ing for a cane, and travel over the hills
until I find a place that I like the looks
of. I pile up the rocks for my monu
ment, put in a piece of paper describ
ing my claim, return to town and have
the duplicate recorded and 'horn out'
specimens I've brought in. If they
show -color' I load my dry washer on
to my burro and lead him to the claim
and while my partner throws the dirt
on I turn the crank to shake the
screen. After about a dozen or fifteen
shovelfuls have gone through we take
out the riffleboard and blow the dust
out of the riffles. What gold there is
catches in the riffles and we gather it
up, and then she turns the crank while
I shovel. Some dirt is so rich it pays
to work it over three or four times but
as a rule twice is enough. My claims
here are so dry that I don't need to
work with the pick at all. We can lift
it all out with the shovel. It's simply
fascinating work. You're never happy
at anything else after you really get
into it. I'm going to try this' new
washer now."

GREAT PROSPECTS

By JACOB NEFF
President Miners' flssociatlon
W T the present time the outlook
l\ f<>r the mining industry in Cali
f 1 fornia is brighter and more en-
V couraging than it has been in
twenty years past. Miners and
capitalists have every reason for look
ing hopefully toward the future. I be
lieve that future to be exceptionally
rich in fulfillment.
In my opinion the mining industry in
this State, now revived with r> n<
vigor, will bo the occasion of a jubilee
fifty years hence even more pro
nounced in enthusiasm and general in
terest than the one we are now cele
brating.
We who are familiar with the re
sources of California as a mining center
know what a marvelous country is ours
on this western shore. But this knowl
edge should be disseminated: should be
repeated until the whole world realizes
the fact that in California exist oppor
tunities incalculable for successful
mining of that glittering treasure, gold.
How snail we spread the fame of our
State? By judicious advertising: by

courses similar to toe psÂ£jÂ»Â»nt rivers. The character of the deposits shows that there.has been an intermittent action. I'.ut

The great part California has playea

fully one-quarter of this increase has
derived (rum th>- gold mines of
that state. Of the entir< gold produc
: California, not less than nine
tentha has been yielded by the "aurif

Th<- \"- \] yield of the auriferous grav

by the value of a cube of pure

gravel mines of California.
Th<- auriferous gravels may be divid
er! Into '. â â¢ â â¢ classes :
First- The shallow or modern placers.
â¢ I t >eep "i" ancient placers.
These terms are Indicative of the
very characteristic difference that ex
ists between the two classes of placers.
The signification of these terms will
be apparent from an explanation <>f the
origin and mode of occurrence <>f the
placers. These placers are superficial
accumulations "t" auriferous alluvions
along the gulches, l>ais, data, etc.. and
are designated bar or flat dig
gings, according to their topographical
position. The deposits along the mod
ern rivers I. â â ;.- i" the shallow placers.
The gold-bearing detritus of which
they consist has been derived from the
ancient \ lacers or the quartz veins; in
some Instances from both sources.
Through the disintegrating and trans
porting power of the mete if agencies,
espei tally "f running water, the ma
terial has been brought from the above
sources. ar.<l redeposited in places of
lower elevatidta, where it was discov
er â¢! by i lie pioneer miners. Thus thÂ«Â»
assorting procesi hi ' carried, by
natural agencies, one step farther than
in the rase <â !' the deep or ancient pla
cers, and two steps farther than in the
formation of the gold-bearing quarts
\eins. To this process of the higher
concentration of the gold is due the ex
traordinary richness of the shallow pla
< .is.
Prom the shallow placers, and from
the beds of the modern rivers, came
Dearly ;i!l the sold produced by Cali

the larger percentage up to the y-ar
1860. Th- exhaustion of the gold grav
els, callable of brine worked with profit
by such primitive means as were avail
able at that time, led to the abandon
ment of the shallow dippings.
The unworked deposits, also, often
occur below the drainage level.
The pan and cradle, especially the
former, are still used for the purpose
of "prospecting" or testing the gravel,
and for cleaning up the sluices, batter
ies, etc., at all min>s.

it below the point at which it is de
signed to extract the graveL This sys
tem Involves considerable expense, and
is usually attended with great uncer
tainty as to the success of the enter
prise.
Dredges are used in a few localities
where gravel occurs below the drain
age level of the locality to elevate the
gravel to ;l point sufficiently high to
obtain the requisite grade for sluicing
and for the dump.
The gold-saving apparatus of the
shallow placer mme â the pan, cradle,
torn, sluice, etc. â are now objects of
hardly more than historical interest.
From their nature, as compared with
the illimitable resources of the deep
placers, the shallow diggings, as a
source of gold, will be but of a tran
sient character. The virtual exhaus
tion of the superficial gravel deposits
gave origin to that "prospecting" for
the source of gold which resulted in the
discovery Of the deep placers and of the
quarts veins.
From these discoveries dates the in
auguration of mining as a scientific and
permanent industry in this State.
The tjuartz bowlders found in gravel
mines often carry considerable gold.
At Polar Star mine, Dutch Flat, a
white quartz bowlder was found which
contained $5760 worth of gold. The gold
has undoubtedly been derived from the
gold-bearing quartz veins so numerous
along the western slope of the Sierras.
By water it has been transported and
deposited along with the detritus in
pre-existing valleys, where now found.
In the quartz veins the gold rarely ex
ists of such large size as often found
in the gravel deposits, and this would
seem to be incompatible with the the
ory of its source as above given.
Formation of Nuggetsâ To explain
this seeming incongruity several the
ories have been advanced. Professor
Whitney is of the poinion that the gold
veins were richer nearer the surface
in pliocene times than now, and main
tains that gold veins get poorer as
depth is attained. In the judgment of
the writer, who has examined nearly
all th~ mines of this State, there is no
connection between the richness of the
ore and the depth at which found. A
more plausible explanation of the for
mation of the nuggets is. as has been
suggested by Le Conte and other geolo
gists, that their large size is often due
t. a chemical as well as a mechanical
l>henomenon. It seems probable that
the gold has been redissolved and re
precipitated. By oxidation, the iron py
rites has been changed into the sul
phate. Percolating solutions of the sul
phate of iron dissolve the gold with
which it corr.es in contact, and coming
in contact later with organic and other
reducing agencies, the sulphate of iron
is changed by them to the sulphuret.
depositing the gold as this change takes
place. By the deposition* of gold in
some such manner, from solutions con
stantly in the same place, nuggets are
formed.
The aggregate length of the ancient
channels has been estimated at 400
miles. This does not include the so
called cement channels, which are but
"f subordinate economic importance.
The yield per mile of channels of the
average character is. at a low estimate,
from $2,000,000 to $3,0W.0ft0. Good chan
nels for drifting yield from $100 to $500
per linoal foot of the stratum extract
ed. From one-fifth to one-half of the
gold in the channels usually may be ob
tained from drifting, where the bed
rock gravel is accessible; the lowest
stratum of gravel, four to eight feet in
depth, carries this portion of the ag
gregate gold contents of the channel.
Hundreds of millions have been
taken out of the gold deposits of Cali

Made by COLONEL R. B. MfISON, U. S. fl., t:
Headquarters
Tenth Military Department,
Monterey, CaL, Aug. 17, 1848.
General li. Jones, Adjutant-General,
U. S. A., Washington. D. Câ Sir: I
have the honor to inform you that, ac
companied by Lieutenant W. T. Sher
man, Third Artillery, acting assistant
adjutant-general. I started on the 12th
of June last to make a tour through
the northern part of California. My
principal purpose was to visit the new
ly discovered gold placer in the valley
of the Sacramento.
We reached San Francisco on the
20th, and found that all, or nearly all,
its male population had gone to the
mines. The town, which a few months
before was so busy and thriving, was
then almost deserted. On the evening
of the 24th the horses of the escort
were crossed to Sausalito in a launch,
and on the following day we resumed
th.> journey, by way of Bodega and
Sonoma, to Sutter's Fort, where w<>
arrived on the morning of July 2.
Along the whole route mills were 'lying
idle, fields of wheat were open to cattle
and horses, houses vacant and farms
going to waste. At Sutter's there was
more life ami business. Launches were
discharging their cargoes at the river
and carts were hauling goods to the
fort, where already were established
several stores, a hotel, etc. Captain
j Sutter had only two mechanics in his
employâ a wagon-maker and a black
smith, whom he was then paying SlO
per day. Merchants pay him a month
| ly rent of $100 per room, and while I
was there a two-story house in the fort
was rented as a hotel for $500 a month.
I proceeded twenty-five miles up the
American fork to a point on it now
' known as the lower mines, or Mormon
diggings. The hillsides were thickly
, strewn with canvas tents and bash ar
j bors. A store was erected, and several
â  boarding shanties in operation. The
I day was intensely hot; yet about 200
| men were at work in the full glare of
, the sun, washing for gold, some with
' tin pans, some with close- woven In
dian baskets, but the greater part had
a rude machine known as a cradle.
This is on rockers six or eight feet long,
open at the foot, and at its head has
a coarse grate and sieve; the bottom is
j rounded, with small cleats nailed
across. Four men are required to work
this machine. One digs the gravel in
the bank close by the stream, another
: carries it to the cradle and empties it
on the grate, a third gives a violent
rocking motion to the machine, while
the fourth dashes on water from tf^
stream. The sieve keeps the coarse
stones from entering the cradle, the
gold was found in placers, which were*
worked by Lopez and his associates for
years, and they have been worked at
intervals until the present day. They
were not very rich, and by reason of
the scarcity of water the greater part
Of the season, their yield was never
much in excess of the day wages of the
men employed.
Long before the time of Lopez gold
was mined in the placers in the Colo
rado River region by Mexicans, who
came north from Sonora, and by In
dians. A discovery of gold was thus
made at San Ysidro, now in San Die ! 'c
County, in 1828, and there are fairly
well authenticated records of a placet
gold discovery and workings in what i*
now known as the Cargo Muchachd
mining district, San Diego County fif
teen miles northwest of Fort Yuina a=
early as 1775.
None of these discoveries created any
excitement. *
Southern California being the most
current of the water washes off the
earthy matter and the gravel is grai
ually carried out at the foot of i>
machine, leaving the sold mixed will
a fine heavy black sand above the first
cleats. The sand and gold mixed to
gether are then drawn yff through
auger holes into a pan below, are dried
in the sun and afterward separated by
blowing off the sand.
A party of four men thus employed
at the lower mines averaged $100 a
day. The Indians and those who have
nothing but pans or willow baskets
gradually wash out the earth and Bep3|
arate the gravel by hand, leaving noth
ing but the gold mixed with the sand,
which is separated in the manner de
scribed. The gold in the lower mines
is in tine bright scales, of which I send
several specimens.
On the 7th of July I left the mill
and crossed to a small stream empty
ing into the American fork, three or
four miles below the sawmill. I struck
this stream (now known as Webers
Creek) at the washings of Sunal & Co.
They had about thirty Indians employ
ed, whom they pay in merchandise
They were getting gold of a character
similar to that found in the main fork,
and doubtless in sufficient quantities
to satisfy them. I send you a small
specimen, presented by this company,
of their gold. From this point we pro
ceeded up the stream about eight
miles, where we found a great many
people and Indians; some engaged in
the bed of the stream and others in the
small side valleys that put into it.
These latter are exceedingly rich, and
two ounces were considered an ordi
nary yield for a day's work. A small
gutter not more than a hundred yards
long by four feet wide and two or three
feet deep was pointed out to me as the
one where two men, William Daly and
Perry McCloon, had a short time be
fore obtained in seven days $17,000
worth of gold.
I might tell of hundreds of similar
instances; but to illustrate how plenti
ful the gold was in the pockets of com
mon laborers, "l will mention a simple
occurrence which took place in my
presence when I was at Weber's store.
This store was nothing but an arbor of
bushes, under which he had exposed
for sale goods and groceries suited to
his customers. A man came in, picked.
up a box of seidlitz powders and askc^T
its price. Captain Weber told him it
was not for sale. The man offered an
ounce of gold, but Captain Weber told
him it only cost 50 cenls. and he did
not wish to sell It. The man then of
fered an ounce and a. half, when Cap
tain Weber had to take it. The oric^"Ever Done

ly to depreciate its value.
The principal store at Butter's Fort,
that of Brannan & Co.. had received in
payment for goods $36,000 worth of this
gold from the Ist of May to the 10th of
July: other merchants had also made
extensive sales. Large quantities Â'
goods were daily sent forward to the
mines, as the Indians, heretofore so
poor and degraded, have suddenly be
come consumers of the luxuries of life.
I before mentioned that the greater
part of the farmers and rancheros had
abandoned their fields to go to the
mines; this is not the case with Captain
Slitter, who was carefully gathering his
wheat, estimated at 40,000 bushels.
Flour is already worth at Slitter's $:!G
a barrel, and soon will be 550. Unless
large quantities of breadstuffs reach
the country, much suffering will occur;
but as each man is now able to pay a
large price, It is believed the merchant:!
â will brin.T from Chile and Oregon a
plentiful supply for the coming winter.
The most moderate estimate I
could obtain from men acquainted
"with the subject was that upward of
4000 men were working in the gold dis
trict, of whom more than half were
Indians, and that from 530,000 to 550,
000 worth of gold, if not more, was
daily obtained. The entire gold dis
trict, with very few exceptions of
grants made some years ago by the
American authorities, is on land be
longing to the United States. It was
a matter of serious reflection with me
how I could secure to the Government
certain rents or fees for the privilege
of procuring this, gold; but upon con
sidering the large extent of country,
the character of the people engaged
and the small scattered force at my
command I resolved not to interfere,
but permit all to work freely, unless

counties in comparison with other por
tions of the State, the industry in
Southern California was languishing
and fitful for three or four decades.
Within its limits there are not less
than 4000 mines or mining claims,
which are either being steadily worked
or are considered of at least sufficient
value by the owners to justify them in
keeping up their annual assessment
work.
Every mining district is immediately
isibie to one or the other and some
both of the railway systems, or
is within one or two days' drive from
a railway station.
The most notable of the desert min
ing districts is Kandsburg. From this
latter point the new railroad runs to
Johannesburg, which is a couple Ol
miles east of Randsburg. Both places
are the outgrowth of the mines of the
district, and are quite flourishing
"camps." There is now a population
to particular spots of ground may
cause collisions, but they win be ran",
as the extent of country is so great
and the gold po abundant that for the
present there is room and enough for
all.
The discovery of these vast deposits
of gold has entirely changed the char
acter of Upper California. Its people.
before engaged in cultivating their
small patches of ground and guarding
their herds of cattle and horses, have
ail gone to the mines, or are on their
way thither. Laborers of every I
have left their work benches and
srnen their shops; sailors desert
their ships as fast as they arrive on
th'- coast, and several vessels have
gone to sea wjth hardly enough hands
to spread a sail; two or three are now
at anchor in San Francises with no
crews on board. Many desertions have
taken place, too. from th" garrisons
within the influence of th" mines; twen
ly-six .soldiers have deserted from the
post of Sonoma, twenty-four from that
of San Francisco and twenty-four from
Monterey. For a few days the evil
appeared so threatening that great
danger existed that the garrisons would
leave in a body.
Many private letters have gone to
the United States giving accounts of
the vast quantity of gold recently dis
covered, and it may be a matter of
surprise why I have made no report
on this subject at an earlier date. The
reason is, that I could not bring my
self to believe the reports that I heard
of the wealth of the gufd district until
I visited it myself. ! have no hesita
tion now in saying that there is more
gold in the country drained by the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
than will pay the cost of th<> present
war with Mexico a hundred times over.
No capital is required to obtain this
gold, as the laboring man wants noth
ing but his pick, shovel and tin pan,
with which to dig and wash thf gravel;
and many frequently pick gold out of

this district that there are a remark

By A. H. RICKETTS.

sporadic and unimportant, and
until the passage of that a< I

United States other than that estab

mining districts into which the State
was divided by them. Miners" CUS
grew up or ruics were ad' pted at mass
meetings of the miners which had the

were ftdopted. This system
1 in California by the Argo
nauts, gradually extended in its gen-
Ceatures to the other mining States
and becan lerican common law
vi mining.
It is a popular fallacy that these
rules and customs originated in Cali
fornia. Historical accuracy ascribes a
different origin to them. The old Cali
tornians had little or no experience in
mining. "The Spanish-American sys
tem," says the late Mr. Gregory Yale,
the distinguished authority on mining
law, "which has grown up under the
practical working of the mining ordi
nances for New Spain was the founda
tion of the rules and customs adopted."
Senator Stewart has ascribed unde
served merit to the early miners in pro
nouncing them the authors of the local
rules and customs. In his letter to Sen
ator Ramsey he says that the miners
were forced from the necessity of the
case to make laws for themselves; that
each mining district formed its own
rules and adopted its own customs; the
similarity of. which throughout the
entire mining region, extending over
an area of 50.000 square miles, was so
great as to attain all the beneficial re
sults of well-digested general laws.
They were democratic in their charac
ter, guarding against every form of
monopoly, requiring continual work
and occupation in good faith, to consti
tute a valid possession.
This letter is an interesting paper,
coming from . a representative miner,
and is correct in stating the nature of
the rules and customs, and the uni
formity of their adoption. But they
were not the spontaneous creation of
the miners of 1849-50. They reflect the
matured wisdom of the practical miner
of past ages, and have as their founda
tion,.as has been stated, in certain nat
ural laws, easily applied to different
situations, and were propagated in the
California mines by those who had a
practical and traditional knowledge of
them in varied forms, in the countries
of their origin, and were adopted and
no doubt gradually imrroved and judi
ciously modified by the Americans.
This self-evident fact can be admitted
without detracting from our national
pride.
These regulations do not materially
differ from existing national and State
laws upon mining; they fixed the
boundaries of the district, the qualifi
cations of the locator,; the size of the
claims, the manner .in which claims
should be marked and recorded, the
amount of work which should be done
to cure'th? title and the circum
stances under which the claim ml.^ht

often not more than ten, and there

The size of placer claims depended
upon the character of th- ""diggings"

claim was usually 100 feet wide and
reached to the middle of the hill. River
diggings embraced a certain distance
up and down the river or creek with

to work a claim within a limited num

a law of uniform application; but con
fusion still exists here in regard to the
possible size of locations, the manner
of marking their exterior boundai tes,
etc., as that law, unlike that of other
mining States, is strangely silent upon
those points, leaving such matters still
within the jurisdiction of the mining
districts.

About the time the "Bear flag" was

Mexican soldiers in front of the Plaza

Commodore Sloat had captured Mon

making up their minds to join the
Americans. Securing a horse, he rode
to Monterey and was heartily wel

about the country. Captain John C.

THE GLOBE FOR GOLD.
AMONG the earliest arrivals, that

vessels that brought Stevenson's

Thomas H. Perkins, Susan Drew and

around the Horn, reaching this port on
March 7, 1847, in 163 days.
It was months after the famous dis
â¢pvery that the fact became known in
t he United States, on account of the
slow methods of transmission of news.
It was not then, as it. is now,
when an event occurring in San
Francisco may be given to the
-people of the East inside of five
minutes and to the world at large in
side of two hours, but in that long ago
of slow communication the transmis
sion of news depended upon some one
going to the States by way of the
trackless plains or upon the still more
uncertain departure of some
that would round the Horn and stop at
every port on the way, consequently
it was Dot until late in I^^ that the
tide of emigration sei out by land and
by sea for the new Xl Dorado, and ar
rivals date from IV4>.1 V 4>.
Everything that could float was
il into the service as passenger
carriers, and the pioneers in the line
of these carriers were not of \h" class
that grace the harbor of San Francisco
at this time; there were none of those
fine models with all the comforts that
modern civilization has devised, but
the majority were what among sailors
are known as "old tubs," yet they
managed to pet here, the passage
varying according to smooth water,
good wind and sailing quality from 107
to 233 days. In the year I^4H. An idea
of the size of the vessels reaching
bere in that year may be had from the
fact that the aggregate tonnage of
fifty-seven of these appearing In con
secutive order on a page of th<- Cus
tom-house records showed an average
of 21C tons.
The demand for passenger vessels
gave the famous clipper ship<. built
for comfort and speed. While the av
erage passage was 12:'Â» days, s >me of
these clippers made the trip from New
York in less than 100 days, notably the
Flying Cloud, whicta arrived here in
lv.l in eighty-nine days, at that time
considered a most remarkable voyage.
Then the next favorite route of trav
el was by way of the Isthmus of Dari
cn. when passengers were carried from
New York to Aspinwafl, then occupy
ing five days and a half crossing the
isthmus, and then taking the steamer
at Panama; the Oregon, Panama and
California, being pioneers <>n this side,
and the fare being $.0,00. 0 ,00 cabin and Jl7>
in the steerage. These were old side
wheelers buiU expressly for the trade.
Subsequently, in January. !<*:>?,. the
time by this l'ne was shortened, for
the isthmus railroad was opened, and
the trains traverseu vi 2re and one
half hours the territory that under the
previous system occupied live and one
half days in crossing.
On this line were carried the mails,
and the people on this side were happy
when they received a letter or a paper
frcrm home in about five or six days
less than they had been in the habit of
receiving them. Twenty- five or six
days from New York was looked upon
as rapid transit. And every one look
ed for the arrival of the steamer with
news from ' the East with an anxiety
that probably has never had a parallel
in any community. When a mail
steamer was sighted the fact was made
known by a signal, understood by ev
ery one, displayed from â¢ the staff on
Sweeny & Baugh's observatory, on top
of Telegraph Hill, and then all was ex
citement. If a customer entered a store
to order a bill of goods, he was told:
"The steamer's coming in; come round
in the morning, and we'll tend to your
busl"Â« a Â«Â«." â  "
(he crush cf vessels that tne incoming steamers could not force their way through and passengers had to be rowed in srmll boats to th? wharf
the boatmen charging jio for each passenger. In the for -ground of the picture is the famous ho'el of those days, whicu was built from old ves
sels and raised on piles. Despite its homely architecture, its prices were enormous, but were cheerfully paid in gold dust by the successful fortune
hunters. The secti.n of the city near the junction of what is now Sacramento and Mason streets was then considered in the suburbs. The first
house put up there was built by a Mr. Sohyer, contrary to the advice of his friends, who laughed at him for building so far out among the sand
hills. Where his hcus? once s'coi, blocks away trom any other structures in those days, is now the heart of the city.
A number of small shanties spang up like mushrooms at the base or Telegraph Hiii, and on the top was bui.t the telegraph station which
gave the name to the hill. There was one house on Goat Island, where passengers in rowboats and sailboats sought safety from storms while

Then came in 18fÂ»8 the establishment
of the overland line of stages known as
1 1 i Â» - Butterfield line, throuph California,
Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Ar
kansas, which left twice a week, and
while the time of the trip was no
shorter than by steamer, the advantage
gained was that mail was received
B month, instead of once a month
by water.
While it was admitted that the over
land route was a decided improvement
over the other routes in the carrying

Pacific Mail route or Panama route,
there was the opposition or Tehuante

and th.it led in the latter part of 1859
to the organization of the Pony ex
press. This was between Sacramento
and Bt Joseph, the then most westerly
point reached by railroad, and it was
calculated that by a relay of riders and
horses the distance of 1900 miles could
be covered in ten days. The route was

the mail reached this city. The letters

1861, the Pony express brought Lin

The breaking out of the War of the
Rebellion closed the Butterfield route
overland, and then the overland route
on the line followed by the Pony ex
press was established, and the time
was about two days less than by the
southern route. This was kept up un

MY EXCITING LIFE AS
CHILD BORN IN
BY MRS. R. M. REID
BEING the first white child born
in California, perhaps I take a
deeper interest in her welfare
than others.
I was born at Suiter's Fort
on September 3, 1546. My father, John
Gregson, and mother had come to Cali
fornia the year before from Illinois.
They arrived at Johnston's ranch,
on Bear Creek, on October 20, 1846,
and a couple of weeks later they
moved to Sutter's Fort, where father
obtained employment at his trade of
blaeksmithing. Here my birth occurred
the following fall.
The fort at that time consisted of
about one hundred men and a few
women. But the discovery of gold soon
made the place a bustling headquartei's
for mining men. Shortly after my birth
father joined a company that was or
ganized to go to General Fremont at
Monterey. They took down a drove of
horses. When General Vallejo was a
prisoner of the Bear Flag party at the
fort father was one of the guards in
charge of the distinguished personage.

little fort.
When the Indians heard of me, they.
too, must see the little paleface. They
were amused, but skeptical; and in
sisted on pinching me to make me cry
before they were satisfied I was alive.
The squaws hung around the place and
watched me for hours at a time.
Captain John Sutter was so pleased
over the event that he wanted my par
ents to call me John Sutter Gregson.
and said he would give me a league of
land if they would do so. But they
hardly thought John Sutter a prop p

Gregson, and his wish went unfu

HUNTERS TO THE COAST.
THAT "necessity is me morner of invention " wis never more clearlydemon
strated t .an in the early history of San Francisco. The great thing;, d.-sired
in those days were houses. As it was, house* were scarce and ships were
plenty. The crews of mist of the ships deserted soen after reac .in.; this port
on account of violent attacks of gold fever, and the vessels could not leave port and
lay idle on the bay for days. It was at this time that Am-ric:<n genius asserted it
self and tamed the ship^into all sorts of habitations. Seme of them were trans
formed as they lay out in the bay, while others were towed ashore. Here they were
made into hotels, boarding-houses, stores, saloons an J any number of other habita
tions. The most notable of these oddities were the old ship Apollo, that was trans
formed in:o a saloon, and the ship Panama, that was housed over and made to do
duty as a church. George D. Dorner tilted her up and transformed her until she
was hardly recognizable.
HOW I HELPED TO RAISE THE
OLD BEAR FLAG
I WAS born in St. Ciair County, 111.,
June 17, 18^2. Eleven years later
my family moved to Southwestern
Missouri, and in March, 1543, my
brother William, who at the age
of eighty years, and healthy, still lives
at San Ramon, this State, my father
and myself started for Oregon with an
ox and mule team. William had vis
ited Oregon two years previously, com
ing most of the way with General John
Bidwell and party, and was thoroughly
familiar with the route to be traveled.
Starting with us were Peter H. Bur
nett, later the first Governor of Califor
nia, and family. Jesse. Lindsay and
Charley Applegate and families. Wil
liam Winter, William Hargrave and
Captain <J. P. Swift, the latter two
members of the memorable Bear Flag
party. Peter Burnett was captain of
the party for a distance, when a divi
sion occurred, and William Fowler was
installed as captain of our division. Dr.
Whitman, then a noted missionary of
Walla Walla, who with his wife was
afterward killed by the Indians, joined
our party at I'latte River, being <>n his
return from a visit to the East.
We reached Oregon City after a te
dious journey, and there spent the win
ter of 1843-44 working for Dr. McLaugh
lin, who owned and laid out the town.
In June, 1544, we started horseback and
with packhorses for California. With
us from there were the well-known
Kelseys, now deceased.
The route traveled was very nearly
that traversed by the railroad at the
present time. It was difficult to get
through, for there was scarcely a trail
anywhere and the wooded sections were
badly infested by Indians. We had,
however, few skirmishes of a serious
character. Fortune seemed to smile on
us all the way, but it would have been
otherwise had we not had some Hud
son Bay men for guides, who were
dreaded by the Coast Indians at that
time.
At the Soda Springs near where is
now Sissons, a short season was passed
in camp. Here the members of the
party grew fat on the finest biscuit
ever tasted, the dough being both
mixed and raised by the use of the car
bonated water. We finally trudged on
and eventually pitched camp on Cache
Creek. Yolo County, just below the
cabin of William Gordon, who came
here in the early '30's and who was the
grandfather of Hon. Frank L. Coombs,
now Speaker of the California Assem
bly.
This was the first house seen since
leaving the Chehalem Valley, Oregon.
In the latter part of '44 our party
moved over to old Sonoma, where the
male members, including myself, work
ed for General Vallejo, completing his
adobe houses. The following year my
father and myself purchased the ranch
at Calistoga now owned by Mrs. Le
iand Stanford. Tho property adjoined
that of the noted Sam Brannan. We
raised cattle and farmed in general.
Tt wns Juno IS, lS4fi. that Sonoma was
captured, the Boar Flag raised and the
Republic of California Treated. General
Fremont put "Stuttering" Merritt. an
Old hunter, at th^ head of the capturing
party. Pome thirty or more persona
went with him, each armed with a sin

gle-shot nfte. Merrm was selected be
cause he had been previously captured
and maltreated by General and Halra
dor Vallejo. Merritt was instructed bj
Fremont even to the language for th"<
occasion. General Vallejo was rushed
upon and Merritt said: Vâ yâ ou art
my prisoner."
Vallejo was dumfouttded for a mo.
ment and then replied in broken Eng
lish: "By what authority?"
"I'm the authority!" shouted Merritt.
"W âw â when i wâ w â was your
pp â pâ prisoner you tâtâ treated me like
a d â d â dog; now you're my pâpâpris
oner and I tâtâ treat you like a
g â s â gentleman."
The Bear Flag was made by William
Tod, a relative of Mrs. Abraham Lin
coln, and hoisted while the prisoners
were taken to Sutter's Fort. Tod was
later cap Hired by some Mexicans, but
subsequently n scued.
The original Bear flag was made ol
the poorest quality of linen â an under
garment taken from a clothesline. Now
the flag at present recognized is made
of fair material. Besides, the bear is
in a different attitude, being in the
original just rising on his haunches,
with both paws extended, while in this
he is on all four feet. The original is
still in Pioneer Hall, San Francisco-,
and should be adopted. Tl is much
worn and effaced, but the powder coloi
remains together with slight traces <>1
the red. Jacob P. Leese, General Valle-
Jo's brother-in-law, told me that after
his release from Sutter's Fort he wnt
down to the river near by and saw a
red Bear flag floating on a launch. He
gave a kanaka $5 to steal it for him,
and this and Fremont's battle-Mag,
which had been stolen from the fort
by Leese, were. taken by the latter and
left with Jacob Snyder ' of Sonoma.
What became of the Bear Mag after
that I do not know.
In July, ISIG, Fremont named him
self Governor of "the new California Re
public, and organized the Loyal Alli
ance. All of ns Americana subscribed
to the Alliance excepting one, a hunter
named Fallon. who declared he wanted
no republic and could protect himself.

The alleged attempt of the Prince of

CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSHES.
THE great rush of diggers to Cali
fornia, which reached lta height
In 1849, naturally drew to theae
shores from all parts of the
world men of exceptionable and
adventurous dispositions. There -were
thousands of young fellows who had
fought in the Mexican war, who were
Inured to hardship in every form:
there were bronzed sailors, who sailed
in every latitude; there were reckless
adventurers of every race, all drawn
togther by the lodestone of gold, the
precious metal which report said was
to be had for the picking up.
Of course report, in this as in every
other case, exaggerated the real truth,
but still enough gold was obtained,
even in the first year after Marshall's
discovery, to Justify the rush. The
yield went on steadily increasing until,
from $15,000,000 in the first year, it
reached the top notch in 1852. During
this wonderful year no less than $85,
000,000 worth of gold was taken from
the soil of California, a record which
has never been surpassed.
This was the hey-day of California
mining prosperity, and it is no wonder
that during these wonderfully rich
years men with plenty of money ir.
their pockets were only too eager to
listen to every tale of discovery and to
rush like sheep blindly for the new
Bouroe of wealth.
One of the most remarkable of theso
futile rushes occurred in ISSI, when a
report came to San Francisco that gold
had been found In large quantities on
the â¢ ocean beach in Klamath County,
near a place christened Gold Bluff. The
wildest rumors were circulated, the
Band was reported to yield from three
to ten dollars' worth of gold per pound.
Two days after the news reached San
Francisco eight vessels were advertised
to sail for the Bluff, but the excite
ment died away as rapidly as it had
arisen as soon as truthful accounts
reached the city.
Next time rumor, with her lying
tongue, went far afield, and in 1853 a
series of letters were pubiisned in the
Panama press asserting that very rich
gold mines had been discovered on the
Amazon, in Peru. This news of course
was reproduced in the San Francisco
press, credulous gold seekers swallowed
It, and a thousand or more men sailed
for Callao to discover on landing that
the people of the city knew absolutely
nothing of these mythical mines.
A couple of years later the Kern
River rush followed, surpassing in in
tensity any of itÃ predecessors. In this
case the rush was also started by the
familiar device of false letters, and
â ome five thousand diggers made their
â way to the Kern River, only to find
that no adequate reward for their toil
some Journey awaited them.

He opened ft faro gam*.
He dealt ao fair that a millionoir*
He became id conree of time.
Till death slept in and called th* tars
Iv the JayÂ» of '13.
Still more serious consequences fol
lowed the news in 1858 of the discovery
of rich alluvial on the Fraser River in
British Columbia. The rush which fol
lowed caused a panic in San Francis
co, real property fell in value to an
alarming degree, and claims which had
been yielding wealth to their owners
were abandoned as worthless. Every
one wanted to get to the Fraser River.
It has been estimated that at least 18,
000 people went there curing the year,
and the State at one stroke lost a third
of its voters. The diggings proved dis
appointing, and by degrees the miners
drifted back to California, satisfied that
better prospects were to be found in
this State than anywhere else.
The gold, so plentiful in the earlier
days, cast a halo of romance over
everything it touched and the old
timers, most of whom have now passed
away, used to tell many wonderful
stories of adventure in the wilds. These
stories, growing as they traveled, had
been passed on from camp to camp,
from prospector to prospector, until
every person knew of at least one mine
of phenomenal richness where gold had
not to be dug for. but simply shoveled
up in huge chunks.
The only trouble about these myth
ical mines was that they could never
be found; they always, in some peculiar
way, got themselves lost in the ranges
after the first discovery. To this cate
gory belongs the marvelous "Gold
Lake," which was said to excel in
wealth the richest placers of the world.
It was in 1850. during the first flush
of digging excitement, that a man
named Stoddard wandered into a busy
camp at Downieville, and told his tale
to eager listeners. He had been lost
in the wilds of the Sierras, and had
stumbled upon a lake the sideÃ and
bottom of which were absolutely paved
with pure gold.
When the spring came a party of
twenty-five prospectors started out
with Stoddard, but he soon proved that
he knew nothing of the country, and
wandered helplessly about from valley
to range. Behind his party came a
long string of other gold seekers, who
had heard Stoddard's story, and were
determined to stick to his trail, even
if it led to the nethermost regions.
Thus the procession meandered for
weeks about this mountainous coun
try, until at last the miners lost all pa
tience with their leader and made
preparations for hanging him. But
Stoddard begged so hard for one more
chance that they postponed the execu
tion for a day, and during the night
Stoddard prudently disappeared.
Strangely enough, there may have
! been a measure of truth in the man's
' story, because in Plumas County there
is actually a lake which corresponds

of fresh country. After wandering

rooms devoted to the sale and display
of musical instruments on quite so
large a scale outside of New York or
Chicago. Mr. Mauzy has been In th!s
building for eleven years past and has
each year made improvements that have
kept him abreast of the times. The
large central room can be turned into
a hall %vith a seating capacity of 800.
The various rooms are filled with dif
ferent makes of pianos, of which Mr.
Mauzy is the sole representative. Es
pecially attractive are the two large
rooms devoted to the display of the
Sohmer piano. The Grand room is
complete with Parlor, Baby and Bijou
Grands in mahogany and oak cases.
The Upright room has cases in mahog
any, walnut, birdseye maple and oak,
all of the choicest and finest woods.
The room devoted to the display of the
Byron Mauzy Pianos is also an at
tractive one.
With extensive facilities for manu
facturing in New York, and 20 years of
retail! experience in handling all the
promijnent makes of pianos, Mr. Mauzy
Is enabled to cull out the strongest
pointsj of all these Instruments, and
combine them. In a piano In every way
adapted to the use and needs of this
climate.
The Byron Mauzy Piano is made on
the latest scientific plans, and has all
the new improvements. The most
beautiful woods are selected for the
casings, and these are double cross
veneered, with handsome etched and
carved panels.
The sounding board is made to pro
duce the fullest volume of tone; the
action the latest improved; the ham
mers of the best felt; the white keys
are ivory and the black keys are ebony.
The backs are open and of hard
wood, nicely finished. There are three
pedals, one of them a muffler, so ar
ranged that a child can practice in the
same room without disturbing any
one.
Every piano is warranted for ten
years.
A Prominent Mlnlog Man.
One of the most notable successes
that have hpen rvadf> in the State in th<*
mining business is that of Mr. Willfred
G. Drown of Angela, Cal. Marting at
the bottom of me ladder he has, by
his superior Judgment and indomitable
will, made a name for himself of which
any man might be proud. He is a
native of Massachusetts and came to
California in IST6. His first experience
in minir.g was pained at Angels, where
he was associated with Charles J,ane,
one of the owners of the famous QUca
mine. Mr. Drown is a machinist by
trade and his work was invaluable to
the Utica. He started in as an ordi
nary miner and worked himself up to
have charge of the top works of the
mine, a very responsible position and
one requiring a thorough knowledge of
the business. He left the service of the

known as the Tracy properties. This
property had been overlooked by the
so-called knowing mining men, who did
not believe It was on the mother lode
and could not be developed Into a divi
dend-paying proposition. Subsequent
developments have demonstrated that
Mr. Drown has been correct In his con
clusions and from present indications
the mine will be one known the world
over as one of California's famous pro
ducers. The sulphurets are rich and
uniform, averaging about $"0 per ton
and the shaft is now being sunk on an
average of three feet per day through
rock running about $4. There are four
distinct veins running through this
property. Mr. Drown is the superin
tendent of this property and in addition
has charge of other valuable mining
properties. He represents a very large
amount of foreign capital and will start
for Europe In a short time, where he
will no doubt arrange for further de
velopments. Mr. Drown is a young
man, but the close attention he has
given to mining and the careful study
he has made of the business has made
him one of the best judges of a mining
property in the State. His advice is al
ways sought, especially in Calaveras
and Tuolumne counties, and so far his
tment has been correct. He is a
wide awake and progressive man
his sturdy and uncompromising in
ity has made him hosts of friends,
who bank on him from start to finish.
Their confidence has not been mis

statement it is a certainty that he is
correct. He is a married man and the
father of two boys, who, If they follow
in their father's footsteps, will in turn

PICKING UP
MILLIONS IN ALASKA.
"1 SCRATCHED $10,000
I WENT to Klondike on my wedding
tour, and my first housekeeping was
done In a rude log cabin by the dig
pings at the point called Forty-one
Mile. TVe were married â Clarence
and I â the very day we started for
the cold north. Did bride ever have
such a honeymoon and wife ever begin
housekeeping under such strange cir
cumstances?
Mr. Berry had been two years In
Alaska before I accompanied him. We
were engaged when he first went up
there, in 1594,- and he left his diggings
to come down here, where we were
married. I was determined that he
I net return alone, and when a
woman makes up her mind to do a
thing she usually does it. Hence, in
eiiite of all that was said, I went to
the Klondike, and I and a lady in our
party (Mrs. Lippy) were the first
women to set foot upon the frozen
ground of Dawson City.
When we arrived at Forty-One Mile
Mr. T-ierry saw that I was comfortably
located in a cabin and he went on to
American Creek. He was gone for five
weeks, and I was the most isolated
and lonesome woman in this world, I
do believe. I will never forget those
five long, draggy, dreary weeks. Not
a thing to do, nor a thing to see ex
cept snow, ice and wilderness.
Well. I began housekeeping â my first
experience. Just imagine! Every
time I wanted a little water to use In
cooking I would have to take a chunk
of ice and thaw it in a vessel on the
Btove; if the water was wanted for
drinking purposes you would have to
wait until it cooled; but that did not
take long. In fact* you would have to
be careful that the water did not solid
ify a trail-..
Then, the Alaska housekeeper never
ki owa when her work is done, for
body keeps open house or open
cabin, rather, en the Klondike. Often
times after having "cleared off" the ta
ble, five or six, and sometimes a dozen,
hungry miners would come along, and
that meant another supper and one on
a much larger scale. It w;is not an un
common occurrence for the guests for
supper to stay ail night -and have
breakfast the next morning. That was
before the shortage In provisions,
though, and I suppose things are, from
the necessities of the situation, far dif
ferent now.
From Forty-one Mile Mr. Berry and
myself went to Dawr-x-i City, a dis
tance of seventy miles. Mr. Berry
started alone In a small boat and told
me to "pack up" a; <i take the first

OUT OF THE EARTH
to get everything ready. With the as
sistance of neighbors, however, I man
aged to have everything in readiness
for the morning. Mr. Perry lefÂ£ his
small boat and took passage with me
on the steamer.
At Dawson we pitched a tent as tem
porary quarters until a cabin could be
built at our claim, which was No. 5.
Our tent was the first one ever put up
at Dawson, and, my! what a time we
had to keep from freezing- that night.
We stayed as close to the fire all day
as we could get, and at night we cov
ered ourselves, head and all. in warm
blankets, and even then it was cold.
When we" removed to our cabin it was
far from completed. It was not until
three weeks afterward that our cabin
was cozy enough to call It a home. We
then had carpets, curtains and chairs,
and there were doors and windows In
the cabin.
Then the mining began In earnest.
My work was not confined to the house
by any means. Making bread for the
miners and showing them how to do
it; preparing meals and "tending to
the house generally," were only a frac
tional part of my . experience on the
Klondike. .
I went to the diggings, too. One
thing that I was most thankful for was
the fact that in spite of the cold, the
hardships and the privations I enjoyed
most excellent health, : which ,is very
unusual for a woman in that trying
country. ' : . â 
Just think of a woman making $10,
000 by â â  scratching with a Btick =in . the
dumps; but that is what I did. In or
der to do the panning I had to thaw
the water. At first I lost a lot of valu
able gold, but soon I learned to take; it
out as well as any of the old miners.
1 put my "earnings" away in every re
ceptacle I could findâ old bottles, jelly
jars and cans. In that way I brought
mv .preceious findings home.
I had the distinction of washing the
heaviest yielding pan of the Klondike,
the sum of $596 being taken out in gold.
After thus spending the afternoon
far different from the manner in which
the housewife in civilized communities
passes her timeâ l would return to our
cabin home and prepare supper for the
cold and hungry men from the dig
gings. Think of panning diggings, pick
ing up nuggets and raking around the
dumps to an afternoon tea or a sewing
circle!

sort of occupation my housewifely cares
for the morrow were sufficient to keep
my mind occupied, so you see that, al
though it was very lonesome up there,
far, far away from friends and rela
tives, I hardly had time to be home
sick. -
But the life of the wife of the miner
on the Klondike cannot be called a very
pleasant one. But I cannot say that I
am sorry that I went; that I braved the
hardships and faced the privations.
I will not return, however, to the
Klondike. My husband goes back this
spring, but he will return here in the
fall. He will not spend another winter
there, either.
I could not mention half the people
who have asked me what I thought of
their going to Klondikeâ ladles and
gentlemen alike. I have told many la
dies what I thought and have written
many letters in answer to queries
which I receive 'almost every day from
women who seek advice about Klon
dike, as I have had the actual exper
ience that they are contemplating un
dergoing. My answer has invariably
been: "The Klondike is no place for" a
woman; stay at home."

THE OUTCASTS
OF POKER FLAT
As Mr. John Oakhurst, gambler, stepped Into the
main street of Poker Flat on the morning of the 23d
of November, 1850, he was conscious of a change In his
moral atmosphere since the preceding night. Two or
three men. conversing earnestly together, ceased as he
approached, and exchanged significant glances. There
was a Sabbath lull in the air, which. In a settlement
unused to Sabbath influences, looked ominous.
Mr. Oakhurst's calm, handsome race betrayed small
concern in these indications. Whether he was con
scious of any predisposing cause was another question.
"I reckon they're after somebody," he reflected: "likely
It's me." He returned to his pocket the handkerchief
with which he had been whipping away the red dust
of Poker Flat from his neat boots, and quietly dis
charged his mind of any further conjecture.
In point of fact. Poker Flat was -after somebody."
It had lately suffered the loss of several thousand dol
lars, two valuable horses, and a prominent citizen. It
was experiencing a spasm of virtuous reaction, quite
as lawless and ungovernable as any of the acts that
had provoked it. A secret committee had determined
to rid the town of all Improper persons. This was done
permanently in regard of two men who were then
Hanging from the boughs of a sycamore in the gulch,
and temporarily in the banishment of certain other ob
jectionable characters. I regret to say that some of
these were ladies. It is but due to the sex. however, to
state that their impropriety was professional, and it
was only in such easily established standards of cvii
that Poker Flat ventured to sit in Judgment.
i Mr. Oakhurst was right in supposing that he was in
cluded in this category. A few of the committee had
urge<i hanging him as a possible example and a pure
met.|>d of reimbursing themselves from his pockets of
the sums he had won from them. "It's agin Justice,"
said Jim Wheeler, "to let this yer young man from
Koarlng Campâ an entire strangerâ away our
money. But a crude sentiment of equity residing in
the breasts of those who had been, fortunate enough to
win from Mr. Oakhurst overruled this narrower local
prejudice.
Mr, Oakhurst received his sentence with philo
sophic calmness, none the less coolly that he was aware
of the hesitation of his Judges. He was too much of a
gambler not to accept fate. With him life was at best
an uncertain game, and he recognized the usual per
centage in favor of the dealer.
i A . bod y of armed men accompanied the deported
wickedness of Poker Flat to the outskirts of the set
tlement. Besides Mr. Oakhurst, who was known to be
a coolly desperate man, and for whose intimidation the
armed escort was intended, the expatriated party con
sisted of a young woman familiarly known .as "The
Duchess ; another who had won the title of "Mother
Bhlpton : and "Uncle Billy." a suspected sluice robber
and confirmed drunkard. The cavafcade provoked no
comments from the spectators, nor was any word ut
tered by the escort. Only when the gulch which marked
the uttermost limit of Poker Flat was reached, the
leader spoke briefly and to the point. The exiles were
forbidden to return at the peril of their lives.
As the escort disappeared their pent-up feelings
found vent In a few hysterical tears from the Duchess,
some bad language from Mother Shlpton. and a Par
thian volley of expletives from Uncle Billy. The philo
sophic Oakhurst alone remained silent. He listened
calmly to Mother Shlpton's desire to cut somebody's
heart out, to the repeated statements of the Duchess
that she would die in the road, and to the alarming
oaths that seemed to be bumped out of Uncle Billy as
he rode forward. With the easy gooJ-humor character
12V. C of . hls class, he insisted upon exchanging his own
riding horse. "Five Spot." for the sorry mule upon
which the Duchess rode. But even this act did not
draw the party into any closer sympathy. The young
woman readjusted her somewhat bedraggled plumes
with a feeble, faded coquetry: Mother Shlpton eyed the
possessor of "Five Spot" with malevolence, and Uncle
Billy Included the whole party in one sweeping anath-

was distant a day's severe travel. In that advanced
season the party soon passed out of the moist, temper
ate regions of the foothills into the dry. cold bracing
air of the Sierras. The trail was narrow and difficult.
At noon the Duchess, rolling out of her saddle upon the
ground, declared her Intention of going no farther, and
the party halted.
The spot was singularly wild and Impressive. A
wooded amphitheater, surrounded on three sides by
precipitous cliffs of naked granite, sloped gently, toward
the crest of another precipice that overlooked the val
ley. It was. undoubtedly, the most suitable spot for a
camp, had camping been advisable. But Mr. Oakhurst
knew that scarcely half the journey to Sandy Bar was
accomplished and the party was not equipped or pro
visioned for delay This fact he pointed out to his com
panions curtly with a philosophic commentary on the

and Mother Shlpton snored. Mr. Oakhurst alone re

i^Jfr;;â¢"^?^ dld . not . drlnk - Tt Interfered with a
profession "which required coolness, imp.-issiveness and
presence of mind, and, in his own language, he "couldn't
afford it. As he gazed at his recumbent fellow exiles,
the loneliness begotten of his pariah-trade, his habits of
life, his very vices, for the first time seriously op
pressed him. He bestirred himself in dusting his black
clothes, washing his hands and face, and other acts
characteristic of his studiously neat habits, and for
moment forgot his annoyance. The thought of desert
ing his weaker and more pitiable companions never per
haps occurred to him. Yet he could not help feeling the
want of that excitement which, singularly enough was
most conducive to that calm equanimity for which he
was notorious. He looked at the gloomy walls that rose
a thousand feet sheer above the circling pines around
him, at the sky ominously clouded, at the valley below
already deepening into shadow; and, doing so suddenly
he heard his own name called. '
A horseman slowly ascended Â£he trail. In the fresh
open face- of the: newcomer Mr. Oakhurst recognized'
Tom Simson, otherwise known as "The Innocent " of
Bandy Bar. Ho had met him some months before over
a "little game," and had, with perfect equanimity, won
the entire fortuneâ amounting to some forty dollarsâ
of. that guileless < youth. Alter the game was finished.
Mr. Oakhurst drew the youthful speculator behind the
door and thus addressed him: "Tummy, you
little man. but you can't gamble worm ii cent. li.m't
try It over again." He then handed him his money
tack, pushed him wntly from the roum, and so made a
devoted slave of Tom Simeon.
There was a remembrance of this In his hoyiÂ«=h and
enthusiastic greetingof Mr. < 'akhurst. He hart started,
be aafd, to go to Poker Flat to seek his fortune.
Alone?' \\o, not exactly (done; in fact fa gleple), he
had run away with Plney Woods. Didn't Mr. Oakhurst
remember Plney? She that used to wait on thÂ« table
at the Temperance House? They had been engaged a
lons time, but old Jake Woods had objected, und so
they had run away, and were going to Poker Fiat to
be married, and here they were. And they were tlrid
out. and how lucky It was they had found a place to
camp and company. All this the Innocent delivered.
rapidly, while Piney, a stout, comely damsel of IS,
emerged from behind the pine tree, where she hnd been
blushing unseen, and rode to the side of her lover.
Mr. Oakhurst seldom troubled him?. If with senti
ment, still less with propriety; but he had a vague idea
that the situation was not furtunate. He retained,
however, his presence of mind sufficiently to kl-k Uncle
Billy, who was about to say something, and Uncle Billy
was sober enough to recognize in Mr. Or.khurst's kick a
superior power that would not bear trilling. He then
endeavored to dissuade Tom Slmson from delaying fur
ther, but in vain. He even pointed out the fact tnnt
there was no provision, nor moans of making a camp.
But. unluckily, the Innocent met this objection bj as
suring the party that he was provided with an extra
mule loaded with provisions, and by the discovery of a
rude attempt at a log house near the trail. "Piney can
stay with Mrs. Oakhurst." said the Innocent, pointing
to the Duchess, "and 1 can shift f'>r ttv.
Nothing but Mr. Oakhur-st's admonishing foot saved
I'ncle Billy from bursting into a roar of laughter. As it
was. he felt compelled to retire up the canyon until he
could recover his gravity. There he confided tliÂ«s ioke
to the tall pine trees, with many slaps of oil
tortions of his face, and the usual profanity. But when
he returned to the party, he found them seated by a lire
âfor the air had grown strangely chill and the sky
overcastâ ln apparently amicable conversation. Piney
was actually talking In an impulsive, girlish fashion to
the Duchess, who was listening with an interest and
animation she had not shown for many days. The In
nocent was holding forth, apparently with equal
to Mr. Oakhurst and Mother Shipton. who was actually
relaxing into amiability. "Is this yer a d^-d p;
said Uncle Billy with toward scorn, as he surveyed the
sylvan group, the glancing firelight, and the tel
animals in the foreground. Suddenly an Idea mingled
with the alcoholic fumes that disturli.l bis brain. It
was apparently of a Jocular nature, for he. felt impelled
to slap his leg again and cram his fist Into his mouth.
As the shadows crept slowly up the mountain, a
slight breeze rocked the tops of the pine trees and
moaned through their long and gloomy aisles The
ruined cabin, patched and covered wrtn pine boughs,
was Â°et apart for the ladles. As the lovers parted, they
unaffectedly exchanged a kiss, so honest and sincere
that it might have been heard above the swaying pines
The frail Duchess and the malevolent Mother Rhipton
â were probably too stunned to rerrfftrk upon this last
evidence of simplicity, and so turned without a word to
the hut. The fire was replenished, the men lay down
before the door, and in a few minutes were asloep.
Mr. Oakhurst was a light sleeper. Toward morning
he awoke benumbed and cold. As he stirred the dying
fire, the wind, which was now blowing strongly
brought to his cheek that which caused the blood to
leave It â snow!
He started to his feet with the Intention of awak
ening the sleepers, for there was no time to lose. Hut
turning to where Uncle Billy had been lying, he found
him gone. A suspicion leaped to his brain and a curse
to his lips. He ran to the spot where the mules had
been tethered; they were no longer there. The tracks
were already fast disappearing in the snow.
The momentary excitement brought Mr. Oakhursi
back to the fire with his usual calm. He did not waken
the sleepers. The Innocent slumbered peacefully, with
a smile on his good-humored, freckled face; the virgin
Plney slept beside her frailer sisters as sweetly as
though attended by celestial guardians, and Mr. Oak
hurst, drawing his blanket over his shoulders, stroked
his mustaches and waited for the dawn. Jt came slowly
In a whirling mist of snowflakes that dazzled and con
fused the eye. What could be seen of the landscape ap
peared magically changed. He looked over the valley
and summed up the present and future In two wordsâ
"Snowed in!"
A careful inventory of the provisions, which, fortun
ately for the party, had been stored within the hut. and
co escaped the felonious fingers of Uncle Billy, disclosed
the fact that with care and prudence they might last

But when Mr. Oakhurst returned from a weary search
for the trail, he heard the sound of happy laughter
echoed from the rocks. He stopped in some alarm, and
his thoughts first naturally reverted to the whisky.
Which he had prudently cached. "And yet it don't
somehow sound like whisky," said the gambler. It was
-nil u . n , :1 he caught sight of the blazing tire through the
still blinding storm and the group around it that he
settled to the conviction that it was "square fun "
â¦ v Whether Mr. Oakhurst had cached his cards with
the whisky as something debarred the free access of
the community. I cannot Pay. It was certain that. in
Mother Shipton s words, he "didn't say cards once"
during the evening. Haply the time was beguiled by
an accordion, produced somewhat ostentatiously by
lorn Simson from his pack. Notwithstanding some dif
ficulties attending the manipulation of this Instrument
Jr iney Woods managed to pluck several reluctant melo
dies from its keys, to the accompaniment by the Inno
cent on a pair of bone castanets. But the crowning
festivity of the evening was reached in a rude camp-meet
ing hymn, which the lovers. Joining hands, sang with
great earnestness and vociferation. I fear that a cer
tain defiant tone and Covenanter's swing to its chorus
rather than any devotional quality, caused it speedily
to Infect the others, who at last Joined in the refrain:
'1 m proud to live in the service or the Lord
And I'm bound to die in his army."
The pines rocked, the storm eddied and whirled above
the miserable group, and the flames of their altar
leaped heavenward as if in token of the vow.
At midnight the storm abated, the rolling clouds
parted, and the stars glittered keenly above the sleep-
Ing camp. Mr. Oakhurst, whose professional habits
had enabled him to live on the smallest possible amount
of sleep. in dividing the watch with Tom Simson some
now managed to take upon himself the greater part of
that duty. He excused himself to the Innocent by lay
ing thut he had "often been a week without sieep."
Doing what?" asked Tom. "Poker!" replied Oakhurst
sententiously. "When a man gets a streak of luckâ
nigger luckâ he don't get tired. The luck gives in first.
Luck, continued the gambler, /reflectively, "Is a mighty
queer thing. All you know about it for certain is that
It r bound to change. And it's finding out when it's
going to change that makes you. We've had a streak
of bad luck since we left Poker Flatâ you come along
and ship you get into It, too. If you can hold your
cards right along you're all right. For." added the
gambler, with cheerful irrelevanceâ
" 'I'm proud to live In the service of the Lord,
And I'm bound to die. in his army.' "
The third day came, and the sun, looking through
the white-curtained valley, saw the outcasts divide
their slowly decreasing store of provisions for the morn-

climate that Its rays diffused a kindly warmth over the

castaways still clung. Through the marvelously clear

last, they looked from their prison door over drifted
walls of dazzling white that towered twenty feet above
their heads. It became more and more difficult to re
plenish their fires, even from the fallen trees beside
them now half hidden in the~ drifts. And vet no one
complained. The lovers turned from the dreary pros

Mr. Oakhurst settled himself coolly to the losing game
before him. The Duchess, more cheerful than she had
been, assumed the care of Piney. Only Mother Shipto'n
-once the strongest of the party-seemed to sicken and
fade. At midnight on the tenth day she called Oak
hurst to her side. "I'm going." she said, in a voice of
querulous weakness, "but don't say anything about it

to the wall, passed quietly away. .
The accordion and the bones were put aside that day
and Homer was forgotten. When the body of Mother
Bhipton had been committed to the snow, Mr. Oakhurst
took the Innocent aside, and showed him a pair of
snowshoes which he had fashioned from the old pack
paddle. "There's one chance In a hundred to save her
yet." he said, pointing to Piney; "but it's there" he
added, pointing toward Poker Flat. "If you can reach

Simson. "I'll stay here," was the curt reply.
The lovers parted with a long embrace. "You are not
going, too?" said the Duchess, as she saw Mr. Oakhurst
apparently waiting to accompany him. "As far as the

the Duchess, leaving her pallid face aflame, and her
trembling limbs rigid with amazement.

That night the storm reached its greatest fury, and,
rending- asunder the protecting pines, invaded the very
hut.
Toward morning they found themselves unable to

THE flrst record of the Vigilance
Committee of this city was the
action of Its citizens, who In July.
1849. put In prison members of a
gang of rascals and robbera
called the "Hounds. 11 This prompt ex
ample worked a good result, for for
fully a year afterward robbery or mur
der was hardly known. To my know
ledge valuable merchandise was left In
front of stores and never disturbed.
In the fall of ISSO, with the return of
disappointed gold seekers and the ad
vent of a rough element in vessels from
foreign ports, robbery and murder, the
knife and slung-shot became so com
mon that it was found necessary to or
ganize a committee of Bafety. We had
our ni^ht patrols to guard our build
ings and property against fire and rob
bery. All suspicious characters were
Stopped and examined.
Nothing serious occurred until the ar
rest of Jenkins, who was caught with
a small safe concealed in a sack. He
â¢was given a fair trial, convicted and
hanged from the rafters of the adobe
building Just outside the northwest cor
ner of Portsmouth Square. The rope
â was long, and many of the committee
had hold of it, while the balance kept
back the opposing crowd.
Finding that this committee, com
posed mostly of merchants, was not
strong enough in its organization to
stop the fires, robberies and murders,
a new and larger body was enrolled and
called the Committee of Vigilance. Thia
was in June, 1
Many suspicious characters were ar
rested and taken to the committee
on Battery, near California
street. Among the number was a man
named Stuart, who, upon his trial, con
fessed to more than one murder. For
one of these murders a certain Berdeau
In Marysville was under sentence to
be hanged. Through our committee his
life was saved. We hanged Stuart on
a derrick for small boats at the foot of
California-street wharf, then near Da
vis street. He died game, refusing to
have his black silg handkerchief put
over his face.
In August, the samÂ» year. Whittaker
and McKenzle were sentenced to be
hanged. The Sheriff and his deputies
gor Into the committee rooms and took
these prisoners to the County- Jail on
Broadway, but thoy were recaptured by
breaking open the jail doors and ta
ken back to our rooms. In less than
thirty minutes they were swinging from
the windows.
Thla vigorous action stopped crime
tn a great extent and this committee
of vigilance adjourned sine die to meet
at the call of three of the executive
committee whenever necessary.
Three taps of the bell of the Monu
mental engine house on Brenham place
was to be the signal, and It was not
given until Casey killed Jamea King of
William in
The excitement was intense and in
the crowd we had trouble to get to
gether the three members of the exe
cutive committee and the secretary.
When this was accomplished the bell
was tapped and the old committee met
in the rooms of the California Pioneers
on Washington street, opposite the
Piaza. A special room was set aside
for the officers and soon William T.
Coleman arrived and was made chair
man. Next morning headquarters were
secured in buildings on Sacramento
Btreet, near Front, and the enrollment
y,:,p started of the famous Vigilance
Committee of 1856.
Hundreds of names were signed] and
numbers issued for days, until the
membership reached nearly 4000. After
the formation of an executive com
mittee the folowing officers were
chosen: W. T. Coleman, president;
Isaac Bluxume. secretary; Charles
Doane, marshal; Colonel Olney, assist
ant marshal, and myself as chief aid.
Companies of 100 ea-ch, together with
an artillery and cavalry company, were
enrolled, and a police and detective
force was appointed. The executive
committee of selected men and the
different captains met and issued all
orders of arrest and tried all cases,
appointing attorneys to defend the
prisoners.
Numerous rooms were set aside for
the arrested, and a password, new
every day, was necessary to get in or
out of the building. At one time there
must have been 100 prisoners. Among
the number was Yankee Sullivan, who
committed suicide in his cell, and Judge

arresting officers. nnrnM Hopkins. Dr.
Beverly Cole saved Hopkins' life, and
bo Terry was not hanged. Many a
night have I stood over him and al

As the different trials progressed men
were sent out of the State in steamers,
â with the prospect of death if they re
turned, and the death sentence was
passed on Casey, Cora, Hetherington
and Brace.
Casey and Cora were in the County
Jail, where they had fled for protection,
but on the tap of the committee's
signal several thousand men formed
and marched to the Jail and surrounded
it. Resistance was useless. The pris
oners were taken to the committee's
building, and while James King's body
was beinp: tnken to the grave Casey
and Cora were hanging. Casey broke
down Just before he was hantred. and
begged and pleaded like a child to be
"Clang! Sounded the Alarm Bell and We All Ran From the
Church to Fort Gunnybags"
IN all the exciting movements of the
early '50's there was none more
striking nor dramatic than thÂ«
hanging of Casey and Cora by the
Vigilance Committee. Casey had
killed James King of William, and
Cora had murdered United States Mar
shal Richardson. The thrilling alarm
bell of the Vigilance Committee rang
out and the execution took place Just
as the funeral services of James King
of William were going on.
It was generally known that Casey
and Cora had been condemned to
death, but It was not known when the
execution was to be carried into effect.
The city was In mourning such as It
had never been before and never has
been since. With the exception of a
very few buildings that were controlled
by individuals who were favorable to
the Law and Order Party, an insigni
ficant organization that openly de
clared Itself opposed to the methods
of the Vigilance Committee, every
house displayed emblems of mourning.
The day for the funeral of James King
of William, who had been a member of
the Vigilance Committee of '51, was
set for May 22. and the place where the
services were to be held was the
church on the west side of Stockton
street, between Clay -and Sacramento.
I was among the thousands of people
gathered there to witness the funeral.
The street was crowded and all who
could be were admitted into the church
edifice. Organized bodies of men rep
saved.
A short time afterward Hetherington
and Brace were hanged on a scaffold
erected on Davis street, near Sacra
mento; and so ended the work of the
Vigilance Committee of 1856.

FRASER RIVER GOLD RUSH
THERE have been remarkable
coincidences in the various gold
mining "rushes" so far as re
late to their periodicity and re
sults. The news of the discov
ery of gold by Marshall at Coloma on
January 24, 1848, traveled to the East
very slowly.
It was just a decade of years after
ward, in May, ISSB, when the Fraser
River excitement broke out. In IMS
cam* 1 the White Pine rush, and now,
in IS9S, the Klondike fever has the
sway.
There is a great correspondence in
the relation of the three great gold
mining fevers â California, Fraser
River and the Klondike â both as to
order of time and as to circumstances.
In each instance there was the same
anxiety and ea^t-rm-ss for details, and
the same fluctuating accounts from
those who pioneered the way. There
were the same extravagant stories,
the same Incredible hardships, and,
more than all, the same Ignorance and
uncertainty concerning the region
where the gold was supposed to li.'.

therefore almost terra incognita.
The dissimilarity between the Califor
nia and Fraser River excitements
was in the ending. The golden wealth
of the California mines proved inex
haustible; that of the Fraser placers
an empty vision.
Fraser River, is the principal stream
of British Columbia, that after a flow
of 800 miles empties into the gulf of
Georgia Just north of the international
boundary. When the first news was
received in California "that rich dig
gings had been found on the bar of
the river, and that there were large
tracts of excellent placers in the up
per basin of the stream," there had
been hut one complete survey and
map made of the region north of 49
degrees between the mountains and
the sea.
The most curious of all the coinci
dences respecting Fraser River region

In line around the church. During the
time of the solemn services there was
a hush that was not broken until there
was v movement at the church door
and It became apparent that the pall
bearers were advancing with the cas
ket containing the remains of the hon
ored dead. All who could, moved to
obtain a better view.
At that very moment when thou
sands of men stood with heads bared
to show their reverence for the depart
ed, there rang out on the still air a
sound that electrified every one.
Then followed a scene I shall never
forget.
A bell rang out. deep-toned, clear.
Every one understood its meaning. It
was struck with measured blows, one
two-three â and as the echoes of the
last stroke were sounding there, in
that vast crowd, face turned to face
vith a look that was full of signifi
cance. Every man who was a member
of the Vigilance Committee knew that
it was the alarm sounded by the alarm
bell on the roof of Fort Ounnyhaes. the
headquarters of the Vigilance Commit
tee. They knew it was the call to duty.
In a moment every man who was a
member of the committee tossed his re
galia to some non-member, stewards
cast aside their wnnds and all started
on a mad run for Sacramento street.
Joining the crowd I turned into Sac
ramento street Just In time to see two
bodies drop from windows at the west
ern end of the Vigilance Committee
rooms.

coincident I te.
At the time <>f the gold discovery on
thf Fraser the territory was entirely
under the control of the Hudson Hay
Company. They hn<l th<-ir trading
posts stationed at various points in
the interior and on the seacoast. On
the lirst influx of gold-se.-kt-rs the
Governor of Vancouver Island
promptly adopted measures to secure
to the British Government a royalty
by imposing a llcnse tax on the
miivrp. and maintained th.Â» monopoly
of the Hudson Bay Company by for
bidding the Importation of goods ex
cept through the company's agencies.
Foreign shins were also forbidden to
navigate Frasor River.
The news of the gold discovery In
the north in I^> was received in Cali
fornia with n thrill that was f.-lt in
every liber of her political and indus
trial organization. In the spring,
when it was reported that rich dig
gings had been found on a bnr of
Fraser River, that the yield was In
large nuggets, and that there were
large tracts of excellent placers in
the upper basin of th<* str-am. there
was apparent foundation in experi
ence and renson for the report. The
renditions as described resemt â 'â¢â â \
those of the California gold regions.
The yield from the mines of this State
had decreased; the pioneers of the
Oolden State were of adventurous
cast: they were restless, and longed
for a change to more promising fields.
Within four nonths IS.OOO men.
nearly one-sixth of all the voters in
the State, went to Fraser River, and
many thousands of others were pre
paring for an early start. The confi
dent belief waa that "the good old
times" of '49 were to come again.
Servants threw up their positions,
farmers and miners left their valuable
properties, wages rose, houses and
land fell in value and many believed
that California would soon be left
without a tenth of her population.
All this excitement arose, too, before
any gold had been received in San
Francisco, and before there was any
direct and trustworthy evidence of the
existence of paying diggings. The re
gion, too. was comparatively distant
and inhospitable: the privations and
dangers were only a little less than

voyagers up the Yukon.

bodies were dangling: from ropes each

At Davis street was lined up a com
pany of cavalry that covered not only
that street but both sides of Drumm
street, north and south of Sacramento,
and through that line of uniformed
men in black suits and black glazed caps
and with drawn swords none were al
lowed to pass unless provided with the
countersign. Within these lines were
armed sentries and patrols of infantry,
while from behind the piles of sand
baps that formed the barricade in front
of the fort frowned six-pounders loaded
to the muzzle with canister. On the
roof of the fort was an armed body of
men and one with smoking linstock
In hand stood by a swivel six-pounder
that commanded the approach to the
fort from three sides.
Fronting the fort was a vacant lot
used as a city dumping place. Ranged
in front of this and facing the fort was
a company of infantry, while on Da
vis, Clay and Prumm streets were dis
tributed infantry, so that these armed
men formed a hollow square, while on
the Drumm-street side was a troop of
cavalry. This distribution of force show
ed that while the mass of the people
were at the funeral service the vigilance
minute men had been quickly sum
moned and stationed and the mandate
of the executive council as to the death
penalty was carried out. The time and
occasion were chosen so that at the mo

few people present.
ERNEST C. STOCK.
Most of the adventurers outfitted at
Victoria with provision*, canoes and
mining Implements. From there,
even in fo frail a bark as a canoe,
containing three, four or five men,
they set sail for Fraser River, which
they ascended to one of the furts, and
there, 'disemtiarkinsr, turned their
faces toward the land of promise,
\ with their stores, ar.d often
hiring men to carry th"ir canoes in
which to cross the several lakes and
streams that interposed on their
weary Journey. Often there were nu
merous portages to be made, over deep
s! us In freestng cold weather.
These and numerous other difficulties
were encountered* in a pleasing hope,
which often turned to despair.
Not one man in a hundred, after
reaching the sold region, realized his
tatlons. The smallest number
remained in the country, while the
great majority, disappointed, dis
heartewed and impoverished, returned
to California.

FAMOUS GOLD RUSHES.
T "HOUGH the people of all na
tions, from the earliest times,
have been determined in their
F^-arch for the precious metal,
th^ pold rush, as we term It now
adays, is but a comparatively modern
institution. The ancients were content
to take life more easily and to
sather in the pold when It came to
them, rather than leave their happy
homes to endure privation In the search
of it. This was a task which the Ro
mans left to the barbarians of Walea
ana i-iungary, tnougn tnere is one rec
ord of a search for gold which history
has immortalized. This is the cele
brated voyage of Jason and the Argo
nauts, in pursuit of the gold which ru
mor told them was to be found in the
Caucasus.
In more modern time's the world had
to depend largely for its supply upon
Africa and India, whence the precious
metal dribbled in small quantities, its
source being haidly ever traceable.
But when the Spanish conquest of
South America opened this part of the
world to European commerce, Peru and
Bolivia, with their slave-worked
mines, became the chief contributors
to the world's supply, and in later years
the L'ral Mountains in Russia yielded
valuable returns of go-Id.
However, though all these mines
must, at one tini" or another, have been
discovered accidentally, nothing like a
rush of miners ever occurred. For one
thing the old mints, especially those
controlled by Russia and Spain, were
always proprietary affairs, and these
nations would no more have dreamed
of sharing the spoil with strangers
than they would of abandoning their
claim to the land. Another great dif
ficulty was the lack of communication.
The gold mines in Peru were worked
for many generations before the rest of
Europe knew aught of the matter, and
Spanish secrets were only disclosed by
the rough-and-ready methods of Drake
and his fellow-adventurers, who won
their gold and silver by the simple
process of capturing treasure-laden
galleons. If Pizarro's lieutenant, Orel
lana, had ever really discovered the
mythical El Dorado, a country of fab
ulous wealth, supposed to lie some
where between the Orinoco and Amazon
Rivers, the future of South America
mifccl.t have been changed, for the rush
of Northern adventurers would doubt
less have compelled even the close-fist
ed Spaniard to yield a portion of his
jealously guarded territory.
When the rush to San Francisco In
search of the new El Dorado set in. the
Australian Government â the place was
then but a crown colony â was sorely
perplexed. The land was but thinly
peopled at the best, the majority of the
Inhabitants were convicts, and with
such a lodestar as California shining
in the east, it seemed probable that the
whole of the free working population
would desert in a body to California.
As a matter of fact, many did make
the voyage to the Golden State, and
one o-f these adventurous miners, a Mr.
Hargraves, was immediately struck by
the close resemblance between the
placers of California and the ranges
of his native colony. New South Wales.
So close was the resemblance that he
went back to Australia with the fixed
assurance that he would find gold.
He marched straight to a spot on
the Turon, an insignificant creek near
Rnthurst. and there the very first basin
which he washed yielded several small
nuggets. This was really the origin of
the great Australian gold rush. for.
public attention once attracted to the
subject, gold was found in erreat quan
tities all through Xew p. ruth Wales
and Victoria. Soon there was a return
rush from California. Australians who
had been tempted to these shores has
tened back to their own country, and
many Californians Joined them, help
ing in a few years to build up cities
like Melbourne and Ballarat. and to
convert a sparsely populated sheep run
into a wealthy and self-governing col-
ony.
There have also been gold rushes,
though on a smaller scale, to the north
ern territory of Australia, a country
almost tropical in its character, whilst
even New Guinea has been invaded by
the seekers for easily gotten wealth.
No doubt there is plenty of gold in
New Guinea, but there are also sav
ages of the mr?st ferocious character.
to say nothing of malaria and divers
other diseases. The result is that,
though many miners have gone into
New Guinea, but few have come out
of it. and the gold yield from this un
explored country has not greatly add
ed to the statistical returns.
The southern portim of Africa, be
inp temperate in climate and within
easy reach of Europe, has also attract
ed many diggers. Gold has been
found all thmugh the country, and the
Transvaal has proved especially rich,
F" that thÂ» mines around Johannes
burp are famous throughout the world.
The rush of cold seekers has swamped
the placid abode of the T?opr farmers,
and President K^ucrpr and his conserv
ative followers, despite their strenuous
resistance, are threatened with being
overrun by the more vigorous Uitland
ers.

IS ALASKA A GOOD COUNTRYâ
For Women
TO STAY AWAY FROM?
By Mrs. John A. Logan.
SO large a percentage of the peo
ple bound for Alaska are of the
gentler and physically weaker
sex that the question naturally
arises in the mind of one deeply
Interested in woman's welfare,
"Is Alaska a desirable country for
women?"
Having been asked for my opinion
on this subject, which Is one that grows
In Importance as the number of women
pioneers to that inhospitable country-
Increases, I am constrained to give a
conservative reply. From all that I
have been able to learn of existing con
ditions in the far north, I am led to the
ooncluslon that Alaska at the present
time is an excellent country for women
â to Btay away from.
Not alone do women In that region
have to encounter physical hardships
;of almost every description in their
eager rush to keep pace with men in
search of gold, and endure the rigors
of a climate that tests the endurance of
the hardiest man; unless accompanied
by husbands to protect them, they are
compelled to sacrifice much of the dig
; nity â  and reserve that are woman's
I natural birthright, and certainly her
chief charm. The method of travel over
j land Is now such that women should
: think very seriously before undertak
:ing it. In every way it is extremely
' trying upon the physique of men.
! What must It be for women? ; The
* mere matter of moneyed gain should
| not, it sems to me,Â»so enthuse them as
:to make < them lose sight of graver
things at stake.
I would not be understood as taking
a gloomy view of the Alaska question.
'It is undoubtedly a most wonderful
| country so far as its mineral riches are
I concerned, but there are few women
i who can encounter the privations and
) primitive conditions there without seri
i ously impairing their health. Even
those who go as companions to their
i husbands and In their watchful care
run a great physical risk. And yet I
am one who holds to the good, old
ifashioned belief that a woman should,
[if need be, follow her husband to {the
â nttermost ends of the earth. To me
jiAJaska certainly U typical of th*
IN compliance with the roquet of a friend of mine, who
wrote me fronf the East. 1 called on good-natured, garÂ»
rulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired after ray friend's
friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to do. and I here
unto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that
"Leonidas W." Smiley is a myth; that my friend never
knew such a persona**: an 1 that he only conjectured that If I
asked old Wheeler about him it would remind hlru of his in
famous "Jim- Smiley, and he would go to wort and bore me
to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long
and es tedious as it would be uselaM to me. If that was the
design it succeeded.
I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room
Btove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of
Angels, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and
had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon
his tranquil countenance. He roused up, *.n(3 gave me good
day. I told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make
some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood
named Leonidas W. Smileyâ Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young
minister of the Gospel, who he had hoard was nt one time a
resilient of Angels Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could
tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would
feel under many obligations to him.
Simon Wheeler backed me Into a corner and blockaded me
there with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the mo
notonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the
gently flowing koy to which he tur.ed his initial sentence, ho
never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all
through the Interminable narrative there ran a vein of impres
sive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that
bo far from his imagining that thf>re was anything ridiculous or
funny ab"Ut his story, he- regarded it as a really important
matter, an.l admired its two heroes as iru*n of transcendent
genius in finesse. I let him go on In his own way, and never
interrupted him once.
"Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Leâ well, there was a fel

MIKING first brought California Into prominence
as the El Dorado of the West. The foundations
of the State -were laid with the beginning of the
golden flood which poured from almost every
canyon through the length and breadth of the
mighty SJerrra Xevadas.
Of necessity the days of the rich surface placers were
brief, Men were at first lacking In experience, but little
by little as the most profitable bars were worked over
they began to search for the original source of the gold.
In the placers gold had often been found with pieces of
quartz adhering, and the attention was consequently
directed to the veins which thickly intersected the coun
try. 'While these veins were found to contain gold over
a great area of the Sierra Nevada foothills, it was soon
recognized that there was one remarkable mineral zone
stretching* from Mariposa County northward.
For over a hundred miles the prospector traced this
remarkable lode, sometimes able to walk on its crop
pings for miles at a stretch. For long distances the
fissure occupied by the most Important vein had the
appearance of being continuous, and while contracting
here and there was characterized at certain spots by
great "blowouts" of Quarts, affecting even the topog
raphy of the country. The greatest body of quartz ex
posed above ground Is found on the Mariposa grant in
Mariposa County. It rises SO feet with a length of 100 and
a thickness at the base of 20 feet. It Is known as the
May Rock and presents a most striking appearance.
Carson Hill, Quartz Mountain and other eminences are
due to the aggregation of quartz veins. The lode does
not always occur as one great vein, for through much of
Its length It consists of numerous veins scattered Jn a
belt of black slate, through which course dikes of green
stone parallel to the stratification. Thus It has happened
that while the whole western slope of the Sierra Nevadas
Is more or less mineralized, the geological structure Is
â¢ euch that it has favored greater development of fissures
and subsequent Quartz veins along a comparatively
narrow line.
Much has been said about the depth to which thÂ«
gold ores of California extend. The question arises In
every new camp. Do the veins go down? What reason
have we to doubt that they go down? The veins cer
tainly go down, and If rich on the surface experience of
many years has shown that they are not likely to grow
poorer in depth.
world's "Jumplng-off place," the most
cheerless and unsuitable spot that a
woman could select for even a tem
porary abiding place.
But Alaska Is not Irreclaimable,
though its climate may be, and the
time may come, and that Boon, when
capital and civilization will have made
it a habitable land for women. I
would have the way paved for them.
It does not seem to me either safe or
wise for women to emigrate beyond the
ordinary comforts of life. When the
capitalists have made improvements
there; when the civil engineers have
brought their skill to bear upon the
rugged and dangerous surface of that
far-off country; when physicians are at
hand in case of illness, and houses are
built that are suitable for women to
live in: when there is nothing left to
contend with but the climate â and that
will always be quite enoughâ then
Alaska will be a reasonably habitable
place for women.
For the women who have the cour
age requisite to take such chances as
now present themselves in Alaska, I
have much respect. Fortitude and
bravery are always admirable. But
one may be pardoned for questioning
the judgment of even the brave. Min
ing is an alluring industry, but I have
a theory that for every dollar taken
out of the earth some one had to put
one hundred cents in.
Women pioneers should bear in mind
that vastly different conditions prevail
between the gold fever of '49 and this
of '98. Women were not only in better
physical condition than now, owing to
the greater simplicity of their lives,
but In coming to California they en
tered what was a veritable paradise.
They could live in a cloth tent nine
months of the year and at the door
could be grown almost anything they
desired to plant, be it tree, flower or
vegetable. California's welcome to
woman was a smiling and propitious
one. Alaska's is, to say the least, de
cidedly repelling.

THE MOTHER LODE OF CALIFORNIAâ By HAROLD W. FAIRBANKS.
HOW TO OUTFIT FOR ALASKA.
I MADE a prospecting trip through
Alaska last year and had the usual
rough experiences of a prospector in
the far north. All you people who
are figuring on going there this year
have had all aorta of advice thrust
upon -you by all sorts of people,
chiefly by those who have gained all
their Information from books and papers.
I am going to tell you what a year's
rough experience taught me were the
absolute necessaries there, the cheapest
cost and how best to prepare for the
trip. It's a hard, trip at the best, and
you will find that practical advice will be
of inestimable service to you.
The usual estimates are made upon the
basis of the expenditure of sums of
money ranging from $300 to $1000. These
of course are all very well for those who
have the money to lay out in such a man
ner. But the greater share of the men
who will set out for Alaska this spring
will doubtless be of limited means, who
are compelled to make every dollar go aa
far as possible. .
The llrst and most requisite is, of
course, food. For a year's supply the fol
lowing will fill the bill. It should be
stated that the prices and goods are the
actual ones charged and supplied by a
downtown retail store and can be dupli
cated at any time: ..

asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something
of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards'
start, and then pass her under way: but always at the fag end
of the race, she'd get excited and desperate like, and come ca
vorthig and straddling up, and scattering her legs around lim-

and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as
near as you could cipher it down.
"And he had a little small bull pup. that to look at him
you'd think he warn't worth a cent but to set around and look
ornery and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon
as money was up on him he was a different dog; his under
jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of a steamboat, and
his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. And a
dog might tackle him and bullyrag him, and bite him, and
throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew
Jacksonâ which was the name of the pupâ Andrew Jackson
would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't ex
pected nothing elseâ and the bets being doubled and doubled on
the other side all the time, till the money was all up: and then
all of a sudden he would prab that other dog jest by the jint of
his hind leg and freeze to itâ not chaw, you understand, but
only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if
It was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup
till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, be
cause they'd been Pawed off in a circular saw, and when the
thing had gono along far enough and the money was all up,
and he come to make a snatoh for his pet holt, he see in a min
ute how he'd been Imposed upon, and how the other dog sorter
had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and
then he looked sorter discouraged like, and didn't try no more
to win the fight, so he get shucked out bad. He gave Smiley
a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was his
fault, for putting up a dog that didn't have no hind legs for
him to take holt of. which was his main dependence in a fight,
and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was
a good pup, that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a
name for himself if he'd lived, for the stuff was In him and he
had geniusâ l know it, because he hadn't no opportunities to
M't:tk of. and it ilon't stand to r< â â is.m that a dog could make
such a fight as he couKl under them circumstances if he hadn't
no talent. It always rnakÂ«;s me f. el sorry when I think of that
last fiÃht of his'n and the way it turned out.
'â Well, thtsh-yer Smiley had rat-terriers, and chicken cocks,
ni-eats and all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest,
and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd
match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him kJase,
lid he caliated to educate him; and so he ne*ev aone
g for three months but set In his back yard and learn
that frog to jump. And you bet he did learn him. too. He'd
give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see
[rog turning in the air like a doughnutâ see him turn one

down fiat-footed and all right, iik-- a cat. He pot him up so in
the matter of ketching flies, and kept him in practice so con-
That he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see
him. - :d all a frog wanted was education, and he
most anythingâ and I believe him. Why, I've seen
him set Danl Webster down on this floorâ Dan'l Webster was
me of the frogâ and sing out. 'F!irs. Dan'l, flies!' and
â¢ r*n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a

As for clothing, there is an equally

one respect, however, they are nearly

less expensive furs. These articles are
of course all very well in their way. and

For camp outfit and tools the estimate
is made on the supposition that two men
go together. That is the only correct
way to do. Very little more is required
for two than for one, and there are so '
many things that require two sets of
hands that the traveler should in the
first place select a partner of congenial
tastes and one with whom he ia measur
ably certain to agree and get along with
out disputing. But one thing should be
borne in mind. No matter how many
may elect at the outset to go In a' single
party, the out -Us should always be pre
pared in sets of two. Provisions, tools,
etc., should all' be arranged in that way,
giving each two men a complete outfit.
Then when parties break up. as all com
prising more than two men are certain
to do sooner or later, there will be no
difficulty. In dividing supplies and tools.
â¢â¢Well. Smiley kep' the beast In a little lattice box. andhe
used to fetch him down town sometimes ana lay for a bet. One
day a feller-a stranger in camp, he wasâ come acrost him wltn
his box, and says:
" "What might it be that you've got in that box?'
"And Smiley says, sorter Indifferent like, 'It might be a
parrot, or It might be a canary, maybe, but It am tâ it s
only jusv a frog."
"And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned
it round, this way and that, and says, 'll'mâ so us. >\eU,
what's he good for?'
" < WÂ«p> < Smiley says, easy and careless, 'he's good enough
for one thing. I Bhould judgeâ he can outjump any frog In Cala
veras county. 1
"The feller took the box again, and took another long, par
ticular look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliber
ate. 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no pints about that frog that's
any better'n any other frog.'
" "Maybe you don't.' Smiley says. 'Maybe you understand
frogs and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had
'experience, and maybe you ain't only an amature. as It were.
Anyways. I've got my opinion and I'll resk forty dollars that
he can outjump any frog In Calaveras county.'
" 'And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad
like. 'Well. I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog;
but if I had a frog I'd bet you.'
"And then Smiley says, "That's all rishtâ that's all rightâ
if you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.' And
so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along
with Smiley's, and set down to wait.
â¢S . he sot there a good while thinking and thinking to his
eelf, and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open
and took a teaspoon and filled him fuil of quail shotâ filled him
pretty near up to his chinâ and set him on the floor. Smiley he
went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long
time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and
give him to'thlÃ feller, and says:
"Now, if you're ready, set him along-side of Dan'l. with his
forepaws just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give tne word.' Then
he says, 'Oneâ twoâ threeâ git!' and him and the feller touched
up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively,
but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shouldersâ soâ like a
Frenchman, but it warn't no use â he couldn't budge; he was
planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no more stir than
if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and
he was disgusted, too, but he didn't have no idea what the
matter was. of course.
"The feller took the money and started away; and when he
was going out the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his
shoulderâ soâ at Dan'l, any says again, very deliberate, 'Well,'
he says, 'I don't see no pints about that frog that's any bet
ter'n any other frog.'
"Smiley, he stood scratching his head and looking down at
Dan'l a long time, and at last he says, 'I do wonder what in the
nation that frog throwed off forâ l wonder if there ain't some
thing the matter with himâ he 'penrs to look mighty baggy.'
And he ketched Dan'l by the nap of the necic and hefted him,
and says, 'Why, blame my cats if he don't weigh five pound!'
and turned him upside riown and he belched out a double hand
ful of shot. And then he see how it was. and he was the mad
dest man â he set that frog down and took out after that feller,
but lie never ketched him. And '
[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front
yard, and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me
as he moved away, he said: "Just stay where you are, strang
er, an<l rest easy â I ain't going to be gone a second."
But, by your leave. I did not think that a continuation of the
history of the enterprising vagabond "Jim" Smiley would be
lik'ly to afford me much information concerning the Rev.
"I-.eonM.-is W. " Smiley, and so I started away.
At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he
buttonholed me and recommenced:
"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that
didn't have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner,
and "
However, larking both time and inclination, I did not wait
to'hear about the aillicted cow, but took my leave.
that now some of the mines of Amador County are down
more than 2000 feet without any apparent weakening of
the veins, it must be appreciated on what an enormous
scale these gold deposits were formed.
The system of veins constituting the mother lode was
formed subsequent to the folding and upheaval of the
slates, and subsequent also to the Intrusion of the erup
tive rocks, so that they have been little disturbed and
faulted and are easily followed.
The ore of the veins constituting the mother lode is
generally quite simple. Those ores in which copper,
silver and gold are mixed, and which are so difficult to
work and so generally asociated together, especially in
the granite regions of the State, are not found in any
quantity along the mother lode. Here, as in all other
regions, the ores are oxidized down to the water level,
but, in marked distinction to the veins in the granite,
they still carry below the line of oxidation a large
amount of free gold. When combined the gold is almost
always associated with iron pyrites, from which it is ex
tracted with comparative ease.
Much has been said about the wall rocks of the
mother lode and its richness ascribed to their peculiar
character. A careful study of the lode has convinced me
that no combination of wall rocks will insure a rich vein.
It does not seem reasonable that the gold should have
been derived from the walls, for the mines are equally
rich whether in slate or at the contact of slate with
greenstone. Good mines as well as poor ones can be
round under any of these conditions. It seems more
reasonable to believe that the deposition of the metallic
particles is dependent more upon chemical reactions of a
certain kind. Of two veins lying side by side in the same
mine one may be barren and the other constitnte the
pay rock. The rock forming the walls upon the surface
or at any depth which can be reached is no indication
of the nature of the deep-seated rocks from which the
hot waters abstracted their mineral contents. The
numerous dikes of diabase or greenstone so character
istic of the mother lode have given opportunity for the
formation of extensive and well-defined fissures, and this
I believe has been the chief part played by them.
The mother lode of California will probably never be
equalled in the world. While the great mines now open
are gradually penetrating deeper Into the earth without
diminution of- their output, new and now hidden ore
bodies will continue to be found and the product of gold
Increased for years to come. The permanency of the
lode and the ability to work Its low-grade ores have both
been fully vindicated.

MILLIONS FOR MERCHANTS
In
THE KLONDIKE RUSH.
By Louis Sloss.
AS the season advances, the In
terest in Alaska becomes al
most dally more intensified. I
apprehend a tremendous in
crease of trade throughout this
city and the entire West dur
ing the coming months.^ The .traffic
will undoubtedly be so great that trans
portation hither by land and sea will
tax both ships and railroads to their
utmost carrying capacity. It is, of
course, impossible to say how long
the excitement will remain at fever
heat. The eyes of the world are turned
upon Alaska, and although many of
the gold hunters may fail, their mis
fortune will not deter others from
making .the same attempt. Should 75,
000 out of every 100,000 gold seekers ba
disappointed in their dreams, those who
follow in their footsteps will cherish the
belief that they will be numbered
among the lucky 25,000. Hope springs
eternal In the miner^ breast.
I am told by those who claim to know
whereof they speak that the emigra
tion from England alone will reach the
100,000 mark. Our firm has received
hundreds cf letters of urgent inquiry
from France, Japan and many other
foreign countries, showing that the in
terest is so widespread it has practi
cally encircled the globe. The benefit
to California will be Inestimable.
Alaska produces gold, but its soil is
barren. The thousands upon thou
sands of persons going there must be
provided with the food necessaries of
life, which this State will be called upon
to furnish. Thus Alaska gold will come
to us in payment for the numberless
tons of supplies which this country will
furnish to the prospectors.
We are now preparing to run all our
river boats up the Yukon and will add
four fast express boats, besides launch-
Ing a fine Bteel steamer of 2500 tons
burden, accommodating 260 first-class
passengers.
There Is every indication that the
rush to Alaska from Australia and New
Zealand will be extremely great, but
the class of gold seekers from these
quarters will be of a less mixed charao

FOR SILVER
AMERIGO VESPUCCI did not
discover America. Consequent
ly it was named after him.
James Finney or "Old Virginia"
and Henry Thomas Paige
Comstock. or "Old Pancake,"
had nothing to do with the discovery
of the greatest of silver mines; there
fore their names as applied to the
Comstock lode and Virginia City have
become world-famous.
The thing in discoveries is to know
Just when not to make them.
We Comstockers are not exactly
proud of our godfathers. In strict
confidence, be it said that Old Vir
ginia was a bibulous, disreputable,
Jolly old teamster, who smashed a bot
tle of whisky over the sage-brush land
one night and between hiccoughs de
clared. "I baptize this ground Virginia
Town." As to Comstock. shocking to
relate, he Inaugurated the .meat game
of "freeze out," with which reprehen
sible practice Comstockers have been
associated ever s i
It was this way. Two miners who
had edge.] further and further â¢
Ward â¢ ervllle and the
other great gold placers of California,
came at last up Carson and Washoe â
then Wassauâ valleys. Tiny got to
Dayton, whi< h has been variously
known as Nevada City, Mineral
Rapids. Chinatown and Johntown.
And tliey worked their way up the
canyons, following trie elusive gold
which crew scarcer and rated
in value as they neared the mountain
tops. Naturally, any comstock miner
to-day could have told these ignoram
uses why. Pimply because the per
centage of silver In the ore was in
creasing and increasing till the bank
ers in Placerville, who used to pay Ne
vada miners $16 an ounce, would pay
only 51".
It makes a pious Comstocker stand
aghast to read hew the miners of old
blasphemed the silver god we Nevad
ans worship so devoutly. They swore
at the unknown metal that cl
their sluice boxes. They called It
"bogus stuff." "accursed base metal."
They hurled it down the echoing
canyons, swearing shockingly and sav
agely just because silver wasn't
And they capped the climax to their
stupidity by actually locating our
Ophir mine, the north end of that
marvelous winding ribbon of richest
silver which â¢ bout Vir
ginia City and Gold Kill, as a gold
placer claim!
I wonder that Nature didn't shrug
those powerful shoulders of hers, the
Washoe Mountains, and so bury all
Nevada's third of a billion of silver
dollars where these fools of fortune
might never profit by it. And where
â would Fair have been then, and Mac
kay. and Flood, and O'Brien, and Sha
ron, and Jones and the lesser million
aires â ar.d San Francisco itself?
But, fortunately. Nature was pa
tient. She's a mother herself, and
has all a mother's fertility in excuses
for her offspring.
So these two miners, whose names
â weren't < >!d Virginia and Comstpck.
located their claim in . and
then Comstock came galloping down
the ridge on his old mustang, his long
letrs brushing the sapebrui
rode. He â well. Godfather Comstock
â¢was rather bombastic in speech, and,
alas! that I should say it. he was ab
surdly ignorant and impudent, and he
actually bluffed the two miners into
' giving him a quarter interest in their
claim. Then he quietly jogged on
along the divide and down th-_
narrow Oold Hill and good naturedly
gave Old Virginia his mustang
token of good will, you know. All he
esked in exchange was ,-i worthless
one-tenth interest his old partner held
in that barren piece of sagebrush land
upon the ridge which had been used
as a stock rav.ge. What did Old Vir
ginia want of that desolate piece of
desolate Nevada?
Tf things that are equal to the same
thing are equal to each other, the
value of that old mustang should be
weighed against a palace in London
and another i:i Paris; a telegraph com
pany or two, a railroad line, a whole
â t of San Francisco, and the most
beautiful houses therein, and jewels,
gowns and expensive feminine f
without number. And still old Com-
Stock's mustang would go down, down,
while the accumulated wealth of half
a dozÂ«n of the greatest fir.;
geniuses of the world has known would
be lifted heavenward.
But to return to our godfathers. Any
Comstocker would have preferred the
Grouch brothers; those heroic, intelli
gent, pioneer martyrs who really dis
covered the gr< and died, one
of blood poisoning in that rude cabin
of unhewn stones at the mouth of
American Flat Ravine, and the other
from the effects of that t'-rrible two
â weeks' journey over the Sierras in the
dead of winter, a hundred miles from
the last cabin in Nevada to the first
one in California.
But godfathers, like other fathers,

are not a matter of choice. And its
patrons being what they -were, what
can you expect of a town?
We have done some queer thlners, up
there on the side of Mount Davidson
!n Nevada. 6000 feet nfcove the level of
the sea. Inthoseold day:; when we had
outgrown our antlsllver stupidity and
no mure sought for paltry gold placer*
while ten feet below Belcher, Crown
Point and Yellow Jacket lay a rich
mass of solid quartz; in those freez
ing winters when we crept into tun
nels and dwelt there to escape the
Washoe zephyrs that tore, shrieking,
down the canyons, and the snow that
shrouded the town in white, Virginia
City was made up of frame shanties
pitched together as if by accident:
tents of canvas, of blankets, of brush,
of potato sacks, and old shirts, with
empty whisky barrels for chimneys;
smoking hovels of mud and si :
coyote holes in the hillsides forcibly
seized by men; pits ar.d shanties, with
smoke issuing from every crevice;
piles of goods and rubbish on craggy
points, in the hollows, on the rocks, in
the mud. on the snow â everywhere â
scattered broadcast in pellmell con
rusion, as if the clouds had suddenly
burst ovei I lown the
dregs of all the flimsy, rickety, filthy
novels and rubbish of merchan
dise that had ever undergone the pro
cess of evaporation from the earth
since the days of Noah. The intervals
of space, which may or may not have
been streets, were dotted ov.-r with
human beings of such sort, variety and
numbers that the famous anthills of
Africa were as nothing in comparison.
: y that they wore rough, muddy,
unkempt, and unwashed would be but
faintly expressive of their actual ap
pearance; they seemed to have caught
the diabolical tint and grime of the
whole place.
It must be admitted that we were
: men from Bodie" and "Tomb
stone terrors" in those days. We lolled
on gambling tables and in the saloons â
which, like the poor, we still have with
vs â and we swaggered and bullied and
murdered and robbed in our frank,
simple Comstock fashion. We hired
ourselves at $10 a day as "'fighting
men." and. dressed as miners, we
stepped on the cage and went under
ground to meet others like up:
down in the hot, dark, moist drifts we
fought like subterranean monsters for
the DOBB4 BSion of a mine. Our judges â
oh. our judges were so corrupt that
nine-tenths of the voting population of
the State (and everybody knows we
Nevadans are not prudes!) signed a pe
tition asking all Judges to resign.
Yes, it's all true. But look at the
other side of the account. Your Cali
fornia miner knew not one-thousandth
of the danger, the privation, that we
suffered. He â washed out his pan of
rock on the borders of a limpid stream
in a climate that made out-door living
delightful. We had to blast and drill
and burrow; to work nearly naked in a
temperature of 175 degrees at times.
We went mad from the heat; we lost
our lives from fire, from water, from
falling, from horrible accidents to
machinery. We Starved, we Btlfled. We
spent our best years more than half a
mile below the surface of the earth. If
r>ur faults were great what adjective
will you use to describe our virtues?
The Comstock h;<s produced such
heroes as the world has not known
elsewhere. It has given birth and op
portunity to men of extraordnary
genius. We have taught the world
how to construct Comstork pumps that
lift 1.000.000 gallons of water a day;
ho-,v to build V flumes and carry water
twenty-five miles ncrosÂ« thirteen steep
gulches, every curve and every angle
of the road mapped and measured; we
hav> shown you how to dig a tunnel
more than six miles long, half a mile
below the earth's surface, and while
the famous Freiburg tunnel was ad
vancing twenty-six feet a month, our
Sutro tunnel went ahead one hundred
and five feet; we originated Hie most
marvelous system of timbering: we
built a vast underground city and peo
it with thousands of miners.
Everything we needed we had to in
vent. The world has never encountered
such difficulties before: bur we sur
mounted them. "Th^ Comatock system
of working ore bodies could no more
be improved upon," said a scientific en
gineer, "than the cells of a honey-bee."
We had to have the best, and if the
best that existed was not rood enough.
we Invented a better. 'Ry^the magic of
wealth allied to intellect we changed
tho old arrastra into a gigantic mill,
the thunder of whose crashing stamps
once filled the town with its noisy clat
ter.
Why, B year of Nevada life thnn was
equal to ten years of life elsewhere, in
opportunity for development, for
growth. Before the railroad was built
we spread blankets before the pack
burros feet that he might not sink into
the snow. We built roads that are un
rivaled in picturesqueness by the most
famous roads in the old world. The
tale can never be fully told of the

giants who wrought in those
bonanza days.
Of course we were extravagant.
When we had money we spent it roy
ally. Why, San Francisco, half your
young men were directly or indirectly
supported by our mines. We used to
pay a dollar a pound for butter, for hay
$100 a ton. We paid our cooks $100 a
month. Our shovels cost $9 apiece. We
paid $1 a pound for freight. The best
your markets could produce was sent
up over the mountains and that crook
ed little railway to Virginia City. We
spent ten millions in litigation. It cost
us three-quarters of a million monthly
to pay wages in the mines. Our 20,000
people spent $900,000 a year for beer. It
took 61.200 pounds of quicksilver a
month for use in our mills. Two million
dollars was spent that Comstockers
might drink mountain water that Is the
purest, the sweetest draught that has
ever quenched man's thirst. We used
80.000,000 feet of lumber a year in tim
bering our mines. Once in 18fi3 we made
the trip between Sacramento and Vir
ginia City by stage in twelve hours and
twenty-three minutes. Steam and iron
do not accomplish as much nowadays,
over the Fame route.
But everybody was a millionaire, or
expected to be one. in those days. All
one had to do was to buy a mine, like
Con. Virginia say. The Big Bonanza
could have been nought for $40,000, but
it took nearly $mn.oorÂ». in three years
it produced ?10f..000.000. Or if you
hadn't quite $100. noa to invest, it was
almost as profitable and ten times as
Interesting to buy Crown Point at $2 a
share and watch it sail up to $1^2"; or
Belcher at $1 CO a share and sell at
11525 a share.
Silver was king In those days when
the heart of the Comstock was struck,
and a cubic chamber ten feet on edge
was exposed, glittering with stephanite,
with the finest chlorides and the richest
black snlphurets.
"The pcene within this Imperial treas
ure house was a stirring sight. Cribs
of timber were piled in successive
stages from basement to dome, 400 feet
â -. and everywhere were men at
work in changing shifts, descending
and aso-nding in the crowded cacr-'?.
clambering up to their assigned stopes
with swinging lanterns or flickering
candles, picking and drilling the crum
bling ore or pushing lines of loaded
cars to the stations on the shaft.
Flashes of explodiner powder were blaz
ing from the rent faces of the stopes;
- ..f gas and smoke filled the con
necting drifts: muffled roars echoed
along the dark galleries; and at nil
hours a hail of rock fragments might
be heard rattling on the floor of a level
and massive lumps of ore falling heav
ily on th<> slanting pile at the foot of
th*" 1 breast.*"
The total valuation of nil thÂ» mines
on the Comstock lode at that time was
nearly $400,000,000.
Now â well, now the Comstock Is In
borrasca. But the ppirit of the Com

that forty years ago the "bears" de

GOLD YIELD
of the
PACIFIC COAST.
By Thomas Price.
IT is estimated that at the time of the
discovery of kolu in California, on
January M, IS4S. the total gold avail
able in the whole world was not
more than five thousand millions of
dollars.
In the sixteenth century, from 1453 to
1600, the gross gold product for tho 103
years amounted to $601^93,337, which is
an annual production of $4 ,64."., 307.
During the seventeenth century the to
tal gold product of the whole world was
$606,314,508, an average of $6,063,000 per an-
num.
In ' the eighteenth century the gold
product was $1,262,800,400, the annual
average being f12.62fc.0C4.
In the nineteenth century, from liOl to
the end of 1547, the annual average pro
duction of gold in the whole world was a
little over $11,000,000. From 1543 to 1860
Inclusive the annual gold production for
the whole world averaged the enormous
total of in round numbers. $134,000,000.
During this same period the average an
nual production of California was not
less than $61,000,000.
Up to the year :â â¢ the gross gold prod
uct of California was fully $1,400,000,000.
being an average annual production of
$28 000.000 since the discovery of gold In
this State in IS4S. ;*./â :. - ... ,
.The maximum gold yield In California
for any one year was $50,000.000, and the
minimum $11,000,000, this decline follow
ing on the cessation of hydraulic mining.
During the past four years, however,
under the wise administration of the
United States Mining Commissioners,
hydraulic mining is on the increase, and
this, with the renewed interest in gravel
and quartz mining, has resulted in a
gradual increase in our production of
gold. When the figures for 1597 are all
in we will doubtless find that our pro
duction for that year was not less than
$18,000,000. Â , _ ...
The discovery of gold In California was
not only important on account of the rich
harvest which followed in this State, but
also on account of the stimulus which it
gave to the search for gold throughout
the whole world. Even the long neglect
ed and almost forgotten gold mines of
Great Britain were reopened as a result
of this stimulus, and they are producing
some gold even down to the present time.
The most Important result which flowed
from this however, was the discovery
on the Australian continent, where the
results from placer mining have exceeded
those of our own State, and even in
quartz mining they are pressing us hard
for supremacy.
It was our own hardy forty-niners"
who in the search for gold in other lo
calities, discovered the great Comstock
lode, which has yielded its $400,000,000. 45
per cent of which, it must not be for
gotten, was in gold.
These same hardy prospectors trav
ersed every foot of Nevada, and to their
energy is due the enormous silver dis
coveries In Pioche, Eureka and other dis
tricts At Eureka, too. they solved for
the world" a new problem in metallurgyâ
the economical treatment of low-grade
lead ores. . Â, : â â 
These resolute miners spread still far
ther out and invaded Utah. Montana.
Idaho and Colorado, with results which
are part of the world's history. In these
remote regions they did not find it is
true, the golden nugget of California, but
found the precious metals combined with
baser Ingredients, and to separate these
has been productive of an enormous ac
tivity among the Brightest scientific and
mechanical minds of the world.
As a suit of all this pioneering the
gross gold product of the United States
for the past year was not less than $55,
000 000 It must be remembered, too, tnat
tne skill and experience of the California
miner has been extensively utilized in the
gold velds of South Africa, and that the
Transvaal, for the area mined, is the
largest gold producer in the world.
Taken as a whole the gross gold pro
duction of the world during IM*7 was fully
J2CO 000 000. and it Is safe to predict tnat
by the end of the century the annual
yield will be quite $.".00,000,000. ..><â¢'..â¢
" Even those figures may be largely ex
ceeded if the recent discoveries in Alaska
fulfill anything like the expectations
built upon them. The miner whose ex
perience has been confined to California
will find many new difficulties to meet
and overcome in inhospitable Alaska,
There will be frozen ground to blast and
only Ice for sluicing purposes during at
least nine months of the year.
California, despite the fact that it has
been mined for half a century, has really
tteen prospected only in part, and It
stands still unrivaled in extent of gold
bearing area and facilities for economi
cal miningâ facts which should be remem
bered by those who are casting yearning
glances toward Alaska.
MONKEYS AS COLD-FINDERS.
Captain F-. Moss of the Transvaal
tells the following Btory of the monkeys
who work for him in the mines:
"I have twenty-four monkeys," said
he, "employed about my mines. They
do the work of seven able-bodied men.
In many instances they lend valuable
aid where a man is useless. They
gather up the small pieces of quartz
would be passed unnoticed by the
workingmen, and pile them up in lit
tle heaps that can easily be gathered
up in a shovel and thrown into a mill.
They work just as they please, some
going down into the mines when
they have cleared up all the debris on
the outside. They live and work to
gether without quarreling any more
than men do. They are quite method
ical in their habits, and go to work and
finish up in the same manner as hu
man beings would do under similar cir
cumstances. It is very interesting to
l i them at their labor, and see how
ally they look after every detail
of the work they attempt. They clean
up about the mines, follow the wheel
barrows and carts used in mining, and
pick up everything that falls ofl on tha
way."
HUNTING FOR LOST
MINES IN MEXICO
FOR many years Mexico has
been one of the great silver
producing countries of the world
and has also contributed her
proportion of gold, copper and
lead. But notwithstanding all this the
possibilities and opportunities of that
land are less understood and appre
ciated than those of any other mineral
bearing country. Mexico has opportu
nities, and those too In abundance, for
men of brains, energy and means.
The mineral wealth of Mexico- is quite
an unknown quantity, and it is safe to
say that for the number of mining ven
tures for that country as compared to
those of California, Nevada or Colo
rado â Mexico can show a larger
percentage of successes than could be
scored by either of the above-named
States.
For some cause American capital has
fought shy of Mexico as a field for in-
vestments, and has given as an excuse,
first, that the laws do not afford ade
quate protection for either life. or prop
erty: and, second, that transportation
facilities are insufficient.
The first of these objections Is unwar
ranted, while the Becond must be ad
mitted.
In Mexico the miner. Instead of mak
ing a location as he does in the United
States, makes a "denouncement" which
to all intents and purposes is the same
thing, and he secures possessory title
to the land desired by filing an appli
cation with the proper official,
causes a survey to be made and records
the same.
The Government Imposes an annual
tax of $10 for each "pertinentia," which
is a block of ground 300 f-^et square.
At any time after making the "de
nouncement" the prospector is at lib
erty to commence developing his prop
erty: but the mining laws of the coun
try d"> not permit him either to reduce
br ship away the ores extracted from
the ground until he has first procured a
patent from the Interior Department at
the City of Mexico.
Under what was known as the old
mining laws of Mexico, it was neces
sary to employ two men for at least
twenty-six weeks of each year upon
the property; but under the new law,
the enforced labor clause has been re
pealed and a tax of $10 for each "per
tinentia" per annum has been substi
tuted. This includes both 'â¢denounce
ments" and patent locations, without
regard to the number of â â¢pertineotias"
that are held by the Individual or com
pany.
This is not quite all, for the Govern
ment still exacts an extraction tax.
which is an amOunt equal to about 5
per cent of the gross product, payable
in silver. It is this last named tax that
has been much exaggerated throughout
this country, and has given many the
Impression that the Mexican Govern
ment was disposed to impose unreason
able and unjust taxes upon foreigners
operating mines within her borders.
On the contrary, a large majority of
Americans who are engaged in mining
in Mexico, while not disloyal to their
own country would assure the inquirer
that the mining laws of Mexico are
preferable to those of the United States.
The prospector in Mexico is allowed
more latitude than there in our own
States, as no private land holder can
deny him the privilege of entering and
prospecting under certain regulations
to suit the case. As, for instance, if a
prospector enter the field of a farmer
to prospect for mineral bearing rock
or placer diggings, he is not permitted
to sink more than thirty feet, which ex'
cavation he 'is compelled to refill if the
project is abandoned. But on the other
hand, if the discovery warrants the
purchase, and the prospector and farm
er fail to agree upon the price of the
land, then the Judge of the district, as
sisted by two citizens, who are chosen
to represent the parties to the transac
tion, appraise its value. For It is writ
ten that the farmer must sell to the
miner such lands as he wishes for min
ing purposes. The same law applies to
timber, water rights and mill sites.
One of the interesting features of
mining in Mexico of recent years has
been the reopening: of the old .'iKin
doned mines of the Spanish padres,
Many of these have developed Into the
most valuable properties of the coun
try.
Under the padre system the mir.eg
were operated by Mexican and Indian
peons and generally worked to a water
level, with pillars of ore left standing
to support the ground.
The ores were then reduced by either
arastras, patios or small adobe furnaces.
Which process was very slow, and the
gold and silver bullion produced was
then exported by the Spanish masters
to Europe, leaving the yawning exca
vations, the church records and an
impoverished people as Mexico's share
of the profits.
After freeing themselves from the
rule of Spain, the Mexicans nnd In
dians of the country turned their at
tention to the pillars of ore left by
their former rulers, and these for years
furnished them occupation. They hav
ing in a degree benefited by their ex
perience with the foreigner, reduced
their ores by the same slow metallurgi
cal process.
Mexico is a Plow country In
which to do business. and to
attempt to op<^n a mine there
and supply it with a milling plant
is an undertaking calculated to try the
patience of Job.
Mule trails constitute the ronds and
highways, and instead of the freight
wagons and prairie schooners of the
Urit^d States, the Mexican freighter
utilizes the "hurricane deck" of a
Mexican burro, and with tht^se little
beasts of burden all freight and sup
plies are transported throughout the
interior mining country.
An American in this country would
hesitate to carry a large quartz mill
from San Francisco to Grass Valley, or
to the Siskiyous with a pack train, but
a Mexican provided with a sufficient
number of burros, a little parched corn
and a stock of cigarettes will wade into
the transportation business and land
the mill In due course of time.
A good example of this is the Bata
pilas mill of sixty stamps and steam
plant that was packed in sections for
300 miles through the Sierra Madre
Mountains.
Placer mining has received less at
tention in Mexico than other branches
of the mining industry. This is mainly
due to the scarcity of water. There are
in various sections large placer fields
that would yield fortunes if water
could be obtained, in the absence of
which the natives work the richer
places by the process of "dry washing."
Prospecting by the foreigner has been
chiefly confined to the old abandoned
mines, which at best is rather a blind
undertaking, as the "ancients" (as they
ara called) seem to have prospected
the country very thoroughly. In most
Instances they succeeded in working
out the surface ground, so that the in
dications to which the latter-day miner
pins his faith are the old depressions,
together with the dumps, by the size of
which he calculates how extensively
the old mining had been carried on.
The old arastra beds and slag piles
from the primitive adobe smelters are
also figured upon as something to as-
Bist in their calculations.
Owing to the methods of milling and
smelting then in vogue the Spaniards
and natives assorted the high-grade
ores from those of lesser value, leaving
the second grade or refuse on the
dumps.
Many of these second-grade dumps
have been discovered which contain
thousands of tons of ore that can be
handled at a profit with modern milling
and concentrating machinery.
The time is coming and that speed
ily when the crude mining methods pre
vailing in our sister republic will have
become a thing of the past. Railroads
will connect her isolated mining camps
with the outside world, and Mexican
mining centers will have been estab
lished, which will rival Virginia City,
Butte and Denver. Q. W. G.

SOCIETY
THE great event of the past week
was the magnificent ball given on
Thursday evening by Mr. and
Mrs. Antoine Bore! compliment
jj> ary to their debutante daughters,
the Misses Grace and Alice Borel.

most elaborate private function of the

the gathering, and it Is estimated that
there were more than 800 dancers on the

Is the second meeting of the popular Cin
derellas, to be held on Wednesday even-
Ing, the 26th. The club will meet, as here
tofore, at Native Sons' Hall. Outside of

during the week of jubilee will be kept
within the bounds of small gatherings
either at luncheons, dinners or teas.

terior will be entertained extensively, but
as yet no detinite plans have been an
nounced.

entertaining goes. Three big dances have
already been announcedâ the Murphy
fancy dress cotillon at the Palace, the
ball to be given by Mr. and Mrs. C. de
Guigne at the Parrott residence and the
â Whittier dinner dance. Other minor en
tertainments are also being looked for
ward to.
Owing to a confusion of dates between
the Friday Fortnightly and the Friday
Night dubs, due to the postponement of
one of the cotillona of the latter club,
the last meeting of the Friday Fortnight
ly will tx â  evening
ruary 10, at Golden Gate Hall. This will
be the army and navy cotillon, and will
be under the leadership of the army of
ficers. At midnight a lig i will

MO matter how small her dres
allowance may be, the French
woman is sure to have at
J> ii least one or two tea gowns
among hor wardrobe. It Is
â¢he alone who appreciates the true
ralue of a negligee. She will surprise
rou by saying that the tea gown is
iconomical; that it is an actual money
lavlng investment. She will assure
rou that her youthful appearance and
fter fresh pink and white complexion
ire due more to an inexpensive louns
ng robe than to anything else in the
world.
The true Frencli woman never wears
aer street pown in the house, which is
>ne of the big particular reasons why
ihe is always such a well-gowned, chic
roung person on the boulevard. When
ihe comes in from a promenade she
Sisrobes, and whether she is to be at
Home for fifteen minutes or an entire
ifternoon, into her tea gown she slips,
generally it is more of a lounging robe
;han a fanciful tea gown, for when my
Jttle French lady wears it she rests,
md there's half the secret of her vi
racity. Though she may have but one
itreet costume, her tea gowns are sure
to number two, and she Is apt to have
from two to ttiree breakfast Jacket? as
â well, which she wears with beruffled
Bilk skirts.
The American woman's fondness for
the tea gown is growing. She Is be
ginning to appreciate its true value.
Never before in New York city have so
many negligees been sold as this year.
And such captivating gowns as they
are!
Tea gowns are not to be worn at 5
o'clock teas, as a young person from
the country innocently supposed. As a
rule, they are to be worn exclusively
In the privacy of one's own room. But
some of the more costly gowns are
quite suitable for dinner wear when
one is dining with their own immedi
ate family.
One of the latest tea gowns !s a verita
ble dream of loveliness. It was designed
for a New York woman whose room
was a rose-color bower. By the way.
It is one of the New York girl's newest
fads to select her tea gown to match
the coloring of her room. This partic
ular tea gown is made of delicate pink
brocaded silk. In the back it falls from
the neck in a graceful "Watteau plait.
The front of the gown shows a charm-
Ing little bolero jacket cut in square
(hape tabs. Beneath the tabs and out
lining the Jacket is a fluffy Jabot of
French lace. The gown Is confined at
the waist with satin ribbon, which ties
In a bow with long ends.
The sleeve Is specially effective. It la
one of the pretty butterfly patterns.
Near the shoulder the Bilk is divided
Into two winglike folds which are sep
arated by a lace Jabot, whi^h falls
lome distance down the arm. The rest
of the sleeve is plain until It reaches
the wrist, where the brocaded silk is
cut in tabs and a lace frill peeps out

wall of he lode and the black micaceous

proper is twenty-four feet In width or \
father In transverse measurement.
There are three lodes. The ore Is free
milling, easily reduced and submits
readily to amalgamation. At the depth
5f eighty feet the ore carries 3 per cent
pf sulphurets. They are sulphurets of
Iron, sulphuretH of copper and arsenical
pyrites. The sulphurets increase as
Septh is attained. The uniform value
:n gold per ton of sulphuret is $80.
There is a Fhaft down 150 feet, a cross
sut at the 60-foot level and another one
it the 150-foot level. At the latter level

The mine !s easy of access, can be '
worked the entire year and ia very good

engine, boiler, hoisting machinery and
pumps. Three miles couth is the

silk, with a high-standing lace frill at
the bark. This gown is quite a gorge
ous affair, but It may be copied effect
ively and for much less money in one
of the pretty shades of soft, bright flan
nel, using a coarser quality wÂ£ lace for
the trimming.
Another tea gowns which !s a special
favorite this season is made of silk
crepon in a light turquoise shade. The
gown in front hangs straight and full
from Its satin collar. Just at the waist
line two deep-pointed reveres start,
which broaden out as they reach the
shoulders. The?'* reveres are outlined
wiUi a frill of point. Venice lace, which
below the waist line falls to the bot
tom of the robe in a fluffy Jabot, out
lining the front breadth of the gown.
The sleeve 1b most unpretentious. It is
made of the crepon, and Is nearly tight
fitting, being a trifle fuller at the
shoulder than the wrist, where it ends
in a deep point edped with lace. AM
the Eleeves of the newest tea gowns fall
well over the hands. Encircling the
waist of this tea gown is a broad band
of turquoise satin ribbon, which ties at
the left side in a bow with many ends.
The collar 1b also of the satin ribbon
with a big bow at the back and the
ribbon half smothered in a becoming
lace frill.
To illustrate the ract that the plalfl
craze knows no diminishing there are
plaid negligees and breakfast Jackets
in plenty this year. A comfortable as
well as stylish little gown is made of a
genuine Scotch plaid in soft French
flannel. The plaid is carried out in
shades of dark blue and green, with
Just a bright touch of scarlet here and
there. The front of the gown Bhows
a finely pleated yoke, at each Bide of
which a deep collar is formed of the
unpleated flinnel. This collar extends
across the back of the gown and is
trimmed with two bands of lace lnser

entire year, from where electricity'
could be obtained to operate the mill j

The mine offers one of the best chances
for legitimate investment in the entire
State.
J- P. O'BRIEN.
An Attorney Prominent in Mining
Circles.
John P. O'Brien, the subject of this
sketch, la a Native Son, a member of
the Aloatraz Parlor, and was born in
San Francisco. He studied with Jor
dan & Bull, and was admitted in 1887.
He was prepared for his examination
by Del mas & Bull, and shortly after
his admission opened offices with E. L.
Campbell, a prominent mining attor
ney. In 1596 he left for San Andreas,
and went into partnership with Frank
Solinsky. At the solicitation of several
prominent mine owners, he was induc
ed to settle In Sonora. Mr. O'Brien has
a fine record in mining litigation. One
of his cases which may be mentioned
is that of Howeth vs. Sullenger, report
ed in 113 th California. He represented
the applicant for a patent before the
Supreme Court. The case was that
Sullenger et al. made application for a
patent for a magnesite mine in which
they were adversed by Howeth In the
land office. Howeth brought suit In the
Superior Court of Napa County, and
upon the trial the court denied the
right of both parties to a patent be
cause the claim was not bo marked
that the boundaries could be readily
traced. After about a year the case
was submitted to Mr. O'Brien, who
took an appeal to the Supreme Court,
which body adopted his view and re
versed the case, with Instructions te
enter judgment for applicant for pat
ent. This wsus the first clean-cut 4ecl

A WOMAN'S TRIP DOWN INTO A DEEP MINE.
THE Rose Mine, in the Morongo
District, San Bernardino County,
1b the largest mine in Southern
California. The direct route is
to go by rail to Victor and then
drive forty miles up Into the moun
tains. We were hunting at Bear Val
ley, fifty miles staging from San Ber
nardino, when a visit to Om mine, flf
i teen miles away, was suggested.
The gentlemen in the party were un
' certain about a woman's being al
, lowed to descend the mine, as there Is
I no cage, only the buckets for carry
j ing the ore, but everybody was so good
\ to me at Randsburg that I had hopes
It would be all right. The road was
picturesque in the extreme, winding
in and out among the mountains, and
occasionally we came In Bight of a
large portion of the Mojave deeert. with
Its wonderful colorings, so that I felt
| we were well paid for our exerting be
! fore we reached the mine and would
have been reconciled even had we failed
to see It, but Mr. Harrison, the super
intendent, greeted us cordially and
told us we were welcome to go every
where and see everything.
I was craxy to go down the shaft at
once and could hardly wait for the next
bucket to be emptied of Its ore before
clambering In, but I thought I eugtat to
be courteous, se asked the others who
should go first. To my surprise, one
I of the gentlemen had lost his Interest
exterior boundaries were marked by
stakes and stone monuments at each
corner. The trial court held that this
marking was not a sufficient compll- '
I
; In the mine, another was feeling: the
altitude of 1000 feet bo greatly he felt
he should He down a while, and finally
our exploring party had dwindled to
one young man (whom the others said
was too youthful to know fear) and
myself (and I hadn't sense enough). So
th* 1 youth and I climbed Into the
bucket, which didn't look big enough
for one, and down into the blackness
; we dropped, Mr. Harrison descending
| thÂ« ladder beside us.
The shaft is sufficiently off the per
pendicular for the buckets to run on
steel Bkifls, and that makes the mo
tion much smoother than if you were
p-.rln|ring loose In the shaft, and the air
through the whole mine Is wonderfully
com ard sweet, so that we didn't feel
suffecated. But it's astonishing how
long it takes to go down 5M feet of
darkness, and that's as far as the first
shaft goes. At every hundred-foot
level there is a EW-foot drift, and the
ore has all been worked out between
levels by stoplng. until now they are
working on the PM-foot level.
We were helped Â«ut of the bucket by
nmi astonishe<s-loÂ«king miners and
we lighted our randies frem theirs and
walked along the drift on the little rail
way on which the buckets roll
for 500 feet, and there was a
gasoline engine operating the hoist
In a shaft going down an
other JOO feet. This shaft Is not as
well finished as the first, as it la not
te be permanent, and the engineer ser
te*csly objected to our nsing the bucket,
but Mr. Harrison explained the situation
i and we climbed In again, and tt Cv .
ance with the Federal laws. This was
a great victory for Mr. O'Brien. He
also appeared before the Supreme Court
In the case of Sheeny vs. Shinn, and
lowered still more slowly to the 800
foot level. When we jot out there we
could Bee the work of the mine going
on In all directions. Some were plck
lnp out the ore over their heads, boitm
were drilling holes for the blasting
which takes place at noon and night,
tome were filling the buckets. "We
were told this was as far as the buckets
could go as yet, but if we wished to
climb down a ladder a hundred feet we
could get tÂ« the absolute "base of ope
rations."
Bo we climbed flown and found one
poor, lone man drilling for blasting and
keeping cheerful by forcing his breath
out between his teeth with a loud hiss
every time he struck his drill. Then
we climbed back the hundred feet and
seventy more, and went out on another
drift, and climbed down a winze oo an
overhanging ladder where some men
were working in a sort of pocket. They
were more astonished than the others
had been, but one of them recoTered
sufficiently to effer me a very pretty
specimen he had just found, and wÂ«
started back.
When we reached the surface Â«f the
earth again we found all our party suf
ficiently recovered to accompany us
around the mills. These are quite
extensive, including a ten-stamp mill,
and the necessary offices, stores, etc.,
all in a wonderful condition of neat
ness an* order, but I felt as If this was
all of secondary interest te the 90t

The same pattern of lace trims the
front of the gown in & Jabot for some
distance below the waist line. Dark
green satin ribbons are used to confine
the negl.'gee at the waist, and they t!o
according to the general custom of tha
season at the left Bids. The sleeve Is
plain and oomfortable. It has no deco
ration whatever until it noars the
wrist, where two bands of lace are
Inserted and a deep frill of the lace
then appears in a graceful finish.
The tea gown of one material, with
sleeves of another, Is regarded as fash
ionable this year. It gives the eco
nomical woman an#excellent opportu
nity of making as of her old gowns.
And then the tea gown veiled in net or
prauxe Is another fad of the hour. Silk
party gowns, which have served well
their duty at the dance, may bo trans
formed by a filmy drapery of gauze or
net Into a tea gown beautiful to be
hold.
For thÂ« woman to luxury born there
are tea gowns lined throughout with
fur. With all these gowns an edging
of the lining shows aÂ« a trimming for
the front of thÂ« rob*. Then thÂ«re are
other costly tea gowns which have a
wadded satin lining, but are trimmed
lavishly with fur. Ont Keen recently
was of corn-color satin, with the deep
lace- covered collar trimmed with a
band of dangling sable tails. These
expensive tails also formed a Jabot
down the entire tront of the gown.
No woman need be without a break
fast Jacket this season, for they can be
bought ready-made from 85 cents up to
$50. One of the prettiest as well as the
best wearing of the newest tea Jackets
is made of fine Bedford cord, violet In
color. It Is three-quarter length and
has a tight-fitting back. The front is
loose, hanging In pleats. It is made
with a yoke of shirred velvet silk, out
lined with a narrow row of lace bead
ing and finished with a deep lace frill.
The collar is a stock, shirred to match
the yoke, and at the back there is a
frill of lace. There are ribbons at the
â¢waist line of the same shade of violet
as the Bedford cord, and they may tie
either at the front or the left side.

M. B. HARRIMfIN.
A Progressive Mining Man of
Tuolurone County.
One of the moat prominent mining
men In the State Is Mr. Harriman of
Sonora. Cal. He Is one of the early
comers to the Golden State, arriving
here In May, 1850. Immediately on his
arrival here he went to Tuolumne
County by the way of Stockton, and
has remained there ever since. Mr.
Harriman has demonstrated his abil
ity as a mining man by his numerous
successful ventures, and his Judgment
Is to-day taken where an expression of
opinion from an expert would net carry
weight. He has been the owner of sev
eral mines which he has sold to differ
ent companies, and without one single
exception they have turned out rich
and even more so than was represent
ed by Mr. Harriman. Among these
might be mentioned the famous Ala
meda Mine, locate* near the Rawhide,
which he sold to a Chicago company,
and which to-day Is one of the best
dividend producers In the State. At
present he is interested in and the prin
cipal owner in the North Star. Gar
field Consolidated, Skinner, Batchelder,
Harriman Gold Mining Company in
Tuolumne County and the Rio vista in
Calaveras County, besides several
pocket mines. He is one of the direct
ors In the Tuolumne County Water
Company's ditch, one of the largest in
stitutions in the county. He Is a na
tive of Maine, but is at the same time
a thorough Californian. Mr. Harrlman
was made & Mason in the sprint; of
lined either with fine flannel or with
wadded satin. One which seemed more
for ornament than practical use was
made of faint yellow India silk,
trimmed with fluffy frills of accordion
pleated chiffon and tiny puffings of the
chiffon. The silk sleeve was exception
ally pretty. Three pleated frills of the
chiffon airily fell over the top of the
sleeve, while from the shoulder to the
wrist the silk was horizontally striped
at intervals with puffings of the chif
fon.
The collar was also effective. It was
a stock of the silk with an accordion
pleated ruffle falling over it and a veri
table silk and chiffon butterfly at the
bp.ck. This delicate little matinee Is an
exceptionally pretty model to copy in
less perishable fabrics.
Another silk tea jacket Is rose pink
In color, and its special feature la a
deep collar of lace insertion run with
satin ribbon and edged with a lace ruf
fle, the lace falling over the shoulder
and then continuing almost to the
waist line. The silk sleeves are also
striped with the lace Insertion.
One of the oddest breakfast Jackets
of the year is essentially Japanese. It
looks just as though it were designed
for a little Jap lady with almond
shaped eyes. It is made of gay Roman
striped silk, hangs loose back and front
and has the conventional flowing
Japanese sleeve.
Many of the breakfast Jackets, both
in flannel and s!lk, are made with long
Btole ends. When the ends are of lace
the effect Is graceful and pretty.

THE final novel In Zola's trilogy,
"Paris," Is now appearing serially
In Le Journal and Is attracting
considerable comment In literary
circles. It Is a continuation of
"Lourdes" and "Rome," presenting
familiar characters under new con
ditions and In a different environment.
In regard to the character and scope of
this -work, as well as to his method in
â¢writing it, Zola has made the following
statements to the Paris correspondent of
the St. Petersburg Novy Dleu:
"It la true that 'Paris' has not re
quired as much time as either of the
other parts of the trilogy. I have not
had to travel, yet it has not been a much
easier task than the writing of 'Rome,'
having consumed about eight months. It
has been necessary to resort to 'docu
ments' most assiduously, since I have
had to touch upon every sphere of civil
ized human activity to introduce the
reader into every movement and school
of Parisian thought, literary, artistic, po
litical and financial. The reader will be
come acquainted with every aspect of
the rich life of the French capital, and
though the treatment is necessarily su
perficialâ kaleidoscopic, as it were still,
I cannot write on any matter except
upon a thorough knowledge of It. This
requires observation, verification and
study. For example, I had occasion to
Bpeak of a factory, p.nd having selected,
on account of the novelty, a bicycle fac
tory, I was obliged to spend some days
in mastering the bicycle Industry. In
fact, I bestowed more labor on 'Paris'
than on either of the other novels in the
three cities series. 'Paris' Is a romance '
In the true sense of the term. It con- j
tains much movement and action, many
personages and many changing scenes. \
Most conspicuous, of course, is the Abbe :
Froment. In his company I study the !
role of Paris in modern history and mdi- !
cate its future mission. It Is. in my
opinion, very great. I point to Paris as
the beacon illuminating the path of the j
Intellectual life and progress of all man
kind. You foreigners may not agree with
me in regarding Paris as the capital of
the world; but I have done everything
possible to Justify the title, 'City of
Light," which Paris has so properly
gained for itself.
"But do not think that 1 eulogize and
laud Paris. I do not cover up its dark
Bide and do not ignore the evils which
undermine it. I simply show that the
life-giving and invigorating spring which
will quench man's thirst for knowledge
and satisfy his yearning for moral de
velopment and perfection takes its course
originates Inâ Paris. The purity
and power of this spring depend on the
material prosperity of Paris. Rome is to
be dismantled in favor of Paris, where
Abbe Froment will acquire his new cult
of science and human solidarity, and
where he will finally find spiritual peace
and joy, after having vainly sought them
at Lourdes and Rome."
More explicit and clear is Zola's refer
ence to the social and political teachings
of his novel in an interview with" the
. representative of Le Temps. Paris. We
translate from It as follows:
"I do not spare the vices of Paris, but
even the crime committed In the course
of my study only serves to accentuate the
virtue and nobility of the great city, this
refuge of life and goodness to which
Froir.ent comes to warm his heart. Here.
In Paris, he conceives the Idea of the new
religion of the future, of the better social
order . slowly developing out of the tra
vail of so many workers. Thus Paris,
â¢with all its philanthropy, proves the utter
Impotence of charity, which rests on Â«
sentiment that Is Christian and anti
social. It is necessary that the Idea of
Justice, which places the weak on their
own feet, should supplant the idea of
philanthropy, which merely supports the
â weak In their fallen and degraded condi
tion. The era of Justice Is dawning in
Paris. After three years' life In Paris,
my hero. Abbe Froment. who left Rome
-In despair, welcomes with sweet whis- \
pers of gratitude the new heaven and j
earth he Is permitted to behold. The j
solution I give accords with my own ma
tured views of the beneficence of life, of
the greatness of human destiny, when the j
sole foundation of society shall bo labor." |
Zola declares that, while he has intro
duced all kinds and conditions of menâ
nobles, financiers, revolutionists, anarch
ists, decadents, savants, workmen and
politicians, he has nowhere photographed ,
reality and has not painted the portraits I
of contemporary individuals. The lovers j
of â scandal.'. he says, will be- disappointed
though there is plenty of material for
I excited polemics. Anticipating adverse
criticism. Zola says:
â :'. "I expect the same reception as that
accorded to previous works, bat I hope
that after my. death I may be Judged
â¢with greater fairness. Then it will, per
haps, be recognized that I was neither
J a pessimist nor a.corrupter. He is not
a pessimist who on every occasion sings
hymns to life; he Is not a corrupter who
tirelessly and earnestly proclaims the
high dignity and worth of labor. â¢ Let any
one go through the entire Rougon-Mac
quart series and ha will find that love
of life and passion for work Bhlno through
â¢every ona of Its pages. There la nothing
worse than solitude, Idleness and death,
and against thews foes have I striven, It
Is utterly unjust to charge that I have
' â ought to pervert and confuse minds. If
X am indifferent to this fclsÂ« verdict, it.
is because I do not believe It will eland
long."

that have already appeared Indicate that
Zola Is a convert to the socialistic phil
osophy of social life. Through hln hero.
Pierre Froment. he Is to preach brother
hood, equality and solidarity as defined by

WHAT'S IN A NAME?
Is there any room for originality In
the matter of names?
Literary men on both sides of the At
lantic are puzzling themselves over the
question, because during this century of
prolific production so many people have
written books and given names to them
that It seems Impossible to find a new
title.
The best the unfortunate author can
do Is to find a forgotten name for his
book, and even then he can never be
sure that some Inquisitive bibliographer
will not discover his Iniquity. A wise
modern cynic has remarked that origin
ality can be expected from nobody save
a lunatic, a hermit, or a sensational
novelist.
But nowadays the last exception should
be omitted, for sensationalists are not
remarkable for the novelty of their
Ideas. I think It In the omniscient Kip
ling who remarks somewhere that there
are only forty stories In the world, one
of which could be told to a lady, and
thirty-nine which couldn't.
As the limitations of modern taste pre
vent the publication of the thirty-nine,
we have no means of saying whether
Kipling Is really right. However, looking
at the persistency with which the worn
i out themes of love and Intrigue and mur
! der are shown up again and again, there
would seem to be sense In his dictum. .
But leaving plots out of the question,
the difficulty of finding a new title 13
j really a serious one. because of the copy-
I right law. The name of a book Is Just
! as much the property of the copyrlghter
i as any other portion of Its contents, and
! therefore the unfortunate author is In
constant danger of trespassing on some
one else's preserves, with possibly a suit
for Infringement lurking in the back
ground. :tV
An additional and even more serious
difficulty is added. In England at any
rate, however it may be In this country.
! The great circulating libraries, such as
i Mudie'a. positively refuse to place on
their shelves a book with a once-used
: name. They will not complicate their cat
] alogues by Including two works of the
i same title, and those who understand the
I influence these great libraries have on
the success or failure of a book. will sym
! pathize with unfortunate authors.
Writers of note have frequently com
plained of this grievance, Mr. James
Payn, In particular. ursed authors' and
publishers" attention to the question years
ago. And more recently an anonymous
writer In the new critical paper. Liter
ature, has taken the trouble to disinter
some remarkable Instances of duplicate
titles.
One of the most amusing cases, affect
ing authors on both sides of the Atlantic,
is thfit of "The Passionate Pilgrim."
Shakespeare, who wrote at a time when |
many things were new, onw gave the |
world a version of the old. old love story '
under this title. The romance of sweet
Cytherea. sitting by a brook, and young
Adonis, lovely, fresh ay.d green, makes
quite a long poem, glowing with sensuous
imagery, and probably for this reason but
little rend. Perhaps this accounts for the
fad that the last two generations of
â¢ is have forgotten Shakespeare's
claim to tho title.
Quito recently Mr. Percy White gave to
the world n nov-I with the title of "A
Pa.'-slonate Pilgrim." The book had only
been In circulation a few days when it
Â«rai discovered that twenty years before
Mr. Henry James bad published a volume
of shirt stories under this name.
Mr. White did the proper thing in apol
opizlr.,-, to Mr. James for unintentionally
poaching on his preserves, but to his sur
prise Mi-. JameM explamed In reply that
there wuh no need to worry over the mat
ter, since the title had been already em
ployed several yeara before by Mr. F. T.

rounds, to nay nothing of Shakespeare's

THE SAT* FT*A"N"CTSCO CATVL, STTNDAT, JAXTTAUT 23, 1898.
Emlla Zola Is said, by those who have read him, to be a realist of the realists. A Parisian born, he has spent
most of the fifty-six years of his life in his own city, and made a great 'reputation In France by publishing books,
the sale of which was punished as a crime In other countries. He was educated at the St. Louis College In Parla.
and at 25 began to devote himself wholly to writing. Ills books number over a score. They cover many subjects,
and their noted author has been able to be vile in all but one or two. M. Zola delights in odd situations. Fot Instance,
two years ago, he wrote a book In which the devotions of pious persons at Lourdes were treated In his usual style.
Then he promptly went to Rome and presented himself for an Interview with Pope Leo. It might have been be
cause of the book "Lourdes," or it might have been because of others; but Leo refused to see him. For many years
the author of "Claude" and "Nana" and "La Terre" has been eager to become one of the immortals of the French
Academy, probably because he knew he could not. The academicians could not get the smell of M. Zola's famous books
out of their nostrils, and consistently closed their door to him. "Le Reve." his only pure work, eminently un-Zola
esque. was written to placate the academy, "but Louis Marie Julien Viaud was elected in IS9I and Zola Is still a
mortal. If not a member of the academy, the great realist is at least a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and has
been president of the French Society of Men of Letters. His "Rome." written with the hope that It wcmld pass him

written In IS9O. bore the name Mr. Bailey I
Martin. At the time he was unaware of.
the existence of a well-known American
family of almost precisely similar name,
and the book, which has been extensively
circulated : throughout the United States,
is sometimes referred to as Mr. Bradley
Martin.
Another and more amusing Instance of
similarity of names occurred when Mr.
Le Galllenne announced his new book.
"The , Quest of the. Golden Girl.". Another
author had . ready for publication "The
Quest of the Golden Pearl," and after a
good deal of angry correspondence the
two authors agreed to let the public de
cide for Itself as to the merits of their
closely related titles.
Perhaps one of the only methods of se
curing absolute originality of title Is by
translatlojs from another language. The
French are past masters of this system.
and any number of absurd instances are
on record, showing how titles, both Eng
lish and German, have had their mean
ings entirely changed by the exercise of
a little Gallic Ingenuity.
One of the best of these original ren
derings Is the translation of Cibber's com
edy. "Love's Last Shift." The play ap
peared In French entitled, "La dernlere
Chemise de L' Amour.'.'
There are other Instances nearly as
startling. Congreve's tragedy, "The
Mourning Bride." came out as "L'Epouse
dv Matin." Even Dickens, whose mean
ing one would thir.k was plain enough,
has not escaped his unconscious French
humor.
It is related that when "Our Mutual
Friend.' under the title of "L'Aml Com
mun," was first published in Paris great
expectations were formed by the pub
lishers of its success. But af:er the first
half dozen parts had been published the
public rose en masse and declined to read
further a foreign author whose writings
were full of such palpable absurdities.
The whole trouble was due to the ab
solutely literal manner In which the
translator had fulfilted his task. To
give only one instance. "A Pea Overcoat"
was rendered Into French "Un Paletot
I de Coulaur de Puree de Pols."
It is not only the English who have
suffered at the hands of the French
translator. The Germans on occasion
have been treated quite as badly. Bou
chette, the biographer of Jacob Boehm,
In giving a list of the writer's works
came across "Reflections on Isaiah Stle
fel." Now Isaiah Stlefel was a theolo
gian of contemporary fame, but evident
ly Bouchette had never heard of .him.
Stlefel happens to mean boot In Ger
man, and knowing that the volume vat
of a religious character the translator
entitled It, "Reflexions Sur lea Bones

THE LAND OF MANY STORIES.
IN THE PERMANENT WAYâ By Flora
Annie Steel. The Macmlllan Company,
New York. 1537.
Probably no country In the world af
fords such an admirable field for thÂ«Â»
Bhort-story writer as India. The an
tiquity of its civilization, the variety of
its racial types, the mysticism of its re
ligious rites, may all be exploited with
brilliant effect without calling for too
much exercise of the author's imagina
tion. In fact, one of the chief charms of
the really good Indian story Is that It
reads so admirably true. The character
istic is especially marked in all of Kip
ling's work; no one wouM ever think that
he invented any of the marvelous Indian
stories he has given us, though he him
self has christened onÂ»> of his books
"Many Inventions.' Probably he did this
purposely, knowing well that none would
give him credit for the invention, however
much they might be charmed with the
treatment.
And following Kipling, though It must
be confessed, a long way behind, comes
Mrs. Steel, whose acquaintance with the
esoteric side of Indian life is probably as
deep as that possessed by Mulvaney's
chronicler. But though tho subject mat
ter may be similar, tho difference in style
Is strongly marked. Killing, in the terse,
vigorous English which ho handles with
a powor all his own. seises instantly all
the rugged picturesque features of an
incident: he is afrr.i.l of nothing, and
deals intimately with phases of Hfe which
the less gifted writer would be damned
for meroly touching.
Genius Is a law unto Itself, and no au
thor has done more to prove the truth
of this assertion than Kipling. Wisely
enough. Mrs. Steel has chown a smoother
path. Apart from the fact that she Is a

in a nent. finished, ytt at the same time
effective style.
Like Kipling, Mrs. Steel has her chosen
narrator of strange stories. Hut his
name Is not Mulvaney. It is Craddock,
and instead of being a soldier he is an
engineer. lie appears to tho best ad
vantage in the tale which plves its title
to the volume. "In the Permanent Way."
A railway was being surveyed through
one of the desert regions of India, when
the party found a Jogl. or holy man. right
In the track of the line. There the man
had been sitting, year In and year out. for
who knows how long, and such a little
tiling as a railroad track was not going
to move blm. ThÂ« constructors dug
around him and leveled up to him, but
the holy man declined to move, until at
last Craddock, a big yellow-haired Saxon
who could never keep off the drink, step
ped up.
"Look here, sonny," nald Craddock,
"you're In the way, tho Permanent Way."
So the man of meditations was gently
lifted on one side and the work went on.
But always the Jog! returned to the rails,
and each time Craddock passed that way
he had to step down from the engine and
lift Old Meditations, as he called him, to
one side before the train could move on.
Only In India would such a thing be pos
sible. The end came one stormy night,
when Craddock got very drunk. The In
spector who was In the cab with him
failed to stop the train In time and Crad
dock leaped to his death In the vain at
tempt to save the Jogl. "When a whole
train," remarks the Inspector grimly,
"goes over two men who are locked In
each other's arms it Is hard, hard to tell,
well, which Is which."
Equally tragical, though told In a more
mystical vein. Is "On the Second Story."
It Is one of those thrilling narratives of
Indian fanaticism In which Mrs. Steel
excels. The victims are an educated na
tive, a schoolmaster and a poor little
Hindoo widow. The two conduct a clan
destine love affair before the shrine of
terrible Goddeas Kali, which the priests
abruptly terminate by the awful sacri
fice of the widow on the altar of their
deity. "The King's Well," told by Crad
dock, Is a strong tale of the mutiny time,
and indeed every one of the nineteen
stories which go to make up th 4 book
possesses marked Interest.
FOR LOVES OLD AND YOUNG.
A BOOK OF TRUE LOVERSâ By Oc
tave Thanet. Chicago: Way & Wil
liams. Price Jl 25.
This Is a collection of short stories re
garding "the Joys and sorrows, the ad
ventures of divers true lovers," all of
which have appeared at sundry times in
the leading magazines of the country.
The lovers are not of the puling, youth
ful variety, but men and women who
have had some experience of the world
and Its hard ways. In many Instances
they are married couples whose matri
monial careers have extended a full
quarter century. "The Court of Last
Resort" is. perhaps, the lightest and
most amusing tale In the book, as it sets
forth how a lady of color regained her
fickle spouse by Bheer force of arms.
"The Strike at Glasscock's" shows how a
woman always has her way with a man,
and in "Why Abbylonl'a surrendered," a
graphic picture is drawn of the woman
who knows not true love when she sees
it. All of the stories are well told and
are worth reading. Many of them may
even prove helpful to numerous unfor
tunate lovers who are discontented with
their lot in life.

Although the name of Java Is as fa

markable. Miss Scidmore'a "Jlnriksha

vivacity of style, and in her later work.
In a field less thoroughly tilled tnan
modern Japan she has laid the

GOING TO THE WAR IN GREECE-By
Frederick Palmer. New York: R. H.
Russell.
Mr. Frederick Palmer's Interesting book
wi'l throw much light on the late Graeco-
Turklsh war and will help those who are
Interested In military tactics to form
some understanding of the different bat

As a war correspondent Mr. Palmer was
continually at the front, and he writes
of the happenings there In a graphic and
unprejudiced manner. Although the war
was largely of a farcical nature, the re
cital of numerous skirmishes powerfully
tolfi makes very good reading. Mr.
Palmer, moreover. Is not averse to Intro
ducing lighter matter into his story when
the same can bo used effectively. The
descriptions of the country near the seat
of war, and of the different types of sol
diery congregated there. Is all new ma

themselves with meager or Inaccurate

A DISAPPEARING RELIC OF DICKENS.
No. J5 Furnivaf's Inn, London, "Where the Novelet's Brst Work Was
Done, and Which Is to Be Tern Down.
Another remnant of Dickens* London Is disappearing In the rage for
"improvement." This time It Is Furnival's Inn, Holborn. that has fallen
into the hands of the dealer in second-hand lumber; and with it goes the
place that la haunted perhaps with some of the most pathetic memories In
the life of Dickens.
It was In Furnival's Inn that he lived in his bachelor days, when he
was a reporter on the Morning Chronicle, in the "three pair back" In No.
13. where he lived from Christmas, 1834, till Christmas, 1535. Then he moved
to the "three pair soi:th," in No. 15, whose windows in the illustration ara
the three on the right on the upper floor.
It was to these rooms that Dickens brought his wife, to whom he was
married in April, 1836, and where they lived until March of the following
year. These are the rooms he describes in "David Copperfield" as being
the home of Tommy Traddles, which were the scenes of such admirable
housekeeping expedients on the part of that most -wonderful girl, Sophy.
His oldest son was born here on January 6, 1837.
The "Sketches by Boz" were written here, the earlier number of the
"Pickwick Papers," and a number of his shorter works, such as "Sunday
Under Three Heads" and "The Strange Gentleman." The rooms numbered
three, one being a sitting room, and the others bedrooms, one of which
was occupied by the beloved Mary Hogarth.
A tablet on the outside of the Inn recorded the fact of Dickens having
lived there, and the exterior of the building, as shown In the Illustration,

BY AUTHOR OF "QUO VADIS."
HANIAâ By Henryk Sienklewlca. Bos
ton: Little, Brown & Co.
Henryk Sienkiewlcz has written a new
book containing ten stories, some of
which are long and some short, but the
workmanship In none of them approaches
"Quo Vadis." "Hania. ' the first tale. Is
said to have been founded on actual oc
currences In the author's early lifetime.
It Is the story' of a young Polish girl who
has two suitors, but catches the small
pox and finally becomes a Sister of Char
ity. The death of her father, an old ser
vant in the Sienkiewlcz family, Is made
the subject of a prologue.
"Tartar Captivity" Is a romance sup
posed to have been written by a nobleman
in the seventeenth century, and throws
some light on the Ignorance and supersti
tions prevailing at the time, besides giv
ing one a good idea of how Tartar war
fare was conducted.
"Let Us Follow Him" treats of two Ro
man lovers who hover between Chris
tianity and paganism. They finally fol
low the Savior to Jerusalem and witness
his death. This story is neither original
In conception nor perfect in execution.
"Charcoal Sketches" treat of certain
phases of life In a Polish community and
are of value mainly for the light they
throw upon this subject. The rest of the
stories deal with social life In the author's
own country, and although somewhat
marred by a thinly veiled cynicism which
!s not always Intelligible, appear to be of
greater literary value than the otheru.
A careful perusal of the book Justifies
the statement that the writer of a auo
cessful novel Is seldom capable of turn
ing out good short stories, and vice versa.

This Is a hook of short stories written
for lovers of the noble steÂ«d by one who

AS A BOY SAW SAN FRANCISCO IN 1851.
IDO not. suppose that there is a
single girl or boy who reads the
Children's Fage of Jhe Call who
i? not interested in the Golden Jub
ilee.
They all know what it 13 about, of
courseâ that we are celebrating the fif
tieth anniversary < f an event which
made California known as the "Golden
State" all over the world. They know,
too, that all the o*d pioneer and all the
Native Bona and Daughters, and all
the adopted sons and daughters, and all
the grandchildren of the State are very
proud of their home and its history,
and anxious that the Jubilee shall be
a grand success. So while the older
people are busy helping the matter
along:. I will tell the younger ones how
Sar. Francisco looked to me when 1 first
came here.
I was a Iktle boy not 10 /ears
â when my farther decided :â > move from
New York Citj t this place. It took
forty days to make the . which
is a pleasure trip now, and live days
and a haif of that time were spent in
crossing the Isthmus of Darien, where,
except when crossing tin a and
Bailing down the Chagres rivers, the
children of the party were carried
along in chairs strapped to the backs
of black men, none of whom wore
more than a hickory shirt and a ban
dana handkerchief tied around hla
neck.
My first impression of Californians,
or at least of their dress was gained
on the Chagres. Our boat passed the
bodies of three drowned men lluating
on the water, all wearing dark panta
loons and two having on red and one
a blue shirt.
"What are tho.=e?" I asked the man
â who was hirr-d to go with us because
he could tÂ«lk our language, and that
of the natives also, and could manage
our business with them, and he an
swered: "Those are Californians who
were going back to the States with
their piles and were probably drowned,
as often happens, by the capsizing of
their canoes."
Often sine then have I thought of
those drowned men, and the families
in the East who never knew the fate
of the loved ones that came to this far
off new country to earn money for them
and died while taking it home.
It was forty-seven years ago in the
early part of January that 1 first saw
the city of San Francisco. We came
up from Panama on the steamship Ten
nessee, one of the old line side-wheelers
that made the voyage in fifteen days,
and instead of coining straight into a
dock, as steamers do now, she cast an
chor some distance from shore, off
what was then known as "Clark's
Point." This same old Tennessee, by
the way, was wrecked two years later
near the North Heads'.
San Francisco was a queer-looking
place at that time, very different from
the big city from which I had come,
and the people looked different from
New Yorkers, too. I could see them
from the deck, going about on shore,
and they were all dressed like the poor
fellows in the river, wearing red or
blue shirts, dark trousers held up with
red or blue silk sashes and yellowish
brown sombreros, or else white Pan
ama straw hats.
The houses were ail small and built
for use instead of beauty. Many of
them were only shanties, and there
â were a number of tents scattered round
among them, and the whole town
looked very strange to me, used as I
was to the large buildings and hand
some streets of my Eeastern home.
On the eastern slope of Telegraph
Hill, where the work of cutting down
Its sides for ballast and to make room
for streets and warehouses had not yet
been begun, were quite a number of
hastily and roughly built houses,' and
on the top was the telegraph station,
â¢with its tall flag-staff, on which were
gTeat black arms that signaled to the
city below the arrival of vessels. ~ To
ward the south in the direction of La
Punta del Kincon the shore looked very
unpleasing, and the whole view made
me very homesick, so much so that I
told my parents: "I don't like this
place; I want to go back!"
When the time came to go ashore we
were taken over the ship's side into a
small boat, and rowed to a little wharf
not more than 200 feet long, which jut
ted out from the corner of Battery and
Vallejo streets and ended In a short
flight of steps. The distance from the
steamer was, about- three blocks, but
the boatman charged ten dollars for his
service.
Once on shore I became more home- *
sick than before, for ther^ were no
women in Fight and not a boy or girl ,
in the crowd at the landing. We were ;
to go to the house of some friends who
had come out about two months earlier
and we rode from thÂ« wharf through
the unpaved. unplanked, muddy streets
up to the r?sio"enee part of the town
near Stockton and Vallejo streets, seat- ;
ed on our baggage in an old-fashioned

two-wheeled dray. Our friends' house
was like all the othersâ very plain in
both looks and furnishing*, and the
chairs were rough benches, with I
and everything else to match.
That first supper in Pan Francisco
was of my providing 1 , ami was a sur
prise to every oneâ a double one as it
turn.d out "When 1 left the Bhip the
;rd. who had taken a gn
to me, grave me a little box and told me
to carry it carefully and not to open it
until I reached the house where we

were going. On opening it there I found
the contents to be three pi<s and three
dozen eggs, and my mother took a
dozen of the eggs and made an omel
ette of them. It was very good, but
we had no idea how good, until just as
we were finishing it our host asked if
we realized what our supper had cost.
The answer was: "Not murh, cer
tainly, for the steward gave those eggs
to the yo-ungster."
"How many did you use?" was the
next query. Only a dozen," was the
response.
"Well, then," said our friend, "we
have eaten just twelve dollars' worth,
for eggs are worth one dollar apiece
here." .
"Great heavens!" exclaimed father,
"why didn't you tell us that before?"
We had no more omelettes for a while,
for the twenty-foUr fges whjrh were
left were turned into cash without de-
lay.
The next day after our arrival T wont
out to walk and saw Mont gorm*ry and
Kearny streets, %\hich were the (â¢â !>

was a favorite residence portion of the
city. What sidewalks there wen
narrow, built of rough boards, and very
irregular, some parts being thr>
higher than others with steps connect
ing them, for the streets wt : â 
graded at all. Where there were no
sidewalks and it was very muddy
there were generally boxes set along
like stepping stones.
It had rained a few days before we
landed and the streets were over ankle
deep .with almost liquid mire. Mont
gomery was almost Imp .'spe
cially in the wagon tracks, and people
wishing to cross the streets would
pick up cases of goods from :;i front of
a store and make crossings of them,
the owners of the goods oever offer
ing any objections, though l( would
probably have made no difference if
they had. since people did about as
they pleased in such matters then.
One day I slipped off one of those
stepping boxes, and being small sunk
down to my knees in the mud. A big,
red-shirted man pulled me out, but In
doing so pulled me out of my boota
also. Those same boots were my pride*

T have a very vivid memory of the
first execution by the Vigilance Com

in those days and everybody went to
see them.
I was not allowed to spend all my
time in idleness, for after a few
months, during which quite a number
of children had come to the city. I was
sent to school. The school bouse was
a dingy >>id building on the c. ; st sid"

THE ENCHANTED MINE.
( ( / I \ ELIj us a mining story. Uncle
II I Jim â "
The veteran miner smiled in
flulg^ntly at his nephew. Henry
_X. Hargpod, who had asked him
for the story, and Kitty, his
little niece, who seconded her
brothpr's request.
"Did I ever tell you about my enchant
ed mine?"
"No; tell us that story."
"Well," said Uncle Jim, "I found the
mine during the summer of '62. I had
been prospecting all over Nevada County,
having mixed luck; but I never struck it
very rich until I found my enchanted
mine. Billy Carstairs and I came here
together In '43. and we were partners for
a Inns lime. Il>- LT'-ru-rally was with me
when I wu.s oat prospecting, but be took
!!;â¢â  fever, WBM w.iy, and I was atone
whon I first saw the enchanted mine."
"But why â ;â¢( you call it the enchanted
mine, Uncle Jim?" asked Kitty.
"You will see as 1 go along. Well, I
started out of what isÂ« now the pretty
town of Grass Valley, on a bright May
morning. The air was fresh and sweet.
the trail was bordered by wild flowers,
the birds were all singing, and your Uncle
Jim was In fine spirits. 1 had no very
clear idea where 1 was going. Tim Mul
'.â¢i-y. who had picked up a- fortune without
knowing a thing about mining, told me
that he bad a dream about a big spring, i
under some eottonwood trees, by a creek,
the sides of which were lined with gold
and which was boiling op bo strong that'
it was bringing up little nuggets and gold j
dust, to line the bottom.
"Tim was a dreamer and the boys all
naturally laughed at him, but I recollect
ed that before Tim picked up the nuggets
that made him rich, he told me that he
had a dream thai â â¢â¢ was going to find
them. Sure enough, the very next month
he came into his tuck. 80, when he told
me about the boiling spring that was
llaed and floored with pure gold. I was
Inclined to give the dream a try. Tim Bald
that if I found tho spring be would not
claim it. Besides that, I wanted money to
send east -for your Aunt Jane, who was
living then In Massachusetts,- on Marthas
Vineyard, to bring her to California.
"My partner. Billy Carstairs, did not
laugh at me because I thought that there
might be luck in Tim's second dream, but
the other â we .were all boys then-
Joked me a lot. None of them wanted to
go with me, and that was why I started
alone. I had a good rifle to shoot game
with, and my mining outfit and enough
grub, added to the other things, to make
my load heavy enough so that I would
not travel many miles, up and down the
mountains, per day. Tim did not dream
out whether the boiling spring was ten
miles or one hundred miles away.
" "Yon must trust yourself entirely to
luck,' Tim said, 'or, as sure as you are
alive you'll never find It, Jim.'
"I had. been out two days without seeing
ang cottonwood trees over a spring, when
I ran across the biggest grizzly bear I
ever saw. Perhaps it would be better to
say that he ran across me, for ho was
trotting down the trail In my direction
as I was toiling up the grade. We both
ran In a minute. - ThÂ« boar was fright
ened and so was I, and we went in op
posite directions. Before I stopped I
had lost the trail and was in the mouth
of a narrow canyon, with straight up
and down walls, the tops of which seem
ed to almost reach the sky. Through the
canyon ran a stream of sparkling- water.
"Now, your Uncle Jim had passed over
the mountains several times and thought
that he knew all â¢ the country within
miles of the trail; but I had never heard
of this canyon before. Anyhow. I was
clear of the bear, and something prompt
ed mo to go on. So I tramped up the
canyon several miles. When it wns
night I decided to go Into camp. I was
pretty tired and did not notice what sort
of trees I was under until I had finished
my supper. Then I filled my pipe and
lay on my back, smoked and looked up
â¢Well, well." I said, 'sure enough here are
cottonwood trees. ' It was too late then
to look for the boiling and gold-lined
spring, but my heart gave a thump as I
thought that perhaps I was going to
find Tim's dream true.
"The thought excited me so that I
could not^leep for pome hours. Finally
my eyes closed. But hardly had this
happened, as I thought, when I awoke.
To my astonishment the sun was high
above the canyon, so that l knew it must

up. ate a crust of bread and began to
starch, with all haste possible, for the
enchanted mine. Less than half a mile

handsome homes in San Francisco; no

my first thought was that, as there was
nior>- in sight than I could carry
away without help. I would dig a hole
and bury my treasure out of sight before
I proceeded t.. search further. I stuck

brass. Everywhere were !>>widers and
ledges from which I could pick out al
most pure gold. Yon may have heard
about the joy of burping money. Well,
i was so beside myself with excitement
that, in pure recklessness. I rolled bowl
der after bowlder Into tho creek, every
â ' which was worth a fortune, and I
saw them pink in the water out of sight
without a sigh or care.
"Pretty soon 1 noticed that tho water
in the creek began to rise, and an idea
came to me. If I could dam up the creek
1 would have de. p wat<T in which to hide
my treasures. By the end of the week,
working all that my strength would per
mit, I had a complete dam made, every
stone of which was tilled with treasure.
That dam was worth $100.00.1.000 of the
Bank of California's money. At the close
of my work on the dam I wns tempted to
ick to Grass Valley t<i get help to
carry out the gold; but the more I
thought the more 1 believed that it would
be better to stay where I was. fence in
enough of the claim and wa.it for some
one to find ni<Â».
"The next day I began to fence In the
claim, and I carved on several tree limbs
the fact that I was the owner. Then,
having nothing Mso to do, and finding
many fiat stones in the bed or the creek,
I built mo a house. Never before or
since was there such a building. It was
more gold than stone. I sat on a stone
bench that sparkled with the precious
metal and ate from a gold-inlaid table
that was worth the ransom of a prince.
I did not wish to draw strangers by fir
ing a gun, and so learned to kill game
with stones. Often I threw away $500
worth of gold before I could hit a bird
for breakfast. My practice before I
coyld hit anything cost me hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
"Altogether I lived at the Enchanted
mine three months without seeing any
one. Then my curiosity prompted me to
dig up the boiling spring. That was a
fatal mistake. I stirred up a what do
you call Itâ a genius? One of those queer
people who doesn't act like any one

CRUISE OF THE CALIFORNIA.
[Synopsis of preceding chapters: Pinnle has
been carried off a captive by Ghoor-Ghee-Tee,
the Chief of the skull-hunters. After drag
ging Binnie and a party of savage captives
through the forests until they are worn out
and can no lonKer be made to run by
beating with rods, Ghoor-Ghee-Tee makes
a camp beside a river. Kemona. the Aub
tralian bushman, following the trail many
miles, derides to float down a stream that run
into the Marwise River, and he hollows out the
trunk of h tree and proceeds. He finds that
he must either fro over a great waterfall, in
the darkness of night and at the risk of his
life, or give up the chance to save Elnnie. The
Australian takes the fearful leap through the
raging waters and passes safely through the
whirlpool below the waterfall. He then goes
alone to rescue Binnie from the camp of
Ghoor-Ghee-Tee.]
CHAPTER XIII.
KEMONA stole toward ihe camp
of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee as silently
as a shadow. From his hollow
war club he took a belt, filled
with ammunition, and into this
he thrust his four loaded re
volvers. He took his long, keen bladed
knife in one hand and in the other held
the stout war club. So he was ready
for the fray.
But Kemona wanted to save his am
munition if he could, thinking that, on
the long backward march to the lagoon
where he had left the California, there
might be need of it all, for he must
count upon meeting roaming savages
and he and Binnie must kill game for
meat. He could easily have shot
Ghoor-Ghee-Tee. His plan was to lib
erate not only Binnie but all the sav
age prisoners, and he pushed forward
full of this purpose.
The slaves of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee sur
rounded the camp fire. The prisoners,
including Binnie, were near the fire,
and the light of the burning boughs
made it impossible for them to rise to
their feet without attracting the notice
of the savages who were standing
watch over them. Kemona was not
long in reaching a decision when he
noticed this.
"There is but one way," he said. "I
must go boldiy forward to the fire and
take the chance that the savages may
see that I am not one of their tribe.
But firstâ"
By this Kemona meant that first he
must find some way to break through
the line of guards without giving an
alarm.
He circled slowly about the camp,
â¢x.^rriPing great care, for he knew that
the savages had sharp eyes and sharp
ears, and that the least accident, like
the snapping of a iwig beneath his
feet, might ruin all. He wished to find
a savage Just about his size, and then â
Suddenly he saw the man he was
looking for. He replaced in the war
club all the pistols and the knife. Then
he crept quietly forward with the club
in hand and crouched behind a bush.
Then he waited, patiently, for the sav
age guard to pass him. There was
danger that a struggle with him would
alarm the camp, but he must take the
chances. Kemona was crouched, like
a tiger, to spring. He breathed a deep
sigh of relief as he saw the savage lie
down and prepare to sleep. Half an
hour later Kemona had gagged and
bound the savage and boldly he walked
to the fire.
Binnie was awake. He was thrilled
with surprise as he saw Kemona,
whom he knew at once. Kemona, un
der the pretense of fixing the fire,
which he poked with his club, managed
to get the share knife from it and to
drop it in reach of Binnie. The lad
pushed the thongs that hold his wrists
against the blade and was freed.
"Ugh:" said Ghoor-Ghee-Tee, slow
iy waking up, "I dreamed the white
men had come."
Binnie hastily covered up the knife
with his arms and waited while Ghoor-
Ghee-Tee looked sharply about the
camp. Kemona had gone outside of
the camp as soon as Binnie had the
knife, and so the chief did not see him.
Ghoor-Ghee-Tee was not satisfied un
til he went among the prisoners and
counted them. It was an anxious min
ute for Binnie when the chief stood
over him, for the knife might be seen.
But the blade was out of sight.
Kemona, now having a revolver in
his hand, glared at the chief from the
darkness, and any hostile movement by
Ghoor-Ghee-Tee against Binnie would
have been answered at once by a bul
let. Ghoor-Ghee-Tee kicked several
slaves, to keep them wide awake, and
went back to sleep, without having
made any discovery.
Kemona was encouraged that he had
heen successful so far. Like a lynx
he watched Ghoor-Ghee-Tee. So did
Binnie. A half hour passed before it
was safe to make another move. To
Binnie it seemed an age. But then
the chief slept. Without attracting
the attention of the guards Binnie
managed to cut the bonds of the sav
age captive next to him. The savage
was quick to learn and he freed four
of his comrades before any of his
guards took an alarm.
When a shrill shriek told Ghoor-
Ghee-Tee that there was an enemy
thing, and it was all dark. The next
thing I knew a doctor was standing over
me saying, 'He will pull through now.'
And your Aunt Jane was there crying as
if her heart would break."
"But the genie?"
"All brain fever. I never went out on
the trail at all, but Carstairs did, and ho
made enough money for us both."
"And the house of solid gold and thÂ«
fortunes you threw at the birds?"
â¢ "All a dream, my children."
near, he leaped to his feet and seized
the ax with w hich he had won the vic
tory at the lagoon. He immediately
faced Binnie, who had Kemona's knife
in his hand. The guards closed in
around the camp, but the revolver in
Koraona's hands began to crack rap-
Idly, he firing with both hands. At
once a panic seized the savages, they
thinking that the crew of the Califor
nia were there. One or two fell. The
others fled with loud howls of fear.
Even Ghoor-Ghee-Tee ran away and
escaped in the darkness.
It was the work of only a few min
utes to free the other prisoners. Bin
nie had not been hurt. The captive
chief, whom Binnie had helped on the
march, spoke to his followers, and they
surrounded the white boy and each
fell on the ground on his face and told
Binnie that he would be his slave and
fight for him and serve him in every
tray. Then the chief, also, falling on
his face, took Binnie's foot and placed
it on his head.
It was still an hour from daylight.
Binnie and Kemona sat by the fire and
talked earnestly. Kemona told all
about his pursuit of the savages.
"When he spoke of shooting the water
! fall. Binnie looked at the Australian
with admiration and gratitude. Ke
mona was for starting back in the di
rection of the lagoon as f<>on as possi
i ble. Binnie shrewdly reasoned, after
talking with the savages and learning
that Ghoor-Ghee-Tee's country was
along the Marwise River, that Harry
Ostend was now sailinpr up the river, to
head the Skull Hunters off.
"We must go on," Binnie said de
cidedly. "There is nothing in turning
I back."
"But what have we to go on for?'
"Here is the nucleus of a small army
in these savages. We will go with
them to their own country. There we
will gather a sufficient force and try
to rescue the German who is a King in
the land near that held by Ghoor-
Ghee-Tee. Then we will go to the
Marwise River. Our friends will find
us in some way."
Kemona was able to understand all
that the savages said! He said that
it would be well to call the chief and
have a council of war. Hut he was
surprised at Binnie's bold and great
"How can we reach the Afarklse
country wh^-re the white man is king?"
! asked Binnie.
"Only by passing through the land
I where Ghoor-Ghee-Tee lives and
j reigns." .
"But how shall we pass.'
"White friend," proudly answered the
: savage chief, "in the land of the people
lof Mah-Coh-Gah are ten thousand
fighting men, who never fail to bring
! down an eagle on the wing with an
arrow; who- can. run all day and night
i and never tire; who are as terrible as
the whirlwind when they go out to bat
! tie; who will all burn with rape when
they hear that Ghoor-Ghee-Tee has
made our people prisoners and has kill
ed Mah-Coh-Cah. Ghoor-Ghee-Tee
knows this, and has run away that he
may get his tribes gathered. He may
| begin the war upon us himself, hoping
to surprise our people and burn- our
villages."
"How many fighting men has Ghoor
| Ghee-Tee?"
"They are like the trees of the forest
! for numfjer."
"What do- you think, Kemona?" ask
ed Binnie.
"We had better go with these peo-
I pie."
It was settled that the march should
begin as soon as daylight came. Koti.
which was the name of the chief, was
j much pleased when he heard this and
I more pleased when Kemona, who had
i served in the British army, promised
j to teach the. warriors of Kotl's nation
! to fight like white men.
The savages proved to be great run
ners an their march. Kemona found
no difficulty in keeping up. Binnie was
glad when Koti said, after traveling
several days: "There is my country."
Binnie was plucky, but tired.
Savages came across the party and
j told Koti of news that already the

HOW SCHOOL TEACHERS HELP ONE ANOTHER
IT -was as early as 1872 that the teach
ers of the San Francisco School De
partment began to realize the Im
portance nf organizing for the pur
pose of aiding one another In time of
need.- Ably engineered b'- Miss Kate
Kennedy, always a foremost progressive
Bpirit in school affairs, a plan was at
length perfected by which the San Fran
cisco Teachers' Mutual Aid Society, the
the first of the kind in the United States,
It le claimed, came into existence on May
18. 187S, Miss Kennedy being elected presi
dent.
This society does not pretend to be a
charitable Institution, but has adopted
the insurance plan and is conducted as
far aa possible on a purely business basis.
As its name implies, the organization was
formed for the relief of its sick or dis
abled members. That the society has
â¢tood the test of all these succeeding
years with undiminished prosperity cer
tainly proves its soundness and efficiency.
However, in 1889 it was thought best to
Incorporate. Accordingly on March 13 of
that year articles of Incorporation were
filed and the society waa transformed
Into a recognized legal body In accordance
with the laws of our State. Of the first
board of directors after this change Miss
Jessie Smith was president.
At the close of its first year th* so
ciety had forty-seven names upon its roll
and $2060 in its treasury. To-day the
membership numbers 400 and there is
$20,000 in bank. The society is paying a
higher rate of sick benefits than the Odd
Fellows or other organizations of the
kind. In order to become a member of
the Mutual Aid Society a teacher must
pay an Initiation fee of $10 and dues of
50 cents a month thereafter. In return
for this the society pays si'-k bene'H? of
$10 a week and also $75 toward funeral ex
penses. All Teachers, whether rich or
poor, receive these benefits alike.
When a teacner has been paid the maxi
mum sum of $300 during a spell of illness,
then, according to provision n the by
laws, he or she may further receive $5
per week at the option of the society.
The members of the society do not re
ceive benefits during vacation. In order
to draw their $10 a week teachers must
be sick five consecutive days, which con
stitutes a school week. To secure proper
observation of these rules the schools of
the city are divided into districts, and the
work of visiting sick members is placed
in charge of regular visiting committees.
One of these must twice a week visit the
teacher who is ill and the latter's claim
for benefits must be duly audited and
signed by the proper committees and the
president of the society.
The society annually elects a board of
EDUCATION OF YOUTHFUL MONGOLIANS.
The Chinese public school, of which
Miss Rose Thayer is principal, was
opened about ISB3. and to-day contains
five classes of 121 pupils, eight only being
girls.
The course of study Is the same as
that followed in the other primary
schools of the city. In the first grades
reading, writing, spelling ar.d arithmetic
are taught, and in the higher grades
language, geography and history, includ
ing the early history of the United States
and the biographies of Columbus, Wash-
eleven directors, and this board Is re
sponsible for the management of the
turds and the business of the society In
general. The latter Is transacted at the
semi-annual meetings of all the members.
The officer? of the society for the pres
ent year are as follows: President, Miss
Laura T. Fowler, one of the original
founders and a most capable and efficient
member, this being her third term of
office; financial secretary. Miss Nellie
Haswell; recording secretary. Miss Mar
grette Grote; treasurer. Miss Alice
d'Arcy.
At the last meeting of the society on
the 14th of this month a committee was
appointed to revise and republish the by
laws.

ing on June 8 those teachers already In- ]
terested In the fund organized as a sec
tion of the State Teachers' Annuity and
Retirement Fund.
The matter of the High School teachers j
becoming contributors to the fund has
been referred for decision to the District
Attorney. The difficulty lies in the read- \
ing of the law, which is not clear as to !
the position of these teachers in regard
to the fund. The law provides that the
County Treasurer shall deduct $1 from
the monthly warrants of teachers, to be
placed in the annuity fund; but as the
High School teachers are paid, not
through the County Treasurer, but
through the city, no method has aa yet
been provided by which the contributions
of these teachers to the fund can be rÂ«
celved by the County Treasurer.
If the decision of the District Attorney
Is favorable to the annuity fund a num
ber of the High School teachers will im- i
mediately Join.
As the City and County Treasurer of j
San Francisco is one and the same person !
this difficulty has not arisen here but it Is
hoped that an amendment to the law de
ciding the question, which affects High
School teachers all over the State, will
be carried at the next Legislature.

PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN NAPA COUNTY.
Though Napa County 1s small In area and population. It has been forging ahead In educational lines until the
work done has attracted the notice of educatorH throughout the State. Until IS9O the superintendent was not expected to
devoto his time to thÂ»Â» work of the office, and while the superintendents have in general been excellent teachers and
conscientious workers, thHr bent efforts have been devoted to the schools In which they have taught.
During the present administration, of which this article treats, there have been two high schools established, a
district school at Xapa and a union high school at St. Helena. In both of these a four-year course has been adopted.
F. O. Mower, formerly of the Oak Mound, is principal of the Napa school. F. J. Metsler. whose work at the Esparto
high school of Yolo County Is bo well and favorably known, was chosen as principal of the St. Helena school.
There are, besides the high schools, flfty-flve districts. Of these fifteen during the last year held a ten months'
school; sixteen from nine to nine and three-fourths months; three only falling below eight. The. salaries of thesa
schools range from $50 to $150 per month. Of the ninety-two teachers about 331-3 per c*nt have had professional train-
Ing in the normal schools or the universities of this State. The trustees are beginning to sea the wisdom of retaining
good teachers, as is evidenced by the long tenure of office.
The present superintendent. Miss Kate Ames, was elected In 1594. and with the beginning of her administration
came a new era in the method of work at the central office. From circular letters we have received, we judge that the
most important reforms have been along two lines. It is these reforms that have attracted most notice and which Miss
Ames was requested to present before the State Teachers' Association, which met in San Francisco In December. In
all of her attempts at Improvement the co-operation of the Board of Education, of teachers, and trustees has been most
gratifying.
As is the case in most school libraries, the books, while excellent, were not suited to tha age of the children.
Through a circular sent out during the first year, ami suggestions that have followed from time to time, some books
suitable to the age of children have been placed in nearly all the schools. At the same time the superintendent present
ed to the Board of Education the need of a course In supplemental reading. This was made out in December, 1895. and
Introduced Into the schools at the opening of the spring term. In this, also, the trustees deserve especial commenda
tion for their co-operation and material aid.
Perhaps the most progressive step is the course in professslonal reading. This Miss Ames has outlined and sent
to teachers as a suggestion for the year's reading. Last year this met with remarkable success. Though not compul
sory, many of the teachers did the reading and were ready to discuss the questions presented at the institute.
During the last year three books constituted the course: Historical, Quick's "Educational Reformers"; personal,
Rousseau's "Emlle"; classical, PestaJozzl's "Leonard and Gertrude." Besides these, teachers were urged to read the
report of the State Council and the three great reports of the Committees of Ten. Twelve and Fifteen. Other sug
gestions were made in reference to articles bearing on the books read. One day was devoted to this work, under the
direction of Dr. Thomas P. Bailey, at the annual institute
"Passing over the Important part that

Is a market for the products of farm and
dairy of a great part of the surrounding
country; it is a supply point for Imported
and manufactured articles in many lines

growing trade from across the Pacific and
around the continent, and it is the prin

new lines to your heart's content. But
Just here Is our main question: Why does
history prove so hard a subject for
young people and many adults also?
Is it not largely due to the smallness and
narrowness of their Individual experi
ence? Is it because our actual lives can
not possibly bring to us the thought and
activity of past generation!* that we turn
to history for expansion and enrichment
of knowledge? But to profit by this
knowledge our own lives must be touched

pathy between Hie present and the past,
and the broad avenues of history will
lead to a more complete and abundant
life and thought.
"Our school children do not take them
selves or their community very seriously.
They are not students in these lines.
Hero, then, is an imperative need for this
bridge of sympathy, and if needed for the
pupils how much more so for the teach
ers. At this point we may call to mind
th<> recent saying of Professor Griggs.
that we Influence our pupils not alone by
what we are, but also by what we try to
be. and that to be teachers truly we must
be students and learners as well.
"In order, then, primarily to advance
the thought and work of our schools and
of universities In history study, and If
possible to contribute something to the
general culture of our community, the
Teachers" Club proposes to form a sec
tion for work in local history. It mat
ters little who Is leader. The three m^in
points that will brine success are, that
each teacher interest Â»-d take up somo par

results of the work, and that a fresh
spirit of enthusiasm and belief in the

STRIKING CONTRAST IN RESULTS
REALIZED UNDER DIFFERENT SYS-
TEMS OF OLD LINE LIFE INSURANCE
Bow $5501.15 Was Saved Under Annual
Distribution of Surplus in
THE MUTUAL BENEFIT LIFE INSURANCE CO.,
As Against "20 Year Distribution," or "20 Year Tontine,"
in Tontine Companies.
The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of New Jersey is
one of the strongest old-line companies in the country. It was or-
ganized in 1845 as a purely mutual company, and, after having paid
over 1159,000.000 to policy-holders, has over $63,000,000 'solid assets.
It pays large cash dividends annually, thus giving solid insur-
ance at the lowest net cost.
During the seven years previous to 1897 the official figures show
that the Mutual Benefit saved (for benefit of policy-holders) more of
Its Interest receipts from investments above expenses than the four
leading tontine companies, viz., the Mutual Life, the Equitable Life
and the New York Life of New York and the Northwestern of Mil-
waukee all combined, and it is unalterably opposed to all forms of
gambling or tontine policies issued by such companies.
The practical advantages of the annual distribution of surplus
under the purely mutual system as practiced by the Mutual Benefit
Life Insurance Company of New Jersey are strikingly illustrated
below.
Every life Insurance contract which is to run for a long term of
years, or for life, must, in order to be safe for the Insured, name a
premium containing a margin over the present actual costs of such
insurance. Varying mortality, decreasing rates of interest, unfore-
seen expenses and losses incident to the management of every busi-
ness, make such provisional "margin" an absolute necessity.
The vital question then is: What is to become of this present
"provisional margin?" i^E.
Shall it go all to stockholders under the "stock" plant
Or in part to stockholders under the "mixed mutual" plan?
Or all into "the pool" under tne "tontine" plan?
Or come back all Into the pocket of the policy-holders in annual
settlements under the "purely mutual" plan?
In deciding this question the following case in point should be
considered: Mr. Adam Hersperger, the well-known founder of the
Chautauqua Lake Ice Company, insured his life in the Mutual Be-
efit Life Insurance Company of Newark, New Jersey, on April $9,
1876, under policy No. 85,612, for $10,000, ordinary life plan, age 56,
annual premium $621 00. Mr. Hersperger died April sth, 1895. HÂ«
had paid nineteen years' premiums. He was paid back his nineteen
annual "margins" or dividends, besides the policy.
His total cash dividends amounted to $3242 10. :\
His average annual dividend was $170 64.
His average annual payment was not "$621," but only $450 86.
The usual stock rate (no dividends) is $520 80.
The saving in cost In the "'Mutual Benefit'^ as compared with
stock rate in nineteen years was $1328 86.
The saving in cost as compared with "twenty-year tontine" or
"twenty-year distribution" was $3242 10. *
But allowing that moneys use in business is worth 6 per cent of
the principal, the saving on this basis as compared with the cost at
stock rate was $2502 87; the saving as compared with cost of
"twenty-year tontine" or "twenty-year distribution" was $5501 15.
The above facts clearly demonstrate: |,'^ ;â 
Firstâ That the "stock" plan greatly enhances the costs of In-
surance and adds nothing to the security of the contract.
Second â That the "mixed mutual" plan, in so far as it is tribu-
tary to stock, is not in the Interest of the insured.
Thirdâ the "tontine" plan raises still higher the enhanced
costs of the stock plan, charging excessive rates for long periods of
years, and meanwhile sequesters or side-tracks in "pool" and thus
exposes to total forfeiture all dividends and their accumulations.
Fourthâ That the "Purely Mutual" plan, returning to policy-

GARVANZA WORKS OF THE LOS ANGELES WATER PLANT.
The wooden box In the foreground is the so-called "collecting chamber" for the water supply gathered at Gar
vanza. This wooden "box is the only Indication ol a water-works system here. A llnÂ« of 15-lnch sewer pipes, 4
feet below the Burface! 1400 feet in length, enters the "chamber" at one end, while an 8 and 11 inch sheettron pipe
leaves the other end and conducts the water toward Pasadena avenue, and the Hazard reservoir in East Los
Angeles. The 8-inch pipe, 10,300 feet long, is utterly ruined by rust, has been abandoned for years, but is listed as
one of the valuable assets of the company. The 11-inch pipe is out of use for want of sufficient water at the
works, and is now disconnected from the pipe system. The box is nailed up and has not been in use since the city's
investigations were made. The lands surrounding these "works" are leased property, and the Los Angeles Water
Company places a tremendous value on the "rights to develop water" here on 1526 acres which include the town of
Garvanza. The average amount of water obtainable is ten miners' inches.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 22.â The syndi- |
cated company press of Lob Angeles '
have frequently referred to the large
and complete plant of the water com
pany, for which the corporation is !
seeking to bleed the people in the sum !
of about $2,000,000, or to secure a fifty- \
year extension of the lease and fran- j
chise.
The truth of the matter is that in no
city In this country is there a water
plant like the one which is used to dis
tribute water in this burg. The sys
tem is one conglomerate plan. It has
been added to and taken away from
during the past twenty years until now
it is made up of the most complete
mass of worn out, rusty pipe, rotten
timbered conduits and old broken

chinery in pumping stations that can
be conceived.
In the meantime the people in a city
of 110,000 people are forced to do the
best they can with a totally inadequate
service. Tet the servants and repre
sentatives of the people in the City
Council continue to follow up their pol
icy of delay, delay, delay, in bringing
to a head, or even taking steps to
bring to a head, the negotiations which
will do away with this unfortunate
condition of affairs.

Fpecial DlÃT>*tch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Jan. 22.â One of the most
daring acts ever perpetrated upon the
Masonic order has come to light
through the confession of the perpe
trator. George Fleming. His career has
been summarily ended through a con
viction and sentence to the State peni
tentiary at Walla Walla for two and a
half years for obtaining money under
false pretenses from Attorney Richard
son of Port Angeles.
Fleming is a pseudo Mason, yet so
skillfully has he applied himself that he
has been complimented by past grand
masters on his knowledge of Masonry.
By his own admissions, he has lived for
eight years on money borrowed under
false pretenses from Masons, the
amounts varying from ten to several
hundred dollars, or. as h*> told the ex-
Sheriff of King County, A. T. Van de
Venter, according to the circumstances
and the times. The total amount of
money thus obtained will probably
reach $20,000. but he has borrowed so
much he does not pretend to recite all
the instances.
He has traveled all over the world
and never spent a cent for railroad or
steamer transportation. He has had so
many aliases that he cannot name
them all. He wa* known in Mississippi
as Professor Willey, In Kentucky as
Alexander Craig. 1 n Pennsylvania as

BEAUDRY RESERVOIR PUMP STATION.
The frame building contains the pumping machinery for elevating water from this place to the high-level res
ervoir. This power station consists of one 60-horsepower boiler in fair condition; one 60-horsepower boiler in
dangerous shape; one ancient Worthington steam pump, subject to daily breakdowns and repairs, and a few small
feed pumps.
The ground to the left of the power station, surrounded by a lath fence, is one of the seven reservoirs so often
alluded to by the company's write-ups. This reservoir is empty, has been used as a horse corral, and is now doing
duty as a sump for collecting waste oil from the surrounding oil wells.
countries he passed himself off as Mal
lorey, Fleming, Willey or Ball. Once
in a while he went as John H. Kim
berley. In Paris he claims to have met
and dined with the Prince of Wales and
Sir Dudley Ward. For dessert he bor
rowed $150 from the Prince on the
strength of Masonry. In Madrid he
worked Minister Hannls Taylor for free
transportation to the Rock of Gibral
tar by the way of Cadiz. Things came
his way in every city in every country.
He wanted for nothing because he had
a snap on the Masonic fraternity. It
is admitted that this man, notwith
standing that he 1h not a Mason, knows
more about Masonry than thousands of
ordinary Masons. In this respect he
stands without a peer in the civilized
world.
At first it seems almost impossible
that Fleming could have fleeced the
fraternity so easily, but after reading
his confession the matter appears in
another light. The secret of his suc
cess lay In the fact that he knew all

about masonry and applied his know
ledge to the best advantage. Certifi
cates indicating that the dues of the
[ifrsun he represented himself to be
were paid were obtained at first in va
rious ways, but toward tht> last he had
an improved system. From a man
named Levy in San Francisco he ob
tained forged certificates, as few or as
many as he desired. They were cheap.
It was after the close of the war that
Fleming took up Masonry. He became
a member of a clandestine lodge, and,
by using the information thus obtained,
he gradually picked up point after
point until he could give nine out of
ten regular Masons information. By
applying to lodges where the officers
were careless, he obtained admission
Into regular lodges, and by close atten
tion became conversant with the rou
tine secret work. The Grand Lodge of
the Masons met in Seattle in the early
part of June, and during the session
several complaints were made about a
Masonic fraud who had been borrow-
ing money indiscriminately. The mat
ter was finally considered, and Grand
Master A. W. Frater of Snohomish was
Instructed to have the matter thor
oughly investigated. Frater took ex-
Sherlff Van de Venter Into his confi
dence. They took careful note of all
the complaints made, and arrived at
the conclusion that one man had been
doing all the work, and that man, in
spite of his aliases, was none other
than Martin Mallorey. Not only did
the description of the man confirm this
belief, but also the significant fact that
the man was always fleeing to avoid
arrest for killing a man in self-defense.
Letters containing a description and
a brief account of the system employed
by the man were sent to lodges In all
parts of the United States and foreign
countries. The result was astonish
ing, even to Grand Master Frater
and Mr. Van de Venter. In a brief
period they received over 100 answers.
Having satisfied themselves as to the
man they wanted they kept up cor
respondence in all directions with a
view to securing Mallcry's arrest the
first time he appeared in evidence.
Finally a telegram came from Daven
port, Wash., on Sept. 26, 1897, to the
effect that a man answering the de
scription of Mallory had been arrested
for a misdemeanor. It was then de
cided to swear out a warrant in Clal
lam County in connection with a case
where Mallory had obtained $4 from At
torney Richardson and others in Port
Angeles. Sheriff Walter J. Dyke depu
tized Van de Venter, who immediately
went to Davenport. Bure enough he
saw hi? old '"friend," Mallory. At first
Mallory denied everything, but finally
made a full confession.
In his confession Fleming recites his
experiences among various lodges in
Minnesota, Kansas. Kentucky, Oregon,
Washington, Pennsylvania. New York.
Nevada. Ohio. Illinois. Missouri and
other States in America, as well as in
foreign lands. In the latter part of his
confession he recites the fact that in
March. 1596, he was in South Carolina,
and adds:

NEWSBOYS FOR OPULAR RIGHTS.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22.â For a week now the sixty newsboys of
this city, united as a Newsboys' Union, have declined to sell the Ex
press upon the streets for the reason that they were compelled to pay
3 cents a copy, while to the public calling at the Express office they
were sold for 2 cents. Not one single newsboy has gone back on his
obligation not to sell the paper. The union at its meeting adopted the
following resolution:
Whereas, the San Francisco Call has demonstrated that it is a
fair newspaper, willing to give the news at all times, and Inasmuch as
it is a fearless defender of the people's rights; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the news boys of Los Angeles, through our or
ganization, extend to The Call our thanks and assure its proprietor
that we will make every effort to get his paper in the hands of the
reading public of Los Angeles. J. D. EMERINE, President.
The union meets in Council of Labor Hall every Friday evening and
its finances are in excellent shape for it has three months' rent paid in
advance. The union newsboys are almost all pupils of the public
schools and they announce that they will carry the fight against the Ex
press to the bitter end or until they can get fair treatment.

Convincing Evidence Given Against
the Suspect at the Coroner's
Inquest
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. HELENA. Jan. 22.â District At
torney Bell and Coroner Kyser, accom
panied by Attorney Thomas Derry, ar
rived from Napa this morning and pro
ceeded at once to the Town Hall to hold
the inquest on the body of William
Clark. The room was crowded to the
doors by a curious throng.
The District Attorney at once called
for Mrs. Lavlna Clark, widow of the
murdered man, who was the first wit
ness examined.
She said she was 46 years old. the
widow of William Clark and the
mother of saven children, one of whom
is married to George Dax. George
Clark, the accused man. had resided
with the family for a number of years,
but not during the past few weeks or
since the murdered man had found
poison in his coffee, George having
been ordered away from the premises
on suspicion of having attempted to
poison her husband. Her husband was
cheerful and happy on the evening be
fore the tragedy and did not have any
reason in the world for committing
suicide. She and her husband had a
conversation about religion that night,
but never entered into any argument
on that subject.
On the morning of the tragedy her
husband arose as usual to prepare
breakfast. She did not hear a pistol
shot, although it may have awakened
her. The first noise she heard was a
struggling and moaning. She thought
her son-in-law in another room mieht
have a nightmare, so went to the
kitchen to tell her husband to arouse
the son-in-law. Opening the door, she
found William Clark lying on the floor.
The body was in a perfectly straight
position, the head inclined to the left.
She then aroused her son-in-law,
George Dax, saying:
"I think Will is dying."
She thought he had a fit or spasm.
Dax turned the body over and found
the pool of blood on the floor and dis
covered the bullet wound. Then Mrs.
Clark exclaimed:
"Oh, he's been shot."
Her husband did not speak, but only
gasped. She then said:
"Will, won't you speak to me?"
But William Clark was past notice of
earthly things and soon breathed hi 3
last.
Mrs. Clark said that her husband us
ualy arose at 4:45. That she did not
know what time the alarm was set for
on the morning of the murder. She
said that her husband did not have to
go out after wood in the morning; the
children got it the night before. She
asked her husband why he arose so
early when he did not have to go to
work until 6:30 o'clock, and he replied:
"I want plenty of time."
He would sometimes sit and read be
fore leaving the house. Mrs. Clark us
ually arose before her husband left in
the morning. She repeated that the
murdered man had no motive for sui
cide; that he had been very cheerful
and happy of late years.
Mrs. Clark said that George Clark,
the accused man, was about 37 years of
age. She fir6t knew him at his uncle's28
place in Illinois, when he was six weeks
old. He was present at her marriage
to William, and was always with the
family more or less. Mrs. Clark and
her husband got along well the first
four or five years, but he did not seem
to have any affection for his children.
He said he loved them, but she could
see that he did not. He often cursed
his wife, yet treated the whole family
kindly.
Mrs. dark said that at the time of
her marriage to William she was
friendly to George. George told her
that William's actions proved he d>l
not love her. Her affections toward her
husband died, and she became more
friendly toward George and told him
that she loved him. They became un
duly intimate. She admitted that
George Clark was the father of one of
her children. Tho husband always took
his wife's part and did not seem to be
conscious of anything wrong.
William Clark came to California
alone twelve years ago, while George
and the family remained in the East
for a few months before following-
She said her relations with George con
tinued until seven years ago, when she
made a profession of Christianity.
George at that time also made a con
fession of faith, but it did not last long
with him. When he resumed his at
tentions she answered: "No, I am an
other man's wife and it is wrong be
fore God." He was not discouraged,
however, and tried to assault her and
sometimes succeeded. The last in
stance in which he was successful was
about a year ago. He made attempts
since then, and when she rejected him
he cursed her. She said she would call
an officer, and .he answered that he
would kill the first one who put his
head inside the door.
George Clark asked her if she would
marry him if William was out of the
way. She thought he would put Wil
liam out of the way to get her. She
answered that he should not commit
murder, and he said he would never do
that. About five months ago, before
George went East, he again asked her
if she would marry him if left alone.
At first she said: "Don't talk that
way; it is wicked," but finally she
said "Yes."
She thought he would remain in the
East, so said this at the last minute.
AVhen he returned from the East and
again asked her the question she would
not talk, because she loathed him. The
reason she consented at first was be
cause he had her under his thumb by
threatening to reveal her past life,
which she wanted kept a secret. Fin
ally she said she herself would go and
tell it to the whole town. He said:
"No, people would run us both out
of th<* town."
Her husband and George were not on
good terms and the latter was always
making trouble. George was alone in
the kitchen where the lunch pail was
kept the day before Williams discovered
the poison in his coffee. George was
whistling as loudly as he could, and
seemed to be walking around. When
George was told about the stry
chnine he said that William
wanted to commit suicide. George
heard William say about fifteen
years ago that he would kill himself,
and founded his theory on this. He
said that William wanted to commit
suicide, but did not have the heart to
drink the coffee. George said William
wanted to do away with himself be
cause his wife went around with Salva
tion Army officers, and told her that
she ran around with them too much.
George threatened to kill the captain
of the army, all through jealousy. Mrs.
Clark said she never saw her husband
have a pistol or cartridges in the
house.
Dr. Osborne was the next witness
called. George Clark lived in a cottage
on his place. The doctor was aroused
at 5:15 o'clock Thursday morning by
William Clark's two girls, who sum
moned him to their father's aid. They
said: "Papa is hurt. Some one hit him
when he was going out of the door."
The doctor found Clark dead, and then
went for the Marshal. Dr. Osborne,
with Dr. McCurdy, held an autopsy on
the body that afternoon.
Marshal Johnson said he was called
shortly before 6 o'clock by Dr. Osborne,
and went to the Clark home. He dis
covered the pistol on the porch and
suspected George Clark of the crime.
He then went in company with Dr. Os
borne and Charles Jackson to George's
room and placed him under arrest.
Noticing fresh mud on the man's shoes
he took charge of them, and had him
put on others. The Marshal asked
George if the pistol found on the porch
was his. He at first denied it, but on
arriving at the Jail he said:
"There is something I want to cor
rect. I did not tell the truth. That is
my pistol."
Marshal Johnson placed George's
shoes in the new tracks in the mud
along the course taken by the mur
derer, and they fitted in every instance.
The officer produced a box of cartridges
with only five missing, which compared
exactly with those in the revolver
found at the scene of the tragedy.
Peter York testified to having seen a
man running past him in the direction
of George Clark's rooms. The fellow
had an overcoat about the same length
as the one found in George's room.
Constable R. L. Spurr, Dr. Samuel
McCurdy, George Dax (Clark's son-in
law) and Mrs. Dax, the daughter of
William- Clark, were examined, but
their testimony only corroborated that
of the other witnesses.
The Jury returned a verdict to the ef
fect William Anderson Clark came to
his death from a gunshot wound, and
in the jury's opinion "such gunshot
wound was inflicted at the hands of
George W. Clark."
GEORGE CLARK DOES NOT
DENY THAT HE LOVED
HIS BROTHER'S WIFE.
One Question That the Suspect Refuses
to Answer When Interviewed
in His Cell.
NAPA, Jan. 22.â When approached in
the murderers' cell of the County Jail
this afternoon, George Wtllard Clark
was gazing meditatively through the
skylight above him. The huge mm
door swung back, but still the prisoner
seemed lost to all about him. Not until
spoken to did he turn his head. Then a
quick, piercing glance met the gaze of
The Call correspondent, and half-smil
ing, he said: "How do." He gave a
chair to his visitor, and moved himself
to the end of his cot.
Sheriff McKenzie stood by for a min
ute and asked him how he felt. He re
plied that he felt better than for some
time past and had slept nicely the night
previous â much better than on the first
night of his Incarceration. He In
quired about the funeral of his brother
and the outcome of the inquest. He
seemed particularly anxious about the
latter.
"I think that I should have been al
lowed to go to the funeral of my own
brother. I think, too, that I ought to
be at the Inquest," he remarked.
"You were not needed at the inquest,
and, as for the funeral. I didn't think
it safe to take you to St. Helena," re
plied the Sheriff.
"Why not?"
"Because the feeling against you ie
, pretty strong up there."
Clark dropped his head and nervously
tugged at his nails. The Sheriff then
! retired, leaving the prisoner witb The
Call correspondent. Clark was handed
a copy of The Call, which he pored over
, eagerly, reading aloud all that related
to the murder. Occasionally he would
smile, then he would frown.
"These pictures are mighty good," he
remarked. "I saw yesterday's Call, too.
and the pictures of myself and brother
are both fine."
"What do you think of the article
there?" was asked.
"Well. I was visited by a lawyer this
morning and he told me not to talk
much for publication. I will say, how
ever, that at my trial something start
ling will come outâ something that will
clear up the mystery of the attempted
poisoning. As for my brother's death,
I am convinced that he committed sui
cide. There was certain conversation
between him and me a short time ago
which bears out that statement, but I
will not repeat it now."
"How about the fresh mud on your
shoes the morning of the killing?"
"I was at prayer meeting Wednesday
night and got in the mud coming
home."
"The officers say they found tracks
leading from your brother's home In
the direction of your lodgings, and that
they exactly fitted your shoes."
"I know nothing about that." he an
swered, "except what I read in Thi
Call."
He then straightened up, and. look
ing the visitor in the face, asked:
"Say, do I look like a guilty man? Is
there anything of a monster in my ap
pearance or actions? No one but a
monster would slay his own brother,
and, as God knows, I am not one. I
am innocent. I am unjustly accused of
this heinous crime. I believe I shall be
acquitted, but if not the law can only
take the body. My soul will go to the
God who gave it.
"I am in a murderer's cell," he con
tinued, "but there is one pleasure for
me even here. I have my Bible, and
above me is a skylight through which I
can see blessed Heaven. Do you be
\ lieve," asked the accused man, lower
ing his voice, "that my brother's wife
; said what is credited to her in that
paper?"
' Undoubtedly she did," was the reply.
"And it may prove damaging. But is
the claim that you are infatuated with
her a truthful one?"
"As to that I will not say. That I
will speak of at the trial. Now, if you
will agree to print exac-iiy as I dictate,
I will give you an account of myself
prior to my brother's death."
It was agreed to, and Clark spoke as
follows:
"Last October I went back to my fath
er's in Wayne County, Illinois. I had been
corresponding with him for two years
about coming back to run the ranch.
I wrote to him that if he would send
me money for the trip and permit me
to keep Saturday as the Sabbath I
would come. I stated that I would not
work Sundays, either, if he desired it,
knowing him to be an ardent Metho
dist. He replied that I had better stay
among my Saturday people. Then I
wrote that if I didn't come home I
would go off to South America as an
Advent missionary and spend the rest
of my life there. We corresponded a
short time on the subject of the Ad
vent religion. Then I wrote my father
that Mrs. Clark and myself had a fuss
over money matters, and I begged him
for funds to come home. I owed Mrs.
Clark for board. I had about $30 com
ing to me for labor from Frank Rob
inson of St. Helena, and when father
sent me money I got this and paid my
board bill. Then I left for the East
and had the friendship of my brother
and his family. My brother and one
of his daughters, however, were a little
cold toward me.
"Father and I dln't agree, so I came
back on November 7. I stopped with
my brother again until December 8,
when they moved to their present resi
dence. They said they had no room in
this house for me to occupy, so I went
to 'batching.' I will fight this case to
the court of last resort."
There are persons in Napa who claim
to have known the accused at Chiles
Valley, this county, about nine years
ago. They considered him much of a
simpleton. He worked there on a
ranch, and it is said that he gave a
woman who was cooking on the place a
great deal of annoyance.

custody of the city officials, must have
been placed at the disposal of .inter
ested parties, was copied by some one
and palmed off to the unsuspecting
' reader as a fac-simile of the existing
plant in the nature of an 'authorized
statement' â of fancies, not facts.
"The descriptive statement abounds
with facts In keeping with the illustra
tions.
"It states falsely 'every feature of the
i system represents the most serviceable
material and mode of construction ob
tainable;' the true facts are: The pipe
system consists of old, deteriorated,
rusty pipes of wrought iron, sheet iron
and cement-lined pipes, aggregating 68
'. per cent, together with 32 per cent
of cast iron mains. The sizes
range from two-Inch, three-inch and
four-inch to thirty inches; of the
former there are 79 per cent, or over
1,286,000 feet, out of a total of 1.626,000
feet. The flumes are in bad condition
and need replacement by others; their
sizes are inadequate ff,T the present re
quirements.
"The false facts recited state that
'notwithstanding the unusually large
area for a city of its size, covered by
L.os Angeles, and, too, in spite of the
widely different altitudes the service
for all purposes never fails.'
"The true facts, as can be verified, are

simply a cry for a better supply for
domestic and fire extinguishment pur
poses. Every tenant on a street served
by a two-inch water main will cheer
fully subscribe to this actual fact.
"As stated, 'in all, 335 miles of mains
are used in this city.' As found at the
investigation, there are but 318.6 miles
of mains, conduits, tunnels, flumes, etc .
within and without the city limits. The
source of supply at Crystal Springs
seems to be the pet argument for rec
ognition of value, monetary and other
wise. It reads as follows: 'This spring
water comes from the snow of the
mountain ranges and bursts forth from
the gravelly soil pure and unoontami
nated by either animal or vegetable de
cay.' And again, in a previous state
ment in another Los Angeles paper in
an article entitled 'The Water We
Drink,' the writer of this article takes
us again to Crystal Springs and pro
ceeds to tell us of 'three springs, issu
ing as it were from the bowels of the
earth through thousands of feet of the
purest of solid loam sand.'
"We will cite in the following a com
ment upon this false statement made
by another engineer of this city who
has had the opportunity to investigate
with the eye and intellect of a trained j
engineer. He comments as follows:
'This is indeed a sc-nic revelation,'
and a person would need to possess a
fertile imagination and barren con
science to be able to say there was even
one spring. The fact is that Crystal j
Springs Is a misnomer, a christening
of that which was conceived in sin at
the organization of the Crystal Springs i
Land and Water Company, whose real ;
existence, outside of the Los Angeles !
City Water Company, is a myth. The
development of millions of gallons ;
of water at this point is an un- j
truth; the whole supply, with the ex- !
ception of possibly ten miners' inches,
coming by infiltration from the Los j
Angeles River, and is as much the cor- i
pus or body of the river as that which
flows visibly upon the surface of the
channel bed.
"The people of Los Angeles are receiv
: ing Los Angeles River water, the infil-
t ration pipes are totally interwoven
' with vegetable growth: &nimal contam
! ination as well is probable on account
' of the presence of surrounding graz-
I ing lands, whence this water is
derived. Swimming holes at Garvanza. j
â  and other so-called headworks and i

: able cleanliness of boys and men living
! in that neighborhocrd to the distinct
disadvantage of the people to whom
' such water is served after the perform
1 ance of such ablutions.
. "A comparison of similar fact? and
' fancies relating to the Los Angeles \VÂ«.
; terworks Company's plant could be
i drawn out at considerable length if
wanted. The above will no doubt suf
fice to place existing affairs in the right
, light to the reader.

SUIT FOR LIBEL
FILED AGAINST THE
LOS ANGELES HERALD.
Mr. Patton Will Not Submit to the Vilifica
tion From the Organ of the Ring Formed
to Loot the Southern City.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22â H. W. Pat
ton to-day filed his suit for $50,000 libel
; against the Los Angeles Herald. ThÂ«
attorneys for Mr. Patton are Works
& Lee, Davis & Winder and M. W.
Conkling. The herculean efforts that
are being put forth by the Los Angeles
City Water Company to save its combi
nation of newspapers and Councilmen
from going to pieces are now engaging
the attention of the community. The
blows dealt by The Call to the syndi
: cated newspapers and the public offi
cials who, by their treachery, were
seeking to deliver the city over to the
water company, bound hand and foot,
for another half a century, have had a
most telling effect.
What has aroused *tho people more
than anything else to the importance of
; activity in this matter was the exposure
i cf the well-defined plan of the corpo
ration to have its lease extended for a
period of fifty years. The people thor-
I oughly understand the corporation's
; policy in securing delay on the part of
the City Council in compelling it to pro
ceed under its lease on contracts. It
j is well known that the company had
j not and has not now any idea of turn-
I ing the plant over to the city at the
i expiration of its lease. By the con
! nivance of its tcils in the City Council
and with the assistance of other public
servants it was proposed to deliber
ately place the municipal water rate
payers in the power of the water com
pany for fifty years longer, and then
the cinch would be complete. The three
â  daily papers were to give to the trai
tors in public office who would thus be
tray their trusts all the protection <hat
could be afforded them.
But The Call has stepped into the
breach and exposed this nefarious plot,
with all of its attendant infamies, and
! the fat is in the fire. Such an aroused
I sentiment among the whole people has
! never before been seen in this city. On
i every side the parties to this gigantic
i job are condemned. Of course, now
that the exposure is made, the syn
dicated dailies disavow connection with
' the scheme. It was not to be expected
: they would plead guilty to the charge
i of wanton betrayal.
It is only necessary to state in this
! connection that a certain party close
j to the water company, in a thought
' less moment said that as soon as the
extension c-f the lease was secured a
company stood prepared to give the
present stockholders $4,000,000 in cash
: for the plant.
This gives the lease and franchise, if
extended, a cash value of $3,000,000, f,-Â» r
the actual value of the plant is but lit
tle over $1,000,000. It was a large stake
the company, the allied press and the
traitors to the people, now holding c-f- !
fire at the City Hall, were playing for, j

the people were quietly permitting the
time for action on their part to go by
while every day of delay brought the
job that much nearer consummation.
In addition to the newspapers, the
peopSe are now after some of the indi
vidual members of the City Council
whose records on the water question
they do not approve of. F. M. Nic
kell is a Democrat and a member of
the Council from the First Ward. HÂ«j
is the chairman of the most important
committee in the Council, and just how
he got the appointment is a mystery.
The Council was organized against the
Democrats owing to the fact that Her
man Silver, the League for Better City
Government Councilman, holding the
deciding vote, acted with the Repub
licans. Nearly every import?. Nt com
mittee chairmanship that the president
of the Council had was given to a Re
publican, and the committees were ap
pointed on a basis of one Democrat to
two Republicans. But. of all commit
tees in this Council, the Water Supply
Committee was the most important,
and as chairman of this committee
President Silver named a Democrat, F.
lÂ£ Nickell.
In the campaign it was freely allege!
that Nickell had, during a previous
term in the Council and at a crith\ji
moment, failed of his duty in the mat
ter of purchasing land for central
works, yet with this taint attaching to
him President Silver reversed the or
der of things and named him as chair
man of the Committee on Water Sup
ply.
This immediately caused comment.
and ever since has been the topic of
discussion. Mr. Nickell has been a
strong and unrelenting advocate of de
lay, and in Councilman Charles H. Toil.
who Is also on the committee, he has
an unwavering supporter. At the pub
lic meeting of the Water Supply Com
mittee, which was hold some time back,
Mr. Toll stopped right into the ranks
and the opinion was expressed by some
present that instead of a Councilman
he acted the part ->f a paid attorney
of the water company.

The water company has placed a
lobby in the field to prevent, if pos

by the political or other organizations

on the part of the people of their

of the water fight through central
committees or clubs.

which absolutely controls its editorial

ever, the Herald is receiving the worst
drubbing. It is directly flying in the
face of the policy of the party as ex

Many Democrats have openly declared
in favor of holding a meeting of the

LONDON, Jan. 22.â Regarding the
semi-official statement made public hi
St. Petersburg to-day a semi-official
note was published in London this i
evening. It says:
"The British vessels which recently
visited Port Arthur merely touched
there in the course of their ordinary
cruises, and would naturally leave after
a short stay. The question of calling
and departure is one at the discretion
of the British admiral of the station.
In spite of the statement at the For
eign Office there is reason to believe
that the withdrawal of the British war
ships from Port Arthur is due to the
great Irritation in Russia at their pres
ence there and to the strong represen
tations of the Russian Government on
the subject.

the view of testing the facilities for

No wonder women weep. The wonder is
that they are not oftener in tears for all they
have to bear and suffer; and the saddest
thing about it is how little their sufferings
are understood. Even the doctor, nine
times in ten says : "Oh, a little nervous-
ness, that's all " or "neuralgia," or "insom-
nia," or "dyspepsia." If he suspects the
real cause he insists upon examinations and
local treatment, â about the very worst thing
possible to a nervous, overwrought woman.
There is no need of these repugnant
methods. Any woman may insure health
and strength in a womanly way by the use
of Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription. It
cures the weaknesses and diseases of the
feminine ' organism absolutely and com-
pletely. It was devised for this special
purpose by one of the most eminent and

THE LAUNCHING OF THE CHITOSE
Sentiment, Good Fellowship and Novelty Mark the Peaceful Event Which Joins Occident
and Orient In Common Cause.
Across the blue Pacific the land of
sunrise and the land of sunset have
Joined hands. The little brown man
of Japan and his Anglo-Sax<m broth' r,
with whom he struck hands at the
parting on Mount Causasus. met apain
yesterday at the festal board to greet
with warm clasp the reunion In the Oc
cident after the separation in the
Orient.
It was a time of peace which cele
brated an event In war. Around the
convivial board gathered representa
tives of commerce and protection,
while nation gave courtesy to nation
after an event which marked an epoch
in the history of the golden coast. Mid
speech and jest the bloody front of
battle was hidden in the rose leaves of
peaceful compliment, even as the white
winged emblems rose over the grim,
frowning monster as It glided down
the ways and cast off Its ties to land
to meet the waters of its future home.
The launching of the cruiser Chltose
from the yards of the Union Iron
Works yesterday was an event which
marks a fitting close to the semi-cen
tennial of California, After fifty years
of internal improvement, after half a
century of self-upbuilding, the great
commonwealth of the West marks her
Jubilee year with the work that unites
East and West and tells to all the
world that while the Golden State is
prepared to carry the commerce of the
nations on all the waters of the globe
she is also ready to send forth the ves
sels that are capable of insuring peace
and protection because of their power
to do harm.
As was said by the Consul of the
sunrise land in response to the toast
to his Emperor, the Scotts of San
Francisco have aided in the preserva
tion of peace by their ability to build
the engines of war, and in the event of
yesterday it was demonstrated that
the products of the shipyards of the
Western coast could stand side by side
with those of the whole world and re
flect credit to nation, commonwealth
and company whence came the mag
nificent creation destined to play an
important part in future historical
events which now seem brewing in the
far East.
Weil could the master minds of the
Union Iron Works sing with the an-
AS THE CHITOSE SLID FROM THE WAYS AND FLOATED PEACEFULLY ON THE BAY,
dent armorer:
The sword is the weapon to conquer
fields. â¢
I honor the man who makes it;
But naught is the man who the broad
sword wields
Compared with the man who makes it.
Yesterday was the Union Iron Works'
day. It was the day of the manufac
turer. It was the day when warriors
of flood and field paid tribute to the
brain which conceives and the hand
which executes the design of the broad
sword of nations â the battle-ship.
Details in the matter of launching
ships are always the same; there are
the same sturdy blows of the workmen
loosening the blocks; there is the same
blowing of whistles; the same firing of
cannon: the same shouts of the multi
tude. Hut in the launching erf the Chl
tose there was more than shipyard de
tail; there was sentiment, good-fellow
ship and novelty. The American cus
i torn of christening the new vessel with
I a baptism of wine was enhanced and
improved by the innovation of ' the
beautiful Japanese custom of loosening
white doves with the loosening of the
warship, thus indicating that while the
sullen vessel showed the front of war.
It was the surest method of maintain
ing peace.
As early as 9 o'clock yesterday morn
ing people began wending their way
toward the Union Iron Works and
! when the time arrived for the launch
â  ing of the vessel fully 4000 men and
women had gathered in the spacious
yards erf the company to see the event
; which was to bring in close union the
j two hemispheres. Miss May L. Rudd,
i upon whom devolved the pleasing duty
i of giving name to the magnificent ves
sel, was early at her post and as she
stood surrounded by representatives of
the Mikado's realm and the gaudily
attirod officers of her own State, she
carried out the dainty idea so beau
tifully interwoven throughout the en
tire proceeding that peace is best pre
served through perfection of prepara
tion for war.
Promptly on the marking of the mln
| ute there was an alarm of an electric
bell and the vast body felt "the thrill
of life along her keel" and started for
the element wherein she is to find her
future home. Simultaneously with the
i first start came the crash of glass, and
j the foaming wine rar> down to meet the
wave, while white dovep. released from
! their confinement, soared aloft, bearing
their glad tidings, as the dove carried
Its emblem back to Ararat during the
period of early naval architecture.
Then came the noise of jubilation â
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JAXFAEY 23, 1898.
the blare of band was hushed and
seemed but as a throb in the mighty
pulsation of sound as steam whistle,
cannon, bomb and other conglomera
tion of noise rent the air. Earth and
sky and sea seemed to join in one vast
acclaim over the completion of the task
and as the majestic hull split the wa
ters and rode gracefully upon the ws.ve
the vast multitude sent forth such a
synchronous shout of joy as can only
come from throats contracted b> >ent
up emotion.
All the while that the earth seemed
rent with tht* commotion of noise the
sky above played its part in the gen
eral celebration, for bombs of queer
make carried aloft strange devices in
blending colors, giving to American
eyes evidences of Japanese art in the
way of pictures in air. Flashing light
ning, raining stars of golden hue, giant
butterflies, writhing dragons, flocks of
strange birds and weird beasts hov
ered over the bay and crowned the
consummation of the work below.
As the Chitose rested calmly on the
waters the hum and ring of busy
workmen was resumed in the yards;
but another scene was presented in the
vast mold loft. There were gathered
together the guests of the Japanese
representatives and the men who have
proved their ability to cope with the
world in the matter of building ships.
During the serving of an elegant
luncheon there were toasts and senti
ments which brought together in closer
ties the two nations which stand fac
ing across the blue waters of the Pa
cific. Those gathered were joint guests
of the Union Iron Works and Captain
S. Sakurai. and Orient vied with Occi
dent in the extension of wishes of
goodwill between the nations.
Among the guests of the day were:

Governor Jeter. Police Commissioners

the day by appearing in full uniform.

MORELLIS SflD PLIGHT.
A Breaker of the Revenue Laws
Loses His Wife and Children
and Goes to Jail.
George MortUl of Mu.l Springs. Xl
Dorado County, committed an offtinsr
against the revenue laws of the United
-. and, us a consequence, more or
less remote, hC has lost his wife and his
property, sad will spend the next three
months In the County Jail In this city.
Mur in was convicted of defrauding the
revenue by d'.sti ing grape brandy with
out having procured the necesary license
and without having notified the revenue
authorities of his intention. When he ap
peared before United Btates district
Judge Â«le Haven for sentence yesterday.
Lawyer Lennon of the firm of Lennon &
Hawkins made a Strong appeal for clem
ency. Mr. Lennon informed the court
that his client had been oonltned in jail
awaiting trial since last November; that
since his arrest his wife had deserted
him and left their two small children to
tred for by strangers, a benevolent
widow having volunteered to take care
of the children until their father's release
from prison.
But this was not the worst of the tale
of woe. A hard-hearted creditor had
levied an attachment upon MorulU's vine
yard and distillery, and nil the prisoner's
"belongings hail been sold by Sheriff's
sale, so that Morelli will walk out of
prison a pauper.
Judge de Haven was evidently im
pressed with Mr. uennon's statement, for
tie imposed the light sentence of three
months' imprisonment in the County Jail
in this city and the payment of a fine of
$100.
A SADLY AFFLICTED FAMILY.
Mrs. Trumann Insane and Her
Children Suffering for Food.
A pitiful case of destitution and insani
ty wns called to the attention of the po
lice anil the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children yesterday. Mrs. Fan
nie Trumnnn of ~J>\ Natoma street wont
to the office of the Chief of Police and
complained that her children and the
neighbors were in the habit of throwing
perfumery on her. The woman's appear
ance showed that her mind was unbal
anced and she was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital, to await an investiga
tion as to her mental condition. As it was
certait) that she had children word was
sent to the society and Officer McMurray
was dispatched to the house, where hV>
found six little ones, the eldest of whom
was only 9 years of age.
Not a crumb of bread could, be found in
the house, and Inquiry showed that the
family was in the greatest distress and
suffering for food. The husband and
father is a hard-working mechanic in
the Union Iron Works. Several weeks
agQ he came from Oregon with his fami
ly In the hope that a change would bene
fit his wife's health. The woman's mind
has boen unbalanced for a considerable
time and he sold his farm in the Web
foot State and spent all the proceeds for
medical care for his unfortunate wife. He
had only enough money left to get to
this city, and since then he has struggled
against a most cruel fate. The Associ
ated Charities offered food to the woman,
but she. like many others in her condi
tion, refused, saying- that people took
tliis means to do her harm. The woman
will be taken before the Commissioners
in Insanity. Last evening Officer Mc-
Murray took the children and placed
them in several ehnritanie institutions,
where they will remain until their father
ran provide for them. From all that the
officer can iearn the father has done all
that he could to care for his family.
BIG GRAVEYARD NEEDED.
Doleful Prophecy for Dawson City
by a Californian Now in That
Section.
F. M. Gregory, a Contra Costa County
citizen who is now in the Yukon mining
region, has written to a Berkeley friend
detailing, his experiences in the frozen
north and giving his views on matters in
general and Dawson City in particular.
Regarding sanitary conditions Mr. Greg
ory says: "I <lo not believe that there
could be a more sickly or deadly place
for â  man to live in during the summer
time, the town being built on a low flat
and there being no sewerage. For those
who stay here a big graveyard will be
r.eedod next summer."
In illustration of the fact that there are
drawbacks to the alluring domain of
fabulous wealth, Mr. Gregory remarks:
"The man who comes up here earns his
money. His expenses are tremendous,
and the hardships and dangers are more
than anyone who has never been here
can possibly realize."
The writer also sounds a note of warn
ing regardlnsj the purchase of wildcat
mines and sayÂ«: "You will lose your
money just as sure as you stake anyone
to come in here and Invest in a claim."

Men Implicated.
Special Dispatch to The Cal!.
CINCINNATI, Jan. 22.â The Legis
lative Committee from Columbus con
tinued its investigation to-day into the
Otis bribery charges brought forward
in the recent election of a United
States Senator. Representative Otis,
who resides here, and who made thÂ«
charges, was not present.
Representatives Rutan, Spellmeyer
and Kinney of the House Investigating
Committee were in attendance, with
Senators Burke, Long, Robinson, Finck
and Garfield, during the examination.
Senator J. J. Sullivan is here with At
torneys Daugherty and Huling, repre
senting the defense.
It has been stated that Sullivan's
right to vote in the Senate on the re
port will be questioned on the ground
that he has been an attorney in the
case, but Senator Sullivan said if he
is disqualified Senators Burke and the
Democratic members of the committee
will be disqualified on the same ground,
and no report can be adopted.
Horace B. Dunbar, president, and
manager of the Gibson House, who
was examined at length last night,
was recalled. He produced further re
cords showing that Henry H. Boyce of
New York, H. H. Hollenbeck of Char
don, Ohio, H. H. Archer of Columbus.
J. P. Bliss, also of Columbus, and sev
eral others on both sides of the Sena
torial contest were guests at the Gib
son House from January 7 to 10.
Dunbar testified last night that H. H.
Boyce had used the private 'phone, and
that the conversations were taken
down at the telephone office in the gen
eral offices down stairs. To-day the
witness presented the unpaid telephone
bills of Boyce. By Boyce using the
private telephone in the Gibson House
the telephone company had trouble in
making out the bills. Those presented
to Dunbar for payment were produced.
These gave the records as to when
Boyce, Hollenbeck, Bliss, Allen O. Mey
ers Jr., and others in Cincinnati called
up Dick, Rathbone, Kurtz, Allen O.
Meyers Sr. and others in Columbus,
giving the time and charges.
Dunbar then testified further to

Finigan's Departed Wealth.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 22.â The battle for
the wealth that Colonel Peter A. Finigan
is supposed to have hidden away is on
again, and Judge R. EL Bigelow. acting as
counsel for Mrs. Emily H. Finigan, the
beautiful plaintiff, is on a still hunt for
alimony for his client.
During the past two weeks County
Clerk Thomas 8. Ponneau has received
through the mail mysterious Mated docu
ments pertaining to the Finigan case.
These documents have been found to be
depositions of various persons taken in
San Francisco with a view to unearth
ing the mysterious source of Colonel Fin
igan's wealth. When the collection is
completed, another onslaught upon the
Finigan citadel will be made.
Careful measurements prove that the
average curvature of the earth is 6.99
inches to the statute mile.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 23, 1898.
Calaveras County Is to arrive In San
Francisco this afternoon. At the ferry
it will be met by Colonel Young in car
riages and escorted In State to the Pal
ace Hotel, where a concert will be
played outside of the Golden Jubilee
headquarters. Next the members of
the ba^nd in their uniforms, consisting
of a miner's hat with its lantern, red
shirts and overalls, will march to the
business office of the morning papers,
where they will play. Finally they
will go to their headquarters at the
Rubs House. This hand, in its rough
and bright colored uniforms, will form
an attractive feature in the Jubilee pa
rade, as wel las in other festivities in
which it will render its services. The
members will accept no compensation,
but prefer to offer their services to the
Jubilee management in order to dis
play the energy and patriotism of thp
county and the mining settlements
which they represent.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 22.â Another
treasure ship from the north reached
Seattle about 6 o'clock this morning,
when the steamer City <>f Seattle, from
Dyea and Skaguay, slipped into her
dock. She had on board over forty
returning Klondikers. who had wealth
in drafts and gold nuggets aggregat
ing about $400,000. Among these arri
vals, the latest party to leave Dawson
started on December 18. They report
the food situation as practically un
changed, although the general feeling
is entertained that additional food will
be taken in over the passes early In the
spring.
Of the passengers on board from
Dawson, every man from the gold
fields brought down a sack of gold and
reported that he had struck it rich.
It Is said that nearly all those from
Dawson were men who had gone up on
grub stakes, and it was further stated
that not a single one of them failed to
obtain good claims. Although none of
them brought down such large sums
as did those on the Corona, a few days
ago, yet all were contented and dis
played sacks of dust and nuggets vary
ing from $5000 to $25,000 as "samples"
of what they had "up their sleeves" in
Alaska.
The most inportant information
brought down is that martial law has
been declared at Fort Yukon by Cap
tain Phil Ray of the Eighth Infantry.
United States army. It is reported
that he stood off a mob of 150 men
which had threatened to seize the food
warehouses of the Alaska Commercial
and the North American Trading and
Transportation companies.
Particulars of the affair were sent
from Fort Yukon to Dawson City by
Fred Gasch of Seattle, who traveled
for days over the ice at the direction
and under the orders of Captain Hay.
Gasch proved to be a hero in one sense.
A squad of the mob, numbering four
men, started to head him off on the
trail a short distance from the fort.
He heard of their plans and following
a circuitous route evaded them, and on
December 13 reached Dawson with
news of the trouble at Fort Yukon.
This information was given yesterday
by W. M. Hank of Oakland, Cal., who
was one of the passengers on the
steamer City of Seattle, arriving yes
terday morning. Rank left Dawson
December 16, after having had a long
conference with Mr. Gasch. He knows
Captain Ray well, and ventures the
opinion that the valiant officer has
been able to subdue the mob and to
maintain peace and order at Fort Yu
kim, although he is practically alone in
the district, having been accompanied
to Alaska by Lieutenant Richardson.
This is the story as brought to Dawson
by Gaach and repeated to Rank at
Dawson a day or two before the latter
cash. $10; Wilnerding, Lowe & Co., $10:

of $20,223 55.
The Jubilee committee is arranging
to give band concerts on Union square
on the afternoons and evenings of
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Fes
toons of incandescent lights will be
strung along hte walks of the park,
and theprogramme, as far as it is ar
ranged, will be given on Thursday by
the Calaveras band. On Friday the
Hebrew Orphan Asylum band will sup
ply the music, and on Saturday the
band of the League of the Cross will
furnish the music. The concerts will
be in conjunction with the floral dis
paly that will take place on those days
in the park.
At the Mechanics' Pavilion during the
coming week the exhibits, many of
which are at present either in a primi
tive state or not even commenced, will
be completed and ready for inspection
by critical ones already pondering on
the expenses of and the clothing neces
sary for their Intended trip to the
Klondike.
Representatives from CalaverasCoun
ty came down to the city yesterday to
deliberate with the management in re
gard to the exhibit to be made by that
county. Floor space, 30x50 in size, will
be assigned to the exhibit. It is to be
surrounded by a circular wall contain
ing some thirty tons of milling rock
from Calaveris County. Within the
wall will be at least 'sixty or seventy
tons more of milling rock obtained from
the Ttica, Plymouth Rock and copper
mines.
It has been decided that there shall
be a horse show day and night at Me
chanics' Pavilion during the session of
the fair. This will be in charge of Pro
fessor Bartholomew, who for thirty
years has been manager of a show
known as the "Equin Paradox."

On October 28 a mob of men number-
Ing nearly 150 approached the trading
companies and demanded that they be
| given a years supplies each on credit.
They represented that they were
without food; that is, in any consider
able quantity, and that it was the
l'usint-ss of the trading companies to
supply the inhabitants of the region.
When the representatives of the trad
ing companies asked what security the
men could give f<.r the provisions, they
replied that thoy would work in the
mines on the Klondike the next season
and reimburse the companies at the
i end of the season's work. The officials
"f the companies regarded this as a
deliberate attempt to hold them up.
Owing to the food situation in the dis-
I trict and to the known shortage at
j Dawson It was decided to peremptor
ily refuse the demands of the men, and
â  they were notineil that their request
j would not be granted. A consultation
! was h*~'!d in the meantime by the
authorities, and Captain Ray and Lieu
tenant Richardson were advised as to
the situation on the following day. The
mob caused notice to be served on the
trading companies that unless its de
mands were complied with and food
was. distritiuted according to their no
tions the warehouse of the two com
panies would be seized. This was on
October 29. The revolutionary demand
and its accompanying threat aroused
the officials of the trading companies
to the n*-r ssity for immediate action.

semble each evening, and well-attended
Bible readings are held each afternoon.
Many persons have already given public
evidence of a desire to lead Christian
lives. The sprightly music is a specially
interesting feature of the services. Dr.
Locke delivers short practical addresses
each evening. People are invited, after
the old Methodist custom, to go forward
and bow at the altar of prayer. The
meetings are announced to be held each
evening this week except Saturday. Dr.
Locke's subject for his sermon this even

THE PROGRAMME
Horses From the Burns
& Waterhouse Stable
Took Four Events.
Eddie Jones, a Morello Young
ster, Won the Shell Mound
Handicap.
Colonel Dan Defeated Stepabout for
Another Stake â Favorites
Beaten.
It was a bad day for the horses of
the Burns & Waterhouse stable at Oak
land yesterday. They only took both
of the stake and two purse racesâ that
was all. Handicapper Brooks must
have been purchasing bric-a-brac the
night before In Chinatown, when he
put 116 pounds on Eddie Jones, the
winner of the Shell Mound handicap
for three-year-olds, and Colonel Dan
raked in the Berkeley handicap for the
rulers of Emeryville. Banewor, a
daughter of the deported sire Strom
boll, favored, as all of the horses of
this stable are, drew the choice posi
tion In the two-year-old event and won
cleverly. She is a rare good filly. Osrlc
took the last race in a hard drive from
Sly.
Favorites won but two events on the
card. The attendance was the best of
the week, and the betting far above
the average.
A tip was so liberally* circulated on
<liihuahua that the gelding was sent
to the post an 8 to 5 favorite for the
first event at six furlongs. After get
ting away last he made a good run,
finishing third. Abina. a 6 to 1 chance,
ridden by Spencer, led all the way,
winning cleverly from Prince Tyrant,
a M to 1 shot, piloted by Cash Sloan.
The seven-furlong following was re
sponsible for another warm one. Road
warmer was played from 20 down to 6,
and after showing the way to the
stretch, began stopping, as usual, and
was unplaced. Koenigen, with little
O'Connor in the saddle, then took up
the running and at the wire led Dolore
out less than a length. Lucky Star,
the post favorite, astride which Mc-
Nichola tried to get through next the
rail and got pocketed the las* sixteenth,
was third, beaten but a neck. He was
undoubtedly the best.
The Shellmound handicap, over one
mile for three-year-olds, was the most
insipid affair of the season. Of the

CAREER OF A
VERY BOLD
SWINDLER

and through the Carolinas. I went to
California about June, and then came
back into Oregon and Washington,
staying only a few days in Washing
ton. Then I went into Oregon and went
from Eugene City to a lumbering mill.
There I got a horse, saddle and bridlo
and $10 from a man. I went from there
to Prineville. There I got $60 and a
better horse, and from there went ove?
the John River and from there to Win
nemucca. I made a flying trip to San
Francisco on the train and then tool?
the stage route, stopping at a few small
towns. Then I went by stage to Cres
cent City and then across to Grants
Pass. Then back I went by the South
ern Pacific to San Francisco, arriving
there three days before election. I
stopped at the New International Ho
tel, and in conversation with a bar
tender, who wore four or five badges,
while we were both half drunk, he told
me he could get a receipt for Masonic
dues in any lodge in the country. All a
man had to know, he said, was the de
grees. This man was a night bartend
er in a saloon within two blocks of the
hotel, but I don't remember the exact
location. I asked him what it would
cost me for the receipts and he replied,
'eight dollars for a dozen or two.'
"He introduced me to a man named
Levy, who was 40 or 50 years old, and
as well as I can remember kept a sec
ond-hand store; anyway there was all
kinds of goods in it. I paid Levy $13
for four receipts, which he filled out
under the following names: Martin
Mallory, George Fleming, Professor
Willey. and William Ball. Out of the
$13 $10 went for the receipts and $3 for
sealing. After securing the receipts I
took a steamer to Victoria, B. C, and
then went to Tacoma. From there I
went to Oregon and then back to Pug-?t
Sound and finally to California, where
I remained most of the time until
spring. I was in many different places
in California, borrowing money as I
went from place to place. I remember
getting money at Marysville, Sacra
mento and San Jose."
Struck, by an Engine.
"W. R. Hosmer is employed in a stone
yard at Tenth and Townsend streets, and
while crossing the railroad track yester
day afternoon he got too near a shunting
engine. He was knocked down, and. for
tunately, fell clear of the rails. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where it
was found that two of his ribs were frac
tured and his nose, back and sides were
contused.

FOOTE STILL
AFTER SHEEHAN
An Expert Appointed to
Examine His Ac
counts.
The Ex-Secretary Again Re
fuses to Surrender His
Bankbook.
A Threat of Appealing to the Courts
Does Not Affect Him In the
Least.
General John F. Sheehan, ex-secre
tary and treasurer of the Yosemit*
Valley Commission, returned from Sac
ramento yesterday and had a short but
very unpleasant Interview with Com
missioner Foote. Sheehan refuses to
surrender the bank book showing a
part of the accounts of the receipts
and disbursements of the commission
during the time he acted ar secretary
of the board on the ground that the
book is his own private property until
after the outstanding vouchers are pre
sented and paid at the bank. Commis
sioner Foote is equally determined to
get possession of the bank book and
declared yesterday that he would
swear out a warrant to recover it if
Sheehan continues to Ignore the de
mands made on him for its production.
Messrs. Clinch, Givens and Foote, of
the commission, met yesterday morn-
Ing to take action in regard to the ex
perting of Sheehan's accounts. Shee
han, accompanied by his attorneys,
Messrs. Clunie and Bridgeford, attend
ed the meeting, but, acting under the
â  of his counsel, Sheehan had but
litile to say. lie stated, however, that
ca had been forwarded to everyone
Qg a claim against the commis
sion. "I am not indebted a cent to the
State of California or any one else,"
; Sheehan.
When did you put the money up?"
â  ' 'â¢ inmissioner Foote, rather an
grily.
.Shfcfhan's legal advisers motioned
him to remain silent and the question
was not answered.
"When are you going to surrender
the bank book to the commission?"
asked Foote.
Sheehan again, a.. ting under instruc
ts in. iit-<'!ined to answer.
"mi motion of Commissioner Foote It
wai then decided to call a special
Ing Cor ri.-xl Friday afternoon, and
Francis El Beck was appointed to ex
pert Sheehan's accounts in the mean
time.
Expert Beck called at the office of the
commission yesterday afternoon to
look over the books and accounts kept
by Ph^ehan.
"Where is the bank book showing the
receipts and disbursements?" asked
Beck.
"General Sheehan still retains It," re
plied Secretary Lermen.
"Then I cannot proceed with the
work." said Beck. "I must first know
what money has been placed in bank i
and how much drawn out."
Sheehan entered the office at that
Juncture and was informed by his suc
cessor that it would be necessary to
have the bank book to facilitate the
work of the expert.
"The book is my private property for
the present." replied Sheehan.
"I am getting tired of this tomfool
ery," exclaimed Foote, "and I advise
you that you had better surrender that
bank book."
"I am acting under the advice of my
attorneys," replied Sheehan.
"Well, if you don't surrender that
bank book so that the expert can look
over these accounts," said Foote. rather
sharply, "you will be sorry for it."
Foote then withdrew from the office,
leaving Sheehan, Secretary Lermen and
Expert Beck to discuss the situation.
Sheehan explained that he needed the
book until all the outstanding checks
had been paid. He said that he would
then willingly surrender it. Expert Beck
then had his say. He claimed that
until he knew how the bank account
stood, he would be unable to make a
report from the books.
After half an hour's discussion, the
expert started to leave the office, de
claring that the hank book was neces
sary to conduct the examination. "Un
til I have the book," said he, "I cannot
proceed."
Commissioner Foote entered the room
; Just as Beck was withdrawing.
"Everything satisfactorily arranged ?"
he inquired.
Secretary Lermen answered that
' nothing could be done until the book
was produced.
"I now make formal demand on you
for the bank book," exclaimed Foote
rather excitedly. "If you don't sur
render it. I will try the efficacy of a
warrant."
Sheehan started to explain his posi
tion, but Foote would not listen to him
and left the office.
There the matter stnnds.
Rheehan says he will not elvp up the
book until all the outstanding checks
are paid and Commissioner Foote is
: equally emphatic in declaring that the
j book will have to be forthcoming.
"The threat of Commissioner Foote
to swear out a warrant does not bother
me in the leapt." said Sheehan after
j leaving the office. "My accounts are
! perfectly straight, and knowine that,
threats do not disturb me. As I stated
at the meeting this morning. T do not
owe a cent to the State or to any one
; else. I am holdintr the bank book â¢'im
ply as a matter of self-protection. There
nre cher-ks outstanding and when they
are pnid I will clos" the account at the
| bank. I conducted the business of the
' office on the same lines as my preile-
I cespors. There is nothing in the law
setting forth how demands must be
; paid by the treasurer of the oommis
; sion. ITe can pay them by check,
I money order, or cash. That, is discre
1 tionary with him."

Professor Brown of Berkeley
Speaks on Secondary
Education.
Ridicule for the Present Method
Teaching Beading in the
Public Schools.
Professor Elmer E. Brown of the de
partment of pedagogy of the Univer
sity of California gave the second ad
dress yesterday morning at Berkeley
In a series of "Studies on Secondary
Education." In his address he said:
One of the most important ques
tions arising from the vexed prob
lem of secondary education in
California is, should the high school
course for those intending to go into
universities be the same as for
those who Intend going no further
than the high schools? This is the
question which the committee of
ten set out to answer, but before
they made their reports they had
gone beyond this question to the
question. What is an ideal high
school course of study?
Germany provides three systems
of schools for the various classes
of pupils, the folks school, with
an eight-year course, the burg
school, with a ten-year course, and
â  university course of twelve years.
The courses of study in these three
systems are distinctive, and a
parallel in the studies is scarcely
approximated. There Is a senti
â¢ ment, however,' in favor of estab
lishing a common lower ground
for all three systems. The Eng
lish system is not a uniform one.
English authorities have been
urged to adopt a secondary school
system patterned upon the Ameri- â¢
can high school. It seems Impossi
ble, on the other hand, to read our
own educational history without
discovering in It a constant and
growing tendency toward the unity
which the- English and German
schools lack.
An interesting criticism was piven by
Mr. T. L. Heaton on rending as at
present taught in tho public schools.
Among other things, Mr. Heaton said:
Reading is at present not well
taught in our schools. It is but a
dead level of monotony, and yet we
talk of the beauty of literature. Ki
ocution has of late fall* n. and just
ly, into disrepute. Bui why? He
cause it is done without under
standing. Elocutionists teach their
students Hamlet's soliloquy with a
series of acrobatic f-rformances
that would make Hamlet Turn in
his crave. It is good reading, not
elocution, that should be aimed at.
nnd every teacher should realize
the importance of voice training.
Teachers now require their pupils
to commit to memory, not pas
sages like the "Barefoot Boy," hut
"Portia's Address" an' 1 . "Hamlet's
Soliloquy." It Is "words, words,
words," as Hamlet said to Polon
ius, that are taught in our schools.
The meanings of the words and
their associations, and the circum
stances of the situation described
are left out of account. Except by
oral rendering, there can be no
true interpretation of, literature.
Professor Frown continued his his
torical review of secondary education,
ning with the early grammar
schools of the colonies. He said:
I the .TÂ«-suits. much
as they Influenced education in Eu
ro- ... affected but little early edu
d In Mi s country. The "gram
mar" school, us mentioned In con
nection with oui itonial his
tory, whs nut. ;..- at present, the
; above the primary school.
"Latin grammar school." The
so-called "free school" was also a
secondary school and probably de
rived its name from the fact that
it w,:s "tret" fr..rn. or not connect
ed with a monastery.
The first "grammar" school we
know of in this country was the
one proposed for Virginia, which.
however, never was rullv estab
lished. The Boston Latin School,
which is generally regarded as the
patriarch of our secondary schools,
was founded in I6S. When three
or four years later Harvard Col
was established, the boys of
the Boston Latin School were fit
ted to enter the new university.
One of its most illustrious masters
was Kzekiel Cheever, who guard. d
the affairs of the school from 1678
to 170 S. The Boston Latin School
is now, of course, no longer an
old-time "grammar schorl," but a
modern high school with a strictly
classical curriculum.
Latin schools were established in
N'.-w York under Dutch rale. In
1661 the company provided funds
with which was established a
school which passed successfully
through various vicissitudes. In
I' 7 was established the first sec
ondary school in Pennsylvania, but
it had to be closed because the
master had no certificate from
the Bishop of London. fn !HS:Â» was
founded the famous William Perm
Charter School, which became the
gr.-at school of Philadelphia. South
Carolina established grammar
schools by law in 1710.
During revolutionary times "log
colleger' sprang up in the colonies,
modeled after the famous log col
lege, founded in l~y, \ iy tne R e v
William Pennant. Here wer. taught
the classics and the beginnings of
theology. and the graduates
which the Log College sent out
were zealous in establishing similar
schools In various localities.
In New England grammar schools
were origin. illy established in the
townships, but later the count v
became, as now. the unit of second
â  himti' n. The curricula of the
early New England grammar
schcx Is aimed to prepare, by clas
sical training, men for the higher
offices. Especial attention was paid
to candidates for the ministry. The
primary aim. however, of the
grammar schools, was to prepare
their students for the colleges. Ed
ucators then recognised no advan
tage of mlddie . duration uth-r than
preparation for college. Between
the two r gnlzed classes of min
i^t.rs and magistrates on the one
hand and the great mass on the
other, there was no clearly defined
or importnnt middle class. Our
modern democratic organisation
has destroyed the sharp lineswhich
then divided classes and Interme
diate, transitional types have he
eome Of the utmost import. This
change has been reflected in the
history of our educational institu
tions.
DOG-OWNERS INCENSED.
Coroplaint That the City Pound !s
a Source of Mange and
Distemper.
Considerable complaint has been made
of late that every dog that goes into the
City Pound fci Hampshire and Sixteenth
streets and does not suffer capital pun
ishment on account of the fact that It
has no cvner comes out with the mange
or the distemper.
The cause of this condition of affairs
Is given us the unsanitary condition in
which the pound is kept, diseased dog's
tfing placed, it la alleged, together with
the healthy one?, it matters not how val
uable the breed. It is stated that some
of the aggrieved, ones will afford some
relief to their Injured feelings by lodging
complaint against the Institution.
WILL FAVOR THE
BIG OMAHA FAIR
California Likely to Be at the
Trans-Mississippi Expo
sition.
Chamber of Commerce Will Take
Up the Proposition on
Wednesday.
There â¢will be an interesting meeting of
the trustees of the Chamber of Com
merce on next Wednesday at which the
matter of having California and San
Frani Iw 0 represented at the coming
Trans-Mississippi and International Ex
position at Omaha will be the chief topic
of discussion. As long ago as last No
vember the Chamber passed resolutions
favoring the exposition project and pledg
ing its support to help to its ability. Since
then nothing of importance has been done
in the matter. Recently several of those
who went East with the Alaska Trade
Committee's special car were interviewed
by the exposition officials and they have
come back much impressed with the de
sirability of having this city and State
make a display that will astonish the
world, as has been done at several of
the recent expositions in this country and
Europe.
The argument for making a special dis
play is that nearly all of the States in
tin- t'nion will be represented, and so far
California â Â« ms to be the only one that
is holding back. The prospectus of the
exposition leads to the belief that it will
be as great an event as the World's
Fair held in Chicapo. Among the officers
art- some <'f the brightest men in the
United States, and the commission ap
pointed by the Government are all well
known. The people connected with the
exposition are very anxious to have the
exhibit at the Miners' Fair in this city
moved bodily to Omaha and set up there
as it will be here. They argue that the
local fair will be closed long before the
big exposition begins. The latter will
open <>n the first of June and last until
November. This, of course, will make it
necessary to store the local exhibit for
a fi \v months. Bvery Inducement in the
line of space and accommodation is of
fered.
That the Chamber of Commerce is
likely to takf the matter up. and favor
ably" there Is no doubt. There was to
have been a meeting of the trustees last
week, but the Installation of the new
officers caused some delay. When the
trustees meet on next Wednesday they
wlll be addressed by several of the gentle
men connected with the exposition. These
are G. W. Parsons, one of the vice-presi
dents and a resident of Los- Angeles. A.
G. McAuslands, commissioner, of 602 Mar
ket street of thts city: Colonel H. B.
Maxon. vice-president, of Reno. New :
John C. Wharlon. director, of Omaha,
and others. These gentlemen will urge
upon the Chamber to do all in its power
to have California and San Francisco
make one of the best displays at the big
fair. Tn this reonest it is likely that the
State Board of Trade will come in with
a strong second, as the board has al
ready declared In favor of the suggestion.
AN EXCITING BALL GAME.
The Will & Flocks Defeat the
Bushnell fllerts 4 to 3.
The smile that Mark Hanna wore when
he got in that fatal solar plexus on Me-
Klsson, in their little argument, which
they recently had In Ohio, was not In It
with the one that ruffled the countenance
of Captain Smith of the Will & Fincks
tfiim. when the game yesterday at Cen
tral Park was over. He had every rea
son to be happy. The Bushnell Alerts had
been putting up a stiff bluff from the
first inning, and the margins were in
their favor, but when it came to a call,
and that in the last half of the ninth.
Captain Smith loosened the ribbons on his
men and they flashed under the wire in ]
true Garrison style, winners by the score ,
of 4 to 3.
Only a small crowd saw the Jubilee
baseball carnival open, but those who
were there witnessed an exciting contest
with plenty of heart disease element in it.
The Alerts led with the stick and should
have won, but Shea <-ould not get the
kinks out of his usually effective wing,
and the seven bases on balls that he gave j
the Will & Fincks tells the story of why
it should not have happened. He only
allowed four hits off his delivery, but at
critical moments he was seized with an
aggravated case of the Willies, and Cap
tain Smith and his men made the most j
of these attacks. Fitzpatrick was hit I
safely nine times, but he kept them scat
tered, and when it came to a pinch there
were no reefs in his sails.
The Will & Fincks got one in the second
inning, and then in the fourth they let '
the Alerts mix them up a bit, and two
errors and as many hits netted the
Alerts their three runs.
Tn the sixth Captain Smith went at his
adversaries in no uncertain way. Scott
took first on Schmeer's muff of his short
fly and made the circuit on Stanley's
single. Fitzpatricks sacrifice and Hilde
brandt's liner to center. Smith and Mer
tes scored in the ninth by clever base
stealing combined with some effective
stick work. The detailed score is as

BROKE THE WRONG LOCK-
The Head Steward of the Old Glory
Restaurar)t Charged With
Burglary.
The Old Glory restaurant, on Kearny
â¢ between Pine and California streets, was
attached by creditors a few days ago and
â  the Sheriff placed his lock on the door.
Yesterday that official was made aware
thai all the cooking utensils and most of
: the furniture had been removed and
tsiken away by some one who had entered
the place by the rear. Lieutenant Esola
of the California-street Police Station was
notified and he detailed Officer J. D. Long
to rtcover the stolen property and to ar
| rest the thief. Officer Long found the
: property and placed the head steward of
i the restaurant â Edward Dean â under ar
! rest for burglary.
Cannot Get Justice.
C. T. Biddulph, who alleges that he Is
a captain In the Britl3h army, applied in
Judge Campbell's court yesterday for a
warrant for the arrest of the proprietor
of a restaurant on Turk street on the
charge of battery. The captain said he
had lunch in the restaurant and as he
was leaving the proprietor, without any
cause, knocked him down and sat upon
him. Ab he had no witnesses to the al
leged assault the warrant was refused,
and the captain left the courtroom com
plaining that he could not get justice
in "this Uawsted country."
HORSES MUST BE
BETTER TREATED
Closely Shorn Animals to Be
Blanketed on Rainy
Days.
Crusade to This End Will Be Inau
gurated by the Various Local
Societies.
The next rainy day may be cold as far
as the atmosphere is concerned, but It
; will doubtless prove exceedingly warm
I those careless ilrivers of horseflesh
: who have been practicing the habit of
| leaving animals with hair closely clipped
. out In the rain. If the Society for the
; Prevention of Cruelty to Animals cuts
: any figure in the matter, it will be one
of those cases where there is no God in
I Israel fur the careless driver.
H is a fact to be deprecated that thia
; practice has been in vo ?u , for a lons
, toe. in truth, no one can remember
â wnen it was not a common sight for
; pedestrians to view horses tied to the
curbs on a cold, rainy day -horses that
had lately had their hair dipped l short!
and yet were left to stand shivering with
f n r O om Ct Vh c e rin efem W enVs eVOr * I>ri ' U Â«' t them
But the society has decided that this
must cease. Accordingly, Secretary Hol
brook has lately had several conferences
. with the proper authorities, and been
I told to go ahead, that he wouid have all
| the support necessary in coses where ar
reeta were nwdc Kelvins on this assur
ance, he will do all he can to stop the
practice.
The fact that arrests would be made
by the wholesale if necessary has beta
kept very quiet, as it was thought that
it would have a better effect on tne
others if an example were made of a few
of the worst offenders before the atten
tion of the public became attracted to
: what was going on.

The Fire Commissioners met on Friday
afternoon when Janus KarU-y. hoseman

(\ NEEDED EXAMPLE.
DOUBTLESS there will be many expressions of
sympathy on account 01 the two boys sen
tenced by Judge Wallace to the penitentiary,
and more than likely there will be petitions asking for
clemency. Yet the boys do not deserve any sympathy.
In all probability it would be wasted upon them and
to other boys, who arc not in jail, it would be ex
tended in a harmfully negative sense.
It is true that provision for segregation of profes
sional criminals ought to be made, and a natural sup
position is that a lad of tender years will not merit
classification with these even if he has fallen into
error The boys under consideration seem to be
different. They deliberately committed highway rob
bery, and that it did not include murder was merely
because their arms did not possess the strength to
deal a fatal blow. It is pitiful that they must be
put among men old in sin and hardened beyond pos
sibility of reform. In the ordinary course of events
they will emerge as tough as any old offender in the
lot. They embarked on the current of evil and there
is no method by which they may tacfc.
Melancholy as the fate of the boys is, there could
be nothing but mistaken mercy in sending them io
a reformatory institution. There they would at once
assume the position of heroes and corrupt others who
row have a chance to reach manhood prepared to
uprightly meet the responsibilities it will bring. It
is wiser to safeguard the many than expose them to
contamination in the vain hope that the source of the
contamination will become purified. The hoodlu'n
element of San Francisco \\as in need of a lesson.
Thr lesson has been given. It was a severe one.
Ye*, to let it stand as the Judge decreed it seems the
only fitting course.
(\ COLLEGE OF COMMERCE.
RESOLUTIONS directing the establishment of
a college of commerce at the State University
and authorizing the president to nominate a
professor to take charge of the work were submitted
at the recent meeting of the regents and supported by
a strong report on the subject from the committee
to which the matter had been referred. Ko action
was taken at the time, but the expediency of founding
such a college is now fairly before the regents as a
question of practical policy, and is therefore an issue
of public interest.
It is no longer necessary to argue the advisability
of technical education as a general principle. It is
everywhere recognized that if we are to have a high
standard of industrial development we must have
schools and colleges where young men can receive
instruction in the sciences that underlie modern in
dustries and in the arts by which they are carried on.
The only question, outside the financial one, involved
in the present case is whether a technical commer
cial education is as necessary to California in the
present condition of her development as technical
education in mining or agriculture.
The affirmative argument on the question is well
presented in the report accompanying the resolutions
submitted to the regents. It is virtually made up of
two points; first, the benefits which such colleges
have conferred upon communities where they have
been established and operated for any length of time,
and, second, the increasing importance to California
of finding some means for extending the market for
her surplus products.
It is in Germany that the advantages of colleges of
commerce are most strikingly shown. The extra
ordinary expansion of German commerce and indus
try of recent years has been one of the marvels of the
time. The causes of the expansion have been closely
investigated by the British, whose markets are being
invaded by the Germans, and the reports of the in
vestigators are to the effect that German success in
commerce is due almost wholly to the excellent
technical training given in her commercial schools
and colleges.
The lesson taught by Germany has been learned in
other lands, and at the present time both France and
Great Britain are imitating her wise example. We
also will have to follow it if we hope to hold our own
in the markets of the world. Although but a small
portion of our resources have been developed, we al
ready produce of many articles much more than we
can consume at home. We must extend the market
for such products or the industries which produce
them will languish.
Commercial expansion is in fact one of the press
ing needs of the State. It is as important as mining
or agriculture. The time is rapidly approaching when
the prosperity of all our great industries will be de
pendent upon the commercial enterprises that find
a market for their products. It will be wise, there
fore, to begin at once the commercial training of
those who are to carry on that important part of the
activities of the commonwealth.
If the truth has been told about the method of
slaughtering calves as practiced in Marin County, the
guilty butchers deserve to be sent to jail for life.
A TROUBLED BOODLER.
IF the Mission street Boodler has not already an
"advertising" contract with the Los Angeles
Water Company it is perfectly plain that it hopes
to get one in the near future. Ever since the expo
sure of the water conspiracy and the syndicated press
of the southern city the Boodler has manifested an
uneasy grasp upon public affairs. It is apparent
either that it is embarrassed in the execution of some
agreement by which its true character may again be
disclosed to the public, or it is worrying over the
presence of Colonel Mazuma at Los Angeles with its
brsiness end 500 miles away.
In its local columns it is giving the water monop
oly and the syndicated press all the aid and comfort
it can. For instance, yesterday morning it pub
lished an epitome of the Los Angeles Herald's
charges against Major H. W. Patton, The Call's cor
respondent, and broadly intimated that they were
true. That this dispatch originated in the offices of
the syndicated papers is unquestionable. That the
Boodler hopes to get paid for it in some way is fairly
inferable from its tone. Throughout it breathes sym
pathy for the water conspirators and the syndicated
press and hostility for The Call and the champions of
the people of Los Angeles.
Our readers will recall that the Boodler's "adver
tising" contract with the Southern Pacific was for
editorial silence. If it has a similar contract with the
Los Angeles Water Company it has observed its
covenants, for the Boodler has nerer said a word
editorially about the plans of that corporation. But.
it will be remembered, there came a time when the
Boodler could no longer keep quiet regarding South
ern Pacific affairs. Then it repudiated its contract
and sacrificed the $8000 still due for its thirty months
of silence. If the Boodler has an "advertising" con
tract with the Los Angeles Water Company evi
dently it does not think an opportune moment for
getting an increase of subsidy has arrived. Thus far
it has stood in on the monopoly side of the fight and
maintained editorially a masterly silence. If it has
no contract it may think the meager aid and com
fort it is rendering and the silence it is maintaining
will induce the monopoly to "advertise." Indeed it
is quite certain that unless the water manipulators
hire the Boodler to advocate their cause pretty soon
even Colonel Mazuma will desert them. The colonel
is not distinguished fnr his courage. Unless he is
supported he will not fight.
One thing, however, may be set down <is settled:
either the Boodler has a contract with the Los An
geles Water Company or is looking for one. In the
nature of things we shall know in a few days which
it is. The Boodler cannot long refrain from culti
vating so fruitful a boodle field as is now presented tS'
its view at the orange metropolis.
A WARNING TO KLONDIKERS,
THE Washington correspondent of the Philadel
phia Public Ledger st tes that it has been offi
cially made known to our Government that the
Canadian authorities desire to warn the public against
so-called transportation companies which are offer
ing, for sums ranging from $50 to $150, payable in
advance, to convey persons from the Eastern States
to Dawson City by Canadian routes and to provide
them with food en route.
It would be well if our Governme-nt could imitate
the Canadian authorities in warning the public
against similar schemes to swindle Alaskan adventur
ers out of their money and possibly endanger their
live*. All the promoters of fraudulent transportation
enter/irises to the Klondike do not advertise to take
their dupes through Canada. Some of them propose
to operate from American ports and to cross the sea
under the American flag.
The eagerness of inconsiderate persons to get to
the gold fields renders them easy dupes to the wiles
of the unscrupulous, and the latter hwe been prompt
to take advantage of the excited condition of the pub
lic mind. A host of schemes in which the discern
ing can easily recognize fraud are being put forth to
deceive the unwary. They are not unknown to San
Francisco, and they swarm in the boom cities of the
north.
One of the most dangerous forms of these unscru
pulous enterprises is that of preparing for the rough
voyage to St. Michael ships that are hardly fit to carry
coal along the coast. Old hulks, utterly unseaworthy,
are being patched and painted and made ready to go
to sea with hundreds of passengers. They will be
hardly more than death traps, and unless the Gov
ernment inspectors intervene to prevent, many a san
guine company of gold seekers will sail forth only to
perish amid the wastes of the ocean.
American officials have been notoriously careless
in the inspection of ocean-going ships. Many a
wreck has occurred because ships left port in a
condition unfit for long or stormy voyages. Some
have been overloaded, some badly equipped, some in
efficiently manned and some have been so worn out
and rotten that they should have been burned or torn
to pieces long before.
The rush to Alaska this year will afford a good
opportunity for Government inspectors to begin en
forcing more rigidly the laws for the protection of
sailors and ocean voyagers. The need of a close and
scrutinizing watch cannot be doubted by any one
who pays attention to the way affairs are going.
Small ports that are known to have barely ships
enough to handle their normal local trade are now
advertising whole fleets of vessels for the Alaskan
voyage. Not many ships in these swiftly created
fleets come fresh and strong from the shipyards.
Most of them have been hauled from the inner flats
of coast harbors where they were anchored years ago
as abandoned hulks unfit for further service.
Whatever is done elsewhere there should be strict
enforcement of the law in San Francisco. There will
be no justifiable excuse for permitting any unfit ships
to sail or steam from this port. San Francisco is not
like the small boom cities where shipping facilities
are scant. In this city there is a large mercantile
marine. There are many ship yards with a large
capacity for constructing new vessels. These have
been busy all winter. It is fair to assume that we will
have enough good, strong, stanch ships to meet the
demands for the traffic, and certainly we should not
allow any other kind to sail from the Golden Gate.
Mr. Cleveland will be surprised to learn that he
favored annexation. He had entertained an idea to
the contrary, but this was before Senator Morgan had
enlightened him. Even now. perhaps, the ex-Presi
dent â a man not without obstinancy â will refuse to
accept the Morgan view of it and will persist in
thinking that while he was doing all Tie could to de
feat annexation he was not doing it to demonstrate
how anxious he was to have the scheme succeed.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 23, 1898.
CALIFORNIA is the only State which cele
brates, with proper pomp and circumstance, its
admission into the Union. It may be truly said
to be the only State whose acquisition should be cele
brated by the Union. No other brought with it such
sumptuous natural resources, such enduring capacities,
such a soil and sky. The beginning of the develop
ment of all this, of the noblest uses of the soil and of
setting profit out of our enduring sunshine, was the
discovery of gold, fifty years ago.
That stirred men in all the old States and thrilled
them in far countries. It caused to turn toward Cali
fornia the most reputable and remarkable emigra
tion that ever sought any land. The real argonauts
were, it is true, a law unto themselves, but that was
a law of absolute justice and honor, and the force
behind it, as force must be behind all law, was the
clearest courage. The knights of the Crusades were
not as faultless as these modern men who met here
during the first few years after the discovery of gold.
The volume of romance, of adventure, of unswerv
ing honor, of fidelity and fellowship gained more
pages from the personal careers and achievements of
these men than it had accumulated from the begin
ning of human history.
What they wrought was of more consequence to
the world than all the campaigns since Alexander.
II they changed the course of human history it was
not by destroying, but by building up. The stream
of gold they set flowing through the world added to
its shelter and its food. The waters of that new Pac
tolus irrigated the enterprise of men in every country,
and there followed expansion of opportunity, in
crease in the wages of labor, more food and fire for
the poor and a better chance. After they had ex
ploited the placers and taken out their gold every
child in every civilized country was born to a better
inheritance, and men whose lives began long before
that day closed their eyes on a better world than
that upon which they had opened.
The men who toiled on the bars of California
streams added stars to the national flag. What they
did here broke virgin soil and brought fresh fields
into production; it dug canals and built long lines
of railway and shortened the time between the pro
ducer and his final market, adding to the profits of
his toil and giving its results more cheaply to the
consumer; it stirred every beating pulse and filled
every heart with better ambitions; it broadened liberal
culture and caused education to be more sought, for
it became a higher prize than before.
These men. who doubled the Horn or marched
across the isthmus in death-defying ranks, or took the
long trail overland beset by strange terrors of thirst
and famine and prowling savages, passed the' final
test of manliness, and when they rested from their
journey and began their labors they were better sea
soned in all the requirements of manhood and citi
zenship than the ten thousand Greeks who followed
Xenophon from Asia to the Aegean. It is well that
California puts out her garlands and to-day cele
brates the Golden Jubilee of her heroic age. No
other State nor nation has such an event to set among
its holfdays. and none can say as truthfully that what
she in that age did for herself she did also for the
world.
The Call hails the hosts that come to set the seal
of pride and approval upon an event that had no
companion in the annals of man to the day of its
happening, and that stands in solitary eminence in
the history of the world for the half century since.
THE RAILROAD COMMISSION.
IX their annual report to the Governor the Rail
road Commissioners declare that unless the Leg
islature can be induced to confer further power
upon them their offices may as well be abolished.
This act of official self-abnegation has but one paral
lel in the annals of the State. Many years ago an
officer known as the State Engineer reported to the
Governor that unless something could be found for
hin* to do it would be a Rood idea to abolish his
office. He had no idea that any one would take him
seriously. He thought the Legislature would rustle
around and provide him with work. To the amaze
ment of every one, however, the Solons, without ever
inquiring whether the office of State Engineer was
necessary or not, passed an act abolishing it. This
case of official harakiri stands alone in our history.
The Railroad Commissioners complain that they
are tied up in the Federal courts: that the Legislature
will not provide them with sufficient money to carry
on their business; that they possess no power to com
pel railroads even to make reports to them; that
there is no penalty for non-compliance with their
orders with reference to switches, turnouts and sta
tion houses, and that, consequently, the railroads treat
them with contempt in all such matters: that in short
the commission has fallen into a condition of official
paralysis which renders it practically useless, and the
members cannot perceive the object, as at present
organized, of its further existence.
While it is gratifying to know that the gentlemen
row holding the offices of Railroad Commissioners
are sufficiently frank to acknowledge their inability to
render any service for their salaries, what they say is
not in any sense news. For years it has been appar
ent that the commission could do nothing toward
regulating railroad rates of transportation in this
State. The truth is, the body is organized on a wrong
principle. The powers conferred on It are legisla
tive, executive and judicial. It frames laws, expounds
and executes them. This jurisdictional mixture, being
illogical, never works anywhere, and it is no wonder
that at last the Railroad Commission has succumbed
to the confusion which always results from mingling
such antagonistic powers.
It is doubtful, however, whether the commission
should be altogether abolished. That it ought to be
remodeled, though, is quite certain. Experience has
demonstrated that regulating railroad rates by sched
ule is impracticable. Besides being expensive and
intricate, it enables the roads to constantly question
its legality. Passenger and freight schedules are the
growth of years, not the work of days or weeks.
What should be done with the Railroad Commission
is to convert it into a court for the trial of railroad
grievances. Its decisions might be made appealable
and enforcible after affirmation like those of any
other court. Thus, by legal process, jurisdiction
might be conferred to decide whether a particular
Height or passenger rate is juss or not. whether a
particular town has a sufficient number of switches,
whether trains are run on time, whether roadbeds
nrc kept in order â in short, whether the corporations
obey the laws and respect the rights of the people.
Furthet thin this, under the decisions of the Fed
eral courts the States in reflating railroads cannot
ro. The Interstate Commerce Commission is or
ganized on the correct principle. The decisions of
that body already form a respectable volume of rail
road law. Eventually that commission is certain to
become the source o: a lot of railroad rules by which
passengers and shippers may ascertain their rights
with reference to aln.osi any subject of dispute.

Charles Niemetz voluntarily places on
record a protest because some writer
has termed an angel "she." He claims
that angels belong to the other sex, and
seems to have pome ground for the as
sertion, yet it Is nothing to be proud of,
even If true. Angels have done some
errands which had they been winged
ladies they would have declined to un
dertake. It whs an angel who Is cred
ited with having kicked up a row for
which he was tossed out of heaven, re
ceiving a considerable fall. Gallantry
compels an admission that the plot was
in conception and general character en
tirely masculine. The angel who took
a flaming sword and drove a misguided
pair from a pleasant garden could not
have been anything but a male, else the
sword would have been quenched in the
tears of the penitents and the angel
would have flown back to headquarters
to Intercede for new orders. I confess
to a preference for the female angel
Idea, and would be glad to think that
the ethereal beings supposed to hover
in space and shield mortals under the
shadow of their pinions were as unlike
myself and the rest of my kind as pos
sible. In the particular case at issue,
however, a compromise might easily be
struck by calling the angel "it." This
angel Is carved out pf stone, anyhow.

Ignatius Donnelly is in many respects
an admirable old man. He cherishes
certain innocent delusions in respect to
authorship, but beyond smiling at these
there is no reason for giving them the

Donnelly. At the worst he did no more

Certainly he has his lucid intervals, for

As to her lucid intervals there might

is welcome to have just as much fun
out of his patent cryptogram as he can
find there. If ha should attempt to
demonstrate that Bacon wrote Mother

Moved by a personal grief and de
siring to perpetuate the names of
those dear to her, a lady proposes to
erect an elaborate arch over an en
trance to the park. This arch is to
be In memory of her husband and
son and so engraved that its purpose
shall be plain to the beholder. I do
not question the motives of the lady
nor doubt that she is as gracious as
generous, but with the utmost re
spect I do question her taste. An in
dividual grief never looks well on dis
play. It is a thing in which the pub
lic takes no permanent interest and
which should be guarded as sacred.
To erect the arch and leave it unin
scrlbed would be an act of far greater
delicacy. The cemetery is the place
where mortuary records may be pre
served. In the city of the dead it is
appropriate to carve upon marble the
names the silent bore and perhaps the
deeds they did. When a man has
lived as a private citizen, his work of
no wide moment, his worth known
only to those who loved him, he does
not. by the inevitable process of
death, win the right to be thrust upon
the notice of the world in general, and
the callous throng as it passes will
not even pause to ask who he was.
It is one of the delusions of sorrow
that its crape casts a shadow across
the universe, whereas elsewhere the
sun is shining and people do not care.
So v. park entrance does not seem to
me to be a spot in which to rear a
tombstone. Such a stone would be

It is without so much as a start of

has deserted the Bryan standard. Mc-

which he can tear himself vociferously

he will come tearing back again. The
gentleman is able when he takes the
trouble, but fickle as the queen of the

moons ago he could not say things
m^an enough to express his distaste for
Hearst, who above all men had been
considerate of him. He despised Hearst,
and yellow journalism sent him into
spasms of great length which he re
duced to print. Then he went to work
for Hearst and became a part of the
yellowest sheet ever openly published.

not a serious matter. The interest
arose from the fact that the McEwen
pen had scarce been dry from drip
ping honey words all <wer Bierce when
it was dipped into the vitriol and
jabbed at him with fervor and appar

Bryan. He kept McEwen as a friend

Somebody in the East has invented
a perfectly lovely plan of preserving
the dead. Instead of being laid in the
ground or reduced to ashes, bodies are
to be kept as if asleep, so that mourn
ers may come and gaze upon them,
thus keeping themselves alive to the
necessity of continuing to mourn. If
the plan has anything to commend it
the fact has yet to be mentioned. The
sooner the mortal frame is reduced to
its primary elements after the spirit
has fled the better. People who view
the preservation scheme with subdued
rapture do not pause to reflect that by
the time a body has succumbed to dis
ease it is not an object of beauty, and
has slight chance to be a Joy forever.
Then complications might arise. The
multiwidower would be embarrassed to
have his fourth gaze upon his three

criticize the style of clothes worn by
her predecessors, for part of the per
fectly lovely plan is that the exhibits

at the time they go to pickle. Modes
change, and to keep abreaat of progress
it would be necessary to occasionally
change the drapery of the tomb. Of
course, this sounds like nonsense.

It was true then, and ever since, the

the buildings a series of rickety barns
loosely strung on a dark and draughty
corridor. There has been no move
toward reform. People talk, officials
steal, patients suffer and so will it con

better conditions lies in the possibility
that the structure may burn. What

To Gain Flesh, to Sleep Well, to Know
What Appetite and Good Digestion
Mean, Make a Test of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Interesting Experience of an Indianapolis
Gentleman.
No trouble is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People having it think that their nerves
are to blame and are surprised that
they are not cured by nerve medicine
and spring remedies; the real seat of
the mischief is lost sight of; the stom-
ach is the organ to be looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the usual symptoms of
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspep-
sia shows itself not in the stomach so
much as in nearly (very other organ;
In some cases the heart palpitates and
is irregular; in others the kidneys are
affected; in others the bowels are con-
stipated, with headaches; still others
are troubled with loss of flesh and ap-
petite, with accumulation of gas, sour
risings and heartburn.
Mr. A. W. Sharper of No. 61 Prospect
street. Indianapolis, Ind., writes as fol- I
lows: "A motive of pure gratitude '
prompts m^ to write these few lines
regarding tho new and valuable medi-
cine, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I !
have been a sufferer from nervous dys-
pepsia for the last four years; have
used various patent medicines and oth-
er remedies without any favorable re-
sult. They sometimes gave temporary
relief until the effects of the medicine
â wore oft I attributed this to my sed-
entary habits, being a bookkeeper with
little physical exercise, but I am glad
to state that the tablets have over-
come all these obstacles, for I have
gained in flesh, sleep better and am
better in every way. The above is writ-
ten not. for notoriety, but is based on
actual fact. Respectfully yours,
â¢A. W. SHARPER,
"fil Prospect street, Indianapolis. Ind."
It Is safe to say that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets will cure any stomach
â weakness or disease except cancer of
etomach. They cure sour stomach, gas,
loss of flesh and appetite, sleeplessness,
palpitation, heartburn, constipation
and headache.

and 1896.
The Information Obtained Regarding
the Sun Will Be of Much Inter
est to Scientists.
Bpecla'. Dispatch to The Call.
TALNI, British India, between Am
raetl and NutiKhou. Jan. 22.â The ob
servation of the eclipse of the sun to
i day by E. W. Maunder and C. T. Waite
was most successful. The sky was per
fectly clear and the light during the
middle of the totality equaled a full
moon. The general shape of the sun co
rona was the same as the eclipses of
1886 and IS!*6. The corona extended
, over two diameters from the sun and
its greatest extent was along the sun's
equator.
Photographs were obtained on a
scale of 4-5 inch to the sun's diameter,
and also on the scale of 1-10 inch, to get
the coronal extensions. The spectrum
of the chronosphere and its promi
nences was successfully observed with
an opera glass fitted with a direct vis
ion prism in one of the eyepieces. The
three photographs of the corona were
obtained on a scale of 7-10 Inch to the
sun's diameter, and also on the scale
of l-io inch, flood spectrum photo
graphs were obtained.
The spectrum of the flash was ob
tained with a prismatic camera and a
six-inch telescope.
The Lick Observatory party, under
Professor Campbell, wire-s that the sky
is clear and that observations have
been successful. The light in the mid
dle of the totality was greater than the
full moon, and the general shape of
the corona was similar to the eclipses
of 1886 and IS9S. It extended to the
distances nearly two diameters from
the sun. The greatest extension was
along the line of the sun's equator.
BY RAIL TO THE
YUKON GOLD FIELDS
Surveys Being Made by the
Alaska and Northwestern
Company.
Boston Capitalists Awaiting the Con
sent of Congress to Becjin Build
ing to Fort Selkirk.
Colonel W. C Alberg^r of this city, -who
has recently returned from Alaska, wherp
he surveyed a route nv>r Chllkool Pass
for thÂ«- Alaskan and Northern Railway
Company, is confident that the work of
construction will begin as soon as Con
gress grants the right of way.
"I left here last October," said Colonel
Alberptr last evening, "with a party of
twenty-five, fully equiiipt-d for the work
in view. We mapped out a route through
Chilkoot Pass for a distance of forty-five
milt-s, v,-hich brought us to the Canadian
line. From there wo went twenty-live
miles farther, and I returned home,
starting on Christmas day. I left my par
ty in the field and it will proceed with the
work to Fort St-lkirk, wtrich will be the
northern terminus of the road. The line
will be 300 miles long, which is the short
est route possible from tidewater to navi
gation on the Yukon.
"< >f course the most difficult part of the
route, from an engineering point of view,
is over the pa-ss. and although the *;â 
are steep in places, I don't, think we will
have to tunnel anywhere. The worst
feature is the precipitous nature of the
pass. Great maswirn of granite jut out,
-Hating a vast amount of heavy
work in grading the roadbed, but the
route is entirely practicable. From the
point reached when I returned the coun
:ry is what may be called rolling and ad
mirably adapted to railroad construction.
The soil is good and there is? plenty of
gravel for ballasting to be obtained all
along the line.
"We will have to do considerable bridg
ing, but the longest bridge will not be
over 700 feet, including approaches. This
la over the Yukon at Port Selkirk, and it
will probably be necessary to put in a
draw to permit the passage or steamers,
as the river is navigable at that point.
Fortunately, however, there is plenty of
Umber at this end of the route, so wewill
not be handicapped in that respect. <>n
the slopes of the Chilkoot Mountains
there is a vast Quantity of white spruce,
the trees being of large y\z>-. Farther up
the trees are smaller, an ls-inch tr
ing of exceptional size in the Yukon coun
try. Finally the timber disappears alto
gether, and we expect to derive a good
revenue from hauling timber into the
mining district."
"How long will it take to complete the
road?" was asked.
"If it were anywhere in the United
States I could answer that question." re
plied Colonel Alberger, "but the condi
tions in that country are such that it is
impossible to Bay. In the first place we
cannot begin work until Congress grants
us tho right of way. I anticipate no
trouble on that score, though. We have
already filed our application and we ex
pect Congress will act upon it favorably
this session and we will begin operations
right away. We can do a largo amount
of work on this side of the pass during
the winter, but on the other Hide the
ground is frozen so hard tfyit we cannot
do much except in the summer. The
work will be pushed ahead, though, just
as rapidly as possible when once we be
gin."
"Can you give the names of those in
terested in the company?"
"No, I am not at liberty to do pn at
present. I will say. though, that they are
all Boston capitalists and there is no
question about there being sufficient
financial backing. I have spent consid
erable money for the company already,
and my demands have been promptly met
and I am certain they will be right along.
If we had the consent of Congress I could
spend $21)0.000 a month from now on.
building wharves and grading the road
bed U> the summit, and I think we will
be 'ible to begin work in a very short
time"
"It has been staled that the Rothschilds
have also run a survey through Chilkoot
Puss for a railroad; do you know any
thing about it?"
"I know they have not made any sur
veys yet through the pass. I met Mr.
Bratennober and party, who wero sent out
by the London Exploration Company, in
which the Rothschilds are interested, but
I am positive that no surveys wt re made
for at least fifteen miles from tide-water.
They, too, wou'.d have to obtain the con
sent of Congress before they could con
struct a road in Alaska, and it does not
seem likely that an English company
would be given preference over Ameri
cans."

through Chinatown and see for themselves
how the almond-eyed stranger from the
Orient ushered in his new year. They ex
pected to meet with some adventure out
of the ordinary, and they did, ifarowwith
a guide and a subsequent trip to the police
station may be considered as things not
to be expected in the ordinary round of a
conventional existence. The party pro
ceeded up Sacramento street and were
trying to understand the difference be
tween a joss and a Josh, when they were
approached by a smooth-looking Celes
tial, who emerged from out of the smoke
of burning punks and firecrackers, and
after acquainting them with the fact that
ho was about the finest thing in guides
that the city possessed offered to show
them the sights under his experienced
chaperonage for the modest sum of $1. The
tourists jumped at so good a bargain and
the whole outfit started along together.
They had a fine time up to the hour of
settlement, and then the trouble com
menced. The only pieces of money in the
pockets of the escorts were a bogus dol
lar and a good half. They tried to pass
the counterfeit on the innocent-lookinsr
'guide, but he demanded a good coin and
refused to take anything less than the
stipulated price for his services. The men
of the party not having the price were
unable to comply with the demand, so
niti >t withstanding beauty's tears and
valor's threats the hard-hearted Mongo
lian had the whole party marched off to
the station. Thi-rn the men of the party
explained the matter, and as there was
evidently no attempt to pass the bad
money, and as the whole matter evident
ly arose from the Ignorance of the w6rth
lesanees of the coin they had attempted
to pay the guide with, the gallant Ber
geant on watch, moved at the sight of so
much lovelineea In distress, produced the
necessary half that the escorts lacked

his way in a happier frame of mind than

Louisa Garcia, Mrs. Helen Gerrish, her
niece, C. M. Gerrish and her nephew,
Frank Garcia, Jr. Mrs. Louisa Garcia,
Helen Gerrish and Frank Garcia, Jr.,
Mr. Scott avers, were frequently with
his wife, and knowing that she was of
unsound mind they took advantage of
her condition and led her to believe
that the contestant was constantly vio
lating his marriage vows. Scott also
alleges that by false statements they
led his wife to believe that he was try
ing to poison her, and with others was
conspiring to put her in an insane asy
lum. In this way, the contestant says,
they succeeded in getting his wife to
draw up a will that deprived him of
a just and lawful share of ftie dece
dents-estate.
In order to make his wife believe that
their charges were made in good faith,
Mr. Scott continues, Mrs. Garcia, Miss
Gerrlsh and Frank Garcia, Jr., retained
detectives to shadow him and they fre
quently visited Mrs. Scott at her home,
1743 Franklin street. They were un
successful in their attempts, however,
to dig up something against his repu
tation, but succeeded in so "Influencing
Mrs. Scott's mind that she neglected
to bequeath the contestant his rightful
share of the estate. In consequence
the court 1b asked to deny the will ad
mittance to probate.

THE SAX FTCAXCISCO CALL, srXDAY, JANUARY 23, 1898.
HAY NOW AS
GOOD AS COLD
Dealers Predict a Famine
if the Dry Weather
Continues.
Corn and Barley Bringing High
Prices and the Market
Advancing.
Heavy Frosts Responsible for a Short
Crop of Grass â Prices in
Dawson.
"While the scarcity of coal is creating i
a belief that it will not be long until \
the famine stage is reached, the livery '
stable men are exercised over the fact I
that there is now almost a famine in !
hay and other feed for animals, prices j
being now higher than they have for
years, and rapidly on the increase.
'â¢You take my word for it," said a I
prominent dealer yesterday, "we are
going to have one of the greatest fam
in.s in horse feed this country has ever
experienced if the weather does not
take a. decided change soon."
Choice hay is now quoted at $17 50 a
ton and oat hay at $16. Corn that used ;
to be burned for fuel in the East is
DOW bringing in the region of $20. The !
latest quotation here was $22 a ton.
Barley is quoted at $21 and $21 a ton,
according to quality.
The market is rapidly advancing in
everything, and it is expected that if
the dry weather continues it will not
be any great length of time ere hay
will be hard to get at $25 a ton. There |
is a greater demand now for dry food '
on account of the fact that frosts
have been prevalent throughout the
State, and accordingly the grass In all ;
sections is very short.
According to another dealer recent
advices show that hay is now selling
in Dawson City at the rate of $400 a
ton.
The whole cause of the trouble Is the
dry weather. If it should rain for a
week the prospects would soon be good.
If it should not. men with much live
stock on hand will have their pockets
drained pretty thoroughly.
THEY ALL HIT
THE BULLSEYE
But the Target This Time Was
the Festive Banquet

ONE OF THE OLD GUfiRD.
Keunior) of the /members of Com
pany M. F' r st Infantry, Mus

The members of the old IT Company,
First Infantry, held their annual reunion

Veteran Corps, Pioneer building:, Captain
E. G. Eisner presiding. The captain
stated that since the previous meeting ho

amount realized would be distributed to
the members.
Almost every member of the old com

Thd money that was distributed was
the third dividend from the sale of com
pany property since it went out of ex
fatence, and the money has been dividf<l
among the men according to the length
of service in the company. Some have re
ceived as high as $60.
During the evening Colonel H. P. Bush,
wh'> was < i.nnected with the company as
captain and treasurer for a quarter of a
century, \sas. by the members, presented
a handsome watch guard and slide, and

A vote of thanks was passed to Lieu

MO! FOR THE KLONDIKE.
Get Supplies First and Gold Comes
Easy.
Thousands will go to the Klondike
and other Alaskan mines within the
next few weeks. The steamers are
crowded with gold-seekers already, and
the attention given by the prospectors
to their outfitting is a good sign of
their determination to win fortune in
the icy north. But much may bo saved
the miner in comfort and health by
buying his equipment at the store car
rying the largest and most complete
stock of the kind in the country.
At Raphael's, on Kearny street, an
entire floor is filled with all that the
Alaska miner needs. Everything is
shown plainly, and no pains are spared
to help the purchaser select just what
will best suit him. Clothing for the
cold and warm weather ia displayed;
furs of all grades and woolens at low
prices. All seasons and conditions are
provided for. Sleeping robes and bags
that defy the cold, thick blankets and
damp-proof boots are shown with mos
quito nets and lighter apparel for sum
mer.
Food of the proper kind Is sold by
Raphael at wholesale prices. Groceries
and edible supplies that experience
has proved the only sort for Alaskan
living are to be bought cheaply by
those who outfit at the popular estab
lishment. An interesting exhibit is
made of both wearing and strength
supporting necessities, and a visit will
well repay any one.
PIONEER AND MINER.
Sketch of the Successful Career

Chief among the men who have aided
materially in the development of the
great mining resources of California

than Isaac 1,. Requa. This gentleman

a very considerable fortune.
Mr. Requa is 66 years of age, but he
is as active as many men of 30. He
arrived in San PranciSCO in 1850, and
at once engaged in mining. He was at
various times superintendent of the
Union Mill and Mining Company of
Virginia City, Chollar, Potost, N'orcross
and Savage mines. He succeeded In
sinking a vertical shaft 3250 feet in the
Savage mine, which was in many re
spects a wonderful feat. He remained
in Virginia City until Ivs3. when he re
moved to his present home in Oakland.

large interests in many valuable min
ing properties, Mr. Requa is prâ¬-sident
Of the Central Pacific Railway and of

monwealth Mr. Requa holds a high
place.

partment of the city government have
its affairs been so judiciouslyand capa

term. In the matter of street improve
i ments he has broken all previous rec
ords, and the magnificent results of his
efforts prove that the public confi
dence in him has not been misplaced.
Mr. Ambrose is a native of Santa
Rosa and SI years of age. He has re
j sided in this city since his second >-ar
and obtained his schooling here. After
â  graduating from the High School he
1 entered the contracting business, a

1 cessful. He was elected as School Di
rector in ISM, and served two years
. with credit to himself and his constitu
ents. Ho was fleeted to the office he
now holds by a large plurality, and
during his incumbency has paid so
cial attentloi to the repairs of streets.
; He i 3 well known in fraternal circles,
and is a charter member of Columbia

ROMANCE OF
A BANK BOOK
Ex-Judge E. D. Sawyer
Buys Patrick Brady's
Hibernia Account.
The Purchase Makes Him a
Sharer of the Rich Con
cern's Millions.
Queer Revelations by Reason of a
Public Officer's Careless
Blunders.
Oscar T. Shuck, the well known au
thority on old estates, has just brought
a strange story to light in the case of
an old Hibernia Bank book which was
owned by Patrick T. Brady, one of the
original depositors and stockholders of
the bank.
"Lost bank books have often fur
nished the basis of a good deal of liti
gation," said Mr. Shuck yesterday,
"but this one is one of the strangest of
all cases that I have ever handled in
this city. A few weeks ago the bank
advertised for the heirs of the late
Patrick T. Brady, and I began to look
them up. I soon found that the same
estate had been administered on ten
years ago and that the bank book was
sold at public auction to the highest
bidder, who was ex- Judge E. D. Saw
yer of the old Fourth district. I
thought it was a strange thing that
the estate was opened up again, and I
began to investigate. The result was
that Judge Sawyer appeared in court
and defeated the proceedings.
"It came out in the course of the in
vestigations that the sale was request
ed by Public Administrator Pennie,
and Judge Sawyer bought the bank
book at par because he knew that the
owner had been one of the original
shareholders and that he or his assigns
would have a large amount of money
when the assets of the bank are finally
distributed. Thus there was a large
and valuable card up the Judge's
sleeve when he made the bid. A strange
it< t about the affair is that the case
should have been advertised after it
had already been settled."
It is called to mind by those who
have watched these qld estates that
there are one or two cases that rest
on a similar basis and in all of these
there will be a neat distribution some
day as a result of the accumulations
that have been made since the share
holders first became members of the
association.
FOWLS DOSED
WITH ARSENIC
Henry Kohn, a Grocer, Suffers
at the Hands of a
Poisoner.
No Trace of the Evil-Doer, Who Will
Bo Vigorously Prosecuted If
Detected.
The poison fiend is again at work.
Henry Kohn, a grocer engaged in busi
ness at 408 Folstrm street, has lately
lost several valuable chickens, turkeys,
and pigeons through their being fed
with wheat soaked in arsenic. No
trace of the guilty party or parties has
yet been discovered.
Kohn makes a kind of a fad of his
fowls and always takes the best care
possible of them. They are kept in a
small yard off an alleyway opp<,-site his
place of business. Last Tuesday morn
ing a hired man went across the way to
feed them and found several dead.
When Kohn was told of this he sent
One of them to E. J. Creel y, the veter
inary surgeon at 510 Golden Gate ave
nue, for examination. Creely found on
analyzing the contents of the stomach
that the chicken had been fed wheat
poisoned with arsenic.
During the week other chickens and
a prize turkey also died and yesterday
morning one of the grocer's pig
eor.s was found dead in its cote. The
place where they are kept is secure
from molestation and could be reached
only through a doorway or over the
neighboring roofs. A cake of soap on
one of these roofs showed that some
person had been near the place of late.
Kohn knows of no enemies who would
be likely to do the deed. He is ex
ceedingly wroth over the occurrence
and will take steps to prosecute the
offender if ho is detected.

Although the consolidation of the
governments of 'the city and county
will hardly take place this jubilee
year, still the date is not far off when
this municipality will follow the cx
i ample of San Francisco.
During the past two years this ques
1 tion of consolidation has frequently

has depended to a great extent upon
this point. The tidal canal proposition,

far no good argument has been ad

A picture of Oakland in 1R49 consists
of a few oak trees and a hut along the

with the immense mass of inhabited
territory from the tidal canal around
the bay shore to the northern limit
of Berkeley. All this territory is prac

during the past six jrcMtn has tied Ala

lines of politics.
After half a century of existence as
a county, or as a part of a county,
originally known as Contra Costa, the
bay cities are now in a position to form
a big metropolis that will exceed In
value, population and area the much
vaunted city of the south, Los Angeles.
For some time there has been In
Berkeley a party which is anxious to
become part of Oakland, but no such
spirit has yet been made public in Ala
meda.
In the event of a division of the
county, leaving the bay cities as por
tions of Oakland, the interior of the
county owned fifty years ago mostly
by Robert Livermore, but now full of
thriving settlements, would prove
ample to form the nucleus of a county
by itself.

Ideas of the Ebell Are Un

Change.
Mrs. Rubs Brings HornÂ« Some
Plain Truths From Chi

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,,
90S Broadway. Jan. 22.
Dr. Mvra Knox has praeth ally r*- signed
from the City Improvement Club, and
although she still retains the title of
president, she has decided to confine her
work outside of professional duties to her
share of activity on the School Board.
It has been given out that the
City Improvement Club will not exist as
I an independent body much longer, but
! that its â pedal line of work may become
â  a separate secti"ii of the work of the
1 Kbell ("lub. At the meeting- yesterday of
| the ladies to discuss the park proposl
i tion, there was somewhat of a change
; of sentiment and the majority of the
; members tinding so much opposition to
j the different tracts decided that if the
i Sather tract be not accepted the next
Iw-st proposition was the A. lams tract.
There was a very nmall attendance, and
with I>r. Knux gone it seems as if the
interest had died out.
The Khull dub is now seriously consld
j ering its future. Recently Mrs. John
; Russ returned fro Chicago, where she
â pent much time among the women's
j clubs of that city. She gave the Bbell
! the benefit of her experience, and a com
parison shown that the In, a] club is far
â¢ behind its sister organizations in Eastern
i cities. Mrs. Rum stated that It would
I not be long before h club based entirely
| on the lines followed by the Kbell i"lui>
would reuse, to hold together. She openly
declared that the lin< s mast be broader
and more philanthropic As a result of
' her experience, Mrs. Russ did not exact
ly say that she had discovered that there
I was too much oratory and too little work
i along practical lines In the Bbell Club.
I but the tenor of her remarks left no dotttM
aa t>> what she meant. There ;tr>- 4'Â« iof
I the best ladies of Oakland in th<- Bbell
Club, and outeide of purely social lines,
i their influence is not felt in this city.
t In Chicago the celebrated Woman's Club
i has fcoo members and exercises a great
â  power through the entire city. The club
takea up any rase of persecution of
women, no matter in what branch, and
I having satisfied itself of its merit?, they
i immediately place the best legal talent in
j the city at the disposal of the persecuted.
I They also run a large lodging-house for
; women whirh has pet an example to the
i whole world, and no.thlng is too great or
too small lor the Chicago women to un
! dertake.
Mrs. Russ has stirred up the Oakland
club until it is ambitious to follow along
| lines similar to those prevailing in the
target city.
"The day of women's clubs for self pur
posea are almost at an end." said slr*.
Tiuss. "I found only two in all my search
ing, and there must a reaching out in a
: humane direction if they are to be sus
tained. This sentiment is comlnp west
; ward. Denver hns a club of 7<K) women,
founded on the same platform as the
; Chicago Women's Club and doing the
s.mi" work. Why not Oakland?"
Owing to the very exclusive lines on
I which the Ebell Society is run, Mrs. Russ
anticipated much opposition when she
, outlined her ideas, but instead they have
been favorably received, and it is more
th.in possible that a very practical pro
gramme will soon be outlined for the
wurk of the ladies who now devote thftr
efforts exclusively to literature and art.

Frank P. Bacon Not

Proposition to Settle tho Divorce
Case Brings Out the Anger
of the Court.
"I will never blacken my con
science by granting to the de
fendant the custody of the little
girl, Catherine, aged 9 years. A
man who is so lost to all sense
of honor and thinks bo little of
his obligations to his wife, little
children and society as to aban
don them deserves not the cus
tody, at least, of the girl. My
own observation has taught me
that the male sex can take care
of themselves.
"It might be that the example
of the father, vicious as it might
be to the boys, might serve to
them as a lesson, to elevate their
own condition and morals in
life. I never would grant into
the custody of the defendant,
shown to have abandoned his
wife and children of tender
years, a little girl. This is out of
the question."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 22.
Buch was the rebuke administered to
Frank P. Bacon, the once wealthy son
of a wealthy pioneer, in Judge Ogden's
court to-day.
The speaker was Judge F. B. Ogden.
who had just listened to the testimony
In the divorce proceeding of Mrs. Ma
mie C. Bacon against Frank P. Bacon.
The suit was filed Tuesday and the an
swer only this morning.
The defendant's order authorizing
Pierson and Mitchell to represent him
In this suit was dated Nogalea, Mexico,
January 19, 1898. Mr. Pierson made
his appearance shortly after 2 o'clock
and the case was called. Mrs. Bacon
was present with her little golden
haired daughter. Catherine, whose big
Mac eyes looked in wonderment at the
movements of all concerned. She
watched her mother closely while on
the stand.
Mrs. Bacon testified that she was
married December 24, 1574, at San Ga
brlei, and had eight children by this
union. They wero Henry D.. 22, mar
ried: Julia. 19: William S.. Ift Joseph
S., 15; Thomas 8., 13; Page, II; Cath
erine, i>, and Robert. 3 next April. She
said that Mr. Bacon deserted her and
the children July 22, 1595. since which
time they had never lived together Ror
had he supported her or the children.
She had not spoken to him in a year.
Judge Ogden drew from the witness
that for the past three months she had
not had clothes or fire to keep her
warm, nor food to keep her and the
children from being hungry. She ad
mitted that she hud been assured that
If sh" gave up all of the children but
the baby, only to see them but once a
week, all of the pending cases would
be dismissed and the divorce case not
contested. She was also to receive a
small settlement. She denied that this
arrangement met with her approval,
but it was a case where phe had to ac
cept what was offered or starve. She
said she could and would take care of
herself and all of the children with
$150 per month and bo glad to get It.
The only other iritneM was Mrs.
Egan, who was a domestic In the fam
ily when the desertion occurred, and
Attorney J. J. Scrivner, the plaintiff's
representative, who testified that he
broached the subject of divorce, and
until it was definitely settled no prop
erty interests or settlement was dis
cussed.
Attorney BofVMT then announced
that he had prepared the findings In
the case and a decree wherein the de
fendant was awarded all of the minor
children except the baby and the plain
tiff given $25 monthly alimony.
"What's that?" asked Judge Ogden.
with a heavy frown on his face. Mr.
Rcrivner repeated the proposlton,
when he was startled with the remarks
above quoted.
The defendant's attorney asserted
that the plaintiff was to receive nearly
two-thirds of the defendant's property.
Tears came to Mrs. Hamn's eyes, and
later she expressed the opinion to the
bailiff of the court that "Judge Ogden
is th? highest principled man that I
ever met." The attorneys asked for a
conference, and the three repaired to
the Judge's chambers. The case was
continued until Tuesday next for a de
cision.

OAKLAND. Jan. 22.â Dr. Btratton has
piven up all hop^s tt the recovery of the
Japanese woman shot by Singro Matsu

San Leandro is engaged at present In
Holving the riddle of her existence. W.
J. Lander3, the San Francisco insur
ance manager, perhaps the v."ealthiest
man on the county road, and one of
the largest property owners in San
Leandro, has made public a letter
which he has addressed to "our trus
tees. Board of Trade, and citizens gen
erally."
It is as follows:
<*> It Is clear to every observer that <$>
â¢Â§> San Leandro is slipping back â not <â¢â â¢
<Â§> even standing still. Also that In the <8>
â $> neighborhood of sixty houses and <$>
<Â«> stores are vacant. The next towns <Â§>
<Â«> both ways â Elmhurst and Haywards <^
<S> â are In much better condition, and <^
<$> It follows that unusual and unnec-
essary causes must exist to keep <$>
<Â«> San Leandro from enjoying at least <$â¢
<s> the same relative position and ad- <Â§>
vancement as Haywards and Elm
hurst. It is almost needless to say
that the owners of property, store
keepers and residents suffer alike,
and this will continue until the
causes which brought on the pres
ent state of affairs are removed.
Is it not the case that politics and
differences between a few in and
out bosses together with a willing
ness to attack and Impede the cap
ital already invested in the place,
are the causes malting up the sum
total of the present bad state of af
faire? I venture the opinion that
this is the case and that the efforts
of the local Board of Trade will
continue to yield nothing until a
better public spirit is created and
maintained. I have been asked how
a better public spirit can be creat

made to feel that the particular
property was overvalued and no
good anyway.
If he thought of opening a store
he was more quickly advised not to
do so and practically threatened
with trouble if he attempted 1 to
start In business. If he went abroad
in the streets at night he found
them unsafe because poorly light
ed. If he looked for paved' sidewalks
in front of the better class of pri
vate houses and along our beauti
ful shaded and level streets he
found none. These are the plain,
unvarnished facts which need the
attention of the people and which a
properly arranged public meeting
can do much to change. San Le

keepers need more business, and
property owners need a more cer

These advantages can be had if
proper steps are taken to counter

wrong ways of doing things gen

At the present time San Leandro is
actively engaged in trying to raise
sufficient capital to induce a first-class
cannery to locate in that town next
season. The committee has succeeded
in raising $3187, while they feel that
$10,000 is the least sum with which
they can go to work. Next Tuesday
evening all those interested in the wel
fare of the town will meet to see what
can be done. According to Mr. Herr
scher the locating of the cannery in
San Leandro is what is needed to turn
the tide of business interests. On one
side Haywards is growing 1 , and on the
other side Elmhurst is reaching out,
and he believes that instead of criti
cizing the moneyed men of the plac*
they should temporize and expostu
late with them. A member of the can
vassing committee has called attention
to the fact that although Mr. Landers
has severely criticized the town pub
licly,' his name does not appear in the
list of subscribers who are intent on
bringing a large cannery to the town to
give it a lift commercially.

Tesla
California's Newest
Mining Town.
In a quiet nook in the Alameda
County hills, where the Black range
frowns darkly on the rolling hills that
stretch away toward the San Joaquin
Valley, a new town has been born to
California â one that is destined, and in
fact is now, the greatest and most per
fect mining camp on the Pacific Coast.
Tesla, for such is the name of the
town, is not strictly a camp, but as
perfect a little town as it is possible to
Imagine, and its rise to the dignity of
being entitled to a place on the map is
almost as wonderful as the story of
Aladdin's palace. The difference is that
it was conjured up by the use of
wealth and fertile brains, and not by
rubbang of a lamp. Heat and light are
the moving factors in the life of Tesla,
howener, for it is the home of the army
of men who operate the immense coal
mine that g-rves the place its name.
Up to a few short weeks ago Corral
Hollow was the commonplace cogno
men of the hill-girt town, and its
claim to being known a? the habita
tion of men consisted of the mining
plant, a few antiquated farm build
ing*, a scattering of tents on the hill
sides and beside the little stream that
meanders down the canyon. Now doz
ens of neat little cottages have been
built on streets laid out on the north
bank of the arroyo, a substantial hotel
rears itself on the south ban*, stores,
a saloon, a hospital, lodging houses,
shops and many other neat structures
are rising like magic, ana Tesla pre
sents a far more animated appearance
than hundreds of towns of ten times its
size.
Xor are the building all or the
greatest of improvements. No finer or
more complete electric lighting system
â was ever Inaugurated, and a sewerage
eyatem second to none is at present
racing- with the buildings toward Com
pletion.
Corral Hollow is a famous place in
California history as the headquarters
of that notorious bandit, Joaquin Mu
riettq., who terrorized the San Joaquin
Valley for many years when Stockton
â¢was in its infancy and many other
towns that are now flourishing com
munities had not yet attained the dig
nities of names.
Among the canyons of the Black
range he made his hiding places and
the cattle/ men who rounded up their
herds in Corral Hollow during brand
ing time were constantly on the look
out for Murietta and his band of cut
throats, who thought nothing of killing
three or four men for the mere lust of
blood. Down the little valley that
leads out of the hollow toward Stock
ton, visitors are shown Castle Rock,
where Murietta's lookouts were sta
tioned to warn their leader when
bands of grim, determined men rode up
the glen with rifles at "ready," praying
for a chance to get in the bullet that
would rid California of the dreaded des
perado.
CorraJ Ho!low -was so named because
Its precipitous sides made it a natural
enclosure from which even the hardy
hill- bred cattle could scarcely escape
except toward the river. Its enduring
fame, however, rests on the immensity
of the coal deposits that have been dis
covered on its sides and on the fact that
the greatest electrician of the age had
his name perpetuated by having the
place called after him.
Eight years ago it came to the ears
of the Treadwell brothers, who located
and developed the great Treadwell
mines in Alaska, that coal deposits ex
isted in Corral Hollow, which is about
twelve miles from Livermore. Be
lieving that such deposits would be of
great value In such close proximity of
San Francisco, they began a quiet in
vestigation as to the extent and qual
ity of the coal. Becoming convinced
that an inexhaustible supply of fuel ex
isted in the interior of the mountain
they set about acquiring possession of
the rights and properties that would

give them absolute control of the coal
fields. Without attracting any great
amount of attention they bought up a
tract of country six and a half miles
long by one and a half miles wide and
began developing the deposits that they
had found existed beyond the peradven
ture of a doubt.
The greatness that the proposition
1 has assumed may be understood from
! the fa-ct that nearly two millions of dol-
I lars have been spent in development
â  and equipment work alone. By tunnel-
I ing and sinking shafts the most re
markable coal fields of the Pacific Coast
i have been mapped out and competent
engineers have estimated that there
I are from eighteen to twenty million
tons of coal already in sight. The de
posits are as remarkable for their reg
! ularity as for the extent of the deposits.
! The main tunnel of the mine taps seven
coal measures that are known to be
five and a half miles in length and
from one and a half feet to eleven feet
in width.
Their depth cannot be estimated, but
it is known to be great, for the shafts,
already down over five hundred feet,
still follow clean coal and there is
every reason to believe that the meas
ures go down many hundred feet fur
ther. Old coal miners say that it is
the most extraordinary deposit known
on this Coast from the absolute unifor
mlty in the distance between the meas
ures. Tunnels run into the hills show
that the veins are at an exact distance
apart throughout the field and of uni
form width and quality.
When the amount, extent and qual
ity of the coal had been fully deter
mined, and the future of the property
assured, it was decided to form two in
corporations, the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Coal Company and theAla
meda and San Joaquin Railroad Com
pany â the first to further develop and
equip the mines and the second to se
cure the transportation of its products
to a market. Both were formed with a

view of Interesting local capital. While
the coal company was constructing
bunkers that would contain all the coal
that they might be called on to handle,
the railroad company was constructing
a broad-gauge line to Stockton â thirty
six miles away â the best that has yet
been built in California.
The stock of the coal company was
divided into 50.000 shares at $100 each and
the following officers were elected:
President, Henry Williams; vice
president, John W. Coleman; direc
tors â Henry Williams, John W. Cole
man, E. B. Pond, Jacob C. Johnson,
James Treadwell, H. A. Williams and
R. D. Fry.
The following officers were elected to
direct the affairs of the railroad com
pany: President, R. D. Fry; vice-presi

and W. J. Bartnett.

spent in developing and equipping the
mine.
Supplied with 50-ton locomotives of
the most modern pattern and a full com
plement of up-to-date coal cars, the
railroad Is capable of handling every
ton of coal that the mine may produce
in years to come. The company ac
quired heavy tracts of land at the
junction of Mormon and Stockton
sloughs and erected substantial bunk
ers, capable of containing 1500 tons of
coal. Thus equipped and in a posi
tion to handle any output of the mine.
the owners went on developing the
mine to a still greater extent before in
vading the coal market, where compe
tition is keen and competitors powerful.
A few months ago it was decided to
begin realizing on the vast resources of
the mine and the system of mining at
first in use and known as the "long
wall" system wsfl in several workings
changed to the more modern "breast
and pillar" system.
These two systems of mining coal â
entirely different â are amply illustrated
in the Tesla. In the "long wall" system
the workings follow along the vein,
the coal being entirely worked out
after the vein is tapped.
In the "breast and pillar" system,
when the workings reach the vein, the
coal is attacked immediately. Thirty
feet of coal are dug out and then a pil
lar 20 feet along the vein is allowed to
stand. Then another 30 feet of coal is
taken out and another pillar left. When
the end of the measure is reached, or
for any reason work in that direction
is stopped, the pillars are removed, be
ginning from the end opposite the tun
nel. Thus everything that is taken out
after the vein is tapped is a market
able commodity and no labor is wasted.
From an output of fifty tons a day
the product was gradually increased
to seventy tons, then to one hundred
tons, and so on until the present out
put has reached 250 tons a day. All of
this comes out of the Eureka vein â
the largest of the seven â the product
of the others not yet having been
placed on the market.
F. J. Horswill, recently made su
perintendent, has assured the com
pany that the output can be increased
to 1000 tons a day within the near fu
ture and it has been decided to build
a modern mining town to accommo
date the employes. Thus Tesla sprang
into being, "the directors decreeing that
such should be its name and also the
name of the coal.
The first consideration was tl Â« care
ful housing of the men. and four large
rooming houses were constructed. A
fully equipped store, at which all eoods
used by miners can be purchased at
the reigning prices of the region, was
constructed; a saloon followed: a med
ical dispensary, with Dr. Jump, a com
petent physician, in charge, was built
as an annex to the store and then
streets began to appear. Eighteen cot
tages, all mat and comfortable, and
with modern appliances, were con
structed and let to men of families at
nominal rental.
The miners being cared for, the next
consideration wi^ for the stranerers
that might knock at the gates of Tesla,
and a commodious two-story hotel was
constructed, several rooms being set
aside for the accommodation of the of
ficers of the company and their friends.
Contracts have been let for a hospi
tal, in which Dr. Jump's patients may
be treated, for barber, tailoring and
shoe shop, for a library, in which the
men will be furnished with reading
matter free of charge, and for a school
house in which the twenty-five chil
dren of the camp may be educated.
The county has agreed to furnish a
schoolteacher to take charge of the
children.
Tesla's latest acquisition is a post
office, which the Government has
agreed to place there, having already
Hicnified that the name Tesla Is satis
factory.
The comfort of the miners and their
bodily health receives the utmost con
sideration at the hands of the indomit
able Treadwells. On being hoisted out
of the shaft all are at liberty to go to
the washhouse, where hot and cold
water in liberal quantities flow from
overhead pipes and soap Is found in
abundance.
The greatest rare has been taken in
the ventilation of the mine, and so free
is it from firedamp that the miners
never think of using covered lights, but j
go about their work with open lamps.
Their complaint is often that there is
so much draft through the workings
that their lights are blown out.
In order to avoid the chance of sick
ness in the camp a perfect sanitary j
Bewerage system has been laid out. ;
connecting the buildings on both sides i
of the creek with the main drain that
carries the sewage to a point far below
ttaa town.
Work never ceases at Tepla. During
the hours of the night as well as while
the Bun 1b shining the ceaseless digging
of the coal goes on, and while the coy
otes are howling acrons the hills and
the good people of the neighboring
farms are fast asleep brawny arms are
wielding pick and shovel and pouring
black diamonds Into the cavernous
bunkers. Ten hours a day Is the shift,
and the gang that quits work in the
evening is immediately replaced by
another containing an equal number of
men, the twinkling lights of whose
lamps go flitting up the hill when the
warning^vhistle blows. Night and day
are alike in the depths of the coal mine.
Miners at Tesla are better paid than
the average of their kind. Those Who
labor in the chutes and tunnels work
by contract. 60 cents a ton being the
price paid them for their work. Many
earn $100 a month or more, and a large
majority seem happy and contented in

Miners with families are at a pre
mium in Tesla, and the company is
constantly on the lookout for good,
steady men. Fifty more are needed at
once, and if found to be of the right
stripe will be put to work at once.
Superintendent Horswill has been
connected with coal mining on the Pa
cific Coast as manager or owner for
the past thirty years. His knowledge
of the details of the business, as well
as his judgment, are of a high order,
and few who do not contribute to the
welfare of the mine remain long in
Tesla.
Drunkenness in the camp is practi
cally unknown, the man having charge
of the saloon being under strict in
structions to furnish no more liquor to
r miner when once he begins to show
signs of intoxication. So with quar
reling- and fighting. Except during one
hour on Saturday afternoon bi^ s and
fisticuffs are frowned upon. During
that hour the men are permitted to re
pair to a spot on the hills and there
settle the differences that have led to
thdr hard feeling. It is generally.
'Jack, you're the best man this day,
but I'll see you again next week."
An excellent system that permits the
men to get credit, previous to' payday,
has been inaugurated. When a man's
time card shows that he has worked
three days, he is allowed to have a
book of coupons, which are accepted
in payment for goods at any of the
establishments in the town. The book
is charged to him at the end of the
month.
Economy is ever the watchword at
Tesla. No product of the mine or re
fuse of the plant goes astray. Coal
dust forms the fuel that generates
power for the ponderous hoisting ma
chinery, cinders and waste rock fill in
the inequalities of the ground or form
walks on which the r <ners may step
dry shod, and nothing is allowed to go
to waste.
The significance of the name of the
new town lies in a matter that has not
been mentioned heretofore and one
that rivais in importance the output of
the mine itself. Estimates have al
ready been made for the erection of an
immense electrical plant that will gen
erate from 25,000 to 30.000 horsepower.
Wires capable of transmitting this vast
force to Oakland, Alameda and San
Francisco will be strung and power
furnished to all who may be willing to
buy.
Electrical power now costs the aver
age consumer $120 per horsepower per
annum, but the company expects to be
able, considering the small cost of the
refuse coal that will be used to drive
the plant, to furnish power at a greatly
reduced cost. The transmission plant,
including the wfrinj? to San Francisco,
will cost about $600,000, and contracts
are already in sight that will pay in
terest on this large investnfent.
Another big project is the building
of a number of manufacturing plants
to manufacture various articles, where
fuel and power are the main items of
expense, in a large level area of the
valley below the town. These plants
will be situated between two shafts of
the mine, so that fuel can be cheaply
handled from either direction.
Now in course of manufacture in the
East is a large washing and screening
plant that wIH be put in operation
within the next three months. Its prin
ciple lies in the difference between the
specific gravity of coal and refuse and
in mines where such plants have been
placed in operation they have been
found to enhance the value of the fuel
to a very appreciable extent.
The water cleans and brightens the
coal and at the same time throws out
all "bone" and other foreign matter,
saving the fuel .even down to the dust.
Though Tesla coal has only recently
been put out in sufficient quantities to
make any kind of a show'ng, it has al
ready taken a strong hold on the lo
calities where it has been marketed.
Stockton, Sacramento, San Jose and
other interior points consume all of the
present output of the mine and little,
if any, has been sent to San Francisco.
The larger amount that will be mined
In the next few months will be sent to
this city.
The company has adopted the method
of handling the product of its mine
from the moment it is dug out of the
vein until it passes into the hands of
the consumer.
Ground has been leased and contracts
for buildings let in some interior towns
as well as in the bay cities, and bright
and energetic coalmen placed in charge.
The profit of the middlemen, a no small
item when large quantities of coal are
handled, <s thus saved to the company,
enabling the corporation to sell its pro
duct at a price that will make it a
strong competitor.
Tesla coal is a superior lignite, mak
ing a hot fire and forming very little
cinder, ash or smoke. It has been re
ported upon by a number of engineers
and chemists and in all cases the te*".ts
have been favorable. It was used by
engineers in the employ of the South
ern Pacific Company and satisfactory
results obtained.
W. R. Eckert, a well known mechan
ical engineer of this city, made a test
of the coal at the Union Iron Works
recently, and the result of his investi
gations r.re summed up in the closing
paragraph of his report, which is as
follows: "Tne coal is of uniform qual
ity, burns freely, with hardly arv
clinkers, and should give good results
as a commercial coal.*'
The practical experience of the man
ufacturers of Stockton is a still bettor
criterion of the value of Tesla coal. It
is burned in the electric light and pow
er works nf Stockton, and in a large
number of flour mills and manufactur
ing plants. Those who have used it
sufficiently long to afe#ertain how the
best results may be obtained in its use
order it by the car load and will take
no other.
As a house coal it has also proved a
success, and is destined to prove an
important factor in the coal trade of
the Pacific Coast.
An erroneous idea exists in the minds
of many coal consumers that Tesla
coal is identical with the product of
the Mount Diablo mines. Superintend
ent Horswill, who was connected with
the Mount Diablo mines for years,
states that nothing could be further
from the truth. He says that beyond
both being lignites there is little or no
resemblance between the two coals,
S Tesla being infinitely superior in every
j particular.
He estimates that the product of the
i Tesla mine is millions of years older
than the Mount Diablo coal, and was

has never before come to light in Cali

SILVER MINE
World-Famous Candela-
ria in the State of
Durango', Mex.
The Property of the Candelaria
Consolidated Mexico Min
ing Company.
Now Bonanzas of Rich OrÂ© Recently
Discovered â History of This Cel
ebrated Mine of Golconda.
The most famous silver mine In the
world to-day is the Candelaria, locat
ed in the district of San Dimas, State
of Durango, Mexico. This celebrated I
property was discovered and developed j
over 100 years ago, but instead of di- j
minishing in quantity its output has i
increased with astonishing rapidity. !
Marvelously rich in mineral, this cele
brated property has for decades past i
been regarded as a veritable Golconda,
from which its glistening riches flow i
in increasing streams.
"La Candelaria" was discovered by
n party of roving Spaniards about 1775. !
Although worked for a period sum"
ciently to indicate that the property !
was of great value its vast stores of j
silver were not reached until 1783, when j
Don Juan Jose Zambrano secured con- j
trol of the property. Although the j
possessor of four other properties in j
Durango, the don devoted his exclusive j
attention to the development of "La j
Candaleria." Its output from that time
to ISO 7, when Don Zambrano died, was !
enormous. Within that period the don i
paid over $11,000,000 in duty to the !
Spanish Government, which then ex- j
ercised authority over Mexico. As the |
duty was one-fifth of the gross amount
of all silver extracted, it follows that
the colossal sum of $55,000,000 worth of
the white metal was taken from the
mines owned by Don Zambrano. When
he died, in ISO 7, the don left a magnifi
cent palace in Durango, large proper
ty interests in various parts of Mex
ico, and the comfortable sum of $1,700,
000 on deposit in the Bank of England.
From 1807 until the period of the
Mexican War of Independence, the his
tory of "La Candelaria" Is veiled in ob-
Fourity. It was worked at intervals
by Don Zambrano's descendants, but j
the mine caving in on all sides by rea- I
son of a flood of waters, the mine lay
inactive for many years. In 1863. how
ever, the attention of American capi- j
talists was drawn to Mexico as an
advantageous field for investment, and j
in the fall of that year the mine was
purchased by an American syndicate.
Many attempts were made to relieve I
the mine of water, but they were fu- '
tile. Another long period of inaction j
followed and the mine was practically
abandoned until ISB3. when it was pur- i
chased by a few (Capitalists of San Fran-
Cisco, headed by Colonel Dan Burns.
The latest principles of mining were :
sagaciously applied, and in a compara- j
tlvely short time the property was re- |
lieved of the water which had retard
ed operations for so many years. On
January 17, 18S9, Colonel Burns reported
to the directors that the Candelaria
Consolidated Mexico Mining Company
had, during the previous twelve
months, taken out enough bullion to
yield a net profit of $502,086 31 in gold
coin. Since that time the mine has
yielded princely profits and the amount

If the contents of a suppressed Grand Jury
report are true the new C'iy Hall dome is a
great $hell beneath which unscrupulous con
tractors and Ihtee-card morUc artists have
bvnkoed the city treasury out of nearly
twenty thousand dollars
Beneath the dim light, of the dome, if D
(/'Sullivan is right (m the sweeping charge*
made in the suppressed minority report, it
was the custom of tho<e vho had undertaken
to fulfill certain definite specification* to palm,
off the most slipshod work iv the wortd as
fit rt clans.
The charges show that there vtre thousands
of dollars collected for work that was never
done at all, and that the Grand Jury itself
suppressed the scandal in order to save their
f i tends on the Board of Supervisors from the
disgrace of the revelations. The full story fol
lows:
According to O'Sullivan the building
of the dome and rotunda was the occa
~H Â«iori of many fat-salaried positions and
innumerable steals so disgraceful that
gome communities would spend thou
sands of dollars to bring the thieves to
Justice.
According to the story of the chair
man of the Grand Jury's sub-commit
SILVER BULLION FROM THE CANDELARIA READY FOR SHIPMENT.
tee, appointed for the investigation of
these frauds, thousands of dollars were
collected for work that no man ever
pretended was done, while thousands
more were expended for work that in
no mannf-r fulfilled the specifications.
The San Francisco Novelty and Plat
ing Works had the contract.
"Although nearly a thousand dollars
per month were expended as salaries
for watchmen and others to superin
tend the work." said Mr. o'Sullivan,
"tho greatest frauds ever seen abound
on all sides, as the most casual exam
ination of the work and specifications
will reveal."
Among other things the sum of $7F>O!)
was collected for copper ani gold plat
ing, none of which work was done.
Three thousand dollars was collected
j for the building of a fire-alarm station
â¢in the dome. No such station has ever
been built. If the accusations made in
the report are true those who stole the
money outbarted Black Bart.
In places where the dome should
have been furred and lathed nothing
but plaster was placed against the
stone and brick, as a result of which
th<i lime has eaten through and the
paint is crumbling away. For all this
Imperfect work no man ever forgot to
collect the highest prices prevailing for
first-class labor, according to specifi
cations.
More than $1600 was paid out for in
! ferior sheet iron work where there
should have been steel beams and
: straps. This was in the upper dome,
where the motions of the hand are sup
posed to have been quicker than the
> eye.
Under the terms of the contract
nothing was to have been sublet with
out the consent of the architect. Frank
T. Shea was the architect in this case.
Possibly he did not know the character
of the men who performed their black
art tricks in the dome.
Specifications were also made for a
stairway to the basement. The total
sum called for in the contract was col
lected without reference to such trivial

omissions as the failure to build any
stairway whatever.
There Bhould have been a cast iron
base of known dimensions on each of
the three floors of the rotunda. No
such bases were constructed, but the
contractor was paid the full amount
called for just the same as If bases as
Boliu as Gibraltar had been built to
stand the wear and tear of ages.
The contract, which it is alleged was
thus openly and shamefully violated}
is a voluminous printed document of
twenty-two closely printed legal cap
pages, known as "Contract Number 84
-Ilniunda and Dome." A copy of It
has been thoroughly marked, interlined
and thumbed by the chairman of the
sub-committee that made the sup
pveaMd minority report. Being a prac
tical contractor, he is thoroughly fa
miliar with every detail of the work.
Though not seeking any notoriety, Mr.
< > Sillivan said yesterday that he could
not remain silent any longer. He
thought it a disgrace that the Board of
Supervisors allowed the work to be
done in the loose manner that was fol
lowed, and regretted that the Grand
Jury that investigated the case sup
pressed his report and allowed the
public to be robbed Just for the sake of
saving a few derelict Supervisors. He
thought he would be &b much to blame
as any of the others if he Bhould re
fuse to make known the facts of the
case. His story is very interesting. He
said:
"I did not care to expose or speak of
the minority report submitted to the
Grand Jury, of which I was a member,
on the 13th of last December, but as
long as Captain Hobbs has seen fit to
bring the matter before the public, I
am willing to show where I think seri
ous changes, and, in places, omissions
in work, were do-ne by the parties who
held the contracts. I examined the
dome from top to bottom, and the re
sult was startling, to say the least.
The workmanship and the materials
used do not come up to the standard
as laid down by the specifications un
der contract No. 84.
"After submitting my report to the
Grand Jury, I was of the opinion that
I had done my duty, but the report has
never comje to light. The work omit
ted will amount to a much larger sum
than the changes from the orders in
the specifications, but the Changes in
themselves are of necessity a flagrant
violation (ft the trust imposed in those
who did the work. The reason I have
received for nat bringing the matter be
fore the eyes of the tax-paying public
is that the result and blame of the
whole matter would rest on tho shoul
ders of the Board of Supervisors, and
as the Grand Jury at that time felt
friendly, both as a body and as in
dividuals, toward the board the mat
ter was kept quiet, but in my report
I asked for an examination by both

"We have had the plans and specifications for said contract work at our

The ore of this celebrated mine is

gold-bearing rock, whiol) is worked up
to 85 per cent of its assay value. The
proportion of gold in the bullion aver
ages in value about one-third, while
the ore has a uniform value of over
$70 a ton. and can be mined and milled
for $s a ton or lets. A system of tun
nels extending t<> a depth of 3500 fft. t t
has been introduced, thereby dispens

All the power needed to work the"
stamp mills is developed by the water
of a creek at the foot of the mines.
The work of Improvements at the
mines has been steadil- pushed, so that
to-day better equipped mining proper
ties do not exist. The topography of
the ground renders the tunnel method
of mining more feasible and less ex
pensive than any other, BO that in the
matter of expense of working "La Can- ;

expense, on a level 750 feet below the
present working tunnel, but the results

â¢ The specifications called for a fire

contract dared to leave out work
which had been ordered and specified
for, is more than I could ever under
stand.
"It has proven to be a flagrant vio
lation of law and duty, and the city
must take the consequences. I suppose
the reason for the omissions and viola
tions of the contractors had been
made public through the ill feeling ex
isting between the Grand Jury then in
session and Attorney Creswell, the
particulars of which are well known
show that the funds devoted to this
purpose were not misapplied. Assays
of the ores unearthed along the route
of this tunnel indicated a heavier per- ;
centage of gold than was found in the
Bonanzas above. The mine has thewon
derful property of increasing in the rich-
MM of output as the depth is in
ermaed. Immense storehouses of metal
have been lately uncovered, and during
the coming year th# company will be
able to handle and work this ore.
Should the results prove as satisfac
tory as is anticipated, a large mill will
be erected on the ground.

the work which was reported to be of a
light character.
"An idea of the inferior work which
was done on the dome from the com-
mencement can be gleaned when the
matter of the steel and iron work on
the dome is looked into. The skelton or
iron frame work was about finished
when Contractors O'Conr.ell & Lewis
jtook it in hand. They refused to allow
men to work there, as they claimed the
work was poorly done, and that it might
at any moment crash in. The first con
tract was signed and bonds given, but
then a supplementary contract wa3
entered into for the purpose of recon
structing the work, and although it
was signed no bondsmen were chosen.
The result was the old contract had to
be fulfilled, and several thousand dol
lars were lost by them, which helped
to break them up in business.
"The plastering in the dome is an
other example of the steal. In place of
the furring and steel lathing which was
called for under the accepted specifica
tions, the plaster has been daubed on
the stone and brick work, and a coat
of paint was laid on. Now the lime in
the mortar is coming through, and the
paint is streaked with white, and in
many places the work has been done
over again. The stairs to the basement
are not missed by those who have not

slight wonder lingering in the minds

Grand Marshal of the Golder)
Jubilee Pcrade.
Dr. John F. Morse, the Grand Mar
shal of the Golden Jubilee parade to
be held to-morrow, Is one of the most
; deservedly popular Native Sons in the
j State. When the managers of the pa
rade committee cast around for a suit
able citizen to represent them for the
i post of Grand Marshal it was the con
| sensus of opinion that this honor
I should be conferred upon Dr. Morse.
j He has always been prominently irten-
I tified with all public movements which
! would tend to bring the Golden State
I to a position in the front ranks, and
] has even devoted his time to these af
; fairs when hie business interests called
him elsewhere. That his choice is a
popular one is demonstrated by the fact
that it gives universal satisfaction. No
j better man could be found to fulfill the
I duties, and if the parade is not a grand
success it will not be owing to any
fault or lack of endeavor of his. Dr.
Morse has a handsome suite of offices
! In the Spring Valley Water Company's
i building, corner of Geary and Stockton
streets. His large and constantly in
creasing practice is a sure demonstra
tion of his worth and his ability as a
medical man. Associated with him is
Dr. Lehners. who is also most popular
with his large circle of friends. Dr.
Morse, as Grand Marshal, will more
than fulfill the expectations of his
friends.
LONG HOURS, SMALL PAY.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald made
an investigation yesterday to learn the
causes for the recent strike in the San
Francisco Laundry which took place twr,
weeks ago. The operatives left work he
cause they claimed that the hours wero
too long. An understanding was had
with the employers, and the strikers
went back to work without much loss of
time, and under the agreement tho hours
were shortened. The Building Trades
Council asked that the strike be officially
lnvestigate-d. About a dozen of the femalo
operatives were examined J>y the Labor
Commissioner, and tht-se facts wero
learned. Before the strike they worked
sixty hours a week, and when the em
ployers increased the time to over seventy
hours many of the girls became ill. in
fact, one-fifth of them was on the sirk
list. Several of those who were compelled
to labor seventy hours were under 13
years of age, and the law prohibits opera
tivts under that age to work more than
sixty hours a week.
Since they have had the old time re
stored there has been no sickness. The
investigation also showed that many of
the younger girls work for $7 50 a month,
or about 2 cents an hour. The Labor
Commissioner will lay the facts obtained
before the convention of freeholders, with
the view of having provision made in the
charter regulating the hours of labor in
laundries.
VESSELS FOR ALASKA-
The Alaska Trade Committee is prepar
ing a complete list, with all the recent ad
ditions, of all vessels Wbfob will sail from
San Francisco for the various ports of
Alaska The list will include the names
of vessels, owners or agents, freight and
passenger capacity, price of tickets,
freight allowance and all other informa
tion of value to travelers to Alaska.
A givat many vessels which are known
to be about to engage in the Alaska trade
are b^ing held under conditional charters,
and it is not yet possible to announce
who will act as agents in booking pas
sengers and fcreight. although there is no
longer any doubt that they have been
secured for the northbound ocean trade.
In a few days it is hoped that the com
mittee can show what amount of ton
nage is actually under contract or regu
larly engaged in the Alaska trade and
what will be the monthly capacity of pas
sengers and freight of all the vessels
sailing from this port for Alaska. The
statement will also include all possible
information about the Yukon Rivei: ooats
and will be a valuable guide to travelers.
men who were trusted and who under
stood what inspection in the true sense
of the term meant."
Captain H. H. Hobbs. who was fore
man of the Grand Jury at the time the
minority report was presented, is of
the opinion that the work done in con
nection with the City Hall dome is of
a character to be scoffed at by every
taxpaying citizen in the State. He also
states that the report has never been
made public, and the specifications
calling for a certain class of work have
been neglected and a cheaper and in
ferior grade of work and material was
substituted in nearly every line of the
building and furnishing throughout the
interior and exterior of the building.
"I am of the opinion that there is
sufficient information concerning the
work which was poorly done to startle
those who have seen the dome who
were not aware of the change which
has taken place in the construction ac
cording to the specifications present
ed." said Captain Hobbs. "and I hope
that information will be given to the
public. The Grand Jury was not to
blame in the matter, as Frank T. Shea,
the architect, had the matter in his
own hands. A minority report was
submitted to the jury showing up the
frauds which had been accomplished,
but why it has not been made public
heretofore is something I cannot tell.
I am positive that the report submitted
was correct in every detail and some
serious errors or changes have been
made in building the much talked of

money to Scotty, to have a try. Scolty
turned; the Â£4 over and; over, ,and
scratched his head, but couldn't arrive

The SIGHTS AND SENSATIONS
of "COURTED INTO COURT."
Above and beyond the uninspired
Idiocy of John J. McNully "Courted Into
Court" is Messed by the personality
of Marie Dressier. There Is hope and
consolation in Miss Drossier: it is
good to know that she is in the land.
In case anything ever should happen to
May Irwin we have Marie Dressier to
fall back on. Nut that things are likely
to happen to May Irwin's sensational
health â not that! â but she might some
day take it into her genial head to re
tire; she mi^ht â who knows what these
good-natured women will do?â marry
herself to some proud prince who could
not bear to see her work; or she might
stay away from San Francisco alto
gether. It has been a long time since
Miss Irwln westward hoed, and there
is nothing in our immediate horoscope
to point her on the way. New York,
you know, finally has "discovered" May
Irwin. She can stay there now all the
year round with any old kind of a piece
and nothing to do but work night in
and night out, with never a care of
transportation or advance agents and
grow stouter and richer while we wait.
Miss Dressier makes hope deferred en
durable. She is all but May Irwln and
a magnetic considerable of her own be
sides.
â¢ â¢ â¢
According to the cant superstitions
abomt beauty that commonly obtain
Marie Dressier is not beautiful. But
she has a fascinating way of being
plain; in her physiognomy there is
something of a homely Hading, and
she shows all the warm, womanly cor
diality that Hading â if she has any at
all â conceals under a mask of snow.
Also she is probably a better McNally
farce-co-medienne than her contempo
rary of the Comedie Francaise. Have
you heard Marie Dressier sing? Her
voice is the superlative of plump joy;
it has the real essence, the snuff-col
ored tone, the just-throw-myself-away
quality that finds the true temper of
the modern coon song. Her "Ram-a-
Jam, I Want That Man" is the most
momentous Americo-Ethiopic song
burst that has happened here since
May Irwin sang "The New Bully."
I wonder if Miss Dressier has the
same attraction for women that she
has for men. Possibly not. She is
the most popular person, from the
masculine estimate, that I have seen
in fourteen months. All the men about
the town are intoning her prai?e3. I
have heard but one woman mention the
matter â and then it was to say she
thought Miss F>ressler a trifle bump
tious and rough. Never mind about
the roughness, but the bumptiousness
I admit; there is no word which better
than that describes the physical attri
butes of this large, unique young wo
man. She is bumptious to be lovable.
She revels in a vast clumsy grace that
Is vivid, personal and magnetic; she
deals in a sort of convivial hypnotism
that is immediate and fatal. But she
is as gentle as a man. You, if you
are a woman, may not consider It gen
tle in Miss Dressier to lift Mr. Lyon
by the scragg of the neck and Joust
him against the floor and poke him in
the waistcoat and titillate him on his
solar plexusâ but I. who can feel the
'fluence of this Brunhilda of McNally,
know that these are mere and momen-
tary concessions to a depraved play
writerâepisodes in which the artist's
physique is imposed upon by an acro
batic author. You may not think that
Mr. Lyon deserves his share of this
scrimmage, either; you would, per
haps, prefer to see Mr. Rice held up to
the scorn of this Juno's strength. So
would I. But Mr. Rice Is, on the con
trary, kissed â yes, kissed by Miss Dress
ier. It is not a Xethersolean kiss;
there is nothing: tumultuous, throbbing,
scorching, stifling about it; it is a plain,
slowâ l have to confess it is slow â
business-like salute with a smack at
the parting that Miss D'ressler indents
upon the oscuiatory feature of Mr.
Rice. Unworthy Rice! You may see
where the caress has left its seal. Mr.
Rice's lips wear a flattened pout; a ripe
red spot glows between the diverging
points of his mustaches â and that is
where he has been kissed. Twice blessed
and twice unworthy Rice! It has been
his specialty to be kissed by the two
most accomplished kissers in the pro
fession. He has been kissed into fame,
nectarized into notoriety. First it was
May Irwin â she had themselves kine
toscoped in the act; it was called the
May Irwin Kiss, and was patented and
copyrighted by photographers and kine
toscopers and could be seen for a nickel
in the slot. Now it is Marie Dressier
â who kisses Mr. Rice. I ask anybody if

BY ASHTON STEVENS
there Is anything in this Mr. Rice that
deserves the double distinction?
â¢ â¢
Mr. John C. Rice has fluent less .and
a fair command of dialect, but he is
not an attractive personality. There Is
ki hip manner and hin voice something
which Pets a pace la the admiration
of Rice that no one else ran keep up
with; and his very llmberness puggestH
the epicene mister of the French ballet.
Mr. Rice Is not In tune with the
healthy rest of the company. As fine
a company, by the way, as ever was
wantoned on a McNulty farce. John
Ci. Sparks hasn't his usual much to do
this time, but what there Is of the
Irishman he plays with a legitimacy
and comic seriousness that are unap
proachable. Jaques Kruger, too, does
a Harriganeeque study of a toper that
is limited only by the fragmentary
possibilities of the part, and little Miss
Sallie Cohen sings a tidy note and
plays at being Miss Dressler's servitor
cousin with a surprising degree of na
turalness. An odd bit of grotesquerie.
at this time of day, is Oscar Figman's
dude; he carries me back to the (rid
farce-comedy days at the Bush -street
Theater, where nearly every show ha<l
iis spider-legged dude, with wonderful
*skin-fltting trousers, slim satanic
6hoes and foolish low-crowned hnt. Mr.
Figman's pantomime is weird and
funny; he is altogether astonishingly
successfulâ but I should hate to think
of this once-departed caricature as
loose again with any probability of
permanence.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Since "The First Born," one never
knows what will lie in a new piece at
the Alcazar. I was easily lured by the
announcement of "an original pathetic
play in one act," written by Frederick
Paulding. In the present invasion of
farce it would be a luxury to weep a
tear or two; it would perhaps recon
cile us to the immediate future, which
is to consist of more farce. But there
were no sweet tears at the Alcazar last
week. "A Man's Love" is damp and
THE SATs' FPANTTSCO CATX, SUNDAY, JANUARY 23, 1898.
mushy enough, but it is not pathetic,
according to the pathos that is pledged
in the bill. I cannot see where a man
of Mr. Paulding's experience found the
nerve to expose it in the theater. And
his acting of the principal part would
not have been countenanced by any
stage manager other than himself.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Scheel's Symphony Gor\cert.
A programme of established modern
pieces has been selected by Mr. Scheel
for Thursday's concert at the Tivoli.
The symphony will be Dvorak's "New
World;" the ballet music, Delibes'
"Coppelia," and the overture Gold
mark's "In Springtime." Robert Franz's
version of the old Hebrew melody, "Kol
Nidre." will also be played.
Arrangements have just been com
pleted by which Henri Marteau. the
young French violinist, will be the
HOloist at one of the San Francisco
Symphony Society's concerts of an
early date.
Baldwin.
"The Girl from Paris." which com
mences an "ngagemfnt <>f three weeks
at the Baldwin to-morrow night, is one
of the most popular musical attractions
Â«'f the lighter order that has been pre
sented in years. It has a record of 1080
nights at the Duke of York's, London,
and another edition of it is now play
ing at the Herald Square Theater, New
York, where a run of 3fK> nights
recently completed. We are promised,
as nearly as possible, the production
which Edward E. Rire first gave New
York. Of course all of the originals are
not in the cast â several of them made
such reputations t.hat they are now
"out on their own" â but the present
company is said to be compact and
valuable in every particular. The pro
duction will be under the hand of
Frank Smithson. whom Mr. Rice se
cured from London, and the dancing,
which plays an important part in the
performance, will be directed by H.
Fletcher Rivers, a ballet master of rep
utation. The elaborate scenic equip
ment is the work of La Fayette W.
Seavey, an artist who needs no intro
duction.
The piece itself is said to he almost
a real comic opera, with catchy music
by Ivan Carylland a smartly humorous
book by George Dance. The presenta
tion re-quires a cast of fifty. Miss Mamie

in his hands is said to be quite as

mous "Sister Mary Jane's Top Note."

sing in the role of Nora Honeycomb,
and Mile. Fleurette, a distinguished
dancer, will exploit her newest crea
tion. 'La Parisienne." Rice may be de
pended upon for a comely chorus and a
good orchestra leader.
California.
"Courted Into Court" promises to
have a crescendo second week at the
) California. The town is just awaken
ing to the fact that Marie Dressier,
i John O. Sparks and Jaques Krueger are
i a farce-comedy trio that would be hard
jto beat. The attraction to follow is
j Black Patti'p Troubadors, headed by
i the redoubtable Slspurieta Jones her
; self. The fifty members of the com
pany are all born that wayâ not col
ored â and are said to reach the limit
of emancipated song, dance, specialty
: and spectacle. They will bring a num-
I ber of new songs. The performance Is
i divided in two partsâ one, a musical
farce, called "At Jolly Coon-ey Island."
the other a novel vaudeville olio.
Alcazar.
"The Arabian Nights." one of the
best of Sydney drundy's adapted farces,
will be revived at the Alcazar next
week. Tho adventures of the unsophis
ticated but sporty Humminirtop with
his fair deceiver and his mother-in-law
are too well known to require ampli
fication at this time of day. "The
Arabian Nights" has always been a
safe pifce in San Francisco since its
introduction years ago by Joe Holland
and Georgia Drew Barrymore. It was
one of the most successful of the many
Prawley i>n>.i actions and did well at
the Alcazar lust year. Although the
cast has not been announced at the
time of writing it is reasonably safe to
say that Wright H'intinirton will be rhe
Hummingtop and Mrs. Bates the moth
er-in-law. The curtain will be raised
with "One Touch of Nature."
The opening performance will take
place on Monday afternoon, a "Jubilee"
matinee being the order at the Alca
zar.
OrpKeum.
"VChethf>r the other theaters ax: of
fering pood shows or bad, yod tro al
ways sure of finding something that
Â«is worth the while at the Orpheum. The
house has a standard and lives up to
it fairly well. Now and then 9 bad
turns mar a programme, but on the
I whole there is not a variety house In
I the land that offers as good a bill year
j in and year out.
: There are several new features on the
, bill for the new week, prominent
I among which is Carletta. who styles
! himself "The Human Lizard," and is
I said to be practically boneless. Dol
llne Cole, another newcomer, claims to
Ibe "America's greatest female bary
! tone." Monday night will mark her ini
tial bow to a San Francisco audience.
The comedy portion of the bill will be
1 contributed by Al Wilson, the famous
Dutch comedian, and Crimmins & Gore
in their screamingly funny sketch.
\N bat Are the Wild Waves Saying."
; The biograph will have an entirely new
1 set of views.
The Knaben-Kapelle has been re
tained for another week, but this will
positively be their last.
The hold-overs will include Gallando,
claymodeler, Almont & Dumont, in mu
sical specialties, and Rice & Elmer,
horizontal bar performers. A Jubilee
matinee will be given Monday.
TiVoli.
This week will be the last* of "Brian
Boru" at the Tivoli. The management
I had hoped for a better success with an
opera that was such a tremendous go
in New York, and spared no pains in
the production. There are several con
certed pieces and one or two of the
solos that are worth hearing. The cast
is a long one. including Arthur Donald
son in the part of Brian, Thomas C
Leary as the Pat O'Hara, Florence
| W alcott as Erlna. Edith Hall as Baby
Malone. Tillie Salinger as the English
Princess and Fred Kavanagh as little
Johnnie Dugan. The next piece will be
"The Pearl of Pekin," with Edwin
Stevens as the great Tyfoo. This will
open a new season of the lighter at
tractions, including Hopper's success,
"Dr. Syntax." "Angeline." "Made
laine," a new burlesque on the subject
Of "Sinbad the Sailor." and finally the
second of the Tivoli's annual reviews.
which will be entitled, "Round About
Town."
Morosco's.
Vhe attraction for the week ut Mo
rosco's will be Frank Harvey's sensa
tional melodrama of English life, enti
tled "Brother for Brother." It is a
story of the tragic revenge planned by
Jasper Crane upon Anthony Radford.
a wealthy iron founder who, led to be
lieve his first wife dead, renrnrries, only
to discover that his second marriage is
void and his son illegitimate. However,
the ending is happy, as Crane finally
relents sooner than live op to his re-
venge.
The pathos of the plot is relieved by

voted to a parting gift to the teachers.
A concert programme, to which Michal
ena. the tenor, and Marquardt, the vio
linist, will contribute solos, will pre
cede the performance of "Olivette."
An especially interesting programme
is that of the opening of Anton Schott's
second season of song recitals, which

torium on Friday evening". Songs by
Beethcven, Schubert and Schumann
will be sung by Mr. Schott and Mrs.
Richards.

The gross yield for 1597. shown above, segre
gated, is approximately as follows:
Gold .43 51-100
Silver 24 24-100
Copper 23 J-S-liX)
Lead 6 37-100
The year's combined product of the metals
herein treated of, is the greatest in the his
tory of the country, that of gold, $89,830,597,
being above any previous record officially re
ported; and the world's output of gold for 1397
âapproximately $240.O00,0O>>â is surprisingly
large and more than 10 per- cent greater than
estimated by me six months ago. The most
notable Increases have been In the British pos
sessions of thÂ» Northwest. Australasia, South
Africa, the United States of America- and
Mexico. "

The lion of strength and vigor sometimes becomes entangled and held in
the net of disease. The fable has it that once a little mouse released a
lion from the toils that bound him.
R#l'P'A#SR # I'P'A#S TabuSes
are simple little things, but they possess the peculiar qualities that will
serve to release every unfortunate from any thrall of knots and threads
of disease that was ever created by a disordered stomach, a disarranged
digestive apparatus, or a sluggish liver. Ripans Tabules
ARE AN INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST SICKNESS,
and can be carried in the pocket or portemonnaie. One Ripans Tabule
taken after each meal will set a dyspeptic free from the entangling meshes
of disease ; because nearly every ailment is a direct result of a disordered
digestion, and Ripans Tabules overcome the cause and cure the disorder.

BIG RAILWAY
ENTERPRISE
The Stockton and Tuol
umne County Rail-
road Company.
Line to Be Completed to Copper
opolis by August
Next.
Energetic Women at the Head of the
Projectâ Advantages of
the Road.
The Stockton and Tuolumne County
Railroad Is an enterprise of vast im
portance to California. Headed by
women and men of energy and backed
by large capital the project of building
the line is now well under way, and
will be speedily pushed to completion.
Commencing at Stockton the road will
be in operation as far as Copperopolls
by August of this year, and as far as
Sonora and Summerville by December.
The personnel of the company is as
follows: Annie Kline Rikert, president;
Jabish Clement, vice-president; Magpie
Downing Brainard. treasurer; Robert
S. Clarke, secretary.
The directors are Annie Kline Rikert.
Maggie Downing Brainard, Hannah
lieweDa Lane, Jabish Clement and So
phia Rother Gould.
The characteristic features of the<i
country traversed by the new line are
prominent. Its western terminus is at
fttrxkton, where communication with
tide-water is had. The Stanislaus River
to crossed at Copperopolis. Within a
distance of sixty miles on a direct line
eastward the principal mines of the
mother lode are reached at Sonora,
goulsbyville, Cherokee and Summer
ville (Carter's postoffice). The survey
of the road follows this line, except to
avoid obstacles which naturally inter
vene in a mountainous country. The
first twenty miles or so east of Stock
ton is through a grain region, then a
few miles of pasture lands, reaching a
mile or two into CalaveraÃ County.
Then comes the belt of copper mines,
of which < 'opperopolis is the center,
with successful gold mines in the same
district, and extending thence to the ,
eastern terminus of the road at Sum
merville. The Stanislaus River is
crossed between Reynolds Ferry and
the Great Canyon of the Stanislaus,
and the route is thence up the divide
between Mormon and Bear creeks,
crossing the mother lode between the
Alameda and Rawhide mines. A short
tunnel will be needed west of Copper
opolis and another through Table
Mountain, a basaltic formation stand
ing like a wall from 200 to 300 feet
above the surrounding country, but not
very thick.
So-nora. a fine town of 3000 or more
inhabitants, is easily reached, this
rlaoe having an altitude of 2000 feet. ;
Rummerville, ten miles farther on, has
an elevation of 3000 feet, and is easily
reached from Sonora. The celebrated
Dead Horse mine is at Summerville, as
well as the Providence, Lady "Wash- \
ton. Grizzly, Black Oak and others in
this eastern belt.
The business to be done by the road
will be derived from the grain and hay
of the agricultural or western end, !
while the mines will furnish vast
quantities of concentrated sulphurets
and rebellious ores which can most
easily be reduced at the large estab
lishments on the coast. The high
transportation charges have almost
prohibited this class of freight. Roof- ;
ing and building slate, lime, granite
and most beautiful marble are all pro
duced in Tuolumne County and would
furnish an ever increasing amount t<>

be erected in Sonoma is to be built of |

this granite and marble. This road Just
reaches the great sugar pine belt of the
Sierras and very soon the lumber trade
will be a grand item.
The cost of the road has been esti
mated at from $700,000 to $750,000.
Heavy rails will be used and plenty of
ties to support them. The surveys, In
charge of Henry A. Brainard, chief
engineer, have not been so far com
pleted that his estimates are available.
He has assumed 119 feet per mile as
the maximum grade, and if possible
will reduce it to 106.
Estimates of the amount of freight
to be carried and the development of
the mining region, which is now fairly
booming, promise that from the date
of the first train profit will result and
that dividends will be made at the end
of the flrat season. Stock is being rap
idly taken by the Tuolumne County
people, who say they are bound to
make it a people's railroad.
NOT (m EAR-CHEWER.
Ex-Officer J. G. Maloney Inadver-
tently Placed in a False
Position.
The story in yesterday's Call that Re
corder Glynn is to be hauled over the
coals by the Grand Jury has set the of
ficials and clerks in the City Hall to
talking, and while some were surprised
there were others who did not take the
account of the charges made kindly, and
these were mostly the employes of the
said official. There was one statement
that did cause surprise to all, and that
was that the complainant, J. G. Mal
oney, had been dismissed from the Po
lice Department for biting off a piece of
a brother officer's ear. As a fact an un
intentional Injustice was done to Mr.
Maloney. The latter has never developed
any cannibalistic propensities or taste
for human meat. The facts of the case
were that ex-Officer Nels Field got into
trouble with some fellows near the old
race track and one of the gang bit off a
piece of the bluecoat's ear.
Officer Maloney was In that district and
failed to arrest the ear-chewing rough,
taking the position that the row between
Field and nls assailant was of a per
sonal nature and that If Officer Field

Interchange Slides.
The California Camera Club gave an
exhibition of interchange slides in its
rooms in the building of the Academy of
Sciences on Friday. Slides were ex
hibited from the Redlands Club of Red
lands, Cal., and the St. Louis Club of St.
Louis, Mo. The former club sent twenty
one slides and the latter seventy-nine.
They were projected upon a canvas by
the means of a strong oxy-hydrogen
light. The views sent by the Redlands
Club were upon the irrigation system of
Southern California. Among them was
an excellent picture of the famous Bear
Valley dam, which was constructed at an
altitude of 6500 feet and a cost of $100,000.
The contributors to these views were T.
R. Griffiths, W. S. Crawford, K. C. Wells,
J. H. Williams and Marion Williams. Of
the views sent by the St. Louis Club fifty
were by John B. Holman. showing the
havoc played in St. Louis by the cyclone
of May 27. Ifltfc The other contributors
to the views of the St. Louis Club were
John W. Dunn, Robert E. M. Bain, W. A.
Haven and D. B. Howard.
THEIR KLONDIKE OUTFITS.
One Party of One Hundred Per-
sons Coming F r on) Indiana.
Reports received by the Alaska Trade
Committee from all parts of the country
continue to be most encouraging and In*
dicate that the number who will make
Ban Francisco their outfitting point in
Iheir journey to the far north has not
been overestimated.
E. C. Sherman of Chicago has gathered
from the different parts of Indiana, In
cluding some nine or ten towns, a party
of over 100, whom he has interviewed in
dividually and has persuaded to come this
way. Much good work is being done in
this way and many people have been in
terviewed who have signified their inten
tion of coming, but this party has posi
tively decided to come this way.
Arrangements have been made to take
space in the Mining Fair, and an exhibit
showing Just what is needed will be
placed there. It is contemplated that a
cooking department will be added and
the preparation of food used in the Klon
dike will be demonstrated. The literature
of the committee will be distributed and
an attractive display will be made.

THE SAN FHAyCISCO CALX,, SUNDAY, JANTTART 23, 1898.
ANOTHER WHACK
TAKEN AT DUNN
California Travelers Resign
From the Larger Asso
ciation.
"Inner Circle" Men Relieve Their
Feelings in a Most Caustio
Resolution.
The book telling the harrowing story nf
the war between the members of the
California Commercial Travelers' Associ- i
atlon and Emmett Dunn is almost writ- â â 
ten. One of the final chapters was com
pleted on Friday at a meeting of the
"inner-circle men.' At that meeting the
following resolution was adopted unani
mously:
Whereas, Emmett Dunn, president of
the San Francisco Commercial Travelers'
Association, has not been content with
making an uncalled-for tight against the
representatives of some of the largest and
moat influential firma in this city, deal
ing with them in a manner supported
by no decent methods of parliamentary
procedure and showing that his acts were
animated by personal malice, but has pro
ceeded to the extremity of making it ap
pear that the commercial travelers of this
rlty in general are working against the
interests of the retail grocers; therefore,
: % it
Resolved, That the members of the Cali
fornia Commercial Travelers' Association
as a body resign from the San Francisco
Commercial Travelers" Association, thus
showing that as a body and individually
we sympathize with the retail grocers in
the existing trouble and wish to work in
harmony with them.
The names of those resigning, exclusive
of the "suspended," are: J. Mitchell.
Jackson Wilson, S. C. Everts. Harry
Roesler, Peter Brunsing, E. A. James,
AJex McDonald. Con Orau. J. H. Sheeley,
James Gray, W. W. Brackett, S. Greene
wald, A. Patrick. Thomas Fleming. Most
of the resignations, made individually by
letter, were mailed last evening. Harry
Roesler, the treasurer of the San Fran
iisi,. Travelers, will turn over the sum
i of $65, all there Is in the treasury, to
day.
The California Travelers will hold a
; picnic in June in conjunction with the
Retail Grocers' Asoclatlon. They will
! also charter a tallyho and six and appear
i in the Jubilee parade.
Spanjer Eager to Fight.
Sol Levinson, the boxing-glove maker,
was uptown on Friday trying to get a
substitute to fight Spanjer of Sacra
mento, who was matched to fight
"Spider" Kelly, the match falling
through. The Sacramento Athletic Club
had sent Levinson a letter requesting
him to get any good 13S-pound substitute.
Billy Gallagher and "Kid" Parker are
both thought of in this connection. Gal
lagher will go to Sacramento and fight
on the 30th inst. if he can fight at 14j
poundsâ that is, weigh In here at that fig
ure at 3 p. m. before starting for the
capital.
Organizing the Tailors.
E. S. Christophersen, organizer for the
Journeymen Tailors of America, has been
holding shop meetings of the tailors in
this city to urge them to Join the national
body.
The tailors in this city have an inde
pendent union, and It is Mr. Christopher
sen's mission to unite this with the na
tional body, as it has been found to
be a constant menace to the interests of
the organization at large. Journeymen
tailors coming to thlÃ city cannot Join
the local union by simply depositing a
card from the national body, as would be
the case if it were affiliated. Ao a nat
ural result, man/ of them, unwilling to
pay anothf-r initiation fee. procure work
in non-union shops and are lost to both
bodies.
Another objection to the independent
union is that it has no authority to i.^sue
a label, am! It Is impossible to hay.> :i
suit of clothing bearing the union label
made in San Francisco. So far. Mr.
Chrlstophersoo nas been quite successful,
and has wurked up a great deal of en
thusiasm.
Next Thursday evening a mass-meeting.
to which all journeymen tailors in the
city are Invited, wfll be held at 11.19 Mis
sion street, and final action will then be
taken. If the local union refuses to Join
the international as a body a new union
will be formed of those willing to Join.

LABOR'S SONS
TO JOIN HANDS
The Breach Between the Cen
tral Bodies May Soon Be
Healed.
Joint Arbitration Committees Ap
pointed to Take the Matter
in Hand.
The prospects are that within a few
weeks at the furthest the two great cen
tral labor bodies* In this city will be unit
ed, or at least a compromise will be ef
fected whereby they can work in har
mony.
The original central body Is the San
Francisco Labor Council, chartered by
the American Federation of Labor, but
some years ayo there was a division In
the ranks and a number of the affiliated
unions drew out. As the majority of the
seceding unions were of the building
trades, an Independent body known as
the Building Trades Council was formed,
which has since operated very success
fully. The carpenters also formed an in
dependent body known as the Carpenters'
District Council, but a few months ago
all the Carpenters' unions in the city sent
representatives to the Building Trades
Council, although they still have their
District Council in which grievances are
first ventilated.
From time to timÂ« efforts have been
made to unite the two main bodies. Com-
I mlttees have been appointed from each
I aide and conferences Innumerable held,
; but all with the same resultâ a disagree-
I ment over some trivial point and a widen
j ing of the breach. When the Kelso case
was first brought before the attention of
the Union men the Labor Council appoint
ed a committee to work In co-operation
with the committees from the other two
bodies, and ever since that time the ele
ment favoring affiliation has been gradu
ally growing stronger, until at the last
meeting of the Building Trades Council a
committee was appointed to take the mat
ter in hand, and a communication sent to
the Labor Council requesting it to take
similar action. The communication was
received at last night's meeting and the
request at once complied with.
The committees will flrnt endeavor to
havo the two bodies brought directly to
| gether and Incorporated into one another,
but if they are unable to do this they
hope to have a joint arbitration commit
tee appointed which will look after all
matters of common Interest.
