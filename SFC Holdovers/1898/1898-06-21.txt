PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica, June 20.â
Advices received here late this afternoon
announce the arrival off Santiago of the first
division of the American army of invasion
under command of Major General William
R. Shafter.
No attempt was made during the day,
according to the report, to land American
troops.
( ri lia/fcer, mv iiiferma
tion says, after his arrival had a
conference with Admiral Samp
s' >n. They discussed at length
the information obtained by Ad
miral Sampson's scouts as to the
most available landing places in
the vicinity of Santiago and sent
further scouting parties along the
coast. In to-day's parties were
representatives of the army, as
signed to duty by General Shaf
ter. They inspected the points
considered by Admiral Sampson
to be most advantageous and the
commanders of the army and
navy speedily will decide where
*o land troops.
Tremendous enthusiasm was
awakened among the men with
Admiral Sampson's fleet by the
arrival of American troops. They
gave cheer after cheer, the report
states, and their enthusiasm met
with an equally hearty response
from the troopships. The re
peated delays in the departure of
the army from Tampa had made
the men with the fleet impatient
and they awaited the coming of
their allies with great anxiety.
For more than ten days they had
had nothing to do aside from pre
venting the escape of Admiral
Cervera's fleet from the harbor.
The officers and men, the fleet
having done all the damage pos
sible preparatory to the landing
of troops, were anxious for more
active warfare.
From an early hour on Sunday
morning every vessel in Admiral
Sampson's fleet was on the look
out for the transports. The ad
miral had been advised from
Washington that the troopships
probably would join its fleet
some time during the day, but no
sign of the invading army had
been seen when the sun went
down.
It was known here early this
morning that the American army
was nearing Santiago, however,
the news having been brought by
Captain List of the Ethel wood, j
which arrived from Philadelphia !
at 7 o'clock. Captain List re- i
ported that he had passed two of |
the troopships fifty miles north j
from Cape Maysi yesterday
morning. He could not distin
guish the names of the vessels, I
but they were numbered 6 and]
The San Francisco Call
18. The troopships, -.. coavo}^^
by a gunboat and a converted
yacht, were heading to the south
east.
"The gunboat," said Captain
List, "stopped me with a blank
shot, and. after learning my iden
tity, demanded the news. I gave
her what information I had and
asked where she was going. She
would not answer that question.
The ships were very large ones,
and it seemed to me they were
heading straight for Porto Rico,
inasmuch as they were going
south of Greater Inagua Island.
But they may be taking that
course merely to keep out of
sight of land. If the latter sup
position is the correct one, then
the troops are off Santiago this
morning."
The enemy has been working
for two weeks to concentrate a
strong force in the vicinity and
Spanish troops have been sum
moned from various parts of
Eastern Cuba. General Linares
must meet General Shafter's
army with a smaller force than he
had expected, owing to the ne
cessity of leaving several thou
sand troops to guard Guantan
amo. Now that the marines at
Camp McCalla have become
firmly entrenched there the Span
iards must divide their forces to
defend both cities. Our forces
thus are about to reap another
decided advantage through the
successful landing of marines _>n
; the eastern shore of Guantanamo
I Bay.
Upon the ability of the troops
to stand climatic conditions, at
this season in Cuba, will depend
in a great measure the time to
be selected for the advance upon
i Havana. If the regulars are able
I to keep in as good health as have
| the marines at Camp McCalla
I you may expect to hear of speedy
developments in the situation.
I am told the men under Gen
i eral Shafter, despite their experi
ence of thirteen days in close
! quarters aboard the transports,
are in good health. They are
eager to get at the Spaniards and
stirring scenes are certain to
mark their landing.
The transports and convoying
warships, according to this re
port, were last seen at 8 o'clock^

How Frightened Spaniards at Manila
Prevented the Destruction of
Torpedo Boats.
MANILA BAY, June 17 (via Hongkong), June 20. â Rear Admiral Dewey still has
power to throw the Spaniards into a fit by a mere intimation that he intends to attack them.
Last Tuesday a report was received that they intended making a torpedo attack against the
fleet. Half a gale was blowing at the time and this gave them great weather advantages,
but Admiral Dewey sent the Concord and Callao to forestall any such movement, and, be
sides, the fleet carried out the usual precautions that had been taken every night.
Preparations made on Wednesday gave the Spaniards a little surprise party. Admiral
Dew^ey decided to send a steam launch past the batteries into the Pasig River to destroy two
torpedo craft known to have taken refuge there. Ensign Caldwell, the admiral's staff secre
tary, volunteered to command the expedition. Dewey intended to order the Callao, Lieuten
ant Tappan commanding, to tow the launch to the mouth of the river, where the Callao was
to wait until Ensign Caldwell's return, the water being too shallow for the ships to ma
neuver. Ensign Caldwell was to dash in during one of the rain squalls, most frequent every
night, explode a spar torpedo under the torpedo-boats, and then, if possible, return to the
Callao. The enterprise was one fraught with deadly peril for all engaged in it, but both offi
cers were eager to undertake it. However, the Callao's preliminary reconnoissance on Wed
nesday so alarmed the Spaniards that they sunk the transport steamer Cebu across the nar
rowest part of the river's entrance, thus effectually closing it against even a steam launch,
and at the same time preventing the exit of their own torpedo craft.
The rebels are doing little now, except to keep the Spaniards closely pinned up in
Manila. Owing to the shooting of native civilians in Manila without trial, by Spaniards, Gen
eral Aguinaldo refuses to arlow the wife and children of Governor Augusti to be set at lib
erty. They are treated kindly, but General Aguinaldo sent a letter yesterday to Governor
Augusti in reply to the latter' s inquiry, proffered through the British Consul and Admiral
Deiderichs of the German navy, for the release of Senora Augusti and her children. General
Aguinaldo declines to say what message he sent to Augusti, but he remarked that he thought
the latter would not shoot .any more non-combatant natives.
The health, of the squadron continues very good. The wounded Spanish prisoners in
Cavite are generally doing well and are very grateful to the surgeons of our ships who per
formed several difficult operations for their relief. A southwest monsoon has set in with its
usual heavy rain.

would be due at Guantanamo
about 5 o'clock this morning and

Port Antonio, is, therefore, con
sidered here to be true.

THREE DAYS
FOR LANDING
OF TROOPS
Shafter Will Give His Men
a Rest Before At

Movement on Santiago to Be Be
gun as Soon as They Have
Been Refreshed.
NEW YORK, June 20.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: General Shatter
with his army doubtless has reached
Santiago, but up to a late hour neither
the Secretary of the Navy nor the Sec
retary of War has been officially ad
vised of his arrival in the vicinity of
Admiral Sampson's fleet.
"It is possible," said Adjutant Gen
eral Corbin, "the troops have reached
their destination, but up to this time
we have nt*t received a. word from
Shafter. We shall probably hear the
news first through press dispatches.
General Shafter is not given to rushing
reports to headquarters until he has
something to report. Under the cir
cumstances we hardly expect anything
from him until he has accomplished
something in the line of progress. It
is not an e^.sy job to land 15,000 or 20,
000 men in small boats.
"It is estimated the landing may be
accomplished in three days. I do not
imagine General Shafter intends to
land his men directly from the trans
ports and march them up in battle
lines. Some of the troops have been on
board the ships for from eight to ten
days, and it will require a day or two
for them to 'lose their sea legs.' Then
General Shafter, as a prudent com
manding officer, will want to brace his
men up with some fresh provisions,
ment made In these dispatches last
week, quoting Chairman Hull of the
House committee as authority for the
prediction that another call for volun
teers would be Issued, is likely to be
verified soon. Instead of 75,000, the
number will probably be 100,000. This
new call will be made by reason of the
determination reached at the Cabinet
meeting on Friday to rush re-enforce
ments to General Shafter at Santiago
*and dispatch a big expedition to cap
ture Porto Rico at once. The addi
tional force sent to Shafter will com
prise fully 8000 men. Adjutant General
Corbin, by order of General Miles, to
day telegraphed to the commanders at
Mobile and Chickamauga to rush the
preparations to embark troops for Por
to Rico.
Authoritative Information has reach
ed Camp Alger to the effect that only
one brigade, consisting of three regi
ments, is to be sent to Santiago. The
regiments chosen are the three most
perfectly equipped â the First Rhode
Island and the Sixth and Ninth Massa
chusetts. The other regiments which
were to have been sent to Fernandina â
the Sixth Illinois, Eighth Ohio, Third
and Sixty-fifth New York, Thirty-third
and Thirty-fourth Michigan, and possi
bly the One Hundredth and Fifty
ninth Indianaâ are to join the Porto
Rico movement and will not go to Fer
nandina at all.
Major H. O. Howard, quartermaster
In chief of the corps, left camp last
night to arrange for transportation to
Santiago. Going first to Hampton
Roads, he was instructed to arrange
there to have the regiments named car
ried from Dunn Loring to Newport
Ttfews. There they are to be put aboara
transports and sent directly to Cuba.
While arrangements are being made
for re-enforcements to be sent to Shaf
ter it is not because there is any great
need of them, but because men will
have to be left at Santiago when the
regulars are moved on to Porto Rico.
The capture or destruction of Cervera's
fleet is of course the real object of lay
intr siege to Santiago, although the city
will be held after capture.
Excepting Santo Domingo, Santiago
de Cuba is the oldest city in the new
world. It was founded only eighteen
years after Santo Domingo, which was
established by Columbus.
RE-ENFORCEMENTS FOR
GENERAL SHAFTER
Several Thousand Additional Troops
Will Be Hurried to
Santiago.
WASHINGTON. June 20.â 1t was an-
l nounced at the War Department to
day that no additional transports oth^r
than the Newport, which had been im
! pwraed on the Pacific Coast, had been
I obtained. Of the eleven ships available
by the department in the East, ar
rangements are being made to have a
half dozen or more rendezvous at Tam
pa for the purpose, presumably, of car
rying additional re-enforcements to
General Shatter. Just what portion of
General Shafter's re-enforcements are
to be taken from Tampa is not yet an
nounced, but with a hail' dozen ships
at its command the department ought
to be able to transport approximately
2000 soldiers with their equipments and
subsistence stores. Most of the re

giving them a chance to freshen up be
fore being taken into battle. All those
little details must be looked after, for it
would be downright cruelty to expect
men who have been crowded upon
transports to wade ashore and proceed
to climb the hills surrounding Santiago
before they have had time to get into
fighting condition. Under the circum
stances I do not look for Shafter's men
to get into action for several days. It
is possible some landsmen among the
troops may be sick from the effects of
the trip. A few hours upon land and
plenty of fresh Tftater will bring them
around all right:
"In the army as in the navy the com
manding officers do not have time to
rush to the telegraph office and report
to- headquarters every movement they
make, or intend to make."
It was this plain, straightforward
statement General Corbin made with
out betraying the plans of the Invading
forces or indicating where the troops
are expected to land. It is sufficient to
know the troops are supposed to have
reached a point where they can co-op
erate with the naval forces under Ad
miral Sampson, and soon as the com
manding officers of the two forces have
an opportunity to meet and confer as
to the best method to be employed
against the Spaniards the attack upon
Santiago will commence. When the
command is given to advance there will
be no halting until the American flag
flies triumphantly over the ancient city
of Santiago.
malnder, it is expected, will be taken
from Camp Alger, amounting. It Is said,
to a brigade. The latter will leave the
country by way of Norfolk or New
port News, going in the vessels Har
vard and Yale.
Secretary Alger was asked this after
noon just how heavy re-enforcements
would be sent to General Shafter, but
he declined to state definitely the num
ber, saying, however, in a general way,
that there would be between 5000 and
10,000 men.
The lack of suitable vessels for carry
ing supplies of fresh refrigerated beef
I for the army in Cuba, as well as for
the starving people there, is proving
very embarrassing to the officials of the
commissary general's office. Nearly
a week ago General Egan opened bids
for supplying this necessary article of
the soldiers' diet, and would have
awarded contracts before this but for
| the reason that there are no ships
I available to carry the supplies. The
; ships when obtained will have to be

GENERAL BLANCO
WILL NOT EXCHANGE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 20.â The fol
lowing was received to-day from Com
modore "Watson:
"The Captain general states that the
Spanish Government refuses to ex
change the prisoners."
Hobson and his men are the prison
ers in question.
KEY WEST. Fla_, June 20, 11:30 a. m.
â It is learned from naval officers here
that Captain General Blanco has noti
fied the blockading fleet that he will
hereafter recognize no flag of truce,
adding that every vesse. within six
miles' range will be fired upon, whether
flying the Stars and Stripes or a white
flag.
It seems that the events which led
up to General Blanco"s letter began
with the sending of the Maple under
charge of Captain Ludlow to open ne
gotiations for the exchange of Lieuten
ant Hobson and other Merrimac pris
oners. General Blanco's letter was ad
dressed to the monitor Terror's cap
tain (Ludlow). After refusing to nego
tiate for the exchange of the prisoners
he delivered the ultimatum as to boats
with flags of truce.
MADRID, June 20.â Premier Sagasta,
when questioned on the subject to-day,
said nothing had been deemed "in spite
of the American reports," regarding the
exchange of Naval Constructor Hobson
and his companions, who were captured
by the Spaniards after they sank the
collier Merrimac in the narrow channel
leading into the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 20.â F.
W. Ramsden, the British Consul at
Santiago, now acting foi the United
States in the negotiations with the
Spaniards for the exchange of Lieuten
ant Hobson and his comrades of the
Merrimac expedition, has suggested to
the officials at Washington that even a
ransom might be paid to secure the
prompt release of the American prison
ers. That idea was undoubtedly ex
pressed in the cable dispatches which
passed through the colonial authorities
here, but in what form it was shaped
is not clear.2

MADRID, June 20.â The reason why
the Government, after much discussion,
has finally decided not to release Hob
son and his comrades of the Merrimac
was that t'.ie result of their return to
the United States would be the pause
of a popular demonstration resulting

Number of Regular Army
Officers in the Volnteer
Service.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 20.â An addi
tional army corps, to be known as the
eighth, is to be created. It will he com
posed of the troops assigned to the
Philippine Islands and will be in com
mand of General Merritt.
The creation of the new corps is by
direction of the President and authority
is conferred upon General Merritt to
transfer the command of the corps to
the next officer in rank at such time
as he may deem it expedient to do so,
as a matter of military administration,
In order that he may be left free to de
vote his attention to important matters
of the government connected with the
Philippine Islands.
There is reason to believe that the
creation of the new corps is the follow
ing out of an idea suggested by General
Merritt himself. Upon his arrival at
the Philippine Islands General Merritt
will transfer the active command of the
corps to Major General Otis, now his
second in command.
As military governor of the Philip
pines General Merritt will have so
many duties of an administrative char
acter to perform that it would be im
practicable for him to retain the active
command of the troops on the Island.
He would be, of course, the supreme
military authority in the Philippines,
but direct command of the force there
will devolve upon General Otis.
Promotions of the following regular
army officers will shortly be announced,
the officers in each case being Klven
commissions in the volunteer service
and assigned to the staff of General
Merritt:
Major James H. Barry to be lieuten
ant colonel and assistant adjutant gen
eral.
Major F. H. Crowder to be lieutenant
colonel and judge advocate.
First Lieutenant Charles T. Potter,
corps of engineers, to be lieutenant
colonel and chief engineer.
Captain C. W. Whlpple, Ordnance
Department, to be lieutenant colonel
and inspector general.
ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO
ASSASSINATE BLANCO
Story Circulated at Washington
Which Seems to Have a Poor
Foundation.
NEW YORK, June 20.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: A
story is in circulation here to-night of
the attempted assassination of Cap
tain General Blanco by Mariano Salva,
a young Cuban member of the volun
teer army, and of a condition of af
fairs in Havana bordering on revolu
tion as a consequence.
The party circulating the story says
the news comes from a Havana paper,
but he was unable to produce the paper
to-night or give its name. At the Cu
ban legation it is stated that few if
any Havana papers reach the United
States nowadays and it is doubted if
any paper would be permitted to pub

happened.

ON BOARD HERALD-CALL DISPATCH BOAT SOMERS N.
SMITH, OFF SANTIAGO, June 19, via KINGSTON, Jamaica, June
20.â The auxiliary cruiser St. Louis, after many attempts to cut the
Kingston cable, finally succeeded Saturday night.
The men detailed from her crew found and severed the cable less
than a mile from Morro Castle. Her first attempt, which was made
earlier Saturday, as I cabled you, was a failure. She continued her
search, however, despite continued firing from shore, and at last ac
complished her task.
By the severing of the cable from Santiago to Kingston the Span
iards in Cuba are shut off from all communication with their home Gov
ernment. The only line on the south side now is that from Cienfuegos
to Santiago, but that will be of no use to Admiral Cervera. He can, by
it, communicate with General Blanco, but the latter has no way of get
ting information to Madrid.
DON CARLOS
YET TALKING
Pretender Poses as Hav

WHY HIS PLANS CHANGED
WOULD NOT INTERFERE WHILE
WAR WAS BREWING.
Tells How Admiral Cervera Has a
Chance of Preserving to Spain
the "Auieola of
Honor."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID (via Biarritz, France),
June 20. â El Imparcial publishes an in
terview its correspondent has had with
Don Carlos. As it is understood that
the Pretender revised the interview be
fore it was published, â¢ his statements
may be regarded as in the nature of a
manifesto. Don Carlos said:
'"I won't conceal from you that when
I left Venice, last April, I was resolved
to protest by means of force and arms
â that is, by ordering my partisans to
rise against the people who were pros
tituting our country by a series of un
imaginable humiliations â but when I
turned that way war against the
United States was imminent and might
be declared any moment, and I changed
my resolutions and firmly decided tv
observe the most absolute impassivity.
Unswerved from this deci.siun, I do not
now desire to create the least difficulty
for my country, since it is most import
ant that all her children should sacri
fice themselves for her. My enforced
inaction puts me ti/ despair, but I carry
it to the extreme of depriving myself
even of expressing my opinion as to
current events.
"The governing statesmen, who have
committed the crime of not preparing
the nation for a war every one saw to
be unavoidable for the last two years,
will never be able to- accuse me of hav
ing withdrawn a single Spanish will
from the national forces in the fight
with the United States. They brought
on the war by yielding continually to
American demands and they will have
to take the responsibilities of their mis
takes. This attitude of mine will last
as long as the present condition of af
fairs endures, but when the hour for
the great settlement arrives I shall
make up for my present silence. I will
then take my vengeance, not by means
of words alone, but by means of acts,
and I will do that as soon as my con
science as a Spaniard permits me to do
it. I am firmly resolved to fulfill my
duty to the end and to omit no sacrifice
in order to redeem and avenge Spain."
Don Carlos, questioned as to the
policy he would adopt in case he should
mount the throne, said he could not en
ter upon that subject now beyond ad
mitting the necessity of a large in
crease in the navy, but he declared he
had thought out and completed plans
regarding the military problem and the
question of Spain's foreign policy.
'"They are my favorite subjects of
meditation," he observed, "and 1 have
certain mature ideas of my own re
garding them. I have even carried
some preliminaries respecting alliances
which I hope will some day yield ex
cellent fruits. This, In my judgment, is
the capital point because the proud
isolation of Great Britain has been and
is deadly to Spain. I must pass the
same judgment on the policy of going
about begging for protection and Inter
vention.
"The result of such a policy can only
be to reduce to the condition of Greece
or Servla the Spanish nation, which
was once the mistress of the world."
Don Carlos spoke eloquently of the
necessity for prosecuting the war to
the utmost.
"Our people's wonderful nerve, spirit
of resolution and exalted sentiment of
honor are," he said, "the only thing
that Spain can bring to a nation with
which she may strike an alliance in the
day of the coming European conflagra
tion. She must, therefore, preserve
jealously that force and spirit. The only
disasters possible for us now are moral
disasters, for we have no further ma
terial ones to suffer, having suffered all.
"Jherefore, if, for example, Admiral
Cervera, surrounded by forces ten times
superior to his own and having been
granted a chance to capitulate on con
ditions comparatively honorable, should
prefer to make a sally and iose all his
vessels, sinking at the same time as
many American warships as he couki,
he would do not only an heroic deed,
but also a useful work by preserving to
Spain the aureola of which no enemy
has yet been able to deprive her."
NEVADA'S VOLUNTEERS.
Sagebrush State to Send an Infantry-
Battalion to the Front.
CARSON, June 20.â Instructions have
been received from Washington by
Governor Sadler to call upon the State
of Nevada for one battalion of infan
try, consisting of four companies com
posed of about 100 men each. C. A.
Bennett of San Diego, Cal., has been
directed to make arrangements for the
comfort, shelter and subsistence of the
organization and the order in which
they shall be mobilized for muster.
Colonel Lord of the State militia con
ferred with the Governor and the latter
agreed to call upon the State militia.
The order will be issued to-morrow.
Under each call Nevada furnished twice
the quota, having in the first instance
sent two troops of cavalry instead of
one. c

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, June 20.â "This is all
of the farce I want. lam going home."
Savagely snapping out 'these words of
disappointment. Dr. H. J. Crumpton,
City Father and champion of the pool
room triumvirateâ Glynn, Broyer and
Humphreyâ arose from his seat at the
meeting of the board of Town Trustees
this evening and stalked from the room
to a mingled accompaniment of cheers
and hisses. Sausalito is still a wide
open town, but only to Harrison and
Harvey. Their rivals received a blow
straight from the shoulder to-night,
four Trustees voting to reject the peti
tion of the San Mateo men against Dr.
Crumpton's single vote in their favor.
When the board met the Town Hall
was crowded and bets were made
that Glynn, Broyer and Humphrey
would get their license. Attorney Hep
burn Wilkins wan on hand to look out
for his clients' interests, and first took
a u ,n,, n , y ar S uln Â£ th &t their petition
should take precedence in consideration
a point finally yielded by Trustee Sylva
He then made a forcible plea in their
behalf, asserting that they had waited
patiently the action of the board
though proceedings had been often de
layed, and that they were all good
business men and would be found in
line for the financial benefit of the com
munity. He failed to see any reason
why they should not receive the same
consideration as others.
Sylva wished to know if the petition
ers would locate their poolrooms where
the board desired, and was answered in
the affirmative, with an additional
statement that they preferred to re
main where they were, as they had gone
to Kreat expense in putting up their
buildings. Sylva then moved that a li
cense be granted, with the proviso that
the establishment be located in the
northern part of the town. After a con
sultation with Glynn, Attorney Wil
kins objected, saying that this amount
ed to a prohibition, as no business could
be done there.
Sylva then withdrew his motion, and
amid intense excitement General Dick
inson called for a vote on the original
question. Ambjornsen, Dickinson
Thomas and Sylva voted in the nega
tive, Crumptnn alone in the affirmative.
Ihe result cv ked a storm of hooting
and cheering mingled, and Crumpton's
request to be excused from further par
ticipation was denied.
Zeke Abrams* application then suffer
ed a like fate. At this Crumpton's an
ger gained complete control, and he
made his melodramatic exit. The crowd
soon followed.
Attorney Wilkins said he understood
there was to he a reconsideration of the
vote, and Bylva evidently in pure mer
riment gave notice of a reconsideration
at the next meeting. It is understood
the would-be rival trio will reopen to
morrow and test the law In court. At
torney Wilkins was non-committal as
to the mode of procedure to be follow
ed. Another interesting feature of the
present agitation is that Trustee Amb
jornsen will probably resign from the
board. When questioned in regard to
his proposed action all he would say
"Well, I have had about all I
care to stand."

LESS. OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA,
June 19 (via Kingston. Jamaica, June
20).â Rear Admiral Sampson author
izes the publication of the following in
formation obtained from reconnois
sances and from the Cubans:
Matters are quiet at Guantanamo
Bay. The Spanish are transporting ar
tillery to the town of Guantanamo.
Yesterday a shell from the battle-ship
Oregon destroyed a railway car and
set a warehouse on fire.
A spy asserts that the Spanish gun
boats have been filled with straw and
will be destroyed if there is any dan
ger of their being captured.
The Spanish forces at Guantanamo
are vainly attempting to reach Santi

situation at Guantanamo, as the Cu

General Garcia's forces are within
three days' march of Santiago. They
number 5000. The same number of Cu

SAVED FROM BEING

Correspondent Halstead Owes His
Life to the British Consul at
San Juan.
NEW YORK, June 20.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The alleged wounding of Freeman Hal
stead, a correspondent of the Herald,
during the bombardment of San Juan
turns out to be not as the Spanish re
port gave it. From a source not to be
doubted I learned to-day that the Span
iards let the canard go out as to the
wounding of Halstead in order to check
the ardor of the American fleet and the
story comes from one who was witness
to the bombardment.
When the Spaniards lost all hope of
saving the town in desperation the
political prisoners were ordered out to
be shot, Halstead among them. At a
moment when their chances seemed
well nigh hopeless the British Consul,
hearing of Halstead's peril, intervened.
But before this, when the men were
being taken from the prison, Halstead
stoutly resisted and during the struggle
his arm was sli^fctlv Injured.
Immediately the Spaniards set upon
the ruse which thus far has been ac
cepted, but which is now for the first
time exposed. Halstead was in fact
sentenced only to imprisonment by the
court martial before which he appear
ed, but when the bombardment by the
American fleet be~an to be destructive,
a spirit of MHer eagerness for unrea
sonable retaliation swept away the
court martial records, and Halstead
found himself about to be the victim
of quick resentment that ignored his
sentence for imprisonment in desire for
revenge. It was thus that he came to
face with a dancer against which, with
the knowledge of his sentence, he re
belled. And it seems that this resis
tance resulted in an injury which tend
ed toward his deliverance.

SEATTLE" June 20.â Major General
H. C. Merriam, commanding the de

here more particularly on business re
lating to the Government's recent re
lief expedition to Alaska, and spent
most of his time with Captain W. W.

Merriam denied emphatically, on the
authority of the officers of the regi

tion among the Washington Volunteers
by reason of their not having been or
dered to a foreign shore. The order to
hold our men here, he said, came from
Washington City without any sugges- j
tion from the coast. He further said
he had asked for a regiment of Eastern i
soldiers to guard the Pacific Coast. If '

PROFIT IN SHAMS.
A Commercial Practice That Works Great
Wronfe to the Public.
Honesty is, in the long run, the best
policy, but there are circumstances in
which, for a time, deception seems to be
profitable. It is profitable to the retail
merchant who can make more money i
on a cheap article of obscure and hasty
manufacture than upon wares put out
by respectable and responsible houses.
This greedy practice of Bt -stitution is
not merely an injury to the maker of
reputable goods, but it is a grave public
wrong.
For instance, Duffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey is widely famed for its medici
nal properties. It (a constantly used in
households all over the Union and in
the practice of physicians. People ask
for it, because they know that the word
Duffy's insures the Quality of the whis
key. It would not be possible t" make
this admirable stimulant at the prices
demanded by the legion of imitations.
The public suffers, when under any
specious pret \; ;tt all, it accepts a
substitute. Who vouches for the quality
of the counterfeit? Whose reputation
is at stake?
It is possible f> put down substitu
tion by refusing to buy anything at all
from a dealer who is grutlty of it.
Insist on having Duffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey.

MANILA, June 17 (via Hongkong
June 19). â The situation here is un
changed. The insurgents are unable to
take Manila, owing to their lack of field
pans. They could not take it even If
Admiral Dewey permitted, which he
will not.
The report that the United States
transports from San Francisco had
been sighted is not correct. They are
expected on June 20. All the foreigners
are leaving in neutral ships.

United States Consul Wildman has re

ment with regard to the future of the
Philippines. General Aguinaldo- desires
that the islands become an American
colony. He declares that if he cannot
be connected with the United States he
will insist upon a republic being
formed. If any other country than the
United States wishes to secure control
of the Philippines that country will
have to fight for it. The insurgents
under Aguinaldo now have 10,500 rifles
and eight field pieces.
The Hongkong correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph says: According to
the report of the United States trans
port Zafiro, which has just arrived here
from Manila, an attempt was made
last week to poison General Aguinaldo.
He was taken suddenly and violently
ill after partaking of a meal, and the
symptoms were such as clearly indi
cated that poison had been mixed with
his food. He was ill for two days.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Standard says: All the papers say the
Government is satisfied with the pros
pect of Captain General Augusti being
able to act in concert with the com
manders of the European war vessels
for a joint occupation of Manila. As
th>- city cannot hold out until the ar
rival of the American troops this would
forestall the entrance into the town of
the Tagal rebels, which Spain supposes
the European powers would not be 41a
;..,sed to permit.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Times says: The idea that Germany
will interfere to prevent the storming
of Manila is now abandoned, but spec
ulation is active as to her political de
signs. El Epoca suggests that Ger
many may negotiate with the Philip
pine republic and lease a portion of the
province of Cayap.'in, including the
port of Aparri, in the island of Luzon.
Il forgets, however, that this would re
quire the sanction of the United States
as the suzerain. In the opinion of tol
erably well informed people the idea
nting a semi-independent Philip
nine republic is an absurdity.
Spaniards easily, but it is very hard to
drive them out."
Then General Garcia asked Admiral
Sampson, who sat beside him. what
had happened to the other Spanish
ships, the Pelayo and the rest, and
id his eyes wide with a muttered
exclamation of surprise when he heard
that Admiral Camara was si ill at home.
At Holguin, General Garcia said,
there are 10,000 Spanish troops, but he
. a the 3000 men he left there will
tually prevent the army from
reaching Santiago from the Holguin
side.
Captain Chadwick met General Gar
cia in General Rabi's ramp, eighteen
miles west of TCI Morro. Habi has about
1000 men. General Garcia was accom
panied only by his staff, consisting of
Colonel Collaze, chief of staff; Colonel
Valiante and Captain Portuando, and
also by General Lord,' Colonel Malanes,
Lieutenant Colonel Hernandez, Major
Buono and their aids. Most of them
Buffered from sickness. General Garcia
humorously said: "As bad as are the
roads In Cuba, your roads, Captain
Chadwick, are worse."
Genera] Garcia and his staff were put
ashore late in the day after the prelim
inary details of co-operation between
the Cuban and American troops had
been fully discussed.
PROBABLY THE WORK
OF SPANISH SPIES
Finishing Department of a Powder i
Company Destroyed in a Pecu
liar Manner.
CINCINNATI, June 20.â The finish
ing department of the King Powder
Company, located at Kings Mills, in
Warren County, was destroyed last
pight in a manner leading to the belief i
; that it was the work of enemies of the j
\ Government. The building, in which |
< was stored a quantity of smokeless
powder, had evidently been fired near I
j midnight by tw*o men, one of whom j
was badly burned and had apparently j
| been dragged away from the burning '
structure by his companion, who then
; fled in the direction of South Lebanon.
Smokeless powder, in the condition it
was in in this department, does not ex
plode like ordinary powder, with a
' Bash, but breaks into a bright light and
burns for some time. The great light j
attracted citizens, and some of these
! met a stranger going toward South I
Lebanon. The injured man was taken
| into custody. He, is apparently a for
eigner, but is so badly injured that he
! can scarcely talk. The powder burned I
was not for the Government and the
] money loss is inconsiderable, perhaps
$2000. This company has a contract to
supply the Government, and that is
thought to be the reason the destruc
tion of the plant was attempted.

! a cordon has been drawn around San
tiago de Cuba, General Garcia, with
4000 troops, coming by forced marches
from Banes, is now heading for Santi
ago. His troops are within forty miles
!of the city. He left 3000 men at Hol
1 puln, to prevent the Spaniards there
effecting a juncture with General Toral
lat Santiago. The Spanish troops at
i Guantanamo, under General Masso, are
j cut off from General Toral and are
; badly pinched for food. They wildly
â¢ appealed for provisions and re-enforce
\ rr.ev.ts, but the only reply they got was
, that both were Impossible. Generul
Masso said his men were even then en
I half rations, and the supply was suf
ficient to last only during the present
i month.
General Garcia and his personal staff
I were picked up at General Rabi's
I camp, eighteen miles west of Santiago,
1 and brought to th^ flagship this after

â¢ and wounded patriot had a long con

of the American and Cuban troops.
General Garcia is very enthusiastic.
! He says the Spaniards are starving and
cannoi hold out long and that the war
Bhould end in a few months.
Two regiments of troops will be
: landed at Guantanamo Bay, which will
j be held as a base until Santiago falls.
There have been no signs of Spanish
, troops in the neighborhood of Camp
Mil "alia for several days. It is esti
mated that over 806 Spaniards have
been killed or wounded since the land
ing. Fifty-eight bodies were found
yesterday. The Spaniards seem satis
fied that they dislodge the
Americans and have withdrawn. The
upper bay is to be occupied immediate
ly. Lieutenant Delehanty with an ex
pedition is nightly at work removing
mines from the river connecting the
upper and lower bays. When this is
clear the ships will move up the chan

ESCAPE FROM HAVANA
WITH HOARDED WEALTH.
Officials Among the Refugees Flee
ing From the Doomed Cuban
Capital.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 20.â
Many of the passengers of the French
liner Lafayette, which arrived here
yesterday from Vera Cruz, are Havana
officials who escaped from the doomed
city with hoarded wealth, regardless
either of the desperate state of the
Government or the starving people.
The principal passenger is Major Ana
dito Jover, who is a fellow countryman
and friend of General Weyler. He be
longs to the commissariat corps of the
Spanish army and brings with him an
enormous quantity of gold, said to be
a half million dollars. Major Jover is
married to a sister of Dr. Castillo, a
well known leader in the New York
Junta, and has always evinced a
friendly feeling toward the Cubans.
BRYAN ASSIGNED TO
LEE'S ARMY CORPS.
So the Noted Confeaerate's Name Is
Coupled with the Nebraskan's
in Politics.
NEW YORK, June 20.â A Washing
ton special to the eHarld says: Colonel
William J. Bryan's regiment, now sta
tioned in Nebraska, has been assigned
to the Ninth Army Corps under com
mand at Jacksonville of Major Gen
eral Fitzhugh Lee. They will both
wait for some time before they will go
into active service, as it has been prac
tically decided that General Lee will
not go either to Porto Rico or Santia
go, but will move with the main Cuban
expedition to Havana.
Although General Lee In a political
sense is not technically on record as
regards the financial policy his friends
seem perfectly well satistied that his
gold proclivities have been as constant
as his loyalty to Mr. Cleveland. Mr.
Bryan may be successful In drawing
the former Confederate general out
during the lulls in camp life this sum
mer, in which case the glory that is to
come to each later in battle may be
consolidated in a Presidential ticket to
suit all parties if past political predic
tions have any results.

DEWEY HAS
SOLDIERS TO
BACK HIM
The Charleston and Trans
ports Are Probably at
Manila.
Officials Anxiously Awaiting News
of Events Following Their
Arrival.
WASHINGTON, June 20.
Public attention here to-day was
divided almost evenly between
three subjects â the movement of
General Shatter's army, the prob
ability of re-enforcements having
reached Dewey and the status of
Hobson, the naval hero.
It is believed that just about
the time Shafter appeared off
Santiago the Charleston ap
peared in Manila Bay, leading the
three transports which take near
ly 3000 men to Dewey's assist
ance. That fact will not be
known, however, officially for
two or three clays, owing to the
distance from Manila' to Hong
kong, the nearest cable point.
It is questioned here whether, with
this force to back him, Dewey will feel
Justified in assaulting Manila or even In
accepting Its surrender. Either course
would involve heavy responsibility for
the admiral ana it is extremely de
sirable that no pretext be afforded jeal
ous European powers for intervention
at Manila under the guise of protecting
the interests of their subjects. There
fore, it may be that the admiral will
wait another ten days, until the second
installment of troops reaches Cavlte.
In this case he probably will land the
troops that arrive in the town of Ca
vite, which is now completely under the
control of himself and the insurgents
and employ the time in accustoming
them to Manila methods and climate.
During the day dispatches announc
ing that Captain General Blanco had
I refused to exchange Hobson and his
j fellow prisoners created some indtgna
i tion, which was modified later by Mad
rid advices quoting Sagasta as saying
no decision had been reached. Should
Spain adopt the cruel and unusual
I course of refusing an exchange the
regulations of the War Department are
sufficient to meet the case. The fol
lowing principle Is laid down in its
regulations:
"Retaliation will never be resorted to
j as a measure of mere revenge, but only
as a measure of protective retribution,
and moreover, cautiously and unavoid
ably that is to say, retaliation shall
be resorted to only after careful inquiry
Into the real occurrence and the charc
ter of the deeds that may demand retri
bution. Unjust or inconsiderate retalia
tion removes the belligerents further
-md further from the mitigating rules
of regular war and by rapid strides
leads^them to the Internecine wars of
" There was a wholesale christening at
' the Navy Department to-day, when
'â¢ Secretary Long supplied names for no
1 iess than thirty-five war craft. All of
j these were provided for In the last na-
I val appropriation bill and while con
i tracts for their construction have not
yet been let the advertisements have
been issued, except in the case of mon
itors, and all the boats will be under
way before cold weather.
First in the list of big battle-ships
is the Maine, for Congress has provid
ed that that name shall be continued
in the naval list. The other big bat
tle-ships will be called the Missouri and
the Ohio.
The first of the torpedo-boats bears
the name of the brave young ensign
Bagley, who was killed on the deck of
the Winslow, under the guns of Carde
nas, the first American naval officer to
lose his life In the war.
Four States have the privilege of
giving their names to monitorsâAr
kansas, Connecticut, Florida and "Wy
oming. The names given to the six
teen torpedo-boat destroyers are those
of America's famous naval heroes â

flttorrill of Vermont and Bacon of
Georgia Make Speeches in Op-
V position to Taking
Hawaii.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 20.â Discussion
by the Senate of the question of Ha
waiian annexation was begun to-day in
open session. At the very opening of
the question the opponents of annexa
tion quite unexpectedly scored a point
!by preventing a yea and nay vote on
the taking up of the resolution. When
Davis, chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations, called up the reso
lution the Vice-President, as usual, an
nounced that without objection the
resolutions would be considered. No
Objection being entered he declared the
resolutions to be before the Senate. A
minute or two later Frye of Maine de
manded the yeas and nays upon the
request to take up the resolutions.
"White of California instantly made the
point of order that a yea and nay vote
could not be had on a dead issueâ that
the resolutions were already before the
Senate by unanimous consent. Of
course the point was sustained. The
opponents of annexation were decidedly
pleased at preventing a show of
strength, but at 4:30 this afternoon
White afforded the friends of annexa
tion the opportunity they had been
awaiting. He moved to adjourn, and,
like a flash, Davis demanded the yeas
and nays. The motion, the vote upon
*which was a test of strength between
the friends and opponents of annexa
tion, was defc ted decisively, 44 to 15.
Having gained his point in developing
the numerical weakness of the oppo
sition Davis readily agreed to enter a
motion for an executive session.
The proceedings of the day indicate
clearly that there is to be no debate
â¢upon the Hawaiian question in the or
dinary acceptance of that term. It is
riot the purpose of the friends of an
nexation to consume time in making
speeches. Believing that the Senate
has already in executive session
thoroughly discussed the question, they
Will permit the opponents of the pro- i
ject to occupy all of the time. This
plan of campaign is not satisfactory to
the latter and during the executive !
session to-day considerable bitterness;
was manifested at times.
The speakers to-day were Morrill, the
Venerable Senator from Vermont and
one of the Republican opponents of an
nexation, and Racon (D.) of Georgia.
Morrill of Vermont took the floor to
address the Senate in opposition to the
resolutions. The venerable Senator spoke
in a conversational tnne, but was ac
corded close attention by the Senate.
Morril] said he was "unable to concur
â¢with the learned committee on Foreign
Relations in regard to such annexation,
whether by treaty, by joint resolution, by
flagrant executive usurpation or in any
manner which leaves an open door for the
admission of the islands into the Union
as a State â¢
"The undesirable character," he con
tinued, "of the greater part of their ill
gathered races of population, gathered
â¢ntract to serve long years of semi
slavery by sugar employers, does not
warrant and never can entitle them to
an equal representation in the Senate of
thp United States with Virginia or Mas
sachusetts, or with Illinois and Colorado, ;
or any other State. My firm conviction i
is that annexation of distant Islands is
not in harmony with the constitution of
the United States, but is conspicuously |
repugnant thereto; nor is it in harmony
â¢with the history or even with any of the i
recorded opinions of our earliest and rip- ;
est statesmen. The Hawaiian Islands, v
annexed, would prove as barren of mili
tary importance as of commercial, which
Is wholly based on our unfortunate grant i
of a free market for their sugar and
their annexation would be a source
of weakness and no more desir
able for the defense of the Pacific
Coast than the back side of the moon.
The formal annexation of Hawaii, under
a one-man power, under a republic In
name, or whatever form of Government
we may choose or be compelled to pre-
Bcrlbe, will advertise the final wreckage. Â»
of the Monroe doctrine, so long held dear *
by the American people. We cannot af
ford to renounce and forbid all acquisi
tions of territory in the Western hemi
sphere by European governments, even at I
the peril of war, and forthwith embark
In a thus bedamned enterprise ourselves.
If our fidelity to the well-tried states
manship of the father of our country
shall be perpetuated for the next hun
dred years as In the past, the honor,
prosperity and power of our republic, it ;
may safely be predicted, will light and j
lead all the nations."
At the conclusion of Morrill's speech,
Bacon of Georgia entered upon a discus
sion of the constitutional objections to an
nexation as he viewed them. He main
tained that a measure which provides foi i
the annexation of territory is necessarily '
and essentially the subject matter of a
treaty.
At this point Jones of Arkansas made
the point of no Quorum, and the rou was
called, disclosing the presence of sixty-one
Senators.
"I made the point of no quorum," ex
plained Jones, "not because I desire to
delay consideration of the pending reso
lutions. I insist that if the rigid methods
are to be resorted to with which we were
threatened tlais morning, a quorum shall
In in the Benate to listen to th<? ar
guments present* <. ! do not want to de
lay the proceedings, but I do insist that
Senators shall remain here, and I shall
deem it my duty to make the point of n-.
quorum when a quorum is not present."
This statement brought Wilson of
Washington to his foet.
"If," said he, with some heat, "we on
this side of the chamber are to be con
tinually embarrassed by points of order,
I hope the chairman of the Foreign Re
lations Committee will exercise his right
under the rules to move that the Benate
proceed to the consideration of this mat
ter in continuous session. If the gaunt
let is to be thrown down by the opposi
tion in the first hour of the debate, wÂ«
ought to take it up."
White, Jones, Frye and Hoar then had
a mutual explanation of the statement
made at the opening of the debate by
Frye.
]â¢ rye disclaimed any idea of making n
threat, and then repeated what he said

earlier In the day. He had made his
statement, he said, because he did not
desire the bankruptcy measure should be
allowed to interfere with the Hawaiian
discussion.
Resuming, Bacon contended that the
joint resolution now before the Senate
p.s a direct blow at a prerogative of the
Senate in that UM proper method of an
nexation oi foreign iÂ«M'ritory was by
means of treaty. He urged the import
ance of maintaining the constitutional
method in bo important an undertaking.
In thie connection, he deprecated the sug
festion that the President could seize the
f-iwaiinn Islands without the concur
rence of the Senate. The President would
have no more right thus to roizc Hawaii
than he would nave to seize Jamaica.
Still, such a seizure would be as legal as
would annexation by joint resolution.
Platt of Connecticut interrupted to In
quire whether, if the Hawaiian Govern
ment made a cession of territory to this
country without a treaty, that Congress
could accept it.
Bacon, in reply, maintained that such
! acceptance would require the assent of
I the treaty-making power?.
Foraker inquired of Bacon whether It
would not be competent for Congress to
prescribe by law certain terms and con
ditions on which any independent govern
ment could become a part of the United
States, and whether (tho terms being
complied with) Congress might not de
clare the territory annexed.
"I answer the Senator, yes," replied
Bacon, "if you absolutely nullify the con
stitution of the United States."
In concluding his speech, Bacon said
that if the Seriate passed the pending res
olution. Congress would enter upon a rev
olution which would raise the flag of the
United States over a country whose peo
plo were entirely and essentially different
from our own people; a revolution, too,
! in which tho Senate, because the majority
has the power, would surrender its treaty
making powers.
Teller said that while he had no desire
to discuss the question at length, he
wanted to call attention to the false as
â  sumption of Bacon that there was some
constitutional barrier to annexation by
act of Congress. He was not afraid, ho
said, thai the common-sense and patriot
ism of the American people would lead
the Government to acquire undesirable
territory. It was a reflection upon tho
people to intimate that they could not
trust themselves.
"I don't know." said Teller, "what the
present war will bring us. I confess I
would not have been unkindly disposed
toward a postponement of this discussion
until wo could ascertain what the issue i
of the war is to he and what other ques
tions may be presented to us. But, Mr.
President, you cannot make the American
people believe, that the Government of the
United States is not capable of exercising
the power of control in the Philippines or :
in any other part of tho world, or that !
we cannot give to that people a govern
meat infinitely better than they have had i
there for 200 years. You cannot make the |
Amoacan people believe that freedom j
and "liberty will he a means of harm to j
the people who are asked to take their
share in it.
"I don't know what the war will bring
to us. but I do believe that wherever our !
flag flies by right of conquest, or by the
consent of the people, there it will remain, j
And the party or the men who propose to j
take it down will have to reckon with the j
A-â¢ ri< an people."
White innuired of Davis If he intended
to proceed further with the debate to-day.
Davis expressed the wish that the dis- !
cushion continue until half-past 5 o'clock.
White instantly moved to adjourn.
I>n\is asked for the ayes and nncs. Tho
motion was defeated. 44 to 15. Those vot
ing for adjournment were: Bacon. Bate, :
Berry, Butler, Cbjjton, Clay, Cockrell, |
Jones of Arkansas, Mallory. Pasco. Petti- j
grew, Roach, Turley, Turner and white.
White expressed the opinion that for ihe i
first day of the debate the Senate had i
done pretty well. He expected to proceed
with the debate to-morrow, but would not
proceed to-day. He suggested, therefore,
that Divis move an executive Besslon.
Pending the disposition of the motion. I
which Davis made at once, some routine
business was transacted.
The Senate at 5:96 p. m. went into exec
utive session and at 5:45 adjourned.
DELEGATION OF WOMEN'S
CLUBS AT DENVER
Soon the Contest for the Presidency
of the National Organization
Will Beg-in.
DENVER. June 20. â The American
Club woman has simply besieged the city.
Every incoming train has brought larsrr
delegations fr"m the four corners of the
country, until to-night the number of vis
itors is at least 1000. These sp< .
trains made the trip without mishap and
each party reports a delightful time en
route. One of the largest delegations
came in this afternoon from Chicago with
300 club women in charge of Mrs. Clara
M. J. Farson. This crowd was in charge
of a prospective bridegroomâ lT. C. I \ -
ling of the Burlington lineâ and in appre
< kninn r.f his courtesies made up a purse
which will be presented at the wedding
next week in Chicago, the bride being
Miss Laura Shoenberger of the same
city.
The delegations from the East arrived
at noon. Miss Helen Winslow headed this
New England party, the New York delo
gation was in charge of Mrs. Tod Hel
muth and the Washington women were
in charge of Mrs. Mary Smith Lockwood
The Western delegations are beginning
to come in, and by to-morrow night it is
estimated that the number of delegates
will be doubled.
The visitors were met at the station
by the reception committee and were es
corted to places of entertainment. ThÂ»
main headquarters, the Brown Palace
Hotel and the Metropole. are throngtci
with enthusiastic women, from whose
up-to-date clothes flutter the badge of
their particular State.
No sooner had the club women settled
in their quarters than the bees in their
bonnets began to buzz. The wire-pulling
centers in the presidency and, notwith
standing Mrs. Alice Ives Breed of Bos
ton is the logical candidate and has a
strong following, there is much favorable
talk for Mrs. Sarah S. Platt of Denver.
The Pennsylvania crowd has started an
embryo boom for Mrs. Edwnrd Long-
Btreet of Philadelphia, and still another
:â¢â¢ believe there will be a dark horse.
<>n<i of the important issues has also
been sprung on the side, and that is the
increase of duty and to meet the expenses
of the federation. It is evident there will
be animated opposition to the innovation,
one large club from a Middle State hav
ing been Instructed to withdraw from the
federation in case this is done.
The city likely to get the next conven
tion is a question coming to the front.
Invitations have already come from New-
York and Boston and many leaders be-
Ueve it will go to the latter.

to Los Angeles.
REFUSES THE CITY'S OFFER
SAYS ARBITRATION MUST BE
RESORTED TO.

Alternative Would Be Bar

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 20.â"Respect
fully declined with thanks." This in
brief is the reply of the Los Angeles
City Water Company, made to-day to
i the city's offer to purchase the corpoi'a
i tion's improvements to the city's plant
for $l,300,0i)0. When the Council con
vened this morning this reply was ex-
I pected and It came in the shape of a
communication from the water com
pany, which was as lengthy as usual
and was signed by its attorneys.
The communication In brief set forth
in rather ironical terms that the figures
submitted by the company to the city
| were more than twice what the city of
fered the company. The company main
tained that its property could easily be
shown to be worth hundreds of thous
ands of dollars more than had been
: estimated by the City Engineer. It de
i clared it was so confident of the value
of its plant that it was willing to leave
: the question to an impartial board of
! arbitration. Then the conditions and
i objections to this course were pointed
out as follows:
First, the question of the constitu
tionality of the bond issue for the
' municipal purchase of utilities. This
i question might have to be settled by
| the courts.
Second, the question whether the old
| ordinance providing for municipal bond
, issues had not been unwittingly re
| yoked by mistake in a number of the
â  statutes.
Third, the question as to how the city
could be bound to observe the de
! cision of the arbitrators. The latter
; might determine the price that should
| be paid and the contract of the water
i company with the city would hold the
j municipality to such a figure, but the
I voters might refuse even then to ap
prove the bond issue to cover the
amount determined by the board of ar
bitration.
The company then suggested that
bonds should be voted prior to the de
termination of the arbitrators in suffi
cient sura to cover the price that might
be named by the board.
As soon as the communication had
been read the Council referred it to the
I Water Supply Committee and provided
j for a session to-morrow morning at 10
i o'clock. At noon an executive session
[ was held and the Council decided under
I no circumstances to call any election
for nn issue of bonds prior to the time
when the arbitrators shall have fixed
the price the city is to pay for the
plant. On the other hand, an informal
discussion was entered into as to who
should be named as arbitrator by the |
I city. This was certainly a waste of |
time, but despite the fact that the pros
pects for securing anything other than
iiur.combe arbitration are absent there
are a half dozen persons striving to be
named as city arbitrator. The session !
of the Council to-morrow may produce
some developments.
Mayor Snyder has returned to the
city, but he refuses to disclose the ob
ject of his hurried visit to some un
known point and his mysterious de
parture from the city further than to
say it had some bearing on the water
question.
It is the consensus of public opinion
that the tirre has arrived to dis
cuss the question of municipal owner- j
ship without holding out further elusive
expectations and promises to the people j
of this city. It was The Call that be
gan a discussion of this character some
months ago when there was yet time
for the people to meet the issue and do i
something or have something done for !
them by their servants in the City j
Council and in the City Attorney's of- j
flee. Five months have been permitted i
to pass by the Council, the City Attor- j
ney and the Mayor and now at the j
eleventh hour there is a great rush â a !
false pretense that something is going |
to be done. It is true something will |
be done, but that something will |
amount to absolutely nothing as far as
practical results in the interest of the
people are concerned.
Five years ago the city could have
purchased the water company's im
provements for $2,006,000, but no nego
tiations were opened.
Litigation, having for its object the
clearing of the way to obtain full mu
nicipal ownership and operation, has
been pending in the shape of several
suits for four or five years and in no
Bingli suit or legal proceeding has the
city gained an advantage. There are
several cases pending on appeal; one
case has not been decided and one case
in the Federal court has been decided
against the city â that decision holding ;
that the Council had no right to fix j
rates.
The water company now stands firm
ly entrenched behind its contract with
the city, which the courts have decided
to be legal and binding on both parties.
The company is proceeding on that
contract and is endeavoring to tho best
of its ability to put the city into default
upon the agreement.
In proceeding under the contract the
city finds itself badly handicapped.
Neither the company nor the Council
can agree upon a price, a trifle like
$1,700,000 being the difference as to the
valuation of the company's Improve
ments.
Mayor Snyder says that on the ex
piration of the contract, July 22 next,
if the city has not already taken pos
session of the plant, he proposes to
take a detachment of police and in the
name of the city take possession by
force. This would be all right and
would truly be a coup de etat if the
water company were to sit idly by and
permit it to be done. But it probably
will not. It will probably procure pro
tection for whatever rights it may have
in the courts. The impression is that
it will protect itself. It has always j
done so in the past, and there is no j
reason to believe it will not pursue the
same policy in the future.
The water company would probably
go into court and claim it had stood by
nnd was ready to carry out every pro
vision of its contract whereby the city
was to acquire its plant at the expira- |
tion of the lease, and that the city had
failed to carry out Its part of the agree
ment. This being the case, it would
ask to be protected against forcible dis
possession.
This is the status of the water situa
tion in Los Angeles to-day. There may
arise some great and mighty mind who
can unravel the tangled threads within
the next thirty days, but that man has
not yet appeared.

j ach down, the referee separated the
j men and gave the match to Lewis be
cause Yousouf, as the referee said, was
I strangling him. There was much howl
; ing and yelling from the disappointed
] crowd. George Considine, the backer
< of Lewis, announced that he did not
think the hold was a strangle. Brady
and all of Yousouf's men, Lewis and his
seconds and Promoter Considine alter
nated in trying to get a hearing. Lewis
agreed to take the winner's end of the
purse, $2250, and continue the match
with C. O. DuplessiÃ as referee, but
Referee Hogan refused to allow it and
was finally escorted from the ring by
the police. During all that time there
was the wildest excitement.
The men met on the mat again for
the exhibition at 10: w and within four
minutes Yousouf secured the same hold
that brought forth the first decision.
Duplessis tapped him on the back, but
he quit reluctantly. This fall was
awarded to Lewis on the foul.
At the end of the fifteen minutes'
interval, provided for in the articles,
the match was resumed. Yousouf se
cured a strangle hold and Lewis gave
up in C l^ minutes.
After another fifteen minutes the bout
was continued. When Lewis had
broken several locks and wriggled out
from a spin on his head the Turk again
obtained a Strangle hold and Lewis
gave up in seven minutes and ten sec
onds, Yousouf winning the match,
clearly surpassing the "strangler" at
his own game. Lewis said after the
bout: "I was licked. The Turk is a
better man."

the last two were walk-overs, the scores
being oâ7, 4â .'), 4â2.

no opportunity to practice since he ar
rived in this country. But, though he
was beaten, he pave his adversary. Q.
M. Simons, a hard and brilliant fight,
particularly in the last set. The umpire
criticized his running service and called
frequent faults on him for delivering
the ball with his foot over the line. The
score stood: 7âo. 6â3. Câ 3, 12â10.
Grant is a most promising youngster,
but was out of it in hia match, his
scores being oâl,0 â 1, Câ l, 6âl.

William Says the Army Is His Most
Important Inheritance.
BERLIN, June 20.â The official Relch
zansieger to-day says that Emperor Wil
liam, in a speech which he delivered to
the Imperial Guards at the Lustgarten,
Potsdam, on Thursday, spoke of the army
as being 1 hia most important inheritance,
and said: "When 1 ascended the throne
with n weighty load of anxiety, every
where was I regarded askarice and every
where I encountered false judgment. The
army alone believed in me, and supported
by you and trusting in the God of our
forefathers, I assumed my heavy office
knowing well that the army was the chiei
support of my country and the chief pil
lar of my throne."
Ills Majesty concluded with hoping "the
loyalty of the army will become ever
more pronounced and that it!? main sup
ports, namely, bravery, honor and un
conditional, unswerving blind obedience,
may ever remain unshaken."

I have a friend, in fact he is my brother-in-law, who is the outside
man for a New York crockery warehouse, a sort of salesman, purchas-
ing agent, collector and what riot. He used to suffer from a catarrh
of the stomach. When he woke in the morning there would be a
gripping, a contraction, a tightness of the stomach, which, he said,
seemed to be clogged with a slimy, phlegm-like substance. Carlsbad
salts always did him some good, but now he uses a Ripans Tabule. He
only takes one when occasion requires, just one now and then. When
this man, his name is Spalding, was asked to describe the effect of the
Tabule on him, he said : "Why, it brightens me up. It has an effect
like dry air; makes me feel something's I used to of a spring morning
when the air was crisp but tempered with sunshine. I don't know
Jiow they produce such an effect, but that is the way they work wifcti m***

THIRD FLEET OF SHIPS.
Merritt Expects to Sail on
Saturday, but His De=
parture May Be
Delayed.
Four Cases of Diphtheria Sent to the
Marine Hospital From the
Minnesota Camp.
Major General Merritt. V. P. A.. Gov
ernor General of the Philippines, has
fully decided to sail for Manila with
the third fleet of the expeditionary
forces, and with that end in view he Is
having matters connected with the ex
pedition closed up as rapidly as possi
ble. The members of his immediate
staff and all other officers; assigned to
duty on this flotilla are getting every
thing in readiness for embarkation.
The date of sailing has not yet been
definitely fixed. It is not likely that
the transports will get away before
Saturday of this week, and the sailing
may be deferred until early next week.
General Merritt has not yet selected
his flagship, but it is thought that it
will be the Indiana.
Should the sailing of the fleet be post
poned General Merritt may sail on the
cruiser Philadelphia. which, according to
an army officer holding a high position,
can be fully â  the voyage
by that date. Tiie general Is in com
munication with the War Department
regarding the Philadelphia, but has re
ceived no definite reply as to the cruiser
convoying the ti^-t <>r' transports.
The steamship Valencia, the latest
addition to the fleet, will go to the dry
dock to-morrow morning and come out
on Thursday, and under the supervi
sion of Major Long, the depot quarter
master, will be mavJe ready in time to
sail with the other four vessels of the
squadron.
The Signal Corps under Major R. E.
Thompson, which will sail with General
Merritt, will consist of five officers and
:." men. A r^-ruiting officer, however,
will remain in San Francisco to enroll
enough expert telegraph operators to
fill the corps to its maximum and to
forward them to Manila, together with
;i large quantity <>f supplies, including
a cab'c now being made in the East, to
connect Corregidor Island with the
mainland.
All tho officers of General Merritt's
:r.!ip: be vaccinated before they
sail for Manila, and an army surgeon
at the depot quartermaster's building
on New Montgomery street is now per
forming that operation as fast as the
officers make their appearance.

It is settled, as published exclusively
in The Call yesterday, that Park Hen-

Â«.f the National Guard up to a high
standard of merit during the years that
he had command <>f that organization.
It has been suggested that the next
regiment to be mustered into the Unit

numbered tho Eighth in compliment to
the excellent regimental organization
that lost its number by Vfjison of the
readjustment "f the National Guard.
It is accept* d aa a fact in military

The best Information obtainable is

to the effect that Major A. K. "vVhitton
of the Fifth Regiment of the National
Guard will be commissioned as one of
the two majors allowed to the new regi
ment. Major Whitton lives in San Jose
and has been identified with the Fifth
Regiment for many years.
John A. Koster, formerly a lieutenant
colonel In the National Guard, accepted
a commision of a lower grade in order
to get into active service. There is
talk that he will command one of the
battalions of the new regiment. Only
two majors are to be chosen, but the
applicants are many. Colonel Koster
has an excellent record so far as Na
tional Guard service is concerned. He
is well up in military tactics, and fully
capable of commanding a battalion.
Captain George B. Baldwin, another
National Guard officer of distinction,
may be commissioned in the new regi
ment. He possesses qualifications for
service as regimental adjutant or quar
termaster.
The selection of regimental surgeon
has been made. The appointment of
Dr. George F. Shiels is semi-offlcially
announced. Dr. Walter S. Van Dyke
is likely to be one of the assistant sur
geons, and Dr. F. W. Dudley another.
These three surgeons were ordered be
fore an examining board last evening.
Should the report of the board be fa
vorable the appointments will be made
without delay.

GOING WITH A RUSH.
Active Operations in Getting the
Third Fleet Ready for
the Troops.
The work of getting the transports
ready for the voyage to Manila went
with a rush yesterday. It is not settled
whether or not the Newport will go out
with the third fleet, as it may be impos
sible to get her ready in time. Judging
from the manner in which the Ohio, In
diana, Morgan Pity and City if Para are
being put in readiness they should get
away next Saturday. Stores from the
commissary department of the army be
gan to arrive at the various wharves
yesterday, and the work of coaling all
the vessels will be finished to-day. Last
â¦reek it was thought the transports
would be ready to sail on Thursday, but
it can now be plainly seen that every
body will have to put their foot foremost
in order to get the vessels away by Sat
urda;..
On the Ohio, at Lombard-street wharf,
and the Indiana, at Pacific-street wharf,
the work of coaling is still going on. In
the forward part of each vessel 350 of
Turner's patent bunks are to be put in,
and then there will be accommodations
for over a thousand soldiers on each
ship. On the .vlorgan City 700 of the
same kind of bunks have been put in,
and a steam kitchen has been built on
deck. The boy? will find the Morgan
City a very comfortable vessel. On the
City of Para a hundred men were put
to work yesterday, and Captain Howard
says the carpentering work will go
through with a rush. The owners of
the vessels say it will not be their fault
if there is any delay, and the Govern
ment la already rushing- the supplies into
the ships, so that no blame can lie at Its
door.
The next fleet to get away will be com
p<ps<-<i entirely of pressed vessels. The
Newport was taken last SaVurday, the
i'it\ of Puebla two weeks ago and the
Aiameda, Acapulco and Valencia will
make up the expedition. The Peru, which
will be due here on the 24th inst., will
probably ;ilsn lÂ«> pressed Into service and

that the owners of these vessels compel
Uncle Pam to take them. All of these

THE ORDERS TO EMBARK.
Troops Designated for Each
Transport of the Third Fleet.
Seventh California Paid.
As far as can now bo ascertained, pro
vided the vessels are ready and no fu
ture orders are issued changing the date
of departure, the third expedition for
Manila will leave Camp Merritt Thurs
day. That is the troops will break camp
on Thursday and go aboard the trans
ports, but it is hardly probable that the
vessels will sail before the beginning of
next week.
The following orders were issued yes
terday morning from Third Brigade
headquarters reassigning some of the
troops to different transports from those
on which it had been intended to ship
them, as a result of the Seventh Cali

which showed that about 350 soldiers are
on their way to this city. They left Mo
jave at noon yesterday and should arrive
about noon to-day.
On Wednesday 330 volunteers and 3 offi
cers will leave Los Angeles to join the
Seventh California Volunteers.
ARRIVAL OF RECRUITS.
The Thirteenth Minnesota Re
ceives a Big Re-Enforce
ment.
A troop of 330 recruits for the Thir
teenth Minnesota filed into that regi
ment's camp, wheeled and halted in a
well-dressed line before the crowd of vis
itors and soldiers that had gathered to
receive them, yesterday afternoon.
They were by far the best dressed and
best drilk-d squad of "ruklos" that have
yet marched into camp. The good peo
ple of Minneapolis and St. Paul had pro
vided them with blue overalls, and Col
onel Reeve had the forethought to ship
thorn from his commissary stores hats,
shirts, blouses and legginsrs.
Colonel Reeve, his officers and the
regimental band met the boys at the
ferry and accompanied them into camp.
DIPHTHERIA IN CAMP.
Four Cases Sent From the Mm
nesota Regiment to the
Marine Hospital.
Diphtheria has finally made Its ap
pearance at Camp Merritt. Four ea-=es
bearing all the earmarks of that dread
disease were discovered yesterday in
Company M of the Thirteenth Minnesota.
They were immediately removed to the
Marine Hospital and every precaution will
In' t.-iken to prevent the spread of the
malady.
The number of cases of sickness In
camp is rapidly decreasing. The measles
epidemic is practically under control, but
of the number of cases remaining many
are of a decidedly serious character. Ce
rebro spinal meningitis lias made Its ap
pearance and has Bpread so alarmingly
that Major Owen baa seen fit to report
the matter to Major General Otis for gen-
eral circulation among the surgeons of
the camp.
There are now thirty-five patients from
the camp being cared for at the French
Hospital, the greater number of them
suffering from meningitis and pneumonia.
Five that were brought in yesterday are
of a serious nature. John Manjean of the
Eighteenth, Peter Thompson of the Pirat
South Dakota, and F. McHill of the Sev
enth California are all suffering from
pneumonia with their chances for recov
ery at the minimum. Harvey Pepper of
the Twentieth Kansas is a victim of
acute consumption and no hope for his
recovery is held out.
PREPARING TO EMBARK.
The Batteries of the Third Ar-
tillery Getting Ready for
Manila.
Batteries G and I- of the Third United
States Artillery, which are to sail with
the third Manila expedition, are doing
some hard work in Infantry practice, es
pecially in skirmish movements and the
formation of line of battle. In fact, Dig
whole Manila battery under command of
Major Hess is engaged in this work. The
daily drills are witnessed by a large
number of visitors.
Batteries G and L have been rellevod
from duly at Camp Miller, In urd-^r to
enable them to prepare for embarkation,
which will be on Thursday.
Yesterday Captain Raymond, surgeon,
assisted by the hospital corps of the Ma
nila battalion, vac ciliated 140 men of
Battery L, and to-day they will vaccin
ate Battery G.
The health of Camp Miller is excellent,
there being not a man in the hospital
with any serious complaint. The rest
of the Third Artillery at Camp Miller
will go to Manila with the fourth expe
dition.
A HOSPITAL SHIP.
Measures to Care lor the Sick
and Wounded of the Army
of Invasion.
The field hospital force, consisting of
700 men, will go to Manila as an inde
pendent expedition.
If it does not get off with the next expe
dition it will follow not far behind. No
official orders to this effect have yet been
Issued, but the tip has been quietly given
out from headquarters to the officers of
the corps, and preparations are making
all along the lines of this plan.
Chief Surgeon Lippencott has issued or
ders to Major Owens, commander of the
field hospital forces, to immediately make
requisition for supplies for 700 men* and to
push enlistment as rapidly as possible.
The field hospital force will have a boat to
Itself, especially fitted out for the use to
which It is to be put. On board will go
the 700 men that will comprise the corps,
235 tents, stores for six months* use in a
t>oo-bed hospital, and all other equipment
necessary to the care of the sick and
wounded of the big army of invasion.
It is confidently expected by the officers
of the corps that their boat will sail
within ten days.
UP TO THE MAXIMUM.
Last of the Recruits for the

Captain Carrington has finished the
work of recruiting the First California
Volunteers up to the maximum. Late
yesterday afternoon he mustered in the

last batch of recruits and to-day the 300
men will be marched out to Camp Merrltt
and turned over to Colonel Berry of the
Seventh, who will take them to Manila
with his regiment.
Captain Carrington had no difficulty In
filling up the regiment; there were scores
of applicants for enlistment at the Page
street armory yesterday, hopeful that
somebody would back down at the last
moment and give them an opportunity to
join the regiment.
A large quantity of quartermaster stores
were sent to the armory and as fast as
the men wore sworn into the service they
were uniformed find equipped throughout,
from underclothing to shoes and blan
kets. After they go into camp they will
be thoroughly drilled by officers of the
Seventh detailed for the purpose, so that
by the time they reach Manila '.bey will
ue fitted for the hard duty txrfore them.
Maty of the recruits are former national
guardsmen, consequently they will have
little trouble in rounding Int3 shape.
The recruits from the south for the
Seventh are expected to arrive to-morrow
or Thursday. They will be taken to thÂ«
Page-street armory and kept there until
they are mustered into the service. This
will take not more than two days, so that
by Saturday Colonel Berry will have ICOO
men under his command.
A Reception to the Soldiers.
The officers and enlisted men of the
various regiments will be tendered a re
ception at the Young Men's Christian
Association bui!ding. Mason and Ellis
streets, to-morrow evening. The entire
building will be thrown open hi honor of
the boys in blue. The Seventh Kegiment
Hand, California Volunteers, will furnish
music, and there will be selections by the
Noble sisters, trombone and cornet solo
ists: readings by Dr. Thomas L. Hill,
whistling solos by Miss Cordie Wetjen,
quartets' by the Knickerbocker Quartet,
and short addresses. In connection with
this gathering there will be an informal
farewell reception tendered Messrs. C. A.
Qluns and P. A. Jackson, who are to go
out as representatives of the Christian
Commission on the next expedition to the
Philippines.
Nat Messep Appointed.
The President yesterday appointed Nat
T. Messer of San Francisco captain and
commissary of subsistence of volunteers.
Captain Messer has not yet received his
assignment to duty, but as he is a capa
ble officer he will probably be selected for
service with the Philippine expedition
ary forces.
Messer's appointment was secured
through the Influence of Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin and John WÂ« Mackuy.

A DISCOURTEOUS LIEUTENANT.
The Commander of the Astor Battery Forgot
lie Was a Gentleman and Snubbed
the Ladies of the Red Cross
Society.
The much-talked-of Astor Light Battery arrived yesterday, and from the
commander of New York's swellest military organization the ladies of the
Red Cross Society received their first snub, a snub so direct and given with
such studied discourtesy as to stamp the offender as totally lacking every
qualification of a gentleman.
There was an unusually large crowd at the ferry depot yesterday morninff
to welcome the scions of the first families of Knickerbockerdom and extend to
them California hospitality. The splendid band of the Fifty-first lowa was on
hand, and the Red Cross Society had made the usual elaborate preparations
for breakfasting the members of the battery and the 300 recruits for the lowa
regiment that were also to arrive.
The recruits landed shortly before 7 o'clock and received a well-merited ova
tion, of which they did not hesitate to show their appreciation. They were a
stalwart lot of young men, true Americans every one, with that inborn ven
eration for womanhood that stamps the Western freeman untrammeled by
caste and fashion.
While they were breakfasting In the Red Cross dining room the Regi
mental Band played several choice selections, which were loudly applauded.
The Towans received the usual decorations of flowers with thanks, and then
giving three ear-splitting cheers for their entertainers, they started out to
join their regiment Just as the Astor battery, 102 strong, with six Hotchktss
guns, marched off the ferry boat.
The lowans were lost sight of in the rush to see the New Yorkers, who
were escorted up the depot by the band which had remained behind to show
them that courtesy. The guns and caissons were run on one of the piers with
the baggage, and J. B. Stetson on behalf of the ladles approached Captain
P. C. March, the battery's commander, and invited himself and the members
of the battery In to breakfast.
The answer was prompt and sharp to the last degree.
"My men have had breakfast."
Not an acknowledgment of the courtesy, or even an amiable tone or gest
ure accompanied the refusal.
"But you hardly seem to understand." explained Mr. Stetson. "The ladies
of the Red Cross Society have fed 14,000 troops, regulars and volunteers, and
this is the first time their efforts to aid the soldiers have been ignored."
"I can't help that." was the reply. "Such things may be all well enough
for a lot of volunteers, but this battery belongs to the regular service and I
want my men to become accustomed to the hardships of campaigning."
Some of the ladies came up at that juncture, and they, too. begged that the
men might be allowed to go in to breakfast, but the officer was as insolent to
them as he had been to Mr. Stetson.
Finally they asked that the men be allowed to march into the dining room
and receive some flowers, but Captain March at first refused to even grant
them that privilege. Finally, however, he did unbend enough to march hla
men into the room, and the ladies offered each a hunch of flowers and an or
ange, which were gratefully accepted. The men eyed the steaming dishes of
stew, piles of tempting sandwiches, boiled eggs, cakes and coffee with long
ing eyes.
They were hungry and they did not hesitate to say so, but in the presence
of the man fate has placed in command of them they dare not eat. They told
the ladies that they had been served with a cup of coffee and a piece of hard
tack at 5 o'clock, but that was all and they could get nothing more until after
they reached Camp Morritt. The men, who felt keenly the boorishness of their
superior, did all they could Xn relieve the embarrassment. They sang several
songs for the ladies and cheered them for the viands provided for them but
which they were not allowed to touch.
Captain March put an abrupt end to the affair by ordering his men to "Fall
in," marching them out of the room without even lifting his cap to tha
ladies.
As for the members of the Red Cross, they were dumfounded. and natur
ally intensely indignant. They had entertained thousands of regular and vol
unteer soldiers, every one of whom had expressed heartfelt gratitude for their
humane efforts, and now an obscure lieutenant of artillery, lifted into momen
tary conspicuousness by the favor of a millionaire, not only slighted but actu-
ally insulted them.
Captain, or Lieutenant, March's assertion to Mr. Stetson, which he also
made the night before to a Call representative in Oakland, that his battery
belongs to the regular service, is difficult to understand. To be sure, it Is offi
cered by regulars, but so are many other voluntary organizations; its mem
bers enlisted for two years, or during the continuance of the war, the same as
other volunteers; it was equipped by a private individual instead of the Gov
ernment, and It is not attached to any regiment In the regular establishment.
Clearly Captain March is at fault In his nssertions, and it is feared by some
that his unexpected elevation has unbalanced him.
While on the road here Captain March telegraphed to headquarters ask
ing that his battery be stationed at the Presidio instead of Camp Merritt
with the other volunteers, but the general, unmindful of the aristocratic cap
tain's feelings, took no notice of the request, and March was compelled to
pitch his camp in the sand lot formerly occupied by the Nebraskans. When
he left the ferry March announced that he was going to the Presidio, but
the strapping cavalryman detailed to escort him to camp grinned and con
ducted him out to the Bay District tract.
The battery is finoly and thoroughly equipped, but last evening most of
the men were down town looking for the Palace Hotel, where they expected
to dine.
After the battery left the ferry the guard of a dozen men lift behind to
escort the baggage out to camp took advantage of the Red Cross Society's
invitation and enjoyed a hearty breakfast, for which they were most grateful.
They reiterated the statement that all they had was a cup of coffee and some
hardtack at 5 a. m.
The ladies of the Red Cross are seriously thinking of petitioning the "War
Department not to assign any more dude commands to the Philippine expedi
tion. But now that Captain March is h.->re it Is to be hoped he will be as
signed to the next expedition and given every opportunity to extinguish him
self on the field of battle.

A POPULIST MUST
SERVE HIS TIME.
CHAIRMAN SYLVESTER OF
SHASTA IS DOOMED.
United States Supreme Court Decides
That He Must Meditate and
Work for Ten Years.
A mandate was received yesterday from
the Supreme Court of the United States
confirming- the judgment of the lower
court in the matter of A. J. Sylvester.
Sylvester was a prominent politician of
Pitt Valley, Shasta County, and was
chairman of the Populist county conven
tion of that county, a position which he
filled with great dignity and satisfaction,
if not to his constituents at leasi him
self. He did not approve of the financial
system of the Government, and bitterly
denounced all monopolies, including that
of manufacturing the coin of the realm.
He came to grief, however, by turning
out a large quantity of counterfeit half
dollars, which the unfeeling and sordid
public, including even the Populists, re
fused to aeeefli at par. The tyrannical
Government, which at that time, accord
ing to Patriot Sylvester's teachings, was
under the control of millionaires, syndi
cates, trusts and bond holders more or
less bloated, seized Patriot Sylvester and
cast him into prison.
He was convicted in the. United States
District Court and sentenced to ten years'
imprisonment in the penitentiary, and to
pay a tine of $1000. Sylvester has been in
Jail since June. 1896, and under the de
cision of the Supreme Court he must
serve the full term.

GETTINGS REPENTANT.
The Shoe Clerk Promises to Support
His Family and the Case Is
Dismissed.
Two days' sojourn in the City Prison
had a softr-ning effect upon George H.
Gettings, the shoe clerk who was con
victed Saturday by Judge Mogan of fall
ing to provide for his two young children.
When he appeared in court yesterday for
sentence he faithfully promised the Judge
to return to his wife and family and sup
port them, and the Judge, for the chil
dren's sake, dismissed the case.
Rose Finch, the woman whom Gettlngs
lived with, failed to appear yesterday to
answer to the charge of vagrancy, and
a bench warrant was issued for her ar
rest. Judge Conlan, who gra.nted the
order to Attorney Martin Quinlan for her
release Saturday is indignant at the way
in which he was hoodwinked In issuing
the order. He has ascertained that the
woman was visited Sunday night by Get
tlngs' two sisters and a man. who pre
vailed upon her to leave the city by tell
ing her that she would be arrested for
a much more serious crime. The Judge
is determined to sift the matter to the
bottom and punish those who caused the
woman's disappearance. Her attorneys
promise to have her in court this morning
as they do not believe she has left th*
city.
Christian Workers for Manila.
A branch of the Christian Commission
has been established in this city on the
lines of the organization which did church
work in the Union armies during the civil
war. The intention is to unite all
churches in this work, which is to be un
der the direction of the Young Men's
Christian Association. F. A. Jackson ot
the San Francisco association and C A
Glunz of the Oakland branch will leave
on the next Manila expedition as repre
sentatives of the California department of
the commission.
Stole Cash and Clothing.
J. Williams, a carpenter, 19 years old.
was arrested last night on Bush street
by Officer J. F. Deinan and Detective
Reynolds and locked up in the California
street station on a charge of petty lar
ceny. When arrested Williams had in
his possession a grip containing $39 in
cash and a quantity of clothing, the prop
erty of J. Van Alstyne of 51" Bush street.
Williams had paid Van Alstyne a visit
early in the evening and when he left
took the grip with him.
Claims He Was Swindled.
A. J. Ritter, a recent arrival from Ari
zona, swore to a complaint in Judge Low's
court yesterday charging E. Runge with
obtaining money by false pretenses. Rit
ter alleges that he purchased the fixtures
in a saloon at Twelfth and Howard streets
from Runge for $300. and and on going
to take possession found that the fixtures
belonged to the brewery syndicate.

A "POPULAR" SUGGESTION.
IT has been suggested that it would be a gooc idea
for the Democratic party to dispense with all State,
municipal and county conventions this year. The
idea is put forward in the interest of harmony and
economy, especially the latter, and in support of it
the allegation is lodged that a great deal of money
might be saved the party for use in the campaign
by authorizing the Democratic State Committee to
make all nominations, State, county and municipal.
That body having appointed a committee to conduct
the campaign in San Francisco, it is said, there is no
good reason why it should not appoint one for every
other county and city, or, what is the same thing,
personally make all nominations.
Surely the time is propitious for this, though at
first glance the suggestion may appear a trifle revo
lutionary. The Democratic party is now in the
hands of "Trustees" McNab, Gould and Alford, three
bosses whose political purity, like the personal purity
of Caesar's wife, is above suspicion. We violate no
confidence when we say that these bosses are un
selfish in their devotion to Democracy. They do
not want anything, cither for themselves or their
friends. McNab, especially, would not bow to an
office were he to meet it in the street, and as for
Gould and Alford, they would ignore the presence of
a red hot stove at any time, unless, indeed, they
should each have a pair of asbestos gloves. In our
judgment, there never was a time in the history of
the Democratic party when it could more safely en
trust everything to its bosses than now. McNab,
Alford and Gould should be allowed to name all the
ticket?.
In this city preparations have been completed for
carrying some such plan into effect. McNab has chosen
a County Committee, which will name a convention
and a State delegation. Why go to all this trouble?
McNab may as well name the delegates and ticket
first as last. If there is to be a Democratic State
Convention â which, under the circumstances, seems
to be entirely unnecessary â why not let McNab name
the delegation from this city. Gould the delegation
from San Joaquin, and Alford the delegation from
Trlare? If the other members of the State Com
mittee are equally trustworthy they might be per
mitted to appoint the delegations from the other
counties, and thus a truly representative and har
monious convention could be created. â¢ On the score
of economy this plan could hardly be excelled.
It may be urged that to nominate Democratic can
didates in this way would be unpopular, and for that
reason the plan will probably be antagonized; but
no argument that can be urged against it as a
State proposition is likely to apply to ft locally. Boss
McNab should be authorized to name the entire mu
nicipal ticket. If it should be necessary to do this
through the Committee of One Hundred all right,
but to our mind it would look better to dispense with
that body. In politics subterfuge and chicanery are
always dangerous. Why beat about the bush with
a committee when McNab and the Third Street
Boodler (late of Mission street) can do the work so
well, openly and above board? Conventions and
primaries are a useless expense. The modern method
is to dispense with them. Why should the Demo
cratic people be consulted? Surely the "whisper
ing" boss knows better what is good for them than
they know themselves.
By all means let us have a "good" Democratic
State and municipal ticket. Who can give us a. bet
ter one than Bosses McNab, Alford and Gould?
A reporter for an evening paper takes it upon
himself to say that the Centennial, thrice rejected by
the Government, is as good as some of the accepted
vessels. Marvel arises that a naval expert so capable
should have escaped the offer of a job from the Gov
ernment, which just now is in need of men of his
qualifications.
England has decided to omit the usual play
maneuvers of her navy this year, but if occasion arise
for maneuvers of a serious variety she is believed to
be in the humor to undertake them at short notice.
Blanco should be careful how he refuses to recog
nize a flag of truce. The time is not far away when
he will be in a pretty fix if the United States shall
be governed by a similarly barbaric notion.
Naval reserves have had their first experience under
fire. Of course they bore the ordeal well. If they
had not been made of good stuff they would not have
been naval reserves.
If the Kaiser ever declares that America shall not
take the Philippines while he is in power the state
ment may be taken as the announcement that he 13
tired of his job.
Captain Huke, of a British merchantman, declares
the Cuban blockade a joke. It is, however, not one
of the kind susceptiblo to the process of being
cracked.
AQUINOLDO AND THE PHILIPPINES'
IT is very probable that grave complications will
arise in the Philippines, due to Aguinaldo's proc
lamation of independence. If he defeat, the
Spanish garrison in Manila and add the city to his
recent conquests in the provinces, we will have to
treat with him as to the future of the Islands. He is
a mongrel with all the ambition and strut of the
Spaniard. If Manila surrender, to him and then
our forces appear in front of the city they cannot
land without his consent, nor is it likely that he will
turn his prize over to Dewey, or surrender his con
quest and jurisdiction to Governor General Merritt.
He has made deals with the Spaniards before to
his own advantage and is not made of that sort of
stuff which scruples and shies when self-interest is
to be served and power gained by the sword is to be
retained and exercised.
To his followers a change from Spanish to Amer
ican domination is simply a change of masters. They
are largely of Chinese and Malay blood and their
leaders are thoroughly informed of the attitude of
Americans toward those races. One of the things
that may be expected to happen is a Spanish sur
render to Aguinaldo and a combination of the de
feated Spanish force with his revolutionary army to
preserve the independence which he has been in such
haste to proclaim. When a masterful and unscrupu
lous character combines Asiatic and Spanish in
trigue its action in a crisis is hardly calculable and
is always surprising. From our standpoint we
would say that of course Aguinaldo's gratitude to
the United States will induce him to turn his ocn
quest over to us and resign his power to the Ameri
can Governor General. This view is based upon
implied patriotism and unselfishness, which are not
elements in his character nor among the motives of
his revolution. He has prospered as an insurgent.
He pocketed a Spanish bribe of $800,000 to betray
the cause he led and the men who rollowed him.
Having sold himself he did not stay bought. He
i 3 an insurgent for revenue only and the first in his
tory who has shown the ability to eat his cake and
keep it. If he takes Manila and makes a combina
tion with the Spanish garrison he is in position to
make a cash deal with Germany. The Philippines
will be his conquest, not ours, and under the laws
cf war it is rather difficult to find a valid objection
to such disposition of his conquest as pleases him.
Suppose he make a German deal, our position would
be exactly reversed. We are now saying to Ger
many "hands off." Then, resting upon Aguinaldo's
proclamation of independence and his title by con
quest, Germany would tell us "hands off."
Maitia! events in the West Indies are interesting,
but for a time the Philippines will hold the center
of the stage, for there is the point at which Euro
pean complications will begin, if at all.
Aguinaldo's proclamation has a purpose which will
shortly appear. If he were co-operating with the
United States such proclamation was not only un
necessary, but a breach of faith. Its utterance is
evidence that he feels himself operating as an inde
pendent commander, sure of his strength and certain
of his position. He cannot fail to know that his
action is an utter disarrangement of American plans.
Nothing, indeed, would be more at cross purpose
with us, and if his craft be joined to Spanish cun
ning, and this junction be abided by, a Spanish sur
render to him might be the best strategy yet shown
by Spain. It is true that such a move would not
leave us without cards. Aguinaldo may promise all
this to secure a Spanish surrender and then break
his word with as little compunction as when he sold
himself.
In fine, Aguinaldo is a mongrel scoundrel, but it
is very important that he should be our scoundrel.
THE NEW SECOND LIEUTENANTS.
THE new appointments of 195 young men as
second lieutenants in the regular army to fill
the vacancies caused by the recent changes in
the army organization seem to have been well made.
The policy pursued in their selection was at any rate
wisely adopted, and if all the new officers do not turn
out well, it will not be the fault of the system under
which they were chosen.
When it was known that this large number of
army appointments were to be made a strong pres
sure was brought by members of Congress upon the
President and the War Department to obtain offices
for their friends. There was danger that this pres
sure might result in filling the army with a set of
political appointees of no particular merit. That
danger has been avoided or overcome Doubtless
the recommendations of Congressmen had much to
do with the choice of particular persons, but under
the rules adopted in making the selection every as
pirant had to possess something of personal merit in
order to be successful.
A large number of the men chosen are graduates
of military colleges, or of colleges having military
instructors, and no less than sixty-seven of such in
stitutions arc represented in the list. These young
men hail from all sections of the Union and have
been trained and instructed under widely different
methods. Some of them were honor men in their
classes, and all of them arc types o^ men out of
whom efficient commanders may be made by experi
ence in army life.
The military colleges, however, have not furnished
the only field from which the Government has found
it advisable to draw its new officers. The useful
ness of the National Guard as a training school has
been recognized, and among the new appointees are
a considerable number of men who have served in
that organization. This is a well deserved tribute
to the guard and one which will have the effect of
increasing enlistments in it, and stimulating its mem
bers to fit themselves for possible promotions here
after.
By far the most gratifying feature of the appoint
ments, however, was the selection of a considerable
number of men for promotion from the ranks of the
regular army itself. Nothing puts spirit and energy
into an army like the hope of promotion from the
ranks. Nothing that Napoleon ever said in all his
eloquent addresses to his army had more effect in
rousing their courage and inspiring them to action
than his saying: "Every French soldier carries a
marshal's baton in his knapsack." The young re
cruit of the imperial armies, who knew that his com
manding officers had risen from the ranks and that
he himself had a similar career possible before him,
fought with an ardor unknown to tne men of the
opposing armies, and carried the eagles of France
victorious over all Western Europe, from the British
Channel to the plains of Central Russia.
The infusion of new blood into the army by these
appointments is said to be approvÂ«d by the West
Pointers themselves. The promise of good results
from them is therefore excellent. The young men
who are about to enter the service as lieutenants
have a bright prospect before them, and the nation
relies upon them to attest by their fidelity to duty
the wisdom of the Government in selecting them to
perform It
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 21, 1898.
PERSONAL VALOR IN WfiÃ.
WHEN gunpowder became extensively used in
war there grew up a theory that it would put
an end to chivalry by placing the compara
tively weak and cautious man on an equal footing
with the bravest and strongest. The theory was re
futed by every war that followed, but lately the vast
improvement made in the engines of battle has re
vived it. For many years it has been a widely ac
cepted belief that long range guns have destroyed
opportunities for the display of conspicuous gallan
try on the field of battle. It has been thought that
since opposing forces have to fight at such distances
from one another no individual can ever have a
chance to show himself possessed of any extraordi
nary personal heroism.
The theory has a certain foundation of fact upon
which to rest. In the days when battles were fought
out with swords it was possible for a brave Hora
tiua to hold a bridge against an army of ten thou
sand. The feat could not be performed in these
days. A single sharpshooter of no conspicuous
courage could remove Horatius as an obstacle with
one shot. Neither can a commander to-day, in
storming a city, distinguish himself like the lion
hearted Richard of England by taking a battle ax
and going up to the gate and battering it down. The
hero who would attempt such a feat now would be
hoist out of the fight by a petard dropped from the
hand of a powder monkey.
Such feats of heroic daring are gone forever, but
nevertheless war continues to demand valor and to
afford the valiant a thousand opportunities to dis
play their superiority to the common range of men.
Our war with Spain affords a striking illustration
of the fact. With all our excellence h. the way of
the mechanism of war, with all our big ships, big
guns and thunderous cannonading on both sides the
globe, the most conspicuous feature of the war so far
has been not the mighty potency of our arms, but the
personal valor displayed by so many of the men who
wield them.
Lieutenant Bagley, steaming his little torpedo
boat into a Spanish harbor and boldly fighting war
ships and land batteries, in order to find a channel
by which other and larger American ships could enter
the port, performed a deed of personal gallantry as
conspicuous as that of Arnold Winklereid rushing
upon ah Austrian phalanx in the middle ages and
gathering a dozen spears into his single breast to
"make way for liberty."
Equally eminent as a display of personal daring
were the feats performed by Naval Constructor Hob
son and Cadet Powell at Santiago. Nor do these
officers deserve all the credit The seven men who
followed Hobson will stand in fame along with him,
and every story of his deed will record their names
with his.
When the war broke out the Spaniards were be
lieved to be the equals of the Americans in personal
courage, and it was said they would t>e defeated be
cause in modern war valor does not count for so
much as superiority of arms, scientific attainments
and skill in the handling of the machinery of battle.
Up to this time the record of the contest has shown
the very opposite. We have triumphed over Spain
not so much by force of superiority of armament as
by sheer valor. If the conflict should end now the
deeds performed in it which would be longest re
membered would be the personal daring of a few
men who have made themselves conspicuous for gal
lantry and heroism.
THE AUSTROLJON CONSTITUTION.
ONE of the notable features of the constitution
proposed for the commonwealth of Australia is
the extent to which it brings the people into
direct relations with the Government. Not only are
Senators to be elected by popular vote instead of by
State Legislatures, as with us, but in several other
particulars that vote is to be appealed to in cases
where no provision for such an appeal is made by our
system.
There is to be an election of members of Parlia
ment at least once every three years, but in certain
cases the Governor-General, who represents the
crown, is authorized to dissolve Parliament before
the three years' term has expired. In this way the
Australian Ministry, whenever it finds itself opposed
by Parliament, can by a dissolution carry the issue
directly to the people. The plan is virtually that of
a referendum with the addition of calling upon the
people to decide not only the point of dispute, but
the election of members of Parliament at the same
time.
Another feature in which the Australian constitu
tion differs from ours is the provision that amend
ments are to be effected not by the States, but by the
direct vote of the people. Am proposed alteration of
the constitution must first be approved by a majority
of both houses of Parliament, and then at a date not
less than two months nor more than six months
thereafter must be submitted to the electors of the
various States. If it is approved by a majority of the
voters of a majority of the States and the total vote in
its favor is equal to a majority of all the voters of all
the States it becomes the law.
It will be seen the new form of constitutional gov
ernment differs from our own mainly in the direction
of giving the people a more direct control of all
branches of the government. Whether it will stand
the test of a century of development and trials so well
as our own may be questioned, but it is certainly the
most interesting experiment in the way of govern
ment making in recent years.
THE NEEDED GUN PLANT.
INHERE had for a long time been a theory that
the establishment of a gun assembling plant on
this c^ast would be wise, and by that common
consent, as well as by the judgment ot experts, the
site for it should be Benicia. That the place has every
advantage of accessibility and that the Government
already has there a considerable basis for future me
chanical development there can be no question.
It remained, however, for the war to demonstrate
how necessary a gun assembling plant would be to
this coast and to the country in time of war. The
demonstration has been complete, and with the as
sistance of representatives at Washington will doubt
less be effective. With such a plant here much of
the delay now unavoidable would never have been
experienced.
A gun assembling plant is more than its name im
plies. It provides not only for the storage of ord
nance, but of all the munitions of war. In case of
sudden emergency it is embarrassing to have to wait
for supplies stored on the Atlantic coast. There is
the usual red tape to be overcome, and in addition
to this many miles, which might easily be so impor
tant as to turn the tide of war. Rushing acioss the
country now are trains laden with supplies destined
for Manila. If these supplies had been kept at Be
nicia they could at this moment have been far on their
way to the relief of Dewey.
There has been no argument advanced against the
establishment of such a plant, and no valid argu
ment exists-

concealed religiously for some time, but
leaked out yesterday. It goes to explain
the success of Keppler's methods:
A band of eight Chinese came into his

the tickets and taking them from the

one of the eight spoke up and he said po

he ordered the sons of Asia to follow

THE HOME GUARD.
The battle drums are whirling past to-day
To the glad flutter of the Stripes and Stars,
But my proud s.-.-ul, sn eager for the fray,
Can only beat ugainst the fretting bars.
I cheer the colors and the serried lines,
The measured cadence and the clink of steel,
But deep within my aching- heart repines
And the hurrah but hides the woe I feel.
How curious doth fate thus shape our ends-
Some march awny with slow, reluctant tread;
While I, who chafe to Join my soldier friends,
Must still remain, an idlar here Instead.
You tell me that duty bid?â that I should yield
â \Vlth hf-art submissive to its plain decree.
Perhaps, but yet I long for tented field.
And, like the hooded fahon, would be free.
No ballroom strain can ever pound so sweet
As the wild fanfare leading to the war;
No stately dance could give, such joy complete
As the fierce grapple on a foreign shore.
What man Is passive when his country needs
The sturdy arm, the patriotic soulâ
Who would not foil aw where that banner leads
O'er land and sea- on to the final goal?
The battle drums ar? whirling past to-day,
The colors flutter in the summer air:

I mourn the glory that I cannot share. *

PLUCK OF PERKINS.
Frederick K. Perkins, a son of United
States Senator George C. Perkins, who
has been appointed an assistant paymas
ter In the- navy, is not unfamiliar with the
navy, as he was a cadet at the Naval
Academy from June 11, IS9O, to December
3, 1892. Then he was dismissed for dis
obedience of orders, which, serious as the
offense is from a military view, reflected
no discredit on the young man. It appears
that he was sent to Baltimore to an ocu
list to be treated for his eyes, and the spe
cialist had been notified of his coming,
but Perkins went to another and when he
returned to the Naval Academy refused
to explain when questioned. This consti
tuted sufficient grounds in the mind of the
superintendent. Captain Phythian. to dis
miss the youngster.
Before leaving the academy Perkins set
tled a score he had with J. J. Bryant,
a fourth class cadet, whom he charged
with having testified against him in a haz
ing case. Bryant was younger than Per
kins, but accepted the challenge to a fist
fight, which came off in an out-of-the-way
spot, witnessed by thirteen of their class
mates, and Bryant was taken to the hos
pital with a broken nose.
On the following day, when Perkins left
the academy for good, sixteen class
mates followed him to the gate, bade him
good-by and gave him a rousing cheer.
Captain Phythian looked upon this as an
insult to himself and as highly improper
and insubordinate conduct and the whole
lot was Bent on board the Santee, Isolated
from the remainder of the class; fifty de
merits were entered against each offend
ing cadet and they lost all privileges for a
couple of weeks, and the punishment on
the whole was equivalent to durance vile.
It was nine years since the Santee had
held so many prisoners, when under Su
perintendent Ramsay's Inefficient manage
ment the cadets of the second class broke
out in open rebellion on account of a gross
injustice done to one of their classmatea.
and twenty-six cadeta were sent aboard
the Santee.
Perkins left the Naval. Academy Decem
ber 4. 1592, and Bryant resigned June 13,
1894, just before examination, as he was
deficient in studies and overburdened with
demerits. Young PerklnÃ did not exhibit
any special proficiency as a student; hÂ©
etood number 81 in tha fourth class of 72
members, and dropped down to number 64
In the third class of 60 at the next examin
ation. He showed, however, qualities
which are in demand Just now, and the
fact that he is to serve in the pay corps
does not shut out the opportunities to dis
tinguish himself.
THE NAMES OF SHIPS.
Nearly all the papers in the United
States have commented upon the inappro
priate names selected for the vessels
added to the navy during the past couple
of years, and the Yale and Harvard, as
the New York and Paris have been re
christened, are specially criticized. But
meaningless as these names are when ap
plied to ships there are still others se
lected apparently with no other object
than to exhibit a close reading of Feni
more Cooper's tales of the noble red man
as the latter existed in imagination, and
the jaw-breaking Indian names of Penn
sylvania and "down East" are once more
resurrected. During IS6I-65, when nearly
800 vessels were either built or purchased
for the navy, some Indian lore sharps in
the Navy Department hunted up names
which no two persons could spell alike
and new ships were handicapped with
aboriginal nomenclature. Sea-faring men
of the present day differ greatly from the
sailors of thirty odd years ago in many
respects; they are now less capricious
about the names of their ships, but it is
safe to assert that such names as Yale,
Harvard, Wompatook, Uncanoomuck,
Hist, Accomac, Menemsha, Pompey, Bru
tus, Nero and Nezinscot are not likely to
meet with more favor than the names
selected during the last war.
Admiral Porter, while in the Navy De
partment during the few months Boric
signed papers as Secretary of the
Navy, was really the autocrat of the
navy, and the Indian names of the ships
were a source of annoyance to him. He
called attention to the fact that sailors
were always prone to call ships and other
things by different names to what they
were known to landsmen; that it was a
practice which should be discouraged as
much as possible, and he gave instances
where inappropriate names gave Jack all
the encouragement to nickname ships.
The Contoocook had been transformed
to Cant-hook; Isonomia to Insomnia.
Kickapoo, a decent Indian name, was
translated into Peek-a-boo. The Amo
noosuc, he feared, would be called "I'm
no-sucker," and the Miantonomah was al
ready known as "My-aunt-don't-know
me." The monitor Suncookwas irreverent
ly nicknamed "Son-of-a-sea-cook," and
the Wissahickon was known among
sailors as the "Widow Higgins." Sassacua
became "Saucy cuss" and Yazoo was
Yahoo.
"With the object of abridging Jack's
propensity to coining nicknames. Admiral
Porter issiied general order No. 124 on
May 15, 1869, over the signature of A. E.
Boric, changing the names of seventeen
vessels, among the most notable of which
were: Ammonoosuc to lowa, Ncshansing
to Arizona, Contoocook to Albany, Pono
panoosuc to Connecticut, Pushmataha to
Cambridge and Wampanoag to Florida.
This order was followed up by another,
one month later, changing the names of
forty-one vessels, notably: Kalamazoo to
Colossus, Passaconaway to Thunderer,
Quinsigamond to Hercules, Shackamaxon
to Hecla, and the objectionable Suncook
and Yazoo to Spitfire and Tartar.
Further re-christenings were cut short
by Mr. Borle'a resignation and Robeson's
advent to the office. Porter disappeared
with Boric, and Robeson on August 10,
1869, restored most of the original names
to the vessels. The Suncook and Yazoo
came back and all the noble Roman
names given by Porter had to give way
for simple but euphonious Indian names,
which they retained to the end of their
short and inglorious careers.
Of the thirty-eight vessels mentioned in
Robeson's order of August 10, I^;9, all but
eight disappeared during his incumbency,
but they went off thÂ« list and into the
scrap heap relieved from the incubus of
the names of Roman dignitaries and Greek
gods.
Roman history and Cooper's novels have
furnished names In the main for the pres
ent auxiliary navy, but that will not pre
vent disgruntled and irreverent seamen
from taking liberties with august names.
The Brutus, only a few weeks In the ser
vice, is already known as "the Brute,"
and Xero, Pompey and even the Harvard
and Yale are likely to receive mure ap
propriate although perhaps less elegant
names from the crews in the service.

SURVIVAL. OF THE FITTESTâ H. J.,
City. The expression "survival of the fit
test" originated with Herbert Spencer. In
one of his works, "Principles of Biology,"
he writes: "The survival of the fittest,
which I have here sought to express in
mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Dar
win has called natural selection, or the
preservation of favored races in the
struggle for life." Darwin in "The Origin
of Man" says: "The expression so often
used by Mr. Herbert Spencef of the sur
vival of the fittest is more accurate and
is Eometimes equally convenient."
THE CROSSâ S. G.. City. The follow
ing is from McClintock and Strong's
Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical
Cyclopedia:
A common tradition assigns the perpetual
shiver oÂ£ the aspen to the assertion that the
true cross was made of the wood. Llpsus
however (De Cruce 111-13). thinks It (the
cross) was of oak, which was strong enough
and common In Judea. Few will attach any
consequence to his other reason that the relic
appears to he oak. The legend to which he al
ludes, translated. Is:
The foot la cedar, cypress forms the shaft.
The arms are palm, the title olive bears.
CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONâ D.
C, Vallejo, Cal.â The secretary of the
Civil Servir* Commission says that in the
matter of applications for positions un
der the civil service act "no discrimina
tion is made on account of sex, color, or
political or religious opinions." A woman
may make application for examination for
any position which she is qualified to fill.
A. Government work which gives instruc
tions to applicants for positions says that

grade of more than 88 per cent navo any
prospect of appointment. The time for
examination in the various branches is
not the same. If you will name the
branch in which you desire to make ap
plication this department will advise you.
ENGINEER DEPARTMENTâ T. F.,
City. You do not state what branch of the
engineer department of the United States
army you desire information about and it
is not within the limit of space allotted
to this department to give the require
ments of each branch. Generally the du
ties of the engineer division are the mak
ing, repairing or destroying of communi
cations, including the word communica
tions, roads, bridges, railways and tele
graph, also the preparation of positions
of attack or defense, which is the higher
duty of military engineers and where the
art of fortification must be considered
entirely in a tactical point of view.
MIXER'S INCHâ A. H., California.
The figures in relation to a miner's inch
were correctly given in The Call's depart
ment of Answers to Correspondents. ThÂ«
miner's inch is the measure for water
which is defined as "the amount of water
which will pass through an opening one
inch square under a pressure of six
inches." This unit is peculiar to th<Â»
Western Stati s, used not only for mining
purposes, but whenever it is desired to
measure 'he amount of water distribi:'. I
for irrigation. The average discharge
from such an opening, called a module, is
one and a half â  per minute. Iti
thH various States from California to
Colorado there is some slight variation.
In California it is from 1.20 to 1.76 cubic
feet per minute, according to the arbi
trary definition adopted; for example, at
Smartsville an orifice four inches deep
and 250 inches long with a head seven
inches above the top edge is said to fur
nish 1000 miner's inches. In Montana a
vertical rectangle an inch deep is gener
ally used with a head of four inches and
the number of inches is said to be the
same as the number of inches in the
rectangle.
UNCLE SAMâ J. R. C. 8., City. "Uncle
Sam" is a term applied to the government
of the people of the United States. It is a
Jocular extension of the initials I". S. It
is used in the same sense that John Bull
I is applied to the government of the Brit
ish peonle. The name Uncle Sam origin
ated as follows: During the war of ISI2
a man named Samuel "Wilson was Govern
ment inspector at Troy of pork and beef
purchased by the Government. The cases
containing the provisions were shipped to
the Government by Elbert Anderson, a
contractor, who had each marked with his
initials, "E. A.." and underneath were the
initials "U. S., for United States. One of
the Government workmen new at the task
I asked the meaning of U. S., and was jocu
| larly informed that it meant "Uncle Sam,"
referring to Samuel Wilson, the inspector,
who was usually called "Uncle Sam."
| This pleasantry was repeated in several
forms, and Wilson was congratulated on
the extent of his property, as many cases
passing there were sij marked. The sti ry
spread, took firm root, and to-day the al
lusion is everywhere understood.
MB. BEECHER CLEARED IT UP.
Henry Ward Beecher was once ap
proached by a young man whom wealth
had made a fool and who also was very
conceited. He considered himself very
clever, and did not hesitate to assume
a patronizing air to men infinitely hla
superiors. It was in this sort of spirit
that this young fellow met Mr. Beecher,
who knew his family.
"Do you know, Mr. P.eecher," Fai<l he,
"I've been thinking that I would settle
down, behave myself and join your
church? Now, I like your preaching; but
when I go to your church and see such
men as old S and others, grasping
skinflints and hypocrites to the core, sit
ting there in full' membership, why, the
thing is just a little too much for me.
And, really," he added, "I cannot join."
"Well, you're right," said Mr. Beecher.
"Every church ha-s such men, and I fancy
Plymouth is not free from them. And
until you spoke I have always woi
why the good Lord permitted it. Xow I
understand."
"Ah," gurgled the young fellow, draw
ing himself up; "I'm glad I have thrown
light on the question. Wfcat strikes you
as the reason, Mr. Beecher?"
"Well," replied the great preacher,
looking the young- man straight in the
eye. "it is permitted in order to keep just
such fools as you out of the churches."â

SKYROCKETS WRECK A PYROTECHNIC FACTORY.
C. A. Smith Injured by an Explosion at the California Fireworks Company's Plant
at South San Francisco.
An explosion that was, fortunately, not fatally serious, occurred at the factory of the California Fireworks
Company In South San Francisco yesterday at noon. The accident took place in a shed in the yard where stars
for Roman candles were being prepared. There was only one manâ C. A. Smith â engaged in this branch of the
work, and as the explosion was confined to that part of the plant he was the only sufferer. Aa a result he was
severely burned about the throat and face and on his hands and arms. Notwithstanding the rapid spread of the
flre he succeeded in escaping from the flames and was carried to a cottage near by, where be was attended by Dr.
Alfred Mclaughlin. The physician states that Smith will doubtless be badly scarred, but believes that his eyesight
has not been Injured. The sufferer was removed to his home in Bay View later in the day.
The fact that there was an explosion is not to be wondered at, considering the crude methods employed by
tho company, particularly in this department. The stars are pressed into steel molds and, instead of using the
proper machinery for such work, the jn-essure is obtained from a rusty, old-style letter-prf>ss. The foreman, in
describing the accident, attributed it to "friction," which was probably caused by some of the material getting into
the exposed threads of the screw. He further stated that Smith would not have been so badly burned had he not
returned to the shed and endeavored to extinguish the fire. The latter says, however, that he got out of the place as
fast as his legs would carry him. and that he was in no condition to return.
The fijre burned the material In the shed and spread to the yard, where a large number of fuses were being
dried. These were destroyed.
It was the good fortune of the company and employes that the fire did not extend to the buildings in which the
unfinished explosives and manufactured goods are stored. The stock ready for shipment is stacked to the roof in the
magazine and the greater part of the yard is lilled with large set pyrotechnical figures, intended for the coming
Independence day celebration. Had these storehouses been involved in the explosion the results, not only to the
employes, but to the people who reside adjoining the factory, might have proved very disastrous.
The nre, which was quickly extinguished, caused a loss of about $200.

Alterations in the Main Telephone
Building Will Necessitate
Shouting.
Those who use the telephone during the
next three or four days should shout in
stentorian tones or they will find suit
able cause for the generation of angry
passions. Owing to alterations in the of
fice of the telephone building the main
operating room is much like a boiler shop
with the din of nolÃes buzzing in the ears
of the young lady operators. The tele
phone company recommends distinct ut
terance on the part of patrons.
Railroad Commissioners' Case.
Judge Bahrs will hear argument this
afternoon on a writ of prohibition, re
cently issued by Judge Belcher, prohibit
ing the Railroad Commissioners from fur
ther proceeding In the hearing of the case
against the Southern Pacific and other
corporations under the Robinson com
! plaint. It was thought that the case
would be argued yesterday, but the court
only passed upon one point relative to the
! jurisdiction of the Superior Court. He
found that the court had jurisdiction to
hear the case, and then, owing to a de
murrer filed by the Attorney General,
put the case over till this afternoon for
hearing:.
Mrs. Stenitt's Examination.
Mrs. Sterritt, for many years the com
panion of Gustav "Walter, was before
Judge Troutt yesterday at the instance of
Josephine Walter, executrix of the estate
of the late manager and proprietor of the
Orpheum. Mrs. Sterritt was examined
regarding the â¢whereabouts of jewels and
furniture valued at about $10,000 the exe
cutrix alleges belongs to the estate of
Gustav Walter. Mrs. Sterritt claims the
jewels and furniture by right of gift, and
another action to determine the title to
the valuable personal property will soon
be tried.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 21, 1898.
A CLEAN KNOCKOUT
AT THE EXCELSIORS
CHARLES TYE OF OAKLAND DE
FEATS LEAHY.
Jimmey Biley and Charles Read
Boxed Eight Good Rounds, Which
Ended in a Draw.
The Excelsior Athletic Club grave Its
first entertainment In its new hall, 1322
Howard street, last evening. The place
was crowded long before the first event
was called, and Manager Joe Kennedy
smiled happily as he glanced at the in
creased membership.
There wore several very tiresome pre
liminaries before the events of the even
ing were called. Such preliminaries should
be dispensed -with in future.
Jimmy Riley and Charles Reno, light
weight boxers, hammered each other for
eight rounds to the delight of the spec
tators. Riley had a shade the better of
the first round, but the- remaining
rounds all ended in favor of Reno. Still
Referee Stelzner declared the bout a.
draw. Riiey showed very poor Judgment
in swinging and missing. Time and again
he attempted to land a swing on Reno's
iseclc, but almost invariably he fell short
or the blow was easily ducked by Reno.
In the first round Riley staggered Reno
fcKainet tho ropes, but failing to follow up
an advantage he lost the only good op
portunity he had to win a quick fight.
The fourth round was the most exciting
of the series. Riley, angered at being
smashed with straight lefts on the nose,
d in on his opponent and some hot
give and take punishment was exchanged.
Reno manifested considerable cleverness
by ducking swings and in drawing Riley s
fire at long range. â ',Â«Â«.*
It was expected that some good fight
ing would result when Jack Leahy of the
Manhattan Club and Charles Tye of tho
Reliance Club of Oakland exchanged com
pliments. Leahy looked anything but a
lighter whf-n he entered the rlngf. His
ekin was as white as chalk and his gen
eral appearance was sickly. Tye, on thw
other hand, looked every inch a fighter,
and it seemed a foregone conclusion that
Leahy waÃ up against a good drubbing.
In the first round Leahy held his own
fairly well, but in the second he received
a straight flush in the mouth and a right
Jolt under the chin which knocked all
the fighting ambition out of him. He fell
on the paUded carpet and was counted
out.

queathed Relatives of the

to Josephine Sullivan, a former servant of
his deceased mother, $500; to Joseph
"White, $2o00; to Charles and Edward Gul
liver, $1000 each. The testator directs that
the residue of his estate be divided as fol
lows: To his widow, his daughter Martha
and his son, William C. Wood, one-fourth
eacb, and to his daughters Emily and
Minna, one-eighth each. The testator
stated that he had been twice wedded,
once in July, 1868, to Martha W. Bell, and
In January, 1898, to Abble Rose Smith, and
directs that In the event the court finds
that any other woman is his lawful widow
she shall be bequeathed $5, and a like sura
to each child not named in the will. The
last provision the testator states is for
the nole purpose of discouraging false
claimants.
Laborer Seriously injured.
C. J. Anderson, a laborer, was taken to
the Receiving Hospital last evening suf
fering from a fracture of the pelvis. An
derson was working on an embankment
on Polk Btreet, which was about fifty
feet in height. He had occasion to go to
thr> top and had almost f-nmplft^d thn a o.

Stabbed in the Back.
Joseph Gallagher, 1411 Polk street, was
treated at the Receiving Hospital yester
day afternoon for an incised wound in the
back. He said he was at the Lurline
Paths when he got into a dispute with
one of the attendants, and he challenged
him to go outside and fierht. The attend
ant, as Gallagher turned round, jabbed
him in the back with a penknife.

MINISTERS DISCUSS
RELIGIOUS TOPICS.
RESOLUTIONS OF THANKS FOR
DR. MINTON.
Interesting Papers Occupy the Atten
tion of Different Denomina
tional Representatives.
When Dr. H. C. Minton of the Presby
terian Theological Seminary at San An
eelmo concluded his essay on "Theories
of the Atonement" before the Methodist
ministers yesterday he was repaid for his
effort by the following resolution:
"We have heard the paper of Dr. H.
C. Minton with profound interest We
hereby tender to him our sincere thanks
In appreciation ami express our apprecia
tion for his presence and his presenta
tion of this able paper, and through him
we desire to convey to the Presbyterian
Union our fraternal regard."
The above resolution was passed unani
mously.
A nominating committee composed of
Rev. W. Vf. Case, Rev. F. V. Bovard
and Rev. J. H. McComber, was appointed
to choose officers to preside during the
next term and report at the next meet-
Ing.
At the Congregational ministers' meet-
Ing Dr. L. H. Kellogg read a paper on
"The New Mission of America Among
the Nations." He Indorsed annexation of
territory for humane and evangelical pur
poses. He held that the nation should
be a unit in the prosecution of matters
to legitimate and logical conclusion.
The ministers sustained the paper.
Colonel C. A. Hopkins of Boston, repre
sentative of the American Board of Mis
sions, was present, having just returned
from China. He said that the people
there are ripe for a change of govern
ment and for foreign intervention on ac
count of existing corruption.
Edwards Davis, Oakland's sensation,
appeared at the Christians' meeting
ready to go through any ceremony the
members might offer. His matter was
again referred back to the committee for
further consideration.
Dr. David James addressed the Presby
terian ministers on "Pastoral Work."
He said the care of the flock is the chief
interest of the church, together with the
gathering in of the sheep for whom the
Good Master died. Ho was in favor of
house-to-house visitations in pastoral
â work.
FOR BETTER HIGHWAYS.
Suggestions of the California Good
Roads League.
The California Good Roads League has
Just Issued a circular to the taxpaying
citizens of the various counties calling for
an increased interest in the establishment
of good roads. The circular sets forth
that sufficient money has been collected
in the past ten years to build good, per
manent roads, and on account of the in
efilciency of the officials who have chargu
of these matters good roads are rare In
this State. The committee makes the
following recommendations:
In addition to the duties of the County Sur
veyor already prescribed by this county govern
ment act relating to the County Surveyor, It
should be compulsory for this officer to locate
all roads built in his county; to inspect same
after they are completed and to reject all that
have not been constructed according to the
plans and specifications furnished by him, and
that no money shall be paid out of the county
treasury for road construction until a certifi
cate shall bo obtained from thÂ« County Sur
veyor showing that all specifications and plans
of the County Surveyor have been fully com
plied with.
That the County Purveyor should be required
to pass an examination before the State De
partment of Highways upon road construc
tion before he can take office. Falling to pass
such an examination the Governor may then
appoint a man who will be able to pass such
an examination.
That the sprinkling question should be very
carefully studied by each county, and means
provided to sprinkle roads. It is one of the
most Important factors In obtaining a good
roÃd and keeping down the repairs upon name.
That the wide tire law recently passed by
the Legislature is of such a le*al character
that It will undoubtedly be declared uncon
ptltutional. We therefore urpe thnt a new law
be prepared that will meet the rpqulrements.
Donegal Club's Picnic.
The regular meeting of the Donegal So
cial Club was held last evening at Its
headquarters In the Columbian building,
and after the transaction of routine busi
ness the following officers were elected
for the ensuing term: James C. Breslln.
president (re-elected) : Charles S. Qufg
ley, secretary: Frank Mulloy, treasurer
(re-elected, fourth term) : Bernard O'Brien,
vice-president.
Upon a vote it was unanimously decided
to give the eleventh annual picnic of the
club at Wlldwood Glen, Sausalito, on Sun
day, July 31, next. The committee of ar
rangements for the management of the
affair was chosen as follows: p. B. Gal
lagher, Jeremiah Toomey, M. A. Mogan,
Michael 11. McDavitt, Andrew T. Meehan,
D. W. McNeill and F. T. Nolan.
The club is very large and the oldest
Irish social organization on the Paoino
Coast, its birth dating back to June, ISB7.
Its picnics have been the largest that
have gone out of the city from year to
year since that time. Hence a gTand
time is expected.
Citizen's Republican Party.
The county committee of the Citizen's
Republican party met last night and ad
journed until next Monday evening after

ory of the late Senator J. H. Mahoney.
AMONG THE
PLAYHOUSES
"Aristocracy" Draws a
Handsome House.
THE QRPHEUM'S FINE BILL
"CELEBRATED CASE" STILL FILLS
THE ALCAZAR.
Plenty of Real Fun in "Ali Baba"
and a Good Performance
Is Given at
Morosco's
The Frawley company presented "Aris
tocracy" to a good house at the Columbia
last night and gave a smooth and pleasing
performance. However, despite the clever
work done and the painstaking efforts of
the entire company to please, the audi
ence was for some reason quite cold, and
failed to respond to the striking climaxes
in a manner suited to the merits of the
production.
All the principal parts were well ren
dered and the play throughout was cal
culated to please the admirers of high
class comedy drama. Bronson Howard
has made the lines extremely bright and
the points are clean-cut and unmistakable.
"Aristocracy" is a keen satire upon that
class of Americans who worship anything
In human shape that has the good or bad
fortune to be born with a title, and the
application is made so plain that even
those of the dullest comprehension can
appreciate it.
In the character of Jefferson Stockton
Mr. Roberts gives us a fine representation
of a big-hearted, honest,, typical Culifor
nian, whose sole desir* is to make his
young wife happy. Miss Bouton, as the
wife, improves with acquaintance, her
conception of the ambitious but weak wo
man being very creditable. She is a pret
ty woman and dresses the part to perfec
tion. Miss Cora Tinnle, in the character
of the impulsive, unconventional Califor
nia girl, who is not overawed by dukes
or princes, made rapid progress in popu
larity by her clever efforts, and promises
to become a prime favorite. Mr. Sam.
Edwards' English butler was up to his
good standard of genuine comedy. Aside
from an occasional dropping of accent,
Mr. Alfred Hickman as the dudish French
Due was really amusing, while Mr. John
T. Burke and the part of the impecunious
English Marquis in search of a rich bride
presented an admirable character. The
titled villain, as portrayed by Mr. Bell,
showed him to better advantage than his
work of last week, but he could improve
upon it by eliminating some of his abrupt
ness in the speaking of his lines. The
other parts were well taken and the per
formance as a whole deserves a successful
week.
The Orpheum.
The new attractions this week at the
Orpheum are the best that have been
seen here for some time. Tim' Murphy, in
his character sketches representing Henry
Irving in the dream scene from "The
Bells," gave a finished and thoroughly
artistic performance. His imitations of
Joseph Jefferson, Sol Smith Russell, Stu
art Rohson and other well-known actors
were lifelike and captured the audience.
He will be a big drawing card. The two
Judges performed some startling and
really dangerous feats of equilibrium, ren
dered all the more exciting from the fact
that the younger In doing a very dim
cult turn lost his balance and fell, but
was saved from injury by his agility and
that of his partner. The Four Cohans-
Josephine, Helen, George M. and Jerry
presented a charming character sketch
with some burlesque high kicking that
displayed a bewildering maze of lingerie
ana silk ribbons. They are a very clever
quartet and received several flattering re
calls. Their dancing and acting are fresh
and crisp, without being too boisterous
or verging on horse play.
The favorites of last week show up in
some new acts and were heartily wel
DEATH IN A MORPHINE NEEDLE
WALTER C. FENDERSON, a Newspaper Man,
Who Accidentally Poisoned Himself.
Walter C. Fenderson, a newspaper reporter, accidentally killed himself yes
terday afternoon at the Occidental Hotel hy taking an overdose of morphine.
The deceased came to the hotel last Saturday evening on business connected with
the Stockton and Tuolumne Railroad, of which corporation he had been recently
appointed press agent, with headquarters at Sonora. He had been in the habit
of using the drug, and at about 3 o'clock he went to his room and injected a
quantity'of morphine in his arm.
He was found shortly afterward by his wife in an unconscious condition and
medical aid was at once obtained, but the poison had been absorbed into the
system and the unfortunate man died In about twenty minutes after he was dis
covered.
The last work done by Fenderson on a city newspaper was the Federal detail
for an evening daily.

The Tivoli.
In "All Baba" the Tivoli has a bur
lesque that should fill the opera house for
weeks to come. It is bright and catchy
and some of the songs will be hummed
and whistled on the streets ere long. In |
particular Edwin Stevens' "Her Brilliant i
Bright Red Hair." with its refrain, be- j
ginning "Fire: Fire: Fire!" Is sure to be I
popular.
The burlesque follows the old Arabian!
Nights story pretty closely, and the open- i
ing act depicts AH Baba's good luck. In
the second act CassinVs ill-luck is told I
and the audience is introduced into the i
cavern of the forty thieves, while the
third act deals with their extermination :
and the last with the feast of the lan
terns.
As All Baba, the poor woodcutter, John 'â 
.1. RaiTael was good, and as Zlzi. the lieu- :
tenant of the forty thieves, Phil Bran- i
son won the favor nf the house. Louise
Royce. as Morgiana, the faithful -
gi'-l of All Baba. and Zoheide, Oassim's
wife, one of the modern kind, and she ot
thy brilliant bright red hair were very
ye, but Edwin Stevens as Absalom
Abraham, a rich merchant, carried off the
honors. "All Baba" was well staged anu
well played, and the more often it is seeii
the more it will be appreciated.
The Alcazar.
The second week of "A Celebrated j
Case" at the Alcazar Theater began last I
evening and the attendance showed that
the people enjoy an evening with Lewis j
Morrison and the stock company. A !
hearty welcome was accorded to Morri-
Bon. Miss Florence Roberts and Miss Ger- I
trude Foster, and the efforts of Mis. F. I
M. Hates and "Wallace Shew to throw a. j
little pleasantry into the melodrama were
appreciated. YVhon the "Celebrated Case" I
goes off the boards at the end of this
week Morrison will present a tribute to I
our boys In blue in "The Nation's !><â¢- j
fenders," supported by the entire com
pany and 100 people. The now play Is said
to bo replete with incidents of the pr< s
ent war, localized by George Foster Platt.
Great preparation Is being made to have
the piece meet with popular approval.
At the Grand Opera House.
"After Dark," the famous melodrama
by Dion Boucicauk, was presented at the i
Grand Opera-house last night with all its !
sensational and thrilling features, includ- !
ing the attempted murder scenes off Lon- |
don Bridge and the underground railroad
tunnel. The audience at times went wild
with delight. George P. Webster has been
seen to better advantage than as "Old \
Tom," the boatman, but his support was
admirable. Fred J. Butler did a splendid j
piece of character work as Dicey Morris,
the keeper of the gambling house, and i
Chandos Bellingham, his partner in vil
lainy, as portrayed by Landers Stevens,
left nothing to be desired. H. Percy Mel
don as Gordon Chumley, the retired Cap
tain of Dragoons, who foiled the villains,
was very effective and gentlemanly, and
Mortimer Snow pleased his admirers as
Sir George Medhurst. Maud Edna Hall,
Lorena Atwood and Julia Blanc per
formed their respective parts with their
usual judgment and cleverness. The play
should have crowded houses during the
week.
At the Chutes.
The bill at the Chutes Free Theater was
new and every number made a hit. Al
mont and Duraont, musical artists, re
duplicated their Orpheum success; Jack
lin and Grodgens, descriptive vocalists,
sang war songs, and Marion and Lynton,
grotesque comedians, kept the audience
in a roar. Little Claire Fex, a petite and !
clever singer and dancer, and Walter and
Lola Leon, trapeze performers, were well â 
received. The moving war pictures are a
great feature at the Chutes, and the
scenes depicting the departure of the
Peking, laden with troops, and the flag
ship New York, were greeted with cheers, i
Henri Maurice Cannon, the Swiss Gl3
pounder, is as popular as ever.
Fined for Contempt of Court.
Behrend Joost was fined $25 for con
tempt of court by Judge Belcher yester
day. In a recent suit for possession of
land on the Corbett road, on which there !
is a quarry, between Joost and A. B. '
Spreckels, the court rendered judgment j
against Joost. Joost, nevertheless, re- ;
tamed possession until driven away by
the Sheriff, when the force of the rigrht
ful owner began operations. Joost then
appeared and destroyed the tracks used
in removing stone from the quarry. Joost
was then cited for contempt.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June Stock values gener- j
ally appreciated in value to-day to the extent
of important fractions in the standard shares
â¢while the Improvement was considerably great- '
er in some of the specialties. At the opening
the bears attempted to repeat their successes ;
of last week and In the first quarter of an hour
brought about- recessions in the prices of some :
leading specialties, but the railways showed
resistance to the selling movement. ' The early
weakness of wheat and a rather featureless
tone of London gave no decided lead to the !
market and then the anticipated announce- i
ment of the arrival of the American army at i
Santiago and Manila was not forthcoming. The
earnings for the railways for the second week
of June generally showed increases. There was j
evidence of heavy purchases by houses repre- !
senting substantial interests, which quickly
steadied the market and eventually brought
about advances well above Saturday's clos-
Ing. although realizations at times retarded 'â 
the improving tendency. Covering in the
Grangers was partially attributed to the clear !
weather over much of th- crop area. The ris- '
ing movement in stocks was partly credited ]
to the Inability of the bear faction to bring i
about liquidation, and the closing was strong. ;
The bond market was very dull and opera
tions were largely centered in the speculative i
issues. Fluctuations during the forenoon were â ,
Slightly lower, but the market subsequently ;
gained strength and closed very firm. Quota- '
tions for Government securities were unchanged
for most issues, but old 4s registered were con- 1
spicuous for an Improvement of %, while the
old 4s coupon lost Vi in the bid price.
The total salts of stocks to-day were 274,200 I

London financial cablegram says: The stock
niHrki'ts here remain lifeless and dull. The an
nouncement of no English naval maneuvers
this summer was used as a small bear point.
Americans opened steady, but gave way <m
New York selling. Baltimore and Ohio was
lower, although the preliminary outline of the
reorganization scheme was well received. I
am told that the syndicate is already much
>\er-sulisci Ibed.
1 <\ i"'sitlon to the general dullness here to
day was the strength of Bm>.ils and Spanish

where it is urged that Spain cannot be spend

insurrection. There was a further fall In

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 80.â Unfounded rumors that
some one in the grain business in the North
west was In trouble, the clear weather and the
demoralized foreign markets started wheat
weak. For about fifteen minutes a sufficient
number of shorts were Induced to cover to keep
: the price within the limits of the opening
range. But reports of harvest operations be- j
I ing resumed where they have been interrupted |
by rains and every indication of a gigantic
crop, together with the extreme difficulty of !
i marketing It abroad caused a quick break.
; July, which sold at the close Saturday at 72V- I
bid, declined to 70c. September lost l%c, Â»ell
1 ing at 66% c and December sold off l%c at ]
i 06% c. Within an hour, however, the senti- ;
ment showed a change. The market here paid
no further attention to bearish news, as shorts :
were evidently impressed with an idea that the
price had already declined sufficiently. On that
theory and an emphatic denial from the North
west of all the rumors that had been current
early, together with the development of a good
cash demand, shorts bought quite freely and
kept the price rising until the early loss was
more than recovered. Liverpool started at 2-.d
decline for July and IVI each for September
and December, and subsequent quotations from
there came lower and lower until the final
report, which showed July %d lower for the
day and the later deliveries 3d lower. July
! closed with a loss of V,Â£ and September left off
â¢ with an advance of %#%c.
The Improvement in the weather had a weak
: ening influence on corn at the opening. Later
' it recovered all the early decline and %c more
on Important buying by shorts. July closed
j %c higher.
Favorable crop reports and weather forecast
; created a weak feeling in oats at the start.
â  Later, however, the loss was all recovered on
! general buying and the advance In corn. July
' closed %c higher.
The buying of provisions was much better
; than the selling; prices, after yielding a little 1
1 early, recovered sharply. Pork gained 23c, lard

CALIFORNIA ORANGES IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK. June 20.â The Journal of Com
merce says: California oranges continue In
fair demand and prices remain steady and un
changed. Shipments are light, . but there Is
said to be a considerable quantity still to come
forward. Navels spot and to arrive are re
ported to be scarce and good quality. Valen
cias and Mediterranean sweets are in rather
small supply. No shipments of Sorrento or
anges are being made to this market, as they
command better price in Europe than could
be obtained here. California loose muscatel
raisins are dull and neglected, with nominal
and unchanged prices. Some interest is shown
In the new crop of seeded raisins for shipment
from the coast, but few seeders have yet made
prices. The crop at present promises to be
a large one and of good quality, provided late
rains do no Injury to the stock in trays. While
there is a good deal of Inquiry for prices and
information concerning the prospects for the
coming crop, there seems to be a general dis
position to withhold orders until the stock is
ready for marketing. Foreign raisins of all
I kinds are reported to be in limited supply on
spot, but in the absence -.Â» demand prices are
nominal.

KEEN FIGHT
FOR CONGRESS
Victor H. Metcalf Opens
Headquarters.
HARD AFTER MR. HILBORN
H. O. THOWBRIDGE TO HANDLE
THE CAMPAIGN.
Skirmishing to Be Commenced in All
of the Seven Counties That
Form the Third Dis
trict.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Juno 20.
Victor H. Metcalf formally threw out
nla challenge to-day to the camp of Con
gressman Hilborn. There Is no longer
Â»ny doubt that from this time to the pri
maries the Congressional fight will be par
ticularly lively.
The management of Mr. MetcaJf's cam
paign has been placed in the hands of H.
O. Towbridge, a director of the Homo for
Adult Blind. This is a new field for Mr.
Trowbridge, as hitherto he has never fig
ured to any noticeable extent in politics.
as always confined his efforts to the
furtherance of mercantile enterprises and
public benefits, but he possesses much ex
ecutive ability and no one doubts his ca
pacity to organize and be aggressive.
This morning a fine suite of rooms over
tho Union Savings Bank was thrown open
anrl will henceforth be the Metcalf head
ers. Paul Shafer, ex-secretary of the
I of Health, has been installed as
secretary, and from these quarters the
fight in the seven counties composing the
Third Congressional District will be
made. It has not yet been decided how
the Congressional candidates shall elect
their or whether shall be
elected at the State primaries, or whether
there shall be combinations between Con
gressional candidates and others. These
ta caji hardly be settled until the
.Republican State Central Committee ap
portions the delegates and issues the call
lor the State convention.
The friends of Mr. Hilhorn have so far
limited their efforts toward his renomi
nation to sending around circulars and
making personal appeals. It is now prob
ablo that they will effect an organization
ami also open headquarters. A few
weeks ago Mr. Hilborn sent word to his
friends that Congress would keep him
for some time yet, and that he could
not be on the ground to make a personal
campaign. He stated that whatever must
one in his behalf must be done by
his friends.

BOSWORTH STREET GRADE
THE JOLLY JOKER OF THE
RAILWAY COMPANY.
Property Owners May Grade a Street
for the Benefit of Street Car
Magnates â Street Inir
provements.
The Board of Supervisors has taken
up the fight of the Presidio as a camp
ing-place for troops and has passed a
resolution which wlll'be presented to tna
Secretary of War. The resolution was
presented by Supervisor Delany and is
as follows:
Whereas. The Presidio military reservation
In Oils city containing i? tn acres of land, own
ed and occupied by the United States Govern
ment lacks a proper water supply and Is Im
perfectly drained, and for these reasons cannot
accommodate the soldiers sent to this city; and
â¢whereas, by reason of this lack of water and
imperfect drainage the military authorities
have been unable to find camping room on the
â¢Presidio grounds for all the soldiers, and have
therefore established a camp of from 10.000 to
11,000 men on private and ur.sewered blocks di
rectly to the windward of the most populous
portion of the city: and, whereas the placing
â¢ of from 10.000 to 12.000 soldiers on these city
blocks unnecessarily exposes the soldiers to de
moralizing influences and also menaces their
sanitary welfare and that of the city.
Resolved, that Hon. Russell A. Alger, Secre
tary, of War, be and hereby is earnestly re
quested to take steps looking to the creation
of a proper water supply for the Presidio mili
tary reservation and for the proper sewering
of the military reservation with a view to put
ting It In position to accommodate the thou
sands of soldiers now - camping on private
grounds, and the thousands who will necessar
ily be concentrated here from this time for
ward. . .
The resolution will be sent on to the
War Department as quickly as possible,
and the Supervisors hope that there will
bo an end of camps in the heart of the
city before-long.
An order to grade Bosworth, Milton
and Currier streets between Mission
road and the Mission Park and Zoo Tract
was finally passed. The -streets men
tioned run through the vegetable gar
den district, and in some places are as
tnucb. as forty feet below grade. It will
fey* * great deal of money, to raise,- the
Grant this application and the expenses
*?, , tax PPayersP a yers will be reduced. You raise
JjSJ'Xt annually. If this is lessened one
tmra or one-fourth it saves the taxpayers
that. It will bring no more people here
than now congregate here. You say rac
ing is not detrimental. AVhere comes the
Injury in accepting three or four hundred
dollars from another. We do not desire
to be treated other than any one else. We
submit that you must do one thing or the
other. Repeal the ordinance now on your
books and stop racing, or pass this ordi
nance and give the third of your popula
tion a show."
A slight applause started, but was stop
pod by a heavy rap of Ch.->'-man Christie's
gavel. The vote stood 4 ayes, 1 absent
(Doyle). Mr. Frick then asked if an ap
plication for a license to run another race
track would be passed. The chair as
sured him that if made in good faith it
would. During a recess an application
was drawn up and presented on reassem
bling. Trustee Emery was the only ono
to vote against rejecting it, and that was
only to get it to the committee.
It was intimated on the side that the
defeated parties would present a petition
to disincorporate and annex to Oakland.
J. Landregan refused to deny the truth
of this, but said:
"That is a hereafter; wait and see."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 21, 1898.
QUITS SOCIETY
FOR DAWSON
Oakland's Leader of the
Cotillon Departs.
TEARS FOR WILL RUSSELL
WILL SELL POMADE TO THE
DUDES AT KLONDIKE.
Not Only Brains and Deportment But
Gold Is Necessary to Make
a Success in Society
Nowadays.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 20.
Younger society is lamenting the near
departure of Will J. Russell for Dawson
City. For the past four years Will Rus
sell has filled a large niche In the fash
ionable set on this side of the bay. He
has been popular, and his lithe, willowy
physique has made him absolutely in
dispensable in the cotillon. To-morrow
he sails for the north.
Now he Intends to make money, or
rather to take money, out of the earth
around Dawson. He has some ideas oi
his own which he will carry out in the
pursuit of his object, and he doea not
doubt that he will be successful. For
the past few days Mr. Russell, who is,
without controversy, the Ed Greenway
of Oakland, has been preparing for his
trip. At first many of the bright buds
of the Saturday Night Cotillon would not
accept his determination to leave them
as final, but since he returned from San
Francisco with a bearskin robe and other
Klondike aecouterments, faith is placed
in his ambition to go north.
There is good reason for the lamenta
tions accompanying Mr. Russell's depart
ure. For three years he has been a so
ciety leader. As a climax to his so.-ial
successes he last year organized the Sat
urday Night Cotillou, which was a bril
liant success. He personally led the ger
man, and has probably danced more than
any social aspirant in this county. He is
a born dancer, and has certainly danced
his way into favor. He now realizes that
having left college something more than
brains and the ability to dance is neces
sary to continue successful. He, there
fore, has decided to forego kid gloves,
white neckties, pr.tont leather shoes,
creased pants, plug hats, enormous canes
and occasional diamonds for the rougher
garments necessary in an Arctic climate.
"Once out of Oakland." said Mr. Rus
sell, "then good-by to the ballroom, the
drawing room and Broadway. I am go-
Ing on a practical expedition, and do not
presume that I shall find as much pleas
ure in society in Dawson a-s I have found
in Oakland, but I do expect to find more
money. I am taking with me an assort
ment of pomades, anti-mosquito prepara
tions, perfumery and similar stuffs which
I have procured in large lots, and there
will be no ceremony in the manner in
which I dispose of them. I_ .guess I am
able to stand on a street corner, gather
a crowd and sell my wares for ten times
what they cost me. By this means I
shall make my expenses to the gold mines.
I shall captivate my crowd with the same
recitations and the same sleight-of-hand
tricks that I have used in the Lakeside
district, and the rest will be easy. No,
I shall not announce my engagement until
I return."
Theodore Geir Breaks Two Ribs.
OAKLAND, June 20.â Theodore Geir met

Mr. Nicollnl is the Inventor of a machine
for sulphurizing wine barrels. He decid
ed to show It to the wine men while en
joying a pleasure trip. Much to his sur
prise no one would look at it and all
seemed in a hurry to get him off the
place. It now transpires that some one
had started the report that they were
Internal Revenue Department officials in

men, who did not want a word with
them.
Action by the City Council.

park and the ordinance providing a li
cense for beer bottlers were sent back to
the committee. Councilman Pringle caused
some concern by saying that there is a
joker in the bottling ordinance which will
make it possible for saloonkeepers to pay
only $60 per year instead of $400 as at pres
ent.
COLLEGE OF COMMERCE.
A Totally New Department at the
State University.
BERKELEY, June 20.â The academic
senate of the university met this after

Is to afford an opportunity for the scien-
tific study of commerce in all branches
and for the higher education of busi
ness men and officers In the civil serv
ice. The curriculum will take the same
general form as those of the colleges
of general culture, save that one year's
work is to be devoted to some study
bearing directly upon trade and com
merce. Applicants for admission will
take the same examinations prescribed
for matriculation Into the college of so
cial sciences or the college of natural
sciences. For the first two years they
will cover the work of those colleges,
branching off later into politics and
economics or mathematics and the nat
ural sciences.
The degree to be given to the grad
uate of the new college has not yet been
decided upon.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June *20.
Two Individuals whose wits are certain
ly of a high order are working this side
of the bay between Port Costa and Oak
land greatly to their own benefit.
One of these gentlemen wears the garb
of a marine, and the other wears ordi
nary citizen's clothes. A few days ago
they entered an office at Pinole and ask
ed to be connected with Mare Island by
telephone, to make a report about a de
sertion. The connection was denied them
so they took a walk around town. The
marine appeared to be dragging his com
panion in a forcible manner whenever
they approached anybody, but when no
one was looking the two appeared to be
on very intimate terms. They went into
Mr. Boyd's blacksmith shop and as Boyd
is a Deputy Sheriff he always has hand
cuffs handy. The marine told Mr. Boyd
that he had a deserter and begged the
loan of a pair of handcuffs. The de
serter and the marine then proceeded to
take in the town. With his prisoner in
irons the marine led him into various sa
loons, and as he told pitiful tales of how
a deserter would be surely put to death
for his crime, glass after glass of foam-
Ing beverage was placed before them.
After drinking all they could the ma
rine and the deserter went into Mrs.
Lennard's section-house dining-room and
ate two heavy meals, no one dreaming
of suggesting that a marine and a de
serter should pay for anything, and the
couple marched off.
They next went to the editorial sanc
tum of the gentleman who publishes the
Pinole Times, but there they struck a
snag. Their story of the horrible death
awaiting the deserter did not take, and
that Pinole editor suggested that they get
out of town on the double. They were
last seen on board the train going to
ward Oakland and the deserter was still
handcuffed, but no one believes that the
marine "and his deserter" were anything
more than two lively beats.
HOME OF TRUTH.
It Secures One of the Handsomest
Houses in Alameda.
ALAMEDA, June 20.â The Home of
Truth in this city will, on the Ist of Jnly,
take possession of the well-known Bar
ton home, on the corner of Broadway and
Central avenue, the property of the well
known salt capitalist. Thi* is one of the
costliest and hanusomest places in this
city. This "home" is a gathering of peo
ple without capital and without organi
zation, who hold religious services fre
quently, to which the entire public is free
ly invited. They also cure disease by sug
gestion, and depend entirely upon volun
tary contributions for their support. They
began work in this city in a very hum
ble way, occupying iirst a couple of
rooms, then a cottage, and now the most
commodious house in the city.

Lewis-Hussey Wedding.
OAKLAND, June 20.â Dr. P. W. Lewis

dence of the bride's parents. 5G6 Twenty

Dr. Lewis is the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wal
ter F. Lewis of this city. The bride is the
eldest daughter of ex-Sheriff W. H. H.
Hussey, and Is one of the most popular el
ocutionists on this side of the bay. She
Is quite a musician besides. Only the im
mediate members of the contracting par
ties' families were present. To-day was
the thirty-second anniversary of the
groom's parents' wedding, which took
place in Ohio. Dr. and Mrs. Lewis will
spend their honeymoon in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, after which they will reside
in Portland.
one of the heirs, was confirmed by Judee
Greene to-day. The part sold includes the
noted old family residence, built thirty
eight years ago at a cost of $50,000. When
completed in IS6I it was the finest family

FOURTH OF JULY
IN SAN FRANCISCO
THE GREAT FEATURE WILL BE
THE PARADE.
There Will Be About Eight Thousand
United States Soldiers in the
Procession.
The Fourth of July committee, whose
headquarters are In the California Hotel,
is busily engaged In perfecting arrange
ments for the celebration of Indepen
dence day. At a meeting of the execu
tive committee It was decided to hold the
literary exercises in Metropolitan Temple.
Grand Marshal Alfred A. Borllnl will in
troduce the president, Joseph E. O'Don
nell, who will deliver an address^ which
will be followed by the singing of "The
Star-spangled Banner" by Miss Merrill of
the Tivoli.' The orator of the day will be
John J. Barrett. W. W. P^lnnie will sing
a solo entitled "On to Spain," and the
Declaration of Independence will be read
by Julius Kahn. The programme will
conclude with the singing of the "Red
White and Blue" by Miss Daisy Mac-
Keane. In addition to the above features
the, committee intends to secure the ser
vices of some well-known quartet of sing
ers. "The Fourth of July poet" will not
be called upon this year.
The principal feature of the parade will
be the military, as it is expected to have
between seven and eight thousand troops
in line. The line of march has not been
finally determined, but in all probability
it will be down Montgomery street,
thence on Montgomery avenue, thence on
Kearny to Market, and Market to "Van
Ness avenue. It Is claimed by the com
mittee that this celebration will excel any
previous display of the kind ever seen in
San Francisco. Several novelties are in
contemplation which, if successfully pro
duced, will prove great attractions.
The Board of Supervisors has appro
priated $2(XK) for the celebration and the
committee proposes to keep the expense
within this limit and not to call for any
contributions. The heaviest item of ex
pense will be the music, owing to the
presence of so many military organiza
tions.
As to decorations the merchants will ho
requested to use for that purpose the
money which they have hitherto spent
with the committee. It is believed that
in this way more elaborate decorations
will be made than have ever been seen
in San Francisco on any similar occasion.
A circular embodying the above sugges
tion will be sent to the members of the
Stock Exchange, the Produce Exchange,
the Merchants' Exchange, Board of
Trade and other business bodies.
The coming celebration will be marked
by the greatest enthusiasm â greater by
far than has characterized the national
holiday for many a yearâ owing to the
war with Spain, which has awakened the
spirit of patriotism throughout the entire
land.

Pacific Company for personal damages.
Herbert was run into and badly injured
by a train near Penryn. A verdict
awarded him $5000 damages, and the rail
road people appealed. The judgment was
reversed, the higher court holding that
the plaintiff well knew the time trains
were accustomed to pass the point at
which he was injured, and his being in the
way was contributory negligence. The Su
preme Court states that a steam railroad
track of itself is a Bigs of danger and

SHIPS FOR THE
SOUTH SEAS
Auxiliary Schooner for
the Caroline Trade.
STEAMERS ARE TO FOLLOW.
A RUSH TO THE PHILIPPINES
IN PROSPECT.
Captain Moore and the Schooner Free
Trade That Went in Search of
an Island of Gold Heard
From Again.
When the war is over there will be a
big fleet of vessels put in the trade be
tween San Francisco and the Carolines
and Philippines should the stars and
stripes continue to fly over the southern
islands. There will never be a day in
THE ISLES OF THE SEAS.
A new auxiliary schooner is now being built here for the Caroline
Island trade. She is the forerunner of a big fleet of American vessels
that will engage in the Caroline and Philippine Island trade when the
war is over. ,
the year but what some vessel flying the
American flag will enter Jakiit and Ma
nila and the commerce of those isles of
the sea will grow by leaps and bounds.
At the present time Matthew Turner is
building a smart auxiliary schooner for
the Caroline trade. She will be 95 feet
long, 24 feet beam and 9 feet deep. She
will be fitted with a 50-horsepower kero
sene engine by the Union Gas En
gine Company and she is expect
ed to make nine or ten knots an
hour without the use of her sails.
The intention is to use 150 test
kerosene, as that grade of oil can be ob
talned in any part of the world, while
gasoline and low-grade oils cannot. It
will cost more money to run the vessel
on 150 grade kerosene, but then it is ab
solutely safe and the underwriters will
take a risk on the vessel.
The new 6chooiier lias been built to the !
order of Wilkins & Co. and is to be railed j
the Isles of the Sea. She is intended for
the inter-island trade in the Caroline
group and will serve as one of many
feeders to a line of ocean steamers that
Is to be put on the route. The Isles of the
Sea will bo rigged like a steam schooner
and will carry Quite a spread of canvas.
Great care is being exercised in the build
ing of the 'null and machinery.
The timeballs on the new ferry depot
and Telegraph Hill did not drop at noon
yesterday. Crowds of people stood along
the front with watches in hand gazing
skyward, but the balls did not fall. Some
of the captains and mates thought that |
their timepieces were wrong and won
dered what had happened. As minute
after minute passed and still the signals
did not drop they came to the conclu
sion that the fault was with the navy
yard observatory. At twelve minutes past
12 the ball on the ferry depot building
began to drop inch by inch, us though it
were ashamed of itself, and while the on
lookers were watching it the ball on Tel
egraph Hill fell with a rush. There was
Bomethlng the matter .with the electric
appliances.
On March 30 the schooner Free Trade
sailed from San FTancisco with a party :
of Englishmen aboard in search of an !
"island of gold." On April 12 the schoon
er Altair, fitted out by A. P. Hotaling and
others, followed the Free Trade on the
same mission. Captain Moore was in
command of the Free Trade and Captain
Gordon Moore's fonrw-r mate, was cap
tain of the Altair. According to the Eng
lishmen who went up on the Free Trade
the whole affair was a swindle and the
"island of gold" existed only in the im
agination of the two captains. At Kar- j
luk they wc-re put ashore and when they
objected the men on the Altair joined is- j
sues with Moore and carried the day.
Since then J. Talbot Wataon and H.
Fradgely have reached San tranclsco
poorer but wiser men.
In the meantime the Free Tade has j
made her way to, Netarts Hay. on the
Oregon coast, while the Altair has not
yet been heard from. In his report of the
wildgoose chase, Captain Moore wrote
in his log: "Monday, May 6â A. Fradge
ly the freight clerk, presents a revol
ver at the captain's head and threatened
to blow out his brains if he did not put
the ship under sail for sea instead of
making for the nearest port. The next
day the purser, J. Talbot Watson, and the
boatswain joined Fradgely in the at
tempt to make him put to sea. and there
was a repetition of the gun play. Ar
riving at I'kak Bay, Alaska, the follow
ing day, the mate and supercargo Joinea
the mutineers and deserted, taking all
the captain's effects with them. When.
Moore ordered the vessel under way seven
more of the cr<-w deserted. By signals
of distress the assistance of the schooner
Altair was enlisted and the crew forced
to obey orders. Captain Moore put to sea.
but was compelled by the crew to sail for
the Columbia River. After a dangerous
voyage, during which the crew repeatedly
threatened mutiny, the schooner arrived
at Netarts Bay. through the ignorance of
some of the sailors who had assumed
temporary command of the ship."
If ever Captain Moore re.iches San
Francisco he will receive a warm recep
tion. J. Tnlbot Watson, the Free Trade's
purser, and H. Fradgely. freight clerk,
will prosecute him for piracy. Messrs.
Watson arid Fradgely are out about
$10,000 on the "Island of Gold" venture.
The overdue schooner Alton has been
heard from. She was so long making
the run from Yakutat to tho Sound that
she was almost given up for lost. Yes
terday she was spoken in the Straits of
Juan de Fuca. and probably reached Ta
coma last night.
The steamer Humboldt got away for St.
Michaels yesterday. She did not have
many passengers or much freight, but
expects to secure a full load at Seattle.
The old crew of the Mail steamer Now
port was transfered to the quarantine
station yesterday and a new crew brought
the vessel to the Mail dock. As soon as
her cargo has been discharged the New
port will be turned into a Manila trans
port.
Frank Wolters, a butcher, jumped off
the ferry boat Piedmont on the 6:30 a, m.
trip yesterday. A boat was lowered and j
he was rescued. He was taken to Oak- â 
land and locked up on a charge of j
"drunk."
The gasoline fishing launch Klondike :
caught fire yesterday, and tho crew sent- j
tlea her In "order to .save tho boat She I
will be raised to-day and a coat of paint
ajid an overhauling will make her as
good as new.
SOUTH TO THE OCEAN.
The New Line of Electric Cars on H
Street Will Run To-Morrow.
A trial start of the electric cars on H
street, south of the park, will be made
to-morrow from Stanyan street to the
ocean beach. This line is over the same
route formerly covered by the steam
dummy service which had Its terminus
at the eastern end of the Golden Gate
Park, with the difference that instead of
turning In off Stanyan street and round
ing the southeast corner of the park the
present line runs straight along H street
to Stanyan. where it connects with the
Oak and Kilia streets service, as also
with all of the Market-street Company's
electric lines running into the park and
the western section of the city.
The work done on this new branch was
performed over the roadway already
made for the steam line. Yet an en
tirely new bed, ties and rails, wero laid
along the entire roadway, fully equipped
for a permanent service. The construc
tion of the poles differs from what the
company has heretofore set up on its
other lines, in that there is but one
string of upright poles set. This string
is located in the center of the roadway,
with arms extending to which the trol
ley wires are attached.
The work of placing the trolley wires
in position was commenced on Sunday
at the western or ocean end of the line,
and worked inward to Stanyan street,
where the necessary connections with
the power-house will be completed some
time to-day, and by to-morrow the first
car will be sent over the line.
ror the present the old omnibus cars
which did service on the Howard-street
line have been transformed and fitted
up with the necessary batteries for
every-day service on this line, but on
Sundays and other festive occasions the
large cars that trailed arter the steam
dummies will be used. The lettering on
the cars will indicate the section of the
city fur which they are intended to do
service. It will read thus "From Stan
yan street to the Cliff, via Xinth and
Fourteenth avenues."
The opening of this line, together with
other improvements in the Sunset Valley,
will be hailed with much pleasure. So
jubilant are the residents over the af
fair that on the night of July 5 a big
demonstration will be made by the im
provement club of the district. By
that time the much sought for sewer will
be finished and the Spring Valley Water
Company will have Its main laid from
its supply source into the center of the
district, thus retiring for all time to
come the man with the bucket and
water cart, who has been a rescuing an
gel to the people for a number of years.
And as a final touch the Supervisors
have promised to light up the valley for
the next fiscal year.
WANT A WHOLE
HOUR FOR LUNCH.
WHOLESALERS TO CLOSE SHOP
FROM 12 TO 1.
A Movement on Foot Among Mer
chants to Give Their Employes
a Uniform Lunch Hour.
The managers of many of the large
wholesale houses of the city are trying
to establish a definite hour for their em
ployes. It is proposed to ask the whole
salers to agree to close their places of
business each day from 12 to 1 and allow
every one in their employ the hour for
lunch. The system now In vogue is to
let the clerks and other employes go to
their lunches in relays. In most of the
large houses the first relay goes to lunch
at 11 o'clock and generally it is well on
into the afternoon before the last of the
clerks get a chance to get away from
their work for the midday meal. The
managers of the houses say that the
working forces of the stores are demor
alized for at least say three hours each
day on account <>f the lunch hour sys
tem now in vogue. With the proposed
system the stores would be closed for an
hour every day, but during business
hours all hands would be ready for ser
vice, making less friction in the transac
tion of business and give greater atten
tion to customers.
For the past year Schilling & Co. have
closed the doors of Its place of business
from 12 to 1, and the plan has given the
most satisfactory results. Many of the
wholesalers of Eastern cities nave for
years been giving their employes a stated
hour for lunch and the plan has given
good results to them.
Many of the local merchants have
signed a call for a meeting of the Board
of Trade, at which it Is proposed to In
duce the wholesalers to agree on closing
their stores at the noon hour. Sanford
Bennett, secretary of the Dunham, Car
rigan & Haydcn Company, is taking
the initiative In the local movement.

Travelers on the Bay.
The members of the San Francisco Com
mercial Travelers' Association, with their
families and a few friends, enjoyed an
excursion on the bay on Sunday. The
steamer Grace Barton was engaged for
the occasion and a most enjoyable time
was spent. Alcatraz and Angel islands,
California City and San Quentin were
visited. At the latter place the picnickers
were serenaded by the prison band. Lunch
v;is served at McNears Landing, and on
the return trip the Union Iron Works and
South San Francisco were visited.

an assayer, by Judge Ilebbard, yester
day, on the ground of failure to provide.
Alimony in the sum of $30 a month and
the custody of two minor children were
awarded the plaintiff. Sarah A. Crowley
was granted a divorce from Charles
Crowley on the ground of willful neglect.
Delia M. Glover applied for a divorce

THE SAN FTCANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUKE 21, 1898
CHEWED THE
DOCTOR'S ARM
A Union Mission Army
"Major's" Appetite.
A. W. MOORE A CANNIBAL
DR. M. S. LOONEY THE VICTIM
OF HIS VICIOUSNESS.
Tlie Physician Went to Collect a Bill
and the Religious Degenerate
Set Upon Him in Bulldog
fashion.
"Major" A. W. Moore of the Union Mis
sion Army, with headquarters at 1131 Mis
sion street, has again pot himself into
serious trouble, and to-day a warrant will
be sworn out for his arrest on a charge
of mayhem of a most aggravated na
ture.
On May 14 last Moore had his face con- i
siderably disfigured by a soldier, the I
brother of his landlady. The assault was !
the result of a brother defending the good
name of his sister. Moore went to Dr. j
M. S. Looney, 141 Eleventh street, to have i
his broken nose, cut lips and other in- ;
juries attended to. It was a long and
delicate operation, requiring the assist
ance of Henry Klopper, a student of the
California Medical College.
Dr. Looney sent in his bill, amounting â 
to $35. but on Moore's plea that he was
not laboring for filthy lucre but for the ,
good of his fellow-men, the doctor agreed
to reduce the bill to $15. He called fre
quently upon Moore for the payment of
the bill and was finally offered $5, which
he refused to accept.
yesterday the doctor, accompanied by
Klopper, again called at the army head
quarters and Moore showed fight. He
butted the doctor In the Btomach and,
after knocking him down, grasped him by
the legs and dragged him off the platform
through the null and threw him on the
Bidewalk. While doing bo Moore Insert
ed his teeth in the doctor's right arm
and bit it to the bone. The pain was ex
crui lating, and while Moore was at
tempting to t:ike another bite Klopper
dragged him off the doctor and stopped
his cannibalistic propensities. .
Moore hurried to Judge Low's court and
by withholding the main facts he got a
warrant for the arrest of Dr. Looney and |
Klopper on the charge of disturbing the
peace. Meantime the doctor had gone to
liis office and his wounded arm was
stitched and dressed. He then went to
Judge Joachimsen's court with Klopper
to swear out a warrant for Moore's ar
rest, but was amazed to find that Moore
had forestalled him. The facts were ex
plained to the Judge and the doctor's
bloody and disfigured arm was sufficient
evidence of the truth of his statements.
The Judge at once gave the doctor and
Klopper orders of release upon their own
recognizance, but as he was busy hear
ing arguments of counsel in an important
case he postponed issuing the warrant for
Moore's arrest until this morning.
Moore came into prominence about
three months ago by threatening to kill
W. J. Davis, the originator of the army, i
with an ax. The army headquarters were
then at 114 Hayes street. Previous to that
he had Davis and his wife arrested on a
trumped-up charge so that he could, as
he admitted in court, get absolute pos
session of the headquarters.
Before coming to this city last Decem
ber M.o re was a member of God's Regu
lar Army in Portland, Or., and the "gen
eral" of 'that army published in the army
magazine a notice warning people to have
nothing to do with him. "General" Du
g:m, who is now serving a life sentence
in San Quentin, was also a member of
this army in Portland.

grand battle. McKeever. owine to his
years of experience In punching noses and
ducking lefthanders, Is selling a favorite
in the pools, but last evening a numberof
friends of the local lad made up a purse
which was given to Crowley and Raggett
to be placed on McConnell at the pre
vailing odds, which are 10 to 7, with Mc-
Keever on the long end.
Among the good judges of pugilism are
to be found men in this city who will
gamble on McConnell because they believe
that he Is as clever as his opponent and
can land a much harder blow. Greggains.
tho pugilist who first discovered in Mc-
Connell the makings of a champion, says
that he has seen both men fight and that
McConnell will whip the Eastern welter
weight without a doubt, and in tolerably
short order. At any rate the members of
the San Francisco Athletic Club will line
up in the poolrooms this evening and
doubtless the betting v.Mll close at even
money or possibly McConnell may wind
up a favorite.
The sporting public can rest assured on
seeing a contest that from a scientific
point of view should be well worth going
quite a distance to witness. If McCon
nell con hold anything like his own for
half a dozen rounds he will certainly
make <i great impression on his friends,
up when feeling conlldent he puts up a
hard and rapid fight.
There are not a few among the sport
ing fraternity who expect to witness a
hurricane battle when Young Peter Jack
son and Frank Purcell get mixed up in
the game. Jackson is a wicked fighter,
and Purcell. having had a tilt with the
colored welterweight before, has trained
faithfully with the aim of standing off
the rushes of his opponent and ending
the game as speedily as possible.
Notwithstanding that there is not as
much talk heard over this match as when
Shurkey and Jeffries were booked to fight
yet tickets have been selling rapidly, and
the indicntions for a large crowd being
present are very good.
Woodward's Pavilion has been arranged
recently with a view of comfortably seat
ing the large gathering that will be on
hand when the band will play for "the
conquering hero" as the celebrated mas
ter of ceremonies, Sir William Jordan
steps Into the ring with his voice tuned
for the occasion. Phil Wand will referee
both contests.

WOULD USE
POPULISTS
AS A CLUB
Maguire's Friends De
vise a Bold Scheme.
OTHER DEMOCRATS EXCLUDED
PEOPLE'S PARTY ASKED TO SUP
PORT KIM.
A Plan to Introduce a Resolution
That May Bring About the Con
gressman's domination for
Governor.
The friends of Congressman Maguire,
Vho have taken It upon themselves to as-
Blst him in his efforts to secure the Dem
ocratic nomination for Governor, are
making a last desperate effort to regain
the ground that has been so rapidly slip
ping from beneath their feet during the
pafit two months. The attempt embraces
an endeavor to secure partial control of
the Populist party through some of its
leaders, the control to be manifested
In the interest of Maguire to the exclu
sion of all other Democratic candidates on
the State ticket.
Within the past week the men who have
charge of the Congressman's political
campaign have made overtures to the
Populist leaders in this city for the pur
pose of bringing about a secret joint con
ference for the discussion of the follow
ing proposition: "That the Populist party
refuse to entertain any fusion proposi
tion from the Democratic party as applied
to the State ticket; that when the Popu
list State Convention meets in Sacramento
on July 12 it shall nominate George W.
Monteith for Governor; that the conven
tion shall adopt a resolution providing
that In case the Democratic convention
shall nominate Maguire for Governor,
then Monteith shall resign his candidacy
and the Populist vote for Governor shall
be given to Maguire; that Maguire on his
part shall enter into a pledge stipulat
ing that in case he be elected he will, in
the distribution of the patronage of the
office, give certain of the places to Pop
ulists."
' The promoters of this very pretty
Echeme naturally believe that if the Pop
ulists can be Induced to carry out their
part of the programme the fact can be
used as a powerful lever to induce the
Democratic convention to give Maguire
the place at the head of Its ticket. All
hope if fusion on any such plan as was
carried into effect at the last general
election has been abandoned by the lead
ers of both parties. This being so, the
Democrats would more than likely grab
at a chance that would possibly secure
them the election of a Democratic Gov
ernor, even if by so doing they would be
forced to swallow bo bitter a pill as Ma
guire.* Patronage is none the less sweet
because it is dealt out by an unpopular
hand.
The individual fusion plan may there
fore be looked upon as a good one, and
the friends of Maguire would have just
cause to feel jubilant were it not for the
fact that Its success is conditional on the
consent of MunteKh nnd the men who
will have control of the Populist conven
tionâand this is where the shoe is likely
to pinch.
Monteith says, ho would not object to
the honor of being selected by the Popu
lists as their leader in the coming cam
paign, but he has a decided objection to
being made a catspaw wherewith to
haul Maguire's chestnuts out of the fire.
He admits that he has been approached
with a proposition to go before the Popu
list convention as a candidate for the
place at the head of the ticket, with the
understanding that in cast he should se
cure the nomination he will abide by the
provisions of a resolution making his can
didacy contingent . ion the failure of the
Democratic convention to nominate Ma-
Ie proposition seems to me to be a.

and to his inter'!-'..-, and even hi? candi

list party too much at h^art to be;rnne
a party to any Bcheme that would work
injury to the principles wl-.'.ch we repre
sent. Such a scheme I beMeve this to be.
Although I am personally opposed to fu

Congressman will probably meet with no

Itching So Severe Could Not Keep
From Scratching. Physician's
Remedies No Benefit. Cured
By Half Box Cuticura.
At the time that I sent for your book, I was
suffering from Eczema on tho right ear. I
could hardly keep my hands off the afflicted
surface, the itching was bo severe Every time
I would touch my car small bubbles would
open emitting a watery-Hko substance, ap-
parently poisonous, as when it was commun-
icated to other parts of tho body it would
produce the same irritation. One of the lead-
ing doctors here treated me for a while and
applied the usual physician's remedies with-
out benefit. My brother was using Cuticura
at the time and recommended that I try it. Â»
bough t a box of Cuticcra (ointment) and had '
the satisfaction of eecingimmediate progress.
The first application ica* toothing, and be-
fore the box was half gone the disease had dis- .
appeared, and I am pleased to flay that there
feu never been any recurrence of the trouble.

WOULD LEAVE LAW FOR WAR
District Attorney Barnes, Fired by Ambition but
Hampered by Avoirdupois, Yearns for Battle.
Perhaps the fact is not generally known, but nevertheless it is a fact portentous to the Spanish nation,
that District Attorney W. S. Barnes wants to pird up his loins and go forth to battle. The length of the nec
essary girMle is not a proper matter for exploitation here. Enough to say that "Little Blllie" Barnes has
snuffed the conflict from afar, and now he desires to get right into|the middle of it.
To those who are not acquainted with the District Attorney it may be interesting to learn that his
weight has risen to something over three hundred pounds, and is still risin'. If patriotirm were to propel him
at full speed upon the enemy, there would be nothing for the enemy to do but get away from there, or get the
everlasting Castilian honor smashed out of him. Mr. Barnes is in dead earnest. His nostrils dilate with ardor,
while his proud breast heaves. He does not care to go in the ranks, realizing that he would occupy the
space occupied by two ordinary men, and thus destroy the symmetry of evolutions. His friends are somewhat
dubious as to his fighting prowess, but think he might be utilized as fortifications.
When the first call to arms came, and Mr. Barnes applied^to Governor Budd for a commission, there
was none to give. The Governor professed great sorrow, the genuineness of which was questioned by the unin
formed. Mr. Barnes went about his regular business of sending people to jail. If he could not draw a
sword, he could draw a warrajit. But things have changed. If the Governor has anything to say about it Mr.
Barnes will go to the scene of ruction full panoplied for war. Happy the men to follow him. They can shield
themselves behind his ample frame nor wist of the hall of bullets so long as their leader keeps his feet and
presence of mind.
A dark and unworthy suspicion arises that Governor Budd has sinister designs in conniving at the send
ing of Mr. Barnes to the tropics, for Barnes has been mentioned as a gubernatorial possibility. In a sense they
are rivals. Budd's admirers declare he would do no such thing, but David of old, who stands high In popu
lar estimation, did worse. Perhaps, however, the ambition of the one and the deep plot of the otherâ if such
there beâ will fail. No man can enter the army without having passed a physical examination. This Is an or
deal from which the fat are prone to shrink, although not enough to bring them down to regulation weight
There seems to exist a doubt whether a man, be he never so patriotic, never so ready to fall for his country,
can get the chance to fall while he has so many pounds that they have to be reckoned on the hay scales. This
circumstance may keep Barnes from the front. To accommodate him would require most of the front and he
couldn't be an army all by himself. '
ances with othor parties.
While the accomplishment of such a
scheme as that proposed by the friends
of Congressman Maguire is out of the
question, it provides a good illustration
of the methods by which they are seek
ing to overcome the unpopularity of their
candidate.
NEVILLS EXTORTION CASE.
Motion for the Defendants to Dismiss
Argued and Judgment Reserved.
When the case of Myron EL Azhdorian,
Mrs. Elsie 'Williams and Mrs. Grace
L<M so was called in Judge Joaohimsen's
court yesterday afternoon Attorney Baker
moved for a dismissal on the ground that
no evidence had been adduced to support
the charge of extortion preferred by the
millionaire mine owner. W. A. Nevills.
He was followed by ex-Judge Ferral, who
argued that Azhderian and Mrs. Loose
should at least be discharged as there-was
absolutely nothing to connect them witn
the charge.
District Attorney Barnes and Prosecut
ing Attorney Graham argued against tho
motion, and the Judge said he would taj<Â©

To any one who has watched the course

: the benison of a visit from the skies. The
j opportunity is at hand, and is grasped
I with a sense of Joy. The evening paper

blow at the demon rum.
In a saloon on Van Ness, and probably
in other places of a like character, is a

letin will be given free with every 10-cent
drink. Perhaps some might .lump to the
unjust conclusion that this was a scheme
to swell circulation up to the affidavit
standard, but the conclusion would be
wrong to the Bulletin. It has merely of

might rush in where an average angel
would fear to tread, throw his dime on

this be merciful? Is it not better that

N. P. Sorensen Relates
Wonderful Things.
MORE GOLD THAN KLONDIKE
SOUTH SEA ISLANDS FILLED
WITH MINERAL WEALTH-
An Expedition That Had Some Re
markable Experiences â How the
Sophie Sutherland Was
Sunk.
If credence can be placed in the state
ment made by N. P. Sorensen, who ar
rived )n San Francisco from Newcastle,
N. S. W., on the three-masted ship Bel
ford on Sunday, and who left this city
on September 4 in charge of the expedi
tion sent out by the South Sea Commer
cial Company, a local corporation, on a
trading and prospecting voyage to the
South Sea Islands, the land south of the
equator has mineral wealth that surpass
es the Klondike.
Mr. Sorensen, who was seen yesterday
on board the Belford, on which he is
boatswain, told an interesting story of
the experiences encountered by the party
that left on the Sophie Sutherland, a
three-masted schooner, commanded by
Captain McLean, well known through his
exciting experiences with the Russian
Government. The boatswain was given
a power of attorney by Henry Bowles,
president of the corporation, and was
virtually in command of the expedition.
The story he told in his quarters in the
forecastle is in part as follows:
"We left this city for Apia, Samoa, and
arrived there after a passage of thirty
odd days. The only trouble on the trip
was that some of the members of the
party refused to work. In Samoa they
were informed by a Mr. Moore that thir
ty miles up the coast there was a river
containing a copper lode. The steam
launch was got out and an exploring
party was sent up the stream, but met
with disappointment. On our return we
found Cautain McLean and many of the
men druiiK. While lying in the harbor
a man named Glng went ashore and con
tracted a fever which spread among the
passengers. .
"I visited the German Commissioner
and obtained permission to prospect
among the islands. We then left for Tu
lagi to obtain the British Consul's con
sent, which was granted.
"We began mining operations at Moroo
Bay A shaft was sunk, but water was
struck at a depth of eight feet and no
results were obtained, although we spent
nineteen days in the task. Captain Mr-
Lean and myself manned a whaleboat and
went up to Makira Bay, where I showed
the captain fine red and white marble
and also beautiful teak forests. On our
return the King of Yanuta. who accom
panied us, informed me that all the speci
mens brought aboard the ship were from
one place. He promised to send some one
with our party to the mineral deposit. I
asked Mr. Goldsmith, a mining expert, to
accompany us, but he refused. So the
captain, myself and thirty negroes went.
We found a reef, through which the river
flowed, and a wall liUert with decomposing
quartz We took away some beautiful
specimens, and one of the negroes brought
us one from a point on the reef 200 feet
higher than where I stood."
Mr Soronsen then told of prospecting in
places suggested by the natives, and pro
duced splendid specimens of gold-bearing
rock, copper, boride of arsenic and other
minerals, some of which were analyzed in
Sydney and were proven to contain the
substance named. Mr. Sorenpen will to
day visit his employers and make his re
port He will tell of the treatment he re
ceived while aboard, how he was put off
at Tulagi without firearms to protect him,
and with very little food; how he ap
pealed to Captain Woodford, an old resi
dent there, and how he was advised to
leave on the next mail steamer; how he
took passage on the Titus, and iiow when
the steamer arrived in Marau harbor he
found the Sophie Sutherland there with
her topmasts gone and the vessel partly
sunk, owing to the drunken condition of
her commander and his crew: how he con
tinued on to Sydney and went to New
castle and shipped before the mast as
boatswain, not having money to pay his
passage. The tale will not only astonish
his employers, but make them indignant
at the treatment he received.
Sorensen relates his story in a convinc
ing manner, and supports everything he
says by the conclusive evidence.
SUDDEN DEATH OF
JAMES T. WATKINS
FORMERLY A WELL-KNOWN SAN
FRANCISCO JOURNALIST.
Was Employed During the Last
Years of His Life as an Editor
of the New York Sun.
The funeral of James T. Watkins, a
well-known former Californlan, will take
place at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning
from the residence of I. B. Owens, 2440
Pacific avenue, northeast corner of Stein
er. Mr. Watklns was for several years
one of the editors of the Now York Even
ing Sun. On the morning of June 9he died
suddenly while on his way to the Sun of
fice. His remains were forwardod to San
Francisco for burial.
It was in this city that he ventured into
Journalism and literary work, and it was
Icrr that he earned a most enviable repu
tation in his profession. In lat^r years he
acquired new laurels in the metropolis.
The test editorial that he wrote was en
titled "The Naming of the New Snips,"
which appeared in the Evening Sun on
the day of his death In the same issue
was published the following obituary,
which is a high tribute to the old Califor
nia Journalist:
"Mr. James T. Watkins, long a valued
member of the editorial staff of this pa
per, died suddenly this morning wnlle on
his way to his office. Mr. Watklns was in
his sixtieth year, and was the only son of
the very well known Commodore Watkins
of the Pacific Mail Company's China fleet,
celebrated among the old-time sailors of
California's golden days. Mr. Watkins
was a very erudite and accomplished
writer, a student-specialist in many sub
jects, and was possessed of a vast store
of varied and useful information. He was
an active and leading figure in San Fran
cisco journalism and was one of the prin
cipal contributors to the Overlap. l Month
ly during Bret Harte's editorship. Mr.
Watkins held a high place in tils profes
