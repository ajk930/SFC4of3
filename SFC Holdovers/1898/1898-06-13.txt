MANILA HAS SURRENDERED
PANORAMA OF THE CITY OF MANILA, THE METROPOLIS OF THE PHILIPPINES,

Ir> Cipher Â¥\e Cables tÂ±>e Words: "fid

Manila Has Surrendered."
NEW YORK, June 12.â A special to the Herald from Wash
ington says : General Augusti, Governor General of the Philip
pines, has surrendered the city of Manila. This information was
conveyed to the State Department late to-night in a cablegram
from Embassador Hay in London.
The Embassador gave no particulars. His dispatch read :
"Advices from Hongkong state that Manila has surrendered."
In the absence of positive information the authorities cannot
say whether the surrender has been made to Admiral Dewey or
to General Aguinaldo, the insurgent leader. It is known that the
insurgents since Admiral Dewey's victory have been close to the
city of Manila, and that it was only a question of time when Gen
eral Augusti would be forced to surrender.
It is regarded as probable that the surrender has been
brought about by the activity of the insurgents rather than by the
American fleet, as it had been Admiral Dewey's policy to remain
inactive while awaiting the troops which have been started out to
re-enforce him.
It is regarded as probable, however, that the Spanish General
surrendered to Admiral Dewey rather than to the insurgent chief
tain, as he could be more assured that order would be preserved
and Spanish life and property protected under the American ad
miral than under General Aguinaldo.
Owing to the lateness of the hour when the cablegram from
Embassador Hay was received and its indefinite character it was
not communicated to the members of the Cabinet to-night. It is
hoped that information v/ill be received direct from Admiral Dewey
within the next few hours giving the details of the surrender.
As soon as the dispatch had been translated from the State Department
cipher in which it was received a copy of it was sent to the White House, where the in
formation was received with delight by President McKinley. While Embassador Hay
did not say what was the source of his information, it is believed by officials of the State
Department that the advices which he referred to were dispatches from British officials
at Hongkong, and that they are entirely reliable.
Detailed dispatches from Admiral Dewey are awaited with much interest by the
officials. It is not believed they will be far behind the cablegrams which have evidently
reached the. British Government. It is probable that the ship which carried the in
formation to the British officers at Hongkong also carried a dispatch from Admiral
Dewey to the Secretary of the Navy, but as Hongkong is a British port the dispatches of
the British Government would have the right of way.
POPE LEO OFFERS HIS SERVICES,
LONDON, June 13. â The Rome correspondent of the Standard says: Owing to the seri
ous news from the Philippines the Pope wired the Queen Regent of Spain, placing his services at
her disposal if she considered that the time had arrived for the intervention of the powers in favor
of Spain.
The Oueen Regent, in reply telegraphed her thanks, saying that "at an opportune mo
ment she should feel the Pope's offer to be very precious."
INTERVENTION BEING CONSIDERED.
LONDON, June 12. â The Daily says editorially this morning: "We learn from
an exceptionally well-informed source that communications of a character which lend themselves
to official repudiation, are passing between Vienna, Paris, Berlin and St. Petersburg on the ques
tion of intervention between Spain and America. It is said that Emperor Francis Joseph has taken
the initiative. Spain, however, must face the situation squarely. Cuba and Porto Rico will obtain
independence, and in all probability the United States will retain the Philippines as security for the
indemnity, which is not likely to be paid for many years."
All the special dispatches from Berlin this morning deny that Germany has any intention of
calling a conference as to the Philippines.

SHIFTER'S
ARMY OFF
TO CUBA
Twenty -Nine Transports
Begin tr;e Voyage to
Santiago.
NEW YORK, June 12.â The Wash- j
lngton correspondent of the Herald
sends the following:
Major General Shafter, with his army
17,000 strong, is at last en route to San
tiago de Cuba. This is now officially
admitted by the officials. Twenty-nine
transports laden with the best material
of thÂ© Untied States army are to-night
nearlng Key West, where they will Join
additional convoys from Admiral
Sampson's fleet. The authorities all in
sist there will be no further delay In
the Santiago expedition. They are no |
longer concerned about the quartet of i
Spanish gunboats, reported to be as- j
tray and waiting a favorable oppor- I
tunity to pounce upon the army trans- j
ports. With a strong fleet of naval i
vessel^ convoying the transports no
fear is entertained for the safety of the
expedition. Its arrival at Santiago by
Thursday is expected. Thus it seems
reasonable to predict that the present
week will see the American flag flying
over Santiago de Cuba.
The army now on its way to Santiago
comprises the best troops mobilized.
It is equipped and armed better than
any body of troops the United States
has ever sent into the field. Our in
fantry is furnished nearly exclusively
with Krag-Jorgensen rifles, which are
considered by ordnance experts the
most destructive rifle now in use. The
insurgents, who are expected to form
a junction with the American troops
at the place of landing, have been
armed by the United States with mod
ern Springfield rifles. The army has an
abundance of ammunition to carry it
on a long and difficult campaign.
The transports will be kept as closely
together as safe navigation will per- j
mlt, and the warships will be'deployed i
ahead, astern and on either flank of j
the fleet. Scouting vessels will be j
thrown far out in advance of the trans
ports and in order â  insure against
an attack from the rear, some of these
vessels will linger far astern, ready to
signal the heavily armored cruisers at
the first sign of an approaching foe.
The battleship Indiana Is expected to
lead the ships.
TAMPA, Fla., June 12.â The censor
says we can tell what we saw on
Wednesday. We cannot tell what hap
pened before that day or after that day.
This the sc^ne:
Men are marching to the tune of a
drum and cars are shunting and whistles
blowing, and at the end of a long
pier trucks are rolling over loose
boards loaded with boxes of ammuni
tion arid rifles. Whenever they pass
the soldiers sleeping on the loose boards
are shaken a half inch or so and groan
In their sleep, other sleepy and hungry
soldiers fall out of army transports and
walk over the bodies of men asleep on
the boards. The clay has begun and no
one has slept, and soon the water is
covered with boats laden with baggage
and men, and the transports are crowd
ed with men at the port holes, shoulder
to shoulder on the decks, and on the
superstructure men hanging on ratlines
are crucified against the sky on the
mainstays.
The sun comes out fierce and brazen.
There is not enough wind to raise the
flags on the halliards. The bay is like
a mirror with ouicksilver on fire. Over
this lake of blazing quicksilver great
transports move slowly out into mid
stream, and as each stirs and feels the
first pull of the towing line, hundreds
of American soldiers hanging to their
sides take off their sombreros and
cheer, ana the bands on the decks play
"The Star Spangled Banner"; and as
they pass the transports at anchor the
soldiers cheer each other, and the
crowds on the - ier cheer them, and the
hot air is torn with their voices and
fanned with thousands of hats beating
it and raised in relief and rejoicing.
That is where the scene halts for the
present.

ADMIRAL CAMARA IS
COMING TO HIS DOOM.
Expected to Leave Cadiz With Span
ish Beserve Squadron the Latter
Part of This Week.
NEW YORK, June 12.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Official information received by the
naval authorities is that the departure
of the Spanish resp- â<Â» squadron from
Cadiz under command of Admiral Ca
mara may be expected the latter part
of this week. Its immediate destina
tion, it is believed, will be the Canaries,
and after that Porto Rico and Cuba.
Plans have been practically formulat
ed by the Naval War Board for meet
ing and destroying Admiral Camara's
squadron, and for operating against
the Canary Islands, and Spain just as
soon as Admiral Cervera's squadron is
destroyed. As soon as Santiago de
Cuba and the Spanish fleet there are
taken a formidable squadron will be
organized to cruise in search of Ca
mara's squadron, and if accessary a
demonstration will be made against
Spain. This squadron will probably be
commanded by Commodore Schley.
Rear Admiral Sampson will direct op
erations in Cuban and Porto Rican
waters.
If it is finally determined to form such
a squadron as indicated it is considered
highly probable that Commodore
Schley's immediate operations will be
directed p^ainst the Canary Islands,
and as soon as they are in his posses
sion they v. ill be an advantageous base
for operations against Spain.

FIRST REAL
BATTLE ON
CUBAN SOIL
Prolonged Fight in Which
Four Americans Are
Killed.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 12.â One of the Herald's
dispatch boats, which has reached Port Antonio, reports that
a fight has taken place at Guantanamo between the United
States marines and Spanish troops. The Spanish advanced
on the camp the marines had established on the crest of the
heights, through the thick tropical undergrowth. Sergeant
Smith, who was on the extreme outpost relieving the guard,
fell at the first fire. Some of the marines who were missing
have since been found. The outpost did not wait to attack
the Spanish, but retreated, and later the firing began, half a
mile to the right, in the woods. There was a short skirmish
and the Spaniards retired. Commander McCalla sent a de
tachment of the Marblehead's marines in a launch to assist
their comrades. Ensign Sullivan took the launch within a
few yards of the shore, hoping to draw the enemy's fire, but
by the time they arrived there were no signs of the Spaniards.
Nothing is definitely known of the strength of the Spanish
forces, but it is reported that there are 3000 troops in the vi
cinity of Caimanero and Guantanamo. Three hundred Cu
bans are expected to-morrow to occupy a point on the other
side of the bay from the camp of the marines.
ON BOARD the Associated Press
Dispatch boat Dauntless, off Guanta
namo, Sunday, June 12 (via M-ole St.
Nicholas June 12). â Lieutenant Colonel
R. W. Huntington's battalion of ma
rines, which landed from the transport
Panther oil Friday and encamped on the
hill guarding the abandoned cable sta
tion at the entrance to the outer har
bor of Guantanamo, has been engaged
in heading off a rush attack by Span
ish guerillas and regulars since 3
o'clock Saturday afternoon. The fight
ing was almost continuous for thir
teen hours, until 6 o'clock in the morn
ing, when re-enforcements were landed
from the Marblehead. Four of our men
were killed and one wounded. The ad
vance pickets under Lieutenants Neville
and Shaw are unaccounted for.
Among the killed is Assistant Sur
geon John Blair Gibbs, son of Major
Gibbs of the regular army, who fell in
the Custer massacre. His home was at
Richmond, Va., but he has been prac
ticing in New York and entered the
service since the war began. He was a
very popular officer. The others killed
are Sergeant Charles H. Smith of
Smallwood, Private William Dunphy of
Gloucester, Mass., and Private James
McColgan of Stoneham, Mass. Cor
poral Glass was accidentally wounded in
the head.
The Spanish loss is unknown, but it
was probably considerable. The
splashes of blood found at daylight at
the positions the Spanish occupied in
dicate fatalities, but their comrades car
ried off the killed and wounded.
The engagement began with desultory
firing at the pickets, a thousand yards
inland from the camp. Captain Spi
cer's company was doing guard duty
and was driven in, finally rallying on
the camp and repuising the enemy by
5 o'clock. The bodies of Privates Mc-
Colgan and Dunphy were found, both
shot in the head. The large cavities
made by the bullets, w r hich inside a
range of 500 yards have a rotary mo
tion, indicate that the victims were
killed at close range.
The bodies were stripped of shoes,
hats and cartridge belts and horribly
mutilated with machetes.
When they were brought in the whole
battalion formed three sides of a hol
low square aliout the camp on the hill
top. Below in the bay were the war
ships at anchor. Inland from the hill
camp is a deep ravine, and beyond this
are high hills. The adjacent country is

Colt machine gun in her bow, pushed
up the bay, enfilading the Spaniards,
and it is thought that some were killed
The marines trailed much blood to the
water's edge and there lost it. Sharks
are numerous in the vicinity.
The ships threw their searchlights
ashore, the powerful eyes sweeping the
deep tropical foliage and disclosing oc
casionally skulking parties of Spaniards.
It all represented a transformation scene
at the harbor.
Each discovery of the enemy was
greeted by the cracks of carbines
along the edge of the camp ridge or
by the long roll of the launch's machine
gun, searching the thickets with a
leaden stream.
Shortly after midnight came the
main attack. The Spaniards made a
gallant charge up the southwest slope,
but were met by repeated volleys from
the main body and broke before they
were one-third of the way up the hill;
but they came so close that at points
this was almost a hand-to-hand struK
gle. The officers nred x jtheir revolvers.
The Spaniards got through the open
formation to the edge of the camp.
Colonel Jose Campina, the Cuban
guide, discharged his revolver, and they,
turning and finding themselves without
support, ran helter skelter down the re
verse side of the hill.
It was during this assault that Assis
tant Surgeon Gibbs was killed. He was
shot in the head in front of his own
tent, the farthest point of attack. He
fell into the arms of Private Sullivan
and both dropped. The second bullet
threw dust in their faces. Surgeon
Gibbs lived ten minutes, but did not
regain consciousness.
The surgeons of the hospital corps
then moved their quarters to the
trenches about _the old Spanish stock
ade north of the camp. The attacks
were continued at intervals during the
rest of the night with firing by small
squads in various directions.
Toward morning the fire slackened.
Dawn is the favorable time for attack,
and as the east paled the marines lying
on their guns were .aroused. Some
were actually asleep, as they had had no
rest for forty-eight hours, and tired na
ture could no longer stand the strain.
But no attack came.
Three new two-pound field guns,
which could not be used during the
night for fear of hitting our own men,
fhelled several squads of Spaniards af
ter daylight. They dove into the
bushes like prairie dogs into burrows
as the shells broke over them in the
gray dawn. As the correspondent of
the Associated Press talked with Major
Ccckrell. who was in charge of the oi:t
posts, word came of the finding of the
body of Sergeant Smith. He was re
ported as having been killed at .5 o'clock
on ihe previous day, but it appears that
he li.-id been seen alive at io o'clock i:i
Ihe evening. When and how he was
killed no one knows at this wri*.ng.
Neither had the men been mustered out.
nor had the cutposts of Nevill aul
Shaw Veen relieved
Lieutenant Colonel Huntington and
Major Cockrell gave high praise to the
nerve and steadiness of officers and
men, especially the younger, as the en
gagement was a baptism of fire for a
large majority. The men were in dark
ness and in a strange land, but they
stood to their posts with courage and
fortitude and there were no symptoms
of a panic. The marines, though much
exhausted, were eager for more fight
ing, promising to inflict heavy punish
ment.
To-day the amplest precautions have
been taken, and, as the Dauntless was
leaving, re-enforcements were landing
from the Marblehead. A stormy time
was expected.
Estimates vary as to the attacking
force. Some say 200 and the others
run as high as 1000. Colonel Campina,
the Cuban guide, said the Spaniards |
were mostly irregulars, but the reports j
of the discharge of Mauser rifles would

indicate that they were reerulars, as
most of the guerrillas carry Remington
rifles.
The Cuban guerrillas, as a rule, have
more dash and courage than the regu
lars. The new campaign uniforms
prove satisfactory and are almost invis
ible at a distance of 200 yards.
The Lee guns caused several acci
dents on the drawing of cartridges. Cor
poral Glass shattered his hand.
Despite the loss of men, which is
keenly regretted, the marines rejoice
that they have been engaged in their
first fight on Cuban soil. They sailed
from New York the day war was de
clared. Since then till they landed on
the shore of Guantanamo Bay they
have been cooped up in the Panther
and they had begun to fear that the
troops would beat them after all.
SPLENDID ACHIEVEMENT
OF THE GOVERNMENT.
How an Immense Army Has Been
Created and Supplied Within
Six Weeks.
WASHINGTON, June 12.â Secretary
Alger to-day gave out for publication
a statement showing with exactness
Just what had been done by the W.ir
Department in preparing the army for
war. The report of the subsistence de
partment shows that it has, since May
14, or In less than a month, loaded
twelve solid miles of freight cars with
provisions for the army. This included
19,126,945 rations, or 32,180 tons for the
regular and volunteer troops.
Prior to April 21, In anticipation of
the present emergency, the department
had been accumulating small arms and
cartridges, and had about 20,000,000 of
all kinds. There have been procured
many millions more by manufacture
and purchase since April 21, and the
manufacture and delivery of small
arm cartridges will soon reach 700*000
a day. There have been issued to the
army small arms of all kinds and the
supply Is sufficient for anticipated
wants.
Since April 21, the old regular batter
ies have had their armament increased
from four guns and caissons to six guns
and caissons. The new regular batter
ies have been supplied with six guns
and caissons and their battery wagons
and forges. Sixteen volunteer batter- I
ies have been supplied either in whole |
or in part. The department has sent to
the field a large number of 5-lnch siege !
guns and 7-inch siege howitzers, with
their carriages, timber, platforms, im- j
plements, equipment, tools and chests ;
complete; also 7-inch mortars.
Smokeless powder is now being issued
for all field and siege guns. The sup- ;
ply of ammunition already ordered for I
field cannon is considered sufficient for
the present time. There have been |
shipped to the fortifications since j
April 21, many seacoast carriages, guns '
for which are already provided. Rapid j
fire guns and an ample supply of am- j
munition, cartridges, shells, shrapnel,
fuses and smokeless powder for the '
same have been purchased, and a por- i
tion has already been installed at the !
Government works.
There have been chartered without
seriously hampering the coastwise lines j
forty-one first-class steamships for the i
transports on the Atlantic coast, four
water vessels, one tug, three steam
lighters and one steamer for the signal
service. All of these had to be refitted
to a greater or less extent.
The Government has made most ac
ceptable contracts for coal at New Or
leans, Mobile, Tampa, Key West, Sa- j
vannah and Fernandina, and also coal
afloat to follow the transports to Cuba
and Porto Rico.
It has been most difficult to secure
ships on the Pacific Ocean, not be
cause of unwillingness of the steam
ship companies to give their ships, but
from the fact that they were not avail
able, for the reason that most of the
companies vTere trading across the Pa
cific and as far south as Panama, and
we could get the vessels when they ar
rived in port. In many instances these
companies have had to charter other
vessels to replace those it was neces
sary for the Government to have to
transact its business. American regis
try was required for a number of ships,
but there was no difficulty in getting all
the vessels necessary for transporting
troops to the Philippines.
Because of the long distance these
ships had to go some delays were
caused in fitting them out as transports.
So far ten vessels have been chartered.
The movement of troops to the ren
dezvous points was a vast undertaking.
The volunteer troops have gone to their
destination with promptness and with
remarkable freedom from accident or
delay. Altogether, the troops trans
ported, regular and volunteer, were 126
regiments of infantry, 34 regiments,
battalions of troops of cavalry and 20
batteries of artillery.
Some of the purchases by the
quartermaster's department include
8810 cavalry horses, 12,802 draft mules
2109 pack mules, 500 small mules, 1500
small horses, 4090 wagons, 425 ambu
lances, 17,052 single harnesses, 1500 sad
dles and bridles, 1497 pack saddles, 3100
halters, 1755 artillery horses and 544
draft horses for siege trains, 106 663
blankets, 123,128 blouses, 25,730 canvas
coats and trousers, 55,580 canton flannel

HOSPITAL TRAIN FOR
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.
Will Be Kept in Service During the
War and Is Expected to Be of
Incalculable Value.
NEW YORK, June 12.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: There
Will be a hospital train out of this city
in a few days that will eclipse anything
of the kind er befor% run. It will be
the first hospital train of this war, and
the most completely equipped of any
in the history of our country. It will
go on a southern railwa 1 ' to Tampa.
It will carry in addition to a specially
picked crew, twenty members of the
United States army hospital corps, who
| will act in the capacity of nurses, hos
i pital stewards, cooks and other attend
! ants of a modern hospital. It will be
! in command of llaior Richards, lately
on duty at Fort Munroe and Captain
Stiles, lately on duty at Fort Preble.
On its arrival at Tampa it will be used
as a stationary hospital for any sick
and wounded soldiers, sailors and ma
rines until it is deemed advisable to
carry them to some army hospital far
ther north. It will then be re-converted
into a moving hospital, and will act as
a transport for the sick. It will be
kept in service throughout the entire
war, and is ex-ected to be of incalcul
able value to the Government in carry
ing sick and wounded to the hospital
station at Fort McPherson, Ga., Chica
mauga or 1 ort Thomas, Ky.
PHILADELPHIA TO BE
SENT TO HONOLULU.
Will Hoist the Stars and Stripes Over

Vote for Annexation.
NEW YORK, June 12.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent* telegraphs:
Rear Admiral Miller, commander-in
chlef of the Pacific station, will hoist
the American flag over the Hawaiian
Islands as soon as Congress ratifies the
resolution of annexation which is now
being discussed in the House of Rep
resentatives. As soon as the cruiser
Philadelphia is placed In commission,
on July 1, she will become the flagship
of the Pacific squadron and will sail
for Honolulu. I understand that the
administration is determined to send a
modern man-of-war to Honolulu and
that the Mohican will be sent to the
far East to cruise among the Spanish
possessions which are not yet under
control of Rear Admiral Dewey and
seize them in the name of the United
States. ,

lieved that the billet lies between two
officersâ Captain i^ouis Kempff, now
captain of the Mare Island Navy Yard,
and Captain Silas W. Terry, command

NEW YORK, June., 12.1 2.â A Washlng

! now definitely settled that John Jacob
i Astor's battery will go to the Phillp

sent to Captain March last night. The
' battery will start immediately. It is
; expected it will embark from San Fran

ritf s troops, comprising the third ship
j ment, about June 23.
The horses and mules purchased by
Colonel Astor will not be sent to San

only a few horses with him as an ex
; periment. He believes the native horses
i to be more serviceable and less expen

Action of General

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL MILI
TARY PARK, Ga. f June 12.-A much
needed rain fell to-day, cooling the at
mosphere and laying the dust. The
men were relieved this morning from
any duties and hundreds were given
leave to visit the city, Lookout Moun
tain and the Ridge.
An incident occurred this morning at
the camp which will probably termi
nate the exist >nee of illicit whisky
shops and gambling dens, which have
up to this time been permitted to ply
their busiiu-ss by the Georgia authori
ties without hindrance. A private of
the Twenty-first Kansas Regiment,
who had been drinking at the whisky
dive of one Joy Baker uecame involved
in a difficulty with the barkeeper.
Blows followed, and Baker drew a re
volver, firing point blank at the soldier,
the bullet, it was claimed by the sol
dier, striking him near the left eye,
inflicting a. severe wound, which may
cause the loss of an eye. The name of
the soldier will be supplied soon.
The fight attracted the attention of
the throngs on the streets of the mush
room town and soon a crowd of soldiers
rushed in, Baker, fearing further
trouble, getting out of the way. A large
body of soldiers formed for the purpose
of avenging the injury to their com
rade, and for a while it looked as if
there would be serious trouble. An
armed guard, however, was quickly de
tailed by urder of General Brooke, who
took charge of Baker and his place, and
order was soon restored. The soldier
was taken to his division hospital,
where the surgeon investigated his in
juries. Ho found a wound as indicated,
but thought the injury had been
caused by a bit of broken glass and
not by a bullet.
After the shooting a number of sol
diers discovered the gambling den was
running a brace fame and that the dif
ficulty between the soldier and Baker
had resulted from the fact that the lat
ter had been playing the former with
loaded dice. It took the soldiers only
a few minutes to demolish the place.
They broke up the i... niture, scattered
the gambling mraphernalia in the
street and were only deterred from
pulling the house down by the arrival
of officers.
It is stated this evening that a num
ber of good citizens in the vicinity will,
because of the failure of the Georgia
officers to enforce the law, petition that
the portion of Walker County in the
vicinity of the park be put under mar
tial law, so that General Brooke can
administer the law on the lawless ele
ment now doing a thriving business
there.
Every train from the park this morn
ing- was crowded with soldiers who had
been given permission to visit the city
and the mountain. One of the trains
from the park was crowded to suffo
cation and a number of soldiers
mounted to the top of the coaches. At
a point about three miles from Chat
tanooga a number of telegraph wires
cross the track of the railroad over
which the soldier excursion train was
passing. When the train reached this
point C. H. Acmes and Thomas Bar
rett of the Fourteenth New York and
"Judd" Sharp of the Sixteenth Penn
sylvania were standing on top of a car.
Sharp was caught under the chin and
around the neck by one of the wires
and scragged off the car, pulling with
him Asmefl and Barrett, who attempt
ed to catch him. The men were picked
up, taken back to Lytle and placed in
the Leiter Hospital. They were badly
bruised and scratched, tut no bones
were broken and no internal injuries
were inflicted. All will doubtless re
cover.
BRITISH STEAMER LOST

ST. JOHNS, N. P., June 12.â The British
steamer Atbaria, Captain Smith, from St.

ashore in St. Marys Bay on Friday, is
a total wreck. The passengers and crew
are now on the way to this port.
The war ship whose presence off Cape

ANNEXATION IS
ALL ABSORBING
The Vexed Question Now
Up for Action.
UNCERTAINTY IN CONGRESS.
MISGIVINGS OF FRIENDS OF
THE SCHEME.
Great Difficulty of Maintaining a
Quorum in the Senate Owing
to the Activity of the
Opposition,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 12.â The first
days of the week in the Senate will be
devoted to miscellaneous matters on
the calendar, and the last days of it
to the Hawaiian question, if present
plans are pursued. The Hawaiian ques
tion ia attracting more attention than
any other matter now before Congress,
and upon its disposition largely de
pends the date of final adjournment of
the session. Senator Frye is deter
mined to get the House resolution up
in the Senate as soon as it passes the
House, and asserts his ability to hold
the Senate in session for a reasonable
time, or until the matter can be dis
posed of.
It is conceded on all hands that there
is a majority in the Senate favorable to
annexation, but some of those who are
friendly to this cause admit the diffi
culty of maintaining a quorum of its
friends, and expect the opponents of
annexation to refuse to assist them in
maintaining a working Senate.
Among other measures which there
will be an effort to have considered
during the week are the bill for the
incorporation of the International
Bank, Senator Pettigrew's bill regulat
ing the accounts of the public lands
and the quarantine bill. The con
ference committee report on the In
dian appropriation bill is likely to re
ceive attention, and it is understood
that if opportunity offers a portion of
the time will be devoted to the private
pension and House bills on the calen
dar. Senator Morgan hopes to have a
favorable report on the Nicaragua ca
nal bill to present to the Senate late in
the week.
The debate upon the Newlands reso
lutions, providing for the annexation of
Hawaii, will continue in the House
this week until Wednesday afternoon,
when at 5 o'clock a vote will be taken.
Meanwhile conference reports upon the
sundry civil, Indian and District of Co
lumbia appropriation bills may be pre
sented and considered, but owing to
the great tlesire to'speak upon Hawaii
these reports most likely will be de
layed until after Wednesday. The gen
eral deficiency bill is expected to be
taken up Thursday and will be dis
posed of quickly, .-vside from the quar
antine bill, there are no measures of
much importance likely to come up, be
yond appropriation bills.
PORTO RICO NEARING
STATE OF STARVATION.
The Government of the Islands Has
Established a Few Public
Kitchens.
ST. THOMAS, Danish West Indies,
June 12.â Walter Bett, who is said to
have been a secretary of Mr. Craw
ford, the British Consul at San Juan de
Porto Rico, the latter now acting for
the United States, arrived here yester
day. Mr. Bett was accused of commu
nicating information to the United
States cc-ncerning the mines and forti
fications of San Juan, and he was
therefore ordered to leave Porto Rico.
The Spanish claim that this is a flag
rant breach of British neutrality and
dangerous for Mr. Crawford, unless it
can be proved that the latter was not
the employer of Mr. Bett, and that the
expelled secretary is not answerable
for his actions to the British Govern
ment.
Mr. Bett denies having supplied the
United States authorities with the
information referred to. Thirty-one
Porto Ricans, mostly women, also ar
rived here yesterday. The newspapers
say that two months of the existing
conditions will bring Porto Rico to the
verge of starvation. The Government
of the islands has established a few
public kitchens for the relief of those
who are suffering most.
The Spanish torpedo-boat destroyer
Terror is now regarded as being use
less, owing to the break-down of her
boilers and the lack of means to repair
them. She is still at San Juan de Porto
Rico with the Alfonso XIII, Isabel I,
Ponce de Leon, Concha and Comachat.
At least they were all there when the
refugees left San Juan.

MASSACRED BY
THE "WAR BOYS"
One Thousand Persons Killed in *
the Recent Uprising in Sierra
Leone.
LIVERPOOL, June 12.â Steamers which have arrived here from
Sierra Leone report that 1000 persons were killed in the recent uprising
in that district. One hundred and twenty inhabitants of Free Town, most
of them traders, are known to have been massacred, and other colonists
were carried into the bush by the "war boys" and undoubtedly met a
worse fate. Three hundred friendly natives were killed. Besides the
white missionaries, six colored missionaries of the United Brethren of
Christ were murdered at Manohbargru. The English missionaries are
at the mercy of the "war boys," but have not been molested.

MOLE ST. NICHOLAS, Hayti, June
12. â The merchantman captured by the
auxiliary cruiser St. Louis just off
Morant Point, Jamaica, last Friday
night was the British steamship
Twickenham. On board the Twicken
ham is 3200 tons of coal for the Span
ish fleet. She has been sent as a prize
to Key West.
The captured collier is the London
steamship which went first to Marti
nique, expecting to effect a juncture
with Admiral Cervera's squadron at
that island. The fleet had departed be
fore her arrival and she was detained
there as a suspicious vessel by the
French authorities. Word was brought
to Admiral Sampson that the Twick
enham had left Martinique on Wednes
day. The St. Louis was detailed to in
tercept her.
Twenty miles out of Kingston on
Friday night the St. Louis fell in with
the Twickenham. The ex-liner showed
only the green and red lights of a mer
chantman and the collier kept right
ahead on her northwest course toward
Guantanamo, where she hoped to be
able to rind some means of getting her
coal to Admiral Cervera's ships in the
harbor of Santiago. Coming into close
range, the St. Louis surprised the col
ier by sending a solid shot across her
bow. The Twickenham, instead of
stopping, put on full steam and tried
to get away. Quickly overhauling the
Englishman, the St. Louis fired again.
The captain of the collier, seeing flight
impossible, hove to, and was boarded
by a boat's crew from the St. Louis.
The British captain at first made a
vigorous denial that the coal he was
carrying was for the Spanish fleet. His
vessel was searched, however, by men
from the St. Louis. In the fire-room a
man in overalls was found who spoke
only Spanish. After a vigorous cross
examination by Captain Goodrich of
the St. Louis, this man admitted he
was a Spanish officer in charge of the
cargo. On the approach of the St.
Louis he had thrown his papers and
commission overboard. He appeared
to be badly scared at the way things
had turned out. He was sent as a pris
oner of war to Key West on board the
captured steamship.
The St. Louis has recently been en
gaged in cutting cables around Cuba.
Lieutenant Allen said that when she
passed Guantanamo last night the
Stars and Stripes were still flying over
the marines on the hill. American
men-of-war were '--ing in the harbor,
but there had been no engagement yet
with the Spanish.
NEW YORK, June 12.â A Washing
ton special -to the Herald says: The
capture of the Twickenham makes the
second of the Spanish coaling ships
which has fallen into American hands.
The first captured was the Restormel,
seized by the St. Paul, while endeavor
ing to make a dash for the harbor of
Santiago de Cuba, in which Admiral
Cervera's fleet was lying. There is an
other collier named the Roath now at
Martinique, about which the authori
ties are suspicious, that will be seized
as a prize if possible. These three col
liers were laden with coal purchased by
the Spanish Government in Great
Britain before the Government issued
her proclamation of neutrality and
were sent to the Venezuela coast to
effect a junction with Admiral Cer
vera's squadron. They failed to meet
Admiral Cervera, however, and to this
failure was due Admiral Cervera's ac
tion in entering Santiago de Cuba,
where he is now locked up. As was done
in the case of the Restormel, the cargo
of the Twickenham will be condemned
on the ground that it is contraband of
war, but the crtier will be 1 released.
MERRIMAC INCIDENT
IS TROUBLING SPAIN
Pertinent Questions Put to the Gov-
ernment in the Chamber of
Deputies.
LONDON, June 12.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times telegraphing
Saturday says:
In the Chamber of Deputies to-day
Senor Osma, a highly respected Deputy,
questioned the Government, among
other matters, as to whether a block
ade can leglmately be made effective
by obstructing a port with sunken
snips, mines or torpedoes; whether it
is allowable for a belligerent in this
fashion to obstruct a port which is not
formally blockaded; whether an effec
tive blockade, once interrupted, must
be formally re-proclaimed; and whether
It is leglmate for a belligerent to em
ploy as allies semi-civilized natives liv
ing under the jurisdiction of an oppo
nent, especially when there is reason to
apprehend that the latter will commit
all manner of excesses now happily un
known in civilized warfare.
Duke Almodovar de Rio, the Foreign
Minister, in the course of a very guard
ed reply, expressed the opinion that an
interrupted blockade must be re-pro
claimed. He said the question as to
whether the blockade from Cardenas
to Bahia Honda was formally proclaim
ed has been submitted to the powers,
but they had not replied. America, he
said, was operating- against Santiago
apparently on the assumption that a
blockade of that port had never been
formally proclaimed.
Duke Almodovar said he would not
conceal his opinion that the blocking
of the entrance to Santiago harbor was
unjustifiable, .adding: that the use of
mines for such a purpose had been con
demned by such eminent authorities on
international law as Sir Richard Web
ster, the British Attorney-General, and
Dcs Jardines, the French jurist. With
reference to "exciting and aiding: bar
barians," the Foreign Minister was
careful to avoid accusations against
the Washington Government, but he
gave the Chamber clearly to under
stand that in his opinion a nation pro
fessing humanitarian sentiments would
certainly, by instigating rebellion
among a population capable of pillag
ing, devastating, violating and tortur
ing, incur a "tremendous moral re
sponsibility in the eyes of the civilized
world."
PREDICTS THE EARLY
FALL OF SANTIAGO.
London Times Says General Shafter
Will Not Encounter Serious
Difficulties.
LONDON, June 12.â Rear Admiral
Sampson's acquisition of a base for
coaling and supplies at Guantanamo is
universally recognized as practically
settling the fate of Santiago, although
it is believed the Spanish troops will
show fight if the city is captured. The
Times, in the course of an article re
viewing last week's operations, says:
"The Spanish garrison, we think,
does not exceed 10,000 men, who have
an immense position to hold, and are
lacking in supplies. Therefore General
Shafter's difficulties will be mainly
those of climate and movement, owing
to the absence of good roads.
"Admiral Cervera's proceedings have
proved that the Spanish ships find it
impossible to keep at sea, and if it be
true that the Minister of Marine ha 3
dismissed the capable Scotch engineers
in its service, the difficult Is fully ac
counted for. It was highly improbable
that Admiral Camara would attempt to
cross the Atlantic, but some fast
American cruisers may appear ere
long in Spanish waters."
'Speaking of the Philippines, the
Times says: "The surrender of Manila
appears inevitable within a fortnight.
In Spain's best interests it is hoped,
that when Manila and Santiago have
fallen she will recognize the necessity
of bringing to an end a contest unequal
from the first and rendered hopelessly
so by her total unpreparedness."
BLANCO FEELING THE
BLOCKADE'S EFFECTS.
Spain Taking Steps to Send Supplies
From Home and Foreign Ports
by Fast Vessels.
LONDON, June 12.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standp-rd. telegraph
ing Sunday, says: General Blanco, hav
ing again telegraphed that in case the
blockade becomes stricter it will be
urgent to send war stores, as his supply
is running short, the Government haÂ«
taken steps to dispatch abundant sup
plies by fast vessels from Spanish and
foreign ports. The more important
supplies from Spain will be strongly
convoyed and will be sent immediately.
General Blanco also telegraphed that
the authorities at Santiago de Cuba
claim to have repelled the American
attempt to land in the inner and outer
bays of Guantanamo. the Spanish
forces being intrenched in positions
commanding the best landing places
between Santiago and -uantanamo.
TWO HUNDRED REGULAR
SECOND LIEUTENANTS.
Honor Graduates From Leading Stata
Military Colleges Will Be Given
Appointments.
NEW YORK, June 12.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President Mc-
Kinley will send to the Senate during tha
week the nominations of 200 men for sec
ond lieutenants in the regular army. Al
though these appointments are to the
lowest grades in the commissioned force
of the army, the President has given
thorn more consideration than many of
the brigadier generalship class. The
pressure from politicians for these p'ace3
has been even greater than for higher
grades. In order to get the best military
talent without at the same time offending
his soldier friends, the President contem
plates the appointment of honor graduates
from the leading State military colleges.

YORK, first rate, off Santiago rle Cuba,
June 5, 189S.â Preparations will be made to
engage the batteries on Monday morn
ing, June 6, at 7 o'clock. Tne men should
be given their breakfast at 5:30 and trie
divisions should be ready to form at 8
o'clock. When the preparation signal
"18" is made, the ships will form south
of the Morro as follows:
The western column, heading north, the
Brooklyn, Marblehead, Texas and Massa
chusetts.
The eastern column heading north,, the
Now York, Yankee, New Orleans, Oregon
and lowa.
When the signal of execution "18" Is
made, the columns will move ahead. -
The commander of each division will
make such signals as may be necessary
-to bring his division Into the positions
marked on the accompanying drawing,
forming on the circles drawn at 3000
yards from the eastern and western bat
teries, one column heading in a north
westerly and the other in a northeasterly
direction. This will be best accomplished
by changing the direction of the columns,
the easterly column to the northeastward
and the westerly column to the north
westward, running In the directions until
south of the indicated positions, then
heading all vessels of the division north,
simultaneously turning again into the
column when the distance of 3000 yards
is reached. -
Vessels will be 400 yards apart and will
retain their positions, the westerly col
umn using the starboard battery and tho
easterly column the port batteries.
On the signal from the. commander-in
chlef both columns will open fire or fire
will be opened in case the enemy be
gins. .
Bearings will be taken carefully and dis
tances obtained with all practical ac
curacy.
The Dolphin will take a position to the
eastward ami the Suwanee and Vixen to
the westward, as shown on the plan for
the purpose of looking after any mus
ketry lire fom the shore.
The fire will be deliberate and continual
until the batteries are silenced or an or
der to cease firing has been made.
Very respectfully,
W. T. SAMPSON.
Rear Admiral U. S. N.,
Commander-ln-Chief U. S. Atlantic Sta
tion.
This order was carried out in most of
its details. The crew of the New York j
went to genera] quarters at 6:45. There
was some delay in petting the ships
into position. There was a light breeze
blowing and the sky was murky. At
<:20 while signaling to the ships to
close up waii in progress. Admiral
Sampson, leaning over the rail of the
forward bridge, asked Lieutenant Mar
ble in charge of the forward 8-inch tur
ret what he could see from the turret's
sight. The lieutenant replied:
"I can see yellow earth, but I cannot
see the guns yet, sir."
The New York went ahead slowly
followed closely by the Yankee and
New Orleans, the lowa and Oregon
some way behind, in a westerly direc
tion.
A small battery two miles west of
Morro Castle which the New York was
rapidly approaching seemed to be fir
ing with smokeless powder. The Dol
phin was signaled to come closer and
attend to this. At 7:30 o'clock a num
ber of puns could be seen sticking out
over the yellow emplacements on the
eastern battery, which is a quarter of
a mile from Morro. The ships went
right half turn until the New York's
port battery was brought to bear on
these emplacements.
At 7:45 the signal to commence fir
ing was hoisted, and a few seconds
later the i\ew York's big guns roared
out. On her starboard quarter the Yan

kee with her naval reserve crew and the
N"w Orleans followed suit. The fir
ms was rapid and fairly Rood. Great
clouds flew up on the hillside. The Ore
gon and lowa were still rather far out
while the New York was close in shore,
firing at a 4000 yard range. The west
erly column was almost out of sight
and apparently out of position, but It
was firing rapidly at the western bat
teries.
Smoke began to hang over the shore
and several times the firing was or
dered to stop until the smoke cleared
away. The men waited for the shriek
of the enemy's shells, but they were
seldom heard.
Out whore the lowa lay rising jets of
water occasionally showed where the
enemy's aim was directed. On the
starboard bow of the New York was a
small railroad trestle close to a little
battery. A freight train was seen gro
ins in the direction of Santiago de
Cuba. When it came to the eastern
end of the trestle it stopped, as if
afraid to cross. Then, with smoke
pouring from the engine. It flew across
the trestle and was lost to sight be
hind a cliff before a shot could reach It.
At 8 o'clock rain commenced to fall.
By this time Morro Hill, which is ISO
feet high, was being peppered badly
from the water's edge to where the
lighthouse stands at the top. Great
clouds of smoke and dust arose con
tinually and when shots hit the rockfl
sparks flew hack several hundred feet
in the sea. The rain came down heav
ily at 8:11 o'clock and the smokr- was
so thick It was impossible to tell the ef
fect of the shells and a general signal to
cease firing was hoisted. By this time
the enemy was almost silenced. A
few minutes later, with more delibera
tion, the attack was recommenced.
Commodore Schley's division at this
time and until the end of the bombard
ment could be seen but faintly. White
clouds arising on the western arm of
the harbor were the only sign that there
was another attacking force besides the
easterly column.
ThÂ« New York steamed closer, until
she was 2000 yards east of the batteries,
and a mile from the shore. in this po
sition most effective work was done,
three guns on the eastern battery be
ing dismounted.
The Naval Reserve* on the Yanke?
cheered vociferously every few minutes
as phots were seen to land.
The officers on deck were at this stage
of the engagement ripped out in their
southwestern and oilskins. The ad
miral Went below, reappeared in black
oilskins and tramped the forward
bridge. Captain Chadwick was outside
the conning- tower, just below the ad
miral. ,
An incessant fire was kept up by the
easterly column, then using its star
board batteries. The guns and build
ings adjoining Morro received awful
punishment. The Spanish flap flying
on Morro Castle was shot away, and
was quickly hoisted again.
At 9:45 a. m., when there was no
further response from the enemy, the
New York signaled "Cease firing," and
steamed â  away. The ; Yankee was I al
lowed to still batter away at the three
puns to the eastward, all that were left.
When the New York passed the New
Orleans, Captain Chadwick hailed her,
on the admiral's order, and shouted to
her through the megaphone to join the
Yankee and dismount the three guns
to the. right of Morro Castle. . Captain
Folper shouted \- back: â¢ "Aye, aye, sir.
We can do it."
The New Orleans' crew pave an en
thusiastic yell as they heard Captain
Folper's reply and followed this up
with three rinping cheers for the New
York. The fiapship's crew gave it back
with interest. Then the Oregon, which
was close by, followed the New Orleans'
example and cheered lustily. The New
York's crew did not seem to realize
that the Oregon had cheered them and
did not reply.
"Answer that cheer," shouted Cap

tain Chadwick, and a great yell went
up from the New York.
The navy regulations forbid cheer
ing, but regulations don't count for
much when the enemy's guns are si
lenced.
The New Orleans proceeded on her
errand, joined the Yankee and Dolphin
I and banged away merrily at the silent
guns. The New York steamed across
the mouth of the harbor to the west
erly of the column. One mortar bat
tery inside the harbor, which had not
been seen before, sent one or two
shells in the direction of the flagship,
but not dangerously close. The Brook
lyn, Texas, Massachusetts, Murblehead
and Vixen were still tiring. At 10:21
(not 1:21 as previously cabled) a gen
eral signal to cease firing was hoisted,
the smoke cleared away from the sides
of the ships and they resumed their
blockade stations. One of the officers
of the flagship was heard to remark:
"There is nothing more to fire at Just
now. We have silenced their fire effec
tively. What destruction was done by
our shells it Is impossible to tell. Ihe
defenses of Suntiago de Cuba cannot
be compared to those of San Juan de
Porto Rico."
The bombardment was little more
! than target practice. The enemy ap
parently deserted their guns soon after
the firing commenced, and had it not
been for the Merrlmac heroes, thought
to be in Mtrrro Castle, there would now
be little left of that picturesque pile.
The nif>n behaved splendidly through
! out. The bombardment of Santiago de
Cuba, although perhaps more effective
than the bombardment of San Juan de
Porto Rico, cannot be compared with
the cannonading of the latter. The
work done this morning should make it
easy for a land attack by the troops.
As at Matanzas and San Juan, the
smoke and the distance made it impos
sible to tell the exact damage done by
the shells. The firing at times was
short and wild, due to those causes.
At about noon, while the Dolphin was
lying close into a cove a few miles east
of Morro Castle, she commenced firing
on the shore, apparently at some troc-ps.
She kept this up for an hour or more.
The other ships lay quietly in their
usual positions and there was nothing
to indicate that a heavy bombardment
had been progressing a few hours be
fore. Later the Dolphin signaled that
she had disabled a carlo-ad of soldiers
and had knocked down a blockhouse.
During the bombardment, despite the
clouds of smoke, the twelve'inoh shells
of the lowa could be seen striking on
the base of the Estrella battery. The
thirteen-inch shells from the Massachu
setts and Oregon struck into the hills
near the batteries and threw up moun
tains of earth, even when they fell a
trifle short. The moral effect of the
terrible power must have been great,
for battery after battery was deserted
by the Spaniards. The Texas, with two
twelve-inch guns, and the lowa, with
her four big guns', raked the entire
hillside, while the Brooklyn and New
York poured in a heavy fire from de
structive eigHt and live-inch guns. The
Brooklyn headed lr further with her
squadron of fighters when the smoke
became too dense, and then, obtaining
a new range, the ships poured in a
deadly rain of eight-inch and five-Inch
i shells.
In the meantime the shells from a
little Spanish fort on the water front,
two miles off Morro Castle, opened on
the Suwanee and the Vixen, and they
moved in and with a hot fire from their
small guns soon silenced them.
The great earthworks on the hill near
the flying squadron's end of the line
then began putting shells in so close to
the Brooklyn and Massachusetts that
it was determined to silence them if
possible. It was a difficult job, because
the earthwork was ISO feet above the
water line and it required great eleva
tion of the guns.
After the first three-quarters of an
hour of firing Commodore Schley or

dered "cease firing" and the ships on
the west moved further In until they
has a good 1800 range. Eight min
utes later the command to open fire was
given and the guns began to crash
away.
Following the whistle of the eight
inch shell from the Brooklyn's after
turret, in charge of Lieutenant Russ,
there was a burst of fire from a block
house near this battery and a great
cheer from the men. Ten seconds later
the Massachusetts landed two ten-inch
shells almost in the same spot and
signaled that th^ battery was silenced.
Four big battleships were pounding
away at the Estrella battery and the
inside harbor defenses and the frightful
explosion of the great shells could be
seen causing terrible havoc. Down at
the eastern end of the line the New
York and New Orleans put the Cave
batteries out of action in fifteen min
utes and then devoted the fire of their
guns to the batteries on the hill, there
being two new masked batteries west
of Morro that were very nasty In their
fire. These were soon silenced.

APPEALS TO THE PRESS
FOR A BETTER NAVY.
Lord Beresford Thinks It Time Eng
land Discarded Muzzle-Load
ing Guns.
LONDON, June 12.â Rear Admiral
Lord Charles Beresford has issued an
appeal for an increase of the navy. He
says:
"The -war between the United States
and Spain has taught us useful lessons.
It has taught us the absolute necessity
of complete and thorough organization
previous to the war, instead of trusting
to chance. It has taught us the value
of a proper supply of cruisers and the
ineffectiveness of obsolete guns against
the range and accuracy of modern
weapons.
"No other nation has a ship on the
effective list armed with muzzle loading
guns, wheras England has forty-five.
Any nation that sent men to fight on
the blue water, or recommended for
harbor protection such weapons, wbuld
certainly, get short shrift."

INSULT LEADS
TO A KILLING
Affray On a Ranch in
Fresno County.
BLOODSHED AFTER A DANCE
MAN SLAIN AND A WOMAN
FATALLY WOUNDED.
George McCraney Takes the Life of
a Farm Employe Who At
tacked His Sister and
Himself.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, June 12. -As a result of a
quarrel at a dance given near Dos
Palos last night, George Kline, a young
farm hand, lies dead -with a Winches
ter ball uirough his body; George Mc-
Craney is in the County Jail in this
city, charged with murder, and his sis
ter, Mrs. William Mitchell, is danger
ously wounded. The shooting occurred
at about 7 o'clock this morning at the
home of William who lives
seven miles from Dos Palos.
The dance was given at the home of
James Sullivan, a farmer. McCraney,
Kline and Mrs. Mitchell were present.
It was an old fashioned country jollifi
cation and wine flowed freely. During
the evening Kline asked Mrs. Mitchell
GREAT BIG
Manly men are the pride of the entire country. The puny ones arÂ«
not respected. When men feel full of fire and life they look like men.
How do you look? It is necessary for continued manliness that there
should be no waste of vitality. But those who use their powers reck-
lessly find waste. The stomach which is abused is not as strong and
as vigorous as the one which is used sensibly. But for abused stom-
achs, for abused livers and for all of the organs of the body that
have been treated unfairly there is help. "Hudyan," the gTand
remedio-treatment of the Hudsonian Institute, stops waste in a
week. It makes manly men rapidly. Where there has been depletion
of any of the great powers in man, "Hudyan" steps in and assists
big nature to again reassert herself. It can be had by all who wish
to try it. Ask for absolutely free testimony regarding it. Ask the
great physicians at the institute for free advice on any question. If
you have a case of blood taint ask for free "30 day blood cure" circu-
lars. None of these helps to you costs a cent. Then why not have
them?

to dance with him, but she refused be
cause he had become intoxicated. That
nettled Kline, and he made an insult
ing remark, which McCraney resented.
McCraney and Kline exchanged warm
words at the dance, but postponed
their difficulty until this morning,
when they both went to the home of
Mr. Mitchell to settle the affair-
Mr, and Mrs. Mitchell were ta the
cook-house preparing breakfast when
McCraney and Kline entered. Kline
and McCraney renewed their quarrel,
and a fight followed. Kline, who was
still under the influence of the night's
debauch, drew a pistol and shot at
Mitchell. The latter dodgjed, and the
ball struck Mrs. Mitchell, entering thai
abdomen and inflicting an ugly wound,
which may prove fatal.
McCraney rushed out of' the house to
hitch a team to go after a doctor for
his sister. Kline followed him and waa
going toward the barn when MoCraneyV
turned and shot him with a Winches
ter. Kline dropped in his tracks. Al
blanket was thrown over him and hat
was allowed to lie in the barnyard!
until Dr. Long the Coroner from thia
city, shall have arrived. The Coroner
and Assistant District Attorney George
W. Jones left to-night for the scene of
the killing.
McCraney did not surrender himself,
but was placed under ar-est by Con
stable Martin Christian. The officer
asked for the rifle, but McCraney at
first said he did not know anything
about a rifle. Upon the officer insist
ing upon the surrender of the weapon
McCraney gave it up.
McCraney was brought to this city
and locked" in the County Jail. He was
morose and surly and refused to tallc
about the homicide.
Dr. Pardee of Dos Palos was sum
moned to attend Mrs. Mitchell and ha
located the bullet, which had pene
trated about six inches. The heat ia
very oppressive, and it is feared tha
woman will not recover. She is about
45 years of age and the mother of sev
eral children. Kline was about 35 years
old and unmarried. McCraney ia un
married.
The double shooting caused much ex
citement in Dos Palos, and McCranejr
was hurried to this city, although, tha
general opinion Is that his act was
justifiable.

THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
AMONG the good results gained by the sweep
ing Republican victory in Oregon that which
is of the greatest national importance is the
election of a Legislature which can be relied upon to
send to the United States Senate a Republican of
known fidelity to all the essential principles of the
party, including the maintenance of the gold stan
dard, y Â» â¢"
At the present time the Senate is tne weak point*
in our Government It is neither flesh, fowl, nor
good red herring. Neither party has a majority, and
as a consequence every important measure that comes
before it brings about a deadlock which can be
broken only by a compromise. It is this condition
of affairs that has delayed legislation on the cur
rency and compels us to enter upon a war without
settling that long discussed problem.
The most important political issue of the year,
therefore, is to change the comparative strength of
parties in the Senate and to assure Republican su
premacy in that body, so that all branches of the
Government will act in harmony for the adoption of
legislation necessary for the welfare of the country.
It is this that gives value to the election of a Repub
lican Legislature in Oregon. The gain of a gold
standard Senator from that State is a victory in which
the whole nation will share.
At the present time forty-four Senators are classed
as Republicans, but six of them â Carter of Montana,
Teller and Wolcott of Colorado, Pritchard of North
Carolina, Shoup of Idaho and Hansbrough of North
Dakota â are silver men and canot be counted on to
support the administration on measures affecting the
currency. To overcome their vote and obtain a gold
majority in the Senate it will be necessary to gain
eight Republican Senators to fill the vacancies to
occur on the 4th of next March. Since the victory
in Oregon there seems a fair chance, of doing this.
Among the Senators who retire next March are
eleven Republicans, two silver Republicans, fifteen
Democrats and two Populists. Of the retiring Repub
licans the only seats that are at all doubtful are those
of Wilson and Clark of Wyoming. The party will
gain seats from the Democrats in Maryland, where
a Republican has been already elected to succeed Gor
man, and in New York, where the successor to
Murphy is sure to be a Republican. Another has now
been gained in Oregon. In addition to these the
Republicans have good prospects of winning the
seats now held by White of this State, Turpie of In
diana, Mitchell of Wisconsin and Smith of New Jer
sey. They have also a fighting chance for the seats
of Gray of Delaware, Roach of North Dakota and
Faulkner of West Virginia.
The outlook for a safa Republican majority of
sound money men in the next Congress is therefore
promising. In every State, however, where a Senator
I* to be chosen by the Legislature elected this year
the Republicans must be alert and watchful. The
margin of victory will be too narrow even under the
best of probable circumstances for the Republicans
of any State to take chances. If we are to have cur
rency reform thorough and complete without disas
trous compromises we must have a good working
Republican majority in the Senate, and to accomplish
that there must be this year something like the tidal
wave victory of iÃq6, sweeping the Union and carry-
Ing every doubtful State.
THE YUBA-MfIRYSVILLE TRANSMIS
SION.
THE current number of the Journal of Elec
tricity gives the place of honor in its pages to |
an elaborate description, richly illustrated, of the
electric power transmission system recently estab
lished by the Yuba Power Company at Marysville. |
The article is a noteworthy one and presents in a j
striking way one of the most important of the accora- j
plishments of Californian enterprise.
It is noted that just 125 days elapsed from the
date when the power company began work on the I
system until it was placed in operation. The work !
achieved during* that comparatively short time in
cluded the entire rebuilding of thirty odd miles of
water system, the location of the power-house, the
erection of the pole line with two sub-stations, the :
city distribution of over 5000 lights and the installa- i
tion of all the hydraulic and electrical equipments of j
the plant. With this record the company holds the
well merited distinction of having made the quickest j
installation of that magnitude ever accomplished.
The plant, moreover, is as notable for its excellence \
as for the speed with which it was built. Rapidly as j
the work was performed, thoroughness and quality
were never subordinated for the sake of gaining |
time. The system stands, therefore, as one of the best j
illustrations in the world of what American science
and engineering skill can do in the way of providing j
for the transmission of electrical energy.
The example set in this case will of course be fol
lowed elsewhere. The topography of California is
well adapted for such enterprises, and the date can
hardly be far distant when nearly every city of note
in the State will have power furnished it on lines sim
ilar to that which is now proving such a benefit to
Marysville.
OFFICERS FOR THE VOLUNTEER
ORMY.
CAPTAIN JAMES A. PARKER, U. S. A., be
gins an article in the current number of the
North American Review on "The Officering
and Arming of Volunteers" with the statement:
"1 he most important detail perhaps in connection
with the organization of our volunteer troops is the
development, selection and appointment of their
officers."
To this statement there is hardly likely to be any
objection. Strength, courage and patriotism furnish
a sufficient basis for the rank and file of an army if the
men are well led. The duties of a private are rapidly
learned where the mind is quick and the heart willing.
The officer of an army in modern warfare, however,
requires something more than these ordinary quali
ties of young manhood. There is needed a special
training to fit him for the performance of the complex
responsibilities resting upon him, and if he lacks that
training his whole command suffers and the evil is
far-reaching.
The situation of the United States Is such that the
maintenance of a large standing army at all times
would be an economic blunder. Our wars are infre
quent and we are never in immediate danger of inva
sion. We will in the future, as in the past, rely upon
volunteers raised when war begins to fight our battles
for us, and it is, therefore, imperative that we should
arrange some means of providing them with officers
fitted to command them to advantage, to hold their
confidence and to make the best use of them in every
emergency.
Captain Parker suggests three sources from which
we can obtain trained officers for as large a volunteer
army as we are ever likely to need. These sources
are the military academy, the regular army and the
National Guard. As at present constituted neither of
these, nor all of them combined, suffice the demand
for officers. Further development is needed in all of
them, and the most interesting portions of Captain
Parker's article are those containing suggestions of
the means by which that development can be ob
tained.
According to the captain the graduate of the Mil
itary Academy makes the best officer, and he proposes
the establishment of two such academies in addition
to the one at West Ppint, so that the number of cadets
; could be increased from 371, now authorized by law,
to 2200. This proposition is not wholly new. Some
I years ago a movement was made in Congress to ma
terially increase the number of cadets and to establish
a military academy somewhere in the West to relieve
the strain on West Point Nothing came of the pro
ject at the time, but it is more than likely it may be
taken up again. Certainly a military academy on the
Pacific Coast as near to San Francisco as West Point
is to New York would not be a bad enterprise on the
part of the Government.
The suggestions as to the expediency of obtaining
volunteer officers from the regular army are capable
of being carried out at once, and therefore are of more
practical value than that regarding the increase of mil
itary academies. A large proportion of the non
commissioned officers of the regulars are highly in
telligent men and have during their service received
a thorough military training. By encouraging these
men to further military studies and by subjecting them
to a practical and theoretical examination it would
be possible for the War Department to form a corps
from which efficient officers for volunteer troops
could be drawn whenever the emergency required.
To make the National Guard a reliable school for
officers would require many changes in the present
system. In some of the States the changes would
amount to a virtual revolution. They could be ef
fected only by complete supervision on the part of the
War Department, and a willingness on the part of the
States to co-operate. The three sources combined,
however, would certainly furnish all the officers we
need and would enable us if necessary to put half a
million men in the field under leadership capable of
handling them.
ON AN EVEN KEEL.
T"RADE was rather tame last week. The volume
of business showed no falling off, and indeed
the increase in the bank clearings of 31.2 per
cent over the same week in 1897 pointed to a steady
maintenance of the good pace set at the beginning
of the year. But trade may be good and still be fea
tureless, and that condition now prevails.
In the first place there is no more uncertainty. The
only fleet which Spain possesses capable of inflicting
injury upon the United States or retarding its aggres
sive operations against the Spanish insular posses
sions is in a bottle down in the Antilles and Sampson
is sitting on the cork. We are practically in full control
of the Philippines, and Santiago de Cuba is at our
mercy. Spain is hors de combat and can do us no
harm. Hence the fire is taken out of any speculation
which may have depended on the war as its raison
d'etre.
In the second place the commercial atmosphere is
clear. The season has advanced to that point where
the condition of the crops is pretty definitely known.
The preliminary' orders for the army have been filled
as a rule, and future orders will be filled more leis
urely. Those articles of merchandise affected by the
outbreak of hostilities have found their new level and
have ceased to fluctuate, and the movement of prod
uce, groceries and manufactured goods is now regu
lated by the ordinary laws of supply and demand. In
other words, trade is going along smoothly in its
usual rut.
The failures throughout the country last week were
203, against 262 for the same week last year. The
shipments of wheat from the Atlantic coast were
4,730,900 bushels, against 1,080,000 in the same week
in 1897, and of corn 4,774,000 bushels, against 2,398,
000. While the volume of business in the iron trade
shows a falling off from the past few weeks, it is still
far ahead of the same time in 1897, and the Western
mills are still crowded with orders. The woolen man
ufacturers have ceased to buy wool, but they cannot
complain, for they have lately been doing a rushing
business on Government account. Railroad bonds
continue to advance, with a brisk demand for the bet
ter class, while Government bonds have been weak
ened by the prospects of a new issue. The continued
ease of the monqy market gives a bullish cast to Wall
street, but the public still hold aloof, and the market
remains largely in the hands of the professional ma
nipulators. The railroad earnings continue very
large, and the distributive trade of the whole country
is first class.
The above points cover the state of trade through
out the nation. The California markets are equally
humdrum. We too know what to expect from the
current harvest and can pretty well forecast prices
within a reasonable margin. The ge.ieral tone of the
market is one of firmness. Provisions continue to
sell well at strong quotations. Beef and pork meet
with a steady demand, and the latter is excited at a
marked advance. Quotations for the spring clip of
wool, so long delayed, have at last been established,
though there is nothing doing. Hides have again
gone up and are meeting with a steady consumptive
demand. The dried fruit market is well cleaned up
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 13, 1898.
of the 1897 crop, and the new output is expected to
bring good prices. The canners are bidding higher
prices for fresh fruits than for some years, and their
stocks, too, have run short under a lively inquiry for
Eastern and English account The grain and feed
markets have declined steadily for several weeks, in
sympathy with the depreciation in wheat, the hay
market being the only exception. The light crop
keeps that steady at high prices. The local money
market is very easy and abundantly supplied, and
solvent borrowers find no difficulty in filling their
needs at the usual rates of interest. From present in
dications the new crop year will be as brilliant as ex
pected, and there is nothing in sight to indicate any
disturbance in trade conditions for some time to
come.
A TRIUMPH FOR THE FAKER.
BY an oversight or a negligence almost unpar
donable the Associated Press has permitted it
self to be made the dupe of the New York Jour
nal and has sent out through the country to all the
newspapers in its membership, as an item of war news,
one of the worst fakes and lowest lies that ever eman
ated from yellow journalism. The main offender is
of- course the lying Hearst organ that originated
the fraud, but the Associated Press is in a certain
sense responsible, since it sent the fraud broadcast
among its correspondents without giving warning
that the alleged news had been taken from the
Journal.
The item of itself was of no importance, and was
interesting solely because it purported to be a record
of an incident of the war in the West Indies. As such
it was accepted from the Associated Press by legiti
mate newspapers in all parts of the Union, and was
published to the world as a genuine piece of infor
mation concerning a subject in which every Ameri
can is intensely interested. It turns out to have been
a lie concocted in the Journal office at the instigation
of Hearst It was not news. It was a fake, and a
fake so vile that the Journal and its vermiform ap
pendix in this city, the Examiner, are now boasting of
it as a triumph over the decent newspapers of the
country.
There is no disputing the fact that in a certain
sense the dissemination of the lying fake through the
Associated Press was a triumph for Hearst It caused
legitimate newspapers to publish as news one of the
most fraudulent stories ever concocted by any of the
Hearstling gang. It is not to be wondered, therefore,
that the Examiner is now boasting of the feat and
pointing to the item as a proof that other newspapers
publish fakes as well as itself. The faker has man
aged to cheat the public not only through its own
columns, as usual, but through the columns of other
papers, and is more exultant and noisy over the
success of its lie than ever it was over a scoop inter
view with the Emperor of China or the Pope of
Rome.
If the Hearstling tricksters can work such schemes
as this upon the Associated Press it will not be long
before the dispatches of the association will be them
selves as much discredited as those of the Examiner
and the Journal. Both of those yellow sheets
are members of the association, and it is clear
they are perfectly willing to disgrace and de
grade it to their own level. It therefore be
hooves the New York representatives of the
association to keep a watch on the tricks of the
Hearstlings, so that they may not be duped again
as they have been in this instance.
The faker has as much right to rejoice in his suc
cess in foisting a lie upon the Associated Press as a
gold brick swindler has to be merry over the decep
tion of a man who should have had sense enough to
know better. The representatives of the Associated
Press in New York know what the Journal is,
what the Examiner is and what Hearst is. They are,
therefore, to be blamed for accepting any news
from such sources. Nothing but frauds, fakes and
lies ever originate from any of that gang. Genuine
news they never have. Hereafter when the Asso
ciated Press sends out items furnished by the Journal
or Examiner it owes it to the decent newspapers of
the association to give warning, "This is from a
Hearstling."
PREPARE FOR FLOG DAY.
ONE hundred and twenty-one years ago to
morrow our fathers, having declared the Amer
ican colonies of those days to be "free and
independent States," adopted the banner of the stars
and stripes as the symbol of their independence, the
emblem of their union and the ensign under which
their joint armies should fight for freedom and the
making of the nation.
Since that time the Federal Union has become a
National Union. It is now simply as a grammatical
form that we say the United States are rather than the
United States is. The nation is one and indivisable.
The rays from the many stars of its flag so closely
blend with one another that the light their shining
sends to every land and every sea under the expanse
of heaven gleams on the eyes of men as the luminous
glow of a mighty sun rather than the commingled
radiance of a galaxy of separate stars.
We are now having for the first time a war in which
we are fighting as a thoroughly united people and a
consolidated nation. The flag means more to-day at
home and abroad than it ever meant before. There
are no sections, no classes, no parties in our own land
who regard it with aversion or even indifference. There
is no nation or people anywhere in the world who
are ignorant of the power it symbolizes or doubtful
of its high destiny among the banners that float over
the earth.
It is most appropriate in every way that at this time
we should give some public manifestation of the zeal
and loyalty with which the banner is now loved in
every home in the wide nation. There needs no for
mal ceremony for this. In fact it is preferable the
celebration of the flag should be made by individual
citizens as an expression of personal patriotism rather
than by civil display or military parades. To-mor
row is the anniversary. Let every citizen and, every
home not already possessed of a flag procure one to
day. When to-morrow's sun shines upon us it should
have its beams reflected back from the broad stripes
and bright stars of the banner of the nation streaming
from every home and housetop and spire and pinnacle
in the city.
There is an end to the fervent hope that the war
had scared Debs off the earth. He is engaged in
his familiar act of forming a new party. He will have
no trouble in running it, either, for it will be com
posed of Debs, and can't help being unanimous.
Announcement is made that a lawyer of this city
has married a variety theater girl after an acquaintance
of two hours. The strange part of the affair is that
there seems to be a tendency to extend congratula
tions.
Not a word can be heard in favor of Schwerin of
the Pacific Mail, but if the Chinese he employs in
preference to white men were to be consulted perhaps
they would be found to feel differently.
EDITORIAL VIEWS OF THE WAR.
IT IS now more than thirty years since our civil conflict â one of the
greatest wars the world has knownâ was ended. But there still remain
among the officers of the regular army nearly 300 men who can never
forget ti.e lessons they learned In that hard school of experience.
Among the :-ien who carry the guns, of course, there are few veterans
of the Civil "War, though here and there some stalwart sergeant still re
mains who can speak of its battles as one who has nved through them.
But of the commissioned men â with the exception of the staff â there is
hardly a field officer who did not see war service, and most of them served
from its outbreak until Appomattox.
Compare the stern school these men attended with the limited training
their opposing commanders have received! Except the small amount of
fighting with the Carlists in Spain, the Spanish officers have taken part in
no war more worthy the name than the kind of skirmishing they have
undergone in Cuba. â Boston Globe.
FILL UP THE REGIMENTS.
During the last can of the Civil War the generals In the field were
urgent that new regimental organizations should not be formed, but that
whatever men were raised should be sent to fill the ranks of veteran regi
ments which had been reduced In strength. They were right, because a
thousand recruits, distributed among old regiments, become good soldiers
In half the time they do when put by themselves In one regiment,
suggestion made by the War Department should not be Ignored,
weaker regiments and corpanies should be recruited up to the limit. The
present volunteer regiments are made up to a large extent of militia
organizations which have had considerable military instruction. New men
put into those rganizations will make much more rapid progress than ir
they are put in a regiment by themselves. The L nion armies would nave
been more efficient toward the close of the war if the wishes of the war
Department and the commanding generals had been heeded, and there
had been fewer skeleton organizations and more strong regiments, me
lesson taught then should not be forgotten-â Chicago Tribune.
OUR FUTURE FLEET.
If during the last two decades the energy expended upon building up
the American navy had been trebled, the war would now exist but In
name. Every Gpanish fortification would have been destroyed and the
garrisons on the islands Â«* Cuba, Porto Rico and Luzon would be prisoners
or at the Immediate mercy of our forces. Three times our present fleet
would still be far below the strength corresponding to the country's need;
but it would have been enough to enable the army, small as it was at the
beginning, to capture any town desired, and, at the same time, to provide
against any foolhardy or theatrical movement by the ships of Spain. Such
a campaign could have been carried on, moreover, without overstepping the
Dnes which caution and prudence have hitherto pursued resolutely, avoid
ing so much as a reasonable risk of serious damage to us, except, of course,
in the case of the brilliant performance at Manila. And three times the
present fleet would have cost less than the prolongation of the war which
ft would have prevented.
Regret for past error becomes of the highest value If it leads to Detter
things In the future.â New York Sun.
THE FAMOUS LEES.
It would be strange Indeed if a national emergency lacked the leadership
of a Lee. When we were feeble colonies on the edge of the Atlantic the
Lees grew with us. One joined in oar Declaration of Independence; the
flashing sword of another blazed in the front of our cavalry during the Rev
olution; a Lee showed the way in Europe for American diplomacy. A Lee
helped to open the gates of Mexico, and with tears, saw his duty as we did
In '61, and taught us how to serve our country after Appomattox. A new
national need has arisen, and a Lee is here. Welcome to him, for his own
Bake, for that of his ancestors, for the service he will render and the lesson
he teaches us even now. The South was called upon to give her best, and
we send our boys, our veterans to lead them and our loyal service. Welcome
to Lee, the soldier of the nation, and let no man doubt the South or the record
she will make. The fields of Cuba shall be as glorious to us as all the others,
on which we have stood, and Spain will be beaten as others have been be
fore.âFlorida Times-Union.
GOD BLESS OUR BOYS
Thirty-seven years ago to a day the soldiers of Virginia were marching
out to war, and there are many living in Richmond who recall those stirring
times. But as bitter as the anguish was no one realized what a terrible
struggle was on and how many long and weary years it would be before it
would end. There was no prophet in Richmond to foretell that before the
end should come our own fair city would be overrun by the enemy and laid
waste by flre and sword. Again a regiment of Virginia soldiers is marching
forth to the war. But instead of that precious old uniform of gray the boys
are wearing the blue and are marching under the stars and stripes. It Is
not this time a battle of brother against brother, but the soldiers of the na
tion are united against a foreign foe. God bless and protect those Virginia
boys, and bring them back in health and vigor and triumph to their loved
ones. â Richmond Times. â¢ Â«
BOOM IN NAVAL CONSTRUCTION.
"Whether our shipyards have little or much to do in the way of building:
merchant steamers, while the war lasts they are going to have plenty to do
In the warship branch of their business. The last naval bill authorized the
building of three new battleships, four monitors for harbor defense, sixteen
torpedo-boat destroyers and twelve swift torpedo boats, a total of thirty-five
vessels. The Navy Department has already completed the designs and spec
ifications for these vessels, and is ready to invite bids for their construc
tion. As soon as the legal formalities can be complied with, contracts will
be awarded, and the shipbuilders who get the contracts will have lots to do,
whatever may happen. While there is no probabilty that any of these ves
sels will be completed in time to take part in the existing war, Congress has,
very properly, authorized their construction. The country is getting its
eyes opened, as a result of the present war, to the fact that we are totally
unprepared for war with any Important naval power, and that it will not be
safe to take any such chances in future. We shall probably be able to
whip Spain, because It is a weak power, as ill-prepared for war as ourselves;
but if our quarrel had been with England, France, Germany or Russia, we
should have been overwhelmed before we were ready to fight. It Is hoped
that we shall never be at war with any of these powers, but the best way to
Insure perpetual peace is to be prepared to defend ourselves, come what
may. â Philadelphia Times.
MILITARY POSTAL SERVICE
There was a good deal of complaint about the postofflce facilities at
Chickamauga Park until the Government took the matter in hand and re
organized the service on the military plan. There is no reason why the
postal service of the army should not be as perfect as the service in Chi
cago. The experience of the civil war is before the postal authorities. In
1861 the soldiers from the very first received their letters promptly. The
Government began at the beginning, and established a military postal sys
tem. This was probably as perfect as anything of the kind ever organized.
Before the war closed the syslem was as responsive to the isolated compa
nies and brigades as to the main body of the army. A letter that gave the
name of the soldier and his regiment reached him whether he was in front,
in the hospital, or on detached duty, or on a raid. The same completeness
and responsiveness should be given to the army postal service now. Letters
addressed to companies and regiments should reach them whether the name
of any postofflce is given or not. While the regulars were at Chickamauga
the mail was promptly handled on the regimental plan, and not much at
tention was given to the local postofÃce, but now that the volunteers are
at Chickamauga Park such changes should be made as will take the letters
promptly to regimental headquarters.â Chicago Inter Ocean.
PROWESS OF AMERICANS.
What American has not with swelling pride observed the exhibitions of
true bravery that have been made by their marines in the few minor en
gagements so far brought on in the war with Spain? The old-time traditions
concerning the valor and courage of the Yankee warrior at sea have been
handsomely and splendidly Illustrated anew by the acts of flarmg performed
by the navy of to-day, and quite naturally does it make the heart of the
young and the old beat fast from the quickening influence of enthusiasm
and prompt every patriotic citizen to look for an overwhelming victory in
the end, despite the repeated cautions to abstain from underrating the fieht
Ing qualities of the adversary. The very fact that we are not by nature or
training a warlike people, and jet are capable on sufficient provocation of
demonstrating our remarkable adaptability for the roles of soldiers arid
naval seamen, Is what tends to make us so confident of our own prowess
In that respect. Americans are the best soldiers in the world, said a r
military authority not long since, and his assertion is borne out by the reo
ords of every war in which we have been involved, from the early days nf
the colonial scrimmages with redskinned opponents, through the French anH
Indian wars down to the present struggle with a decayed monarchy â

STATUS OF PRISONERS.
The Oxford rules contain provisions for the employment of prisoners of
war. The enemy may employ their labor upon public works that are not
directly connected with military operations, if the labor is not detrimenta
to health. The rules declare, however, that the confinement of war prison
era is not in any sense a penalty for crime, nor "an act of vengeance "
They may be confined in towns, fortresses and camps, or elsewhere md
may not pass i eyond certain boundaries, "but they may only be imnHÂ«*
oned as an indispensible measure of security." A prisoner of war iÂ«
defined in the American instructions for the government of the armip* in
the field as a "public enemy armed or attached to the hostile army fnr
actual aid. who has fallen into the hands of the captor, either fiehtine- Z
wounded, on the field or in the hospital, by individual surrender nt hv
capitulation; and citizens who accompany an army for whatever nurnnsJ
such as sutlers, editors or reporters of journals, or contractor"? if can
tured, may be made prisoners of war and be detained as such "â Philarlal
phia Ledger.
A TRIAL OF PATIENCE
This war is going to be a trial of national patience and we must make
the best of it. Probably it will not be a trial in any other way. We are
attacking an enemy, brave but feeble, who cannot fight and will not sur
render. So far Spain has neither struck a blow nor yielded a point. Her
men die, her ships sink, her forts are bombarded, her harbors blockaded.
Nothing can rouse her to vigorous resistance or cow her to make terms to
avert destruction. Nothing remains but to destroy her power in the West
and East, to push her desperate but feeble forces out of her ruined colonies
inch by inch, to deal with her as civilized nations have to deal with sav
age races who will neither accept civilization nor make way for it. It ia
our problem with the Sioux, England's with the Zulus and Spain's own
with the Intractable natives of Chile; the only place in America where she
encountered real resistance and the only jlace where her colonies have
founded a Btrong nation. â New York Commercial Advertiser.

returned from a trip to Eureka, Hum
boldt County, which was fruitful of many
ludicrous situations for both parties.
Bachman's experience as a sailor of the

to him under the circumstances a very

berth at once, knowing full well that
there was no relief for him unless the
steward brought him a continent or an
island. For twelve hours he lay, suffer
ing great tortures. Death or any other
relief was begged of the Power above.
When this exquisite torture was at Its
apex Bachman thought he would crawl
on deck and battle with his misery in the
face of heaven. By dint of determination
and repeated efforts he at last found him
self in a protected spot which did not
oscillate and dip to the abnormal manner
the rest of the ship took In its eccentric
movements. A feeling of solitariness
came ovef him and he began to think that
he was the only passenger who had sur
vived. The clouds obscured what little
light a setting sun cast upon the rocking
and toiling plodder of the sea, and the
world for Bachroan was about to be left
in complete darkness, when he noticed a
wraith-like form approaching him. With
the little strength he had left he roused
himself, and after much painful gazing
recognized his friend, Hillyer. All ho
conld say was: "What, ara you alive
too?" *

GENERAL MacARTHUR HERE.
Last of t^e Brigadiers for Manila.
Arthur Mac Arthur, the last of the brigadier generals of volunteers ordered
to report to General Merritt at SÂ«m "Francisco for the Manila expedition, reached
San Francisco Saturday night.
General MaeArthur comes direct from Tampa and Chirkamauga, where he
assisted in the mobilization of two armies. He has until recently filled a position
in the adjutant general's department with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and it
was In that capacity that he served at Chickamauga and Tampa.
General Mac Arthur has a distinguished record. He served through the war
ut tin.- rebellion, rising from first lieutenant and adjutant of Wisconsin Volun
.to the brevet rank of colonel of volunteers. He was made lirst lieutenant
of the Seventeenth Infantry shortly after the close of the war, subsequently
serving with the same rank in the Twenty-Sixth Infantry, and as captain in the
Thirty-sixth and Thirteenth Infantry. He was appointed major and assigned to
the adjutant general's department In 1889, and has since continued in that branch
of the service up to the present time.

THE FRENCH ALLIANCE.
Interesting Entertainment, the
Feature of Which Was the
Distribution of Prizes.
The San Francisco branch of the French
Alliance of Paris gave an interesting en
tertainment in Union-square Hall on
Post street yesterday afternoon. The
hall was handsomely decorated with the
American and French national colors and
a rich variety of flowers. The auditorium
was BHed with an assembly of intelligent
and refined French people, together with
quite a number of American-born citizens.
The French Alliance is an association for
the propagation of the French language
in the colonies of France, as well as in
countries foreign to that nation. It was
organized in ISB3, and now has more than
Gu.uOO members. Its usefulness was ac
knowledged by a decree of the President
of the French republic in ISS6.
The programme yesterday afternoon
opined with an overture, "La Jolie Men
nlere," by the Megissiere band, composed
ot workingmen from the Legallet Tan
ning Works, after which J. Lambla, presi
dent of the local alliance, delivered a brief
address, in which ho demonstrated the
usefulness of the French language on ac
count of its universality. Incidentally he
thanked the Board of Education for al
lowing the alliance the free use of rooms
in the public schoolhouses for giving in
struction in the French language, among
the pupils being many Americans.
P. Antoine, chancellor of the French
consulate, presented to Secretary Bous
quet a beautiful silver medal in the name
of the French Alliance of Paris, the re
cipient in response saying that he would
use his utmost endeavors to promote the
Interests of the society.
Then came the award of the prizes for
excellence in the French language. The
first prize, from E. Rothchild. a Paris
editor, was given to Miss Fanny de Bonn;
the second, from the French Consul, L. de
Lulande, to Albert Lapachet, and the
third from J. Lambla, president of the
local alliance, to Rosalie Boyer. The
above prizes were open to the pupils of all
the public schools, and the award was the
result of a general competition. There
prizes awarded to fifty other pupils
for reading, grammar and translation.
The programme was concluded with a
piano selection, an air de ballet, "Pier
rot te," by Miss Fannie de. Bonn; a fan
talsie, "La Serenade Francaise." by the
Meglsslere orchestra; a monologue, "Mon
sieur de la Palisse," by Miss . Marie
Cabannot; a chansonette comique, "Les
Chiffoniers." by Paul Girard, and the
American national hymn by the Megis-
Eiere orchestra.

STRUCK BY A SENTRY.
Police Officer Feld Clubbed
Over the. Head With a Gun
by a Colorado Guard.
Police Officer Joseph Feld, of the O'Far
j rell-street station, as a result of an alter
cation yesterday with one of the sentries
of the First Colorado Regiment, is now
laid up with a bad scalp wound. The
police officer visited Camp Merritt yes
terday, and according to the statement
I of the officer of the guard, Feld was on
' the sentry"s beat and was told to move
' on. He showed no inclination to obey
the sentry's warning, and, it is said, he
i asserted that he would move when he \
got good and ready, whereupon the sen
try endeavored to shove him from the
sidewalk, and the officer made an effort
to seize the soldier's gun, but before he i
could do so, it was brought down by the
sentinel across his head and . he was
knocked unconscious. Fold was taken to
the regimental hospital and his wound
dressed.
The officer stated that he was not inter
fering with the sentinel in any way, ana
that he was simply passing by the camp
when the soldier shoved his bayonet in
his face and ordered him to get out.
Feld, according to his statement, merely
caught hold of the eun and pushed it
away from his face, when without any
further provocation the sentinel struck
him. The officer declares that ho was in
no way offending.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 13, 1898.
BRIGADES REORGANIZED.
Major - General Otis Assigns King and
MacArihur to Commands.
It has been found necessary to rearrange the brigade formation of the
troops of Camp Merritt. The frequent changes that circumstances have
made in the plans for the future disposition of the Philippine troops,
have necessarily been accompanied by corresponding changes in the dif
ferent brigades.
The orders issued yesterday morning by Major-General Otis, creat
ing four provisional brigades, are considered permanent, and will remain
in effect until the forces in their entirety arive at the front; then the ex
igencies of the occasion will determine the permanent campaign forma
tion. They are as follows:

tionary Forces, Camp Merritt, San Francisco June 12, 1898.

mand of MAJOR-GENEBAL OTIS,
JOHN L. SEHON, Assistant Adjutant-General.
The Seventh California was originally with the Fourth Brigade,
which was assigned to Brigadier-General. Otis; under the reorganization
the Seventh and Otis go to the Third.
Asked whether or not the damage reported to the boilers of the
steamer Morgan City would cause the erasure from the list of Wednes
day's expedition of the two Idaho battalions and the detachment of the
engineering corps, Major-General Otis replied, "I do not Bee why It
course, changes are always likely to leave in a few days, though, of
should; the boat ought to be able to happen."

HARE-RAISING
AT THE PARKS
Great Coursing Here and
at Los Angeles.
A FIRM FRIEND AT UNION
THE GREAT DOG BEAT MOON
DYNE IN THE FINAL.
Koolawn Was the Best at Ingleside
in Spite of Long Boy, Who
Made a Gallant
' , ,; Tight Â :
Joy and enthusiasm reigned supreme at
the Union coursing park yesterday. The
former was displayed by short-enders and
the latter was indulged In by many hun
dred bettors who were fortunate enough
to lay their shekels on Firm Friend in tho
final heat of the day between her and
Moondyne at 5 to 1.
In that race two "hares" had been al
lowed to make their escape, until a lively
fellow from the wilds of Fresno was
turned loose. The hounds were slipped
and bounded away after it in full tilt.
Moondyne Jumped to the front, but close
to his heels was the Pasha kennels' pride.
The former animal closed in and tried to
end the chase quickly. With a great leap
she poked her Jaws at the frightened rab
bit, which turned to escape. Firm Friend,
taking advantage of the new tack, clev
erly turned the hare three or four times,
until, with a tremendous leap, Moondyne
caught her prey. When Judge Bell sig
naled Firm Friend the winner the short
enders' Joy knew no bounds. Cheer after
cheer was given for the greyhound, the
judge, and in fact every one who par
ticipated in the race.
A delightful day attracted thousands to
the park. Lively hares tried the hounds
out to their utmost and oftentimes made
their escape, to the disappointment of the
dogs.
Commodore proved a veritable Chinese
puzzle to both talent and short-enders.
The representative of Curtis & Sons had
during the past few months run in poor
form, and when pitted against E. V. Sul
livan's Royal Buck it was though she
had not a ghost of a chance. With odds
of 4 to 1 against her she upset all prog
nostications by simply romping away
from her rival and winning out. Commo
dore was next pitted against Theron and
succeeded in running a tie, but on their
second appearance Theron in a hard drive
just beat her out for a flag.
In fhe "Bappltng stake" race the St.
Lawrence kennels had four representa
tives, all of whom were out of the same
litterâ a coincidence rarely seen in a
coursing match. Lalla Rookh and Lottie
M, two sisters, were in the final. Lottie
M was favorite over the former, but Lalla
Rookh landed the purse after a hard
chase..
Long and "hare" raising rune were the
rule during the day and were appreciated
by every one. Following is the way the
dogs ran:
First tiesâ Lissak beat White Chief; Forget
beat Jorder's Valentine; Therein beat Glen
wood; Commodore beat Royal Buck; . Firm
Friend beat Laurelwood; Lady Blanche beat

At Ingleside.
Koo Lawn did it. ShÂ© was the best
at Ingleside yesterday. Log Boy made a
gallant fight, but the Santa Clara maid
made a "kick" and Log Boy was "left."
Then Little Dell threw down Santa Clara
County, and '"Frisco" owned It all.

ABT IN HUMANITY'S CAUSE.
A Second Day's Exhibit of Paintings
in Aid of the Bed Cross
Society.
Owing to thÂ« crush at the art exhibit
held in aid of the Red Cross Society in the
rooms of the Press Club on Saturday
afternoon and evening, the gems donated
by local artists have not all been disposed
of, and this afternoon and evening too
pictures that have not been purchased
will be again exhibited. As on the first
day, a delightful musical programme will
be rendered, and it is expected that the
rooms will again be crowded with a
fashionable and critical gathering.
Preparations to receive and entertain
the visitors have been under way, and
every effort will be made to repay them
for their expenditures in aid of the boys
in blue.
S. M. Shortridge will act as auctioneer
in. the evening, and his persuasive voice
will surely win many bids for the unsold
pictures. So far many hundreds of dol
lars have been received by those in
charge of the exhibition, and it is ex
pected that the receipts for the two days
will be over a thousand.
The thanks of the Red Cross Society are
particularly due to Mrs. N. Clarke for
originating the idea of holding the exhibi
tion. While aiding the soldiers out in
camp with food and other necessaries she
thought the artists of this city might lend
their aid. She consulted Annabel Lee, a
fellow-artist, and it was decided to appeal
to the profession. Their requests for as
sistance were readily granted, and within
a short period pictures in large quantities
began to flow in. The Press Club allowed
the ladies the use of its club rooms for
the exhibition and aided in other ways.
Other artists volunteered their services
and the work of arranging the pictures
was soon finished. Invitations were sent
to over a thousand people, and that thj?y
were accepted was shown by the tre
mendous crowd that flowed in and Out of
the rooms on Saturday.
AN ELECTRIC PICNIC.

NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN
Two Decisions Concern
ing Reorganization.
NO EQUIPMENT FOR GUARDS.
GOVERNOR AND MAJOR GEN
ERAL TO CONFER.
A Regiment of Infantry That Will
Be Well Prepared if It Is Called
Into Service â Naval
Militia.
During the past week there has been
but little work done in the National Guard
of the State of California, but there has
been some discussion by the heads of
the organization on the subject of the
re-establlshment of the guard.
Within ten days there have been ren
dered two decisions on this subject â the
first by the judge advocate of the Divi
sion staff, Lieutenant-Colonel J. J. Dwyer,
and the other by Attorney-General Fitz
gerald. The two do not coincide on the
material points, the former holding that j
the moment the National Guardsmen vol
unteered into the service of the United
States they ceased to be members of the
guard and should be discharged from the
service of the State. The other holds
that the men who have so enlisted may
be granted leave of absence, and that upon I
the close of the war they can return to |
the several positions In companies and
regiments they occupied before enlisting.
The Attorney-General holds that the ser
vices of the National Guardsmen in the
war should count the same as if they
were actually guardsmen in the State.
The latter decision is on the lines of
the action taken recently In the matter
of guardsmen in New York. Massachus
etts, Pennsylvania and Illinois. In the
State of Massachusetts the Legislature,
which was in session, passed a law pro- j
viding thai the guardsmen be granted a I
â  of absence while in the volunteer ]
service, and that within thirty days aftei
being mustered out they can return to
their previous positions in the service of
the State.
A DIFFICULTY.
Aside from the opinion of the Attorney-
General, which will no doubt be followed,
as it is favored by Governor Budd, Com
mander-in-Chief, and Adjutant-General
Barrett, the.re is great difficulty in the
way of rehabilitating the guard, should
there be a desire to do so. That is the
lack of uniforms and equipments. The
First and Seventh regiments and the bat
talion from the Sixth went into the ser
vice of the United States with the arms
and uniforms of the State, and the ar
mories are empty, so that if there were
enrolled a number of mon to bring the
companies up to the minimum number
these would be simply bodies of men un
able to perform the duties of National
Guardsmen for want of that which is
necessary to make up the soldier.
The State Legislature not being in ses
sion at this time, there is no appropria
tion with which to put such men, wero
they to be enrolled, in proper condition
for service.
It has been stated that at this time
there in no need for more guardsmen in
this State than there are at present for
the reason that th*re will be plenty of
soldiers in the volunteer service to call
upon in case of need. While it is true
that there will be many volunteers, such
men are not in the service of the State
and they cannot be called upon the same
as State troops for immediate duty. Be
fore they could he called out to take part
in any trouble in the State it would have
to appear to the satisfaction of the Presi
dent of the United St. â¢::<â¢? that all the
I'^-r of the civil authorities and that of
the National Guard had been exhausted
and that it was insufficient.
A TOXFERENX^.
This afternoon there will be a confer
ence in the headquarters of Major Gen
eral Dickinson in the Mills building for
the purpose of discussing the proposition
of reorganization. At this there will be
present the commander-in-chief and the
division commander and others who are
interested in the guard. The division
cmimander is in .favor of reorganizing
the guard and placing it on a better foot-
Ing than it was before the mustering in of
Jh P m w n volun teerc-d, but in view of
the difficulties in the way of reorganizing
at this time and the opinion of the At
torney General it is likely that nothing in
mmÂ» V Â« y t Of |> rr t c i; eStabl J Sinff the Jard Â»*U
come out of the conference.
THE FIFTH REGIMENT.
In anticipation that the Fifth Regi
ment of Infantry will be called out to fill
the State's quota on the second call for
volunteers, the several companies have,
during the past two weeks, been prepar
ing themselves for presentation before
the mustering officer within twelve hours
after being summoned. And to encourage
them in this the citizens of the locali
ties in which the several companies are
stationed, Petaluma most prominently
have n^ide arrangements to provide each
company with what they shall need for a
week at least, so that if they are called
put they will be all prepared for camp
life and will not want for many things, as
aid some of the other regiments of volun
orTt Camp kiernlr 1^ at the Pre ? Â°
The men are all furnished with the new
uniforms recently provided by the State
that is the men who were on the roll be
fore there was recruiting up to the full
number. The recruits instead of appear
ing in any old thing" will wear uniforms
that were cast aside for the new ones.
The men have during the past two weeks
been very thoroughly drilled and they
have received instructions' in camp life
They have also received instructions m
the matter of putting up and operating
the Buzzecott ovens, the proper distribu
tion of rations and the preparation of
them so if they are ordered out to Camp
Merritt they will be in much better con
dition than any of the State troops pre
viously sent out It is expected that or
ders which will decide the fate of the
regiment will be received at the head
quarters of the <ommander-ln-chief either
to-day or to-morrow.
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS.
There- being no further demand for first,
second or third class signalmen there will
be no more enlistments from the three
brigade signal corps of the State
The several troops of cavalry are ready
to move, but- the chances .ire that they
will not be called into service
The naval nrflitla is still waiting orders
X number of the men In this organization
tired of waiting to be called out for sea
Service, have volunteered and joined the
toot troops in the hope that they will be
sent to Manila or some other point to
which troops may be ordered. Their anx
iety is that they may be sent somewhere
Dut of the State.

TRANSPORTS
ALMOST READY
The Senator to Go Out
With the Others.
QUICK WORK DONE ON HER.
TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT
LAST WEDNESDAY.
An Exciting Rat Hunt in the Harbor
Receiving Hospital Ended in
a Brilliant Victory for
Dr. Hill.
There were basy times on the trans
ports yesterday. At the Mall Dock the
last of the supplies were being put
aboard the China, and Colon; at the Oce
anic dock camp equipments, ammunition
and two field gruns for the Utah battery
were put aboard the Zealandla, while
scow schooners and barg-es were putting
coal Into the Senator from both sides.
Very little was being done to the Morgan
City, and the chances are that she will
go on the drydock before starting for
Manila. In that event she will not go out
with the Zealandla, Senator, China and
Colon, but will be added to the fleet com
posed of the Ohio, Indiana, City of Para
and City of Puebla.
Orders have been Issued to everybody
who has anything to do with getting the
first-named fleet ready to have every
thing aboard and in place by Tuesday
night. In the case of the Zealandia,
China and Colon everything that can be
put aboard will be on the steamers to
night, but double gangs will have to
work day and night in order to get the
Senator ready by Tuesday night. The
China, Colon and Zealandia will probably
go out into the stream to-day, when the
work of putting the ammunition aboard
will begin. Orders are for the fleet to
sail on Wednesday, but the chances are
that it will be Thursday before they get
away.
The greatest rat hunt in the history of
the water front took place in the Harbor
Receiving Hospital last Saturday night.
Dr. Hill escaped with a slight scalp
wound. Dr. Zabala ruined a shirt and
burst a pair of suspenders, Arthur Os
born was scared half to death, Chris Jes
sen had to take, refuge on the top of a
folding bed. but the rat was killed.
It was about 9:30 p. m. and the front
door of the hospital was open. A mon
ster gray rat attracted by the electric
light came up from the Mission-street
s^wer and begaji an exploration of the
operating-room. Dr. Hiflf spied the in
truder, and with great presence of mind
closed the means of egress for the ro
dent and seized a club. He explained the
situation to his companions, and Dr. Za
bala armed himself with a walking stick,
Jeasen with a broom and Osborn with a
sword bayonet. In the hunt that follow
ed Dr. Hill received a blow intended for
the rat on his head from Jes.sen's broom,
while in making a dive under a table
after the pest Dr. Zabala's shirt and sus
penders caught in a nail, but the nail
being the stronger, won the day. Hard
pressed by Dr. Hill, the rat took refuge
in the leg of Arthur Oshnrn's trousers,
and everybody in the room had to give
up the chase in order to laugh at Ar
thur 1 s efforts to get rid of his unwelcome
guest.
When Osborn finally dislodged the rat
it made a bee line for Jessen, and the lat
ter in his anxiety to escape climbed to the
top of a folding bed. The rat took rofuge
in the bedclothes, and when dislodged
Dr. Hill laid it low with a blow from his
club. Then the victoi^ous four sat down
to repair damages.
A. F. Carson, an ex-driver for Wells,
Fargo & Co., received a probably fatal in
jury yesterday morning. While under
the influence of liquor he fell at the cor
ner of Sacramento and Kearny. His head
struck the curbstone and the chances are
that his skull is fractured. He was
treated by Dr. Zabala at the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital.
Charley Fair's palatial gasoline yacht
I.ucero came out of retirement yesterday
and will be kept in commission" through
out the season. For nearly two years she
has been laid up in Oakland Creek, but
Mr. Fair has decided to recommission
her. Yesterday she was taken to Sausa
llto and after an overhauling will go on
a cruise 'to Monterey and Santa Cruz.
E. W. Hopkins' fine steam yacht El
Prlmero is also going into commission
shortly. She is on the drydock at the
Union Iron Works, but as she is in the
same dock as tne Corona, it will be about
two weeks before she can get out. Mr.
Hopkins is thinking of going East for a
visit and if he does so the El Primero
will not go Into commission until his re
turn.
The boys of the naval battalion took a
day off yesterday and went to Goat Island
for a clambake. They took along a
plentiful supply of the succulent bivalve
and several kegs of beer. For one day at
least war and rumors of wars were for
gotten and the boys had a real enjoyable
time of it. After their outing they are
now ready to fight the whole Spanish na
tion.
The steamer Tillamnok with her tow
the Tukon River steamer Rideout, got
away for St. Michael yesterday. Every
thing in regard to the freight on the
Tillamook's dock was arranged to the
satisfaction of the customs authorities so
that the vessel was allowed to proceed
The Alaska-Yukon Transportation Com
pany's river steamer James Eva went out
Saturday night in tow of the tug Rescue.
The tug will take her to Astoria, -where
she will be turned over to the company's
steamer National City and towed to St
Michael. The Eva will be followed by
two others of the company's river steam
ers in a week or so. The tug Rescue will
bring back a big raft from the Columbia
River.
The British bark "VHllscott has been
purchased by John Rosenfeld's Sons
for $35.500. She put In here in distress
after having been dismasted in a hurri
cane on the Japanese coast. It will cost
about $30,000 to put her in thorough re
pair and then she will be as good as a
now vessel, as she was only on her
maiden voyage when the accident hap
pened.
A new kind of rubber plant has been
discovered in the Congo region. The sap
that becomes converted into rubber is
contained in its roots.

There was a clergyman in a Long Island village who suf-
fered from dyspepsia to such an extent that it positively seemed
sometimes as though his doctrine was not sound. It was, however,
only a stomach trouble, and had nothing to do with the mind.
Being convinced ef this, one of his parishioners, a lady, presented
him with a small quantity of Ripaos Tabules and the relief he ex-
perienced was such that all the congregation noticed an improve-
ment, and now, although his salary is small, this clergyman and
his wife devote a portion of it to keeping the medicine closet
stocked with a suitable supply of Ripans Tabules. Doubtless
there are many cases where what has been thought heresy was in
fact nothing more. nor less than dyspepsia, and Ripans Tabules cure
dyspepsia. One gives relief.

FOR FARMERS
Remarkable Exports of
Bread stuffs.
THIS YEAR A RECORD BREAKER
REPORTS FROM THE BUREAU
OF STATISTICS.
Notwithstanding the War No Such
Advancement Has Been Shown,
in the History of the
Country.
WASHINGTON. June 12.â The farm
ers of the United States are drawing
upon other parts of the world for more
money in the fiscal year which ends
this month than in any preceding year
In the history of the country. Even the
high water mark of 1592, when our ex
ports of agricultural products amount
ed to 1799.328.252, will be surpassed by
the record of the year which closes
with this mon '1.
The preliminary reports of May ex
hortations which have reached the Bu-
reaii of Statistics make it quite appa
rent that the agricultural exports of
the year will be considerably in excess
of $800,000,000, the total for the year be
ing likely to reach $835,000,000. Never
before have the exports of agricultural
products reached the $800,000,000 line,
and never but twice have they been as
much as $700,000,000, the two occasions
being In 1881 and 1592. Compared with
the last fiscal year the Increase in ex
ports of agricultural products will be
fully $150,000,000, and compared with the
preceding â â â¢ear, the increase will be
over $250,000,000, while the total will be
fully 50 per cent in excess of that of the
fiscal year of 1595.
In breadstuffs alone the exports of the
year will amount to nearly $1,000,000 for
each business day, and will be more
than $100,000,000 In excess of last year's
exports of breadstuffs. Nearly all ar
ticles classed as breadstuffs have par
ticipated In this Increase. Of wheat
the value of the exports of the fiscal
year 1898 will be more than double
those of the fiscal year 1597, while the
Increase In flour will be nearly 50 per
cent, and of corn nearly 50 per cent in
value. May exports of corn were larger
than those of any other month in the
history of the country, while the total
exports of corn for the year, for the
first time, will pass the 200,000,000 bushel
line, the total in only three preceding
years having reached 100,000,000 bushels.
Cornmeal, oats and oatmeal and rye
Bhow a striking increase, the gain In
oatmeal being more than 60 per cent
over last year, and that of oats 100 per
cent, wLile â¢- rye the gain is also
phenomenally large.
"Provisions" â in which term are In-
eluded beef, hog and dairy products â
also show a marked increase, the total
exports of provisions for the year being
likely to reach $160,000,000 in value.
Most of this increase, however, is in
hog- productsâ exportations of bacon,
which were $34,187,147 in value last year,
being likely to reach $44,000,000 this
year, and lard showing a similar in
crease, being likely to reach $37,000,000
this year, or a gain of nearly $8,000,000.
Live beef seemfl to be gaining in pop
ularity with our foreign customers, the
exports of beef cattle being Increased
materially, while those of beef, either
fresh, canned or salted, have failed to
show any increase â in most cases a de
cided falling off being noticeable.
The exports <>f beef cattle during the
first ten months of the fiscal year were
879,663, against 310,478 in the corre
sponding month of last year, while
f^-esh beef in the same period fell from
1!12. 1fi^.034 pounds in ten months of 1897
to 227,434,375 pounds in the correspond
ing ten months of 1S98; salted beef
shows a fall of 37 p^r cent for the year,
and canned beef from 46.349,006 pounds
In the ten months of 1897 to 34,011.129
pounds in the ten months of 1898.

The 200 and the 50 yard ranges used by
ioluxobia Pistol and Rifle Club were
kept hot all Cay, but for all that no par
ticularly brilliant scores were- turned out.
In the members' rifle medal match J.

of the coming marksman by making a

OARSMEN AND
SCULLERS MEET
Ariel Rowers Hold Their
Club Regatta.
SOUTH ENDS ENTERTAIN
LOVERS OF AQUATIC SPORT AT
LONG BRIDGE.
The German Four Defeats the
Senior Barge Crew Through a
Mishap to the
Latter.
The lovely morning yesterday attracted
a large crowd of visitors to Long Bridge
to witness the regatta of the Ariel Row-
Ing Club. The immediate purpose of the
regatta was to test the crews and single
scullers, with a view to deciding who
shall be the club representatives at the
El Campo regatta on June 26 and July 17.
Additional interest was lnparted to the
regatta by the fact that it io not Im
probably the last Important aquatic event
that will be held off Long Bridge, which,
like many another old landmark of the
city, is said to be doomed to early de
struction. The Pioneer and Ariel rowing
clubs, which have their boathouses on the
bridge, were crowded with oarsmen,
visitors and friends. The club kept open
house for all the oarsmen on the bay. The
course was from a line drawn from the
bridge and in front of the South End boat
house to about half a mile toward the
Union Iron Works, round a buoy and re
turn. The water was very smooth and
favorable to fast time.
Among the visitors were the Alameda
barge crew, consisting of F. W. Ayers, E.
B. Hadcock, W. Q. Hansen, Captain At
well Webb and H. C. Mayhew, and the
Dolphin sijf-oared barge, In which were
W. O. Patch, J. Keenan, T. Keenan, J.
Laib and T. Kennedy. J. R. Bookman of
the Ariel Rowing Club was marshal of
the course. After the races were over the
oarsmen repaired to the South End boat
house, where music and light refresh
ments whited away the afternoon. The
members of the South End Rowing Club
were out in force, and welcomed their
many friends in the new handball court
and in the large room upstairs. W. Mur
phy acted as master of ceremonies. A
summary of the results follows:
1. Junior skiff race â E. Sternberg vs. C
McAuliffe. E. Sternberg won in 10 mm.
3G 2-5 sec.
2. Junior barge race â The crew made up
of E. Chappelle. stroke; A. Carroll, after
waist; P. Wilson, forward waist; and A.
Carroll, bow, beat the crew made up of
E. Lynch, stroke; F. Loth, nfterwaist; A.
Haughton, forwardwaist, and E. Mc-
Donough, bow. Time, 7 mln. 53-4-5 sec.
The losing crew rowed a faster stroke
than the winners, but were not so well
together and grew somewhat wild at the
finish.
3. Senior skiff raceâ F. Wilson vs. R.
Ellis. F. Wilson got the best of the start,
and pulling well within himself won com
fortaoly by one and a half lengths. Time,
9 mm. 23 sec.
4. Match barge race between the senior
Ariel crew and the 'German" crf>w.
The "German" crew is composed of
members of the Turn Verein, strong, ath
letic men who have practiced regularly
together, and though only juniors in
standing are formidable opponents. Short
ly after rounding the buoy for the return
home, W. Howe of the senior crew was
seen to be holding his oar in his hands
and merely setting the time to his crew
wich his body, his oarlock had become
useless. Yet the senior crew, though it
rowed home with only three oars, was
beaten by the "German" crew by not
more than one and a half lengths. The
seniors would certainly have won had no
accident befallen them.

"Walks Out of Her Boom and

After Weeks of Suf

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 12.
Mre. Carrie Judd Montgomery, who
claims to have been snatched from death
by faith in the "Great Physician" on two
previous occasions, declares to-day that
she has again been miraculously healed
through faith, when science said she must
die. Mrs. Montgomery is a well-known
special aid in the Salvation Army and is
often spoken of as the wife of Mil
lionaire Montgomery, although Mr. Mont
gomery denies that he iB worth any such
amount
For the past six weeks Mrs. Montgom
ery has been a terrible sufferer. First she
had cerebro-spinal meningitis, and physi
cian?, called against her will, pronounced
her case a hopeless one. She refused med
icine and professional nurses, counte
nancing nothing but faith in the healing
power of her Creator to restore her to
hralth. This was at her country home at
Lytton Springs, and she recovered and
came here, going about her daily work at
the various homes and institutions which
the and her husband have established at
Beulah, near Mills College.
She was taken ill suddenly with nervous
prostration and has suffered Intensely.
Dr. Stark, a "Christian" physician, was
called, but she refused to have anythingto
do with him. A nurse was ca.lled, but that
only made matters worse, as the patient
refused to sleep, with her in the house.
In this condition and with her digestive
organs refusing entirely to do their duty,
the missionary and Christian Alliance
members sot a day of prayer for her re
covery. To-day she declared to her friends
that from that day she has improved, be
ing able to digest anything she ate.
Friday last a Mr. Francis, a conse
crated member of the alliance living In
San Francisco, felt impressed with the
duty of calling upon some sick one. He
took the boat for this city, and on the
way read an account of Mrs. Montgom
ery's serious illness in The Call. He at
once decided that she was the sick one
he could see. In company with a Mr.
Brote, another member, he called, and
they held a season of prayer. The rest
Is best told in Mr?. Montgomery's own
words:
â  I was alone in my room this morning
with Mrs. Fanny Montgomery." she said,
wh^n relating her experience, "when I
received the assurance of my healing. I
had never doubted God's power, and
when I felt as I did T arose and went
out on the upper veranda. The peace and
happiness of the hour were sublime. Af
ter going downstairs for a while after
breakfast I returned to my room, refus
ing to lean on Mr. Montgomery's arm or
that of any other but my "Great Physi
cian.' "
From 11 to 1 o'clock Mrs. Montgomery
Ba4 'hrough the usual Sunday service at
Beulah, at which all of the children from
the two orphanapcF were present as well
as many others. She sat by the organ,
and at the cirse showed no signs of fa
tiTue or nervousness. She gives due
crt'ila to the members of the alliance who
prayed for her, but believing in God's
power for the Improved condition she
herself in. She will attend the ses
of the annual convention which
commence this week in the Congrega
tional Church and tell her own story, if
all goes well.
Her early life and cure from consump
tion when* she was so wasted that she
could not lift her head from her pillow
has been published in nearly a dozen
languages, and published in the press of
the East when It occurred. That was In
her home in Buffalo, N. Y\ She has but
one child, a beautiful daughter she calls
"Faith," in recognition of the many
blessings she has received.
THOUSANDS AT THE PARK.
A Patriotic Programme Draws a
Large Crowd â Fun at Sutro
Baths.
Thousands of pleasure-seekers enjoyed
the music, the sunshine and the flowers
at the Park and Cliff yesterday. Many
soldiers from Camp Merritt mingled iÂ»
the crowds, and It was apparent that they
v. â r. glad of the freedom outside the
guard iines. The patriotic music at the
Park, f r< e admission at the Chutes and a
swimming match at Sutro's baths ac
corded the soldiers plenty of pleasure, and
they appreciated it. At the Chutes many
additional things of interest have been
! to the ensemble of exhibits, but
the biK man. Henri Maurice Cannon, the
big lion and the big seal are the centers
<rf attraction. In a few days a new fea
ture in the shape of an observatory will
be complete!. It will stand on top of the
tall Chute tower, and an excellent land
and marine view can be enjoyed.
Early In the day the soldiers who were
rtidpate in the swimming races and
- of their friends began to gather at
Sutro's Baths, and when the opening
event was announced the largest crowd
that h;is gathered under the vast roof
this season was present to witness It.
The soldiers proved good swimmers, and
each succeeding event was viewed with
Increased interest.

BY JOE CORBETT.
After about ac hot and evenly contested j
a game as one would care to see, the
"sand crabs" fell down before Manager j
Ewlng's bunch of "hairless wonders" yes- j
terday afternoon at Recreation Park to j
the tune of 4 to 3. It was a game marked â 
by clever and at intervals wild playing, In
Which that rare uncertainty characteristic
;of the game played a most prominent j
| part. Not until the last man was out
j could one possibly pick a winner, and j
j when the finish did come it happened so :
! unexpectedly that it was really difficult to j
I realize that a team which had made such |
| a noble uphill fight had at the last mo- i
' ment met with defeat. Such, however, Is j
baseball.
On Saturday the Beachcombers snatched
| victory from the very jaws of defeat. Yes
terday they met with a like fate, so
there Is no use of complaining. However, j
it is really sad to see those earnest, hard- i
, working "Sand Crabs" meet with re- j
1 verses, for It is to them that the fans are ,
' Indebted for the few good games of base- ]
ball they have had the pleasure of wit- i
nessing since the consolidation. All sea- |
i son they have been playing in the se- ,
I verest kind of luck, it being no uncom- j
; mon occurrence for them to lose games by ;
' the smallest kind of a margin. Possibly :
', they themselves are responsible for the
numerous defeats chalked up against
them. Be this so or not, they certainly '
i have had the lion's share of misfortune,
and if for no other reason than the onu
1 that they have participated in the only â 
good games'of ball seen here this season,
let us root for them.
Their defeat yesterday was due princl- I
pally to their inability to connect with :
i with Mr. Mosklman's shoots when hits ;
! were needed. In fact, they could do noth
; ing with this gentleman to speak of, as :
| only four safe hits were made off him
i during the entire game. He pitched very
! steady ball and was given the poorest sort
: of support at times, Schmeer and O'Neil ;
being the principal offenders. O'Neil in
particular played a miserable game, not
only in the field, but at the bat. His
striking out in the third inning with a
man on first and second was just as stu- ;
, pid a play as that made by Balsz on the
preceding day. The proper play was to i
i advance the runners, but as usual the
first rules of baseball must be disregard
| ed and an elegant chance for a big rally i
: thrown to the winds simply because a i
player saw a chance to make of himself ,
a temporary idol. Do th ; proper thing at
the proper time, and don't hamper the '
chances of your team by doing otherwise, i
Next to O'Neil'B wretched work comes I
the complete though brief ascension of
: the whole Oakland team. It occurred in
! the seventh inning, and for a moment it
looked as if the game must end in a con
fusing avalanche of every old thing post
; sible in a game of ball. Santa Cruz had i
: a man on first and one on third. C. Dau
benbis singled to left and Donovan, in- i
stead of returning the ball to second
threw wild to first. Sykes finally located '
the ball and thre^ it wild to the plate, i
two runs scoring on the play.
â  It took the whole Oakland"team to hold :
that ball, and I'll wager if it had not been
for this fact the ball would have finally
been thrown over the fence. It was
in this inning that the"Sand Crabs" tied
the score, and how that immense crowd I
did howl. You know if somehting like <
, this did not occur the game would not be :
1 enjoyable, and. therefore, this terrible In
ddent could not possibly detract any ln
, terest from the game. It certainly did ,
i not in this instance, for the game de
! veloped into one of those grand finales, â 
and all on account of those few long- |
distance throws. In the next inning quiet i
and good baseball prevailed, but in the ;
following and last what a change. After
the "Sand Crabs" had retired in order, as !
also the first man up for the Oaklands '
| "Claudie" Schmeer redeemed himself by !
I meeting the ball for a clean two bagger. :
i Then came the "Mighty" Sykes. "Bing!"
i and all was over. The ball was found
i somewhere in the neighborhood of the :
i carriage drive, and no one knows what
poor Mr. Tuttle must pass through on his i
i return to "Knockersville," and all over
; that last drive of Sykes. . Score:

ATHLETICS LOSE.
San Jose Pulls Out a Close
Game From the San Fran
cisco Aggregation.
SAN JOSE, June 12.â To-day's game
with the Athletics was stubbornly con
tested and fraught with much uncertainty
until the last man was put out in the
ninth inning. The visitors lost mainly
through poor base running. San Jose's
infield did marvelous work, accepting
twenty-seven chances without an error.
Hanley made a sensational catch of what
looked like a four-cushion shot by Josh
Riley. The home team scored in the sec
ond on a combination of errors and in the
seventh placed two more to their credit.
The Athletics put two men across the
plate in the seventh and were one run [
shy when the game closed. Fountain was j
wild and was taken out of the box. it'ltz
patrick was substituted and pitched a
strong game.

TWO BICYCLE RECORDS
BROKEN AT DENVER.
DENVER, June Two â¢ world's bi
,/cycl* records were lowered at the Chutes
Park in this city to-day. W. W. Hamil
ton, who previously held both the world's
paced and unpaced mile records, to-day
rode an unpaced mile in the remarkable
time of 1:56, thus clipping three and one
quarter seconds from the record as it
stood until to-day. Although this per
formance will not go on record as official
because no sanction of it had been asked
for, there Is no doubt of the correctness
of the time, as three experienced timers
held watches on the rider, and the record
was made in the presence of a number of
witnesses.
A. B. Hughes knocked six seconds from
the three-mile unpaced record, riding the
distance in 6:28. His last mile was ridden
in 2:03.
A regular meet will be held here on
Saturday next and Hamilton and Hughes
will attempt to make new records for one
mile and three miles, unpaced riding.
EDGAR FLEMING
HAS DISAPPEARED.
THE POLICE ASKED TO HELP IN
DISCOVERING HIM.
He Is an Ex-Sea Captain and Justice
of the Peace of Coronado,
Near San Diego.
The wife of Edgar Fleming 1 of Coronado,
near San Diego, arrived in the city yester
day morning, and at once made her way
to police headquarters. She wanted the
police to help her in ascertaining the
whereabouts of her husband.
Mrs. Fleming said that on April 17 last
her husband left Coronado for this city
with the object of obtaining some suit
able employment here. "While here he
was taken sick and he wrote his wife thai
he wanted to return home. She sent him
a ticket for his passage on the steamer
Santa Rosa, which left here on May 31.
When the steamer reached San Diego
Mrs. Fleming went on board and was dis
appointed not to find her husband there.
The purser added to the mystery by
showing her that the ticket had been
presented but he could not say that he
saw her husband on board.
Mrs. Fleming waited for a day or two,
and not hearing from her husband de
cided to comÂ© to this city and find out
if possible if any accident could have
happened him. She told the police that
some one might have maltreated her hus
band and stolen the ticket from him. A
search of the records at the City Prison
and Receiving Hospital showed that he
had not been brought to either place, and
her alarm was in consequence increased.
Fleming is a man about 45 years of age,
five feet ten inches tall, slender build,
with gray hair, light mustache and blue
eyes. He was a sea captain for twelve
years and Justice of the Peace in Coro
nado four years ago. His -wife is very
much worried over his peculiar disappear
ance, and believes that something serious
has happened him. The police will do
everything possible to help her In solv
ing the mystery.

Eminent Divines Here
for the Cause.
THE CHRISTIAN ALLIANCE.
ITS CONFERENCE IS TO CON
TINUE THBEE DAYS.
Noble Aims of the Organization Set
Forth by Pulpit Orators â Great
Work Being Accom
plished.
-â¢â  lerles of lnter-denomlnational confer
ences of the Christian and Missionary al
liances began at the United Presbyterian
Church, Golden Gate avenue and Polk
street, yesterday at 11 a. m., and included
an afternoon and evening session. It is
probably the most important movement
of the kind that has taken place on the
Pacific Coast by reason of the fact that
it is attended by the foremost Christian
workers in the country. Among them are
the Rev. A. B. Simpson, D.D., the founder
of the Alliance; Dean A. C. Peck, field
superintendent; Rev. W. A. llyland, na
tional organizer; Rev. Mr. Lelacheur,
superintendent of the Alliance missions In
China, and the famous pulpit orator. Rev.
John Robertson, D.D., of Glasgow, Scot-
The objects of this great and worthy I
organization are to arouse Christians to j
Sweater efforts toward promoting not only
the spiritual welfare of their fellow-men I
around them, but the benighted in pagan j
lands; to promote a deeper spiritual Ufa \
among its members as well as all Chris
tians throughout the world. In this the
organization has been highly successful,
having by collections and appeals to re- i
ligious conventions maintained over 300 j
missionaries at work in all parts of the j
globe. As an evidence of Key. Dr. Simp- |
son's power as an orator it may be stated ;
that on one occasion at a great camp- |
meeting In the East he obtained over I
$100,000 in money and jewels to be used in
the cause.
~~e morning attendance was not as
large as expected, but crowded churches
are expected to be the rule at the suc
ceeding meetings. Rev. Mr. Robertson
preached the sermon, taking as his text
the following, "This is a faithful saying
worthy of all acceptance, that Jesus
Christ came into the world to save sin
ners, of whom I am one." The discourse
was clear, forceful and eloquent on the line
cf th.-> text, and a stirring appeal to the
unsaved as well as to those who were not
gimng in their convictions or weak in the
exhibition thereof.
In the afternoon there were music, a
prayer by the pastor. Rev. Mr. Frazer,
followed by a sermon by Dean Peck. The
gentleman has a striking presence and a
convincing way of illuminating his argu
ments which is pleasing and effective.
He gave the "milk-and-water, namby
pamby Christians" some hard raps, and
urged them to arouse from their lethargy
and uselessness, to the end that they
might not only save their own souls but
do something for their fellows. The ex
ample given his auditors was the match
less life of Paul of Tarsus, from which he
drew many beautiful illustrations of his
declaration that to be a Christian one
"must know Christ."
The evening session was addressed by
the same speakers on similar lines. To
day and evening Rev. Drs. Robinson and
Simpson will conduct the services and a
large attendance should result. There will
be three days of the conference, and these
eminent workers will then devote the
same time to Oakland at Asbury church.
Among the subjects to be discussed are:
"The Ministry of Prayer." "God's CallÃ
and Our Responsibility in Relation to Mis
sionary Work at Home and Abroad "
"The Place Held by Divine Healing In the
Economy of Grace," and "The Believer's
Privilege in Christ."
The conferences are under the auspices
of the Northern California branch of the
alliance.
MISSION OF AMERICA.
An Address by Rev. Charles Locke
Before the Y. M. C. A.
Rev. Charles Edward Locke delivered
a lecture before the Young Men's Chris
tian Association yesterday afternoon on
"The Mission of America. " After tracing
the history of the country from its dis
covery to the present day and showing
that the great principles of freedom and
liberty pervaded all the signal struggles
of, our people, ho said: "To-day we face
a heavier responsibility than at any time
since the war of 1861. We have again
discovered that God has something for
us to do. We have not merely to re
lieve the sufferings of a few reconcen
trados but to breathe the spirit of liberty
to a people who have been buried under
the iron hoof of medievalism and stagna
tion. We must breathe the spirit of free
dom to the people who live in the Pacific
Isles and to those of the Atlantic This
is our mission, as it has been since the
beginning of our progressive Govern
ment.

ARRESTS A DECENT WOMAN
MBS. HENDERSON SEIZED ON
HEB WAY HOME.
Judge Conlan, on learning of Her
Sad Predicament, at Once Orders
Her Belease From Cus
tody.
Policeman M. O'Callihan of the South
ern Station will In all probability have to
answer to a charge of unofflcer-like con
duct at the next meeting of the Police
Commissioners.
Late Saturday night he arrested a re
spectable, middle-aged woman, one Mrs.
Henderson, and charged her with va
grancy. Police Judge Conlan, who is ac
quainted with the woman, on learning of
her arrest last night, at once ordered her
release on her own recognizance.
According to the story of the unfortu
nate woman, she was walking along Ste
venson street, and when within a few feet
of her home she was arrested by O'Calli
han, who asked her where she was going.
She replied that she was on her way
home, whereupon the officious policeman
placed her under arrest. Despite her en
treaties to release her O'Calllhan marched
her to the nearest patrol box, where he
sent in a call for the wagon. A few min
utes later the woman was placed in the
wagon and driven to the City Prison,
where she was charged with vaeroacy.
Yesterday afternoon an attorney named
Comyn vis"ited the prison, and recogniz
ing Mrs. Henderson, with whom he is ac
quainted, asked her the cause of her de
tention. After listening to her story he
immediately hunted up Judge Conlan, to
whom he told the circumstances of the
v.oman's arrest. The Judge was indig
nant when he learned of the policeman's
mistake, and at once issued an order for
Mrs. Henderson's release.
To a reporter Mrs. Henderson 6aid she
was a dressmaker and had worked for a
number of years as such in Judge Con
lan's family.
"Last Saturday." she tearfully re
marked, "I received a note from Mrs. Mc-
Donald, who lives on Fourteenth street,
asking me if I could spare a day to make
a dress for her daughter. I went to her !
house immediately after receiving the
note, and remained there until after 10
o'clock in order to finish the dress. I
then took a Mission-street car and alight
ed at Fourth street. After I had reached
Stevenson street I walked down that >
thoroughfare on my way home. When I â¢
was within a few feet of my house I was I
accosted by the policeman who arrested
me. He asked me where I was going, and
when I replied he grabbed me by the
arm and half dragged me to the nearest
patrol-wagon box. I have always been a j
hard-working woman, and can prove it
by Judge Conlan and his family. I intend j
to make this officer suffer just to show !
him that he cannot arrest a respectable j
woman simply because she happens to be j
out late.
REV. EDWARDS DAVIS
ON "WAR IS HELL"
SENSATIONAL PREACHER HAS
ONLY SIXTY-SIX AUDITORS.
He Varies His Discourse With Up
to-Date Slang and Low Com
edy That Earns Ap
plause.
The Rev. Edwards Davis, whose eccen
tricities as a clergyman are familiar to
the bay cities, delivered the second of his
series of "sermons" at Metropolitan
Temple last evening to an audience of
sixty-six people, of whom five were re
porters. This is quite an increase over
the attendance of last Sunday.
His subject was announced as being
"War Is Hell," with apologies to General
Sherman, and he on that line advocated
tne policy of sheathing the sword and
waging the war of mind over evil.
While believing the present con
flict with Spain was Inevitable, he
declared that the great battles that
must eventually be fought by this
country would be internal â that of
the masses against the classes; of intelli
gence against the oppression of religion.
He thought, notwithstanding his personal
attitude, that there was not enough free
dom of thought and action in America.
The discourse was in some parts
thoughtful and Interesting, but discon
nected and interspersed wjlh low comedy
digressions the reception or which by the
audience showed that he is regarded as a
much better actor In the monologue class
than preacher. The latest current slang
seems to come naturally to him, and
there is no fault to find with his art in
handling dialect. During his remarks the
speaker expressed some very disagreeable
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONT) AT, JUNE 13, 1898,
opinions of that class of the community
which does not agree with his religious
views or principles.
The most entertaining part or the
Bennon was Mr. Davis' description of how
it had taken him five years. to learn that
the leading magazine publishers of the
world did not regard him as a poet. He.
however, still clings to the idea that he
was born with the divine gift, although
a prominent critic in this city had pro
nounced him "the worst pon in recorded
history." What there was of the "ser
mon" was the reiteration that man must
first conquer himself, conform to God's
laws, and "then he can be properly per
mitted " said Mr. Davis, "to resort to the
language of Mr. "Vanderbilt when he said
Mr. Davis announced another discourse
for next Sunday evening.
TO-MORROW SACRED TO THE FLAG
The Call's suggestion that to-morrow be generally celebrated as the 121 st anniversary of the birth of the
American flag has been generally seconded by patriots all over the State. The schools will quite generally observe
the day, and it is evident that thousands of private and public houses in this city will be decorated in honor of
the birth of Old Glory.
Speaking of the movement yesterday, the Very Rev. Father Frendergast said: "I am heartily in favor of the
movement. It is a fine thing to remember the birthday of the flag and to do anything good in the way of enkind
ling memories of its origin. This country Is a land of religious and political freedom, and we need often to recur to
tho fact that the flag is for all, and that it is not the purpose of the founders of the Government to favor any
thing narrow. If nouses are decorated and citizens wear the emblem of freedom on their breasts it is a sign that
the spirit of liberty still lives and is welcome to the people of this city and State, as well as all over the United
States. It is a good idea for the young as well as the old to remember the lessons of the flag, that the spirit of
freedom may not die in this day and generation."
Aside from the general observance of the day in a quiet way It is quha likely that there will be special exer
cises commemorative of the flag, and its lessons In the schools of the city and elsewhere. i
Everybody who can buy or borrow a flag ought to have one in evidence to-morrow. Let the presence- of the
flag be so universal .that all will recognize the fact that there is a hearty patriotism in the hearts of the masses.
There was a flag presentation at Presentation Convent, Taylor and Ellis streets, yesterday, which was char
acterized by such patriotism as should mark the conduct of good citizens to-morrow.
To-morrow will be the 121 st anniversary of the birth of the American flag. It is also the day when a num
ber of young ladles will graduate at the convent mentioned. However, as they had made a beautiful bunting flag
nine by fifteen feet, they presented It to the sisters yesterday. The ceremonies were impressive and beautiful.
The presentation speech was by Miss M. B. Mulcare, and was as follows:
Beloved Mother Superior: I have the honor to address you in behalf of my sister graduates of the class of "98, on a subject
which we trust will meet with your approbation â that of allowing: us to place Old Glory over our beloved Alma Mater where
wo have ever been taught that love of God and love of country are so closely united that one cannot exist without the other.
You In your cloistered home can scarcely realize the nature of our request. We would prove to the people of San Fran
cisco and to all who may visit the city of the GoMÂ»n West, that the accusation of want of patriotism In Catholic schools is
a gross calumny: that the pupils of this and like Institutions are taught to hold In greatest veneration their country's flag, and
to give. If necessary, their very heart's blood in defense of their country's honor.
But, dear Sisters, this Is not our only reason. The class of '98. with deep affection, wishes to present you with Old Glory
as a parting giftâ a slight token of the intense gratitude they feel for your untiring zeal and devotion during their happy school
days. Accept it. then, dear Mother Superior, and may It ever float with honor over our beloved convent home. May the
breezes which shall gently sway It to and fro undor the blue canopy make its stars shine brighter and Its crimson stripes more
glorious. And when the brave boys of the First rrturn with laurels to their California homes we shall all meet again to
place one more star upon the azure blue of our country's glorious flag.
The following programme was rendered at the convent during the afternoon:
Grand chorus (class of f 9B-'99), "Our Flag" ; owning address. Miss M. Carter; duet (two pianos), "Union," Misses Byrne,
Montgomery, Wagner, Cavanagh; vocal solo, "The Star Spangled Banner." Miss Cavanagh: instrumental music, "Love's Dream
After the Ball," Misses Byrne, Q. Montgomery, Mulcara, Cavanagh, Wagner, Flatley, Carter, Druby, B. Montgomery, H.
Kearney (pianos, guitars, mandolins, banjo autoharp pianos recitation, "The Flag." Miss Q. Montgomery; chorus, "Freedom
Forever"; presentation of flag, Miss M. B. Mulcare; acceptance of flag In the name of the sisters, Very Rev. J. Prendergast:
remarks. Colonel Sullivan; hoisting of flag; grand chorus by League of tho Cross Cadets.
Rev. Father Prendergast's address was an eloquent recital of the higher grounds of patriotism. Among other
things he said that all the heroes were not those who went on the field of battle with sword and gun. He said there
were thousands of old soldiers who would bear testimony to the fact that the work done by sisters on the field of
battle as well as among the orphans and the needy was as heroic as any done on the field where men fall amid
shot and shell.
Colonel William P. Sullivan Jr. made an able address on behalf of the military department of the country
He said that the country's war at piesent was a most just one. Heroes in and out of the church were rushing to
the front to offer their lives for the land they love. He had' noticed that none of the A. P. A. crowd were very
conspicuous. He thought they had possibly got alarmed and gone to Canada.
After the ceremonies In the convent there was a beautiful scene in tho garden. The handsome flag was
raised amid cheers. Every man took off his hat, and the League of the Cross Cadets of Company A saluted af
ter which the choir of young ladies sang "The Star Spangled Banner" in a touching way. Three cheers were then
given for the flag, after which the company dispersed.
"The Star Spangled Banner" was the subject of a very patriotic sermon yesterday morning by Rev Mr Morn
land of St. Luke's Episcopal Church, corner of Van Ness Avenue and Clay stre?t. Among the congregation weie
the officers and quite a number of men of the two battalions of the First Regiment of North Dakota volunteers
to whom the sermon was of special Interest, as Colonel Peake, commanding their regiment, is the son of a former

"Thou hast given a banner to them that f>ar Thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth " was Rev
Mr. Moreland's text, taken from the sixtieth psalm, fourth verse. The anniversary of the adoption of the Â«?tnra
and stripes will be celebrated next Tuesday, and the historical sketch given by Mr. Moreland was, therefore very
timely. â  ' *
"He must be cold indeed who can look upon the folds of our flag rippling in the breeze, without DridÂ« of
country," said the speaker. "If seen in foreign lands the flag is companionship and like a hand stretched mil
from home. Who can think of it as representing a single State? It is the image of a whole nation It has
been called 'a floating piece of poetry.' The very colors have a languageâ the white for purity the red for Ln ,
and the blue for justice. The flag stands for freedom, but not for lawlessness." >aior,
Rerv. Mr. Moreland seemed to take much pride in stating the fact that Francis Scott Key author nt +*,Â»â¢ -~
of "The Star Spangled Banner," was an Episcopalian. * ' ttuinor or the song
SOLEMNIZATION OF
CORPUS CHRISTI
IMPRESSIVE SERVICE IN THE
CATHOLIC CHURCHES.
ThÂ© Object of the Feast and Its
Origin â Forty Hours' Devotion
at the Cathedral.
The feast of Corpus Christi was cele
brated In the Catholic churches through
out the city yesterday with special and
Impressive solemnity.
The celebration, which has it origin in
the institution of the Eucharist the night
before the death of Christ (Holy Thurs
day)! is deferred from special observance
from holy week until the first Sunday
after Pentecost that k might be more fit
tingly celebrated. The ceremony is es
sentially a work of the church. In the
thirteenth century there was only one
Eucharistic feast, that of Holy Thursday.
In 1246, however, a special feast was es
tablished in honor of the Eucharist. A
sacred bull was issued by Pope Urban IV
and subsequently confirmed by Clement
V, commanding the celebration of a spe
cial feast on the Thursday fonowing the
first Sunday of Pentecost. The day,
however, has been changed from Thurs
day to Sunday for observance and Is no
longer one of the holy days of obligation
in the Catholic Church.
The services yesterday at St. Mary's
Cathedral were doubly Impressive, as
combined with the celebration of Corpus
Chrlstl was the observance of the forty
hours' devotion. Solemn high mass was
solemnized at 11 o'clock by the Rev.
Father Hannigan, assisted by Father
Ramm as deacon and Father Dempsey
as sub-deacon. An eloquent sermon on
the subject of the Holy Eucharist and
the object of the celebration of its in
stitution as a special feast was delivered
by the Rev. J. Prendergast.
Immediately after mass a procession of
little children was formed and led through
the aisles of the church by the clergy,
thÂ© brothers from the Sacred Heart Col
lege and fifty acolytes.
The celebration of the forty hours' do
votion will continue until to-morrow
morning, when It will be concluded with
a solemn high mass. There will be spe
cial devotion this evening, consisting of
the recital of the rosary, benediction and
a sermon. During the entire ceremony
the sacred host will be exposed in the
monstrance over the tabernacle of the
high altar.
At St. Ignatius Church solmen high
mass was observed In the morning at
10:30 o'clock, followed In the evening by
the solemnization of high vespers and a
procession of the priests, brothers and
representatives from the various sodalities
of the church.
At the Metropolitan Temple to-night
Professor Windsor will commence his
series of free lectures on phrenology. He
will make public examinations each night*
PRINTERS DECLARE
THE STRIKE OFF.
RESCIND THE ACTION TAKEN
AGAINST MANY FIRMS.
Hard Times and a Desire to Benefit
Sympathetic Employers Re
sponsible.
Workers in the printing trades who for
ten weeks past have been out on strike
against a number of printing offices which
refused to grant the nine-hour work day,
yesterday determined to acceed to the de
mands of the employers and labor an
hour longer, or ten hours a- day. This
action was determined upon by the Typo :
graphical Union at a meeting held at 32
O'Farrell street, and many trades unions
that held meetings in the same building
but in adjoining halls agreed upon a
similar course.
For ten weeks the printers held out
against the employers and refused to
rescind their action declaring a strike
against those who refused to grant the
P' n e-nour day. The offices against which
tne strike was made, however, managed
to do a small business with the aid of
non-union printers. They manifested no
weakness in spirit, and as large benefit
funds had to be paid out to the striking
printers who knew no other way of mak
ing a living except by their trade, it was
thought best to declare the strike off. By
the action of the union yesterday, how
ever, it is almost certain that all those
who went out on strike will again find
employment in the offices they deserted.
All the establishments which recognized
the rights of their employes and ran on a
nine-hour basis will now go back to the
old-time schedule of ten hours. A vote of
thanks will be forwarded to them for
their action in shortening the time of
labor during the strike. To-day the
printers will return to their cases, but if
perchance some are refused employment
the union will pay them benefits until the
hard times have passed.
A JEWELER'S STORE ROBBED.
A Bold Burglar Plays Havoc With
Hertz's Valuables.
A bold burglary was committed Satur
day night in J. Hertz's jewelry store at
134 Second street.
Shortly after 10 o'clock a special police
officer saw two men leaving the place,
but thinking they were employed by
Hertz he allowed them to get away with
out attempting to question them. When
the proprietor visited the store yesterday
morning he discovered that an entrance
had been effected and various articles of
jewelry taken. He at once informed Po
lice Officer Orr, whose beat is on Seco.nd
street, and the latter proceeded to make
an investigation. After an examination
of the premises the policeman found that
the burglars had first entered the house
adjoining and were forced to scale a high
board fence in order to reach the jew
elry store. While one of them apparently
kept watch the other, with the aid of a
Jimmy, broke the lock.
He then entered the store and helped
himself to a miscellaneous assortment of
watches and chains and about 100 valu
able stones.
Charged With Burglary.
J. D. McCarthy, an old blacksmith, was
arrested yesterday by Special Officer
Fitzgerald on the charge of breaking into
the basement of a house on First street
and stealing an empty demijohn, a small
basket and a roll of butter and some oth
er provisions. McCarthy said that the
lady of the house gave him the articles
as he was hungry and asked her for
something to eat. This explanation did
not satisfy the special officer, so he ar
rested the old man for burglary.
