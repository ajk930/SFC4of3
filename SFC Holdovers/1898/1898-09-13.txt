CUTTER BEAR BACK FROM THE
ARCTIC WITH RESCUED WHALERS
When, iate in October of last year, the startling and appalling news was brought to this city
the whalers Belvedere, Jessie H. Freeman, Rosario and Orca were imprisoned in the impenetrable
the Arctic, near Point Barrow, and that the scores of men aboard them were in danger of perish
ing from lack of food and supplies necessary to enable them to withstand the rigors of an Arctic win
?r. The Call immediately made application to the authorities at Washington to send an expedition to
the relief of the endangered vessels of the whaling fleet and their ciews.
.The reply came back that such an expedition could not be fitted out without an appropriation by
Dngress for the purchase of the food, clothing and other supplies that were considered absolutely
necessary under the circumstances.
Without wasting further time either in argument or appeal The Call notified the authorities that
jf the vessel were furnished by the Government The Call would supply all the necessary provisions,

Bear has just arrived here on her re
turn from the expedition for the relief
of the whaling vessels that were caught
In the ice last fall in the Arctic Ocean.
Fhe has on board Lieutenants Jarvis
and Bertholf and Dr. Call, composing
the relief party, and ninety-one mem

were wrecked, including the crew of
the schooner Louise J. Kenney, nine

at Point Hope last spring.
We are bound for Seattle instead of

on her trip north, and the shipwrecked
men will be landed there. Most of

them are in a destitute condltio'n, hav
ing little or no wages coming to them,
and being badly off for clothing. Some
of them are still wearing skin clothes,
having nothing else, and nearly all are
wearing skin boots. The Bear took up
a supply of underclothes, but she had
no outer clothes on board, and although
the officers of the vessel gave all
theirs they could spare, that supply
was inconsiderable, and did not begin
to go round.
When the men came aboard the Bear
after she reached Cape Smyth there
were 119 in all. Twelve of these ex
changed places with a like number
from the Fearless and eighteen shipped
on other vessels of the whaling fleet.

they reached St. Michael and two oth
ers shinned on the English ship Illala
at Dutch Harbor, thus leaving ninety
one now aboard.
There have been no casualties on the
trip down, although several of the men
are sick, having developed different
diseases on the vessels they came from.
The Kenney referred to as having
been ashore at Point Hope was a trad
ing schooner and had anchored off
Point Hope on the 13th of August. On
the 18th a southwest gale sprang up
and the following day she dragged her
anchor until the cables parted and she
finally went ashore on the 19th. When
we reached there she had been dragged
a wreck and sold and we took the offi
cers and crew aboard.
Besides the loss of the Orca and Frse
man last fall, an account of which the
readers of The Call have already had,
the schooner Rosarlo was the only
other vessel that was crushed In the
Ice. The other vessels â the Newport,
Jeanette, Fearless and Belvedereâ are
all out and either on their way down
or have continued on their whaling
cruise. The Wanderer, which went
into Tlerschel Island last fall when she
found she could not get out, was known
to be safe but had not put in an ap
pearance when we left Cape Smyth on
the 16th of August.
We have aboard Captain Newth of
the Jeanette, who was taken sick at
Cape Smyth and decided to come down,
turning his vessel over to Thomas Ellis,
clothing, food and everything else the Government was not in a position to supply without action by
Congress.
Word came afterward that another department than that originally applied to could supply the
requisites for this humanitarian enterprise. But when the expedition was being prepared it was learned
that the Government officers were unable to provide the proper kind of food and clothing.
Again The Call stepped into the breach and made good every deficiency, in order that the rescu
ers might go adequately equipped in every particular.
At an expense of something like $8000 to The Call the Bear's equipment for the purpose of her
voyage was rendered as nearly perfect as human foresight and energy could make it. Besides this The
Call supplied a surgeon in the person of Dr. Woodruff to care for the sick, and also contributed medi
cines and surgical instruments.
With the return of the Bear to safety with nearly 100 of the rescued whalers, the full fruition
of the glorious expedition which originated with The Call has been recorded.

all the shipwrecked sailors on board
the Bear is lying jammed in the ice off
Point Barrow as solidly as any of the
vessels here have been Jammed during
the winter. We arrived here on the
26th of July, got nipped between the
shore ice and the drift, backed up by
the pack, on August 2, and are now
waiting as patiently as may be, ready
to steam out should occasion offer:
ready to go ashore and wait for the
customary Arctic relief expedition for
the relief of the first Arctic relief expe
dition if it should turn out that way.
We have a large supply of provisions
on deck, ready to dump them on the ice
if we are crushed. Our propeller is
Jammed so that it cannot be moved and
the ship herself Is Immovably fixed in
the Ice. We cannot budge her an Inch
with all the lines we have.
We left St. Michael on July 7. Father
Barnum, a Jesuit missionary from the
Yukon River, came with us as a guest
of Captain Tuttle. He is on his way to
the States, but before going down ,he
wished to see something of the â¢nm'th
ern part of Alaska. I never knew a
better shipmate than Father Barnum.
On the night of July 3 the icepack
swung In toward the point. The Rosa
rio was fast in the ice and apparently
with a good chance of getting out. She
lay about a mile and a half to the

ABOARD THE ARCTIC RELIEF
STEAMSHIP BEAR, off Cape Blossom,
Kotzebue Sound, Aug. 21, via Victoria,
B. C, Sept. 12. â When I wrote
from Cape Smith the Bear was
Imprisoned in the Arctic ice
with little or no prospect of getting out.
On August 14, two days after I wrrte,
there were indications that the ice
might clear out. The current off
shore acted on by a moderate southwest
wind, began to run to the northward
at the rate of one or two knots an hour.
That means that between twenty-four
and forty-eight - M es of ice t ould move
by in a day. By the night of the 14th
the southern horizon looked as if there
were water instead of ice under it, and
on the morning of the 15th the open
water reached as far as we could see
from the south to the north, even past
Point Barrow; yet the Bear and the
Jeannette were packed in as immovably
as ever. Clear water lay within two
hundred yards of us, but the drift ice
in the little harbor where we lay would
not budge.
The wind hauled to the northeast and
we thought it might carry the lac out
into the current, but it did not). We
could see, however, that the ice might
be cleaned out if we could start the
outside pieces and then gradually work
in toward the ships, so the Fearless, at
Captain McKenna's own volition, and
the Newport, at Captain Tuttle's re
quest, found a passage around the
south of the shore floe and tried to
haul out some of the key pieces that
were wedging the ice in upon us. Heavy
ice soon began to break off from the
floe and they got out of the way, hav
ing been able to do nothing. The next
morning the Newport came up to help
us.
â Meanwhile the ice tiad cleared away
so that we had open water within fifty
yards outside of us. The ice had stack
ed up so that we were able to haul the
ship forward about four feet. Then we
moved the propeller slowly and finally
got it clear with ice chisels. Then we
moved back and forth in the little hole
that we had made for ourselves, enlarg-
ing it little by little.
At 7 a. m. the Jeanette got clear and
steamed out. She anchored with the
Fearless about five miles to the south
ward, inside the protection of the
ground ice.
Meanwhile we had a party out on the
ice blasting some of the outer pieces.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The Newport made fast to one of the
cakes, tried to pull it out but parted
the line. Then we blew it out with
gunpowder, but it floated back again.
The Newport was just heading in to
ram it when the Bear made one final
effort and pushed her way out into
the open water, narrowly escaping be
ing rammed by the Newport, which
sheered off Ju t in time. Picking up
the men on the ice, we steamed down
and anchored near the Fearless and
Jeanette. We got clear of. the ice just
at noon.
That night we gave fifteen tons of
coal to the Fearless, which hauled
alongside of us. The Jeanette, in com
mand of Cap*iin Thomas Ellis,
steamer! off to go to Herschell Island,
whaling and trading. Captain Newth,
who had commanded her thus far, hav
ing become 111, came aboard the Bear
to go home. He has since recovered
under the care of Dr. Call.
The Newport started southward, but
anchored about seven miles away. On
the morning of the 17th the Fearless
went down inside tho shore Jce to Join
the Newport. Soon the Bear started
down outside the floe. There was clear
water inside, but the ice began to get
thicker where we were so we tried to
get down inside ourselves. We soon
got agTound, h "â¢ever, and had to back
out. We went out into fairly thick ice
which soon opened, leaving the way
practically clear for us as far as the
Sea Horse Islands. Reaching there at
night we found the whalers Newport,
Fearless, Karluk, Alexander, Bowhead,
William Baylies and the Belvedere,
which had been down to Port Clarence
after coal. The schooner Bonanza, with
supplies for Point Barrow, was lying
there, and the bark Alice Knowles
came in during the night. We had left
the Jeanette at Cape Smith.
On the ISth we left the Sea Horse
Islands and have seen no ice since. Ar
riving at Point Hope on the morning
of the 20th we found that the Louise
J. Kenney had come up with supplies
for the missionaries at Cape Blossom
and other places. It had also brought
up some Laplanders with orders from
Dr. Shelton Jackson, agent of educa
tion for Alaska, to take the deer at
Point Barrow and those at Point Hope,
join the two herds and keep them
through the winter at the Pitmagea
River. That does not look like re
turning the deer to the people who8
loaned them to the Government, nor
can anybody get any benefit from them
this winter. Besides Mr. Loppâ and
no one knows better than he? â says
the Pitmagea country is not a good
place for the herd. It would be better
tn leave the deer in charge of native
herders where they arc now. The
splendid success of the native herders
in driving the deer to Point Barrow
contrasts so favorably with the failure
of the expedition to the Yukon in
charge of Laplanders that it appears
to be a pity that natives should be sup
planted by foreigners.
The Kenney, which had sailed by
Cape Blossom without landing her
cargo there, had droned ashore the
night before we arrived. She had filled
with water. The master h;id aban
doned her and had sold her and her
cargo for $250. There is said to have
been more than that value of Whale
bone alone in the eorgo. He did net
ask fr>r assistance to haul the vessel
off the beach, nor did the man who
b.iucht her. We took the crew and
the officers off ***. beach through tlv
surf, and I arted for Kotzebue Sound.
arriving here this morning.
Lieut .ant Bertholf, who had spent
several days with us during the winter,
went ashore to tell the Rev. Robert
Batnma that no supplies could reach
him this year, as theV^ad been Bold
for the benefit of the insurance com
pany when the vessel was wrecked at
Point Hope. He was offered a passag<
on the Bear to Seattle for himse'-f. his
wife and the Government B<
teacher.
Mr. Samms said he could not see why
the goods had been sold for the benefit
of the insurance company when th-;
had not been insured. He declined t<
leave the suund on the supposition that
the Lord would provide and the cer
tainty that he can get plenty of pro
visions from the miners, who have
given up the search for gold and are
going back. He is going to Point Hope
to see if ho can recover the goods there.
He is sanguine of success, but he will
have a pretty hard crowd to bargai::
with.
A station has bÂ«en established here
by one or more of the transportation
companies to keep the miners supplied.
There will probably be the usual cry
this winter that miners are starving.
There is a chance that Kotzebue Sound
will be the seat of suffering. When
the Bear is sent to their relief in No
romber. I for one do not intend to
volunteer to go on her.

uirfnce the heavy cakes crashed through
1-^r planking and she was a wreck.
Bhey saved everything of value and

tame prospect confronts the Bear ii
his ice outside of us does not clear up.
On July 9 the Bear reached Port
Clarence. It was clear of ice and the
vhaling fleet was congregated there,
raiting for a coal vessel. There were
.lso the Alaska, Jane Falkinberg, Mer
naid, Leslie D and Willard Ainsworth,
illed with people bound for Kotzebup
Sound and waiting there because their
nasters believed that the sound was
Illed with ice, and did not have enter
irise enough to go up there and see for
hemselves. Cogan on the Alaska had
I good excuse for delaying, because he
lad Just run up to Port Clarence for
vater and could not get into Kotzebue
Sound until the sternwheel steamer
r ohn Riley was completed. On the 10th
le started for St. Lawrence Island
ihere the steamer was building.
We cleaned our boiler preparatory
'or the northern trip, filled up with
vater and left Port Clarence at 11:30
>. m. on the 12th. At Port Clarence As
istant Engineer Wood found a mineral
ipring whose waters are very like the
tohannes water. That spring would be
vorth a fortune in a more accessible
ilace.
Beveral of us went in swimming in
i stream near where we watered ship.
The water was fairly warm in spite of
he fart that you could find solid ice
>y digging four feet beneath the sur
lace of the ground anywhere around
.here.
The next morning after leaving Port
Clarence we stopped at Cape Prince of
A' ales for an hour or so and then went
nto the Arctic Ocean. It was a beau
.iful day, almost calm and the heat
vas really uncomfortable. It seemed
is much like cruising in the Caribbean
Jea as in the Arctic Ocean. There was
i strong current setting to the north-
Far-, but following the coast line. This
turrent had cleared out all the ice from
.hat part of the ocean. In Kotzebue
Sound I saw one little cluster of ice
akes left behind in the general exodus.
Ne saw no ice worth mentioning until
SOME OF THE MEN WHO REPRESENT THE CALL ON THE BEAR.
â¢ IEUTENANT JOHN G. BERRY,
rnrresoondent.
' we reached Cape Lisburne, twenty-five
miles north of Point Hope, and no ice
to bother us until we anchored behind
Blossom Shoals at Icy Cape.
On the 14th of July we got to Cape
Blossom in Kotzebue Sound. There we
found the Guardian, Northern Light,
Leslie D. and several little schooners,
apparently hardly large enough to
navigate San Francisco Bay. Yet these
little fellows had the cheek to start
from California and Washington ports
to come away up here. And they got
I hore, too, which makes their presump-
I tion still worse.
Those vesse: had been here since the
Fourth of July and many men had
gone vi the river. But the main body
of miners was waiting for the river
steamers, four In number, that were to
be towed up by sailing vessels. Every -
I body was jubilant and hopeful. There
h 1 been no gold In evidence. The na
tives had no nug-sts, no gold dust. The
! missionaries had not seen any, but the
] miners were confident of success just
I the sam â¢. The Lord is said to pay par
; ticular attention to people like these,
I who will start out on such an expedi
! rion with nothing to go on but the
shadow of a rumor.
Before leaving Seattle one man, a
doctor of medicine, wrote asking me
about the truth of the stories regarding
Kotzebue Sound and the probability of
success there. I answered that every
story I had heard so far and had been
ible to sift down was false; that the
:fÃcers of the Bear had not located
claims there and Captain Tuttle had
not grub-staked a native to hunt for
gold. I told him that the rumors of
sold emanated from the whalers. I
suppose he was not acquainted with
any whalers, because he came up here
in ppite of that statement of mine.
Going into Cap Blossom we passed
the Leslie D. and Willard Ainsworth.
'.Vo left that night and found the Cath
erine Sudden and Jane Falkinberg.each
with a little sternwheel steamer in tow,
anchored under Cape Kruzensterne.
They haJ been carried by the current
to the northward, past the entrance to
'.he sound.
At Cape Blossom we found Mr. Til
ton, who brought the first news down
from Point Harrow last winter. He is
chief mate of the Northern Light. We
had on board the Bear Tickey and his
wife, the Point Hope natives who
guided him to St. Michael. Tilton came
over to see hir natives and th<~" went
almost wild in their delight at seeing
him again.
We picked up these natives from the
Bonanza at Port Clarence. They had
come from San Francisco on her. They
declared that they would not dare tell
I the folk 3 at home all they had seen,
because the Point Hope natives can
stand only a reasonable amount of ro
' mancintr. What struck them more for-
I cibly than anything else was "shooting
the chutc-s." They were strutting
around on the ship in San Francisco
clothes until we neared Point Hope,
when they began to "shuck" them and
come out in their skin clothing. We
reached Point Hope on the evening of
the 15th and the two natives went
ashore. It transpired later that some
body at Point Clarence had given them
a bottle of whisky with instructions
not to drink it while on the Bear, but
the moment they touched the beach
Mr. and Mrs. Tickey got gloriously
drunk to the envy of their admiring
neighbors.
Here Lieutenant E. P. Bertholf came
on board. He was in excellent health
and declared that he had passed a
pleasant winter. The only thing that
troubled him seriously in his long
sled trip was the poor fare that he had
in many places. The extreme cold was
not so disagreeable, because it was al
ways calm when the thermometer
went away down. But the blizzards,
' with their moderately low tempera
! ture, were decidedly uncomfortable.
Bertholf has made more progress in
- learning the language than anybody I
I have ever seen who has spent such a
, short time in the country. He was
'. Just beginning to get at the true
! language of the natives. He says they
i talk to the white man in a language
like our pigeon English. He mastered
that all right and was beginning to get
at some of the moods and tenses when
we arrived. Mr. Lopp at Cape Prince
of Wales speaks the language of the
natives. Scarcely any other white
man in the country does that. Charley
Peterson, an old employe of the Alaska
Commercial Company on the Yukon
River, talks like a native, but he is no
grammarian and cannot explain the
language to the other whites.
Father Barnum is the man
who will finally codify the
language. He has worked like
the men who decipher hieroglyphic in
scriptions. He has in his manuscript
enough of the language to give it to
the civilized world and hopes to com
plete his work and publish it before
many years.
According to Father Barnum, the
language is exceptionally rich, like the
Greek. Its action expresses itself in
terminations. There are no detached
adjectives or adverbs. The whole thing
appears to go into the verb. To every
verb there are 3537 forms, while the
Greek verbs run up to about 1400 only.
Father Barnum says the language is

TWELVE HUNDRED GOLD
SEEKERS ARE STRANDED
AT KOTZEBUE SOUND
BY LIEUTENANT JOHN G. BERRY, UNITED STATES REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE.
ABOARD THE ARCTIC RELIEF STEAMSHIP BEAR, off Cape Blossom, Kotzebue Sound, Aug. 21, via
"Victoria, Sept. 12. â No, we are not In Kotzebue Sound hurfting for gold, but we are finding just as much as
are those people who came here for it â and that is none. For a month and a half gold seekers have been
arriving here in all sorts of vessels. They brought more provisions, as a rule, than the majority of Yu
kon miners take. Some, to be sure, are even short of food considering the length of time they must neces
sarily be out of communication with the rest of the world, but I should judge these are so few that there
will be no danger of starvation this winter at this place.
It is estimated that at least 1200 men have landed here. Most of them have gone up the Kowak River.
A few have gone up the Salawwik, and about 400 have returned to Cape Blossom and are here now, wait
ing for a chance to return to civilization. Men have been 350 miles up the Kowak River. They report that
the river is all mud. What sand they found gave only the slightest trace or color of gold. Of the 1200
seekers not one has struck enough gold to pay. for his daily flapjacks and salt pork.
The gold fever appears to have passed the epidemic stage in Kotzebue Sound. The patients are conva
lescing rapidly, but are now in a state of extreme depression. Probably as many as 900 of them will return
this year to the States and will be ready next year to start on a balloon trip to Saturn if some astronomer
will kindly let them know that there are precious metals there. This Kotzebue Sound boom has been al
most as crazy as that would be.
The Kotzebue Sound boom has stuck in the mud of the Kowak River. It is a very swiftly flowing
stream â dangerously swift for the small boats that they are towing up there. Hotham Inlet, which must be
crossed before they can even enter the mouths of the river, is shallow, and so rough that the prospectors,
in some cases, do not dare to go out on its waters in steam launches. Some of them, who had planned to
take their goods up the river with the launches, have had to change their minds, and they are forced to
pay the little river boats $40 a ton to get the supplies 250 miles up the river. Seven men, so far, have
lost their lives in trying to tow their dories and other small boats up the river. I have been unable to
get the names of all, but I hear that Miller and Scott of Boston, and Moore of Dubuque, are among those
lost. Twenty-eight men have lost all their suppMes by the capsizing of boats in the rapid currents of the
river, and there is not an ounce of gold to offset this weight of calamity.
Four stern-wheel river steamers are running and each has made several trips up and down the river.
At first they ran up full and came down empty. Now they are loaded on the trip down. The vessels
here, having brought the people up for about $100 a head, will now get from $40 to $60 apiece for taking
three-quarters of the number back, and the poor fellows will have lost nearly a year's work at home. In
most cases they had sp^nt their last dollar to outfit them for spending the winter in an Arctic climate.
They will have to sell their remaining stock of provisions to more fortunate companions in order to pay
their fares down, and they will land without a cent in the States. Those who remain will be able to get
the stores of the others at little cost, and the chances are that there will be little suffering, if any. Yet
very few of them are supplied with proper clothing for the climate.
A man named Gordon, from Provincetown, Mass., saLd that Pickett, who claims to have discovered
the Treadwell at Juneau, Alaska, reports that there is no chance for gold on any of the rivers emptying
into Kotzebue Probably the only chance that the prospectors have of success is to cross over to
the headwaters' of some of the tributaries of the Yukon River. We know there is gold there. There may
be a chance even now on the Kowak, but it would seem certain that some of the 1200 men who have been
searching every nook of the river for a month must have found gold if there was any there.
The twenty-eight men who lost their provisions are destitute on the beach here. Many of them ap
plied to Lieutenant Bertholf, who went ashore, aslflng to be taken down on the Bear; but our orders are to
take down none but ship-wrecked seamen, and he had to leave them on the beach.

"aa regular as a chess board." There
are only twenty-one forms in the de
clension of the nouns, so that any one
who wishes to become proficient has
only to learn the roots and the 3537
verbal forms, then accustom his ear to
the sound of them all. Then he can
talk with the children. They speak
the language prettily and correctly.
The older people use contracted forms,
which makes it almost another lan
guage to learn. The Eskimos speak
their own language correctly, all of
them, from one end of the Arctic Ocean
to the other. Each district has pe
culiarities in its language on the Yu
kon River. Converse with the natives
of Point Hope or Cape Smyth, and
they do not understand one at first, be
cause they find it difficult to compre
hend how a white man can speak any
other but the gibberish of the coast.
Presently one of them suggests that
the man is really talking the language
properly. Then their faces light up
and they start In to talk correctly and
fluently.
Theodore Borquin, a Frenchman who
studied the language In Labrador, has
published an Eskimo grammar. Father
Barnum says the book Is good, has
plenty of matter, but no system. Bour
quln started with the Idea that the
language was connected in some man
ner with the Hebrew tongue, and that
proposition leads him Into many devi
ous wayÃ.
At Point Hope we saw the midnight
sun for the first time. It had been
daylight all the time since arriving at
St. Lawrence Island on June 19, but
we had not seen the sun Itself at mid
night. We left Point Hope at 4:20
p. m. on July 17. At 11 p. m., off Cape
Lisburne, we sighted lee for the first
time since June In the Bering Sea. On
July 18 we steamed through light scat
tering Ice, pretty well softened by the
fairly warm weather (40 to 50 degrees)
in which It floated. At 1:30 p. m. we
got into clear water, which extended
clear along the coast as far as Icy
Cape. On the morning of July 19 we
picked up a native boat containing
Captain A. C. Sherman of the wrecked
steamer Orca, J. Drynen of the Pa
cific Steam Whaling Company, J. Clark,
second mate of the Jessie H. Freeman,
Fred Hobson of Cape Smyth, Oscar
Thompson, Anton Roderick, Pe
ter Nelson and Ivan Elt, "starving
whalers," and two natives. They had
(â¢ome down to get the mail from the
strips, but the mail was on the Thrasher
and she has not got here yet, although
Captain Snow confidently predicted
that he would be at least one of the
first to arrive at Cape Smyth. The
whalers now on board say Snow will,
in all probability, be the very last to
arrive. Sherman reported all well at
Point Barrow.
Finding the ice packed on Blossom
Shoals off Icy Cape we anchored to the
southward of the cape on the afternoon
of the 19th. This is one of the last
places south of Point Barrow for the
ice to leave in the summer. Extending
off shore from Icy Cape f< about eight
miles is this patch of shoals, worked up
into ridges with less than three fath
oms of water or. them, while there may
be seven or nine fathoms between the I
rlde-es. But since the ice probably j
changes the position of these ridges <
from year to year it is almost always i
necessary to go out around the whole i
shoal. Sailing vessels have gone i
through because they got caught in the '
shoals and could not beat out of dan- (
ger. The heavy ice grounds here and j
other ice gets jammed in between it, |
a sea of ice extending sometimes from j
one shore to the sea horizon. Once past
the shoals at this season of the .year !
the probability is that fairly clear wa- j
ter will be found as far as the Sea
Horse Islands. Nature makes that an
other stopping place along the north- j
ward road. The islands and shoal ]
around them stop the ice Just as Blos
som Shoals do, and it fills up Pearl
Bay to the northward of the Sea Horse
but generally leaves some kind of a i
harbor in behind the islands. It was j
this harborage that sheltered the Bel- I
vedere last winter and it was toward
that place that the Freeman and Orca
I were heading when the ice nipped i
i them.
On the 20th we tried to get around
outside Blossom Shoals, but Â«~ot too far
to the westward and probably
pretty close to the ice pack, although
we could not distinguish the pack from
the vessel. It is possible that we
might have found a passage in close to
the shore. But out there the Ice be
came more and more thickly packed
until we turned back and anchored off
Point Lay, about fifteen miles to the
southward of le~ Cape.
On the 22d we moved up to Icy Cape
again. On the 23d Lieutenant Hamlett,
A. Svendson, one of the Bear's crew,
with J. A. Clark, Oscar Thompson and
the two natives who came down with
Sherman, left in the native boat to
take on a case of evaporated potatoes
and one case of evaporated onions to
Lieutenant Jarvis and incidentally to
give a few bags of to the Belve
dere at Sea Horse Islands. Finally, on
the 26th, we went out around the shoals.
We did "not go far enough to the west
ward this time, as we got. Into three
fathoms of water (we must have
scraped the bottom at that depth)', and
had to go out still farther. Yet that
made very little difference, as even the
shoals were practically clear of ice by
this time.
At 3 a. m. on the 28th we anchored
off the deserted village of Attanka,
south of Sea Horse, having tried to get
to the northward inside of the shore
ice. That night we steamed all around
the outside of the ridge of shore ice
and went merrily northward. We passed
the Sea Horse and saw the Belvedere
in there, but she appeared to be all
right, and there was considerable ice
between us, so we went on and emerged
into clear water as far as the eye could
reach. This was about 11 p. ,m. The
next morning at 8 we made fast to the.
outside of the shore Ice off Cape Smyth
and had reached the northern limit of
our cruise.
Lieutenant Jarvis came on board as
soon as we reached here. Both he and
Dr. Call were in excellent condition.
There was scarcely any sickness on the
beach, the food was holdine out well
with the exception of butter, which had
been exhausted over a week before.
The herd of reindeer was as large as
when it reached here. The births had
equaled the killings.
Mr. Brewer sent over to the ship
hundreds of ducks that he could spare,
and the whole ship's company, "star-
ving whalers" and all, have lived on
wild duck ever since.
What the people needed here last
winter was somebody who had the
authority to take charge of them and
their affairs and who at the same time
would exercise that authority. Neither
of the masters of the wrecked vessels
would take charge even of his own
crew. Neither Brewer nor Mcllhenny,
though either one was competent to
handle the situation, had the authority
to govern the men. The two captains
claimed that they were wrecked and
that their authority ceased when they
left their vessels. Brewer and Mc
llhenny did take charge, '>ut they had
no way of enforcing their orders. The
men obeyed them or not as they chose.
When Jarvis arrived he supplied the
missing link in the chain of govern
ment. He straightened things out,
made the men work, and he made them
play baseball. If any of them did not
want to play he was promptly hustled
off to drag deer meat and ducks to
camp. A few miles of this work soon
made him willing to "play ball." Jarvis
was strict with them, but they air ap
pear to have liked it. That was just
what they wanted.
On the 29th the steam whaler Jean
nette came along and tied up to the
ice not far from us. She had been de
layed for a long: *me at Port Clar
ence waiting for the coal schooner. On
August 2 the Ice closed in around us
and the Jeanette. We had both mean
while changed our positions and were
in a fairly well sheltered place. It did
not take more than twelve hours for
the ice to come in. We had the whalers
on board, but we were waiting for our
friend the Thrasher, that was to have
reached here before us. On the 3d
the Jeanette. Newport and Fearless
got through the ridge to the north
ward and steamed down to Cape Smyth
Inside the shore ice, where they now lie
In safety, ready to take us down home,
if the Bear is crushed. That after
noon there was a slight movement of
ice that parted five lines, all that we
had out forward, and set the vessel so
hard against a spur of shore ice that
the aide of the ship was pressed in
about an Inch and a half, lifting the
floor plates of the engine-room about
four Inches. The pressure was soon
relieved by chopping away the corner
of the ieÂ» spur. It was not serious oi
Itself, bu was an indication of what
might haipen if the ice really got down \
to business.
â¢ While w> were cutting Ice we were
also gettinj. a large stock of provisions
on deck, ready for abandoning ship.
On the sth aid 6th we gave twelve tons
of coal to thÂ» Newport.
On the 6th and 7th we tried to blast
a passage through the grounded ice in
order to haul he ship through Into the
clear water between the shore and the
ice, but a few hours' trial on the 7th
showed that th. work would take more
powder than w* had on all the vessels
and the attempi was abandoned. The
ice was fully thi'ty feet thick in many
places. This shcre ice is a mass fully
ten miles long", g-ounded in five fath
oms or more of vater. Its average
thickness cannot be less than twenty
feet, and in places it may reach sixty
feet from top U bottom. It is
about 400 yards acioss and lies about
half a mile from th* beach with clear
water outside. We liÂ« between this im
movable mass and the irresistible force
of the ice pack whenever it chooses to
exert itself. Between us and the pack
is drift pretty thickly packed, which
may or may not serve as a bumper to
keep the direct pressure of the pack
from us. Yesterday ani the day be
fore we gave the Fe.nrlest twenty-three
tons of coal. Larp-e cracks are open
ing in the ground ice, and every day or
two the off-shore ice moves to the
northward for a few hours, but the
pressure about us has not been re
laxed. We had only light winds from
all quarters. The northwest wind, on
whifh we rely to clear the i<?e away,
will not blow long enough nor strong
enough to make anyappreclable change
in our condition. To seaward there ia
nothing but ice as far as the eye can
reach. Not a drop of water is visible
in that direction.
It would be a great joke on us if the
Jeanctte had to take us all down to
San Francisco.

SHir BEAR, ST. MICHAEL, Alaska,
Aug. 25, via Victoria, Sept. 12.â We
reached Capo Prince of Wales at night
on August 22 and W. T. Lf.pp came
on board. As we are in a hurry to
get away Mr. Lopp and Lieutenant Jar
vis worked all night arranging to set
tle up the accounts of the overland ev
pedition with the natives. Many of
Jarvis' "I O U's" have not been pre
sented for redemption, but he left the
trade goods with Mr. Lopp, who will
take up the accounts as the natives
come in on behalf of the natives.
Mr. Lopp objected to the scheme of
Rev. Sheldon Jackson for providing for
his Laplanders for the winter. He de

given to the Government, by the per

ELY BROTHEKB, 68 Warren St., New York CltÂ»re urned only 156 doer. There were 160
ai Port Clarence, but four died on the
B*ort drive to Cape Prince of Wales.
These deer are all inferior to those
W.ined to Jarvis. Many of them are
k. There are no sled deer among
l tern. Now, the Government has at
; nalaklik 700 excellent reindeer. The
irplus to be returned ought to come
from that herd and not from the scrub
â â¢â¢r that were collected at St. Law
â¢â¢Mice Ray last winter. The natives
rant their deer back now. Captain Tut
â le wrote to Point Barrow and Point
c directing that the deer at those
ilaoes be turned over to the native
herders who would come from Cape
Prince of Wales for them.
This is the reindeer situation: Re
ceived from W. T. Lopp and natives of
(â¢;ipo Prince of Wales, 294; bought of
Lopp's natives, 9; bought of Charley's
natives, 5; received from Charley at
Point Rodney, 133; Bertholf got from
Ci'vernment herd, 5; Jarvis got from
c.overnment at Golovine Bay, 2; total,
445.
Killed and lost on trip, not counting
34 recovered and driven to Point Hope,
XI; killed for food at Point Barrow ISO,
at Point Hope 10; died at Point Barrow,
1; fawns born at Point Barrow -54, at
Point Hope 25; fawns died or were
trampled to . .th at Point Barrow 64,
â at Point Hope 1; fawns survived. 214;
remaining at Point Barrow 391, at Point
Hope 4S; total remaining, 439.
The hard trip so near the fawning
season (for the fawns began to arrive
soon after the arrival at Puint Bar
row) weakened the cows. Naturally,
herded at home, there would have been
more births and fewer deaths, and the
natives would now have even more deer
than these due them. The Government
is bound to return to them not only the
doer actually lent, but the fawns that
would have been born and have sur
vived had they remained at home.
Not only that, but considering the
privations that they have undergone
this winter the natives should be
treated by the Government not merely
with Jutftice, but with generosity. It
should return to the natives the best
deer that it owns. It should draw
from the herd at Unalaklik, not from
the 'nferior animals at St. Lawrence
â Bay. We cannot know yet whether the
extraordinary drive of 600 miles has
weakened the herd or not; but, taking
the actual survivals, the Government
now owes the natives at Cape Prince
of Wales and Point Rodney 427, in
crease 214; total, 641. Dr. Jackson re
turned 160, less 4 that diedâ ls6, bal
ance 455; at Point Barrow and Point
Hope, 439; still due 46. And some of
the sixty-five fawns that died might
not have died had their mothers not
been weakened by the hard drive to the
frigid zone.
On December 16, 1897. the Laplanders
left Port Clarence with 650 deer and
thpy arrived at Unalaklik, 200 miles
distant, on March 22, 1898, or ninety-six
days. The natives left Cape Prince of
Wales on February 3, 1898, with 448
rteeer, drove them 600 miles In fifty-five
days, arriving at Point Barrow on
March 30, IS9B.
At Cape Prince of Wales, Utenna,
Klvyearkruk. Chucarijhok, Kukera,
Ituk, Tautuk, Sokweena and Keuk we
landed native herders, who had re
mained with the two herds during the
winter. On the 23d we reached Port

Thrasher was there, having got no
farther north than Point Lay. She had
not even grot our mail when she was at

. On the 24th we reached Point Rodney
by way of Kings Island. There we
landed Artisarlook (Charley). Mary,
his wife, one of the most intelligent of
the natives of Alaska, came off with
h^r retinue of natives to receive him.
Khe was "tickled to death" to pet Char
ley back, even if he did not have any
rHndeer with him. When Jarvis asked
f<ir the deer last winter, Mary pre
dicted that Charley would return with
out any deer and that the people would
laugh at him. She meant that he
would never get the deer back. Final
ly some of the deer were given for ser
vices rendered to a few of the natives,
Charley among the number. But to
offset their generosity the Government
herd at Port Clarence was moved down
to Unalaklik, where the Swedish Mis
sion is located. This removed them
farther than ever from the native in
habitants, for whose benefit they were
supposed to have been introduced.
Since Colonel (now General) Ran
dolph at St. Michael had no use for
the deer last winter, it would seem that
they might just as well have been
turned over to the overland relief ex
pedition instead of leaving Jarvis to
depend on the generosity of natives.
The fact that the Eskimo citizens of
the United States responded so nobly
to the appeal of Lieutenant Jarvis, in
the cause of humanity, recommends
them strongly to the gratitude of the
rest of the country. 'They should be
repaid with the best reindeer that can
be obtained and in settling with them
their bravery, devotion and the priva
tions that they and their families in
their absence suffered should weigh
heavily in the scales.

AN EASY VICTORY
FOR REPUBLICANS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 12.â The
State election to-day resulted in tho
success of the full Republican ticket, as
follows:
Governorâ Lewellyn Powers of Houl
ton.
Congressmenâ First District, Thomas
B. Reed of Portland; Second District,
Nelson Dingley of Lewiston; Third
District, Edwin C. Burleigh of Au
gusta; Fourth District, Charles A.
Boutelle of Bangor.
The election was marked by compar
ative apathy on the part of the Repub
licans, who felt sure, while the Demo
crats took more interest with a desire
to make a better showing than in 1894
or 1896, and put some vim in the cam
paign, the result of which was seen in
nearly every town.
Returns from 150 cities and towns
give Powers (R.) 22,613; Lord (D.) 12,
863. The same towns in 1894 gave
Cleveland (R.) 27,728; Johnson (D.) 12,
046.
This shows a net Republican loss of
17 per cent and a Democratic loss of 12
per cent. On this basis Powers will
have about 27,100 plurality.
Speaker Reed's vote shows a falling
off of nearly 4000.
MADEBA SHOOTING AFFRAY.
Creditor Wounded While Seeking to
Collect a Debt.
MADERA, Sept. 12.â As the outcome of
the attempted collection of an old debt,
James Pettitt, a laboring man, was shot
by W. H. Matthews to-day on the Hely
ranch, just south of this place, the ball
from a 38-caliber revolver entering me
right breast.
To-day Matthews drove to the ranch
where Pettit was working. As soon as
Pettitt saw him he left his work, and, ap
proaching Matthews, struck him with Âis
fist, knocking him to the ground. As he
continued the attack Matthews drew a re
volver from his pocket and fired. A sur
geon was summoned and the wounded
man taken to hla home, whore he is re
ported to be resting easy. Matthews sur
rendered himself to the Sheriff.

OTIS' COURSE DENOUNCED
CANDID OPINION AS TO THE
STAND OF HIS TIMES.
Republicans of Southern California
in General Condemn the
Policy of Sunday's
Editorial.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 12.â "The Re
publican party is bigger than any
newspaper or corporation," said a
prominent Republican to-day when
questioned regarding 1 the defection of
the Los Angeles Times in its attack
upon the personnel of the Republicans
of the State Executive Campaign Com
mittee, and this is the sentiment voiced
by every Republican interviewed by
the correspondent of The Call here to
day.
Many of the men seen expressed
themselves against the position of the
Times In the most emphatic language,
and it is the consensus of opinion that
in so far as the local situation is con
cerned the stand taken by the Times
will not in any way affect the result of
j the election. It is well known here that
the fight against certain members of
the executive committee is purely per
sonal and not a single person will ad
mit that the Times is making the fight
in the interest of pure politics at this
time.
Some go so far as to denounce its
action and say that the time has come
when the people of Los Angeles must
take a firm stand and fight out the
issue to the bitter end and once and
for all time settle the question whether
the Times is or is not greater than the
Republican party.
Republicans generally complain bit
terly of the action of the paper in the
past as well as in the present cam
paign, and they are tired of the dicta
torial tactics pursued by it. Even those
who have a kindly feeling for the pa
per condemn the publication of the
editorial in last Sunday's issue as be
ing Injudicious and untimely and detri
mental to the interest of the Repub
lican -^rty throughout the State.
It is expected that some action will
be taken by the Republican county con
vention now in session here, although
a strong effort is being made to head
off any such public condemnation of
the course pursued by the Times. Many
of the persons interviewed signified
their willingness to be quoted later on
as they fear that to do so at this time
might jeopardize the interest of some
of their friends who are candidates for
local offices, and Republicans generally
express the : ope that The Call will
take up the fight in behalf of the party,
which they say has no local paper to
represent its interest in the present
campaign. ,^____^____^^^_
ENTERTAINED BY
COLUMBIA CLUB
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 12.â The Co
lumbia Club entertained over 700 dele
gates of the Republican convention at
their elegant rooms to-night. Refresh
ments were served to all, and a general
good time marked the occasion. The
club is composed of active workers in
the party, and numbers among its
members nearly all of the prominent
Republicans of Los Angeles County.
The officers of the club are young men
of standing in the business community
who never overlook an opportunity to
further the interest of Republicanism.
The organization is a permanent one,
and has already done much to attract
to the party the young voters of the
county. John B. Bushnell, the presi
dent of the club, is not only an active
Republican, but ranks high in the busi
ness circles of the city. He is untiring
in his efforts for party success, and his
ability as a leader is unquestioned.
THREE SHOTS FIRED
AT HOLLAND'S QUEEN
Two Bullets Flew Wide, buÂ£ a Third
Struck the Countess Limburg-
Stirrutt.
BERLIN, Sept. 12.â Persistent rumors
have been current here during the last
few days that, despite all statements to
the contrary, an attempt was made upon
the life of Queen Wilhelmlna about three
weeks ago. One newspaper, which re
ports an account of the affair on the al
leged authority of Count Limburg-Stir
rutt, says that an Italian fanatic fired
thrice from the woods while the Queen
with three ladles was driving near her
residence at Soestdyk. Two shots went
wide, but the third lodged in the arm of
the Countess Llmburg-Stlrrutt.
The Queen preserved her presence of
mind and had the affair kept a strict se
cret, owing to the approaching enthrone
ment. The would-be assassin was ar
restedâso the story goesâ and confessed
himself as an anarchist. Countess L<im
burg-Stirrutt is recovering.

day's session definitely adopted the His
pano-American protocol.

plied: "Very well, as you wish, I will.
The generals to whom I referred are Gen

limbs, which had been separated from the
body, unjointed and cut in two at the

a strong glazed paper. Tlie head of the
woman was a little red and jammed on
one side, and had a cloth tied over the
mouth.
STATE FAIR'S SUCCESS.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 12.â The attend
ance at the pavilion to-night justifies the
expectation that the fair will be visited
nightly until its close by thousands of peo
ple. The Immense interior of the exposi
tion building presents a picture that is
certainly attractive. All about are glis
tening lights and bright banners, setting
off a wide variety of exhibits. The pres
ence of hundreds of fair women, dressed
in the light attire which the genial valley
climate allows, adds all that during the
early days of the fair had been wanting
to make its success complete.
All the fresh fruit eirhibits that had
been in place during the week have been
replaced and many new ones added.
A feature of the fair that is unpreten
tious and yet merits repeated tours of in
spection is the annex devoted to the dis
play of fine fowl. Chicken fanciers es
pecially find much to interest them there.

CONSIDERS THE
SITUATION YET
VERY CRITICAL
Dewey Asks That Two More
War Vessels Be Sent
to Manila.
Aguinaldo Speaks of Plans for Independence
and Pretends Friendship for
Americans.
MADRID, Sept. 12. â Captain Aunon, Minister of Marine, received
to-day an important dispatch from the Philippines describing a con
flict between the Spanish gunboats and an insurgent flotilla, in which
the former successfully prevented an insurgent landing in t*"? Vis
cayas. According to the dispatch the insurgents had five vessels, all
of which were sunk. The Spanish had no loss, but the telegram as
serts that hundreds of the Insurgents are believed to have perished.
MANILA, Sept. 12.â Rear Admiral
Dewey says he considers the situation
critical. It is understood he has asked
for an additional cruiser and a battle
ship. The Spaniards assert that Ger
many will take a coaling station here
and that Spain will retain the remain
der of the islands. The last Spanish
garrisons at Ilocos and Laguna have
surrendered and the whole island of
Luzon is said to be in the hands of in
surgents, except Manila and Cavite.
Aguinaldo went to Lelollos on Friday.
He has announced his intention of con
vening an assembly of the Filipinos on
September 15, in order to decide upon
the policy to be adopted by the insur
gents. The correspondent here of the
Associated Press has had an interview
with Aguinaldo. who said there were
67,000 insurgents armed with rifles. He
added he could raise 100,000 men. In
: deed, the Insurgent leader pointed out,
i the whole population of the Philippine
| Islands was willing to fight for their in
dependence.
Continuing. Aguinaldo said he had
9000 military prisoners, including 5000
in the vicinity of Manila, besides civil
! prisoners. Later Aguinaldo said the
"provisional government- was now op
erating twenty-eight provinces. He
asserted that on August 2 they elected
delegates in numbers proportionate to
the population.
As to the Americans, Aguinaldo re
marked that he considered them as
brothers; that "the two sovereign re
publics were allied against a common
enemy."
When questioned as to whether the
future Filipino policy would be abso
lute independence, Aguinaldo excused
himself from replying and asked what
America intends to do.
The correspondent being unable to
i answer this question, Aguinaldo con-
U "We have been fighting for independ
ence for a long time. The natives who
profess to favor annexation are insin
cere It is merely a ruse to ascertain
A Asked an if Vi th:' 8 -Filipinos would object
i to the retention of Manila Aguinaldo
declined to answer. A ma ~
"Would the Filipinos object to Amer
icans retaining a coaling station If
recognizing the independence of the
! islands or establishing a temporary
! protectorate over them?" Aguinaldo
again refused to answer.
Pending the conclusion of the as
i sembly Aguinaldo said he was confi
dent there would be no trouble between
America and the Filipinos. The insur
gent leader denied having received a
request from General Otis and Rear
I Admiral Dewey to withdraw his troops
i to a prescribed distance fro-m Manila
and Cavite, and he declined to discuss
the effect of such a request
Aguinaldo further asserted that he
had never conferred with the American
authorities since the capitulation of
| Manila, and that he had never author
ized the insurgents to search or dis
arm Americans crossing the line.
The correspondent closely questioned
him about last Saturday's incident,
when the Pennsylvania troops pro
ceeded to establish a new outpost. The
Filipinos objected and nearly precipi
tated hostilities, ordering the Ameri
cans to withdraw in twenty minutes.
They issued ammunition and inter
cepted the American reinforcements.
Finally General Hale ordered all the
Pennsylvanians to advance and the
rebels withdrew.
The local Governor has explained
that the incident was a complete mis
take and has repudiated his subordi
nates' action. Aguinaldo declared to
the correspondent that the Filipino
who made the trouble merely pretended
to be an officer and is entirely uncon
nected with the insurgent army. Aguin
aldo complained that the Spaniards
were "disseminating false reports for
the purpose of fomenting antagonism
between the Filipinos and the Ameri-
a The whale interview conveyed the
impression that Aguinaldo desires ab
solute independence, regards the mis
sion of thÂ« Americans here as accom
plished and expects their withdrawal,
"just as the French with Lafayette
withdrew after helping the Americans
in the war of independence, a war of
humanity." , , . . ._
Just now Aguinaldo maintains the
role of extreme friendship.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12.â The Mad
rid dispatch in regard to the American
reply to the Spanish note protesting
against hostilities on the part of the
insurgents of the Philippine Islands
was shown to the first secretary of the
French Embassy. He said that Em
bassador Cambon had been absent
from Washington several weeks and
the reply was not sent by him person
ally. If such a reply had been made it
would have gone through the hands of
the first secretary, but he declined
positively to say whether or not he had
forwarded a message of such charac
ter. The officials of the State Depart
ment also refused to make known the
nature of the communications ex
changed between the two governments
regarding this matter. It is known,
however, that in response to urgent ap
peals of the Spanish Government to
protect the Spaniards living in the
Philippines from the insurgents during
the continuance of the truce now in
force. General Otis was instructed to
use his influence with the insurgent
leaders to cause them to stop active
hostilities for the time. Touching the
departure from Manila of insurgent
parties on ships to carry the revolution
among the other islands of the group
it is learned that no such expeditions
have been sent out since the signing
of the protocol and the incident which
formed the basis of the Spanish repre
sentations on the subject happened
some time ago. when it was warranted.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Acting Secretary of the
Navy Allen said to-night that Rear
Admiral Dewey has not repeated his
request of several weeks ago for the
assignment of a battleship and an
armored cruiser to his squadron. The
Oregon and lowa have been ordered to
the Pacific, and will go to Manila as
soon as Rear Admiral Dewey so re
quests.
GENERAL OTIS NEEDS
HIS SIGNAL CORPS
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Although the
authorities are reticent, it can be confi
dently stated that within the last two
days cable advices have come from Gen
eral Otis to the War Department saying
that his signal corps must remain intact
in view of further possible trouble with
the Aguinaldo element. The intention had
been to send part of the signal service
force to Hawaii, but this protest from
General Otis puts a stop to this inten
tion.
REPLY TO THE PROTEST
AGAINST HOSTILITIES
MADRID, Sept. 12.â The French Era
bassador at Washington, M. Cambon, who
has been acting for Spain in the peace ne
gotiations, has cabled to the government
the American reply to the Spanish protest
against hostilities on the part of the in
surgents in the Philippines in spite of the
peace protocol. The United States prom
ises to send envoys to induce the Togallos
to respect the suspension of hostilities
and to prevent vessels leaving Manila
with insurgents for the purpose of propa
gating the insurrection in other islands.
REPRESENTATIVE
REPUBLICANS
IN CONVENTION
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGEL.ES, Sept. 12.â The Re
publican county convention was called
to order by Bradner W. Lee, chairman
of the County Central Committee, at
10:30 a, m. to-day and the convention
Immediately proceeded to the election
of a temporary chairman. The leading
candidates for the honor were ex-
Judare John D. Works and E. A. Me
serve, the latter being selected by a
rising vote, which was made unani
mous. D. C. McGarvin, D. W. Dunham
and Major C. M. Fairbanks were elect
ed temporary secretaries.
On motion of W. R. Bacon the chair
man was authorized to name three
committees, fifteen on credentials, fif
teen on organization and order of busi
ness and five on platform and resolu
tions. The convention then adjourned
until 2 p. m.
Promptly at 2 p. m. the convention
was called to order, pursuant of ad
journment, by Lewis Thorn, secretary
of the County Central Committee, who
announced that the chairman of the
convention desired more time to com
plete the appointment of members on
the three committees named. On mo
tion the convention took a recess until
4 p. m., at which hour the names of the
members of the three committees were
announced and the convention ad
journed until 8 p. m. for the purpose
of giving the committees time to re
port. Previous to adjournment, how
ever, a motion was carried to the effect
that all resolutions must be presented
to the committee on resolutions and
without debate.
The committees not being ready to
report when the convention was called
to order at 8 p. m., It adjourned until 9
a. m. to-morrow.
The convention Is perhaps one of the
most representative bodies of Repub
licans ever held in this city. It is com
posed of 751 delegates, and among
them are some of the most prominent
men in the Republican party of the
State. One of the noticeable figures on
the floor of the convention hall was ex-
Governor H. H. Markham, who is tak
ing special interest in the legislative
fight. It is understood that he aspires
to Senatorial honors, and he is one of
the most persistent and energetic work
ers against a resolution which will be
offered to-morrow indorsing Hon. Rob
ert N. Bulla for United States Senator.
The Los Angeles Times is also said to
have interested itself in the fight
against Bulla, ana it is asserted that
W. R. Bacon, the chairman of the com
mittee on resolutions, known to be op
posed to Bulla, Avas selected at the so
licitation of the Times people. The
friends of Senator Bulla, however, are
confident that he will receive the in
dorsement of the convention, notwith
standing the opposition of the parties
who are fighting him, so that they may
keep the field clear for themselves.
Another important matter to come
before the convention to-morrow is the
question of balloting for candidates. A
strong effort will be made to introduce
the Australian ballot system of bal
loting, by which all of the candidates
are to be voted for at the same time.
There is, however, much opposition to
the adoption of the system, and it is
expected that the old style of ballot
ing will prevail. The defection of the
Los Angeles Times is another question
that will in all probability be taken
up by the convention and will afford an
opportunity of showing the feeling that
exists against the paper because of its
recent attack made on members of the
State executive campaign committee.

The Gunboat Bennington Will Sail
at Once Under Sealed Orders.
The United States gunboat Benning
ton is expected down from Mare Island
early this morning. She will proceed
to-day or to-morrow on her way to
Honolulu under sealed orders.

DEATH CLAIMS
JUDGE COOLEY
Michigan's Noted Jurist
Passes Away.
WAS A GREAT AUTHORITY
ON QUESTIONS OF CONSTITU
TIONAL LAW.
For Many Years Was a Member of
the State Supreme Court and
Later an Interstate Com
missioner.
Special Dispatch to TfcÂ© Call.
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Sept. 12.â Judge
Thomas M. Cooley, the noted Jurist and
constitutional lawyer, died early to-day
at his home. Three months ago he re
turned from a private sanitarium at
Flint, Mich., where he had been treated
chiefly for mental weakness. He was
then so much improved In mental
health that he was able to recognize
acquaintances. He realized his weak
physical condition and his failing men
tal faculties, and often expressed a wish
that death would come. Several weeks
ago he relapsed into a comatose con
dition. During the ensuing interval
the only intelligible utterance he made
was once when he inquired for hl3 eld
est son. His demise had been expected
for weeks past.
Thomas Mclntyre Cooley was born In
Attica, N. T., January 6, 1824. He be
gan the study of law in Palmyra, N. T.,
in 1842, and, removing to Michigan in
1843, completed his legal studies at Ad
rian, where he was admitted to the
bar in January, 1846. He practiced
his profession for the years following
at Tecumseh, after which he settled In
Adrian. For a time he edited a paper,
the Watch Tower. In 1857 the State
Senate assigned to him the work of
compiling the general etatutes of Mich
igan, which were published in two
volumes. In 1859 he was made profes
sor of law in the University of Michi
gan. Five years later he was elected
a Justice of the Supreme Court of the
State to fill a vacancy, and in 1869 he
was re-elected for the full term of eight
years. In 1868-69 he was Chief Jus
tice and in 1885 retired permanently
from the bench. In 1881 a school of
political science was established in the
University of Michigan, and Judge Coo
ley assumed the professorship of con
stitutional and administrative law. It
was in 1886 that he was given the chair
of American history in the Michigan
University, and at the same time he
became lecturer on constitutional law
and dean of the school of political
science. Among the works published
by Judge Cooley are: "Digest of Mich
igan Reports." 1S86; "The Constitu
tional Limitations Which Rest Upon the
Legislative Power of the States of the
American Union," 1868; enlarged edi
tion, 1871, and editions with copious
notes of Blackstone's "Commentaries."
IS7O, and Story's "Commentaries on the
Constitution of the Untted States,"
with additional chapters on the "New
Amendments," 1573; "The Law of Tax
ation," 1876; "The Law of Torts," 1879;
"General Principles of Constitutional
Law in the United States," 1880; "Mich
iganâA History of Governments," 1885.
It was while a member of the United
States Interstate Commerce Commis
sion in 18S8 that Judge Cooley paid a
visit to San Francisco.

Devlin represented Barry and the
State Central Committee.
The Secretary of State announced
after the hearing that he would decide
the case in a few days. It is probable,
however, that the point involved will
be taken to the Supreme Court for a
final decision by whichever party is
ruled against.
J. H. Barry was nominated in Sacra
mento by the delegates who were ap
pointed by the committee of one hun
dred under the call of the Democratic
State Central Committee. Spelling con
tended to-day that the State Central
Committee could not issue a call for
tho nomination of Congressman, but
that the call must be issued by the
Congressional Committee of each dis
trict. He claimed that his nomination
was properly secured after a mass
meeting in San Francisco had appoint
ed a committee which issued the call
for the Congressional convention. He
asserted that the Democratic State
Convention had nothing to do with the
work of the Congressional district con
ventions.
Secretary of State Brown informed
The Call correspondent this afternoon
that he had not yet prepared his decis

SACRAMENTO, Sept. U.â The pro

horses and one contest for the gallopers

in the land. However, t:ie running race, j

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1898.
B. Spreckels, M. F. Tarpey and General
Barrett were the Judges, Mr. Spreckels
presiding and Mr. Tarpey acting as start
er of the light harness horses, at which
work he did fairly well.
The Stanford stake, mile heats, three in
five, for foals of 1595, had four starters.
Dos Minutos, a chestnut colt by Captain
Harris' old campaigner, Melvar, dam El
more.ne, was at 2 to 5 in the betting, and,
going further and further away from his
opponents all the time, won by over a
sixteenth of a mile, distancing the bunch
and settling the argument in one heat.
Time, 2:30. Dos Minutos' opponents. If
such they could be called, were Dr.
Frasse, George Buckman and I. L. B.
In the 2:30 class trot, mile dash Mamie
Rlley was a 1 to 2 favorite, Phoebe Chll
ders 4 to 1, Shelby 5 to 1, the others 6 to
12 to 1. After scoring half a dozen times,
they were away to a fair start. Shelby
led 'for about a furlong. Then Joe Selby
wont to the front, leading Shelby by a
Small margin past the quarter and half,
with Phoebe Chllders third, the favorite
away back fourth. Shelby passed to the
front on the final turn and Joe Selby
dropped back beaten. Shelby looked a
winner up to the last sixty yards, when
he broke, and Donathan shot PhoebeChil
ders in a winner by a haJf length, Shelby
second, two lengths before Mamie Riley,
Joe Selby a poor fourth. Time, 2:16>4.
A mile dash for 2:17 class trotters came
third on the programme, and Prince Gift
was a 3 to 10 favorite. To a good start
Prince Gift assumed a decided lead in the
first furlong and held it all the way
around, winning with ease by three
lengths, May B beating Lou a neck for
the place in a hard drive. Myrtle Thorne
was prominent for over a half mile. Our
Jack broke on the first turn and lost fully
twenty-five lengths. The time was 2:lsVi.-
The fourth race for 2:26 pacers, one
mile, had eight starters-. Belle W was
made the favorite, her price being 6 to 5:
Lady Margaret was at 2 to 1. Harry J 11
to 5, Majel!a B and Silas Simons 4 to 1,
Mia Louise 5, the others 8 and 10 to 1.
To a good start after several scores and
a break .in Majella B's rigging, Lady Mar
garet soon got to the fore and remained
there to the end, though she was very
tired and shaky at' the wind up. Her run
ning margin was two lengths. Majella B
finished second and Belle W (who made
up a lot of ground from the half) third.
Harry J looked like a winner half way
down the homestretch, but went tnto the
air to a bad hobble when about a nlx
teenth from home. Mia Louise was sec
ond for six furlongs. Time, 2:17; first
half In l:05y 2 .
There were seven starters In the 2:15
clasÃ trot, a mile dash. Much Better was
a 8 to 5 favorite, Beachwood and Rex Alto
SIX HUNDRED BURNED
ALIVE OR MASSACRED
LONDON, Sept. 12.â The correspondent of the Times at Candia,
Crete, who has just landed after five days In the roadstead, says:
About six hundred men, women and children were either burned
alive or massacred in the outbreak last week. The Turkish troops
are now patrolling and blocking up the streets. The Mussulmans are
ransacking the ruins of the burned quarters of the town. Blood is
visible everywhere. Such bodies of the slain as were not burned were
removed yesterday in carts and buried outside the town limits.
3 to 1 each, Dlawood 5, the others from 12
to 30. To a poor go. Much Better at once
paced well to the front, leading Dictatress
by five lengths past the quarter and naif.
Then Rex Alto paced very fast, coming
from sixth place to second before thej
swung into the homestretch, Dictatress
third. Much Better's lead of eight lenguis
was cut down to less than three half way
down the stretch, but Rex Alto went into
a gallop and kept it up to the end. Much
Better was first by six lengths. Rex Alto
second three lengths before Beachwood,
she a length in front of Dictatress, f rim
rose another length away. Time 2:12%.
Rex Alto was set back for running,
Beachwood being placed second and Dic
tatress third. ...
A seven and a half furlong race wound
up the day's sport. Libertine was a 4 to
5 favorite, Osculation at 6 to B, Hermanita
3% to 1, Wheel of Fortune 7 to 1.
To a good start Libertine took a slight
lead at once, but Osculation was never
over two lengths away. She moved up
on even terms with the big horse on the
final turn and beat him out with ease
by half a length. Wheel of Fortune third,
four lengths back. Time, I:3G.

CHOYNSKI FAILS TO
PUT OUT GODDARD
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 12.â Joe Choyn-
Bkl hod all the better of It in his bout
with Joe Goddard to-night at the Arena.
Gyddard was considerably heavier than
the Californian, but he lacked in sci
ence. Choynskl made a chopping block
of the Australian, and several times it
looked as though Goddard. would not be
able to stay the full six rounds.
There was but little fighting in the
opening round. The men exchanged
rights on the face, and Goddard landed
a light left on Choynskl' a 1 chest. In the
second round Choynski landed several
lefts on Goddard's face, but the latter
could not get in a blow. The third,
fourth and fifth rounds were repetitions
of the second, Choynskl doing nearly all
the leading and landing almost at will.
In the closing round Goddard fought
wildly, while Choynskl was calm, and
banged Goddard on the jaw, sending him
to his knees. Choynski landed hard and
often, but could not stop the Australian.
While the gong was sounding a spec
tator stepped into the ring and attempted
to hit Goddard, but he was quickly
thrown from the platform.

BONNER WINS HIS
FIGHT WITH CREEDON
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â "Jack" Bonner,
the middle-weight pugilist from Summitt,
Pa., gained an easy victory over Dan
Creedon, the Australian boxer, in the sec
ond round of their fight at the Greater
New York Athletic Club to-night. Cree
don was knocked down by a heavy right
hand punch on the Jaw, and in falling he
twisted his right ankle. He was not
knocked out by any means, but the blow
he received was one to settle the boxing
aspirations of any man. He groped
around and tried to regain his feet while
the referee was counting off the seconds,
but his ankle was too badly injured for
him to stand up straight and he fell again
and was counted out. Had this not oc
curred the fight might have gone on for
many rounds.
The spectators were satisfied that Dan
was not faking, and left the house after
having been informed that the doctor who
attended the Australian had found the
ankle badly sprained.
LONG SPEAKS OF
NAVAL LEGISLATION
Bills by Which It Is Now Proposed
to Properly Regulate Pro
motion.
BOSTON, Sept. 12.â Before leaving for
Washington to-day Secretary of the
Navy Long was asked about a bill pre
pared by him concerning promotions in
the navy. He said the bill relates to pro
motion without the consequent degrada
tion of others. A second bill deals with
the officers who have suffered in numbers
and otherwise by promotions already
made and aims so to provide that they
shall receive the promotion which would
have come to them at a certain time had
no exceptional promotions been made.
OCCIDENTAL TRAGEDY.
SANTA ROSA. Sept. 12.â Fred Weiner,
a prominent farmer of Occidental, shot

"Weiner gave himself up to the officers.
He claims that he killed the man in seU'
dc'fense. A charge of murder was filed in
Justice Brown's court this afternoon by
Constable Pride of Occidental. The two
men quarreled, and Weiner claims Samoni
had gone to get an ax to kill him.

MARKET ST&R^SSS^E. F. LOUD IS
RENOMINATED
FOR CONGRESS
Fifth District Republi
can Convention.
AT SESSION AT SHIELS HALL
SENATOR E. I. WOLFE THE ONLY
OPPOSING CANDIDATE.
M. H. de Young, D. M. Burns and the
Southern Pacific Turned Down
by the District
Delegates.
The Republicans of the Fifth Con
gressional District yesterday nominated
Hon. Eugene F. Loud for their candi
date for Congress. His opponent before
HON. EUGENE F\ LOUD.
The Republican Nominee for Congress F*rom
the F"ifth Congressional District.
the nominating convention was State
S< nator Edward I. Wolfe.
For several days Immediately preced
ing the assembling of the convention
the most strenuous efforts were put
forth to defeat Mr. Loud. Delegates
who were pledged to his support by the
people who elected them were sought
out and urged to vote against him. The
prime movers in the plan to accomplish
Loud's defeat wero M. 11. de Young.
Dan M. Burns and the Southern Pacific
Railroad corporation. Leading dele
gates to the convention were Inter
viewed and urged to join the movement
to turn down Mr. Loud.
The friends of Mr. Loud were at first
Inclined to treat the rumors of oppo
sition to his renomination as idle talk
without foundation in fact, but as one
delegate after another told the story
that the Southern Pacific and Burns
had Joined De Young in a crusade
against the Congressman the reports
could no longer be regarded as trivial
gossip.
The plans bo adroitly laid and vigor
ously supported did not win. The op
position succeeded In rallying only
seventeen votes In support of Senator
Wolfe.
The convention was called to order in
Shiels Hall at 1:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon. J. Alva Watt was elected
chairman and E. D. Crawford was
chosen as secretary. Little time was
consumed in preliminaries. When the
chair announced that nominations
were in order William A. Beasly of
Ban Jose stepped to the platform and
presented to the assembled delegates
the name of Hon. Eugene F. Loud. Mr.
Beasly did not affect oratorical poses
or aspire to great flights of eloquence,
but in a simple, persuasive style set
forth the merits of his candidate.
Reference was made to Mr. Loud'a long
and honorable service in Congress.
Special mention wu made of .Mr.
Loud's devotion to the Interests of the
fruit grow* is and producers of the
Santa Clara Valley. Tribute was paid
to the Congressman's loyalty to Repub
lican principles, his courage, consis
tency and fidelity to the cause of hon
est money when many Republicans
were ready to waver.
The nomination of Mr. Loud was sec
onded by Charles Sonntag.
Ex-State Senator Frank McGowan
presented the name of Edward I. Wolfe.
He spoke of the new era in political
affairs and the necessity for the in
fusion of young blood. Gold standard
of money and protection of industry
were established, and new questions of
territorial expansion and commercial
patriotism had arisen to demand the
attention of statesmen. He believed
that Mr. Wolfe would fitly represent
In Congress the new ideas.
E. A. Bergerot seconded the nomina
tion of Mr. Wolfe.
Ira (J. Iloitt, whose recollection of
Byronlc verse has been dulled since
he moved from San Francisco to San
Mateo County, remarked that he was
like a young lady with two
suitors â "How happy he would be
vvith either were 'tother dear
charmer away." He knew Mr.
Loud and Mr. Wolfe as worthy and
capable Republicans. He fancied that
Senator Wolfe was needed in the Leg
islature to help in the election of a Re
publican United States Senator. Air.
Loud's eminent services in Congress
were cited, and the convention was
a.sked to uphold the hands of the ad
ministration by renomlnating the able
representative of the fifth District.
On motion nominations were closed.
P. B. Cornwall and I. G. Truman de
sired that the candidates should ad
dress the delegates, but the convention
decided In favor of proceeding at once
to the ballot.
The ballot resulted In Loud getting
ninety-nine and Wolfe seventeen votes.
San Mateo cast nine votes for Loud.
Santa Clara County gave Loud thirty
one and Wolfe two votes.
Before the result was announced E.
A. Bergerot moved that Mr. Load's
nomination be declared unanimous, and
the motion prevailed.
When the applause Bubslded there
were many calls for Mr. Loud. He went
to the platform and made a model
speech of acceptance. Speaking of his
fifth nomination for Congress and his
Congressional service of eight years,
ho remarked that the fluties of the po
sition were not always pleasant, but
the pleasure of again receiving the In
dorsement of the convention amply re
paid him for the trials he had sus
tained. He pictured the deplorable con
dition of the Democratic party to-day.
A party with a hard money record of
a century was now taking Its orders
from the Populists. Nominations were
dictated by the Populists. He ad- I
monished Republicans not to deceive I
themselves with the idea that they
would have a walk-over this year. The
opposition was peculiar, but it was ac
tive. The Democrats, while indorsing
and commending the administration of
President McKlnley, were opposing the
Republican party.
"The Republican party," observed
Mr. Loud, "has a record that it can well
be proud of. We promised the people
two years ago to bring order out of
chaos. Have we kept our promise? We
have conducted a war to successful
conclusion, and to-day there is the sum
of $206,000,000 in the public treasury.
Never before in history did the United
States stand s.o firmly, so grandly and
splendidly before the nations of the
world as to-day. The most serious
questions now confront us. There is an
American spirit of patriotism and
commercialism which demands that
wherever the American flag is raised It
shall never be torn down. To govern
the new acquisitions will require wis
dom and experience."
In closing Mr. Loud pledged to do his
full duty to the best of his ability in
case of his re-election to Congress.
Senator Wolfe, responding to calls,
went to the platform and promised that
his voice should be heard in Mr. Loud's
behalf during the campaign. He pre
dicted the re-election of Mr. Loud and
the complete triumph of Republican
principles.
Following are the names of the men
appointed by Congressman E. F. Loud
to compose the committee on purity of
election:
Mark Sheldon, William B. Cluff, J. H.
Thompson, Arthur Attrldge and J. J.
Cullunden.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1898.
CLIFT ACCUSES
M. H. DE YOUNG
The Oakland Judge Says
Bitter Things.
WITHDRAWS HIS CANDIDACY
WANTED THE NOMINATION FOB
DISTRICT ATTORNEY.
Miss Bessie "Wood Would Like to Be
the Next Coroner â Other Can
didates Who Are in
the Field.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. lV
Only seven days more and then the mo
mentous question of who shall represent
the Republicans of Alarneda In the next
county government and the next Legisla
ture will be settled.
The appearance of the streets to-day
suggested mat the convention was actu
ally being held on Broadway, and prob
ably the appearance was not as deceptive
as such are usually said to be. The ap
proach of the convention naturally in
creases the Interest and the self-confi
dence of many so freely expressed a week
ago is now being prefaced with an "if."
Justice Fred Cllft, who entered the con
test for the nomination of District At
torney three months ago, announced his
â withdrawal this morning. In his pub
lished statement he gives five reasons why
he withdraws. He declares that his can
didacy Is obnoxious to the Southern Pa
cific Railroad "and Henry Dalton. who
have formed a political alliance for mu
tual aid, prolit, advantages and protec
tit'ii." "Without offering any proof Judge
Cllft says that the entire county and Leg
islative ticket from top to bottom has
been programmed. In his third reason
he says: "The Third Ward, in which I
have resided since childhood, Is pro
grammed In the interests of Mr. de Young
for United States Senator, and I have
been informed that I shall not be per
mitted to .have a delegation there unless
such delegation is put up with my money,
and in the interest of Henry Dalton and
the railroad company." There is also a
reference to some unnamed candidate
who, it is said, is "faithful among the
faithless" and who is to be thrown down
by "one who is not and never has been a
Republican." In conclusion. Judge Clift
says he realizes that he cannot lÂ»eat the
inlliiences that are at work against him.
The retirement of Cllft leaves the field
open to Justice J. J. Allen and Prosecut
ing Attorney Melvin.
The usual bitter contest for the nomina
tion for Coroner is daily becoming more
apparent. James Taylor, an undertaker,
months ago announced that If he were
elected he would donate all the fees
earned by the Coroner to the Associated
Charities.
Dr. Mehrmann is after the Republican
nomination. Miss Bessie Wood also makea
a Â£id for ot'icial favors. She would like
to be Coroner and declares that if she
â were elected to the high office of Coroner,
she would present every Juror that sat
on an inquest under her administration
with a red necktie as a memento of the
occasion.
Another sensation was caused by the
public announcement that A. K. Grim
has decided to go before the county as an
independent cauaiuate lot rCoourucr. ....
Grim has been making a campaign
against C. H. Spear for the Berkeley
delegation and was largely backed by the
street railroad men, but he now declares
that he prt-fers to go before the people
as an independent Republican than to
ceek a nomination from the convention.
County Clerk Jordan has been, indorsed
by nearly ev<;ry attorney in the county,
and many leading bankers and merchants
have also signed a testimonial to his
worth.
The Bimetallic League has announced
that noxt Friday evening Hon. James G.
Magulre will speak at the tabernacle.
On Thursday evening the middle-of-the
road faction of the People's party will
hold its county convention. Primaries
were held on Saturday, at which the
tost included a promise to oppose fusion.
The Third Ward Republican Club will
meet to-morrow night and will indorse
Judge Allen for District Attorney. Next
Friday night the club will give a
"smoker."
The Alameda County Bimetallic League
met to-night to arrange for the Magulre
meeting next Friday. A committee con
sisting of President F. W. Voogt. Secre
tary 11. A. Ingalls. Perry Wall and Dr.
H. A. L. Ryfkogel, was appointed to con
fer with the committees of other organi
zations in making the affair a success.
P. J. Keller. "Mayor of Piedmont," will
furnish the tropical plants with which the
tabernacle is to be decorated.
Resolutions were adopted indorsing the
candidacy of Judge Magulre for Governor
and John Aubrey Jones for Congressman
from the Third Congressional District,
and pledging the support of the league.
It was declared the sense of the league
that a fusion of the Democratic, Populistlc
and Silver Republican parties on county
candidates is desirable. Before adjourn
ment John Aubrey Jones made a brief
address in which ho admitted that he
could not win his fight single handed,
and th.it the doctrine of 16 to 1 is aa live
as ever it was.

CHAIRMAN D. T. RIORDAN AP
POINTS HIS COMMITTEE.
A Short and Interesting Session of
the Republican County Com
mittee Last Night.
When Acting Chairman T* D. Rlordan
called the Republican County Committee
to order in Shiels building last night there
were few vacant chairs in the iiall. In
terested spectators crowded the standing
space and took keen interest in the busi
ness of the meeting.
Immediately upon the adoption of the
minutes of the previous session Delegate
Harry N. Gray arose and moved that the
regular order of business be suspended

of Chairman Charles Manwarlng be tilled.
The motion was carried, and Jesse rZ.

for the position and of the splendid work
he had done for the party in the past.
The name of the acting chairman was re

unanimously selected to act as permanent

DALTON MAKES REPLY.
Says That Justice Cliffs Charges Are
Untrue and the Utterances of
a Disappointed Man.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 12.
Assessor Dalton made the following re
ply to Justice CUft to-night:
"Judge F. C. Clift has announced
his withdrawal as a candidate for
the office of District Attorney of
Alarneda County. In the same
card ho has made very free with my
name, and has accused me of having en
tered Into a political combination with
the railroad. To this accusation of Judge
CUft I have but this to say. The con
test I have made against the Southern
Pacific during the four years I have been
Assessor of Alameda County will, I think,
make the assertion made appear what it
really is, a foolish one, made by a dis
appointed candidate for office. In spite of
his bold assertions to the contrary, Judge
Cllft was, up to within the last two or
three days, very eager to have me enter
Into a political combination with him.
When I refused to do so he threatened
me with his political wrath and the wrath
of all his friends. And it now appears
that all he can do Is to scold and make
idle accusations, endeavoring by this
means to make it appear that he is the
only pure candidate for office in this
county, and that all the others are crea
tures of the machine and the servants of
the railroad. In view of all the circum
stances surrounding my past record, in
Alameda County, and also Judge Cliffs,
I do not think it necessary for me to en
ter any very strong denial of the Judge's
charges; and I shall not do so. Suffice
it to say, they are untrue.
"HENRY P. DALTON."
Their Votes in the Balance.
RegiFtrar Bigfty has prepared a list of

MODJESKA`S ART
STILL SUPREME
Mary Stuart With All
Her Old Spell.
ANOTHER PACHECO COMEDY
MILK WHITE FLAG WAVES
AGAIN AT THE COLUMBIA.
"Carmen" at the Tivoli â Some Vau
deville Changes â Stirring
Melodrama at the
Grand.
After an absence of nearly two years,
during which we have been filled with
all sorts of Billy stories about her
fading art and gpneral unhealth, Mod-
Jeska appeared at the Baldwin Theater
last night and played Mary Stuart as
she alone of living actresses can play
the part.
In the minds of the cultivated play
goers of America. Modjeska and Mary
Stuart are names that are Inseparable.
If there is one part in Modjeska's wide
ranging repertory that stands alone it
is the unfortunate Queen of Scots in
the Schiller play, to whom she gives an
identic that is absolute, unfor^etable.
At this late day it is fortunate for the
stage that new criticisms need not be
written for this performance. Perhaps
the years have softened Modjeska's
temperament, made her personal power
a something less than it used to be;
but she is still Modjeska and the most
distinguished woman artist on the Eng
lish-speaking stage. The fragrance,
mimetic grace, spirituality and sov
ereign poise that she brought to Mary
Stuart last night have been unknown
qualities in the local theater for many
months â ever since her last visit. In
fact in both temperament and execu
tion she can be compared only with
herself of other yearsâ and in "Mary
Stuart," at least, the comparison need
not shatter the fondest illusions.
Mr. Lonergan seems to do the only
one of the old company who has been
retained, and in the heroic part of
Mortimer he does good workâespecial
ly good when you take into account
that he must suffer a comparison with
his brilliant predecessor, Joseph Ha
worth. Mr. Hermann, who is remem
bered for many a rugged feat in com
pany with Frederick Warde, unbends
gracefully to the Earl of Leicester; and
Miss Anna E. Proctor plays the Queen
Elizabeth with that unflinching malev
olence which seems ever to be a tradi
tion of the part. As a whole, the sup
porting company is easy, human, well
clad and tremendously in earnest â
nothing sensational about it, but just
the band from whom it is reasonable to
expect good repertory work.
The attendance was fair last night
and promises larger for the rest of the
week. When Modjeska made up her
mind to adopt the land of the free and
the tongue of the Englander she chose
this remote town for the starting point.
And San Francisco has yet to be ac
cused of forgetting the obligation.
ASHTON STEVENS.
The Tivoli.
The sparkling, fascinating "Carmen" of
Bizet drew a crowded house to the com
mencement of the seventh week of grand
opera at the Tivoli last night. Rhys
Thomaa as the Jealous brigadier
was at his best; he was especially
well received In the duet of the second
act. Miss Linck, in the title role, showed
once more that she is a sterling singer
besides being an exceptionally clever ac
tress. The same can always be said of
Sig. de Vrles, who evoked storms of ap
plause as the toreador. William West as
the smuggler, did a strong character bit;
and Mr. Schuster and Miss Crox in the
parts of Mlchaela and Zuniga did well
The chorus was hardly up to Its usual
excellence.
"La Traviata" Is the bill for to-night
The Alhambra.
Corlnne, Slgnor Del Puente and Mr. and
Mrs. Sydney Drew seem to be cards that
cannot be played too often to a San
Francisco audience. The remainder of
the attractions are meritorious, and there
is a heap of fun in the cake walk in which
the evening's entertainment is wound up.
The auditorium is cool and well ventilat
ed, and contained last night an audience
that was thoroughly representative.
Moposco's.
"The Land of the Living," a melodrama
that had a big run In one of the London
theaters, was produced last evening at
Morosco's Grand Opera House, with Miss
Gertrude Foster, Landers Stevens and
Max Yon Mitzel in the leading parts.
They were well received, as was little
Rosie Bennett, who formed one of the
central figures In a happy household that
had been disrupted through the schemes
of a villain whose main object is to create

'mischief, for revenge, and who in the
long run places his head in a noose. The
support iB good and the piece Is well
set.
"The Coast Guard" will be presented
next week, and for this the Waterman
Sisters have been engaged for their spe
cialties.
At the Columbia.
Heroic deeds in hostile lands have, for
the time being, at least, placed our guards
men beyond the reach of satirical thrusts.
but this does not detract from the popu
larity of Hoyfs "A Milk White Flag,"
which is on this week at the Columbia,
and, as the house was full to the doors
last evening, promises to enjoy its usual
run. The piece has been produced in this
city several times before, but many who
were in the audience in r : ' s t days went
last night and enjoyed it anew. New cos
tumes and scores of witticisms, born of
the recent war, give it an up-to-date
flavor.
John W. Dunne, in the character of
The Colonel, "who Napoleon resembled,"
does capital work. Miss Mary Marble is
petite and clever as ever, and Miss Marie
Dantes as the widow, and the company in
general, win the approval of the au
dience.
The Alcazar.
A double bill was presented at the Alca
zar last night to a crowded house. "A
Tragedy," which proved to be a farce,
with many comical situations that kept
the audience in a hilarious condition, was
the first on the bill. The cast comprised
Ernest Hastings, George Osbourne, Wal
lace Shaw, Clarence Montaine, Frank
Denithorne, Francis Vale. Gretchen Ly
ons, Marie Howe, Edna Ewen and Juliet
Crosby, who all made the best of their
parts. "The First Horn" was as strong
an attraction as ever.
Chutes.
Cotton and Moll, triple horizontal bar
performers, are now at the Chutes Free
Theater, and give a clever and exciting
exhibition. Oro Clifford and Oro give an
Irinh-Chinese sketch, "Fun in a Chinese
Laundry," that amused the large crowd
of first-nighters, ana Kmh Ohevrial,
trick violinist, was also new and ma.de
a hit. The nine scenes of a Spanish bull
tight are about the best things in the
way of moving pictures yet seen here,
and the rest of the bill was up to the
standard established in the Haight-street
grounds.
New Comedy.
"A Woman's Wit" was "written to
order" by Mrs. Pacheco, and for some
reason, not stated, was rejected. Its orig
inal production at the New Comedy The
ater last night proved conclusively that
it was hurriedly constructed and not up
to the standard the authoress establish
ed for her work when she wrote "In
cog." The story of the ridiculously jeal
ous husband Is as old as the domestic
relation, and some of the situations sup
posed to lead up to the solution of the
family troubles through "woman's wit"
are unnatural and result In the kind of
laugh that is not sought by the players.
Under better conditions the play could
be made much more acceptable, and the
humor of some of the lines and compli
cations brought out Â»n a manner to de
velop the intended fun.
The role of the suspected wife Is not
suited to the abilities of Carina Jordan,
and It is unfortunate that she was se
lected for the part, as It calls for par
ticularly clever work. Mr. St. Maur, aa
the green-eyed husband, could put more
sincerity In his work and thereby greatly
improve the star part, which of neces
sity demands very careful handling to
avoid going to the extreme of carica
ture. Hattle Schell, as the eccentric and
witty young woman who cheats the di
vorce court of a case, carries tlÂ»Â« hon
ors in a part which in the third act Is
hard to reconcile to things natural.
George Probert as the French count,
Kate Vandenhoff as the silly lovesick old
maid, and Brigham Royce as the lover
who had nothing in particular to do, did
well in their labors to lend pleasure to
the occasion.
The Orpheum.
With the new acts and changes by the
holdovers, the Orpheum has a line bill for
this week. The chic little artist, Bessie
Bonehlll, was well received, and hers is
one of the few acts that will gTow on the
people. Before she leaves this city she ia
likely to score one of the greatest hits of
the Orpheum. Hines and Remington have
an act that has the merit of originality,
if nothing more, but in their line they are
artists. The character work by Miss
Remington is particularly clever. Favor
and Sinclair have a new act. of merit, and
while Irene Franklin's quaint voice is set
to new songs. Felix Morris and company
appear in '"The Old Musician." While tins
act may not appeal to the gallery to the
degree that did "A Game of Cards," yet it
is one of the richest vaudeville treats the
Orpheum has offered.
Olympia.
Conlln and Rider, comedy acrobats;
Anita Allen, singing soubrette, Madeline
and Trlxeda and others scored a hit at
the Olympia Music-hall last night.

OLYMPIC INSTALLATION.
I Ex-President Ne-whall Is in Favor of
the Club Giving Boxing
Entertainments.
The Installation of the newly elected
officers of the Olympic Club took place
last evening In the club rooms.
George A. Newhall, the retiring presi
dent, made a brief speech. In which he
said that owing to the depressed condition
of the times the club during his adminis
tration had to study economy and conse
quently some changes were made in the
regular order of affairs which could have
been avoided in times of prosperity.
He thought that the club should encour
age professional boxing contests, as the
institution averaged something like $300
per month profit from the entertainments
it held during his term of office. He also
said that the club's outdoor athletic
grounds were maintained at an heavy ex
pense and that notwithstanding the econ-
omy advanced by the directors to further
the interests of the club, the loss to the
institution during the past year was $1500.
J. C. Kirkpatriek, the newly elected
president, was then introduced. He said
his intentions were to encourage all
branches of athletic sports, but that with
out the combined support of the members'
every effort on the part of the officers of
the club would prove unavailing. Ha
hoped to see the Olympic Club nourish
during his administration.
Plasterers Organize.
The plasterers organised last night and
elected the following officers: Daniel Sul
livan, president; George Kecke, vice presi
dent, J. Pearce, secretary; William
O'Brien, treasurer; William T'dell, ser
geant-at-arms. The next meeting will be
held on Saturday night at Academy Hall,
927 Mission street.

MAGUIRE AND ANARCHY.
BY the thrill of horror which ran through the
civilized world on the announcement of the
assassination of the Empress of Austria by the
hand of an anarchist, the attention of the people of
California is recalled again to the sympathy which
James G. Maguire has always avowed for that class
of criminals. It is, moreover, pertinent to the time
that this sympathy with ravening cruelty and lawless
ness should be made the subject of public comment,
tor Maguire -is a candidate for the office of Governor,
and should he be elected would have it in his power
to pardon the crimes of such criminals and make
California during his term of office a safe place for
their residence.
It is notable that Maguire's sympathy with anar
chists is so close and so strong that he has never been
able to perceive any moral turpitude on their part.
He has on the other hand maintained that even when
they commit assassinations they are justified so long
as the persons assassinated are selected from the offi
cial representatives of governments. These sentiments,
so repulsive to Americans, and indeed to law-abiding
men of all nations, were conspicuously asserted by
Maguire during the debate on the immigration re
striction bill in the House of Representatives January
27. 1897.
In the course of the debate on that day Maguire is i
reported in the Congressional Record as having said:
"Gentlemen urge the passage of this bill as a step ,jn i
the direction of excluding Anarchists, Socialists and i
Nihilists from this country. Assuming that it would
be right and desirable, though I do not adnit it
would be either right or desirable, to exclude these j
classes or any of them from this country, yet the |
present bill does not tend to their exclusion. They are'
generally educated men, many of them holding uni- j
versity degrees, whose offending consists of resistance j
to tyranny, which in the conditions under which they I
Hve is obedience to God. Who are the Nihilists? ]
They are the Democrats of Russia who are struggling
against almost hopeless odds to establish the natural i
and inalienable rights of men in that country as i
against the tyranny and false pretense of divine right i
on the part of the Czar."
This speech having been made as late as January of
last year, after the anarchists had filled the world
with a hideous record of crime running from the
assassination of the Czar to the blowing up of the
opera-house at Barcelona and causing the deaths of
men and women who had nothing whatever to do
with government, ghows that Maguire's sympathy
with anarchy is not the result of any ignorance on his
part of what anarchists desire or of the means by
which they hope to accomplish it.
Anarchy and nihilism as a matter of fact are aim
ing not at the murder of crowned heads, but at the
destruction of society. The scoundrel who struck
down the venerable Empress of Austria avowed that
at his first examination. He disclaimed any animosity
toward either the Empress or her husband the Em
peror. He had not gone to Switzerland to seek her
as a victim. He stabbed her only because the oppor
tunity offered. He boasted: "If all anarchists did
their duty as I have done mine, bourgeois society
would soon disappear."
The words should be remembered. It is not against
royaJty, imperialism or despotism that anarchy has
raised its hideous head and murderous hand, but
against society. It is as antagonistic to social con
ditions in America as to those in Russia. It has per
petrated its crimes in Chicago as ruthlessly as in St.
Petersburg.
It was one of the purposes of the framers of the
immigration restriction bill to shut these decadent
wretches out of the United States. Maguire objected
to their exclusion. He proclaimed his sympathy for
them. He raised in Congress a cry as violent as any
ever heard on the sandlots in this city when agitation
was at its worst: and to-day he asks to be entrusted
with the enforcement of law in this State â to be
chosen as its Governor.
A few days ago the British were rejoicing over the
defeat of the Dervishes by General Kitchener, and
nailing it as a triumph of civilization; and now comes
the French occupation of Fashoda, causing the re
joicers to take a second thought and consider
whether there may not be such a thing as too much
competition of civilization in Central Africa.
Miss Fusion Populism having wedded herself to
Democracy at Sacramento, it is only fair the middle
of-the-road maiden should have sole use of the family
name. Democracy cannot rightly deprive a whole
tribe of its good name by running off with a crazy
sprig of it.
The order of the powers that both the contending
parties in Crete shall lay down their arms is good
enough as far as it goes, but it does not go far
enough. What is wanted is the kind of order that
will make life secure and arms unnecessary.
Whatever discords may exist in some quarters,
there is more harmony in San Francisco to-day than
there was a month ago. We never hear the siren
now.
OUR TROPICAL COLONIES.
BOTH parties in this State have approved ex
pansion in the tropics, without heeding or
indeed hearing a discussion of the policy which
would bring out the facts which illuminate and must
determine its wisdom or otherwise. In the absence
of any opportunity for voters to express themselves
against tropical expansion, because both parties favor
it, The Call adheres to its former position against
holding anything in the tropical islands that have
fallen out of Spain's palsied hands into ours, beyond
some convenient coaling station. We have shown
that the population of those islands by our American
people is impossible, for physical reasons which no
act of man can overcome. We made this same show
ing in the case of Hawaiian labor, when the annexa
tionists were holding out the lure that white men
would be wanted to replace the coolies in the cane
fields and sugar mills. We said that white labor could
not endure the vertical sun in Hawaii, and that as
soon as annexation succeeded the planters would de
mand the continuance of coolie labor. This has come
to pass. They must have the only labor that can live
there or they must submit to the decay of their in
dustries and the rain of their commerce. Their for
mer pretense was false, and we exposed it.
The San Francisco Argonaut, which is hotly in
favor of holding the American and Asiatic tropical
possessions of Spain, advocates garrisoning them en
tirely with negro troops because "they can withstand
a climate that crashes all energy out of white sol
diers after they have been exposed to it for any length
of time, and they are immune tv the tropical diseases
that strike down the whites like cattle."
We need submit no further proof on the point that
our tropical conquests can never be colonized by
white men to plant and protect there the Anglo-
Saxon institutions under which we live.
The next subject for consideration is the people al
ready constituting the population of these islands.
Draper and a line of writers so numerous and re
spectacle that "their statements are not controverted
have shown by evidence irrefutable that absolute
domination of man by his physical environment, so
that to dispute it is to war with every conclusion of
science.
The kind of people who live now in the tropics are
the only kind who can ever live there. Their intel
lectual development is all that can ever occur there.
Does any one recall a great tropical scholar, diplomat,
statesman, scientist? No. Copernicus, Newton, La
voisier, Mitchell, Proctor, Huxley, Darwin, Spencer,
Hegel, Keppler and their peers in science and phil
osophy were all natives of the temperate zone.
In literature Shakespeare, Bacon, Sue, Hugo,
Goethe, Schiller, Tennyson, Byron, Burns, Long
fellow, Hawthorne, Irving â all of the northern race.
The tropics have been open to civilization and its
contacts for four hundred years. In that time, since
the invention of printing, our mass of the literature
of science, art and philosophy has been created. What
is the contribution of the tropics? Nothing. The
same facts of nature which fix the physical character
istics of man in the tropics determine also his mental
and moral elements. As he has been always, between
Cancer and Capricornus, he will always be. We can
not change him. "Of one blood God made all men
and set the bounds to their habitation," is the declara
tion of the old and solemn book. In no respect can
these bounds be passed nor their conditions be made
interchangeable. Therefore such conditions as we
find now in these islands are permanent. There is
sentimental talk about raising the grade of these peo
ple by education. But education is only a form of
utility. It is sought by civilized man as an aid in the
struggle of life. In the tropics nature ministers with
a prodigal hand to all of the physical wants of man;
therefore he needs no education and is not receptive
to it.
Look upon those people to-day and you look upon
what will be there a thousand and a thousand years
from now.
This brings the discussion down to the status of
these people, if we take them in. Are they to be our
fellow-citizens, admitted as members of our body
politic, or are they to be our subject colonists, de
prived of representation and self-government? This
no one has yet answered. It is needless to remind
any student of the constitution that it grants to the
Federal Government only one way of enlarging our
borders by the admission of States into the Union.
It was to acquire territory by treaty or conquest, to
be peopled, pass a novitiate in self-government and
become a State, as may be done even with Alaska,
where our race lives and increases wholesomely, but
no power is granted to expand with any other policy
in view.
Nature has fixed the kind of people for the tropics
and set bounds not only to their habitation, but to
their mental and moral constitution. Let us further
consider at another time their fitness for American
citizenship.
MR. LOUD'S RENOMINATION.
REPUBLICANS of the Fifth District in re
nominating Mr. Loud for Congress not only
showed a just appreciation of the merits of the
man who has so ably and faithfully represented them
in the past, but also made evident the fact that they
understand how important it is for their district and
for the State to retain in service at the national capital
a representative who by his experience there has ac
quired prestige among Congressmen, is familiar with
the methods of transacting business and has the re
spect and confidence of the great leaders of all parties.
The success of Mr. Loud in his first campaign for
Congress was a proof of his excellence as a cam
paigner and his ability as a vote getter. He was pitted
against one of the most popular Democrats, and was
himself at that time untried in national legislation. His
repeated re-elections since have been due to what he
has accomplished at Washington much more than to
any canvassing tactics at home. His record has been
his best campaign document, and has won as well as
merited the approval of his party and of all independ
ent voters among his constituents.
At the present time Mr. Loud's rank in the House
of Representatives is a most enviable one. He has
become one of the foremost of the younger leaders
on the Republican side, is one of Speaker Reed's most
trusted lieutenants, and has been rewarded for his
efficiency and his ability by appointment to the very
responsible post of chairman of the Committee on
Postoffices.
It would have been a great blunder entailing a loss
j upon the whole State if the Republicans of the Fifth
had failed to renominate their distinguished represen
tative. The opposition to him fortunately came from
sources other than the body of the people, and though
headed by M. H. de Young and D. M. Burns, as
sisted by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
was able to control only sevenfpen votes in the nomi
nating convention, while Mr. Loud received ninety
nine, and was afterward nominated by acclamation.
His renomination was, therefore, a victory over the
antagonism of bosses and corporations. It was a
triumph for honest politics and for the true interests
of the State. The people of the Fifth are to be con
gratulated-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1899.
JUSTICE VAN FLEET AND HIS
SLANDERER.
THE Examiner Sunday morning, August 28, in
its editorial columns, reproduces the slander
upon Justice Van Fleet, which it published about
a year ago at the time the opinion in the case of Fox
vs. the Oakland Consolidated Railroad Company was
rendered, charging him with discriminating in his
opinion against the poor man. There is not a syllable
in the opinion which purports to draw a .distinction
or comparison between the rich and the poor, and the
attempt to create a class antagonism by imputing
such a purpose to Justice Van Fleet is an unwarranted
attack upon the judiciary; for, although the opinion
was written by Justice Van Fleet, it was concurred in
by the entire court, and is but the statement of a well
recognized rule of law.
At common law a father could not maintain an ac
tion for the death of his son by the negligence of
another, but under statutes enacted in modern days
damages for such negligence may be recovered. In
many States the amount is limited to $5000, but in
this State there is no limit to the amount of recovery,
except that the jury may give such damages "as un
der all the circumstances of the case may be just."
The Civil Code defines damages to be compensation
in money, and the term "compensation" by its own
force limits the amount of recovery to the actual loss
of the party who has sustained the injury. By the
statute authorizing the action the circumstances of
the case become, then, the guide in determining the
amount of damages which will be just in each case,
and this involves an inquiry into all the circumstances
which tend to show the amount of loss. The father
is entitled to the services of the son during his min
ority, but he is also under an obligation to clothe and
maintain him during this period, and the actual dam
age which he sustains by his death is the amount of
money which would compensate him for the excess
of his earnings over the cost of his maintenance. Of
course it cannot be determined in advance whether
the child will be employed in any service; or, if so
employed, what his wages will amount to. but, as
juries are not permitted to render verdicts upon con
jecture, or without some evidence upon which they
may rest, the earning capacity of the child must be
shown by the best obtainable evidence. It is upon this
principle that in the case of an. adult evidence is ad
mitted showing the amount of wages which he was
earning at the time of his death, and the number of
years which he would probably live, not upon the
ground that he will always receive that amount of
wages, or that he will live that number of years, but
as being the most satisfactory method of arriving at
a just estimate of his loss. This is what the plaintiff |
in the Fox case sought to recover, and all that was
said in the opinion of Justice Van Fleet was in cor
roboration of this rule â that for the purpose of de
termining the probable occupation the child would j
have pursued, it was reasonable to conclude that it '
would have followed the calling of the father, for the |
reason, which no can deny, that experience teaches
us that children do very frequently pursue the busi- !
ness of the parents, whether they be rich or poor, j
What Justice Van Fleet did say is as follows: "While '
in no sense conclusive, we have the right, and it is
most reasonable in judging of the probable character
or occupation the deceased would have pursued, to
regard with the other circumstances surrounding him
the calling of his father â since experience teaches
that children do very frequently pursue the same
general class of business as that of their parents." In
his opinion he refers to a case in the lowa reports,
where the same rule was approved in the instruction
given to a jury in nearly the same language. In fact,
the real tendency of the opinion, as well as of the rule
which it expounds, would authorize a greater verdict
for a poor man than for a rich man, for it is an un
doubted fact that the son of a rich man is a pecuniary
expense to his father, without any possibility of in
come during his minority, and a jury acting upon this
well-known fact would give the rich parent a nominal
verdict where the poor man would receive a sub
stantial one.
* LIMINATING from the subject the political
clap-trap and buncombe with which it has
* â â * been invested by the demagogues and their
organs, there can be no doubt that a strong public
demand exists for a low municipal tax rate this year.
This demand cannot very well be ignored by the
Board of Supervisors, and that body should not ig
nore it. Doubtless it would please Mayor Phelan
and the Examiner to have a tax levy of $2 10 on the
$100 valuation. Such a rate would make no end of
"politics" for them and the demagogues who follow
the leadership. But the Supervisors should not con
sider anybody's interest in this matter save that of the
tax-paying people.
The year 1898 has not been a good one for Cali
fornia, and consequently business is not prosperous
in San Francisco. The wheat crop is a failure and the
fruit crop shy. This is no time to lay the heavy
hand of the tax gatherer upon <the people. They are
not able to stand a levy of one million additional dol
lars, whether the money is necessary for public im
provements or required to carry on an extravagant
government.
Who is to spend the money is immaterial. We shall
have a new Board of Supervisors next year which, if
Republican and not chosen by Mayor Phelan and the
Third-street Boodler, will be an improvement upon
the present one. But this need not be considered
either. A tax levy greater than that of last year should
not be imposed, because the people cannot stand it.
True there are many necessary public improve
ments pressing for attention, but they should all be
postponed to another day. The new County Hospital,
to cost $400,000; the new police and fire alarm boxes,
to cost $35,000; the removal of the fire alarm station
on Brenham place, to cost $40,000; the new police
station at Seventeenth and Folsom streets, to cost
$50,000; the California-street park, to cost $75,000;
the Mission Zoo job, to cost half a million; and the
various other schemes of public beautification and
improvement can and must wait. The only thing to
be done this year is to get along as cheaply as possi
ble. It is the duty of the Supervisors to make up the
deficits and leave their successors a sufficient sum to
carry on the government until July i, 1899. No more
money than this should be raised.
An additional reason for adopting this course
consists in the fact that no money can be
expended intelligently upon permanent public
improvements under the present legal system.
The new charter may not provide a better
one, but it promises to do so and it will be well
to await the fulfillment of the promise. If the ac
cepted streets are to be repaved and the sewer system
reconstructed the work ought to be conducted under
the supervision of engineers and competent me
chanics. The Street Department is an excellent ma
chine for disbursing money, but ineffective for pro
ducing results.
Oregon soldiers now here are not starving to death.
Local people will not be surprised at this, but to the
Governor of that State the fact seemed to come as a
revelation.
THE TAX LEVY.
AGAINST THE NICARAGUA CANAL
Editor Callâ An Impression prevails to a large extent with the pubh<
that the early completion of the Nicaragua canal was an event much to
desired. Especially has this idea prevailed with the people of San Fran
cisco. To this end both political parties have put a plank in their plat
forms urging the early completion and the fostering care andsuppoft of the
Government to this enterprise.
It does seem strange that a great community should thus want to do
Itself a permanent injury and detriment to both its commercial and real
estate Interests. A novice can certainly see that the canal if completed
would create an opposition harbor and shipping depot to San Francisco, and
a very serious one at that. We have just acquired the Hawaiian Islands.
Of what benefit would their trade be to San Francisco with a Nicaragua
canal? A little hay, lumber and flour, perhaps, and all the other commerce
diverted to the Eastern States, or perhaps to Europe direct. We are about
to acquire the Philippine Islands, an empire as large as Japan, with re
sources of vast magnitude; with sugar, tobacco, rice, hemp and all the
semi-tropical products in quantities to attract the commerce of the world,
all diverted away from San Francisco and to the canal, and thence to New
York, Boston, Philadelphia and Liverpool and other European cities. China
is now in the throes of dissolution, her vast territory about to be divided up
among the nations of Europe, and all this trade, with its immense possibili
ties, to be wrested from San Franciscco and the Golden Gate.
Mr. Editor, the people of San Francisco and California certainly do
not consider the danger this coast is exposed to. They have never looked
at but one side of this question. I can readily see why they advocate the
canal: it is simply to create an opposition to the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and put fares and freights on a reasonable basis and checkmate
Collis P. Huntington. This view is all right If there was not another side
to the question, but when to attain this object we must dam the Golden
Gate and divert all the vast trade of the Orient from San Francisco to
the Nicaragua canal, then the question takes on another aspect and I can
not but think the paper to first call the attention of the property holders
and the business and commercial community to the great danger to San
Francisco the canal would be will receive the grateful approval of this com
munity and the whole people of the Northern Pacific Coast. It is not at
all surprising that the people of New York, Boston, Philadelphia and all
the Eastern cities should advocate the speedy construction of the canal; It
is to their interest to do so, and Europe, especially Liverpool, would derive
great benefit to commerce from the opening of this route; but San Fran
cisco? Never!
You have advocated and encouraged the Valley Railroad, which is now
about to make a connection with the Santa Fe, and thus have a competing
overland road. This will be a grand thing for San Francisco, and another
or two or three more overland roads would be desirable and will be required
to do the business which must of necessity open up with the Oriental trade
in the near future, providing we do not have a competing harbor at the
Nicaragua canal. I hope, Mr. Editor, you will be induced to see the threat
ened danger to San Francisco and raise the alarm in time to prevent this
great disaster to California, I have thought much on this subject, but do
not want my name attached to this publication, as it would carry no
weight. But there is another view of this question which should carry
much weight with the people that I will be pleased to communicate if you
think the subject of sufficient importance, and I hope you will publish
either the substance or an extract from the article so as to call the atten
tion of the business community of San Francisco to this subject and to the
dangers which threaten the very existence of the city. I myself am a
small property-owner in San Francisco, and I do not went property values
destroyed, so, yon see, I am not altogether a disinterested party.

The maxim that "the speed of a squad
ron is governed by its slowest ship," was
practically illustrated during the recent
French naval maneuvers, which also in
cidentally brought out the fact that there
Is a vast discrepancy between trial speed
and sea speed. A squadron consisting of
seven armored vessels and three cruisers,
practiced "keeping station" passing at
the highest uniform speed before the forts
of Brest. The speed was found to be
twelve knots, which, compared with the
credited trial speeds, is a rather consider
able reduction. The names of the fleet
in the squadron and their paper speeds
were as follows:

cording to above speeds that of the Bou

ron, but the "lame ducks" were the
Jemappes and Valmy, which could not
make over twelve knots. Similar man
euvers in Great Britain have given four
teen knots as the speed of squadrons
under like condition.
The electric launch recently ordered by
Russia in England was shipped to Kron
stadt, July 13. The contract was to make
at half-power 4V> knots per hour for ten
hours, but she made 5% knots. Boats are
now being built which will run 80 knots
without exhausting the current In the
storage battery.
A trial course of two miles In length is
to be laid off in 20 fathoms, near Ply
mouth off either Devon or the Cornish
const. It is to be used as a trial course
for large ships, the experience of late
years having shown that deep
water is required to make the heavy
draught armored ships and cruisers get
all the speed of which the engines are
capable under most economical conditions.
In shallow water it takes more power to
drive the ship at a given speed than oft
soundings.
The now French battleship Suffren of
11.870 tons is to be fitted with 20 Nlclause
water-tube boilers to develop 16,500-horsft
power. The total cost of the ship, includ
ing armament, is estimated at $5,591,755.
The Marceau, built In 1887 is also to have
a pet of the same type of boilers. The
Belleville boiler is gaining in popularity
in Great Britain, but the Niclause boiler
is now almost entirely displacing the
Belleville in the French navy.
There is great activity in the shipyards
at Kiel, Btettin, Elbing and Hamburg.
Among the orders placed by the Govern
ment are six large torpedo boat destroy
ers of thirty-three knots speed to be
ready for service early next year. Orders
have also been received from Russia,
Spain, Brazil and the Argentine.
A novel scheme of naval defense has
been suggested to the War Office and Ad
miralty of Great Britain by Major Gen
eral Crease. He proposes placing a num
ber of floating battle forts at certain im
portant localities along the coast of the
kingdom, the forts to be 11,500 tons, 400
feet length, 100 feet beam draft. 11% feet
and a speed of 8 knots. They are to have
a side armor of 12 inches tapering to 3
inches below water. Four two-story tur
rets will carry the heaviest guns made.
To each battle fort are to be attached two
battleship exterminators of 3200 tons, un
armored, with guns solely to repel toi
ptdc-boat destroyers, and their only
means of attacking battleships would be
by ramming and torpedoes. They are to
be 350 feet length, 39% feet beam and with
35,000 horse power a speed of 35 knots is
anticipated.
The cost of French battleships Is far
out of proportion to that of United States
ships of the same class, as the following

even the Fourth of July. Congress has.
at various times, appointed SDecial holi
days. In the second session of the Fifty
third Congress was passed an act making
Labor day a public holiday in the Dis
trict of Columbia, and it has recognized
the existence of certain days as holidays
for commercial purposes in such legisla
tion as the bankruptcy act, but with the
exceptions named there is no general
statute on the subject. The proclamation
of the President designating a day of
thanksgiving only makes it a holiday in
those States which provide by law for it.
The Federal courts and officers of the
United States Government, however, ob
serve the legal holidays of the States in
which they are located.
HOW FRUIT IS CRYSTALLIZEDâ S.,
Spenceville, Cal. Fruit is crystallized in
the following manner: Make a syrup
from one pound of sugar and half a pint
of water, stir until the sugar is dissolved,
then bail quickly about three or four
minutes. Try by dipping a little in cold
water. If it forms a small ball when roll
ed between the thumb and finger it has
attained the desired degree, known as the
ball. Throw the fruit to be conserved a
little at a time in tho syrup. Let it sim
mer for a moment, lift with a skimmer,
draining free from all syrup. Sprinkle
sugar thickly over boards or tin pans,
place the fruit over it in a single layer,
sprinkle over thickly with granulated
sugar and place in an oven or the sun to
dry. When dry make a syrup as before
and just before it reaches the ball de
gree add the fruit and stir with a wooden
spoon until it begins to grain and sticks
to the fruit. When cold sift off the
sugar and put out again to dry. When dry
place in boxes in layers between sheets
of waxed paper. It should be kept in a
cool, dry place.

THE DIVES

the Money.
ST. MARY SQUARE CREATED
BACON PLACE WILL ALSO UE
PURIFIED.
Mayor Phelan and the Property
Owners Benefited Will Mate
rially Assist the Park
as Projected.
The plague spot of San Francisco, op
posite St. Mary's Church, Is to be forever
removed. A beautiful park, with trees
and shrubs, will mark the place where for
many years the worst forms <>f crime and
corruption wi-re fostered, and where
thousands of human lives were wrecked.
The efforts of Father Otis and of tho
St. Marys Square Association to secure
the condemnation of the property bounded
by Dupont street, St. Mary's place, Cali
fornia and Pine streets for park purposes
were favorably considered by the Board
of Supervisors yesterday. By unanimous
vote the board pledged itself to contribute
the J75.1W0 asked as part of the $100,000
needed for condemnation purposes, and
steps will immediately be taken to enter
suit to acquire the tract.
Father Otis and Attorney Shadbume
were on hand when the board convened,
and both expressed themselves as doubt
ful concerning the action of the Supervis
ors. Father Otis .said that he feared the
board might hesitate to grant the $75,000,
in view ot the prospects for an increased
tax levy. He was tar from expecting the
unanimous favorable action of the Super
visors.
Mr. SJiadburne addressed the board at
some length, presenting the request of the
St. Mary Square Association and giving
a brief history of the efforts of the Paul
ist Fathers to remove the hotbed of vice
opposite St. Mary's Church. He stated
that the people of San Francisco and the
daily papers all favored the proposed park
and would cheerfully concur In the award
of $75,000 toward the project. It required
only an additional cent to be placed on the
tax levy, and he declared that San Fran
ciscans would think it a small price to be
paid to get rid of the collection of dens
which have so long disgraced the fair
name of the city.
No sooner had he finished than Super
visor Brltt moved "that favorable action
be taken upon the request of St. Mary's
Square Association." Dr. Clinton moved
to amend that the $75,000 asked be given
to the object, provided that the tax levy
should not exceed $1 15 for city purposes.
This amendment provoked a storm of dis
cussion, and was finally withdrawn,
whereupon the original motion went
through with a whirl.
Mayor Phelan subsequently expressed
himself as highly gratified at the action
of the board. "I am going to do all in
my power to assist the par*, project," he
said. "While we are about It Bacon place
gates and Bacon place dens will un
doubtedly have to go. There will be a
complete clean-up in that section of the
city. The Supervisors will no doubt act
on the question of closing Bacon place in
the near future. It would never do to
leave that collection of dens on the very
eoge of the new park."
Supervisor Delany, chairman of the
Committee on Health and Police, was
asked tor the reason why Bacon place
gates had been permitted to remain up
to the present time. "The Supervisors
referred that matter to my committee,"
responded Delany, but at that time
other disreputable blocks in the neighbor
hood were not purified and it seemed best
to allow the people of Bacon place to
screen themselves from the gaze of pas
sers-by. Now that the board has de
cided to fumigate that section and estab
lish a park, I can assure you the Bacon
place gates and the dens behind the gates
will have to go. There will be no delay in
taking the matter up." . _ ' . .
Rev. Father Otis announced that a sub
scription paper would be at once circu
lated to secure the $25,000 needed to sup
plement the $75,000 appropriation by the
board for paying condemnation claims.
IT CAME FROM THE
DISSECTING ROOM
THE ARM FOUND IN THE BAY
NEAR OAKLAND.
Coroner Baldwin Declares That the
Human Member Is Part
of a Medical Student's
Cadaver.
The mystery surrounding the finding of
a human arm Sunday afternoon, near the .
Eighth-street bridge, in Oakland, was dls- j
pelled by a further Investigation yester- |
day. Coroner K. O. Baldwin has exam- '
lned the member with the utmost care j
and announces In positive terms that It le j
part of a cadaver dissected by a medical
student.
From the elbow to the wrist the grew-
Borne find measures exactly ten inches. ,
while the hand itself is evidently that of a |
man of large physical proportions. The
nails are rough and ill-kept. The disar
tlculation at the elbow is done with a pre- i
cision and accuracy which only one versed j
in surgical science could accomplish, and
the skin from tho elbow to the point at
which the hand attaches has been com-
P Onlhfup P p P ef of anterior surface of the
arm, where the wrist Intervenes between
the hand and the lower forearm, is a
clean incisive cut, and this is the divid
ing line between the skin which renting
o!f the hand and that part of the arm
which has been denuded of its cuticle.
This in Coroner Baldwin s opinion, is a
conclusive argument as to the use to
which the arm has been put.
While the skin and flesh are missing
from the arm. the entire system of ten
dons, arteries and nerves are present and
in perfect condition. These all have the
appearance of having been segregated
from each other In the style of and ac
< ordlng to the methods In vogue in the
tiiÃÃectlng room.
In the meantime, with the arm thus ac
counted for, the mystery of the floating
),'â¢;.<! off Berkeley )>â¢ ach is yet unsolved.
The fact that the head was seen at a
:r remote from that at
which the arm was taken from the water
would ff Hnflf suggest that the two are
In no mannor connected. In addition to
this It is well known that the heads of
dissecting room cadavers are never
thrown away.

SHE JUST WON'T, AND THAT'S ALL.
Gretchen Lyons Objects to Tights and Riles tHe
Alcazar Management,
Gretchen Lyons, leading lady at the Alcazar, is pitting her "won't"
against the management's "will," and the balance of the company are bet
ting on the results.
"All the Comforts of Home" is the Innocent cause of this disturbance
in the little theatrical -umily. Manager Thall decided to put on the com
edy, provided, of course, that the reign of the <"hinese play will permit of
anything else being done at the Alcazar this season â and to Miss Lyons
naturally fell tho part of "Fifi."
"Fifi" wears tightsâ for one fleeting brief Instantâ and that is the rea
son Miss Lyons won't play and that Mark Thall speaks "contract," and
Belasco keeps discreetly out of the way.
The leading lady has no reason to offer for refusing to appear with her
nether limbs incased In the tender clinging folds of esthetic silk stockinet.
She just says "I won't," and that settles it as far as she is concerned.
The management unfortunately la not so easily settled. Genial Mark
Thall, to the surprise of all, has for once lost his temper, and says that
Miss Lyons will wear those tights or else he will know the reason why.
Dark, deep and dreadful hint? are dropped, in which "cork leg, pigeon
toed, knock-kneed and bandy-legged" figure conspicuously and outraged
authority intimates the possibility of putting on a play in which the entire
company will have to appear in tights.
Miss Lyons considers that the dignity of her position as leading lady
precludes the wearing of tights, though phe admits that she sees no Immo
rality In the tight-fitting, flesh-colored coverings. In her difficulty she has
appealed to Manager Belasco, but Belasco is suffering the pangs of too
much prosperity. "Go to Thall." said the manager to the actress, "I am
making too much money, and there is trouble enough for me for the pres
ent."
And so the matter rests. If the controversy should be brought into
court her professional sisters are In a position to testify in Miss Lyons' fa
vor and swear there is no physical defect, and above all no cork.

to end their days In a Spanish prison.
The Charles E. Moody sailed from Phil

he guessed the dons would have their

with merchant prizes. Still a bright look
out was kept, and one night when in the
Bermudas a big steam vessel hove In
sight, and all hands were called, and ev
ery man had his heart In his mouth. The
Moody had every stitch of canvas set,
and was reeling off her ten knots as reg
ularly as the hour came around. It was
in the mate's watch that the big black
mass hove up out of the darkness. Not
a light was visible, but the hull kept ris
ingl and rising and looming up blacker
and blacker. Captain Leonard wis call

smokestacks and a fighting mast were
visible. The warship paid no attention
to the wind-jammer, but kept on her
course and she was soon hull down, much
to the relief of the crew.
The last steamer for St. Michael this

CORONER'S VERDICTS.
Three Accidental Deaths for Which
There Was No One to Blame.
An Inquest was held yesterday by Coro

sey, a coal minor, who died on September
5 In St. Luke's Hospital, In this city, from
the effects of injuries received by being
caught between the side of a cage and
a shaft in the Tesla coal mine, Contra
Costa County.
The Jury returned a verdict to the ef
fect that the death was accidental, and
censured the Tesla Coal Company for not
producing witnesses at the inquest.
Verdicts of accidental death were re
turned in the cases of Michael J. RUey
run over by the San Jose train at the
Intersection of Treat avenue with Twenty
second street, and Simon Flaherty, run
over by an electric car at Eighteenth and
Church streets. It was shown by the
witnesses that the motorman and the
engineer in both cases rang the bells and
gave sufficient warning to the unfortu
nate men, but that one stepped back on
the track Just before the engine struck
him, and the other was concealed from
the motorman by a curve In the road.

Furloughs Optional for the Men
Being Mustered Out â Sequel of
the Attack on thÂ« Thomas
Family.
As the result of a personal encounter
early yesterday morning between two of
the officers of the Fifty-first lowa Regi
ment, both are now. under arrest, and
one of them is nursing a fractured shoul
der. The affair occurred just outside of
the mess tent of the field and staff offi
cers during breakfast, and the partici
pants were Captain J. T. Davidson, the
regimental adjutant, and Surgeon First
Lieutenant Donald Macrae. The affair
was one of those unfortunate kind that
are the result of a quick temper and the
excitement of the moment. Neither officer
engaged in the difficulty when seen would
discuss it, but from other sources the
facts were learned. Captain Davidson
and Lieutenant Macrae are members of
the field and staff mess, and the former
officer is at present the caterer of it.
It appears that until quite recently Lieu
tenant Frank M. Compton, battalion ad
jutant of the Second battalion, was the
caterer. Some of the members of the
mess thought that it was costing them
rather high, so Lieutenant Compton re
signed in favor of Captain Davidson, in
order to sea If he could reduce the ex
penses.
Yesterday morning at breakfast Lieu
tenant Compton found fault with the cof
fee, and Captain Davidson replied that !
it was the same kind that had been JJur- i
nished by Lieutenant Compton when he
was caterer. Here it was that Lieutenant
Macrae, in an innocent wwaty t ventured the
remark that it did not taste the same, i
Captain Davidson lost his temper, and !
hotly demanded of the lieutenant if he !
meant to Insinuate that he was a liar.
Macrae replied warmly that he did not, |
but insisted that the coffee was off-color :
Just the same, and having taken his po- I
sition he refused to retreat. One word !
led to another, and the art'air came to a |
head when Captain Davidson fired a cup
Of the coffee at the lieutenant. He missed
hifl mark, and concluding that he could j
do more effective work at close range he
invited the lieutenant outside the tent, j
The young sui*geon quickly 'accepted his!
Invitation to transfer the scene of hos
tilities. When the officers reached the i
outside they lost no time In getting down ,
to work, with the whole regiment look- !
ing on. They clinched and the lieutenant j
fell on top of the captain. At this junc
ture Colonel Loper appeared, and order- ;
ed both officers to desist and go to their ;
quarters under arrest. They promptly j
obeyed. Colonel Loper reported the af- 1
fair to General Miller, who commended j
him for placing the men under arrest.
Later in the day Captain Davidson made
most ample and full apologies to Lieu
tenant Macrae for losing his temper, and j
as far as any personal feeling is con- i
cerned the two officers are again friends. t
The injury to Captain Davidson's shoul- :
der will incapacitate him for duty for j
some days. In view of the facts that the '
officers have shaken hands, Colonel Lo
per stated that he would probably re
lease them from arrest to-day, and that
no further steps would be taken in the |
matter, as the incident would be consid- i
ered closed.
It is possible that First Lieutenant Cave
Johnson, Company H, First Tennessee
Regiment, may have to appear before a
court martial to answer the charge of j
conduct prejudicial to good order and j
military discipline. The affair is being j
kept very quiet by the officers of the
regiment, and there Is a possibility that \
it may be smoothed over without any
formal proceedings. It appears that dur
ing the absence of Captain O'Brien, com- I
manding the company, that Lieutenant !
Johnson, for some trilling offense, placed i
some or the men under arrest. It is
claimed that the offense did not warrant !
the arrest, and when Captain O'Brien re- j
turned he released them. This is said
to have nettled the lieutenant, and sev
eral days after he refused >io take the
company out and drill it when ordered by
his captain. Charges are said to have
been preferred by Captain O'Brien against
Lieutenant Johnson, and these Colonel
Smith !s now Investigating, with the view
of se*lng if the difficulty cannot be
amicably adjusted.
Captain \\ hitthorn, Company B, First
Tennessee Regiment, makes a very plain
statement regarding the alleged attack
upon the negro H. A. Bailey, said to have
been made a few nights ago in Union
Square by Privates J. B. Spencer and
George H. Russ of his company. He is
now making an investigation, and he de
clares that if the men are guilty they !
shall certainly be punished. From what
Captain Whltthorn says the two men
named, with another soldier, were in the
square when they met Bailey and had
some words with him. The-y then left the
negro. At the time the two soldiers are
said to have been almost helplessly drunk.
From what can be learned it appears that
Bailey returned and renewed the trouble
with the soldiers, bringing with him a
club. He got the best of the two soldiers
and they were put to flight. Neither
Spencer nor Russ is a Tennesseean. If
the captain ascertains that the men were
at fault in provoking the negro he will
prefer charges against them, but it seems
that Bailey is to blame for returning and
renewing the trouble.
Colonel Smith yesterday returned the
report of the board of officers, appointed
to assesÃ the damage done the property of
the Thomas family, to General Miller. The
board fixed the damage at $231, which
Colonel Smith refused to pay. HJb refusal
Is based more or less upon a technical
ground. From the report of the board it
is shown that the soldiers of the Tennes
see regiment a.lone are responsible, and as
it is an established fact that some of the
soldiers of the lowa and Kansas regi
ments were in the crowd that damaged
the property, Colonel Smith is unwilling to
pay the entire damage and thus make it
appear that his regiment was entirely to
blame. He had a long conference with
General Miller upon the subject, with tne
result that the latter will appoint a board
of Inquiry to ascertain just who is re
sponsible, and that if more than one regi
ment was concerned just what proportion
of the damage each shall pay.
General Miller has issued the following
order: "The assembling: of enlisted men
In crowds or large parties beyond the
limits of their respective camps is pro
hibited. This order applies particularly
to the streets In the vicinity of the Pre
sidio as well as to the Presidio proper
The patrol guard will break up and dis
perse all such crowds and will arrest and
confine in the guardhouse at the Presidio
all soldiers who fail to comply with the
orders of the commanding officer of the
guard to so disperse and return to their
camps."
In regard to the question of furlough
ing the men of the Seventh and Sixth
regiments, now being mustered out. it
has been decided by tne War Department
that the men can be mustered out here
without the thirty days' furlough; but if
they accept this they get no pay for the
thirty days of furlough and no transpor
tation to their homes. It is needless to
say that none of the soldiers will avail
themselves o/ this generous offer made by
the Government.
The judge advocate of the independent
division, in his report to the War Depart
ment, has some interesting figures regard
ing the trials of the men by court-martial
A total of 7SI cases have been tried here
since the troops came, and of this num
ber only eighteen were acquitted. Six of
this number acquitted were regulars. One
hundred and ninety-three regulars and
588 volunteers were tried. There were
only thirteen serious cases, and only four
of these were regulars.

tee of the whole, at 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning, when the present fiscal year
taxes will be fixed. The matter came up
before the board at its regular session
yesterday, when Supervisor Clinton of
fered a resolution amendatory of the mo
tion made by Britt to devote $75,000 to the
purchase of land embraced in the pro
posed St. Mary's Park. Clinton's resolution
pledged the Supervisors to keep the city
and county levy down to $1 15 and appro
priated the sum asked for by Mr. Shad
burne for the park.
There was such strong opposition to the
resolution that Clinton withdrew it and
allowed the park appropriation to* be
passed. He gave notice, though, that he
would reintroduce that portion relating
to the tax levy later in the day.
Mayor Phelan asked when the Finance
Committee would meet for the purpose of
! taking up the levy, and after a consulta
j tion among the members it was decided
' to meet Wednesday morning in commit
tee of the whole. Clinton then announced
that he would present his resolution at
that time.
Rottanzi, in the course of a speech on
the tax levy, took occasion to denounce
the Examiner for insinuating that he was
not likely to support a low tax rate, 'me
doctor declared that as some of the de
partmentsânotably the hospitalâ were
conducted, $1 15 might not be sufficient to
meet the requirements of the government,
but he certainly was in favor of a low
rateâ just as low as the city could get
along withâ and he would certainly oppose
any attempt to make any material in
crease over the present rate.
Smith then offered the following reso
lution, which was referred to the Finance
Committee:
"Resolved, That in making appropria
tions for this fiscal year, of the
amount set aside for school purposes a
provision be made in said levy requiring
the Board of Education to expend there
from a sum not to exceed $30,000 for the
erection of a schoolhouse in the district
west of Castro street."
The clerk was instructed to notify the
heads of the various municipal depart
ments of Wednesday's meeting, in order
that they might attend if they cared to
do so.
The board received bids for a power
plant at the Almshouse, and referred
them to the Hospital Committee. Bids
were also received for 100 Keyler boxes
for the fire alarm and police telegraph
system, and they were referred to the
Fire Department Committee.
Permission was granted the National
Athletic Club to hold a boxing exhibition
during the month of October.
The following contractors were srranted

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â There was a con
tinuation of apparently urgent liquidation on
â the Stock Exchange this morning, caused by
covering of short stocks, which speedily wiped |
out the recoveries of Saturday and carried
prices sharply below the lowest level of last
Friday for nearly all standard stocks. But the
pressure of liquidation seemed to be relieved
by noon and there was a disposition to pick I
up stocks quietly and to accord support to !
weak spots, notably St. Paul. The dealing In !
odd lots in some of the standard dividend j
payers also became quite a feature, indicating
a supply of money for Investment, notwith
standing the stiffness of the local call money
market. Weakness In some of the Industrial
specialties caused the market to â¢ease off again j
before the close, but the last prices of the rail
roads were in many cases at sharp recoveries j
from the lowest. Nevertheless marked net
losses resulted from the day's trading, owing
to the severity of the pressure early Id the !
day. There was continued apprehension over
the outlook for money, but the Government
crop report and the snow storms In the West
were also material factors. The crop report,
though bearish on the corn crop as a whole, I
showed sharp deterioration for Kansas, Ne
braska and lowa. This, coupled with the snow
storms In the corn belt, was very largely In
dicated In the weakness of Rock Island, Bur
lington and Union Pacific. There was no ac
tual development to account for a decline of
apprehension over the money market outlook,
and how far this feeling was connected with a
reported conference of leading. bankers Is not
certain. There was a growth of a conviction
that there is a large available supply of money
at leant outside of New York City. Money
rates are easy at Interior points, and there Is
even buying of commercial paper In the New
York market by Western banks. It Is quite
possible also that a larger amount of the new
Government Ss might be made available both
for purposes of circulation and as security for
Government deposits in the banks than has
yet been the case ' In the event of any real
stringency or money. Nevertheless the drain
of cash from the banks to the sub-treasury on
account of subscriptions to the loan continues,
and the sub-treasury was even a creditor, at
the clearing house to-day on account of an I
accumulation of drafts from Interior depository
banks in which Government deposits have ex
ceeded their security by reason of heavy In
ternal revenue collections. There were rumors
all day of engagements of gold for Import, but
none of these were confirmed. The easier tone
of the money market and the consequent recov
ery In the stock market were apparently duo
to other causes. The large foreign demand for
wheat a/id the evidence of underlying strength
in the wheat market In face of the bearish I
Government crop report had some influence In
the stock market. The bond market was dull
and showed some weakness In sympathy with
stocks. Total sales. 11,670.000.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were generally dull to-day on the
Austrian news, on the report of French occu
pation of Fashoda and on a telegram stating
that the Chilean Government has called out
6000 men of the National Guard. The collapse
of Argentine stork* was particularly marked.
Consols were also slow. Americans opened flat,
turned weaker on selling here and closed at
about the lowest on the continuance of New
York. Later business wu assisted by heavy
purchases by Paris and the Cape. Gold was
In very strong demand at 77s l%d. New York

that gold may be withdrawn from the Bank of
England to-morrow for shipment to New York,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 12.â Lower Liverpool cables,
big receipts In the Northwest and the Increase
In the world's visible supply jind the Increase
of the shipments from Russia, which seemed
to discredit the reported crop disaster In that
country, started wheat a trifle lower. The corn
market was also weak and had a depressing
Influence on wheat. Trade was dull and longa
liquidated freely from the start, with a good
sprinkling of selling orders from the outside.
Later, however. It was found that the North
west markets were holding Btrong and higher
in spite of big receipts there, and that both
cash and futures were advancing. That, to
gether with light speculative offerings here,
alarmed the early sellers and there was some
heavy covering for a time, which turnÂ«l prices
upward. The statistical news was very bull
ish and was largely Instrumental In keeping
the price on the advance as it came to the
knowledge of the traders. The close was %c
higher for September and December rose %Â®
Warm weather, large receipts and an Increase
in the visible supply weakened corn. The Gov
ernment report waa also a disappointment to
the bulls. The pit sentiment was very bearish
and there were few buyers on hand to take the
offerings. The close was %c lower on the day
Oats held firm under a good demand for Sep
tember from shippers. Trade waa quite active
May gained %c.
Provisions were firm on an extensive de
mand, together with heavy buying of lard and
ribs. The range was very narrow and the
close unchanged.

HIDES. TALLOW. WOOL AND HOPS.
The circular of W. B. Sumner & Co. says:
"To a certain extent there seems to be a
slight Improvement in the Hide trade. Sales
have been made at full values to the tanners,
quite large lots have been shipped to the East
on orders, and to-day there are small stocks
In the market.
"The war created a demand for certain lines
of leather, and In consequence Hides have
been firm. We might add also that Hides at
this season are more desirable on account of
the condition and short hair. The htgh values
for harness leather have created a demand for
the heavier grades of steers at liberal fig
ures an.l it looks as though the present values
will remain for a time at least. For the local
m.irkft w* quote:
"Wet Palted Heavy Steers are In demand for
hampns and skirting.
"Wet Salted Medium and Light Steers are
fairly active.
"Wet Salted Cows sell quite readily.
"Tallow continues fairly active at full prices.
The dry season In California nas lessened the
output of Tallow, and the supplies which are
now coming In the market are hardly suffi
cient for the demand of trade. The better
grades of Tallow are freely bought. Clean,
hard Tallow Is In demand and No. 2 stock
fairly active."

GUESSING AT
WATER BILLS
A Half Million Gallons
Disappear Monthly.
MYSTERY OF THE METER
SAID TO HAVE AN OUTLET IN A
LOST SEWER.
All Sorts of Experiments Are Being
Made to Keep the City Treas
ury From Complete
Bankruptcy.
Oakland Office San Francisco fall,
MR Broadway, Sept. 11
The astonishing discovery was made
to-day v that the bills for the use of water
at the City Hall for July and August
are baaed on guesswork. These bills are
now being Investigated, and to-day May
or Thomas, City Engineer Clement and
Councilman Henneberry, chairman of the
Water Committee, made a series of in
vestigations, which brought to light a
state of affairs which they declare to be
mysterious.
The bill from the Oakland Water Com
pany for July is as follows:
â¬90.000 raJlona of water for the City Hall
Park, at 20 cents per 1000 gallons.. $127 15
City Hail, two upper floors, 4S persons;
lower floor, SO prisoners 10 85
Total $138 00
For September the City Hall Park consumed
485.750 gallons, costing {97 16, making the bill
1108. . â¢ . -
The City Hall park consists of less than
one-third of an acre of lawn, and the
Board of Works doÂ©Â» not believe any
Fuch amount of water, or that one-tenth
of the amount of water, could possibly
be used. Yet dally readings of the meter
madÂ© by the Mayor and City Engineer
for two weeks show that this amount of
water Is actually passirg through the
meter.
"Thin matter is a mystery." Bald the
Mayor this afternoon, "and I am satis
fied that the bills are made by gruess. The
bills showed that the water used for the
City Hall park cost? by the meter very
large amounts, and that the water for the
City Hall is quite reasonable. Now I have
discovered that the meter through which
thin tremendous lake of fresh water
pasaeo every month le not used by the
1 Ity Hall park, not even one gallon of
It. The City Hall park, the Health of
fice, the Police Department and the kitch
en in the City Prison, all draw their wa
ter from the meter on Fifteenth street,
which If not the meter at all from which
the measurements are taken.
"It would actually appear as though
the water ran round in a circle and kept
passing through the meter, for that
arr.ount of water would flood the City
Hall and fill the prison every day. I can
only account for It by the suggestion
rhat in some place or other the pipe con
n^cfs with the sewer, for by no other
means could such a vast volume of water
ever !..<â¢ carried off without serious dam
age. The old hall has been so changed
since it waa built that we cannot find
w.here its sewer runs to. and consequently
we are at a loss to discover where the
water goes.
"It appears to me as if the water com
pany were honest in the matter, for when
we refused to pass their bills they pro
posed that we should let the opposition
company put in a meter and take water
from it. The whole thing is a mystery, '
but a very expensive one for the city, j
There is a â¢well under trie fire tower whtel.
formerly supplied the City Hall. There
Is no good reason why a windmill should
not be erected over that well and made
to supply the whole building. Certainly
i splendid windmill would not cost more
than a few months' water bills."

A Battle Creek food concern (The

jected To by Deacon Williams
as a Text Book.
OAKLAND, Sept. 12.â "Who Wrota the
BibleJ" Washington Gladden'sbook. has
caused a sensation among the members
of the First Congregational Church.

strenuous protest against the work as a
text book for the adult Bible class yes

to be destructive to the faith, while Rich
ard H. Chamberlain, the Bible class lead
er, defends his use of the book. The lat
ter concedes that it does not admit the
verbal inspiration of the Bible, but meets
the objection in a most reverential man

C. R. Brown, the pastor of the church,
are in a direct line with those of Author
Gladden.

This is considered a very important mat
ter, i

to be inquired into. We will take up that
work and push it for all it is worth."

OAKLAND, Bept. 12.â C. E. Kinard has

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 189 S.
A LADY TO
RISK ARREST
Will Attempt to Give a
Street Address.
SOCIALISTS TO TEST THE LAW
EDITOR WTLXINS SAYS A PER
MIT IS NOT NEEDED.
Will Not Lack Legal Talent When
the Cases Come Up in the
Police Court, as They
Probably Will.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 12.
Tho Socialist Labor party is preparing
to make a contest regarding the constitu
tionality of the ordinance regulating
speaking on the streets. There are now
half a dozen Socialists out on bail,
charged with speaking in public without
the necessary permit from the Mayor or
the Chief of Police.
M. \V. Wllkins, editor of the State party
organ, was the first man arrested, and he
states that "educational meetings" will
be held at Tenth and Broadway every
evening during the week with the excep
tion of Sunday. Every night a man will
be put forward who will be arrested by
the police, and ball will be put up until
the legality of the ordinance is decided.
The prisoners have all demanded Jury
trials, and the first one will come off in
about a week.
When Sergeant Peterson made the ar
rest of Wllkins he was handed a copy of
the constitution, and told Wllkins that he
preferred to follow the Oukland ordi
nance. To-morrow evening it is announced
that a lady will be put forward. She is
Mrs. Jane A. Roulston, the candidate of
the Socialist party for State Superintend
ent of Public Instruction. Her address is
to be delivered at Tenth and Broadway.
It is probable that the lady will be re
leased on her own recognizance.
Several lawyers have declared that the
Oakland ordinance will probably be found
to be sound, as a matter of public policy,
not framed to prevent free speech, but to
prevent inconvenience by drawing crowds
in the center of the city. When the case
comes to trial there will be no lack of
legal talent in behalf of the Socialists.
SCHOOLS AND TAX LEVY.
The Board of Education Estimates
Before the City Council.
OAKLAND, Sept. 12.â The Board of
â  Education appeared before the City Coun
| cil to-night to discuss the estimates of
the School Department, preparatory to
. fixing the tax levy for the current year.
The first discussion arose over the mo
j tion of Mr. Cuvellier to raise the Auditor's
estimate for a new building as an annex
to the manual training school from $5000 !
;to $10,000. Cuvellier surprised the lobby |
Iby making a defense of the manual !
: school. Mr. Henneberry reminded Cuvel
: Her that only he had said the schools
were no good and the gentleman from the
First said that was another matter.
The sum of $3000 for permanent improve
ments to grounds was cut out on motion
i of Mr. Pringle.
Director Redington made a plea that no
! cuts be made. He said that at present
1 the Board of Education is paying Berke
i ley for educating several children and
1 that the board would keep the Oakland
I schools open as long Â«U5 the money appro
: priated by the Council would last.
Counci'man Glrard said that the Board
; of Education could be trusted with the
; amount allowed and moved that the Au
â  dl tor's estimate of $256,796 be reduced only
- the $5000 for a new site, and his motion ;
', prevailed. The High School estimates were '
j then taken up. Dr. Todd said that the
contracts were all let for the year and
no reductions could be made, but $500 wa*
; cut off. leaving It at $43,565. The Chabot
'' Observatory estimate was not touched.
Hoodoo Instead of "The Mascct."
OAKLAND, Sept. 12.â The Martens
Opera Company came to grief at the Mac
donough Theater to-night. Many of the
company boarded at the Galindo Hotel,
and Mrs. J. Allen, the proprietress, could
not collect for the board bills to-day, so
this evening the property was attached.
Martin Kattenbury, the manager, is held
responsible for $262 75, part of which Is as
signed claims for salaries of chorus girls
and others. The company was to have
presented "The Mascot" to-night, but In
stead the hoodoo appeared.
Beulah Park Camp Meeting.
OAKLAND, Sept. 12.â The camp meet
ing at Beulah Park, East Oakland, under

F. K. Shattuck. A verdict was returned
that death was due to paralysis caused by
an accidental fall from a street car.
BROWNE HAS A STRONG
PULL AT WASHINGTON
HIS SUPERIORS ARE HIS BEST
FRIENDS.
Sufferers From the Moscow Bank
Failure Fear That Their Charges
Will Be Quietly Side
tracked-
When Secret Service Agent Browne was
met recently by Messrs. Krlgbaum and
Tarpey and confronted by them with
charges of having wrecked a bank. Bold
valueless stock and similar deviations
from the path of righteousness he waved
them aside with the expression, "Well,
gentlemen, you will find that you have
bumped up against a brick wall."
An investigation Into that gentleman's
relations with the heads of the depart
ment shows that the wall is a very strong
or.) and unusually high. In fact, Mr.
Browne and his brother, Clarence Brune,
appear to be members of a clan held to
gether by bonds stronger perhaps than
blood relationship.
Browne^ great friend at Washington is
Frank A. "Vanderlip, Assistant Secretary
of the Treasury, and it is said that he is
an uncle of the illustrious secret service
agent of this district. Mr. Vanderlip oc
cupies half of Lyman D. Gage's desk, and
all correspondence passes through Van
derlip'B hands before Gage has an oppor
tunity to see it. Of course, Vanderlip will
have the first look at the charges brought
against Browne and Brune, and interested
parties are anxiously waiting to see what
he will do with them.
Another friend at court is John E.
Wilkie, who recently succeeded William
P. Hazon as Chief of the Secret Service
Department. Browne, Brune, Vanderlip
and Wilkie were close friends in Chicago
before they got their fingers in the Fed
eral Department. Vanderlip a newspaper
man, was close to Lyman D. Gage, and
secured the appointment as his secretary
Then the combination began to work. It
was suddenly discovered that Hasen was
inefficient, and he was removed to make
way for Wilkie. Clarence Brune. one
time cashier of the Moscow National
Bank, was railroaded into the bond de- ',
partment. N. R. Harris*, secret service !
agent for the California division, was
suddenly informed that his office was de
clared vacant and that he would be suc
ceeded by Sprague, who was given a
ninety days' appointment. At the close
of Sprague's ninety days Browne ap-
Reared with his credentials and took
charge of the office.
Sufferers from the failure of the Mos- j
cow National Bank learned of Browne's <
presence in this city, and immediately i
made charges against him, only to find |
to their dismay that the charges had to
be presented to his bosom friendâ a man
with sufficient "pull" to lop off the head
of any Federal official who attempts to :
press 'the charges home, and to be in- 1
formed by Browne himself that they were j
"bumping up against a stone wail."
A SOLDIER IN DISGRACE.
Edward Montgomery of the Califor-
nia Artillery Convicted of
Begging.
Edward Montgomery, a private in Bat
tery D, California Artillery, was con
victed by Judge Conlan yesterday on a
charge of begging, and was remanded
into the custody of the military author
ities.
Montgomery was recently granted a
furlough of fourteen days to enable him
to go East. Instead of doing so he re
mained In the city and begged money
from respectable people at the ferry de
Â§ot. He was watched for several days
y Policeman Dowd and finally arrested.
The Judge in convicting Montgomery
remarked that he regretted very much
that any one wearing a soldier's uniform
should have descended so low as to be
come a common beggar, degrading not
only himself but his comrades, and he
hoped the military authorities would se
verely deal with mm.
Montgomery is not a native son. but
belongs to tne East, and enlisted here

JAMES G. FAIR'S ESTATE.
First National Banfc Makes Applica-
tion for a Partial Distri
bution.
The First National Bank of this city
has made an application to the Superior
Court for the partial distribution of thfi
estate of the late James O. Fair. The !
bank is at present assignee of -a* number ,
of the legatees â  and devisees of the es- i
tate, and seeks to have the estate dis
tributed that the long standing claims may
be adjusted and the property turned over
to the beneficiaries. Attorneys Mitchell
and McEnerney represented the estate
when the application was made - yester
day. Several witnesses cognizant of the
facts surrounding the application of the '
bank for the partial distribution of the
estate were put on the stand. There was
no opposition to the application and it
was submitted. An opinion will be hand
ed down in a few days.

Horses Driven to Death.
Two cases of driving horses to death
have been called to the attention of the
officers of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. One is that of
Tom Johnson, third officer of the steamer
City of Peking. He hired a double team ;
and rockaway from the Comstock Stables,
at 624 Third "street, and drove down the
country. On the way back one of the ani
mals died from exhaustion from over
driving and the other was dragged back
to Fo'.som and Twenty-fourth streets by
a fresh animal. It, too, died while being
taken in the society's ambulance to the
hospital for sick horses.
The other case is that of two young
men working for George Coswell of 415

CHIEF LEES
NOT READY
TO PROCEED
Asks for More Time
in the Botkin Case.
THE HEARING TO GO OVER
GOVERNOR BUDD WILL HEAR
AFFIDAVITS THURSDAY.
Has Selected the Maple Room of the
Palace Hotel for the Pur
pose of Holding thÂ»
Hearing.
Governor Budd will not pass upon the
matter of the extradition of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkln this morning. The chief executive
of the State was ready to receive the pa
pers upon which he must pass, but Chief
of Police Lees was not prepared in the
matter, and asked that the proceedings
go over until, a later date.
He thought that the mass of affidavits,
which he has collected in this city, and
which are supplemental to those sent
from Delaware, would be ready for pre
sentation to-morrow. This was not sat
isfactory to Governor Budd. Some time
since he set aside that day for a confer
ence at Sacramento with the directors of
the various insane asylums throughout
the State. Men will be present from the
many public institutions, and the Gover
nor declined to change plans formulated
for the meeting with them, thus putting
them to much inconvenience. It was then
determined to set the hearing for Thurs
day morning at 10 o'clock. In keeping
with his determination to make the in
quiry a public one, Governor Budd an
nounced that he had selected the Maple
Room of the Palace . Hotel as the place
at which he would receive the affidavits
upon which the extradition proceedings
are based.
Chit Lees is resorting to every arti
fice to get certain evidence before Gover
nor Buad. He fears that he will not have
the right to present witnesses at the in
quiry and fears that his case against Mrs.
Botkin may thus be weakened.
Governor Budd is not sitting as a com
mitting magistrate and therefore cannot
hear evidence as to the innocence or guilt
of th<? party accused. He is acting in his
official capacity of chief executive of this
State and can only pass upon two ques
tions:
Is Mrs. Botkin a fugitive from justice?
Can she be extradited and sent to Dela
ware?
Chief Lees, suspecting: that he will not
have the right to present witnesses, i..is
found a way to -lace this evidence before
the Governor. It is understood to be his
plan to incorporate with the original ex
tradition papers all the affidavits bear-
Ing upon tiie case that have been collected
In this State. These will include all the
depositions regarding Mrs. Botkln's life
here, together with all the information
collected by the police as to the purchase
of candy and of arsenic. By riling all this
mass of testamentary evidence with Gov
ernor Budd Lees hopes that it will have
as much effect as if the witnesses were
present.
It is believed that all this precaution
has been labor thrown away and that it
will have no weight in the disposition of
the case. It seems useless, because even
If the woman now held on the terrible
charge had confessed her guilt to Lees
such evidence would not be admissible
at these proceedings. The Governor's
duty in the premises is merely to receive
and pass upon a request from the Gov
ernor of Delaware, who asks that a
woman now In this State be extradited
for an offense alleged to have been com
mitted in Delaware. Thus he has but the
simple duty to performâ first, to deter
mine whether she is a fugitive and, sec
ond, whether he shall order her extra
dition upon the showing made by the au
thorities of Delaware.
"Upon a request by telephone. I met
Governor Budd this morning for the first
time since the Botkin case opened," said
Chief Lees yesterday. "Through the
newspapers he had heard that we pro
posed to lay before him Governor Tun
nel! request for the extradition of Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin and the evidence that we
have gathered, and it was with regard to
this that he wished to talk.
"He informed me that If I could be
ready by Tuesday morning he would be
willing to listen to our case then, but
that unless we were he would be obliged
to put it over until Thursday.
"As there are still some matters we
must arrange, I told him that I could
not possibly turn our case over to him
until Tuesday afternoon at the earliest,
bo he set Thursday morning as the date.
"I asked him why Wednesday would
not do as well, and he explained that
State matters of importance would re
quire his presence in Sacramento on that
day. He will take the late train Tues
day evening for the Capital and will re
turn by the last train Wednesday night.
If possible I shall deliver the papers to
him just before he leaves."
Speaking of the case generally Chief
Lees continued: "Those who look for
something sensational in the affidavit of
John P. Dunning will be disappointed.
It is not of the importance that has been
attached to it. In fact, I have several
from other sources that are of far more
Importance and Interest to our case. The
additional affidavits from Delaware ar
rived to-day, but until they have gone
Into the hands of the Governor I must
decline to make them public."
Attorney Wheeler of Humboldt County
is chafing under the delay which has
characterized Chief Lees' preparation of
the case against Mrs. Botkin. He came
to this city at the Instance of her friends.
and will play an important â¢ part in the
legal struggle which must ensue before
the end of the case is reached.
The attorneys for the defense were not
perturbed over the story published yes
terday to the effect that a seal and string
from Haas' candy store had been found
in the room formerly occupied by Mrs.
Botkin. They characterized It as a bold
fake, claiming It had no bearing on the
case of their client. Since she gave up
her apartment on August 4 the room has
been thoroughly cleansed twice, and has
been 6ccupied by a transient lodger. They
affirm that they have no fear of the out
come of the case. If Mrs. Botkin be ex
tradited on the evidence already produced
they contend that it will upset all the law
of the country-
It has not been determined as vet
whether Mrs. Botkin will attend the pro
ceedings before Governor Budd. Her
presence is not necessary, but she may
desire to hear the evidence upon which
the police expect to send her to Delaware
to stand trial on the double charge of
murder.
The defense believes that the discovery
of the half of a seal bearing the mark
of Haas on its face, has been made at a
suspiciously late date. Evidence has pre
viously been developed to show that the
mysterious purchaser of the candy wanted
the box so arranged that she could place
a present in with the candies. In view
of this It is held to be unlikely that Miss
Heney and Miss Dlttmer would place a
â¢waxen seal upon the knot of the string
with which the box was fastened.
â â¦ â
THF BURSTING OF
A YELLOW BUBBLE
Barnes Brands the Chronicle With
the Mark of the
Fake.
According to the statement of A. W.
Barnes, proprietor of the Hotel Victoria,
the whole absurd story which appeared in
a local paper ye: erday morning in which
It is alleged that evidence conclusive of
Mrs Botkin's guilt has been found in her
abandoned apartments at the hotel, is
proved to be a fabrication of the rankest
type.
It was alleged that on Thursday lust
Mr Barnes for the first time since Mrs.
Botkln left his hotel opened the door to
hVr apartments and there 'discovered lying
upon the floor at his feet a fancy tie
Ftrtng and seal, such as Georje Haas uses
in wrapping his bonbon packages. To lend
the semblance of Strong evidence to this
alleged discovery the statement is flatly
made that since it was abandoned by Mrs.
Botkin the rofci had been neither opened,
occupied nor cleansed and that papers and
litter of all sorts strewed the floor.
During an interview last evening Mr.
Barnes s'>oke bitterly of the animus to
ward himself that was evident throughout
the story, and took occasion to take up
each detail separately to brand it as an
exaggeration or clear-cut falsehood. Said
he:
"The statement that the room has not
been occupied since Mrs. Botkin left it is
untrue. It was occupied for three or four
days by one of the numerous transient
guests who come to us. The room has
been unlocked and open nearly all of the
time, and has twice been thoroughly
cleansed, and this prior to the discovery
of the seal that is spoken of.
"The description of that seal Is the
rankest exaggeration I ever heard of.
There were no pink and green strings,
nor Â«trings of any color. There was only
a fragment <if a seal and that was almost
unrecognizable as coming from Mr. Haas.
It was simply a bit of paper that could
come into the room in a dozen ways
blown in. left here by the last occupant
or dropped by one of the children. That
It waÂ». left there by Mrs. Botkin is more
than improbable in the light of the fact
that the room has been twice cleansed,
once occupied and always unlocked.
"I understand the reason why the story
was written. 1 know, in fact, that it was
nothing more than an attempt to injure
me. and 1 wish now to characterize the
fabrication as a lie from start to finish.
It was about as true a story as the pic
ture of me that accompanied it was a
likeness."
The statement of Mr. Barnes is authen
ticated by that of Mrs. Lauretta Simpson,
who in the same articK- Is said to have
been the companion of Mrs. Botkin in
numerous shopping tours as well as a
social intimate in the hotel.
To denounce this allegation as mali
ciously false Mrs. Simpson called upon
Chief" Lees yesterday morning and de
manded that he der.v on her behalf that
on any occasion had she been the com
panion of Mrs. Botkin. either in or out of
the hotel, and this Chief Lees did yes
terday afternoon in the presence of an
assemblage of the local newspaper repre
sentatives.
To doubly bind these combined denials
the members of the prosecution practical
ly admit that as evidence the bit of seal
round which this gaudy tale Is woven Is
scarcely admissible as evidence.
A NOTED TEACHER'S DEMISE.

ERNE-LAVIGNE
MILL PREVENTED
Erie County's Sheriff in
Evidence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUFFALO. Sept. 12.â The twenty
round bout for the lightweight cham
pionship of the world between Frank
Erne and Kid Lavigne that was to have
been the opening contest at the Haw
thorne Athlotic Club at Cheektowaga
to-night was stopped by Sheriff Kilgal
lon before the men came together In
the arena. A crowd of about 4000 peo
ple had gathered in the big inclosure
early In the evening.
The Sheriff and a score of deputies
were in the ring when Lon Breckwith
of Cleveland and Jack O'Donnell were
ordered on for the preliminary bout.
The Sheriff declared that he would not
permit any contest to take place.
John Wisher, attorney fcrr the town
of Cheektowaga, demanded that the
club be given the use of its property
and trie boxers were ordered to shake
hands. Before a blow could be struck
the deputies seized the boxers and
forced them to their corners and re
leased them.
Once more the boxers were told to go
on. O'Donnell rushed at Breckwith,
but the deputies again grappled with
them and for a few minutes the rin^c
was filled with struggling deputies and
fighters. Breckwith and O'Donnell were
again compelled to take their seats.
The spectators were greatly excited and
roundly denounced the action of the
Sheriff, but no open act of violence was
committed.
A long and wordy wrangle between
the Sheriff and Attorney Wisher took
place. The boxers left the ring.
Lavigne and Erne were Introduced.
The men were in their corners, but the
Sheriff could not be prevailed upon to
!Â»-t them get together. Finally it was
announced that the bout was off. The
club of this city declared it would
bring suit for damages. The crowd
then left the buillding. The Sheriff
did not arrest either of the principals
in the preliminary, notwithstanding
that the managers ordered them to re
sume fighting, evidently for that pur
pose.
The Corbett-McCoy contest, scheduled
for October 15, will depend upon the
result of the action brought against
the Sheriff. Kid McCoy was present
and was very much disappointed at
the result.
CHAIRMAN DAY'S
OPTIMISTIC VIEW
Thinks the Deliberations of the Peace
Commission Should Not Be
Prolonged.
NEW YORK. SÂ«>pt 12â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs.
"Nothing has occurred since the signing
of the protocol to embarrass the work
of the Peace Commission, or endanger
the success of peace negotiations. I do
not anticipate that the deliberations of
the Peace Commissioners will be pro
longed. It ought not take longer than
six weeks or two months to conclude a.
treaty of peace." This is the optimistic
view taken by Secretary Day. chairman
of the American Peace Commission who
returned to Washington to-day.

does since the death of the Hon. Mr. Pilo,
Speaker of the Assembly, on September 2,
from the effects of the recent attempt to
assassinate him, the Governor and five
public officials have been anonymously
warned that a similar fate has been de
creed for them "as a reward for their op
pression."
The worst feature of the Pilo tragedy is
that the Government reward of $1000 for
information regarding the conspirators
fails to bring out their betrayal.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1898.
MYSTERIOUS
CARD FOUND
BY A CITIZEN
The Writer Signed
Herself " Marie."
"GIVE MY LOVE TO MOTHER"
SAID SHE WOULD SEEK DEATH
IH THE BAY.
The Police Think That the Message
Is a Hoax, but Intend to
Make a Thorough
Investigation,
The police have another mystery which
they are vainly endeavoring to clear up.
Yesterday morning a citizen who was
walking along the track of the Sutro
railroad picked up a card on which was
written the following:
Dear Motherâ l have been deceived long
enough by Jack and to-night at S:3O
o'clock I intend to throw myself Into the bay
near the bridge at the Cliff House. My clothes
and valuables will be found on the hill near
the Ocean House. Give them to mother. For
give me. dear mother, and God bless you.
Your loving daughter, MARIE.
P. S.â The finder of this card will kindly de
liver it to William Vorrath, 901 Point lx)bos
avenue. M.
On the reverse side of the card was
; written the following:
Before you find this card I will be on the
} other side of the river. You have fooled me
j long enough and I cannot live without you.
| You know, .Tark, you ran only love one, and be-
I cause I am not that one I am doing this rash
; act. perhaps for the better and perhaps for
the worst.
May God bless you and keep you from evil
' and I hope that some day we shall meet where
; I can have you alone. Yr.ur dear love. M. K.
P. P.â l witnt my body to be given to my
mother and tell her not to worry. Lots of love
an>J kisses. MARIE.
Who "Marie Is the police have been
unable to ascertain. According to the
statement of Mounted Patrolman Hanley,
who reported the matter to headquarters,
he was patrolling his beat on Point Lobos
avenue about 7 o'clock yesterday morn
ing when he was accosted by a citizen,
who handed him the card containing the
! supposed farewell message. Hanley
showed the card to Vorrath. whose name
was mentioned by the supposed suicide,
, but he was unable to throw any light on
the mysterious affair.
The policeman subsequently went to
, police headquarters t.nd turned the card
over to captain lichen. An examination
showed that it was in the handwriting of
a woman.
Last night two detectives visited the
place where the woman was supposed to
take the fatal leap, but after waiting for
some time for her to put in an appear
ance. th*y concluded that the message
was a hoax and returned to the city. In
quiry among the members of the life sav
ing station failed to elicit any information
which would shed any light on the mys
terious card. The police are inclined to
believe the card was dropped from a
Sutro car on Sunday. It is possible, they
think, that the woman might have gone
to the Cliff House and thrown herself
into the water unknown to the members
of the life saving crew. This is hardly
possible, however, as if she intended to
keep her word some of her wearing ap
parel would have been found on the
beach.
Vorrath, whose name is mentioned in
the card, conducts a grocery store on
Point Lobos avenue.
"I was surprised when I read the mes
sage." he remarked last night. "I know
a woman whose first name is Marie, but
she cannot be the supposed suicide, as I
met her several hours after the note was
found. I am inclined to believe that the
whole thing is a hoax, gotten up by some
body who wanted to have a little fun
with me. The fact that the card was
dropped contiguous to my store shows
that the writer expected that it would
fall into my hands and that I would turn
it over to the police. I have not the least
idea who the writer is, but am convinced
that the name 'Marie' is fictitious."
FOR THE PREVENTION
OF FOREST FIRES
NEW PLANS FORMED BY COM
MISSIONER HERMANN.
A Co-operation Between the Govern
ment and the Railroad Com
panies Is Suggested.
Binger Hermann, the Commissioner of
the General Land Office, arrived in this
city yes'erday from Washington. He will
return to his home in Roseburg. Oregon,
for his vacation, after spending a few
weeks in this city. Mr. Hermann's visit
California is partly for pleasure and
partly for business.
He called upon Surveyor General J. M
Gleaves and William H. Mills of the Cen- !
tral Pacific yesterday, with whom he had !
a conference on the forest question in
this State. To-day Mr. Hermann will
meet the two superintendents of forest
reservations, who are expected to arrive
in this city from Los Angeles. In regard
to the principal issues of land affairs the
Commissioner said:
'â¢In California there are 5. 700,000 acres
of forest reservations, which are divided
into two superintendences under the Ju
risdiction of Superintendents Xewhall and
B. F. Allen. I will consult with thf-m in
the government of the reservations which
come under their control. The subject
which will engage most of our time will
be the consideration of forest fires, which
are becoming more and more prevalent,
and which are ruining our great forest
preserves. Forest fires have given the
Land Offices more concern than any and
ail other depredations.
"T^e people of California have taken
kindly to the restrictions placed upon
them in the management of the forest
districts. The work of the Government
in regard to the forest reserves is of great
benefit to the farming ciasses. as well as
of inestimable value toward the preser
vation of the miles of forests in the
State."
The conference with William H. Mills
may result in the adoption of new meas
ures of importance by the Land Office. It
is the purpose of Commissioner Hermann
to Induce the railroad companies to co
operate with him in the formulation and
execution of a plan to protect the forests
from the ravages of fires. The details of
the plan are not yet formed, but should it
prove feasible and be carried out, a new
and more thoroughly organized force tor
the prevention of forest fires will be in
stituted, in which there will be a co-op
eration of the Government on one side and
the railroad on the other. The interests
of the railroad in the prevention of forest
tires are as great as those of the Govern
ment, as the lands through which the
roads run are lined in many places with
vast stretches of forest.
Mr. Hermann pays tribute to the work
of Tirey L. Ford when in Washington as
a representative of the Miners' Associa
tion. He said that the good work accom
plished in legislation by Congress was due
In many instances to the suggestions of
Ford, who labored unremittingly for' the
settlement of the many difficulties which
arose between the mining men and the
agriculturists of the State.
Mr. Hermann will address the members
of the Union League Club on Thursday
night.
SLASHED WITH A BAZOB
Corporal Hollingsworth, Washington
Volunteers, Injured in a Bow.
There was a lively "scrap" in Pete
Dorcey's saloon on Mason street last
night which terminated in Corporal Hol
llngsworth. of Company A, Washington
Volunteers, being slashed with a razor
across the face. Holllngsworth and two
of his comrades went to the saloon, as
they heard that one of their fellow sol
diers was being 111-treated. As they en
tered the place a number of Tennessee*
soldiers jumped them and a lively fight
ensued. Hollingsworth emerged with a
deep cut across his nose, one under the
right ear and his uniform literally cut in
shreds.
During the excitement his assailant es
caped and up to midnight had not been
arrested. Hollingsworth was taken to
the Receiving Hospital.
SOLDIERS SCORED.
Colored Citizens Denounce the Mem
bers of the Tennessee Regiment.
More than seven hundred colored citi
zens assembled last night in the Third
Baptist Church for the purpose of adopt
ing resolutions anent the recent assault
by members of the Tennessee and other
regiments on Danny Thomas, the crab
vendor. Joseph E. Francis introduced A.
Dumas Jones as chairman of the meeting,
and Frank W. Jackson was elected by
acclamation to act as secretary. A com
mittee of nine was appointed to frame
resolutions, and while they were engaged
in this work short speeches were made by
I Rev. Tighiman Brown, George Dennis Jr.,
and several others.
The resolutions as reported by the com
mittee were adopted without amendment.
They set forth at length a number of in
cidents wherein colored men are alleged
to have been assaulted and grossly insulted
by members of the Tennessee Regiment
now encamped at the Prsidio. They fur
ther recite. In detail, the Thomas affair
and its culmination in a court-martial,
which Is characterized as "a farce from
beginning to end. a travesty on justice
and a disgrace to military jurisprudence.
A lieutenant who is said to have refused
to identify any of the mob that pursued
Thonrns to his home, although he ad
mined that he was present during the
whole affair, is designated as a "perjurer,
most cowardly and Infamous;" and the
officers of the Tennessee command, "with
but few exceptions," are denounced in
unmeasured terms as "accessories to the
crimes and indignities committed by the
Tennesseeans upon the colored residents
of this city."
Colonel William C. Smith, who com
mands the Tennessee volunteers, is re
ferred to in dignified terms as "that mis
erable Confederate soldier": but the open
ing paragraph of the resolution denounced
the soldiers who participated in the riot
ous proceedings as "unworthy to wear the
uniform of the T'nited States army, as
their actions savor of those of cowards,
murderers and assassins."
It was also resolved to lay the facts
before the local Grand Jury, and a com
mittee was selected to give this matter
its attention. The dally papers of this city
were thanked for the stand they have
taken, and copies of the resolutions were
ordered to be forwan.ed to President Mc-
Klnley and Secretary nf War Alger.

THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE
FOX CASE
Van Fleet's Opinion Correctly
Construed by Eminent
Legal Minds.
The Ingenious and Malicious Campaign
Falsehood Has Been Halted on Its
Travels.
The poor old Examiner is at Its tricks
again. It continues to act upon the
old precept that a lie well stuck to is
as good as the truth. Once more it is
endeavoring to set afloat its intentional
misconstruction of the opinion of the
Supreme Court in the case of Loren Fox
against the Oakland Consolidated Rail
way Company.
The Examiner on September 10, 1897,
published criticisms of Justice Van
Fleet's opinion from Bishop Newman,
Rev. E. R. Dille, A. Furuseth, H. C.
Hinken, E. S. Barney. W. M. Page and
Mayor Phelan. The expressions of
these persons were based on the repre
sentations of the Examiner, and it is
6afe to say that not one of these men
had read the decision. Bishop New
man in his signed statement admits
that he had not read it. However, it
was made to appear to these men by
the Examiner that Justice Van Fleet
had discriminated against the poor in
that he had virtually declared that the
life of a poor man's son was not worth
as much to his father as the life of a
rich man's son. The criticisms, thus
obtained, were naturally of the same
tenor as the Examiner's representation
of the matter to these men, some of
whom were thus led into putting a con
struction on Justice Van Fleet's opin
ion almost directly opposite to the idea
actually conveyed therein. Had these
misguided men read the opinion they
would never have been led into com
mitting such a gross injustice upon a
fair minded Judge.
The Examiner, taking an undue ad
vantage of these parties, made a sen
sational spread of the matter under the
scare head, "Are Men Created Free
and Equal? How the Supreme Court in
the Loren Fox Case is Being Criticized
by the General Public." It will be seen
from the above names that the Exami
ner has a very limited idea of "the gen
eral public." However, the Examiner
almost immediately discovered that it
had got its foot in it, as usual. Itr,
attempt to misconstrue Justice Van
Fleet was entirely too weak to be ac
cepted by the general public outside of
that portion of it that had unwittingly
assisted the falsifier in its underhanded
yet audacious assault. The very >ext
morning it published an article that
refuted the publication of the previous
day. It would be supposed that the
Examiner would have had decency
enough after this to not again endeavor
to deceive people by a repetition of the
falsehood. But no, it must, after the
lapse of a year, revive the lie. On
August 28 It. in an editorial, says: "But
Justice Van Fleet decides that the
value of a child's life varies in direct
ratio to the wealth of his father. It
is one law for the rich and another for
the poor."
This lie has resumed its travels, and
is making its appearance in some of
the State papers, whose editors are
prcbably as ignorant of the merits of
Judge Van Fleet's opinion as those gen
tlemen who originally furnished the
Examiner with their criticisms.
The Woodland Daily Democrat, for
instance, says: "Judge Van Fleet's de
cision as to the relative value of the
children of poor people and those of
rich people will need a good deal of ex
planation during the present cam
paign."
This is a sample of the paragraphs
that are being published. A lie â and
especially a political He â travels fast,
and it is a hard race for truth to over
take it.
The Call to-day presents interviews
on this subject from some of the best
and clearest legal minds in the State.
Among them is Garret McEnerney, the
attorney for the Examiner; W. W.
Fqote, a life-long Democrat; E. S. PiUs
bury, ex-Justice Van R. Paterson, Chief
Justice Beatty, Justice Henshaw and
Justice Baroutte. These men know
what they are talking about and their
views are presented in a clear and in
telligible manner, so that the most or
dinary person ought to be able to gain
a proper understanding of Justice Van
Fleet's opinion.
Chief Justice W. H. Beatty- There is
absolutely nothing in the opinion in the
â way of discrimination between rich and
poor.
There is nothing in the opinion relat

*r " lie to Curs Lruj Kind Â£ccema,' r maW
| ing to the value of a life, whether of rich
:or poor. The action was for damages for
, loss of services, not for loss of life, and
; the whole question in the case was
; whether the evidence was sufficient to
show that the child's services during his
; minority would have been worth $6000,
and the whole decision was that the evi
dence did not prove that fact. In dis
cussing this question it was saidâ as has
been said in othf-r cases in other Statesâ
i that there is a presumption that the child,
i if he had not been killed, would have fol
lowed during his minority the occupation
of his father. It is upon this expression
that all adverse criticism has been ex
pended, and it is from this that the con
clusion has been drawn that the court
was discriminating in favor of the rich
against the poor. But in truth the discrim
ination, if any had been intended, would
have been the other way; for it is a fact
; universally known that the children of
the rich and prosperous rarely earn
anything for their parents.
All the fault found with this decision
! proceeds from the assumption that in an
| action of this kind the parent can re
i cover the value of his child's life. But
! this is a wholly mistaken view. There is
!no pecuniary measure of the value of
j human life, and neither courts nor juries
! can estimate it in money. The Legisla
j ture might fix such a valuation by law,
but in this State the Legislature has
never done so, and the courts in the
meantime can give a bereaved parent
no redress for the loss of his child ex
cept the probable value of his services,
which, being purely conjectural, can only
be estimated upon the presumption that
he will follow some useful occupation,
and that during his minority that will be
the occupation of his father.
Garret W. McEnerncyâ The Supreme
Court did not decide In the case of Lorin
Fox vs. The Oakland Consolidated Rail
way Company (Us Cal. 55) that the value
of the life of a rich man's son is greater
than that of a poor man's son, nor did the
court decide any proposition from which
that conclusion ensues, either directly or
remotely. In fact, Judge Van Fleet, who
wrote the opinion, lays down the very op
posite at the foot of page 64 of the report.
He there says, following the language of
Judge Dillon:
â¢There is not in this country one rule of law for
t\l rich and a different rule for t/ie poor."
It will therefore be seen that the deci
sion doe 6 not make one rule for the rich
and a different rule for the poor.
As I have already said, the decision does
not establish any proposition from which
that conclusion ensues, either directly or
n-motely. A few facts will make this very
plain.
The plaintiff, Lorin Fox, is a plumber
and tinner by trade. He resided with nis
wife and their children, consisting of a
daughter 13 years of age and a boy 4Vs
years, on Tenth street, near Franklin, in
Oakland. The boy strayed over to Frank
lin street, violating his mother's instruc
tions in so doing, went upon the track of
the Oakland Consolidated Railway Com
pany, was run down by one of its cars
and killed. The father sued for damages.
The jury gave $6000. The Supreme court
set this verdict aside on the ground that
the damages were greater than the law
allowed to be given in such a case.
It is a rule of law, made before Judge
Van Fleet was born, and which he is
bound to apply to the cases which come
before him for decision, and which rule
he has no more right to set aside than I
have, that a parent can only recover for
the loss of an infant child through negli
gence "the probable value of the services
of the deceased until he had attained his
majority, taking into consideration the
cost oÂ£ his support and maintenance dur
ing the early and helpless part of his
life."
Judge Van Fleet pointed out that, ac
cording to all of the probabilities of the
case, the child would nut have earned for
his father, between the time of his death
and his arrival at majority had he lived,
after deducting all expenses of support
and maintenance, the sum of $6000.
That being so, the verdict had to be set
aside. The parent can only recover what
the earnings of the child would have
amounted to during minority. When a
child arrives at his majority his earn
ings no longer belong to his parents.
The decision up to this point is, there
fore, not only free from just criticism, but
t has heretofore been free from any criti
j dam at all. But it is said that in a partic
ular portion of the decision a rule is an
nounced which makes the value of the
life of a rich man's son greater than that
of a poor man. Thfr particular language
which is supposed to involve this result
s the following:
"And while in no sense conclusive, we
have the right, and it is most reasonable
in judging of the probable character of
iccupation the deceased would have pur
<ucd, to regard, with the other circum
uances surrounding him, the calling of
his fatherâ since experience teaches that
children do very frequently pursue the
-iime general class of- business as that of
; their parents. (AValters vs. Chicago etc.
I K. R. Co., 41 lowa, 71. 73.)"
This language simply moans that it had
'â ten decide (1 by the Supreme Court of
lowa that although great numbers of
i hildren do not follow the occupations of
their fathr-rs, nevertheless, in dealing
with the unknown future of a child killed
in infancy, it Is proper to consider the oc
cupation of his father, because experience
teaches that children do frequently follow
the same general class of business as that
followed ny their parents. Judge Van
I Fleet adopted the rule as a reasonable
This language and rule have been sup
posed to involve the result that more
damages would be awarded to a rich man
on the death of his son through negli
gence than would be awarded to a poor
man upon the death of his child. The
very contrary is the result, although the
rule is universal, applying to all classes
aliyre.
It is a matter of universal knowledge
that the children of poor men become
bread earners earlier than the children of
rich men. If a man Is poor and has a
large family, It Is Importantâ lndeed, ab
solutely necessaryâ that his children
should become self-suportlng bread win
ners and bread earners earlier In life than
the children of his more fortunate nelgh
i bore. So that the humbler a man's call
! ing may be th\ value of his child's life to
i him. under this rule of law. Is all the
greater.
Take a laborer with a large family and
apply the rule to his cnse, and then ap
ply It to that of a lawyer or a physician
In the case of a laborer, his poorly paid
labor must support a large family until
his children arrive at an age when they
can contribute something to the support
of the household. As soon as that time
arrives his children become bread-win
ners, and the earlier they become bread
winners the more value In a pecuniary
sense and under this rule of law are
those children to him.
On the other hand, if the sons of a
lawyer or a physician follow the callings
of their fathers, they cannot become and
they are not, bread-winners until after
they attain their majority. A lawyer can-
S, ot iÂ£ admitted to practice until he is
21. The trninlng necessary to fit a man
! for the CRlllng of a physician takes him
i past his majority. So that, in the two
last named cases, the rule that they
would probably follow the callings of
their fathers would make their pecuniary
value, under this rule of law, much less
than the pecuniary value of the sons of
a laborer whose lot in life makes it nec
essary for him to find remunerative em
ployment for his children long before they
attain the age of majority.
Of course, this rule of" law lays out of
view the sentimental side of life For
considerations of public policy, which had
their origin generations ago, it was de
cided that parents cannot recover for tfc*
mental anguish with which they are over
whelmed by the cruel deaths of their chil
dren, but that they can only recover the
pecuniary loss sustained by them.
The whole doctrine of compensation is
founded upon the rule that during the
J minority of a child his narenta ore en
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1893.
titled to his earnings. So that all that
can be recovered in Such a case is what
the child would probably have earned,
less what it would have cost to maintain
him before he earned anything and while
he was earning his wages. Whatever that
sum amounts to by calculation, that the
parent is entitled to recover and no more.
I therefore say that Judge Van Fleet
decided that there was not one rule for
the rich and another rule for the poor.
The rule which he laid down had been
laid down generations ago, and it was just
that which I have stated.
Under the rule it is very clear that those
who go earlier to bread-winning employ
ment are of the greater pecuniary value
to their parents. And it is not true that
the case decided, or that it involves the
result, that a rich man's son is more
valuable than a poor man's.
Justice F. VV. Henshawâ The idea that
this opinion discriminates against the chil
dren of poor is based upon a total mis
understanding and does Justice Van Fleet
a grave injustice.
The measure of damages In such cases
is the estimated net value of the services
of the child to the parent during his mi
nority. Such has always been the rule of
recovery, such it was declared In the opin
ion to be, and such it will continue to be
until changed by the Legislature. If it is
deemed a harsh rule it is to be remem
bered that it was framed long before Jus
tice Van Fleet was born and that he is
not responsible for it.
There is no way of determining in any
case exactly what a child would have
earned. Therefore, the best that can be
done is to estimate what probably he
would have earned. In estimating this
the jury takes into consideration the con
dition and situation of the parents and
the probable occupation of the child dur
ing minority. For it must be supposed
that the child will follow some occupation
or it could earn nothing. Is a child more
likely during his minority to follow his
father's occupation, or some other? The
opinion says he is more likely to follow
that of his father, and while the whole
matter is problematical that view accords
with the common observation of mankind.
As a poor man's son may likely earn
something for the support of his parents
during minority and as a rich man's son
will probably earn nothing during the
same period, it follows that so far from
the opinion declaring either directly or
by inference that a rich man's son is
worth more than is a poor man's, the ex
act converse is the truth. Under the prin
ciples announced in the opinion a poor
man would ordinarily recover more in
such an action than would a rich man.
W. W. pooteâ i r ou asked my opinion as
to the onistruction to be placed upon the
opinion of Judge Van Fleet In the case of
Fox against the Oakland Consolidated
Street Hallway Company. I have just
made a careful examination of the case,
and cheerfully comply with your request; j
more readily for the reason that the gen- j
tlemen occupying judicial positions are
unabie to go into the newspapers to de
fend themselves, and are therefore fre
quently the subjects of abuse and calum
ny which they are utterly unable to meet
by any efforts of their own.
The case in question was an action for
damages, brought by the father for the
loss of the services of his minor son. The
jury returned a verdict of $6000. A motion
for a new trial was refused, an appeal
taken to the Supreme Court, and the
Judgment was reversed solely on the
ground that the damages awarded, $600u,
were excessive.
Any fair-minded man who examines
Judge Van Fleet's opinion, concurred in
by Justices Harrison and Beatty, will see
at a glance that there is not in the opin
ion any language which, even by distor
tion, could be construed Into the charge
made against Judge Van Fleet having
discriminated, In his opinion, in favor of
the- rich and against the poor. Judges
must follow well-known precedents or
else the whole Judicial system is a failure.
There is an unbroken current of author
ity in this State and in every other where
the common law prevails, that the only
element of damage, in cases of this kind,
is the loss to the father of the services of
the child. The reasoning in the Fox case
proceeds upon these lines entirely, and is
not subject to the adverse criticisms
which has been so frequently made
against it. The question of contributory
negligence, and, in fact, every' other ques
tion which arose in the case, except the
one as to excessive damages, was decided
in favor of the plaintiff.
No fair-minded Judge, mindful of his
oath, could have rendered any other opin
ion than the one handed down in the Fox
case, as it was presented to the Supreme
Court. The language of the opinion
clearly shows that there was no intention
to discriminate against one class as
against another. "After a careful review
of the authorities we are clearly of the
opinion that the question of the parent's
negligence in any given case cannot be
made to turn upon the state of his
finances."
Whenever the time shall arrive that
poverty or wealth are to be weighed in
the balance by Judges of our highest
courts, then the period of their usefulness
is over and a reign of anarchy will com-
mence.
I was not an attorney In the Fox case
and have no interest In It. For the last
twenty-five years I have had a large
number of cases against the railroad com
pany, never one for It, and I can conscien
tiously say, in the interests of decency
and justice, that the opinion in the Fox
case meets with my entire approval. I
comply with your request simply as a
matter of fairness and justice, and give
you my views upon this case without any
reservation whatever. If we are to elect
Democratic Judges, let us do so without
resorting to means which are questionable
and the falsification of records.
Fx-Supreme Justice Van R. Pnterson
âIf I understand the matter cor
rectly those who criticize the opin
ion of Mr. Justice Van Fleet in the
case of Fox vs. the Oakland Con
solidated Railway Company, reported In
118 California, 55 et seq., claim that he
there attempted to draw some line of
caste â to define a class or grade of so
ciety separated from others by difference
of wealth, profession or employment; or
at least, that his opinion lays down a rule
of decisions in actionÃ by a parent for
damages resulting from the death of a
minor child through the negligence of a
corporation which is less favorable to
the case of a poor man plaintiff than to
the case of a rich man plaintiff.
If this be the contention I have no hes
itancy in saying that the construction is
directly o^nosed to what was in fact de
cided. An opinion must always be con
strued in the light of the facts of tho
case, the contentions of the parties, and
the points actually decided. Let us take
a look at this case and see -what the
court said and decided there.
It was an action by a father to re
cover damages for the death, through the
negligence of a street railway company,
of his little boy, four years and a half
old. He had a verdict for $6000, and the
corporation appealed. Counsel for appel
lant tried to convince the Supreme Court
that the verdict should be set aside on
account of the insufficiency of the evi
dence. The court refused to do so, re
gardless of any apparent preponderance
of the evidence in favor of the corpora
tion, because there appeared to be a sub
stantial conflict In the evidence. That is
the first point decided. It was also claim
ed that ihe parents were guilty of con
tributory negligence in allowing the child
to wander from the house and upon the
track of defendant. The court held that
this question was one solely for the jury,
refused to interfere, and furthermore held
in strong language that even if the par
ents were guilty of negligence they were
not precluded from recovering, because
the jury was justified In believing that
the defendant was guilty of gross negli
gence. In deciding the question as to
whether evidence was admissible to show
that the plaintiff did not employ any ser
vants, the court approved the language
of Judge Dillon: "There Is not in this
country one rule of law for the rich and
a different rule for the poor. It extends
its protecting shield over all alike."
In the first three points decided, there
fore, there is nothing to show any lean
ing toward the rich as against the poor.
That is clear.
But the portion of the opinion which
has caused criticism Is that which seems
to hold that evidence of the father's oc
cupation or profession is admissible as
some evidence to show what the calling
of the boy would hayÂ« been if he had not
been killed. The court decided simply
that such was a matter for consideration
by the jury and the court, but did not de
cide (and here is where the misappre
hension and unjust criticism has arisen)
that this consideration was controlling
or that it was anything more than a mere
circumstance in the case, which under the
rules of evidence was a proper subject
of consideration.
In such cases no absolute rules of ad
measurement of damages can, in the na
ture of things, be fixed. The jury must
decide upon all the inferences and prob
abilities which enter into the question
"What would the boy's life be; what
would he probably earn for his father
during his minority?"
Instead of being a discrimination
against the poor parent, it Is a rule which
â will operate in his favor. A rich man's
son is not a financial help to him under
the age of majority ordinarily. A poor
man's son is almost invariably a help.
In cases of this chaisacter, the measure
of damages is practically confined to the
pecuniary value of the child's services to
his parent during his minority, taking
into consideration, the cost ot bis Busoort
and maintenance during that period. Al
though the jury is entitled to take into
consideration the fact that the parents
have been deprived of the comfort and
protection of the boy during his minority,
their consideration of these elements is
practically conlined to the pecuniary value
of his services. Nothing can be allowed
as a penalty for causing his death, nor
for sorrow or grief of the parents.
I myself take no stock in a rule which
discards the chief elements of a parent s
loss through the wrongful act of another
but it is a rule which has been followed
for ages and one which the courts cannot
depart from until authorized to do so by
legislation. â¢
The statement in the opinion which is
criticized is but the enunciation of the
rule of evidence followed in other juris
dictions, and when properly explained to
the jury by the trial court is of very
little importance. For instance, in Wai
ters vs. Chicago Railroad Company, 41
lowa, 71-73, speaking of such testimony,
the court said: "Of course, such testi
mony is not very controlling in its char
acter. There are a thousand circum
stances which lead children into pursuits
widely different from those of their par
ents. This fact, known to every observ
ant person, should be allowed due weight
by the jury in estimating the proper reli
ance to be placed upon such testimony.'
In the opinion written by Justice Gar
outte and concurred in by Chief Justice
Beatty and Justice Harrison, it is not
held, I am very glad to say, that as mat
ter of law or matter of fact there Is Â«
presumption that a child will follow the
same kind of business as that of his
parents. It is simply hoid that the mat
ter is a circumstance which the defend
ant in an action for damages like this is
entitled to have submitted to the jury
and considered in determining the amount
to be allowed to the plaintiff in case he
be entitled to recover.
t. tj. Pillsburyâ lt seems to me that
any wrong impression which exists about
this Fox decision is due entirely to a mis
apprehension concerning the facts of the
case. It was not a suit by the parent to
recover the value of the life of his child
but the value of his services during mi
nority. The law did not permit the lather
to recover the value of his son's life, uut
only to sue for the value of his services,
and it is unfair to criticize the Judge who
wrote the opinion because he declared
what the law was in this respect. As
early as ISBI, in a suit by Roller against
the Sutter-street Railroad Company, on
account of the killing of his infant child,
and in which I was attorney for the plain
tiff. Judge Sullivan charged the jury that
the father could only recover such a sum
as would compensate him for the loss of
the child's services during minority, and
that rule has been recognized ever since.
The record shows In this Fox case that
instead of ignoring the poverty of the
parent or ieaning against him on that ac
count, the Supreme Court expressly took
notice or" the parent's poverty as a cir
cumstance in his favor* The railroad com
pany claimed that it was such negligence
on the part of the parents to allow their
child to be near a railroad track unat
tended as to prevent any recovery what
ever. In explanation of this circumstance,
the plaintiff was allowed to show on tne
trial that the parents were too poor to
keep a servant to watch the child; t..at
the father worked away from home and
the mother had to do her own house
work; that she was engaged at washing
when the child strayed away to the track
and that they looked after the child as
closely as they could under these condi
tions. The trial court permitted this tes
timony to go in, and left it to the jury to
decide whether under these circumstances
the parents had been guilty of negligence
toward the child, and the Supreme Court
affirmed that ruling. This shows con
clusively that the poverty of the parents
cut an important figure in favor of the
father on the trial, and with the approval
of the Supreme Court. The case was re
versed, however, because the Jury found
that the value of the services of the child
during minority would have been $6000, an
amount which the Supreme Court held
to be excessive. We all know that as a
rule a boy, after reaching the age of 4^
years, does not earn as much as $6000 for
his parents while under age, after de
ducting all the expenses of his support
and education during that period. The
courts are bound to take notice of facts
which are matters of general knowledge.
It must be remembered that Chief Justice
Beatty concurred in this opinion. If there
ever was a Judge who is believed to be
fair and impartial. Judge Beatty is that
man. No one ever accused him of making
any distinction between the rich and the
poor.
M. C. Chapmnn, one of the attorneys
for the plaintiff in the case of Fox vs.
The Oakland Consolidated Street Railway
Company, speaking with a full knowledge
of all the facts, says the Supreme Court
has not laid down a rule that the law
thinks more of a rich man's Bon than it
does of a poor man's son.
Concerning the declaration of law in the
Fox case, Mr. Chapman says: "Neither is
the law declared in the Fox case new or
startling, as it assuredly would have been
had it contained any such declaration as
that which the enemies of Justice Van
Fleet assert. I say deliberately that in
that opinion, taken as a whole or by
piecemeal, there is no paragraph, no sen
tence, no word bearing any such construc
tion as that which is sought to be given
to it, and that, to the contrary, the direct,
immediate and only construction is that
for the death of his child the poor man
may recover more under the law than
could the rich parent recover for the
death of his child."
Mr. Chapman remarks that the whole
State Is interested in having wise and up
right Judges on the bench of our highest
court, and it becomes the duty of any
ope â lawyer or laymanâ to present the
facts when such a question as this is
agitated by the people and to endeavor
to correct an impression so prejudicial
in its effects.
"The legal effect," says Mr. Chapman,
"of the decision of the Supreme Court in
this case was to countenance on behalf
of a poor man for the death of his son a
greater recovery than could be awarded to
a rich man for the same loss. The recov
ery, it is always to be borne In mind, is
based upon the estimated value of tae
services of the rhild to the parent, having
In mind the condition in life of the child
and of his parents. The poor man shows
in court the probable earnings of his child
during minority and is awarded them ac
cordingly. In the same kind of action tne
rich man can only show that his son has
been and in the nature of tilings probably
will be a constant source of outlay and
expense to him during minority, and as a
consequence his recovery in the law must
be limited to a nominal sum."
Frederick E. Whitney, who was asso
ciated with M. C. Chapman as the plain
tiff's counsel in the case, denies that the
court held that there was one law for the
rich and another for the poor. Mr. Whit
ney, in referring to the case, said:
With the exposition of the law both
plaintiff and defendant recognized the
principles of the law, and none other were
asserted by the Supreme Court in the Fox
case. It is to be remembered that in no
case does the law fix a price upon human
life, nor does it pretend to measure the
grief or suffering of the parent for the
loss of his child. In every case, be the
child the son of a rich man or the son
of a poor man, the parent's recovery is
limited in the law to the estimated value
of the services during minority, over and
above the cost of his maintenance during
the same period. Such was the law uni
versally accepted long before the date of
the Fox case, and such is the law declared
in that decision. It Is a well known fact
that during the period of minority the
rich man's son does not earn; he spends.
The sons of poor men usually earn some
thing for their parents before reaching
a majority. The sons of rich men cost
more than they earn as a rule.
"I'pon all these mattersâ these estab
lished principles of lawâ there was no
conflict. Upon one proposition alone we
differed. It was urged by the defendant
upon appeal that $6000 was an excessive
amount, as being beyond the net value
to the parents of the services of a child
of four and a half years of age, when
deduction is made for the cost of his
maintenance. We hoped to convince the
Supreme Court that in our case a verdict
of $0000 was not excessive. We failed to
do so and accepted the result as by right
minded people It could only be accepted,
as the fair, unprejudiced and unbiased
opinion of the learned gentlemen who
compose our court of last resort, and to
whose just judgment such questions as
this are submitted."
â¢lusti.e C. H Garoutteâ There is noth
ing in Justice Van Fleet's opinion
that can be construed as holding that the
life of a poor man's son is of less value
than that of a rich man's son. Under this
decision the poor man, as a rule, would
recover more as the probable value of his
son's services than the rich man.

of Sacramento took his life a day or two
ago in a secluded part of Golden Gate

When Wellborer J. K. Meyer, attracted
to the spot yesterday morning by the

dead body in some underbrush near the

of a grain each. These the suicide had
swallowed at some period of time varying
from twenty-four to forty-eight hours
previously.
The body was brought to the Morgue,
and the clothing was searched for evi

are sometimes exposed when put out by
their parents to work at a tender age.
Florence writes under date of August 7
that she is back in "the store" again at
a salary of $10 per month. She adds that

quaintances here, since they had long: an
ticipated such would be his fate. Seven
or eight years ago Wieger was a member
of the large dry goods firm of Wasserman
& Co., and as such held a high place both
in the commercial and sociai community.
He was very proud and somewhat auto
cratic in his manner, but this quality did
not interfere with his success as one of
the several members of the firm. "When,
however.. Wieger started in for himself as
a rival of the o!d firm, opening his place
within 100 feet of the other, he found that
he did not possess those elements of per
sonal popularity which would draw trade
to him. Then followed bis imprisonment
and gradually declining fortune. Public
sympathy went out for Wieger here prior
to and after his liberation from prison,
but it was noticed that while he assumed
a pride it was not of a character which
would prompt him to support his wife
and five children as his means allowed,
and there was a gradual change of senti
ment regarding him. However, Wieger
â was never regarded, even after his con
viction, as a criminal, and his thorough
knowledge of the dry goods business was
conceded. He had never threatened sui
cide even to his most intimate friends
here, but when they learned that he had
been out of employment a long "time they
looked for that end.
The Man Who Was Cursed.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 12.â Wiener was
married to a relative by marriage of
Philip Scheld, one of the directors of the
Sacramento banks, proprietor of one of
the local breweries, and a man of con
siderable wealth. Scheld. when informed
as to the nature of Weiger's note, plac
ing his dying curse upon him, was not
visibly disturbed. Scheld says that when.
Wieger first got into financial difficulties
the dry-goods man went to him for mon
ey, but Scheld declined to undertake to
make good his losses. Since then Wieger
harbored ill will for Scheld, and time
and again referred to him as the man re
sponsible for his failure, for he main
tained that had Scheld given him the
money he wanted he would never have
got into business difficulties. However,
Scheld says he did not fed justified in
complying with Wieger*s demand upon
the showing Wieger made to him.
