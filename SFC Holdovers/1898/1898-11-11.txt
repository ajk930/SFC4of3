WILMINGTON, N. C, Nov. 10.â
After a day of bloodshed and
turbulence Wilmington has
subsided to-night into com
parative peacefulness. Eight
negroes were killed and three white
men wounded during the day, one of
them, William Mayo, seriously.
To-night the city is in the hands of
a new municipal government and law
and order is being established. This
afternoon the Board of Aldermen re
signed one by one. As each Alderman
vacated the remaining elected a suc
cessor named by the citizens' commit
tee until the entire board was changed
legally. They resigned in response to
public sentiment. The new board is
composed of conservative Democratic
citizens.
The Mayor and Chief of Police then
resigned and the new board elected
their successors according to law. Ex-
Representative Waddell was elected
Mayor and E. G. Parmalee Chief of
Police.
The first act of the new government
â¢was to swear in 250 special policemen,
chosen from the ranks of reputable
white citizens. They are vested with
all the authority of the law, and will
take charge of the city. The citizens'
committee will remain on guard
throughout the town to prevent at
tempts at incendiarism. The new gov
ernment will devote its attention to re
straining recklessness among the
whites, as well as keeping down law
lessness among the negroes. Further
trouble of a general or serious nature
is not expected.
Soon after the meeting Mr. George
Rountree received a telegram from
Governor Russell saying that he would
use all his efforts to influence the
Mayor and City Council to resign if
that wouJd restore peace.
Mr. Rountree sent the following re
ply: "Mayor and Aldermen resigned. '
Two hundred and fifty special police
men sworn in. Law will be maintained
and peace restored."
Mr. Rountree is a prominent attor
ney here and a member of the Demo-,
cratic Congressional Committee.
The trouble in Wilmington to-day
commenced at 8:30 this morning: when
an armed body of citizens, numbering
about 400, and led by ex-Representative
Waddell, chairman of a committee of
twenty-five appointed for the purpose,
proceeded to the publishing house of a
negro newspaper, the Record, to wreck
it. The editor of this paper had pub
lished an article defamatory of white
women and a mass-meeting of citizens
yesterday demanded his expulsion from
the city within twenty-four hours and
. the removal of his press. Fifteen lead
ing negroes were called in by the com
mittee of twenty-five last night and di
rected to notify the chairman by 7:30
this morning whether they would agree
to the removal of the press. They were
told that if no answer was returned the
press would be demolished.
No answer was received by the chair
man this morning and after waiting an
hour the citizens proceeded in a* body
and demolished the fixtures of the
printing office. The building was also
firwd and gutted. The loaders say that
this action was the work of irresponsi
ble persons and as soon as the fire was
discovered the fire department was
called to extinguinh it.
The burning of the printing office
created a great commotion among the

HAVANA, Nov. 10.â There was a narrow escape of a serious clash
between the Spanish and insurgent forces at Navajos, near Matan
zas, to-day. The Spaniards, because of illness of the men, had tem
porarily abandoned two blockhouses near railroad track, which
were taken possession of by insurgents under Dontln. Hearing of this
General Molinas sent a captain with seventy men to recapture the
houses. The Cubans prepared to resist and the good judgment of
the Spanish officers alone prevented bloodshed.
Gener.il Molinas ordered the captain to remain In camp until re
inforcemeÂ»ts reached him. -To-day Dontin telegraphed Betancourt, In
charge of the Matanzas division of the insurgents, for instructions.
The latter replied that he must hold his ground. Meantime Menocal,
chief of the fifth corpa of the insurgents, instructed Betancourt to
push forward cavalry reinforcements to Dontin.
"Word was sent to General "Wade last night and he ordered two
of his aids to go to Navajos tc bring about an understanding. Gen
eral Wade advises Dontin to yield to the Spanish demands. Similar
instructions have been sent to the civil governor of Matanzas from
the Spanish authorities.
The San Francisco Call
negroes of the town. The rumor spread
that the whites were going to burn and
murder in the negro quarter. This
rumor reached the negro employes of
a cotton compress, numbering 800 or
400, who quit work and hung about the
streets in manifest terror. Other par
ties congregated in the neero section,
and it was in one of these that the first
tragedy was enacted. The men were
standing on a corner and were ordered
to disperse. They declined, and, it is
claimed, fired into the whites.
A fusillade was immediately opened
upon them by the whites and three
negroes were killed. Two whites were
wounded slightly. One heÂ«rro ran down
the street, and, passing a residence,
fired a rifle at William Mayo, white,
standing on the veranda, shooting him
through the left lung. This negro was
recognized, pursued and captured while
hiding under a bed. It is said he con
fessed to the shooting. He was riddled
with shot by his captors and killed.
In the meantime the town was In a
state of great excitement. The whites
rushed to the afreet from every direc
tion, the local militia company was or
dered out and a battalion of United
States naval reserves proceeded to the
vicinit-' of the trouble with a rapid
fire gun.
About 1 o'clock some negroes In a
house fired upon a passing party of
white men. The house was surrounded
and four negroes captured and tak
to the jail. One negro broke away ar.
ran, but was shot down and killed b
fore he had proceeded half a block.
During the afternoon there wt-i
other affairs of this kind and eight ne
i groes were killed during various times
I in the disturbed sections. Their names
| at this time are unknown.
As the news of the riot spread
through the neighboring cities they of
fered to send help, but all such offers
were declined, except in the case of
Fayetteville, from which town came
about 150 men. As night fell the town
was completely patrolled and guarded.
Very few negroes were on the streets
and they were not allowed to congre
gate anywhere.
The action of the citizens in organiz
i ing a new municipal government is ex
j pected to bring peace and order, and
mo rioting is expected to-night. It de
j veloped later in the day that the negro
j committee summoned last night had
j agreed to use their good omces to have
the press removed, although the editor
had disappeared and they had no au
thority on the premises. This letter
instead of being delivered to the chair
man of the committee of twenty-five
in person was put in the mail and did
not reach him until three hours after
the expiration of the time limit which
had been fixed for the reception of the
answer.
A crowd was formed to-night to take
from the jail and lynch two negroes,
Thomas Miller and Ira Bryant, who
were arrested to-day, charged with
making threats and were regarded as
dangerous characters. The Mayor, Col
onel Waddall, promptly prohibited the
assembling of the crowd at the jail and
he himself headed a guard of twenty
five men with Winchesters to guard the
j prisoners.
Another negro was killed to-night at
Tenth and Mulberry streets. He was
hailed by a guard, but refused to halt
and was shot by the guard.
Three companies of the State Militia

EIGHT MASKED ROBBERS
LOOT AN EXPRESS TRAIN
FERGUS FALLS, Minn., Nov. 10.â Eight masked men held up the express train of the Great Northern road two
hours to-night while they robbed the passengers and blew open the safe in the express car with dynamite. The
robbery was committed five miles outside of the city, the robbers evidently having boarded the: train at this point.
As soon as well out of the station two b mdits climbed over the tender, covered the engineer and^Jreman with revol
vers and when nearing a lonely spot near Pelican River bridge, compelled them to stop and get out of the cab.
The conductor and flagmen came running up to learn the cause of delay, and the entire crew being rounded up,
were left in charge of two men armed with Winchesters. An attack was then made on the express car door, which
the messenger refused to open and it was blown off with dynamite. The shock of the explosion was so great that
the messenger was rendered unconscious, and could not use weapons, though he had a rifle in his hand and evi
dently had prepared to put up a fight. He was quickly carried out, where others of the crew were under guard. Two
robbers then set to work to blow open the safes, and four others with drawn revolvers went through the passengers in
the coaches, taking weapons as well as valuables from all. After getting all of value in the coaches two robbers
were left on guard, the others returning to help in the express car. The safe was a particularly good one or the
dynamite was not skillfully applied, as .five charges were found necessary to blow it open. When this was finally ac
complished the robbers took watches and money from the engineer and conductor, and escaped to the woods. The ex
press car was so badly damaged by the explosions of dynamite used to open the door and safe that it was some time
before it could be chained up (the front trucks being demolished) to enable the train to proceed to Carlisle, where
an alarm was given to the Sheriff and police of this city. Posses were immediately organized and a search for the
robbers instituted, but at 11 o'clock no arrests had been made. It is not known how much money was in the ex
press safe as all bills and other papers were either carried away or destroyed by the explosion.

SANTA CRUZ DEL SUR. Nov. 10.â
President Maso and the secretaries
representing the so-called Cuban re
public since October, 1897, presented
their resignations to the Cuban Assem
bly to-day and they were accepted. The
Government of the republic is now in
the hands of the Assembly.
At the session to-day Senor Gonzales
Lanuza presented a resolution to elect
an executive committee of five with
power to act during the recess of ths
Assembly. This committee, in con
junction with the permanent officers of
the Assembly, will take charge of af
fairs until the Cuban people elect a new
Government. The committee has not
been elected owing to the pressure of
other business.
Juan Gaulberto Gomez presented a
preamble and resolution regarding the
election of a commission to the United
States to present the true state of af
fairs regarding the actual condition of
Cuba to President McKinley. The pre
amble is a long document, exceedingly
well written, drawing a parallel be
tween Cuba to-day and the United
States at the close of actual hostilities
between England and the colonies. It
is full of historical facts and shows the
author to be a close student of Ameri
can history and institutions. Its de
ductions are logical and In accord with
American procedure in Cuba. Before
the vote to-day it was eloquently dis
cussed by Manuel Sanguilly, Freyre
Andrade, Rafael M. Portuondo, Gon
zales Lanuza and its author. No one,
after listening to the remarks of these
gentlemen who represent the Cuban
revolutionary sentiment, need fear any
act hostile to the United States on the
part of the Cuban army.
During all the sessions of the Assem
bly I have not heard one word reflect
ing on the honesty and good faith of
the United States respecting* Cuba. On
the contrary all elements, civil and
military, represented In the Assembly,
have nothing but pr # aise and gratitude
to the American people. The preamble
and resolution were adopted unani
mously and at to-night's session the
commission will be elected.

SPAIN'S SMALL INDEMNITY
PRESIDENT McKINLEY DETER
MINES UPON HIS COURSE.
The Dons Will Accept Bather Than

Losing the Canary j,

NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: Instead of pay-
Ing Spain $40,000,000 as indemnity
for the cession of the Philippine
Islands to the United States, President
McKinley intends to reimburse her
only for her debt of about $1,000,000
contracted for public improvements.
President McKinley and his Cabinet
have carefully noted that the sentiment
expressed throughout the country by
the elections has been in opposition to
the suggestion of indemnity to Spain
to the extent first proposed. As first
announced by the administration au
thorities, it was intended to give Spain
the principal of the entire debt floated
in the Philippine Islands as security
and amounting to $40,000,000. What
will be paid by the United States, ac
cording to the present intention of tha
President, is the debt contracted by
Spain for the establishment of light*
houses, harbor improvements and pub
lic buildings. All told, I was Informed
to-day this does not amount to a very
large r a, being fixed at about $1,000,
000.
It Is not believed in official circles
here that Spain will withdraw her Com
missioners from Paris. She has no de
sire to lose the Canary Islands, and I
understand she is apprehensive that in
case of the resumption of hostilities
the American Government would seize
and perhaps permanently hold them.
I was told by a high administration of
ficial that in case ~1 the withdrawal
of the Spanish Commissioners the
United States Government would com
plete the military occupation of the
Philippines, and would take such other
steps a.' it mijht deem advisable for
the protection of this country's rights
in the far East.
From Mr. Day the officials have
learned that the American Commis
sioners yesterday presented a reply to
the Spanish refusal to surrender the Is
lands and it is expected that now the
administration has been so satisfac
torily indorsed by the country, the
Spaniards will appreciate the hopeless
ness of their position and accede to the
demands of this Government.
APPALLING CONDITION
OF AFFAIRS IN HOLGUIN
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â W. R. War
ner, .writing from Holguin, Cuba, says
his arrival there with a portion of the
supplies on the schooner Moose oc
casioned much surprise on the part of
the 10,000 Spanish troops still in garri
son at that place. He made a super
ficial examination of the town and
found much smallpox. He estimated
the deaths at thirty a day for the army
and as many in the poorer quarters.
Every hut is infected, and women, chil
dren and men lie literally rotting to
death without the care of "even one
doctor."
The poverty, he declares, is beyond
description. "But," he adds, "the poor
devils are patient; they don't complain.
They are used to it, I suppose. The
Spaniards have harassed them so long
that nothing troubles them any more."
He speaks hopefully, however, and
says he will, upon the arrival of the
vaccine points shipped to him, begin
the work of vaccination.

President Smith of the Board of I
Health stated that nothing had yet j
been heard from Colonel Barber in re- j
ply to the board's note calling attention
to the conditions at the camp. Work ,
of disinfecting and cleaning out refuse
has begun in earnest and is being ac- j
tively pushed forward. Fumigation is
being employed in many places. At
Camp Otis, for instance, the tents and
bedding of the men have been thor
oughly treated.
Thirty enlisted men of the First New ;
York, under the command of Major C. j
J. Chase, who recently resigned his
commission as major in the United
States army, will leave on the Australia '
for San Francisco. One of the men.
Sergeant A. E. Winter, has been dis
charged by tel â aphic instruction from ,
the Secretary of War, and others have
been granted furloughs on surgeons' J
certificates of disability.
On the Australia came orders from
Washington to discharge Private Wil
liam Odd], Company M. First New
York. Private pdell has been sick in
the Military Hospital for several days,
and when discharged therefrom will be â¢
handed his papers. He has secured a
position with the Hawaiian Electric I
Company. Odell, prior to his advent in ;
the army, was connected with the
Brush Electric Company of Albany,
N. Y. !
The troopships Valencia and Senator I
sailed for Manila yesterday afternoon,
with the Oregon, Washington and Cali
fornia Artillery and other troops.
To add to the troubles of the Arizona
the water tank burst yesterday and will !
have to be repaired before the vessel
can go to sea. It will take about four [
days to put it in order again. Present
indications are that the transport will
sail next Sunday for Manila.
Captain John Barnesson of the Ari
zona has given up the. command of that
vessel and gone to Seattle on the City of
Columbia, where business interests
calls him. He is succeeded in command
by First Officer C. W. Ames, who is
well known among ship masters, and is
well liked.
Captain A. W. Perry, chief quar- i
termaster in charge of the Arizona, has
made himself exceedingly well liked
'among the invalided soidierÃ the Arl- ;
zona brought back from the Orient. He
did everything in his power to make
them comfortable, and helped them to
regain health. His attentions to Wil
liam Conlan, a private of the Four
teenth Infantry, who died on the trip,
were most assiduous and commanded
the admiration of all on board. Conlan
was a San Francisco boy, only about
IS years old. His father is in Manila
now In the Third Artillery.
President Dole is of the opinion that
it will be necessary for him to make
a trip to Washington, probably in Jan
uary of next jear. This will be after
the report of the Hawaiian Commis
sion has been received by the President
and Congress. It was the request of
Mr. Cullom, chairman of the Commis

be in attendance at Washington during
part of the time at least that prospec
tive legislation was before the com
mittees of the Senate or House or both.
General King has been confined to his

SUDDEN" DEATH OF A
PIONEER AT SELMA
After Four Trips to Alaska Frank
Dusy Succumbs to Election
Excitement.
SELMA, Nov. 10.â Frank Dusy died at
bis home here last night of heart failure,
aged 61 years. He was on the streets all
flay yesterday, interested 1:1 the election
rrturns, and was in his usual health last
night until 10:3 ft o'clock, when he called
his son to go for the family physician.
Death came to the sturdy pioneer within
a few moments of the physician's arrival.
Mr. Dusy arrived from Alaska only
about two weeks ago. He went to Cooks
Inlet in 1595, where he secured valuable
mining property. The next season he
chartered a schooner and took out a pack
train and a party ot prospectors from this
section. He has made four trips to Alaska
and has taken out three schooner loads
of miners and investors. He expected to
return to Cooks Inlet in the spring.
Mr. Dusy's life has been an eventful j
one, ana his name is familiar to the pio
neers of this section of the State. Ho !
came to California in 1553 and engaged in
mining in Tuolumne County. Later he â 
came to Fresno County and located at
Fort Millerton before Fresno City was
thought of. For twenty years he was one i
of the biggest sheep owners in the valley, j
and held larpe tracts of land which are :
n^w the garden places of the irrigated j
section. During thte Mussel Slough
trouble Frank Dusy was active, and the .
Mussel Slough sufferers, wherever scat
tered, still remember him vividly. He
owned some of the best property in this i
section at one time and built one of the ]
handsomest residences in the county a i
f < w years ago on his ranch near Selma. I
Mr". Dusy married in 1572 at Stockton
Miss Cassfe Ross, sister-in-law of J. W.
Ferguson. Just elected Assessor. Five
children survive him. Funeral services
will be held here to-morrow under the
auspices of the Masonic, Odd Fellow and
A. O. U. W. orders. The remains will be
Interred at Mountain View Cemetery, ]
Fresno, where his wife was interred six
years ago.
NINE NEGROES SLAIN
IN STREETS OF
WILMINGTON
Continued from First Page.
Following is a list of the dead and
wounded:
J. I. ETHERIDGE, white, killed at
polls.
THOMAS TOLBERT, white, mortally
wounded at the same time.
WADE HAMPTON McKINNEY.
JAMES WILLIAMS,
DRAYTON WATTS,
LiUM JACKSON, all colored, killed
yesterday.
ESSEX HARRISON, colored.
BEN COLLINS, colored, killed to
day.
Wounded: Sidney Tolbert, 15 years
old, dangerously wounded; John It.
Tulbert, white, collector of the port at
Charleston and chairman of the Re
publican State Executive Committee,
wounded; Stuart Miller, white, mor
tally wounded In head; C. Fleming,
white, shot in shoulder; M. J. Younger,
shot in foot; Cleave Armstrong, who
tried to protect the negroes, shot in the
neck.
In addition to these, two and likely
four negroes are reported to be dead in
the woods near where the five bodies
lay to-day.
The trouble was precipitated on elec
tion day, when two or three hundred
pegroes at the polls opened a fusillade
at the store in which the voting was
going on. In this fight FAheridge was
killed and Tolbert wounded.
The second occasion for provocation
was that a party hunting the slayers
of Etheridere was fired into and one,
Miller, fatally wounded, and Fleming
badly hurt.
The arming of the negroes at the
polls, the killing of Etherldsre. the fir
ing from ambush, all conspired to kin
dle a name of passion and when that,
will die down is difficult to tell. Jesse
Williams and two others are said to
have confessed to taking part in th^
ambuscade.
The incident of thp day was the kill
ing of Essex Harrison. Down the roai
came a squad of mounted cavalrymen,
with HarriÃon marching ahead with
guns and rifles drawn on him. Fifteen
men lined up on the roadside. The
negro was put out tot the road and told
to go toward the pile of four dead ne
groes. He started, there was a ring
of rifles and Harrison pitched forward,
dead. Harrison, it Is alleged, was a
member of the crowd that killed Ethe-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1895.
ARMY OPERATIONS
DURING THE YEAR
Report of Major-General
Miles.
SUMMER CAMPAIGN IN CUBA
HOW THE FALL OF SANTIAGO
WAS BROUGHT ABOUT.
The Capture of Porto Rico and the
Conquest of the Philip
pine Islands Re
counted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON. Nov. 10.â The renort
of M-Oor General Miles, commanding
the United States army, was made pub
lic to-day by direction of Secretary Al
ger. Th keynote of the report is
found in ne of the opening sentences,
where it is said: "The military oper
ations during 1 the year have been ex
traordinary, unusual and extensive." a
statement which is fully borne out by
the long recital of important events
which General Miles shows have made
the military history of the year 189S the
most remarkable since th_- end of the
Civil War.
In point of Interest the document di
vides naturally into four chapters, for
while brief allusion is made to such
matters as the military expeditions to
Alaska, interest naturally centers in the
j portion which treats of the war with
j Spain.
Under this general head the report
; deals with the plans of campaign, of
| the war preparations, with the Santi
i ago campaign, with General Miles' od
| erations in Porto Rico, and lastly with
| important changes in the existing or
| ganization, which are in General Miles'
! opinion necessary to make the army an
'. effective weapon for the defense of the
1 country.
Treating of the war Genpral Miles be
1 gins with a statement of the unpre
paredness of the country, showing how j
! the vast equipment left by the million
soldiers of the civil war has been dis
sipated or had become obsolete until
the tentage. transportation and camp
equipage was insufficient for any im- !
portant military operation. He re- |
counts tho legislation of Congress just !
prior to the war, looking to the increase \
of the army, and cites his own recom- |
mendation on April 9, that 40,000 men j
be provided for coast defense and re- I
serve, that the regular army be in- j
creased ar.d 10,000 immunes recruited, i
making a force of 162,597 men, which,
with 50.000 native auxiliaries, he con
sidered sufficient. Such a force proper- I
ly equipped he believed to be better
than a large force partly equipped. In
the letter containing this recommenda
tion he said: "I also recommend that
at least twenty-two regiments of in- i
fantry, five regiments of cavalry and
light artillery be mobilized and placed
in one large camp where they can be
carefully ' and thoroughly inspected,
fully equipped, drilled, disciplined and
instructed in brigades ami divisions
and prepared for war service."
He further asks "for 50,000 volunteers ]
to make up an army of 150,000 soldiers
for offensive operations in Cuba, the â 
whole force to be fully equipped, leav- i
ing the State troops to defend the i
coast? and for a reserve."
General Miles said in his report that i
in the beginning the war problem was
purely a naval one, and he was con- I
vinced that should our r.avy prove su- ]
perior the position of the Spanish army
in Cuba would be rendered untenable
with a minimum loss of life and treas
ure to the United States.
Orders are referred to for the send-
Ing of the regulars to New Orleans,
Tampa and Mobile to begin the invas- ,
ion of Cuba; for the gathering of troops
at Chickamauga and for the movement
of 70.000 troops on Cuba, "but none of
these movements on Cuba material
lied," he says. "The want of proper |
equipment and ammunition rendered
the movement impracticable."
At this point there is a brief digres
sion whore, in a paragraph. General
Miles refers to General Merritt's Phil
ippine expedition, as organized and
equipped and conducted, as being sue- j
cespful in every way."
General Miles then pays an eloquent
tribute to the brilliant exploits of Lieu
tenants Rowan and Whitney, who se
cretly explored Cuba and Porto Ri<-o ,
and ascertained the military situations. !
He resumes the report with an ac
count of the dispatch of General Shaf
ter's expedition, Faying: "I desire to
go with this command." He also
stated: "This expedition has been de
layed through no fault of any one con
nected with it. It contains the prin
cipal part of the army, which for In- |
telligence and efficiency is not excelled
by any body of troops on earth."
After detailing the operations before
Santiago General Miles describes the
1 negotiations with General Toral for the
surrender and the capitulation of the
Spanish forces.
General Miles closes his report with !
: some earnest recommendations for thÂ»
i improvement of the miTitarv service. He \
\ trusts the experience of the last few
! months will be valuable to the people and
!to the Government. The value of coast
defenses, he says, has been proven and j
I the system should be completed without
I delay. He favors the adoption of a stand
j ard of strength for the army to meet the
country's growth, and sugrgests that it
I be one soldier to every 1000 population,
! yielding a force of 62.759. He also recom
mends the authorization of an auxiliary
force of native troops In Cuba, Porto
; Rico and the PhiliDpines. to be officered
by United State? officers, and not exreed
'â â  iriff two soldiers for 1000 population of the i
I Islands, and all these increases, he urges, ]
I should be made at once.

â¢ Passengers,
SEIZURE OF A YUKON FLEET
CANADIAN REMEDY FOR A
BREACH OF CONTRACT.
Captain Abercrombie of the Govern
ment Surveyors Tells of Con
ditions and Strikes in
Alaska.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 10.â A report comes
from Dawson that the Canadian Gov
ernment has seized two steamers and
two barges of the Yukon River fleet of
the Boston and Alaska Transportation
Company for breach of contract. The
company, it is claimed, contracted to
deliver the ivernment goods in July,
but did not fulfill the contract until
September. Captain Blakeley of one of
the barges is supposed to be in jail at
Dawson, charged with broachir.s the
cargo. He is accused of making away
with a ouantlty of whisky belonging
to Donohoe & Co.
The steam schooner Excelsior arrived
here to-day from Copper River, Alaska,
with about 200 passengers, among
whom was Captain W. R. Abercrom
bie, U. S. A., and his party of Govern
ment surveyors, including F. C. Schra
der, geologist; Emll Marlow, topo
graphist, ajid nine enlisted men. The
Abercrombie party claim to have cut
a trail from Valdes to Copper River,
which does away with the dangerous
trip over the glacier and shortens
the distance sixty miles. Abercrombie
said:
"Of the 3000 ' that went into the Cop
per River country from nine to eieven
hundred will winter there. Those Who
came back either lost their outfits or
were grubstaked tenderfeet who simply
sat around camp and searched but lit
tle if at all for gold. There are three
placer mining camps in the interior, at
Lake Sealota, the Tonsina and Consina
rivers. Coarse placer gold has been
found at all of them. Bedrock has not
been reached yet on account of the
water. W. S. Amy of San Francisco
has discovered a big vein of bituminous
coal west of Teslin Lake."
Accompanying Abercrombie is the
United States Coast and Geodetic party,
consisting of H. P. Ritter, E. B. La
tham. H. S. Benson and several others,
who have been at work all summer on
the Copper River delta, procuring
complete maps and data. Th; delta is
about thirty miles wide.

but claims the Eleventh Illinois, one dis

the Ninth Indiana. Mr. Babcock stated
that the Nineteenth and Thirty-second
New York districts, which have been
given to the Democrats, might yet be
added to the Republican column. ''I

LOST IN A STORM
ON LAKE MICHIGAN
The Schooner S. Thai Goes Down
With the Captain and Crew of
Three Men.
CHICAGO, Nov. 10.â Water logged and
unfit to weather a storm upon the Lakes.
the S. Thai, a tramp two-masted schoon
er, foundered off Glencoe, In the gale of
Wednesday night, and went to pieces in
the surf. This morning the â wreckage was
cast upon the beach, but no trace of the
crew has been found and it is thought
that all went down after cutting loose
from the wreck in the ships dory. The
schooner Is a total wreck. There are
scarcely two timbers left together to in
dicate her dimensions. That she founder
ed and went to pieces on the sand bars
some distance out in the lake is evidenced
by the wreckage which covers the shore
from Ravlnia to Wilmette, a distance of
nearly seven miles. The hull has disap
peared and Is supposed to be resting on
the bars Just in shore from where the
schooner was seen to drop anchor shortly
before the storm broke Wednesday after
noon.
On board the schooner were Captain J.
Schultman and a crew of three men.
ARMY OF OCCUPATION
TO EMBARK FOR CUBA
General Wade's Urgent Request That
the Troops Be Forwarded at
Once.
NEW YORK. Nov. 10.â A Washington J
special to the Herald says: An effort will j
be made to get the Eighth Cavalry off !
from Savannah to-morrow, but their em- j
barkation had bet-n set for an earlier
date and there is probability of further
delay. General Wade has made an urg
ent request that the troops be at Nuevi
tas and Puerto Principe by November If,
as those two points are to be evacuated
on November 22. and he wishes the United
States troops to be well established be
fore the evacuation. So General Carpen
ter's Brigade, composed of the Eighth
Cavalry, Fifteenth Infantry and Thini
Georgia, may he hurried forward.
Every precaution is being taken to
equip the camps in such a way as to
guard against fever. The authorities say
that this precaution is one of the causes
of delay in embarkation.

IN DEADLY STRIFE
Halfbreeds Attacked by
Fullbloods.
AT LEAST ONE MAN KILLED
NEARLY A DOZEN REPORTED
WOUNDED.
Serious Situation Growing Out of the
Ratification of the Agreement
With the Dawes Com
mission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EUFALA, I. T., Nov. 10.â It is known
here that there has been fighting at
Okmulgee, the capital of the Cr^ek Na
tion, where the council met Tuesday.
For forty-eight hours rumors of
trouble have been drifting from Okmul
gee, which is forty miles off the rail
way and without telephone or tele
gTaph service. It is known, however,
that the full-bloods have made an at
tack on the treaty leaders at Okmulgee
and that at least one man has been
killed and seven or eight wounded. All
the Indian police at Agent Wilson's dis
posal have been ordered to Okmulgee
and soldiers will follow. The white peo
ple feel able to take care of themselves.
The only fear is for the half-breeds,
who voted for the treaty.
CHECOTAH, I. T., Nov. 10.â The
Creek returns are all in and show that
the treaty has carried. Twelve hundred
full-bloods stayed away from the polls.
The council is in session at Okmulgee.
The full-blood chief threatens to kill
the people who voted for the treaty.
Indian police were ordered by the agent
to Okmulgee. Chief Ishparreher threat
ens to burn the towns in the Creek Na
tion along the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railway. The Indians are very
restless.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.âWashing
ton officials have received no advices
confirming the reported serious situa
tion in the Creek Indian Nation, i
growing out of the ratification of the;
agreement with the Dawes Commission,
but they are not altogether surprised at
the stories. The full-bloods have all j
along fought+the negotiations, and it is j
regarded as natural that they are re- i
luctant to yield their possessions. No
recent reports from there indicate
threatened trouble, but the authorities j
are ready to take whatever action is
necessary on official notification of lh3 \
trouble. ______________

Special Correspondence o* The Call.
MANILA, Sept. 29.â There has been
so far little of the religious element in
troduced by the Americans into the
war in the Philippines. It is true that
we have found here a somewhat com
plicated religious situation. I believe
firmly nothing like it has been seep, in
modern times, the priests of both the
Spaniards and the Tagallos, acknowl
edging the same head, being even more
bitter against each other than the lay
men of their respective followings. It
is likewise true that some of the less
reputable of the Spanish priests have
been suspected, with what justification
I have been as yet unable to ascertain,
of striving to stir up the natives
against the Americans. The Arch
bishop of Manila at all events has been
no party to these alleged plots. That
prelate, a man of more than ordinary
talent and of most commanding pres
ence, has personally assured me of his
belief that the only hope of the church
here lies in the stability of the govern
ment, and that the only hope of sta
bility lies in permanent American oc
cupation. The clergy, all that is good
in it. share his views as a matter of
course. In view of the existence of
this spirit it is most unfortunate that
there should have occurred an Incident
; which is most properly characterized in
the following open letter from the
Paulist Father Doherty to Major Gen
eral Otis:
MANILA. Sept. 28, IS9B.
Maj. Gen. E. S. Otis, Military Governor
Philippine Islandsâ Dear Sir: On the 21st
inst. an officer of the commissary depart
ment, said to be Captain Lynn, with a
detail, entered the College of St. Cath
erine, Manila, and. with the ostensible
purpose of verifying the commissary sup
plies within, the party intruded them
selves upon the reserved precincts of the
convent cloister, and even into the cells
or sleeping rooms of the nuns. These acts
were accompanied by demands to open
the doors in the lattice between church
and cloister, a door which is never
opened, except to admit the passage of
the blessed sacrament to the sick or
dying. The nuns protested as best they
could against, this needless humiliation,
but after the threats of the officer to blow
or burst It open, the door was, to no pur
pose, unlocked. - â  '-. - ; * '-â¢*.'. â  ' '

There are duties which, though painful,
are necessary, and. when performed at
the hands of a gentleman, acting under

party with due submission. But when
unnecessary and officious interference is
imposed upon a refined, reverent and
peaceful people, and is accompanied by
brusaueness of manner and brutality of
method, it is high time for some one to
protest, and this I do as an American cit

position to let grass grow under his
feet since coming out here. He is a
man of actionâ and he does not seem
possessed of that snrae wild desire to
leave Manila which General Merritt
displayed so openly. Possibly there is
no young woman to act as a magnet,
drawing the general commanding back
over thousands of miles of^blue waters.
REEVES BECOMES
A BRIGADIER GENERAL
Army Men Believe, However, That
Colonel Smith Was More En
titled to Promotion.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Speria! Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Sept. 21.â There is another
brigadier general In this army. Really,
you know, if this kind of thing Is to go
on there will be more brigadier gen
erals than there are regiments to be
commanded. They have already gone
beyond the number of brigades, and
still Colonel Smith of the First Cali
fornia, the one man whose gallant ser
vice in the field should entitle him to
promotion, has not been given the star*
he has so richly deserved. Colonel I
Reeve of the Thirteenth Minnesota ia
the new man to step up. and it puzzles
us all down here to grasp the system
used in playing the political military
game at Washington. A scheme that
! gives the most to the men who de
| serve the least, and gives nothing at
all to the most deserving Is, we own, |
too deep for us. There is not a regu
lar army man here, not a naval man
acquainted with all the facts, not a
newspaper man on the ground compe
tent to judge of conditions but will tell
you James F. Smith of San Francisco
earned his promotion on the 31st of
July, and earned it over again when ha
led the men of his regiment down the
Calle Real through Hermita and Ma
late on the 13th of August, the first
to reach the gates of the walled city
and to pass thence down into the Es
coita and Malacanan. James F. Smith
is pleasantly overlooked, like a white
chip, and men are promoted whose only
possible claim to honor lies In -the fact
that it is probably good politics to ad
vance them. Colonel Reeves of Min
nesota is a good fellow, as good fellows
go, but they who were on the right
with McArthur when Manila fell tell
strange tales of how the Astor Bat
tery's support failed, and how the
Americans would have been repulsed
there, despite the splendid success of
the Coloradansand Calif ornians and the
Twenty-third and Eighteenth regulars
before Malate if it had not been for
the gallantry' of the Astor Battery boys
themselves and of the Third Artillery '
and the Fourteenth regulars; and they
are army officers who tell these tales,
men whose word is their bond. The
Minnesota Regiment, Colonel Reeves
commanding, was in the first line of
the support of the Astor Battery. One
company of the Minnesota Regiment,
or, rather, forty-six men of one com
pany, headed by their captain, were
found, two hours after the white fla?
was flown from the citadel, crouched
down up to their necks in the water
covering a paddy field.

HENLEY'S EXPLANATION.
This Is Not a Good Year for the
Democrats.
Barclay Henley, who was defeated by
D. J. Murphy for the District Attorney
ship, took the outcome of the election in
bo far as it related to himself In a philo
sophical manner. He attributed his de
feat to several causes.
"First and most important of all," said
he, "this was not a Democratic year. This
coupled wifh other causes led to the de
feat of Judee Maguire, and this in time
injuriously affected the municipal ticket.
"Second, it was well known that Buck
ley and Rainey. representing the 'push'
and the 'pull,' the vicious element of the
city, were throughout the campaign mak
ing my defeat a specialty.
"The foregoing reasons are sufficient in
themselves alone to account for my de
feat. The railroad and other corporations,
by indirection and otherwise, gave their
employes to understand that if what
seemed to be the Democratic programme
was carried out the result would oe a re
duction of wages. All of these things and
everything could not defeat a man of
such marked popularity as James D.
Phelan."
California's Congressmen.
Revised returns from the seven districts
show that the prediction made of the
election of six Republicans and one Dem
ocrat to Congress is correct. De Vries in
the Second District being the only suc
cessful Democrat. The six Republicans
elected to Congress are: Barham in the
First. Metcalf In the Third, Kahn in the
Fourth. Loud in the Fifth, Waters in the
Sixth and Needham in the Seventh.
Railroad Commissioners.
Latest returns from the three districts
show that the Republican candidates for
Railroad Commissioner have been elected
as follows: First. District, Edson; Sec
ond District, Laumeister; Third District.
Blackstoek.
Charles Rollo Peters writes about
Alexander Harrison, the famous
American painter, in next Sunday's
Call.
DESPONDENT WIDOW
ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
DISGUSTED WITH LIFE, MRS.
WOLF TAKES CARBOLIC ACID.
After Brooding Over Her Losses at
the Racetrack She Resolves to
End Her Existence.
Alice Wolf, the widow of the late Dr.
Wolf, while despondent last night over
her losses at the racetrack, swallowed
a dose of carbolic acid. Dr. Robert Mur
phy, who was summoned to attend her,
believes that she will recover.
Mrs. Wolf lives at Capp and Twenty
first streets. Shortly after Q o'clock last
evening she bade her apod mother good
by, after telling her that she fas going
to Visit her friend. Mrs. Allen, who lives
in a lodging house at 612 Eddy street.
She had Just returned from the racetrack
and appeared desponda*Â»t over her losses.
Before seeing her fflend the unfortunate
woman went to a drugstore on Grant
avenue and purchased a bottle of car
bolic acid. She then repaired to the lodg
ing house on Eddy street, and going to
Mrs. Allen's room, complained that she
was feeling ill. Mrs. Allen advised her
to seek rest and offered her the use of her
bed.
Mrs. Wolf took advantage of her
friend's offer, and after discarding her
street attire threw herself on the bed.
"I'm disgusted with this life," she lugu
briously remarked. "I wish 1 was dead."
Mrs. Allen tried to cheer her up and was
about to leave the room when Mrs. Wolf
placed the bottle of carbolic acid to her
lips and drank the contents. Wirh a wild
scream for help Mrs. Allen ran from the
house, intending to summon a physician.
Meeting Police Officer Pyle she told him
what had happened, and he lost no time
in repairing to the scene. To his surprise.
HOWARD E. WRIGHT OF BERKELEY, WHO
ASPIRES TO BE SPEAKER OF
THE ASSEMBLY.
Now that the political complexion of the next Legislature Is fin
ally determined public attention is turned to the measures and the
men that will dominate the proceedings of the coming session of Cali
fornia's law-making body. At the present moment interest is chiefly
centered in the subject of who will be chosen Speaker of the As
sembly. The most prominent aspirant for the position, which is
rightly considered one of the first importance, is Howard E. Wright
of Berkeley. It seems scarcely probable that there will be any defi
nite opposition to Mr. Wright's candidacy, as his record as a legis
lator is irreproachable and his ability to discharge the duties of the
important position unquestioned. As a member of the last Assembly
he identified himself in behalf of every measure beneficial to the
people of the State. He was the author of the university tax bill
which made possible the great progress that now marks the life of
the greatest educational institution in the West. It was his motion,
made on the floor of the Assembly, that caused the now famous tele
grams in the coyote scalp bill scandal to be read.
That the citizens of Mr. Wright's own district appreciate his
merits is made plain by the fact that he was re-elected by a ma
jority of more than eleven hundred votes over his opponent.
he was refused admittance to the room
where the desperate woman lay in the
agony of death. A middle-aged man, who
claimed he was a "friend or the family,"
not only denied admittance to the guard
ian of the peace but refused to give the
name of the woman who had tried to de
stroy herself. It was not until the police
man threatened to force an entrance that
the stranger allowed him to enter.
Even Mrs. Allen at first refused to
throw any light on the Identity of the
despondent woman.
After considerable questioning she flnal
17 admitted that her name was Mrs. Wolf
and that despondency had impelled her to
make an attempt on her life.
Another woman, who peemed distracted
over the attempted suicide of Mrs. Wolf,
stood guard over the door of the room and
refused to answer any questions.
"If poor Alice dies." she declared, "her
story will be buried with her."
Further than that she positively de
clined to give any Information that would
fhow why Mrs. Wolf had attempted sui
cide.
BARRY IS RESIGNED.
Evident That the People Did Not
Want Democratic Rule.
James H. Barry, the defeated candidate
for Congress in the Fourth District, does
not appear to be cast down. He is satis
fled that the people did not agree with
him that the Democrats should win, and
that it was entirely right that they should
vote against him.
"I am a Democrat," said he, "and the
support 01 such "overnment as the people
want is the first duty of every man who
thinks the people should rule. The defeat
of Judge Maguire is a calamity not to
him but to the people who aefeated him.
jne war feeling which paid no heed to
the scandals of Algerlsm, and the Im
mense amount of money at the command
of the Republican party, brought about
the result."
Dr. Shrady writes about the de
cadence of business men in next
Sunday's Call.

IN HIS LUST FOR SUCCESS M. H. SHERMAN
PRECIPITATED A BITTER FINANCIAL WAR
The Struggle to Crush the Los Angeles
Cable Railway System Forced Bankers
Into Conflict.
Managers of the Pacific Bank Warned to Retire
From the Electric Road Deal or Repeat
Ralston's Crash.
The Call begins this morning its ex
pose of the secret manipulations that
led the Pacific Bank and Its feeder, the
People's Home Savings Bank, Into the
tremendous speculation of the Los An
geles electri' railroad. This project
practically cost the Pacific Bank and
Its feeder their existence. The scheme
was conceived in the brain of Moses H.
Sherman, who trapped the bankers of
Pine and Sansome streets into a sup
port of his tremendous venture. Sher
man, as already indicated, -first at
tained prominence in Arizona, where he
floated several financial t henries and
in support of them won the confidence
and with It the money of Frank V.
McDonald. Having found Frank Mc-
Donald an easy game Sherman went to
Los Angeles, surveyed the field and de
termined to build a great electric road
system in competition to the cable road
that was then in operation.
Sherman had no money, but through
the confidence of Frank McDonald he
had the Pacific Bank behind him. Be
fore Sherman conceived the idea of an
electric road in Los Angeles he had
foisted upon the Pacific Bank through
Frank McDonald his vastly overesti
mated properties In Phoenix and in dif
ferent parts of Arizona. His state
ments in reference to these holdings
were mendacious to the last degree.
What he owned was not worth the sup- i
port that the Pacific Bank gave, but
Frank McDonald was a willing listener
to flattery, and when Sherman asked
him to visit Los Angeles and consider
the project of an ele-.-tric railroad the
young man readily obeyed. Sherman
â exploited the advantages of competi
tion to the cable road then in operation
under the supervision of J. F. Crank.
The wily manipulator showed the
young barker how an electric railroad
could be operated for two-thirds the
cost of a cable system. Frank took the
bait and with it a hook that subse
quently kilif-d the Institution of which
he was cashier. The Los Angeles cable
system had been floated in San Fran
cisco and Chicago under the direction
of Crank. The first mortgage amount
ed to one million five hundred thousand
dollars, and was taken in this city by
capitalists and commercial and sav
ings banks. The second mortgage of
one million five hundred thousand dol
lars w.is taken by capitalists, banks
and trust companies of Chicago. It was !
Sherman's deliberate scheme to wreck \
this road so that he might control it j
and build the great electric system.
His scheme cost the People's and Pa
cific banks their existence.
Under the nattering suggestion of
Sherman Frank McDonald believed
that the bunds of the electric road
could be floated as readily as those of
the cable system. He found out his
mistake too late to save his banks and
the honor of his family. Under Sher
man's direction a corporation wa
formed, stock was printed and M. 1
Sherman was made president of the
system. The Pacific Bank built the
road, supplying $600,000. Sherman, as
might have been expected, did not con
tribute a cent, violating his promise to
supply one-half the cost. Through a
series of combinations and manipula
tions he deluded the cashier of the Pa
cific Bank and made that lnstitutio
become a security for his own portion
of the cost. Having secured such a tre
mendous position of advantage S
man had the Pacific Bank and its
feedf-r, the People's Bank, just where
he wanted th<
They had to follow his lead and sup
port his schemes or face public cen
sure for the loss of a tremendous sum
of money. The expose of such a loss
would have Inevitably resulted in a
run on the bank. The McDonalds ac
cepted the inevitable. They tried first
to drag Sherman, J. E. Farnum and
their clique of conspirators out of tha i
bank with an idea of operating the road
themselves. They failed in this and
then attempted to float the bonds of
the electric system. Again failure came
to them and the culminating crash.
"When the I'ucific bankers attempted to
gain control of the electric road sys
tem Sherman in anticipation of such
an effort determined to secure control
of the cable roads of Los Angeles. This
move brought J. F. Crank and the
holders of three million dollars in bonds
to the front.
The struggle became a determined
contest between the two great roads.
The capitalists and banks of this city
that held the cable bonda arrayed
themselves for a contest against the
Pacific and the People's banks, which
held the electric road bonds. In this j
struggle Sherman had nothing to lose
and everything to gain. As he argued
the situation he could not lose whoever
won in the contest. If the Pacific Bank |
lost Sherman remained as the only
powerful manipulator left in the elec- |
trie road to deal with the winners. If j
the Pacific Bank won and the cable
system of Los Angeles was wrecked
Sherman would continue to be. the
president and manager of the electric
railroad and Qwner of a great part of
the wrecked cable system.
This struggle, the secret hlUory of
which has never before become public
property, was one of the most gigantic
ever fought on this coast or In the
United States. It was a contest of
millions against millions, and as the
outcome proved determined the exist
ence of two great banks. When this
great fight began Sherman calculated
every possible contingency. He sur
rounded himself with able lawyers and
when the Pacific Bank and the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank crumbled, he
made terms with the opposition, sold
out his holdings In the Electric road
and profited with what belonged to the
wrecked institutions and their deposi
tors.
"When Sherman began his manipula
tions and with flattery seduced Frank
McDonald Into a support of his scheme
he carefully guarded against any mis
hap to the success of his plan. He was
closely allied to Millspaugh, the ex
claim adjuster of the Southern Pacific
Company, and through him gained thÂ«
support of that corporation. After he
had seduced Frank McDonald into th&
wild Phoenix proposition and before he
suggested his Electric deal he offered
himself as a director In the Pacific
Bank. According to his own assertion
he held only ten Ebares of stock in that
institution and acted simply in the ca
pacity of a dummy. He bought a few
shares of stock in the People's Home
Savings Bank and placed his cousin,
John E. Farnum, in the bank as secre
tary and manager. Having gained
'Id in both banks, he operated a
he pleased to the end, and when th
crash finally came lv: exercised his in
fluence to make Farnum manager o
the Pacific Bank. This in outline i
the story of the tremendous plot tha
Moses H. Sherman carried to a sue
cesaful conclusion, and in doing so ac
complished the downfall of both banks
SECRET HISTORY OF THE GREAT
CONSPIRACY.
The most thorough and complete in
vestigation of the Lus Angeles electric
railroad scheme that was ever attempt
ed was made by J 11. Woodard, ex
newspaper man and lawyer. This man
was the bitter and persistent enemy of
M. H. Sherman, and lost no opportu
nity to injure the crafty manipulator.
His enmity, however, was simply an in
cident. He was mure thoroughly in
formed of the condition of the electric
road and of the disastrous speculation
it represented to the Pacific Hank than
any man except Moses H. Sherraar
himself. Woodard was familiar wit!
the affairs of the great concern fron
the very inception of the project in th
brain of Sherman. At the request o
R. H. McDonald Jr. Woodard on Au
gust 4, 1592, submitted an exhaustive
report of the history of the road, it
condition at that time md its pros
pects.
Woodard demonstrated to young Me
Donald that the Pacific Bank had been
trapped into a dangerous venture and
that if it did not retire even with the
heavy loss it must sustain the bank in
evitably would go under. This report
of Woodard is vitally necessary to the
depositors and robbed creditors of the
defunct bank, if they care to obtain
a clear understanding of the gigantic
scheme that ruined the institution and
cost them their â  posits. In the report
Woodard has eliminated 'all personal
reflection upon Sherman. The report
simply recites the facts of the con
spiracy that resulted in the deception
upon the Pacific Bank. Sherman's wild
notions of finance and his absurd ideas
of floating bonds are described clearly
and something of the tremendous
struggle between the cable system of
Los Angeles and the electric road is
indicated.
This struggle provoked t'.ie most bit
ter enmity .between J. F. Crank, the
leading spirit in the cable road, and
Sherman. It organized most of the
banks of this city .against the Pacific
and the People's Home Savings banks,
and at one .stage of the n>ht forced a
run on the. People's Home Savings
Bank. It is perhaps not uninteresting
to remember that this run was pro
voked by the simultaneous publication
in two newspapers in this city of an
article that denounced the People's
Bank for holding electric bonds. These
publications, coming as they did on the
same morning and containing practi
cally tho same assertions, will prove an
interesting history In themselves at th
proper place In the recital nf th? men
and measures that ruined the two grea
hanks. Incidentally, Frank McDonah
exercised every influence in his posses
plon to prevent these articles from be
Ing published and to save the People'
Bank frÂ«m a run. F<>r reasons that wer
very clearly understood he failed. J
H. Woodard'S long report that wll
show how hurulre'lM of thousands r>
ii liars of the Pacific Bant wrere dissi
pated in thÂ° Los AnÂ«?elea slectric rail
road is given In full a? follows, and is
intended as a significant introrl notion
to the part that M. 11. Sherman and
his co-conspirators played in the de
struction nf the Pacific l'.:ink.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.j Aug. 4, 1892
Mr. R. H. McDonald Jr.. V. P. Pacific
Bank. San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir:
left San Francisco Monday p. m., as I tolc
you I expected to, and have been quite
busy with other matters, ko that only just
now have I found time to comply with
your request to give you my opinion o
tho street railway situation In Los An
greles. I shall keep In mind your sugges
tion that the expenditures have been made
on the electric property, and therefore
mat you are only considering what should
bo done to save the investment and, if
possible, make a profit out of It. I shall
give you the situation as I understand it
ana you can take such measures as you
think best to test the correctness of my
conclusions.
Primarilyâ There has been Invested in
the creation of the electric system only J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1898.
I the $675,000 expended by the Pacific Bank
and the Pacific Rolling Mill Company. To
this should be added the $25,000 loaned or
iginally through the People's Home Sav
ings Bank to the Topeka Rapid Transit
Electric Railway Company, and other
small sums paid out on different - lines,
â  making the entire sum invested almost
$750, 000. To secure this investment It was
I agreed that $1,600,000 of the first mortgage
bonds should be Issued upon this property
âthat the remaining bonds of the original
Issue should be destroyed. And right nere
we are met by a singular state of facts.
In September, 1&91, the "Syndicate
.Agreement" was entered into by which
$500,000 of the first mortgage bonds were
to be deposited with John M. C. Marble as
trustee, to secure a loan of $250,000. Col
onel Marble certified that he had the $500,
000 of bonds and $1,000,000 of the stock of
the Consolidated Electric Railway In his
possession. In addition to this, other
bonds were alleged to be deposited with
Colonel Marble, and he Issued receipts to
the owners thereof, but for the present
they can be left out of sight. Under this
trust about $180,000 was borrowed that I
know of, which sums are yet unpaid
Under the proposed pooling of the cable
and electric bonds, Trustees McKee and
porn claim to have $1,548,000 of the electric
bonds in their possession. If they have
that number, where are the $500,000 . of
bonds held by Trustee Marble? He could
not surrender them without the consent
of every holder of the syndicate agree
ment notes, and I know that such unani
mous consent has not been obtained.
Take the list of the owners of the $1250
000 of bonds stated to be outstanding
when tiie "pooling" scheme was first
?-'& ne ,- dl and you will observe that the
$000.000 of the Marble bonds were not em
braced In that list. If Colonel Marble
had the bonds which he certifies he had
and the other claimants had their bonds
*,, h Â£Â iÂ£ ce re, c m , ust have been outstanding
$1.<p0.000 bondsâ at the minimum. But '
when we go further and find that $1,548,000
bonds have been surrendered to McKee
a i ld l "Tn, and that they do not include
the $iÂ»00,000 which Colonel Marble certified
that he had. then there must have been
issued 52,100.000 to secure indebtedness up
on a property which did not cost the
company (I do not mean the manipula
tors) over $750,000, and upon which It was
agreed that the bonded indebtedness
should not exceed $1,600,000,
VVOOPARD GETS DOWN TO
V FIGURES.
But 1 will leave this branch of the sub
jectâ which I could give you pages of
detailsâ and turn to the practical side of
the proposed scheme of consolidation and
see if it can be carried Into effect The
Plan is to issue $3,000,000 bonds upon the
electric property, with which to pay:
Debts of Cable Company as follows:
Los Angeles Cable bonds, sold J536.000
Pledged as collateral â jjo^oOO
Total ............................ Tv 140 000
Floating debt of Cable Company "."'in
cluding street improvements now
practically due 100.000
Cost of foreclosure of Cable property... 60 000
I p eht of Electric Company: Â» '
Bonds outstanding 1.548,000
Floating debt 200 00
Two and a half years' Interest on
$3,000,000 450,000
Total .$3. 538, 000
There are other outstanding obligations
which I have not included, and could not
without disclosing the sources of infor
mation, which I cannot do at present
Let us now analyze the outstanding ob
ligations, that is, how will they have to
be met. You can say, by the direct ex
change of bonds, the following amounts:
Cable bonds Â»800,000
Electric bonds..... 1,644,000
Two ana a half yrars' Interest on '
j $2,348,000 352.200
Total * .$2,700,200
There will then be left $340,000 of the
cable bonds which will have to be pur
chased by cash. If a foreclosure Is reach
ed by which the Los Angeles Cable Rail
way Company's bonds are declared to
have priority over the bonds of the Pa
cific Railway Company, then the Electric
Company, as holder of $800,000, will have
to bid $800,000 to buy the property, that
c Railway Company, then the Electric
tnpany, as holder of $800,000, will have
bid $800,000 to buy the property, that 1*
70 cents on the dollar of the $1,140 000
bonds. Then they will have to pay' 70
cents on the $340,000 bonds not exchanged
or $238,000 cash. There are fifty-two elec
tric bonds which will not be exchanged
and they will be paid for in cash- add
this to the above and it makes $250,000
So we can make a book showing cash
necessary to be raised:
As given above $280 000
Floating debt and syndicate debt of '
Electric Company 2SO 000
Receiver's obligations on Cable Com- '
pany ; ,â¢ â¢"â¢ 100,000
Cost of foreclosure on Cable mortgages. soiooo
Total cash required $880,000
You can see that this sum of $680 000
cannot be raised on $299,800 of bonds '(if
sold at par) with 212 1 years Interest cou
pons cut off, or with them on. If sold at
par who will raise this $380,000 necessary
to be paid before the consolidation scheme
could be effected or have any legal force?
As to the status of the $3,000,000 of con
solidated electric bonds now issued as a
part of the pooling, or "consolidation"
scheme, what is In sight as security for
them? Let us examine the assets behind
them?
Consolidated Electric Railway plant,
which does not earn operating ex
' penses, and which cost $760 000
Bonds of Los Angeles Cable Company
$SsOO,uOO at 70 cents 660.000
Total cost of Electric assets $1,310,003
WHAT THE ROAD WAS REALLY
WORTH.
A3 the Electric Company has never
earned operating expenses, and in my
opinion cannot do so In the next five
years, it may be valued only for such an
amount as its tracks and cars and ma
chinery could be sold for as second-hand
material, and what could be realized from
the sale of the power-house grounds end
buildings. At the most liberal estimate
not over $300,000 could be realized now,
while the tracks and equipment are com
paratively new and good., This, then, re
duces the assets to secure $3,000,000 of 6
per cent bonds to $538,000, if 'they were
realized upon to-day. If the electric plant
has to be operated until a foreclosure can
be had of the cable mortgages (not less
than two and a half years) the electric
plant will be practically worn out and its
debts will be far in excess of what could
be realized upon it.
I am aware that quite a number of hold
ers of the Cable bonds as well as the
Electric bonds , went Into the pooling
scheme. with the belief that If would re
quire only a few months to place the
Cable property, with Its revenues. In tne
hands of the manipulators of the Electric
scheme; but certainly Judge Allen, Mr.
McKea and P. 8. Dora must hayÂ« known
A PROPHETIC WARNING OF FINANCIAL DISASTER.
Primarily â mere nas oeen invested, in the creation or tne
Electric system only the $675,000 expended by the Pacific Bank
and the Pacific Rolling Mill Company. To this should be added the
$35,000, loaned originally by the People's Home Savings Bank to
the Topeka Rapid Transit Electric Railway Company, and other
small sums paid out on different lines, making the entire sum in
vested almost $750,000. As the Electric Company has never earned
operating expenses, arid, in my opinion, cannot do so in the next
five years, it may be valued only for such an amount as its tracks
and cars and machinery could be sold for as second-hand material
and what could be realized from the sale of the power-house,
grounds and buildings . The real condition of affairs will be
looked into by investors, and when they are advised of the facts
they will buy no bonds. Investigation will disclose all I have
written to you, and so much more that you will regret that you of
fered the bonds in any market.
I fear if you do not do this that the Ralston fiasco will have
to be repeated, and even more widespread disasters result.
Respectfully submitted,
Almost a year oefore the crumbling of the Pacific 3ank and the People's Bank It. H. McDonald
Jr. was warned of the character of the desperate speculation into which M. H. Sherman had trapped the
bankers. This warning was given by J. H. Woodard, who possessed an expert knowledge of che af
fairs of the Los Angeles Electric Railroad. Woodard was unheeded, pnd his report to Dick McDona-J.
stands now as the first public knowledge of the inside facts jf Sherman's great scheme. It gives to the
public the first true history of one of the great conspiracies that ruined the McDonald banks.
that Buch a thine could not be done.
Hence, when any ngajres as to the earning
capacity are made, th% cable lineÃ cannot
be included, because no man can assert
that the Electric Company will ever have
control of them. I am confident, from
what I know now, that if the courts
should declare that the mortgage of the
Los Angeles Cable Railway Company is a
lien of the Paeifh- Railway Company's
mortgage, the property will be re
deemed from the purchasers under the
foreclosure of the prior Hen and that the
Electric Company will be entitled to re- 1
<.iv from the redemptioners only $560,
Â»r thr-ir JBOO.OOO of bonds. If on fore
closure the Electric Company 1 ds less
than $800,000 the redemptioners will have
less to pay. Indeed, it is impossible tnat
the cable property- should ever come into
the possession of the Electric Company.
We now come to the practical question,
in which you Ja're interested: "Can the Pa
cific Bank or the railway sell its conso.i
dation bonds of the new issue in England
or in any other market under the existing
conditions?" I tell you what you will
learn later onâ that it cannot do it. '1 he
real condition of affairs will be looki-d
Into by investors, and when they are ad
vised of the facts they will buy no bonds.
Investigation will disclose all I have
written to you and so much more that you
will regret that you offered the bonds In
any market.
NO CHANCE FOR THE BANK.
What, then, is the best line of policy
for those having actual investment In the
property? I told you during our confer
ence that. In my opinion, you should re
verse your lines of action, and move In
another directionâ that no matter how
badly the bank needed its money, it could
not get it nor sustain its credit by stand
ing behind the scheme any Longer. I
recommended that you recall your elec
tric bonds and pool with the holders of
the 836 cable bonds. This would make a
bond issue of less than $1,50u.<J00. Let the
electric bonds default their interest and
have a foreclosure as soon as it can be
reached. If you stop now the electric
road is wrecked at once. You may carry
It a while, possibly three or six months,
but the last condition will be far worse
than It Is now, and you will be only the
more deeply involved, and the credit of
your bank still further weakened. The
owners of the 836 cable bonds will be only
too glad to admit the bonds of
the Pacific Bank to a pro rata
I representation with theirs in 6uch
' a scheme, and if you should only
get 70 cents all round in cash you would
still have a profit on the bonds held by
you. If, on the other hand, the electric
property should pass into the control of
the combine, which I have suggested, you
would receive more than par in new
bonds for those now held by you, and the
new bonds would be worth par, for the
property can be so operated that it will
pay 6 per cent on $2,000,000. Of course to
reach this result, the entire electric plant
would have to be eliminated, that is aban
doned as a street railway system, but the
material and electrical machinery could
be utilized on such lines of the two sys
tems as it would be profitable to operate
You have nothing to fear from the pro
jectors of the Eastern scheme. They have
done your bank all the harm they can do
if you stop now, for I assure you that the
whole situation is widely understood, and
each effort to bolster it will only result
In further injury. Th<> whole financial
atmosphere about you is filled with state
ments of fact and exaggerations, and they
are growing stronger all the time. You
ask me to talk frankly to you, and I am
trying my best to do It. I desire that you
should save every dollar that your bank
has invested. and If I had any means of
helping you otfier than by advice, would
do so, but I know that the course you are
following now leads only to a lower level.
I heard at San Francisco that an effort
would be made to get the British Vice
Consul at that place to certify to the
scheme, and that act would be "coppered"
through the British Consul General, who
would be asked to warn British investors
against investment in the property.
I am well acquainted with the govern
ing committees of the Boston and New
York Stock Exchanges, and know what
will be required If an attempt is made to
list the electric bonds there, even for
wash sales.
I am satisfied you can go to Brown and
Alvord. Lovell White, John McKee and
.the others, and have them Join in the
plan which I have suggested, even if you
do not associate yourself with the Roll
ing Mill Company.
1 do not thlnte it necessary for your suc
cess that you have the rolling mill Join In
the scheme I have suggested, because you
ian succeed without them if they do not
want to join you.
I fear if you do not do this that the
Ralston fiasco will have to be repeated,
and even more widespread disasters re
sult. Respectfully submitted,

SHERMAN WANTED TO FLOAT
FIVE MILLIONS
After Sherman had Inveigled the Pa
cific Bank Into an expenditure of hun
dreds of thousands of dollars and had
issued bonds vastly in excess of the
true cost of the Electric road, he con
ceived another financial nightmare and
contemplated placing another bond
issue of 15,000,000. This schema was ex
posed by J. H. Woodard to Dick Mc-
Donald in the following letter:
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 6. 1592.
R. H. McDonald Jr. Esq.. San Fran
cisco, Cal.â Dear Sir: Since writing you
I have learned from a friend of mine
here that General Sherman has evolved
a new scheme tor handling the electric
property, and that is to issue a bond of
$6,000,000 which he proposes to sell in
England. This scheme for relieving the
ssitlea of the electric company is of
the sort that Is practiced by saloon keep
ers in curing a man of delirium tremensâ
giving him more whisky as a remedy for
his frfghtful condition. Of course. If this
scheme could be carried out it would re
iiirre another exchange of bonds, and by'
the time the exchange was half made
that oondition might be reiieved by exe
cuting a new mortgage of seven or tea
millions.
I am satisfied that If he la left alone
it won't take "him a great while to ex
plode the whole scheme himself. Wheth
er-he expects to make thli work or hot,
trw? result Is that those who hear of what
thVy deem his vagaries now understand
how he has gone kiting from one sehenio
to another, believing all the time that
the more obTlgutlons he could Issue the
richer he would be. If his mind is not
now unbalanced it seems to me that it
has been moving in an eccentric orbit,
anil tne quicker you sft on him the bet
ter it will be for all concerned. Tours
truly, J. H. WOU.UARD.
The Call will publish to-morrow
morning another scathing criticism of
Sherman's great project by George M.
Mitchell, who was a trusted employe
of the McDonalds. Mitchell not only
described to his employers the true na
ture of their investment, but he drew
a character sketch of the three great
figures in the financial tragedy, Moses
H. Sherman, his formidable antagonist,
J. F. Crank, and the merciless critic of
both, J. H. "Woodard. The public will
find great Interest in the characteriza
tion of these men by men who knew
them well.
AMONG THE CYCLERS.
Arrival of Some Prominent Devotees
of Wheeling Sport.
Dan E. Whitman, the well-known pro
fessional cycle racer, returned from Hono
lulu on the Australia yesterday, and will
leave for Los Angeles to-night to visit
his relatives, returning to the Islands
about December 1. Whitman first went
down there a year ago with Sharriek,
Jones and others to attend the opening
of the big Cyclomere Park track, and
becoming enamored of the place decided
to make It his home. He is established In
business and Is doing well. He says Allan
Jones has gone to Australia or New Zea
land to race. Conklin, the former mana
ger of the party. Is now in the newspaper
business at Honolulu.
Marry A. Lozier of the big Cleveland
manufacturing firm of that name, arrived
here day before yesterday In company !
with his brother. Ed Ross Lozier, who I
went as far as Portland to meet him. The j
Loziera have big Interests here and in i
the islands and Australia, and the pres- I

Residents In the neighborhood of the

their health and lives shall not be Jeopar-

I August Vetter against the company, in
which it Is sought to force the company
to adopt methods that will not endanger
I the health of the community, were filed
yesterday.
Dr. John T. Davis, a well-known chem
ist ami physician, in his affidavit staled
that he hud investigated* the matter in
volved and had found that through the
incineration of refuse, dead animals, tin
cans and garbage many poisonous
gasedfl. Including carbonic oxide, nitrous
oxide, carbonic acid and marsh gas. to
gether with many metallic oxides, were
found. These the physician declared were
especially poisonous to thoso predisposed
to bronchial affections and dangerous in
general to the health of the community.
Many residents of the district around the
crematory also made affidavits of the
foul odors that emanate from the stack
of the crematory. The case will be tried

Lieutenant Bennett "Will Continue
Investigation of Fort Baker
Scandal.
The Investigation into the conduct of
the officers of Battery B, California
Heavy Artillery, now stationed at Fort
Baker, went over yesterday until to-day,
owing to the fact that Lieutenant Ben
nett, who is securing the evidence in the
case, being forced to accompany General
Merriam on his official visit to the Italian
cruiser Etna, It wll! be several days be
fore Lieutenant Bennett completes the
work of taking all the evidence that he
desires to secure prior to submitting the
facts to General Merriam. As the case
now stands there does not seem any
chance of a court martial being avoided,
and in case one is ordered it is thought
that it will go hard with tha officers of
the battery.

RWEAKWOMEM.ECHOES OF THE LATE CAMPAIGN
PHELAN SAYS IT
WAS SENTIMENT
The Mayor So Analyzes All the
Recondite Reasons of His
Re-election.
BY ALICE RIX.
Che Mayor was in his office at the City
Hall. Tea, be would see me.
"Felicitations, your Honor," said I, en
tering. "I'm charmed."
"Thanks," said the Mayor. "So am I."
"You look a little done," I said, survey-
Ing him critically.
"Brown," replied the Mayor, â rolling
weakly.
"Still. It Is a great victory. You've tri
umphed, aa It vrere, over your own
party."
"What* s that?" asked the Mayor.
"Oh, I don't mean what you mean. I
wasn't even thinking of that."
"Thinking of what?"
"Oh, you know."
"Indeed," said the Mayor positively, "I
do not."
"Oh. well! Let's talk about something
else. I don't like to repeat disagreeable
things I hear about people."
"Go on," said the Mayor, fanning him
self with a copy of The Callâ ''l can stand
anything."
"Oh, this twaddleâ of coarse It's all
twaddle â about your trading off your
ticket, swapping votes, you knowâ"
"Twaddle!" exclaimed the Mayor Indig
nantly. "Calumny!"
"Yes! And betraying your party-^*
"Pooh!" said the Mayor. "Slanderl"
"And the State--"
"Nonsense I"
"And getting yonxself elected over
everybody!"
"That's a likely storyl"
THE MAYOR-ELECT AWAITS THE FIRST FRUiTS OF VICTORY.
"And throwing down Majrulre â "
"How could I do that without somebody
else knowing it?"
"I should think Magulre would have
noticed it."
"Yes, and plenty of others besides Ma
guire. All I have to say about such
charges is, they are false" â the Mayor
waved a short arm dramatically â "they
are false!"
"I'm glad," I said, "to know that.
They're nut very nice things to believe
about anybody."
"Believe?" repeated the Mayor. "Who
believes tht-m?"
"Why, I don't know, I'm sure. The
. people who assert them, I suppose."
"The people who invent them, per
haps," suggested the Mayor, sneeringly,
"atnJ who Invented them out of â of â out of
thin air. 1 1 didn't have to buy votes or
swap votes or resort to any such means
to gut el< people were with me
from the .start, and I knew it. The only
trouble with the campaign is that it has
tx . too <i.;m. We might have done
legitimately many things we did not do,
and if w< had we would have carried our
own ticket through."
"What Jo you think of your new board
barring little differences of political
opinii
'J have no criticism to make of the new
board/ replied the Mayor. "I do not
know any of the men elected to It. The
men on my own ticket I did know. They
were in every way fitted for the respon-
Bil Ility â men of education, university-bred
ji;..si of them. Leland, you know, and
liartk'tt and those men. You know Bart
lett, do you? Bright fellow."
"1 heard him make a speech at a meet-
Ing in the Thirtieth District. He did not
shine particularly, as J remember."
"Ah!" said the Mayor. "You have to
know your audience. I do not recall my
own speech in the Thirtieth, but v seems
to me it went^ didn't it."
"They all did," said the Mayor,
thoughtfully, "and all through the
dence districts of the city âthe a&ayor
waved in a northwesterly airectionâ "l
had the same enthusiastic support I
could not go around you know to :;peak to
little householder, take him lÂ»y the
hand Individually nnd pledge myself to
Bupport his Interests, but 1 appealed to
â¢ lass at every district meeting and
I am euro 1 reached them all. Ihe votes
showed it. This was really a sentimental
algn."
"Dear me! That s a delicious idea.
How do you make it out, though?"
â¢'Why, didn't we appeal to the senti
ments of the people â over the heads of
corporations, monopolies, bosses, frauds,
disreputables? We said, 'Here! You want
justice, <-(jualiza.tion, city improvements,
freedom from corporation rule, don't you?
Well, we will give it to you. The matter
rt-sts in your own bands. It is entirely
your own* affair. You can have your own
way if you want it! You can cast off op
pression and boas rule! Choose your own
board, and select your own Mayor"
\nd " added the Mayor complacently,
"they did. Sentiment elected me."
"it didn't elect the- Supervisors, though.
Weren't they sentimental enough?"
'â¢The trouble is,' explained the Mayor,
"that we were all sentiment. We ought
to have been more practical. We ought
to have organteed. We ought to have
perfected the machinery of the Demo
cratic p^arty. If we had organized prop
erly we would have carried the municipal
ticket. The Democratic party was di
vided against itself, torn by Internecine
strife. There was the difficulty. You see
we broke up the organization of the
bosses at Sacramento and we never at
tempted to supply Its place. The Repub
lican party held fast together and the
Republican wave which swept the State
was too strong for us. This Re
publican fever Is all due to the war. It's
true that *hp war was an American war,
not a Republican war. but the present Ad
ministration got all the credit of it. You
can generally trace up a thing of this
sort if you try."
"And you think that accounts for the
big Republican wave, as you call it?'
"Did I call it a wave?" asked the Mayor
thoughtfully. "I ought to have said a
ground swell. I never saw anything like
It."
"Did It make you feel nervous, then, for
a while?"
"Well, yes." said the Mayor, smiling
a little palely at the thought, "when the
returns for the State ticket began to
come In so strong we did feel a little
doubtful. Still, on the whole. I was con
fident I had a great deal to make me feel
so. Did you witness the demonstration
at the Mechanics Pavilion?"
"No. I only read about It."
"That wouldn't give you any Idea of It,"
said the Mayor. "I just happened to
drop in there after speaking over at
North Beach, not really expecting to find
much â you know things are apt to fall
flat at the Pavilion because you can't
make yourself heard In the place. Well,
if you'll believe me, my appearance was
the signal for an ovation. I bowed once
but that wouldn't satisfy them. Then I
bowed again and they cheered
and cheered! And every man and woman
in the place was waving a little American
flag, andâ well, I tell you â " The Mayor
paused, overcome by the recollection.
"That's a pleasant feature of politics.
Isn't It?" I said.
"Well, yes." said the Mayor, "I think
the- evidences of popularity encourage
a man wonderfully in public work â -
What is it?"
"A lady, sir," said the clerk at the
door.
"I can't see any ladies now," said the
; Mayor pulling down his cuffs. "I'm going
i out to drive.
"She'll not detain you long, sir," said
the clerk. "She only wants to hand you
something."
"What is It?" asked the Mayor sus
piciously.
"Flowers, sir."
The Mayor colored sweetly.
".Mure evidences of popularity," I mur
i mured.
i "Why doesn't she send them in?" asked
i the Mayor.
"She says, sir, that she would like to
hand them to you herself. She says that
if you'd just step here to the door and
take them she'll feel it a compliment."
"Is she young and beautiful?" inquired
the Mayor.
"No, sir. But she's a very respectable
looking lady sir."
"Ah?", said the Mayor, indifferently.
"Shall I ask .ier in. sir?"
"No," said" the Mayor, hastily. "I'll go
out."
Me came back beaind a large bunch of
Papa Gontiers, looking as pleased as
Punch.
"Was she?"
"Was she what?"
"Young and fair."
"Never mind," saJd the Mayor.
"This comes of being a sentimental
Mayor. How often do these little things
happen?"
"Oh! 1 assure you "
"Ah? apl"
"Well! One modest little bunch of vio
lets this morning," said the Mayor.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAL.L, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1898.
LAWLOR
BLAMES
THE WAR
The Judge Gives Some Idea of
How and Why His Party
Was Beaten.
Among those who engaged actively. In
telligently and ineffectively In the cam
paign just over perhaps there Is no indi
vidual who contributed more time and
effort than Judge J. P. Lawlor. And If
the Judge is feeling sore he hides it be
hind a genial smile. He was in his office
yesterday, a pleasant gentleman, with
hair prematurely gray and abnormally
disheveled.
"You understand my position," he said.
'"Three parties had appointed a commit
tee of nine. Of this committee I was
named chairman, and while I was a rep
resentative of the Democratic party, the
committee was to act for all and conduct
a comprehensive campaign.
"The result is easily explained. This
election gave the citizens of the United
States the first opportunity they had
since the beginning of the war with Spain
to express their sentiments thereon.
There had been, in the first place,
some internal dissension as to the
propriety of the war itself. Was
it wise or unwise? A question, more se
rious arising from recent disclosures con
cerning the hardships to which our sol
diers were subjected, and a suspicion as
to the competency of the Secretary of
War, threatened to dampen the ardor of
the Republican party. Had it not been
for these disclosures the opposition to the
Republican party would have been almost
obliterated in the recent campaign.
"Apart from this issue, which is re
sponsible for the largeness of the results,
there were minor causes which I believe
helped to make our defeat so positive,
I do not think that fusion has been a
success. In my official position, which
brought me into contact and communi
cation with earnest and patriotic men
of the three parties, and in which I ob
served that our principles were grandly
sustained by some, I also learned in ad
vance of the election that there were a
large number who declined to yield sup
port. This was true as to Democrats and
Populists. The Silver Republicans,
who saw that they must depend upon a
combined force for the integrity of their
cause, did not falter in the fight.
"I have no desire to characterize any
Democrat or Populist who declined to
support the union ticket, but simply make
the point that there were more incorrigi
bles than most people suspected. And it
i may be proper to express the opinion
; that more disgruntled Republicans voted
i for Maguire as a rebuke to the railroad
! machinations than the managers of that
, party are willing to admit.
: "'While the progress of the campaign
| left much to be desired as to the
probable results,, there was still
! enough of a community spirit to furnish
; encouragement and sustain hope. 1 think
that a careful analysis of the vote, were
. that possible, would supply much-needed
I instruction to the combine which seized
the Republican organization at Sacra
mento in August last. Judge Maguire. dur
ing his remarkable canvass of the State
was met on all hands by cordial indorse
ment in many instances from life-long
Republicans and everywhere by condem
nation of the deal the Republican man
agement made with the Southern Pacific
'"nns experience has shown me to a sat
isfying degree that there is a marked lack
erf organization in the two principal par
ties, and loaves little hope that either of
the Democratic o^ Republican party can
improve in that respect as long as the
present conditions continue
"1 attribute this state of helplessness
to the course of the Southern Pacific
which, in the endeavor to conserve its
own selfish interests wherever they hao
pen to lie. does so without fairness or
reference to the public weal. A study of
the change of front in certain newspapers
and of certain men within the fusion
forces during the campaign could furnish
an instruction on this point were any
needed. In short, the great need of Cali
fornia, is (hat citizens, regardless of
party stand together on the proposition
of forcing the railroad out of politics
"We marie a clean fight. We did not ex
pend a dollar above the legitimate needs
of carrying on the work, and no dollar we
did expend was tainted."
The Judge ran his fingers thoughtfully
through his aggressive locks. It seemed
to be the signal that he had finished

W. W. FOOTE AS A
POLITICAL PROPHET
Foretold the Defeat of the
Democratic Party â Some
Home Truths.
There are many Democrats In the
city and State who, no doubt, were
greatly surprised when they learned
that James G. Maguire and practically
the whole Democratic ticket had been
defeated at the polls by an overwhelm
ing majority.
There are still other Democrats who
were not surprised; who had foreseen
and foretold defeat; who, in the days
preceding the Sacramento convention,
fought early and late against the con
ditions certain unscrupulous politicians
had imposed upon the party, and who
gave due and timely warning of the re
sult as recorded in the vote cast at the
election on Tuesday.
These men â the ones who were not
surprised â have for many years been
identified with t^ie Democratic party
and have always taken such an active
part in its affairs that they have earn
ed the right to the hieh regard in
which they are held by men of all
shades of political belief. Now the
election Is over it should be interesting
and instructive to those who followed
Maguire to defeat to look back a few
months and consider what such men as
W. W. Foote, M. F. Tarpey and H. T.
Fortman had to sa 1 ' of the conditions
under which the Democratic party
went into the fight just concluded.
Soon after the select coterie of po
litical adventurers, headed by Chair
man Alford of the Democratic State
Central Committee, Frank Gould, late j
of Stockton, and Gavin McNab, the
one-time "Whispering Boss" and al- '
leged reformer, engineered a trade with j
the Populist party whereby a scheme
of fusion was to be brought about, W.
W. Foote expressed his opinion of their
action in the following words, pub
lished in The Call of August 5, 1898:
"The action of Alford and Gould
and McNab and their associates is
the most high-handed proceeding
that I have ever heard of. It is a
disgrace to the party and an insult
to every self-respecting Democrat in
the State of California." V
A few days later Mr. Foote went to
Sacramento as a delegate to the Demo
cratic State Convention. What he had i
to say there on the pubject of the j
fusion arrangement and the organized j
and successful effort that was made to '
steal the control of the Democratic
party in San Francisco and give it into j
the hands of the men who had com- |
mitted the theft was in the nature of ;
a prophecy. In speaking of the effort j
of certain newspapers to howl down â 
and discredit every one who had a ;
CANVASS DELAYED BY
RANK INCOMPETENCE
BIGGY SCORES METHODo OF THE
ELECTION COMMISSION.
Officers Failed to Make Semi-Official
, Beturns â Results in One Pre
cinct Will Not Be Known
Until Monday.
Â»
Locked and sealed in the Registrar's
vault are the ballots cast In every pre
cinct In Tuesday's election, and a trusted
officer of the police and representatives
of the county committees of both par
ties will watch to see that neither lock
nor seal is tampered with until the
Election Commissioners meet on Monday
to officially canvass the vote.
The returns which appear in this morn
ing's issue of The Call were compiled by
Registrar Blggy's corps of competent
clerks, who have worked unceasingly on
them since returns began to arrive from
the different districts. They are com
plete with the exception of the vote on
the general ticket of the Eleventh Pre
cinct of the Twenty-ninth Assembly
District. The returns of this precinct it
will be impossible to publish until Mon
day, as one of the election officials, in
ignorance of the law, sealed his semi
official returns up with the ballots and
they were locked up with the rest in the
vault. Only by an order of the court
could Mr. Biggy unseal" those ballots, but
he hesitates to even take that measure;
he had rather the Commiissloners them
selves would undo the mistake, and so
will wait until Monday.
The Eleventh of the Twenty-ninth was
not the only precinct that delayed the
semi-official canvass. The Fifteenth of
the Thirty-first, Eleventh of the Thirty
sixth, Thirteenth of the Forty-first and
Third of the Forty-Second did not get
their returns in until yesterday morning,
and then only after a half dozen of Mr.
Biggy's deputies had gone out into the
districts and demanded them.
Although the returns of this year's elec
tion have been more quickly and system
matically canvassed than ever previously
tMe Registrar is not quite satisfied. Mr.
Blggy said yesterday that but for the>
rank ignorance and incompetence of the
election officers who failed to make semi
official returns he would have had his
canvass completed by yesterday noon.
"There is no reason on earth, said Mr.
Biggy, "for this delay. If the Commis
sioners had followed the law and made
thtir appointments from the assessment
roll they would have had men who needed
neither watching nor coaching in their
duties and we would have had the re
turns in the hands of the public this noon.
"As it Is I wish you would announce
that the recapitulation sheets will to-day
be open for inspection at my office, and I
and my deputies will be glad to have any
one who is interested drop in to see
them." ... .
Yesterday was as busy a day with the
Registrar and his deputies as was Tues
day. It was a case of forty-eight hours
without sleep for all of them, but there
was no abatement of the courtesy that
has characterized the working force de
spite a thousand and one things that turn
up to make matters crotchetty.
There were none of those who failed of
election who made complaintâ always ex
cepting Dr. C. C. O'Donnell, who is not
to be Coroner. The disappointed ones
have quietly abided by the returns and
have one and all rendered their thanks to
the Registrar, who has kept them con
stantly informed of progress.
O'Donnell was on hand yesterday, as on
the day before, giving tongue to all sorts
of accusations of Jobbery and frauds up
on him. He claims that he was counted
out and threatened a demand for re-
The election of 1898 has probably been
the cheapest that San Franciscans have
ever paid for.
In 1896 it cost $202,500 to provide the city
with enough officials to run it. Mr. Biggy
announced last night that the $156,500 he
asked for when apportionments were
made, would cover every expense and
probably go a little further.
There may be some little difficulty when
the matter of paying off election officers
comes up before the Commissioners on
Monday. The rule was laid down when
they were appointed that no warrants
would issue until services had been per
formed, but thara were a few favored
word to say In defense of the victims
of the hold-up he said:
"I am not a partisan In this mat
ter. It has got so in California that
if a man undertakes to raise his voice
in defense of what he believes to be
right hÂ« is either whispered to death
or hounded to death by the news
papers."
An attempt was then made by the
programmers to shut off debate and
thus secure the defeat of the effort that
was being made by stalwarts in the
convention to place the party in such
a position that it could go before the
people and make an honest bid for their
support. Mr. Foote combated this at
tempt and on the floor of the conven
tion hall made this prophetic appeal:
"Gentlemen: I appeal to you in the
name of harmony, I appeal to you in
the name of decency, I appeal to you
in the name of right, I appeal to you
iin the name of Demorcacy, do not
! shut off a hearing in this case. If
j you do you drive the knife into the
heart of the Democratic party of the
| State of California. This is the most
important question which has ever
come before a State convention. It
ought to be deliberated on with calm
ness. I have no personal aims to
gratify, no friends to reward or ene
mies to punish, but I do. not like to
see the Democratic party stricken
; down by its own members until they
know all of the facts. And I ask in
all sincerity, because I expect to have
j no more to say upon this question,
! that whatever time may be desired
by both parties to this question may
be taken by this convention. It is a
more important matter even than the
nomination of officers for the next
State election. If you smother this
question you destroy the Democratic
party not only in the city and county
of San Francisco, but you will render
it apathetic all over the State of Cali
fornia, and you will have your ticket
beaten."
A conscientious consideration of Mr.
Foote's ante-election utterances, placed
side by side with the election returns,
will no doubt tend to the enlightenment
of those good Democrats who are at a
lo3S to account for the Republican
landslide that has just wiped out all
traces of the late lamented fusionists.
ones with a pull who were given their pay
in advance. They got urunk on it and
were removed 'by Biggy's deputies, who
substituted new men. The adjustment of
warrants to cover both cases bids fair to
be a matter of some difficulty.
Warrants upon which there is no such
question will be Issued at tne Registrar's
office to-day after the commission has
passed upon them.

A BUSINESS CONTRAST.
TWO years ago the Congressmen from Illinois,
by about one day's work, secured an appropria
tion of $5.c00.000 to tear down and rebuild the
Chicago postoflke. They secured an act of Congress
v. employ special architects, on account of the pres
sure on the force of the architect of the Treasury.
Work in clearing off the immense building that had to
bt removed was begun, and now the foundation is
completed and ready to receive the superstructure.
A statement of the nature of the ground and the
foundation has just been published and is of interest
to San Francisco. The soil is loose mud and sand
for fifteen feet, then three feet of brittle clay, and
then for sixty feet very soft bluish clay mud, with
fiakes of stiffer material and gravel, below that hard
pan. The foundation was made of 5087 piles of Nor
way pine, driven to ultimate resistance, and then cut
off twenty-six feet below street level and twelve feet
below water level of the lake. The job of cutting !
was difficult, for water oozed through the mud, and
a? it could not be kept out the cutting of the piles was
done under water. The building will weigh 150,000
tons, and each pile will have to earn' thirty tons, but
a.; their carrying capacity is 136 tons, the load will be
easily borne.
The promptness with which thi* building is going
up, overcoming a mud and wÂ»ter foundation, is |
highly creditable to the business push of Chicago. It j
is also in sharp contrast to the forlorn delays on the \
San Francisco Postoffice. The ground for the site !
in this city, as will be seen, is immensely superior for '
foundation to that in Chicago. Yet if a pint of water j
is seen in a trench here a howl goes up for a re- i
examination of the foundation, and in certain quar- j
ters every possible impeachment of the location is j
heralded to the world.
As a result of this fiddledeedeeing our appropria
tion sleeps in the treasury and the mechanics and la
borers of this city suffer for the money that should be
expended upon the work.
It is time for San Francisco to wake up, quit im
peaching the very ground she stands on, and to urge j
forward the beginning and hasten the completion of |
this building, which is greatly needed for decent !
quarters for our Federal offices and the convenience ot
the people.
A JUSTIFIABLE BOYCOTT.
ORDINARILY the boycott is a detestable
weapon, yet on the principle of fighting the
devil with fire it may reasonably be employed.
No one will find fault with the marriageable young
ladies of Alameda who have united for the elimination
from social life of a certain bachelors' club, a lot of
men banded in defiance of the Alamedan charmer
and the blandishments of Hymen.
It bachelors choose to meet for a jolly time, to
smoke, even to drink in moderate quantity, there is
no rebuke due. But a combination for the evil pur
pose of evading matrimony verges upon the crim
inal. The young ladies have undertaken a work of
moral as well as social reform. If a bachelor feels
that he cannot, unassisted, resist the inclination to
propose, he has no business to remain in Alameda,
where the temptation is so strong. Let him flee to
the wilderness. It is cowardly for him to collect
ethers of his kind about him. Some of them, if left
alone, might reform and live happily ever after, but
it the companionship of seasoned, hardened, woman
hating sinners, have no chance of leading better lives.
To succeed in their efforts, and fittingly punish the
transgressors, the young ladies must not only break
up the club, but, having brought the penitent mem
bers to their knees, simply promise, in every instance,
to be a sister.
At the Sacramento convention, when the Alameda
County candidate had to give way to Gage, the dele
gation announced that it intended to keep the Repub
lican banner. Alameda County can be depended upon
to abide by its word.
Perhaps the witness-stand will acquire some terror
for Huntington now that Hinton and La Rue are no
longer to doze in their official chairs. The president
of the Southern Pacific simply had fun with them.
Mayor Phelan's public utterances and documents
are received with interest. There will be no excep
tion when the sworn statement of his election ex
penses shall appear.
As to some of the secrets of the School Board, Gal
lagher has permitted the cat to escape the bag. In
ether words, he let her go, just like the original Gal
lagher.
There is enough in a name to have brought about
the defeat of District Attorney Fitzgerald for the po
sition of City and County Attorney.
Editor Hearst has never been reckoned a particu
larly brave man, but he has the courage to sign his
own productions.
Another thing we have reason to feel proud of is
the active dislike of the Paris journals.
WHERE WILL THE ELEMENTS GO?
THE fusion in this. State repelled more than it
attracted. It is safe to say that more Democrats
* repudiated it than rejected Bryan two years ago.
The national Democratic organization stood gallantly
by their sound money guns to the end and did ex
cellent execution. The address of their State Com
mittee was timely and effective. They bide their time.
It may never come. It may be that they are destined
to. the same partisan solitude that the remnant of the
old Federal party sought under the leadership of
j Jo Daviess after the defeat of Adams.
Without the late fusion the Popu st party of Cali
fornia would still be adolescent, with the sap of youth i
ii : it and a capacity for growth. But so many of its ,
I members followed their noses and chased the scent of j
; the flesh-pots that it is mangled beyond recognition, j
! Its last candidate for Governor, Mr. Webster, a citizen j
cf the best repute and standing, and an honest man,
was compelled to repudiate its course in the fusion
and put his "hand and influence to the defeat of its j
j combination with Maguire. Mr. Shanahan, its last j
hope for the life of its organization, when denied a
place on the official ballot, went with Webster. Mr.
! T. V. Cator, practically the organizer of the party in
! California and by far its ablest dialectician and cx
i pounder, turned from its debauchery in a disgust that
has led him to publicly declare his future allegiance
to the Republican party.
The Silver Republicans had so little of substance
and were so shadowy and illusive as an organization
that it is not necessary to discuss them at length.
They consisted of a self-constituted committee and a
disappointed ambition, which they mistook for prin
ciple. They indulged in the idle ceremony of the
laying on of hands on the head of Maguire, and, pre
tending to the apostolic succession in Republicanism,
gave him the chrism as the successor of Lincoln. But j
the profane ceremony deceived none of the true be
lievers in the great emancipator. The few who were
influenced by it have already found their way back
to their old party or are on the way there.
Judge Maguire's declaration that the fight will go
on, meaning thereby the fight for land confiscation,
free silver at 16 to I, and a shower of irredeemable
paper money, is an assurance of what his new Dem
ocracy proposes. Republicans hope that policy will
be followed. If a defeat in 1896 and 1898 has not ;
brayed those principles in the mortar to powder that
is fine enough to be thrown to the winds, the process !
I will be repeated in 1900 so effectively that it will be j
I thereafter unnecessary.
In the present House of Representatives California I
i- represented by three Republicans #id four fiat |
money men. In the next House she will have six :
Republicans and one -fiatist, and will strengthen the 1
sound money side of the Senate by one vote. We in
vite the attention of the country to these gains, and
send hail and greeting to all men, everywhere, who
have not lost faith in the republic and the principles j
en which it is founded.
THE NEXT SENATE.
ONE of the most gratifying results of the elec
tions is the assured return of a sufficient num
ber of Republicans to the United States Senate
to give the party full control of that branch of the
Government. For a long time past the Senate has
been the stumbling-block in the way of sound finan
cial legislation, but the changes now to be made in its
membership will render it a safeguard against any
possible monetary folly on the p^rt of the House.
The change will be indeed a notable one. The
: Democratic party, which but a short time ago
' seemed intrenched in power in the Senate, and from
' that vantage point threatened the nation with a free
! silver bill, is now to be hardly more than a faction
jin the chamber. It is bereft not only of numbers, but
! of leader?, and such Democrats as are there may yet
I be found following Populist guides instead of shaping
! policies for themselves.
Of the great Democratic galaxy that dominated the
Senate during Cleveland's term, Hill, Gorman, Black
burn, Voorhees, Harris and Vilas will be absent from
the Senate that is to be. Some of these are dead;
some are virtually out of politics, and they have left
jno strong successors. Senator White, who might
i have succeeded to the leadership, will also be absent,
i and so will Mills of Texas. Only two strong men of
! the old group remain â Morgan and Yest â and they
are too old and too weak from ill health to lead with
any vigor or efficiency.
From the present outlook there will be but twenty
eight Democrats in the Senate. Among these are some
eld war-horses like Cockrell, Turpie and Daniel, but
these are more given to making long-winded speeches
than anything else, and genuine leadership is not in
them. There remains for the Democrats of the Sen
ate, therefore, no apparent leader unless they choose
to follow the wild and bellowing Tillman of South
Carolina. If they refuse his control they will be
either a leaderless faction or else convert themselves
into a following for a silverite like Teller, or a Popu
list like Allen.
This plentiful lack of brains among the Democrats
o f the coming Senate is likely to have a marked effect
| upon the course of politics. It will enable the vigor
ous siiverites and Populists such as Teller, Allen,
Mantle and Cannon, to take the lead in opposition to
the Republican majority, and compel Democracy to
accept a subordinate place. Fusion, it is clear, is
coming home to roost. Hungry Democracy, in its
greed to devour Populism, is in danger of being swal
lowed itself.
The country, however, will give but little heed to
the predicament of the small Democratic faction.
Interest in the Senate will center in the strong and
ably led Republican majority that will control it.
Once more the highest council of the nation has be
come the stronghold of its conservative wisdom and
! constructive statesmanship. The victory of the year
: will be far-reaching and long lasting. Before the
Senate can be changed again all the financial problems
| of the country will be settled, and its money and cur
rency of all kinds established permanently on the
sound basis of gold.
RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION.
RECENTLY published statistics show that up to
the first day of October nearly 2200 miles of
railroad had been laid in the United States
during the year, and enough work is now under way,
it is said, to justify the belief that the total construc
tion for the whole year will exceed 3000 miles.
While this mileage is below the accomplishments
of some of the great railroad building years of the
past, it is a marked advance over anything attained
since the panic of 1893. In no year between 1893 and
the present year did the construction of new roads
equal 2000 miles. It will be seen, therefore, that the
revival of prosperity has already attained good head
way in railway enterprises as well as in other lines of
industry*.
It is to be noted that the figures given refer only
to railways to be traversed by steam locomotives, and
do not include any of the numerous electric lines
which in the more thickly populated sections of the
country are now radiating from the cities and ex
tending farther and farther into the suburbs. Some
of these electric lines in the East are of sufficient

length and do a sufficient business to be counted as
more than mere street railways. If such lines as these
had been included in the report the showing for our
railroad enterprises would have been far better even
than it is.
Railway construction affords a fairly accurate
gauge of business conditions in this country. The
work demands all kinds of material from cross-ties
to equipments for palace cars, and nearly all classes
of people are benefited in their trade. The record of
increased construction is therefore doubly gratifying
as an evidence of the increased prosperity of both
labor and capital.
MR. PriELAN'S "VICTORY."
IT is usually easy to discern in the results of elec
tions the popular logic which determines them.
Underlying the selection of candidates there is
always some principle, some prejudice or sane idea
which, the moment the figures are subjected to analy
sis, yields a reason of some kind by which the result
I may be explained. For instance, Dr. Hill, who has
been elected Coroner, was the only candidate who
smashed the slate of the Committee of One Hundred.
Assessor Siebe, an unsuccessful Republican nominee,
was defeated because he has held the place too long.
The people evidently thought eight years with the
emoluments of the Assessor's 'office was sufficient for
one man.
But for what possible reason was James D. Phelan
re-elected Mayor? The people repudiated his entire
ticket, with a few insignificant exceptions, and yet
placed him at the head of the government again by a
majority which, like Mercutio's wound, though not
as wide as a church door nor as deep as a well, still
is sufficient. In other words, Mayor Phelan's po
litical methods, his candidates, his principles and his
faction, have all been buried under a mass of dis
approving ballots, but he has himself been re-elected.
This result is an anomaly in politics. Generally the
first man to feel the wrath of those whose political
sentiments he has outraged is the leader or boss.
But in the Mayor' ;i case Democratic anger has been
visited upon the creatures alone.
Mr. Phelan, with singular felicity, attributes the de
feat of his party to a desire on the part of the people
to support President McKinley's administration; but,
with characteristic conceit, he intimates that they j
took care of him on the ground that he has made j
an excellent Mayor and that the public weal demanded j
| his indorsement. In the hour of his trial perhaps no
one will grudge Mr. Phelan the privilege of laying
this flattering unction to his soul, but we may be par- j
â  doned for expressing in type a genial smile for the j
1 gayety with which he assumes that the public is un- i
able to penetrate the thin veil which conceals from
them the desperation of his logic.
Apparently there is no sense in the re-election of
Mayor Phelan. The same influences which over
whelmed Maguire and the other fusionists in city and I
State were arrayed against him. He was, in fact, per- |
sonally the cause of the major portion of Democratic j
dissatisfaction, and while his demagogy was more j
genteel than that of many of his colleagues, it was
none the less offensive to the masses of the people. ;
To defeat the entire Phelan-Maguire combine in State
and city and re-elect Phelan, the chief conspirator
against popular liberty, seems to us decidedly illogical.
There must, therefore, be some other reason for his
"great victory."
It has been said that success is sometimes accom
panied by more pain than defeat, and we know of in
stances where the people have elected men to office ;
for the purpose of punishing them. Can it be pos- |
sible that Phelan has been chosen in order that his j
last days in politics may be as miserable as possibly? j
What can he do, surrounded by Republican Super- j
visors and Republican officials, except to writhe and j
kick and chew soap? All his political movements |
will be met with counter movements; his vetoes will -
be turned against him; his public utterances will be
criticized and used to discomfit him; his late party
friends will envy him and detract from the merit of
his acts; in short, the final year of his political
career will, by the politicians of his own as well as #
the opposition party, be made a horrid nightmare.
We are inclined to think, however, that if this is the
purpose of the people they are inflicting cruel and
unusual punishment. They should have retired Mr.
Phelan with the rest. Political cruelty should not be I
refined in this way. It is barbarous.
ANNUAL expositions held by the Mechanics'
Institute in this city have served at this sea
son of the year to direct public attention to
our home products and to reawaken in the minds of
the people a sense of their extent and the importance
of upbuilding them. This year there has been no
Mechanics' Fair, and will be none. Whatever stim
ulus is to be given toward the promotion of home
industries must come from other sources. It is,
therefore, gratifying to note that there will be an ex
position of home products at Oakland, and that it will
be made as comprehensive and complete as pos
sible.
The importance of a liberal patronage of home
products in the home market has long been recog
nized by all intelligent students of our industrial and
commercial system. It is known that we import into
California large quantities of manufactured goods
when articles of the same class and of equally good or
better quality made in California are ignored in the
local market and have to seek consumers in the East
or in foreign countries. By this practice there is a
loss to both the producer and the consumer, and a
double drain of waste 13 made upon the revenues of
the people.
There are good reasons for believing that a better
condition of things will prevail among us at no very
distant date. Strong associations are working for the
reform. The State Board of Trade, the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, the Chamber of
Commerce and the Merchants' Association of San
Francisco and similar bodies in other communities
have been engaged for some time past in an earnest
campaign of education on the subject. Throughout
the State the press has lent its aid to the work, and
there can be no question but what a great deal has
been done to make the home market more profitable
to home industries than it has been heretofore.
The creation of public sentiment in favor of
home products will not be sufficient, however, to ac
complish all that is desired. Sentiment affects busi
ness to a large extent, but it does not control it. Un
less the producers make known the nature and quality
of their products it will be in vain that the people
are appealed to to purchase them.
The Oakland exposition affords a good oppor
tunity for an exposition of home industries, and it is
to be hoped our producers generally will avail them
selves of U. The time has come for us to begin pre
parations for our State exposition at Paris, and all
local fairs held at this time serve as rehearsals for the
great display to be made before all the world. Every
effort, therefore, should be made to render these fairs
as brilliant and as instructive as possible. When prop
erly conducted, made use of and patronized, they will
be most potent aids in bringing about the much de
sired result of making California the best market in
the world for the products of her people. i

THE WORKERS
Deputies' Places Are
Mostly Filled.
HARLOW LIKE THE BROOK
ROGERS HAS MANY FAT VACAN
CIES TO DISPOSE OF.
In Several of the Offices With Prin
cipals Re-elected There Will Be
No Changes in the
Staffs.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 10.
Already the candidates-elect for county
offices have given Indications of how the
patronage of their offices will be distrib
uted.
Some time ago at the San Leandro con
vention The Call stated how many of the
deputyships would be filled, and recent
developments prove the correctness of
that information.
Under District Attorney J. J. Allen his
chief deputy will be H. A. Melvin. who
has been in the office for four years; At
torney Phil 11 Walsh will be another
deputy; George Samuels, who nominated
Judge Allen in the convention, another,
while It is said that Abe Leach and T. \V.
Harris of Pleasanton will complete the
list. In the Auditor's office J. Cal Ewing
has signified his intention of appointing
J. J. Hannilln Jr. as his chief deputy, and
James B. Dean an assistant.
Mortimer Smith and J. W. Stetson, who
have been elected City Justices, will be
Police Judge and Justice respectively, the
choice being reposed in the Mayor. The
Police Judge will have to appoint a clerk
of his court and an official stenographer.
When Oscar L. Rogers assumes the
duties of the Sheriff he will have to ap
point an Under Sheriff, two jailers, four
bailiffs of the Superior Court and a host
of other deputies. W. S. Harlow, who
has been Under Sheriff for twenty-three
years, does not expect to be succeeded by
a. Bt ranger.
The other deputyships will be scattered
all over the county. Louis Schoneau of
Alameda, George Taylor of Livermore,
[Jeorge Wales of Newark and Sam Heller,
who was a candidate for Sheriff but re
signed in favor of Rogers, are also declar
ing they have the inside track to the
Sheriff's office.
Assessor Dalton will make no changes
In his office, and it is said that County
L'lerk Jordan will also retain all his pres
ent deputies, although he will have to ap
point a chief deputy to Bucceed Auditor-
L-lect Cal Ewing.
The re-election of Messrs. Church and
ralcott for Supervisors guarantees a
continuation of the terms of office of the
lounty employes.
Recorder-elect Grim requires two dep
.ltles, and he will undoubtedly take one
jl them from the street railroad men,
ivho organized for the sole purpose of
electing their old superintendent.
Coroner-elect Mehrmann has some
ieputies to appoint throughout the coun
ty. Deputy Quellin will probably not be
listurbed, as he has done good service,
rhe morgue will remain at Albert
Brown's establishment.
The township offices have been filled as
follows:
Eden Township â Justices of the Peace,
Pimental (fusion), Quinn (fusion): Con
stables, Gallett (fusion) , Ramage (R.).
Washington Township â Justices of the
Peace, Richmond (fusion), Sandholdt
!R.); Constables, Vanderwoort (R.), Tre

PLANTING FOOD FISH.
Many Big Mouth Black Bass Put
in Public Waters.
Tn the fall of 1595 the California Fish
Commissioners brourfit from the East
1000 big mouth black bees fry, which were
placed at the hatchery at Slssons to at
tain sufficient growth to battle for them
selves In the streams of California. The
first distribution of those fish in the pub
lic waters Is now taking place.
A few days ago 100 two-year-old fish
were pat Into the Russian River, near
Duncans Mills. One hundred more were
placed in the San Joaqnin River near
Tracy and 250 in the same stream in
Fresno County. Yesterday Lake Merced
received 100 fish, and 50 were put into
Tule River in Tulare County. To-day 400
flsh will be shipped to the San Joaquin
River to be placed in the water near the
mouths of the Stanislaus and Mokolumne
Rivers.
The big mouth black bass are specially
adapted to warm waters and they grow
to be much larger than the sm;)ll" mouth
variety, now common In many of the
streams of the State. The Commissioners
believe they will flourish in the water of
the San Joaquin River and its many tri
butaries and sloughs that branch far out
from it into all 01 the surrounding coun
try. There is no doubt that in a few
years these streams will be filled with fine
food and game fish. The Commissioners
make the urgent request that anglers in
any of the streams mentioned, and espec
ially In the Russian River, will refrain
from taking any big mouth black bass for
a few years until the fish have a chance
to increase. Every fish returned to the
water will mean plenty of sport in the
futurp. The big mouth black bass Is easy
to distinguish from any of the other of
the finny tribe.
It is larger than the small mouth vari
ety and the size of the mouth is a most
distinguishing feature. 'It is also of a
much brighter silvery color.
HARRY MURRAY'S DISCOVERY.
A Four-Inch Shell Found at the Late
Residence of Mrs. Shields.
Harry Murray, a paperhanger residing
at 1 Ewer place, made a peculiar find
while engaged in papering the residence
lately occupied by Mrs. Shields at 201 Vir*
ginia avenueâ the place it is alleged the
woman attempted to burn on the night
of September 26 last, and for which she Is
now awaiting trial on the charge of arson.
While clearing away some rubbish in a
kitchen on the lower floor, Murray dis
covered a four-inch shell under some
shelving. The death dealing missile was
covered by a lot of old rags and paper.
Murray removed the shell and took it
to his home.
Had the house been burned down, as
Mrs. Shields Intended, this shell would un
doubtedly have exploded and in doing so
would, in all probability, have brought
death to one or more persons engaged in
extinguishing the fire. Whether Mrs.
Shields knew of the shell being in the
kitchen closet or not is a question not
likely to be discovered soon. At all
events Harry Murray has brought it to
his home as' a souvenir of Mrs. Shields'
late residence.
Seeks a New Trial.
Carlotta Quackenbush, who claims to be
the widow of the late Thomas Quacken
bush, filed two affidavits yesterday in the
Superior Court in support of her motion
for a new trial. In her affidavit Mrs.
Quackenbush avers that she was greatly
handicapped during the last trial in being
financially unable to get witnesses she
required. Since that time she has com
pleted her case and asks another hearing.
Simon Levy, who at one time resided in
the same house occupied by the Quaeken
bushee, made affidavit that he recollected
that Quackenbush recognized the plain
tiff as his wife and lived with her as her
husband.

WHY MAGUIRE WAS DEFEATED"
From the Sacramento Bee.
The campalgrn Is over. Defeat has been the portion of James G. Ma
guire, as the Bee was afraid It would be; as It warned his managers would
be the fate of their candidate if they persisted In .heir idiotic plan of cam
paign.
Let us review the events of the past two months and see what tale
they tell: Had the election taken place early in September James G. Ma
gulre would have been elec by 20,000 to 30,000 majority. The people were
with him. He was probably the strongest, man with the masses who could
have been named. He had been manly, outspoken, broad and decided In
his views. He had made a splendid Impression wherever he went, where
as Gagre had been a chill and a frost. Republican politicians did not hesi
tate to declare that Gage was doomed unless something should happen to
turn the tide. And that something did happen. "With victory easily in their
grasp, and evidently at the dictation of the San Francisco Examiner, the
Board of Strategy conducting the Magulre fight mapped out an idiotic plan
of campaign which drove votes from that candidate from its very incep
tion. They narrowed the issues down to only one â It was the San Fran
cisco Examiner on one hand and C. P. Huntington on the other. That was
not the way the Board of Strategy put It, but that most undeniably was the
way in which the people viewed it. And that idea grew with its growth
and strengthened with its strength when it became noticeable that James
G. Maguire, the champion of the masses on many a vital issue, had only
one subject to speak about â the railroad. It extended into a conviction on
the part of the people when the Examiner day in and day out threw col
umns of written and pictorial billingsgate at all who were not for Maguire,
and denounced them as railroad hirelings and numerous other choice pet
names from the Examiner vocabulary. The conviction became stamped as
an absolute certainty when Maguire was rushed through Northern Califor
nia on an Examiner special train as the Examiner candidate for Governor.
The issue vhich had been idiotically worked up by Magulre's own
campaign committee and was at last brazenly thrust down the throats of
the people by the Examiner was accepted by the voters.
They too^k tho bit in their teeth and repudiated the Examiner, although
that carried with it the defeat of Maguire.
Whether it has resulteu in a victory for C. P. Huntington can better
be answered after the citizens have had a good opportunity to Judge the ad
ministration of Henry T. Gage.

TRADE IN THE FARMING STATES.
IT IS BETTER THERE THAN IN THE
MANUFACTURING SECTIONS.
The circular of Henry Clews, under data of
New York. November 6. says: "Outside of
pniltical Influences the conditions bearing upon
the investment and speculative Interests are
very generally hopeful. Representations from
the West are especially so. Merchants hero
from that section ueem to have caught a boom
ing ton* and are full of hopeful expectations.
Tha Industries of that section seem to be In
Â«. much more prosperous state than those of
fiwÂ» Eastern and Middle States, the tendency
apparently being to produce at home more of
art les which have hitherto been supplied from
the manufacturing sections. The ease of money
In the agricultural States is something re
markable for this season of the year. At some
of the centers the rate of interest is even lower
than at New York. This Is in a large measure
attributable to the unusual amount of money
that has been dlntributed through the Importa
tions of gold and to the expansion of the bank
circulation attendant on the Issues Of bonds in
connection with the war loan. Equally, per
haps the ease is a consequence of the large
liquidations of farm mortgages from theâ¢pro
ceeds of the liberal yields and higher prices for
grain derived from the crops of last year and
this; the result of which la to swell the die
balances of the banks and produce a flush
condition in financial circles. This position of
affairs at the West Is likely to cause an Im
portant increase, hence forth, In the deposits
of the interior banks with their agents in this
city; and it would not be surprising if the con
sequences should appear In an extraordinary
expansion of the New York reserves and very
low rates of interest during the winter months.
"It is nuite likely that between now and
January l'some 20.000,000 busnels of wheat may
be shipped to Europe; and a large portion of
the proceeds may under the Western condi
tions above specified, be expected to remain in
this city on balance. It would Beem probable
that the extraordinary outflow of wheat has
reaHied its climax. Last week's export orders
fchow a marked falling off. That may be in
some measure due to the very high rates for
ocean freight incident to the current heavy
export movement: but, at the same time, the
recent large additions to European stocks are
calculated to check the export demand until
the farmers have made some concession from
the recently advanced prices."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Not. 10.â Prices surged upward
on the stock exchange to-day with what can
only be adequately described as a rush and a
roar. It was a day of furious actlvltv through
out In all departments and the closing was at
boiling point and at the best prices of the
day. The greatest Interest and activity was
shown In the railroad securities of all classes
and nearly all of those which were traded In
show at least 1 per cent higher for the stock.
The majority show gains of between 1 and 2
per cent.
This rate of Increase raised to between 2 and
8 per cent in the case of Atchlson preferred.
Rock Island, Baltimore and Ohio, Denver and
Rio Grande preferred. Union Pacific preferred,
St. Paul and Omaha, C. C, C. & St. L. and
some of the specialties. The Oregon Naviga
tion stocks, both common and preferred, show
gains of 4 per cent. The Industrials and other
specialties fell Into the background, both rela
tively and absolutely, and were almost totally
neglected until the later dealings. Sugar!
Brooklyn Transit and Illinois Steel stocks then
sprang into activity and scored substantial ad
vances near the close. In the case of some
stocks high record prices were made to-day and
In the case of many others the high price of
the year was approximated. Atchison prefer
red. Northern Pacific and Union Pacific stocks
reached their record prices to-day. There can
be no doubt that the strength of the market
is attributed to the feeling of relief that the
unsettling doubts and uncertainties over the
Election are a thing of the past and the confi
dence that the generally prosperous condition
of the country is sure to assert itself and lift
prices to a higher level. There wai a spirit of
abounding optimism abroad and everything
was ignored but the most favorable Incidents
In the outlook. The marked falling off in the
export demand for wheat and the resulting fall
In prices had no effect. The unfavorable con
ditions of the trunk line situation which
caused declines for New York Central and
Pennsylvania in London received no attention
and the prices of those stocks were advanced
over a point. B. & O. rose 2% and Norfolk
and Western preferred was at one time up 3%.
Reports from the iron trade of a drift toward
a lower range of values, which might ordin
arily be expected to have a marked effect on
the stock market, were passed unnoticed. St.
Paul's first week's statement, although it show
ed an Increase of over $21,000, was much less
striking than some of that road's recent re
turns which have passed unnoticed, yet there
was an eager demand for all the grangers,
which made the group the leaders of the mar
ket In point of activity. The Atchlson securi
ties held foremost place and all of them ad
vanced strongly, the preferred rising 2% per
cent with a stock issue of over $120,000,000 to
move. Northern Pacific preferred more than
redeemed Its quarterly dividend and Union Pa
cific preferred was heavily bought, both for
home and foreign accounts. London buying
was again a marked feature, and commission
house business was on an enormous scale, fair
ly taking away the market from the hands of
the traders, and eating up all offerings to take
profits without appreciable check to the day's
continued advance.
The day's business in bonds holds the record
In the volume of transactions. All classes of
mortgages were in demand but the reorganiza
tion issues continued the favorites. There was.
however, a generally-distributed business in high
grade bonds and many speculative Issues were
Brought forward In the movement. Total sales
$10,045,000.
United States new 4s registered advanced %;
flo coupons % and the 2s and 3s registered >4
Â»nd the old 4s registered and the Cs registered
% in the bid price.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK, Nov. 10.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram says: The stock markets
here opened quiet but steady to firm on Pre
miÂ°' - Salisbury's speech last night, which was
well liked. The markets Improved as the day
went on and, led by strong buying from the
Continent, all the markets developed great
strength.
This strength was most conspicuous In Amer- ]
leans, which. In addition to the New York sup
port, were bought largely by German division
and house cliques on a general stock exchange
tip to buy Americans on the Republican vic
tory with the possibility that attention will
now be given to the currency question. Prices
closed at the top. Grand Trunk was strong on
good traffic reports. The boom in copper shares
continues.
There is a stronger tone In the money market
here and the market had to borrow from the
bank this afternoon at 4 per cent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 10.â Wheat started weak.
Opening transactions were at 66V4@66>4c, com
pared with yesterday's closing price of 6*>%Â©
66% c, and a further slight decline soon oc
curred, several small lots changing hands at
6CV)iC. The trade was under the influence of
Liverpool. That market was quoted %d lower
and advices from there attributed most of the
decline to the peaceful tone of Lord Salisbury's
speech last night. Traders there had been ex
pecting something entirely different, and with
the strain relieved prices naturally dropped.
New York reported a small demand from for
eigners for American wheat, but this was
looked for, It being known that with no Eu
ropean cloud above the buying on that side
wuuld be confined to current wants. Up to
11:30 o'clock the trading was excessively dull.
There was some buying against puts, and this
and more of the valuable seaboard advices as
to the foreign demand eustained prices. Cables
announcing closing quotations abroad, how
ever, knocked the pinning from under the mar
ket and the prices dropped in a hurry. A 50
centime decline in American wheat at Antwerp,
equivalent to 2'yic per bushel, started free sell
ing, the price of May tumbling to 65% c before
It was discovered that the reported Antwerp
decline was an error. The market stiffened
up a trifle after that, but soon weakened again
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1898.
and remained so until the close. Kansas City
reported a sale of 100,000 bushels of wheat 5%c
below the Chicago price, said to be a greater
discount than has previously ruled ' this sea
son, and knocked the enthusiasm out of buy
ers. December lost l@l%c.
Corn was dull and lower. Receipts â  were
heavy, notwithstanding bad weather, and cables
were lower. The trade had also in mind the
Government report due to-night, expected to be
bearish. There was considerable liquidation by
scattered . longs and prices ruled lower from
the start. . Receipts were 764 1 cars. Seaboard*
demand was good. May lost %@%c
Oats followed I wheat and corn and ruled
slightly lower. â¢ There was a moderately large
business done. Liquidation by a prominent lo
cal trader was a feature. Cash demand was
very poor. : Receipts were SO2 cars. May closed
a shade lower. . -"- â â¢> --.â â¢ - '
During most of the session provisions were
dull and weak, starting steady with an im
proved hog market. Prices weakened rapidly
under selling by. packers. January pork was
unchanged, January lard unchanged and- Janu
ary ribs a shade lower at $4 67%.

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The announcement of an advance
of Vie per pound In the price of California Mus
catel raisins, which was made by the Cali
fornia Raisin Growers' Association on Satur
day last, applying to all shipments after that
date, has caused a much better feeling In the
spot market, though it has led Ito no actual
advance In price here and seems to have
checked the demand. The spot market Is said
to be more poorly supplied than usual at this
season, not only with layers and clusters, but
with ordinary loose goods, and while arrivals
are freer now than for some weeks past most
of the goods received are understood to be go
ing directly into consumption on orders placed
some time since. Old fruit that had been held
here in Icehouse has, we are Informed, been
pretty much absorbed by seeders. On seeded
goods a demand for several weeks past has
been active and local seeders have been com
pelled to work day and night to keep up with
their orders and are still behind with deliveries.
More confidence in the ability of the Raisin
Growers' Asfociatlon to maintain prices Is ex
pressed by Eastern handlers of this fruit, par
ticularly in view of the fact that the output
of standard raisins seems to be turning out
less than was expected.

INSPECTORS SAY
POINTED THINGS
ABOUT BOILERS
Result of the Mary
Garratt Inquiry.
THE CHARGES ARE DISMISSED
AN ADDITIONAL INCENSED EN
GINEER MUST BE PROVIDED.
Effect of Cold Salt Watar When
Pumped Into the Feed â Re
ceives Official Investi
gation.
The T'rJted States Inspectors of Local
and Foreign Steam Vessels have complet
ed the Investigation into the charges
made hy H. J. Corcoran ag-ainst Chief
Engine* :r P. W. Patterson and Assistant
Engineer F. Huber of the steamer Mary
Garratt. the property of the California
Navigation and Improvement Company.
Mr. Corcoran Is the manager of that com
pany.
Mr. Corcoran charged the accused with
having been guilty of carelessness, negli
gence and inefficiency during the period
from September 10 to October 11. In that
they pumped cold Bait water into the boil
ers of the steamer, that they left the fur
nace doors open to prevent the steam
pressure from rising while the boat was
at the landings, and that they did not
keep the bridge walls clean, thereby caus
ing the boilers to leak In their girth
fams. The Inspectors' report states
that the witnesses proved that thÂ© boilers
were leaky and that the top of the bridge
wails was covered with about three Inches
ot debris.
Huber and Patterson denied that they
pumped cold salt water into the boilers and
Insisted that the water was warm. This
they pumped Into the feed in small quan
tities just prior to blowing down the boil
ers for the purpose of removing*the scale.
The testimony further shows that while
J. J. Holland was chief engineer last April
the regular feed pump broke down
through a defect in the steam chest. This
was reported to Mr. Corcoran, who, not
withstanding, allowed the steamer to
make two round trips to San Francisco
while repairs were being made. This ne
cessitated the use of the deck pump in
ping the- cold feed water into the boil
t-rs during that time.
The Inspectors say this was certainly
not beneficial to the boilers, carrying, as
they do, 170 pounds of steam, though Hol
land testified that they did not leak at
that time. The accused deny opening the
furnace doorÃ.
â 'In our judgment," the Inspectors went
on to say, "the testimony does not sustain
Narges, which are therefore dls
: I. We agree with Manager Cor
r...rriii that the engineer on watch should
visit the boilers of the steamer. The boil
ers of the Mary Garratt, however, are at
least 100 feet distant from the engine
room, hence during such watch, in order
to perform the necessary duty of looking
after the boilers the engineer must absent
himself several times from his engine
Ing it in charge of an unlicensed
man, there being but one engineer in each
watch.
"We do not incline to oppress steamboat
owners, but with the foregoing in mind
lleve it our duty in the interest of
the inspection .^rvice and for the safety
pi Mr. on board to require an additional
ifjineer to be carried on tho
garratt und all other steamers of

THROWN FROM HIS BTJGGY.
Van lioben-Sels, Consul General for
the Netherlands, Meets With
a Slight Accident.
P. J. Van Loben Sels, Consul General in
this city for the Netherlands and Para
guay, met with a slight accident yester
day morning while driving in a buggy to
Sacramento. He was accompanied by the
superintendent of his ranch, which is
situated several miles this side of that
place, when suddenly some part of the
harness gave way and the horses became
unmanageable. They roared on thPir
haunches, and the impact against the
buggy threw Mr. Sels out. He was as
sisted back intd the vehicle by his com
panion, and after patching up the harness
they continued their ride to Sacramento.
It was first thought that one of ivir.
Sels' ribs had been fractured, but on ex
amination it was found that such was not
the case. He sustained a few minor
bruises, which will confine hini tn ias
room for two or three days. He took the

People's Mutual Telephone Company
Before the Supervisors' Com
mittee Yesterday.
The committee on streets of the Board
of Supervisors met yesterday morning
and considered a number of important |
matters. The question of granting an ex- .
tension of one year's time to the People's '
Mutual Telephone Company in which to
expend $100,000 in betterments, as provided
In the franchise, -was disposed of by re
quiring the company to file a written
guarantee in the office of the Supervisors'
clerk that there would be no more poles j
erected within the fire limits than are ab
solutely necessary for the conduct of the
business. Afterward the committee on !
streets will favorably consider the appli- ;
cation for one year's extension.
Park Superintendent McLaren, Park
Commissioner Zeile and King of the Mer- j
chants' Association appeared before the i
committee to urge that street sweepings \
be henceforth given to Golden Gate Park, j
The proposal was well received and the ,
Merchants' Association will be asked to ;
g-ive the committee some pxact figures a?
tQ the cost of taking the sweepings to the
park and all other desirable data.
It was decided to present a resolution i
at the meeting of the board next Monday !
providing that the bitumen pavements !
should not be sprinkled with carts, but
should be thoroughly washed each night
by the flushing system. It has been
shown by trial in Eastern cities that
flushing is the best way of cleaning j
asphalt surfaces, and the committee ber I
lieves that bitumen should be treated in
the same way. _ ..
The question of granting the Southern
Pacific Railroad the right of way for a
| double track through the city to Fourth
and Townsend streets was on the calen
dar ff f >r consideration, but was not
i brought -up for some reason. It will be
I rt-collected that this matter was before
the committee several weeks ago and that
the property owners in the Mission dis
trict filed a strong protest, which was pre
: sf-uted by a large delegation of the citf
1 zens They claim that the Southern Pa-
I cine' is a trespasser now, that it built
its one track on the plea that the same
was only temporary and had sineÂ© re
fused to vacate.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1898.
AN ORANG-OUTANG'S ROMANCE.
JOE, the orang-outang, and SaliiÂ©, the
chimpanzee, are successfully passing
through the throes of their very first
romance and the management out at the
Chutes is on the alert, carefully noting all
the details, which they will forward to
the great naturalist. Professor Garner.
It's "Love's young dream" in very truth,
for Sallle has Just turned one blissful
summer and Joe has endured existence
for a brief twenty months. Thus far this
remarkable courtship is up to the accept
ed human standard. The maid is coy and
tender, the lad vain and domineering,
- < â  â  rnr> wild man from the wild
est coast of Africa, supplies the necessary
rival to disturb the monotonous calm of a
love that cannot be true II It run smooth
ly. ... Â ;â  . . - â  . â â â â â :â â 
There is nothing prepossessing or fas
cinating about Congo, who, by the way,
the Chutes managers declare, is the much
sought for "missing link." But Congo
wiars not with unbecoming: grace the
regulation male attire, and Congo sports
a beard, two stubborn facts that all admit
are- fatal to the regular pulsation of the
feminine cardiac.
When Sallie tlrst met Congo she put up
her rosy razor lips and pressed them to
the luscious red border that protects the
wild man from Africa's teeth; then she
sighed, turned her back on Joe and gazed
in mute admiration at Congo's high intel
lectual brow and sleepy though eloquent
orbs. After this Joe courted the fair onÂ©
in vain. She spurned the food he so dain
tily "spooned" up for her. She refused to
drink from his glass. She began to de
velop a coquettish love of her one and
only gown â an esthetic thing of salmon
LAST VOYAGE
OF THE BELGIC
TO THIS PORT
Will Now Be Returned
to Her Owners.
MILLION DOLLARS IN SKINS
VALUE OF THE BARKENTTNE
BEHRING'S BIG CARGO.
American Murdered in Korea â Ship
Baring Bros. Raised â General
Merriam Visits the Italian
Cruiser.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Honolulu and the Ori
ental and Occidental Company's Belgic,
from Hongkong, via Yokohama and Hon
olulu, Wednesday night and yesterday
morning. They left Honolulu within a
few hours of each other and arrived here
about the same time apart. The Australia
brought up seventy-four cabin and fifty
five steerage passengers, and the Belgic
brought forty-eight cabin, twelve Euro
pean, one Chinese and three Japanese,
second cabin, and forty-three Japanese
and 294 Chinese in the steerage. This ia
the Keltic's last run on the Hongkong
route. Now that the Oriental and Occi
dental, Pacific Mail and the Japanese
line are to run three steamers each there
is nothing for the Belgic to do, bo she
will be returned to the White Star line,
her owners. The officers are glad, as a
rul>. that she' is going- back, but Captain
Kinder does not like the change, as his
home is here.
The Australia and Belgic were delayed
a few hours by northeast gales, a head
sea and high northeast swell.
The Belgic brings the particulars of the
murder of an American named George
Lake in Korea. The deceased kept a
store at Chemulpo and was a great favor
ite with everybody* He lived alone and
some one stole into the house while he
slept and drove a knife into his brain.
The murderer was not caught and the
matter was being investigated by Deputy
United States Consul General J. C. Sanda
when the steamer sailed.
The American ship Baring Brothers,
which caught fire and was sunk in Kobe
Harbor on August 12 last, has been raised
again. The wreck and cargo were sold
for a song and the purchaser is goingto
make a small fortune out of them. Be
sides the hwll there are 400 baits of rags
and 750 tons of manganese ore in the hold.
Three attempts were made to raise the
vessel. The first failed because the pon
â  were not large enough, a storm
ed the second and the third suc
boys in blue at Manila are not to
rt of fresh meat. The Belgic brings
that the British steamers Urmston
c and Duke of Sutherland have ar
rived there from Brisbane, Australia,
with 3100 tons of frozen meat for the
army.
Major General Merriam, accompanied
by his aid. First Lieutenant John B. Ben
nett, Seventh United States Infantry, for
mally returned yesterday the call mads
Wednesday by Captain Giovani Giorello,
of the Italian cruiser Etna, General Mer
riam and Lieutenant Bennett left de
partment headquarters about 9 o'clock in
the morning. The two officers wore their
full dress uniform and side arms. They
went out to the Etna on the Government
steamer McDowell and were received by
the officers of the crv'ser with full cere
monies. General Merriam and his aid
were invited into the captain's cabin,
where they spent a short time in con
versing with Captain Giorello. When the
general left the Etna he was given a
salute of fifteen guns. Captain Giorello
and the wardroom officers of the Etna
have been extended the courtesy of the
Bohemian Club.
The torpedo-boat destroyer Farragut
was out on her official trial trip yester
day. It is not known for certain whether
sh<; has come up to the Government re
quirements or not, but the general impres
sion is that she has. In shallow water
she made a poor showing but in twenty
fathoms she made much better than thir
ty knots.
The Russian' barkenttne Behring arrived
from Petropaulovski yesterday with a
fortune in skins aboard. She brings the
season's catch of the Russian Sealskin
sealskins and 110 packages of bearskins;
cambric with soulful pale green trim
mings, and would fling herself like a petu
lant child all in a heap upon the floor
when any one attempted to take her from
the wild man's strong brown arms.
Joe's undoing robbed him of his usual
vivacity and ci'en for a while his life was
despaired of, when, like a good fairy,
civilization took a hand in his romance.
Congo and Sallie and Joe came to town.
Congo saw other members of the weaker
sex and without any preparation for the
shock he must have known he was about
to inflict the missing link neglected Sallie.
Joe, lucky Joe, took advantage of Congo's
desertion. He gave Sallie all his fruit, his
largest, whitest grains of rice, and finally
one bright morning took advantage of the
chimpanzee's unusual affection to seal
their betrothal with a rubbing of lips.
Congo, however, is not at all disturbed
by the turn matters have taken. He
flirts desperately with all the ladies who
visit him, andâ vain beauty that he is â
now and then gazes toward Sallie with a
look that plainly says "I could still win
you if I would.

GRAND JURY
PROBING INTO
SCHOOL BILLS
Gross Extravagance Is
Charged.
INDICTMENTS ARE EXPECTED
BARRINGTON AND WALLER ARE
A MISTED.
Registrar Biggy to Be Complimented
for Efficiency in a Special ''â , f
Report From That
August Body.
The Grand Jury met last .evening to
consider election cases and to probe into
the financial affairs of the School Board.
Subpoenas had been issued for Presi- |
dent Barrington of the Board of Bduca-'j
tion, Chairman Waller of the finance com- â 
mittee, Secretary Charles Welsh of the
School Board and Auditor Broderlck.
Welsh was present with a detailed state
ment of the finances of the board and
other information bearing upon the ex
penditures.
The Grand Jury has fully determined to
make things hot for the School Board,
believing that there has been gross de
reliction of duty and perhaps worse in
the handling of the school funds. Espe
cial attention will be directed toward the
bills for equipping Mission High School
with furniture, apparatus, etc., the cost
i having been somewhere In the neighbor
hood of $40,000. President Barrington has
refused to sign some of these bills.
The fact has leaked out that thousands
of dollars have been expended recently
by the various committees without se
curing the consent of the board. The sup
ply committee has gone ahead and equip
ped Mission High School on its own re
sponsibility, and is charged with gross
extravagance, inasmuch as the School
Board had no money to expend in the
purchase of high-priced desks, laboratory
equipment, etc.
There is reason to believe that several
indictments will result.
The Grand Jury last night returned a
new indictment against Mrs. Botkin for
the murder of Mrs. Dunning, a technical
flaw having been discovered in the indict
ment previously found.
Registrar Biggy is to Be complimented
by the Grand Jury in a special report
and his efficiency in office will be dwelt
upon at length. At the same time the
Board of Election Commissioners will i
come in for a roast on account of the wav
in which hoodlums, Senegambians and
others were appointed as judges and
clerks of election.

Etta L. Eckley Avers That Her Ex-
Husband Is Able to Pay, for
He Makes Books on
the Haces.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 10.
John Bckley will probably be cited to
appear in the Supreme Court for con
tempt in failing to pay alimony to his
divorced wife.
Etta Louise Eckley obtained a decree
of divorce on September 27 last from
John, who is known on both sides of the
bay as a hail and well met fellow, pos
sessed of an abundance of ducats. The
gTound alleged as the cause of action was
willful desertion, though it had been gen
erally anticipated that tho allegations
would be of a sensational character. The
couple had been living In Alameda, appa
rently in the height of happiness, but the
testimony adduced at the trial showed
that the husband frequently remained
away from home a week at a time, and it
showed thai much of this time comprised
the moments during which he was bask
iiiK in the smiies of a woman In San I
Francisco. Tho suit proved a shock to i
Alameda society circles.
Mrs. Eckley was awarded custody of |
the minor child and alimony in the sum I
of $lw per month for the support of her
eelf and the little one.
According to an affidavit tiled by Mrs.
Eckley this afternoon, the smile-basking
John has failed to come forward with the
ny. The divorced wife avers that
be Is nniply supplied with money and able
to pay, and "that during all the time I
since the judgment and decree he has !
been living and eating at high-priced res- I
taurants in San Francisco; he has fre-
Quented the race tracks in Alameda ajid I
Sacramento counties with sporting men
and women, and at said places has always ;
had sufficient money to make books on i
the races run."
The deserted and divorced Alaxneda
wife further avers that the defendant
"has frequently taken 'FrankJe J. Taylor"
to said places and paid all the expenses
Id woman; and that he is wholly
supporting this woman, while the plaintiff
is without im-ans or money with which
to support herself and child, as she is ab
solutely dependent upon the payment of
alimony for her support."
The lirst payment was to be made Octo
ber 1, and she has not received any part
of this.
JOAQTJIN MILLER'S COAT.
Unique Costume the Poet Will Wear
on His Lecture Tour.
OAKLAND. Nov. ]o.â Joaquin Miller,
the poet of the Sierras, will w^ar a most
remarkable coat on his Eastern lecture
tour. This habit is made from the skin of
a young reindeer. The collar has a rich
trimming of mink fur. while the front is
decorated with four sable tails, each sur
mounted by a small fish or bird carved
from walrus ivory. Gold nuggets, col
lected by the poet in the frozen lields jf
Alaska, supply unique buttons; the waist
coat is of sealskin. A cap or rare
Sight furs complete the odd costume,
which for comfort and as a guard against
Inclement winters will be the envy of
Easterners.
"One of The first things my agent sug
gested to me," said the poet, "was that I
should make rn\ appearance in evening
dress during my lecturing tour, which I
shall start on In a few days, and so 1
made up my mind to adopt the evening
dress of tno people of Alaska, with whom
I have been spending the last year or two.
You see the insult, and I have an idea
that it won't be so very uncomfortable
when I get among the snowdrifts of the
middle \vest."
Death of a Hermit.
OAKLAND, Nov. 10.â George Kane, an
>ld hermit, who for many years has been
residing in a two-room cabin on San
Pablo avenue, between Thirty-fifth and
Thirty-sixth streets, was found dead to
night. Deceased had not been seen about
ais place for a week past and neighbors
:his evening notified the police that the
)ld man was either sick and needed care
or dead. Officers Swain and Braainan,
who were immediately detailed, found
Kane's body lying on an old dilapidated
lounge in the kitchen. He had been dead
it least five days.
Kane lived in a state of bestial squalor.
He was a confirmed miser and woman
nater. The story is told that many years
ago, when the sparkle of youth was vet
ii his eye. he loved, but the object of nls
lopes died, and since then he would shun
âºvery woman and would walk to the curb
to avoid setting eyes on the fair sex. His
characteristics as a miser were deep
rooted. He was often seen with sack in
Jand gathering bits of bread and victuals
aear the chophouses. and moat obtained
ostensibly for his dog served for his
nourishment. Yet he is said to have
boarded up gold which is supposed to be
lidden in or about tne cabin. Kane was a
nan of unusually tall stature. He was
iged over 72 years, and was a well known
iharacter.

OAKLAND HAS

The Maguire Banner
Left After Dark.
MR. JONES IS STILL TALKING
SEEMS UNABLE TO READ THE
HANDWRITING.
"The New Democracy" Proves to Be
of a Kind That Drives tho
Votes Away From, the
Party.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 10.
The large banner that has decorated
Broadway near Tenth street for the past
two months was with steady and solemn
pull hauled Into the Union parties' head
quarters last night after dark and the
campaign was over.
It contained on both sides a fiery picture
of Maguire, a pathetic portrait of Mr.
Hutchison of Los Angeles and some sharp
features, beneath which was the legend
"J. Audrey Jones for Congress." It is
not likely that the banner will be used
again.
Very great dissatisfaction exists among
the so-called Fusionists. The Democrats
charge that the Fusionists did not vote
the ticket and the compliment is returned.
One of the chief reasons given for the de
feat of the Fusion ticket in this county is
that "the new Democracy" Is not of a
kind that appeals to the Alameda County
Democracy's Intelligence. The old-time
Democrats, who number about three to
on^ of the "new Democracy," declare that
the organ of this latter-day Democratic
anarchistic doctrine is responsible for the
apparently hopeless overthrow of the
party of Jefferson.
A general survey of AJameda County's
vote shows that on the average about I
likK) Fusionists voted the Republican tick
at â unless, which Is very probable, that !
number of the "Union party" has been >
converted to Republicanism during- the
campaign, which is perhaps the true solu
tion of the question.
Mr. J. Aubrey Jones is not satisfied with
his defeat, although Mr. Metcalf received
two votes for every one that was given to
J. Aubrey Jones. Mr. Jones says he is ;
not vanquished. OveÂ»- nis signature J.
Aubrey Jones thus insults two-thirds of i
the people of Alameda County: Money
cannot always dominate manhood, and
principle must inevitably subjugate pelf.
As the people of California by a majority
vote have seen rit to put the stamp of dis
approval upon a man who, "through long
years of public service." etc., etc., "has
proved his," etc., etc., "simply because his
opponent is called a Republican, it may
not be wondered at that a plain man of i
the common people like myself should
likewise go down to defeat In his first es- I
say against the combined powers of
wealth, partisanism and prejudice."
J. Aubrey Jones has been unheard of in
this county until a short time ago when
he sought the fusion nomination from this
Congressional district at a time when no !
one else could be prevailed upon to take
It. His tirade against Mr. Metcnlf Is not
sincere, for the day after his defeat Mr
Jones was asked for the cause and he
said:
"I have discovered that during the lat
ter part of my campaign reports were cir
culated that I once belonged to the A. P
A. I can now see that the Catholic vote
did not go for me."
HE LOVED BETTER
THAN HE LABORED
HEALEY'S COMPLAINT AGAINST
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW.
Sent Him to Work on His Ranch, but
He Wooed the Housekeeper
Instead.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 10.â James Healey, a
refiner in the employ of the Pacific Coast
Oil Company at their works in this city,
thinks he is being badly used by his
brother-in-law, Jeremiah Cronin. The
matter is before the courts in a simple
suit for wages alleged to be due Cronin
from Healey, but behind the prosy verbi
age of the complaint is a story of ingrati
tude, according to the statements of
Healey.
The latter asserts that some months ago
he paid his brother-in-law's way from Ire
land to this country. When hia relative
from the old country reached here he sent
him to his ranch near Martinez, Contra
Costa County, agreeing to give him all he
could make off the proceeds of the farm.
Unfortunately for the peace and happi
ness of the Cronins and the HeaJeys, there
was a housekeeper at the Martinet ranch.
Cronin fell desperately in love with the
lady the first day he saw her. 'ihe sec
ond day of his reign at the ranch he pro
posed and the wedding was set for the
following evening. In his haste to secure
the marriage license Cronin took a short
cut to town and drove a team of horses
into a barbed-wire fence, injuring bom
animals so badly that they had to be
killed.
Cronin was such a devoted husband that
he spent most of his time telling his wife
how much he loved her. The potato crop
did not thrive, the pigs did not fatten and
the hens refused to lay under such man
agement. Brother-in-law Healey from
Alameda went to the ranch to investigate
the trouble. When he found that Cronin
thought more of love than labor he drove
him from the ranch.
To add insult to injury, Cronin thereupon
sued Healey for $420 alleged to be due for
wages in caring for the ranch.
Healey's attorney, R. B. Tappan, has
prepared an answer and cross-complaint,
in which his client denies the Cronin aebt
and sets up a claim for $d, the price of
the horses his brother-in-law killed in hia
haste to get a marriage license.

MORINGA, WITH
DEVIN UP, WON
THE NAGLEE
Defeated a Selected
Crowd at 12 to I.
RUBICON RAN WITHOUT PLACE!
WHEEL OF FORTUNE DOWNED
UNFORTUNATE MOBELLITO.
Pig-gott and Butter Divided the Sad
dle Honors â The Favorites Were,
With One Exception,
Successful.
The unwatchful said Morlnga was out
classed, so the Sobrante gelding disap
proved of the theory by capturing tue
Naglee selling stake at seven furlongs and
valued at $IL'SO from quite a select field at
Oakland yesterday. On his back . was
Devln and 94 pounds, a weight nulte to
his taste, and his admirers obtained me
luxurious price of 10 and 12 to 1 about
him.
There was little connected with the
early stages of the race, unless It was
Ferguson's bad start, resulting In Rosin
ante being left standing. When well
away, Devin, on Moringa, stowed
himself away In the third hole, allowing
Rutter. with La Goleta, to kill off Rubi
con. The latter was a top-heavy choice,
and when the stretch was reached began
to falter. La Goleta then forged to the
front, but at the paddock was growing
dizzy. Devin then picked up the running,
and though hailed by Woods, with the
leg over Recreation, led that mare past
the wire less than a length In 1:26%, a re
markably good performance, as the track
had been harrowed up and was fully a
second slow. Satsuma was a starter, but
got a poor send-off.
The crowd was large, but a trifled la
bored in Its betting operations. The rid
ing talent continues rusty, and the bet
ting will not assume larger dimensions
until Turner, Spencer and and the bet
will not assume larger dimensions
Turner, Spencer and Martin arrive,
The favorites all attended the exercises
and four of the five were awarded diplo
mas for getting to the stand in front.
Piggott was given thÂ« mount on Col.
Dan. backed down the smoldering favor
itism in the betting on the opening mile
selling affair, and his good riding landed
the purse. Prompto cut quite a swath
into the stretch and then fne weight an
chored him. Don Luis took up the run
ning, but in a hard drive was beaten a
good head by the Colonel. . Fleming once
again finished third at long odds.
Old Yemen was a sizzling hot 1 to 7
choice for the five and a half furlong
sprint, and it was not until the last fur
long that he put a stretch of daylight
between himself and the Reid. He then
won by over two lengths. In a fumbling
drive Gus Wilson, with Etta H, captured
the place from Peixotto.
The handicap over one mile and a quar
ter fell to Wheel of Fortune simply be
cause Garrigan made such a frightful
botch of it astride MorelTito. Harvey's
mare closed a slight favorite over the
colt. Whllo Shasta Water was in the
lead cutting out the pace Garrigan, on
Morellito, was busy finding pockets. At
the head of the stretch Rutter, oh the
Wheel, drew his whip and sneaked away.
Garrigan was so surprised that he ex
tricated himself from an unpleasant pre
dicament only to find himself next the
rail, and got to the wire just a length be
â¢ hind the favorite. H.e has much to learn.
Shasta Water was third.
i Piggott and Rutter again clashed In the
' mile and seventy yards run, last on the
1 card. The former was away in front
with the 8 to 1 chance, Benamela, and led
! to the paddock gate, where he was chal
lenged by Piggott, on Mistral 11, and in a
furious drive downed by a head. The
winner was equal choice in the betting
with Bernardino, which ran third.
Turf Notes.
Seventeen books cut in yesterday.
Riley Grannan and Barney Schreiber
were the new faces seen on the block.
Barney started off with a losing day,
but there's an old saying "that a bad
beginning results in a good ending."
Frank Taylor met with his usual
streak of ill-luck when Yemen took the
second evpnt. The aged gelding was en
tered to be sold for $S(X), and was "boost

Hildreth and suppooed that Yemen was
still the property of that turfman. Tay
lor says he purchased the horse outright
and holds a Dill of sale for same. If this
la so it would look as if Mr. Corrigan had
started In the season here with the left
foot first.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman had a
fairly good day of it. He wiped his
glasses twice when he saw 12 to 1 chalked
against Moringa. and sent his man to
get some of It. He was a good winner to
the race.
It would appear that owners have for
gotten that Jockey Beauchamp is here.
He is a modest, unassuming little fellow,
many pounds better than some of the
dullards that have been giving exhibi
tions in the saddle of late, and thor
oughly honest. He was one of the best
riders on the Chicago tracks, and can do
102 pounds.
Ed Lanlgan thought a coast record
would have to go to beat his horse Rubi
con, and backed his idea with a good big
chunk of coin. "Rube" likes to travel all
by himself, and when he could not shake
off La Goleta handed it over.
If starter Jim Ferguson should ever
! seek laurels In the roped arena he will
not have to look far for a match. Eddie
Graney brought a party of friends over
to the races yesterday, among them Chief
Sullivan of the Fire Department, and
they all g<5T the "whisper" to put it down
on Coffey's mare Rosinante to win the
stake. When Eddie saw the field sent
away with Rosinante left at the post, he
excitedly asked Ferguson's weight and
then rushed down to the printing office
under the trainers' stand looking for a
punching bag. Nor Is Ferguson ever like
ly to be elected an honorary member of
the San Francisco Fire Department.
J. A. Murphy, .T. J. Carter and Charles
F. Price of the Board of Stewards of the
California Jockey Club convened In the
rooms of the club last evening. George
Miller and Edward Blazer, lessees of the

Oakland did not suit the officials, wore

HOODOO HEADQUARTERS.
Grim Fate That Pursued the Panrott
Building Candidates.
There was a mournful congregation of
defeated candidates in the Parrott build
ing yesterday, and not one but felt he was
under a political banshee. "If I ever run
for a public offlc again." remarked one of
the unfortunates, "I will have my private
office In some other building than this.
There Is a hoodoo on the whole outfit."
"Amen," quoth the rest.
Two ye-ars ago the spell of 111 luck at
tached to the structure was recognized,
but it was soon forgotten. On that occa
sion hardly a candidate running for office
from there was successful. This year it
was a Waterloo for even' candidate under
its roof. The list of unfortunates and the
record of blighted hopes is long.
Up near the roof, in the Supreme Court,
is Justice Van Fleet, who will retire as
soon as his term of office is finished. He
hoped to succeed himself.
On the same floor is T. H. "Ward, clerk
of the Supreme Court. He aspired to be re
turned, but was turned down by the con
vention at Sacramento, G. W. Root get
ting the nomination and winning in the
great fight. T. W. H. Shanahan, nomi
nee for Governor of the Populist party,
met defeat before he had a start In the
race, the Supreme Court knocking out his
nomination by refusing to compel the Sec
retary of State to place the name of
Shanahan on the ballots. Two years ago
George W. Monteith ran for Congress, but
never got there. This year he went before
the convention and the ruling powers
turned their thumbs toward the ground
when his plea was made. Another to meet
with defeat was Arthur North, very re
cently bailiff of the Supreme Court. He
went from the Parrott building to Tolo
County, where he ran for District Attor
ney. The hoodoo followed him even into
the country. Two years ago A. Bernard,
whose office was in this building, ran for
City and County Attorney. The spell was
on him as well as the others.
In the same year the banner of Husro
Asher "For Congress" was hung out of
the window. He never got there. At the
same time A. J. Fritz ran for Justice of
the Peace, but he was up against 1t and
did not know it until too late. TMs year
he moved from the abode of the/t>olitical
bogie man Just before the election, but
the hoodoo followed him. John. Bi
Carson was ignorant of the political hoo
doo and struck out for the superior bench.
He did not reach there and now he Is
cursing his bad luck. Leonard Stone, also
for Justice of the Peace-, made a slip-up
from the Parrott building. He, too, lays
the blame for his defeat on his hoodoo
surroundings. Another aspirant for Jus
tice of the PÂ«ace was W. G. Burke, who
for a lone tiAe has been In the office of
Sullivan & Sullivan. Burke found himself
in the political soup when the votes were
counted. William Craig, another occu
pant, aspired to have the title of "Hon."
in front of his name and he worked hard
to defeat Conogressman Eugene F. Loud
In the Fifth Congressional District. The
combination of Loud and hoodoo were too
many fox him and he will not warm a
chair in Congress* this time.
Of course there are exceptions to all
rules and in this building there were two.
Justice McFarland was elected to succeed
himself and D. J. Murphy won out in his
fight for District Attorney against the
alien from Mexico. Probably the worst
hit of the lot was the People's party,
which took up its headquarters on the
fifth floor. The hoodoo did not do a thing
to its candidates. The uncanny shad<=> is
apparently taking a rest for two years.
A Big Steam Scare.
There was considerable excitement oc
casioned at the City Building yesterday
morning by the escape of steam from a
heating pipe which was being repaired.
Dense clouds of vapor filled the Regis
trar's rooms and escaped through the
corridors to the McAllister-street en
trance. The trouble was soon remedied
and the counting of the ballots proceeded
as usual.

Alexander Harrison, the famous
American painter, in next Sunday's
Call.

WENT QUIETLY
TO HONOLULU
AND WERE WED
Ladies Who Followed
Their Lovers.
TWO SURPRISE PARTIES
ONE COUPLE HAS GONE TO
HOUSxJLEEPINCh
The Other Young Lady, Though Mar
ried, Eetumeu on the Australia
Yesterday Under Her
Maiden Name.
Honolulu seems to be the bourne to I
which ail the marriageable young women
are hastening. The arrival there of a
Bteamer from this coast is the signal for
the ringing of the wedding- bells, and the
vessel has not been tied up at the wharf
an hour, in some instances, before the par
son has pocketed his fee.
The Australia returned from the islands .
yesterday and among the passengers was
a young lady who left San Francisco a j
maid and returns a wife. Strange to say 'â¢
Bhe returns under her maiden name, and ;
the news of the marriage will be a sur- j
prise to her relatives and friends.
Miss Letitia M. Mackay, of 729 Myrtle
Street, Oakland, Is a good looking young j
school teacher in the Athens of the Pa
cific. She loved and was beloved by a
young man named O. H. Walker, but the
lover's position was objected to and filthy
lucre was mixed up in the matter. Mr. i
Walker decided to shake the dust of Oak- |
land from his feet and to seek a fortune j
in the tropics. At Honolulu he received j
the position of bookkeeper in the large j
dry goods house of L. P. Kerr, and soon ,
had an assured position in the Paradise
of the Pacific.
He wrote regularly to Miss Mackay, and
she was delighted with his success. She
pined for a sight of her lover, however,
and determined to ijive him a surprise. \
A leave of absence trom her school was
obtained and it did not take long to se
cure a passage by the Alameda to Hono
lulu. On the way down she became ac
quainted with a Mrs. William McCaslin
and confided to that lady that she was j
on her way to Hawaii to get married, i
Mrs. McCaslin promised to assist her and
did to the extent of being bridesmaid ai |
the wedding.
The Alameda arrived at Honolulu the
afternoon of October 13. and no one was
more surprised than Mr. Walker when
his lady love walked into the store. It ;
did not take long to secure a marriage
license and a few nours later O. H. Walk
er and Letitia M. Mackay were made one
by the Rev. G. L. Parsons in the pres
ence of W. JL. Fletcher and Mrs. W. Me-
Casiin. The ceremony was performed in
the Methodist parsonage, and the whole
affair was kept very quiet.
The young couple enjoyed a fortnighfs
honeymoon, and then the bride took pas
sage on the steamer Australia for San
Francisco as "Miss L. M. Mackay." She
arrived here under that name, and as
Miss Mackay she went to her home in
Oakland. To-day, however, she will be
known as Mrs. O. H. Walker, nee Mackay.
Another passenger on the steamer Ala
meda with Miss Mackay to the islands
was a Mis.s Mary J. Walshe. They were
both bound to Honolulu on the same er
rand, but strange to say did not become
acquainted. Miss Walshe was on her way
to meet Lieutenant Frank Smith Brit
tain of the engineer corps, U. S. V. They
had met and loved in Texas, and the lady
traveled all the way from the Lone Star
State alone to join her lover. The wed
ding was celebrated In St. Andrew's Ca
thedral by the Rev. Alexander Mackin
tosh a few hours after the Aiameda
reacned port. The young couple set up
housekeeping in Honolulu and wiil re
main there until Lieutenant Brittaln's
regiment is ordered home.
MYSTERY SURROUNDS
MRS. WILKINS' DEATH
DB. KTJHLMAN THINKS THERE
WAS FOTJX PLAY.
Believes She Died From Poison, and
Hints That It Was Not Self-
Administered.
Mrs. Lizzie Wilkins of Auburn, Cal.,
died suddenly at the home of her friend.
Mrs. FranJt Alger, 408 Jones street, yes
terday afternoon, and from the circum
stances surrounding the case Dr. Kuhl
man, who was called in to attend the
woman, is of the opinion that death was
due to poisoning, and intimates that it
may have been administered by some one
Interested in getting Mrs. Wilkins out of
the way.
Two weeks ago Mrs. Wilkins came to
this city to visit Mrs. Alger, and up to
yesterday morning seemed to be In the
best of health. When she was called for
breakfast yesterday morning she com
plained of severe pains in the stomach and
remained in bed. In the afternoon she
became worse, and Drs. Kuhlman and
Sullivan were summoned. The woman
died shortly after their arrival. Dr. Sul
livan, who saw the woman only a short
time before her death, is of the opinion
that Mrs. Wilkins died of cerebral hem
orrhage, but Dr. Kuhlman says all the
symptoms pointed to narcotic poisoningâ
probably cocaine. He says that the pupils
of the eyes were dilated and there was
profuse perspiration. To Deputy Coroner
Hallett Dr. Kuhlman stated that he
thought the case would bear close inves
tigation, as he understood that Mrs. Wil
kins, who is a widow, had considerable
property.
A search of the woman's effects brought
to light an ounce bottle of morphine, $100
in gold and a deed to a ranch near Au
burn. Mrs. Alger, who has known u.e
deceased from childhood, does not believe
that Mrs. Wilkins used morphine, and is
at a loss to explain the bottle found in
the trunk. Deputy Coroner Hallett thinks
the woman died from natural causes, and
says that if death was due to poisoning
he believes Mrs. Wilkins took it herself
either accidentally or intentionally.

i He was born in the little village of Mysaki, in the southern part of Japan,
and is about 50 years of age. His first visit to this country was in 1875, when he
passed three years at the Harvard Law School anl two years in a law office in
New Yorkâ returning to Toklo In 1880. His first official position in his own coun
try was in the Foreign Office, in which he was employed in various capacities
from ISB4 to 18S3. He was then appointed secretary to the Japanese Legation in
Peking, China, holding that office until the breaking out of the Chinese war, In
1894, compelled his return to Toklo. Serving there as Chief of the Political Bu
reau for about a year, he then went to Korea as special commissioner, remaining
there until 189â¬, when he was appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in Tokio,
which position he held until his appointment to hiÃ present office in September
last..
"What have you to say in regard to the relations between Japan and the Unit
ed States?" he was asked yesterday.
"As you well know," he replied, "the relations between the two countries^have
always been cf a most cordial nature, and I have not the least doubt that they
will so continue. The desire of my'countrymen is to Increase this friendly feel
ing and, also, to promote closer business relations. Regarding the Philippines?

to the ladder holding the remains at

Trouble Growing Out of the Ameri
can Registration of the Steamers
Victoria, Tacoma, Olympia
and Olengare.
The Marine Engineers' Association and
the Association of Master PllotÃ of this
city are much exercised over the fact
that deck officers and engineers of the
four British steamers of the Northern
Pacific Company which have recently
been granted American register, were per
mitted to immediately take out naturali
zation papers. These papers enabled the
officers to obtain licenses and thus hold
their positions.
The local organizations assert that in
some cases these men, thirty-two in num
ber, were, up to three weeks before the
steamers were transferred, members of
the British Naval Reserve. Under the
Federal law the applicant must swear
that he has had his first papers two
years, and it is hard to reconcile this fact
to the situation of these British officers
just prior to their becoming citizens.
It Is alleged that one of the witnesses
who swore that he had known one of the
officers live years had been for three years
past In the Arctic. An affidavit to this
effect will be forwarded to Seattle and an
attorney has been employed to make a
test case In the hope of proving perjury
on the part of some of the witnesses. If
this can be done the licenses will be re
voked.
A striking feature of the case la the
fact that the vessels could have come
under the American flag long ago, but
their owners waited until they could get
a register that would enable them to ply
In the coast trade.
There is no criticism of the abilities of
the English officers, but the Americans
who follow the same calling emphatically
object to the manner in which they ob
tained the right to work under the Amer
ican Jack to the exclusion of natives. The
contest will be closely watched by sea
faring men on this coast.
The steamers in question are the Vic
toria, Tacoma, Olympia and Glengare,
250,000 FBEE BBEAKFASTS.
Here Is a new departure. Two hun
dred and fifty thousand breakfasts will
be given away free, which means that
a great treat is in store for many San
Franciscans. The H-O Company of
Buffalo, N. T., has consigned a train
load of cereals to their Pacific Coast
agents, Messrs. Wellman, Peck & Co.,
and they in turn have announced that
arrangements have been made with all
of the principal grocers of this city to
distribute free to-morrow (Saturday)
ninety thousand packages of H-O
Buckwheat, a package to be given to
each purchaser of one package of H-O
Oats (Hornby's Oat Meal). This will
be an opportunity of a lifetime. Every
family should order early from their
grocer, or his solicitor, as the offer is
good for to-morrow only. Each pack
age contains ample to supply a good
sized family, which means that two
hundred and fifty thousand people will
to-morrow enjoy a breakfast of good,
old fashioned buckwheat cakes, with
out any extra expense.
TTNITT CLUB LECTURE.
Professor David Starr Jordan on
"Race Development and the
Use of Stimulants."
The second of a series of three lectures
was delivered by David Starr Jordan, be
fore the Unity Club at the Second Unitar
ian Church last night, and a large audi
ence was charmingly entertained. The
subject was "The Effect of the Use of
Stimulants on Race Development." The
learned lecturer did not agree with some
temperance orators that drinking to ex
cess fastens the craving for drink on the
next generation by reason of the bodily
germ Deing constantly bathed in alcohol.
"'There is no evidence," said he, "to sub
stantiate the theory that the descendants
should follow in the footsteps of the an
cestors. The most sober men are pos
sessed of. children who are drunkards,
and there is no Increase of drunkards
through inheritance.
"The theory which pervades Ibsen's
writings that the Bins of the father are
visited on the children is true only in
part. The sins may be visited on the
children, but not through heredity. If
the nervous power is destroyed or im
paired in the mother by the excessive use
of stimulants the child will have less
vitality than It would possess under bet
ter conditions.

ALL AMERICAN MUSIC MISSIONARY.
William Armstrong Talks About tie Music and Musicians
of His Country.
WILLIAM ARMSTRONG, the Chicago critic and essayist, said some
sound, poignant things about American music and musicians yester
day afternoon in the Columbia Theater, when, in conjunction with
Fritz Scheel and the Symphony Orchestra, he gave an illustrated
lecture on the subject of "American Composers." Mr. Armstrong said that
in the creative arts of literature, painting and sculpture the American had
made himself felt, but that in the matter of musical composition he was
almost unheard and unknown, even in his own country.
This deplorable fact was not due to the inferior quality of American
music. Mr. Armstrong said, but to neglect and unappreciation at home
The American composer needed no favoritism. His work could stand on
Its own merits. What he needed was a hearing.
Mr. Armstrong was in favor of representing a native composer on
every concert programme given in America. The country that could pro
duce an Edward Alexander MacDowell need not blush for its native
music. There should be a patriotism in art as well as in war.
He dwelt on the varied color and circumstance of this country. ths
inspiration they held for the composer. He traced American music from
early Puritan times, through the old South and Foster's negro songs,
through the rebellion and its baiiie songs down to the present day,
dwelling with emphasis on the work of MacDowell, Foote, Chadwick and
Mrs. Beach.
He reviewed the great conductorsâ Thomas, Seidl, Damroschâ and the
great singers, and he advocated a national opera-house that would make
it to the advantage of the composer and performer to work together. He
said that It was not -ilecessary to go abroad to study musical composi
tion, that it was not necessary to go abroad for anything until all that Is
to be learned here had been learned. The American musician whose edu
cation had been entirely European was apt to lose the local, the national
feeling that should be the basis of his art. It was not provincialism he
favored but originality.
Mr. Armstrong was in earnest, and his talk was accomplished and au
thoritative, and enthusiastically attended by a cultivated audience.
The second movement of Mrs. Bt^ch's "Gaelic" symphony and the in
troductory "legend" of MacDowell's ."Indian" suite were among the "Il
lustrations" given by Mr. Scheel and the band. While the former selec
tion may not have definitely settled it that a woman can write a sym
phony, It at least revealed music of cumulative power and si sitive im
agery, and the MacDowell excerpt (owing to the non-arrival of*L*e MS. the
entire suite could not be given), with its facile orchestration and remark
able treatment of Indian themes, was, especially after Mr. Armstrong's
patriotic appeal, worth going miles to hear. The band was hardly up to the
regular season's form, but, nevertheless, Mr. Scheel managed to make the
readings delightful. ASHTON STEVENS.

The doctor traced the gradual disin
tegration of the French race who have
contracted the iniquitous absinthe habit
which is slowly undermining the constitu
tions of large numbers of its citizens.
The beer drinking of the Germans, he
said, caused a severe drain on the nervous
system, and that race was more or less
lacking in self control, in ability to act
in resisting power and athletic force. It
is probable, he continued, that we are
reaching the millennium through liquor
which will tend to work us to the dead
level of life, and the drink problem would
likely never be solved until the end came.
