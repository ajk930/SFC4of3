SpÂ«cial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 9.â The
Herald's Washington corre
spondent telegraphs: Diplo
matic relations between the
United States and Spain,
through Minister de Lome, are
at an end, and all correspond
ence Hill be conducted exclu
sively through Minister Wood
ford in Madrid until Spain
sends a new Minister to Wash
ington or designates a Charge
d'Affaires. Minister de Lome
has cabled his resignation to
his Government. This is the re
sult of the publication of Mm
IStet <Ik Lome's tetter to Senor
Canalejas, severely criticizing
the 'President, and De Lome's
admission of its authenticity.
Assistant Secretary of State Day
admitted this afternoon that
this was true by saying that
Minister de Lome did not deny
theauthenucity of the letter pub
lished this morning, and by
stating that a cablegram had
been sent to Minister Wood
ford in Madrid, the contents of
which would not be made pub
lic until it had reached its des
tination.
While no official statement
will be made as to the contents
of this cablegram until its sub
stance has been communicated
to the Spanish Minister of For
eign Affairs, I am able to state
that it Informs Minister Wood
ford of the publication of the
letter, says that Minister de
Lome does not deny its authen
ticity, and directs him to sug
gest to the Spanish Foreign Of
fice that Minister de Lome can
not be longer regarded as per
sona grata, and to suggest that
another Minister be sent to
Washington.
I understand that Assistant
Secretary Day, as the principal
representative of the President,
made an informal ( II upon
Minister de Lome this morning,
and that while the Minister re
gretted very much the publica
tion of his private letter to his
friend, and regretted that it
should be construed as being in
sulting to the President, he
frankly confessed that he had
written suc^ a letter to Senor
Canalejas.
Minister de Lome takes the
position that he ought not to
discuss the incident for publi
cation, and he has nothing
whatever to say about it. I
learn, however, that in conver
sation with intimate friends he
says that the translation which
has appeared in the newspapers
is unnecessarily harsh, and that
while the words have been given
an English equivalent which he
did not have in mind when he
wrote the lette.r and which
make It appear more harsh than
the original Spanish, he has not
in any way changed his opinions
as expressed in the letter.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9â The publ!- j
cation in the morning newspapers of ;
an autograph letter from Senor de
Lome, the Spanish Minister, to his
friend Canalejas, criticizing the Presi
dent with the utmost freedom, caused
a sensation In official Washington and
soon will be followed by Minister de
Lome's departure from the United
States. At the outset there was a dls
position to question the authenticity of
the letter, but as, bit by bit, the cir- I
cumstantial evidence accumulated, un
til It was finally announced officially !
that the Minister declined to deny the '
iauthenticity of the letter, all doubt

THE TRANSLATION.
Legation de Espana,
Washington, D. C.
Senor Don Jose Canalejas â My
distinguished and Dear Friend:
You need not apologize for not
having written me; I also ought
to have written you, but have not
done so on account of being
weighed down with work and nous
sommes quittes.
The situation here continues un
changed. Everything depends on
polititcal and military success in
Cuba. The prologue of thie second
method of warfare wfll end the
day that the colonial Cabinet shall
be appointed, and it relieves us in
the eyes of the country of a part
of the responsibility of what may
happen there, and they must cast
the responsibility upon the
Cubans, whom they believe to be
so immaculate.
Until then we will not be able
to see clearly, and I consider it to
be a loss of time and an advance
b> the wrong road â the sending
of emissaries to the rebel field,
negotiating with the autonomists
not yet declared to be legally con
stituted, and the discovery o-f the
intentions and purposes of this
Government.
The exiles will return, one by
one, and when they return will
come walking into the sheepfold,
and the chiefs will gradually re
turn. Neither of these had the
courage to leave en masae and
they will not have the courage
thus to return.
The message has undeceived the
insurgents, who expected some
thing else, and has paralyzed the
action of Congress, but I consider
it bad. Besides, the natural and
inevitable coarseness with which
he repeats all that the press and
public opinion of Spain has said
of Weylei shows once more that
McKinley is weak and catering to
the rabble, and besides is a low
politician who desires to leave the
door open to me and to stand well
with the Jingoes of his party.
Nevertheless, as a matter of fact
it. Mill only depend on ourselves
whether he wili prove bad and ad
verse to us. I agree entirely with
you, without military success
nothing can be accomplished
there, and without military and
political success there is here al
ways danger that the insurgents
will be encouraged, if not by the
Government, at least by part of
the public opinion.
I do not believe you pay enough
attention to the role of England.
Nearly all the newspaper canaille
which swarms in your hotel are
English, and at the same time
that they are correspondents of
Journals here, they are also cor
respondents of the best newspap
ers and reviews of London.
Thus it has been since the be
ginning. To my mind the only
object of England is that Ameri
cans should occupy themselves
with us and leave her in peace
and if there is war so much the
better; that would further re
move what is threatening herâ
although that will never happen
It would be most important that
you should agitate the question
of commercial relations, even
though it would be only for ef
fect, and that you should send
here a man of importance in order
that I might use him to make
propaganda among Senators and
others in opposition to the Junta
and to win over the exiles.
There goes Amblard. I believe
he comes too deeply taken up with
little political matters, and there
must be something very great or
we shall lose. Adele returns your
salutation, and we wish you in
the new year to be the messenger
of peace, and take this New Year's
present to poor Spain. Always
your attentive friend and servant
who kisses your hands

DICTATOR
BARRIOS
MURDERED
Killed at the Door of His
Palace, and Morales
to Succeed Him.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett
" PANAMA, Feb. 9.â 1 have Just re
ceived a cable dispatch from the
Herald correspondent, in Guatemala
confirming the report of the assassi
nation of President Jose Maria Reyna
Barrios, President of the Guatemalan
republic.
The dispatch says the assassination
took place at 7 o'clock last night with
in 150 yards of the President's palace.
The assassin is a German named Os
car Solinger.
First Vice-President Manuel Estrada
Cabrera has assumed the Presidency.
All is quiet in the city, the dispatch
says.
MEXICO CITY, Feb. 9.â News has
reached here that General Morales,
formerly Secretary of War under Bar
rios, and later head of the unsuccess
ful rebellion against the dictator, had
been declared President of Guatemala,
vacant by the assassination of Barrios.
General Morales, who is preparing to
JOSE MARIA REYNA BARRIOS.
leave at once for Guatemala, to-night
gave the following to the Two Re
publics newspaper: "I have this day
received telegraphic news from Guate
mala relative to the death of General
Jose Maria Reyna Barrios, President of
Guatemala. As a citizen of Guate
mala and a member of the Republican
party of that country, I sincerely re
gret his tragic end. As a loyal oppo
nent of General Reyna Barrios, I would
prefer to have met him in a fair fight
and defeated him on the field
of battle; nevertheless, as this is an in
evitable fact, much to my regret, the
responsible parties only are those who
with their anti-patriotic sentiments
contributed to blind the man who has
now passed away, and by his death ob
scured the true situation of that coun
try. As yet I have not received the de
tailed facts of how General Barrios met
his death, but whatever they may be,
I both deplore and condemn the crime,
as it reflects upon civilization and dis-
honors my native country. I was a
personal friend of General Reyna Bar
rios, and although if afterward I was
his political opponent, would have pre
ferred many times to have seen him
die on the field of battle, fighting for
the liberty of Guatemala."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â Senor Lazo
Arriaga, the Guatemalan Minister to
the United States, this afternoon re
ceived an official cablegram from the
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guate
mala announcing the assassination of
President Barrios and the succession
to the Presidency of Vice-President
Manuel Estrada Cabrera.
The dispatch came from Guatemala
City, the capital, where President Bar
rios has lived and the Government de
partments are carried on. It added
that entire calm prevailed. This last
assurance, coupled with the immediate
succession of the First Vice-President,
in accordance with the methods of the
country, Is a special source of gratifi
cation to the Guatemalan officials here,
and to some extent alleviates the shock
with which they received the news of
the tragedy.
The relations between the late Presi
dent and the Guatemalan Minister at
Washington, Senor Lazo Arriga, were
much more than of an official charac
PROSPERO MORALES.
\er. They were close friends, and the
death of the President at the hands of
an assassin comes as a personal be
reavement to the Minister. Senor Ar
riga said Senor Barrios was a man of
wide attainments and marked execu
tive ability. He was 42 years of age.
The six-year term of. service for which
he was elected terminates on March 15
next, but the National Congressional
Assembly had already extended this
term for a further four years. The new
President, Mr. Cabrera, is a man of
prominence In Guatemala, and is one of
two chosen by the Congress to fill the
Presidency in case of a vacancy. The
system of the country is different from
that in the United States, there being
no Vice-President elected with the
President. The duty of filling the ex
ecutive chair devolves on the congres
sional branches. Accordingly First and
Second Vice-Presidents were selected
some time ago. When the excitement
of the tragedy has passed a Presiden
tial election may be held.
The assassination of Barrios probably
means the restoration to â  power in
Guatemala of Prospero Morales and his
followers. Jn the meantime Vice-Presi
dent Manuel Estrada Cabrera becomes
President of the republic, but his term
will it is certain, be of short duration,
as a general election must be held In
the republic on the 15th of next month.
This is Morales' chance to ride into
power.
News of the assassination of Barrios
was telegraphed to Morales in Mexico
as soon as it occurred and without any
loss of time he signified his intention
of returning to his native land and aid
in bringing about his success in be
coming Guatemala's ruler.
When the revolution broke out In
Guatemala a few months ago Morales
was its leader, and upon the defeat of
the revolutionary army before Quezal
tenango, fled with his lieutenants
across the Mexican border.
Barrios, the murdered President, was
born in Guatemala December 24, 1856,
and was the nephew of the great Bar
rios, slain on the frontier of Salvador
while trying to make himself master of
the destinies of Central America. The
younger Barrios was elected President
six years ago, and at that time was
the most popular man in the nation.
Recently he proclaimed himself dicta
tor, â¢ and then followed the revolution,
which he promptly suppressed, and his
death. Whether the assassination was
political or not will require further de
tails to determine. _____
BORIC ACID
A CURE FOR
PHTHISIS
Dr. G. W. Daywalt's Claim
Will Electrify the Medi=
cal World.
BORIC ACID VERSUS BACILLI TUBERCULOSES.
Actual experiment demonstrates that a culture medium containing
only three-tenths of one per cent of boric acid will inhibit the growth
of the tubercular bacilli. Some five months ago these thoughts induced
me to commence the hypodermic injection of a saturated solution of C.
P. boric acid. I soon found it difficult to get pure water from the av
erage druggist, let alone pure acid, but I finally succeeded in having
prepared a pure, synthetic liquid, which is named an oxygenated solu
tion of boron oxide, or oxyboron. It is a pentoxide and contains five parts
of oxygen to one part each of boron and hydrogen, with a slight excess
of oxygen (about one per cent) in mechanical solution.
Of this I introduced hypodermically from five to twenty C. C. at
one sitting. The Injection causes but little pain. Of course it is too
early yet to say "cure," but the results are certainly very gratifying.
"His eyes become bright and his color changes from the gray hue of
tuberculosis to one more nearly resembling that of health. The appe
tite rapidly returns and with it a feeling of vigor, which is most pleas
ant both to patient and physician." â Extract from an articfe prepared
by Dr. George W. Daywalt for reading before the County Medical So
ciety and publication in the Pacific Medical Journal.
These few words are an excerpt from
an article prepared by Dr. George W.
Daywalt for publication in the Pacific
Medical Journal and for reading be
fore the County Medical Society. This
eminent physician now claims that he
has discovered the boon for which the
medical world has sought so long, a
specific that will vanquish the bacilli
of the dread disease, consumption, and
carry Joy to the hearts of afflicted thou
sands. Nor is his discovery, whether
it be meritorious or not, a patent nos
trum to be purchased at several dollars
a bottle, but a simple preparation of
boracic, or boric, acid â borax, its basis,
lying on the borax fields of California
so abundantly that a little child could
scoop enough of it in a few minutes to
keep a chemist busy compounding it
for the market for a week.
Dr. Day wait does not attack Dr.
HlrÃcJafelder in thus announcing what
he claims Is the boon for which human
ity has seemingly hoped In vain, but at
the same time is obliged to assert that
from his standpoint the Cooper College
professor is either Ignorant of what is
the real active principle in his oxytu
berculin or else has gone through "the
unnecessary incantations over the
preparation of a remedy as in medie
val times" â the object, of course, be
ing to hide the active agent in the cur
ative process.
After reviewing the efforts of the
medico-scientific world to find a pro
cess by which the bacilli tuberculi
could be destroyed in the human body,
and the fact that within ten years from
the discovery of the bacillus all known
antiseptics were found wanting, the ar
ticle states that Koch announced a new
idea: the bacillus produced its own
poison. As no organism can live within
Its own excrement, this famous scien
tist obtained the ptomains from pure
cultures of bacilli to introduce into the
patient, hoping they would act as tox
ines to the bacilli or as antitoxine to
the patient. This was found to modify
course of the disease, but would
not cure. After classifying the bacilli
of diseases into two genera, those of
consumption, which are always at
work, and those of the rest, which
either kill the patient in a few days
or weeks or "throw up the sponge," Dr.
Daywalt comes to the consideration of
tuberculin and finally to oxytuberculin
as a remedy. This is where his words
are fraught with keen interest to the
medical profession. He says:
It undoubtedly has some merit, and it

is my object to show wherein that merit
lies. It is a combination of substances.
Is it all or only one of its several in
gredients that establishes its therapeutic
valueâ craefully growing the bacilli on
good veal, cooking them for 120 houra
with hydrogen peroxide (which generally
contains phosphoric acid), washing with
caustic soda, finally introducing boric
acid â is all this necessary, or is it simply
the unnecessary Incantations over the
preparation of a remedy p.s in medieval
times? Its own originator affirms that
there is no reaction when injected into
the system as In the case of tuberculin.
Why? Simply because it contains no
tuberculin. The process of making de
stroys it.

subjected to both of these for 120 hours.
We are taught to boil tuberculous milk
to render it harmless. The excuse given
for tuberculin oxidation is that the oxy
gen of the air coming in contact with
the bacilli in cases of operation for tuber
cular peritonitis causes a cure; at best,
this is only a theory. It might be the
argon of the air that effects the cure.
Admitting the cure is the offect of the
oxygen, the bacilli are not boiled in it as
arc those in the preparation of oxytuber
culin.
After oxytuberculin is treated with
soda the preparation, judging from all
the known facts concerning heat, oxy2

It is of no value save for the oxygen that

preserve It he added G per cent oi boric
acid. This one fact may perhaps hand
his name down to posterity as one of the
workers trying to destroy the greatest
enemy of mankind. For if oxytuberculln
cures consumption, boric add cures con
sumption.
Dr. Daywalt believes his deduction
is not to be marveled at . He goes
on to state that boric add is most
soothing to Inflamed surfaces, and that

all the popular antiseptic dressings;
that it is a non-irritative preservative

ing upon the borax fields of this State
do not decompose but absorb the boron
until even their entrails do not fer

â "Actual experiment," he states,"dem
onstrates that a culture medium con
taining only three-tenths of 1 per. cent
of boric acid will inhibit the growth
of tubercular bacilli. Sirme five months
ago these thoughts induced me to com
mence the hypodermic injection of
C P. boric acid. I soon found it diffi
cult to get pure water from the aver
age druggist, let alone pure acid, but
1 finally succeeded in having prepared
a pure, synthetic liquid, which is
named an oxygenated soluticm of bo
run oxide, or oxyboron. It is a pen
toxide and contains five parts of oxy
gen to one part each of boron and hy
drogen, with a slight excess of oxygen
(about 1 per cent) in mechanical solu
tion. . â¢
"Of this I introduced hypodermically
from Jive to twenty C. C. at one sit
ing. The injection causes but little
pain. Of course, it is too early yet to
pay 'cure, 1 but the results are certain
ly very gratifying. 'His eyes become
bright and his color changes from the
gray hue of tuberculosis to one more
nearly resembling that of health. The
appetite rapidly returns and with it a
feeling of vigor, which is most pleas
ant both to patient and physician.' "
The doctor also says that the con
sumptive is generally dyspeptic, and
that his food is n<rt assimilated or oxy
genized. The boron, he claims, will, in
addition to acting as an antiseptic,
give up its oxygen to convert the ab
sorbed food into vital energy. At the
least, he thinks there is a wide field
for investigation, and will probably be
rewarded both by loud approbation
from some quarters and a storm of
criticism from others.
A friend of the writer furnishes the
information that in one case the oxy
boron was injected into a man whose
weight had been reduced from 160 to
118, or forty -two pounds, through aj
year's sickness, who was a dyspeptic, ;
suffering with night sweats and much
expectoration. He asserts that of his '
own knowledge the mun's weight in
creased to nearly 150 pounds, his di- :
n became good, he ceased to be j
troubled with night sweats and ceased i
expectorating mucus entirely. This
patient had to go East, but others aro j
declared to be improving at a rapid
rate.
I>r. Day wait will say northing re- I
garding his discovery. His only words i
are: "I .refuse to be interviewed."
WILL OPPOSE
THE REA GANG
San Jose's New Charter
Club to Name a
Ticket.
Intends to Work Energetically
in the Coming City
Campaign.
SAX JOSE, Feb. 9.â The ctty cam
paign, which will be begun in about
three weeks, will be one of the hottest
evei- fought in this city. The election
occurs on the second Monday in April,
and the successful candidates take
office the first of July. The fight this
year will be between the New Charter
Club, which stands for good and eco
nomical government, and the gang
which has run Santa Clara County pol
itics for years.
That the New Charter Club is tak
ing an active interest in municipal
affairs is evidenced by doings of the
past week, and its victory obtained
over the Council yesterday, when that
body by a writ of mandate was com
pelled to pass an ordinance placing the
assessment of city property and col
lection of city taxes in the hands of
county officials. This was a hard blow
to the gang, ap some half-dozen of its
most ardent supporters will be minus
clerkships during the summer months.
At present there are two restraining
orders balking jobs of the Council that
were secured by the New Charter Club.
The first is to restrain the Mayor and
City Council from entering into a three
year contract with Nash & MaÃey
nolds for sweeping the streets, and the
other enjoins the officials from pur
chasing a fire-alarm system from the
United States Fire Alarm Company.
Both acts savor of crookedness, and it
was proposed to let both contracts at
exorbitant figures to the highest bid
der. The restraining orders come up
for hearing before Jude Kittredge next
Monday.
The New Charter Club is hereby formed
to unite in one organization those who
desire to secure good government for the '
city of San Jose by substituting correct
business principles in the management of
public affairs in the place of the present
corrupt and wasteful system.
The primary object of this organization j
is to cause' the election and appointment I
to office of those only who are honest and I

out the many reform principles embodied i
in the new charter. "We believe these de- I

to manajje the municipal affairs in an
honest ;<i;.l economical manner and with

We believe that honest, capable and

The New Charter Club will put a
jticket of its own in the field. This has
been decided upon. Other organiza- I
tions having: good government in view
will be asked to affiliate. Such encour
agement has been received from the
tax-payers that members of the club
feel confident of electing most of the
officers. The fieht will be a determined
one, and it is proposed to educate the
people on municipal affairs. Literature
bearing on the evil of gang rule will

WATCHING
THE DIXON
POISONER
Sheriff Rush Fears
He May Attempt
Suicide.
Deputies "Will Guard His
Cell Both Night and
Day.
Change in His Demeanor Be
lieved to Be a Ruse to
Mislead.
SAYS HE WANTS TO LIVE.
Thinks Life Imprisonment Somewhat
Better Than Death on the
Scaffold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUISUN, Feb. 9.â A close watch is
; being kept over FranK Belew, who
; confessed that he poisoned his brother
1 and sister. Sheriff Rush believes that
Belew will commit suicide if given the
! least opportunity and has accordingly
1 detailed deputies to remain with him
j night and day.
It is now believed that Belew made
the announcement that he intended
I standing trial In the belief that the
Sheriff would be thrown off his guard
and not closely watch him. It is ad- j
mitted on all sides that Belew Is sui
cidally inclined and that he will do
j away with himself if a guard is not
! kept over him. Belew at first said that
: he would acknowledge his guilt when
! brought into court. He now says that
he will fight to avoid the gallows.
"I do not feel as I did when arrest
i ed," said he yesterday, "and have no
â  desire to die. 1 thinK tnat imprison
ment for life would suit me better."
Sheriff Rush is not taking any
chances with the prisoner. "I will
have Belew watched night and day,"
said he last night, "and use every pos
sible precaution."
The cell occupied by Belew is the one
in which Murderer Keefe committed
suicide several years ago. Some one
smuggled a knife in to Keefe the day
before that fixed for his execution. He
cut his throat and wrists and bled to
death before medical aid could be sum
moned. No such opportunity will be
given Belew if the Sheriff can possibly
prevent it. Belew slept better last
night than at any time since his arrest.
He was sick and feverish during the
day. A physician gave him a quieting
potion and soon afterward he fell
asleep.
Constable Fitzpatriek, who aided ma
terially In Fecuring the evidence on
which Belew was arrested, is still
working on the case. He went to Dix
on yesterday and secured evidence to
prove one of the material points in the
prisoner's confession. Belew said that
he used rat poison to kill his brother
and sister and that it haa been in his
possession for several years. Fitzpat
riek ascertained yesterday that Belew
bought a package of rat poison at Dix
on on September 1, 1891. The record of
sale was found on the books of the Ep
pinger Company, Belew having bought
the poison with several other articles
on credit.
It is not yet known who will defend
Belew at the preliminary hearing Fri
day before Justice Maynard. Reese
Clark has been spoken of for attorney,
but he has not yet been engaged.

of Senor de Lome, who wrote a letter
to Senor Canalejas. sharply criticizing
President MeKinley, was made public
by the State Department:
"Minister de Lome does not deny
writing the letter. This department
has communicated with General
Woodford on the subject. Until that
communication reaches the Spanish
Government it would be improper to
in any manner state the contents of
the message to General Woodford."
"While the department refused to add
to this meaner announcement it can be
stated without question that Mr.Wood
ford was directed to lay the facts de
veloped before the Spanish Govern
ment, together with the statement that
in view of the Minister's refusal to
deny the authorship of the letter the
Spanish Government is looked to with
confidence to deal with the caee prop
erly. This amounts to an Invitation to
recall the Minister. No doubt Is en
tertained of the compliance with the
implied suggestion, but in case there
should be undue delay in acting the
State Department would feel called
upon to move directly in the matter
and give the Minister his passports, as
was done with Sir Julian Pauncefote's
predecessor, Sackville West, who wrote
the celebrated Murchison letter.
REGARD THE INCIDENT
AS A JINGO INTRIGUE.
MADRID, Feb. 9, midnight.â The De
Lome letter incident is regarded here
as a Jingoist intrigue, intended to dis
turb the relations between the United
States and Spain.
LONDON, Feb. 9.â The Washington
correspondent of the Daily News says:
"President McKinley is resolved that
Spain shall have no vestige of an ex
cuse to pick a quarrel with the United
States, and Spain can disown Senor de
Lome's utterances without the slight
est loss of dignity."
With the exception of the Daily Mail
the morning papers do not comment
on the De Lome Incident. The Daily
Mail says:
"We cannot suppose the De Lome
letter genuine; but if it is, then all the
fat would be in the fire. Things have
reached a pass where little is wanted
to cause an explosion. Even the recall
of Senor de Lome would not satisfy or
pacify the insulted jingoes."
The American correspondents are all
of the opinion that Senor de Lome's
recall is inevitable, but they believe
Spain will be allowed to* withdraw him
in the least disagreeable manner, as
after the Republican criticisms of Mr.

SENATORS SCATHINGLY
DENOUNCE SPAIN.
Cannon and Mason Speak in Support
of Their Cuban Besolu
tions.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â ln antici
pation of the speeches to be delivered
on the relations of the United States
and Spain concerning the Cuban war
âa subject of intense interest to a ma
jority of Americansâ the galleries were
crowded at an early hour to-day. In
deed, the public galleries were packed
before the Senate convened at 12
o'clock.
The resolution offered by Cannon of j
Utah yesterday, urging the President
to notify Spain that, if she fails to
recognize the independence of Cuba
before March 4 next, this Government
would then recognize the belligerent
| rights of the Cubans, and would ninety
days thereafter assert the independ
ence of the Cuban Republic, was then
laid before the Senate and Cannon
was recognized to speak on the sub
ject.
Cannon, in opening his speech, read
from a New York newspaper a state
ment in effect that the speeches to be j
delivered to-day would amount to
mere talk, and that nothingmoreharm- j
ful than talk would result from the
present agitation of the Cuban ques
tion in the S.enate.
"I want to say," said Cannon, "that ;
something more harmful than talk will i
result from the discussion of the Cv- i
ban question by Congress. These re- |
suits will strike "men in Congress and j
in fiigh place in the administration.
"War," continued Cannon, "is ended
In Cuba. The war that there existed j
has developed into a brutal contest of j
hunger."
After some discussion of general j
features of the Cuban question, Can- j
non said:
I charge now that the purpose of the ad
ministration is in consonance with the
wishes of the Spanish bondholders and
before peat-e is secured in Cuba security
of the payment of that tremendous debt
must be given by the blood-stained island.
That, I say, appears to be the wish
of the administration, and I may say of
Spain.
A sensational interruption of Can
.non occurred. Cannon had made the
statement that every rifle in the hands
of the Cuban patriots had cost them
$^00. There was a buzz of conversa
tion among the spectators, and af
ter quiet had been restored Can
non, whose face was white as paper,
and who was evidently painfully af
fected by his emotion, said:
I do not ordinarily object to remarks
of denial concerning statements which I
make on this floor; however, to a state
ment which I just made the audible
comment was added that it was a lie. I
care less, Mr. President, for the remark
â than for the spirit which actuated it.
*] reassert it as a solemn truth that the
Cuban patriots liav% paid $200 for every
rifle they have in use in their army. These
arms have come from the United States.
Every railroad and every exoress com
pany and every filibustering expedition
which has landed munitions of war upon
the island of Cuba has taken its deadly
toll.
The remark to which Cannon re
ferred came from a member of the
House \vh<> was talking to another
member behind the Senator's chair.
Cannon said the present policy was to
hold the Vubans while Spain outraged
and pillaged the island.
Hale followed Cannon with a motion
to refer the Cannon resolution to the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
At his close the resolution was re
ferred to the Foreign Relations Com
mittee.
Cannon again took the floor for a
brief personal explanation bearing up
on the scene in which he had partici
pated toward the close of his remarks.
He said the gentleman to whose utter
ances he had taken exception had ex
plained to him that they had reference
to another subject. He was willing to
accept the explanation.
Mason of Illinois was then recognized
and there was a buzz of comment as
he arose, and his resolution was read
from the desk. He was a Republican,
he said, and he was proud of the
patriotism of the executive. But, Ma
son said, he spoke his personal ron
victic-ns on the cause of Cuba. Said
he:
I am charged with seeking war, but
my resolution is for peace. One word
from this administration would bring
peace to this continent, and under the
providence of God, we believe, it would
bi*ng independence to Cuba. Three hun
dred thousand people starved! Throe hun
dred thousand marching to the grave!
And yet the cry is raised that war is
being sought, when the one and only cry
is for peace and an end to this atrocity.
This Government ought to maintain
that the horrible massacres whjeh are
now common in the island and conducted
under the guise of warfare must bo
stopped. The flag of truce has been aban
doned, prisoners of war are being- shot,
and it is evident that no rule of civilized
warfare is being observed. The conflict
has developed into a mere matter of mur
der on both sides â prisoners of war being
shot and macheted without trial.
Mason then read a letter, purporting
to be the answer of General Gomez to
General Blanco's offer "of a vessel to
enable him (Gomez) to leave the isl
and of Cuba in safety.
Think of this grand old soldier, brave
as he Is, fighting for a country he loves,
fighting In storm and sunshineâ fighting,
too, with the knowledge that his own son
had been sacrificed to the cause! Think
of him being approached by that military
prostitute, Blanco, with a pitiful bribe
for his honor! Now tha.t the Spanish
forces have refused open battle, the only
hope of Spain is to overcome the Cuban
leaders by bribes.
Mason contended that Uncle Sam
was In effect a policeman whose duty
it was to exercise his power to prevent
further bloodshed upon this fair island.
He read a letter from an American
woman who is a mother superior in a
convent in Havana, deploring the con
dition of affairs there.
"The war," she said, "has destroyed
the country, but while it has made
many poor, it has made others rich."
Continuing Mason said:
Weyler succeeded in killing hundreds
of thousands by his policy of concentra
tion. There can be no vicarious atone
ments for a nation's crime and the law
of compensation will demand the punish
ment of crimes here inflicted. While
these men and women were starving the
bucket-shops sent up price lists. As for
me, I cannot give attention to pork
prices in Illinois so long as this condition
of affairs continues in Cuba. These stock
jobbers tell us that war is hell. All
right; in Cuba it te worse than hell.
By the resolution he had offered Ma
son said this country in effect declared
to Spain that she must go from the
island of Cuba, and any differences be
tween the United States and the
Madrid Government arising out of the
declaration would be settled before the
courts of the world. In conclusion he
said:
Mr. President, if there is to be war,
let it be a war, not of our seeking, not
a war in which our soldiers shall carry
torches in their hands, but let it be a
war either in defense of our country or
in defense of the imperishable jewels of
humanity; jewels more sacred than lifeâ
a war of glory and of honor.
On motion of Hale the resolution was
referred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations.

Good Roads Question Considered by
National Assembly Dele
gates.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
S*. LOUIS, Feb. 9.â The entire day
was devoted by the National Assembly
of the League of American Wheelmen
to the discussion of good roads.
Chairman Otto Doerner of Milwaukee
presided over the meeting, and In his
opening address said that reports were
coming in from all over the country
that the farmers had entered the good
roads movement with an unexpected
zeal. Professor John Hamifton of Har
risburg, Pa., president of the National
Association of Farmers' Institute Con
ductors, delivered the principal address
qf the day.
The meeting did not adjourn until
late in the day.
The interest in the election has in
creased to fever heat. The New York
delegation has posted a bulletin board
in its headquarters on which is marked
down every vote as fast as it is pledged
for Potter. At 8 o'clock to-night the
board read: "276 votes pledged."
That President Potter will be re
elected is confidently expected on all
sides, and speculation is now being
made on his majority. Everything is
now in readiness for the opening ses
sion of the assembly to-morrow morn
ing, and, with but a few scattering ex
ceptions, the delegates have arrived.
To-night a banquet was held in the
dining hall of thi Southern, and the
festivities were continued until mid
night.
The friends of President Potter as
sert that he will have at least 252 votes
out of a total of 364â far more than is
necessary.
A protracted session of the Racing
Board was held to-day, with all the
members present. The first thing for
consideration was a list of riders who
had been transferred to the profes
sional from the amateur class for in
fraction of the league rules. Profes
sionals from nearly all the States were
recommended for transfer to the ama
teur class, and their cases will be acted
on by the National Assembly. Among
those so recommended was Howard W.
Squires of Oakland. Cal.
At the time of the adjournment to
night the Racing Board was deep in the
discussion of the California question.

OF THE PACIFIC COAST.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â Orca, at the
mouth of the Copper River in Alaska,
will probably be made a sub-port . of
entry. Senator Perkins has been working
on this for several days and was given
to understand at the Treasury Depart
ment to-day that his request would be
granted.
Representative Hilborn of California,
by request, to-night repeated his lecture
on "The Needs of Our Navy," which
aroused the antipathy of General Low
Wallace some weeks ago and which led
that gentleman to undertake some un
welcome investigations. It will be re
membered- that some of Judge Hilborn'a
statements were so alarming that Gen
eral Wallace regarded them as impossible
and of a sensational order. Investigation
proved that they understated the situa
tion and completely exonerated Judge
Hilborn, who is an authority on naval
matters.
Senator Perkins is happy over securing
two more Federal jobs for his friends and
supporters. Norman Malcolm of San
Jose has been selected for United States
Commissioner at Juneau, Alaska. He Is

ALTERATIONS IN
THE TURF CODE
National Trotting Associa
tion Meets in New
York.
Many Changes Made in the
Rules Enacted Two Years
Ago.
Passage of a Resolution Disapprov
ing of the Practice of Betting
on Heats.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â The biennial
congress of the National Trotting As
sociation met to-day. The representa
tives went over the entire turf code,
and, after discussing the various
changes suggested by the rules com
mittee, approved the majority of them.
Few of the rules enacted at the con
gress held on February 2, 1596, and
since then in force, escaped alteration.
Not only will the National Trotting As
sociation be governed by the revised
code, but by a resolution the American
Trotting Association was requested to
concur in the changes made.
The annual election of officers result
ed: P. P. Johnson, Lexington, Ky.,
president; David Bonner, New York,
and M. L. Smith, San Francisco, vice-,
presidents; Lewis J. Powers, Spring
field, Mass., treasurer; W. S. Gocher,
Hartford, Conn., secretary. District
boards were also elected, including the
following: Pacific districtâ E. P.
Heald, San Francisco; A. B. Spreckels,
San Francisco; C. M. Chase, San Fran
cisco.
Two questions that have excited
much discussion in trotting circlesâ
the abolition of hobbles and the li-
censing of drivers â came in for brief
discussion. The section adopted re
garding the use of hobbles now reads:
Horses wearing hobbles shall not be
eligible to start in races on the grounds
of members after January 1, 1899.
The new rule ragarding the licensing
of drivers provides that no rider or
driver shall be allowed to compete on
the grounds of a member until he shall
have obtained a license from the secre
tary of the National Trotting Associa
tion or shall have applied for such
license; that in case of emergency a
member may permit a rider of driver
to compete pending action on an ap
plication for license, but in all such
cases the winings of the horse shall be
withheld until the license is Issued, and
in case of failure to receive a license
the premium obtained shall be -dis
tributed under the rules; that a license
may be issued free of charge to all
riders and drivers against whom there
are no claims on the books of the Na
tional Trotting Association. The same
rules provide also that drivers must
wear their own distinguishing colors
and that a rider or driver shall not
ride or drive a horse in a race without
personal knowledge as to the eligibility
of the entry.
A resolution introduced by Charles
B. Palmer of Lowell, which set forth
that it is generally believed that bet
ting on heats is detrimental to the best
interests of the turf, the National Trot
ting Association disapproves of the
practice and declines to give it recog
nition, was adopted.
REBELS DEFEATED
IN NICARAGUA.
Attack on the Rivas Cuartel
Repulsed by the Forces
of Zelaya.
Copyrighted IS9S by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, Feb. 9.â A special cable
dispatch from the Herald correspond
ent In Rivas says that three hundred
insurgents evacuated San Juan del Sur
on Monday evening. One thousand lib
erals reached Rivas on Tuesday, and
there was hot fighting for two hours in
the street. Several were killed and
wounded on both sides. The insurgents
attempted to take the cuartel, but were
foiled and driven out of the city in dis
order.
An attempt was made by the insur
gent leaders here to ship some arms
to-day, but the agent of the Pacific
Mail steamship line refused to receive
them. The steamship Costa Pvica, sail
ing" to-morrow, will be allowed to call
at San Juan del Sur. as that port is
again in the hands of the Constitu
tional Government. The Liberals are
happy over their victory and believe
the revolution will soon be at an end,
with Zelaya still in power.
The Canal Commission has been un
able to cross the lake, as the Govern
ment has seized steamships for trans
ports. The commission will probably
get away in a few days.
Nicaraguan revolutionary exiles and
sympathizers here were much crest
fallen when given news of the rout of
the rebel forces at Rivas. Some of their
number left to-day for La Libertad.
They have not given up hope, however,
and say that the greater number must
have retreated to the Costa Rican fron
tier, where they will reorganize. They
also entertain hope of success In other
parts of the country.
SACRAMENTO SPORTS
OBEY CHIEF DWYER.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 9.â The sporting
fraternity of this city has obeyed the re
cent orders Issued by ChieT of Police
Uwyer, and as a consequence the games
are all closed to-night. The gamblers
offered no opposition to the Police De
partment, and even the proprietors of
kenn games d-ecided to close rather than
make a test case to decide whether keno
is prohibited under the statute.
The proprietors of the poolrooms have,
however, refused to close, and assert
that they are not violating the law. As
a matter of fact, there is a branch .office
in Washington, Yolo County, and it is
understood that all sales of pools are
booked at that place. Chief Dwyer will
consult the City Attorney and the cor
poration counsel before taking further
steps in the matter.
ELLERT AS A COLONIZER.
SALINAS, Feb. 9.â L. R. Ellert, ex-
Mayor of San Francisco, representing
the Citizens' Colonization Committee of
San Francisco, appeared before the
Board of Supervisors this afternoon and
presented a petition, unanimously signed
by residents of this county, asking that
the board donate $2000 from the general
funds of the county to assist in further
ing the interests of the Soledad colony.
He cited section 20, subdivision 33, of the
county government act, which allows the
Board of Supervisors to donate not over
$2000 to encourage immigration. Super
visor Wideman made a motion that the
board donate $1000 now, and that it be the
sense of the board that they will donate
$1000 of the next tax levy. Every member of
the board voted in favor of this motion
Mr. Ellert stated that at the present time
there are 100 people in the colony, and
that they are all prospering. Further
than that, they have at least 500 families
In San Francisco who want to colonize.

STANLEY SIFE. aged 25.
DAVID LOVELESS, aged 35.
PITTSBURG, Feb. 10.â At 8:30 last
night fire started in the large three
story cold storage house of the Chau
tauqua Lake Ice Company, occupying
a block from Twelfth to Thirteenth
street, between Pike street and Mul
berry, and before the flames were sub
dued, at 1:25 a. m., nearly $2,000,000
worth of property had been destroyed,
at least six lives lost and many peo
ple badly injured.
The fire in point of fatalities is the
most serious that Pittsburg has had
in years. The department responded
quickly and a general alarm was sent
in. Other alarms quickly followed, and
at midnight Allegheny's department
was called on for help.
The origin of the fire is unknown.
The vicinity is composed of a mixture
of huge warehouses and many private
residences, the inhabitants of which
fled in alarm, carrying with them as
much portable household goods as they
possessed. There were frequent ex
plosions, which greatly added to the
consternation and alarm. The streets
were completely blocked with people
and their goods, which interfered with
the firemen, who were already handi
capped in their efforts to control the
flames on account of windows and
doors of the burning buildings being
strongly barred by heavy iron shutters.
At 11:15 p. m. an explosion of whisky
stored in the warehouse occurred,
blowing out the Mulberry alley wall
with terrible results. At the time the
firemen, policemen, newspaper men and
others crowded the street near by and
the alley. Many were caught by the
falling walls â how many will not be
known until the debris is cleared away.
Telegraph, telephone and electric
light wires at the corner of Thirteenth
street and Perm fell shortly after the
explosion and killed an unknown
man.
Just after the explosion the large
warehouse of W. A. Hoverler & Co.,
situated on Pike street, directly op
posite the Chautauqua Company's
building, was ablaze and in a short
time was beyond hope of saving.
At about 1:18 the fire was got
under control and no further spread
is expected. The two large buildings
are a total wreck ,and the loss cannot
be much less than a million dollars.
At 2 a. m. there are six dead at the
Morgue, only five of whom have been
Identified. The identified dead are: A.
J. Berry, lieutenant of police; William
Scott Jr., son of William Scott, presi
dent of the Chautauqua Ice Company;
Mrs. Sife. aged 50 years: Stanley Sife,
aged 25 years; David Loveless, aged 35
years.
John Scott, a brother of William, is
missing and is supposed to be under
the debris.
Among the seriously injured are:
Captain J. A. Brown, building inspec
tor, both legs broken; Owen K. Felder,
compound fracture of right le.g; Wil

UP AND RUINED
Damage Done by Corpo
ration Employes at Los
Angeles.
Thoroughfares Not Repaired
After the Laying of
Conduits.
Huge Holes and Sags Which Will
Put the City to Future Ex
pense.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9.â The tax
payers and property owners on the
business thoroughfares are sizzling hot.
Their wrath knows no bounds.
Streets are being torn up not alone
by the water and gas companies but to
accommodate the demands of the San
Gabriel Electric Power and Lighting
Company in laying its underground
conduits. The methods employed by
these corporations and the manner of
performing their work is what the tax
payers are "kicking" about. A citizen
desiring to make water or gas connec
tions must put up $15 or $20 with the
city street department as a guarantee
that he will place the street in as good
condition as he found it. Not so with
these corporations. They tear up
streets at will, put in pipes and leave
the highways like unto a corduroy
road. The Street Superintendent does
not compel the corporations to put the
streets in as good condition after they
have torn them up for the reason that
the corporations claim that by their
franchises they are exempt from the
mandates placed upon ordinary citi
zens, and in this contention they are
supported by the syndicate press.
Pavements can be found where con
nections have been made for water or
gas by the strips of asphalt the width
of the trench, which has sunk and
formed a "swag." By actual measure
ments these depressions are four and
five inches in many cases. A notice
able illustration is in front of 641, 643
and 645 Spring street. The trenches
being dug for the San Gabriel Com
pany extend in all directions, and the
Alcatraz Paving Company is doing the
resurfacing.
Citizens object to the loose manner
in which streets are repaired. There
seems to be no relief. In a few months
sags a block long will begin to wreck
buggies and ditch bicycles.
As there are three new franchises
before the Council, a citizens' commit
tee will present itself before that body
and demand that before they be grant
ed, a clause must be inserted that the
petitioners shall replace streets in as
good condition as is now demanded of
citizens under the law. This matter
was laid before Mayor Snyder, who
said:
"The welfare of the city is at stake
in this, and the condition of the streets
plainly indicates that the corporations
take more privileges than are granted
citizens. I single out no one corpora
tion, but each is not as notorious as
the other. I shall call attention to this
glaring discrepancy in the matter of
the three franchises now pending be
fore the Council." 1

LONDON, Feb. 10.â A dispatch to the
Daily Mail says the British fleet now
at Chemulpo will go to Nagaski.
The Peking correspondent of the
Times says: The Japanese Minister,
Myano Furino, regretfully intimates to
the Tsung Li Tamen the inability of
his Government, having regard to the
obligations contracted in Japan, to
grant an extension of the time for pay
ment of the indemnity. Though no of
ficial statement has been issued, the
- negotiations for a loan from British
sources are regarded as having failed.
M. Duball, the French Charge d'Af
faires, has formulated some unreason
able demands upon the Tsung Li Ya
men. Among other things he insists
upon the payment of indemnity to the
family of a Frenchman kidnaped in
Tonquin, as alleged by the Chinese, by
brigands, and subsequently liberated.
Eight days have been given for a fa
vorable reply, in default whereof
French action in the south will become
necessary. The reply must necessarily
be unfavorable, and the Chinese are
helplessly waiting French action.
PEKING, Feb. 9.â The idea of a loan
on either British or Russian guarnantee
has been definitely abandoned. The
failure of the British negotiations with
such favorable terms seems due to
diplomatic bungling, and it is the opin
ion here that stronger diplomacy is
urgently needed.
Russia refuses to declare her inten
tions regarding Port Arthur. If the
Russian occupation is to be permanent
Great Britain ought to occupy Talien
"Wan or pome other northern port â
Chusan being too far southâ or to
withdraw altogether from competition
with Russia.
The offer of a German firm to negoti
ate a 6 per cent loan at 94 has been de
cllned.
VAXrnrVER, B. C, Feb. 9.âOrien
tal advices brought by the Empress of
China to-night state that with the ar
rival of re-enforcements to the Ger
man squadron at Kiaochau the Ger
man force will number about 4200 men.
There is pome disturbance at Chefu.
Some disbanded soldiers from Kiao
chau Bay have begun plundering in
the surrounding country.
At Port Arthur things are beginning
to assume their normal state. The port
â was for some time almost deserted, as
the inhabitants feared the repetition of
the massacre that occurred during the
war with Japan.
The Yokumin states that when the
Japanese steamer Nanyetsu Maru was
recently entering the harbor of Cheru
mepo a British man-of-war stopped
her and made inquiries about the
movements of a squadron of a certain
country.

PROTEST AGAINST
SCHROEDER'S REMOVAL
COLUMBUS, Ohio. Feb. 9.â There -was
a remarkable gathering at the Josephi
num, the papal institution in this city, to
day. Forty-five German Catholic priests
from all parts of the United States met
to bid farewell to Mgr. Joseph Schroeder,
â who leaves to-morrow to accept a pro
fessorship in the university at Munster,
Westphalia, tendered by Empcrnr Wil
liam, and to protest against the removal
of .Mgr. Schroeder from the chair of dog
matic theology of the Catholic University
at Washington, D. C. The forty-five
priests came as the delegates from 2000
German Catholic priests, with a constit
uency of 2,000,000 communicants of the
church.
An address was presented to Mgr.
Schroedrr expressing regret on behalf
of the German Catholics of the country
on his departure and severely censuring
the trustees of the (tathollc University
Rev. Father Thiel, on behalf of the -000
priests represented, presented Mgr.
Schroeder with a purse of $40w.
Mgr. Schroeder replied with much feel
ing, accepting the gift. In discussing his
removal from the chair of dogmatic the
ology in the Catholic University, he stated
the trustees had r-harged him with
teaching doctrines that were un-Catho
lic and his dismissal had shown that they
â were teaching many things which the
people of the church no longer accepted.

ENDS HIS LIFE
ON THE STEPS
OF A CHURCH
Suicide of a Rancher's Son Near
the Home He Had Not En
tered in Months.
HCVLLISTER, Feb. 9.â On the steps of the San Felipe church, Lionel
Chase, a prominent young man of San Felipe, ended hla life last night
by sending a bullet through his brain. He was a son of Newton Chase,
a well-to-do farmer living near that place. His body was found on
the steps of the church this morning.
It waa a ghastly sight that greeted early travelers on the San Felipe
road. On the steps of the pretty little church lay the corpse of the sui
cide, the right hand clasping a pistol and a gaping wound disfiguring
the head. Young Chase was shaved and neatly attired, and evidently
had made careful preparations for death. No cause can be assigned for
his act other than temporary insanity. He was about 35 years of age
and had never wanted for the comforts of life. Of late years, however,
he had become a heavy drinker, and it is believed that his indulgence
in liquor affected his mind.
There was a strange and unusual feature connected with this man's
death. For the past two months he had been away from home, living
in Los Angeles. When he returned last night he did not visit his
father's house, but, procuring a horse, he rode to the ranch, turned
the animal loose in the corral, and then repaired to the church steps.
Evidently he had decided to take one last look at the old home and then
end his life before the little house of worship.

SAN QFENTIX PRISON, Feb. 9.â
The State Senators who constitute the
Legislature's committee appointed to
inspect the public institutions of the
State held their second day's session
here to-day and adjourned to meet at
Folsom Prison next Friday. The
ground that was not covered yesterday
in the questioning was gone over to
day and completed. The following
Senators were present: Chairman John
H. Dickinson, J. J. Boyce, W. F. Prisk,
C. W. Simpson and E. W. Chapman.
During the morning session Senator
Boyce of Santa Barbara took the lead
in questioning, and Warden Hale was
asked a score of questions in regard
to the variety of things that could be
manufactured at the penitentiary and
whether it would be a good plan to
do so. The Warden explained that at
the present time all the shoes, clothing
and such articles were made in the
prison, but only in sufficient quantities
to supply their own demands. The
parole system was explained in detail,
and the Senators agreed that it was an
excellent institution and should be con
tinued.
There are at present 1340 convicts
confined in the San Quentin Peniten
tiary and 700 of this number are em
ployed in the jute mill.
Senator Boyce wanted to know
what the capacity of the pris
on was, and the Warden stated
that by doubling the number in the
cells 2000 prisoners could be housed,
but Warden Hale said that in all the
institutions he had visited in the East
the Wardens were unanimous in the
opinion that no more than 1000 men
could be handled in one prison as they
should be and he fully agreed.
The question of opium was fully dis
cussed, and the Warden explained how
it was that the drug got into the pris
on. He said that it was planted in the
yards and dug up by the convict gar
deners and other prisoners, who carried
it inside the walls, where it was ped
dled out. The Warden recommended
that a bill be passed at the next session
of the Legislature making it a felony
to smuggle the drug into the prison.
The only law, said the prison author
ity, that they had now to prevent the
traffic was shotgun law, and this they
applied now and then.
The proposition of establishing an
electric light plant at the penitentiary
was thoroughly discussed, but no con
clusion arrived at.
A special meeting of the committee
will be held in San Francisco before
the Folsom meeting Friday.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9.â The City
Clerk to-day sent to the officers of the
Los Angeles City Water Company, un
der instructions from the City Coun
cil, the resolution demanding a com
plete inventory of the corporation's
improvements to the city's distributing
plant. Unless the report is made with
in two weeks the city, under the reso
lution, notifies the company that it
will enter a default on its alleged con
tract with the municipality.
The further demand is to be made on
I the company that it specify in its in
! ventory of improvements the time
â  when each improvement was made.
â  This information will be of great value
, to the people when it comes to pur
' chasing these so-called improvements.
â  The time has come when the people
j feel that they should be kept fully
: posted as to the water plant's neg<>tia
â  ttofcff. Something like $2,000,000 of their
money is to be spent, and they have
I every reason and right to be posted
' as to its disposition. The policy of the
l water company and its syndicated
: press has been to keep them entirely in
! the dark, and it is still being pursued.
: The result is that the taxpayers of Los
Angeles are looking largely to The Call
! both for information and protection.
The Water Company press is now
i endeavoring to deceive the people by
; the publication of cheap cartoons ridi
i culing the proposition of municipal
j control and at the same time claiming
Ito favor it. The people are cognizant
! of this act of treachery on the part of
j the Times, Herald and Express, and
' they are resenting it in a very decided
i way.
Among the Water Company direc
j tors the breach is widening and the
; spirit of dissension is spreading. The
turn which affairs have taken within
the past thirty days in the matter of
! municipal control leads some of the
! directors, notably Messrs. Minor and
! Drake, to believe that the company and
j the stockholders are not going to re
â  ceive the fancy price they had antici-
I pated, and they are said to be thor
\ oughly convinced now that they can
' get no extension of their lease and
, franchise. The result is that they are
! dissatisfied with the managerial tact
â  and sagacity of the corporation.
Whether any changes will be made
i in the officers of the Wat'-r Company
i or not is as yet unknown, but develop
! ments are looked for, as there is a
; very pretty scrap on among the direc
i tors.
ALL THE VICTIMS WERE
SHOT IN THE BACK.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., Feb. 9.â When
court oponed this morning for the trial
of Sheriff Martin and his deputies Judge
Woodward spoke to the jurors about re
ceiving letters bearing upon any point
in the trial. He said:
"If you receive any letters with refer
ence to the trial, whether anonymous
or signed, it is your duty to hand them
over to the District Attorney, and you
must not allow them to make any im
pression on your mind."
Witness Lewis Kitsuki told how. on ar
riving at West Hazleton with the strik
ers, two deputies seized him and tore his
shirt. lie said a number of men were
â 0 frightened by the deputies threatening
thorn with their guns that they ran home
ami did not march to Latimer. On cross
examination he admitted that the Sheriff
had told the strikers to go home and that
they disobeyed and marched to Latimer.
Ellery Bonln, an undertaker of Hazle
ton, who buried thirteen of the victims,
described their wounds, saying all were
shot in the back, except one, who had a
bullet in his forehead. John Andreasky
told the same story, as had many others,
about the meeting on the night before the
shooting, the march to West Hazleton
and the march to Latimer.

LEXINGTON, Ky., Feb. 9.â Colonel
W. C. P. Breckinridge and his son,
Desha, have been challenged to mortal
combat by Captain Thomas E. Moore
of Shawhan, Ky., chairman of the Sev
enth Congressional District Democratic
Committee. The challenge is in the
form of a letter to the editor of the
Kentuckian Citizen, in which Captain
Moore says his attention has been
called to a criticism by the Lexington
Herald on his supposed candidacy for
one of the commissioner's places con
templated in the Bronston bill.
'"This is only one of their many un
truthful, unmanly, malicious attacks,"
says the writer, "dating from the time
I refused to support their candidate for
Congress."
Captain Moore says it has been sug
gested that their frequent attacks were
for the purpose of bringing about a
personal settlement, and if this is their
purpose a news journal is not a proper
place in which to settle such matters.
"To place myself on equal terms with
my traducers I waive age," writes Cap
tain Moore. "My assailants can place
themselves on equal footing with me
by making use of their left arm, I be
ing disabled in my right arm. This is
a matter between the responsible party
and myself. 1 will meet the party
aione, unarmed, and arrange with him
whatsoever course may be necessary
and satisfactory to both parties. To
this end I invite private correspond
ence."
Captain Moore has been a thorn in
the side of Colonel Breckinridge for
nearly a year. Early last spring the
Colonel paved the way for his renomi
nation by the Democrats by obtaining
promises from a majority of county
committees in the Seventh Congres
sional district. They were to order a
primary hi which iiiv.-kinridge would
easily have won. Captain Moore was
made chairman of the district commit
tee by the State convention, and was
given power to reorganize the county
committee. He did this by removing
Breckinridge's friends and naming
ultra-silver Democrats in their places.
The new committee refused to call a
primary, but forced a convention.
Breckinridge, realizing he would have
no chance for nomination in a conven
tion, refused to go into it, and accepted
the Republican nomination for Con
gress. He was defeated.
Colonel Breckinridge's son, Desha,
got control of the Lexington Herald
shortly afterward, and the Colonel has
been writing for it scathing editorials
denouncing silver men who opposed his
return to Congress. When it was pro
posed to pass a law placing the control
of penitentiaries into the hands of a
committee, it was announced that Cap
tain Moore would be named as a mem
ber of the committee. A bitter editorial
in the Herald last Tuesday intimated
that Captain Moore was unfit for the
position. It seem this last article
brought on the crisis, and the card of
Captain Moore was the result.
Desha Breckinridge announced in his
paper last fall that he and no one else
was responsible for the editorial utter
ances of the Herald. In an Interview
this afternoon, Colonel Breckinridge
said that Captain Moore did not mean
him, but meant Desha.
"The Captain is a bit angry," the
Colonel said, "but he will soon cool off."
Desha Breckinridge left town early
this morning on a business trip and
could not be seen to-day. His friends
do not believe he will engage in a per
sonal encounter with Captain Moore,
owing to the latter's age, which is 71
years. The Captain was a gallant Con
federate soldier. A wound in his right
arm paralyzed it. He is, therefore, phy
sically unable to cope with the Breck
inridges.

PARIS, Feb. 9.â ln spite of special
precautions, there was a repetition of
the scenes witnessed yesterday, when
the trial of Emile Zola and M. Perleux,
who are being prosecuted by the Gov
ernment for denouncing the Esterhazy
court-martial, was resumed to-day in
the Assize Court of the Seine.
Over two hundred barristers, in their
robes, gathered at the public entrance
and indulged in horse play. "When the
presiding Judge ordered them not to
obstruct the passage, the barristers
made a demonstration against him.
Thereupon the commandant of the Re
publican Guards sent a detachment of
troops to quell the disturbance.
The intervention of the military was
ill received and led to a violent affray.
The barristers rushed upon the Guards
and struck them. One of the young
lawyers was arrested, but after quiet
had been restored he was released.
General Boisdeffre refused emphati
cally to testify, under the plea of pro
fessional and State secrecy. M. de la
Gorgue, the presiding Judge, consented
that Mme. Dreyfus should be allowed
to testify on the condition that her,"evi
dence be restricted to the E^jgerhazy
case.
M. Laborie protested against the
limitation of the evidence of Mme.
Dreyfus and denounced the scenes in
court, the biased reports in the news
papers and the attacks on his client as
being unworthy of France.
General Boisdeffre, replying, ad
mitted that as Minister for War before
he had testified at the Esterhazy
court-martial he had received from
Major Esterhazy a certain document
which concerned the Dreyfus case, but
he refused to give any further particu
lars on the ground of professional se
crecy.
The general admitted that Colonel
Plcquart had been transferred to Tu
nis owing to his being favorable to
Dreyfus, and the witness added that
he-, personally, was convinced of the
guilt of Dreyfus, while other facts be
fore and after the court-martial, which
had come to his knowledge, made this
conviction unshakable. This state
ment made a sensation In court.
General Gonz followed and had a
violent altercation with M. Laborie, in
which the general public joined. The
tumult reached such a pitch that the
Judge ordered the court cleared, and
the municipal guards promptly obeyed
orders. The court resumed its session
five minutes later and General Gonz
explained that he had not meant all
he said. Thereupon the incident was
allowed to drop. General Gonz then
spoke of the investigation of Colonel
Picquart, whom he had encouraged,
but the general added that he told the
colonel to avoid arresting Major Es
terhazy, which the colonel wished to
do.
General Mercier, the former Minister
for War, who was next examined, de
clared that he believed the documents
extracted from the War Office had
been communicated to the newspaper
by the Dreyfus family. M. Laborie
immediately asked that Mme. Dreyfus
be allowed to confront General Mercier
and deny his statement, but the Judge
refused to allow it.
General counsel for M. Zola pressed
General Mercier to say If It were true
that a secret document had been com
municated to the Dreyfus court-mar
tial, but the general refused to reply.
At the conclusion of his examination
General Mercier was cheered.
M. Traireaux, who was Minister of
Justice at the time of the Dreyfus
court-martial, was the next witness.
After his evidence, which did not con
vey any startling facts, the court ad
journed. The crowd outside the court
cheered Generals Mercler, Boisdeffre
and Gonz, while M. Zola was left al
most unnoticed.

JUDGES OF THE BEST
And those who insist upon haying
the finest that can be obtained,
have not been slow in discovering
that the approval of the Govern-
ment of any article means a great
deal. . It is not surprising, there-
fore, that so many people with edu-
cated palates and discriminating
minds are using the popular "0.
F. C." Whiskey in preference to any
other. A well-known gentleman,
speaking on this subject recently,
said : "I do not agree with the man
who stated that 'all whiskies are
good.' My experience has been that
most of them are bad, but when I
find the Government guaranteeing
by its official stamp that every bot-
tle of 'O.F. C Whiskey is 100 per
cent proof, and when I find, upon
tasting and noting the after effects
how pleasant it is to take and how
fine in its effects, it does not take
me a moment to make up my mind
what to do, and that is to use it regu-
larly. I find it all that I can desire."
There are thousands of people in the com-
munity who have made the same discovery,
and the number is increasing every day.

WAS LYNN THE
MURDERER OF
P. CAMARINOS?
Straus and Sudden Death of an Inmate of teipews Asylum for
tie Insane Who Hat a Special nut Mnr
flerons Attendant
Tie Man wno Attempted tie Life of His Wife
. Accused of an Atrocious Crime in tie
State's Home for tie Demented.
lon R. Grlffltlis, a Discharged Patient of Qe Institu
tion, Claims tie Oakland Prisoner Paid Him to
Mirier tie Woman Lynn Afterward snot.
John "W. Lynn, who about a week
ago attempted the life of his wife in
Oakland by firing several bullets into
her body, and who is now feigning in
sanity in the Alameda County jail, is
said to be the murderer of Peter Cama
rinos, who was an inmate of the Ag
news Asylum for the Insane. Lynn
was employed by the relatives of the
demented man as a special guard and
attendant. Camarinos was brought
from the Hawaiian Islands, where he
was an extensive planter and fruit
grower, by his brother, D. G. Camari
nos. who conducted a commission busi
ness in this city, and the demented
man was placed in the care of friends
In Bausalito. He was at times, how
ever, violent and he could not well re
ceive the attention there that was de
sired, and arrangements were made for
his treatment at Agnews.
Dr. Sponagle, the superintendent of
the asylum, recommended that a spe
cial attendant be secured to care for
the demented man, and Lynn, who did
odd Jobs about the institution, though
he was not a regular employe of the
place, was spoken of as the man to
take care of his patient. He was sent
to the relatives of Camarinos with the
doctor's recommendation, and he was
engaged. He was paid $45 a month,
and two rooms were secured at the
asylum for the patient and his keeper
at $25 a month.
Camarinos was at the asylum nearly
six months when his death occurred, j
All the notification his friends received
was that his health broke down sud- i
denly and death occurred in a few j
hours. All the time he was in the in- j
stitution up to a day before the end
came his friends know that physically ;
he was in good health, and his sudden
death somewhat astonished them. An- j
other strange feature to the relatives
was the sudden decomposition of the j
body.
M. D. Vanvales, a nephew of the de- j
mented man, was notified by telegraph
by the asylum physician at about 10
a." m. on the day of Camarinos' death
that the insane man was very ill. There
was no train for Agnews until late in
the evening, and shortly after noon
Vanvales was debating whether he
would go on that train or wait until
the morning before going to the asy
lum, when he received another tele
gram announcing the death of his rela
tive. Vanvales immediately wired to
have the body sent to him on the morn
ing train, and when it arrived early
the next day decomposition had so far
progressed that it became necessary to
hermetically seal it in a casket.
About the time Camarinos was ad
mitted to the asylum John R. Griffiths
was admitted as a patient. Griffiths is
of a good family in the State, and he
has two brothers prominent in busi
ness in Oakland and Fresno. He a few
years ago had the misfortune to meet
with an accident in which his skull was
injured, and at times whenever he in
dulges in liquor he becomes violent. A
few days after the liquor is taken from
him he becomes rational.
He has several times been an inmate
of the Agnews Asylum, but each time
has been liberated after a few weeks'
treatment. He was taken to the asy
lum about the time Camarinos became
an inmate of the place, and he occu
pied a ward close to the room in which
the Hawaiian planter was confined.
Griffiths after a few days in the place
became to all appearances perfectly
rational, and, though he was not dis
charged, he was given many liberties
and made to assist in attending to the
wants c-f the special patients and their
special guards. In this way he became
well acquainted with Lynn and his
charge, Peter Camarinos.
"One day," said Griffiths, "I heard
Camarinos complain to Lynn of the
way his food was cooked. There was
an angry retort from the attendant,
and the sound of a scuffle followed.
WONDERFUL BICYCLE FEATS.
The Martels Astonisli the Crowd at the Fair
by Their Daring Riding.
The Martels in their daring bicycle feats were the attraction at the fair
last night. This small and youthful couple, for the husband is only 19 years
of age and his diminutive wife is two years his junior, save one of the most
remarkable exhibitions ever seen here in the way of trick and fancy riding.
They use one ordinary safety machine between them, and they manage to
do more upon it than most people can accomplish on a whole machine. They
ride in all conceivable positions, shapes and manner; In fact, they ride any
where but in the seat.
The husband balances his wife upon his head and then rides around in
a narrow circle with his hands off the handle-bars. He also gave a wonder
ful exhibition in balancing himself upon the wheel that evoked great ap
plause from the audience. To add to the difficulty of this feat the machine
was placed upon the top of a table. One striking feature about the Martels
was the grace with which they performed.
Captain John Holtum will exhibit the prowess of his arm at the
fair to-night. He will catch a cannon ball weighing twenty-one pounds
fired at him from a cannon 100 feet away. The ball travels so rapidly
through the air that it cannot be seen with the eye. The circumfer
ence of the wrist is seven inches, the forearm twelve inches and the biceps
sixteen inches. This arm was pulled against twenty men and moved them,
and it keeps up three iron balls weighing twenty-one pounds each all at the
same time. The hand has grasped the hands of such distinguished person
ages as Garibaldi, Bismarck, the King of Naples and others of rank. The
arm is the only one that has vanquished Samson and Sandow.
The chief attraction this afternoon will be the baby show, which will
be held from 2 until 4 o'clock. The judges are H. L. Joachimsen, C. L. Bar
rington and Otto Heynemann. The competition is for babies under two
years of age. Twenty prizes will be given and a special prize of $20 in gold
will be awarded the best set of triplets.
Friday afternoon every lady who visits the fair will be presented with
a handsome cup and saucer.
The floating: ball was put on at the Calaveras mining exhibit yesterday
and attracted much attention. It is suspended in the air without any
visible means of support and defies alll the laws of gravitation.
On Friday night the Battle of Gettysburg will be rendered by the band,
and the firing incident to the piece will be done by Company M of the First
Regiment.
The following is the musical programme for to-night:
Overture, "Der FrleFchultz"..C. M. yon Weber Selection, "Lucia di Lammermoor"
Waltz, â¢'lmmortellen" Gungl Solo for cornet \
Scherzo From Eighth Symphony Beethoven w. B. Rogers.
Polish danre Schwarwenka Hungarian rhapsody. No. 2 Liszt
Fantasle, grand medley on "Parlor and Russian dance Glinka
Street" Sousa March. "Gemma di Ver&y 1 .DonUetti
I looked Into the ward where Camari
nos was confined and saw Lynn strike
his patient, and Camarinos, who was
a powerful man physically, knocked
his attendant down. Camarinos might
have killed Lynn had not his cries
brought two other attendants.
â¢The two men grabbed the insane
man and threw him to the floor and
held him flat on his back. While he
was in that position Lynn, who was
savage with rage, jumped with both his
feet fairly on the stomach of the pros
trate man. Several times he did that,
coming down on the man with all the
force he could command, and each
time the eyes of the unfortunate victim
looked as if they would jump from
their sockets. Then the three men lifted
him up. He was ghastly pale, and as
he rose he feebly said: "My God, must
I etand this?' Then he fainted, and
only a few hours afterward his body
was carried out of the building."
That is not the only charge Griffiths
has to make against Lynn.
"Lynn and I became fairly well ac
quainted while I was at the asylum,
and I helped him a great deal in taking
care of his patient. After he killed
Camarinos, he often used to laugh
about it and say it was easy to get a
person out of the way when he became
too troublesome.
"Lynn remained at the asylum a
good deal after his patient died and one
day about the middle of November I
asked for and was promised a leave of
absence from the institution. Lynn
heard that I was going out and he ap
proached me and* asked me where I
was going. I told him I would go to
Fresno. He then drew me aside and
said:
" ' Did you ever kill a woman?"
"I replied that I had never killed any
one.
'"Look here,' he said, 'my wife is
working in Fresno. She will have
nothing more to do with me and I am
going to kill her.'
"I told Lynn that he would stretch
rope if he did, and he replied that he
knew how to avoid that all right.
"'I have been an attendant in an
asylum in Buffalo for about ten years
and I can play being insane and fool
the best experts. I would be in jail for
a time, then go to an asylum and then
it would be easy to get out.'
"He asked me if I would take $10 to
kill his wife in Fresno.
"I replied that I wanted more than
that for such a job.
"He asked, 'How much?'
"I said $20, and he gave me the
money. I wanted the money, but I
never" intended to kill his wife.
"I went to Fresno and was there a
day or two when I went to Mrs. Lynn,
who was employed by Kuttner, Gold
stein & Co., and told her of her hus
band's plan to kill her. I believe that
was on November 26. A day or two
later I was arrested on suspicion of
having murdered George Newman in
Antioch and was taken to Monterey.
I was in Antioch on me night of the
tragedy, but I had no difficulty in
clearing myself of the crime. I had
left the town on a river steamer
bound for Stockton, and several hours
after I went away Newman was seen
alive. The officers, however, sent me
back to Agnews.
"I met Lynn again and he asked me
why I had not done the job. He said
he had been watching the papers to
see if I had killed her.
"I told him I could not find her, and
then he offered me $200 to murder
her.
"I asked him why he did not do it
himself, and he replied, when I told
him I would not do it. "By God, I will.
God in heaven has said that I must
kill her and I will do it.' "
This conversation took place about
two weeks aso, and five days later
Lynn emptied the five chambers of a
revolver into his wife's body.
Griffiths says Lynn is now feigning
insanity.
Mrs. Lyr~ was employed by Kutt
ner, Goldst â¢ i &. Co. of Fresno at the
time Griffiths left the asylum and
went to Fresno. On her return to
Oakland she told of being warned
while there that her husband
would attempt to take her life, but she
said she was not afraid, as he was too
great a coward to do any such thing.

ST. PATRICK'S PARISH.
Success Assured by the Lnrge Audi
ence at Metropolitan Temple
Last Night.
The large audience which assembled
in Metropolitan Temple last night for
the purpose of aiding St. Patrick's bazaar
was well entertained by the talent named
on the programme. The entertainment
was opened by a vocal quartet consisting
of Daisy V. Keane, Miss Florence Naglc,
Harry Dlnan and George P. Hay wards.
This was followed by an address by
Father P. E. Mulligan, which called at
tention to the fact that for the first time
In nearly fifty, years St. Patrick's parish
was about to, hold a bazaar, and remind
ed those present that during that period
St. Patrick's parish had been invaded by
all the AhÂ£r parishes for assistance/and
that .theftime had now come when those
who had so long been aided by St. Pat
rick's parish should return the favor.
That #he friends of the parish will re
spond liberally is evidenced by the great
number who were present at last night's
entertainment. The ladies who had the
affair in charge deserve great credit both
in the management thereof and the talent
selected. ."-' .
SUICIDE THEORY
IS SCOUTED
Physicians Think That Hoff
man's Wounds Were Not
Self-inflicted.
Almost Entire Unanimity in the Med
ical Testimony Adduced at the
Figel Trial.
The jury listening to the testimony
given before Judge Carroll Cook in the
Figel case underwent a severe mental
strain yesterday. This is accounted for
by the fact that medical testimony,
with its surroundings of peculiar
sounding phrases and technicalities,
presented itself through statements of
Dr. Gallagher, autopsy physician, Coro
ner Hawkins and the expert testimony
of Dr. S. S. Kahn.
Policeman George W. Russell was
the first witness examined during the
clay. He explained the drawings he
had prepared of the scene of the shoot
ing, told of the blood stains on the car
pet, door and furniture, and identified
the door as the one he had cut out of
the room In which the telephone had
been stationed.
Dr. John Gallagher, autopsy physi
cian at the Morgue, was then called.
He testified that he had made a post
mortem examination of the merchants
body at the Morgue in the presence of
Chief of Police Lees, Dr. Hawkins and
other physicians.
Judge Murphy posed as an exhibit
while the doctor pointed out the loca
tion of the wounds or the correspond
ing points to those through which the
bullets crashed into Isaac Hoffman's
head.
The witness said that it would be
possible for a right-handed man to
have inflicted the wounds upon himself,
but that it was highly improbable. In
cross-examination the witness stated
that he was not at the Receiving Hos
pital at the time Isaac Hoffman was
taken there and treated by the attend
ing physicians.
Dr. Kahn's testimony bore out the
statements made at the preliminary
examination. I* is evident all the tes
tifying physicians are of the opinion
that Isaac Hoffman was assassinated.
The afternoon session opened with
an interested Chinaman in the gallery
and Coroner Hawkins on the witness
stand. Dr. Hawkins testified as to all
of the experiments tried by him with
a revolver loaded with blank cart
ridges on a caaaver in the Morgue.
The witness testified that the brain
matter was injured and that the in
jury in the mouth produced profuse
bleeding. The opinion was <^lven tvt v it
it was possible for the decease 1 , mer
chant to have fired all the shots, but
that it was not probable. The testi
mony throughout bore out the state
ments made by Dr. Gallagh -r during
the morning. In cross-examination
the witness stated that he had not
been at the Receiving Hospital at the
time the injured man was taken there
for treatment, and that his testimony
was given on facts witnessed at the
Morgue.
Dr. Morgan's testimony was in sub
stance the same as that given by the
other physicians, and he also stated
that his testimony was given merely
from what he had seen at the Morgue
at the time of the post-mortem exam
ination. Officer J. G. Maloney was
called to testify as to the whereabouts
of his brother, who had testified be
fore, but he was in ignorance concern
ing the matter.

caster.

Frozen Oranges From Fresno Seized

Two more weather-beaten vessels
reached port yesterday, the Wachu
setts from Departure B-iy and the Ru
,'us E. Wood from Nanaimo, B. C.
Both vessels encountered a succession
of squalls during the voyage. Captain
Davidson of the Y.'aehusetts says they
would freshen up from the southeast
until . a roÃu.ar gale was blowing.
Then it would haul around to the
south, southwest, and then work grad
ually back to the southeast and begin
all over again. The ship caught the
full force of the gale off Cape Blanco,
and there she was hove to for several
days under lower topsails and a fore
sail.
The Rufus E. Wood came in under a
jury rudder. She caught the gale off
the Columbia River and lost her rud
der-head in a squall that lasted three
hours. Captain McLeod unshipped the
spanker boom and made steering gear
with it. Worked by tackles, the bark
came along all right until a heavy
southeaster was run into off Point
Arena. There the bark had to be hove
to for some time until a favorable
wind came along and brought her into
San Francisco.
The United States sloop-of-war Mo
hican came down from Mare Island
yesterday. She had about half her
complement of apprentice boys, and
when the others are procured she will
start on a cruise in the southern seas,
which will probably include a long
stay at Samoa.
Neariy sixty boxes of frozen oranges
were seized by Health Inspector Jor
dan on the water front yesterday.
The fruit was sent here by Hobbs,
Parson & Co. of Fresno. Jordan made
a speech to the crowd of peddlers and
fruit dealers who were present, saying
that any of them who were caught
selling frozen fruit of any kind would
be arrested and prosecuted by the
Board of Health.
Captain Dan James of the tug Ida W.
and Captain William Johnson, owner of
the schooner J. B. Leeds, had an alter
cation yesterday which ended in blows.
The trouble arose over the cost of tow
ing the schooner, Johnson insisting
that the price charged was exorbitant
and Captain James insisting that it
was a fair and reasonable charge.
James got decidedly the better of the
argument, but the matter is not yet
by any means settled. Johnson was at
one time connected with the Pacific
Mail Company and was also a member
of the Salvation Army.
The old whaler Lew Williams is to
have a new set of twin screw engines
put in, and when the alterations are
completed she will go on the Dyea
route until the Yukon River opens,
when she will go on the run to St.
Michael.
The ship Sintram, lying at Spear
street wharf, will begin loading for the
Yukon River to-morrow. Four stern
wheel steamers and six barges have
been built for the Alaska Exploration
Company. These will be put on board
the Sintram in sections, and with them
will go 500 tons of coal and 100 mechan
ics. The ship will be towed to Dutch
Harbor by the tug Fearless, and on
her arrival there everything will be
discharged. The 100 men will be com
posed of carpenters, painters and ma
chinists, and they will proceed to put
the steamers and barges together. The
coal will be loaded into their bunkers
and then the steamers will be able to
start for fit. Michael in'june when the
Yukon River opens.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
City of Para arrived from Panama and
way ports yesterday with forty-seven
cabin, twenty-four steerage and ten
Chinese passengers. The voyage was
an uneventful one.
Captain Wallace of the steamer
Walla Walla returned from the East
yesterday and will resume command of
his vessel when she returns from the
sound. Captain Wallace went to Bos
ton to attend the meeting of the Mas
ter Mariner's Association of America.
While he has been away Captain Gage
has been in charge of the Walla Walla.

AMERICAN SOIL
RICH FIND ON
A NEW CREEK
Fabulous Strike on the
American Side of
the Yukon.
A Vancouver, B. C, Party
Picks Up $30,000 in Coarse
Gold in One Day.
Great Excitement Prevails and a
Stampede for the New Dig
gings Is Certain.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 9.â ln a telegram re
ceived here late to-night from Vancou
ver, B. C, is conveyed the report of a
fabulous gold find on an unknown
creek on the American side in the Yu
kon territory. The news came In a
letter from Fritz Behnsen of Victoria
to his brother Karl. He says:
"We have struck it rich on an un
known creek across the border, never
before seen by man. In the crevices of
the rocks in one day we picked up $50,
000 in coarse gold. Sell your business
or give it away and come quick with
ten men."
The Behnsens have large business in
terests at Vancouver, and are consid
ered thoroughly reliable. In view of
this fact the news, which spread like
wildfire, will result in a stampede to
the American side as soon as the local
ity can be ascertained.
Several Klondikers now in Seattle
were interviewed by The Call corre
spondent to-night as to the probability
of this report being true. The richness
of the reputed discovery seems so fab
ulous as to create in their minds a
doubtful impression as to its truthful
ness. However, they say that the Yu
kon country is so full of golden possi
bilities that they are almost prepared
to believe anything. Corroborative re
ports and further details will be anx
iously looked for.
The steamers City of Topeka and
Signal are overdue from Dyea and
Bkaguay. Up to a late hour to-night
they had not been reported.
A special from Nanaimo, B. C, states
that the steamer Oregon arrived there
to-day from Skaguay with twenty-five
passengers. Among the number are A.
(Jrrvie of Kent, Wash., and R. Lamore.
They came from the interior and are
the only ones with a stake. They re
fused to indicate the value of their
wealth, but admitted that they had
$10,000 worth of gold dust to dispose of.
They state that wages have taken a
fall in the Klondike district and that
many men are working for a dollar an
hour.

Canadian Pacific Will Not Treat
With American Lines. .
CHICAGO, Feb. 9.â Two days ago
! the executive officers of the transcon
tinental roads sent a message to Vice
president Shaughnessey of the Cana
dian Pacific, reciting the efforts made
jby the passenger agents of their re
; speetive lines to get General Passenger
Agent MeXicoll of the Canadian Pa
, cific to join in a conference regarding
: the Alaska business. To-day they re
ceived a reply from Mr. Shaughnessey,
, which is on the same line as those sent
by General Passenger Agent MeNico-11
to the general passenger agents of the
: American roads. Mr. Shaughnessey,
I in his telegram declining the request
for a meeting, went into the matter at
great length and wound up by de
i daring that unless the American roads
within three days withdrew all the cut
: rates which h>- declared to be in exist
: ence to North Pacific Coast points the
Canadian Pacific would proceed to
protect its interests in the manner in
i which seems to it best.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY" 10, 1898.
DECLARE
THE TREATY
IS BEATEN
Senators Perkins and
White Certain of
Victory.
Confident of the Defeat
of the Annexation
Scheme.
Vote Will Not Be Taken in the
Upper House Within
Two Weeks.
TRYING TO COERCE REED
Friends of the Measure Fail to Bring
the Speaker Under Their
Standard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 9.
It is claimed by the annexationists
that a "straw" vote taken in the Sen
ate during the executive session to-day
showed a majority of two for the Ha
waiian treaty. The accuracy of these
figures is disputed. The poll is of no
significance, anyhow, for only a few-
Senators remained for the executive
session after Mason concluded his
speech on Cuba. The straw vote is
considered of no importance by Sen
ator Perkins, who said to The Call cor
respondent to-night:
"I am satisfied that the annexation
ists have only fifty-five votes. They,
therefore, lack five votes of the neces
sary sixty, and I do not see how it is
possible for them to get the remainder.
Therefore I think the treaty is certain
ly beaten."
This is the opinion of Senator White,
who is so well satisfied with the situ
ation that he will return to Los An
geles on the 15th to try a law case.
Some of those opposed to annexation
are fearful that the annexationists will
in some way take advantage of his ab
sence, but this fear is groundless, for
the Senator would not leave unless he
had arranged that the vote should not
be taken during his absence. He will
return in two weeks, in time to lead
the opposition wh^n the vote is taken.
It is by no means certain, however,
that a vote will be reached that soon
even, for Senators are resolved to dis
cuss the treaty exhaustively. This
l^zds to the blief that neither the
treaty nor the bill nor a joint reso
lution will be passed at this session,
for Speaker Reed is anxious to adjourn
the House early in May and will not
allow an annexation bill to interfere
with this plan. For this reason it is
the belief of Senator Perkins and
others that the treaty will be allowed
to go over until next December.
The discouragement of the annexa
tionists and their efforts to coerce
Speaker Reed is best shown by the fol
lowing article in to-night's Star, the
Dole organ here. The editor of the
Star and President Dole are related by
marriage. The Star says:
The advocates of the annexation of
Hawaii regard it as entirely premature to
talk at this time of what will be the
bearing of certain influences in the House
upon annexation. They do not believe
that the treaty will fail, and it is only
upon condition of its failure that the
question would come before the House.
If the time comes when It shall be de
cided to be better to accomplish annexa
tion by legislation the attitude of Speaker
Reed toward annexation will not be re
garded as seriously threatening to its
success. There- is no doubt about a large
majority of the Republicans, supported
by the administration, being strongly in
favor of annexation. If Mr. Reed should
be disposed to make an active light
against annexation he would, at most,
have the assistance of only a small mi
nority of the Republicans. -In order to
make the opposition effective this minor
ity would have to break away from party
control and from the administration and
join with and act as a contingent of the
Democratic party.
Evidently with the purpose of deter
mining what could be done in the way
of such a combination inquiries have been
made as to how many Democrats in the
Hnusp could be relied upon to vote
against an annexation resolution. The
answer to this inquiry was that not
more than five or six Democrats in the
House would vote in favor of such a
resolution.
This would, of course, open the way for
a minority of the Representatives to bolt
thoir party and join the Democrats In an
attack upon an important feature of the
administration's policy. The effectiveness
of party discipline thus far has demon
strated that no such bolt .is that could
occur unless it had the sympathy of the
Speaker. Without such sympathy it
would be impossible to get enough Re
publicans to follow so radical a course.
That Speaker Reed would promote or
abet such a move is not believed. His
power as Speaker, present and past, has
depended upon a demand upon Republi
cans that they stand together as a
party in obedience to the will of the ma
jority, and that none should join the
Democrats in anything to overthrow the
will of the party majority. But recently
the Republicans were held thus to a
policy with respect to Cuba which was
distasteful to many. By the same in
fluence the party lines were held together
against the Teller resolution. To suppose
for an instant that Speaker Reed would
himself lead a revolt against the control
of his party majority in the Mouse in
order to prevent the annexation of Hawaii
is to credit him with a desire to destroy
his own source of power.
No one will expect him to do such a
thing.

SELF - DEFENSE CLAIMED.
Hill Admits the Killing, but on the
Advice of His Attorneys Will
Say No More.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, Feb. 9.â Robert Lee Hill
was arrested at 10 o'clock this morn
ing by Constable John Graham and
confined in the County Jail here on a
charge of murder for clubbing to death
Theodore R. Parvln.
The tragedy occurred about six miles
from Saticoy, on Hill's ranch, which
had been leased by Parvin for the next
two years. Trouble had been brewing
over this lease for some time. After
leasing the ranch Hill repented of his
bargain and sought to turn Parvin off,
but the latter declined to be ousted.
About noon yesterday Hill went to
the place where he found Parvin at
work mending a corral.
A parley took place between the men
In regard to the lease, and, according
to the dying man's statement to his
wife. Hill came there to buy the lease.
Parvin wanted $250, and Hill offered
$100. Upon his refusing this offer Hill
struck him with a club.
When Hill was seen to-day, he said
he regretted the deed, as he had noth
ing against the man. He further ad
mitted that he struck Parvin on the
head with a split scantling, two by
fuur inches, and about three feet long,
but claimed that Parvin attacked him
first with a saw and hammer. He
showed a scratch on his right wrist
which he claimed was done by Parvin
striking him with the saw, and also
claimed that he was struck on the left
hand with the hammer. He says his
plea will be sMf-defense.
Hill was seen again to-night and said
he had been advised by his attorneys to
say nothing, li^ realized, he said, that
public: oplni.'ii was against him. He
believed that he nught to make a state
ment and was willing for everything to
come out, but he would do as his at
torneys advised. "However," he said,
"I will state hat if 1 was placed Id,
the same position again I would do
Junt as 1 have done, and so would you
or any other man in a like position. It
was a matter of self-preservation with
me, and you know how a man feels
under these circumstances."
When asked what provocation caused
him to deal Parvin the deadly blow,
he flatly declined to answer.
Hill has been in a very nervous con
dition since the visit from his wife to
day, and begged to be allowed the free
dom of the corridor for more room to
walk. His cell is one of the largest in
the comfortable Ventura jail, and the
Sheriff decided that it was roomy
enough for him.
The tragic scene was witnessed by
Hill's father and partly by Mrs. Par
vin and a young buy. Hill would have
continued dealing o.ut blows to his vic
tim, but was stopped by his father.
Hill and his father departed immedi
ately, leaving his opponent lying on
the ground. Parvin afterward seated
himself upon a plow near by, where
he remained for a short time, and was
then taken to the house, where he died
at 2 o'clock this morning. He was
struck over the right temple, and the
little finger on his left hand was also
broken by the same blow, which he
tried to ward off with his arm.
Hill is a tall and powerful man. He
Is married and has two children, a girl
and a boy. He is 36 years old and has
been a resident of this county for the
past fifteen years. Parvin was not so
large a man. He leaves a wife and
little son. He was 32 years old.
A GIRL'S WILD
CRIES FOR HELP
Fresno Startled by a Thrilling
Episode That Savors of
Kidnaping.
Futile Pursuit in the Night of a
Mysterious Couple in a
Bu ggy-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. 9.â At about 7:30 o'clock
last evening the loud screams of a girl
calling for help attracted the attention
of Colonel S. S. Wright, who was in his
yard at the corner of I and Calaveras
streets. Upon running out he ascertained
that the screams came from a girl in a
buggy, who was being rapidly driven
away by a man, who was struggling with
her in an effort to suppress her cries for
assistance. He tried to muffle her voice,
and was hitting her with the butt end of
his whip to silence her screams. A citi
zen made an effort to stop the horse, but
the driver whipped up and almost ran
over the man who went to the girl's as
sistance. The fellow drove north at a
rapid gait, pursued by several citizens
and Policeman Morss. The driver out
stripped them, however, and disappeared.
As it was dark at the time the parties
could not be recognized. The girl was
asked to call out the name of the man,
and she attempted to, but he put hishand
over her mouth and beat her with the
whip. She managed to utter a name, but
the sound could not be recognized dis
tinctly, although the officer believes he
has a clew from it. The case is believed
to be one of kidnaping, and sensational
developments are expected.

IONE, Cal., Feb. 9. â The apparent
spirit of contentment which has seemed
to surround the cadets of the Preston
School since the change in manage
ment took place on January 1 was
abruptly broken this morning when fif
teen cadets made a dash for liberty
and escaped through one of the base
ment windows of the administration
building at 6 o'clock. These fifteen
were followed by two more this after
noon, who left their plows and the of
ficer in charge in the field and struck
out across lots on the run.. Six of the
seventeen have been captured and re
turned to the school. The citizens of
THE EMPORIUM.
this place to the number of twenty or
thirty joined the officers of the school
in the hunt and many are yet in the
hills.
Since January 1, when D. S. Hirsch
berg took charge as superintendent,
the cadets have shown their apprecia
tion of kind treatment and no attempts
to escape have been made, and it seems
that the boys who skipped out to-day
were promised a parole or a discharge
by the former superintendent. Mr.
Hlrshberg, however, has refused to
make any recommendations to the
Board of Trustees on the ground that
he desired to make no mistakes in his
recommendation and desired to become
thoroughly and personally acquainted
with all the cadets desiring release
from the school.
The present management has the
support of the community, and all good
citizens will assist in every way to
maintain discipline and return the es
caping cadets.

CHICAGO, Feb. 9.â Adolph L. Luetgert

his wife and sentenced to imprisonment
in the penitentiary for the term of his
natural life. Luetgert received the ver

It was 10:50 o'clock when word was sent

to bring it into court. The jury reached
a verdict on the first ballot. It retired
at 4:45 o'clock and took the first ballot
at 5:10. It was unanimous for convic

arriving at the punishment to be inflicted,
but this was settled by 8:30, and then the
jurors sat around in their room until 10

ANY EXCUSE WILL DO.
UJ HEX a man gets into his head an idea that
/ lite, as he knows it, is not worth living lie is
seldom at a loss as to the ultimate excuse. It
may be that his dinner does not suit him. Possibly
he has been presented with a necktie which fails to
win the approval of his artistic eye. But fantastic as
some of the pretexts seem, they must all give way
to that chosen by a pessimist in Vermont. He killed
himself because his wife refused to read him a chap
ter from the Bible. Unfortunately the particulars are
withheld It is not even stated why he did not read
the chapter himself, nor why she declined. How
ever, there is no need for the widow to spend her
time in regrets. If she is a person of ordinary attrac
tion she will doubtless be able to secure a husband
with more sense than the chump for whom it is now
her duty to wear mourning. She is in no way to
blame. All he wanted was an excuse, and he would
have found it. Perhaps had she consented to read
she would have struck some passage of a melancholy
tinge, the somber remarks of Job. for instance, based
on the possession of more boils than he knew what
to do with, and straightway essayed the climb of the
golden stair. Then she would have felt herself as
culpable as she does now.
THE WEATHER OF THE WINTER.
SOME experts say it was the sun spots, and
some say it was the hedgehog, but all agree a
hoodoo has been upon the weather all through
the winter. Moreover, the records bear them out.
In no part of the world has the winter been normal.
In some place.-; it has been better than in others, but
nowhere has it been just what was expected.
In California we have had one of the coldest sea
sons on record, and the cold spells have been of un
usoaDj long duration. The beautiful snow has more
than once flirted with the ripening oranges of the
south, and through the interior valleys frost ap
peared even* morning for a long time with the regu
larity of one who feels at home and never intends to
leave.
Over the wide, high plateaus of the Rocky Morn
tain Staies, where severe storms are expected in win
ter, the weather has been of moderate mildness
nearly all the time. There have been comparatively
few blizzards, and almost no intense cold. Along the
Atlantic coast the season was so mild up to a short
time ago that the people were complaining of lack of
snow for sleigh riding and ice for the summer's sup
ply. These complaints were hushed last week by the
blast from Boreas that nearly swept Boston into the
ocean and made all New England shiver, but with
that single exception there has been hardly a storm
of note during the whole winter in that section.
It seems this year that the farther east you go
the milder the winter is, when compared with the
normal temperature. In England there has been al
most no snow and ice at all Even the frost has been
very light Flowers have been blooming in the open
air all through the season. Very much the same con
dition is reported from Continental Europe. In fact
the winter has been one of remarkable mildness
throughout the Northern Hemisphere generally.
California in this as in all things else stands alone,
an exception to the rule. Her golden climate has
coppered the sun spot and bluffed the hedgehog.
Worden's confession of the guilt of several othei
men will be interesting reading to these men. It is
useless to deny that there has been an impression
that Worden was no worse than others. That they
escaped may be no reason for permitting him to do
so, but it is a circumstance bound to stir human sym
pathy.
It i> a pleasant relief to learn that the Senators who
have been at San Quentin were there on official busi
ness and were permitted to depart when they got
ready. If all goes well there will be some other serv
ants of the public there before long, and they will
have to stay until their sentences have expired.
After a murderer has confessed it is of course
proper to show that he did not know what he was

task.
If Mr. Waller is really glad that the charges against
him have been brought to the attention of the Grand
Jury he is getting: in line with the general consensus
of opinion. The public is glad, too.
Sending soldiers to the Klondike will be a severe

From all that can be learned there will be plenty

THE JAPANESE RACE.
THE potency of the recent agreement made by
Mr. Dole between the United States and japan
does not depend entirely upon the right of the
Japanese to naturalization in the United State*, Its
essence is their unrestricted right to enter our juris
diction, and this was granted primarily to quiet the
island planters who may have grown cool toward
annexation in the fear that it would subject them to
our labor laws and therefore obsolete their industry by
cutting off a supply of the only form of labor which
it is profitable for them to employ. Naturalization is
merely a collateral issue, but is not without Impor
tance The right to it is held to turn on the race to
which the Japanese belong. We do not permit
naturalization to Mongols, and some annexatioimts
have dismissed the subject by dumping the Japan
ese into the Mongol race. For this, however, there
is no ethnological authority. While ethnologists dif
fer as to the racial rank of the Japanese, none of the
disputants assigns them definitely to the Mongols.
There are two races and their congeners in Japan.
The aboriginal race shows evidence of Malayan origin,
modified by change of habitat. The "Conquering
Race." as they call themselves, have preserved traces
of Aryan origin. Their language has in it features,
indeed, that reveal a primitive farther back than the
Aryan tongue, being probably from one of the re
mot? sources from which that tongue was derived.
In their color, stature and characteristics the con
quering race has marked features in common with
the European rnces and the Brahmins who represent
in India the survival of Aryan blood.
In this country we are commonly familiar with the
type that is modified by mixture with the aboriginal
Japanese, or Amos. The coolies from Japan who
are on the Hawaiian plantations are of that type.
Rut the examples of pure blood in that empire, the
conquering race unmixed with the Amos, show a
stature, facial features and mental mrrhod closely al
lied to the European descendants of the far away
Aryans.
Again, in their cult and philosophy the Japanese
have absolutely nothing in common with the Chinese.
Their indigenous philosophy, Shintoism, mistaken
for a religion, and perhaps serving a religious pur
pose prior to the importation of Buddhism, has no
features, akin to Confucianism. Its gorgeous and
abundant mythology is in parts as dignified as that
of the Greeks, and has certain charms of treatment
of the things of common life unknown to the Saxon
and Scandinavian myths.
If the Dole agreement be made of burning inter
est to us by annexation of Hawaii, there is abundant
evidence that then Hawaii will be the open door
through which the least desirable element in Japan
will enter upon American citizenship. Rut. granting
that our courts will sit as tribunals in ethnology and
decide the Japanese to be Mongols, the more serious
feature of the triple alliance will stand, to our af
fliction and injury. The Mikado's coolies will be
free to come and go, panoplied with all the privi
leges meant by "the most favored nation" clause in
the treaty.
When Burlingame came home in shining feather
as the Embassador of the Emperor of China and in
duced this country into the treaty which opened our la
bor field to Chinese coolies and prostrated white labor
on this coast, a great deal of pseudo Americanism
was exploded among the popping corks which sa
luted his presence in his native land. Anson Burling
ame was hailed as an American who had found
honors abroad and brought to us benefits from far
Cathay. His exploits were extolled as exceeding
those of Give, and Hastings in India or of Sir Harry
Parks in the Daimio rebellion in Japan, and Yankee
pride swelled to bursting over his superiority to these
Englishmen. In a few years, however, this bright
vision passed away and Burlingame was cursed
louder than he had been praised. His policy put the
coolie siphon into us to drain off the wages of labor,
the profits of trade, the gold of our mountains, for
the benefit of China. It endowed us with a laboring
population that fattened where white labor starved,
that brought no support to an American school, or
church, or institution; that introduced new vices and
made old ones leprous in their bestiality.
Now another American, Oligarch Dole, is at our
doors appealing to patriotic pyrotechnics, asking us
to annex a country where half the local tax goes to
taking care of lepers, bringing us a gift, as Bur
lingame did. Let us beware of him and of what he
brings. Human patience here cannot stand another
thirty years' fight against a new coolie experiment.
Rut it is to such a warfare that Mr. Dole's triple al
liance and annexation of Hawaii invite us.
GOLD LOANS ABROAD.
rOR years the American people have been bor
rowers of European money. The great wealth
of the capitalists of the Old World enabled
them to lend it at rates lower than it could be ob-
tamed here, and as a consequence it was to London,
Paris and Hamburg we turned for the funds neces
sary to accomplish our enterprises.
By reason of this condition of affairs the industries
and not infrequently the soil of the United States
were heavily mortgaged to Europe. The amount of
our foreign indebtedness long since became so' large
that accurate computation was impossible. Accord
ing to some estimates it amounts to more than
$1,000,000,000, and there are not lacking authorities
who declare it cannot be'iar short of $2,000,000,000.
This condition of affairs furnished one of the most
fruitful themes of the calamity howler. Every por
tion of the vast concave of the sky that bends above
the United States has been made to reverberate again
and again with the loud voice of the calamity orator
rolling out his tale of woe over our debt to Europe
in cadences as lugubrious and direful as those of the
wolf's long howl on Unalaska's shore.
Recently the tide has turned, and there has been
accomplished something like a revolution in the
financial world. So far from borrowing from Europe,
the United States has begun lending money to that
continent. When the first loans of this kind were
made they were regarded as but evidences of a tem
porary disturbance of the money market, and few ex
pected to see them continue. They have gone on,
however, until they amount in the aggregate to about
$00,000,000, and now the experts in financial affairs
cite them as proofi that our long subordination to
European money lenders is over. American wealth
is at last equal to its needs, and New York has be
gun to rival London as a money center, even as the
United States is beginning to rival Great Britain as
a commercial nation.
The calamity howler who was so indignant over
our indebtedness to Europe in the past is now indig
nant the other way. The Post of this city, which
manages to play the part of a railroad organ and
blew the trumpet of the calamity band at the
same time, is one of this class. In a screaming edi
torial on Tuesday it declared the loans of gold to
Europe were proofs of anything rather than pros
perity. It asserted them to be evidences that our
business is dull, our industries unprofitable, our en- i
THE SAN FB AX CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 13**3.
terprises languishing and our opportunities for in
vestment less promising than those of the Old
World.
It is becoming every day more evident that we
shall have the calamity howler always with us. The
habit acquired during the four years of Grover has
clearly become chronic. To such men everything is
wrong. If we borrow money we are mortgaging the
country. If we lend it we are ruining the coun
try. If we should neither borrow nor lend the Post
would still be indignant, for it would declare that to
be stagnation and cite it as an evidence that the
country is in a condition of total collapse.
In the meantime business goes ahead and the
United States advances with rapid strides to the fore
front of the nations. We shall soon have the finan
cial and commercial as well as the agricultural and
manufacturing supremacy of the world.
VERY little in the way of definite information
concerning the affairs of the British empire or
the policy of the Ministers is ever given to the
public in the speech from the throne at the opening
of Parliament, and the address read on Tuesday
was no exception to the rule. It was about as color
less an official communication as the chief executive
of a great nation has submitted to the legislative body
in a long time.
Her Majesty informed Parliament that her rela
tions with other powers continue friendly, that
Turkey and Greece have arranged a treaty of peace
leaving territorial boundaries where they were at the
outbreak of the war, that difficulty has been found in
providing for the government of Crete, that disturb
ances exist in the Soudan and in India, that the in
dustries of the British West Indian Islands are suffer
ing, that several reforms of local administration in
Great Britain and Ireland are to be proposed at this
session of Parliament, and, finally, that while esti
mates of expenditures have been framed with the ut
most desire for economy, "the duty of providing for
the defense of the empire involves an expenditure be
yond^former precedent."
It is scarcely necessary to say the statements of the
speech were not satisfactory to the opposition. In
deed they can hardly have been satisfactory to any
body. An address which begins by declaring peace
prevails and all is well and ends with a request for
military expenditures beyond all precedent certainly
requires explanation. Sir William Harcourt very
justly asked for more definite information, on the
ground that so long as the empire has 100,000 men
fighting in various parts of the globe, Parliament
could not congratulate itself on "Pax Britannia."
While the proposed local reforms will probably oc
cupy most of the attention of Parliament and the
British public, the most interesting portion of the
speech from a foreign point of view is that dealing
with the situation of the industries of the West In
dies. The planters in those islands have suffered
from the fall in the price of sugar, and the speech de
clares that the fall "has been artificially stimulated
by the system of bounties to manufacturers and pro
ducers of beet sugar maintained by European
states." To counteract this her Majesty announces
that communications "are now in progress between
my Government and the Governments principally
concerned with a view to a conference on the sub
ject, which I trust may result in the abolition of
bounties."
This is a new step in diplomacy. Of late years
there have been international conferences on all sorts
of subjects from the settlement of boundaries to dis
cussions on monetary systems, but this is the first
time a nation has asked a conference to arrange a
means by which it can save one of its own industries,
without expense, by getting other nations to cease
promoting theirs. Germany and France have derived
wonderful profits in many ways from the develop
ment of the sugar industry among their people, and
it will be interesting to watch the proceedings of
British diplomacy and see what success it has in per
suading them to make a change for the benefit of the
British planters in Jamaica.
Once the Spanish Minister felt called upon to an
nounce that American officials were scoundrels and
thieves. However much basis may exist for this
opinion, it is almost certain that Spanish officials are
not models of virtue, excepting, for the sake of cour
tesy, the Minister himself. Weyler was kept in au
thority after it was plain that he was not simply a
butcher, but a vulgar thief, and had been permitted
to steal himself rich. He has not yet been put in
jail, where he belongs, nor made to disgorge his
loot.
There seems to be no doubt that the wife of Drey
fus was subjected to infamous treatment, and the
world would like to hear about it, not from idle
curiosity, but with a view to learning the truth as to
the sort of justice Dreyfus got. Zola has many ene
mies, but he would materially lessen the number by
exposing the corruption which has sent a soldier to
a fate so much worse than death that there is no
comparison, provided, of course, that corruption has
done this.
One important thing to be considered in connec
tion with the De Lome letter is whether it was writ
ten by himself or somebody else. If he were a dip
lomat of ordinary ability he would never be sus
pected, in spite of the apparent evidence. But in this
emergency it is remembered that De Lome has seized
several opportunities to put himself on display as a
wild and untamable ass.
A Rev. Mr. Harris of California announces that he
is going on the vaudeville stage. All right: go
ahead. If a minister desires to desert the pulpit for
the footlights congratulations are due his congrega
tion. It is the minister who still clings to the pul
pit and make a vaudeville out of it who becomes ob
jectionable.
Russia will not permit England to make a loan
to China, and neither will England permit Russia to
do so. It would appear from this that the game of
dog in the manger is sometimes played on a gigantic
scale.
When a letter is of such character that the writer
feels bound to add as a postscript ''Destroy this" he
would be wise to himself work the destruction and
do it without having mailed the letter.
Even the friends of Captain Delany must admit
that in the glare of publicity he would never be mis
taken for an allegorical figure representing Virtue.
Sam Waller is likely to gather from his experience
as a member of the Board of Education quite a lib
eral education in the matter of morals.
Probably the report that warships are moving mys
teriously means that the Texas is taking another
jaunt across lots.
The Rev. Mr. Rader, in attacking the poolrooms,
has set an excellent example for the police to fol
low.
THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS
The young French violinist, Henri Mar
teau, Is to be heard for the first time in
this city on March 10, when he will ap
pear as soloist with the Symphony So
ciety. He is only 22 years of age and has
already made an international reputa
tion. Some years ago Marteau appeared
In New York and made a remarkable
success. Like all French youths, how
ever, he had to do military service and
the feted artist was recalled from his
American triumphs to don the soldier's
uniform and live the rough life of a bar
racks. He bore the discipline well, prac
ticed the violin in his leisure moments
and a few months ago appeared again
in public in Paris with all his former
success. The only change noted by his
admirers was that his locks had been !
clipped during his military service, and
that his bearing had become soldierly.
Marteau's first New York appearance
this season was with the Philharmonic
Society, and he played so brilliantly that
he was promptly forgiven for looking
more like a soldier than an artist. His
success was enormous. "When he finally
retired from the stage and wa* receiv-

ing the congratulations of a few friends
there arose a noise as of an aporoachin^
tornado in the stone corridors leading to
the greenroom, and in a second or two
there dashed in those two moiuirnentai
artists, Ysaye and Pusrno, followed by
the youthful and slimmer Gernrdy. Th 3
next thing seen was the enveloping of
Marteau in three successive pairs of
arms and the imprinting of three chaste
kisses on his rosy cheeks. Great was the
emotion displayed by "the famous men
and the crowd of satellites which
swarmed into the room in their wake.
All talked at once, endearing terms were
tossed about with surprising freedom and
the triumphant violinist having been
duly feted general attention was benz up
on the violin upon'wh'oh JlTto.au had
played his encore, the Saint-Saens' "Ron
do Capriccioso." It was Ysaye's own be
loved Guarnerius, lent for the occasion.
The Emperor of Austria and
King of Hungary will celebrate in
December, IS9S, the fiftieth^ anni
versary of his reign. On this occa
sion several expositions will be opened at
Vienna in the course of the year. A cul
inary exhibition will open tiip series, and
has already been inaugurated. But the
dramatic art would not have been spe
cially represented uuring these jubilee
fetes had not a committee taken the mat
ter up with a view to arrange some pop
ular performances. For this purpose a
provisionary theater will be constructed
at the top of the Kahlenberg, a moun
tain sufficiently elevated above the banks
of the Danube, and otherwise more im
posing than the little hill which bears
the theater, of Bayreuth and is reflected
In the yellow waters of the Mem. In
this theater 3000 persons can be seated in
the open air, and the prices will be much
reduced. As to the artists, they will be
drawn from all classes of the Viennese
population, and more than three hundred
dilettanti, actors and singers of botb
sexes, as well as the orchestral musicians,
have already offered their gratuitous as
sistance. The theater will be inaugurated
by an apropos performance, entitled
"Fifty Years," and will pass in- review
all the meraora-e events of the reign
of the Emperor Jrrancis Joseph. The mu
sic naturally will play an important role,
and two Viennese composers have taKen
charge of it. The work of a popular the
ater under these conditions will assured
ly be very interesting.
The little town of I T rbania, in the Ital
ian Marches, has awakened to the fact
that it was the birthplace of the cele
brated singer. Crescentini, who was
known in his day as the reviver of the
art of Italian singing. By a decision of
the Municipal Council it has been de
cided to call the street where he was born ;
"Via Crescentini" (Crescentini street). Bi- i
ographers of Napoleon have often re
called the proiound impression that this
admirable singer produced when he ap
peared before the imperial court at the
Tuileries in ISOS in ZingarellTs "Romeo
and Juliet." "Never." say these biogra- i
phers, "wore the arts of acting and sin?- j
ing pushed so far." The entry of Romeo
in the third act, his prayer, his cries of :
despair, his aria. "Ombra Odorata As- j
petta." had such an effect upon Napoleon
and his court that they all burst into \
tears. The Emperor afterward showed
that he was not ashamed of the weak
ness into which he aad been betrayed,
for he bestowed upon Crescentini the or- '.
der of the Iron Crown. The siÂ»ger was
bora at I'rbania in 1766, and died at Xa
ples in 1546.
The historic opera-house of La Scala |
at Milan has from time immemorial been
subsidized by the city. This season the
City Fathers have astonished and dis
gusted the whole community by refusing
to sanction the usual grant, and the dis
gruntled Milanese have made the City
Fathers the butt of endless ridicule in
consequence. II Guerino Meschino, a pa
per published in the Milanese dialect,
prints the following sarcastic piece of
news: "We have reliable information
that the City Fathers have given orders
for a large number of posters which will
bear in large type the information: 'Thea
ter of the Scala, This Evening Closed.'
These posters will be placarded about the
town daily so that the frequenters of the
Scala can still see the name of their be
loved opera-house on the bill boards and
can thus deceive themselves into the be
lief that things are going along as usual.
It is hoped that by this means popular
indignation will be allayed."
An Italian writer, Rafaello Barbiera,
publishes in II Mondo Artistico some in
teresting souvenirs of Mme. Verdi (nee
Strepponi), who died recently. One story
in particular illustrates the affection that
existed between the aged composer and
his wife. Giuseppe Verdi and Mme. Verdi
were entertaining a few friends, includ
ing- the writer of the anecdote, at their
villa of Sant' Agata, when it was decided
to take a row upon the lake that Verdi
had had dug: in a part of the grounds. In
stepping into the boat Mme. Verdi slipped
and fell into the water, overturning the
boat above her head. In the twinkling of
an eye the old master dashed into the
water and swam ashore with her. Every
one present was touched by the remark
able energy and tenderness shown by the
old composer. Xo one outside the villa
heard of the accident at the time, for
Verdi, who has a horror of publicity,
begged his guests to say nothing about
the involuntary ducking.
On the occasion of the new year M.
Gallo. the new Minister of Public Instruc
tion in the kingdom of Italy, sent a tele
gram to Verdi, in which he expressed his
congratulations and a hope that he might
still offer to his country another work
of his genius. To this telegram Verdi re
plied in a dispatch couched in these
terms: "The courteous words of your
Excellency awake in my soul a sentiment
of profound gratitude. 1 only wish I
still had the power to fulfill the hope
they express, but my Â£4 years do not
consent. I send him back, on whom
youth still smiles, the most fervent feli
citations."
Ysaye and Pugno, at present in the
East, always go about in pairs with ac-
companiment of Jean Gerardy. Both are
weird in the matter of shirt fronts, and
both leave the bounds of reason far be
hind when it comes to waistcoats and
neckties. Thtir white dress ties are
things fearful and wonderful to be
holdâconstructions of linen more or less
mussed, four inches broad and tied in
huge flaunting bows at the joining of
their low-necked collars.
Music in Australia is a curious thing,
according to the Sydney Bulletin. That
newspaper gravely announces: "The
other night at Sydney they gave, in the
vice-regal presence, a cantata. There was
a chorus and orchestra of 300 performers
and a descriptive chorus, 'Australia,' in
which the howl of the dingo, the scream
of the cockatoo, the kookaburra's laugh,
the hop of the kangaroo and a native
corroboree were introduced. During this
performance Sam Poole, the well-known
comedian, cleverly disguised in red shirt,
white ducks, a woolly wig and blackened
face, introduced a weird native dance."
Verdi, who has been for several days
in Milan, is said to be seriously occupy
ing himself with the publication of dif
ferent religious compositions which he
has left hitherto unedited. Among these
compositions are found several psalms,
and even, it is believed, a grand ora
torio. The publication will be at an
early date. In spite of his recent be
reavement and the sorrow which he has
evidently greatly felt, the old master is
in good health.
On Tuesday evening, the 15th inst., an
attractive concert will be given by Mrs.
Carmichael Oarr at Sherman & Cay >
Hall. Sutter street, for the benefit of the-
Seamen's Institute, especially to procure
money to buy a piano. Mrs. McOavin,
Miss Hulda Anderson. Signor Micho'.en.-i
and several others will assist, and a
double quartet from the Loring Club will
render some part songs.
Emma Nevada, whose successes at the
Opera Comique have made her a favorite

at the Mercadante Theater, Naples.

TESTIMONY
IN NEVADA.
story of a bit of expert testimony that
he listened t,o while there. Some dispute
had arisen between two prominent citi
zens of that metropolis over a horse trada
and, as neither of them happened to be
armed at the time of the quarrel, the
matter -was taken into court instead of
being settled in the manner that such
occurrences are generally wound up. in
the State of sage brush and six-shooters.
As one of the principal points in the
case hinged on the value of the animal
an expert was called in to give his opin
ion on the subject. When he took the
stand he proved to be a long slab-sided
fellow, half cow-puncher and half Yankee
farmer, with a great idea of his own im
nortance and so circumspect in what he
said that it would have been impossible
to have made him give answer as to the
color of a white mule without some res
ervation of his own. The attorney for the
defense had been at him for nearly half
an hour without getting any satisfactory
answer, when the Judge decided to take
a hand himself. "You saw the horse, did
you not?" inquired that dignitary. "Yes, I
think I did," answered the expert.
"Think!" echoed the Judgo. "Don't you
know you saw him?" "Waal, I were a
gazing at 'im fer nigh onto a haf hour."
"Well, will you now tell this court what
you think he should be valued at?" "You
see, Jedge, it air like this. There is
hosses an' hosses, some is good an' most
is no good, an' th' value of a animal de
pen's considerable on how T^ad a feller

he wanted to pay some one ter take him

were willin' ter give up th' whole uve fiis

come to replenish the reservoir* of the
Spring: Valley Water Works. In 1876
the rainfall for the month of March
was five and one-half inches; March,
1879, the quantity was 8.75 inches; the
same month of ISB4. the rain measured
8.24 inches; in March, 1889, 7.70 inches,
and in March, 1897, 4.56 inches.
During the month of April, 18S0, the
rainfall, according to the records in the
Government office in this city, was a
fraction over ten inches; in April, 18S4,
the rain measured 6.33 inches; during
the same month in the year 1886 the
record was 5.20 inches. In April, 1896,
the quantity of rain was 5.15.
The foregoing figures are cited to
show that the Spring Valley people are
crying out the dangers of a water
famine without just cause for appre
hension.
The Mayor and Supervisors of San
Francisco have been assured frequently
by Herman Schussler of the Spring
Valley Water Works that the comple
tion of the extensive Crystal Springs
reservoir provided storage facilities for
a supply of water sufficient to meet the
requirements of the city for three years.
The old notion that the first dry sea

The Spring Valley Water Works ex
pects, obviously, to continue for an in
definite period of time the system long
ago established of compelling the con
sumers of water to provide the corpo
ration with revenue sufficient to pay 6
per cent interest on the cost of the
system as calculated by the company
itself. The valuation, according to the
company's estimate, has now increased
until it approximates 524,000,000. When
new mains are put in to replace old
pipe the amount expended is charged
to construction account and Is included
in the valuation. Land which cost ac
tually $1,000,000 is valued at $4,000,000.
Pumping plants, new reservoirs and
everything added to the system are
figured up and added to the valuation.
If the consumers were asked to pay 6
per cent on the actual value of the
works the burden would not be too
great, but 6 per cent on everything
that has been bought and worn out, to
gether with 6 per cent on everything
purchased new to replace old material,
is an enormous drain on the commu
nity.
Conservative men of large affairs in
the commercial world estimate that the
sum of $10,000,000 would bring from the
mountains to San Francisco an abun
dant and never-failing supply of pure,
fresh water. As a matter of justice,
the consumers ought not to be obliged

The extensive Calaveras watershed
was bought by the company to re

company to utilize its possessions in
that direction, if the president of the

the existing reservoirs may not be ade

A short time ago the company issued
70.00 additional shares of stock, from
which nearly $700,000 was realized. Per

THE FERRY COLLISION.
Investigation Into the Affair by the
United States Inspectors of
Steam Vessels.
The United States Inspectors of Local
and Foreign Steam Vessels began yes
terday an investigation into the causes
of the collision which took place between
the ferry steamers Garden City and the
Piedmont opposite Goat island on Febru
ary 3.
Captain J. T. Jones of the Piedmont
testified that the fog was very thick, and
that when he got opposite Goat Island
he heard the whistles of two different
steamers, one off port and the other off
the starboard side. He slowed up the
Piedmont and stopped twice and then
started to back. At the moment of the
collision his vessel was actually going
backward. He did not catch sight of the
Garden City through the fog until about
five seconds before she struck.
Captain W. Frederickson of the Garden
City said that he left the foot of Broad
way, Oakland, about fifteen or sixteen
minutes late. Going down the creek to
ward the bay ho made up a little of the
lost time and arrived at the mouth of
the creek off the south jetty about ten
minutes late. Then he ran under a slow
belf with the fog whistles blowing. When
near the scene of the collision he heard
whistles blowing off the starboard bow,
but he could not locate the sounds. He
signaled to stop and one minute later
rang the bell to back. Then he rang to
stop backing, and then gave the signal;
to back again. At the time of the colli
sion ' the wheels were revolving .back-"
ward, but the vessel was still going ahead
with the momentum. He heard the back
ing-signal on the other boat just before
the collision.
Several other witnesses were examined
as to the manner of working the engines
and the time that elapsed between the
signals. The investigation will be re
sumed to-day.

DODSON WANTS
HIS REVENGE
The Street Contractor Is
After Justice Carroll's
Scalp.
Wants Him Inu'cted for False
Arrest and Malicious
Prosecution.
Judge Campbell Refuses to Issue the
Warrant, and Dodson Will Go
to the Grand Jury.
Beverly Dodson, the colored street
contractor, is after the scalp of Justice
of the Peace Carroll, and he says he is
determined to have satisfaction for the
indignity of having been arrested on
the complaint of the Justice for per
jury.
On January 14 the Justice and
Dodson had a violent altercation
in the corridor outside the Jus
tice's courtroom over a case in
which Dodson was interested. Dod
son had sworn to an affidavit asking
for a change of venue on the ground of
an alleged remark the Justice had
made, and this led to the trouble.
After the altercation the Justice
swore to a complaint in Judge Camp
bell's court for the arrest of Dodson
on the charge of perjury in swearing
to statements in the affidavit for a
change of venue which were alleged
not to be true.
Dodson was arrested that night and
the case was continued from time to
time, till on January 27 it was dismissed
by Judge Campbell.
Since then Dodson has been nursing
his wrath against the Justice, and yes
terday he, accompanied by his attor
ney, waited upon Judge Campbell and
asked for a warrant for the arrest of
Justice Carroll on the charge of false
arrest and malicious prosecution. He
said that not only had the Justice sub
jected him to the indignity of being ar
rested but had used language toward
him in the hall which was insulting in
the extreme, and had threatened to
break his jaw.
The issuance of the warrant was
talked over and finally Judge Campbell
refused to be a party to it, telling Dod
son he had his recourse in the civil
courts for a suit for damages if he felt
that ho had been injured in his reputa
tion and character.
Dodson pleaded hard for the war
rant, but the Judge was obstinate.
Dodson said that he would try the
other Judges, and if unsuccessful he
would take the matter before the
Grand Jury and get an indictment if
possible. He says that he has plenty
of witnesses to prove the language
which the Justice used toward him
and which has hurt his feelings more
than anything else.

The Men Confined in the City Prison
Receive More Food.
The story in Monday's Call about the
apparent attempt to starve the prisoners
confined in cell 27 in the City Prison has
aroused the Chief of Police to action.
Yesterday he sent for Captain Robinson,
who has charge of the prison, and se
verely reprimanded him for not giving
the prisoners sufficient to eat. Subse
quently Robinson had the prisoners who
complained about him slprn a paper ad
dressed to the Chief of Police exculpating
him frt>m all blame. In it they accuse
the cook, who is also a prisoner,^ of de
priving them of sufficient food.
Yesterday the prisoners were agreeably
surprised when they received double ra
tions and were told if they wanted more
to at once notify Captain Robinson.

WORDEN'S
ACCUSATION
IS DENIED
Harry A. Knox De
clares His Innocence
of the Crime.
Says He Did Not Tell the
Prisoner to Hire a
Team.
Makes a Signed Statement De
nying Complicity With
Worden.
RELATIVES ARE TO BLAME.
Infeenity Commissioners Visit Wor
den in His Cell at
. Folsom.
The first I saw of S. D. Worden on
the morning of his return from Chi
cago was when I met him at John
Hurley's cigar store, the corner of
Seventh and J streets. He was full of
whisky at the time and very "loud
mouthed" about what "he" was going
to do. We told him he must not be
talking like that, for it was very easy
to get himself into trouble, but he al
ways replied, "I am the grand organ
izer for the Pacific Coast and I will talk
and do just as I d d please," and it
was none of our business.
We kept him as quiet as we could for
a few days; then he said he was going
down the road to Stockton to organize.
He was gone several days, and the first
I heard anything about him was when
he telephoned to me that he had forty
five or fifty cattle and asked what he
should do with them. I supposed he did
have cattle, as the farmers were donat
ing meat and vegetables for our
A. R. U. restaurant. I told him to
bring them to Sacramento by boat and
I would pay the charges. So that even
ing when the boat was due some of the
boys went to the landing to help him
but he did not come. I did not hear
from him until morning, about 7:30 or
8 o'clock. I was at breakfast at my
home in Broderick when he came in
and told me he had brought up an en
gine and Pullman sleeper with
forty-five or fifty men. I asked him
if that was what he called cattle, and he
laughed one of his demoniacal laughs
and said "Yes." I told him he hadn't
ought to have done what he did, and he
told me I didn't know my business as
well as he did. While on his Stockton
trip he signed my name to a check on
the D. O. Mills Bank for $5 and gave
it to a hotel man, I think at Gait. Of
course when it was taken tp the bank
he was told I had nothing there, so he
brought the check to me and I told him
I had never given Worden or any one
else authority to sign my name in that
manner, but rather than see him lose
his money I would pay it. Worden was
drunk when he came to my house in
the morning.
After I had finished breakfast My.
Parker, Worden and myself started for
Sacramento, and when we got up to
the bridge Worden said a man had
been shot down the river a ways and
he was going down, so he went and
Parker and I went on ovei town.
Worden came up to our room some
time before noon and stayed a few min
utes and went out again. He was still
drunk. That is the last time I saw him
until we returned from lunch, about
1:30 p. m. Then we found him lying
on the bed asleep with his shoes off.
We got him up and he put on his
shoes and said he was going to get a
drink, but he hadn't been gone but a
short time when he returned with a
boy, saying, "Here is a boy with a bill."
I looked at the bill and saw it was for
a team, so I paid it, because I had given
an order to Wheeler to go to Brighton
or near there to Mr. Bowles' ranch to
get vegetables for our restaurant, and
supposed that was where the team had
been.
When Worden says in his statement
it was by my order the team or men
went where he claims they did he tells
a downright lie. He says we deserted
him during his tsial ; that is not true.
We had evidence that we wanted his
brother to use, but he would not, and
it appeared to me as though he did
not care much whether his brother was
convicted or not.
In conclusion I wish to say that
neither Worden nor any one else was
ever used as a tool for the committee,
and if any damage was done it was
done without our knowledge or con
sent. He has made several so-called
confessions, but he never tried to im
plicate the committee before, and it is
my opinion that he has been made to
do it now by his brother, hoping to get
some one into trouble. I believe Wor
den ought to be in the asylum instead
of prison.
HARRY A. KNOX.
This is the answer Knox makes in
defense and explanation of Worden's
accusation that he was the man who
instructed him to hire the buggy the
day of the fatal train wreck.
In not a single line of the signed
statement is there a word which could
be misconstrued as an acknowledg
ment of the writer's participation in
the crime for which Worden is to suf
fer the death penalty as the sole perpe
trator.
Knox, although accused directly by
Worden as the ringleader who super
intended the conspiracy, seems to for
give the condemned murderer for his
grave accusation by doing everything
in his power to establish his innocence.
He went to the trouble a short time
ago to draw up a petition, signed by
the employes of the Sutro Railway
Company, in which he pleaded to the
Governor of the State for the admin
istration of executive clemency.
He claims that one reason why Wor
den was railroaded to prison was be
cause he was a thorn in the side of his
family, and owing to this fact they
would stop at nothing to get him out
of the way.
"I never thought Worden committed
the crime, and I am of the same opin
ion yet," said Knox. "I think that his
own family is as much to blame for his
present condition as any prosecutor
that stood on the witness-stand
against him. They seemed to have
been over anxious to get him out of the
way as he was a foolish, eccentric and
unreliable sort of a fellow and they
were afraid that his battling about the
world on his own responsibility would
involve the family in trouble and pos
sible disgrace. I think that if he had
been sentenced to life imprisonment
instead of to death on the gallows they
would never have lifted a hand to
shield him from the crime of which he
is now charged.
"The prosecution went a little too
far and a trifle beyond their expecta
tions," resumed Knox, "and whereas
they would like to see him behind
prison bars for the rest of his life still
they do not want his blood upon their
heads, as they well know that this will
be the case, as they were instrumental
in getting him into the clutches of the
law."
Knox, upon being asked his ideas as
to who the real perpetrator of the
crime was, replied that he hadn't the
remotest conception, as he had abso
lutely no participation in committing it
and consequently would not give an
opinion, as the public would think
that he was one of the men who were
at the trestle the time of the wreck.
"I will say nothing further than what
is stated in the above letter, and unless
this statement be satisfactory to those
who insist on further information they
will have to construct an interview
from their own imaginations, as I re
fuse to give an additional word which
might bias the people against me."
It is generally believed in Sacramen
to that Worden's confession amounts
to an actual abandonment of the plea
made to the Governor in his behalf on
the ground of the prisoner's insanity.
The Bee last night published the ac
count of a visit made to Folsom by
Dr. F. W. Hatch of the Lunacy Com
mission and W. P. Mathews, secretary
of the. State Board of Health. They
conversed freely with Worden, and
expressed themselves as convinced of
his sanity.
Melvin Hatch, one of the strikers
whom Worden accuses as being prin
cipals in the trestle murders during
the railroad strike, said with an oath
yesterday that Worden was a fool, and
that if he (Hatch) were to be tried
over again for complicity he would
prove a stronger alibi than he did at
his first trial.
A telegram from Co-wles states that
it Is generally believed there that Wor
den was led to confess by the thought
that he could not sustain successfully
the theory of insanity, and that he
would stand better chances by telling
his story and thereby throwing him
self completely upon the mercy of the
Governor.
UNABLE TO ENDURE
UNKIND CRITICISM
Grocer Kirchoff Says the Ex
aminer Building Gives Him
Sore Eyes.
The Guardian of the Peculiar Struc
ture Arre6ts Him for His
Frankness.
Ordinarily B. Kirchhoff is a grocer in
the Mission, but Tuesday night he was a
grocer in Jail. How he happened to get
there is a tale sure to excite sympathy.
Mr. Kirchhoff was standing at the
corner of Third and Market streets and
his eyes fell upon the
structure there known as The Examiner
building. This fact pained them, and the
Kirchhoff voice rose in protest against
the architectural misfit. "That build
ing," he remarked frankly, "makes me
weary." The tone he employed was not
a whisper. It came to the ears of a
special policeman named Kelly, whose
duty is to protect the structure from
damage, and incidentally from adverse
comment. Kelly cautioned the grocer to
be more moderate and the grocer re
peated that a sight of the Examiner
building gave him sore eyes. Then Kelly
gathered him in. No aspersions shall be
hurled at the Examiner building, not if
Kelly knows it. The principle is wrong,
and besides, a well directed aspersion
might knock the building over.
It befell that the case o f Kirchhoff was
called before Judge Campbell. This
Judge is recognized as the modern Solo
mon. He stroked his beard in contempla
tive silence for a moment and then told
the prisoner to go. "I have seen that
building myself," said the wise man of
the woolsack. "The only way to be near
it and escape getting sore eyes is to be
blind."
However, this did not satisfy Kelly,
who asked that the matter go over and
it went over to Friday. Mr. Kirchhoff
being allowed to roam on his own recog
nizance until that time. So the matter
stands. If Kelly can convince the court
that to be offended by the Examiner
building is an offense against the law
there are many citizens who. will cheer
fully chip in to pay the fine and be
grateful that they elude the expansive
and alert ear of Kelly.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. Â».â The tnott notable
fwture of the itock market to-day was the
I strong rally In the last fifteen minutes of
| trading. After 2 o'clock the bears started a
raid, apparently with an aggressive determin
; ation to shake out weakly "margined holdings
: and to reach stop-loss orders. They seemed to
ibe succeeding admirably In forcing down
: prices, declines ranging from 1 to 2 points all
through the list, but the appearance of sup
port at the low level started a covering move
ment which became a rush, and the closing
; was very much like a rout or the bears. Sub
: stantial stays were scored very generally, and
: In a large number of cases earlier declines
'â  were entirely wiped out. The market was one
of ups and downs all day, the opening show
1 Ing numerous signs of heaviness In spite of a
higher range of prices . reported from London
The bulls promptly offered support and rallied
: the market, holding the advantage up to noon,
â¢when a tendency to realize sent the prices
downward again. The Cuban situation dis
couraged aggressive tactics on the part of the
bulls, the .professional tr&aers being disposed
to realize all day. There was some decreased
volume of business also and a falling in out
' side interest. The declines, however, brought
' out good buying. Union Pacific securities were
| all quite strong, the advance apparently being
j due to a belief that the reorganization had
' concluded to secure the Kansas division even
i at the Government's own terms.
! Great Northern preferred was conspicuous
for a reaction of nearly four points from its
recent remarkable advance. Money continued
to rule below 1' per cent for call loans and
there were reports of large loans for a year at
3% per cent. The withdrawal of the 10 per
cent installment of the Government deposit of
Union Pacific payment was reflected on the
credit balance at the clearing-house for the
Rub-Treasury of $682,100. The Sub-Treasury
has been having a dally aeblt valance at the
clearing-house of $600,000 or upward for some
time past.
The plethora of money was not appreciably
! relieved by the operation. Bonds showed a re
actionary tendency in sympathy with stocks,
but prices for bonds for the most part held
firm. Total sales $4,230,000.
United States old fours coupon and the new
fours registered wer"e H lower bid.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 9â The : early ; market for
wheat , was rather colorless. , May opened at a
shade under yesterday's closing price,' first
trades being made at 96H@96Â»4c,' but â  the mar
ket was steady and ' held for j awhile |at these
figures. 6 Then It slowly advanced to 96%@96?ic.
The early news. If anything, ; favored ' a s de
cline. Early Liverpool cables showed about
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1898.
7 <>d advance, hardly a full response, to yester
day's advance here. Northwest receipts were
liberal. â¢ Yesterday's export engagements were
finally put at fifty-four boatloads,' and a con
tinuation of the demand was looked for by
some at the opening, But on the contrary New
York reported cables bringing In no buying
orders and adding that Argentine offerings
were expected to increase shortly. This news,
however, had haruiy any effect on the market.
There was a well-defined rumor in circulation
that a sharp up turn was part of the Leiter
programme for the session, and this undoubt
edly kept many bould-be sellers aloof. The
market settled back to about the level of the.
opening prices, then gradually gathered
strength, with the trade much larger and more
general. New York put to-day's export busi
ness at twentn-flve loads. May reached 97c
about half an hour from the close. There It
remained for a few minutes and then suddenly
collapsed. During the advance there had been
heavy selling from some uource. This was
easily taken care of for a t!me.Â»but finally the
crowd turned tail and selling orders came in a
flood, breaking the market in the last fifteen
minutes of the session from 97c to 95%'596e.
The heavy liquidation was credited by some to
Leiter or Cudahy and by others to large St.
Louis Interests. May closed weak and nervous
at 95%@96c.
Corn ruled moderately active and firm most
of the session, the market being especially ac
tive toward the close. May closed a shade
higher.
Oats were moderately active. May closed a
shade lower.
Provisions were very active and new high
records were made for the yenr. Packers were
good buyers on soft spots and shorts covered
freely. The advance was In spite of large hog
receipts. At the close May pork was 17% c
higher. May lard 5c higher and. May ribs 7%c ;
higher.

COUNT AND COUNTESS DE GOETZEN.
ceptionally brilliant Washington sea
sen.
The groom. Count Adolph de Goetzen,
is a great-grandson of the Count of the
same name, who was aid de camp to
Frederick the Great and a grand
nephew of the Governor of Silesia, who
saved that place to Prussia against
the arms of Napoleon I. Aside from
his great wealth and noble descent the
young Count is entitled to considera
ble distinction on his own merits. In
ISS3 he headed an expedition which
penetrated intÂ» the center of the unex
plored portion of Africa, and which
pave him the matter for the book he
subsequently published, "Africa From
East to West," and which was the
means of procuring for him decorations
from all of the geographical societies
of Europe.
Count de Goetzen came to this coun
try about a year ago as military at
tache to the German legation at Wash
ington, where he met the '-harming
woman who is now his wife. Be
fore her marriage the bride was Mrs.
ISlay Stanley Loney Loy, a celebrated
beauty of Baltimore, and widow of
"William Loy of "Washington.
In appearance she is a dainty blonde
with a wealth of beautiful golden
hair and a complexion whose loveli
ness has been the toast of Baltimore,
Washington and New York.
The marriage was entirely a love
affair, as, aside from her own charm
ing personality, the bride brought
nothing to her wealthy and distin
guished husband.
The Count and Countess will only
remain on the coast a short time,
when they will return t,o Washington,
whence they will almost immediately
sail for Berlin, which will be their
home.

LAST VOTE
MAY FIX
THE RATES
Oakland Will Decide
Her Water Ques
tion To-Night.
Two Ordinances Are to
Be Brought Before
the Council.
One Is Said to Be Liberally
Besprinkled With Little
Jokers.
ALL LOOK TO PRINGLE.
Votes Appear to Be About Evenly
Divided Between the Two
Ordinances.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 9.
The safety of the Oakland water rate
payers from a return to an old rate
is not yet assured. To-night the Ordi
nance and Judiciary Committee met
and carried the measure a step fur
ther. There are two ordinances now
before the Council. One is the ordi
nance of last year, amended in two
particulars, which have been proved
by the company's figures to provide a
liberal income. The other is the one
that Mr. Cuvellier said is "full of
jokers," and was kindly prepared for
the Council by Mr. "Watkinson of the
Contra Costa Company.
The majority of the Water Commit
tee have submitted their report to the
Council. Its import is fairly represent
ed by the following paragraph:
According: to the representa
tives off lie Contra, Costa, Water
Company and the Oakland
Water Company , namely,
:Â»1 Watkinson and IHn
â p;(>e, had the Contra. Costa
Water Company charged full
rates during: the year its reve
nue would have been $170,000.
That of the Oakland Water
Company would have been
8175, 186. This would have
been a total revenue of 8351,
186, which would l>emore than
6 per cent on the estimated
cost of the works, $ â 1.243,577,
in addition to allowing; the
company its operating ex
penses. These being? the con
ditions under the present rates
of the 1807 ordinance we are
of the opinion that these rates
should be maintained for the
coming; year lÂ»ep;iiiiiinjj .July
1, 1808, and ending .lime 30,
1899.
The report also recommends that as
Superintendent McClymonds says there
Is a waste of water in the schools a
rate of 1 cent a month per child be
made.
This report is signed by Messrs. Cu
vellier, Rowe and Upton. A minority
report was submitted by Messrs. Hen
nebery and Karl. Both ordinances
were read and it was decided to rec
ommend the ordinance of 1897 to the
Council -with the increase of the hy
drant rate from $1 75 to $2, and to allow
a little more from the public schools,
amounting to about $1000 per year.
Mr. <Jirard gave notice that he might
wish to offer some amendments to the
Council when it met to-morrow night
to take final action on the rate ordi
nance.
It now looks as though President
Pringle might have the deciding vote
between the two ordinances. There are
eleven votes in the Council. Messrs.
Rowe, Upton, Cuvellier, Girard and
Brosnahan are said to be a unit for the
ordinance of last year as amended and
recommended by the committee.
Messrs. Hennebery and Earl have re
commended the ordinance prepared by
the water companies, and Messrs. Fi
bush and Watkinson have not declared

themselves, and Heltman voted with
the Water Committee majority to-night
but gave notice that he might not do
so to-morrow night. Should the last
named five combine on the ordinance
recommended in the minority report
President Pringle would have the de
ciding vote. His name is called last on
the roll, but his position is decidedly
interesting.
MURDERERS MUST HANG.
Worden, Ebanks and Hill Must Give
Up Hope in the Courts.
Attorney-General W. F. Fitzgerald re
ceived from Clerk James H. McKenney of
the Supreme Court of the United States
the remittlturs in the cases of Salter D.
Worden, Benjamin L. Hill and Joseph J.
Ebanks, yesterday, from Washington, D.
C. The judgments of the Circuit and
District courts were affirmed. Nothing
now can save their necks but the act
of the Governor.
In the cases of Ebanks and Hill Deputy
Attorney-General Henry E. Carter, act-
Ing under instructions from Attorney-
General Fitzgerald, who handled the
State's interests in opposing the appeals
to the highest court from the denial of a
writ of habeas corpus, will appear in the
United States Circuit and District courts
this morning and move the machinery
of these tribunals to set the State Su
perior Courts in motion by which two of
the men will be brought before the
Judges of Alameda and San Diego coun
ties and resentenced. In the case of
Worden this formality will not be neces
sary, as in his case, the Governor hav
ing reprieved him until June next, he will
be permitted to live until that time.
RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS.
Appointment to Fill the Vacancy on
the Board Will Soon Ba Announced
by the Governor.
Governor Budd remarked yesterday that
he would probably announce the appoint
ment of a Railroad Commissioner to fill
the Stanton vacancy within the next ten
days. The papers and indorsements ac
companying the various applications will
be examined this week. The bundle of
documents is quite formidable In size.
After the inspection of papers personal
interviews on the subject will take place.
The health of the Governor is so much
improved that he feels in condition to
stand another siege.
FROM SOCIAL ROUT
TO SOMBER COURT
Jealousy's Pang Does Some
Lively Business in the Jack
son Family.
A Powell-Street Function Which
Led to the Frantic Scattering
of Wool.
The Jacksons are not unknown to fame.
They are two people the color of choco
late, and they do a variety turn in the
theaters from New York to San Fran
cisco. In rough songs and dance 3, in
bucking and winging, the Jacksons are
hard to beat. Mrs. Jackson is pretty in
a dark and effective way, and Jackson
occasionally feels a pang of jealousy
shoot athwart his manly frame. He has
felt this pang often since beingin the city,
for beauty is appreciated here, and just
a single pang too many took him into the
Police Court yesterday.
It seems that the Jacksons had been in
vited to a high-toned function and had
accepted. There Mrs. Jackson was the
belle of the ball, or rout, or whatever it
was, and Jackson got tired. He made
her go home, and on the way there was
an interchange of remarks. The Jack
sons are living at 303 Jessie street, a
thoroughfare devoted to the ways of
After they had reached their
lodgings the wool began to fly.
"Madrid," said Bniy, "I don't like to
see you makin' up to them yeller coons
on Powell street. I done think you has
bettah sense. Foh 2 cents I'd carve dem
particulah niggahs."
"Go 'long about youh business, you fool
moke." responded Madrid, with spirit.
"Doan 1 you s'pose I know what's the pro
pah conduct foh a lady?"
Details are lacking, but it was at about
this time Madrid snatched a strip of
ebon hide from the face of Billy. Uproar
ensued. No motion of the agile William
in the superlative bliss of winging ever
approached the activity he displayed in
getting away from the claws of the
haughty and indignant Madrid.
In due time the case was dismissed by
Judge Low. liilly was there with his
damaged face, but when the judicial eye
was turned upon Madrid, taking in her
loveliness, he could not be harsh. "Don't
light with Madrid," said the Judge. "Not
but that she's worth lighting for, but you
might get licked, and think how the
stage would suffer while you were in the
hospital."
Billy and Madrid walked away together
with such grace that they could almost
be said to have cake-walked. But no
Powell street coon came upon the scene,
else there might have been a tragedy.
CARTOON OF THE
"LAST SPIKE"
Prints of the Original Used at
Washington Without
Permission,
Thomas Hill, the Artist, Will Protest
to Senators Against tha In
fringement.
It has come to the knowledge of Thomas
Hill, who painted the "Last Spike" pic
ture, that P. Cqst&Sglni's design for a
cartoon of the new historic freize of the
national Capitol bears a striking- similar
ity to the original 'Hill painting. The
time is identical; the grouping is only
slightly changed; the prominent figures of
Mr. Hill's pictures are represented in the
cartoon. One can see at a glance that the
original picture or a photographic copy
thereof was used by the Italian artist at
Washington.
Thomas iJill, who is now at the Palace
Hotel, having just returned from Oregon,
was advised some time ago of the in
fringement, but was not able to get a
copy of the cartoon until he paw it re
produced in the Oakland Enquirer of
January 2'J last.
The "I,ust Spike" painting is the prop
erty of Mr. Hill. It cost hjm many years
of work and many thousands of dollars.
A true history of all the trials, troubles
and vicissitudes of the artist in group
ing the chief characters, in painting out
some who had lost favor at railroad ncad
quarters and painting in others who had
gained recognition in that quarter, would
make a pathetic chapter in the annals of
California. The artist was never paid
for his work. He never received a dollar
of all the money derived from the sale,
on the railway lines, of photographic
copies of the painting. He is now too
much broken in health to make the jour
ney to Washington to protect his rights
in that quarter.
The facts in the case of infringement
have been submitted to the Bohemian
Club, of which institution the artist is a
life member. United States Senators Ste
phen M. White and George C. Perkins,
who are also members of the club, will
be asked to protect the artist from the
proposed infringement.
The original painting is now in the
museum of Golden Gate Park, and will
probably remain there until the artist
makes a final disposition of the work.
Robbed of Her Diamonds.
Mrs. Eva Gardnier, a middle-aged wom
an, last night reported to the police that
Tuesday nirht a strange man whom she
had met robbed her of several diamond
rings and a gold watch studded with
diamonds. Slie was intoxicated at the
time.
WONDERS OF
ISLAND LIFE
A Cargo of Queer Speci
mens Secured by
N Scientists.
Sixty-Nine Tortoises of Seven
New Varieties Were
Found.
Return of the Rotheohild Party From
a Long CruiÂ«Â« In the Galapagos
Islands.
At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
schooner Lila and Mattle tied up to the
Mail dock after an eight months' cruise
among the Galapagos Islands, almost
directly under the equator.
Last June the vessel was chartered
from Kittredge & Co. by the Frank
Blake-Webster Company of Boston,
acting for Baron Rothschild of Lon- j
don, for the purpose of carrying a col- j
lecting expedition to the almost un- j
known islands in search of new species j
of bird and reptilian life, and especially j
after giant tortoises, or galapagos, j
from which the group of islands is j
named. These tortoises are very rare
and almost extinct, and as Baron >
Rothschild is an enthusiastic scientist \
and is engaged In writing a book on
cheloneons he was desirous of securing
such specimens as would be of assist
ance to him in his work.
C. M. Harris was in charge of the
expedition, and with him as assistants
were G. B. Hull, F. B. Droune and R.
H. Beck, all specialists in various nat
ural history circles. The schooner was
commanded by Captain Linbridge, with
Otto Lempke as mate, and a crew of a
steward and two men. Provisions were
taken for a fifteen months' cruise, and
all preparations were made for a thor
ough investigation and exploration of
the islands.
RETURNED FROM TROPIC SEAS.
Tbe Schooner Lila and Mattie Gets Hori)e After an Eigbt Montbs'
Cruise.
UNLOADING TORTOISES AT TF|E DOCK-
How well the expedition succeeded
can best be told by giving the results
as they were seen yesterday when the
schooner docked. Sixty-nine immense
tortoises, all alive, were taken from
the hold and placed in the warehouse.
These tortoises are of seven distinct
varieties, some of them bring entirely
different from any found elsewhere in
the world. One species is very strange,
with upturned and convoluted shell.
This was found in the bottom of an ex
tinct crater on Duncan Island, and it
is believed by Mr. Harris that he has
taken every one from the island, leav
ing none for future explorers.
The discovery was accidental. The ex
plorer ascending to the top of the old
crater was surprised to see that the
bottom was covered with a heavy
growth of grass standing almost as
high as a man's head. The sides were
so steep that it was very difficult to get
to the bottom, but the descent was fin
ally made and then it was found that
an entirely new species of tortoise In
habited the place. Twenty-seven of
the animals were captured, and it took
an entire week to get them out and to
the water's edge, ho that they could be
loaded on the schooner.
In addition to the tortoises many
large sea turtles -were found and many
new species of iguanas and snakes.
Several bottles of iguana eggs, each
egg as large as a gull's egg, attest the
Â£ize of the reptiles, some of which were
five feet long. A great number of new
birds were discovered. Five distinct
species were taken that were entirely
new to science. There was found a
number of mocking birds, the descend
ants of those left by Darwin in IS4B.
A great number of albatross were
taken, some of them measuring nine
feet from tip to tip of wing. A large
number of albatross eggs were also
secured.
The sea shells of the islands were
disappointing, but several new varie
ties of se^ urchin were found, and a
few varieties of different shell fish that
are new. Captain Linbridge brought
back with him a long vine with/large
pods containing a peculiar bean 'which
grows in profusion along the shares of
the islands. These vines are or such
nature that they prevent the shifting
of the sands and protect the beach. It
is the Captain's idea that if they will
grow here they will be of incalculable
benefit to California coasts, ff He will
give some of the beans to parties de
sirous of making the experiment.
Mr. Harris expressed himself yester
day as being more than pleased with
the result of the expedition. He had
secured much more than he expected,
and felt that the results would be of
great benefit to natural science. He
estimated that his cargo of specimens
was worth fully $50,000. each of the tor
toises being worth $300 on account of
their rarity. The specimens will be
shipped by rail directly to Boston, and
thence transshlped to London. En
route East the party will ma t ke a short
stop in Arizona, and while there they
will take in a new supply of cactus
roots, on which the tortoises are fed.
A large quantity of the roots was
brought on the schooner, and the tor
toises arrived in fairly good condition
considering the change of climate from
under the equator to the present cold
weather of California. But two, of the
entire lot which was captured, died on
the way, and it is expected that nearly
all of them will reach London In good
condition. The bird skins and iguana
skins were carefully prepared and
boxed and the eggs were put in chemi
cal preparations in order to preserve
them.
Mr. Harris will remain In San Fran
cisco for about a week before he leaves
for his home.
AUSTIN GUILTY OF MURDER.
Jury Sends Him to Prison for Life
for the Killing of Jame3
Fannon.
William T. Austin will spend the re
mainder of his days In prison for the mur
der of James Fannon. Such was the
verdict of the jury that has been lis
tening to evidence against the accused
for several days, and the only circum
stance that saved him from the gallows
was that he was intoxicated when he
plunged a knife again and again into the
body of his victim. The crime for which
Ausin will be deprived of his liberty for
the rest of his life occurred In a saloon
at Kearny and Jackson streets. Austin
had been drinking and was very quar
relsome. He entered the saloon and im
mediately started a row with Fannon
and a friend, who were drinking at the
j bar. Blows were exchanged and finally
j Austin drew a knife and slashed right
I and left. When the police arrived Fan
non was on the floor in a dying condi
tion, his blood flowing from a number of
wounds. His friend had been severely
cut, but he recovered. Austin was ar
rested and placed on trial for the crime,
lesterday afternoon the case was sub
mitted to the jury, and after two hours'
deliberation It found the defendant guilty
! of murder in the first degree and placed
the penalty at imprisonment for life.
When the verdict was read not a muscle
of Austin's hardened visage changed or
manifested the least sign of emotion. He
will be sentenced by Judge Wallace a
week from Friday.
Miss Ray Frank Lectures.
Miss Ray Frank last night delivered
the concluding lecture of a series given
by her during the last several months
under the auspices of various societies in
this city. Her lectures have always been
attended by a large and select audience
and last night was no exception to the
rule, for the ballroom of Leon Sloss' resi
dence on Van Ness avenue was well
filled to greet the gifted lecturer, and the
appreciation of the listeners was testified
by close attention and frequent applause.
Miss Frank will seek new fields and will
shortly Journey up north to continue her
lectures.
Her subject for the last lecture was
"Nature, the Supreme Teacher. Sne
prefaced her remarks by saying that it
was her intention to deal with art in its
general, or, more correctly, in its uni
versaj sense, not excepting even nature,
which she considered, in the case of man,
the highest art of right living.
TRIED TO DROWN
HIS ADVERSARY
Charles McCarthy a Hostler, Is
Thrown Into a Water
Trough.
Dragged Out by a Citizen as He Was
Fast Losing Conscious
ness.
During a heated dispute with a
stranger at Geary and Larkin streets
last evening Charles McCarthy, an
aged hostler, was thrown into a water
trough and nearly lost hip life. Mc-
Carthy was under the Influence of
liquor and as he walked along Geary
street he met the man who attempted
to murder him. After having several
drinks the stranger took umbrage at
some remark made by McCarthy and
threatened to "break his jaw," as he
expressed It. McCarthy at once di
vested himself of his coat and attacked
his adversary. The latter quickly
seized his helpless victim and threw
him into the water trough. Owing to
his intoxicated condition McCarthy
was unable to crawl out of the trough
and was in imminent danger of being
drowned, when a citizen who dis
covered his predicament went to his
assistance.
After considerable trouble he man
aged to pull the half-drowned man out
of the water. Just then Policeman
Barry appeared on the scene, and as
the unfortunate hostler was unable to
take care of himself he arrested him
on a charge of being drunk.
At the City Prison McCarthy was In
terviewed by two of Chief Lees' men,
who were detailed on the case. To
them McCarthy described his murder
ous assailant as being about 40 years
of age with a reddish mustache. He
wore a dark suit of clothes and a
slouch hat. McCarthy is positive he
can identify him in case he is arrested.

MAY LOSE
HIS HAND
Serious Charges Against
Misses Murphy and
Wolfe.
Shocking Tale From an Eight-
Year - Old Colored
Boy.
A Thorough Investigation Is Prom
ised by the School
Board.
"Willie Carter, a bright little colored
boy 8 years of age, is confined to his
home with blood poisoning, due it is
claimed to a beating received at
school, and may lost his hand.
The story as told by Mrs. Carter is
that about six weeks ago Willie, who
was then attending- the Le Conte
School, committed some act of boys'
mischief, and his teacher, Miss Wolfe,
called him up before the class for pun
ishment. Apparently she was afraid
to confront so formidable an antago
nist as an eight-year-old boy single
handed, bo she called to her assist-
ance the principal, Miss Murphy. The
teacher, so the parents say, then held
the child's hand firmly with his fingers
resting on the desk, while- Miss Mur
phy administered several blows; then
they changed about, Miss Murphy
holding the boy while Miss Wolfe plied
the double strap.
A few days later the boy's hand
swelled so badly that he could not let
it hang by his side, and the mother,
thinking he was afflicted with inflam
matory rheumatism, applied some sim
ple home remedies and did the injured
member up in a sling. Instead of get
ting better, however, the boy's hand
grew rapidly worse, and when the ocu
list who is treating him for his eyes
finally made an investigation he found
a number of ulcers had. broken out
over the fingers, and advised that the
boy be placed in the care of a surgeon
at once or he would probably lose one
of his fingers.
This alarmed the parents and Dr.
Osborne was called in. He at once
pronounced the case as blood poison
ing, resulting apparently from extreme
irritation. The boy was then ques
tioned as to what had happened to
his hand, and told of the beating re
ceived from his teachers.
A few days ago Mrs. Carter took the
boy down to the school and asked the
teacher why he had been so unmerci
fully punished, and requested that
some assistance be given toward pay
ing the doctor's bill, as the family
is very poor. Miss Wolfe denied all
knowledge of the affair, and the pupils
when questioned were apparently
afraid to answer, until one little girl
spoke up and told the story substan
tially the same as was related by little
Willie and his younger brother Her
bert.
As Mrs. Carter could not get any
satisfaction from the teacher, she pre
ferred charges against both Miss
Wolfe and Miss Murphy yesterday be
fore the Board of Education, and was
promised that the matter would be
fully investigated.
The younger boy, Herbert, was in
definitely suspended yesterday because
his mother had used "insulting lan
guage to one of the teachers in the
presence of her class." Mrs. Carter
claims that her language was any
thing but insulting, and attributes the
suspension of the boy to spite work.
A Suspicious Fire.
A very suspicious fire occurred In the
barber shop kept by Apistola in the base
ment of the Hamman Baths building last
night. On Tuesday the shop was en
tered by burglars and looted. Chief I,ees
was notified and has since been making
a quiet Investigation. At 1:45 o'clock this
morning fire was discovered in the rear

BUCK MASSIE
TOOK A STAKE
Romped Away From a
Small Field in the Em
eryville Handicap.
Serena and Two Other Warm
Favorites Were Turned
Down.
Thorpe Rode a Great Finish on Falo
macita â Clarando Captured the
Two-Year-Old Event
The Emeryville handicap, over a
mile and a furlong:, the feature of the
card at the track across the bay yes
terday, proved an easy thing for Buck
Mapsie. The Easterner, in at 115
pounds, made quick work of Eddie
Jones, Los Prietos and Flashlight. He
was played down in the betting from
9 to 10 to 7 to 10, and galloping in front
all the way won with Conley holding
him under restraint. In a drive, Eddie
Jones, second choice in the betting,
took second place from Los Prietos by
a nose. The stake was worth $950 to
the winner.
The balance of the racing was
marked by nothing sensational, unless
it was the downfall of three heavily
played favorites. Conley showed the
way by riding two winners.
Caesar Young's pair, Clarando and
Villmar coupled, were pronounced fa
vorites in the betting for the two-year
old event. Clawson quickly showed in
front with Clara;. do, and the young
ster won galloping. In a hard drive
San Augustin, with Cash Sloan up,
nosed Malay out for the place.
The McM&nus entry, Socialist, was
the warmest kind of a thing for the
seven furlong selling run that followed,
his odds being forced down from fours
to 8 to 5. Estro, at odds of 10 to 1,
skipped off in the lead, and, running
like a wild horse, led the 20 to 1 shot
Elidad out in a romp. Mistleton fin
ished in the show. The favorite was
raced off his feet before the stretch
was reached.
Thorpe's superb finish astride Palo- I
macita in the mile and a sixteenth !
selling run was one of the features of
the afternoon. In a furious drive the
last sixteenth he fairly lifted the mare
in winner, less than a length from
Roche. The latter horse took up the j
running after passing the stand, and ''â 
at one time it looked as though he j
â would walk in winner. Nearly all of
the starters in turn tuck a hack at ;
the even-money choice Serena, and j
she was unplaced at the end.
Of all the supposed "cinches" on the i
card Bonita, the favorite for the fifth
event at a mile, was considered the I
surest bet. She led her field to the
stretch and was then fortunate to fin- i
ish in the show. Straightened for the i
wire. Dr. Bernaus assumed the lead,
but opposite the paddock was in turn j
passed by Morlnel, the consistent lit
tle filly carrying the colors of Mat
Storn, and beaten out a neck. Dolore
under the careful tutelage of "Slim"
Spencer, finished fourth.
By Holly's Fortunate was played
down to even money and captured "the
flnaP six-furlong in clever fashion from
a field of twelve. Lost Girl put up quite
an argument at the end, but suc
cumbed by less than a length at the
wire. Major Cook, carefully ridden by
"Slim" Spencer, was guided into the
Bhow.
TRACK ITEMS.
Eddie Burke, the well-known Eastern book
maker, accompanied by Frank Ives, the billlard
lst. were two new faces observed at the track
yesterday.
Fortunate is a freaky sort of a horse. He
will not gallop alone except the reverse way of
the track. By Holly warmed him up on the
Inside track.

Century Hall, 1213 Sutter street, con
tained a large and. fashionable audience
last night, attracted thereto by a dra
matic recital given by Mrs. Robert H.
Kenebome. The lady "showed herself to
be a thorough mistress of the art of elo
cution and evinced talent of a high or
der in the rendition of her various num

acter. She was well received, notably in
the recitations of James Whitcomb Rlley.
Mrs. Bdgerton shared the honors of trie
evening with her in the elocutionary line.
The piano playing of Miss Olivia Ed
munds was very meritorious. Miss Maude

well-cultivated voice of great compass
and wonderful power, and she was ac
corded a hearty reception.

KILPATRICK SUSPENDED.
He Must Pay for His Words Against the School
Directors â The Lincoln School Lot Lease
Sent Back to the Board by the Re
corder to Be Acknowledged.
The lease for the Lincoln school prop
erty was offered to the Recorder yester
day, but as It was not acknowledged
it was sent back to the board. On the
face of it there is apparently nothing
wrong; it provides for the holding of
the property by the lessors on consider
ation of the payment of $4000 on the
first of every month, and the secretary
of the board reported that the first pay
ment is already in. The price is more
than the old buildings can possibly
pay, and the wails of the tenants
against the lift in the rent tells a tale
of future emptiness.
There will be a general exodus when
the month of March comes in, and who
â¢will take the place of those who leave
Is what people in the vicinity are ask
ing. By-Borne it is believed that there
1b no intention to attract future ten
ants to the place, but the scheme is
to clear the place to make way for
some one who has hitherto been in
the background. Ten years is a long
time in the history of Market street,
and a shrewd corporation could eas
ily afford to lose money for a few years
to secure the benefits which would ac
crue to the ownership of a big piece of
property in the center of the coming
business section of the street.
The tenants claim to be in ignorance
of the men who compose the syndicate
that is playing fast and loose with
their profits; all they know is that they
have the choice of pay or move, and
there are not many who will pay. The
Red Front, a dry goods house owned
by A. J. Prager & Sons, was raised $200,
the highest of any of the tenatns, but
Prager did not let the grass grow
on his efforts in his own behalf,
and he has made an agreement with
the syndicate that will enable him to
Btay where he is. He bid for his own
place in the first competition, but he
was not allowed to compete against
those who bid on the whole lot. The
Creamerie restaurant, too, has made
some sort of an agreement, and it will
stay, but the other places along Market
street will all be vacated if the present
intentions of the occupants be carried
out.
At the meeting of the jury to-day the
lease will be discussed.

BIBB TELLS
HIS STORY
IN COURT
His Experience With the
Man Who Had a Pull
With Colnon.
Startling Testimony Given in
the Harbor Commission
Case Before Judge
Belcher.
It was predicted in The Call of yes
terday that the appearance of D. H.
Bibb on the witness stand would be
followed by sensational disclosures,
more pointed and pertinent than any
thing previously developed in the cor
ruption and collusion case brought by
the Parafflne Paint Company against
the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners. The testimony drawn from
Mr. Bibb was precisely in line with
the facts as anticipated by The Call,
though he had declined to confirm them
for publication In any quoted form un
jtll he had been required to do so in
court. His sensitiveness on this score
may be readily appreciated after hav
ing observed the play of the effort to
â withhold from the court and the pub
lic all information of importance to the
one, in determining the issues legally
Involved, and of grave concern to the
other, in arriving at a verdict as to
how seriously the official trust of the
Harbor Commission has been violated
by the humbug contract system so long
in force and operation.
Mr. Bibb' was asked if he had seen
any other person in connection with
the matter of supplying lumber to the
board after Mr. Colnon had assured

members of the board has resulted In
the suspension of Kilpatrlck, and with
in a short time there will be an open
trial of his case before the board.
He was suspended at the meeting
held yesterday, and with him was sus
pended D. E. Stanton, from whom he
said he heard the charges.
The committee on rules took the
for yesterday afternoon before the reg
niatter up at a special meeting called
ular meeting of the board, and after
hearing what Kilpatrick had to say it
was decided to recommend his sus
pension. This was done by the board,
which afterward included Staton in
the penalty.
Sentence of suspension is coming
hard to Kilpatrick, and he vows he will
get even with Director Ragan, whom
he blames for his trouble. He was at
police headquarters after the meeting
of the committee and he procured a
star as a special officer, at the same
time talking of warrants for the ar
rest of various Directors and any num
ber of charges to fit what he claims are
their derelictions. He claims the star
as an aid to keeping the peace among
the scholars of his school.
It was the report of the Committee
on Rules that brought the matter be
fore the board, and although there
was some discussion on the merits of
the procedure suggested, it was not
prolonged and a very few moments
sufficed to consign Mr.. Kilpatrick to
partial oblivion pending an investiga
tion by the board. The report of the
committee was as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Education,
City and County of San Francisco;
Gentlemenâ Your Committee on Rules
begs leave to submit the following re
port:
Whereas, The attention of your com
mittee was forcibly directed, by reason
of their widespread publication in the
newspapers of the city and county of San
Francisco, to certain charges and state
ments made by one, E. C. Kilpatrick,
principal of the Business Evening School,
reflecting seriously upon the honor and
integrity of certain members of this
board, your committee feeling- that the
Importance of this matter to the School
Department of the city and county of San
Francisco, demands prompt action at its
hands, did call a meeting of said commit
tee for WedneFday, February 9, and did
summon said E. C. Kilpatrick before it
to prove his charges or explain away
the statement? attributed to him if false*.
And your committee, having so met and
the said Kilpatrick having appeared be
fore it, after a full hearing, your comm
him he was to begin doing so the fol
lowing Monday.
"I did," he replied, "the next day."
"Who was that person?"
Another objection by Mr. Stratton
was overruled and the witness replied,
"William Inglis."
"Where did you see him?"
"At my office, 4 Sutter street."
"What did he say to you?" inquired
Attorney Sullivan, who was conducting
the examination.
"He came into my office and demand
ed that I pay him $250 monthly. I
asked, "What for?' and he said for se
curing the trade of the Harbor Com
mission. 'What have you to do with
that?' I asked. 'I have a pull on Col
non,' he answered, 'ana unless you give
what I want you can't have the trade.'
I said I wouldn't do it. Then he made
the proposition that I give him half
the lumber. He wanted to purchase
half the lumber and pass it through our
books to the commission. I refused
again. He went out of the office say
ing, 'Then you won't get the trade.' "
The following day, the witness con
tinued, or within forty-eight hours,
Colnon sent for him. He saw the chair
man the second time irf the inner room
of the Harbor Commission. Colnon
asked him if he had seen Inglis. His
reply was that he had.
"Have you made any arrangements
with him?" asked Colnon.
"I have not," was the reply, "and I
don't propose being stood up that
way."
Colnon said that Inglis' father was a
very dear friend and he "wanted the
son, Billy, placed." As the witnesss re
membered, Colnan further stated that
the father was on his (Colono's) bond
as surety for the Harbor Commissioner.
"Since that interview, Jn which you !
told Colnon you would not be stood up j
in that manner, has your company '
sold any lumber to the Harbor Com
mission?" was asked.
An objection to this question was
sustained by Judge Belcher, who ex
plained it might be put in another
form, and after twisting inquiries in
keeping with legal forms It was ascer
tained that the Bibb Lumber Com
pany got no lumber business under Mr.
Colnon's executive charge of the '
board's affairs.
Then Mr. Bibb was asked: "Do you
know what became of Inglis after
your last conversation with Colnon?"
"Yes, sir; he went to work for Mr.
Slade. Mr. Slade told me so."
"Did you or your company make any
further attempt to secure business
with the Harbor Commission?"
"Yes, sir."
"Were you instrumental in submlt

ittee Is satisfied that there is sufficient
evidence to establish charges of unpro
fessional conduct, that he should be put
on trial therefor.
Wherefore, your committee would
recommend to your honorable board that
â wnen charges have been properly pre
ferred against the said Kilpatrick for un
professional conduct the secretary of the
board be directed to duly serve the said
Kilpatrick therewith and to have him
brought to trial thereon, and that pend-.
ing the preparation, pendency and trial
of such charges, that the said E. C. Kil
patrick be suspended from his position
in the School Department of the city and
county of San Francisco.
DR. GEORGE DRUCKER,
T. A. BURNS.
A motion for the adoption of the re
port brought Derham to his feet with
a protest against the suspension of
Kilpatrick 'until he had been formally
charged with some definite offense; he
said too that the charges Kilpatrick
had made were under investigation by
tl?e Grand Jury, and he thought the
matter should be left in abeyance un
til that body haa completed its work.
Head followed in a similar strain, add
ing that Kilpatrick should be brought
before the board and be allowed to
prove his charges or admit them to be
false before any suspension should be
imposed. He said Stanton, a special
teacher in the school, from whom Kil
patrick claimed he had heard the
charges he himself had afterward
made, was more a fool than a knave,
but that anyway he, too. should be
heard.
Gallagher stopped the discussion,
however, by springing the rules on the
board and showing where the com
mittee had the power to suspend if It
pleased, and Carew added that it
would not harm Kilpatrick very much
anyway, even if he tvcre suspended,
and so it went to a vote. The report
was adopted. Derham and Head vot
ing "no," and Armer. Waller and Bar
rington being excused.
That ended the episode until later,
when Head wanted to know how Stan
ton was in the department anyway;
he was told that he had been assigned
to special duty by the chairman of the
Committee on Evening Schools and
without action by the board. Head
declared that he would notify the Au
ditor that such appointments were not
legal and would warn him not to pass
the warrants of such appointees, and
then Barrington came down from the
chair and moved that the chairman of
the Committee on Evening Schools Dr
Ragan, be directed to suspend ' Mr'
Stanton from duty. This motion was
carried, and it contained no clause lim
ning the suspension until a hearing
bosfrd*" 8 f Â° r the Sale Â° f lumber to the

Witness then explained his interest
in the proposals submitted to the board
at the time Slade was awarded the con
tract last spring for a year's supply
2* lumbei " at the lowest market price
This, it will be remembered, is the slip
shod contract with the Dundon-Slade
combine under which so many extor
tionate lumber bills hmre been paid
and which finally provoked the Pacific
Pine Company suits which were com
promised out of court.
The Slade bid waa to furnish at cur
rent prices, beginning at the price quot
ed in the lowest bid. Only a short time
after they began to serve the board
under this fat and loose contract, they
pegged up the prices, until the board
was paying almost double the amount
stated in the lowest of the Bibb bids
as well as that of the Pacific Company'
Eventually, out of this crooked work,
came the inquisition proceedings on the
part of the Pacific Company, which
were compromised on the basis that
the Slade Company be allowed to col
lect their bills from the board; that
they buy their lumber thereafter from
the Pacific Pine Lumber Company, and
that from the same company, the Dar
by Laydon feeder of the Dundon com
bine, take its piles.
Mr. Bibb explained in the cross-ex
amination that had he secured thÂ»
lumber contract at $7 40 it was not his
purpose to hog the business, and that
the trade would have been shared with
others legitimately engaged in mer
chandising lumber. It was further de
veloped by the cross-examination that
the scheme implied by the proposition
of Inglis to work the Colnon 'pull" if
Mr. Bibb would divide the lumber
business of the board with him, was
such as might involve a reputable firm
in serious trouble. It would enable In
glis, for example, to take a requisition
for Bay 2500 feet of lumber and put in
a bill for that amount through the
Bibb company, although, as a matter
could be had; it only provided for the
suspension, and it looks as if Mr.
Stanton's place was vacant. Several
directors expressed that intention !
when they voted, but the suspension j
is indefinite, and it is not probable it
will be removed.
No date was set for the hearing of
the charges against Kilpatrick.
Dr. Ragan then rose to a question of
privilege. He referred to the accusa- <
tion which had been made against him .
and he demanded that the board ap
point a time when the matter could be
thoroughly investigated. He said that
in defense of his good name it was im
perative that the board meet in com- j
mittee of the whole and investigate the i
charges. Then Hammond got up and j
made a similar address, but Mr. Carew i
came to the rescue by saying that the
regular meeting was no time to bring
such matters up, and he advised that j
they be left until the committee of the I
whole met. Dr. Ragan helped to soothe i
Hammond by saying that at no time i
did he consider any of the publications
referred to Hammond, and then the
meeting adjourned.
A queer freak of the law has been
discovered, in the sections relating to
bribing officials and officials accepting
a bribe. Under the Penal Code an
official who asks for a bribe is guilty |
of a felony. Under the statutes of 1893 |
a School Director who asks for and re
ceives a bribe is guilty of a misde
meanor. The indictment against Wal
ler will charge him with felony, but
had the accusation gone a little further
and declared that he had accepted !
money the best the Jury could do ,
would be to charge him with a mis- i
demeanor His indictment vill oe pie- I

BARRINGTON FEARS HARM
Alarmed That Principal Kil-
Patrick Will Attempt to
Kill Him.
President Barrington of the Board *>f
Education fears that an attempt will
be made to kill him. Last night a rela
tive of the School Director visited po
lice headquarters and asked Chief Lees
to detail an officer to protect Barring
ton. He claimed that Principal Kil
patrick had made some ugly threats
against the president of the board, and
he asked that an officer be sent to ac
company Barrington to and from
home. Following the usual custom of
appointing principals of public schools
as special officers, Kilpatrick yesterday
appeared at police headquarters and
was sworn in. The relative of Bar
rington learned of this, and, becoming
alarmed on account of the alleged
threats made against Barrington by
Kilpatrick, he visited police headquar
ters and asked Chief Lees to revoke his
appointment. As the Chief knew noth
ing of the alleged threats he refused to I
take any action. He, however, sent an !
officer to accompany Barrington to his i
home.
It is claimed that since the publica
tion of the scandals connected with the
Board of Education, Kilpatrick openly
asserted that Barrington was against
him, and that he intended to get even
with him. His remarks, it is said, have
been construed as threats against the
life of the president of the board, and
to prevent him from injuring Barring
ton the latter's relative appealed to the
Chief of Police for protection.
I
!of fact, only 1000 or 1500 feet might
have been furnished.
Attorney Stratton, in endeavoring to
i show that if Inglis had approached Mr.
: Bibb on the basis of securing commis
sions on sales to the board the proceed
, ing would not be unusual, only forced
j a renewal of the explanation that In
| glis did not come to witness as a com
mission dealer or broker, but as a per-
I son who "had a pull with Colnon." In
: glis said he wanted the gratuity named
; or consent to the equally obnoxious al
; ternative proposal, else Bibb wouldn't
j get any trade from the board.
Witness frankly admitted he wouldn't
have dealt with anybody on any terms
, after Colnon had voluntarily offered
i him the lumber business of the board,
, but said he would not have dealt with
| Inglis on any terms to have secured
; the business.
Cross-examination also developed the
fact that about three weeks after the
Colnon-Inglis incidents Mr. Bibb re
ported the circumstances to Governor
Budd at the Palace Hotel. Governor
Budd was emphatic in his denunciation
D. H. 8188.
of the methods exposed, and suggested
to witness to bring an action that
| would lay the whole matter bare. On
i reflection Mr. Bibb had decided not to
stlr , _ UPU P the mess. When asked if he
I could explain why he had not followed
j the advice of the Governor witness said
he could; but at this point Judge Bel
cher reminded counsel that so far as
the chief executive of the State was
concerned questions put to witness
could not have the latitude allowed in
I other directions. An attempt to inject
I Mr. Bibb's correspondence with the
Governor into the record was also de
nied by the court.

ber Company books during the exami

AN INTERESTING STORY ABOUT SOME N. Y. MILLS SHEETS.
" Every experienced housekeeper knows the worth of New Tork Mills Sheets '* and Sheetings. "We have
been most fortunate in securing a "bargain" in this staple line. The manufacturer found one Â» lot of sheeting
had not been thoroughly bleached. He had his reputation to sustain. He must sacrifice this lot. He did. It
was made up into 4000 sheets and sold to us. In turn we offer it to you. Tour saving is as follows:
The cost of one 90x90 sheet would be 2% yards at 22^c. yard ; 55c
The making would cost about ... ...'.. ........... '.. 5c

bondsmanâ whom Mr. Bibb alleges
tried to hold him up for $250 a month,
with the understanding that Bibb
' should have the lumber contracts

I Slade, when Bibb declined to be

i would vouchsafe for the employment

Slade continued to tangle himself
in the mysterious pluralities of the
Slade Lumber Company, but insisted
that he meant "I" when he said "we"
and "our." He could give no satisfac
tory answer to repeated questions as
, to how it occurred that S. E. Slade, if
: he was the Slade Lumber Company, as
j he testified, should have a private ac
count with S. E. Slade in the S. E.
j Slade Lumber Company books. Nor
could he account lucidly for the rec
ords in the Slade Lumber Company
books of important affairs pertaining
to the San Francisco Timber Preserv

I discount items. His misty explanation
was that in the two sets of books, the
j one of his own company, the other of
the Dundon-Slade creosoting combine,
was carried out a system of "cross
entries."
GOV. BUDD'S POSITION.
His Recommendation to Re
vive the Harbor Board
Law.
Three weeks after Mr. Bibb had his
related experience with Chairman Col
non and the man with "the pull," he
looked up Governor Budd at the Palace
Hotel and related the facts. Subse
quently he wrote a letter to the Gov
ernor on the subject. A year after
ward, when the Harbor Commission
had requested informal bids for a
year's supply of lumber, Mr. Bibb again
wrote to the Governor, as follows:
"The board has verbally asked for
bids on lumber, urgent repairs, and I
sent in bid as you advised me. I con
sider that there is 'a nigger in the
fence,' and I would like to see you per
sonally about this matter."
In conclusion, Mr. Bibb asked for
an appointment with the Governor. He
received from the Governor's private
secretary a letter in which it was stat
ed that his request could not be at
tended to at that time, owing to the
pressure of business in the executive
department, resulting from the legis
lative session, the Governor having no
less than 200 bills before him for con
sideration. His letter was filed for
reference, and nothing more came of it.
The Governor was seen at his rooms
in the Palace Hotel yesterday and re
sented.any inference or intimation that
he was made fully cognizant of collu
sive dealing between Colnon and In
glls. He admits that Bibb informed
him that Colnon wanted to take care
of some Stockton friend of his named
Inglis. He advised Bibb that if the
board did not treat him fairly he
should bring an action against them.
That is to say, he suggested to Bibb
that in the event he had the lowest
bid he should go for the board and de
mand the contract. If the board then
rejected his bid the Governor urged '
that he bring suit, promising that he ,
as Governor would stand behind it
Upon receiving the first letter from i
Bibb he referred the matter to the 'â 
Attorney-General, who handed down j
an opinion that under the law the
board could purchase without adver

tising for bids in all save two cases,
neither of which pertained to the lum
ber contracts in question. A copy of
this opinion he forwarded to Mr.
Bibb.
Subsequently, when the Governor de
livered his message at the opening of
the Legislature, he recommended a
complete revision of the board and a
sweeping reform in its administrative
methods. Among other specific changes
he urged:
Whether there be any further change
or not in the water front, I would es
pecially recommend that all bills or
claims contracted or allowed by the Har
bor Commissioners should be subject to
the approval of the State Board of Ex
aminers, and that the latter board should
have power, by unanimous vote, to limit
the number of its employes and fix their
compensation; that all new work on
walls, buildings and other improvements
j under the act of 1876 (except urgency re
j pairs, which could be made on report of
I the engineer to the board), and that con
tracts to furnish all supplies of lumber,
coal and other articles purchased in
large quaritities should be, after competi
tive bidding, let to the lowest bidder, as
is usual in other departments of the
State's government. This board spends
annually $600,000 which expenditure
i should be surrounded by all possible safe
i guards. While the present audit of the
I Harbor Commission's claims may be en
â  tirely free from criticisms, common jus
tice requires that its demands be treated
as are the demands of the other depart
ments of the State, and that all alike
! submit their claims to one common audit
i ing board, the State Board of Examiners.
The Legislature of California, by act
approved March 17, 1891, provided a fund
"for the construction and furnishing"
"of a general ferry and passenger depot"
at or near the foot of Market street, in
the city and county of San Francisco,
and to "cost not to exceed $600,000."
Thereafter the Harbor Commissioners,
proceeding to construct such building,
had plans and specifications prepared and
instead of expending $600,000 thereon, it
contracted for the construction of the
foundation and superstructure as separ
ate and distinct works, and it expended
in the construction of the foundation and
approaches alone the sum of $33G,202 60,
ana will expend in the superstructure,
or what they delight to call the building,
the $600,000 voted by the people. There
can be no question that the intent of the
act was that the buildingâ foundation,
walls, roof, furniture and allâ should
cost not to exceed $600,000, and it would
not have cost to exceed that amount had
the law compelled the Harbor Commis
sioners to proceed under the act of March
23, 1576.
The Governor further was interested
in having a measure in conformity with
his recommendations introduced to the
Legislature and passed. The Harbor
Commission lobby opposed the propo
sition, contending that the present sys
tem was satisfactory, and as a conse
quence the committee having this par
ticular recommendation in charge did
not frame, or, at least, did not intro
duce a bill comprehending its purpose.

To prevent misconception, Lyons says
he will continue to carry on his business
at 721 Market street. In the Bancroft
building, and at 302 Kearny street, but
he intends closing up his old store at
1212 and 1214 Market street, above Sixth
as soon as he can dispose of the goods
which are there. They consist of a com
plete stock of tailors' fine woolens, and
you can have suits of every description
made to order from $9 75 and trousers
from $3 50. The stock is valued at $20 000
and as the premises are rented from
April 1, and nothing will be taken away
everything must be sold out regardless
of price before that date. â¢
