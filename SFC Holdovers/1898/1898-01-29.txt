New York Herald to Sue

Chronicle.
Will See Whether the Copyright
Laws Protect the News Ser
vice of a Great Paper
in America.
NE"W YORK, Jan. 2S.â Under the caption, "To Test the Law of.
Newspaper Copj-right," the Herald will print the following editorial
to-morrow:
"In order to test the question whether the copyright law really af
fords to duly copyrighted news in a daily Journal the legal protection
against piracy which It is generally supr^sed to give, the Herald has
directed suit to be brought in the United States Court in California
against the San Francisco Chronicle for its unlicensed appropriation of
our Epecial cable dispatches.
"In defiance of our protests, that paper has persisted in purloin
ing the Heralds exclusive news bodily as soon as it issued from the
press for publication the same morning In its own columns, a proceeding
rendered practicable by the difference of three hours in time between
New York and San Francisco. As all our dispatches are regularly copy
righted, their piratical appropriation is simply theft of important news
which the Herald has obtained exclusively at great cost and by keen
enterprise. The Herai^. now proposes to ascertain whether the law af
fords any redress for larceny of this species of valuable property, and
it does this In the interest of honest Journalism, as well as for the pro
tection of its own rights.
"The suit is in the hands of able counsel and will be pressed with
determination."
NEW YORK. Jan. 28â For the
past three months the San Fran
cisco Chronicle has been guilty of
appropriating the copyrighted cable
dispatches of the New York Herald,
and will now have to answer for its
pilfering .In the fourts. As announced
In the foregoing editorial,- the H*-ra'd
Is about to institute proceecflngs In the
United States Court at San Francisco
to restrain the Chronicle from continu
ing its practice. As the evidence in the
case Is both overwhelming and conclu
sive, there is no- doubt that the action
will be brought to a successful term!
nation.
The superiority over all oth^r New
York papers of the foreign service and
also the general news dispatches of the
Herald is well established. The ex
cellence and accuracy of the Herald
news have contributed to make It the
foremost newspaper of Greater New
York, and it is being continually
strengthened by its energetic editors.
Some ten years ago the Herald fur
nished the San Francisco Examiner
with its special cablegrams and other
dispatches..
The latter service was not satisfac
tory to Mr. Bennett, and an arrange
ment was made with the Pan Francisco
Chronicle, by which the latter was to
rpcpjve the Herald service in return
for the news of the coast. Mr. Hearst's
paper was cut off from its great East
ern connection, and as a consequence
there was much gnashing and grinding
of t^eth in the office of that publica
tion over the loss of so excellent a spe
cial news report.
The continuity of the Herald's serv
ice to the Chrrrnicle remained unbroken
until the latter part of last year, when
Mr. John D. Sprwkr-ls became the pro
prietor of the San Francisco ('all. The
enterprise shown by the new manage
ment of the paper attracted not alone
the attention of San Francisco and the
people of the coast, but it penetrated
to the East. The Herald is always ex
peditious In making the most desirable
arrangements for the improvement of
its news service In all directions, and
negotiations were at once opened with
The Call with a view to an immediate
affiliation. The negotiations were com
pleted In November last. The service
to the Chronicle was discontinued, and
The Call was given exclusive right to
It for San Francisco. Although The
Call made editorial announcement that
It had commenced to receive the Her
ald's unexcelled cable dispatches from
Paris, London, Berlin, Madrid and
other European capitals, and also in
its complete Cuban and South Central
American news reports, the Chroni
cle continued to print the Herald's
news. It evidently disliked the idea of
depriving its readers of something to
which they had been long accustomed.
In this connection it might be inter
esting to state that Mr. de Young,
when in New York several months ago,
was heard to remark something to this
effect: "It is not necessary for me to
pay for the Herald's news, or that of
any other paper in New York. My man
here can clip the news when the pa
pers appear, and as we have three
hours in our favor it can be sent to
the chronicle in time for publication."
Seeking to protect The Call in its ex
clusive right to the service, the Herald
requested the proprietor of the Chron
icle to desist from the use of the copy
right dispatches. No notice was taken
of this request, however, and the
Chronicle continued its practice { boldly
reproducing any cable dispatches of
importance appearing in the Herald.
Mr. Bennett thereupon served for
mal notice upon Mr. de Young that the
Herald news was copyrighted and that
the Chronicle must cease using It. This
notice, like the Herald's request, was
also ignored. And now Mr. Bennett
The San Francisco Call
has placed the matter In the hands of
his attorneys, with instructions to
bring a suit against the Chroni<iÂ» to
prevent It stealing news which is gath
ered and transmitted to the Herald at
great expense.
POWELL'S ACTS IN HAYTI
REGARDED AS MEDDLESOME.
While No Complaint Has Been Made to the
State Department It Is Said That the
Minister Has Been Duly Cautioned.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2*.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs: It
was learned at the State Depart nu-nt to
day that the course pursued by Minister
Powell in Port au Prince, Hayti, in the
I^ueders Incident was not so satisfactory
tv the authorities as was believed. Thero
has been rrn action looking to thn recall
of Minister Powell, but Mr. Powell. I was
told to-oay, had gone farther in the
Loaders Incident than the department de
sired, and. while no official censure has
been administered, he has been given to
understand that he must be more careful.
It was through the earnest insistence of
Mr. Powell that Lueders, the German
subect, was released by the Haytian Gov
ernment and placed on board a vessel
and sent to New York. WhiU- tho Ger
man Minister at Port au Prince was
satisfied with what Mr. Powell had don*>,
be regarded his action as somewhat med
dlesome. The mater, however, has not
been officially called to the attention of
the State Department by the German au
thorities.

PLOT TO LOOT

LOS ANGELES
COUNCILMEN
MUST ACT
Citizens Are Weary of
Their Repeated
Delays.
Want Consideration of the
Water Question
Expedited.
Public Sentiment Will Be Ex
pressed at To- Night's
Mass- Meeting.
HAZARD WILL PRESIDE.
Syndicated Press Gives No Notice o
the Important Gathering of
the Masses.
Special Dlipatch to ThÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2<vâ The meet
ing which has been called to convene
at Music Hall to-morrow evening will
be one of the greatest successes that
have characterized the popular agita
tion in connection with municipal con
trol,operation and ownership of a water
plant. This afternoon a committee
waited upon Hon. Henry T. Plazard.
and requested him to preside. Mr.
Hazard accepted, and will be the
chairman of the evening.
It is fit and proper that Mr. Hazard
should thus officiate, for no citizen has
the confldem c <^f Bb ,v- plâ¬ to a de
gree greater than has Henry T. Haz
ard. Twice within recent years the
people have elected him Mayor of the
city after he had been nominated by a
Republican convention. During both
terms as Mayor Mr. Hazard gave the
water company the hardest fight it ever
had in its efforts to encroach upon the
rights of the people. He has had expe
rience with the corporation, and he
knowa how to deal with it. The peo
ple know that he protected their rights
once against the grab-it-all policy of
the water monopoly, and the fact that
he has again enlisted la the tight in
their behalf will be pleasant intelli
gence to hundreds of overburdened rate
payers who are pouring their hard
earned dollars into the coffers of the
water company.
Despite the fact that the mass meet
ing was announced yesterday after
nmn, thr> water company's syndicated
three dailies have as yet utterly failed
to give it any kind of mention. The
combined dailies realize that this meet
ing will carry with it the voice of the
people on the water question, and for
that reason they will endeavor in ev
ery way possible to discredit It.
Among other things, it is pmpused to
fVrrm a permanent organization from
this mass meeting, to take the fight of
the people in hand and wage it to a
successful conclusion. The plan is to
designate a committee of public safety,
comprising one member from e;u h
ward and three members at lar^e. This
committee will be the representatives
of the people, and will see to It that
the public servants elected to the city
Council and to other positions in the
City Hall, where they have executive
authority, are faithful to the interests
they are sworn and pledged to protect.
It has arrived at that point where it
is not only necessary for the Council
men, the City Attorney and others to
say that they are with the people In
the water fight, but it is essential that
before the people believe them they
must prove that they are by official
acts and deeds. Windy pledges to pro
tect the people right up to the time a
vote is taken in the Council, and then
casting a vote for the water company
policy of delay and Inactivity are going
to count for nothing in the future. The
people are unanimously of the opinion
that it is high time t. move in these
water negotiations. They are shut off
from the local daily press, and they
propose now to meet in mass conven
tion and express their views of the
people who are holding this matter
back in the City Council.
It is these conditions and circum
stances which not only insure the suc
cess of the mass meeting, but render
it imperative. The idea of appointing
a committee of public Mfety has met
with popular approval on all sides. It
is now a known fact that the syndi
cated dailies can safely be relied upon
to betray the people into the hands of
any monopoly that may come along
seeking a special privilege, and this
committee on public safety, if the plan
is carried out, will be ever on guard
to protect the rights of the citizens.
For the present the sole topic of dis
cussion is the mass meeting, and the
results that will flow therefrom. It is
believed that as an outcome of the ac
tion of the people taken to-morrow
night the City Council will be forced
to do something on Monday in the reg
ular and legal way toward procuring
arbitration as to the price of the water
company's betterments to the city's
plant or place the company In default.
If the company is placed In default
upon the contract, then the city can
proceed to build an entirely new plant,
so asserts competent legal authority.
On the other hand, If the company
agrees to arbitration It must at once
name its arbitrator and the city its
arbitrator.
The two will select a third and the
three will proceed to make an exami
nation of th'> plant ar.'l fix a price on
the betterments. This will consume
six weeks or two months.
Of course the city's arbitrator would
be guided by the city engineer's valua
tion of $1,190,000. But after the arbi
trated price Is reported it will take
three months to vote the bonds, and in
this interim the water company's con
tract with the city will have expired.
So the necessity for immediate action
is at hand and the people realize it;
hence the unquestioned success of the
mass-meeting to force the. Council to
expedite matters.
One member of the syndicated press
â the Evening Express â has been
brought to time by the Newsboys' Un
ion. This paper attempted to bulldoze
the newsboys and force them to pay 3
cents a copy, while the regular price
to all was 2 cents. The newsboys re
fused to pay the price and formed a
union. For two weeks the boys were
as a unit. They declined to sell the
Express, and not a paper was sold on
the street. The Express business man
ager advertised in all the papers for
men and boys to come and sell the
sheet, but not a man turned up. He
agreed to pay them SO cents a night for
two hours' work, no matter how many
papers they sold; but no man nor boy
would sell it. Finally the Express was
forced to treat for peace with the
Newsboys' Union, and the business
manager agreed to sell the boys the
paper for 1 cent a copy. The proffer
was accepted. In the battle with the
newsboys the Express came off second
best.
WEBB TO SUE FOR LIBEL.
Number of Actions to Be Brought Against
the Syndicated Press.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. âWithin the
next week or two the editors and pro
prietors cf the syndicated Times-Her
ald-Express will be led a merry dance
in the courts of t).l[ county, by Walter
I* WeV,>, wlte v.a.Â» bo&i^iitjht' acquitted'
of nil charges brought against him and
prosecuted by the League for Better
City Government. It is a notorious
fact that these three papers have, with
out any foundation in fact, reason or
justice, declared without equivocation
that Webb was a boodler and every
thing: that is corrupt. This they did
during the entire proceedings against
Webb and when there was absolutely
no testimony that even tainted him
with the crimes charged, except the
testimony of two self-confessed bood
lers and perjurers.
Webb was acquitted after a trial in
th.- Superior Court <>f all the charges
that were brought against him, though
the <ose was prosecuted with all the
energy and persistence that could be
Inspired by private and political ani
mosity.
In the course of an interview to-day,
when asked what hÂ« proposed to do
that the School Riard investiga
tion also had resulted in his acquittal,
he said:
"I have been waiting for time before
taking the initiative in proceedings In
regard to the many charges which have
been published and made against me
during the time that this Investigation
has been going on. It is unnecessary
for me now to restate the reasons why
I was picked out by the League for
Better City Government, and by others
for punishment and possibly destruc
tion. The Call has already clearly and
forcibly presented this side of the af
fair to the people of the city of Los An
geles.
A.l the very outset of this School
Board scandal th<> papers of Los An
gelesâthe Times, Herald and Kxpress
â began their attacks on me, and have
kept them up with but little intermis
sion ever since. They have accused
me of all manner and character of
crimes without one particle of evi
dence to sustain their charges, simply
promising from time to time what the
League for Better City Government
was going to bring out before the
Board of Education, and which time
has proved to b^ nothing but the testi
mony, unsupported, of two self-con
fessed perjurers.
"During all this time I have carefully
kept all the articles published against
me or !n my favor. I have these now
arranged, and Intend to use them and
compel the papers that published them
to prove the truth of the charges made.
I shall consult with my attorneys and
shall institute as many criminal pro
ceedings against thfÂ» f-ditors and pro
prietors of these three papers as I am
advised can l>e sustained. They have
already advised me that criminal pro
ceedings can he sustained, in particular
against Mr. Sp.ilrUng. the manager of
the Herald, for the editorial which ap
peared in the Herald on January 21.
"I shall then bring in addition seve
ral civil lihel suits against the Times.
Herald and Express, and shall give
each and all of these papers an oppor
tunity in the Superior Courts of this
county to prove the truth of a single
one of the charges made against me.
but which I know they cannot do, for
I shall thor** prove as I did recently be
fore Judge Van Dyke and r jury in the
Superior Court in this county that I
have been guilty of no offense. . and
that not a single charge can be truth
fully laid at my door.
"The papers will find that it is one
thing to publicly charge a .nan with
the commission of an offense and an
other t. prove it. No paper und no
man claiming to be respectable and
acting in r. spirit of fairness and right
should ever cast a suspicion or make
charges against the honesty of any man
unless they have the facts at their com
mand to substantiate their charge and
prove their assertions. And unless the
Times, Herald and Express can prove
the correctness of their positions they
must of necessity write themselves
down as unrighteous blackmailers.
"These suits will be commenced from

RAISE THE
ENGINEER'S
FIGURES

Is Exposed in an Affidavit
From Ernest Abs
Hagan.
The Water Company's Tools
Try to Drive Him Out
of Town.
A COMPLAISANT OFFICIAL.
It Seems He Thought He Should Do
What the Monopoly Wanted
Done.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28.â The ex
pert civil engineer. Ernest Abs Hagen.
who made the estimate of the value
of the water company's Improvements
on the city's distributing plant, has
made an affidavit which lets in a great
light on the water company's methods.
Ever since Abs Hagen's estimate was
furnished to the Council the corpora
tion and those either directly or In
directly in its employ have not only
been seeking to discredit Abs Hagen
professionally, but they have been
endeavoring to drive him oat of the
city. A vefcy strong pressure was
brought to bear on Mr. Hagen when
he was making his figures to force him
to elevate them. He, upon his own re
sponsibility, declined to do so. but the
figures were raised, and the facts as
to, how that raise was obtained are
clearly set forth in the affidavit follow
ing.
ThÂ»Â» instrument was made by Aba
Hagen last November, and several city
officials who are not in any way tied
up with the water company were con
versant with the facts as he has set
them forth. The affidavit furnishes
some sensational denouements. It
reads:
To All Whom it May Concern: The un
dersigned, during the month of May, 1R97.
was placed hy City Engineer Dockweiler
In charge of making an estimate upon the
value of the present waterworks system
of the city of Los Angeles, and to report
upon the condition of the same. In pur-
suance of su 'i instructions he handed a
report in writing to City Engineer Dock
weiler, which report, after suggested and
enforced alterations, was duly presented
to and accepted by the City Council of
Los Angeles, and is now on file and
known as the "City Engineer's Report
Upon the Value of the City Waterworks."
The undersigned herewith states the
following facts to have become relevant
during the time that he prosecuted this
work, to wit: That from the dat.Â» of be

he was in sole charge of the work, ar

of the same according to his own best
judgment without any further instruc
tions, interference or suggestions from
the City Engineer; that the report and
estimate as delivered by him to City En
gineer Dockweiler was essentially his
own work; that during the time of ex
ecuting this work the City Engineer, with
the exception of three times, did not put
in any appearance whatever upon the
scene of the work and that during these

WRECK OF
THE CORONA
ON A REEF
The Steamship Strikes Off
the Mouth of the
Skeena River.
Passengers and Crew Reach the
Shore, but Vessel and
Cargo Will Prove a
Total Loss.
NANAIMO, B. C, Jan. 28.â The
steamer Danube arrived at Departure
Bay late this evening, bringing news
of the wreck of the steamer Corona,
with 245 passengers aboard. The Cor
ona struck a rock near the mouth of
the Skeena River and at once com-
menced to sink. Lifeboats were low-
ered and the passengers were conveyed
to the beach of the Skeena River. The
steamer Al-Ki went to the rescue. She
is now on her way south with the un
fortunate gold seekers.
The Corona struck the rock on Tues- ;
day morning, bow on, and is now lying
With stern submerged. It is feared
that the Corona will prove a total
wreck and the whole of her cargo will
be lost.
The accident occurred just outside an
island that is off the mouth of the
Skeena River, and it is said the course
taken by the Corona was not the usual
one. Most vessels pass up between the
mouth of the river and the island, but
the Corona was put on a course rmt
side the island and piled up on a reef
when under full headway. She settled
down within forty minutes, giving lima,
for all the passengers to toe safety land- 1
ed, but very little of their effects and
none of the freight could be landed.
The Corona was commanded by Cap
tain Pierce, who never before had
charge of a steamship. He has com
manded a deep-sea sailing vessel for
several years, and until recently was in
charge of the ship Sea King, oince the
Corona has been on the Alaska route
he had been second officer under Cap
tain Carroll, until the latter resigned,
when Pierce was promoted to the com
mand. This was his second trin as
! captain. The Corona had two pilots on
this trip, one of them being Captain
William Thompson, an experienced
i navigator.
It is not known here just how many
! passengers the Corona had on this trip,
; but she was uncomfortably crowded
when she left here, many sleeping on
the floor.
The wreck of the Corona recalls the
loss of the 'steamer Mexico, also belong
ing to the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company. She was lost just as the
rush was setting in last fall, and this
j wreck also comes at a most inoppor
! tune time. The Coronn. like the Mex
ico, Is said to have been fairly well in
sured.
About the same time word was re
ceived from Victoria announcing the
loss Of the Corona, Superintendent J.
F. Trowhridge of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company received news
from W. P. Rithet & Co. of Vancouver.

DAWSON THE DESTINATION
OF NEARLY ALL OF THE
CORONA'S PASSENGERS.
History of the Vessel Which Succeeded the
Wrecked Mexico and Shared
Her Fete.
SEATTLE, Jan. 2R.â The Corona was
considered one of the finest appointed
vessels in the Alaska service. She
was in command of Captain Pearee
and had two pilots, Thompson and
Coffman, whose experience on the
route would seem to make their pres
ence on the steamship almost a guar
antee of safety. The wrecked steamer
sailed from Seattle for Dyea and
Skaguay, Alaska, on January 20 and
had 225 passengers, 130 being first
clasp, from Puget Sound ports. In
Seattle alone were sold seventy first
class and seventy second class tickets.
Her freight was about 700 tons of gen
eral merchandise and 200 tons of
fuel.
ThfÂ» following were the officers of the
ill-fated Corona: Captain P^arce,
Chief Officer Thomas Hogan, Second
Officer Marshall, Third Officer Cann,
Chief Engineer Martin, First Assist
ant 1 U. Miller, Second Assis
tant JfngiJneer R. Robertson, Purser
Valentine.
Among the passengers on the Corona
was a party of six from San Jose. Cal..
led by John Stanley and A. Ehrman.
They were under contract to build a
wharf and warehouse in Skaguay. As
a sidp issue the six took an ordinary
cutter sleigh and about thirty smaller
sleds for use in transporting freight
and passengers on the Skaguay road.
The party has sixty mules in San
Francisco, which will be shipped to
Skaguay as soon as transportation can
be engaged.
A most complete printing outfit was
j aboard the Corona, shipped to Dyea. Tt
'< was being taken north by E. W. Pol
: lock, formerly of Mount Vernon, who
intended to issue in Dyea the only
; daily newspaper in Alaska. The cy
linder press is the largest yet taken
| north.
Mr. and Mrs. Foster and Mr. and
Mrs. F. K. Thayer sailed for Fort
Wrangel on the steamer Corona- They
] will locate on the new townsite called
| Goldike and will commence construc
| lion work at once. T. G. Wilson left
; on the Corona and intends to push on
Ito Dawson without delay. He figures
! on reaching there in March, and after
i spending a couple of weeks expected
| to start on the return trip. He has en
i gaged Indian guides and has a num
ber of dogs. He intended to follow the
course of the river.' Several others
aboard the Corona Imended starting
at once for the Klondike. It Is safely
estimated that three-quarters of the
passengers are bound for the mines.
On the Ist of September last the
Corona came to Seattle from Pan Fran-
cisco. Early in the previous month
the steamer Mexico was sunk in Dixon
Entrance, which made necessary the
presence of a vessel to take her run.
Voyages north were made by the
steamers Willamette and Homer be2
fore the Corona went on the run. She !
left here on November 6 on her first
run. She wa s thus practically the '
successor of the Mexico, and both yes- j
sels shared tho same misfortune. Since
the Corona made her first run on No
vember 6 she made five round trips
and was on her sixth trip north when j
lost.
The Corona was built in ISSS at Phil- !
adelphia for Neafie & Levy at a cost ,
of about $200,000. In that same year ,
Pho was purchased by the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, and
brought around to the Pacific Coast. I
For a number of years she was oper- ,
nted between San Francisco and San
Dieg-o. Last year she made one trip to ;
Alaska, but the remainder of the time j
she was in th<> California service.
The dimensions of the Corona were â 
as follows:, Length over all. 230 feet;
beam. 34 feet 6 inches: registered ton- \
nape, 1492 gross. 966 net; schooner rip.
stoel, 3S staterooms. 114 berths; could
carry 220 passengers. She had triple
expansion engines. 1440 horsepower.
four marine boilers, eight furnaces, j
Her average speed was twelve knots.
She was valued at $175,000 and was
well insured.
Had the Corona returned safely from
her last trip it was the intention to !
send her south and put the large
steamer Queen on the Alaska run.
This makes the third steamship lost
between Seattle and Juneau, Alaska.
The first to go down was the Willapa.
on Man h 0. 1897, and the Mexico was
lost on August E>, 1897.

three times he did not remain to exceed
ten minutes in any instance; that the un
dersigned had his report typewritten and
"handed the siimc to City Engineer Dock
weiler on July 20, 1597, and that the sum
total of the real present value of the
waterworks system, according to his es
timate, was $1,063,690.
That on July 21, 1897, City Engineer
Dockweiler acknowledged to J.he under
signed that on the night previous he was
visited at his residence on South Hill
street by Mr. Mulholland, the superin
tendent of the I,os Angeles Water Works,
and by the latter's request read to him
the report and the different items of the
estimated value as prepared by the un
dersigned: thnt he received from said Mul
holland a number of suggestions in refer
ence tn certain items in the estimate
â which ought to be raised in their valua
tion; that on the following day, July 22,
1897, City Engineer Dockweiler went with
the undersigned over the itemized esti
mate and insisted upon raising the figures
therein; that the sum total of such in
crease amounted to $186,000 over and
above the true estimate previously made
by the undersigned; that. City Engineer
Dockweiler brought forth no good reason
for such increase of figures, neither based
upon his knowledge of the plant nor of
the current prices for which like material
and labor could be bought in open mar
ket at that time.
That the amount of such sums to be
added to the tr',i>> .-^timrite were the fol
lowing: Items: One hundred thousand dol
lars added increase for the pipes (no rea
son given by him for this increase), $20,
000 added to the Bellevue reservoir (rea
son Riven for increase was the strategic
location of such reservoir).
That the following are some of the in
creased valuations:
Forty-four iron pipe from $40,251 to $51,
74P: increase $12. 22 s !.
East Side Springs, from $4625 to $18,625;
Increase $14,000.
Lot and building on Marchessault
street, from $19,650 to $31,000; increase $11 -
350.
Brick-lined tunnel, from $64,000 to $70,
000; increase $6000. Mulholland himself
stated to the undersigned in March, 1897,
that this work originally cost $63,000.
That various other items raised in
creased the sum total, as above stated,
to about $186,000. That in addition to
these figures, an additional 15 per cent of
the sum total, equaling $157,453, was to be,
added for so-called contingencies, engi
neer's fees, etc., although the estimates
included already the sum of $18,189 for
such incidentals; and that the sum total
of such increase would have amounted
to $373,455 over and above the true esti
mated value of the plant.
That the undersigned at that time
etrenuously objected to such increase of
the valuation.
That on the following day City Engi
neer Doekweiler and ex-City Engineer
Eaton visited the undersigned at his of
fice In the California Bank building, and
In the presence of an employe reread the
estimate and figured with him over an
additional increase of the estimate, nota
bly an addition of 15 per cent for contin
gencies should be added to the whole:
that upon their Invitation their meeting
was transferred to the residence of Mr.
Eaton at Santa Monica, where another
reconsideration of the estimated figures
was urged as late as 12 p. m.
That finally, on the following day, July
84, 1897, in the undersigned's office, and
under the pressure of City Engineer
Dockweiler and ex-City Engineer Baton,
the final estimate was raised from $1,063.

CLAIM THEY RECEIVED
VERY SCANT COURTESY.
Members of a Committee From Brooklyn
Say That Congressman Loud Was
Abrupt, to Say the Least.
NEW York. Jan. 28.â According to a
report made to-day by Gf>rF>- P. Elliott,
a committee, of which he is chairman,
appointed as a result of an indignation
meeting held in the Academy of Music
on Thursday a w.-ek ago. met with a
chilly reception from Chairman Loud of
the House Committee on Postal Service
and Post Roads. The committee, Which
was composed of Mr. Elliott, S. V. White
and Thomas G. Shearman, called upon
Chairman Loud to protest against any
reduction in the postal service of Brook
lyn. The interview, Mr. Elliott says, was
a stormy one.
Representative Bennett of Brooklyn in
troduced the members of the committee
to Mr. Loud. Mr. Elliott, .i* chairman,
briefly outlined the nature <>f their busi
ness. After listening a few minutes, Mr.
Elliott says Mr. Loud excitedly ex
claimed: "You're a park of <1 a.Â«s.-s.
You don't know anything about what jrou
want. You think you do. and you try
to come down here and tell us our busi
ness; but you don't know anything about
it. and I repeat it."
Mr. White finally explained that a large
number of business men and residents of
Brooklyn were unanimous that the postal
service should not be curtailed as it
would cause loss and inconvenience to
them.

LOR ANOELKS, Jan. 28.â One of the
most heartrending discoveries ever
made on the desert, which has fur
nished many tragedies ere this, was
that last night at Mammoth Tank, on
the Southern Pacific's line, about fifty
miles northwest of Yuma, in San Die
g:o County. E. Adolph of this city, liv
ing at 415 North Broadway, was visit-
Ing his friend. L. S. Putnam, who is
stationed at Mammoth Tank as agent
of the Norton Drake Company. Put
nam had in charge a carload of provi
sions, whii h be was delivering to the
men employed at that point. He and
Adolph were surprised to pee at a
short distance from the camp a little
bonfire on the mesa, not a hundred
yards from the railroad tracks. As
that point is entirely deserted, except
by the section hands, the gentlemen
<"in luded to investigate. They could
think of no explanation for the pres
ence so near by of travelers who had
yet not ventured to come into camp,
unless it was that the fire-builders were
Indians, so they picked up their rifles
and proceeded to reeonnoiter.
Their horror can be imagined when
they came upon six human beings,
nearly naked, emaciated, swollen with
the frightful blackswelling of agoniz
ing thirst, and almost frozen in the
pitiless desert night. They were a mid
dle-aged man and five small children,
one a baby of 3 years, and the eldest
only 12. The baby's condition was too
pitiful for words, and Adolph in de
scribing the scene was overpowered by
the recollection.
The two men, recognizing the neces
sity for Instant action, if the lives of
the poor creatures were to be saved,
ran at once for water and blankets.
The must urgent need was to rellevethe
raging thirst, though the entire six
were on the verge of starvation as well.
Their faces and tc-ngues were so swoll
en- that it seemed as if they were al
ready beyond the reach of restoratives.
Sulfiee to say, however, that the two
men ran to camp and quickly returned
with a squad of aroused workmen, car
rying food, clothing and blankets. Aft
tr satisfying their thirst, as far an it
was Â«Â«afe to do so, a little food was
gWefl t<: tht sufferers. The man and
boys were clothed, the maimed and
swollen feet were cared for, and every
thing done that could be done under
the circumstances.
When he had recovered sufficiently to
talk. Joyceâ for that is the name of the
unfortunate man â related to Adolph
an.l Putnam the following remarkable
story:
Last fall Joyce was living in Pres
cott, Arizona, with his wife and chil
dren. The wife was an invalid. After
a long illness Mrs. Joyce died, and
when the funeral was over Joyce found
himself loft with five small boys with
out employment, and at his wits' ends
His wife's illness had necessitated his
presence at her side, and he was
obliged to quit work for that purpo^.
The funeral expenses consumed his last
dollar.
He left Prescott in a wagon in No
vember. after the death of his wife.
The horses gave out and died near Gila
Bond, and from that point he and the
little ones walked 315 miles to Mam
moth Tank.
There the father finally gave out
completely, and the little party would
surely have perished if they had not
been discovered that night â the morn
ing would have been too late.

The Dally Chronicle this morning
says the Far Eastern situation was
discussed between the Marquis of Sal
isbury and United States Embassador
Hay before the latter started for
Egypt.
The Daily Chronicle understands
that the prospect of an English loan to
China is very favorable.
The Peking correspondent of the
Times says: The French attitude has
undergone a sudden change, and now
appears to give a reluctant support to
the menacing language of the Russian
agent. M. Pavloff, Charge d'Affaires at
Peking, against th<? opening of Tallen-
Wan. The Chinese, having made in
quiries, disbelieve PavlofTfl statement
that Russia can provide a loan on the
same financial terms as Great Britain.
At the meeting of the Grand Council
Thursday night the Chinese decided
to approach the English and Russian
Governments v.ith a proposal of com
promise, each power to provide half of
the loan on its own financial terms and
the other conditions to be adjusted be
tween them.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 28.â A Herald spe- '
cial from Key West, Fla.. says: While
thu report of the deaih of General Nes
tor Arangueren caused considerable ex
citement and regret in the Cuban col
ony from the fact that his aged father
and mother and other relatives reside
here, it caused no surprise whatever,
as his adventurous spirit, it was ex
pected, would lead to his death. Ad
ditional sympathy was enlisted in the
case from the fact that young Aran
gueren's sister was recently wedded to
Surgeon Guitarez of the United States
Marine Hospital service. The father
added that he had been expecting such
news, and dreaded that some disaster
hail befallen his son ever si'ice he held
up a train between Havana and Ma
tanzas, from which several Spanteh of
ficers were captured. Special orders,
he said, had been issued by the Ha
vana authorities to capture the young
insurgent and bring him dead or alive
to Havana, and he was advised that
plans to that end were constantly be
ing devised. The efforts, he continued,
were renewed aftÂ«-r the execution of
General Blanco's envoy. Colonel Ruiz,
and a reward had been offered for his
head.
Warnings had been repeatedly sent
to young Arangueren. On one occa
sion Senorlta Isabel Giralt, his fian
cee, was dispatched on this perilous
mission. Knowing the strong feeling
aroused by the summary execution of
Colonel Ruiz and that the determina
tion of the Spanish officials to effect his
capture was favored by the level coun
try in which his operations were con
ducted, he was advised to seek a tem
porary refuge with his limited com
mand among the mountains in the east
ern provinces. Arangueren's only re
ply to all these warnings was that he
was aware of the Spanish plans, and
resigned to whatever end was In store.
It is generally believed here that the
yiung general's younger brother. Be
nito. now a captain, will be assigned
to his command.
A dispatch received last night by Dr.
Giuteras from Consul-General Lee re
moves the last hope cherished by Aran
gueren's parents that the report of his
death was untrue. General Lee says
the body brought to Havana for iden
tification is that of the insurgent gen
eral. H>> is iV'lng his utmost to obtain
the consent of the Havana authorities
to give the body burial, as requested.

HON. EL WOOD EVANS DEAD.
TACOMA, 'Wash., Jan. 28â Hon. Elwood
Evan I',1 ', the oldest practicing lawyer in
the State, dropped dead from heart dis
ease on the street at noon to-day. He
was 70 years of ape and came to Puget

TO DEFEND THE
AMERICA CUP
Iselin Goes Abroad on a
Mission Somewhat
Mysterious.
But It Is Known That He Rep
resents a Powerful
Syndicate.
Instructed by New York Yachtsmen
to Look Over thÂ« Latest Racing
Craft in Europe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 28.â A Providence spe
cial says: C. Oliver Iselin, of Defender
fame, left here for Europe this week on
a mysterious mission looking to the fu
ture protection of the America cup.
He goes abroad as the active head of a I
syndicate as powerful as that which
paid for the last international race,
and he also officially represents the i
New York Yacht Club. There is a sud- I
den and unusual stir among the big
gest yachtsmen of the country ln this j
direction.
Just what the movement means, no \
one outside of the executive officers of !
the New York Yacht Club and three j
gentlemen, including Mr. Iselin, knew. .
They have worked quietly and secret- â¢
ly, and Iselin is going about with a
good deal of caution. Twice this month
he has been a visitor to Bristol, and
January 15 he was at the Herresheff
boat-building yards, in the bay side
town, for half a day. He had a long ;
and serious talk with Captain "Nat" i
Herresheff. and when rselin left it was !
with the understanding that he should
visit Europe immediately for the pur
pose of looking over the latest things
in racing yachts on the other side. Mr. j
Iselin had more than one object in vis-
Itlng Bristol. The chief one. however,
WES to ascertain the exact condition
of things at the Herresheff shops, and ,
to learn from "Nat" Herresheff per- \
sonally if the firm could put up another j
with all the latest ideas in racing ma
chinery.
Mr. Iselin, after leaving Bristol, im
mediately communicated with the
members of the Cup Defender Syndi
cate in New York. A conference be
tween Iselin and others took place in j
New York Sunday, and the New York
Yacht Club's executive committee met
Tuesday. It was decided at tn.ese ooa- j
ferences that Mr. Iselin and any others
he might select should make a visit to
Europe on matters connected with th^
defense of the cup. and although he
had much important business in this
country just now, he decided to mako
the trip, and his departure this week
was in company with some other prom
inent New Yorkers. Mrs. Iselin is also
one of the pc *y. Mr. Iselin will be ab
sent about four or five weeks, and will
go to England, Scotland and the Med
iterranean.

"Dated this 28th day of January, 1898. H. J. CHINN. <
"Justice of the Peace in and for Hot Springs Township, County of (
Napa, State of California." '
PT HELENA. Jan. 2*.â There were
but a half-dozen men, not counting the
officers, in front of the Town Hall when
Sheriff McKenzie drove up from Napa
with George Clark this morning. The j
street was comparatively deserted and ;
the arrival of the murderer was a tame
affair. St. Helena has certainly shown
that she is capable of self-control, and
that she is quite willing to leave the
disposition of George Clark to the law,
though she still resents bitterly the ex
pense his trial will caua
Clark walked into the hall and sat
beside the stove, his hands outstretched
to get all the warmth and comfort pos- i
sible after his cold drive up from
Napa.
George Dax, Mrs. Clark's tiny son
in-law, was the first witness called.
Mr. Dax drops his h's, he stutters pain
fully, his words come in hesitating
gasps, but he has the patience with
which nature h:is especially endowed !
those afflicted as he is, and he gave his :
testimony with dignity and well-lnten- j
tioned good sense. H- fcot alone very!
well at first, but when cross-questioned
found utterance difficult. He succeed
ed, however, in making himself clearly
understood and manfully kept to his
story. He explained his noting Clark's j
shoes so minutely by telling of the em- |
barrasement sneaking causes him and j
his habit, consequently, of keeping his;
eyi'F bent on the floor.
It was odd to hear Mr. Dax testify
that William Clark "was a cheerful
man. always seemed to be happy,"
when one thinks of that crowded lit
tle h.>me of his with its horrible secrets,
its guilty plots, and its quarrels, due,
Mrs. Clark said yesterday, to George
Clark's violent temper.
T>r. Osborne, who was called to the
Clark house immediately after the
murder, testified as to the condition of
William Clark's body and the nature
of the wounds. The interesting part j
of hi? testimony related to the manner |
in which George Clark was told of the j
murder of his brother.
T told him that his brother was shot,
and he said, 'Is that so?' "
The doctor's testimony is valuable
because he noted the mud on the mur
derer's shoes and because of his iden
tification of the overcoat Dr. Osborne
gave George Clark, and which he still
wears.
Court adjourned at noon before Dr.
Osborne had finished his testimony.
Dr. Osborne, after recess, was put
Attorneys Quarreling Over Clark's Shoes.
i
upon the stand, to give evidence as to
the autopsy. He produced a portion of
the murdered man's skull and the bul
let which killed him. The defense j
made a decided objection to the ad
mission of Dr. OsborneVi testimony as
to the pro liable distance at which the
pistol which killed William < 'lark must
have been held. But Justice Chirm over
ruled all objections, and Dr. Osbo-rne i
*ays it as his opinion that the pistol j
must have been held at a distance of
n<rt less than one Coot nor more than
two feet from William Clark's head.
The doctor, with the assistance of the
l>istrict Attorney as a model, illustrat
ed the relative posftions in whiui the
two brothers probably stood on the
morning of January 20 In the kitchen
of the Clark house. The doctor made
use of the expressions "right half " and
"left half" in his explanation, which
gave Mr Hoga/i an opportunity to
facetiously insist upon knowing which
was Mr. Bell's right half; to which the
District Attorney replied with dignity
that it was "better to have one right
half than two wrong ones."
The cro-wd laughed at the sparring
of the lawyers. In fact. St. Helena
crowds are extremely good-natured, if
one judge merely from their demeanor
during George Clark's preliminary ex- ;
amination.
Dr. S. McCurdy testified substantial
ly as Dr. Osborne had done. He had
j been present at the autopsy, and agreed
with Dr. Osborne as to the course of the
bullet and the position of the pistol.
| But Dr. McCurdy declared that testl
â¢ ninny based on powder marks was un
. reliable in determining the distance at
I which a shot was fired, and would give
i r.o opinion upon this matter.
Peter Yorke described his meeting on
Madrone avenue with the man who |
ran from the Clark home at a quarter
past five on the morning of the mur
der, and turned into Kearny street.
"Was anything said by the man as
he passed you? " Mr. Torke was asked.
"He said: 'My God!' " was the an- j
swer.
Mr. Yorke conducted the officers to
the spot at which he had passed the
fleeing man, and there they fitted
George Clark's muddy boots into the
tracksmade by those flying feet.
Marshal J. G. Johnson was the next
witness. After being swcrn in he was
I questioned as follows:
Mr. Bellâ Where do you reside, Mr.
Johnson, and what is your occupation?
Answer â I have been continuously re
siding here since ISB4. and I have been
Marsh.il for nearly eight years.
Q. â At what time did you arise last
Thursday morning, the 20th day of Janu
ary. 5
A.â Well, it must have been nearly 6
o'clock, or a few minutes before.
Q. â Where did you a<> and who accom
panied you when you left the house?
A.â l "went with Dr. Osborne, who had
called at my house for mo, and wÂ» went
directly to the house of William Anderson
Clark.
Q. â What happened upon your arrival
at that house?
A. â We went Into the house, found
William Anderson Clark lying on the
(ounce in Â»the sitting room and he was
dead, lie was warm yet. and he. had a
wound on the side of his head, right over
the left eye. We started to. make an in
vestigation of the premises. We went
Into in" kitchen and found a pool of
blood in the place where wo were told
W. A. Clark had been found lying, and
we found a pipe that was partially filled
with tobacco. The pipe was on the floor,
not far from the pool of blood. Inline
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 29, 1898.
diately outside of the door of the kitchen. ,
the room where the body of W. A. Clark i
had been found, we found a pistolâ a 32
caliber pistol, a five-shooter. There were
four loaded cartridges in the ptStoL
Q. â What did you then do or where did
you go after making that Investigation
there at the house?
A.â ln company with Dr. Osborne I '
went back and examined the body again :
to see if it was possible to ascertain |
whether it was a case of suicide or r, > â  t .
and came to the conclusion that there
was a possibility that the act mipht have
been a suicidal one. I went ovc-r to the
railroad depot and notified the conductor
to look out for George Clark, as he
suspected of having been the guilty
party.
Q â What occurred after your arrival at
the cottage of George W. ("lark (ii that !
morning In company with Dr. Osborne?
A.â Dr. Osborne knocked at the door of
George Clark's cottage and said. "L,et us
In." "All right," he says, and he got up
and opened the door. I says to him:
"Hieorge. to be honest with you, your
bn.thor is dead. Somebody has killed
him." "Is that so?" says George. "I
guess I will co over there." Then says
I. "George, where were you last night?"
He says. "I was home." I says. "What
time did you get home?" Says he, j
"Right after the )>ra\.-r meeting at the
Advent churchâ say about IS o'clock."
"Well." I says. "dress yourself, any
how." In the meantime he was dr<
and we were talking to him. and I says.
"George, would you know your pistol if j
you should ever see it again?" And he i
says. "Yes." I handed him the gun that
I had found at the house of W. A. 'lark.
hthl then I says. "Is this your gun?" 11^ |
looked at the gun that I handed to him i
very carefully and he says, "It Is not my i
gun." I then put it back in my pocket '
and after he got through putting on bis i
clothing I observed that there were two !
pairs of shoes in the room, one pair being i
near the stove, that had considerable
mud on them, and another pair standing
under the table, which looked to me to
be like Sunday shoes. I said nothing
until he got ready to put on his shoes,
and when he reached down to pick up
these muddy shoes I says, "George, are
those the shoes that you wore last
night?" And he says, " "Yes. It's the
same shoes." "Well," I says, "you lust
put on these, shoes that are under the
table here." which he did. "T will have
to take care of you for a while. You
know, of course, that the people are sus
pecting you," I said. He says. "I am in
nocent." Later on he admitted that the
pistol which had been shown to him was
his. He previously contended it was n<>t.
We took his mud-covered shoes and fit
ted them in the tracks. They fitted ex
actly. The footprints apparently were
very recently made. They were" traced
i from W. A. Clark's residence to George's
j cabin.
During Marshal Johnson's cross-ex
amination, while Attorney Hogan was
questioning on the matter of foot
prints. District Attorney Bell reached
over to examine the shoes, still cov
ered with dried mud, about which
there has been so much talk. Attorney
Hogan objected to Mr. Bell's gaining
Illustrating the Fratricide's Act.
possession of the shoes and for a mo
ment the two lawyers stood angrily
glaring at each other, each with a firm
hand upon exhibit D. The remote
cause of the trouble was an indenta
tion along the renter of the sole of the
right shoe. The Marshal had denied
noting a corresponding mark in the
tracks which he had been minutely de
scribing.
Mrs. Clark was called into rourt for
just a moment to identify her hus
band's pipe, which was found on the
kitchen floor of the Clark house She
stood, tall and ungainly, while she was
being questioned, answered in mono
syllables and passed out again.
Constable Spurr was the next wit
ness. He, too, had noted the pecul
iarity of fieorge Clark's right foot,
which, turning upon the ankle, has left
an uneven impression, the foot-print
slightly depressed on one side.
"You placed the shoe in the mud and
then saw tht- tracks?" Spurr was asked
in cross-examination.
"No, sir," ho replied decidedly. "The
tracks were there first."
"Were there no other tracks?"
"Ypf ; there were tracks of my own
feet from tlie nipht before, when I
had walked in the middle of the road,
but I found that by putting one foot iii
one track I could not reach the next
with my other foot. The man who
made those tracks must have been run
ning."
And the constable. In illustration,
leaped from th<> witness seat almost to
the reporters' table, to show thp space
covered at one stride by the murderer
in the cold dawn of that day a week
ago.
The rest of Constable Spurr's testi
mony was corroborative of the Mar
shal's story.
Marshal Johnson Is an excellent wit
ness. H<- is sparing of unnecessary
words and yet his testimony makes the
best pen picture of the second phase Âf
the Clark case. Mrs. Clark's evidence
on Thursday and the Marshal's on Fri
day, together make up the (Mark case.
To any one who reads the words this
woman, freely and without compul
sion, uttered yesterday, the motive for
George Clark's crime is clear. The Mar
shal's account is simply the logical re
sult of that question of the murderer's
to his brother's wife, "if Will was out
of the way would you marry me?" and
her answer. "Yes."
For the answer was "yes," not once,
but many times, though later It became
"no," pa: t!y because Mrs. Clark "want
ed to lead a Christian life," but also
because her husband's brother was of
a quarrelsome nature, and as she told
him. "I've lost all love for you; you've
been so mean to me."
With Constable Spurr'a testimony the
people's case ended. The two daugh
ters of Mrs. <"lark. who had been sworn
the day before as witnesses, and who
sat in a room above the hall with their
mother, an unhappy, dejected, pitiable
trio, waiting to bo called down into the
crowded courtroom, were spared the or
deal.
There was an expectant pause, and
then the following dialogue took place:
Attorney Bellâ The People rest.
Attorney Hoganâ We have no evi
dence to offer.
Attorney Bellâ The State submits the
case without argument.
Attorney Hoganâ l want to submit it
without argument myself, but I
don't know that there has been any
case produced here. I move that the
defendant be dismissed.
There was an incredulous smile that
was half a sneer on the faces of the
audience, now as interested as they
had been tliÂ«- day before.
"On the ground that there has been
no proof here in any manner in the
world that <;Â»-<rrge Clark committed the
offense. There \* no testimony v>f the
fact that he k'lled this man."
Attorney l>tllâ Ready for a ruling
on the motion for dismissal.
The Courtâ Oh, I deny that motion.
Justice Chlnn drew paper and pencil
toward him and wrote:

And there wasn't a sound In the
courtroomâ not a hand-clap, not even
the unconscious sigh of relief an au
dience gives when a strain has been
remodeled. Those who have accused
St. Helena of a tendency to backslide
into the old, lawless spirit of ten years
ago owe the stanch, decent town an
apology. Pretty little St. Helena has
vindicated herself. Though her tem
per has been sorely tried by this fes
tering sureâ the Clark case â she has
conducted herself with patience, with
trust and with sobriety. She has
atoned for the one lapse into barbar
ism. She has redeemed herself.
"To which ruling of the court." At
torney Hog&n went on. perfunctorily.
"the defendant objects upon the ground
that there is not shown, by the testi
mony that has been given to the court,
any sufficient cause tor making the or
der that the court has made."
"Court's adjourned," said Justice
Chirm.'
It was just twenty minutes past 3
o'clock. The courtroom was emptied
rapidly. Men were satisfied that the
murderer should be held for trial. But
they had not expected any other re
sult. There was not the slightest dem-
onstration. The prisoner, who has sat
for two days, perfectly still, apparently
leas Interested than -ny other person
in the hall, made Dot tlv slightest
chance In his ,-ittkude. His sallow, un
healthy, troubled fare showed not the
least expression of disappointment or
grief. He blinked as hi> sat gazing dully
before him, his narrow-chested, slight
figure curled up in his chair.
George Clark looked as though he
were thinking, or trying to' think,
which effort must be purgatory to his
defective Intelligence. It appears as
though ho were only Just awakening to
a comprehension of what he has been
and what he has done. At all events
the deep lines of trouble In that
wretched face betoken a sincere re
morse. And that remorse â despite the
horror of his double crime, the long,
slow killing of his brother's honor, and
the short, sure shot that crashed
through the skull just above that
brothers left Umpleâ that remorse
may be th<- cowards shrinking from
the consequences to himself of his
cruel act, but it has also, I believe, a
grain in It of that exquisite soul-re
pentance which is the beginning of
atonement.

TROOPS SLOW TO ACT.
Native Soldiers Walt for Hour* Before

Murderer*.
Br*clal Dispatch to The Ca.lL
TACOMA, Jan. 28.â The steamship
Breamer brings news that fanatical
Chinese pirates claiming to be in
spired by heaven attacked Haiphong:
with the intention of exterminating the
Europeans. They were 300 strong and
began their attack early in the morn-
Ing of December 16, meeting but little
opposition from the native troops until
late In the forenoon, when part of the
town had been destroyed by fire and
at least three Frenchmen had been
killed.
The pirates carried banners pro
claiming their mission. Inscriptions
reading: "Let us obey the order from
heaven," "Exterminate the Euro
peans," "Exterminate the Nguyuen
Dynasty of Maca," were carried, and
on the bodies of the dead were found
chips of bamboo bearing the charac
ters, "Soldiers of Heaven."
Landing parties attacked the town
from four quarters, immediately apply
ing the torch. The mat sheds and
housee burned readily, and the pirates
made rapid progress toward the heart
Of the city. One band was met by a
detachment of 200 native troops and
repulsed. Another killed E. Gauthier,
a Frenchman, after pursuing him for
some distance, and brutally hacked
his body almost beyond recognition.
An employe of Faussemange, a French
merchant, was fatally injured, and an
other unnamed Frenchman killed. The
road leading to the cemetery was left a
waste.
The native troops were slow to re
spond and even to learn of the attack,
though the pirates had been for eight
days encamped at Elephant Hill, mak
ing no secret of their Intention to at
tack the town and proclaiming their
heaven-inspiring mission. When the.
troops did realize the gravity of the
situation they responded in small num
bers, and reinforcements had to be
summoned before the Invaders were re
pulsed.
Attacks were made upon several near
by and small posts. Much property
was destroyed, the residences of Euro
pean families being the special object
of the pirates' hatred. A number of
buildings were burned in these villages,
and such valuables as were portable
were carried away.
The frequent recurrence of piratic
outrages In Hongkong and Canton har
bors has given rise to the story that
organized bands of pirates are preying
on their environs. The junk trade has
been considerably demoralized, for no
sooner do junks get up or ilown the
rtm, away from Canton, than they are
frequently beset by pirates and looted.
Several junkmen have been murdered,
and the balance are greatly scared.
Nothing less than another chasing by
warships seems likely to stop thf-se dep
redations. Piracy in West River was
stopped last summer by the effectual
work of a Chinese cruiser, whose crew
captured and executed the pirate lead
ers.

Witnesses Do Not Claim
He Was the Principal
in Negotiations.
Otis and Campbell Tell of Their
Dealings With H. H.
Boyce.

Against a Newspaper.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS. O-, Jan. 28.â The two
star witnesses in the alleged Senato
rial bribery Investigation were exam- i
lned by the Senate investigation com- j
mlttee to-day. They are Representa- i
live J. C. Otis of Hamilton County, who
claims to have been offered a bribe to
vote for Senator Hanna, and Thomas
C. Campbell, the attorney who acfed as
the legal representative of Otis. There
was nothing in the testimony of either
witness to even indicate that Senator
Hanna. Major Dick or Major Rath
bone had any connection with H. H. j
Boyce, through whom it was alleged
the negotiations were conducted. In
fact. Attorney Campbell, who came all
the way from New York to testify,
took occasion to say that he did not ;
believe Senator Hanna was interested
in or knew Boyce. Campbell produced
a roll of bills in denominations of 5100
and $50 aggregating $1750, which he
claimed Boyce had paid him durfng
the negctiatior.s. Campbell said if j
Boyce returned to Hamilton County ho
would be glad to return the money. ;
otherwise he would use a part of it
In pushing a suit for damages against
a Columbus paper.
Representative Otis testified he had
met Henry Harrison Boyce in Cincin
nati first on the evening of January 7,
last. About 11 o'clock on the morning
of that day, Friday, he received a long
distance telephone message from a man
at the Southern Hotel in Columbus.
who said he was Colonel Boyce, that
he had come on from New York and
wished to see him on important busi
ness. Mr. Otis told him to come to sec
him between 5 and 6 o'clock. Otis went
to the Gibson House and to Boyce's
room, No. 226. He met Boyce, and the
latter said to him that, though he was
a stranger to Otis, he wished to see him
on very important business; that he
represented J. Pierrepont Morgan of j
New York; that Mr. Morgan had great
interests in Ohio which he desired to
have looked after, and that he was also
a friend of Mr. C. C. Shane of New
York. During the conversation the ,
Senatorial matter was touched upon.
and Boyce asked as to Mr. Hanna's
chances, to which Otis replied that h>
did not think them very good.
Boj'ce said that night, or the follow
ing night, Mr. Shane was to havo> an I
interview -with President McKinley;
that both the President and Mr. Shane
were interested in the Ohio situation,
especially the former. Personally,
Boyce said he did not care who was
elected. After telling' Mr. Otis a num
ber of other stories after the same fash
ion they separated with an understand
ing that another meeting would be held
the following afternoon, Saturday, at ;
1 o'clock. Th^n it was that Mr. Otis
decided he needed a lawyer and went to
see Mr. Campbell. A meeting took
plac the next afternoon at the (llbson
Ttomw* The conversation was larir-'ly
along the same line as at the preceding
meeting. Finally Boyce and Campbell
were Introduced and most of the busi
ness after that was transact--*! bei
them. On cross-examination by Sen
ator Garfield, Mr. Otis said that noth
ing was said about Dick or Hollenb'-ok,
or Daugherty or Major Rathbone, and
that Boyce did not proclaim that he
came as the agent of Senator Hanna or
that Senator Hanna had any connec
tion with the matter.
Mr. Campbell's testimony was large
ly a repetition of that riven by Mr.
Otis. He said that Boyce and Otis
came to his room, and that during the
conversation Boyce said he had a
strong and loving regard for the Presi
dent, and talked so strongly about this
that finally Campbell began to think
he was overstating himself. OtisÂ» finally
left the room, and Campbell then asked
Boyce directly what he wanted. Boyce
finally said he had come to help Hanna
In his election. Campbell said to
him: "Did you not come from the
President?" to which Boyce replied that
he had, but in which Mr. Campbell de
clared he took no belief. Boyce at
last eaid he would pay Otis |250f for
his vote, and admitted that that was
the proposition he had come to make.
Mr. Campbell said he did not think
Otis would accept any proposition. This
Interview with Boyce was on Saturday
night. On Sunday Campbell went to
the fJibsor House, and had another
conversation with Boyce. Campbell
told Boyc^ Hint Otis would not listen
to the proposition made and he did not
know to what proposition he would
listen.
This concluded the examination, but
it will probably be resumed Monday.
ARGENTINA'S BOUNDARY
COMMISSIONER DISMISSED.
Officials to Be Retired From Chile at a
Time When the War Talk Has
Somewhat Subsided.
CopyrlÃhtPil, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
VALPARAISO, Jan. 28.â Adviros from
Santiago this afternoon are somewhat
startling. They suite that Senor Moreno,
the Argentina boundary commissioner,
will be retired within two days. It is
now believed that the retirement of
Senor Moreno will be followed by that of
the Argentine Minister to Chile, Senor
Pinerra. I am informed by the highest
authority that Senor Moreno started this
afternoon for the Argentina frontier, and
thence will take a special train for
Buenos Ayres. Minister I'inerra is in
Santiago. During the recent agitation
over the Argentina and Chile boundary,
wh'-'n it seemed that war was a possi
bility, the dismissal of Senor Moreno as
a boundary commissioner was loudly de
manded in certain quarters. Just what
his retirement now means is an open
question, as war talk has subsided.
WILL CHRISTEN
THE KENTUCKY
WITH WATER
No Strong Liquor to Be Used in
Con)n)itting the Latest Battle-
Ship to tl}e Sea.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. ; Jan. 28.â Miss Christine Bradley, daughter of
Governor Bradley, who is to christen the battleship Kentucky, has de
cided that BO Spirituous, vinous or malt liquors will play any part in
the ceremonies. On a farm in La Rue County, where Abraham Lincoln
was born, there is an unfailing spring of cold crystal water, where in
his boyhood the emancipator of the slaves was wont to slake his
thirst, using a gourd or oak leaf dipper. A committee will formally
visit the spring, fill a silver vessel with the sparkling water and seal
It with appropriate cefemonies.
Then the vessel will be given to Miss Bradley, who will guard it
until the time for breaking the seal on board the Kentucky. This plan
is said to be indorsed by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
which protested against Miss Harriet Richardson's proposition to break
a bottle of bourbon whisky over the warship's bow.
FLAMES FILL
THE TUNNEL
Santa Fe Railway Once
More Blocked Near
Williams.
Scarcely Cleared for Traffic
Before the Fire Breaks
Out Anew.
Workmen Paid a Dollar an Hour to
Risk Their Lives for the
Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WILLIAMS. Ariz., Jan. 28.â Shortly
after 11 o'clock last night the tunnel
at Johnson's Canyon, nine miles west
of here, was ready once more for the
passage of trains, after a week of ar
duous labor by a large force of work
men and great expense for the railroad
company.
Suddenly the smoke began to pour
forth from the entrance, and the ca
tastrophe of last week was repeated.
In an incredibly short period the whole
was a mass of flames, which mounted
high into the air at either end of the
tunnel, with such intense heat that all
efforts on the part of the workmen to
fight the flames were useless. The sup
position is that it kindled again from
the timbers being in contact with the
heated limestone rocks, of which the
sides of the canyon are formed, and
the crumbling of which caused so
much danger to the workmen last week.
Fortunately, there were no men In the
tunnel at the time, as trains were ex
pected to pass through soon, the rail
road company having given notice that
the traffic would be -resumed to-day.
Men are very loth to work at the
clearing away of the debris, and those
who face the danger are paid at the
rate of $1 an hour by the company,
many workmen making from $IF> to $20
a day. The railroad officials and a
of engineers are at the tunnel
ready to begin the work of retlmber
ing us soon as the flames have spent
themselves. The employes of the com
pany at this point are using every pre
caution to see that the passengers are
not greatly inconvenienced during the
transfer, and a good trail has been con
structed around the mountain, over
which the baggage, mail and express
are carried, thus causing no delay in
the mail matter.

THE. SAX FEAXCTSCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 29, 1898.
KNAPP AT LAST
UP FOR TRIAL
Mast Answer for Having
Defrauded the City
of San Jose.
Brought to Book. Through The
Call's Expose of Laxity
of Officials.
For Months His Case Has Been
" Pocketed " and the Records
Have Disappeared.
Special Diopatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 28.â The case of
Charles Knapp, who was convicted
over a year and a half ago of obtain
ing money under false pretenses and
which would still be "pocketed" but
for the expose recently made by The
Call, came up on appeal before Judge
Lorlgan to-day.
Knapp, who is an ex-saloon keeper
and a tinhorn politician, obtained $12
from the city treasury for work sup
posed to have boen done by him on
the creek. Investigation showed that
Knapp had done no work, and he was
arrested for obtaining money under
false pretenses. He was convicted and
sentenced to pay a fine of $300 or
serve 300 days in Jail. An appeal to the
Superior Court was taken and he was
released on bonds. The affair was
hushed up, and for over a year and
a half no action was taken. The Call's
expose filtered the situation, and at
the request of District Attorney Her
rington the case was. put on the cal
endar.
A strange feature of the affair, and
one which was the cause of continuance
to-day, rs that all thÂ«? papers In the
case and the bond on which Knapp '..us
released have been stolen. Trustee
Gross says th<Â» papers left his court in
charge of some officer of the law to be
filed, and the District Attorney says
he never received them, so they must
have been lost in transit. The regis
ter in the County Clerk's office does
not show they were ever filed. It Is
understood that Attorney Edson, who
represented Knapp in the lower court,
has a set of duplicate papers, and
these will be used.
Judge Lorimer continued the case
until next Friday.
A suit against ex-Justice of the Peace
W. H. Dwyer and his bondsmen was
filed in the Superior Court to-day by
the District Attorney. The action !s
to recover various sums to the amount
of $793, alleged to have been illegally
withheld from the public treasury by
the ex-Justice while he was In office.
In the complaint filed it Is alleged
that the ex-officlal has withheld a num
ber of sums that he collected as fines in
his court. He also compelled a number
of persons to pay costs for malicious
prosecutions and neglected to turn over
the proceeds to the county, it is al
leged that in twenty-four instances the
defendant fraudulently appropriated to
his own use ball money that had been
pieced in his hands. Dwyer Is now In
Oakland.
ATTEMPTED TO
KILL HIS WIFE.
Jerry Marshall, a Colored Man,
Fired With Intent to
Murder.
He Was After-ward Arrested for Dis
charging Firearms in thÂ«
City Limits.
Jerry Marshall, a colored man em
ployed aÂ« a waiter at the Hoffman Sa
loon on Market street, shot at his wife
last c-\Â»-ninp during a quarrel, in their
rooms in the RosedaU; at 321 Ellis street.
Boon after the shot was heard, police offi
cers hurried to the scene, but people in
the room denied that anything had hap
pened.
A search revealed the fact that a small
bullet had lodged in the folding door be
tween the rooms in which the couple had
been stopping, and, after going through
the door, had fallen to the floor.
Upon being questioned the parties at
first said that nothing had occurred in
the building, but afterward stated that
they had heard a shot. I'pon being taken
to the prison Marshall denied having at
tempted to take the life of his wife. KÂ«
charge was mado against the mnn by the
woman, but a charge was placed against
him by the police for having discharged
firearms in the city limits.

Police.
Accused of Having Had

Robberies.
He Is a Locomotive Engineer
and Comes from the Cracker
Neck. District.
PICKED UP IN THE STREET
Being Thrown From a Horss Some
Very Incriminating Articles Are
Found in His Possession.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Jan. 28.â John
F. Kennedy, a locomotive engineer,
who comes from the notorious Cracker
Neck district, not far from Blue Cut,
and whom the police have endeavored
to connect with some of the many re
cent train robberies in the outskirts of
Kansas City, was taken into the hos-
pital at police headquarters at a late
hour to-night under circumstances
that have caused a commotion in po
lice circles.
A man was picked up on West Sev
enteenth street to-night in an uncon
scious condition by persons who had
seen him thrown from a horse which
he was riding, the horse having slipped
on the pavement.
The injured man, on being taken to
police headquarters, proved to be John
Kennedy, disguised by a false chin
beard and equipped for an expedition
that could not have meant peace for
his fellow men. In one of Kennedy's
pockets was a black domino mask. Dis
tributed about his clothing were the
several pieces of a disjointed shotgun.
In addition to these were a 45-caliber
revolver and a liberal supply <>f cart
ridges and shotgun shells. He also
carried a lantern.
When Kennedy recovered at the hos
pital he refused to talk, further than
to say that he had started on a hunt
ing trip. The Police have learned that
a second man, who was riding with
Kt-nnedy, rode away at a rapid gait
after Kennedy's horpe fell.
Kennedy has been twice tried for
train robbery. He was indicted for
complicity in the Chicago & Alton
train robbery at Blue Cut on Thanks
giving eve, 1896, when between $20,000
ami 539.0 Mis supposed to have been
sci'urt'd, and for another robbery at
Blue Cut on Christmas "ye of the same
year. He was tried once and the jury
disagreed. On his second trial he was
acquitted. One indictment still stands
against him in connection with these
robberies. The detectives have main
tained that Kennedy was the leai'i-r of
the robbers. Kennedy is detained by
the police.
Kennedy boarded with Andy Ryan,
a foreman ol a brigade of the Kan:-as
City Fire Department, who Is a brother
of thp notorious Ryan of the James and
Younger gang of train robbers. This
-was Andy Ryan's night off.
As soon as Kennetly's mishap was
known all the railroad headquart<rs
â¢were notified, and through fear that
another robbery might be attempted
at Blue Cut. guards went out on every
train that left here during the night.

SEEKING A SUCCESSOR
TO ADMIRAL MATHEWS.
Secretary long Desires a Competent Man to
Act as Chief of the Bureau of
Yards and Docks.
MKW YORK, Jan. 2S.â A Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
Secretary; Long told me to-day that he |
is considering the question of succession
to Rear-Admiral k. O. Mathews as Chief
of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. The :
latter's term of office will end March 16. ;
and he will bÂ« retired on October 24. As
Congress may use additional docks, :
which will have to be built under the â 
direction of the chief of this bureau, the
Secretary is anxious to get a man who
will be able to prepare plans and speci
fications intelligently and be in office long
enough to see that they are properly ex
ecuted. H<> does not propose to have any
trouble such as that which has occurred
in the Brookly Navy-yard with dry
dock No. 3or at Port Royal. Naval Con
structor Bowles might be appointed chief
of the bureau, but his rank in the service
is not sufficiently high. Other officers
whose names have been presented to the
Secretary are Commodore G. C. Remev,
commandant of Portsmouth Navy-yard; ;
Captain A. S. Baker, recently of the bat- !
tleship Oregon, and Commander F. W.
Dickins. assistant to the Chief of the Bu
reau of Navigation.
Secretary I-ong, I understand, favors
placing the Bureau of Yards and Docks â 
under the bureau of Construction and Re
pairs, believing that as naval construc
tors have to dock vessels they should ;
build the docks. Representative Hilborn |
especially is in favor of such transfer.

"You see, to start with," said a Cleveland, Ohio, 'compositor, my work
â that of setting type at the case â allows me little chance for exercise,
and is too confining for anybody who is in the least subject to indiges-
tion or dyspepsia. That has been my trouble for years, and I attrib-

I first heard of them through a fellow-workman who, on hearing my
tale of woe, one day offered me a Tabule and said he would guaran-
tee it to act on the liver. I took it under protest, but was surprised
with the result. It was gentle but effective, and since then I have
gradually noted an entire change in the working of my system, and
I think that pans Taboles are the best remedy for liver and stomach
troubles this side of anywhere. They are really in my case a substi-
tute for physical exercise."

UNCLE SA>I contributed by far
the most brilliant entertainment
that has yet been offered the
Jubilee visitors. His soldiers
presented a programme at the
Presidio yesterday that delighted an
audience of over 20.000 people. Every
event had a thrill in- it. and every move
the soldiers made was greeted -with
round after round of applause. It was
a splendid show, and the Presidio troops
â won a great victory.
The street-car lines were not able to
handle the crowds. Hundreds walked
all the way from downtown districts,
over the hills and across the lots to the
military reservation, and they were not
sorry for It. The United States army
does not often entertain the people it
protects by such displays.
The infantry, the cavalry and the ar
tillery vied with each other to win the
plaudits of the multitude, and the ad
mirers of all these branches of Uncle
Barn's military department were about
equally divided.
Colonel Miles, glittering In gold lace
and snowy plumes and mounted on a
black, prancing horse, took up a po
sition immediately In front of the grand
Btand, and gave orders for the enter
tainment to commence. A review and
march past was the opening number.
The rank and file af the First Infant
ry led the line. The battalion is the
oldest military organization in the
United States. Its ranks were first
filled during the revolutionary war, and
George Washington was once its com
mander. Men who have done much to
make American history have risen from
its ranks. It marched *in review, car
rying the glory of all the honors it has
won. After they had passed the re
viewing stand they stepped aside and
gave the parade ground to the two bat
teries of light artillery and the four
troops of cavalry. The artillerymen
and the troopers went by with their
horses in a sedate walk. Then as they
came around the parade ground again
the pace was quickened to a trot, and
the third time they passed the review
ing stand the horses were in a gallop.
Then came an exhibition of cavalry
maneuvers. The four troops of the
Fourth Cavalry dashed up and down
and across the parade ground in fours
and in column, in troops and battalions,
and the crowd cheered as the horses
and men went dashing by.
Then the two batteries of light ar
lery "volleyed and thundered" over the
parade ground. No stint was placed
on Uncle Sam's powder, and the guns
belched out responses to the cheers of
the admiring crowd. Volleys were fired
from every conceivable formation of
defense and attack lines, and the guns
were whisked up and down the field
through clouds of smoke and dust.
Then came an exhibition of a line of
attack by four companies of the First
Infantry, in command of Captain Par
ker. The distance covered in the ad
vance was 1500 yards, but as the pa
rade ground was only 500 yards long, it
was given in three phases. Scouts were
first pent out to discover the enemy,
and they were followed by a thin skir
mish line. It was to be supposed that
the scouts had found the enemy, and
the skirmishers and their following: re
serves had commenced firing when
they advanced the 500 yards. The sec
ond phase illustrated the advance of

Bpecltl Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
! Washington, Jan. 28.
After a debate, animated at all times
and occasionally acrimonious, which
occupied the greater part of the week,
the Senate this evening, by a decisive
vote of 47 to 32, passed the Teller con
current resolution. The resolution is a
practical reaffirmation of that of Stan
ley Matthews in 1878, and is as follows:
"That all the bonds of the United
States issued, or authorized to be is
sued, under the said acts of Congress
hereinbefore recited, are payable prin
cipal and interest, at the option of the
Government of the United States, in
silver dollars of the coinage of the
United States containing 412% grains
of standard silver, and that to restore
to its coinage such silver coins as a
legal tender in payment of said bonds,
principal and interest, is not in viola
tion of the public faitt nor in deroga
tion of the rights of tne public credit."
All efforts to amend the resolution
â were voted down by majorities rang
ing from five to twenty-nine. Lodge's
gold standard substitute being defeated
by the latter majority. The vote on
the Lodge amendment was: Ayes, 24;
noes, fi3.
The events of the day leading up to
the final vote were full of interest and
importance. It was a field day for the
orators of the Senate, no less than
twenty-five Senators embracing the op
portunity to speak upon the subject un
der discussion. The public interest In
the debate, as was attested by the at
tendance in the galleries, which were
crowded throughout the day, and that
r it was important, was evidenced by the
statements of several of the speakers J
that the discussion was but the prelim
inary alignment of the great political
parties for the contest of 1900.
From 10 o'clock this morning until 7
the line of battle in squads, with re
serves increasing the line as they near
the enemy. The third phase showed
the advance of the full line of battle
by successive rushes until close to the
enemy's lines, when the whole forea
engaged In rapid firing; then, fixing
bayonets, made a charge, dislodging
the enemy from its position, and then
sending volley after volley after the re
treating soldiers.
The cavalrymen gave exhibitions of
fancy riding and maneuvers as if in
action. The men of Troop X, in com
mand of Captain Renson, came on the
ground with their horses unsaddled
and gave an excellent performance of
mounted gymnastics, the principal fea
tures of which were wrestling and hur
dle jumping. One of the men. Private
McGee, when thrown by an adversary
in the wrestling contest, fell from his
horse and struck on his head on the
ground. He was unconscious for a few
momei^s, but he recovered while being
carried off the field, and, staggering
over to his horse and saluting his com
mander, was excused from further
drill, and he went cantering off the
field.
The men of the other troops made
charges on imaginary foes with sabers
and pistols, and the whole cavalry ex
this evening: the contest was continued.
When the voting began It was evident
that party lines were being broken on
both sides of the chamber, but It was
on the substitute offered by L,<klk> â  t
Massachusetts that the most decided
break occurred. On the Republican
side Allison <>f lowa and Burrows <>f
Michigan did not answer to their names
on that roll call, and many Republic
ans voted directly against it. Upon
the final passage of the resolution some
Republicans who supported lfcKinley
and the St. Louis platform in 1896. like
Carter of Montana. Chandler of New
Hampshire. Clark of Wyoming. Pritch
ard of North Carolina, Shoup of Idaho.
Warren of Wyoming and Woloott of
Colorado, voted for the resolution be
cause, as Wolcott announced, they did
not believe the resolution committed
those who supported it to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver.
The first speech of the day in opposition
to the Teller resolution was delivered by
Burrows of Michigan. He said that the
Republican party was pledged to secure
If possible, international bimetallism, and
the President would do everything in his
power to carry out that pledge. Mean
time the existing gold standard would bo
maintained. Until the international agree
ment was secured the purpose of the ad
ministration was to continue the kind of
bimetallism we have now, whereby 500,
000,000 silver dollars were maintained at a
parity with gold. Any proposition which
looks to the abandonment of this posi
tion, which was likely to create a dis
parity between the coins of the country,
was in violation of the public faith and
in derogation of the rights of the credi
tor.
White of California spoke in support of
the resolution, and analyzed sit some
length the position of the Republican
party upon finance. He spoke of the lack
of definiteness of the President's mes
sage on the larger questions. The mes
sage referred to Secretary Gage's plan
and invited inspection. There was no op
position expressed to that plan, "and
doubtless," said White, ''if the President
did not approve the Gage plan he would
have said so." The Senator then referred
ironically to the New York banquet last
night, at which the President spoke.
Fairbanks of Indiana followed against
the resolution. He said the purpose of
the resolution was not frajjkly <-xprÂ«-ss'<l
on Its face, and it was only in the course
of the debate that it developed that the
essential purpose was to give an expres
sion of the United States Senate favora
ble to the free and unlimited coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to L In the
course of his remark?, Fairbanks read a
t'lf^ram received by him from Secretary
Gage as to the methods in paying bonds.
In this Gage stated that gold, when de
manded, is not refused, but, as a matter
of fact, gold is seldom called for, ami few
payments are made in gold. Referring to
Senator Teller's advocacy of free silver.
Fairbanks said that while he did not
question the lofty purposes inspiring the
Colorado Senator, yet they carried him to
the point where all was dependent on
this one question of silver.
Wolcott of Colorado was the first
speaker under the fifteen-minute rule,
which went into effect at 2 p. m. He
thought that any Senator, whatever his
financial views, could vote for the Teller
resolution, and it involved nothing except
carrying into effect the Government's
present obligations. He thought that de
nunciation and abuse heapt-d upon those
who supported the resolution were un
warranted, for he did not think the man
was born who would betray his Govern
ment by offering to pay its obligations i n
spurious money. He referred with scath
ing sarcasm to the sale of bonds by the
Cleveland administration in is:t4, denounc
ing it as one of the darkest pages in
American financial history. He declared
that the men of the West might be en
trusted with the national honor.
Among the other speakers were Fora
ker of Ohio, Chilton of Texas, Nelson of
Minnesota, Allison of lowa, Gray of Del
aware, Allen of Nebraska, Bacon of
Georgia, Tillman of South Carolina,
Galllnger of New Hampshire, Klkins
of West Virginia, Warren of Wyom

North Carolina, Rawlins of Utah. Aid
rich of Rhode Island. Aldrich closed Just
as the clock marked 6. the hour set for
voting, and the Vice-President promptly
announced that the voting would pro
ceed. At this time the galleries were
filled to overflowing, and a largo number
of members of the House, including
Speaker Reed, occupied the area back of
the Senators.

THE WILD WEST SHOW.
Cowboys and Vaqueros Show
Their Skill With the Lariat.
About 1000 persons witnessed the per
formance of the "Wild West Show at
Central Park yesterday. Beginning
with the grand entree, there were eight
een numbers upon the interesting pro
gramme, including the roping and
handling of wild steers by the cowboys
and vaqueros and also the riding of
bucking broncos. Many of the features
of the show were rather tame, espe
cially some of the exhibitions of rough
riding. The lassoing by the vaqueros
and the fancy riding of the cowboys
were, hovever, most excellent and in
ten sting. Frank Steves gave a pretty
exhibition of handling an unmanage
able horse; and there was a Spanish
dance by Senorita de Morales. The
holdup, the capture of one of the
its and his rescue by his sweet
heart a.irain came in for the applause
of the audience. The pony express, the
Indian scalp dance and the race be
l an Indian and a horse were In
teresting features.
der existing laws to maintain the parity
In value of its gold and silver money, so
that thÂ« dollar at dim metal shall for all
monetary purposes . always be equal in
value to the dollar of the other metal."
Vest moved to table the amendment.
The yea and nay vote gave the first test
of the respective elements, resulting 42
to 37 in favor of tabling the amendment.
Then came the Lodge amendment, as fol
lows: "That all the bonds of the United
States issued or 'authorized to be issued
j under the said acts of Congress herein
1 before recited are payable, principal and
Interest, in gold coin or its equivalent,
j and that any other payment without con
sent of creditor would be in violation of
i the public faith and in derogation of his
1 rights." The vote was then taken di
rectly on the amendment, resulting in Its
, defeatâ 24 to 53.
Quay now came forward with a new
amendment, as follows: "Strike out all
after the enacting clause and insert
'That all the bonds or other obligations
of the United States issued or authorized
to be issued under the said acts of Con
gress hereinafter recited should be paid,
principal and interest, in the money that
is the highest money in the world.' " Vest
again moved to table. Carriedâ to 31.
Hoar offered another new amendment
I to go at the close of the resolution as
follows: "That under no circumstances
will the principal or interest of the public
debt be paid in depreciated currency or
in any money other than the best money
of the world." The amendment was
tabled on Vest's motion â to 32.
Foraker proposed an amendment for
merly suggested by Spooner, who was
absent, as follows: "That it is declared
to be the financial policy of the United
States that until there shall have been
obtained an international agreement with
the leading commercial nations of the
world for the free coinage of silver,
which agreement the United States Is
hereby further pledged to promote, the
faith and honor and credit of the United
States are solemnly pledged to preserve
the existing gold standard; and all silver
j and paper currency shall be maintained
at a parity with gold, and all obligations
of the United States shall be maintained
Inviolably at the present standard." The
amendment suffered the fate of those
going beforeâ tabled. 44 to 33.
Hoar presented the same amendment
as the last, proposing it as an additional
section of a separate declaration. This
was lost, the vote being the same as on
the Foraker amendment.
Caffery proposed an amendment as fol
lows: "Provided, that if, at the time of
payment of the principal or interest of
the bonds, the market value of silver is
not at par with gold at the ratio of 16 to
1, the principal and interest shall be paid
gold or silver at the option of the cred
itor. The amendment was tabled without
a yea and nay vote.
This disposed of amendments, and the
decks were cleared for the final vote on
the Teller resolution. The earlier votes
had shown that its passage was a fore
gone conclusion, yet there was the keen
est interest at this culminating feature
of the contest.
"On this vote," announced the Vioe-
President, "the ayes are 47 and the noes

Harveston on the Stand.
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 28.-There was
hardly standing room In the Superior
Court when Constable Joseph Tlarveston
v.;.s called to the stand this morning. Al
though a powerful man, he was complete
ly unnerved at times and became much
excited. He was anxious to tell all the
details of his connection with the Plyler
case, even more than his attorneys de
sired. The case will go to the jury to
morrow.
Before the performance commenced
Mr. Charles Roy read an announce
ment describing the show, and telling
what the various features were (intend
ed to illustrate. He pointed out the
historical importance of many of them,
as showing what the early pioneers
had to contend with. There will be an
other performance again to-day.

STOCKTON. Jan. 28.â The river
steamers are having more trouble be
tween here and Antiooh this winter
than for several years past. The sand
and debris at several points in Stock
ton Channel and the San Joaquin is
washed in the direct course of the
steamers, and the prospect of exceed
ingly low water through the dry sea
son now prevailing would indicate that
heavy dredging must be done or navi
gation will be seriously interfered
with. It is now common for steam
ers to be several hours late through
being caught in the mud and sand.
The J. D. Peters was hung up all
last night within sight of the steeples
of Stockton, and did not get off until
11 o'clock this morning. She left here
last night on time. At Dutchman's
Bend, about five miles below this city,
the river branches, part of the stream
continuing In the old bed and part run
ning through the cut. Across these
waterways there is a wide bar of sand.
The boats can usually pass over this
in safety or can Jump ft by making a
"run" and sliding over the ridge. The
Peters, however, was too heavily laden,
and she stuck when half way over.
She churned the water and groaned for
an hour trying to free herself from the
bar, and finally settled down to the con
clusion that there was no use tryingâ
that she would wait for high tide or for
the up boat to take her off.
Early this morning the T. C. Walker
came along, and she wrestled for two
hours with rope and hawser to take
her sister craft off the perch. Finding
it useless, she went on.
The tide was at its height at 11
o'clock this morning, but at 10:30 it
was high enough for the Peters to float,
and she steamed off and continued her
journey to San Francisco.

Copyright. 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
OTTAWA, Ont.. Jan. 28.â Promoters
of the Yukon transportation 6chemes â
and their name is legionâ are not the
only persons disgruntled at the terms
of the bargain which the Government
has made with MacKenzie & Mann for
the construction of 150 miles of railway
from the head of navigation on Stickeen
River and Lake Teslin. Murmurs of
discontent at the deal, the details of
which have been doled out piecemeal,
are heard on all sides. Now that the
terms are beginning to be understood,
business men, mining investors and in
dependent newspapers are protesting
vigorously. The company, it now ap
pears, is to have the choice of 5000
squara*niles in the Klondike gold fields,
besides a cash grant of $337,000 from the
British Colombia Government.
These lands are to be exempt from
taxation for ten years, and while other
mining companies and miners must pay
a royalty of 10 per cent, the contractors,
behind whom is the Canadian Pacific
Railroad Company, will only contribute
a royalty of 1 per cent on their gold.
But it is the "monopoly clauses" which
are the most distasteful. The first of
these clauses prohibits for five years
any other railway from Alaska through
Canadian territory to the Yukon. The
second prohibits for ten years any other
railway from the British Columbia
coast to the Yukon, thus blocking the
whole coast access, American and Ca
nadian.
BACKED BY PROMINENT MEN.
An Important Company Organized to Operate
Dredges on the Yukon.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 28.â An Im
] portant company has been organized
here with ample available capital to
operate steam dredgers on the aurifer-
I ous bars of the Yukon River and tribu
taries, and also to operate a line of
steamers on the Yukon. The corpor
ation is known as the Stanley Gold
Dredging and Development Company.
It includes men of national reputation,
such as United States Senator Thomas
C. Carter of Montana, Congressmen
Benton McMillin of Tennessee,
James Hamilton Lewis of Washington,
J. E. Osborr. of Wyoming and W. H.
King of Utah, Judge James B. Reavis
of the Supreme Court of Washington.
Governor John R. Rogers, Dr. J. E. Jor
dan an-1 William M. Stanley of Seat
tle, and Henry Croft of Victoria.
Contracts are soon to be placed in
rangements for the fair are by this
time almost completed and the inte
rior of the barn-like structure has been
transformed into such a realistic rep
resentation of the frozen regions of the
North as to send cold chills chasing
up and down the spine of the Califor
nian who is accustomed to green fields
and blossoming flowers the year round.
The opening of the fair itself will be
a feature of more than passing inter
est. Thousands of miles away Presi
dent McKinley will press a button
which will set the historic bells of the
Pavilion Jangling. Fifty taps will be
sounded on the Golden Jubilee bell,
there will be a burst of fireworks from
the dome of the City Hall, the Jubilee
band will send forth a strain of pa
triotic music, accompanied on the out
side by the ringing of factory gongs
and the simultaneous clanging of all
the bells in the city, and the great
Jubilee will be declared over, while the
mining exhibit makes its debut.
Walter B. Rodgers, who will be the
chief musical feature of Bennett's band,
has arrived in the city and brought
with him a supply of the latest and
most delightful music from New Tork,
to tickle the ears of the music-loving
San Francisco, Milwaukee and Seattle :
for the building of dredgers and steam
ers. The scope of the company for the
development of the placer beds of the
Northwest Territory and Alaska in- |
eludes the establishment of a line of {
steamers between St. Michael and up
per river points.

Preceding: the fair will be a short
street parade to start at the corner of
Grove and Polk streets at 7:15, and
pass through the principal streets in
the immediate vicinity of the Pavilion
and disband just as the fair opens at
8 o'clock.
The committee In charge of the fire
works to be exhibited from the dome of
the City Hall has met with such
liberal response from the merchants in
that vicinity that it promises something
altogether out of the ordinary line of
pyrotechnic exhibitions.
A prominent feature of the fair on
the opening night will be the four sur
vivors of Marshall's party â the men
who first saw the shining pieces of
metal which have done so much to build
up this paradise of the Golden West.
They will occupy conspicuous seats on
an elevated platform. President De
nicke will have the honor of introduc
ing to the public Hon. Jacob H. Neff,
president of the California State Min
ers' Association, who will deliver a
brief address. Mayor Phelan will fol
low and introduce Governor Budd. Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes will deliver the ora
tion of the evening, and a quartet will
sing "Hail California." The entire
audience will sing the "Star Spangled

FIXING THE BLAME
THERE is an extremely delicate point of law in
the case of a man who was knocked down by
another and died almost at the instant of the
impact of his head with the floor. A question has
naturally arisen as to whether death was due to the
blow or the shock which, most unhappily, succeeded
the blow. It may even be alleged, such are the nice
ties of the law, that there is nothing to show any
connection between the original thump and the
tumble. Possibly had the forceful fist never been
shot out the person who received it, marked by an
inscrutable providence to have his head cracked,
would have slipped on a banana peel at the instant
or keeled over in a fit or been hit by a piece of
plaster or had a house fall on him. It is hard to fool
the decrees of fate.
Again, when a man strikes another where does the
responsibility end? It might be contended with rea
son as strong as some which have proved effective
that it ends with the delivery of the blow. If the
recipient happen to be sent wrong end up through
space that seems to be his lookout, and if he is care
less enough to come down certainly he must expect
the penalty. However, the problem is to be settled
in the Colorado courts, and save as a matter of gen
eral interest there is no necessity for bothering
with it here. Still, it is pleasing to know there is no
intention of indicting the deceased gentleman fol
suicide.
DEMOCRATIC SECRETS REVEALED
ONE of the results of the struggle over the chair
manship of the Democratic Congressional
Committee which ended in the election of Sen
ator White has been the unloosing of the tongue of
"Buck" Hinrichsen, a candidate for the position, who
regards his defeat as treason to himself and a be
trayal of promises. Talking in wrath and denouncing
his foes, Mr. Hinrichsen is reported to have revealed
some political secrets of interest to the public at
large, and particularly so to the Democratic party.
The story of woe begins at a period preceding the
Chicago convention of 1896. Mr. Hinrichsen, it ap
pears, was at that time working in combination with
a junta of silver Senators to commit the Democratic
party to the cause of free silver, and believed him
self to be one of the inside counselors of the move
ment. Shortly before the Chicago convention met
he learned that the Senatorial junta had arranged to
defeat every Democrat in sight and nominate Sen
ator Teller. At this discovery Hinrichsen and Alt
geld broke away from the combine and tried to de
feat the scheme of the junta by putting Bland of Mis
souri forward as a candidate.
The break in the original combination on the very
eve of the convention threw everything into confu
sion. The silver leaders were able to draw up the
platform and drive the gold men out of the party,
but were not able to nominate Teller against the op
position of Altgcld and Hinrichsen. The situation
was favorable to a bold and skillful orator, and
Bryan was quick to perceive it. He made the famous
speech that carried the convention off its feet and
won the nomination for himself, leaving both wings
of the conspiring combination baffled, balked and
beaten.
That much is ancient history. Its relation to the
present situation is due to a statement attributed to
Hinrichsen that the Senatorial junta defeated in 1896
is once more actively at work. He sees in his defeat
for the chairmanship of the Congressional Commit
tee conclusive evidence that the combine is running
the Democratic party and laying wires for the con
trol of the national convention of 1900.
If this conclusion be correct. Mr. Bryan as well
as Mr. Hinrichsen may be interested in the matter.
It will not be possible for the silver-tongued orator
to repeat at the next Democratic convention the
lucky stroke of 1896. He has talked too much since
that time to accomplish the success of a surprise
party again, and if the declarations of the Hinrichsen
indignation meeting of one have any foundation in
fact the young man from the Platte had better make
himself solid with the Senatorial combine at once or
spend the next two years in steady practice at sawing
wood and saying nothing.
Since it has been determined that men cannot be
arrested for fighting in a Federal building except
through action of the Federal courts, the future for
the pugilist looks bright. If he will only sneak with
his seconds into the national Capitol he will find
several large apartments adapted to his purposes,
and the sedate, not to say busy, officers are not likely
to stop important business to worry over a prize
fight. Also, perhaps they would enjoy the fight.
It is greatly to be feared that Mr. Bennett will not
hereafter entertain for the courts that respect which
is the safeguard of order. They found him guilty
of assault with a deadly weapon, and Bennett, as a
man who cut his wife's throat, knows that anything
short of hanging him would be less than justice.
WISDOM FOR THE UNWASHED.
AT its meeting to-day the Democratic State
Central Committee will be compelled to face
an important political crisis. Fifty-three of
its members declined last summer to pay $30 each
for the prosecution of the campaign for Bryan and
free silver. Under the mlcs of the committee they
may all be expelled for the offense. If at its meet
ing to-day those who did pay the assessment con
clude to dismiss the delinquents the committee, in
stead of consisting of 1.28 members, will consist of
seventy-five In other words, it will represent but
little more than half the Democracy of the State.
An inspection of the names of those who declined
to aid the cause of Bryan and free silver by contri
buting $30 in gold to the Democratic-Populist cam
paign of last year makes it plain that the different
delinquents had different reasons for their recalci
trancy. It is evident that some of them did not have
$30. These members may have intended to pay up
after the advent of free coinage, which its advocates
believe will usher in flush times and plenty of
money. Others probably disapproved of the fusion
with the Populists; there axe many Democrats in
California who thought and still think that the fu
sion was an alliance with the devil. Others still
may have considered $30 altogether too steep a price
to pay for Bryan and free silver. Our own opinion
is that that combination would have been dear at
any price.
But the point at which we arc aiming ought to be
plain to all Democrats. The fifty-three members of
the State Central Committee whom it is proposed to
discipline to-day are evidently mostly men of prin
ciple. At all events they were not slaves to "regu
larity." and for that reason they are, under prevailing
conditions, valuable Democrats. To dismiss them
as is proposed by the slaves of "regularity" would,
in our judgment, be a terrible mistake. The mem
bers of the committee may think we are joking with
them. Probably it is presumptuous on the part of
Â«i Republican paper to express opinions regarding
troubles among the unterrified. But, nevertheless,
we do not hesitate to inform the seventy-five Spar
tans of the Democratic State Committee who are
now contemplating tumbling their fifty-three delin
quent colleagues into the political soup that, in our
opinion, to do so will result in much party trouble.
Regular Democrats as well as regular Re
publicans must be aware of the fact that
party labels no longer hold men together
in California. Everywhere primaries and con
ventions, caucuses and committees are prov
ing ineffective for producing political results. In
dependent voting is now the order of the day. The
people no longer ask whether a candidate is a Dem
ocrat or a Republican. They want to know how he
measures up as a Man. They vote in these days for
men and issues, not according to party labels. It will
be a mistake for the Democratic State. Central Com
mittee to dismiss fifty-three of its members because
they refused to contribute toward a campaign in
which they took no part, because that action will
make exactly fifty-three soreheads who will not hesi
tate to wreak their ve'igeance upon the toppling
Democracy.
The unterrified may regard it as strange that The
Call should offer this advice. There is, however,
nothing strange about it. In the next campaign we
intend to support the Republican ticket. Naturally
we desire an opposition worthy of our mettle. If the
Democrats split their State Committee there will be
nothing to fight. Heaven knows the Democracy will
be weak enough this year even if united.
THE FEDERAL BUILDING.
SUPERINTENDENT ROBERTS has denied
the reports from Washington of the discovery
of quicksand on the site of the new Federal
building and gives assurances that no such quick
sands exist. In a statement made to a representa
tive of The Call he said: "In the report which I
forwarded to Washington last Saturday I made no
mention of quicksand, nor did I even hint that I had
doubts as to whether there is quicksand in the north
west corner of the lot, as I believe the soil there,
if not equally good as in other portions of the site,
is of a character that will support any amount of
weight without danger of sinking."
It is to be hoped the disquieting rumor, to which
Superintendent Roberts has just given the quietus,
will be the last that will be launched against the site
of thenewbuilding. San Francisco would longagohave
had the benefit of the new edifice, and the money put
into circulation by its construction would be promot
ing the general trade and industry of the city, had it
not been for the reports of this kind which have
aroused antagonisms to the work at home and caused
the officials at Washington to hesitate and delay in
undertaking the construction.
Granting as much as can be urged about delay on
the part of the officials of the Government, the fact
remains that San Francisco is without the use of the
r.ew Federal building mainly because of dissensions
among her own people. Certain elements here
have fought against the proposed edifice as bitterly
as if it were something that would injure instead of
help San Francisco. The site has been denounced
as unfit even for the location of a barn. It
has been declared to be a bog, a fen, a lake, a sand
bar, a slough and a mudhole, and the Government
has been warned time and again not to build any
thing on it at any cost.
With the advent of the McKinley administration
The Call, supported by the commercial and labor
organizations of the city, started an earnest move
ment to bring about an immediate beginning to the
work of construction. Petitions were sent to Wash
ington urging action. Our Congressmen were
prompted to press the Government architects to ad
vance the enterprise. These efforts were successful.
The final survey of the site was made, the plan of the
building was decided upon, bids were advertised for
and contracts let. The people, breathing freely in the
belief that the old local fight was over and that the
work would go forward without let or hindrance.
were astounded when the old story of quicksand was
sprung again and for a time feared we were to have
another hitch in the construction of the building.
Fortunately short work has been made of the re
port this time. It has been authoritatively contra
dicted by Superintendent Roberts and will have no
weight at Washington. The work on the edifice
moves steadily along, and despite the opposition of
contentious people who will never forgive the Gov
ernment for selecting a site without consulting them,
we shall in due time see the work completed and our
row Federal building standing among the ornaments
of the city after giving employment to hun
dreds of workinprmen and putting thousands of dol
lars into circulation among our trades and indus
tries.
The possibility that Weyler may be imprisoned is
overshadowed by the somber probability that he
won't be.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 29, 1898.
IN his speech on Thursday night at the meeting of
the national manufacturers in New York Presi
dent McKinley deliberately and studiedly takes
leadership of the movement, in line with his plat
form, to reform our currency and banking systems to
the ultimate of soundness and safety.
His experience in politics serves to convince him
that the fiatists will liave the field to themselves, un
less "the Republicans and those who served with
them in the last campaign"' advance their plan and
stand by it.
This Congress may do nothing in the way of
legislation, but the sound money Republicans and
Democrats did not agree to quit the issue if this one
Congress refused to adopt it. Their battle was begun
to save an irreparable disaster in 1896, but was to
continue until fiatism and empirical finance were
purged utterly out of the system of the republic.
The President is keenly alive to the dangers
ahead, while not forgetful of those past and of the
means and men who faced and foiled them with
self-denying courage. He realizes thoroughly the
need of lining up on the highest statement of prin
ciple and going to the country again if need be for
a second indorsement of the practice of honor in
our finances. This sentence in his speech shows the
clearest comprehension of the duty of the hour:
"Half-heartedness never won a battle. Nations
and parties without abiding principles and stern re
solution to enforce them, even if it costs a con
tinuous struggle to do so and temporary sacrifice,
are never in the highest â degree successful leaders in
the progress of mankind. For us to attempt
nothing in the face of the present fallacies and the
constant effort to spread them is to lose valuable
ground already won and practically weaken the
forces of sound money for their battles of the fu
ture."
The result of 1806 makes it incumbent upon this
Congress to pass sound currency legislation as
much as to reform the tariff. The verdict was
pointedly in favor of removing the disquieting
doubts and the still more disquieting and dangerous
certainties of our patchwork financial legislation.
Since it began in the war emergencies of 1862 to the
Sherman act of iÃgo its every feature has been cas:
to the necessities of some national or partisan emer
gency. The business of the country has not been
consulted. When a new angularity has appeared in
our financial statutes business has patiently warped
itself into it, until trade, distorted, crippled and
aching in every joint and muscle, has not the elas
ticity left to make further contortions. Any further
demands in that direction will cause a break in
btead of securing a bend.
This is so well understood that business is ap
palled at the prospect of being called to put its head
and heels at the same time through the fiat hoop of
Bryan finance; but all men see, as does the Presi
dent, that the hoop act is coming surely, unless
there is an instant revival of courage, determination
and fellowship among the sound money forces.
His speech is a bugle call to the scattering divisions
and to the indifferent and the idle who have been
lulled into a feeling of safety since 1806.
NO DIVISION OF THE STATE
JUST now there is manifest one of the periods
when a notion in favor of dividing this great
State seems to seize upon the editorial mind,
which in certain instances really believes itself to be
in earnest. Of course the matter is not worth con
sidering seriously. We are not permitted to look
centuries ahead. In the future when the editorial
hand of this day has turned to dust and his genius.
soaring aloft, shall be engaged in agitating a scheme
to divide heaven, there may be two California*, or
more. But even this is supposititious, even to the
conjecture that the editor will be in heaven. He
may, instead, be engaged in dividing the other place.
However, the coming centuries may perhaps care for
themselves. There is no need of worrying, and if
our great, great and ten times great grandchildren
choose to cut this glorious domain into as many
States as it has counties now that will be their con
cern. They may do it, too, for every wise father
knows that children are sillier than they were when
he was young.
Yellow journalism prints what it has labeled a
message from Zola. A short time ago it had one
from the wife of Dreyfus. The lady took occasion
to say that the communication was bopus. Zola
is a busy man and may nnr go to this trouble. Still,
it is hardly necessary that he should.
The armed foreigners killed by natives in China
cannot be thrilled over very tearfully. The fact is
that they had no right there, and the Chinese who
slew them arc in exactly the same position morally
as the householder who shoots an invading burglar.
A Los Angeles paper speaks in a commendatory
fashion of "true facts." It is a pleasure to be able
to regard its judgment with favor. The "true" fact
is acknowledged by all competent authorities lo be
superior to any other known variety.

he puffed vigorously at his old clay pipe, which baa

"a bate." the handsomest edition of
a newspaper ever Issued on the coast.
Better than the. Christmas issue of

wearisome, and every reader can find

ahead of The Call's rivnls. To say
that the special train and edition were
appreciated is putting it mild, and
praises from all were constant and

From the London Tlnjes of January 27, J9OO.
As is well-known throughout the '
world, some months ago a treaty for |
the annexation of the United States to

Queen. All the necessary steps for !
the immediate consummation of the !
treaty were taken and the proceed

Unexpected opposition, however, has j

has adopted the unprecedented meas- i

GOOD THINGS IN THE SUNDAY CALL.
DO you think the young men of
to-day have as good a chance to
succeed in life as wh>an you â were
a boy?
It's a big question, a vital
question -when you pause in the
rush of everyday life and consider how
social conditions and business chances
have swung around In the last decade
or so. Think of the matter a bit, and
you'll be surprised at the new condi
tions in life. A number of deep think
ers, like President David Starr Jordan.
W. H. Mills, W. T. Harris and Rabbi
Voorsanger, set forth their views on
this very important subject in next
Sunday's Call. Read their articles, and
you'll be startled at the new condition
of affairs that is confronting the rls
inc Kfneration.
How would you like to be able to earn
528 60 every minute of the day whether
you worked hard or indifferently?
There's a man in this country who earns
that much every time sixty seconds is
ticked off on the clock. He doesn't do
it sawing wood, killing time or coun
terfeiting the national currency, but
he pegs along as earnestly and indus
triously as the big majority of business
men How he is able to make so much,
why he does it and the chances for
ambitious poor folk to imitate his suc
cess are fully set forth in to-morrow's
Call.

ists on his odd case are very interesting. .
The whole story of his crime and his J
peculiar sleep is told in next Sunday's !
Call.
Did you know that in one of the blg
ge-st countries of Europe there is a
section where all the people â men,
women and children â go about on
stilts? The surface of the country is
such that one can hardly get over it
unless he is boosted high in the air.
Hence the butcher, the baker, the can
dlestick maker and the postman hustle
about their^laily duties o-n long wood
en peers. JLnnually these high livers
have exciting stilt races. The whole
country-side turns out to see the sport,
and one of those exciting races is fully
described in to-morrow's Call.
Very shortly the sportsmen of the
State will be firing away at a new bird
that is being rapidly introduced here.
It'l a good game bird, and affords rare
sport. Farmers, as well as sportsmen,
ought to read about this new colonist,
for the article in next Sunday's Call
will toll what experts think of It as a
crop destroyer.
In to-morrow's Call there are lots of
other good things besides special fash
ions from Paris, theatrical, society and
fraternal gossip and all the latest and
best news of the day.
READ THE SUNDAY CALL.
THE RECORD FOR SPEED.
Pasadena News.
The San Francisco Call made record
time on Sunday between San Francis
co and Los Angeles. Sixty miles an
hour with a special train is something
to be proud of, especially when the
mountain grade over Tohachapi is
taken into consideration. The Golden
Jubilee edition was all that can be
claimed for it, and marks a period in
the progress of newspaper enterprise
In the State of California. While not
indorsing In full the policy of The Call,
the News cannot, in justice, ignore the
fact that The Call, under the new
management, is rapidly forging to the
front as a newspaper of the pure typo,
free from the taint of yellow. It is
clean, newsy and fit to be admitted in
to any family circle, facts which will
contribute to Its future success.
A JUBILEE SCOOP.
Merced Evening Sun
The San Francisco Call scooped the
other morning papers in a way that is
sure to make Mr. Hearst's young men
turn green with envy. The Call not
only issued a splendid special Jubilee
edition, but also sent it out to its
country readers by special train. Yes
terday's Call reached Merced before 5
o'clock In the morning, and judging by
the fast time the train was making, it
must have reached Los Angeles short
ly after noon. This is the sort of
newspaper enterprise that the country
people appreciate.
CALL EXCELLED ITSELF
Colusa Sun.
The San Francisco Call has excelled
even Itself In its Jubilee edition, issued
last Sunday. It has a beautifully illu
minated cover and contains cuts of
every phase of mining, from the
rocker to the hydraulic monitor, with
each phase represented in history and
In romance. It is as complete a Jubilee
number as one could imagine, and in
deed it is a wonder how one could con
ceive and carry out so complete apian.
The Call Is fast coming to be all that
great wealth, with consummate busi
ness talent, can make of it.

characteristic modesty, he took the
Government by surprise, but the requi
site instructions have been already
promulgated, and he will be formally
received and entertained with all the
honors which could be paid to the
greatest potentate in the world. It is
understood that President McKinley
will make no official effort to reduce
the opposition to the treaty, but he
will furnish all information which
may be desired in relation to the
United States, and his own presence
will probably avert any further ef
fort by the demagogues who have ven

historical incidents which accompanied
the annexation of Hawaii by the
United States in 189 S.

who has passed
a long life filled

AN t

;; sequence â¦
.. â¦
Nome is in Texas, where he owns a large
cattle ranch not far from the Mexican
border, and his present visit to the city
is made In the effort to find. If possible,
relief from the pains of some old wounds
contracted In the Mexican War, which
have been troubling him of late.
Mr. Blithers Is not here in his entirety.
A portion of him, namely, the lower part
of his left leg-, is on the battlefield of
Shiloh, where he left it something over
thirty years ago. and its place is taken by
a hollow piece of wood which on most
occasions does quite as well as the orig
inal article and sometimes far surpasses
that member in its usefulness. The fol
lowing is an instance when its utility
led to a rather unpleasant sequel. The
good citizen of Texas, whose home is
anywhere near the border, never lets an
opportunity pass of beating the revenue
laws. Many and various are the schemes
concocted for this worthy purpose, and
he who strikes something original rises
in the estimation of his fellows in pro
portion to the success that attends the
effort of his genius. Mr. Blithers tried
various devices, and finally hit upon the
Idea of filling the hollow of his peg with
the contraband stuff. The first time he
put the idea into execution it was an un
qualified success, and great was his con
sequent satisfaction. But unfortunately
his pride would not allow him to keep
the secret to himself, and in a short time
all the ranchers for miles around wÂ« re
made acquainted with his cleverness.
After a while the stock of good stuff
from across the line ran short, and Blith
ers thought he would make another trip.
He got over all right, but on his return
the customs officers pounced upon him
and he had the pleasure of seeing his leg
tapped and the good liquor, for which he
had riaked so much, drunk before his
eyes. The officers confiscated his leg and
horse as a punishment, and it took the
unfortunate culprit two days to mako his
way home through the Uesolato strip of
country that lay between the place of
seizure and his ranch.

much alike that the transient guest who
Intends complaining of Bill often ends by
tipping Fred. These young fellows hall
from the County Connemara, and with
that love of good horseflesh that all true
sons of Erin possess, are continually fig
uring on the relative chances of the va
rious pood things at the track, and en
deavoring to increase their scanty earn
ings by investments on the winners that
they dally pick, after a judicious and
careful consideration of the tips that are
supplied them by the sportively Inclined
guests to whom their failing is known.
The other day one of these guests, who
is interested in one of the books' at the
track, told one of the brothers that he
knew of a horse down to run that after
noon who was bound to win if he did not
drop dead, and that if the elevator boy
wanted to send some money out he would
carry it to the track and place it for
him. The young fellow jumped at thÂ«
chance, and, going down into his pocket,
brought up seven dollars, which he hand
ed to the sport. ,The horse, a slx-to-onÂ»
shot, came in all ri&ht, and when the
bookmaker returned home in the evening
he handed over $42 to the boy who
took him up to his room. Later in
the evening, as he was smoking his cigar
in the office, he was approached by appa
rently the same fellow, who told him that
he saw that the horse had won and who
demanded his money. He was told that
it had been paid, and, after listening to
the story, vanished to return a moment
later, accompanied by his brother, who
denied having received a cent. "Now you
say you have paid In my winnings," said
Bill. "I am sure I have not received a
cent, and Fred swears that he has not.
Can you take your oath as to which one
you gave the money?" The sport had to
confess that he was up a tree as he
could not be certain of either one of
them, but as he claimed thkt he had al
ready made one payment he refused to
make another.
As the matter now stands, the betting
among the other guests of the house la
about even on whether one of the bro
thers has flimflammed the other, whether
the sport has flimflammed the two boys,
or whether the two boys put up a job and
tried to work the sport a second time.

IN YACHTING
Races Are to Be Intro

Launches.
The Race for the Union Gas
Engine Cup to Be a
Yearly Event.
Another Batch of Fortune-Hunters
Left for the Gold Fields on
the Columbia.
A new feature is to be added to
yachting next ..season in the shape of a
series of races for gasoline launches.
A trophy to be known as the "Union
Gas Engine cup," it is said, will bo pre
sented to a committee which will ar
range for a series of contests to be held
yearly. The launch winning the cup
three times will become its owner.
The boats that will take part in this
season's contest will be: G. W. Mc-
Near's, Port Costa; J. Kitterman's,
America: F. Bfoffltt's, Augusta; Dr.
Buckley's, Satellite, and Dr. MeKen
lie's Alberta. The Satellite and the
Alberta are a little smaller than the
others and will have a time allowance,
but the Port Costa, America and Au
gusta all have each fifty horsepower
engines and are about evenly matched.
The Port Costa is so far an unknown
quantity, as she â¢will not be ready for
her trial trip until some time next
month. Quite a number of wagers
have already been made, however, that
she will beat both the America and the
Augusta when they meet.
Gasoline launches are getting into
general use all over the world and the
American make has the preference j
over both those of England and Ger- ;
many. In fact, the San Francisco '
machine has driven the English and
German article out of the Japanese
market. The Coptic will take away
six engines for boats that have been
built to run on the Japanese canals.
The Walla Walla will take away two
for Captain Wooden of Puget Sound.
They will be put in launches at Seat
tle, and will be used in connection |
with the bark Theobold in the Dyea
and Skaguay trade. Two 100-horse- j
power engines will go away on the next
Australian steamer for the New Zea
land Frozen Meat and Storage Com- i
pany. On their arrival at Auckland j
they will be placed in schooners and j
the vessels will then be used to carry '
carcasses from the various yards to the |
freezing works. A machinist from the
Union Gas Company will go with the
machinery to put it together and give
the engineers in Auckland a few les
sons on the running of the engines.
Captain Henderson, formerly master
of the four-masted schooner Golden
Shoiv. has purchased a British ship
that is now on her way from England
to Santa Rosalia. From the latter
port she will come to San Francisco,
where Captain Henderson will assume
command, and put her in the Austra
lian trade.
Horatio Tower, mate of the whaling
bark John and Winthrop, has changed
his mfnd about going to Point Barrow
in search of whales this year, and will
go to the Kotzebue Sound instead.
Eight years ago, when he was mate
of thÂ« schooner Mary and Susan, he
secured quite a number of quartz spec
imens from the natives for a plug of
tobacco. These he presented to his
wife and ever since she has kept them
as a curiosity. Kotzebue Sound as a
mining district had not been heard of
when Mate Tower shipped on the John
and Winthrop. Since then, however,
the expedition by the bark Alaska has
come to the fore and Tower bethought
him of his specimens. He had them
assayed and as they go $20,000 to the
ton he will forsake whaling and go to
the sound in search of the ledge from
which the specimens came.

ALEX BADLAM
LAID TO REST
Grief-Stricken Relatives and
Sorrowing Friends Sur
round His Bier.
His Remains Are Placed in the
Receiving Vault at Odd Fellows'
Cemetery.
The last act closing the life drama
of Alexander Badlam was solemnly
performed at his late home on Frank
lin street yesterday afternoon by his
grief-stricken relatives and Borrowing
friends.
The religious ceremony over the dead
was performed by the Rev. Robert
Mackenzie of the First Presbyterian
Church, and conformed to the ritual
of that creed. The exercises con
sisted of the reading of prayers and
the chanting of hymns, at the conclu
sion of which the preacher made a few
remarks in eulogy of the career of the
deceased, paying a touching tribute to
his memory.
As it was the last wish of Mr. Bad
lam to have flowers omitted at the fun
eral obsequies, his wi^h was rigorous
ly adhered to by his friends and rela
tives; and with the exception of a
sheath of wheat, which was placed on
top of the black pall covering the me
tallic casket, and a few flowers made
into the form of pillows, there was a
total absence of floral offerings.
Those who acted as pall bearers were
for the most part Intimate friends of
the deceased, and many of them had
known him for years, and dated their
friendship back over the sixty-seven
years of his well-spent life to the time
when he was a mere boy. The pall
bearers were Fulton G. Berry, Judge
J. D. Murphy. General W. H. L.
Barnes, Charles G. Lathrop, Joseph
Spear, Thomas R. Hayes, Theodore
RWkard and Eugene Levy.
The remains were conveyed to the
Odd Fellows' Cemetery and placed in

SAYS HE HAS
A CONTRACT
D. G. Coy Enters Complaint
Against the Southern
Pacific.
Claims There Was an Agreement to
Carry Flour at $3
Per Ton.
If the statements maflp by P. (1. Coy,
a grocer of Woodland, before the
Railroad Commission ran be sub
stantiated by that gentleman the
Southern Pacific Company will have
hard work explaining away a certain
telegram which it sent to Coy inform
ing him that a rate of $5 per ton would
be accepted by the company as long
as he continued to ship flour from
Eugene, or., to Woodland, CaL
The matter was brought to the at
tention of the commission in the form
of a formal complaint made by Coy
against the Southern Pacific for non
fulfillment of a certain contract alleged
to have been made with the complain
ant in the form of a telegram.
It seems that Mr. Coy, who is en
gaged In the wholesale and retail gro
cery business in Woodland, had been
accustomed to purchase his flour from
the Sacramento mills and have it sent
down to his store in Woodland. Fin
ally, however, after the flour trust had
been formed, the Sacramento mills
raised the price of the article, and ac
cording to the complaint tried to dic
tate to Coy the figure at which he
should retail it to the farmers with
whom he deals. This figure was so high
that the farmers found it cheaper to go
to Sacramento themselves and buy
their flour, and while there would also
purchase th< ir other grocery supplies.
ThiÃ forced Coy to look elsewhere
for a more satisfactory depot of sup
plies, and finding that he could pur
chawc his flour at Eugene, Or., much
cheaper than the Sacramento mills
would let him have it, he telegraphed
C. F. Sraurr, then in charge of the
Southern Pacific freight department,
askinu what rate the company would
make him on his shipments from that
place to- Woodland. Ke received a re
ply in which, as he claims, he was told
that he could ship as long as he wished
for $5 a ton.
This enabled him to sell the flour at
Woodland 35c a sack cheaper than was
possible when he bought at Sacra
mento and at a profit of 40 per cent
more than when he was a customer of
the mills at that place.
This arrangement with the railroad
people continued until Dor ember 7, 1897,
when Coy was informed that after Jan
ary 1, 1898, the rate would be 57 per
ton. Hence the complaint that was
presented to the commission yesterday.

SINKING FUND
FOR DEPUTIES
Su ms Deducted From Em

S. Kampe, the broker and member of '

of tickets and pays for them out of
this private fund. In that way all are
taxed equally, and the burden is imper
ceptible tv anybody. The copyists in
the Recorders office are paid by the
folio, and average from $75 to $90 a
month. I suppose they contribute to
this fund in proportion to their earn
ings, and the amount of their liability
is sent to me by the chief deputy,
which I hold out when I cash thÂ«ir
warrants and turn over to him. Last
month I cashed warrants for eieven
employes of that office, deducting H so
from each, that being the amount Mr.
Cooney notified me to retain, and which
I gave to him. It usually amounts to
between $40 and $50 a month. Before
cashing the warrants, I invariably ask
the men if the amount I have been in
structed to deduct is correct, and I
j have never yet had one of them dis
pute it.
'â¢This I testified to before the Grand
Jury yesterday. While Maloney was
in the office 1 cashed his warrants for
! him, and s^me of the orders on the
Auditor I took out there with me. I
; was told that Maloney had testified
| that he nerer received more than $I'>">
I for a single month's work, so I showed
the Grand Jury where I had cashed a
warrant for him for $215 64 in January,
1897. He was enabled to earn that
amount through Glynn's kindness in
1 giving him extra work, as he had told
his chief that he was in a bad way
financially and could not meet his pay
ments on his house.
"Several months ago I received a let
ter from Mr. Glynn asking me to ad
vance Mrs. Maloney $40, and requesting
me not to cash any more warrants for
Maloney, but to give the money to his
wife. This I did up to the time of his
dismissal, and Maloney has never been
in my office since his wife first called."
Mr. Maloney said, in answer to the
broker's testimony regarding the reg
ular monthly assessment, that in all
the time he was in the Recorder's of
fice there were only two assessments,
one being to aid Glynn in his political
fight, and the other to purchase a
music box for Mrs. Cilynn.
Mr. Glynn substantiates Mr. Kampe's
statement in every detail, and pays he
has placed a letter written by Maloney
to him in the hands of the District At
torney to lay before the Grand Jury at
its next session. In this letter, he saye,
Maloney expresses his gratitude for fa
vors shown him by his chief in strong
est terms.

TO REMOVE AN EVIL.
Property-Owners on Mason Street
Want Disreputable h|ouses
Suppressed.
Property-owners on Mason street, be
tween Kddy and Ellis, and the Immediate
neighborhood are nlgning a petition which
will be presented to-day by Attorney
Samuel Regensburger to Chief of Police
Lees asking him to enforce the Penal
Code against the people who occupy dis
reputable houses on the west side of the
street between Kddy and Kllia. The pe
tition alleges that the houses In question
depredate the value of property and pre
vent respectable people from leasing
houses in that block.
The petition Is signed hy Mrs. J. C. Mo-

James O. Bennett, who attempted to
cut his wife's throat and was convicted
of an assault with a deadly weapon in
Judge "Wallace's court last Thursday, is

tho more serious charge and expresses
content in his fate. At the outside, he
can only get two years in prison, while
on the other charge he mipht have been

TAILORS FORM
ANOTHER UNION
New Local to Be Affiliated
With the National
Body.
A Little Hard Feeling Just at Present,
but No Serious Clash Is
Expected.
A mass meeting of the Journeymen tail
ors of this city was held in Union Hall,
1159 Mission street, on Thursday, for the
purpose of organizing a branch of the
Journeymen Tailors' Union of America,
and a temporary organization was ef
fected.
There has been for some time an organ
ization of tailors known as the Journey
men Tailors' Protective and Benevolent
Union, composed mainly of the high
priced tailors. This organization was not
affiliated with any central body, and ex
ists In this city alone. The national or
ganization h.us found It a constant men
ace to the Interests of union tailors, as
workmen coming from tho Kasi are un
able to j"in it by depositing a traveling
card and It can neither issue cards to tail
cis going <Â«ut of the dtjr nor uphold a
union label. Accordingly Organizer E. S.
Chrlstophersen was dispatched to this
city with instruettQll to draw the local
union Into the national body if possible,
and in the event <>t" his failure to do this
to organize a new local union, which
would be chartered from the national.
He arrived In tti.s dry about two w.-eks
;ni at once commenced his labors
Mini: Bhop meetings of both union
and non-union shops, In which work he
My assisted l>y the organizing com
mittc- of tin San Francisco Labor Coun
cil. The majority <>f the members of the
Independent local union did not take very
kindly to the Idea of affiliation, and at
their last meeting a resolution providing
for affiliation was defeated, and Mr.
Christophersen th< n called a mass meeting
of organized and unorganized tailors in
thÂ»> ciiv f.ir last Mght.
At the meeting much enthusiasm was
manifested and a temporary organization
was easily effected. J. T. Kllsworth was
elected temporary chairman and George
Nesblt temporary secretary. A prelimin
ary moting will !><â¢ held at 1159 Mission
street next Monday evening, when It la
expected that a permanent organization
will be effected.
WEIRD PARADE
OF MEDICOS
With Skull Â©nd Crossbones
They Will March Through
the Streets.
A College Yell That Will Positively
Wake Up the
Dead.
If the medical and dental students con
nected with the College of Physicians
and Surgeons in this city carry out their
original intentions San Francisco will be
treated to a novel though somewhat
greWMMM spectnele on this evening,
and timid people had better keep off Mar
k< t street and rmi.iin in the peaceful
seclusion <>f their homes.
These emliryotic medicos and dentists
will turn out and march to the Pavilion,
to be present at the opening of the Min
ing Fair, an 1 with them, as accessories,
will appear all the paraphernalia peculiar
to their profession and some bones of the
cadavers on which they have operated.
At their head will be a huge red banner,
with skull and crossbones done in white
bunting, with the letters C. P. S. under
neath. This will prepare the courageous
beholder for gravt r things to come.
Each participant will carry a "femur,"
or thigli bone, and its somber aspect will
be to sc.me extent relieved with a bow of
white and red ribbons. The reputed
comedians of the college will be distin
guished from the others by carrying a
hone called the "humerus." so named
because of its connection with the funny
bone, and it is expected that the bright
shafts of wit that will emanate from the
aforesaid comedians will obviate the ne
cessity of illumination along the line of
march and will do away with the need
less expense of burning fireworks.
Various other bones, weird relics of
individuals who have departed this sphere
and upon whom the 1 students have experi
mented, will be seen in this parade, and
one enterprising member expressed his
Intention of exhibiting a skeleton in its
entirety, but he was opposed by the rest,
and ho this feature will be eliminated.
There will also be seen saws, forceps,
scalpels, and In fact everything apper
taining to the two professions.
They will have their college yell, too,
and it is said to be the most blood
curdling one ever invented and will cause
dead bones in our cemeteries to turn
o\'-r and rattle In their graves.
The students, to the number of 200,
will be headed by the First Infantry
band. and after gazing on the wonders
of the Mining Fair they will march to
the California Hotel, where they will par
take of a sumptuous banquet and listen
to Bet speeches by the college faculty.
THE TRAFFIC IN DOGS.
John h|iggins and James F'ynn
Plead Guilty to Petty
Larceny.
The two men, John Higgins and James
Flynn, who were arrested some days ago
for stealing big dogs in the Mission and
selling them to paroles who were going to
the Klondike, pleaded guilty in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday to petty
larceny and were ordered to appear for
sentence this morning.
James Brownie, a bartender in a saloon
on Fulton and Larkln streets, testified that
he had purchased thirteen dogs from the
two defendants, giving them from $5 to
$10 for each dog. He was to leave for the
Klondike In a few days and intended tak
ing the dogs with him.
DENIED THAT
THEY ELOPED
An Oakland Couple Jour
neys to Martinez to
Be United.
Ceremony Performed by a Civil
Officer, as Church People
Are "Poor Pay."
The Wife Will Go on a Honey
moon All by Her
self.
It would seem that residents of Oak
land find no truth In the oft-re
peated saying that a secret would die In
that city before it would be discovered.
H. C. Coward of the Oakland Salt
Works does not think so, nor does Miss
Ella May Spear, a pretty resident of the
I Athenian town. Both these persons
thought it best to hie themselves to an
i other burg to become united, as they
wanted no one to know of It.
With this object In view both packed
small gripsacks and left for Martinez
last Wednesday, where they were made
one by a Justice of the Peace. Immedi
ately after the marriage they boarded a
train and returned to Oakland and took
up temporary quarters at the Hotel
Pleasanton.
No one was to know anything about the
marriage, but strange to say a few inti
mate friends were taken into the secret
to help keep it quiet.
Like all secrets it soon leaked out and
Mr. Coward was asked about it. He de
nied at first that there was a marriage,
and further stated that he did not know
Miss Spear. He suggested that his brother
might have been the one to do a thing
like that, but heâ never! The brother not
having returned, the visitor was Invited
to a seat and Mr. Coward gently tried to
find out how much was known. Con
vinced that It was all out, he volunteered
the statement that he was the one who
had been married.
"I didn't want it all over town," he
said, "because I did not think it was
anybody's business. We did not elope,
but only went to Martinez, so as to have
a quiet wedding. We Intended going to
San Rafael, but it was too far away.
"We were married by a Justice of the
Peace, as I am not much of a church
man; and anyway I have too many of
them on my books and they never pay.
1 told my wife that I could not afford a
big celebration, as my business waa de
strayed by tire a few months ago. She
was perfectly willing that it should be
quiet, but wanted it to come oft* at once.
we (io not intend to go on a honeymoon,
but I think my wife will take a sort of
one by going on a visit to her sister in
Fresno. Just as soon as she returns we
will go to housekeeping."
Mrs. Coward was unwilling to submit
her views on the affair, but sent word by
her husband that it was not an elope
ment.
Italian Concert.
A second operatic concert will be given
to-morrow afternoon at the Metropolitan
Temple by Mazzi, Collenz. Cioni and
Masiero, late of the Del Conte Opera
Company. Martinez will be the pfano ac-
COBlpaniSt and soloist.
SLEPT LIKE A CHILD.
GAINED TWENTY-SEVEN POUNDS IN FOUR
WEEKS.
THE STORY OF A SOLDIER.
From the Transcript, Peoria, 111.
No man is better known and liked In
that rich tier of Illinois counties. of which
Peoria is the center, than genial Chester
S. Harrington of Princeville, 111. For
many years Mr. Harrington has traveled
through the country on profitable jour
neys as an itinerant merchant, and every
where he goes he is given a hearty wel
come by the people who depend upon his
regular visits for the purchase of the
necessaries, and some of the luxuries of
life.
Mr. Harrington is a vrteran of the war,
and out of this circumstance grew the
train of acts that make up the remark
able experience which he related upon
the occasion of a visit to the Transcript
office recently. His story, telling of the
evils of which the Civil War was but the
beginning in his own, and in thousands of
other eases, was as follows:
"I served three years in the One Hun
dred and Twenty-fourth Illinois, enlisting
at Kewanee. 111. I was in Libby Prison,
and, of course, I suffered, like many an
other Northern soldier. Until recently I
was a member of the Princeville Post of
the G. A. R.
"The strain of army life did its work
in tandermining my health, although the
collapse did not come for years. For some
time I suffered from general debility
and nervousness so badly that I could not
I sleep. I would sit up night after night
nailing, because I couldn't get to sleep.
For fifteen years my sleep was complete
ly broken up. Indigestion, of course, re
sulted and my misery increased until it
j seemed 1 had nothing to live for. My eyes
began to fail, and a-s my body lost vital
ity my mind seemed to give way also. I
could scarcely remember events that
happened but a. few weeks before.
"I was unfitted for business, and had to
abandon the road for two years. I was
just able to creep around during the
' greater part of this time, and there were
times when I could not get up at all. My
, brother is a doctor, but all his efforts to
i help me failed to gtve me any relief.
"My friends suggested a great many
'â  things they thought would help me. and
! 1 tried a lot of remedies, without avail.
I Finally, having read a great many arti
i cles regarding cures that had been ef
â  fected by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
: Pale People, I decided to try them. That
i was in 18%. I bought a box and took the
i pills according to instructions. Just four
j days later I had the happiest hours I had
known for years. That night I went
to sleep easily and slept soundly as
a child and awoke refreshed. Since
I then I have clung tight to Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills, and I have slept soundly and
gained health ever since. Three or four
weeks after beginning the treatment,
I when I had taken four boxes of the pills,
i I found I had Increased in weight from
i 119 pounds to 146 pounds. This greatly
j surprised my friends who thought that
Imy case was a hopeless one. I began my
work on the road again and I have con
tinued it right along ever since in excel
lent health.
"Let me tell you a remarkable thing
that was a side issue, but a valuable gain
to me. I found that while I was taking
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills I had been cured
of the smoking habit, which hnd been
formed when I was a boy, 6 years old,
j and which had clung to me all these years.
'. The craving for tobacco left me and I
have never experienced it since. I have
n< -ommended the pills to more than 150
people and I hope, if my experience is i
I made public, it will be of benefit to some
sufferer."

WORLD OF SPORT
RANDOM NOTES
ABOUT
THE GALLOPERS.
It may be a subject for future contem
plation and regret among some of our
breeders that the big lumbering brown
horse Stromboli was allowed to be re
turned to his home in the land of the
Southern Cross neglected and neariyover
looked. When first brought to this coun
try by the late C. Bruce Lowe he was
placed in training, and under the guid
ance of Dan Halliday ran a number of
very creditable races at the old Bay Dis
trict track, one of his wins being at the
long price of 40 to 1. His suspicious leg
finally prevented further racing, and
he was bred to a number of mares, but it
was said a flaw in his pedigree held pros
pective buyers aloof. At any rate he was
one day put aboard of a steamer and
sailed away to Australia.
And now comes the first crop of two
year-olds. Banewor, a daughter of his,
brought the name of the departed brown
horse before the public by winning very
impressively the first time out with the
silk up, stepping off the three and a half
furlongs within half a second of the
coast record. Burns & Waterhouse, the
filly's owners, then began looking about
for more of his progeny.
Tom Boyle was the possessor of a big
colt by the Australian who loafed along
in his gallops until touched up one morn
ing with the whip, when he nearly ran
from under his rider. Willie Martin was j
then placed on the colt's back and he
ran four furlongs so handsomely that |
Burns & Wateihouse wrote out a check j
for $2500 and the i-mbryo racer changed
hands then and there. This looks a big
price to pay for an untried two-year-old,
and his career will be watched with in
terest. His dam. Clara D, produced Chev
alier, which never showed to be any
thing more than an ordinary Belling
plater.
An Eastern exchange states that the
managers of the Barksdale track gave a
bonus of $50 to every jockey landing a
horse winner with odds of over 10 to 1
against It, and that the California rider
Karvaez was one of the first to get the
coveted prize. On perusing this little
item a well known Eastern owner re
marked: "Well, it would be a good plan
if the management of the two big Cali
fornia tracks would hang up the. same
amount for every jockey finishing in
front astride a favorite."
Both Fleur de Lis and The Roman are
carded to be taken East and started in
one or more of the big spring handicaps
The run of The Roman on Thursday and
the defeat of Buck Massie by Stemler's
mare yesterday will probably not have
the effect of lessening their Imposts with
the handicapper. Perhaps when the
weights and entries are issued in the
near future the respective owners will
have changed their minds.
Many are inclined to look upon the per
formance of The Roman in Thursday's
handicap as a marvelous performance,
but the writer cannot see it in that light.
It was a rare good one, but not a great
run. To begin with, Morellito, the three
year-old, carried within one pound of his
entitled weight at the distance. Gazing
back through the formbook it will show
that Torsida, Count of Flanders and
some of the other three-year-olds have
taken the measure of the son of Morello.
On form, if Count of Flanders had been
one of the starters in the race he could
have strolled in at leisure. Another
thing, Ingleside track Is much faster than
formerly, and people are too prone f call
It slow; allowing two or three seconds
difference in time between it and Oak
land.
Conley is no longer worshipped as the
Idol of purity. On his arrival here his
admirers were wont to say that a barrel
of Klondike nuggets would not tempt the
colored wonder. Now. on several sides
complaints are heard of poor rides, which
are blamed to inactivity on the part of
"Longsbot." The game here is rotten to
the core, but it is to be hoped that Conley
has not met the tempter and fallen. He
can ride at a very useful weight and has
a brilliant future before him.
Since yesterday's race the Eddie Jones
Btock has faljen a trifle. The Morello
colt shouldered 12") pounds and made a
very creditable showing, but it was
pounds below hfs real form. It was gos
siped around the ring before the race
that the youngster had been given very
little work since his win of the stake at
Oakland on January 22. At that time he
looked as though a rest up would dn him
no harm, and thore is little doubt bat
that In the future he will redeem him
self. On the occasion of their match
race Jones gave Torsida a twenty-pound
beating, and there must be some cause
for his indifferent showing yesterday.
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
OARSMEN ENTER THE
BASEBALL FIELD.
Some two hundred enthusiasts braved
the chilling: north wind that swept over
the Presidio Athletic grounds last Sun
day to witness the Ariels and Dolphins
open a series of baseball games to be
played by nines from the various rowing
clubs of the bay. The game proved a vic
tory for the Ariels. Those who went to
Bee ragged ball were very much disap
pointed. For four innings both nines
played like pennant winners, Roach of
the Dolphins holding the opposing side
down to two hits, while O"Connell. the
Ariel twirler, proved almost as big a
conundrum to the boys from North
Beach. The score at the end of the
fourth was two to one in favor of the
Dolphins. The fifth, however, proved a
veritable Klondike to the Ariels, and
from that time to the end of the game
their lead was never lessened. The score
was Ariels 18, Dolphins 7.
The next game will probably be be
tween the South Ends and the Ariels. To
morrow evening in consequence of their
defeat the Dolphins wil banquet the vic
tors.
Baseball has not, however, diminished
the Ariels 1 interest in rowing. Though
the weather of late has hardly been fav
orable to aquatic sports still the Ariels
have managed to keep their muscles lim
bered up. Not a Sunday passes that the
Eintraoht crew under the coach of J. B.
Barteaux does not take its weekly spin
of six miles, covering the stretch be
tween the boat house and Hunters Point.
Captain Ellis has started on the selection
of the senior crew. A number of new as
pirants for skiff honors have come to the
fore, notably William How and James
O'Connell. The Ariels have always h. Id
the championship in skiff events until
their hopes were upset at the last re
gatta. The lesson will, doubtless, prove
a good one.
Owing to the influx of members, the
Ariels have built forty new lockers to
accommodate the same. Much talk re
garding the purchase of a new racing
barge has been going on. and the chances
are that the natural enthusiasm that will
be awakened as the rowing season opens
will Induce them to do so. For the past
four years the lack of a good up-to-date
barge has been the main drawback to
their crews.
As soon as the Dolphins get over the
effects of their banquet they expect to
get down to active training. Prepara
tions for their picnic which is to be held
in February or March are under way. As
the proceeds will be used in building a
new racing barge every effort will be
made to make the affair a success. It
Â». l al^ that a week b efore the outing a
high Jinks will be held. Pape and Patch
will doubtless row the last race in the
series for the diamond medal. On the
"arne da >" jt ls expected that the junior
skiff men will compete for the Treadwell
medal.
W B. Hinchm.in was presented with a
handsome gold locket by the members of
the Alameda Rowing Club
WATER POLO CONTEST.
One of the most Interesting games of
water polo ever witnessed on the Pa
cific Coast will take place about the
middle of February at the Luriine Baths
between the Lurline Amateur Polo Team,
holders of the Spreckels cup. and the pro
fessional team of the California Swim
ming Club. After two years of match
making they have been brought together
tor the first time, and a great contest
will ensue. Among the players are tome

Louis Relnstetter Caused a Sen
satior) on poison) Street.
Louis Reinstetter, a marble cutter liv
ing at 416 Hayes street, created a sen.
sation on Folsom street, between Eighth
and Ninth, yesterday morning. He had
gone to the Vermont marble yard, on
Brannan street, to work, but was told
there would be nothing for him for a
couple of days. While walking along
Folsom street on his way back he grabbed
hold of a lady, and her screams brought
a crowd of men to her assistance. Reln
stetter ran along the street, pursued by
the mob, until he was finally captured
It would have gone hard with him if
a policeman had not appeared on the
scene. The officer saw at once that Rein
stetter was mentally unbalanced and he
rang for the patrol wagon and had him
taken to the Receiving Hospital There
he was so violent that it took the com
bined strength of five men to lock him up
in a padded cell. His brother called at
the hospital and said that Louis was
yery religiously inclined, and as he had
been very sick more or less recently Mb
brain had become affected.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JAXTJARY 29, 1898.
OLD SOL AGAIN
SHINES
ON PUGILISM.
At last It really appears as If the City
Fathers have recovered from their at
tark of coynese In the matter of refusing
permits for boxing contests to the local
clubs, and It will not be long until lovers
of the ring will be given opportunities
again to feast their eyes on the old la
mlllar sights. When the board granted a
permit to the Empire Club the Ice was
broken, and although the original inten
tion may have been to put up a sign,
"Danger!" near the break. It was hard to
see how the other clubs could be held off
without the appearance of rank favorit
ism. So three were granted yesterday.
Buena Ventura, Daughter of Luke Blackburn and Tommy Bell, Winner of the First
Two- Year-Old Event This Season.
Tet there Is no doubt of onÂ© thingâ that
Is, that the local clubs themselves are
largely responsible for the "frost" that
has lately scintillated on the gloves.
When they had things all their own way,
permits could be had for the asking, and
the public was taking enough Interest to
spend the glittering ducats on every cred
itable performance, the so-called "fight
promoters," In their blind avarice, pro
ceeded to hit the old goose that was lay-
Ing the golden <*Rg a whack on the head,
from which she is recovering but slowly.
In the first place, these Interested per
sons began to scramble over one another
in their endeavors to get the most per
mits, fearing that somebody would make
more money than the rest. Then some of
them Joined the ancient order of knights
of the sledgehammer, and did their very
best to "knock" everybody else in sight.
Not content with this display of Jealousy.
Borne of them even resorted* to the expe
diency of placing events on the board that
were a disgrace to pugilism; such, for
instance, as the Sharkey-Goddard amour.
And when the crash came these persons
were the loudest calamity-howlers.
It is hoped by all admirers of the manly
art that these things will not be repeated,
as many performances of that kind, com
ing after the Fltjssimmons fiasco, will lay
the old goose out dead as the proverbial
doornail.
Among those contests expected for the
future, one of the most interesting: ca.n
not fail to be that between George Green
and Tommy Ryan. th>- famous welter
weight. The National Club was notified
by telegram Thursday that Ryan would
board a "flyer" to-morrow and start for
this city. It Is the intention to match the
men to fight at catch weights some time
during the latter part of next month for
60 per cent of the gross reo-ipts. Gr<i-n
will have a slight advantage, probably.
ln the matter of weights, but realizes that
his man is a winder, and has already
gone into training. George has not yet
recovered from the sting of his defeat at
the hands of Joe Walcott. "the nachal
bo'n fightah," and will strain every nerve
to recover his lost laurels.
Another contest that fistiana is bear-
Ing well in mind is the proposed little
argument for superiority between the
"I-os Angelas Giant," Jim Jeffries, and
Thomas Sharkey, alleged warm exponent
of the iodine process in affairs financial.
It is commonly believed that this would
be a terrific encounter while it lasted, as
the men are both rough and heavy fight
ers, although few think the Vallejo ma
rine would fall to meet a Waterloo, with
no Grouchy on whom to lay the blame.
Jeffries' manager, Billy Delaney. has in
formed the National Club men that iiis
charge is ready for the fray any time a
permit can be had Sharkey, however,
shows a disposition to talk Klondike.
Other good event* are promised which
the sporting world is eager to have ma
terialize. But all unite In saying that no
more grasping for all In sight and no
more fake contests should be permitted
If they are, the sport will die a natural
death, in case the Supervisors do not en
ter the field with another attack of the
marble heart, and. In the language of
'Master of Cere-monks" Jordan. "Those
gents are likely to take a funny streak
at any old time."
At yesterday's meeting of the Health
and Police Committee, Chairman Delaney
and Supervisors Rivers. Rottanzl. Has
kins and Dovany present, permits for
contests were granted to the Olympic
Club, the National Club and the Occi
dental Club. Tho Olympics will give a
professional boxing contest in their club
rooms on the evening of February 3. The
committee will recommend that in this
case the usual license fee be remitted.
With no discussion whatever, the com
mittee voted to further recommend that
the Occidental Club be granted a permit
for a contest between March 1 and 15 and
for an exhibition by the Nationals be
tween February Â£0 and 28.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
soon move into Its new building on Sixth
and Shipley streets. The membership of
the club Is now about 200. It has turned
out some of the best boxers and wrest
lers on the coast.
The new rooms will ue ready about
February 6, and will be fitted up with all
the paraphernalia dear to the heart of the
athlete. The first exhibition in the clubs
new quarters will be on the evening of
February 7, at which time Alex Greg
gains. Frank McOonnell and other well
known boxers will engage in scientific
sparring.
CHECK TO BE
PUT ON
PACED RELAYS.
The racing committee of the C. A.
C. C. will present an important amend
ment at the next meeting of the boarJ
on February 5, calculated to check il
legal pacing in the annual relay. It
is in effect that the committee shall
have power to appoint two judges for
each relay who shall patrol their re
spective relays and shall be empowered
to disqualify any rider \vh<* vio'ates
the rules. Such disqualification shall
be final. If this amendment passes, it
will probably have the desired effect.
Owing to the withdrawal of the Im
perial Cycling Club from the Cycle

Vereln game John Mendel], a fielder
for the former nine, broke his arm
from throwing a ball.
The Bay City Wheelmen will have a
billiard and pool tournament next
month, commencing the 12th. Entries
close the 9th.
The Imperial Club members are look-
Ing forward with considerable pleasant
anticipation to their private masquer
ade on the evening of February 2 at

Captain Loos of the Olympic "Wheelmen
has appointed Lyman W. R. Cole as sec
ond lieutenant.
R. C. Lennie la back from the north,
and will leave in a fortnight for a trip
through Arizona and Southern California.
Bald is reported to have cleared $12,500
by his last season's work. Morin, the
Frenchman, made $13,500, and Bourrlllon
$15,000. Michael cleared twice as much as
Bald, his contests being for much larger
purses and fewer in number. Michael
won thirteen races, and only lost one.
He rode thirty exhibitions. Michael has
received many offers to go on the stage
and ride exhibitions on indoor tracks, at
a fabulous salary, but has declined all
of these, and after a much-needed rest
will prepare for a season of match races
in 189 S.
A. P. Swain, ex-president of the C. A.
C. C. fell from his wheel in the suburbs
of Oakland the other night, but fortunate
ly escaped serious Injury. A slight cut
on the back of his head was sowed up
by a neighboring druggist, whose ac
quaintance with Al's cycle racing pro
clivities led him to remark that that was
not the first time Al had been "sewed
up" on the road.
The famous Austral wheel race was run
in Melbourne December 18. The weather
was fine, and the estimated attendance
was from 25,000 to 30.000, the gate receipts
netting over $6000. The final was marred
by a fall, which threw Jackson, Walne,
Herd. Jewell and G. S. Scott out of it.
The finish resulted as follows: J. Carpen
ter, i-.j yards, first; A. J. Bode, 20 yards
second; J. T. Scott, 260 yards, third; A.
J. Berry. 145 yards, fourth. The first prize
was flOOO; second, $500; third, $125. James
Carpenter, the winner, is one of Victoria's
champion road riders.
Floyd A. McFarland. the San Jose rac
ing man, was in the city on a visit for a
few days this week.
"Brick" Kuhn, well-known in trade cir
cles, is in town, after an absence of sev
eral months. He is handling a new line
and has to cover the entire Pacific Slope
so his stay will be brief.
The Pan Francisco Road Club held a
jollification at the club house on Golden
Gate avenue last Monday night, which a
large number of members attended.
<;<ars for the coming season on the rac
ing path will be greatly Increased. Cycle
Ape says that American racing men will
follow the example of the foreigners, who
use much larger gears than have ever
b^en tried in this country. The ease
with which Gougoltz, the Frenchman
sprinted with a 96-gear, surprised the men
he defeated. A majority of the Ameri
cans use an 80-gear, and yet they could
not hold Gougoltz's sprint.
O. L. Pickard, of the Acme Club, Oak
land, who has been the assistant trainer
of Jimmy Michael in the East the past
season, has been secured to handle Tav

firm, states that on a recent trip to Baden
he was told by resident sportsmen that
the shooting is better than it has been
in years. San Francisco is well repre
sented in that place, and generally where
any kind of game is to be bagged in
abundance.
A stranger wandered into Shreve's gun
store yesterday and stated, while mak
ing a purchase, that he had just come
down from Reclamation Station, in So
noma County, and while there had bagged
sixty-nine ducks of different species.
The following letter speaks for Itself:
SUISUN, Cal., Jan. 26, 1898.
Sporting Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
Splendid shooting can be had here at present.
Plenty of birds are in sight, and nice ones at
that. Mr. Sheldon, a San Francisco huntsman,
got twenty-eight fine blr<Js here the other day
in a short time. A Mr. Myers bagged eighteen
tine teals.
During the -week a party consisting of
Messrs. James Keyes of Suisun, Grant Chad
bourne, Lew Percy and Ed Hilborn went
down to the mouth of the Suisun Slough and
got 200 fine specimens. Including teals, mal
lards and widgeons. Tom Robinson, an under
sheriff, came home with forty birds.
Harry Corbett and a friend got 200 birds herÂ«
Sunday. "Bogey" O'Donnell and six friends
announce their intention of taking a gunning
trip to Printrle's Pond, about one and a half
miles from Suisun. This pond has recently
been thrown open to hunters, and good sport
will doubtless be had there.
Last Sunday Charley Getchell and myself
did the best shooting of anybody. We got
sixty-seven nice ducks in no time. Bill Bryan
managed to bag eighteen fine teals and sprigs.
My yacht has been in constant requisition for
some time now and business In the gunning
line ia simply booming. Respectfully,
E. J. BELL.
Anglers In Russian River have been
reaping a harvest since the bar was
opened, but no catches made by any par
ticular persons are as yet reported. Un
lawful net fishing in certain localities la
said to be still on the tapis.
Next Saturday, February 5, being
the first Saturday in the month, the
North Pacific Coast Railroad will
dispatch a hunters' and anglers'
train for Point Reyes. Bay View,
Marshalls and Tomalcs, leaving via the
11:30 p. m. Sausalito ferry. The bulk of
travel by these special trains in the past
has been to Point Reyes, and even that
has fallen below expectations. While it
was thought that hunters would be glad
to get into the territory between Point
Reyes and Tomales. experience has de
veloped the fact that hunters do not ap
preciate the service, and unless a larger
number turn out next Saturday night it
will be the last midnight special for
sportsmen this season. The company
runs these sportsmen's trains irrespec
tive of the weather, and whether there
is one passenger or fifty.
If steelhead fishing In the Russian
River continues good next week the
North Pacific Coast Railroad, will run a
special train through to Duncans Mills
next Saturday night, leaving via the 11:30
o clock Sausalito ferry.
Pocketed the Money.
William Blakeley, a bartender, was
arrested last night by Detectives Ryan
and ODea and charged with embezzle
ment. Several days ago, it is claimed,
he received $20 from Laura Locks to bet
on a racehorse, which was selling at odds
of 8 to L The horse won and the woman
claims that Blakeley pocketed theamount
which was coming to her.

Bills Are Paid.
i
Governor Budd Requests the
Bank to Submit a State
ment.
FOR FUTURE SAFEGUARDS
Hereafter All Checks Must Be Coun
tersigned by One Member of the
Finance Committee.
A special meeting of the Board of â 
Tosemite Valley Commissioners was
held yesterday afternoon at 310 Pine
street to consider the accounts of John
P. Sheehan, the former secretary ana
treasurer of the board. Governor Budd,
president of the commission, presided
at the session. Commissioners Clinch, j
Givens, Goldberg, Foote and Kinney |
were present.
W. W. Foote, addressing the chair, ;
made a statement concerning the con
dition of the books when the new sec
retary. Mr. Lermen, received the docu
ments. Reference was made to the
number of claims marked paid which
"were not liquidated at the time the en
tries of payment were made on the
books. In the course of his remarks
Mr. Foote said:
"Mr. Shechan has refused to sur
render his bank book showing the
checks drawn en account of the Yosem
ite Commission. We have no means of
ascertainir.gr how many bills are un
paid and huw many are paid. My
judgment is that it is his duty to come
here and explain everything. He is
treating the commission in a degree of
insolence that ought not to be toler
ated."
A. H. Washburne of the Yosemlte |
Stage Company was asked if his bill j
had been paid, and he replied in the j
affirmative, stating that the checks
were received last Saturday. The
statement was made that Breyfogle's
bill had been paid since the last meet
ing of the committee that investigated
Ger.eral Sheehan's accounts.
At the suggestion of Commissioner
Clinch the secretary read the following
letter from General Sheehan:
-AN FRANCISCO. Jan. IS, IS9S.
To the Commissioners to Manage Yosemite ;
Valley an,l Marfposa Big Tree Grove:
Gentlemenâ l beg to submit. In the first place,
that no shortage exists In the fund placed In
my charge with which to pay claims against
the Yosemw Commission, every claim of which
I have any knowledge or which the books Â«nd
State voucfc-rs show, having been paid either
.n cash Or by my check, the latter method j
boing Â£en< rally used owing to the fact that
nearly all claimants reside at a distance frctu
this office, jjvery claim not represented by a
voucher < - canceled check Is accounted for
by money in bank to cash outstanding checks, ,
? which I am at any time prepared to shov.-.
r which I am at any time on account of lent?,
All moneys paid to me on account of lent?.
â  etc., have been duly forwarded to the htate
Treasurer, as the monthly releases from ihe
State Controller on file In your office clearly
indicate.
The books show all receipts and expenditures
an', these are written up. Any expert can In
a short time ascertain whether I am right or ;
â wrong In the foregoing statements.
The secretary's bank account has no place ;
In this matter of rtlng. The law provide:*
no method by which the secretary and treas
urer shall pay out the moneys to claimant. â 
Sometimes he pays in cash, at other times by !
check or Wells. Fargo & Co., as may be con
venient. If he has checked out all the moneys j
to claimant? he must get the canceled checks
back, as they are his only vouchers. ESaeb
check, when returned, is his receipt chit he
has paid claim account of Yosemite voucher
!.The books and accounts of thY Yosemite
Thp books and accounts of thÂ« Tosemite
Commission have been, many times, experted,
and during my term of office as well, and
there has never before been a demand that the
secretary turn over to his successor moneys In
bank against which he had issued checks, and
over which moneys he had no further control.
For two months past I have hardly been able I
to do any work, clerical or otherwise, but I
will cheerfully explain to my successor what I
know about the books, papers and affairs of
the . V Bemite Commission. Very respectfully,
JOHN P. SHEEHAN.
Commissioner Foot* insisted that the I
letter from Mr. Sheehaa was a false- I
hood. The Commissioner submitted a
list containing eighty-two items al
lowed by the board of which there was
no record of payment. The aggregate
of the list approximates $6000. The
Commissioner remarked: "The claims j
may have been paid since we institut- j
ed the investigation. Perhaps Sheehan
obtained the money from his rich and
influential relatives."
Commissioner Goldberg said the com- !
mission was entitled to a full state- |
ment from the bank of all the transac- j
tlons connected- with the commission.
Governor Budd therefore dictated
and signed the following notice to the
bank:
SAX FRANCISCO, Jan. 23, 1898.
To the Columbian Banking Company, San ;
Francisco, Cal.:
You are hereby notified that all checks,
japers, books and accounts In the possession \
of your bank to the credit of the Yosemlte i
Commissioners, or the secretary or treasurer of I
paid Yosemlte Commission, no matter by what I
name such secretary or treasurer may bo
known, is the property of the Board of Com
missioners to Manage the Yosemite Valley and
' Marlposa Blir Tree Grove, and you are re
quested to deliver the same to J. J. Lermen.
the present secretary and treasurer of such
commission. You are alao r<.'^ue.Tt?d to de
liver to him especially all checks tor money
paid on the order of thin commission, or of
â¢ any secretary or treasurer hereof, to any per- ,
son whomsoever.
You are further requested to make a state
ment of the account of this commission, its
secretary or treasurer, with your bank Iran
January 1, Ih'.i6. to the present time.
A resolution was adopted directing
the finance committee of the commis
sion â (livens. Kinney and Clinch â !
make an examination of the accounts
and obtain from the State Controller a
statement of all moneys received on
account of leases and privileges. The ;
resolution authorizes the committee to \
employ an expert.
I Governor Budd made the explanation j
that .some bills back in 1595 had not I
been paid because one year the sum of
$11,000 was expended when only an ex- j
penditure of $3500 was authorized. The
money was expended for repairs, but '
none of the transactions, took place ;
â¢luring the administration of General j
Sheehan. His predecessor in office kept
the books then.
At the suggestion of Commissioner i
CMvens the rule was adopted that here- j
after all checks drawn by the secre
tary on account of the commission !
must be countersigned by one member j
of' the finance committee. All the
money received from the State la to be
deposited to the credit of the commis
sion. The Governor instructed the sec
tary to keep ledger accounts of all
Moneys received and disbursed.
. * Commissioner Kinney called up the
.. â¢ matter of the lease .to Coffman &
Kinne, but the board decided to defer
consideration of the subject until Feb
ruary 3. The Commissioner Intimated j
that the holders of the lease had been
collecting more money than they were
entitled to receive.
Commissioner Foote insisted that
General Sheehan should be requested
to attend the meeting next Thursday.
The Governor replied: "I will ap
point Commissioner Foote a committee
of one to bring General Sheehan here
at that time."
Mr. Foote declined to serve.
TO RESTRAIN CLUNIE.
Foreign Insurance Companies Ask
to Have tbe Act of 1885 De
clared Null and Void.
United States Marshal Baldwin yester
day made his return of service of sum
mons on Insurance Commissioner An
drew J. Clunle in a suit brought by
thirty-four foreign fire insurance com
panies. The complaint recites that the
companies have each paid the $20 fee for
certificates as required by law. whlcn
certificates authorize the companies to
do business In this State. Tt sots up that
the act of tho Legislature of ]SSS requir
ing the payment of 1 per cent of all
premiums each year to counties and
Cities and counties by fire insurance com
panies not organized under the laws of
California, but doing business therein,
and providing for the disposition of such
premiums, la In violation of the constitu
tion of the State of California. Tt is also
alleged that none of the complainants
have paid any of the percentages requir
ed by the act. and if the act w.-rÂ»Â» valid
there would be now due and payable from
them the sum of $278,000.
The complaint asks that the act of 18ST.
be declared null and void, and that the
Insurance Commissioner be enjoined and
restrained from proceeding against the
complainants.
T. C. Coogan, Wilson & Wilson, John
Garber and W. S. Goodfellow are coun
sel for the companies.
OSBORN IS ONCE
MORE IN CHARGE
The Pound Again in the Hands
of the Munici
pality.
Control Taken From the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelly to
Animals.
The Health and Folico Cnmmittpp of
the Board of Supervisors resumed its
inquiry into the management of the pub
lic pound yesterday, and after due delib
eration decided to recommend that the
management of the institution be taken
out of the hands of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
that Fred A. Osborn. poundmastrr under
the old regime, be returned to his posi
tion.
The action of the committee is based on
a large number of complaints that have
been received regarding the treatment of
animals that have been impounded dur
ing the last few weeks.
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in
discussing the action of the committee of
the Supervisors recommending his re
moval as poundkeeper, said:
"This whole matter is due to my re
fusal to recognize orders from members
of the board to release impounded ani
mals without the payment of fees. Ever
since my appointment, sixty days ago,
they have been trying to trump up some
excuse for removing me. As a matter
of fact they do not want the society to
have charge of the pound, and I have
been told by several people, among them
one Supervisor, that my removal as
poundkeeper was only a question of time.
"Since I have been in charge 1 have
received numerous orders from members
of the board for the release of animals,
but have invariably refused to recognize
them, until last week, when the society
met and passed a resolution instructing
me to release animals on orders from
Supervisors and to charge the fee to the
society, bo the city would not sustain
financial loss.
"To show how absurd is the cnarge
that we are not properly performing our
work, I will state that last month we Im
pounded 1105 dogs â more than double tne
number ever impounded before in a sin
gle month. Then. too. the assertion that
the pound is unfit to keep an animal in
is just as ridiculous. I keep one man now
who does nothing but keep the place
clean, and the animals are well cared
for. As I said before, the committee is
simply fishing for an excuse to take the
pound out of the society's hands."
CHARTER-MAKERS
MEET AGAIN
The Matter of Public Utilities |
Under Considera
tion.
Important Provisions Adopted Con
cerning the Granting of
Franchises.
The Board of Freeholders elected to
frame a new charter for the city met
again yesterday afternoon and spent con
siderable time in discussing the manner in
which street railroad franchises may be
awarded in tho event of the charter being
adopted. Tt was finally decided to limit
all franchises to twenty-five years and to
award them to the highest bidder who,
in addition to his bid. guaranteed to the
city 3 per cent of the gross receipts of the
first five years. 4 per cent for the next ten
years and 5 per cent for the last ten
years. The sum thus obtained will be for
the Street Department.
It was also decided to have the Super
visors advertise annually for all goods
and materials required for the city's use;
the contracts to be let to the lowest bid
der. In the event of some article not ad
vertised for in the original bids being
afterward needed the Supervisors will be
required to award the contract for fur
nishing it by a system of competitive
bidding.
A section introduced by Dr. An
derson empowering the Supervisors to set
aside (25,000 to be used in sinking artesian
wells to supply the public buildings with
water was referred to the legislative com
mittee for consideration.
Another provision, introduced by A. W.
Thompson, providing that the eighteen
Supervisors to be elected under the char
ter be elected In the odd numbered years
was referred to the same eommlttee.
On motion of P. H. McCarthy, it was
decided to incorporate a section in the
charter providing that the letting of
franchises for heat, power, light, tele
phonic and telegraphic service be award
ed to the highest bidder, In the same
manner as rallroau franchises.

DONE WITH
WELBURN
Grand Jury at Work
Upon Another In
dictment.
It Will Contain at Least
Three New Charges
of Malfeasance.
None of the Old Matter Will
Be Used in the Pro
ceedings.
BUT WHERE IS THE MAN?
| Only a Faint Clew to the Where
abouts of the Ex-Revenue
Collector.
Notwithstanding the silence of the
United States Grand Jury it has been
an open secret that the Government
has not dropped the prosecution of ex-
Internal Revenue Collector Osca If.
Welburn. The acquittal of Mr. WM
! burn on an indictment containing
; forty-three distinct and separate
charges of embezzlement was a severe
disappointment to the prosecution, for
the case had been well prepared and
ably presented to the Jury by the
United States Attorney's office. Im-
FASTEST VESSEL ON THE PACIFIC COAST.
That Is What It Is Claimed the California Navigation Company's
Arrow Will Be,
She Will Run Out of Stockton in Connection With the Valley Road,
"The fastest vessel on the Pacific Coast," is what Hugh Corhrane, superintendent of the California Naviga
tion and Improvement Company, says its new boat for the Stockton route will be. She is to have a guaranteed
speed of twenty-two knots an hour, and will make the run from Stockton to San Francisco in five hours. She is
to run in connection with the San Joaquia Valley Railroad, and will carry nothing but passengers and through
freight. The only stopping place on the river will be at Antioch, and there the delay will only be a few minutes.
Owing to the number of turns in the river for the first ten miles out of Stockton, the steamer will only go at half
speed, but from that time on she will be rushed to San Francisco under full steam.
The new boat is to be called the Arrow. She will be something like the T. C. Walker and J. D. Peters, but
will have less beam and will be a feu fftâ t shorter. Amidships and on the saloon deck there will be a large <-nace
Inclosed with glass. This will be luxuriously fitted up as a social hall, and in it passengers can sit or lounge and
get a view of the magnificent scenery through which the boat passes on her way up and own the river. State
rooms will be provided for about 300 passengers, and the Steamer will be lighted throughout by electricity. She
will be fitted with the latest device in steam steering gear, and will have every appliance on board that will tend to
the safety and comfort of the passengers. It is expected that the Arrow will make two trips a day. Leaving San
Francisco In the morning, she will reach Btockton early in the afternoon, and three or four hours later will start
back for San Francisco and be ready for the return trip the following morning. Owing to the great speed of the
boat, there will be no difficulty in h?r making the round trip each day.
The only vessels on the coast that will be able to approach the Arrow in speed are the Portland River boats.
They average twenty knots an hour, but the new boat will be their equal in luxurious fitting up and their superior
in speed. The engines for the Arrow are being built by the Pulton Imn Works and the hull is being constructed by
the California Navigation and Improvement Company. The vessel will be launched the latter part of next month
and will be ready for her trial trip early in M,-iy.
mediately after the acquittal Special
Revenue Agent Thrasher began gath
ering testimony for a second indict
ment on new charges, it being deemed
unwise to bring up any of the counts
on which Welburn had been acquitted
because his counsel could plead once
in jeopardy. Miss Cornell, who work
sd for a while in YVelburn's office, and
Miss Nellie O'Brien were examined be
fore the Grand Jury several weeks
ago and they told about their having
Signed vouchers for certain amounts
when they received lesser Bums from
Welburn.
Several other witnesses were exam
ined a? to similar transactions, and af
t. r aU the testimony had been gath
ered there was. and it still continues, ;i
long period of dolay. Week after week
passed by and no report came from the
Jury. Then it leaked out that there
was a hitch, and that It had been
caused by a disagreement between
Special Agent Thrasher and the United
States Attorney's office as to the man
ner or matter of the Indictment to be
submitted to the jury. The matter
was kept very secret, and both the
special agent and the United State,
Attorney's office declined to be inter
viewed on the subject.
It became known yrwterday. how
ever, that an agreement had been
reached by all the elements of the pros
ecution and that the Indictment would
be presented to the Jury next Tuesday
at the regular meeting, and that It
would be acted upon favorably to the
Government in aU probability. Where
Welburn is remains unknown to the
prosecution. Tlvre is no doubt in their
minds that he is purposely keeping out
of the way and concealing his present
place of abode. About a week ago the
authorities learned that a letter had
been received in the city by a friend
of the ex-Collector, the letter being
dated on December 29, and postmarked
January 10. Tt had been mailed at
Welburn'S old home in Amarillo,
Texas.

ttfl&ay afternoon to make arrangements

CORTLAND-AVENUE CLUB.
A New Organization Formed at the
Base of Bernal heights.
The residents and property-owners on
Cortland avenue and Folsom street
have organized an improvement club for
that section of the Bernal Heights dis
trict.
The formation of this club. Judging
from the exigency of the many wants of
the families residing there, is a neces
sity, as up to the present time little or
no improvements have been mart.' tor
that portion of the city. The Spring
Valley Water Company, although the
Cortlaad reservoir is within a stum's
throw of the resident section, has failed
to run a serviceable main to any por
tion of the s.-ttlement. As a conse
quence the people are virtually without
a supply of fresh water. The families
must depend on pumps to furnish thÂ«Mr
houses with the necessary drinking
fluid.
Another source of inconvenience felt ;
by the people is the difficulty in getting
to and from the city, or to the Mission
proper. One mile must be traveled to
reach the Mission street line, while the
Folsom street line at Precita avenue is
only three blocks distant, but It might
as well be three miles so far as they are
concerned, as the street is not cut
through. It is one of the additional ob
jects the club has in view, to have the
street cars continue from Ripley street
to Crescent avenue,
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors was generous enough to
pay the district an official visit laM
wii-k and on the representations made
to it by the executive committee of the
club, the City and County Surveyor was
Instructed to make a survey of the
ground and also form an estimate of the
probable expense of grading and paving
the three blocks.
Taking advantage of the presence of
the city's representatives in the section
the executive committee did not n< fleet
to have the need of some protection
against tire pointed out. It was shown
that the nearest engine and hoso cart
to the pine are located at Twenty
[ sixth and Valencia streets, fully two
miles distant. This condition Is equal
to do protection at all, as in ease of i
fire there is no possibility of extinguish
ing it until it consumes what it attacks.
The meeting Wednesday was well at
tended. There were over m property
owners present besides others who live
in tho neighborhood and they all
evinced a lively Interest In the meeting.

proposed meeting and exchanged cam
paisrn reminiscences.
Chairman Alford, Gould. Caminrtti
and Markley expressed the opinion
that the committee would not enter
tain any resolutions relating to the
annexation of Hawaii, and it was
thought to be doubtful whether any
one would offer to Introduce the sub
ject. J<ihn Markley ooserved that it
had never been the policy of the com
mittee to adopt resolutions asserting
the principles of the party. He fan
cied that questions of party declara
tion on public affairs could safely be
left to the judgment of the State con
vention. Messrs. Alford. Gould and
Caminetti expressed similar views.
A caucus oi the leaders of the
party whs held yesterday afternoon
and various subjects were discussed.
In regard to annexation the fact was
cited that the party as represented in
Congreaa was against the measure,
and that a Democratic national ad
ministration had taken strong grounds
against the policy of annexing the
islands.
In view, therefore, of the known posi
tion of the party un the subject it was
determined that it would be unwise
to entertain a resolution on the subject
in the State Committee. The chair
man. Mr. Alford, announced that if
such resolution were offered he would
at once rule it out of order.
In regard to the delinquent list and
the proposition to dmp a large number
of the eommittofmen who had not paid
their assessments, it was the judgment
of the caucus that harsh measures
should not be enforced. Members of
the committee on the delinquent list
who were loyal and active workers |
during the last campaign will doubt
less .be reinstated. Others who were
indifferent to party success and neg
lected the interests of the party will
be dropped.
It is known to members of the State
Committee that E. L. Fitzgerald, who
draws down a salary as Labor Com
missioner of California, hut whose real
business is that of lobbyist in the in
terest of Hawaiian annexation, ha.s
been buzzing about for several weeks
to get members of the committee to
vote for a resolution instructing United
States Senator White to support an
nexation. Mr. Fitzgerald was at the
California Hotel last evening, bat had
nothing to say in favor of his pet
measure. He found early in the day
yesterday that the mission in which he
had engaged was not popular with
members of the committee.
It was obvious to the Labor Commis
sioner yesterday that his influence in
the party was very slipht since he could
not get a member of the committee
to present a resolution which lie has
been carrying around for the last
fortnight. When the committee ad
journs to-day he may deem it wise to
return to the office of Labor Commis
sioner and see whether he cannot find
something there in the line of official
duty to engage his time and energies.
Measured by ordinary standard^ >?Â«Â» is
a flat failure as a lobbyist for annexa
tion, but measured by his lack of use
fulness as a Labor Commissioner some
distinction may apply to him as a lob
byist.
In an interview published at twilight
Fitzgerald spoke of having had proxies
tendered to him for use in the commit
tee meeting to-day. It was said by
leading Democrats last night that one
of the first rules to be established to
day would be one limiting the use of
proxies to members of the State Com
mittee. The Labor Commissioner is
not a member of the State Commit
tee.
The chances are that the committee
to-day will not consider the place or
time for holding the next State conven
tion of the party. Sacramento is mak
ing a vigorous effort to secure the prize,
and a committee of interested citizens
from the capital caucused at the Pal
ace Hotel last night on the subject.
Pressure may be brought to bear to
persuade members of the committee to
take up the matter at this meeting. It
was mentioned in the general talk of
committeemen at the California Hotel
last night that a half-way promise
was made four years ago, when Sacra
mento was chosen as the meeting place,
that Los Angeles should have the next
turn.
The new primary election law will
engage the attention of the committee
In the session to-day. Steps may be
taken to authorize counsel to represent
the party in court. The indications
are that the party will hold an early
convention this year.
LABOR'S WANTS
IN THE CHARTER
Resolutions to Be Presented
to the New Free
holders.
The Labor Council Holds Its Semi-
Ann ual Election of
Officers*.
Organized labor wants a new charter
for the city and county of San Fran
cisco, and is determined to use every
possible method to get not only a new
charter, but one in which the working
man will receive a fair recognition.
The labor council a few weeks ago ap
pointed a committee to draft a set of
resolutions for presentation to the new
Board of Freeholders, and last night
the committee reported as follows:
The committee on charter recommended that
the following features are especially desirable
In framing the chatter:
1. Maximum hour* and minimum wages on all
public work!", as adopted by the charter con
vention, to which be added: The minimum
wages of skilled labor, the latter term to mean
members of trades unions, to be the ruling
trades union rate.
2 All public work to be done by the city and
county, and the abolition of the contract sys
3. Public ownership of public utilities, street
cars, gas, electric lights, water, etc., existing
utilities to be acquired by the city and county
upon the expiration of their franchises or con
tracts.
4. Initiative and referendum upon any or
all ordinances u:>on petition of 10 per cent of
the votes cast at the last preceding election.
5 Power of submitting amendments to the
charter on petition of 15 per cent of the votes
cast at the last general election.
6. Free books for pupils of public schools.
7. All public officers at present elective to
remain so. A Board of Supervisor* large
i enough to permit of the selection of alt public
commissions from Its members.
S. We would also recommend that the elec
tion commissioners be requested to submit the
charter to the people at a general election, so
as to give every citizen an untrammeled oppor
tunity to cast his vote. .';V ". :-
If these clauses are inserted in the new
charter, particularly those referring to
the initiative and referendum and the
control of public utilities, it will receive
tht> unanimous support of the trades
unions affiliated with the Labor Council,
while if they are not recognized all the
forces of organized labor will combine to
defeat the new document.
Thr regular semi-annual election of of
ficers was held last night, resulting as
follows: President, J. HiH; vice-presi
dent. M. Davis: recording and corre
sponding 'secretary. Ed Rosenberg: finan
cial secretary, J. Walter: treasurer. J.

The Musicians' Union reported that the
Lybeck Cycle Skating Rink, located on
Howard street, wa? employing a non
union band, and that the proprietor had
refused to change to union musicians on
the ground that the non-union men were
cheaper anil he did not think a change
would materially affect his v receipts. The
matter was placed in the" hands of the
executive committee, and the attention
of all affiliated unions will be called to
the matter.
Girl Graduates' Concert.
A very successful concert was given by
the class of '98 of the Sacred Heart Pre
sentation Convent last evening. The girl
graduates, with the assistance of several
young members of the Order of the Holy
Cross, rendered the second act of "Oli
vette." Miss M. Cavanaugh as Olivette
and Miss M. B. Mulcare as the Countess,
being especially good. The girls were
assisted by F. Michaelena. J. Marquardt,
Mrs. J. Sexton Hutton, Mrs. L. Walsh,
Mr>. G. R. Cole and Jacob Mueller. Mrs.
J. Sexton Hutton, wife of H. W. Hutton,
the lawyer, who was for several years a
very popular operatic singer known as
Inez Sexton, was the favorite of the
evening. She opened the concert with
Mascagnl's "Avc Maria," and was three
times encored.
The concert was under the manage
ment of Mine. Inez Fabbri Mueller.
Sergeant Shea Maizes a Raid.
Sergeant Shea and his posse made an
other raid on the Chinese clubs last
â¦â veiling, and succeeded in capturing
about fifty gamblers. Two clubs wore

FROM HIM
Swiftwater Bill's Wife
Refused to Live
With Him.
Says Her Husband Loved
Sister Better Than
Herself.
The Painful Story of an Alaskan
Miner and Two San Fran
cisco Women.
WIFE NOT EMPTY-HANDED
Has Valuable Mining Property in tho
North and $10,000 Worth
of Stock.
After braving the rigors of an Arctic
winter and successfully navigating the
swift swirling waters of the fearful
White Horse rapids, Swiftwater Bill,
King of the Klondike by the grace of
luck, husband through the kindness of
Miss Gracie Bush, otherwise known as
Miss Gracie La Moore, prospective de
fendant in a divorce case through the
frailty of human nature, and philoso
pher by his own statements, has come
to grief in the gently running waters of
matrimony.
The story of Mr. Rapid Water, whose
Christian name is William C. Gates
has already been published in the daily
papers ad nauseam. First he became
celebrated as the owner of untold mil
lions of gold that lay hidden in his
claims along the banks of the Bonanza.
Secondly he jumped into fame as the
man who offered Miss Gussie La Moore,
the actress, a coal-oil can containing
fifty thousand dollars' worth of gold
dust to marry him. Thirdly he was
made the subject of newspaper con
gratulations upon the refusal of the
aforesaid lady to share his lot. Fourth
ly he sprung into prominence again by
marrying Gracie, the sister of his first
love, after a week's acquaintance, and
now he reaches the climax of his me
teor-like career by falling in love, hia
wife claims, with still another branch
of the same bush, by name Nelly, who
resides at the family manshion on
Bryant street; and being in a fair way
to become the defendant in the divorce
proceedings that his irate spouse has re
tained Attorney Henry E. Monroe to
institute.
For a week past rumors and counter
rumors have been floating around the
corridors of the Baldwin Hotel con
cerning the marital difficulties in the
Gates family. These rumors were per
sistently denied by all the parties con
cerned in the matter until last Wednes
day night, when Mrs. Gates, after a
stormy scene in her apartments, pack
ed up her clothes and left, vowing that
she would continue no longer as the
obedient wife of a man who loved her
sister better than herself. She went
down and took her abode at her moth
er's home, on Bryant street, refusing
all overtures of a conciliatory nature
from the abandoned Bill, and yester
day she visited her attorney, with the
result already set forth.
Mr. Bill was seen last evening in his
apartments at the Baldwin, and inter
viewed concerning his trouble.
"Yes," said Gate 3, "1 guess you are
right â  about there being some trouble
between Gracie and myself. She has
gone down to a lawyer fellow and re
tained him to do something or other,
but what, I don't know. May be she's
going to try to get a divorce, but in di
vorce suits they have to serve some
kind of papers or other, don't they?
Well. I haven't had any papers of any
kind, yet. What was the trouble? Well.
Gracie never said right out and out
what she was kicking at, but," with a
self-satisfleS smile, ''she was Jealous
of her sister Nellie. You see, I used
to josh her considerable, so last
Wedneday night she got up and
waltzed out of this room, and she ain't
been back since."
"Have you seen her since?"
"Lord, yes. I was with her all to
night. Where? Oh, I met her by ap
pointment in the office of my attorneys,
Reddy, Campbell & Metson, and we
had an interview for about an hour."
"Was it a pleasant one, Mr. Gates?"
"Well, I don't know what you call
pleasant, but we passed about an hour
and she hugged me all the time.so I
guess that wasn't so bad, was it?"
"Did you come to any agreement?"
"None In particular, excepting Gracis
told me to wait a week and see if I
loved her or not before doing anything.
so I guess may be I will. She can in
stitute all the divorce proceedings or
any other game she wants. I don't
know whether I'll fight it or not until
I find out what she wants a divorce
for. if she wants it at all. But if I do
fisjht- it I can beat her at every turn
of the road on any sort of a proposi
"Well, are there any property con
siderations Hkely to come up? Have
you made anything over to your wife,
Mr. Gates?"
"Yes, I have given her about $10,000
in Alaskan property and about $10,000
worth of stock in my company. Oh,
I always treated her well!"
"Don't you rather regret your some
what unusual experiences with San
Francisco femininity?"
"No, I don't regret a thing. I have
got nothing to regret, noway." which
pleasant statement, accompanied by a
charming smile which shone through
the clouds of tobacco like the rising
sun in a fog, concluded the interview.
As the visitor left the room he heard
a somewhat coarse voice follow him
down the hall, which said. "Say. young
fellow, if you want my picture I'll give
you an order on a photographer where
they are having some taken, which
they say will be fine."
The rnarriape took place about a
month ago, shortly after Swiftwater's
return from Alaska.

Fold large blocks of stock which have been
recent speculative favorites without producing
any marked declines elsewhere in the list.
Northern Pacific preferred shows a net gain
for to-day. Viut the declines in the others were
r.ct sufficient to uncover any large number of
utop-loss order?. The sharp gains In special
storks at different times during the day were
evidently due to manipulation for the purpose
of sustaining the general market. This, to
gether with the higher range of prices report
ed from London this morning kept stocks well
above last night? level during the early part
of the day. btft the closing showed an easy
tone, with prices generally at the lowest. New
York Central was conspicuous under realizing
pressure after the opening and closed V 6 lower
than the day's high point. Kansas and Texas
preferred showed an extreme decline of 1%
and Rock Island of a full per cent. Heaviness
of the Granger group was another factor in the
decline. London was a heavy seller, espe
cially fif New York Central. This added to
the heavy tone to quite a marked extent. Still
another factor on the side of the reactionists
was the weakness in the unthraeite group, de
clines in some of Us members reaching a
point. The local New York group added the
weight of its weakness to the burden of the
bulls. The sudden spurts of strength shown by
Northwest, LoutevtlM, Denver preferred and a
few other stocks proved unavailing to coun
teract the general low tendency. Exchange

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Jan. 28â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram rays: The stock
markets here were irregular to-day. Amer
icans and Argentines were buoyant, but other
securities were Idle to dull. There was more
general dealing here in Americans than since
the rise began. At the same time, as a na
tural result, the buying was somewhat ragged.
Much of President McKinley's speech in New
York last night was cabled here and the mar
ket did not construe It favorably, fur
ther aiding the upward rush in price. A set
back for a short time was followed finally by
a rally to near the best. There has been a
sharp rise In rupee paper on reports that the
gold standard in India was imminent. The
best informed disregard these reports and the
soundest rnono-metanists doubt the wisdom of
such a thing at present. A further Jump in
Rank of England stock to record price looks
significant and as though the bank meant to
pursue the policy of being an active agent in
the money movement. More Japanese money
was released to-day, and a small amount of
gold was withdrawn from the bank for ship
ment to New York. This Is regarded as an
exceptional transaction, without much sig
nificance.
CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 28.â 1t looked at the opening I
in Wheat as If the long-looked-for reaction
was about to take place. For the first time In ]
two weeks news really favored the bears, and
a decline In prices at once ensued. May.
which closed yesterday at Â»7%@9BUc, opened
to-day at 96Â»,i@>98%c, and July, In which op
tion, however, there was not much trading,
opened %@lc lower at 86S'86Vic. There was
plenty of selling at those figures by heavy
holders, and May was down to 86c and July to
85% c before any support of consequence ma
terialized. Traders were somewhat strength
ened by the weakness at Liverpool. That mar
ket opened lUd higher, but a large slice
of this advance had been lost when 1:30 p. m." I
cables came in. This weakness was explained
by the Argentine shipments for the week. 864.
000 bushels. This was < more than twice as â¢
much as during the previous week. Northwest
receipts were liberal. The decline lasted about
half an hour, when a covering movement re
sulted in an advance In May to 97c, when
another spell of unloading carried the price
back to 96'-4C. It gradually recovered to 96% c.
At midday it began â¢ to develop some of the
bull snap of yesterday, when the Antwerp
market showed an advance equal to 2V4c per
. bushel for American red and lV for Walla
Walla. Paris was also higher by about \c.
Atlantic exports were heavy, amounting to
790,000 bushels. Bids for May brought few re
sponses and prices slowly climbed until one
of the Letter brokers commenced bidding for
January in an attempt to buy up 60,000 bushels.
He succeeded in getting but 20,000 bushels
of this amount, the ' price In the meantime
jumping with its usual rapidity to $1 10, the
highest point yet reached for this season's
crop. May soared to 98% aAt the top prices
Immense quantities were offered, which the
crowd took eagerly for a time, but about ten
minutes from the close the market broke un
der the pressure. May closed at &7VÂ»c, Janu
ary at $1 08. "

when the latter showed its midday bullishness.

LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON, Jan. There wu the usual
large attendance at the wool auction sales to
day. The offerings aggregated 14.457 bales. In
cluding choice Victoria greasy, which were
keenly competed for by the home trade and j
American buyers. The latter buyers pur- I
chased 350 bales, but sometimes they could
not reach the sellers' limits. Good Australian
merinos easily realized late rates. New South
Wales wool was especially high. Scoured was ,
strongly competed for, the continent paying 2
shillings for choice New South Wales stock.
A small lot of Cape of Good Hope and Natal :
wool was offered and sold at unchanged
prices. The offerings of the latter were chiefly

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
, NEW YORK, Jan. 28.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
I Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
! The first month of the new year has brought
j rather more Increase In business, but less im
j provement In prices than was expected. With
payments through clearing houses 7.3 per cent
'â  larger than In I<<92. and probably the largest
ever known In any month, with railroad earn
i ings 11.2 per cent larger than the best of past
years, the fact that prices are very low only
shows, more clearly the increase in quantities
I of products sold. . Nor Is there any disposition
! to refuse orders, even at present prices, in
! deed, the â¢ competition of manufacturers seek
| Ing orders alone prevents a rise. Most of them
; have all they can manage, many working night
! and day, one . great steel concern running on
j Sunday, but the works not yet filled with
I orders are seeking contracts at as low prices
as have ever been made.
The, settlement of wages on a 10 cent ad
1 vance April 1 for 200,000 coal miners of the cen-
I tral region, with ' other changes, will tend
i toward a larger demand' for products' of all
kinds. - though also toward some increase in
cost of manufacture. . â¢
Wheat has been conspicuous, rising 5 cents
for the week, with 5%c for May options. West
ern receipts have been 10.C03.053 bushels In four
weeks, against 6,045.711 last year, but Atlantic
exports have, been 12,003,128 bushels.. In four
weeks, against 7,013,704 last year, and Pacific
exports, with Tacoma. for â  the week. 4.015.584
bushel?, against 3.4.M.995 last year.
The cotton manufacture Is in more difficulty
than any other, not merely because prices do
not show much Improvement nor as yet the
demand for roods, although both are helped
by the closing of many mills, but largely be
cause the manufacturers and workers have,
considered too little the rapidly growing pro
duction at the South.
The woolen manufacture Is doing well, fine
worsted goods having opened at an advance of
20 per cent over last year, and the large mills
are constantly buying wool, even at current
high prices, which implies great confidence in
the future, presumably based on larger orders
than are publicly reported. Such purchases of
wool have been frequent of late, even by mills
supposed to lie supplied far ahead, and one
Providence mill appears to have taken 260.000
pounds of worsted wool at Wheeling this week.
Sales at three of the chief markets have been
5.050.100 pounds, and for four weeks 30.421.
of which 21,367.720 were domestic, against 38.
547.600 last year, of which 23.397,300 were do
mestic
The iron manufacture Is getting larger or
ders for finished products, which crowd many
works almost beyond their capacity; although
some others are still In the market and keeping
prices down. Pigiron Is steady, except that
Bessemer at Pittsburg is 10 cents lower.
Failures for the week have been 342 in the
United States, against 331 last year, and 34 In
Canada, against 57 last year.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Jan. 23.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: Favorable conditions In the
trade situation continue to far outweigh those
of an opposite character. Stormy weather
throughout a large section of the country this
week has checked the movement of merchan
dise In consumption, but the perceptible In
crease In the demand for seasonable goods Is
reported as already resulting. The last week
of the month closes with increased activity In
many lines, a number of price advances, heav
ily Increased bank clearings, as oompared with
one year ago, at nearly all cities, another con
siderable drop in the number of failures re
ported, large exports of cereals, particularly
wheat, com and flour, and perceptible confi
dence In nearly all branches of trade as re
gards the outlook for spring business. An
other favorable feature of the week Is the
slight but distinct improvement In the cotton
goods situation, in which speculative activity
Is awakening. Print cloths are higher and
some makes of gray and medium weight cot
tons are more firmly held.
Plgtron Is reflecting the effect of present un
precedented production, and a further weak
ening in prices Is recorded at Eastern points.
At the West, however, consumption of pig and
finished products of iron and steel is reported
production. and a further weak
ceH Is recorded at Eastern points.
. however, consumption of pig and
iucts of iron and steel is reported
Increasing so as to hold prices firm. Large
sales of bar neel and rails are reported at
Chicago and St. Louis, with mills refusing to
take orders for delivery earlier than late sum
mer. Boots and shoes hold the late advance
and manufacturers of heavy weights will not
take orders for fall delivery at present prices.
Wool Is strong on large sales and firm prices
abroad. Prims. of most staple products are
higher on the week. Notable instances are those
of wheat, which is past the dollar mark again
at many Western markets. The active demand
for the Klondike trade is reflected In canned
goods, stocks of which are reported very low,
prices holding late advances. Collections are
generally reported fair, those Indicating back
wardness coming most generally from th
South.
Cereal exports are again heavy, total ship
ments of wheat, including flour, for the week
amounting to 5,110.624 bushels, against 8.926.000
bushels last week. 2.515.000 bushels In this
week a year ago, 2.550,000 bushels In 1596 and
2.083,000 bushels In 1894.
Business failures for the week are the small-
Ml reported In the fourth week of January for
five years past, numbering only 2SB, against
303 last week. Â£26 in the corresponding week of
last year, 393 in 1596, 312 In 1895 and 340 In
ISS4. Of the failures reported 251. or 87 per
cent, were of concerns having $3000 capital or
less, and 95 per cent In all were" of concerns
having less than $20,000 capital.
Business failures in Canada this week num
ber 4S. against 46 last .week. 56 In the week a
year ago and 63 In the corresponding week of
ISS6. .

REVIEW OF THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW York. Jan. 28.â Bradstreefs financial
review to-morrow will say: Although the mar
ket was temporarily disturbed at the begin
ning of the week by exaggerated reports. as
to the purpose of dispatching the man-of-war
Maine to Havana, it soon recovered from the
effects of this ccare and In the past few days
developed remarkable strength and activity.
London bought stocks here to a considerable
Extent on Wednesday, though It was subse
quently a seller of part of its purchases, while
throughout the week there has been a large
amount of both investment and speculative
buying for public account, the commission
houses being active factors in the trading.
Professional Interest* of the smaller type,
while at first inclined to ait on the bear side.
were forced to cover and found it an unprofit
able course to fight this advance, more espe
cially as the market from first to last has
presented ample evidences of the activity and
support of powerful interests on the bull side.
This was especially noticeable In the Yander
bllt stocks, which group has been the central
feature of the week's speculation.
The industrials have been comparatively neg
lected, and while the local traction securities
were the object* of attention they did not lead
the market as in the preceding week.
THE CURRANT MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 28â The Journal of Com
merce says: The comparatively high cost of
currants lias turned the attention of large con
sumers to California seedless Muscatel raisins,
which, up to the past few days, have been dull
and neglected. In view of the strong statis
tical position â of currant* ' speculative Interest
In seedless Muscatel raisins has been devel
,oped, with the result that stocks available
here have been closely absorbed through the
purchase of some 1500 boxes on private terms,
supposed to be 33(3Vic or possibly a shade
â¢o*v;- m some Instances. The incentive of this
movement, it is understood, was Ui< increas
ing Inquiry from mincemeat manufacturers, to
whom the present quotations on currants are
held to be somewhat prohibitive, anil who
tun, to small California seedless raisins as a
substitute. it does not appear, however, that
other consumers have shown like interest In
the latter, though in view of the rather high
coÂ«t vt currants they are understood to be
limiting ihi_-lr purchases of that fruit to the
smallest quantities consistent with the actual
needs of consumption.
Spot supplies nf currants are represented to
be small for this time of the year, and the
stock remaining in Greece is said not to exceed
12,000 tons, which under ordinary consuming
demands from different distributing markets
of the *orld affords an unusually small supply
for the Interval between the present time and
the time when the IS9S crop will be available,
"ibout fight months hence. It is understood,
however, that the quality of most of the stock
remaining in urppee Is poor, Â«.nd this. In con
nection with the high prices in demand. Is ex
pected to curtail consumption after the small
available supplies of good fruit have be.-n
sumed. Hence the speculative interest
shown in California seedless raisins, which
seems to be the only fruit that may be sub
stituted by mincemeat makers and bakers for
currants. It Is reported that considerable pur
chases have been made for consumption at an
advance of about > 4 c over the prices prevailing.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been seven arrivals of coal from
Washington with IS. 434 tons, three from Ore
gon, 1160 tons; five from British Columbia, 13.
535 tons; one from Philadelphia, 1948 tons; two
from Swansea, 3643 tons; one from Australia,
2146 tons; total, 41.186 tons. The deliveries this
week have been most opportune, as some
characters of coal were almost entirely out of
first hands, and very light stocks of some
were held by retailers. The grades referred
to are those exclusively used for house pur
pcses, which are freely consumed during the
winter months. Under existing circumstances
the local agents' of three Seattle collieries feel
Justified In advancing their prices $1 per ton
on all deliveries from ship's side where same â 
is for domestic consumption. Fuel for steam
purposes has not been advanced, hence our
Industrial interests are not at all affected by
the temporary scarcity of other kinds.
"The continuous dry weather is beginning
to have an effect on coal freight rates from
all foreign sources: this week there has been
a pronounced advance in rates from Australia,
and large engagements have been made at
the advance. The less inducements there are
for grain carriers to seek this port, the greater
must be the freight rates paid them to trans
port coal, and for the moment no charters are
being made lor next season's crop, awaiting
some seasonable rains, which are seriously
needed in the very near future."

"Since the 7th of January the market has
been fairly active and generally lower for most
descriptions, strictly superior new crop washed
Guatemala being the only exception. Arrivals
of these have been small and insufficient to
meet orders lodged at top prices for consider
able quantities. Meanwhile all grades lower
drag. Most of the business has been in old
crop, which holders are compelled to force at
seemingly unreasonable figures to attract any I
attention whatever. In this connection It is :
worthy of explanation that he hold-over Cof
fees lack the style necessary for jobbers' pur
lition whatever. In outlet connection it the !
hy of explanation that he hold-over Cof
lack the style necessary for jobbers' pur

relative value compared with Santos grades

Butter and Eggs are no cheaper, and In fact \
the tendency Is the other way at the moment,
as the cold weather , Is keeping back supplies. :
The market is glutted with Poultry, which
Is coming In heavily from the East. Game is
also In Rood supply and cheap.
| Summer Vegetables are in light supply and ]
\ higher. Fruits are pretty well limited to Ap
ples and Oranges, which are in ample supply
for all ordinary needs. Limes are very scarce.

ALARMED AT A
DISAPPEARANCE
Spring Valley Water Company
Looking for Collector
L. M. Henry.
Rumored That the Missing Man's Ac
counts Are Short and an Inves
tigation Will Follow.
The Spring Valley Water Company Is
minus a collector. L. M. Henry, one of
the trusted employes, who has a wife
find one child, has not been seen since
Monday last by either friends or rela
tives, and much anxiety is felt for his
welfare. For twelve years Henry has
been collecting for the company through
out the Mission district, and for a time
lived at Twenty-second street, near Mis
sion, but a short time ago, according to
reports, he moved to a rooming house
on O'Farrell street, near Taylor, and
again, leaving hi* family, took a room
for two nights at 20 O'FRrrell street in
a' lodging house run by Louis Audet
It is a well known fact by the friends
i of the missing man that he is an ex
, ceedtngly hard drlnkt-r at times, and it
j is thought that he is in the city enjoying
himself, but a rumor has gained ground
i that the collector is short in his accounts
â¢ and has fled.
At any rate, the company is alarmed at
! the continued absence of Henry, and
| Chief Clerk Booker is working <"Â»n the
reports of the collector. A thorough
canvass of the ground formerly covered
by Henry is being gone over.
It is not possible that he- can be in the
company'? debt to any great â¢â¢xter.t, if at
i all. at. he had accounted for u.ll moneys
collected uj> to two clays prior to his
t mysterious disappearance. No member of
the company is aware of tho addr
Henry nor of that of any membr-r of his
family, and It is possibly due to this fact
that he cannot be found, although it ls
acknowledged that Mrs. Henry called at
the office but a day or two ago and in
quired if her husband was still in tho
company's employ, and whether or not
he had been seen there within the past
few days.
While the chif>f r-lork of tho company
has been working on the books no other
bookkeeper has b^en given any knowl
edge of the standing of accounts, and it
is thought nothing will be done until
Henry has been located or it is fully
determined that the now mapected col
lector had fled the country to escape
i prosecution. Many friends of tho miss
ing man are of the opinion that Henry
will return when he learns of the anx
ictv felt for his safety and for the money
which he had in charge at the time of
his disappearance.
An Illinois railway mall clerk has
been doing a little figuring on his
twenty-four years' service, and finds
that he has traveled 803,784 miles and
handled 57,916,144 pieces of mall matter.

TOOK A GIRL
FOR A BURGLAR
Amusing Experience of
a Robber-Hunting
Party.
An Innocent Servant Starts the
Alarm and Is Cap
tured.
Dr. Lanz Convinced Thnt Thieves
Have Designs on His
Home.
Oakland Office. San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 28.
The numerous burglaries that nre
now being committed are productive of
some very amusing experiences, but
none is more ludicrous than an ad
venture which occurred at the house
of Dr. Lanz in East Oakland last night.
On two or three occasions recently
the doctor has been aware of the fact
that men have been prowling around
his house after dark, and he has dis
covered evidence that left no doubt in
his mind that their intention was to j
break in and take whatever of value
they could find.
He decided on a plan which he be
lieved would succeed in capturing any
burglar who might come to his prem
ises. His residence is at the corner of
Fourth avenue and East Twelfth
street, and anticipating thieves, he in
vited four young fellows to his house,
all of them over six feet two inches in
height. He thought that with this gang
of giants they would accomplish some
thing. These young men were A. F.
McDonald. Thomas J. Thompson, Har
old McCoy and F. Millar. They passed
the early portion of the evening in
stretching threads across the pathway
that leads to the entrance. Dr. Lanz
had previously attached a powerful
burglar alarm to the front door, and
these threads were connected with it.
About 10 o'clock, when the house was
all dark, and the young men on guard,
the residents in that neighborhood
were aroused by hearing loud yells, as
of a lady in distress, from the vicinity
of Dr. Lanz's house. Four tall fellows
were seen to be pursuing a fleeing fig
ure, but the flight soon stoppe.i whÂ«-n
they discovered that they were chasing
a woman.
A little investigation showed that it
was Dr. I^anz's servant's night off. ami
about 10 o'clock she was returning to
the house. On going up the pathway
she unconsciously broke the little black
thread, the burglar alarm, unlike most
machines of its character, worked with
precision, and .in Instant later the
frightened maid, followed by the tall
guards, was flying down the pathway.
all shouting like coyotes.
This attempted burglary has not
been reported to the police.

TO SIMPLIFY
LICENSING
A Matter of Interest to
the Three Bay
Cities.
The Present System a Source of i
Annoyance to Many
Interests.
A Conference Proposed for the Pur
pose of Promoting Uni
formity.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 28.
Some time ago it -was proposed that
a conference be held between repre
sentatives of Alameda, Oakland and
Berkeley for the purpose of agreeing
upon a system of local licenses that
would be satisfactory to all thrpp
places. This conference has not been
held and there is dally a growing need
of uniformity of the license system on
this side of the bay.
The town of Alameda Is now consid
ering a new license ordinance, and It
is believed that if officials of the three
towns g-ot together this never-ending
source of trouble to merchants, ex
ptvspmen and others could be obvi
ated.
In the Oakland Police Court cases
are constantly arising of hack drivers
and expressmen and drivers* of deliv
ery wapons hf-ing arrested for coming
Into this city and doing business with
out taking out the necessary license,
dn tbÂ« other hanl, if Alameda has a
funeral and rÂ» quires more hacks than
are available In her t^wn, no carriage
can g" over tn Oakland to take part In
thÂ»- funeral cortege unless the drivers
fortify themselves with a license cost
ing s^vpral dollars per annum. In
Berkeley th*> same efforts have been
made to protect the merchants of th<*
town from thp incursions of Oakland
solicitors, ami thr result Is that the
three towns are constantly arresting
people and subjecting them to much
annoyance over a matter which could
easily be adjusted, for it Is not impos
sible for the different governments to
agr^c upon ponr' system by which each
â¢hall receive its share of revenue from
tho lic*Â»nso business without working
hardships on the other two towns.
The Merchants' Kxehange of Oak
land has discussed this license matter
very thoroughly and its members could
BÂ»-nd a delegation to such a conference
that would be a material help in ad-
Justing the matter, for while many
consider it necessary to protect this
side of the bay from San Francisco mer

there is any groat necessity to protect

CONDUCTOR WARE
LOSES HIS WIFE
Makes Public His Intention to
Pay No More Family
Bills.
Husband Says Wife Loved Dress,
She Says He Was Too
Stingy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 28.
Frank E. Ware, a well-known conduc
tor on the Southern Pacific, published
one of those significant little notices to
night stating that his wife, Mary, having
left his home without due caus<\ he does
not intend to pay any more of her bills.
Four years ago Frank Ware married
Mary Edwards, and the young couple
WWO given quite a Hend-off by the many
fellow-employes of the road. For a while
all Went well and their little home was
one of peace and happiness, but Mrs.
Ware gradually tired of trying to live
within the limits of her husband's salary.
The conductor, on the other hand, was
anxious to hav> I fund, and this
little matter of finance* gradually led to
a gap which fast widened.
The young folks were of tender years
when they married and Mrs. Ware's ro
mantic ideas could not be carried out on
l v inductor's modest salary, and her
dream was soon dispelled. Some time ago,
the husband says, she took all her little
possessions and their spare cash, and
although he will not say one harsh word
against her, he declares she had no Just
cause for breaking up his home. He has
men ly stated that he could not persuade
his wifp that noble qualities, rather than
fine dress, make a good wife. On theother
hiind Mrs. War-- says her husband was
stingy and Irritable, and so has ended
the little romance 'if their lives.
DOMESTIC INFELICITIES.
J. Boynton Leaves Hon)e, His Wife
Tak.es Poison â A Daugh
ter Is Missing,
OAKLAND. Jan. 28.â Mrs. A. Boynton
of 63 Valley street started a commotion
yesterday forenoon by announcing that
she had taken a dose of poison. Dr.
Shannon was called, lv.it when he ar
rived nhrt had co far recovered that she
r.fiis.Â«i to talk of the affair. However,
it is claimed that she told her children
that Bbfl was going io commit suicide.
Mr. Hoynton is an electric railway em
ploye, and after quurrellng with his wife
it U asserted that he left with the an
nouncement that ho would stay away.
This is said to have caused Mrs. Boyn
ton to art as she did. To-day another
chapter was added to the family diffi
culties, for Katie, a 16-year-old daughter,
disappeared and her mother notified the
police and asked that they try to locate
her. She fears that the girl will be lost.
However, it is the prevailing opinion that
Katie has K"ne to her father, who, it is
reported, was hurt last night on leaving
his car. He could not be found to-night.

TO ISSUE A
PICTURE BOOK
Alameda County Anxious
to Appear to Good
Advantage.
Taxpayers to Get Illustrations
of Some Recent Road Im
provements.
An Attempt to Lot tVia People SoÂ©
What They Get for a Million
and a Half.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 28.
Alameda County intends to be very
generous. Within a few weeks ? mod
erate amount of dollars will be expend
ed in placing before the taxpayers an il
lustrated annual report which is just
what the taxpayers need, and which, if
it had been issued annually* for the last
ten years, would have saved much of
the suspicion that has hung over the
actions of the county officials.
This illustrated report of County j
Clerk Jordan will not only contain an
intelligently resume of all the expendi
tures of the county, but it will also be
illustrated In such a manner that the
citizens may see where the money has
gone and what results it has produced.
The annual cost of administering the
government of Alameda County Is i
about $1,600,000, and there has long been
an idea prevalent that a large percent
age of this could be saved. General
charges of extravagance and injudi
eiousness have frequently been made,
and not without reason, but now that it
is proposed to place before the people
a truthful account of the expenditure
of their money, it will be possible for
the citizens to carefully scan those fig
ures and intelligently frame a platform
upon which Supervisors and county of
ficials must stand a 9 regards econ
omy.
One of the sources of expense with
which least sympathy has been shown
is th<- county Infirmary. The new re
port will contain several pictures of the
department of this institution, which
will convey a better idea than any other
medium and give a correct im
pression of conditions at the in
dlgents' home. A series of pic
tures has also been made of some
of the permanent concrete culverts that
have been built on the county road. It
was formerly the custom to squander
a few thousand dollars every year on
patching up wooden culverts, but dur
ing the past four years several of
these flimsy affairs have been replaced
by solid pieces of masonry that will
stand for all time. Many permanent
iron I. ridges have been built in place
of the old wooden structures, and it is
the intention of the report to show
these things pictorially and to adver
tise to all the country that the affairs
i of this county are tolerably well ad
j ministered. No annual reports were
issued till three years ago, when Clerk
; Jordan issued a partial one. The fol
lowing year one a little more complete
1 was fled, but that now in progress
goes into detail and will leave ro ex
cuse for any one not to be well ln
; formed on the county's finances.
LIVINGSTONE AT LARGE.
f\ Trusty Scales the Jail Wall and
Escapes.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2S.â Abe Livingstone,
a trusty serving a six months' sentence
in the County Jail for petty larceny,
made his escape this forenoon and has
not been seen nor heard of since. He
went into the court to hang out some
clothe* to dry. His continued absence
led another trusty to investigate. He
could not find Livingstone anywhere and
at onco reported to Jailer I^ane.
A search was instituted and it was dip
covered that the missing man ha<i used
the corner stones of the southwest wing
as a stepladder to reach the roof of the
main Jail. He had then walked across
the building to the wall on the Washing
ton street side. This he followed to the
south end and jumped to the grass di
rectly below the office window and made
his escape without being detected. The
imprint of his feet in the grass can be
distinctly seen.
A number of prisoners have made their
escape in this way in the past when they
were allowed to exercise in the court.
This has been denied them for the past
two years, and only trusties were allowed
to go into the court. The attention of the
Board of Supervisors has been called to
the place in the past, but without avail.
Something may now be done to protect it.
She Warded a Ride.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2S.â Miss Annie Roch
berg. aged 25. took a buggy from in front
of the residence of E. H. Benjamin, cor
ner of Oak and Eleventh streets, this aft
ernoon at 3 o'clock and drove off with it.
The loss was reported to the police short
ly afterward, but it was after 8 o'clock
before any trace of the missing rig was
found. At that time a telephone mes
sage reached the police station that
some one had driven into Lake Merritt,
off the foot of Boulevard terrace, and
that they would perish without help. The
patrol wagon was dispatched, to the place
with Sergeant Peterson and Officer Cock
erton. They found the horse in the mud
up to his body and the buggy over the
springs, with a woman in it. A rope was
made fast and the buggy pulled back by
the patrol wagon team. The horse was
then secured.
When searched in the police station
Miss Rochberg had $41 15. She was poorly
dad. with no wrap and an old cap. When
asked why she took the rig she replied,
"I wanted a ride." Not another word
would she offer in response to questions.
She is a Swede and declares that she has
been living "nowhere" in the past.
SecK'ng Another Site.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2*.â The special com
mittee on the proposed new municipal
buildings decided to recorrflnend to the
City Council that the City Hall site be
sold at auction, except the portion occu
pied by the engine house and tower and
a ten-foot driveway, and that the City-
Attorney be iisked to prepare a peti
tion providing for the reception of bids
for lota within a half mile of the present
building, not less than 200 feet by 300 feet,
for a new site. The meeting consisted of
Councilmen Rowe, Pringle and Henne
berry. Mayor Thomas. City Attorney
Dow and City Engineer Clement. The
recommendations met with the hearty ap
proval of these gentlemen. The matter of
the best shape in which to offer the pres
ent site was not decided, and another
meeting will be held next week to de
cide that.

OAKLAND, Jan. 2S.âC. P. Johnson, who

d>>. and. after due notice, the city itself
â  undertook the task of removal, and tore
: up liU forty-foot masts belonging to the
i intruders. Those were stored in the cor

mins, who imposed upon so many people
with fictitious tales of his wealth, which
consisted of packages of brown paper
done up to resemble bank bills. In the

ment.

"LADIES` DAY " ESTABLISHED.
The San Francisco Club Opens
Its Doors to the Gentler Sex.
The San Francisco Club has reached a
degree of popularity during its brief ex
istence second to none of the bachelor
homes of the city. Its fine clubrooms on
the sixteenth and seventeenth floors of
the Claus Spreckels Building, and tho
magnificent view of the city, bay and
surrounding country obtained therefrom
have had much to do with establishing it
in the good graces of clubmen; and now
the wives, sisters and sweethearts are
clamoring for a peep into the charmed
and charming circle, and another peep at
the fairy-like panorama spread out be
low and around in every direction.
This clamoring has become so great
the club has been forced to take cogniz
ance of it, and last night tho board of
directors met and set aside tho first and
third Wednesdays of each month, to be
designated as "Ladles' Day."' when mem
bers will be permitted to extend tho hos
pitalities of tho club to their lady rela
tivea and friends. The dining-room will
be open to guests for luncheon, which
will be served from 11 a. m. to 3 p. m.
The members of the Â«-iub are delighted
with the innovation, while the ladies are,
overjoyed at the prospect of obtaining
admittance to the clubrooms.

SIX CHOICES
LAID TO REST
Acrobatic Buck Massie
Beaten in a Walk by
Fleur de Lis.
Spencer Earned Fresh Laurels
by His Effort on Harry
Thoburn.
Treachery Developed an Attack of
Speedâ Eddie Jones Was Out
for Glory.
Any old sort of a thing seems to go
at the track nowadays. Run a horse
to-day at 3 to 5, get him beaten a city
block, and cut him loose a few days
later at 4 to 1 or better, and it's all
right. This is modern "Western racing,
but it won't last. There has been a
supply of "lobsters" at both o-f the two
big tracks for the past three weeks in
quantities large enough to keep a thou
sand Klondike miners from starving to
death. If the judges continue in the
game lenient mood, the end can be pre
dicted.
On Friday, January 21, Buck Massie
was a veritable wonder, beating 'Ost
ler Joe, The Roman and Tom Crom
well over one mile and a sixteenth, with
his tongue hanging out. almost pulled
to a walk. Yesterday the brown horse
started in a mile dash, a 9-to-20 favor
ite, and after going half a mile, went to
pieces, and was disgracefully beaten by
Fleur de Lis, backed by the knowing
ones. To be sure, the 'time, 1:40^,
marked an excellent performance, and
the winner is a rare good mare, but
Buck's early disinterestedness is en
tirely inexplicable. The new owners of
Rubicon did not fancy that horse's
chances, and of course as the only re
maining starter he was in duty bound
to finish third. The favorite's downfall
may have been right up to form, but
certainly more was expected from him,
considering his long Eastern record.
Another brilliant piece of workman
chip was that of "Slim" Spencer, astride
Harry Thoburn. If medals were pre
sented to jockeys for favorite slaying.
Spencer is entitled to half a dozen or so,
even if they were given to him all in a
bunch for this one ride alone. The
horse opened a 5-to-2 second choice for
the fifth race, a mile selling affair, and
the generous bookies were pleased just
before the curtain arose to- lay a little
Ito 2 that Harry didn't show. If Spen
cer is troubled with insomnia then the
ride justified the price. When the
horses issued from the saddling pad
dock in answer to the bujrle call. Judge
Murphy summoned Spencer to the
stand. What the official said may be
heard later in the phonograph. It was
not repeated to the press. To add to
the ridiculousness of the situation
Caldwell, in a gay mood, sent the field
away to a fantastic start. Marplot, an
outsider, off in front. He maintained
the lead to the end, finishing three
lengths ahead of the post favorite. San
Marco. Aroused once near the half
mile pole by the squeakings of a stall
door, Spencer again relapsed Into a
reverie, and was beaten out for the
Fhow by Conley on the outsider, Don
Clarenclo. Los Prletos was left at the
post, and Cromwell might just as well
have been.
All six favorites were burled with due
honors. Some of them received pood
rides and some did not. The book
makers enjoyed the sport, and as It be
prlr.s to look as though these pentry
and not the public were entitled to pro
tection it will have to pass as a good
day's racinp.
The Burns & "Waterhouse pair. Gold
Frrateh and Malay, ruled favorites In
the bettinc: on tho two-year-old scram
ble, and one of them, Malay, just man
aged to bite off the short end of the
purse. Thp winner turned up in the
Midlothian filly. Saintly, a 4 to 1 chance

Atkin & Lottridge. She assumed the
lead in the stretch and won easily
from Ollnthus, the brother to Diggs.
A band of fourteen platers faced the
barrier In the alx-furlong sprint fol
lowing, and so closely were they
bunched until the stretch was reached
that the probable winner was a mat
ter of mere conjecture. Treachery, a
15 to 1 shot, finally drew clear and lÂ«^d
Silver State and Jack Martin out with
considerable to spare. The latter two
were but noses apart. Palmerston
opened favorite, but was never promi
nent.
The faint-hearted Scotch Rose was
made favorite for the fourth, another
six-furlong spin, and failed to get
within the money. In the stretch
Macklin brought Kamsln up and won
handily. In a hard drive Benamela
nosed out Amelia Fonso for the place.
The winner was a 13 to 1 shot.
The final race on the card was a
sovm-furlong run for three-year-olds.
Eddie Jones, with 125 pounds on his
back, opened favorite at odds of 7 to 6,
but the stable did not fancy him to any
great extent and he receded to 4 to 1.
Hermoso led to the stretch, where the
good thing. Gloriam. took the lead. He
did not last long and Torsida taking
the lead won. ridden out half a length
in front of Linstock. Eddie Jones was
a good third.

OAKLAND WATER
COMPANIES JOIN HANDS
Bitter Fight Which Has Raged for Years Suddenly Ended and
the Corporations Pool Issues to Get a
Raise in Rates.
ONLY ASK FOR A "SLIGHT READJUSTMENT."
IN an interview published in The
Call on the Bth inst.. President Din
gee of the Oakland Water Company
said that the two companies which
supply Oakland with water had reach
ed an agreement to end the war and
charge full rates allowed by the ordi
nance of the city.
This mild termination to the bitter
fight which has been waged between
the Centra Costa Water Company and
the Oakland Water Company for the
past three years naturally had a suspi
cious appearance, and led to much
speculation on tin 1 part of the citizens
of tho city across the bay regarding
the outcome of this new alliance.
Among those who were afraid that
this truce boded ill for the people was
W. J. Abernathy. who concluded that it
might be well to take advantage of
the prevailing rate and forestall any
posible raise by paying for a year in
advance. Much to his surprise, howev
er, when he tendered his money to the
Contra Costa Water Company it was
declined, and the official refused to ac
cept pay for more than one month.
When Mr. Abernathy wondered at this
disinclination of the corporation to use
his money for a year and pressed the
mattor upon tho official he was told
that there would be an adjustment of
rates, and until that was accomplished
the company would take pay for no
more than <me month.
President Dfngee of the Oakland "Wa
ter Company was seen yesterday re
garding the rumors which have been
current that there would be an attempt
on the part of the two companies to
have the Council raise the r:<tes dur
ing the coming month. He was also
asked whether the present truce be
tween the companies meant a possible
consolidation.
President Dingee has an affable smile
and a politic manner, and when he
turns them both loose upon an Inquisi
tive visitor he of an inquiring frame of
mind may rest assured that while he
has been courteously treated by Oak
land Water Company's president he
has gained nn information on the lines
of his research. Both the affable smile
and politic manner -were in evidence
yesterday, and beyond the fact that the
companies would ask the Council for
"a little readjustment of rates" nothing
was elicited regarding v the plans and
A HEMP FACTORY

Industry.
Some of the Capital Is Already

Two Important matters were considered I
at the meeting of the directors of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Aasocla- |
tion on Thursday. One was the question ]
whether or not the body should continue i
Its support of the Manufacturers' and
Importers' League, and the other related i
to the establishment of a factory for the
manufacture of crude hemp. It will be
remembered that the association was the
father of the league mentioned. It, by
offering free transportation to the mer
chants in the country, induced many to
come to this city and make their winter
and spring purchases. This aroused the
antagonism of many of the manufac

Intentions of the two companies.
In fact, there was a suspicious Igno
rance in both offices as to the future
moves of the companies.
But while there is a disinclination to
talk business on the part of water
company officials, such disinclination
does not reach the people, and the fear
is growing that there is a deep laid plot
on the part of the two erstwhile war
ring corporations to form an alliance
which will at least be offensive if not
defensive. It is also generally believed
that this offensive alliance means that
the people will have to suffer by having
a return to the rates which prevailed
before the non-partisan Council took
hold of things three years ago and cut
the rates almost in half.
Just how this is to be accomplished
is what is puzzling the people bf Oak
land now, and the mystery which
hedges about the actions of the com-
panics but increases the belief that
something Is hatching which has for
its object the benefit of tho water com
panies at the expense of the people.
The State law is rather obscure re
garding water rates, and it is this ob
scurity that led to the condition which
prevailed when the non-partisan Coun
cil went into office and cut the rates.
According to the law. it is incumbent
upon the City Council tn fix the water
rates in February of each year, mak
ing such rates as will give a fair in
come upon the value of the plant.
It is this question of value of the
plant which is expected to cut a big
figure in the coming effort to have the
rates "readjusted." Old time Councils
were complaisant and accepted the fig
ures of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany as being the true value of the
plant of that company, but when the
non-partisan Council started in on thÂ«
question, it decided that it might be
well to investigate values a little, and
the result was that instead of being
valued at a little above $6,000,000, It wan
cut down to the more modest sum of
$2,124,659 52, and then, to make all pos
sible allowance for mistakes, the sum
of $300,000 was added, making a total
valuation of $2, 424,659 52 as being full
and ample for the entire plant of the
company. With this valuation the
rates were so fixed that the company
could obtain an income of 5 per cent of
turers of Stockton, Sacramento. Los An
prlfs and other large cities on the coast.
Secretary Mead, A. Sbarboro an others
took the position that the association was
not formed for the purpose of favoring
any one locality, but to protect and fostÂ«r
the industries of the whole State. The
fate of the league was finally left to a
committee consisting of L. R. Mead, T).
Everett and A. Sbarboro to report next
Thursday.
The erection of a factory for the manu
facture of hemp promises to be an im
portant feature in the debates of the as
sociation. President Kerr gave an out
line of what may some day be one of the
largest Industries of the coast, the culti
vation of hemp. He said that many ex
periments have demonstrated that the
finest hemp in the world has been raised
in this State. The raw article from Kern
Tulare and Butte counties has been sent
to the East and Europe, where it was
pronounced to have no equal. I^nst year
400 acres were planted in hemp near Grid
ley which yielded 2i/\< pounds to the acre.
This was sold on tne ground to a New
York firm for 5Vi cents. The cost of pro
duction was only $20 per acre, so the
profit to the producer was great. Mr.
Kerr said that in many places the hemp
grows to a height of twenty feet and
near Gridley the crop grew fifteen feet in
ninety days. There is, he says, no plant
west- of the Rocky Mountains for the
manufacture of this fiber, yet over 800 000
pounds are used In the manufactured
form of twine, netting, etc., by the people
of the State. A company has already been
formed for the erection of a plant, and
srmc of the capital is raised. A small
plant, giving employment to about forty
people, would not cost over $75,000, and
lie said that the association should give
I this venture its support. The matter was
I referred to a committee to be appointed
| later.

this amount, this being deemed a Just
and equitable income on the invest
ment.
But the Oakland Water Company
made its appearance about this time,
and k was discovered that the Contra
Costa Water Company could soil watÂ«r
at a lower rate than that fixed by the
Council, for a cut was made, and for
the past three years the people of Oak
land have profited by the effort to drive
a rival from the field.
That this was a ruinous war there is
no doubt, and, while the officials of the
company will not admit that the com
pany was losing money, innocent own
ers of Contra Costa Water Company
stock have suffered in that they have
received no dividends for the past two
years. This Is notably the case with
the Old Ladles' Home at Temes^al.
which holds a block of the Contra Cos
ta Water Works' stock, the income of
which helped to maintain that institu
tion until the unfortunate war began,
and since then there has been a deficit
in the treasury of the home because
there have been no returns in the way
of dividends from its stock.
There are several elements of danger
to the people of Oakland in the situa
tion to-day. The Contra Costa Water
Company affirms that Its plant has a
valuation of $6,059,962 29. The Oakland
Water Company affirms that its plant
has a valuation of a few dollars less
than $6,000,000.
These valuations are reached by that
peculiar process of figuring known to
corporations which are compelled to
comply with laws, and unless the City
Council is careful and painstaking
thope figures may be accepted as the
basis ifpon which to fix the rates. Un
til the Xon-Partisan Council took its
seat these figures of the Contra Costa
Company were accepted, and the result
was that with 15 per cent less popula
tion than at present the people of Oak
land gave that company an annual in
come of $407,926. But when the new
Council Investigated matters it found
that the valuation was rather high,
and the result was that in three years
these exorbitant figures were reduced
until the combined income of both com
panies for the year 1897 amounted to
but $242,338. a difference in favor of
the pecrple of $165,588.

MINERS HEAR
ABOUT DAMS
The Chief of Engineers Writes
That Things Will Be
Hustled.
Good Prospects for â¢ Secretary of
Minea Reported to the Min
ers' Association.
After long and weary waiting on the
part of the California miners, the Federal
Government has at last been officially
heard from concerning those restraining
dams that are not being built, and for
which Congress and the State have each
appropriated $250,000. besides other appro
priations for river improvements.
Communications from General John M.
Wilson, Chief of Engineers at Washing
ton, relating thereto were made public
on Friday at a meeting of the executive
! committee of the California Miners' As
| soclation in the rooms of the Union
League Club.
The Chief of Engineers reviews the
Congressional legislation, mentions the
preliminary report on the improvement of
the Lower Sacramento River, made five
weeks ago by the Federal engineers here,
and says:
"A report for the Upper Sacramento
and Feather rivers will be submitted at
the earliest day possible." He observes
that this State has appropriated $300,000
for river improvement, that he knows of
no law connecting Government agents
with its expenditure, and that a report
on plans submitted by the Commissioner
of Public Works of California will soon
be made.
As to dams, it is declared that the Cali
fornia Debris Commissioners are pushing
surveys and researches as rapidly as con
sistent with thorough investigation, etc.,
and the communtcatiQn winds up as fol
lows:
The magnitude of the work will be fully
appreciated by those who have been familiar
with these troublesome and conflicting ques
tions for so many years. It appears that the
work upon which the California Debris Com
mission Is engaged cannot lÂ«e materially ad
vanced by an Increase of force, nor can a de
finite date be fixed for the presentation of
plans for Impounding dams nn headquarters
of the Sacramento and Feather rivers. The
chief of engineers will Impress upon the Debris
Commission the importance of advancing the
work assigned to them by law as rapidly as is
consistent with lta importance.
The matter was referred to the com
mittee on dams, of which A. Camlnetti is
chairman.
Tirey L. Ford made an encouraging re
port on the prospect of getting a depart
ment of mines and mining at this ses
with the present ordinance which was
â¢ i last year that may throw some
light on th^> future. When the retiring
Council followed thÂ« usual custom
and prepared Ita ordlnunce fixing thÂ»Â»
water rat^s the measun was passed to
print, and then two days before the ex
piration of the Council's term Presi
dent Mott culled a special meeting to
pass th>> ordinance. It was announced
by the clerk that the ordinance had
net been printed the stated number
of times as required by law, and an
investigation showed that the column
advertisement had actually been left
out of the Tribune several times, thus
vitiating the ordinance and throwing
it ovt-r to the new Council.
President Ifott Raw the danger and
made such a vigorous attack upon the
scheme that if any were Intended it
was not pressed and the new Council
paâ fd thf ordinance as prepared by
its predecessors. Whatever may have
been the intention at that time it was
frustrated by the timely action of
President Mott, but the fact remains
that the water companies, or some one
Interested In the matter, had things
s>> fxed that the new Council, which
is the one that will fix the rates next
month, could try its hand at rate fix
ing.
The water companies will file their
statements next Monday afternoon and
will make a showing of a combined
valuation approaching $12,000,000. The
city Council will fix the rates for the
ensuing year at the meetings during
the month of February. If the Coun
cil takes the valuation set by either
company as a basis the present rate
will be doubled. If there is a combina
tion of companies and the total rate
is used as a basis the rate will be
quadrupled. If the Council accepts
the result of the investigation of the
former Council, which showed that the
valuations set by the companies are
absurd, the rates will remain as at
present. But the danger is that the
combined arguments of the two com
panies will lead the members of the
Council to believe that the valuations
set by the former Council are too low
and the City Fathers will attempt "a
little readjustment of rates" that will
end to the satisfaction of the water
companies, but not to the benefit of
the people of Oakland.

Miss Ray Frank, when delivering: her
lecture at Mrs. Sloss' residence yester
day, spoke of the various theories con
cerning the origin and distribution of
myths, legends and tales, explaining the
difference between a myth and a legend.
Her remarks showed study, and were de
livered in the pleasing manner that
makes Miss Frank's lectures so popular.
She said that philology had thus far
done more than aught else to determine
the meaning and kinship of legends. The
phenomena of nature had undoubtedly
originally given rise to the myths and
legends of the people.

Will Sit In Bank-
At a meeting of the Judges of the Su
perior Court, held a few days ago. it was
decided that all appeals from judgments
rendered by the Police Courts would In
future be heard by the three Criminal
Judges of the Superior Court sitting In
bank. In this way certains days can be
Mt aside for the hearing of the appeals
and the work of the higher courts will
not be seriously Interfered with. An opin
ion rendered by three Judges will also
be much more satisfactory than if ren
dered by one, and will undoubtedly save
the Supreme Court much work as ap
peals, it is thought, will seldom be" taken
from the judgment of the Superior Court
in bank.

Two bold pirates boarded the tug
Water Witch yesterday morning while
the crew was asleep and got away with
a quantity of clothing and several ar
ticles of jewelry.
The heaviest loser was H. A. Rod
gers. the engineer. The pirate en
tered his room and breaking open his
trunk stole several suits of clothing,
two overcoats, several shirts and a
watch and chain which he prized very
highly.
Last night Rodgers visited police
headquarters and informed Chief Lees
of the occurrence. He gave a descrip
tion of the stolen property, and Detec
tives Bee and Harper Mere detailed to
find it.
During the past few weeks a number
of vessels have been visited by pirates
and a large amount of valuable prop
erty has been stolen. Owing to the
numerous complaints received from
ship owners of the dt-predations of pi
rates Chief Lees has specially detailed
two <>f his best nun to arrest them.
Detectives Gibson and Wren last
ev.-ning arrested two crooks who were
1 said to be clever pickpockets. Their
i names are Thomas Gaellng and Bar
! ney Goldstein. They were detected
working the crowd which attended the
review of the troops at the Presidio
i yesterday afternoon.
Goldstein, it is said, is one of the
cleverest pickpockets in the country.
He was caught in the act of picking
a woman's pocket, but before he could
secure her purse he saw the detective
and staged to run away. He was cap
i tured after a short chase, and after he
and his pal were handcuffed together
they were taken to the City Prison and
their names registered on the "small"
book.
James Dunn, who lives at 262 Natoma
street, claims he was attacked by two
men at Third and Folsom streets at an
early hour yesterday morning. One of
the men, he says, grabbed his watch
chain. He shouted for help, when his
assailants struck him several blows in
the face, knocking him down. They
then fled without making any further
attempt to rob him. Dunn was picked
up by a policeman and removed to the
Receiving Hospital, where a deep cut
over his right eye was dressed.
A young man named John Dugan
went into a grocery store on Third
street, near Folsom, last night, and,
drawing a policeman's club, ordered the
clerk to "shell out." Fearing that he
Intended to Injure him, the clerk sought
protection behind a sugar barrel. Du
| gan then opened the cash drawer, tak
ing the contents, amounting to 50 cents.
On leaving the store he was arrested
by Policemen Van Kuren and Kiley,
who had been summoned by a citizen
who witnessed the transaction.
At the City Prison Dugan was charg
ed with carrying a concealed weapon,
petty larceny and disturbing the peace.
The money which he took was founn In
his possession, and was booked as evi
dence against him. _

tribution of grain. Railroads offered to
carry the grain free of charge, and when
the grain arrived at tho various centers
of distribution thousands of hungry peo
