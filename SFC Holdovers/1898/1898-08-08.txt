ThJE PRESIDENT AS
fIN "IMPERIALIST."
NEW YORK, Aug. 7.âAccord
ing to a close personal friend of
President McKinley, a man in
high official station in Washing
ton, these are the President's
views as to the ultimate results
of the war: Porto Rico to be
come a possession of the United
States; Cuba to be held under a
protectorate with a view of ulti
mate annexation; Manila and the
Island of Luzon to pass Into the
control of the United States, as
Hongkong is under the control of
England; one of the "Ladrone
Islands to be annexed to the
United States.
So far as Porto Rico and the
Ladrones are concerned it is
pointed out the programme is to
be fulfilled by the terms of peace
with Spain. The same terms
prepare the way for the execu
tion of the remainder.
President McKinley's friends
say he has become an enthusi
astic "imperialist" since the war
began, and that he has no fear of
the result of extension of terri
tory.
treaty of peace, the officials here are
proceeding: under the conviction that
j the end has come and are giving at
| tention to the steps to be taken next.
i In view of the delay in coming to this
j conclusion, the idea was beginning to
prevail that the Spanish Government
was about to enter a plea In abate
i ment and that the answer would be
j again inconclusive. In this case the
j President was disposed to deal firmly
with the issue, to give notice that our
proposals were withdrawn and to let It
be understood that when Spain again
sued for peace the conditions would be
more severe than those first laid down.
If the Spanish answer should embody
I an effort to secure any material change
|in the conditions it will meet with
; prompt rejection.
Some reference has been made in the
dispatches of British newspapers to a
desire on the part of the Spanish Gov
ernment to include in the preliminary
agreement a clause exempting it from
liability for the Cuban ivbt. The for-
I mal statement of the points of the
I Unltad States note given out from the
I White House made no reference to this
i subject and it cannot be known as yet
| whether or not the full text shows any
thing more. But presuming that no
reference whatever is made to the Cu
ban debt. It is possible the subject may
be regarded as one that should be
treated by the peace commissioners,
who are to meet later to frame the
treaty which, of course, will embody
many details that are left untouched
in the main proposition, though Cabinet
officers have authorized the statement
that no part of the Cuban or Porto
Rican debts would be assumed by the
United States. Based upon the press
reports of the progress being made at
Madrid toward returning the answer
of Spain, it was calculated by the de
partment officials that the formal note
could not be delivered to the President
before to-morrow, and that was also
the belief of the French Embassador.
From the length of time consumed in
its preparation, the note was believed
to be long, thus entailing the eonsump- !
tion of much time in forwarding it first i
to Paris, reducing it to cipher there,
transmitting it over the cable and then
re-translating it at the French Em
bassy.
In the case of the last note the at
taches of the embassy worked nearly
all night to prepare their communica- j
tion to the Spanish Government, though !
the conference with the President I
closed before 5 o'clock in the afternoon, i
with the Embassndor in possession of J
the United States" note. Should the I
Spanish answer be an unconditional ac- j
ceptance of our terms some negotiation ;
may be necessary to agree upon the
steps to be taken to give effect to the
agreement. So far as can be learned
it has not yet been determined how
this shall J>e done. There are two way*,
then. Thtf first Is a military capitula
tion by the captain generals of Cubi
and Porto Rico, which will immediately

commanders in technical occupation t.t

SECRETARY OF STATE DAY
WILL RETIRE FROM OFFICE
WITH THE COMING OF PEACE
NEW YORK. Aug. 7.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: In connection with the
probable selection of Secretary Day as
one of the commissioners, I am able to
make the important announcement that
he will at an early date retire from the
office of Secretary of State, and after
concluding his labors as a member of
the commission resume the practice of
law in Canton. Although this is the
first public announcement that Secre
tary Day intends to retire from public
life, It has long been known to his most
intiraate friends that when he accepted
the portfolio he did so with the under
standing that he would resign his office
immediately after peace had been re
stored between Spain and the United
States.
The 'main reason assigned by the
friends of Secretary Day for his desire
to leave the Cabinet is that he does not
feel financially able to hold an office
which involves so many social obliga
tions of an expensive character. He
feels that having served his country
during the trying period he should now
resume his law practice while still in
the prime of life in order to make am
ple provision for his family in the fu
ture. It is not known whether the Sec
retary contemplates retiring with his
appointment as one of the commission
ers or upon the final conclusion of the
treaty of peace. Should he defer his
resignation until the commissioners
have concluded their labors Assistant
Secretary Moore will act as Secretary
in his absence, and the President will
thus be able to postpone the selection
of a new Secretary until next fall.
At this time the President has not
made up his mind as to the selection of
Secretary Day's successor, or if so he
has not yet taken any one into his con
fidence. Hence there is plenty of time
for speculation as to the next Secretary
of State. Among the names which
doubtless will soon come prominently to
the front are Senator Cushman K. Da
vis, Embassador Hay, Embassador
Horace Porter, Postmaster-General
Charles Emory Smith and Attorney-
General J. W. Griggs.
armies In tho islands. The intention as
to whether they shall be permitted to
carry off their arms is not now as ma
terial as it was in the case of the sur
render of General Toral's forces at
Santiago, where, occurring in the midst
of the campaign, there was a necessity
for securing the moral effect of com
pelling 1 the Spanish soldiers to lay down
their arms. Spain having succumbed
it might be urged that the United
States might grant a concession on this
point to Spanish pride without fear of
having the action attributed to fear
for the consequences of a refusal. This
would not apply, however, to the vol
unteers who might elect to remain in
Cuba, as it would not be prudent to
allow so large a body of men to carry
arm? without restraint in the days of
reconstruction, when delicate and diffi
cult matters of internal policy; are to

that war with Spain was ayort.^l as a
result of the Virginius affair. This
course, having the weight of precedent,
may be adopted In this ease. It is
probable that in the Philippines the
greatest difficulty will be met in put
ting the agreement into effect on ac
count of the attitude of the insurgents,
but General Merritt is now gaining in
strength daily and probably will be in

General Wade's reinforcements for
General Miles are going forward re

tiations. The agreement to negotiate
a treaty of peace does not necessarily
carry with it a cessation of hostilities.

i a month after the peace negotiations

to be closed, and if desirable these re
inforcements may be intercepted and

Spain's request for explanation reached
Madrid Friday evening. The text has
not been given out, but It is known that
it brought little consolation.
President McKinley turned a deaf ear
to the si -'gestion that Porto Rico might
be left to Spain and compensation got
ten elsewhere.
Regarding the Philippines the reply
was n'>t altogether satisfactory, but it
was of such a nature that there was
no longer any necessity for postponing
a decision on the main question.

Putting in the Long Days Sleeping
and Fignting Mosquitoes â Women
Who Are Cheerful Even
in Their Misery.
ST. MICHAEL, ISLAND, Alaska, July
22. â For a month or two at least this
place bids fair to rival San Francisco
in the amount of shipping in the har
bor. Every day a craft of some kind
is added to the fleet already here, and
each brings news of more to follow.
The loss of so many river boats which
were being towed up has caused much
inconvenience to passengers bound for
Dawson and Intermediate points. Pos
sibly a stronger term would be more
applicable, as many persons have ar
rived here who have paid out about
all the money they had for their trans
portation, and now find that the river
boat which their ocean vessel was to
connect with has foundered, and to an
extent they are stranded on very in
hospitable shores. In many cases the
companies who booked them in San
Francisco or Seattle did so at a figury
so low that it is impossible to get other
river steamers (of which there are
plenty) to take them off their hands,
unless either the passengers themselves
or those that brought them will sustain
the difference in price charged from
here.
Some who bought tickets only to St.
Michael on vessels that have missed their
connections rather congratulate them
selves, as they now can take their choice
from the river fleet. The captain of pome
of the ocean vessels have had serious
thought of changing their business and
returning to a life of seclusion. They
find that coming to St. Michael is too
much of a strain on their nerves.
In several cases passengers have abso
lutely refused to leave the vessels that
brought them until they were assured of
a way of getting up the river. In this
they are sustained by the military com
mander here, who refuses to permit shiji*
Jng rompanies to forcibly put j
ashore without providing a way for them
to leave the island.
There are vessels here which have been
holding large numbers of passengers for
two weeks or over, and the deadlock still
continues. The steamer Dirigo was the
last to fall into distress, aa her passen
ger* were booked for the James Eva,
which was lost while in tow of the Na
tional City.
The steamer Humbbldt, whose river
connections were the Gamecock and Stag
hound, which vessels were lost while be
ing towed out of Portland by the Bllhu
Thompson â arrived with a large number
of passengers booked at "cut rates" and
had about the usual trouble in getting
rid of them. The tactful captain, how
ever, by coaxing some, cajoling others,
ana by perhaps using strong language to
still others, such as threatening to take
them back to San Francisco minus bag
gage, which had all been placed on a
barge, managed a few minutes before the
steamer started to get the last one off.
Some spread their tents <>n the shore and
resigned themselves to wait for the arri
val of the river boat that had been sub
stituted by the charterer of the Humboldt
to take them to the end of their voyage;
others, of whom several were ladies,
found shelter on the barge on which the
freight and baggage of the Humboldt had
been discharged. Here trunks and boxes
were utilized as beds and those that had
covering managed between mosquito bites
to forget themselves occasionally in sleep.
I went on the barge yesterday and saw
the huddied-up mass of humanity. Un
comfortable they were, bui not one was
discouraged. Every heart beat high with
hope. Each and all an- certain Of return
ing after a brief sojourn, in the frozen
land with at least a competence, if not a
large fortune.
A gently nurtured lady, whose former
occupation had been school teaching,
showed me where she had passed the
night before. A large, flat-topped trunk
formed the bed and her waterproof cloak
the covering. She assured me with gr.-at
earnestness that she did not mind it in
the least. "You know," she explained,
"I came to rough it, and I should be dis
appointed were I not to find the opportun
ity of doing so. Then, after all, it is
not so very bad. It is always day time;
you lie in one position until tired, then get
up and walk about, and then try a new
one."
All this time the rain falls continuously,
and at intervals the wind comes with
such force that vessels cannot discharge
cargo. The sun at this time sets about
10 p. m. and rises again at 2:30 a. m., and
one can read the finest print in the in
terval. Of the waiting multitude; here
who have no particular occupation aside
from berating the transportation compa
nies, probably as many sleep during- the
day as in the nieht. Indeed, it is only
by consulting a watch that we know
when night comes, as we seldom see the
sun.
Down on the beach, between the build
ings of the two old companies, is a lung
line of tents occupied by prospective
Klondikers, who are dubbed by the old
residents as "beachcombers." In some of
these the first lessons in cookery are be
ing taken, and the "Klondike stove,"
which seems to have been invented to try
the souls of men, receives the amount of
profanity to which it is justly entitled.
Wet driftwood, which is the only fuel
obtainable, stands sponsor for soggy
bread and half-cooked beans; but here,
as in other places, hopefulness and good
spirits are the general rule.
A very charming woman who has come
to meet her brother ancl accompany him
to the mines, tells me she is really en
joying the experience. "It is so different
from anything I have ever seen before,
you know," she said. As I saw her stoops
ing to the ground trying to coax the fire
to burn with wet kindling and a cloud
SAMPSON NETTLED
OVER EXPRESSIONS
CHARGED TO SCHLEY
Secretary Long's Inquiry Shows
the Commodore to Have
Been Misrepresented.
"WASHINGTON, 'Aug. 7.â Secretary
Long to-day requested the publication
of the following correspondence:
UNITED STATES FLAGSHIP NEW
YORK (first rate), GUANTANAMO BAY,
CUBA, July 27, IS9Sâ My Dear Mr. Secre
tary: I am led to write at this time on
account of the publication of an article
which appeared in the papers of the 19th
instant in which Commodore Schley is
made to say that he had stated to the
writer that he had over and over again
declared it was possible to enter the har
bor of Santiago, notwithstanding the
mines. Commodore Schley called upon
me and voluntarily stated that the publi
cation of the article was false in every
particular; that he not only never stated
anything of the kind, but that he had
never thought of it; that he had always
entirely agreed with me on this ques
tion, and that he did not know a single
officer whose opinion differed from mine.
A,s I have reason to believe that Commo
dore Schley has been misrepresented, I
have taken the liberty to address to you
a telegram upon this subject this morn
ing; and ii s I am about to sail for the
East I trust that it will receive your at
tention at an early date. Very respect
fully, W. T. SAMPSON, Rear Admiral,
United States Navy, Commander-in-Chief
North Atlantic Station.
The Secretary of the Navy, Washing-
ton.
The telegram referred to is as fol

PLATA DEL ESTE, (via Hasrti), July 27,

called upon to name the source and au

At h one of the camps where a .river
steamer is being constructed a number
of men were unloading a cargo of mer

loaded I approached her with some
trepidation, as 1 saw that her hand un
accustomed to such labor, was bleeding
in several Places from punctures from
the sack needle; but she smiled cheer
fully and expressed regret that bhe could
not offer me a seat. .When I inquired if
she did not find coming to Alaska a lit

she replied emphatically: v ' v un le t a !

A srentloman named Hall irorn Hum
boldf County told. me that his business
there had " been contracting and that
things had gone so badly with him that
be could not make enough to feed his
horses nnd keep his family. He therefore
sold out and went to Dawson seventeen
months ago. In less than a month after
SÂ° arrival he struck the claim he now
owns and for which he has been offered
$50 000, which offer he did not entertain
for a moment, as the development he has
made shows it to have far greater value
Over at Fort Get There the hotel of the
North American Company is doing a rush

without his troubles Some of the rooms
have been fitted as. dormitories, with,dou
ble-decked beds, and hold from nine to
twelve persons. Each occupant pays $1
per night. Some of those hives are re
served exclusively for ladies. These are
numerous in St. Michael just now, and
about rising and retiring time the rooms
are a scene of activity. As there is but
one wash basin it is not strange that tne
manager is frequently called upon to re
store peace. . â  ;'.; '. -, â 'â â 
The postofllce is a source of much dis
satisfaction to the thousands of people
who are in and about St. Michael. A
steamer belonging to the company that
has the contract from the Government to
carry mail for the summer arrived the
other day with eleven tons on board.
There are but two clerks to handle this
enormous mass, and to stand In line four
or five hours and then have thÂ» window
shut In your face, as the bell announces
the lunch hour, is a dally occurrence.. No
mail is delivered except to the owner In
person, and outside companies here who
have from forty to one hundred men in
their employ, all anxious to hear from
their homes, find it a very, serious loss to
them to permit each man to spend from
half to a whole day off to obtain his mail.
Kverv steamer coming In brings from ten
to fifteen sacks of mall, and the condi
tions were bad enough before this ava
lanche of regular mail arrived. When the
war closes ft is to be hoped that Uncle
Sam will turn some of his attention to
this portion' of possessions.

the Associated Press:
NAVY DEPARTMENT, Washington,
D. C, July 2*.â Sir: The New York
Times and Herald of the 19th inst. pub
lished an Associated Press dispatch in
which certain opinions regarding mines
are attributed to Commodore Schley. This
dispatch is written in such a manner as
to convey the impression that It was re
ceived from your representative with the
squadron off Santiago, and consequently
had been censored by proper naval au
thority. I therefore have to request that
you inform this department at your ear
liest convenience the authority for the
dispatch, to which reference is made.
Very respectfully. JOHN D. LONG.
Secretary.
Mr. C. A. Boyn'nn, General Southern
Manager the Associated Press, Washing
ton. -
The reply of the Associated Press is
as follows:
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1.â Hon. John D.
Iiong, Secretary of the Navyâ Sir: Your
favor of July 28 is at hand concerning ar
ticles published in the New York Times
and the New York Herald of the 19th
inst., in which certain opinions in regard
to mines are attributed to Commodore
Schley. This letter was not written by
either of our representatives with the
squadron off Santiago, but by another
gentleman who was temporarily on one
of your dispatch boats. The dispatch
was not subject to censorship. Our Mr.
Graham, who has been constantly with
Commodore Schley since his .squadron as
sembled at Hampton Roads, and is prob
ably more familiar with his views than
any new.spauer man at Santiago, takes
issue with the gentleman who wrote the
letter referred to, and says that Commo
dore Schley was always in complete ac
cord with Admiral Sampson as to the
question of entering the harbor. He
quotes Commodore Schley as saying:
"Admiral Sampson and I have always
agreed that it would be foolish to enter
the harbor with the mines in place, and
the condition of the mines proved that
Admiral Sampson was correct." Very
respectfully,
CHARLES A. BOYNTON.

JUDGES AWARD THE
RACE TO M'DUFFEE
. PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 7.â The 25-mile
paced race between Eddie McDuffee and
Jimmy Michael, which was ridden yester
day at Willow Grove track, was to-night
awarded to McDuffee by Referee Uhler.
Michael led the first twenty miles, but
the referee withheld his decision, Mc-
Duffee's manager having lodged a. protest
at the end of the third mile that Michael
had more pacemakers than were specified
in the contract. The contract called for
thirty-two pacemakers to a side, and after
an investigation it was found that
Michael had thirty-nine. Under these cir
cumstances McDuffee was given the race.

MEN WHO
NEED HELP!
The great men of the world need no help.
They are healthy. They are strong. They
have power. Those who need help dre those
who have weaknesses. Men who are full
of confidence know their strength. They
feel it in the vitality with which their sys-
tems tingle. They sleep well. They do
everything well. Vigorous as all men should
be, they have no fear and no dread of any-
thing. But there is life to be had for those
who are weak. Sensible treatment will
make a man Qut of a weakling. Sensible
treatment is the replacing of â
lost or depleted vitality. That Anil
is done by "Hudyan." "Hud- \(\\]
yan" could not accomplish 'â 
wonders were it not Nature's UN El
own remedy. But that is Just mi^ m^^ mm
what it is. It supplies the wasted tissue
with fresh life. It invigorates. It brings
sweet sleep. It makes nervous men full of
fire. It makes life a pleasure where it was
once misery. "Hudyan" is a life-giver.
Ask what that great array of 20,000 men
have said about it. No cent of expense to
you. Not one postage stamp even. Write
and ask for free medical advice, and if you
have a case of blood poison (t is given
quite as freely as if you were only weak.
It is only from the big Hudsonian Institute
that you can get "Hudyan."

TO IMPROVE THE
SANITARY CONDITIONS
CH7CKAMAUGA, Ga... Aug. 7.â The
improvement of the sanitary condition
of the regimental camps is the one ab
; sorbing matter at the park now. Defl
i nite plans wiil have been formulated
within a clay or two, after which the
management of the camp will be under
new and very rigid regulations as re
gards the disposition of garbage and
refuse matter and the preparation and
; serving of food. All drinking water
i will be boiled, and this regulation is
i one which will not in future be deviated
j from. Another condition it is hoped to
! bring about as early as possible is that
: of having the tents of all the men pro
: vided with board llovi's.
With the still further purpose of add
ing to the health conditions, practice
i marches are being arranged for. On
Ihursday of this week the engineer of
ficers of all the divisions will go out to
those marches, and the regiments will
locate the most practical routes for
; be sent put later by brigades in heavy
marching order for a four-days' ab
j senee from the park. The march will
cover about sixty miles going and rnm
inp, and the men will occupy Bhelter
â¢ tents at night. Numerous furloughs
are being granted convalescents, in ac
cordance with the recent order to allow
: patients recovering from serious illness
i thirty days' furlough ar.d transporta
tion homo.

THE STEAMER GUSSIE
Little Side-Wheel Filibuster Seen on

I Of the steamer Guissie was seen en the

boxes were about all that was visible.
The Gussie is a small side-wheel
steamer, and has been used for several
expeditions to Cuba. She left Key West
for Santiago on July 23 and arrived on
; July 27. Quartermaster Humphries at
Santiago was cabled several days ago
from Washington for news as to her
â whereabouts. He replied that she was
not in Santiago.
WASHINGTON, Aug. Adjutant Gen
1 eral Corbin said to-night that, while no ,
definite information had been received by '
â â  the War Department concerning; the !

nance stores for the army of invasion
Dispatches about transports from both
General Shafter and General Miles were
received 1 to-day, and as no reference la j
'â  made to the Gussie, it is taken for grant-
I ed that she is carrying out the programme

NAVAL CHANGES TO BE
MADE WHEN WAR ENDS
Dewey to Be Betained at the Asiatic

Other Commanders Uncertain.
NEW YORK, Aug. 7.â A Washlnsr
to special to the Herald says: Secre
tary Long has announced that as soon
j as the war is ended all old stations will
be reformed. Rear Admiral Dewey will
, remain in command of the Asiatic
1 Equadron because of his acquaintance
! with the Philippine problem and his
general ability. Commodore Howell.
who was brought home from the Eu
ropean station, may. return there as
comrr.ander-in-chief of a strong force.
This leaves Rear Admiral Sampson,
Commodore Watson and Commodore
Schley to be provided for.
Rear Admiral Sampson will undoubt
edl- be kept ailoat. either in command
of the Northern or European station,
and command of the Pacific station will
go to either Commodore Watson or
: Commodore Schley, with the chances
greatly in the former's favor. Com

house Board.
GOOD BLOCKADE WORK
OF THE TUG HUDSON
Sinks One Little Spanish Sloop and
Captures Another Off Car
denas.
KEY WEST, Aug. 7.â The tug Hud
i son, which has been with the ITncas on
the north coast blockade, sank a little
Spanish sloop a few nights ago and
captured another one off Cardenas yes
terday. The captured sloop was the
: Christina, and was loaded with fish, a
quantity of which was served up for
i breakfast by the Hudson's men, who
had been out for a month and had little
â  left in the way of provisions. Three
Spaniards were on the Christina, but
j put off in their tender when they saw
j the Hudson approaching, and gained
a key just off shore.
The converted yacht Oneida also
' came from the blockade to-day. She
| reports that day before yesterday a
â¢ body of opanish infantry fired about
i thirty rifle-shots at her from a point on
the beach r everal mil^s east of Morro
I Castle. The gunboat did not return the
j fire.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY,
REA'S MINIONS
WELL COACHED
Determined to Carry the
Primaries.
STUFFING TO BE ATTEMPTED
"BOSS" CONTROLS ELECTION
OFFICEKS.
Honest Republicans of Santa Clara
County Need to Be Alert at
the Polls on Wednes
day. <
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 7.â A1l Is bustle in
the Rea camp these days and active
preparations are under way to capture
the primaries next Wednesday. The
"boes" has given his lieutenants ex
plicit instructions, and if necessary
they will attempt to stuff the ballot
boxes to carry the day. The First and
Fourth wards of this city will be the
battle-ground, and It is there the Rea
forces are hard at work.
The election officers appointed for the
polls in this city are all Rea men. This
will give the gang an unequal advan
tage over the better element of the peo
ple, but the latter, aided by the Good
Government Club, are determined to
overcome the obstacles placed In their
way. If necessary force will be used
to insure a fair election.
The following list of election officers,
appointed at "Boss" Rea's dictat'on,
! shows how the gang has captured the
! election booths:
First Ward â Judge, Henry Welch; In
1 speetor, Bert Fattens. Welch has a
daughter In the schools and is ready to
do the gang's bidding.
Second Wardâ Judge. George W. I-.ee;
inspector, P. C. Jacobs. Lee was Jani
tor of a school at one time and has the
' promise of another janitorahip.
Third Wardâ Judge, William Dreisich
meyer; inspector, G. A. Clark.
Fourth Ward â Judge, J. I. Bradley; ln
; speetor, Joseph F. \ Illar. Llradley is
i finance clerk to the Board of Supervisors
i and Villar the manager of the California
Club, where all political schemes are
i hatched.
From this list It will be seen that un
less the good citizens turn out on the
day of the -rimaries and take off their
! coats the gang will have things it? own
way. It is in the First and Fourth
: that the election will be hottest. An
attempt will be made to steal these two
wards. The Democratic members of the
I gang have been told to turn out and
â  vote and all sorts of promises have
\ been made to ~Â°t the independent and
i well-meaning Republicans into line. So
j sure Is Rea of being able to control
I this territory that he had the number
of delegates in each of these wards in
creased. By getting these wards It is
' proposed to offset the opposition that
! has arisen to the boss at Santa Clara
1 and other suburbs. There are 165 dele
1 gates in the county convention, and
I with the First and Fourth wards solid
I Rea will have twenty-four delegates to
start with. Of the 165 vites in th<? con
vention 107 are from outside precincts.
The gang figures on getting the sixty
five in the city and enough from the
i outside districts to give a majority.
Outside of the city the fight will be
a hard one. The Good Government
Club has organized every precinct and
the members will make h gallant nerht
to +T-~a the Republican party from cor
ruption and boss rule. To offset thf>
good influences aroused by the < â aniz
ation the county 1 funds are beln" usÂ«<l.
Roads are being built, bridges con
structed and all sorts of count- work
I bel. done by the different Supervisors,
and those who arc opposed to Rea and
his methods are being sought and given
employment. By this means it is pro
i posed to reconcile the dissenters and
' get them into line to vote.
DR. M'LAREN REPLIES
TO THE GANG'S THREATS
RAN JOSE, Aug. 7.â Rev. Dr. Mo- j
Laren of the Second Presbyterian
Church takes an active interest in mu
nicipal affairs. About a month ago
from his pulpit he made charges of im
morality against members of the fac
ulty of the High School. Since then
Boss Rea, Principal Shumate of the
High School and others have been en
deavoring to silence him. In this they
have been unsuccessful, and as a last
resort have threatened to have the
| young lady teachers belonging to his
church dismissed from the School De
partment. Rev. Mr. McLaren touched
upon this in his sermon this morning.
I There was a large congregation present
and Intense interest prevailed during :
the remarks. At the close there was a
loud "amen" all over the church. He
said in part:
Let us consider tne strange and alarm
ing condition in our city. Our beautiful
High School building, where we expected
our children to be educated, surrounded
by the most ennobling influences, is ap
proaching completion, "but the young peo
ple for whom it was erected are turning
away and refusing to enter it. I have met
many of them and heard them give their
reasons for the stand they have taken
and 1 know that they feel as strongly as
ever heroes did in battle that they are
standing for a great principle, and par
ents will assume a grave responsibility
if they compel them to violate their con
victions. I have examined this matter
carefully and speak deliberately and with
earnest feeling. â¢
In 184S Louis Philippe, the King of the
French, awoke one morning In the Tull
leries and heard shouts and a great tu
mult in the streets of Paris. He said to
his Prime Minister:
"There seems to be a riot In the city."
And the reply was: "Ho, sire, It is not
a riot; it is a revolution."
A few minutes later the King was hur
rying out of Paris In peril of his life, and
the Orleans dynasty was ended.
There are a few people In San Jo?" who '
affect to sneer at the action of the young '
men and women of our High Schooi its a
riot due to a restless spirit and a senti
mental love for a teacher who has been
removed. But this is not a riot nor a
reckless burst of feeling; It is a "revolu
tion."
The principle for which these young
people stand lies in the fact that there is
a part of the faculty of the High School
for which they have lost all respect. Pro
fessor Smith was removed from his posi
tion, and newspapers under the influence
of his enemies have hurled columns of
abuse upon him. His pupils caerlsfa for
him the most profound respect. They
indignantly resent the treatment 1 he has
received. This has determined the time
and manner of this revolution, but it is
not the cause of it, and they will never
voluntarily return to the school until this
hateful condition Is removed. -
The character of the disgraceful state
of affairs Is, as I said In a former dis
course, common fame all over our city.
The existence of this common fame needs
no proofâ it proves Itself. Go almost any
where and you can hear it. In person find
by letter I have received countless . ex
pressions of approval and pledges of sup
port in the stand we have taken, some of
these even coming from persons In close
official touch with the High School. From
other sources I ,have received warnings
and threatenings. A threat comes "that
unless we let this matter drop all the
young lady teachers in our church will
lose their : positions." This has an old
familiar sound. If .It ever silenced a
preacher, I predict it never ' will again.
The Spanish ptyle of warfare Is an abom
ination all over the worldâ slaughtering
defenseless women and proclaiming a great
victory; persecuting young lady teachers
Instead of fighting fairly in the open field
with men!
Another made the warning: "You can
not win. When you get through the gang
will be on top. and where will you be?
There is a fatal mistake here. Such a
warning has no terrors for a preacher of
righteousness. When Noah got through
preaching to his generation the deluge
came, and where were his enemies and
where was he? When Abraham got
through interceding for Sodom, the day
of its judgment came. When Christ got
through warning and weeping over Jeru
salem the day of its doom came. And
when the preachers of righteousness of
San Jose get through there will be no
corrupt gang on top.
Our prayer to God is that there may be
no judgment on our city, but rather a
triumph of glory and honor.

EAGER TO RACE FOR
THE AMERICA CUP
Royal Ulster Yacht Club Hopes That
Its Challenge Will Be
Accepted.
LONDON, Aug. 7.â Secretary H. C. Kel
ly of the Royai Ulster Yacht Club does
not expect an answer to the communica
tionÃ to the New York Yacht Club rela
tive to the arrangement for races for the
America cup mucn before the end of the

New York Yacb* Club must be summon
ed to discuss the matter, and -while he
earnestly hopes for nn acceptance he rec
ognizes that the New York Yacht Club
has difficulties to surmount, owing 1 to the
members being sc_uered on account of
the war with Spain and for other rea
sons.
Yesterday's cable dispatch was simply
a notification that iÂ»ie Royal Ulster Yacht
Club would do itself the honor to chal
lenge for the cup if agreeable to the New
York Yacht Club. All connected with the
challenge show the keenest int jrest. and
Mr. Kelly says they â¢will allow nothing
tiÂ» debar them from competing for the
coveted trophy, except a uefinite rt-funal
on the part of the New York Yacht Club.
There Is every disposition to meet the
wishes of the New York Yacht Club, and
In the event of the latter nndlng difficul
ties in arranging for a race in IS?9 owing
to possible disorganization. caused by the
Hispano-Ameriean war, the challengers
will ask that the matter be postponed for
a year, and that no other challenge bo
accepted. It eeemfi. however, from pre
liminary Inquiries as to whether a chal
lenge would be agreeable that one -would
be cordially welcomed, find Harland &
Wolff are preparing a building slip.
The delegation from the Royal Ulster
Yacht Club, which will sail for New York
on August 24. consists of Secretary H. C.

EX-EMPRESS
EUGENIE ILL
Her Condition Reported
Serious.
NEARING THE END OF LIFE
FOR YEARS AN EXILE FROM
HER NATIVE LAND.
Career of the Talented Woman Whose
Beauty and Mental Gifts Won
the Heart of the Third
Napoleon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Aug. 7.â Ex-Empress Eu
genic Is reported seriously ill.
Eugenic, ex-Empress of the French
and widow of Louis Napoleon, Is the
daughter of Dona Maria Kirkpatrick
of Closeburn, Dumfriesshire, Countess
Dowager de Montljo, whose father was
English Consul at Malaga at the per
iod of ?Â»Â«â - marriage with the Count de
Montijo, an officer in the Spanish army.
On the death of the Count de Montijo
his widow was left a fortune adequate
to the maintenance of the position of
herself and two daughters, one of
whom married the Duke of Alba and
Berwick.
For Eugenic, the Countess Teba, a
higher destiny was reserved. In 1851,
accompanied by her mother, Bhe naid
a long visit to Paris, where, at the
various entertainments given at the
Tuileries, she was distinguished by the
di~nity and elegance of her demeanor
and by her great personal beauty, of
the aristocratic English rather than
the Spanish style. Her mental gifts
were not less attractive.
Shortly after the opposition of a
higher northern power had put an end
to the idea of a union between Em
peror Napoleon 111 and the Princess
Carolawasa of Sweden he a^rlsed the
Council of Ministers of his intended
marriage with the daughter of the
Countess Montijo, a measure which ex
cited some disapproval among them
and even led to their temporary with
drawal from office. During the short
time that intervened between the an
nouncement of the approaching event
and Its realization Countess Teba and
her mother took up their abode in the
Palace d'Elysee. The marrlafe was
celebrated with much magnificence on
January 29. 1853, at Notre Dame, the
Empress then being in her twenty
third year. On March 16, 1856, she be
came the mother of an heir to the
house of Bonaparte.
Up to the outbreak of the -war be
tween France and Germany her life
was comparatively uneventful, being
passed chiefly in the ordinary routine
of state etiquette. When the war was
declared and Emperor Napoleon
took the field the Empress was ap
pointed regent (July 27, 1870). Imme
diately after the revolution in Paris,
on September 4, she hastily left the
Tuileries and escaped from France,
landing five days later at Ryde, in the
Isle of Wight, and shortly afterward
Joining the Prtnce Imperial at Hast
ings. Camden House, at Chiselhurst,
was subsequently selected as a resi
dence for the imperial exiles. In the
following year the Empress went to
Spain on a visit to her mother.
Emperor Napoleon 111 died at
Chiselhurst on January 9, 187, and in
1879 the Prince Imperial, who had ac
companied the English army in the
Zulu war, was killed. His body was
brought to England and buried at
Chiselhurst, and on the following year.
on the anniversary of her son's death,
the Empress went to Zululand to visit
the fatal spot. In 1881 she removed from
Camden House to the Farnborough
estate In Hampshire, close to the bor
ders of the County of Surrey.
DEATH OF COLONEL
JAMES 0. BROADHEAD
Was a Leading Democrat of Missouri
and Minister to Switzerland
Under Cleveland.
ST. T,OT*IS. Aug. 7.â Colonel James O.
Broadhead. Minister to Switzerland under
Cleveland, Is dead as the result of a dis
ease from which he has been wasting
nway for some time. He leaves a widow

head.
Colonel Broadhead. who was born in
Virginia, came to this State when 1G
years of age. Soon after becoming of age

the breaking out of the Civil War he did
much to preserve Missouri to the Union,
and in tho Rummer of 18C1 he was ap
pointed Provost Marshal of this depart
ment. In 3P95 ho became a member of the
law firm of Broadhead. Stayback & Heus
pler. Colonel Broadhead was elected to
Congress in 18S2. At the beginning of
President Cleveland's second term Mr.
Broadhead was appointed United State 3
Minister to Switzerland. Mr. Broadhead
was one of the leaders of the Democratic
party of the country for a number of
years, and at the National Democratic
Convention In 1888 he received a good
many votes for President, Including the
sixteen votes of Missouri.
OFFICIALS SEARCH FOR
EVIDENCE OF ARSON
Suspicious Circumstances Surround
ing the Saturday Conflagration
in Sausalito.
SAUSALITO. Aug. 7.â The town author
ities and the insurance agents are mak
ing a thorough investigation of the cir
cumstances surrounding the flre which
destroyed much valuable property and
came near destroying the whole water
front yesterday morning.
George Ryan, A. Lawrence's bookkeep
er, was one of the first at the fire. He
saya it originated in some empty boxes
and barrels piled against the side of the
building, and the blaze wm bright enough
at the time to show the Interior of the
store unharmed. The fire might then have
been cxtingulsnod If water had been plen
tiful, a fact that shows the lamentable
situation should a lire start in the more
thickly populated portion of the town.
About a month ago Lawrence's store
was tilled with straw soaked in kerosene
oil and a lighted candle placed so that
the straw would ignite when the candle
bulled low. Bookkeeper Ryan's timely ar
rival prevented a conflagration. When
this occurred Lawrence, his wife and chil
dren were at a ball, held during tne Por
tuguese Pentecost.
Singularly enough, Lawrence went to
San Francisco on Friday evening and did
not return until the 3:Â» p. m. boat left
the metropolis yesterday. An attempt
was mude to burn him out previous to
the attempt of a month ago, and such
ugly rumors were circulated that the
Lancashire Fire insurance Company took
its risk off his property. He is said to
have been burned out once before while
carrying a heavy insurance. His insur
ance" in this Instance is admlltted by him
self to have been $5000 on a $70tw stock.
The circumstances of the case. In addi
tion to the death of Manuel Souza Bet
tencourte and the loss of so much prop
erty by others, have aroused the author
ities to diligent efforts toward discovering
whether or not arson has been commit
ted, and if so, who is to blame.

Will Surrender in Case
of Naval Attack.
OFFER TO REMOVE THE MINES
CUBAN REFUGEES PICKED UP
BY THE HUDSON.
Say Spanish Troops Have Been With
drawn From the City and Sent
to Havana and That People
Are Starving.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 7.â A Key West
special to the Herald says: No resist
ance will be offered by the Inhabitants
of Cardenas if an attack is made by the
United States navy. This assurance
has been sent Lieutenant Newcomb,
commanding the gunboat Hudson, on
blockade duty between Matanzas and
Cardenas, which arrived here to-day
with the Spanish sloop Christina in
tow. The residents of Cardenas, as an
earnest of their desire that Americans
I shall take possession, have even offered
j to send to the commander of the Hud
son the military expert who placed the
mines in the harbor whenever it is de
sired to remove them.
The Hudson last Friday morning,
i while steaming toward Cardenas, saw
j a Spanish gunboat going toward Cayo
Piedras. Catching sight of the Hudson,
the gunboat disappeared behind a point
of land. It was afterward ascertained
that when the gunboat was intercepted
she was making for Cayo Piedras light
house, which had been taken possession
of by four insurgents, who had hoisted
the Cuban flag over the light. When
these refugees were taken on board the
Hudson they gave the officers much
valuable information. They report
great distress at Cardenas. Provisions
are scarce, and what little food is there
is beyond the reach of any except the
wealthy. Many inhabitants are starv
ing. The Spanish troops have been
nearly all withdrawn from the city and
sent to Havana. Three thousand of
them which were left to protect Car
denas in the event of an invasion have
abandoned the port and gone to the in
terior to seek food.
REAR ADMIRAL NORTON

officers in command of navy yards in

miral Kirkland, who will take his place
on the retired list. It is believed among
naval officers that Captain Philip would

Yard, a great part of his life having
been spent on the Pacific Coast.

TFtfIDE CONDITIONS PROMISING.
â¢"T-^HERE was more steadiness to general trade
last week. It was probably the premonitory
* symptoms of the closing of the midsummer
-stagnation and the opening of the fall trade. The
bank clearings, which showed a loss during the pre
ceding week, again exhibited a gain, which, though
slight, being only 39 P er cent > was stiU better than a
loss. An unfavorable feature, however, was the in
creased number of cities and towns which showed a
decline in these clearings.
A significant feature was the increase in New York,
the percentage being 23.9 per cent. This may be due
to an improvement in the movement of general mer
chandise, or to more activity in the stock market.
It is probably the latter, for there is a marked re
vival in Wall street, both in stocks and bonds, though
the latter are preferred. The railway shares are show
ing more movement and the "grangers" sold very
well at the close of the week, indicating that the crop
prospects of the Great West are favorable and that
the trade conditions of the interior of the country are
promising. The new issue of bonds has been in keen
.demand for investment, and railway bonds have also
been moving of? well at hardening quotations. An
especially gratifying feature of Wall street during the
week was the general indifference with which the be
ginning of goid importations from Europe was re
garded, as there is such a plethora of money in New-
York that the import of a few millions more or less
c;:;~ but little figure. The fact is, the United States
has more gold coin than it knows what to do with.
All of which is gratifying to the average American
"citizen. As for Wall street, it is more interested in
the size of the corn crop than the imports of gold
f'om Europe.
The grain situation was rather better last week.
Although close observers estimate the American
â wheat crop this year at 700,000.000 bushels, the farm
ers are holding back their stocks to some extent, and
this, coupled with smaller deliveries to distributing
points, put the market up 22 J/2J /2 cents. The exports
from Atlantic ports were larger again, being 3,641,
000 bushels, against 2.530.000 for the same week in
1897. The wool market is exhibiting rather more
animation, especially in the choicer grades, though
some manufacturers, here and there, are closing down
rather than pay the prices asked for wool. The de
mand for staple cotton is reported better, but quota
tions for manufactured goods show no improvement
owing to the large present production. The iron
tiade is rapidly working around into prime shape
again, and manufacture is once more about up to its
full volume of output. Plates are reported in unpre
cedented demand, both East and West, and the struc
tural works are running full time with heavy orders
coming in from all directions. Prices are naturally
firm under these conditions, and manufacturers are
exacting full figures.
The country's failures last week numbered 196,
against 237 for the same week last year. The dis-
tributive trade in staple goods shows an Increase,
notably in the West, Northwest and Southwest,
owing largely to the fine crop prospects. The general
tendency in prices is upward, the record of the week
being an advance in 32, or about one-third of all
. istaples; a decline in 27, and unchanged quotations in
44. Nothing is now heard of the war as a trade fac
tor, and it has apparently passed into the limbo of
'back numbers.
The local situation is not behind the West in firm
.ness of values. Farm products as a rule showed a
general appreciation last week. There was a slight re
covery in wheat, the long slow decline being at last
varied by a fractional advance, which may be the pre
cursor of still better prices. Barley and corn also
improved somewhat, and hay kept up fairly, in spite
of very heavy arrivals. Canning fruits, such as
pears, peaches and apricots, were strong, and pears
ro=o to $45 per ton. though excessive receipts weak
the market somewhat toward the close. In dried
fruits the feeling was particularly stiff, advances being
-noted in apricots and prunes, both of which were in
brisk demand for future delivery. Wool, hides and
hops were unchanged and quiet. Hogs declined, as
the local packers could not pay the quotations and
come out even on the packed product. Provisions
ruled dull. Dairy products all advanced, and sup
plies were rather under the requirements of the mar
ket. Flour was marked down 25 cents per barrel in
sympathy with the recent decline in wheat, which,
However, immediately began to improve after flour
had been reduced. Canned fruits were qu/fted firm
and in brisk demand, both for domestic and forfeign
account. iThe output will be smaller than usual this
yc-nr owing to the light fruit crop, and every case
pricked will probably find a market at good prices.
The wholesalers reported a good business on the
whole, with few fluctuations in any line. The money
market was undisturbed, there being plenty of
available funds for solvent borrowers at the usual
rates of interest.
It is to be hoped that England and Russia can get
enough fun out of our war without starting a fracas
' of their own.
FOR GOOD LEGISLATION.
PRELIMINARY steps have been taken by the
Manufacturers' Association to reorganize the
Council of Associated Industries for the purpose
of using its influence to promote good legislation for
the general welfare at the coming session of the Leg
islature. It is to be hoped the movement thus started
will be carried briskly forward. There is much that
should be done at Sacramento during the coming
winter, and it is none too early to begin preparations
for it. ,
The Council of Associated Industries is designed
to include representatives of all influential organiza
tions of trade, commerce and industry in the State,
and will be therefore well fitted to devise and support
measures calculated to advance the larger interests
of the people. It can in this way render effectual ser
vice to the commonwealth and demonstrate anew
the advantage that accrues to a community when its
more intelligent, more enterprising and more public
spirited men work together for a common object in
stead of relying upon individual and separate efforts.
The full programme of legislation fo be sought for
from the Legislature has of course not yet been
marked out. That cannot be done until the pro
posed council has had time to consider all the con
ditions of the State and discover what evils exist and
what remedies should be applied. It is fairly certain,
however, that the pure food question will be taken
up, and also the issues involved in the problems of
providing for highway improvement and the better
protection of white labor from the ruinous compe
tition of coolie workers.
These matters have been so long under discussion
they are well understood, and there is a general
agreement among intelligent, progressive men con
cerning them. It should not be difficult, therefore,
to provide some means of solving the problems re
lating to them. With respect to the pure food law,
indeed, it is questionable whether any really adequate
legislation on the subject can be provided by the
State. Until Congress makes a law covering the
whole Union and thÂ« whole subject it is not likely
that we shall ever be free from the sale of impure
foods. Nevertheless it is worth while for the State
to do what it can, and any well devised measure di
rected to the end of preventing food adulteration
will be generally supported.
It would be well for the proposed council to give
its attention also to the subject of forest preservation.
The fires that have swept the woods and the ranches
of the State since the beginning of the dry season,
and that are even now raging in some localities, have
given us impressive object lessons in the value and
need of such protection. What has been lost by such
fires within the last month would alone more than
defray the cost of protection for a whole year. The
issue is one of pressing importance, and some steps
should be taken to provide a remedy at the coming
Legislature.
The council, it goes without saying, will find plenty
to do when it begins its proposed work. The only
danger is that in the multitude of things before it
so many may be undertaken that 'the efforts of the
council will be scattered and weakened. This of
course must be guarded against. If a few measures
of great importance are taken up and all the energies
of the industrial associations are directed solely to
procuring their enactment, much good will be
surely accomplished for the people and for the com
monwealth.
A NEW MARVEL OF SCIENCE.
Q CCORDING to the reports of the proceedings
nof a recent meeting of the Royal Academy of
Science in England, a certain Dr. W. J. Rus
sell is said to have exhibited and successfully oper
ated a working model of a new camera which enables
photographs to be taken in the dark, not a glim
mer of light being necessary for acquiring a good
negative.
Photography without light is of course a contra
diction of terms, and probably when the new art is
fully explained it will be found that the process by
which the negative is taken is something altogether
different from that which we know as photography.
In the meantime we must accept the name as it
comes to us and discuss the scientific marvel under
that title. If the claims made for it be well founded
it promises to be one of the most interesting
achievements of the year.
The whole history of the development of pho
tography has been a striking illustration of the prov
erb, "It is always the unexpected that happens." For
a long time past investigators have been seeking to
discover a means of photographing colors, and at any
time within the last twenty years experts in the art
would have been willing to predict that the next
notable photographic advance would be that accom
plishment. Up to this time, however, color pho
tography remains impracticable, while a host of im
provements have been made along lines utterly un
expected and unforeseen.
The public has hardly yet recovered from the
startling sensation caused by the discovery of a means
of photographing the bones within the body of a
living man. Photography in the dark promises to be
even more startling. At first thought it will seem
something of a menace to society. Mrs. Grundy can
put aside with scorn the X ray instrument, for she
cares very little about bones, but what will she say
to a camera that enables pictures to be taken of all
that goes on in the dark corners of summer resorts?
The idea of a photographic instrument capable of
taking perfect negatives in the dark, so that the
operator does not have to disclose his presence by
any flash or spark of light, is one that will lend itself
readily to the uses of the romance writer. On that
theme there can be written as many stones as are
contained in the Thousand and One Nights of the
Arabian entertainments. Fortunately, however, the
matter is likely to be one of romance purely. While
full particulars of the invention have not come to us,
it is self-evident that a negative taken by exposure
in the dark must require hours of time, and that snap
shot pictures with such a camera will be impossible.
In fact the new invention, like the instrument em
played in the use of the X ray, will probably be of
advantage for scientific purposes only. Under any
circumstances, however, the invention will be of no
small value in many ways, and it is to be hoped the
report that comes to us has not exaggerated the de
gree of success said to have been attained by the
working model.
In settling the problem of the Philippines W. H.
Mills seems inclined to think that he would be a po
tent factor. And if the matter is to be adjudicated
through conversation alone, perhaps he is right.
Admiral Cervera has again proved his courage. He
says he will go to Spain at the end of the war. and he
n:ust know there is no telling what may happen to
him there.
People whom Hooley has charged with crooked
ness seem inclined to retort, "You're another."
Which is probably not far from correct.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 8, 1898.
FLYING FROM THE F'E-D.
rROM New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio
come reports that the Democrats of those States
will make the campaign this fall on State is
: sues only. All signs point to the conclusion that in
| California similar tactics will be followed. Of the
i greater States of the Union Illinois seems to be the
only one where the Democratic party will go into the
i field carrying the banner of Bryanism and the Chi
i cago platform, and even there the determination of the
party to stand by its guns is due not so much to
the courage of the rank and file as to the indomitable
will of Altgeld, who, with the fatalism of a Napoleon
returning from Elba, has forced his followers and
votaries into line for a Waterloo campaign.
This total abandonment of the field of national
politics by one of the great historic parties of the
country is one of the most striking features of the
political situation. It is an incident unique in our
records. Never before has there been among us a
party strong enough to form a national organization
that was too weak to make a national fight. It is a
final and convincing proof^of the complete demoral
ization of the opposition to the Republican policies
of protection and sound money, and gives assurance
to the business interests of the country that here
after they will no longer be harassed by the incessant
agitations that have been so disturbing in the past.
The occurrence of the collapse of Democracy in the
field of national politics at the same time with the
return of prosperity is more than a mere coincidence.
For years past Democracy has been a calamity party.
It has drifted so far from the traditions of its great
days when led by Jackson, and even from those of the
past generation under the leadership of Thurman,
Hendricks and Tilden, that at present there is no
place in its councils for wise statesmen, nor in its
ranks for conservative citizens. It has now become
a faction of discontent inflamed by agitators, and has
> found its way naturally and inevitably to the haven
j of Populism, where it oscillates between the extremes
of socialism and anarchy.
Under these circumstances It is not strange that
! any effort at contesting national politics with vic
torious Republicanism has been abandoned. Even
such leaders as those of the Maguire type no longer
have the courage to face the people on national is
sues and have turned their longing eyes to State
offices. In this crisis of the country, when all men
see that a new era has begun, when questions of for
eign policy are pressing for solution, when the
finances of the people are to be revised and reor
ganized, Democracy has no platform of principles or
of policies to advocate. Its leaders will seek for pre
ferment and salary in such offices as colonel of
volunteers, Governor of a State, or perhaps a County
Clerk, but they will not presume to discuss national
afiairs or to risk an appeal to the people on them.
It Is- not likely that the tactics adopted will be
found profitable. A flying foe never wins a victory.
The patriotic instinct? of the people are not to be
deceived. They are aware that in our system of gov
eri'ment the politics of State and nation are too
clcsely associated to be capable of arbitrary separa
tion. They know that any notable Democratic vic
tories in the States would be felt as a hampering in
fluence upon the Republican administration of the
nation. For that reason the people will vote on
local issues as on those of the country at large. The
opposition that has abandoned the open and larger
field will be driven from its hiding-place in the other.
BUYING FOOD ABROAD.
I p~NEPORTS from Washington are to the effect
L-/' that our troops in the Philippines will probably
*> be supplied with food from Australia. It is said
the chief of the commissary department of the army
has been negotiating with a London firm for the pur
i chase of beef and vegetables to be shipped from Aus
tralian ports, and that the prospects are the con
: tract will be awarded.
As the American people produce every year far
i more food than they can consume, and for a genera
tion or more past have been shipping both meats and
vegetables to other parts of the world, the proposed
' purchase of such supplies from Australia requires ex
planation. It is true that Australia is a good deal
nearer the Philippines than is California, but the dif
ference in the distance is not sufficient to account
for giving the contract for our army supplies to
foreigners. There is no menace of immediate famine
confronting the troops, and, other things being equal,
iit would be as easy to send the required beef and
vegetables from San Francisco as from Melbourne
I or Sydney.
It is possible that the explanation of the matter
is to be found in the lack of American shipping. We
may not have the merchant 6teamers ready for
prompt use in carrying the supplies. It is well known
that great difficulty was found in obtaining vessels
to transport the soldiers themselves, and that the
Government was compelled to grant American regis
try to a considerable number of foreign-built ships
I for that purpose. If this should prove to be the cause
that impels the War Department to seek supplies
from abroad instead of at home, another strong ar
gument will have been given why Congress should
take immediate steps to foster and promote our mer
chant marine.
In any case it will be admitted that the purchase
of food for. our troops at Manila from the
Australians instead of from the Pacific Coast
â is not creditable to us. The farmers of Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington have all kinds of
[ food products, to sell, and San Francisco has mer
', chants fully capable of the task of delivering them In
â¢ the Philippines. Tt is to be regretted, therefore, that
the commissary general has found It necessary to ne
i gotiate with a London firm for Australian food. The
instance is clearly one in which the Government
should patronize home industry.
There seems to be serious question 3S to the value
of the military balloon. If, as one officer affirms, it
merely served to show the enemy where to aim, the
conclusion is inevitable that the General Wheeler
method of climbing a tree is superior.
No sooner was the presence of the King of Dudes
in San Francisco announced than Oakland pro
claimed possession of the King of Hoboes. Per
haps this is not jealousy, but it has the look of it.
The plan of discouraging ballot-box stuffing at
San Jose will probably be construed by Jim Rea into
another of those direct affronts.

ers' and his own introspection have im
pressed upon him Implicit belief In his
own greatness; yet at times his Judg
ment errs and hia innate tact forsakes
him. A few weeks ago a volatile parrot
flitted from story to story in his hotel
and despite the combined efforts of an
army of bellboys, porters and clerks, it
was not captured. For a time this green
bedecked bird took to cover and some
thought that it had escaped and forever
disappeared from the sight of that small
.world confined to the four walls of the
hotel. But this was all a mistake. It was
in the late watches of the nightâ when
Cum was roused from an incipient sleep.
A shriek coming from the third story
seemed to drop into the court and churn
the atmosphere into withering bits.
The rest is told by Cum himself: "When
I came to I realized in a moment that
something had happened to some one way
up in the air. I rang every bell I could
that had a button in the office. I called
for every boy on duty. Six there were in
allâ night watchmen, boys and porters
and your honorable in command. I ex
plained the situation hurriedly to those
who did not hear that awful sound. Mur
der it might have been, suicide, robbery
or insanityâ not a drunk, for I know the
symptoms of that by a long and well
trained study of cases that have come
under my observation. Cautiously we
went up the stairs, myself in the lead.
The first story waa reached and we held
a consultation. It was decided not to be
too reckless. I then fell back and com
manded from the rear. Another consulta
tion at the next landing and our plan
of campaign of offense was planned. With
a skin of cold sweat glistening on the
heads of my company we reached the
third floor and prepared for the battle.
We heard a low and pitiful moan and all
of us dropped on the floor to listenâ noise

was? The parrot. That devil we thought
had left us for good. It was caught in

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Four vessels will he added to the Ger
man navy during the present year. The
Gazelle, a cruiser of 2650 tons and 19%
knots speed, 1* ready for launching at
Krupp's yard, Kiel; Vlneta. a cruiser of
5650 tons and 20 knot*, will be launched
at Stettin during the present month, and
In December a gunboat of 594 tons Is to
be launched at Elhlng. The battle-ship
Kaiser Frlederlch 111 will be completed
early In October.
The British torpedo boat destroyer
Angler has passed through a twelve
hours' consumption trial. The boat was
drawing 6 feet 1 Inch forward and 6 feet
7% Inches aft, or 10 Inches less than nor
mal load draught, and with 184 pounds of
steam developed 4CO horsepower with 160
revolutions, making a speed of 13.15 knots,
and consumed 10,192 pounds of coal dur-
ing the twelve hours' run. The enormous
lncreose In power required to make high
speeds may be realized from the fact that
while It took only 490 horsepower to push
the boat along at 13.1 a knots, she will re
quire 5400 horsepower to go 30 knots.
Portugal Is rapidly acquiring a navy of
cruisers. The San Rafael Is the latest
addition, having been launched at Havre
July 5 from the same yards where a slb
ter ship, the San Oabrlel, whs launched
May 7. The two ships are sheathed and
of 1800 tons, with a speed of 15 knots. The
armament are all French guns of the
Canet type, and consists of two 5.fÂ»-inch,
four 4.7-lneh, eight 3-pounders and two
machine Runs. Portugal is navmg six
cruisers built, of which twojif 1021 tons
collectively at Lisbon, two of 4100 tons
each at Elswlck, and two of 1800 tons each
at Havre, in addition to which another
cruiser of 4100 tons Is proposed to be built
at Klswlck before the end of the present
year.
M. Liockroy Is again the Minister of
Marine of France, this being his second
term. As is customary in that country,
radical changes follow with the change
of Ministry, and It is to this fact that the
French navy 1b always In an experimental
stage. Mr. Lockroy has fixed notions
ahout the ships of war and believes
speed to be the chief element of success
In a battle. Admiral Fournier holds that
the entire fleÂ«t could be advantageously
replaced by a hundred lightly armored
but swift cruisers. The diversity of opin
ion by naval officers on the fundamental
requirements of ships is simply bewilder
ing, and so-culled lessons drawn from
battles are construed to meet with the
views of individual officers.
The Argentine armored cruiser Bau
Martlno having completed her trials at
Leghorn, Italy, where she was built, is
ready for delivery. On a two hours' forcea
draught trial the engine* worked up to
12,436 horsepower, giving a speed of 19.68
knots, slightly short of the contract
speed of 20 knots. The ship was down to
2<i feet 4'^ inches, or 7V4 inches less than
the normal mean draught. The San Mar
tino's battery consists of four 8-inch
breech-loaders in turrets only 4 Inches
thick; ten 6-inch quick-firers; six 4.7-inch;
twelve 6-pounders, and ten Maxim W - t
pounders. The armor extends all around
the ship, six feet below the water line
and three feet above, and Is barely six
inches thick. The protective deck is only
1.46 inches thick, and the upper gun deck
I.BS inches. The armor Is Harveyized and
was made in France. She. is almost an ex
act counterpart of the late Spanish cruis
er Cristobal Colon, and for the lack of
high speed and insufficient gun protec
tion ia not a desirable specimen of the
armored cruiser type to be followed by
other navies.
A signalman on board the Ganges at Dcv-
onport dockyard was court-martialed last
month for having stolen a signal book and
afterward deserted. 'He subsequently
surrendered, and when called upon to
make his defense submitted a written
statement confessing to the theft of the
signal book, which h.e professed to have
burned. The statement, which has made
the British admiralty very uneasyâ on
account of the person alleged to have
tempted the sailor to steal the book for a
large money considerationâ and its con
tents, has been kept very quiet. The book
was stolen at about the time when the
war between the United States and Spain
began. Some of the sensational British
journals have intimated that Lieutenant
Colwell, naval attache to the United
States Legation in London, has been a
party to the transaction, and the lieu
tenant has written to the admiralty re
futing the implied charge and requesting
that it take steps to suppress the false
reports in the newspapers. The signai
man was sentenced to eighteen months
imprisonment with hard labor and to be
dismissed from the service with dis
grace.

WHY WARSHIPS SHOULD BE
SHEATHED.
Dry Dock No. 3 at the Brooklyn Navy
Tnrd is at last reported fit for use and
our battle ships will at last be able to
dock and have their bottoms cleaned and
painted after a delay of more than one
year.
There are only three drydocks in this
country capable of admitting our large
battle ships, but only one â that at Port
Orchard â has been serviceable, while the
Port Royal dock appears to be somewhat
shaky, besides having insufficient depth
of water, and the Brooklyn duck has been
undergoing rebuilding since May last
year at a coat of nearly $170,000 to make it
ht for use.
Luck or Providence has favored our
navy during the present war, for a chance
shot from the enemy might have made
any one of our battle ships useless for
further service until the one dock, ruined
by criminal neglect of duty on the part
of Government officials, could be put In
condition to take in the disabled craft.
As it is, the ships have been in tropical
waters for months and the damage,
through pitting of the plates from corro
sion, is a serious matter, besides their
inability to move about with anywhere
near their calculated speed, notwithstand
ing the vast quantities of coal consumed.
The experiences gained through the
present war furnishes many lessons, not
ably to CongresÃ In both houses, some
members of which have hitherto opposed
recommendations of the Navy Depart
ment officials in the linos of Increased
efficiency of the navy. One of the most
Important recommendation? ignored has
been that of sheathing certain vessels
the great speeds of which depended
mainly upon the clean condition of their
bottoms. In ]S.s4 whÂ«>n the Increase of the
nnvy received serious attention from Con
gress it was recommended that some of
the new ships should be sheathed for pro
tectfon to the ships, as a measure of econ
omy in the use of coal and us necessary
to maintain tho speeds indefinitely.
Chandler, tlun Secretary of the Navy,
vigorously <>;. p. >*â¢â <! this recommendation,
claiming "that with our docking facilities
there was no need of sheathed ,v, v . ess , c . ls
and that "no holes would be bored in the
bottoms of the new ships by hi* orders,
except by direction of an act or ton
gress." At the tin..- this subject was so
summarily disposed of. Great Britain and
other navies had already a number of
sheathed ships afloat, notwithstanding the
doekiriK facilities they possessed all over
the world, and the naval powers have
gone on and "bored the bottoms of ships
full of _oles"-that is. sheathed thousands
of tons and thereby maintained the speed
>t the' ships and saved vast sums In coal
bills In I^9o an act was passed by Con
*r,ss which, in an equivocal way, per
mitted the sheathing of two new gun
boats but there was some doubt
In the mind of the Secretary as
o the meaning of said act. and
the gunboats were not sheathed.
It is only during the past two years,
fliromrh the persistent efforts of the pres
ent chief constructor that six composite
rnnboats of WÂ» tÂ°" s e;ich navo been built
and these constitute all the vessels we
have in' the navy which need n..t dock
twice or oftener yearly in order to keep
up their speed at a reasonable expend-
Chief Constructor Hichborn sub
mitted a report to the Navy Department
imon the importance and need of sheathed
â .hies He enumerated vessels of foreign
navies thus protected against fouling and
corrosion, and independent of docks cap
ible of cruising all over the world if nec
,'Jo n . and always competent to get up to
their original speeds The list was a long
'â hut since then the number has vastly
increased and It now appears to be the
fl*pd Dolicy of foreign naval powers to
Ethe i all vessels intended for foreign
Sftionl The following table shows the

Tn 1889 the armored fleet of Great Britain
numbered 76 ships of 576,300 tons of which
II "hips of 74.070 tons were sheathed, mak
ne a percentage of sheathed vessels of
i?i? ner cent. At the present time the ar
mored fleet consists of -93 shins of 8^.090
tons of which 15 of 141. - tons are
sheathed, * riving: a percentage of 16 per
cent and a tonnage increase in nine years
Â° Nine years ago the unarmored effective
vessels of Great Britain numbered 191 of
3250% tons, of which 22 vessels of 72.040
ton's were sheathed, or a percentage of 22.
The unarmored fleet now numbers 222
vessels of C 55.253 tons, and of these 69 of
347 920 tons, or 53 per cent, are sheathed.
It 'is evident that sheathing, notwith
standing its first cost, has found favor in
Great Britain and by other naval powers
who send squadrons abroad. Ships thus
protected against fouling and corrosion
are the best and cheapest in that they
economize fuel, maintain their speed and
require docking only at long intervals.! A3
for the cost, that varies, of course, in pro
portion to the size of ships, and in . the
large vessels of 11,000 tons does probably
not add more than 10 per cent to the cost
of an ordinary steel vessel. In the six
cruisers of the Graf ton class of 7350 tons,
not sheathed, the cost per ton of displace
ment was $147 for the hulls, while three
others of the same class which were
sheathed cost at the rate of $160 per ton.
These prices were those paid to the.con
tractors, and show 10.8 per cent increased
cost of the sheathed ships. . A fleet of
t!wenty-one cruisers was built in I*3o-92 of
S4OO â  tons. Of these ten were sheathed,
thereby Increasing their displacement ; to
3600, of which 200 tons was the weight of
the sheathing. The vessels which were
not sheathed averaged for the hulls Â»4i
I per ton of displacement, and th ,Â°2 I % t ;MlÂ£ >
were sheathed cost at the rate of Slo7 per
ton. or an Increased cost <>f 10 ', pe ,w ,>,Â«
The cost of repairs is practically tnÂ»
same for both classes of vessels, the an
i f.Ttnee being rather in favor of sheatnca
! ships, but the economy is experienced m
the engine and boiler room, where less
coal is consumed by at least 20 per ce nt
in the bottom-protected ships, whicn nas
a further advantage in not requiring *re
qupnt dockajre and thereby incurring tne
risk of straining the bull and getting tne
engines and shafts out of line. The ad
ditional cost is covered by the expense
which the unsheathed ship is put to twice
or oftener in a year by docking, cleaning
and painting, and the sheathed ship is al
ways rendy to steam at its original speed,
where the other, if unable to dock, may
not be able to cover more than two-thirds
of its intended speed. The squadrons of'
the United States and Germany hovering
about Manila are an example of the im
portance of sheathing. The German ships
Kaiserin Augusta. Kormoran and Arccrtia
are sheathed and thus limited to at the
most one docking yearly, while all of our
vespels, with unprotected bottoms must
dock at least three times durnig the samÂ©
period.

RED CROSS SOCIETYâ N. N.. City.
The Red Cross societies of the world are)
the organizations growing out of the In

red cross on a white field is the distinct
ive flag. By this badge are known all
hospitals, field or permanent, ambu
lances, persons, materials and appliances
employed In the relief service, and wher
ever the flag is displayed accompani*Â»d
by the national flag to which the hospital
etc., belongs, it is treated, respected and
protected as neutral. Under the treaty
soldier* disabled by wounds or sickness
who have fallen into the hands of tho
enemy and are incapable of bearing:
arms "must be delivered to the outoosts,
to be sent to their homes on condition of
not bearing arms again during the â war.
The Red Cross movement is civil in its
origin and the various organizations that
carry out the treaty are purely civil.
MONTE CARLOâ S. L. J., City of
Mexico. Mex. Monte Carlo is a small
town in the territory of Monaco, the
smallest of the sovereign principalities of
Europe. It has an area of 5% square
miles. It is on the coast of the Mediter
ranean, nine miles east of Nice, in tha
Alpes Maritimes, a department of France.
Monaco is the possession of the Prince
of Monaco, who is called "his Serene
Highness," and the territory is under
French protection. The Casino at Monte
Carlo, notorious for its gambling places,
is run by a joint stock company, having
a capital of 15.000,000 francs. None of tha
Inhabitants of Monaco have access to
the gambling tables, and their Interest hi
maintaining the status quo is secured
by complete exemption from taxation and
the large price paid for their lands.
Gambling tables were established at
Monte Carlo in 1556, but It was not until
1860 when M. Blanc, expelled from Horn
borg took possession of the place, that tt"
became notorious. The company that
runs the games at that place has a lease
until ISI3 It takes in about 6.000,000 francs
a year and it pays out about one and a
half millions for the maintenance of the
principality and its 4000 to 5000 annual vis
itor* The percentage in favor of the
bank is said to be about 75. The players
are from all parts of the world and from
all ranks of society. No nationality pre
dominates. Gamblers are, as a rule, very
superstitious, and there are many wlio
believe in mascots. One popular belief

play accidentally meets a hunchback and
touches his hump he will win at the

MAY NOMINATE
JUDGE MAGUIRE
He Declines to Discuss the
Merits of Democratic
Differences.
Says His Visit to This City Has No Connec
tion With the Disaffection in the
Ranks of His Party in
the State.
United States Senator Stephen M. TVhite I
arrived in the city yesterday from his
home In Los Angeles. The unexpected
news of his arrival caused considerable .
etir among local Democratic politicians, i
who gave eager ear to the rumor that he i
had been called to San Francisco for the
purpose of patching up the differences
that have caused a merry war ever since
McNab, Gould and Alford set themselves
up as the dictators of party affairs In this i
city and In the State.
To all of those who called on the Sena
tor at his apartments at the Palace Hotel j
with the request that they be taken into
his confidence concerning the plan for
bringing harmony out of chaos he had but
one answer: "I am here on bus-.ness that
has nothing to do with politics."
Notwithstanding his disinclination to
discuss the present situation as regards
Democratic politics, the Senator was
forced, somewhat against his will, to re
ceive the confidences of his Democratic
friends and to give some heed to their re
quest that he use his good offices to re
lieve the strain that seems to threaten the
disruption of the party. On account of
' the pressure thus brought to bear on him
he may consent to stay in the city several
days Instead of returning to Los Angeles
to-day, as was his original intention. He
would thus be given an opportunity tc
meet Congressman Maguire upon his ar
rival in this city to-morrow evening.
Should he consent to do this a conference
of Democratic leaders will probably be
held on Wednesday for the purpose of
harmonizing the differences that have
paused W. \V. Foote, M. F. Tarpey arid
such men as represent the best elements
In the partv to rebel against the high
handed methods of the McNab contingent.
asked yesterday to express hia
..views >n the political situation Senator
White declared that he was not sufficient
ly familiar with the condition of affairs
In h:s party In this .State to justify him in
giving an opinion as to what the outcome
of the campaign will be.
"I returned from Washington but a '
short time ago." he said, "and since my ;
arrival in the State my time and atten
tion has been so taken up with important
legal business that I have had no time
.to devote to political matters. My pres
.. ent visit to ban Francisco is due solely '
to the necessity for my presence here in
connection with some legal business of !
â¢Importance. 1 shall return to Los An
:' geles to-morrow morning or to-morrow :
afternoon at the latest. I wish to have :
It understood that my visit has nothing j
td'do with politics in any way."
Concerning the statement that he would
â¢ go to the State convention as the chair- i
man of the Los Angeles delegation and j
â would place Judge Maguire in nomination ;
Tor Governor, Senator White had this to
â ay :
"I do not even know whether or not f
I shall attend the convention, and there i
has certainly been nothing said to me
about mv being the chairman of the Los
Angeles delegation. It is my desire to
attend the convention and 1 shall cer
tainly do so if I can so arrange my prl
: va;p affairs as to make my presence in
S.aeramento possible.
"As to any understanding that I shall
place Judge Maguire In nomination for
Governor there Is none. If 1 am present;
at the convention I shall certainly give
myself the pleasure of saying something
In behalf of Maguire. Should I be se
lected tw make th* nominating speech I
Would he particularly gratified, as the
Judge and 1 have been friends from
â¢ childhood and 1 bave for him a very
high regard. No auch arrangements have
been maie. however, and, as I said be
fore. I do not even know whether I will
ittend the convention. I cer
tainly think that Maguire will receive
the. nomination, as there .ifems to be no
opposition to him, and I also think that
If he is nomnlated he will be elected. He
has made an enviable record in Con
gress and stands high In the estimation
of the people of California.
"< ' oTicernlng the present position of the
â Democratic party regarding fusion I must
beg to be excused from making any
statement, for the reason that I am not
familiar with all of the facts. As an
abstract proposition I still hold to the
Views publicly expressed by myself and
Others manv months ago. That is to
say. that I am in favor of the co-operation
of all forces favoring free silver. As to
the manner in which fusion was brought
about in this State or th" basis upon
v.-hleh i: was arranged I have nothing to
say bee â¢ use 1 am not familiar with the
facts. N-icher am I prepared to say
â whether 1 think It advisable for the Dem
ocratic party to nominate a straight Dem
ocratic ticket. As I have said, the present
Btatus of this matter ia not familiar to me
. and I am. therefore, not qualified to ex
press an opinion."
.. Senator White also confessed Ignorance
' as to the details of the sp.lt in the local
Democracy. He said that he knew there
was some dissatisfaction in the party in
this city, a condition of affairs that Is
duplicated in tho Democracy of Los An
geles County. He declared that he had
given tho matter no attention, neither
here nor at home, and had no Intention
of b<->!nkr forced into the position of ref
eree In disputes tnat appeared to be
merely local. He was also in ignorance,
he said, of any plans that may have been

made for the selection o' a chairman for

had been made he had not been taken
into the confidence of those who mao>
them, and he had not been asked if he
would accept the position if it were ten
dered to him. The uncertainty of his
ability to attend the convention, he said,
made the consideration of the subject at
this time worse than useless.
Concerning the annexation of the Ha
waiian Islands and the effect of such ac
tion on the future cf the country Senator
White was almost as non-committal as ne
was about Democratic politics.
"The stand taken by me on the Ha
waiian question." he said, "13 well known
to every one. I am not prepared to say
that there was not a majority of the
r. embers of Congress in favor of annexa
tion but I do think that it would have
been defeated had it not been for the sen
timent engendered by the conditions aris
ing from our present war with Spain.
What my future course will be I nm not
at this time prepared to say. The annex
ation of the islands Is an accomplished
factâ a fact that has established a prece
dent that must necessarily change thÂ«
entire foreign policy of this Government.
The question of the limits and extent of
this new policy Is one that should be
given the very' gravest thought, for on
It depends. In n great measure, our future
as a nation. The mere fact of the acqui
sition of the Hawaiian Islands would not
of itself be of very great Importance were
it not for the additional fact that their
acquisition establishes a precedent that
at once and for all time affects our
standing among the nations of the
wofld." Â«_________Â»___Â«.

SHANAHAN ACCEPTS THE NOMINATION
The Populist Candidate for Governor Opposes the
Fusion of His" Party With the Democrats.
T. W. H. Shanahan, the Populist candidate for Governor, has for
mally accepted the nomination of his party. In his letter of accept
ance he takes exception to the win? of the Populist party that fa
vors fusion with the Dr locrats. â¢ Hi 3 letter follows:
To D. T. Fowler, Chairman, and Carleton H. Johnson. Secretary, of
the State Convention of the People's Party of Californiaâ Gentlemen:
I desire through you as chairman and secretary of the State conven
tion of the People's party recently held at Saeremento to express to the
delegates constituting said convention and the People's party my appre
ciation of the honor which said convention has conferred upon me by
selecting me as Its nominee for Governor.
I am thoroughly In accord with the principles of the party as stated In
its platform, and I accept the nomination and the platform without reser
vation, and If elected as Governor will use all my energy to carry Into
effect the declarations of the party as therein enunciated.
The acts of my public life as a representative of the people are mat
ters of record, and I am glad that they are such as to have commended
me to the favorable consideration of the State convention of the People's
party.
When I joined the People's party I did so because its principles were In
harmony with my sense of what was necessary to establish justice. These
demands, if sturdily adhered to and contended for, will in my Judgment
be accepted within a reasonable time by a majority of the people of this
nation; but the principles for which we contend cannot be established as
the law of the land in any other manner than by maintaining the integ
rity of the party which declares for the same. This is a mateer so clear
In the light of party organization and political history that it needs no
further argument.
As the campaign progresses I will address the people at various places
throughout the State in support of the principles of the party and trust I
shall have the hearty co-operation of all who believe In the platform.
All experiences show that efforts of the members of a party to secure
office by fusion In advance of the reception of their principles by a major
ity of the voters is destructive to the existence of the party itself.
Some unusual circumstances surrounding the said State convention call
for brief notice at this time. It would have afforded me pleasure to have
supported any other person as the nominee of the party for Governor who
was an acknowledged member of the People's pa/ty. I cannot recognize
that any person was nominated in opposition to myself because no member
of another party could be properly or Justly placed in nomination or re
ceive votes in said convention.
The nomination in manner and form attempted to be made by the
fuslonists !s an insult to the People's party and an Insufferable attempted
imposition on the Democratic party, as, In effect, it declares that no mem
ber of the People's party is worthy of the nomination for Governor, and
that the Democratic party is too Incompetent or too venal to be trusted
making a nomination, even on a fusion basts, for that office. If the fuslon
ists of the late Sacramento convention prevail they will have accom
plished the unparalleled result of the nomination by a faction of pretended
members of a political party, of a candidate for Governor from without
the party, and of naming, without alternative, a candidate for Governor
for another political party opposed to the party with which such faction
pretended to affiliate.
The delegates who made the attempt to nominate a candidate for Gov
ernor from without the party violated their positive instructions in many
cases (notably twenty-six delegates from San Francisco), and their Im
plied duty in every Instance to nominate a People's party ticket under the
call for said convention.
Deeming ns I do that all efforts of such a nature were illegal and In
violation of the trust reposed In the delegates sent to nominate a People's
party ticket, I have no hesitation whatever in considering myself as the
unanimous nominee of the People's party for Governor of this State, for It
has never been contended that any political party Is bound by the actions
of its representatives who violate their trust by going outside of their
party to nominate political opponents.
Believing that the great cause which we represent, which may not be
â wholly carried In a single campaign, but which requires patience, labor
and faithfulness to our trust, must surely triumph if we are true to our
party, I ask of all the voters of the State a thorough examination of our
principles, as expressed in our platform, confident that, when so exam
ined and understood, they will be accepted and ratified by a majority.
I have the honor to remain, very sincerely your obedient servant,
August 6, IS9B.

MEET DEFEAT
Stocktons Outplayed by
the Local Team.
WARD TUMBLES TO HIMSELF
THE FRISCOS PRESENTED A
GREAT APPEARANCE.
The Game Was Beautifully Played
on One Side, While Errors Ga
lore Marked tne Work of
the Other.
BY JOE CORBETT.
The San Franciseos presented a very
able and competent appearance yesterday
afternoon and in consequence defeated
the tall-enders by a score of 5 to 1.
i A good crowd turned out to witness the
! game and were agreeably surprised at
I the excellence of the San Franciseos'
I playing.
This team, as It Is now, should prove
! formidable, providing the men shall be
; allowed to continue In their present post
i tions.
Ward. In renter, Is a good player and
I will Improve with practice. His high and
lofty maneuvering In center garden yes
terday was the direct result of "lack
of practice." Smith, at third, hnndled
himself well, as did Brown in right field.
The team really played good ball at
the bat, on the bases and in the field, and
their work Is deserving of commendation.
The tall-enders were hardly ever in the
i hunt, for their miserable fielding demol
i Shed every opportunity presented where
by a chance to gain a lead became possi-
I bie. They batted well, but not oppor
tunely, which accounts for uieir iow
score in the run column. This team sure
ly needs coaching, and undoubtedly
abundant practice.
Their pitcher, Whalen, Is a good man;
but with such support as he is in the
habit of receiving from his colleagues It
Is a wonder he does half so well.
The game was won by the San Fran
ciscos 1 opportune hitting, combined with
bast-running and the eight errors of their
opponents.
Shea was very effective, keeping his
hits well scattered, .and all told pitched
an excellent game. ''.'â ' j 'â â '.-.â¢ ":

letics evened up old scores and checked the
onward career of San Jose. Fltzpatrlck

port. Pyne with the bat and Stultz In
the field carried off the honors. Crowley's
Indians rang the beil in the first inning

judged line ball by McGucken. Then in

worsted Oakland in one of the fastest
games of the season to-day. Oakland
put up a fast game, but owing to Dau
benbls' effective box work were not able
to make much headway in the run-get
ting line. Santa Cruz put up a beautiful
fielding game and batted the ball hard
when runs were most needed. Mcln

The Eighth Defeated.
OAKLAND. Aug. 7.â ln a ten-Inning
game at Elmhurst to-day the soldier
baseball team from Camp Barrett went
down to defeat at the hands of the Grand
Rule Bazaar team. From start to finish
the contest was an Interesting one, and
but for a bad ruling of the umpire in the
last half of the tenth Inning the game
might have lasted several more Innings.
The score was as follows:
Clubsâ R. H. E.
Grand Rule Bazaar 4 1
Eighth Regiment 3 5
Batteriesâ Munson and Russell: Bevlllo and
Clark. Bevllla struck out fourteen men.
The Game a Draw.
WATSONYILLE, Aug. 7.â The K. S. and
P.'s of San Francisco and the P. V. "W.s
of this city played an eleven-inning game
here to-day with a score of three to three.
The game would probably have been de
cided In the next Inning but for the fact
that the Frisco boys had to stop playing
to catch the train for home. Donlin. who
next week goes to the Athletics of San
Francisco, pitched his farewell game for
the P. V. W.s, with whom he has been
for the last five months.
The Victorious Alumni.
The Alumni and the Llvermore baseball
teams met on the diamond in Oakland
yesterday and played a ten-inning game,
resulting in a score of eleven for the
Alumni team and eight for the Liver
mores. Golinsky, McLean and Allen were
the battery for the Alumni nine and Hu
pers, McCann and Meese for the Liver
more team.

All Day and Make Good.
Scores.
The Bharp. decisive popping of rifles In
the hands of keen-eyed marksmen was
heard from morning till evening at
Schuetzen Park yesterday. Three clubs
held monthly shoots, and the attendance
was large. It was a good day for the
riflemen, as the atmosphere was clear,
with little breeze blowing.
The Vereln Elntracht Schuetzen Sec
tion and the California SchuetxeiVClub
held their monthly medal shoots, while

The other scores were as follows: First
classâ C. Schroeder, #U. Second classâ
C. Suehrstedt, 325; H. Schwelger. 274.
As the Grutli shoot las'-d until late In
the evening no scores wÂ«"*j tallied. There
were forty prizes, and $27 in cash was in
this contest, both money and other prizes
being scheduled for distribution to the
winners at Union Square Hall next
Thursday evening.
A. Strecker. the "Tall Sycamore of the
California Schuetzen Club," distinguished
himself by making four bullseyes in suc
cession in the monthly medal shoot of

than usual of late and is rapidly return-
Ing to his old form. His score of 413 car

SHOT IN A HIGH WIND.
Shell Mound Riflemen Strive in Vain
for Good Scores.
There were but few shooting organiza
tions on the Shell Mound rifle range, and
the scores made were nothing to boast of
because of the high west wind that cp*ne
In from the bay. A number of the mem
bers of the San Francisco Schuetzen Ve

Clubs were out for practice, and they had
all they wanted In the way of guessing as
to how to work their wind-gauges. The

IN MEMORY
OF BISMARCK
Impressive Services at
Berlin.
DEAD STATESMAN EULOGIZED
ROYAL OPERA-HOUSE DRAPEE
IN MOURNING.
Emperor William Expresses the Wish.
That the Prince's Grave Shall
Become a Mecca for Ger-
man Pilgrimage. ,
Special IMspatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Aug. 7.â A Bismarck me
morial service, organized by the Berlin
Bismarck committee, was held at noon
to-day In the Royal Opera House. \
There was a large attendance. The
ceremony was impressive and worthy i
of the occasion. The walls and balcon- }
.ies of the auditorium were draped -with
black. After the funeral march from
Beethoven's "Erolca Symphony" had j
been performed curtains wore drawn
Bfiide disclosing a laurel-surrounded j
bust of Prince Bismarck. In front of
the pedestal upon which stood the bust
was a gold wreath trimmed with ,
â¢mourning ribbons.
Ernest yon Wildenbruch recited a
poem entitled "Our Bismarck" and the
chorus of the opera sang "Wei Sic
Sanft Ruhen." Privy Councillor Kahl,
an old friend of the dead statesman, j
then delivered an oration in which he j
referred to Prince Bismarck as "the J
conscience of the German people, a I
heritage ever defended with our
blood."
At the conclusion of the oration the \
assembly arose and sang Arendt's
hymn, "Gehm Nun Hin Und Grabt i
Meln Grabe." The services were con- j
eluded by the renderip- of a funeral
march by Wagner.
The Staats Burger Zeitung says that
after the funeral services in Berlin on
Thursday last, at which the Emperor
and Empress and many diplomats were
present, the Emperor, in conversation
with his Ministers, expressed the wish
that the "memory of the great Chan
cellor shall remain fresh and undimmed
with the German people and his grave
become a place of national pilgrimage
for all time."
TWO TRAINING SHIPS

Splendid Work of Former Appren
tices Lead to Secretary Long's
Decision.
NEW YORK, Aug. 7.â A Washington
â 1 to the Herald says: In view of
the splendid results obtained during
the present war from bluejackets who
were former apprentices th<; Navy De
partment has determined to foster the
plan of training: voting boys for service
on board men-of-war. Instructions
were griven yesterday by Secretary
Long for the rehabilitation of the Essex
and Adams as training-ships, one of
which will be stationed on the Atlantic
and the other on the Pacific Coast. Be
riiles these two ships the department
will k<H j p in service the Alliance and
Mohican. The Mohican Is now at Hon
olulu, but will be bro"<rht back to San
Francisco in all probability, where she
will be fitted out fur a cruise to Samoa.
SULTAN SCOFFS AT
AMERICAN DEMANDS
Repudiates Kesponsibility for Losses
Sustained During the Arme
nian Massacres.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Aug. 7. â The
Porte on Friday replied to the American
demand for compensation for losses sus
tained by American subjects during the
Armenian massacres.
The reply is the same as that given the
other powers, repudiating all responsibil
ity for the lasses.
During the course of the farewell audi
ence of Dr. J. B. Angell, the retiring
American Minister to Turkey, the Sultan
referred to the war between the United
States and Spain. He said he was much
impressed with the naval operations and
the terrible execution of American gun?
and had ordered the purchase of similar
guns for Turkey.
PLOT OF ANARCHISTS

COLOMBIA CONGRESS
IN SECRET SESSION
COLON, Colombia. Aug. 7 (via Galves
ton). â It Is understood In local circles that
Congrress is holding a secret session at
Bogota, discussing the matter of the set
tlement of the Cerrutl claim. The dissat
isfaction over the eventual settlement of
the claim and the consequent drain upon
Colombia's resources is beginning to cre
ate much bitter feeling throughout the
country. Even the Italian colonies at
Barranquille and other ports are resenting
the actions of the Italian Government.

GOSSIP OF
THE FLYERS
A "Find" in the Jockey
Line at Butte.
H. L. FRANK A HEAVY LOSER.
BOSS CROKER MADE A "RUN-UP"
RECORD IN ENGLAND.
A California Turfman Proposes Some
Reforms That Would Be Hailed
With Joy by the Fair-
Minded.
The Butte, Mont., meeting which ended
last Saturday can be put down as a suc
cess in every way, notwithstanding the
fact that comparatively few high-clasa
horses competed. The best flyers that
raced at the big mining camp were Scot-
I tish Chieftain, Mekallah, Miss Rowena,
I Lucky Star and Ostler Joe. The news
j papers of San Francisco were well rep
; resented, Fred E. Mulholland of The Call
! acting as presiding judge for two weeks,
I later as the associate of Ed Hopper In
} the stand, while Ben Benjamin of the
Chronicle has been patrol judge. The
attendance at the track has been very
! large, but the betting was not so heavy
toward the close as at the beginning. Joe
JLangendorftT and Fred Edwards have
j done excellently with the string they
leased of the San Jose turfman, J. Naglee
Burke, Dolore and others more than pay
ing their way.
H. L. Frank of Butte was a heavy
i loser at the Butte meeting and it was
; rumored that he intended leasing his
j horses and quitting the game. Mission*
er's win of a stake on the 2d of August
! may, however, cause him to change his
mind. Joe Piggott, who rides for Mr.
Frank was accounted the best horse pilot
there. Piggott loves San Francisco, and
while he likes Butte some and is well
â  treated there, he declares he "would
1 rather be a lamp-post In 'Frisco than the
! City Hall at Butte."
One of the "finds" of the Montana
meeting was Morgan, who can ride at
102 pounds. He is considered more than
"fair," and San Francisco critics may
I have a chance to judge as to his capabil
, ities next winter. He claims to be an
Indian, but is quite a dark one.
At the Belle Meade sale next October
! there will be disposed of thirty-six year
lings, seventy brood mares and the
two well-known stallions, imp. I>andie
Dinmont and the unbeaten Tre
mont. Tulla Blackburn and the Cali
fornia-bred mare Fairy arg. on the cat
alogue. The latter brought $10,000 at auc
tion when she was retired to the stud.
The Omaha running meeting, booked to
run from August IS to September 7, has
been declared off ac the exposition was
not being patronized as well as was ex
pected. Â»
The racing stewards of the St. Louis
Fair Association held a meeting on the
night of August 2 and decided to close the
present race meeting at the conclusion of
the regular ninety days, as per the breed
ers 1 racing bill. Thus the meeting winds
up at the end of August. The meeting
has been well patronised by both the
public and the horsemen, racing being
more popular there than in Chicago,
where a syndicate has been running the
books, and" as a matter of course offering
"cinchy" odds.
Tod Sloan rode the first two winners at
Saratoga Saturday and finished third on
Sir Hubert. His winners were Dr. Eicli
bPTg and Damien. who raced out here
two years ago in Pat Dunne's colors.
Martha 11. here last winter, won the
Hendrie stakes, mile and* a sixteenth,
beating Laverock. Lillian Bell, Kenmore
Queen and other good "lies.
Peixotto, Dolore and Duke of York 11.
all bred In California, won at Butte on
the closing dayâ lust Saturday.
Burns & "vVaterhousp's bay colt Excur
sion (by Take Notice-Picnic) won the
Merchants' stakes at Detroit on Satur
day, running the live furlongs In I:O2Vi.
At Chicago this summer third was the
best he could do. though much was ex
pected of him all the time.
Water Girl, a recent winner at Saratoga,
Is by Imp. Watercress from Parthenia,
the famous race mare by Alarm.
Good Hope, a St. Louis winner, is a
2-year-old sister to Lottie Mills, being by
<"olonel Clark out of Gratitude. Lottie
Mills was a perfect gold mine for years,
and is now, we believe, among the brood
mares on Barney Schrelber's stock farm
at Bridgeton, Mo.
One of the greatest sensations on the
English turf this season was Richard
i inker's purchase of the 2-year-old colt.
Little Saint, out of a selling race at Ban
downe Park, where he gave the largest
sum on record for a selling plater, viz:
1600 guineas.
The colt thus run up to over $8000 In a
selling race cost Â«X) guineas as a yearling,
and is mighty well bred for a selling
plater, being by Friar's Balsam (sire of
Voter, The Friar and Ca^seopia in this
country) out of Little Emily, by Wis
dom: second dam Lady Emily, by Dis
tun (sire of Imp. Charaxus).
A California turfman who considers that
certain racing men are in receipt of quite
"a shade" at Ingleslde, while others are
favored at the Oakland track to a marked
extent, proposes the following plan of re
form where every one will receive the
same treatment, which will be fair: Pro
grammes should be issued at least a
month in advance, so that no race can
be made, for the horse that has won but
once since April 19 or some other strange
date or condition. There should be six
entry boxes, or one for ench race. The
entries should be opened In plain view of
the turfmen Interested. As the entries
are taken from the box they ought to
be turned face upward and fifteen of them
token in rotation. If any entries remain
they should be left out of the race, even
though they might belong to some spoiled
darling of the club. In this way a poor
owner has as good a chance of starting
his horse as the more wealthy and fav
ored one. As matters are now, it Is said,
some men owning horses have- their en
tries thrown out with great â¢ regularity,
simply because it pleases those In author
ity so to do. There should be but two
selling races per day. one where the top
price is. $2500. the other for, say $1000. Our
racing friend thinks there should be five
handicappers; that they should all turn
in siips (with the horses' names and the
weights they think correct) by a certain
hour; then the pecretury's duty would
be to add up the figures and divide them
by five, thus "striking an average." He
also believes that racing reporters make
the best racing judges, and he believes
they (at least those who have had. say,
five* years' experience or more) should be
the ones to have chnrgre of matters in
both the judges' and stewards' stands.

"How vas you," said Maurice, address-
Ing the lion when he entered the cage.
A roar was the answer, and Maurice pro
ceeded as rapidly as his weight allowed
to dispose as large a portion of his anat

pares and likewise Cannon paced, paced
to keep behind the trainer. Then Maurice
and his guardian lit cigars: a minute
later the big man squeezed his form out

and the scene was over.

I am acquainted with the case of the wife of a nouse painter IÂ»
Brooklyn, who had the grip, and was confined to the house for three
months. She was in a listless state and suffered terribly with nausea,
It so happened that a friend had given some Ripans Tabules to this
lady's sister who had suffered from indigestion, and as they did her so
much good she thought she would try them on Mrs. Hill, feeling sura
that if they did her no good they would at least do no harm. The
patient was then In the hands of her physician, but soon she was so
much better tbat her neighbors noticed the change and asked about
It She then said that she had changed her doctor, and laughingly
added, my new doctor is colored â chocolate color. It seems that as
*oon as she began to take the Tabules, she began to mend. The
nausea disappeared and she began to feel that the future still had

DR. PARDEE
RESORTS
TO ABUSE
Cornered in Trickery,
He Used Epithets.
INTENDED TO DECEIVE
â  -INCENSED AT THE EXPOSURE
OF HIS COMPACT.
.. "Trying to Disfranchise the Voters of
'.'â  ..--the Sunol and Altamont Dis
''. ..\ tricts in the Coming Pri
:â â ' . '.. .;' maries.
â¢-â¢:" -jQAKIiAND, Aug. 7.â Overwhelmed by
.-â  .-tire exposure of his many political trick-
Vries; Dr. Genre:" C. Pardee haa resorted
t.vtlie last extremity of his kind, and has
raÂ«"hed into print with clumsily prepared
s-tatements, consisting largely of vulgar
....abuse with which he intended to deceive
â¢â¢ : the public into believing were denials of
: the charges none better than Pardee
â  .knows to be true.
.The Call this morning called attention
v. to.the doctor's ravings over its exposure
'erf his secret compact with I^ou Brown,
whenby he had agreed, in direct contra
.â  veritioh of all his expressions of good will
. to Mr. Davis, to turn his strength to the
Secretary of State, thus effectually de
: .stroying all chance of the nomination
.'.coming to Alameda County. After doing
. :Vome shrieking on his own account
utrainst an attache of The Call, whom
I â  t!i he and his master knew had no con
nection whatever with the exposure, the
ydung man who. in addition to his regular
: employment, finds time to boom Pardee.
...: Quotes the doctor as saying in effect that
he had no time to reply to all the accu- j
Bations made against him.
Republicans of Alameda County and of
the entire State would be glad if Dr. Par
. â¢ :'de,e oould rind time to answer these accu
â¢v cations, Instead of becoming hysterical
over them.
' Bot Dr. Pardee has found time to take
â ;. ; cognizance of another episode of his
fantastic campaign, and in doing bo
.he is even less happy than his allu
â  fcion . to the expose of his deal with
Brown. (Several days ago The Call drew
rather forceful attention to the juggling
... with the polling places in Murray Town-
J ship by County Committeeman Harris in
' '.the interest of his friend, the doctor. In
Sunol. Altamont and Tcsla all strong Da
vis precincts, Harris failed to provide for
â¢. any polling places, but compelling the
ersto travel a considerable distance,
â¢and at great personal inconvenience, to
exercise their privilege at the primaries.
â¢â  In the case ot Tesla, Harris ignored the
express instructions of the call issued by
the County â¢ Committee, which provided
â¢ that a polling place should be located
there.
.-/ Dr. Pardee and his organ remained dis
. â¢â .crt-etjy silent on this subject for some
':" .(lays, presumably to give Harris a chance
..â â¢to cover? up his coarse work in part by
providing Tesla with a polling place as
â¢ ordered- by the County Committee.
â  When that had been done the doctor be
â 'â _ -gan. to ' show signs* of another- spasm,
â¢ -hvliieh has increased to such an extent
.'â¢â¢that he has broken out with a tirade
â¢: against The Call for stating that Tesla
was'- to have no polling place. Not a
â vy- rd does he say about Sunol and Alta
' "riiont, w-hich are still out In the cold, and
â :.-. w.Hild have been far better for him
A had'- he restrained himself from saying
â¢ . anything at all. Tesla will have a poll
l ing' "place at the primary simply because
- :Paraee*a man Harris was forced to carry
but the will of the county committee by
â  'The Call's expose, but Altamont and
â¢ Bun el will not, unless the doctor cornea
to- his senses and issues new orders to
â¢â¢-Harris.
:/-": TlH^'ls what the Livermore Herald of
â  -relay has to say on the subject:
.'â  â¢- Th-e Republican voters of Bunol and Altamont
-..are -Justly indignant over the action of Com
' man Harris, representing: the County
â¢â â¢ Central. Committee, in the location of polling
"Maces throughout Murray Township for the
".State primaries next Saturday. Sunol and Al
.â¢'â¢tamont have been left out in the cold, and
â¢ "Tesla- would have shared the same fate had
! . Mr. Harris had his own sweet way in the mat
ter
.-. Whether Karris' desire to disfranchise the
â¢'â¢ voters &f thÂ»se precincts was prompted by
' another desire to aid Pardee Is a queetlon to
; which is attached considerable significance.
"â¢' Both' gentlemen are fully aware that Murray
Township with half a chance would elect every
' T>ne of the nine delegates for Davis. It was
â¢" -.not unt.'l considerable pressure was brought to
." .bear- Aipon Murray's coir.mltteeman that he con
- .fer.tfl to include Tesla as a precinct and abso
. lately 'refused to recognize Sunol and Altamont.
' : The extenuation he offers for his dereliction
; â¢â  Is flimsy and reminds one of the way In which
'. â¢ Pardt* does politics. Mr. Harris' first excuse
' - for not recognizing the rights of the Republi
"' -.cars of the towns mentioned was that the cost
. â "â¢'ln conducting the primaries was too much. Mr.

YACHTSMEN BAKE
THE JUICY CLAMS
MANY GUESTS ENTERTAINED
BY CORINTHIAN TARS.
Navigators of the Fleet of Pleasure
Craft Hold High Revelry at
Tiburon.'
For the benefit of Its non-yacht-ownlng
â¢ members and its many friends the Cor
i inthian yachtsmen hefa a big clnm-bake
lat their club-house yesterday. The bake
! was under the supervision of G. Crowell,
a native of the State of Maine and super
intendent of the fish yards at California
City. He was assisted by E. S. Carpen
ter. The bake was constructed according
to the most approved Eastern principles.
I Early on Sunday morning a big fire was
| lighted in a hollow in the rocks below
the club-house and was kept up until the
large round stones packed into It were
red-hot. Then sea-weed was laid upon
j the stones and quantities of clams, dug
I from the sandy shores of Marin County,
ppring chickens, green c,orn and sweet
| potatoes were buried in the sea-weed. At
i about 1 o'clock the viands were drawn
out piping hot and were spread upon
tables set out upon the piazza. They were
at once pounced upon by the club's
guests and disappeared at a marvelous
rate. After hunger and thirst had been
assuaged, to the accompaniment of music
by Professor Barton's Native Sons' band,
! ail adjourned to the club-room upstairs,
where they were entertained for an hour
or two by Frank Thompson, Ben Tarbox,
Oscar Franks, Jack O'Brien and others.
Petersen gave excellent imitations of a
Swedish immigrant, an Italian street per
former and a Chinaman recently arrived
In San Francisco from New York. Mau
rice Cramer presided at the piano and
Professor Louis Crepaux of the Paris
opera gave some excellent songs. Lncle
George Bromley treated the boys to one
of his Inimitable speeches, aid the
Brownie banjo trio, consisting' of G.
Emerton, J. Burton and H. Rothermel,
assisted In entertaining the party.
After a merry and jovial time the com
pany formed up in military array, and
headed by the band marched down the
streets of Tiburon to the depot G.
Crowell and his assistant say that It is
absurd to assert that a clam-bake cannot
be given here as well as on the Eastern
coast; they say that a suitable sea- weed
can be found and that the clams are act
ually juicier than the Eastern ones. The
whole affair was voted a great success by
all who shared in 11
Sport in the Handball Court.
The lovers of handball sport assembled
in Phil Ryan's court at 858 Howard street,
yesterday afternoon for their Sunday's
outing. The games were well contested
and the play was kept up during the en

decide the closing game, so interested did

THE SA3* FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 8, 1898.
WHY NOT A
COMPROMISE?
It Might Hasten the
Water Front Trials.
A BAILIWICK OF FROGS
NEED OF AVOIDING ERRORS OF
PAST CAMPAIGNS.
The Nomination for Assessor Is Now
the Chief Question in County
Political Mat
ters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 7.
Now that the water front suit Is once
more In the courts the question is again
being asked â will it ever be free from liti
gation? For thirty years the people of
Oakland have been cursed with the great
est blessing a city can haye â a splendid
water front. Since Horace Carpontier
made his deal with the Town Trustees
in 1852 the water front has stood in the
way of Oakland's progress. It has been
in the Legislature and the courts. It has
cost a fortune in law suits, and to-day
it is of no more benefit to the city than
it was when Mexicans camped near the
estuary before the American occupation.
Probably nowhere else In the world does
such a condition exist. Cities containing
100,000 people have grown up along the
water front and yet it is but the abode
of frogs and a menace to health. Once
more the case Is on trial and to laymen
there appears to be as much, or more, to
argue, obiect to, and adjudicate, as there
ever was. It was thought that the deci
sion of the Supreme Court rendered a
year ago, would have the effect of ex
pediting the final decision, but it now ap
poars that there is enough disputed
ground to last as a basis for appeals
and new trials for years. And tn the
meantime. Oakland suffers and bemoans
her lack of progress.
Within the past week, during 1 a conver
sation with men interested in this city's
development, the project of a commission
was broached to settle the matter and
the proposition certainly has merit. It
was proposed that the Water Front Com
pany, representatives of the city govern
ment, merchants and others should take
the Supreme Court decision for a basis
and arrange a distribution of the property
that could be legally recognized. It is
not unreasonable to suppose that all
parties interested would be willing to
make concessions so that title could be
secure. The main points have been deter
mined by the highest court in the State
and only comparatively minor matters
have to be arranged, but If each of these
details are to be made the basis of a
year of litigation another generation will
be bereft of tho progress that can only
come with an adequate harbor.
It is very certain that whoever repre
sents this district in Congress for the
next term will have to satisfy the people
of Alameda of his determination to do
something 1 with the. tidal canal. The En
clnal City is far from satisfied with the
present conditions of affairs and they are
pretty well convinced that there is not
much use in petitions and addresses to the
War Department. There must be a 11
lpmry at Washington containing matter
on the tidal canal, but it is of no more
value than so much waste paper, when
results are considered, Alameda may per
haps be vain enough to wish for a post
office building, but she certainly wishes
more for relief at the east end of the
city.
Before another week passes the State
primaries will have been held and Ala
meda County will turn her attention to
congressional and county matters. Every
body concedes that this is to be a Repub
lican year and the rush of candidates for
county offices is proportionately great.
This year a plain duty faces the Repub
lican party in this county. The county
government is at present largely in the
hands of Populists and if Alameda would
remain the banner county of the party
men must be placed before the voters In
whom there is perfect confidence. The
theory that one foul rivulet can pollute
a mighty river is as true of politics as
of anything else, and unless the good of
the party be considered of more value
than personality a repetition of former
disasters will certainly be experienced.
There are now before the party the
names of those who are anxious for the
nominations and it cannot be doubted
that the field offers a good choice for
every office. For some offices so much
excellent material Is offered that a selec
tion would be difficult. Hardly a name
has as yet appeared that does not pre
sent some claim, but it is not on personal
claims that Republican officials are going
to be elected in this county. The only
claim that will be recognized this fall
will be party merit, and If one or two
bosses are permitted to control matters
and to manipulate some "yellow dog"
deals in their own interests, Alameda will
again be disrupted. Nor must it be taken
for granted that the territory around the
bay can gobble up all the nominations
and ignore the interior of the county. It
is Jn the Interior where the Democratic
party claims its Btronghold. Everybody
has heard of the boasted majority that
the Democracy is always going to bring
over the San Leandro bridge.and in too
many Instances the boast has been ful
filled Only bad management can elect
officials of 'all political lines In a strong
Republican county, and no Republican
wants to see a repetition of the county's
blunders of 1894.__
It Is very evident that one of the most
interesting contests In the county fight
win be that of County Assessor. Henry
Dalton has announced that he will make
a campaign to succeed himself. Robert
Leckie has stated that he will seek the
Republican nomination and there are
Borne whisperings that R. W. Snow may
be put in the fight. Mr. Dalton has not
vet announced whether he will run Inde
pendently, as he did four years ago, or
whether he will seek the Republican nom
ination. He has emphatically denied that
he will be a candidate for any other office
than County Assessor, but he will go no
further Leckie was Dalton's predecessor
and his' friends think that Dalton should
assert himself, so that others may lay
their lines, but this is evidently just what
the Assessor is anxious to avoid. It is
not likely that City Auditor Snow will
be drawn into the fight, as he is already
talke'i of as the Republican candidate
for Mayor next spring. He could nave
had the nomination at the east city con
vention' but he preferred to succeed him
self Snow is the most successful politi
cian in municipal politics that Oakland
has known for years. He does his poll
tics at his fireside and Is rarely heard
of between conventions, but each time he
has come up he is utronger than before.
Should Snow be Induced to take the Re
publican nomination and Dalton run in-
Sependent it would^hard to P^the

There Is a lull in local military affairs

Sickness among the troops In San Fran

all the hospitals are filled with patients,
and the division field hospital at the Pre

men.
There were no deaths at the division
hospital yesterday. A number of the sol
diers, however, are critically ill. The ad
missions to the hospital yesterday were
so many that its capacity was overrun,
and the surgeon in command had to or

there were no accommodations for them.
At the post hospital Private Joseph 11.

FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE
Rev. W. E. Copeland's Address on a
War Subject.
Rev. W. K. Copoland addressed a large
audience last night before the Theosoph
ical Society on "The Effects of the War
With Spain on Universal Brotherhood or
ex-Bello Peace." He said: "Little by
little the tyranny of Spain has been wiped
out as her possessions have been wrested
from her. With the few islands that re
mained the possibilities of evil were nar
rowed down, but unfortunately her tyr
anny has been concentrated in them. It
was In the interest of brotherhood that
it was at last determined that Cuba
should be set free. This war is a war in
the interest of brotherhood and the glory
of enfranchising a people who have been
subject to the persecution of Spain for
centuries has fallen to the United States.
All people wanted the Cubans to be free,
and the work which this country has set
about doing has been accomplished."

California bred greyhounds proved their
right to rank with the best representa

performances at Ingleside Coursing Park
yesterday. In the presence of the great
est concourse of spectators ever jm'

from the dogs during the day.
The crowd, which was estimated at
" over 6000, simply overflowed all the avail
able points of view. The stands were
packed, while the betting ring was a
seething mass of humanity, through
whlch.it was impossible to force a pas
sage. The commissioners could not han
dle all the money offered, so eager were
the bettors to place their wagers.
The chief attraction was the match race
between Connemara and False Flatterer.
They met once before, Connenaflxa win
ning. Since that time the Kngiish dog
has rounded into form and it was difficult
to pick the ultimate winner. It remained
for the actual contest to demonstrate
' how closely matched they were. It was
to be best two out of three coursi
the entire series was required to deter

first- False Flatterer the second and
Connemara the third and decisive one.
Connemara ruled favorite throughout at
odds of 10 to X They were slipped to a
â¢Kood hare, Connemara at one showing
the most speed, reaching the game two
lengths in front of his opponent and
'serving himself for the next two points.
He then ran wide, placing False Flat

r.eat work in exchanging by both dogs.

ever seen in California.

FLEET HARE RAN
HOUND TO DEATH
Two Dogs Run Until They Drop
From Exhaustion â One
Died.
The most remarkable run up In the his
tory of coursing in this city occurred yes
terday morning at Union Park. Two
swift bounds, ied by a swifter hare, ran
until they both dropped from exhaustion,
and one died on the field. The doga were
Curtis & Son's Lady Campbell and Pem
broke Kennel's Sylvanus. L,ady Campbell
scored eighteen points to Sylvanus' three,
but he was stone dead when the follow
ers got to her. The hare escaped. This Is
the first incident of the kind on record
where the coursing was within an en
closure. â . _ ,
When the hounds were slipped Sylvanus
took the lead and held it about half way
across the field. Lady Campbell then

passed him, and from that time until the
end of the chase maintained a lead of
over three lengths. Led by the fleet hare,
the dogs ran round and round the field,
from the slip to the escape and back
again, and after running a couple of min
utes neither dog scored. On the second
run back from the escape both hounds
fell, completely exhausted, but Lady
Campbell, after a moment, got up and
again took after the quarry. She ran a
few yards and dropped dead. Sylvanus
was carried off the field in a blanket. He
will recover, but may never be good for
anything.
Yesterday's card was a good one; the
hares ran swiftly and the sport was ex
cellent, although the short enders won a
majority of the courses. The prettiest
run. next to the Lady Campbell-Sylvanus
event, was between Firm Friend and Ro
sette. The dogs ran neck and neck half
way across the field, neither scoring until
Firm Friend secured the first turn. Firm
Friend was on the short endâ l to 2*4.
Other short enders who won were Sports

birds, John Lubben 12 and E. D. Conolley IS
birds. Those from the Lubbon loft all came 'in
together at exactly 2 o'clock, according: to the
timing machine attached to the lofts, which
makes a mistake impossible. The high wind
made the time very slow.
The greater portion of the Pluett flight ar
rived at 2:04:30, several came at intervals dur
ing the afternoon and half a dozen of them
did not arrive until after 5 o'clock.
E. D. Conolley of 1423 Morton street had
eighteen birds in the match, and they all came

Rebel Cork Picnickers.
The twelfth annual picnic of the Rebel
Cork Benevolent Association was held
yesterday at Shell Mound Park and the
attendance was large. Over fifty gate
prizes -were given out, and every gift was
well worth receiving. The first prize was
a sewing machine valued at $70. A pro
gramme of games of two dozen events
furnished lots of amusement for the pic
nickers, and the contestants were amply
rewarded for their efforts on the track
with prizes, the gifts of dozens of the
friends of the organization. Most of the
day was spent in dancing, and some of
the old country dances were Introduced
which were highly enjoyed.
BROUGHT DOWN
DISGUSTED MEN
The Tiliamook Arrives
With Little Gold.
FIFTEEN THOUSAND ABOARD
MINERS DISSATISFIED AT xriE
RESULT OF THEIR WORK.
Captain Doran Lost a Barge Going
Up, but Congratulates Himself
on Landing the Ride
out.
The steamer Tiliamook arrived from St. J
â  Michael last evening with thirty-seven |
passengers, many of whom were return
lne miners, who had not over $15,000 In
i gold.
Captain Peter Doran, the commander of
! the vessel, is very much delighted with
his feat of succeeding In taking his tow, i
j the Rldeout, up to St. Michael in safety, j
! and is probably the most satisfied man ;
' aboard the steamer, as nearly all of the j
- miners who came down on her did not do :
. as well as they expected.
T. Drown, who was In the dis
trict but one year. Is the fortunate pos- !
sessor of more than half of the dust j
: brought down on the Tillamook. He has i
j In the neighborhood of $SOOO to show for
; his year's work. The remainder of the
| gold on the ship was divided in small
sums among the other passengers, but
a number of the miners had nothing at
all. The unfortunate ones were styled
by one of the ship's officers as "sore
i heads." They went, up into the gold dis
trict expecting to find the yellow metal
so plentiful that it could be taken up by
the shovelful, and when they discovered i
that work was required to secure it in
moderate quantities they became dis
1 couraged and came down the river tnor- |
i oughly disgusted with the country.
The trip up to St. Michael was filled,
with trouble for Captain Doran. The
Rideout that the Tillamook towed north |
had to be nursed all the way and the |
I fact that she was finally landed at her :
! destination in pnod condition is due to the !
excellent seamanship of the commander
'on the steamer. She la the only stern
wheel steamer which was taken from (
i here in tow which reached port, and Cap- ;
i tain Doran cannot be blamed for congrat
i ulating himself on his success.
On the way up the Tillamook took In j
I tow at Dutch Harbor a barge which was
placed astern of the Rideout. The barge
'â  began to Irak almost as soon as she
Btarted, and when two days out of Dutch
.harbor had sunk to the waters edge. It :
was lashed up and in this condition sixty
miles a day were made. The president !
of the California-Yukon Transportation
Company, who was on board, nnally or
dered the barge to be cut adrift, which
was done contrary to the advice of < ap
taln Doran, who thought she- could be
saved. This is probably the barge which
the I.eelanaw sighted 200 miles south of ;
St. Michael.

A KISS AS A REWARD
FOR THEIR VICTORY
TURNERS ARE REPAID TOR SUC
CESSFUL COMPETITION.
A Grand Ball Held by the Turnsch
â western Verein in Honor of
Its Skillful Athletes.
Athletes and fair maids onnctfd one of j
the prettiest ceremonies witnessed In this ;
city in many moons. It took place during j
the grand ball and prize distribution given
last night in honor of the active Turners
by the San Francisco Turnschwestern :
Verein at their hall on Turk street.
As each of the young men who upheld j
the honor of the verein during the big j
tournament at San Jose was called to the j
platform to receive the handsomely en
graved diploma won in competition
against rival organizations, he was taken
in hand by one of six pretty girls who
first pinned a token on his breast and '
then implanted a kiss on his expectant
lips in payment for his share of hard
work done" during the tournament.
The pleasing task of thus recognizing;
the valor of the society's champions was
assigned to Miss Lillie Nusbaum, Miss
Clara Attinger, Miss Emma Planz. Miss
Carrie Nielson, Miss Mlnnje Trost and
Miss Clara Trost, wfio ably performed
their duties.
Among the Turners who were fortunate
enough to receive the favors were:
Will Hlnz Theodore Planz, Sam Bachman,
John Hoops. Will Hoffmann, Louis Rapp, |
Harry Meyr. FrM Hoffman, KOdolphe Bauer, |
Mr Steinbrook. W. Sterger. Gus HerÃman, Joe
Edolmonn, Oscar KalÂ«er. M. Wallensteln. Al
Uruenrteleln F. Wlllenbrink, H. Muller, Fritz
Attinger, Adam Brehn, F. Acker and John
Ut^chig.
The prize winners made a handsome j
appearance dressed in their gray Turners' |
uniforms and were greatly in demand dur
ing the remainder of th<Â» evening
as partners In the dances that followed.
President Schroeder of the Turn Ver.'in
delivered a felicitous speech in German
in which he congratulated the verein in
having such splendid representatives, and !
told of their efforts at the tournament I
being crowned with victory. Applause j
greeted his remarks and dancing was
again resumed. The singing by members
of the verein was much enjoyed.
ETHICS OF CHARITY.
Dr. Stebbins on the Amelioration of
the Horrors of War.
The Influence of the charities of human
ity in the present war formed a theme
for the Rev. Dr. Horatio Stebbins at the
First Unitarian Church yesterday morn
ing.
At first thought, he said. It seemed
strange that the violent movement of so
ciety and of nations which has been from
the beginning until now and which we
call war should be the theater for the
display of those great sentiments we call
the humanities?. Jn no respect la the pro
greaa of society and the amelioration of
man's estate more distinctly marked than
In the gradual recognition of the ethics
of war and the efforts to relievo its mis
eries. Taking the world as it is. and
knowing that so long as the world is. sn
war will be, with robbers still infesting
the highways of the world, the road from
Jerusalem to Jericho is a symbol at once
of the conflict of hate and mercy.
It Is no longer true, he said,, that the
laws are silent In the midst of the arm
ies, nor that the victors shall Inflict all
the vengeance and cruelties upon the de
feated ones. There is such a thing as
the ethics of the humanities of war. Men
do not cease to be merely beings, but re-
Fponsible to one another and to God.
Armies fight no more with poisoned ar
rows nor are communities of men, women
and children put to death to the exter
minating of the race. Morality is the
umpire whose judgment the nations ac
cept There has been a great advance of
public opinion within the last half cen
tury and that advance has been expressed
In the striking display of the sentiment
of human nature in this conflict of the
past three months.

The Powder Was Too Strong.
Frank Meister, an upholsterer livlnp at
430% Natoma street, met with an accident
yesterday while hunting near Stcges sta
tion that nearly cost him his left hand
and arm. He was using a powerful pow
der, and when in the act of shooting a
squirrel the charge blew the lefthand
barrel of the gun to pieces. The force of
the high explosive ripped the barrel from
the breech for a distance of four inches,
tore a big piece out of the righthand
barrel and stripped the rib out of the
gun almost to the muzzle. The flying
metal tore away a large quantity ol
Meister's hand and wrist and otherwise
injured him so that it will be a long time
before he can follow his trade again.
His Injuries were dressed at the Harbor
Receiving Hospital in this city.
FEAST OF ST. DOMINIC.
The Patronal Feast of the Order of
Dominicans Solemnly Com
memorated.
The Feast of St. Dominic was solemnly
commemorated yesterday at St. Dominic' 4*4 *
Church, on Steiner street. Solemn high
mass was celebrated at 11 o'clock In the i
morning, followed by a special ceremony â 
In the evening. A panegyric on the life
and works of the saint was eloquently de
livered by the Rev. Father Pius Murphy.
who outlined the wonderful career of the
founder of the Dominican Order and cited
the many lr^sons to be drawn from his
life for fmitatlon by the men of to-day.
The history of the order in all its progress
and evolution since its inception was re- j
viewed by the preacher; and the success :
which has always attended the institution |
of branch communities, now scattered the ,
world over, outlined.
tfpfclal music was arranged and sung !
at the mass by an augmented choir, un
der the direction of the organist. The offi
ciating priest, one of the members of the
order, was assisted in the solemnization
of mass by a deacon and sub-deacon. who
were also chosen from the Dominican :
clergy.
The altars and sanctuary were beauti
fully decorated for the occasion with
myriads of candles, exotic growths, rare
flowers, ferns ,-md palms. The high altar
presented a combined picture of flicker
ing light and varied color. Arrangod in
descending tiers were hundreds of candles
and bright fairy lights, which made a
glistening background of the bright mar
ble slabs of the aitar steps.
In the evening. In addition to the recital
of the rosary and a procession, an elo
quent and instructive sermon was deliv
ered on the s:ibjpct of the patron saint.

LABOR CONTRACTS TO HOLD
ABBIVAL OF THE HAWAIIAN
COMMISSION.
Senator Morgan Tells Why He Made
So Vigorous a Fight to Take
Hawaii Into the "Onion
of States.
Tho Hawaiian Commission, consisting
of Senators Cnllom and Morgan and Rep
resentative Hitt. arrived in this city last
night at five minutes after 11 o'clock on
the overland train that was more than
two hours lato. The party included Mrs.
6 M Cullom. Mrs. William B. Ridgely
Senator Cullom's daughter; J. Castle
Ridgely, the Senator's private secretary;
George W. Morgan, private secretary to
Senator Morgan; Mrs. R. R, Hitt, wife of
the Congressman; William Hitt, a son.
and Robert R. Hitt. another son, and the
Congressman's private secretary. The
officers of the commission accompanying
the commission aro Henry W. Hayes,
secretary. M. W. Blumenberg, official
stenographer; Albert S. Berry Jr., ser
â¢gjant-at-arms, and D. A. Ray, disbursing
officer.
When they left behind them the glaring
sands, the bleak alkali and the stunted
sagebrush of the Nevada desert and un
der a smiling sky of unfleckod blue passed
through the granite gates of California
Into the pines and vines and orange groves
of tho north they heaved a sigh of re
lief. .
"It's a lovely land to be In." said Con
gressman Hitt, "but one must cross a
fearful desert to get here."
At Auburn, where the train stopped for
a little while, a crowd of citizens greeted
the party from the platform with cheers,
and a committee of ladies of that lovely
village of the Sierra foothills brought
baskets of fruits and flowers to Mrs. Hitt,
Mrs Cullom and Mrs. William Ridgely,
daughter of Senator and Mrs. Cnllom.
An outburst of similar hospitality was
encountered at Sacramento, at which
place the train arrived at 0:45. The depot
was crowded with fair daughters of the
Capitol City. Mayor Land, Grove L.
Johnson. J. O. Coleman, City Trustee
Lawton. Messrs. Petrie, Beckwith and
others of the committee on reception in
vited the Commissioners to say a few
wi rds to the thousand Sacramentang who
had assembled there for the purpose of
>ming them. After a general hand
shaking and introduction speeches were
made from the rear platform of the car,
it having been found impossible to break
through the crowd that blocked the way

While chatting with the committee
some one asked Mr. Hltt his opinion re
garding the annexation of Hawaii, a ques
tion which the gentleman ignored by ask
ing why It was that California farmers
allowed oak trees to grow in their wheat
fields. He thought It a great ana unnec
essary waste of land. Some one replied
that the trees were aboriginal and that
they were allowed to stand in the fields
In order to prevent the grain from being
baked into pretzels, an answer which
amused the Commissioner.
The distinguished xontlemen, however,
said more in their speches from the back
platform of the car than they did in their
private conversations.
Senator Cullom, after thanking the Cali
â¢fornians for their hospitality, remarked
that he would not say a word as to what
the Commission intended doing, but he
would say that for very many years each
of them had been a strong advocate of the
annexation of Hawaii as a part of the
United States. They were under instruc
tions by the act of Congress to investi
gate and determine, so far as they were
able the character of legislation neces
sary- to be enacted by Congress for the
government of the islands.
Senator Morgan said that this would be
his second visit to Hawaii. The first had
been for the purpose of informing him
self as an American Senator whether or
not he ought to vote for its admission.
He had found that all American states
men with a single exception, which he aid
not care to mention, had been earnestly
.in favor of annexation. It was a work
that had developed itself under the prov
idence of God, and this Sabbath afternoon
could not be better occupied than in re
minding themselves of the facts which led
to the annexation of Hawaii.
"In IS2O a band of American mission
aries went to Hawaii and round a woman
there in the regency of the islands after
the death of Kamehameha Iâ a woman
who had redeemed her sex from the
abominations of the Tabu; had burned up
the idols; had destroyed the temples of
the ldolators, and had proclaimed, as far
as she was able, the liberty of her sex.
Thus was Initiated by a woman a Dolicy
wblch will continue until the Hawaiian
Islands have been thoroughly American
"We are going In there," continued the
Senator, "on a mission of peace and
brotherly love and to welcome Into the
Union a people who are worthy in ail
respects of being: ciflaens of the Unitea
States.
"I find that thin mlCTion ha* come to
fruitage sooner than I hoped it would, I
and 1 have no doubt that not many
months will pass before all antagonism
to the annexation of Hawaii will be dis
sipated. This mission of peace will bring
the fruit of righteousness both to the
people of Hawaii and to those of the
United States, and your own great State
of California will be benefited more than
any other State in the American Lrnion
Mr Hitt did not say anything about j
Hawaii, but as the time was short he;
confined himself to thanking the people
for their enthusiastic welcome.
Mr Hitt declined to be interviewed as
to what action the commission proposed !
to take. He had his own opinion, he
said, but that was private. The function
of the committee was investigation and j
to make recommendations to Congress on ,
their return from the islands. What those
recommendations would be he could not
state, nor did ho know. Jhey would de
pend entirely on the result of tho investi- |
6 M^Cullom gave a similar reply to ques- .
tions put by The Call reporter. .
Mr. Morgan took a similar tack b it he
was so full of the subject, so enthusias- j
tic over the cause of imnexation th.it ne
soon thawed out and frankly declared his
opinions. He could hot tell what the
commission intended doing, because they
had not held a meeting and would not
until they should co into -session in Hon
olulu with the commission appointed by
the late Hawaiian republic. TTn i tpd
"The benefits to accrue to the United |
States from annexation were numerous :
and far-reaching in their importance, "he
said, and he .lid not consider that the
westward limits of the nlte ' I .. Stat T P < ?,^ r s e
which we have acquired, and they are 600
miles west of Hawaii, so that they ac-
Kaify included Hawaii .within the.pur
view of the limits of the United States
and we annexed her We ought to fix the
western boundary of the I nited States,
and we may find It necessary to. acquire
other possessions."
The Senator then cited Pap-Pago, In
Samao. taken as a naval station. In that j
place the United States had title to the >
land around the margin of the bay and j
ouite a distance back. Being a commer
cial nation, we are obliged to have coal
ins and naval stations In different parts
of the world for repairs, drvdocks, etc., |
and being a commercial nation, j
we ' should use every means to sus- i
tain the efficiency of the navy for the \
protection of our commerce. Coming :
down to matters of more immediate con- ;
seauence to us I would say that Hawaii, >
heimr about 2000 miles from the principal j
; Dort of our Western coast, is a point !
: which In its strategic value is estimated
by military men and naval officers as in- â ,

WILL MAKE LAWS FOR HAWAII
Pacific where these things can be ob
tained. There is no reason why the Ha
waiian Islands should not take the same
relation to the commerce of the world,
particularly to commerce on the Ameri
can shores of the Pacific Ocean, as Hong
kong does to Asia, a port which in fifty
years sprung from a barren rock to be
one of the most important ports in the
world. I do not understand why we
should not be very anxious to acquire
Hawaii when we consider its value to
navigators and to commerce generally.
"Another important relation that Ha
waii bears to the United States and tho
whole of the Pacific Coast in particular
is the fact that it will be th% landing
place, and the only one, for these lines of
electrical cable that must supply the Paci
fic Coaat with naval intelligence. That is
one of the most excellent features of the
situation. No cable can be built from the
American continent to the Asiatic con
tinent without having a resting place
somewhere in midocean, and Hawaii i.s
the only place that is available in the
North Pacific. Cable lines under the con
trol of the United States from the Amer
ican coast to Hawaii will be joined there
by lines from the different points of the
Pacific Coast of Asia and Australia. It
seems to me that the advantages which
must flow from that plexus of cable com
munication arc of indispensable import
ance to the commerce of the world.
"As a mere piece of property," con
tinued the "it is of very great
value. It Is a comfortable support for one
and a half millions of people when Hono
lulu shall have become a port of great
importance to commerce. The productive
capacity of the island is most varied. 1
never saw any other country in which t
would prefer to live on account of climate,
scenery and great variety of products. So
that in looking over the advantages which
Hawaii will bring to the United States 1
can see to my own satisfaction at least
that they are numerous and great, and
when we come to consider the disadvan
tages I can conceive of none."
"How about admitting the Japanese
contract laborers in competition with
white laborers?" was asked.
"In its demand for labor as an agricul
tural country." replied the Senator, "the
proper plan of acquiring labor there is
from families who engage in agriculture
under some of its forms. The public
lands of Hawaii furnish the most induce
ments and incentives for poor men and
their families to locate there, these In
ducements being greater than those of
any other country that 1 know of. The re
mit will be that the islands will fill up

with white people who will make com
fortable homes where they will raise
fruit, coffee and other articles of export,
me labor In the cities will be necessarily
of a migratory character, such as skilled
artisans, bricklayers, stonemasons, car
penters, etc. Contract labor, of course,
will have to disappear, but we will give
those people their rights. It is evident
that importing labor to sugar plantations j
und other industries must stop. So far as
the Japanese are concerned they have a
right to go there as they have a right to
come here. We legislate' against the Chi
nese in the United States, and that bar
rier will operate against them in Hawaii
as it does here. The Hawaiian Govern
ment has prohibited their importation."
"How about the Japanese laborers now
there working on contracts?" was asked.
"As I understand it," replied Senator
Morgan, "although I will not be positive
that it is the fact, these contracts pro
vide that the Japanese at the end of the
terms of their contracts will be returned
home. But they are entitled to their
rights under those contracts, and they
will he allowed to work them out. Annex
ation does not annul any private con
tracts. It abrogates treaties made be
tween Hawaii and other powers. So the
Japanese will be allowed to work under
the contract system until the expiration
of the existing contracts."
"Will all those persons who are now
citizens of Hawaii be made citizens of
the United States also by annexation?"
"Yes." replied the Senator. "All those
persons who are now citizens of Hawaii
will become citizens of the United States
by annexation."
The party will leave for Honolulu on
the 10th of* this month on the Mariposa,
and will remain in the islands a month
or six weeks making their Investigations.
To-morrow evening the Union League
Club will entertain the commission.
SHOT BY HIS COUSIN.
Wong Kirn Chee, a Restaurant Keep
er, Seriously Wounded at a
Theater.
Wong Kirn Chee, who owns a restau
rant at 29 Waverly place, was shot In the
back by his cousin, Wong Ah Due, at the
Jackson-street Theater last evening. The
shooting will probably be the Deglnnlng
of a family feud, as relatives of the men
say If the wounded Chinaman dies there
will be no need for a trial, as Wong Ah
Due will be killed.
The shooting took place about 11:30
o'clock and Officers Peters and Fowle,
who were on the corner of Kearny and
Washington streets, hearing the shot im
mediately rushed to the theater. They
had some trouble In gaining an entrance,
as the place was crowded and friends of
the would-be murderer blocked the way
until he escaped through a back door.
The wounded man was removed to the
Harbor Hospital, where Doctors Hill and
Zabala dressed the injury. The ball,
which was from a 41-caliber Colts re
volver, is lodged in the muscles of the
back.
When asked to write down the name of
his assailant Wong Kirn Chee refused to
do so. but asked that his friend, Wong
Yen Kee. a restaurant keeper on Clay
street, be called. Wong Sam, another
cousin of the wounded Chinaman, gave I
the information to the police as to the |
name of the man who did the shooting.
He said that he did not know just what
the trouble between the two cousins was.
but he knew that there had been two :
other quarrels during the day. Wong
Ah Due, according to Wong Sam, is a
highbinder and has been thirsting for,
blood for some time.
The police have a good description of
WoÃg Ah Due and expect to have him
in the prison within a short time.
Wong Kirn Chee's wound win probably
be fatal.

THE WONDERFUL
"VENTRILOPHONE"
EDWARD BELLAMY'S PROPHECS
IS FINALLY FULFILLED.
An Augmented Telephone Which Dis
tinctly Throws the Various
Sounds Into All Parts
of a Boom.
The prophecy of Edward Bellnmy in his
famous socialistic novel "Looking Back
ward" has been fulfilled, in one partic
ular at least, before the dawn of the
twentieth century; and notwithstanding
all the inventive genius that has been
devoted to the working out of the diffi
cult problem, it has remained for a San
Franciscan to solve it. The invention
is called the ventrilophone.
It is an amplification of the telephone,
and by its use the ear-piece required in
the telephone is obviated and the neces
sity of using the hands during conver
sation is removed. In other words, the
Imagination of Bellamy has become a
reality, as speech over the ventrilophone
is made clearly audible in all parts of
the room and when the house is quiet
can be heard in an adjoining apartment
with the connecting doorÂ» closed.
Sound Is received from a disc some

Her Husband.
eight inches In diameter against the wall,
but so perfect is the vibration that it ap
parently comes from a person invisible
at that end of the room. The ventrilo
phone is different In principle from thÂ«
telephone, which reduces the volume or
sound and merely mimics the voice to a
limited extent, whereas the ventrilophone
can be made to fully equal the voice if
desired. It can be used in conjunction
with or Independent of the telephone, as
may be desired.
No bell is necessary, as a call is as
audible to occupants of the room as if
the person speaking were present. People
who are prevented from using the tele
phone on account of slight deafness have
no trouble whatever in working" the ven
trilophone several feet distant.
This remarkable Instrument, which em
bodies In its mechanism the vibratory
qualities of the banjo, guitar and organ,
is simple in construction and takes up
about the same space on the wall as a
telephone. Unlike the "hello" machine,
however, conversation can be carried on
at several feet distance from the new
talk transmitter.
Aside from its value for business pur
poses it fulfills the Bellamy prophecy in
that through its strange powers one can
sit at home and enjoy the music of con
cert or opera and receive the full volume
and value of the tones. It is a wonderful
creation and the possibilities of its im
provement are almost boundless.
The inventor is A. C. Robbins, a well
known electrician of this city, connected
with the Automatic Fire Alarm Com-
pany. He will leave for Chicago in a
few days to arrange for placing the ven
trilophone on the market.
SHE INHERITED A
SUICIDAL MANIA
MRS. COWING KILLS HERSELF
AFTER SIX ATTEMPTS.
Three Members of Her Family Before
Her Put an End to Their
Lives.
Mrs. E. Cowing, who resided at 464
Bryant street, committed suicide yester
day by taking carbolic acid, and her hus
band can give no reason for her act ex
cept that she was from a family afflicted
with a suicidal mania.
W. B. Cowin, the husband of the dead
woman, owns a grocery at 931% Folsom
street which he purchased about three
weeks ago when he came here from New
York. He says that the grandmother,
uncle and sister of his wife all killed
themselves with no apparent motive. Mrs.
Cowing was of a very nervous tempera
ment and has tried to end her life six
times before the successful attempt of
yesterday.
â  The carbolic acid was taken about 11
o'clock in the morning, and when Mrs.
Cowing was discovered she appeared to
be dying. Dr. E. W. Thomas was called
in and succeeded In keeping the woman
alive until 4 o'clock in the afternoon,
when she passed away.
Mrs. Cowing was 37 years of age and
was born in Illinois, where her husband
married her. She had no children.

TRAGIC SELF
DESTRUCTION
Remorse Caused Her
to Commit Suicide.
STOOD BEFORE A MIRROR
HER BODY FOUND IN A ROOM
BATHED IN BLOOD.
Accused of Misconduct by Her Hus
band, She Fires a Bullet Into
Her Head â The Man's
Statement.
Accused by her husband of being too
friendly with another man, Augusta So
phia Rohlfs, a native of Denmark, aged
33 years, coir.mitted suicide last evening
by shooting herself in the head. The deed
was done at 322 McAllister street, whero
the Rohlfs lived.
Shortly after noon yesterday a young
tailor named Simon O. Meier visited the
Rohlfs, intending to spend the afternoon.
He had his wheel with him, and as Rohlfs
was feeling restless he suggested that he
take his bicycle and go for a spin through
the Park. Rohlfs accepted the offer, and
was gone for several hours.
As he returned and entered the room
in which were Meier and Mrs Rohlfa he
noticed that the latter was laboring under
some great mental excitement. Meier did
not attempt to offer an explanation, but
looked rather sheepishly at the indignant
husband.
Rohlfs Immediately left the room, but
returned In a few minutes to find Meier
gone. More convinced than ever that his
suspicions were correct Rohlfs, in a
paroxysm of rage, demanded of his wife
to tell him what had happened.
As did not reply, Rohlfs, who was
scarcely able to control his temper, again
left the room to "cool off," as he ex
pressed it. He walked from the house
along McAllister to Polk. Determined to
compel his wife to speak Rohlfs returned
and as he was about entering the room
he was startled by a pistol shot.
Not thinking that his wife had shot her
self he summoned the landlady, and they
proceeded to make an investigation. In
the meantime one of the roomers in the
house, suspecting that Mrs. Rohlfs had
Bhot herself, tried to open the door of
her room, but found It locked from the
inside. Throwing his shoulder against
the door he succeeded in forcing it. As
he entered he discovered Mrs. Rohlfs
lying on the floor, her head resting
against the bureau. There was a gaping
wound on the right side of her head, and
in her hand she tightly held a cheap
bulldog revolver with one chamber empty.
From the nature of the wound it is sup
posed that death was instantaneous.
On a table in the room were two empty
glasses, which had contained beer. There
was also a large piece of cheese and sev
eral slices of bread, showing that the
couple were having a "spread" while
Rohlfs was enjoying himself with Meier's
wheel in Golden Gate Park.
Rohlfs was heart broken when he was
told that his wife was the victim of the
shot he had heard.
"It's too bad," he moaned. "I didn't
think poor Augusta would do such a
rash act. That fellow, Meier, who I
Bupposod was my friend, is the cause of
it. He had me take hiÃ wheel out to the
park, and when 1 returned he sneaked
out of the house without even saying |
good-by to me.
"His actions made me suspicious, and
j when my wife refused to offer any ex
planation I became convinced that some
thing was wrong."
Meier became acquainted with Mrs.
Rohlfs some time ago. They both worked
in a tailoring establishment on Mission
street, and seemed to be on very friendly
terms.
Rohlfs says he bought the pistol with
which his wife killed herself several
I weeks ago. She feared that burglars
' would enter the house, and to be pre
| pared for them she induced her husband
i to buy the weapon.
Meier declares that he is innocent of the
i imputation cast upon him by Rohlfs, and
. claims that his relations with Mrs. Rohlfs
were purely platonic.

The Swedish-American Society Gives
Its Annual Picnic at Harbor
View.
The fifth annual outing of the Swedish-
American Benevolent and Military Soci
ety, under the auspices of the uniform
rank, K. G. 8. , was held at Seaside Gar
dens yesterday. The committee, consist-
Ing of Captain N. H. Olson, chairman;
D. Molander, A. M. Wallen, Charles E.
Johnson and E. A. Wallen, did every
thing in its power to make the affair a
success.
An address was delivered by Captain
OJson In the afternoon in which Ameri
can patriotism was overflowing 1 . The
principal feature of the day was in the
representation of Admiral Dewey's victory
In .the harbor of Cavite. It took place on
the water of the bay. A miniature fort
was erected with three boats flying the
Spanish colors snugly at anchor lying in
the shelter of the fort at the time that
Dewey arrived with his five American
warships, which were manned by Julies
Peirson, as Admiral Dewey on board the
Olympla: Captain A. M. Wallen of the
Baltimore; Captain E. M. Wallen
of the Raleigh; Captain Charles
Ringberg of the Concord, and
Captain P. Brown of the Boston.
Gus Anderson had the inglorious honor of
representing the Spanish admiral, while
Charles Anderson and Charles J. H. Berg
were the unfortunate captains of the
three Spanish men-of-war whirh were de
stroyed In Manila Bay. The arrival of
the American ships was the signal for
the Spanish fort to open fire. This was
followed by the Spanish ships. Then the
batteries from Pncle Sam's marine de
stroyers were let loose, and in a few min
utes" only the smoking ruins of the Span
ish fort and ships remained.
