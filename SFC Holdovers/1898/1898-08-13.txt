Secretary Day and Embassador Cambon were affixed this
Evening to the protocol defining the basis for the final ne

groundless, as it was not until 12:30 |

â  courtesies, without unnecessary loss of
time Assistant Secretary of State Crid
:' lor 'on the part of the United States,
: ' and First Secretary Thiebaut, on the
â¢part of Spain, retired to a window,
â¢ where there was a critical formal ex
. "'aminatinn of the protocol. This inspec
: tlon had all the outward formalities
" due a document of this importance. It
â¢ was prepared in duplicate at the State
Department, one copy to be retained
â¢ by the United States Government and
â¢ the other to be the property of Spain.
The San Francisco Call
The text is handsomely engrossed in a
running old English script. Each copy j
of the protocol is arranged in double j
columns, French and English standing (
alongside for easy comparison as to j
the exactness of translation. The two
copies are alike, ' except that the one
held by this Ckr\ ernmenr~n&s the Eng
lish text in the first column and the
signature of Secretary Day ahead of
that of M. Cambon, while the copy
transmitted to Spain has French in the
first column and the signature of M.
Cambon ahead of that of Secretary
Day.
The protocol sent to Spain was ac
companied by the ciedentials issued by
President McKinley specially empower
ing the Secretary of State to affix his
signature to the document. The au
thorization was brief and in typewrit
ing, save for the President's character- \
istic bold signature. Later the Ameri
can copy of the protocol will be accom
panied by the written credentials of the
Spanish Government sent to M. Cam- ;
bon and bearing the signature of Queen
Christina.
The cable dispatch received by M.
Cambon to-day conferred full author
ity to sign the protocol and stated that
the written authorization would follow,
signed by the Queen Regent in the
name of the King. Prior to the cere
mony of to-day jM. Thiebaut showed
the cable dispatch to Secretary Day,
and it was accepted as sufficient to en
able the Embassador to sign on behalf
of Spain. When the written authoriza
tion arrives it will be presented to the
State Department to accompany the
protocol.
The examination of the protocol was
j satisfactory and the document was
handed to M. Cambon first and then to
Mr. Day, who affixed signatures in
! that order to each side of the two cop
ies. Then the last detail in making the
protocol binding was administered by
Assistant Secretary Cridler, in charge
of the chancery work, who attached the
seal of the United States.
Throughout the ceremony all but the
two signers remained standing. M.
Cambon, in signing for Spain, occupied
the seat which Secretary of the Navy
Long, now away on a vacation, usually
occupied.
The President stood at the left-hand
corner, at the head of the great Cabinet
table; Secretary Day, M. Thiebaut and
M. Cambon, in the order named, on the
left side of the table. The rest of the
party were standing in other portions
of the room.
No credentials were produced during
the meeting at the White House, the
President accepting Secretary Day's as
surance that this had been settled to
his satisfaction at the State Depart
ment.
It was 4:23 o'clock when the final sig
natures were attached to the protocol,
and, within the knowledge of all offi
cials present, this was the first time
that a treaty or protocol had been
signed at the White House.
As this ceremony was concluded,
Acting Secretary Allen of the Navy
Department, Secretary Alger and Ad
jutant General Corbin appeared, hav
ing been summoned to the White House
by the President, and they were admit
ted into the Cabinet room, Just in sea
son to witness one of the most Impres
sive features of the ceremony, when
the President requested the hand of the
Embassador and through him returned
thanks to the sister republic of France
for the exercise of her good offices in
bringing about peace. . . <
â  He also thanked the Embassador per
sonally for the important part he has
played in this matter, and the latter
replied in suitable terms. As a further
mark of his disposition President Mc-
Kinley called for 1 the proclamation
which he had caused to be drawn up
suspending hostilities and signed it in
the presence of M. Cambon, who , ex
pressed his appreciation of the action.
BAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, AUGUST 13, 1898.
SIGNING' OF THE PROTOCOL OF PEACE IN THE CABINET ROOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION
SUSPENDING HOSTILITIES
WASHINGTON, August 12.â The President has issued the following proclamation :
By the President of the United States.
A PROCLAMATION.
WHEREAS, A protocol, concluded and signed August 12, 1898, by William R, Day,
Secretary of State of the United States, and his excellency, Jules Cambon, Embassador
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the republic of France at Washington, respectively
representing for this purpose the Government of the United States and the Government
of Spain, the United States and Spain have formally agreed upon the terms on which
negotiations for the establishment of peace between the two countries shall be under
taken; and
WHEREAS, It is in said protocol agreed that upon its conclusion and signature hos
tilities between the two countries shall be suspended and notice to that effect shall be
given as soon as possible by each Government to the commanders of its military and
naval forces.
Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States, do, in accord
ance with the stipulations of the protocol, declare and proclaim on the part of the United
States a suspension of hostilities, and do hereby command that orders be immediately
given through the proper channels to the commanders of the military and naval forces
of the United States to abstain from all acts inconsistent with this proclamation.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United
States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this twelfth day of August, in the year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and of the independence of the United
States the one hundred and twenty-third. WILLIAM McKINLEY.
By the President:
WILLIAM R, DAY, Secretary of State.
A copy of the proclamation has been cabled to our army and navy commanders.
Spain will cable her commanders like instructions.
Without delay Acting Secretary Allen
hastened to the telephone and directed
that "cable messages toe immediately
sent to all naval commanders, Dewey in
the Philippines, Sampson at Guanta
namo and the other commandants at
navy yards and stations to cease hos
tilities immediately.
There is also a dispatch-boat at
Hongkong, and it is believed it can
reach General Merrltt in forty-eight
hours at top speed.
On the part of the army, while Secre
tary Alger availed himself of the tele
graph, Adjutant General Corbln braved
the storm and rushed across to the
War Department, where he immediate
ly issued the orders which had been
prepared in advance, to all of the mili
tary commanders, to cease their opera
tions. The State Department fulfilled
its duty by notifying all diplomatic and
consular agents of the action taken.
All the formalities having been dis
posed of, the President spent half an
hour chatting with those present, and
then, at 4:58. the rain still continuing
in force, the Embassador and his secre
tary entered their carriage and were
driven to the embassy.
The pen which was used by Secretary
Day in signing the protocol was given
to Chief Clerk Michael of the State De
partment, who had bespoken it. M.
Thiebaut secured that used by the
French Embassador.
Upon emerging from the White Housa
Secretary Day received the earnest,
congratulations of the persons present
upon the conclusion of the pro
tocol. He stated that the peace com
missioners who are to draw up the defi
nitive treaty would not be appointed
for several days, but declined to indi
cate who they would be.
A TIDAL WAVE FOR
PEACE AT ANY PRICE
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, Aug. 12.â The wave in fa
vor of peace at any price has assumed
tidal proportions. Nothing can stop it.
As a statesman said to-day: "There
is not a political man in Spain strong
enough to dare suggest a continuation
of the war."
To-night all comment is upon Senor
Sagasta's political triumph and Moret
as the coming man. The court is mak
ing arrangement for going to San Se
bastian and the Ministers to their fa
vorite resorts.
ORDERS ISSUED TO
NAVAL COMMANDERS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12.â 1n accord
ance with the proclamation issued by
the President suspending hostilities or

commanders at the several stations in
the United States, Cuba and the Phil
ippines carrying into effect the direc

Department not only transmitted the
President's proclamation in full to the
several commanders-in-chief, but also
directions as to the disposition of their
vessels.
The following orders are in that sense
self-explanatory:

SHAFTER RECEIVES
THE PROCLAMATION
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12.â At 11
o'clock to-night Adjutant General Cor
bin received from General Shafter an
acknowledgment of the receipt by him
of the proclamation of the President.
Up to midnight no reply has been re
ceived from General Miles, it having
been impossible to get into communica
tion with him.
In response to the notification sent
to General Fitzhugh Lee, the former
Consul General at Havana wired the
War Department: "Thanks; the Sev
enth Corps has ceased firing. Unoffi
cial."
It is well understood that General
Lee's command was being reserved
for the attack on Havana, if the neces
sity for one should arise. As an official
of the War Department expressed it
to-night. "It was a bit of the sarcasm
of fate that Lee did not have a part in
the active operations in Cuba or Porto
Rico."
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The text of General Shatter's reply is
as follows:
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. Aug. 12.âAdjut
ant General. Washington: Received mes
sage as to peace negotiations being about
concluded. Will notify Spanish at Hol
gutn by courier to-morrow and Manzanillo
and Cienfuegos by wire, and will try to
get- Havana. Will also notify all Cuban
Forces I can reach. SHAFTER.
A SPANISH NOTE
ON THE PROTOCOL
MADRID, Aug. 12, 10 a. m.â The
question of the acceptance of the pro
tocol having been finally settled and it 3
signature explicitly and definitely au
thorized, the Government is now con
sidering the domestic situation for the
best means of allaying the excitement
and propagating the idea that Spain's
surrender is not so complete as indicat
ed by the bald terms of the protocol. As
the first/step in this direction, a semi
official tote has been issued. It is as
follows:
"The Government is of the opinion
that the most critical period of the
peace negotiations has now arrived, as
it depends upon the arrangement of
details as to whether the peace will be
more or less advantageous. Spain
wishes to preserve her sovereignty over

AMERICAN NAVY'S
RANKING OFFICER
YIELDS TO DEATH
Passing of Rear Admiral Kirkland
From the Effects of an
Operation,
Summoned on the Day When the Dawn of
Peace Would Have Permitted His
Retirement.
VALLEJO, Aug. 12 âThe death of '
Rear Admiral Kirkland. which oc- ;
curred at his home at Mure Island
at 7 o'clock this evening, closes a no- ;
table career. Up to the 2d of last
month he was the ranking officer of the
United States navy and on that day he
was entitled to retire, having served ;
forty-eight years under the flag. The '
necessities of war bade otherwise, how- j
ever, and the admiral was retained on
duty at Mare Island, though he had \
often expressed the wish that peace ;
â would come, that he might be relieved j
end obtain the rest which he so richly
deserved. This was not to be, and his
splendid career was closed by death
on the very day when peace was as
sured and his rest was in sight. It is j
a strange coincidence, but a fitting 1 end j
for the noble old seamaoi whose life j
had been given to the Government.
The patient rested more easily last
night than at any time since the oper
ation was performed early in the week,
and Dr. Hibbett, who had been with
him, believed that he would recover, i
Evidence of exhaustion developed dur^
ing the morning and was quite pro- |
nounced at 1 o'clock this afternoon. |
when Drs. Waggener and Hibbett made j
a careful examination. At 2 o'clock it j
was evident to the surgeons that dis- j
solution was near, and the family was I
notified to prepare for the worst.
Mrs. Kirkland, the admiral's son and i
daughter, W. A. Kirkland Jr. and Mrs. ;
Quackenbush, were called, and remain- '
ed at his bedside until the end. Rev. |
Father Thompson was summoned from
Vallejo, and the dying man was given
the last sacraments of the Catholic i
church.
At 5 o'clock he became unconspious,
apparently relapsing into peaceful
sleep. He continued to breathe easily
and apparently without pain until 7
o'clock, when he passed away without
a struggle.
The funeral probably will take place
on Sunday from St. Vincent's Church
in this city. The remains will be placed
temporarily in a vault and later will
be shipped to Brooklyn, N. V., where
they will be finally interred.
Admiral Kirkland was one of nature's
noblemen, and his death is a loss to
the country. He was the ranking offi
cer in the navy and was very popular
: "with all his subordinates. He was a
typical seaman â frank and open-heart
ed and always a true and faithful pub
lic servant. During the war he has
been continually at his desk, and the
strain upon his system, together with
his advanced age, tended to weaken
his once splendid physique, and <he
exhaustion due to a severe operation
was more than he could stand.
CAREER OF REAR
ADMIRAL KIRKLAND
Saw Service as Midshipman on the
California Coast in the Early
Fifties.
William A. Kirkland was born in
North Carolina 62 years ago. He enter
ed Annapolis in 1850, and after gradu
ating made his first cruise on the sloop
of-war Portsmouth, which was attach
ed to the Pacific squadron. Thus young
Kirkland, as a midshipman, saw service
on the California coast and in the har
bor of San Francisco before the navy
yard at Mare Island was established.
During the years following his experi
ence in the navy was as uneventful as
usual in times of peace. "When the war
broke out he was a lieutenant and at
tached to the steamer Pulaski, off the
Brazil coast.
The following year he was promoted
to lieutenant commander and assigned
to the Jamestown in the China station.
In 1864 he was commanding the ironclad
"Winnebago, in the Western Gulf squad
ron. He took part in the movements
against Mobile, which resulted in the
capture of that city. In 1869 he was com
missioned commander and in 1880 pro
moted to captain. In 1893 he became a
commodore and two years later a rear
admiral. In June, 1896, he was assigned
to the command of Mare Island. When
the present war broke out he Avas the
ranking rear admiral in the navy,
which position he continued to hold
until the 3d of July last, when by the
age limit he went on the retired list.
He was continued in the command of
Mare Island, however, under special
order of the President up to the time of
his death.
Rear Admiral Kirkland was the last
of the class of the naval academy of
1850 to retire from active service. Of
the twenty-one graduates with Kirk
land only Rear Admirals Beardsley,
Carpenter, Potter, Ramsey and Walker
remain, and they have all been on the
retired list for some time.
In the earlier days of the navy up to
the war of the Rebellion the midship
men spent most of their time at sea.
and the apprenticeship as officers and
subsequent junior service was chiefly in
cruising vessels, and this accounts for
the many years of. sea service which
the older officers have as a rule to
their credit, and Kirkland headed
all of his class with a record of 23 years
9 months at sea out of a total service of
47 years and 11 months.
Kirkland's first war experience was
at the age of 27 years, as lieutenant
commander, and serving as navigating
officer of the United States steam sloop
Wyoming under the command of Com
mander David McDougal, when that
gallant officer engaged the batteries
and armed vessels at Slmonosaki, Ja
pan, in July, 1863, and gave the Japa
nese rebels a wholesome lesson. Of the
officers' shipmates with Kirkland, only
Pay Inspector George Cochrane and
Chief Engineer Philip Inch are yet liv
ing and in active service. Returning
home he served with credit through the
war, and at its conclusion solicited and
readily obtained sea service on the
South Atlantic station, and where he
lmost constantly served for nearly 20
ears. His only sea service away from
.Montevideo and its attractions was
while in command of the Europeon sta
tion from April 30, 1894, to November 12,
1895. The usual period of command is
two years, but Kirkland and the Demo
cratic administration did not harmon
ize; there was nothing of a diplomat
about Kirkland, and his bluff, honest
candor was not what Cleveland and his
Cabinet wanted in dealing with the
Turks and Armenians. The admiral
made himself obnoxious to the mission
aries, whom he is said to have called
"a bad lot." This alleged unparlia
mentary and undiplomatic remark,
coupled with rumors of his uncourte
ous behavior toward Emperor William
at the Kiel canal festivities, gave his
enemies in the Navy Department an
opportunity to cause his recall. The
incident with the Kaiser is said to have
occurred when the Emperor expressed
the wish of his brother to visit the flag
ship Chicago. When the request was
made known to Kirkland he replied,
'Well, trot him along; I'll be glad to see
him."
While it is highly improbable that
Admiral Kirkland should forget the
courtesy due to a crowned head it is on
the other hand characteristic of the
man. His language was usually forci
ble, and it was impossible to misunder
stand his meaning. His direct way of
getting at matters and in expressing
his views were startling to people
whose nerves were in a weak state or
whose life had been spent in Washing
ton, where straightforwardness is any
thing but likely to make an officer pop
ular.
The fact was that Kirkland hated any
roundabout way, that he despised tem
porizing, and had a contempt for sham,
and wherever he discovered it was
quick to let the offender know that he
was found out. He wss entirely im
partial in his intercourse with people
of all classes, and officers and enlisted
men, as well as civilians, were all treat
ed in the same way. Yet he was liked
by all who came in contact with him
and who did not attempt to impose
upon him. No doubt there are some who
would prefer to be out of his reach and
control, and that civil engineer at
League Island, of whom Kirkland said
that "he," the civil engineer, "was the
d st fool he had ever seen, is prob
ably one of Kirkland's non-admirers.
He had very little shore duty at navy
yards, the only notable one being on the
receiving ship Vermont, at the New
York yard, 1887-88. It was while there
that he got himself disliked by the poli
ticians for restricting the indiscrimin
ate use of the yard ferry boat by all
sorts of people, and Bill Frey, Ned Ca
hill and other Democratic leaders got
even on him by having him transferred.
His last cruise closed in Novenmber,
1895, and he has had command of the
Mare Island Navy Yard since July,
1896. On July 3 last he was retired for
age, but continued on active duty.
Sixty-two years of age to a man like
Kirkland, with a splendid physique and
carefully tended body and mind, was
less perceptible than fifty years to
many other officers, and but for his en
emy â rheumatism â he would have made
a record as a fighting officer at retiring
age second to no younger one in the
service.

"In regard to the evacuation of Cuba

and in Washington.
The commission to meet in the West
Indies will be composed, it is under

pave the way for commercial treaties
and for the recognition by the United
States or Cuba of a portion of the Cu

The suggestion that Senor Moret, for

very popular. Various names are men

been settled as to this.
Senor Sagasta has again assured the
Queen Regent that he does not fear
Carlist trouble, and the Carlists them
selves appear to recognize that the
country is not in the temper that would
support a Carlist rising. They are
speculating on the return of the dis
contented army, hoping for mischief
then.
PEACE COMMISSIONERS
NOT YET DECIDED UPON
NEW YORK, Aug. 12.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following': President McKin
ley is not yet ready to announce the
peace commissioners. He haa practi
cally selected five men who will repre
sent the United States on the joint
commission, but he is still waiting to
hear definitely from some of them as
to whether It will be possible for them
to accept before announcing their

SAYS THE FIGHT WILL
NOT BE PREVENTED
BUFFALO, Aug. 12.â Charles M. Wil
son, manager and secretary of the
Hawthorne Athletic Club, said to-day
that he would continue to make pre
parations for the Corbett-McCoy con
test regardless of the letter read at the
ministers' meeting yesterday, in which
the Sheriff declared his Intention to
stop the fight.
Mr. Wilson said that he had antici
pated Just such a fuss and had secured
the best legal advice in New York and
this city, and added that in not one
instance had his club violated a law,
nor did it intend to violate any. He
said that theÂ»fluestion had been aired
in court, and that no lawyer would be
foolish enough to fight the case over
again. The only harm that could come
to the club was that a few out-of-town
people might be scared away. No ef
fort will be made to evade the law. It
is not necessary, Mr. Wilson says.

the Governor.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 12.â The Ori
ental steamer Victoria arriving here to
day brings the following Oriental ad
vices: A Japanese paper prints a story
to the effect that the Americans at
Guam found a number of unburied
corpses. The Governor innocently ex
plained they were bodies of prisoners
sent him from Manila. Provisions were
short and some 150 of them were or
dered out to be shot as the easiest way
out of the difficulty.
NOYO'S CAPTAIN DIES AT SEA.
Steamer Arrives at Seattle With Her

SEATTLE, Aug. 12.â The steam schoon

Michael with her flag at half mast, in
dicating the death of her captain, H.
Edgett, who died at sea of Brlght's dis
ease. He was buried at Unalaska. The
Noyo had about thirty passengers, twenty

Wielding Axes.
RAILWAY PROPERTY RAZED
SOUTHERN PACIFIC OFFERING
NO RESISTANCE.
Agent Treadwell Seeks the Assist

General to Oust the
Owners of Wells.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 12â The
destruction of the Southern Pacific
Company's property at Summerland
continues. This morning what few
piles remained to J. B. Treadwell. the
Southern Pacific Company's agent, on
the beach, were chopped down by men
employed by the riparian owners. They
are constantly on the watch and every
thing: that the Southern Pacific Com
pany puts up on the land in front of
their property destroyed.
This morning men were employed by
William Moore chopping down all piles
placed in front of his wells. No re
sistance was offered by Tread well's
men, though it was expected, and the
riparian owners were ready for any
that might come.
No arrests have been made thus far,
although threats of such procedure
have been made. The local attorney for
the Southern Pacific Company followed
Treadwell, who left yesterday, to San
Francisco. Treadwell is supposed to
have gone ot obtain reinforcements
from the Attorney General. The plan
of the corporation seems to be twofold:
First, to get the Attorney General to
give the company authority to run over
State tide lands across Summerland's
front; second, to get him to institute
proceedings in the name of the people
to drive out the persons owning beach
wells, under a shadowy claim that H.
L. Williams, the founder of Summer
land and the man who first developed
the oil industry in this region, gave the
beach as a street, though it is impas
sable a great part of the time and is
separated from Summerland by pre
cipltious bluffs. This attempt is a mere
bluff on the part of the Southern Pacific
Company and cannot ultimately suc
ceed.
The affair is being talked of on the
streets and in the clubs, and general
indignation is expressed at this high
handed proceeding of a grasping cor
poration.
At a late hour this afternoon there
remained no property belonging to the
Southern Pacific Company on the beach
or State lands, and what seemed to be
peace prevailed. The next move of the
corporation will be watched with much
interest, both by citizens of Summer
land and Santa Barbara.
OFFICERS AND OUTLAWS
IN A RUNNING FIGHT
Deputy Sheriff and Bandit Slain in a
Battle Near Breckin
ridge, Cola.
DENVER, Aug. 12.â A special to the
Republican from Breckinridge, Colo.,
says: A well-planned hold-up took
place here in the Denver Hotel, but
owing to the alarm caused by the acci
dental discharge of a shotgun held by
one of the three robbers, their move
ments were so hurried that they did not
go through the safe or cash regrister,
and only secured about $50 in money
from a till, several gold watches and
other jewelry.
This afternoon Sheriff Detwiler and a
posse encountered the robbers near
Kokomo and a running fight took place.
One of the robbers, Steve Ryan, ig re
ported killed, and another, Dick Man
ley, badly wounded. Charles Ryan was
captured by the posse and another man
by the name of Ryan, suspected of
being implicated in the robbery, Is still
at large, but is being pursued by the
posse.
Ex-Deputy Sheriff M. E. Conrad, one
of the posse, was killed in the fight, and
Sumner Whitney, another member,
was seriously wounded. Conrad for
merly resided in Pennsylvania, where
his parents are now.
Reports received here ai midnierht
are to the effect that small bodies of
armed men are coming into Kokomo
from the neighboring camps for the
purpose of lynching Manley should his
wounds not prove fatal.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 12. â The
steamer Victoria, arriving to-day from
China, brings news that the three re
bellions in progress within the empire
are still spreading, with prospects of
â ~'i H V" -â¢â â¢-'' cuiisociuences to the Peking
Government. The most formidable re
bellion is in Kwangsi Province, around
Wuchow. Another embraces the Chihli
and Shantung provinces, while Saech
uan is disturbed by a third.
Shanghai received news late in July
that riots had commenced in Szechuan,
being directed against foreigners and
the Peking Government. The American,
English and French missions in that
province had been attacked and several
native Christians killed. Father Freu
ry. head of the French missions, was
carried into captivity by the notorious
brigand Sumanzu and 4000 armed fol
lowers. The French mission offered
10,000 taels ransom, but the brigands
want more.
Riots and disturbances have occurred
at eleven towns in Kwangsi Province.
The magistrate at Paklauo offered a
reward for the capture of the rebel
chieftain in that neighborhood. The
chief immediately captured the magis
trate, poured kerosene over him and set
fire to it. His family was butchered
and flung into the river. Two magis
trates are shut up in Yung Un, which
the rebels have besieged. If captured
they will be burned.
Komuk, the celebrated Chinese gen
eral sent against the rebels of Kwangsi,
has killed 400 of them. Many of their
mutilated corpses have been floating
down West River past Wuchow, whose
local Council offers a reward for each
rebel's body recovered. Wuchow is ter
rorized despite General Kom's success
and trade with disturbed districts has
stopped. In fact the rebels are permit
ting no boats to leave Wuehow's sub
urbs. Below Wuchow traffic is almost
suspended because of pirates, who- have
lately captured two vessels. All rich
men are sending their families out of
Wuchow.
FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO

George Lawson Johnstone Threatens
the Promotor and Has to
Apologize in Court.
LONDON, Aug. 12.â When the exam
ination of Ernest T. Hooley, the com
pany promoter. In bankruptcy proceed
ings was resumed to-day, Mr. Hooley, who
has been suffering from sickness, unex
pectedly attended in spite of his physi
cian's order and created an intense sen
sation by Informing the Registrar that,
while entering court, George Lawson
Johnstone, a son of John Lawson John
stone of Kingwood, Kent, approached
him, drew him to one side and said:
"If you say a.nything further about us
I shall enter the witness box and state
what I know about your wife's funds."
Mr. Hooley added: "I cut him across
the head with a stick."
The Registrar thereupon directed Mr.
Hooley and his counsel to forthwith pro
ceed to Justice Wright's court and to
enter a charge of contempt against Mr.
Johnstone.
Before the court adjourned George
Lawson Johnstone entered the witness box
and apologized for the incident earlier in
the day. After the apology the Registrar
allowed the matter to drop.

BOMBARDMENT OF
MANZANILLO BY
SAMPSON'S SHIPS
Fight Reported to Have Occurred
Just Before Peace Articles
Were Signed.
NEW YORK, Aug. 12.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald-telegraphs: Acording to Secretary Allen, the Navy Department
received a dispatch to-night notifying him that the naval force sent
by Admiral Samnson had appeared in the harbor of Manzanillo and
demanded its surrender. The commandant of the city declined to com
ply with the demand, and an engagement took place, which is said to
have resulted in a victory for the Americans.
The fight at Manzanillo was begun at 4 o'clock, twenty-three min
utes before the protocol was signed, by a bombardment by the fleet.
It was reported to-night that marines have been landed, but the dis
patches received by General Greely from the Signal Office at Playa
del Este make no such statement.
At the Navy Department it is said that the only vessels at Man
zanillo are some small blockading ships, which could not have con
ducted the operations described in the message. It is said Admiral
Sampson is at Guantanamo and that Captain Goodrich, with the
Newark, Scorpion and Suwanee, is in the vicinity of the Isle of Pines
and that therefore neither of those officers could have had any
thing to do with the engagement.
In view of the signing of the protocol to-day and the suspension
of hostilities every effort was made by the authorities to stop the fight
at Manzanillo. A dispatch was sent by Adjutant General Corbin to
Santiago directing General Shafter to get into communication with
Manzanillo as soon as possible and inform the naval commanders
there that hostilities were over. A dispatch was sent by the Navy
Department to Key West also, to be forwarded to Manzanillo, and it
can be confidently stated General Blanco has telegraphed to the Span
ish commander at Manzanillo.

order. In all this work he met with
little tremble. General Schwan, in har
mony with the plans of General Miles,
will now march toward Lares, from
which place he will proceed directly to
Arecibo. General Miles, with General
Stone and General Henry and their di
visions, will meet General Schwan's di

EX-QUEEN LILIUOKALANI of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
BY ALICE RIX.
HONOLULU, Aug. 2. via Victoria,
B <'Â Aug. 12.â A little after
midnight the Gaelic was sighted
off Koko Head and Honolulu
awakened slowly to wbb
hone bells and messenger calls
cal- â vv h'-'-ls and t'.u- h'lnru' coming of
:-. liliuokalani. A little party of royal
ist? with heart? faithful to a lost cause
made all the stir. The rest of Hono-
lulu turned on its pillows and slept
â¢again the sleep of r*'^-c c and satisfied
ties, undisturbed by melancholy
.dreams of a Queen's home coming to
. the land no longer hers.
All this is for royalists and natives
to lie awake and to rise between small
: hours' to sadly celebrate.
,"â ':' v was believed the natives would
: .rnak spine demonstration on the ar
rival of the ex-Queen. Annexatlonists
: are fond of saying that the hatchet is
buried, that there are no more royal-
.Jsts; that the easy Hawaiian nature
has accepted the inevitable and in good
. tljne will" cheer the alien flag and join
..in the singing of "America" out of
sheer, joy of cheering over anything.
But in truth the native heart is full of
bjtterness and grief; there are royalists
unnumbered and unsoothftd by the
pteasure of defeat; the hatchet is mere
ly fallen !nt'> powerless hands and
Whatever Time, good Time, may do for
the Hawaiian*, these little weeks have
tx.rne no obvious fruit.
A large class of nativesâ those living
r.n th*- other islands, th- more < hildish
and ig-norant of these at Oahuâ have
â¢ted the fact of annexa
. tior.. 7ears Of convulsive politics have
ated them gradually to an idea of
i â  â¢ nt as a series of shifting con
â¢' .fill-ions in whose final happy adjust
their chiefs would necessarily
'ha;ve part and power. A forlorn hope
..â¢VStaJlMd them that the home coming
of' Liliuokalani might turn destiny
With the instinct of allegiance
chief deep-rooted in the race it
rd for this people to realize the
â¢ urtimportance of a queen. From the
: h. formed of her people the cer
.' ta|nty and the sadness of her new fall
from dignity have brought her a
'boundl'-ss pympcthy, in which her
..faulti â  n :>r<- almost f< rgotton.
Lllluokalani ruled her people neither
>â¢â¢ nor w-ij. Acording to the tra
ditions of a race accustomed to yield
: crice, to recognize the divine right
of kings to rule, a Queen whose obstin
.. Rt-e policy gained a republic for Ha-
YaH and lost Kaiulanl a throne could
. not be called a rood Queen. Friend
and foe and the cold record of their
hot disputes attribute to the mistakes
.of .her reign the hastening of the end.
Hut in the hour of their common
grief her people do not remind her of
her responsibility in the common loss.
There Is no party feeling. There are
ho political interests to divide the sen
tlm.-nts of Hawaiians. It is the heart
of Hawaiians that bleeds. Queen and
commoner mourn the fall of the Ha
waiian flag, and in touching tribute to
..a' chief, in this day when chiefs must
yield, the people set h.-r Morrow before
their own. Stripped of crown, throne,
dignities, title, prospects, she has the
a-loha of their hearts. Her name is
t<j.ok'-n everywhere in love and pity and
respect. Her sa.fe return was asked of
heaven In two tongues and out of a
great anxiety.
The little red fish which herald mis
fortune to royalty have come in schools
Into Honolulu harbor since t"ae sailing
of the Gaelic from San Francisco.
Word has been Rent from the other
islands that the red fish have been seen
about the harbora there. News came
by an earlier steamer that the Queen
had been ill at Washington and again
at Sati Francisco. The native imagina
tion was stirred to its depths of super
stition and the home-coming of Kala
kaua was remembered; but although
Liliuokalani is in ill health and has put
herself at once under the care of phy
sicians, she greeted the faithful who
gathered to welcome her in the flesh
and held a reception to intimate friends
and old retainers immediately on her
arrival at her home in Washington
Place.
The expected demonstration did not
take place at the dock. The crowd,
silent and gloomy, waited a full hour
for the Gaelic to come In, her stacks
and rigging etched upon a silver plain,
her lights burning a dull, copperish
yellow against the white splendor of the
niÂ«ht. The moon was in full â that
great white radiance of the tropics, un
known to northern skies, which casts
its glory over land and sea. All things
reflected its beauty and mystery â the
disorder of the dock, the peace of the
waters, the surf curling on the coral
the great peaks brooding over
Honolulu, tlv clouds that drape them
through the endless summer years. The
ships in the harbor lay like painted
things upon the water, the trade wind
drooped and diÂ»-d, while the tropic night
seemed waiting in breathless peace.
A group of natives, educated to the
Roman faith, but unforgetful of the
little, fateful fish, crossed themselves
piously as i small boat put out toward
th>- ship. It brought back the word that
Liliuokalani was on board and well.
The natives chattered softly among
themselves, obviously relieved by the
news, which was confirmed, before the
Gaelic was well in at the wharf, by the
ex-Queen's p-cretary, a native gentle
man of elaborate manner and resplen
dent clothes. He was recognized at the
rail with a upasm of gaiety from the
shore. It was the only Joyous demon
stration of the night, and short-lived at
that.
The ex-Queen's appearance on the
deck was met with profound silence.
As she came down tho plank, leaning
heavily on Governor Cleghorn's arm,
i you could have heard the proverbial
pin drop on the dock. The stillness was
Infectious. Other passengers landing
at Honolulu, and friends come to meet
them, and persons aboard the steamer
indifferent to the fate of this ex-king
dom and Its ex-Queen, or happily re
joicing in the new American posses
sions and quite on the other side of
things generally, stood mute and mo
tionless, while the little file of the de
feated passed them by; and suddenly
out of the strange stillness in which
even the night joined arose in a long,
low. dreadful cry, gathering strength
and syllables and frightful savage form
until it reached a shuddering chant,
the voice of the waiting, the 011-oli of
the Melee, which is sune. If such
â¢sounds may be called song, at all the
ceremonies of Hawaiian royalty, to cel
ebrate the joys or sorrows of the royal
house; at births, at marriages, deaths,
feasts, dances, meetings and partings.
The effect of it tearing the stillness
of the night, rising single-voiced from
a silent throng, was one to chill the
blood and conjure visions of lost souls
weeping between the worlds.
The waller was a native woman â
old, black. wrinkled and withered.
With lines of mud-colored seeds
and blossoms held about her
throat and dropping from her bare,
gray head, she dane " as she waited â

PROTEST OF HAWAIIANS
AGAINST ANNEXATION
TO THE UNITED STATES
Resolutions to Be Presented to PresideQt Dole ar)d
Minister Sewall Before the Raising of th>e
American Pag-
HONOLULU, Aug. 4 (via Victoria. B. C, Aug. 12).â The following is a copy of the
resolutions of protest to be handed to President Dole and United States Minister Sewall,
prior to the raising of the American Hag. by all the native patriotic and political societies of
Hawaii. It is translated from the Hawaiian:
Whereas, On the 17th day of January, A. D. 1893, our beloved Queen, Liliuokalani,
noted a protest against the acts of the representatives of the United States of America, in
form as follows:
"I, Liliuokalani, by the grace of God and under the constitution of the Hawaiian
kingdom Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself
and the constitutional Government of the Hawaiian kingdom by certain persons claiming to
have established a provisional Government of and for this kingdom. That I yield to the
superior force of the United States of America, whose Minister Plenipotentiary, his Excel
lency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and de
clared that he would support the said provisional Government. Now, to avoid another col
lision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life, I do, under this protest and impelled by
said force, yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall,
upon the facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representatives and reinstate me
in the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian kingdom";
and
Whereas. Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, after a careful review of
the facts, stated in a message to Congress, dated the 18th day of December, 1893, as fol
lows: "As I apprehend the situation, we are brought face to face with the following condi
tions: The lawful Government of Hawaii was overthrown without the drawing of a sword or
the firing of a shot, by a process every step of which it may be safely asserted is directly
traceable to and dependent for its success upon the agency of the United States, acting
through its diplomatic and naval representatives"; and
Whereas, The so-called republic of Hawaii, by its executive and its Senate, formed a
treaty to secure the annexation of Hawaii' to the United States, and said treaty having failed
of ratification by the Senate of the United States, by such failure to ratify having become
void and of no effect as to Hawaii because of the terms of Article 42 of the constitution of
the republic of Hawaii, which reads: "The President, with the approval of the Cabinet, is
hereby expressly authorized and empowered to make a treaty of political or commercial
union' between the republic of Hawaii and the United States of America, subject to the rati
fication of the Senate"; and
Whereas, The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States have passed
a joint resolution for the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands, and such joint resolution has
not been passed upon by the people of Hawaii nor by their representatives in Legislature
assembled; and
Whereas, By memorial the people of Hawaii have protested against the consumma
tion of an invasion of their political rights and have fervently appealed to the President, the
Congress and the people of the United States to refrain from further participating in the
wrongful annexation of Hawaii; and
Whereas, The Declaration of American Independence expresses that Governments de
rive their just powers from the consent of the governed; therefore, be it
Resolved, That as the representatives of a large and influential body of native Ha
waiians, we solemnly protest against annexation in the manner proposed and without refer
ence to obtaining the consent of the people of the Hawaiian Islands.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, with an English translation, be forwarded
to Sanford B. Dole, President of the republic of Hawaii, and to the agents representing Wil
liam McKinley, President of the United States, at Honolulu, Island of Oahu, Hawaiian Isl
ands.
her shrunken body, her thin arms toss
ing, her gTeat eyes turned toward the
skies.
It is customary for other voices to
take up the melee began by one, but
this woman chanted on alone In honor
of Liliuokalani's return. She stood close
by the rope as the ex-Queen came down
the plank, arid I lookedâ rather hopedâ
to see her loyalty rewarded by a
glance, although I did not love her
song. But such are not, perhaps, the
ways of Queens. Llliuckalani went on
to her carriage and the wild chant
ceased.
Some one cried, "Three cheers for the
Queen," and they were given loudly, sin
cerely, unbrokenly, many of the native
women falling to wild weeping as the
carriage rolled away. At the doors of
Washington Place two torch-bearers in
the funereal black capes and silk hats,
which gave Liliuokalani's suite the
melancholy personnel of undertakers,
and wearing otherwise white satin
badges lettered with her name in blue
and gold, guarded th lowest step. Be
hind these were ranged others in like
attire and without torches. Others still
patrolled the porches and watched all
windows and doors against the en
trance of strangers to the rooms where
the ex-Queen sat at table with her
most intimate personal friends.
But the wide gates of the grounds
were open to the people and all night
a sorrowful throng came through the
moonlight, oleander-scented streets to
gather under the tremulous spiked
shadows of the royal palms in Liliuo
kalani's gardens and listen to the .oll
oli of the melees chanted by wallers
with an accompaniment of strange
huala movements, beneath the ex-
Queen's windows, recounting the deeds
of her ancestors, the glories of their
reigns, the joys of their people, the
peace of their passing, the line of their
succession.
Liliuokalanl could be seen through the
great windows, seated at the head of
her table, fanned with kahilis of white
feathers by girls dressed in white holi
kus, served by men in the gloomy liv
ery of her suite, attended by a little
audience of men and women. When
she turned from the table all her old
servants and followers were admitted
to her presence, entering the room at
their proper height, prostrating them
selves before her, crawling on their
hands and knees or sliding along the
floor to her feet to lie there with their
eyes cast down until she touched their
heads with her hands. The circle
waited until the floor was half covered
with these crouching shapes.
One woman, grotesque in her flapping
holiku and a little sailor hat wreathed
with a lei of carnations, remained
standing in the royal presence for some
seconds and with uplifted arms began
the monotonous chanting of a melee,
but the guttural accents of the 011-oli
were interrupted by sobs, and presently
she sank to the floor, weeping bitterly,
to be patted and comforted by her
Queen.
Outside, the crowd seemed satisfied to
look. It passed close to the porches,
standing on tiptoe to peer over big
flowering shrubs or parting the thick
leaves of. climbers for a better view of
Liliuokalani.
It was a still gathering. The Hawaii
ana are not a noisy people. Their voices
are low pitched, their laugh is a soft
ripple, their grief is expressed by si
lent tears. When some one wept within
or Liliuokalani seemed to speak in sad
ness those without wiped their eyes
and exchanged mournful looks. The
children, who were there in numbers,
stood decorously by their elders and
did as they did, and the village inno
cent, an old soldier of the guard, who
passes his harmless days In choosing
new uniforms which are given him in
charity and roaring military orders
through the streets, quenched his bat
tle tonos and whispered his commands
among the palms. A few old servants
retired to the Cottage of the Cala
bashes, where some twelve dozen of the
royal poi cups of beautifully polished
wood are kept behind glass doors, and
gossiped mournfully of other days,
when the homecoming of a Queen would
have meant a luau for the people.
The moon paled before the early
tropic dawn and the crowd about the
windows thinned and went its several
ways, but the sound of the oli-01l never
ceased, and at broad daylight the
torches still flared before the doors and
within Liliuokalani sat in state with
her audience of friends about her and
her servants prostrate at her feet.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon I had an
interview with Liliuokalani. She looks
ill, worn, sad, and is disinclined to say
anythtng concerning her immediate
plans. She received me in the first
drawing room, a large, bare, ceremo
nious apartment, with huge rahili in
each corner. She wore a costume of
black silk, cut in the European fashion,
with a touch of heliotrope and no dec
orations of any description or orna
ment beyond a Jewel or two on her
i hands. She has a good presence and
her manner is very distinguished. She
has lost all the smooth complacency of
| her earlier years; her face is fallen and
! deeply lined, and that expression of de
| fiant obstinacy so noticeable in her pic
j tures has given way to something infl
j nitely softer.
"I am glad to be at home with my
poor people," she said. "They wanted
me; they needed me; they asked me to
come. I was advisd to stay away from
here at this time, but I was glad if my
presence could console others."
I asked her if the subject of politics
was tabooed and she smiled.
"Have you read my book?" she said;
"my political opinions are there and
they have not changed. As for plans,
I have none. My feelings may be
guessed, and I naturally find that sub
ject painful. It was beautiful to me to
receive the welcome I had last night
I from my own people and some of my
I old friends. They expressed in every
way their love and kindness, what we
call the aloha."
"I heard the singing," I said, blush
ing to admit that I h*d spied upon the
rest.
"The singing? Oh, yes, the melees.
That is our custom. What you heard
was the story of my ancestors, espe
cially of my uncles. Their deeds are
put into verses by our people. Music
and poetry come naturally to us. We
love music and song and stories and
sunshine and all beautiful, happy
things."
Poor Lilliiokalani, who has had so
much else to think about!
"Shall you issue any proclamation to
your people ?"I asked.
"I hardly think so," she replied. "I
hardly know what step I shall take. I
am Btill very vÂ»eary, too weary to think
and I am not well. Thursday is my
reception day, my public reception day,
and I shall probably address my peo
ple some time that day, perhaps at
noon. Will you come?"
I would, indeed, with pleasure. The
address, as I was afterward notified,
was for 12 o'clock. The ex-Queen held
a private reception in her drawing
room. She sat on a wide sofa at the
extreme end of the room, facing the
entrance, and wore a holiku of black
brocaded satin with the royal lei of
yellow feathers about her throat and a
crown of yellow flowers and the Order
of the Kamehamehas on her breast.
She was attended by the Princess and
some twenty ladies of the royalist
party, both white and native.
Not being versed in the etiquette of
court receptions I went blithely for
NATIVES TO KEEP
ALOOF FROM THE
FLAG RAISING
Hawaiian Government Will Pay
All Claims of Prisoners
of 1895.
REAR ADMIRAL MILLER, WHO WILL RAISE THE AMERICAN
FLAG AT HONOLULU.
HONOLULU, Aug. 4, via Victoria,
B. C, Aug. 12.â Hawaiians will
officially protest to Dole and Se
wall against annexation. They
will keep aloof from the flag
raising.
The Chinese wll! prepare a memorial
to th .â  Hawaiian commissioners.
The jurisdiction of Circuit Courts in
criminal cases will be attacked before
the Supreme Court to-morrow.
The Japanese will test the labor con
tracts.
The Hawaiians are divided politically
on the advisability of the Queen issu
ing a proclamation recognizing the
hopelessness of a restoration.
At the request of the American Gov
ernment Hawc-ii paid on August 1
$75,000 to Japr.n as a compromise.
It is rumored on fair authority that
the claims c '. foreign prisoners of 1895
will ~>e paid before the flag is raised.
Admiral Miller arrived yesterday.
Damon and Srrth were with him this
morning. No date has been fixed for
the flag-raising, but it probably will
take place ner.t week.
The transport Pennsylvania arrived
on July 2S. The Rio reached here on
July 31 and sailed on August 3. The
Peru and Puebla sailed on August 4.
Twenty-one cases of measles on the
Puebla had improved sufficiently to go
forward. All the transports were
thoroughly cleansed. The troops ex
cept those on the Rio were poorly fed.
They behaved well. Isaac Strickland
of the Third Artillery; R. D. Stewart,
a marlnl of the Mohican, and â Jenks
of South Dakota, died at sea. Corporal
Prather was permanently invalided.
Murat Halstead has recovered and
gone forward.
The Queen is holding a large recep
tion to-day.
Thurston has bought out an interest
in a loading daily. This means hot poli
tics.
All rumors in regard to threatened
riots or disturbances are absolutely
false.
Admiral Miller paid an official visit
to President Dole this morning. The
flag-raising will be discussed to-mor
row. HORACE WRIGHT.
CONFERENCES AS TO
THE FLAG RAISING
HONOLULU, Aug. 4, via Victoria,
Aug. 12.â The United States steamship
Philadelphia arrived yesterday, six
days and twenty hours from San Fran
cisco, with Admiral Miller and staff on
board, who came for the purpose of
raising the American flag over the Ha
waiian Islands. The Admiral has or
ders to confer with Minister Sewall.
Until after the conference there will be
nothing definite decided as to the flag
raising programme.
Minister Sewall received instructions
from his Government regarding the
flag-raising, but until after he has had
ward and shook, hands democratically
with everybody who seemed willing;,
and shortly afterward the ex-Queen
arose; a lady-in-waiting crowned with
yellow gathered up the royal train and
led the way to a curtained corner of the
porch. The crowd of natives standing
on the lawn bared their heads at her
approach and the band played "Ha
waii Ponoi."
The address in the native tongue was
a mere matter of soft vowels and as
pirates to me, but the people wept
softly through it all and gave the aloha
a conference with Admiral Miller and
the Hawaiian Government he will make
no announcement regarding it- These
probably will be made some time to
morrow. One conference with the Ha
waiian Government will be held this
afternoon aiv?r the departure of the
Aorangi. iiany people here believe the
flag will not be raised until the com
missioners arrive on the 17th in^t.
Others think the ceremony will take
place on the tth, to allow sufficient
time for preparation of a suitable pro
gramme of exercises.
F. M. Hatch has resigned the position
of Minister to the United States. Mr.
Hatch has the distinction of closing the
volume of Hawaiian diplomacy in
Washington opened by Alexander
Simpson and J. F. B. Marshall in 1843,
when they went to Washington to lay
the case of British occupation before
the United States Government.
The Honolulu Chamber of Commerce
recently held a special meeting for the
purpose of making acknowledgment to
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce for the gift of a splendid Ameri
can ting- It was agreed the flag should
be raised over the rooms the same day
and hour set for the flag-raising on the
executive building.
The Ewa plantation, the best paying
sugar estate in Hawaii, has decided to
increase its stock to $2,000,000. The
present capital stock of the plantation
is $1,000,000, with privilege, according to
the charter, to raise to the amount de
cided on.
The Japanese imbroglio oÂ£ 1897 has
been settled by the payment of $75,000
to Japan. In making payment the
Government does not admit the justice
of the claim nor the right of Japan to
indemnity.
Queen Liliuokalani returned by the
Gaelic on the 2d inst., glad, as she said,
to see her friends and be back in her
own country and among her own
people. Early morninsr as it was when
the Gaelic can.c into port, and unusual
as it is for mail steamers to come to
the wharf in the night, a large number
of her frie:. la were there to greet her
while the vessel was still in the chan
nel. By the time it reached the wharf
about 250 people were there, mostly na
tives. Liliuokalani declined to be inter
viewed. To her friends she said her
health was good, but the trip had much
fatigued her.
ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE
OF THE TRANSPORTS
HONOLULU, Aug. 4 (via Victoria,
Aug. 12).â The United States transports
Pennsylvania and Rio de Janeiro joined
the Peru and City of Puebla at this
port. The Pennsylvania arived July 2S,
followed by the Rio two days later.
General Otis decided not to remain in
this port until the flag-raising cere
monies, and gave orders yesterday for
the Pennsylvania and Rio de Janeiro to
sail for Manila. Both vessels left port
last evening. This morning both the
Peru and City of Puebla left port,
bound for the Philippines.
While the transports were in port
measles broke out among the men. The
patients were removed to the quaran
tine station. Previous to the departure
of the Puebla this morning the Bick
men, twenty-six in all, were returned
to the ship.
at its beginning and at its close.
The Philadelphia is here. There wai
no enthusiasm over her coming. The
water front was lined with people, but
only those who went out on the tug
with the band to meet her cheered. Her
men responded to the cheer and when
the Hawaiian band played 'â¢America"
the Philadelphia answered with "Ha
waii Ponoi."
Then her five guns thundered out.
The flag of the Hawaiian Islands re
ceived its last salute. They say our
own will ware over them Monday.

RUSSIA'S TACTICS
IGNORED IN THE
QUEEN'S SPEECH
Members of Parliament Elicit Lit
tle Information by Ques
tioning.
Balfour Will Not Pledge the Government to
Prevent the Peking-Hankow Con
cession.
LONDON, Aug. 12.â The House of
Commons met to-day. A succession of
questions on the subject of China
elicited little information. The ffovern
... ment load r, Mr. Balfour, declined to
pledpo the Government to prevent the
' ratification of the Franco-Belgian Pe
king-Hankow concession, but promised
that, in the event of British capitalists
purchasing railroad concessions ob
tained by French or Belgian syndicates
in the Yang-tse-Kiang valley, her
Majesty's Government will support and
assist them, both in London and Pe
kjng, in this and in all other legitimate
British commercial enterprises.
The China appropriation bill then
passed its third reading.
The Queen's speech at the proroga
tion of Parliament was as follows:
My Lords and Gtntlemen: My rela
tions with other nations continue
friendly. 1 have witnessed with the deep
est sorrow the hostilities which have
taken place between Spain and the
United States, two nations to which my
empire is bound by many ties of affec
tion and traditions. Negotiations re
cently opened give fair ground for hop-
Ing- that the deplorable conflict will be
brought to a termination by the conclu
sion of an honorable and enduring
peace.
The changes which have taken place in
the territorial relation! of other powers
with the Chinese empire induced me to
tude arrangements whereby the har
bor of Wei-Hal-Wel and certain positions
adjacent to my colony of Hongkong were
leased to me by the Emperor of China.
I trust the arrangements will conduce
to the maintenance of his Independence
and the security of his empire and be
fiiv.irable to the development of the ex
. tensive commerce carried on between the
Peoples of Great Britain and China.
â¢ â¢ Paragraph three refers to the guar
anteeing, in conjunction with Russia
.and France, of the loan to enable Greece
"/to pay the Turkish war indemnity.
, 'â  The fourth paragraph expresses satis
faction at the conclusion of the con
. vention with France, finally settling the
â¢ TYest African question.
â¢â " The speech then refers to the ar
rangements made to establish at an
early- date penny postage between the
â  United Kingdom, Canada. Newfound
."â¢land and elsewhere; makes reference
â â  to the plague still existing in certain
â  portions of Western India and the
Punjab, and concludes:
.'-'Lain thankful that bountiful harvesre
'--have tit-en gathered throughout the great
er jiart of India and that the internal and
â¢ .external- trade of the country are rapid
ly recovering from the depression caused
â by the famine.
< i> iitNinen of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the liberal provision you
have made for the defense of my empire.
The sacrifices asked of you are severe.
but no greater than the exigencies of
the- present- time require. I am glad to
recognize the value of the provisions' to
which you have assented for increasing
the strength ;mri efficiency of the army.
My Lords and Gentlemen: I have seen
with much gratification that you t have
this y-ear added to the statute book an
important measure assimilating the loral
-.instil Ireland to those of Eng
land .and Scotland. I trust this reform
will tend to strengthen the bonds which
unite .the people of Great Britain and Ire
land and increase their common affection
for the fundamental institutions of the
realm.
After expressing satisfaction at the
adoption of bills enabling accused per
sons to testify in their own behalf and
f"i- preventing the abuse of patronage
and occupation of benefices of the es
tablished church, "the principles of
â¢which bills have been generally accept
r many years, though hitherto
there ha* been no opportunity to make
them law," the speech ends:
"I pray that the blessing of Almighty
God may attend you.'
LONDON PRESS VENTS ITS
RAGE UPON SALISBURY
"If This State of Things Continues
the Guns Will (io Oft tÂ»i
Themselves."
â . LONDON, Aug. 12.â The morning pa
â  pers express the growing indignation of
â¢ the country, at the position of affairs in
China. The Daily Graphic says: "If
this state of things continues the guns
\ylll go off of themselves."
.â¢ The Shanghai war correspondent of
" the .Daily Mail, who professes to di- |
vulge the terms of a long existing
'treaty between China ,'md HutiHia,
Bays: "It is nothing less than an of
â¢ fensive alliance. China undertakes to
' regard Russia as htiviny a preponder
ating influence on all questions of com
;.;mercial and internal policies, while
" Russia will support China against all
. 'opuen door' demands. Russia finances
" -China in internal developments and
â¢ China, grants Russia preferential rates j
in certain areas and railways built in
the joint interests of the' two countries
â¢will be under Russia's practical control.
"Russia will assist < 'hina in develop
ing her military and naval forces, and
China will co-operate with Russia as an
ally. This treaty has been In abeyance
since Li Hung Chang visited the Czar.
That it has become operative at the
present moment in respect to the Pek
ing-Hankov. and Nieu Chwang con
tracts is significant."
' If the Daily Mail's version may be
trusted It will explain much that has
been hitherto inexplicable in the devel
opment o-f the question. The manage*
of the Hongkong and Shanghni Bank
in' London, in the course of an inter
view yesterday, said: "1 believe the
Peking-Hankow line, owing to natural
obstructions and its costliness, will
never be built, Russia merely wishing
to keep England c-ut."
The French press comments gleefully
upon the situation, and the newspapers
at Berlin and Vienna are at no pains
to hide their satisfaction at the discom
fiture of England. The Continental
press regards the project of an Anglo-
American alliance as chimerical. It
considers that the United States has
enough of war for the present, and will
not care to give Great Britain anything
more than moral support in China.
.Therefore, Continental editors argue,
England is not likely to pick a quarrel
. with Russia, but will content herself
â  With seeking compensation elsewhere.
A special dispatch from Shanghai
says: "The Russian agents are again
intriguing to obtain control of the Chi
ni's^ maritime customs department."
.' The Peking correspondent of the
Times, telegraphing with reference to
the Peking-Hankow contract, says:
"The rebuff is all the more serious be
cause the Tsung Li Yamen gave as
surances that the decree confirming
the contract would not be issued until
after a further conference with Sir
Claud Macdonald, the British Minis
ter."
The Chronicle, in an editorial which
i reflects the general opinion of the Lon
| don morning papers, comments on the
I fact that the Marquis of Salisbury and
: all the responsible officials are leaving
j London at such a critical moment. It
I says: "The curtain is deliberately
i dropping upon a scene of national hu
: initiation and national indignation."
BRITISH TROOPSHIPS
HELD IN READINESS
VANCOUVER, Aug. 12.â The Cana
dian Pacitlc Railway's steamers Tartar
and Athenian are being held here in
view of any sudden hostile movement
on the part of Russia, which will neces
sitate the hurried rushing through of
British troops to China. The steamers J
were withdrawn from the northern
route three weeks ago and have since j
been In the harbor undergoing repairs ]
to their boilers and engines. The Unit- j
ed States Government, through the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company, was
negotiating for their purchase for
transports, but owing to the high price
placed on them the deal fell through.
The company officials said to-day that
the recent changes in the engines were'
due to instructions from Montreal to
have the speed increased and the boats
in readineSÃ to transport a large body
of British troops to China In case of
any sudden move on the. part of Rus
sia. Both vessels are splendidly equip
ped for carrying troops and each will
accommodate from 600 to 700 soldiers.
With the recent improvement to the
engines they will make as good speed
as Oriental liners.
The first intimation that the boats
were held here with a view to carrying
British troops to China was In a pri
vate dispatch which stated that should
trouble between Russia and England
become more acute thousands of Brit
ish soldiers would be sent across the
continent over the Canadian Pacific
railway. No direct move has been
made by the British Government to
purchase the boats, bnt it is simply
providing for an emergency by having
steamships which intended to go out
next month held here until something
definite occurs in Russia's war move.

WHEATLAND IS
SWEPT BY FIRE
Nearly Every Business
House in Ashes.
ESTIMATED LOSS $180,000
PBINCIPAL SUFFERERS AND IN
SURANCE.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WHEATLAND, Aug. 12. â A flre
started shortly before 1 o'clock to-day
in a barn back of Neimeyer's store. In
stantly the blaze jumped, as if follow
ing an oil trail, to the warehouses on
either side, and before the fire alarm
was rung the Sperry Company's large
grain warehouse and Neimeyer's ware
house were a burning mass, sending
flames and smoke high in the air.
The fire bell brought the hop pickers
from the fields adjoining town, and in
less than ten minutes fully 2000 people
were on the main streets. They lent
willing hands to check the spread of
the flames, but their work was usedess.
The fire spread rapidly north, east and
west. It looked at one time as if the
whole residence portion of the town
would go, and there were few houses
out of which valuable goods were not
removed.
As soon as it was seen that the prin
cipal business block, which is of brick,
was doomed, the uninsured stores were
thrown open and the public invited to
save the goods. Here the hop pickers
lent a ready hand, and to-night, out of
the Stagner Brothers' grocery and
hardware store, there is not enough
saved goods under guard to supply our
military company with a week's rations
and hatchets and pincers for Cuban
detail.
Not until the fire had been checked
did the people realize what was going
on about them. The rapacious greed of
the lower element among the hop pick
ers was stimulated by the absence of
law officers, and it was not uncommon
to find men filling barley sacks with
plunder.
As soon as possible Marshal Waddell
deputized two dozen men and armed
them with shotguns. When the first
guards came out a crowd of fully 600
roughs were fighting. The special offi
cers were almost powerless to make ar
rests, but eight of the leaders were ta
ken and locked in box cars. After an
hour's work the town was cleared and
what goods were left were put under
guard.
To-night two attempts were made to
fire other portions of the town. These
facts tend to confirm the theory that
the fire was incendiary. The casualties
were one Chinaman dead and one horse
burned. A number of persons were
overcome by the heat.
Following is the loss by fire and the

torney General and two terms as Governor of Texas. He attended the recent
Democratic State convention of Texas, and while he would be pleased to meet
his Democratic fellow men of California, he hardly feels equal to another Dem
ocratic convention this summer, although a pressing invitation to visit Sacra

Governor Hogg is one of the able and progressive public men of the Lone Star

Attorney W. B. Whiteâ The principle of
appointing delegates is entirely wrong.
The delegates should be elected by the
people. I am opposed and always will be
to an appointing power in matters of this
kind. Delegates sent to a State, county
or municipal convention are there to rep
resent the people. If they are selected
by one man or three men. or a combina
tion of men, those selecting them are as
suming a power that is not Democratic.
As I understand It, the Democratic party
is the party of the people and an> as
sumption of appointing power is undem
ocratic. I believe that the people should
at all times have the say as to who
should represent them. Lot there be pri
maries held whenever possible, and then
the people will have an opâ¢" 11 " 1^ Â°*
expressing tneir views concerning -ose
who are supopsed to represent them in
convention. The appointment of dele
gates is against every Democratic prill
Cl F 'w Leonhardt, member Democratic
State Central Committeeâ have always
been opposed to any appoint power. As
a member of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee I have simply this to
say that I believe in doing unto others
as you would have them do unto you.
I would not be satisfied with an appoint
ed delegation from San Francisco Coun
ty this county or any other county. I
believe that the people who will be ex
pected to support the Democratic ticket
next election day should have some little
voice in the matter of selecting the dele
gates who are to represent them at bac
ramento. While I may not have suffi
cient influence or power to unseat the
appointed delegates from San Francisco.
I believe that these should be unseated
and if the opportunity is afforded me I
shall vote to unseat them.
Hon. Seth Man-I believe that the
authority to appoint delegates to a con
vention should not be encouraged. There
may be occasions, however, when the ap
pointment of delegates may be advisable
and even necessary. Generally speaking.
I believe that primaries should be held
whenever practicable, âââ.,+
T C Sloddard, a prominent Democrat,
ex-postmaster of Alameflaâ l never be
lieved In the appointment of delegates,
the principle Is decidedly wrong. By this
method the McNab faction can perpet
uate themselves in powerâ can elect
their own chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee and that individual can
appoint twenty committeemen at large.
Then they can appoint another commit
tee of one hundred and control the dele
gation from San Francisco every elec
"l'ara frank to say." Mr. Stoddard con
tinued, "that; I know nothing about the
personnel of either delegation, but the ap
pointment of a delegation for a large body
of Democrats is a bad principle to estab
lish as a precedent. In my judgment such
a large body of Democrats as is to be
found In San Francisco should have the
privilege of electing their own delegates.
I do not consider U good politics to ap
point delegates.
"I cite a similar case when occurred
some years ago in the camp of the enemy,
and, if I remember right, the appointed
delegates were unseated and those who
were elected at primaries were seated.
So it Is really an accepted principle to
send delegates to a convention who were
elected. The other method leads to an
Improper control. I favor the recognlton
of those delegates who were properly
elected at primaries."
F. W. Voopt, another State delegate
from Alameda who is numbered among
the city's leading Democrats, and is pres
ident of the Alameda Bimetallic Club, 18
opposed to the method employed by the
McNab faction. "In case of needed ac
tion." says Mr. Voogt, "I would favor a
compromiseâ that Is. I would favor giving
each delegation half a vote."
T. S. Crandall, who has always taken a
prominent part in Democratic politics in
i AJarrieda County, and who -is an earnest
worker in the interest of his party, waa
also honored with election as a delegate
to the Democratic State Convention.
When interviewed to-night he said: "I
am heartily opposed to the appointment of
any set of delegates by that committee. I
shall go to Sacramento as a delegate
elected at the primary, and I shall most
assuredly oppose the seating of the dele
gation appointed by the committee. It
doesn't give the rank and file of the
Democratic party a fair and square deal."
ROW IN THE BOYS' HOME.
Some of the Directors Resigned on
Account of Manager Hutch
inson.
There has beon a split-up in the insti
tution known as the Boys' Home, owing
to a general dissatisfaction on the part
of the directors with A. H. Hutchinson,
th<- manager. At one time the home
was in a prosperous condition, but on
the resignation of D. M. Carman it took
the downhill course until recently, when
the active members of the Eureka So
ciety for the Protection of Children un
dertook to put it on its feet again, giv
ing it the name of the San Francisco
Boys' Home.
A board of direr-tors waa elected and
there was every prospect that the insti
tution would be one of thn best estab
lished charitable organizations in the
State Hutchinson was retained as man
ager ' and he assured the directors that
the debts amounted to only $7.
An inspection of the home at 26 Laurel
place made some of the directors do
some thard thinking, for, according to
the statement of ono of the number the
place was not fit for human habitation.
However, it was filled with the family
and relations of Hutchlnaon, leaving but

little room for the boys. Mr. Hutchin
son refused to be dictated to by the di
rectors or give any report of the finances
and debts. This was too much, and the
following officers resigned yesterday: L.
R. Goldberg, vice president; Mrs. E. L.
Wadham. treasurer; E. L. Wadham, D. S.
O'Brien, Mrs. R. Clayton Brower, J. A_
Waldteufel and Dr. A. B. Wilson.
This general resigning was preceded by
establishing another home for boys on
Howard street, near Sixteenth. It Is the
determination of those who have left the
old organization to establish a home of
their own and leave Mr. Hutchinson to
shift for himself. The condition of the
home on Laurel place is such that the
health officers were notified last evening
and askt-d to make an inspection of the
premises.
The other side, those who did not re
sign, tell a different story. Mrs. Pettee.
the president, says that the trouble was
all caused by the Eureka Society people
wanting to handle all the money and
Mr. Hutchinson, who had managed to
keep the home alive for many months, re
fused to be dictated to and let others
get the credit of his work. Mrs. March
is another who has stayed with the old
home, and she takes the same view as

With regard to R. Me.Arthur, a mem
ber of the South End barge crew that will
row against the Alamedas at the Astoria
regatta on the 19th, 20th and 22d, it was
suggested that the race will be In the
nature of an exhibition, that there wui
ha no gate receipts and no Individual
prizes, and that in such an event ama
teurs may row against professionals with
out forfeiting their amateur standing.
Each oarsman, to protect his standing in
the Amateur Athletic Union, has been
Instructed to lodge a formal protest
against the inclusion of McArthur in the
South End crew with the referee of the
Astoria regatta. The chairman thought
that McArthur ought to be suspended
until the Registration Commissioner shall
have passed upon his case. It waa stated
that the Astoria regatta will be held un
der the auspices of the National Associa
tion of Amateur Oarsmen, an affiliated
body of the Amateur Athletic Union; that
the Alameda crew are members of that as
sociation, and that the South Ends have
applied for membership. Ultimately the
case of McArthur was referred to the
Registration Commissioner, who has large
discretionary powers in such cases.
A junior oarsman or sculler was defined
to be one who has never won a race, an
intermediate oarsman or sculler, one who
has won a junior race, but has never won
an intermediate or senior event; and a
senior oarsman or sculler one who has
won an intermediate or senior event.

HISTORIAN BANCROFT
MUST PAY DAMAGES
VEBDICT FOR MORE THAN
TWELVE THOUSAND.
Jury Decides That He fcroke His
Contract With N. J. Stone and
Must Pay the Consid
eration.
H. H. Bancroft, who wears the laurels
as the most voluminous historian that ever
wrote by proxy, was the victim of a
Judge and jury yesterday in the United
States Circuit Court. Before the noon re
cess all the evidence had been presented
and at 2:30 p. m. the case of Hambly vs.
Bancroft was submitted to the jury. Af
ter deliberating for about an hour they
returned a verdict awarding the plaintiff
$9833 33 for salary sued for and due N. J.
Stone (who assigned his claim to Ham
bly), together with interest and costs ag
ereiratlns: $12,250. _
This is the third Judgment won by Stone
on his contract with Bancroft, the first
and second having been awarded by jur
ies In the Superior Court of this city.
The story of the case is that Stone en
tered into a ten-year contract beginning
August 20, 18S6, with Bancroft whereby
Stone was to have charge of the publica
tion and sale of the Bancroft histories,
he to hold a one-tenth interest in the
History Company and to draw *too per
month salary. Stone and Bancroft had
a falling out, the nature and cause of
which did not appear in the evidence and
Bancroft's agent not only refused to al
low him to do the work laid out. for him
in the contract, but refused also to pay
hi X was^cSnded by Attorney W. F
Michael, representing the law firm of
Page McCutcheon & Eells. that Stone
broke the contract by becoming the agent
of a jag cure before the filing of the comp
laint in the present case. Stone proved,
however, that he went into the jag cure
business after the Bancroft people had
refused to allow him to work for them,
and that his sales did not produce suffi
cient to pay his board. The present suit
was for his wages from April 1, 1594, to
August 20. 18%.
The plaintiff was represented by Messrs.
Reddy and Orton of the law firm of
Reddy, Campbell and Metson.
LUPE SAUCEDO DISAPPEARS.
The Little Italian Girl Missing From
Her Home Since Last Monday.
Lupe Saucedo. a girl S years of age,
disappeared suddenly from her home at
736 Broadway Monday night, and has not
been seen since. Various theories have
been advanced as a solution to the mys
tery, among them abduction and acciden
tal death.
It Is alleged that the child's parents
have been in the habit of abusing her,
and for this reason she has left her home.
Others affirm that she was abducted by
some man who was probably attracted by
her beauty, and a few that some charit
ably inclined woman has taken pity on
the child by placing her in an institu
tion.
When last seen she was in company
with a child of her own age playing in a
neighboring yard. Where she went after
this is a mystery as no one saw her leave
the yard. , .
A short time before she disappeared she
complained that her face and hands were
paining her, she having been brutally
thrown against a hot stove that morning
by her mother who was acting under an
Impulse of anger caused by drunken
frenzy. , . . .
That the child was ever abused Is de
nied by Its parents but Is sustained by
the girl's school teacher at the Broadway
Grammar School, who claims that little
Lupe was in the habit of coming to school
virtually in raps and totally neglected.
It was a novelty to see hor attend class
without some mark of abuse on her body
dealt by the cruel hand of her parent.
When last seen she was poorly, even
raggedly clad in an ordinary woollen dress
and her face bearing the marks of her
recent punishment.

c HOLIDAY PROPOSITION.
r LUSHED with a glow of an ardent patriotism
roused to the height of a genuine enthusiasm
by the achievements of our army and navy dur
ing the war, the St. Louis Chronicle calls upon the
pi ess of the country to unite with it in advocating
that the day on which Spain signs the treaty of peace
be set aside as a public holiday to be commemorated
in each :>ucceeding year as the anniversary of the be
ginning of a new era in our history.
That the people will feel like celebrating the vic
tories and glories of the war is beyond question, and
some form of celebration or thanksgiving will doubt
less be carried out in almost every section of the
Union. That much is both natural and advisable.
The plan of making an annual festival of the day, as
proposed by the Chronicic. is, however, too am
bitious. There is no sufficient reason for commem
orating this war any more than the war of 1812 or the
war with Mexico, and if such an attempt were made
it would fail by reason of a lack of popular interest
in it.
We have now more national holidays than we have
the spirit to celebrate. Christmas, the Fourth of
July, Decoration day and Thanksgiving day are
about as many grand holidays as our people care to
keep. Great and ardent as are the respect and love
with which the memory- of Washington is universally
cherished in this country, the annual celebration of
his birthday is very largely a perfunctory observance.
The war with Spain has been but an episode in our
history, and public interest in it will soon pass away.
By this time next year very few people would care to
close their places of business or turn aside from their
work to listen to orations on the Cuban war, or hear
Dewey's victory celebrated in an original poem.
A celebration this year, however, would be most
appropriate and would make a pleasing interlude in
the strife of party politics that is soon to be raging.
When the volunteer boys come marching home they
should be met with a patriotic welcome, and a general
festival might be held in their honor.
We are much given in this country to the holding
of carnivals and the display of pageants and parades.
In every State in the Union one or more of these are
held every summer or fall. It would be proper this
year to devote such festivals to the celebration of
pence with victory and honor, but that would be
enough. The new era will bring us enough good
things without adding to them another national holi
day, when we have already more than the people
generally are able to attend to.
Yesterday the announcement was made that the
fingers of Paderewski had gone back on him. It
was made with pleasure, as the fact was immediately
recognized that a worthy press agent had started in
to earn his salary. It is another pleasure to announce
now that the finpers are all right, and that the press
agent is still keenly alive to the wisdom of applying
a coat of butter to his bread.
Possibly the Republicans who refused to respond
to the Examiner's request for an expression of their
political opinions are merely careful as to whom they
take into their confidence.
When an American signal corps uses a Spanish
barb-wire fence for a telegraph line over which to
flash news of Spanish defeat, insult may be said to
have been added to injury.
Blarco will of course have to pack up and get out
without having fired a shot at the Americans. To be
consistent he will have to arrange for an immediate
court-martial of himself.
While the publication in a New York paper of the
picture of Cecil Rhodes as "T. B. Reed" cannot be ac
cepted as correct, it is about as near accuracy as that
paper ever approaches.
By the way, the Pennsylvania troops who stood so
bravely under a withering fire are the same American
citizens whom Editor Barry declared ought to be
killed like snakes.
The latest Oakland murderer is afflicted with that
peculiar variety of insanity which is best corrected
by suspending the lunatic by means of a well
stretched rope.
The report of the speech made at Manila by a Ger
man officer cannot be fairly judged, for the remarks
he must have added after he got sober are not yet at
hand.
Some Spanish papers accuse your Uncle Sam of
being severe. Well, there have been a number of in
cidents tending to roil the old man.
Garcia's men are having a vacation, but owing to
the lack of American rations there is some doubt as
to whether they are enjoying it much.
GOVERNOR, OR SENATOR, OR BOTH ?
THE replies to The Call's inquiry for favorites
for the gubernatorial nomination brought out
symptoms of the existence of an expectation,
not to say a plan, in Southern California, looking to
securing for that section of the State both the Gover
nor and the United States Senator. The Call has no
quarrel with the local spirit and loyalty of any part of
the State. But we desire to admonish all sections
that such spirit must be tempered by reason and jus
tice. If it overleap these it defeats itself.
The idea is propagated in the south that as the
northern end of the State had the Governor and both
Senators so long, it is a good time to hark back for
a reason for claiming both for the south until a gene
ral average is established, and thereafter to divide
evenly. Southern California has had three Gover
nors, Stoneman, Markham and Waterman. As the
State has had nineteen persons in the office of Gov
ernor, it will be seen that the process of establishing
an average requires that six more shall be elected
from that section. As twenty-four individuals have
held the office of United States Senator, only one
being from south of the Tehachapi, to get an average
will require the election of eleven more from that
part of the State. We may ask, we hope without
offense, what will happen while the Republicans of
Southern California are carrying out this policy of
equalization and average?
There are signs that some men there believe it
should be entered upon as a crusade to right a
wrong, to avenge a long existing neglect. This is a
strained view of it. The considerable settlement of
the State began and for long continued in the north.
The great resources of the south lay undeveloped and
the lure of its physical charms unknown until recent
years. Since then there has not been manifested a
disposition on the part of Northern California Re
publicans to deny complete justice to the south. Of
Markham's majority for Governor Northern Cali
fornia contributed 6119, the south only 1826. The
north has in the same spirit given her share, far in
excess of the votes contributed by the south, to the
election of two Republican candidates for Lieutenant
Governor, one of whom became Governor.
There is no evidence in the record of any other de
stie than to live in party amity and comity with the
south, and to give her the prominence in party coun
cil and public government, justified by her import
ance.
Therefore it is not susceptible of demonstration
that Southern California Republicans have any
wrongs to right or neglect to avenge, or omission to
make even.
Karly in the preparation for the campaign that is
impending there was an earnest desire to find out
what the south wanted. As early as last October the
Los Angeles Times frankly declared that in the divi
sion of party honors the south wanted the Senator.
In this expression of preference the Times was joined
by the Los Angeles Journal, Orange Post, Los An
geles Record, Los Angeles Germania, Lompoc Jour
nal, South Pasadenan, Santa Ana Blade, Los Angeles
Daily Gazette, Pomona Progress, Los Angeles In
vestor, Farmers' Friend, and nearly fifty other Re
publican papers of Southern California, embracing
practically the entire party press of that section. This
expression was not changed until recently. It showed
no variableness nor shadow of turning until within
six weeks. Many months went by with it estab
lished as the plan and preference of the party down
there. We submit to reasonable Republicans in the
south who desire party success that the change in this
sentiment based on the hope that the south may get
both Governor and Senator is not conducive to party
harmony nor success.
The party, to succeed, must leave a sense of con
tentment and justice with all sections of the State,
and must have a candidate for Governor whose party,
public and private record needs no defense. We can
not go into this campaign explaining or defending
either. Too much is at stake. The election of
Maguire with his long catalogue of communistic and
anarchistic expressions is a danger too serious to be
incurred. We do not hesitate to say that it will be
more disastrous to California than would have been
the election of Denis Kearney in the height of the
sand-lot movement. We must go into this campaign
on its public issues, without stopping to defend the
personal record or questionable affiliations of our
candidate.
ARMY SCfiNDfILS.
IT is a circumstance most regrettable that in the
commissary department of the army there should
be so much as an indication of scandal. Yet
the sinister charge that the Government has been
robbed by contractors and the soldiers made to suffer
through a commercial instinct run to greed and
thievery are apparently too well sustained to be
passed over. No official position should be permit
ted to shield any man accused of such crimes, and
none so accused unjustly would be content with any
thing less than the fullest investigation.
Many charges have been directed against the head
of the War Department, and the possibility that they
are baseless must be recognized. Secretary Alger
could not personally direct every detail of the equip
ping of a great army, and to hold him responsible for
the acts of a rascally subordinate would be unjust,
more likely than otherwise. Neither does an accusa
tion coming from Governor Lecdy of Kansas carry
great weight. Leedy was the means of sending into
service the most wretchedly outfitted soldiers who
entered it. The Kansas regiment which reached this
city was literally in rags, and the explanation was
given that Leedy had refused to permit the boys to
leave the State with the uniforms of the National
Guard, notwithstanding he must have known the
General Government would make good more than
the value of the uniforms, replacing each with new.
Therefore, to sing small, well beseems Governor
Leedy.
But the Eastern press, regardless of politics, teems
with similar charges, and the matter is so serious as
to constitute a disgrace, which will be the blacker
and deeper if permitted to go unrefuted, and if the
allegations be sustained there ought to be punishment
swift and severe. Dismissal from office would be
suggested in some instances and introduction to jail
in others. National pride resents the idea of unscru
pulous and thrifty speculators being permitted to
turn the tide of war to their own benefit or to rob
the Government simply because the exigency of the
time affords the opportunity.
It seems strange that the same papers announcing
peace should detail a proposed campaign against
Havana. There ought to be a difference between
peace and war.
Russell Sage showed some manliness in his ex
planation of why he is hale and hearty at 82. He did
not try to put a bit of the blame on Providence.
Cervera says he has nothing but contempt for
Blanco, a declaration going to confirm the belief that
the admiral is a fine old gentleman.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALI,, SATURDAY, AUGUST 13, 1898.
BY the signature of the protocol outlining the
terms of peace offered by the United States
and accepted by Spain, the war is virtually
closed. It has been for us a war of victory from first
to last. Undertaken in the cause of humanity and
liberty and waged with no desire for conquest, it will
nevertheless add to our possessions and vastly in
crease our prestige as a world power.
It is a commonplace saying that what has been ac
complished in this war has materially changed the
aspect of international affairs in all parts of the globe.
As a matter of fact international relations and con
ditions are continually changing. The aspect of
affairs is never the same at any two periods of time
separated by as much as a month. Some event al
ways occurs to transmute one crisis into another or
to shift the danger point from one locality to another
far distant. Nevertheless it is fitting to refer to this
war as a potent force in changing the relations of the
nations to one another, for rarely in late years has so
great an alteration been effected in so short a time.
From the prospects before us at the present outlook
it appears that peace may bring with it responsibilities
for us as great as any imposed by the war itself. The
British are eager to have us follow up our success in
battle by launching out upon a career of territorial
expansion that will render us desirous of an alliance
with themselves, and not a few jingoes at home are
willing enough to accept the counsel that comes to us
from that source. It will be worth our while, how
ever, to look twice before we enter upon the career
of imperialism. It will not be an easy path to pursue,
and in the end it will require of us vast sacrifices of
wealth and of lives.
The London Spectator, with a candor that is to be
commended, recently admitted that our territorial
expansion would impose heavy responsibilities upon
us, but argued that it would be 'for our good to accept
them. In a striking passage it said:
"The world's future greatly depends upon the polit
ical character of the Americans. When, in 1950, they
are 200,000,000, they can crush any people except the
Slavs. To fit them for that destiny the Americans
should have difficulties, dependencies and complicated
relations with the remainder of mankind. At present
everything is too easy for them. They live too much
to themselves. They must learn to govern as well
as to be governed, and must add to their splendid
patriotism the English gift of cold and lofty tolerance.
They must keep subordinate governments as free
from corruption as their Supreme Court."
This prophecy of our future greatness is undoubt
edly enticing, but the question remains whether we
might not achieve a much better future by avoiding
those difficulties and dangers that are going to make
life harder for us. The desire to find a race capable
of whipping the Slavs makes the British very con
siderate toward us in these days, for at the present
time the Slavs are threatening the British empire.
We can hardly avoid distrusting a friendship that
confessedly desires to make life less easy for us. In
making peace with Spain we should arrange it on
terms that will not involve us in future wars nor
leave burdens upon the coming generations of our
people.
WHEN WE ARE SADDEST.
DURING this brief war, whose victorious career
is now hastening to a glorious close, we have
felt every emotion of patriotism, every impulse
of military valor, have been sensitive to every senti
ment of liberty, humanity and national grandeur;
have been roused by the exercise of our noblest facul
ties to the utterance of right words or the perform
ance of great deeds in every department of human
endeavor except two: we have not written good songs
nor set what we have written to good music.
It is most fortunate for us in all respects that we are
not among those kind of folks who cannot sing the
old songs, for were we of that nature our misfortunes
at this epoch would have been overwhelming. It is
only by the inspiration of the old songs and to the
melody of the old tunes that we have been able to
march to victory at all. Had we been compelled to
rely wholly upon the poetry of the occasion and the
music of the day, to give expression to our feelings
in the war, we should have shocked the sensibilities
not only of the tuneful Spaniards in Cuba, but even
of the Philippine Islanders, accustomed as they are
to the lugubrious chanting which accompanies their
tribal "devil dance."
Truly we Americans of this generation are saddest
when we sing. In the department of poetry our popu
lar inspirations are primitive in the extreme. We can
point with more pride to our slaughter-houses than
to our poets, and perhaps we would have a fuller
pride in the slaughter-houses if our custom permitted
the use of their mechanism on poets as well as on
pigs. Nor when we consider the kind of music our
composers have fashioned for our war songs, would
the poets be pitied much when sent to the slaughter,
for they might as well mingle their voices with the
squealing of stuck pigs as to have their poems min
gled with the squealing of such tunes.
It would be a cruelty practiced upon the public to
rehearse here many specimens of recent war poetry
for the purpose of illustrating the wretched sadness
of it all. Let it suffice that one of these war songs
pleads: "Break it gently unto mother, if a bullet lays
me low, that I fell to serve my country; don't forget
to tell her so"; that another tells how a loving vol
unteer on the eve of his departure for battle leaves
his pet dog in charge of his sweetheart and sings,
"Treat her well, Mary, treat her well, do; she is all
that ever loved me except, darling, you. If to fall
fighting my fate should be, she will remind you
sometimes of me."
These mild specimens may be borne, but we carp
fully refrain from quoting anything from the war
songs of George Alfred Townsend and the innumer
able verses modeled upon Kipling's "Recessional."
A very little of such stuff goes a long way, and we
have had much of it of late. The fact that we produce
such songs in such quantities and nothing better
constitutes one of the most curious problems in our
intellectual development.
There are more readers in America than in any
other country, more writers of average ability than
in any other country, more general culture among
the people than anywhere else, more piano, and
banjos and all forms of musical instruments â why is
it then that we can produce under the impulse of an
ardent patriotism roused by war neither a good poem
nor a good tune? Why is that when we would be
jubilant we must sing either a foreign song or a coon
song, and that when we sing one of our new war
songs it impresses the hearer as something intended
less to cheer ourselves than to frighten the foe into
fits?
Now the fact is developed that Hooley had a
scheme to buy Cuba. Probably that was to have been
but the beginning. His ultimate idea doubtless was
to get a title to the earth.
Evidently the lot of a Secretary of War, during a
time of war, is not a happy one.
THE END OF THE WOR.
DR. CLINTON REPLIES TO FATHER YORKE.
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12, 1898.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: In support of his contention that I had
attacked him the Rev. Father Yorke publishes In to-day's Call a letter
written by me last May In which I used very strong terms denunciatory of
the Monitor's attack upon me in its issue. of the 21st of that month.
The reverend father says the letter was an attack upon him. I have
never so considered it. I regarded it as a proper reply to the charges made
against me in the Monitor's aforesaid issue. I was fully aware of the
grave import of the language I used in the letterâ language which would
not have been justified under less provoking circumstances. Now, what
were the circumstances? Because I deemed it a duty and an act of justice
I voted for a renewal of the lease of the Sailors" Home to the Ladies' Sea
men's Friend Society. Father Yorke jumpeu upon me with both feet, ac
cusing me lr his paper of being "a vociferous reformer whose protestations
of philanthropy, of purity, of principle and of common veracity the public
should discount," and that I had "cast aside even the pretense of decency."
He stigmatized me a;j "a Judas who had betrayed the sacred cause of re
ligious liberty," and he even dared to insinuate that my action was gov
erned by sordid motives.
The foregoing, Mr. Editor, was my justification in denouncing the article
as "false, cowardly, contemptible, ungrateful, uncalled for and totally un
deserved." .
This whole controversy between Father Yorke and me means simply
this:
1. Father Yorke believes I did wrong in voting for the lease.
2. I know I did right in voting for the lease.
Questionâ Was Father Yorke justified in attacking me in the manner
he did?
In dismissing this painful subject I desire to thank The Call for the
valuable space given me and to express my belief that sooner or later the
reverend father will realize the injustice he has done me and that he will
make the amende honorable. C^A. CLINTON.

0Â»0OOOÂ»OÂ»O A heavy South
ern Pacific freight train had a tete-a-tete
with the only cow that Silvano owned
and now there is no cow. After tears
came real anger and then a consultation
with a wise man. who advised Silvano to
sue the company if they refused to re
compense him for his cow. A letter was
written to the claims adjuster of the
Southern Pacific in which a poverty
stricken Italian and a pulverized cow that
would give milk no more were the chief
features. The claims adjuster sidetracked
the letter and thereby proved his ability
as a money saver to the company. Sil
vano did not like the silence of the com
pany, and after obtaining the advice of
the most learned of his tribe set out for
the city to prosecute his claim in person.
He discovered the office of the claims ad
juster and obtained admittance. After in
troducing himself and stating his business

ter began his work.
"Now we can settle this matter out of
court," he said. "It Is a very small mat

THE WIUWAG MAX.
Oh, the wigwag man is a very funny lad.
As he stands with his wigwag flag on a
knoll.
And wigwags, wagwigs news good or bad
To a far distant wigwag man quite as
droll.
And he wigs up, wags down,
Wags left, wigs right.
Wiggle-waggles in the frown
Of battle's raging might.
And the wigwag flag all around is red.
That for war; and the center is wbite,
for peace.
For it wigs for the living and it wags for
the dead,
And not for a moment does the wigwag
cease.
And it wigs that, wags this,
Wags death, wigs life.
Wiggle-waggles in the hiss
Of battle's awful strife.
Oh, the wigwag man is a very shining
mark.
As he stands with his wigwag flag on
the sput,
And wigwags, wagwigs till a bullet

The wigwag falters out, while going
down, "I m shot!"
But it wigs up, wags bold,
Wags rear, wigs van.
Wiggle-waggles in the hold

RUSSIA'S DRINK REFORM.
The Russian Government is now Intro-
I ducing "spirit shops" of the so-called
I "fourth class." The managers of the
shops of the three classes hitherto In ex
istence are receiving a fixed Government
salary, and have to deposit a certain sum
of money as a guarantee, in cast' of em
bezzlement. This deposit hindered the
opening of spirit shops in small villages,
where no managers could be found Pps- !
Bessing the guarantee required. The I
"fourth-ckiss shop" removes this diffl- '
i culty, as it consists only in a permission |
i granted to a local inhabitant to buy Bpir
i its from the nearest Government shop and
j resell them in his own cottage for a small !
remuneration. This is a fresh, cruel and j
treacherous outrage which the Russian i
Government Is committing upon the peo- I
I pie in carrying out the so-called "drink j
reform/ as it practically means the lay
ing of the temptation before their very
doors, and facilitating to the utmost the
use of intoxicating drink.â Anglo-Russian.

;- v ; TnÂ£ Call has been making a quiet but
! â¢thorough investigation to Locate the
â t -exact source, and has some startling ln
. /â¢fov- â  to present.
>.-V.Xast -Monday the Board of Supervisors
. : -.r.errived another batch of proposals from
.Vpqntractors for repaying and repairing
:â¢ -Mtiiniinized streets of the accepted class.
â¢ .:'â¢'>:Â«:â¢ notice was taken of unaccepted
â  fits
â¢ ;; :jt; --was the second attempt within a
yrmÂ©nshy r mÂ©nsh to let this work, and in view of
! 'it lye)', latest developments a concise state
'", :pient ' of the manner in which the matter
':}Â£& "proceeding will be of interest to tax
payers and citizens generally.
: â â â¢"â¢ -F. "r a long time the business of street
â â â Repairing has been carried on apparently
; as -a source of private revenue to certain
pS'.cials. and the fraud on the city was
bold-faced. It did not seem to matter
/whether street repairing with bitumen
.' cost 10 or 12 or 24 cents per square foot,
"v so long as "one of the boys" got itâ and
â¢ â¢"whacked up" with somebody else. While
â . it was a fact easy to demonstrate that
'. such repair work, even with new bitumen,
cost less than 7 cents to lay, the prices
-mentioned above were paid at various
: ti-mes, and are a matter of record. One
of tHese â¢"divvies" was exposed by a con
-. tractor about six years ago, when the
latter went before a Grand Jury and com
â¢ plain . that the officials were pressing
â him too hard for private payments. Then
â¢ 'there was a howl of injured virtue from
'. the accused officialsâ and the crooked
' . work has been going on since.
"â¢â¢.â; Under Superintendent of Streets Ash
. worth the repair work was let out to a
â ". pan reputed to be a friend of the official.
â¢: The streets then cost for a while about
.â¢" J?mO. a year and were kept in fair con
â¢â¢ ciition.
â¢y.: Und^r Superintendent of Streets Am
: bfose the repair work cost the city $13, Mr
â  â  per annum, as shown by an averaging up
;-'i)f the books. The Call at the time pub
:;-.iis"hed the fact that the work was not let
"â â¢ oat by contract, and Superintendent Am
. ferose denied that he was in any way re
sponsible, but admitted that the Street
â¢'â  â¢Committee had instructed his chief dep
"' ut-y, Donovan, to have the City Street Im
' â¢ provement Company do the work at 12
,' cents a square foot. The Call's exposure
.â â â¢.resulted in the discontinuance of the
â â 'â jn'ethod.for the time being, and the Super
intendent of Streets was instructed, to
: rent a plant and do the work himself,
"'with the result that more politicians were I
' given Jobs. An Investigation of the rec
> cards of the Street Department made by
The Call shows that during the month of
â¢June 1898, the Superintendent paid out
' for material and incidental items the fol-
V lowing amounts:
.. coal, etc $142 5S
of plant 150 00
â¢ . Bltunisn, etc 187 00
â  Labor *91 00
â ;â ; Total $970 58
. â¢'-â ' As the records failed to show the quan
. tity of work performed, an inquiry was
.".inade. It was then stated that the fig
â urea had not yet been entered on the
â  books. Laterâ in fact, last Tuesdayâ the
. -.query for information was again made*
â .'.and The Call representative was told that
â  the man who measured up street-repair
â¢." work for the Superintendent had been
.' discharged and that he had not turned in
. ..the figures in his possession. Perhaps he
â¢' '-Would and perhaps he would not.
.;."- The Call has, however, a basis of com
â¢ putation upon which to proceed. Bitumen
.;'. costs $3 70 per ton. That quantity will lay
eighty square feet two and a half inches
â¢ '.thick, as is required. The $IS7 IB spent
. ' for bitumen in June would purchase about
â â¢' fifty and a half tons, which spread out
â  on the streets, eighty square feet to the
â¢ton. would cover an area of 4040 square
' feet Supposing that the whole quantity
was laid during June, one can get the
. : average cost per foot by dividing the total
cost of the repair work for the monthâ
â¢ $370 58â by the number of square feetâ
. =4940 â the result being 24 cents per square
. ; "The only po- ilble explanation of this ex
â¢ cess cost Is found in the employment
â of worthless labor. Regular contractors.
â  who were required to maintain plants and
do .the work at previous times, were very
'. willing to do it at much less than 24 cents
. per square foot. Why should it cost the
'â¢-City more? If the claim be advanced that
- the old material torn up from the streets
was used over again, an effectual objec
" â  tion arises: Can the city use old material
' 'for repairs, when it expressly forbids such
â  a thing in Its specifications for contract
. â¢ bids? Hardly. The department cannot,
: - therefore, claim that it performed more
â .repair work in June than is Indicated by
the purchases of material. A number of
â¢ comparatively Idle men, politicians on the
â  pay roll, will be a better explanation.
The city having shown its own incom
' "petency, through the Supervisors, to
" : '.do â¢ the repairing for anything like a
â¢ reasonable figure, possibly not an unex
â " pected thing among the officials con
â¢â ."cerned. the Street Committee now finds it
â¢ -expedient to suggest bids for the repair
work by outsiders. This old plan has the
additional charms held out by the pros
pect for a profitable "divvy."
" : Accordingly some Interesting specifica
tions for bids were published by the Su
pervisors' committee early In June, calling
â . lor bids on repair work and expressly
".^stipulating that the bituminized streets
â â ". ef, the city should be kept in proper repair
â i-v the contractor to the complete satis
â¢â  faction of the committee.
â¢ â â â  The- string which the committee pro
.-posed.-posed to tie to the successful bidder was
'â ;. Clearly apparent to the initiated. In real
ity the work to be required from the con
". tractor under his bond was of a most
.-â  Indefinite character, the committee re
; .serving the right to make him do either
:.v : a".lit-tlo or a lar^e mount of work for the
same money! Unless he was disposed to
\}j,e liberal with his money there was noth
. irfK to prevent the committee from mak
,-4-ng his contract unprofitable by ordering
â â¢.â him- to do two or three times as much
.repairing as would be considered suffi
â¢ relent if he divided. The beauty of these
: .specifications will be seen at a glance.
"â i'A plain warning was conveyed to contrac
tors to "keep off" unless they expected to
6 pay the price of protection. Five bidders
;â  appeared, and an outsider. J. H. Blng
"ham. was by far the lowest in his offer,
:i which was $30,000.
â¢â â  The Street Committee did not know
â '. Blngham very well. There was a long
â¢ iind anxious deliberation over the award.
. -His bond was good and no technicalities
-could be found at first glance. The bld
. â¢der was summoned before the commit
tee. He was asked if he understood all
' the possibilities of the contract. Blng
-. ham bluntly said that if the committee
â¢or Its expert on streets attempted to force
â â¢â Mm to do unnecessary repairing or lay
â¢ -new paving whore it was not needed he
:'woula go into the courts.
â â  . ; :--T.hls programme evidently did not suit
"â¢â¢the 'committee, for It was soon afterward
announced thnt the bidder Binsrham had
â .â â¢discovered a flaw or technicality In the
.â¢ specifications and the work would be re
â  advertised.
â¢ Thf> result of all this scheming reached
â¢.-a climnx in new specifications on July
28/ IS9S. in which It was stated that nine
teen blocks and fifteen crossings were
"deemed to be beyond renair and bidders
' .wrre asked to state a specific sum for the
repaying and also for the renalra nnrt
'maintenance of all accepted bltuminized
streets for a period of two years. The
same clause existed In these specifica
tions as in the former ones, making thÂ©
committee the judge of the amount of
work to be performed by the contractor
In repairing and maintaining streets for
a fixed sum of money. The bidder was
also compelled to be the owner of a plant
at the time t>Â£ presenting his bid. More
over, he was to do all of the repaying
within ninety days to the full satisfaction
of the committee. Superintendent Am
brose and Expert Sullivan.
To the latter belonged the credit of
having- discovered that the blocks and
crossings already designated should be
repaved, the work covering altogether
294,000 square feet.
Following In the footsteps of Mr. Sulli
van, so to speak, The Call has had an j
experienced man carefully go over the J
ground and moke an estimate of the ac
tual repaying needed. It was discovered
that there were very few blocks, or cross- i
ings, where it was necessary to remove j
all material. Some of the paving was bad.
Other portions were cracked somewhat,
but by no means* so badly as to need re
moval, the cracks not extending through
to the rock base. Large sections in other
localities exhibited scarcely any flaws, be
ing good for years of service.
Supervisors Smith and Lackrrjan, who
also looked into the matter, took a similar
view.
When the bids were opened it was found
that the City Street Improvement Com
pany had bid $37 Jiff for the work com
plete and that J. H. Blngham had bid $23,
ouo for the repairing and 9K cents per
square foot for the repaying necessary,
with a guarantee of five years on all re
paying.
Supervisors Smith and Lackman claimed
that Bingham's bid was the lowest, as
he offered to do all of the repair work
for $23,000 and the city need not do much
repaying under his 9^ cent proposition, as
the streets did not need it. Of course, if
the whole of the streets mentioned in the
specifications were relaid, then Bing
ham's bid would rise to the high figure of .
$50,930.
Supervisor Britt contended valiantly for ;
the City Street Improvement Company,
favoring their bid. The matter is still
hanging fire, but will come before the
Board of Supervisors next Monday after
noon.
It has been suggested that one reason
the street committee is so anxious to I
have a large number of streets re
laid at this time is to remove the e\i- i
dences of former bad contract work. ;
The shiftless manner in which some of j
the streets were put down has operated
against the use of bitumen in other cities
which had sent inspection committ'-.s
here to see how the pavements looked. :
In thl? way the peopje working the bitu
men industry were hurt, so were the
railroads that made money by hauling
It What is more natural than that
interested parties should havo used their
eloquence on the committee, or the street j
expert, to have these unsightly evidences
of failure removed?
The following table will show the quan
tity of work actually necessary to bo done
on streets, which have been scheduled for
complete or partial repaying:
Ellis street, Fillmore to Steiner, repair* nee- :
essary. 50 square
Franklin. California to Sacramento, 120
square feet.
Franklin, Sacramento to Clay, 160 square
Franklin and Clay crossing, 50 square feet.
Franklin. Clay to Washington, 173 square feet.
Franklin and Washington crossing, none.
Franklin, Washington to Jackson, 125 square :
Washington and Gough crossing, 16 square
Fulton, Devisadero to .roderlck, 1000 square j
feet- '
Fulton, Broderlck to Baker. 1000 square feet.
Scott. Oak to Page, 2500 square feet.
Scott and Page crossing. SCO square feet.
Scott. Page to Halght, 800 square feet.
Halght, Scott to Pierce. 100 square feet.

Steiner, Hayes to Fell, poor material, but
unbroken. ,
California and Sansome crossing , repairs nec
essary, 2500 square feet. /
California and Battery crossing repairs nec
essary, 2500 square feet.
California and Front crossing, basalt blocks
in good condition. _ ,
Golden Gate avenue, from Franklin to La
guna and Golden Gate avenue from Scott to
Devlsadero need 40,000 square feet of repaying.
Bartlett, Twenty-fourth to Twenty-sixth, j
31.968 square feet of repaying.
Capp and Twenty-fourth, street crossing, 3840
square feet of repaying.
Third. Mission to Howard, 9000 square feet
of repairs.
Grand total: Repairs, 962,264 square
feet. At the price which the representa- I
tive of the City Street Improvement Com- ]
pany said before the committee was the j
basis of their bidâ 7 cents per footâ the
work of repaying necessary ought to cost
$6738 48, as against 520.5&0 for the 294,000
feet advertised, in the specifications.
The records show that for three years
the average cost of all repairs, at the
price of 12 cents per square root, has been
18382 per year for all bituminized work.
Yet the street committee recommends the
acceptance of the City Street Improve
ment Company's bid of 137,797, which large
amount of money will do nothing toward
repaying the worst blocks in the city
which have been accepted and yet re
main as an eyesore and a disgrace.
Supervisor Sheehan made the statement
at the meeting of the street committee
that Mr. King, superintendent of the
Merchants' Association, had recommend
ed the repaying of all the streets men
tioned in the specifications. Mr. King
informs The Call that neither he, nor the
â¢Merchants' Association, have taken any
action in the matter. They are interested
just now in securing the removal of the
unsightly cobble stones.
It seems hardly possible, in view of
the light now thrown upon the matter,
that the Supervisors will find it neces
sary "for the city's Interests" to make an
award until better stipulations are pro
vided.
NOTABLE EXCURSION
To Monterey Sunday, September 4.
Round Trip Tickets. Only $2.
The passenger department of the
Southern Pacific Company have Just
Issued a preliminary announcement to
the effect that on Sunday, September
4, they will run two or more splendid
trains of first-class coaches to historic
Monterey, and as In former years will
sell round trip tickets at the extremely
low rate of $2.
These annual excursions to Monterey
have proved the most popular of any
sent out by the Southern Pacific, and
Judging from the numerous inquiries
that are being made at the ticket of
fices in regard to this excursion the
patronage will be larger than ever.
In taking this delightful trip the ex
cursionist has an opportunity to visit
a chain of interesting resort places,
namely, Hotel del Monte, the historic
town of Monterey and that great fam
ily resort place, Pacific Grove, where
the beautiful pine forests extend to the
edge of the bay shore.
In due time a variety of advertising
matter will be distributed to the pub
lic, giving full details and information
regarding this outing.
On this occasion the citizens of Mon
terey have arranged for a very attrac
tive programme of old-time Spanish
sports, such as the lassoing of a steer,
horse racing, dexterous riding, etc.
As In former instances, this excur
sion will be under the personal super
vision of Colonel William H. Menton,
excursion passenger agent of the South
ern Pacific Company.

LOTTERY OF HORSE BUYING
RECORDS GOLDEN STATE CAN
BE PROUD OF.
Phenomenal Track Performances of
the Keating, McDowell and
Kelly Horses This
Season.
The California horsemen that sent
strings of trotters and pacers to Denver
and thence East are covering themselves
with glory and filling their pockets with
coin, incidentally. Searchlight, in Tommy
Keating's hands, has won from the fast
est pacers In the land, is considered in
vincible, and at Cleveland went three
heats easily in 2:05%, 2:05 J 4, and 2:06%,
with Chehalls of Oregon in tho place. Pre
vious to this the son of Dark Night had
established a four-year-old record of
2:04%. Anaconda, in the same string, also
paced in 2:04%. He is by Knight, 2:22,
from an Algona mare. In Admiral Keat
ing's stable is the great Eros mare Dione,
â who trotted in 2:09. She belongs to A. B.
Spreckels, who bred her. Of Dione the
Buffalo World says: "Dione, 2:09%, by
Eros, is about the best race mare ever
brought East from California, with the
possible exception of Hulda, 2:08%." As
A. B. Spreckels also bred and owned
Hulda, who was a half-sister to Dione,
there must be some gratification felt by
that gentleman in the fact that he reared
and sent on the grand circuit the two
best trotting mares that ever left Cali
fornia. Tom Keating oas been very sick
most of the time since he left the Golden
State, but McHenry has Deen handling
the reins very skillfully for the Califor
nia horseman.
Andy McDowell, who made a driving
reputation at the East Several years ago,
when with Monroe Salisbury, has been
having things come his way with the
three-year-old pacing colt Klatawah, a
brother to Charles Derby, 2:30. KlaurVah
has made a record of 2:{fi*Aâ one not like
ly to be beaten in a very short time. It
is odd that Klatawah should be a brother
to Charles Derby, sire of Diablo, who
made a pacing record of 2:09% when he
was a four-year-oldâ then the best on
record. McDowell also distinguished
himself by driving Lena N, the Sidney
mare, a mile in a race in 2:05)4, the race
record for pacing mares. Another Cali
fornia bred animal that has accomplished
much is Directum Kelly, by Direct, 2:OSVi-
He won the very rich M. i*t M. stake
at Detroit and again won at Cleve
land for his owner, John Kelly, who
also drove for Monroe Salisbury and
made a good name for himself. The best
mark made by a three-ye<n-Â»id trotting
filly this season in a race was that of
Ellen Madison, 2:19%, by James Madison,
217%; the fastest by a four-year-old trot
ting filly by Miss Beatrice, 2:13%, by Di
rect. 2:OSMn the fastest record by a three
year-old pacer that of Klatawah, spoken
of above; fastest by an aged pacing geld
ing by Anaconda, 2:04%. The fastest of
the new pacing performers (stallions) is
Donnough, 2:12%. by Norval (son of Elec
tioneer), and the fastest "new" 2:10 per
former is Miss Logan, 2:08*4. by General
Logan, dam by Firetail, son of Norfolk.
General Logan is by Alex Button, who
was owned by the late George \\ oodard
of Yolo County, this State. Verily Cali
fornia horses are great in many spheres
and wherever you find them.
Xorvin G, a bay gelding, by Xorval. re
cently paced the last three heats of a six
heat race at Portland, Me., in 2:l3V*.
Rlco^by ' Arion, 2:07% (sold for $125.
000), has made a trotting record of 2:12%.
He is one of the most sensational of the
four-year-olds.
Ben Kenney. for years the trainer of
Marcus Daly's trotters and pacers, has
resigned the position, and been sue. â¢
by Joe Rea. The latter has gone East
from Montana to relieve Kenney.
Torslda'a recent win of the $2000 Daly
stake at Anaconda with Los Prietos in
the place, speaks mighty well of Cali
fornia-bred horses, for in that race was
entered the pick of Marcus Daly's big
stable, as well as that of others of no lit
tle importance. Callfornlasent to Montana
this season the best sprinter competing
there in Miss Rowena. the record-break
er' Lucky Star, Flashlight (who has run
miles in 1:40 oftener than almost any
man's horse), Dolore (who established a
new mile and a sixteenth record), Val
encienne (who ran six furlongs in IMS I **,
Peixotto (who went the route at Jiutte
in l'l3Vfe) and many others fast enough
to win anywhere up to seven furlongs.
Torsida has always been a good filly, but
her star was a trifle dimmed by the run
ning of the phenomenal Briar Sweet at
the local tracks last winter and spring.
However, "Daggle" Smith's Hlly was
good enough to win from Martha, a
three-year-old miss that finished first yes
terday at Saratoga at a mile and a fur
long in 1:54%,. In fact, Martha is at
present considered almost unbeatable at
the far East at any distance from six
furlongs to a mile and a quarter.
Oraibee, the chestnut two-year-old geld
ing which won at St. Louis yesterday for
Dan Honig, has a rather odd history.
He was raised by L. J. Rose who owned
his sire Orizaba, and his darn, Blondi
nette by Joe Hooker. One day Mr. Rose
took 'a notion to sell off all his wean
lings and six by the then untried sires
Nomad and Orizaba were aisposed of
for a sum not far from $200, Charley Kerr
of Bakersfield being buyer after Ben Ben
lamln of the Chronicle had concluded he
didn't want them. Now in this lot of
six that went begging for a time at $2Â«Â»
was Oraibee, yesterday s winner, sold lor
$130 as a yearling; Ranier, a stake-win
ner at Oakland last spring, and sold for
1300 when a yearling, and last but not
lwrLflt Toluca, which brought $500 as a
vparling and now could not be purchased
\or $7000. Toluca is justly considered the
bf>st two-year-old filly In the United
States and her wins over W. Overton,
Form'e'ro, Kentucky Colonel and other
nrÃokeriacks show that the estimate
nHce<? upon her worth is not too high.
All this goes to demonstrate what a lot
tery the purchase of young horseflesh is
the best filly in the country, a stake-win
nine colt and a race-winning gelding- out
o a bunch of *lx sold for $200! And there
may be others in that lot which aver
ted $33 1-8 to make a mark In
thA raring line. Toluca's sire. Nomad,
could have been bought for $300 any day
in 1897 good horse as he once was, but
rinw we suppose his owner would turn
Sp lite nose at $2000 were it to be offered
tO The m state Fair meeting begins Sep
tember 5 and though fully 150 of our
horses are racing in Montana, over a
hundred will have returned to the Gold
en State by the time the bell rings for
the first race on the opening day.

was a native of Switzerland. He had
been drinking heavily of late.
RETREATED
BEHIND A
HIGH FENCE
Cowardice of Burkes
Companions.
RAN FROM THE SCENE
FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO
THE MISSION TRAGEDY.
Evidence to Show That the Men De
serted the Brave Lieutenant
After He Was Shot
Down.
The trial of Policemen Kennedy, Mar
lowe, Wilkinson and Merchant, the
"brave" officers who so cowardly desert
ed Lieutenant Burke when he was shot by
Theodore Park Haynes, the eccentric
tinker, was resumed before the Police
Commissioners last night.
Thomas Dudy testili;,-d that after Burke
was shot he saw the accused officers run
to a place of safety. They then emptied
their revolvers ut. Haynes, but they were
so excited they failed to bring him down.
Marlowe; after exhausting his ammuni
tion, sent a boy named Conroy to get him
an additional supply.
Emile Ott, a young man, deposed that
he saw Lieutenant Burke approach
Haynes 1 cabin. lie drove up in the pa
trol wagon. Burke was accompanied by
thrfo other officers, whose numes the wit
ness did not know.
When Burke was shot the policemen
who accompanied him ran away. Oflicer
Merchant, who was about twenty-ttvc
feet away from the cabin, drew his re
volver and vainly tried to shoot Haynes.
The witness identified Marlowe as beinK
the man who took refuge behind a fence.
In answer to the questions of Attorney
Dunne, Ott said that he assisted Cashel,
the patrol wagon driver, in dragging
Burkes body from Haynes' cabin. He
was positive that the officials ran in
different directions immediately after
Burke had been shot down. The witness
declared that Marlowe was so excited
that he kicked a hole in a fence and
crawled through the aperture. From this
position he emptied his revolver at
Haynes.
Sam Waters, the next witness, said he
had warned Burke to be cautious, as he
feared that Haynes would shoot him.
The lieutenant replied that he was abla
to take care of himself, and immedi
ately proceeded to arrest the murderous
tinker. Burke had already drawn his re
volver when he was shot. The officers
who were with him, after retreating,
blazed away at Haynes. A short time
before the shooting Officer Kennedy tried
to arrest Haynes, but seeing a revolv* r
in his hand he got "cold feet" and back
ed away. Wilkinson and Marlowe wre
present, but, like Kennedy, they lost
their nerve and made no attempt to ar
rest the tinker.
George Ryan, who conducted a store
contiguous to Haynes' cabin, testified
that he saw Burke drive up to the cabin
in the patrol wagon. He was met by
Marlowe, Wilkinson and Kennedy. Afti r
learning tho cause of the excitement he
waved them back and started for the
cabin. Rvnn did not witness the shoot-
Ing, nor cfid he se<? the officer's run arWay.
V. W. Peters said he saw Marlowe get
behind a fence; he then blazed away ;.t
Haynes, but failed to hit him. He called
to his companions to "come up and get
Burke and he would get Haynes," which
he signally failed to do.
James Ford saw Kennedy behind a
fence with a shotgun. He was pouring
shot into Haynes' cabin.
John McGrath, the next witness, said
he saw Kennedy retreat before Haynes'
revolver. He and his companions Feemtd
badly rattled.
At this juncture further hearing of the
case was continued until next Thursday.
THE CHINESE BUREAU
MAKES A DISCOVERY
MONGOLS ADMITTED AS OMAHA
EXHIBITORS RETURN HERE.
i Arrest of a Coolie Chair-Mender for
Entering the United States by
False Pretenses.
The Chinese Bureau, under Chief Mere
dith of the customs service, has been
I keeping a sharp eye on the 400 Chinese
j men and women admitted here recently
for the purpose of appearing as exhlblt
; ora in the Chinese village ot MoÂ« Lee Wuh
lat the Trans-Mississippi International
! Exposition at Omaha. Mr. Meredith made
inquiries recently of a Federal ollloer in
Omaha, and learned that the number of
exhibitors was much less than 400, and he
shrewdly suspected that the missinc nvn
had remained in California witl% the in
tention of staying here Indefinitely.
Their names and descriptions were
transmitted to the Chinese Bureau In this
city, and last Monday several customs
'< officials made a raid on a house in Wav
i t-rly place and found one of the Omaha
exhibitors named Lan Chong. On being
landed in this city as an exhibitor he had
received from Collector Jackson a certl
â  flcat'\ dated May 18 of this year, certify
i ing that Lan Chong was duly accredited
i as an employe of the Mcc Lee Wall VII
' lage Company of Chicago, 111., an exhlbl
| tor at the Omaha Exposition, and that he
I had been permitted to enter this country
! as such employe, In pursuance of the act
of Congress approved June 30, IMÂ»7. Tho
certificate is valid for throe months after
the close of the exposition, and it< to be
surrendered when the holder departs from
the United States to the Collector of Cus
toms at the port of embarkation.
Chong had been In this city ever sinoe,
making his living a.s a ehairmender. He
was arrested, and will be examined before
United States Commissioner Hcacock
next week. There is no doubt that he
will bo deported.
RAILROAD IMPROVEMENTS.
New Constructions of the Southern
Pacific Company.
The Southern Pacific Company has ho
gun to ballnst the road from Lathrop to
Fresno. This work will be continued
from time to time, the company using
the locomotives that are. disengaged from
other more pressing use. At Tehama a
new steel bridge will be built. The prog
ress in the work on tho Oakland mole
has been very noticeable, and tho com
pany expects "in the near future to Intro
duce its twenty-minute ferry service.
The new drawbridge over Oakland
Creek will be ready for use about Octo â > r
1 The county has asked the company's
permission to uso their bridge during the
construction of the new bridge. The War
Department's order to remove the Harri
son-street bridge w'll be enforced by the
company unless Alameda County obtains
permission from the Government for its
further use.
LOTTIE WAS EXPENSIVE.
Arrest of It. C. Long for Defrauding
an Innkeeper.
R. C. Long, an Eastern drummer, wns
arrested last night and charged with de
frauding the Baldwin Hotel out of $233.
On May 1 Long and a woman, who is
known as Lottie Lacey. registered at the
Baldwin as man and wife.. Long re
mained 6nly a few days. The woman,
however, lived in the hotel for two
months and then hnd her bill nent to
Long. He refused to pay it. claiming
that the woman was not his wife and
that he had not authorized her to con
tract the indebtedness.
Long subsequently left the city, but re
turned last evening and was arrested.
He was immediately released on $500
bond forwarded by two of his friends.
THE FARRAGUT
IN COLLISION
Crashed Into a Wharf at
Union Iron Works.
HER STEM BADLY TWISTED
VESSEL HAD TO BE DOCKED TO
MAKE REPAIRS.

of the Schooner Mary Ann, Is
Drowned While on His
Way to Klondike.
The United States torpedo-boat destroy
er Farragut had a narrow escape at the
completion of her trial trip the other da 1 ".
As it was, her stem was all twisted and
bent by striking the Union Iron "Works
wharf, and the vessel had to be docked
fur repairs. The stem has been complete
ly taken out of the vessel, and it has now
been almost straightened out. It will
then be put back in the torpedo-boat
chaser, and by that time the changes in
the rudder will have been made and tne
flier will be ready for another trial.
When the Farragut completed her trial
over the measured mile she went back
toward the Union Iron Works at a fast
clip. Owing to the fact that her rudder
was not properly balanced she did not
steer as well as was expected, but that
fault was not responsible for the acci
dent that followed. As the warship ap
proached her berth at the wharf tne
signal "Full speed astern" was rung up
on the indicator. There was some hitch
in the engine-room, and the engines did
not respond as quickly as was expected.
Before the vessel could gather sternway
she struck the wharf, and the result was
a stem twisted in half a dozen different
directions. An hour later the Farragut
was on the drydock, and the work of
taking out the twisted iron began. The
torpedo-boat destroyer will bo better
than ever as soon as she leaves the dry
dock. The stem will not show the slight
est trace of the collision, and the steering
gear will be adjusted to the immense
power and great speed of the vessel.
The Alaska Exploration Company's
steamer Lelanaw sailed for St. Michael
last night with quite a number of gold
hunters, while there was more freight of
fering than she could carry. Dr. Hart,
late of the Board of Health, was among
the passengers. He goes to Dawson to
open a drugstore ana go into practice.
The members of the Board of Health and
a great number of his friends were down
to see him off. Three, steers that went up
on the steamer caused a great deal of
excitement during the morning. They re
fused to enter the boxes in which they
were to be carried to St. Michael, and
one of them broke a horn off in his efforts
to get away. They several times jumped
clean over their prisons, and the vaqueros
had to lasso them to prevent an escape.
A big black fellow nearly drove Freight
Clerk George Thorp and Customs In
spector Gallagher overboard, and had it
not been for a friendly sentry-box on the
wharf both of them would have got a
ducking. - , - ''. 'â â '' â â '<â -'

Tho Harbor Commissioners yesterday
appointed Hugo R. Herold office collector,
vice John R. Maginess, deceased. The
San Francisco and San Mateo electric
railroad was granted permission to lay its
tracks along East street from Howard to
the ferries. This will give the road a
terminus at the new depot, instead of at
the foot of Steuart street. Acting on the
advice of Chief Engineer Holmes, the
Commissioners decided that the roadbeds
of all street railways on State property
shall be of steel and concrete, so as to
make them permanent. C','i. Â

AIDED BY MBS. PINKHAM.
m
Mrs. W. E. Paxtox, Youngtown,
North Dakota, writes about her strug-
gle to regain health after the birth of
her little girl:
11 Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â It is with
pleasure that I add my testimony to
your list, hoping that it may induce
others to avail themselves of your val-
uable medicine.
"After tho birth of my little girl,
three years ago, my health was very
poor. I had leucorrhoea badly, and a
terrible bearing-down j pain which
gradually grew worse, until I could do
no work. Also had headache nearly
all the time, and dizzy feelings. Men-
struations were very profuse, appear-
ing every two weeks.
*' I took medicine from a good doctor,
but it seemcu to do no good. I was
becoming alarmed over my condition,
when I read your advertisement in a
paper. I sent at once for a bottle of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
ponnd, and after taking two-thirds of
the bottle I felt so much better that I
send for two more. After using three
bottles I felt as strong and well as any
one. j
44 I think it is the best medicine for
female weakness ever advertised, and
recommend it to every lady I meet suf-
fering from this trouble." (?'
Maternity is a wonderful experience
and many women approach it wholly
unprepared. Childbirth under right
conditions need not terrify women.
The advice of Mrs. Pinkham is freely
offered to all expectant mothers, and
her advice is beyond question the most
valuable to bo obtained. If Mrs. Pax-
ton had written to Mrs. Pinkham be-
fore confinement she would have been
saved much suffering. Mrs. Pinkham's
address is Lynn, Mass.

THE COLONEL
IS NOW
RAUER'S ADVISED
A question that is bothering the patrons
of Recreation Turk to no little extent Is:
What t. - Colonel T. P. Robinson's position
In the P.aciflc Coast League?
Two weeks ago 1 could not have at
â¢ tempted to answer the perplexing ques
tion, for .the reason that I, like a great
â  many of .the "knowing ones," was of
the opinion that the colonel was nothing
else than an .ornament, and was connected
with the league only in that capacity.
"This rather novel opinion 1 have enter-.
' talned ever since the consolidation, but
, before this combining of forces, in which
' the prude managers and credulous play
ers were so beautifully betrayed, 1 had
' occasion to entertain a very exalted idea
Âi)f- this man Rcubinson.
This coincidence may strike some of the
past lovers of tins game us being rather
singular; yet the 'ingenuousness of my re
â  .mark, for the present, must stand un
'controverted.
During the strangle betweeen Central
Park and Recreation, I accidentally met
' the colonel, and, being in the company
' of a few representatives of the Central
organization, it was but natural that they
should expatiate on the respective merits
/.and drawing abilities of their clubs.
The colonel, â¢whom 1 afterward learned
had a great reputation for expatiating
through his "sun bonnet," had his op
ponents vanquished from the very start,
when it came to argument. It was not
the veracity of his statements, which were
. delivered with amazing alacrity anVl effl
â  oaciousness, that gave him such a lead,
â¢' but it was the careless manner with
.â which he handle*! that much respected
. 'noun known as money. He was authority
" â  for the statement that he had $1,000,000
Lacking, and that he was prepared to ex
â  pend that amount in freezing; out the Cen
â¢ tral Park league.
â¢ My friends from that league, although
they made no attempt to lessen the eili
â¢ cacy of the most extraordinary avowal,
still showed some signs of doubt,
' which the colonel saw fit to rent
:â¢ r. To Jo tliis, however, the man
had to act with dexterity ami prud
yet', as you will readily perceive, he â wad
not lacking in either.
"Just to show you how I stand" (and he
was able to maintain his equilibrium, as
tho beverages were slow in taking effect,
as -were the other ingredients) said he to
me, "I'll give you &:&00 to play ball in my
yard."
At the moment of this offer I was not
aware of the fact that I could earn my
.bread through the generosity of The Call,
and, therefore, accepted the colonel's fic
titious offer -with exultation and some
precipitancy.
Picture to yourself my shattered sensa
tions when he added, "That is. If you can
secure your release from Baltimore." As
.this was Impossible, my dealings with
â¢the colonel ended then and there; yet,
that million-dollar harangue which he
seemed to delight in divulging had
a most soothing effect, and , left
'the' impression that he, despite
' ills beautifully proportioned semi-dreams,
was uncontestably the premier and .Na
poleon of delusive ball magnates.
.' This, of course, was before the con
â¢ solidation, and it would be an impossible
â¢â lnstance of injustice to censure me for
entertaining such an exalted opinion of
â¢ him.
Now, however, since the two opposing
' factions have combined, as previously
.mentioned, and tranquillity apparently
prevails, the colonel has been deprived of
"his rights, and this fact has caused the
.-question, "What is the colonel's position
â  â¢in .the league now?" to be advanced.
. when the question was first put to me,
â¢I was really afraid to conjecture, as 1 was
â¢ still wondering how it was that he went
. through that million so rapidly.
â¢â¢â¢.1 could not, however, blind myself to
â¢â¢the reality that he, on Saturdays and
Sundays at Recreation Park, looked more
â¢'like a piece of Oriental bric-a-brac, im
â¢ ported with the intention of being used
:.us a piece of decorative art, for Mr.
'Raver is a man of exquisite taste, and
.does much for the lovers of the game.
. 1 was alone In this, for the majority
- fcl'aimed that he was employed to chase
â  the balls that went over the fence, and
"'oiso to incidentally look pleasant when
:his proprietor, Mr. Bauer, was in cvi
. \dence. All these opinions were, however,
â¢ unproductive, as they were but casual
conjectures, and it was my lot to discover
. thereal capacity of the colonel as regards
the Pacific Coast League.
" This occurred but a short time ago.
Through Mr. Bunker, one of the manag
ers of- the San Franciscos. Mr. Raver
made me an offer to play ball, as a pitch
er, in the San Francisco Club. 1 was of
fered %mO for twenty-four games, and
would not accept. Six hundred dollars
â was the next and I would not think of it.
To $650 I paid no, and to $700 I would not
listen. Then I was prevailed upon to .make
a proposition, which I did. Eight hun
dred dollars and a pitcher's share of the
receipts was my price, and I never change.
â¢ I also inserted with my offer that the $00
be put up in cold cash in such a manner
that the ingenuity of Mr. Raver would be
useless. They would not come any higher
than $700 without a player's dividend, and
1 was also told that no money would be
put up. The latter remark put an end to
all proceedings, for with me it is "a bird
in the hand is worth two In the bush"; for
I had a little experience with Mr. Hanlon
of the famous Baltlmores, in which I was
loser to the extent of $32, and which, by
the way, Is the baseball manner of re
paying faithful service done tolerably
'â¢well. To place me in a false light with
the Frisco players these gentlemen saw
fit to circulate the report that they had
offered me a thousand dollars and I re
fused. If the money was not put up
where I could see it once in a while,
Just to know that it was there where they
left it. I certainly would refuse, but no
such offer was made me, and these gen
tlemen had no right to say so.
So far so pood. But where does the
colonel come In? Well, the colonel was the
man who advised Raver how to make the
offers, and the colonel is the one who said I
"Don't put up a cent," with the thought, |
."we might get it all back." The colonel
is, therefore, Mr. Raver's baseball ad-
Viaer, and it is cruelly unjust to allude to
him as an ornament, ball chaser or bus
director. He is adviser to Raver, and
Raver is a great man. Why, he controls
Recreation Park and the baseball depart
ment of The Call, so I am told.
To-day the Santa Cruz and San Joses
â¢will compete. It is whispered around
that the emergency board will be pres
ent, but the colonel dare not verify the
rumor. The line-up is as follows:

XILPATRICK'S FIGHT ON.
Petition for a Writ of Mandate Occu-
pying Judge Hunt's Time.
The fight of E. C. Kilp.-itrlck for a writ
of mandate to compel the Board of Edu
n to reinstate him as principal of
the Bush; rig School is now oc
cupying the time of Judge Hunt. Kll
patrick not only seeks to recover his po
sition, but to be awarded Judgment for
:l months' salary accompanying the
on.
The dismissal of Kilpatrick was the cul
miriation of a misunderstanding between
him and School Directors Waller and Ra
fpan, whom Kilpatrick charged with bav
iolated the trust Imposed upon them.
The merits of the controversy were thor r
oughly ventilated at the time and result
ed finally in the dismissal of Kilpatrick.
When the case opened yesterday morning
both sides stipulated that the dismissed
td a proper certificate and was
competent to teach the branches em
! in the course pursued In the Even
jut,' Business School. In consequence the
only point in issue relates to the power of
tin- board to dismiss him upon the
grounds which will be assigned at the
trial. Kilpatrick was on the stand for a
short time, but did not finish his story
lip to the time of adjournment. The case
, d -to-day.
McAdie Is Avenged.
T. W. Fltzpatrlck, saloonkeeper, 655 Sac
ttto street, Who was arrested Wednes
day on the complaint of A. G. McAdie,
the local forecast official, for cruelty to
is in throwing 1 a kitten to a fox
t'-rncr to be mangled, pleaded guilty In
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday and
was fined $5. Pitzpatrick had demanded a
jury but changed his mind.
THE FIELD OF SPORT.
FLEET DOGS WILL
CHASE
CUNNING HARES.
Steadily grows the number of coursing
dogs and each week an augmentation of
the coursing attendance is noted. At
Union Park to-day there will open the In-
itial runs of two stakes. The lesser is a',
sapling event, embracing ten fleet young-
Sters of top notch breeding. The major
feature is an open contest with sixty-two
"long-tails" out for laurels and lucre. At
Ingleside the card includes but one stake,
but more Is hardly needed. No leys than
eighty-eight candidates will compete, and
they are of an aggregate quality acknowl-
edging no peer in America, if in the
world. The total money'disbursed at the
two parks in prizes approximates SI6SO.
That the greyhounds are being trained
to the acme of condition nowadays neces-
sarily goes without saying. Coursing has
SALMON FISHING AT CAPITOLA
ANGLERS are enjoying first class sport at Capltola now. Commodore
Taylor, accompanied by A. H. Bonner and F. S. Chadbourne, fishing
from Air. Taylor's launch, caught 12 salmon and six large seabass in
half a day's fishing. Bonner landed the largest seabass of the season.
It weighed 54 pounds. Cnadbourne fainted after successfully landing a 35
pound salmon. On August 4 Superintendent Frank Reamir of Capitola,
with F. A. Hihn and a Mr. Johnson, also enjoyed excellent sport. One of
the salmon captured scaled 42 pounds. The seVen-year-old son of Mr.
Reamir will be seen in the illustration standing close by the quinnat.
The largest catch of salmon was made by a party consisting of Commo
dore Taylor, Miss Dolia Elster. Miss Jennie Pottenger and Frank King.
In three hours' fishing they landed 19 salmon. 8 .sc-abass and numerous
mackerel, and still there are just as good fish in the sea aÂ» ever were
caught.
not yet reached the stage at which "there
is millions In it," but a winning bound
may pull down his weight in gold during
his racing life at the present rate, and
some are doing so.
. The racing at both parks to-day will
commence at the usual hour and continue
through to-morrow.
Of the ten saplings running at Union
Park four are owned by it. E. de B. Lo
pez of Pleasanton. The Pleasanton young
sters should certainly annex a goodly
slice ot the money. Mr. Lopez also has
' several candidates in the open stake.
Arthur Massey baa been giving his
Eastern brace some unusually nara work
during the week. Hadiwist and Hot Stuff
are both dogs of class and .should do sev
eral flags at Jngleside this week. Last
Sunday their share of the pie was $13V.
: Since his arrival Massey's winnings at
' Ingleside have been as follows: Hadiwist,
$2%; Hot Stuff. $IGS; Beauty, $47 50; Hattel,
$38; and Persimmons, $10. Total, since
May 31, J537 50.
Metallic looks to have another stake at
Union Park this week. The Curtis dogs
and Theron seem to be his only dangerous
competitors. At the same time there are
many chances in coursing.
John Eagan was asked to set a price on
! his puppy, Billy Gladstone, at Inglesiriu,
even before he had landed the stake. Mr.
Eagan whispered, "One thousand dol
lars." It was not paid, but the dog will
win it out if he lives long enough. He Is
only sixteen months old.
It was alleged at Ingleside last Sunday
that False Kiatterer should beat Conne
mara because Flying Buck had once led
Rosette three lengthsâ which it was
claimed Connemara hadn't doneâ while
the Flatterer had been regularly leading
Flying Buck four lengths. Such, presum
ably, is form playing. But form players
would have conceded a good lead to Moon
dyne in a run with Hadiwist and the same
to Mialmo against Hot Stuff. Yet Mialmo
was downed by Johnny 11, who in turn
lost to Hot Stuff, while Skyball beat
Moondyne only to lose to Hadiwist.
Mooridyne is the favorite this week at
Ingleside, but he has hard game before
him Moreover, there is a heavy pjay on
6everal of the others, chief among them
being False Flatterer.
The winners of the run down at Tngle-
Bide this afternoon look to be Rosie R,
Hot Stuff, Moondyne. Ida, Victor Queen,
False Flatterer, Rush o' Hill, Lee Boy.

TENNIS MEN LOOK
TO DEL
MONTE COURTS.
; Tennis has taken a boom In the last few
j weeks and present indications promise a
return to the days of tournaments and
lnterclub rivalry. There will he an invi
tatlon doubles at the California Club this
[ afternoon and some special matches will
.be played on the courts of the Alameda
Tennis Club to-morrow,
j The doubles tournament in this city will
\ bring out, with the exception of George
Whitney, all the older playing members
of the California Club. The teams en
\ tered are George Whitney and Colonel
Lindermann. R. J. Davis and John O.
; Blanchard, Werner Stauff and John Kil
gariff, Harvey Walter and Walter Me-
Gavin. Each team will play every other
team and the ranking will be adjusted ac
> cording to games lost and won. Should
I there be a tie for first place the cham
: pionship will be decided by playing- the tie
j off. Handsome prizes will be awarded the
winning team. This is the third Saturday
! tournament within a month.
A most earnest effort is being made to
hold a big invitation tournament at Mon
terey a week from to-day. It Is the inten
! tion of the Del Monte tournament pro
moter to secure the best Mix players from
the California Club and the best six from
the other side of the bay. The California
players who have signified their willing
i ness to enter the tournament yre George
Whitney. Welhe, Smith, Adams, Cheese
: brough and Robert N. Whitney. From
: Oakland and Alameda the representatives
j will be Nicholson, Stone, Selby, Bowen
i Holmes and Murdock. An attempt has
'â â  been made to enlist the Hardy brothers
i but it does not seem likely that they will
i play. Their business and studies occupy
i their full time at present, to the exclusion
j of everything else.
I Â The ,/natch between Joe Daily and Wil
liam M. Thatcher, which was to be played
! last Monday on the Oakland courts did
j not eventuate. The directors of the Cali
; fornia Club put a ban upon Daily's play
ing on outside courts and the dual contest
did not take place for that reason.
CRICKETING TROPHY
IS ALL BUT WON.
Last Sunday's match at Alameda was
the fourth played this season between the
Pacific and Alameda clubs for the Hunter
Harrison cup, which was won in 189G and
1897 by the Alamedas. The Alameda team
went to the wickets, and kept the Pa
cific men in the field all day. R. B. Hogtie
(captain) and J. J. Moriarlty made 87
runs each, J. H. Saunders 42, and, when
stumps were drawn for the day, eight
wickets were down for 317 runs. H Ward
was not out 6, F. Stahl not out 10 and
F. C. Driffleld did not bat. Even if these
three should add little to the Alameda
score, the Pacific eleven lias a hard task
before it. It is hardly possible for it to
win, and not probable that it will draw
the game.
The match will be continued to-day,
and, if the Alamedas only succeed in
making it a drawn game, they will have
won two and drawn two of the five
cup matches to be played this season
and will be the champions of IS9B as well
as of IS9C and 1897. The Hunter Harri
son cup, having been won three times in
succession by the Alamedas, will become
the absolute property of the club.
The Alameda team Is made up of R. B
Hogue (captain), I. H. Spiro, J. J. Mori
arlty, F. J. Croll, J. H. Saunders, J J
R. Peel, R. Bird. H. Ward, V. Seebeck'
F. Stahl and F. C. Driffleld. The Pacific
eleven is composed of B. F. Musson (cap
tain), T. W. G. Wallace, C. B. Hill, J. H
Harbour, C. P. Coles, J. J. Theobald. C.
Townsley, J. H. McLean, George Theo
bald, Fane Sewell and H. P. Gordon.
Grand Jury Defended.
Judge Belcher has taken umbrage at
certain insinuations that have been made
against the present Grand Jury, and does
not hesitate to defend that body. He
states that there is no foundation for the
intimation that he intends to dismiss the
jury because of its failure to reach re
sults.
CYCLING EVENTS
AT HAND
AND IN PROSPECT.
As yet no entry blanks or definite par
ticulars have been received here of the
Stockton meet scheduled for August 28.
The promoters should get their blanks
ami Information out at once, if they ex
pect any large attendance from this city,
as the men will not go into training and
the "rooters" will not make arrangements
for the trip until they are assured the
meet will come off.
Entry blanks and prize lists from San
Jose are expected In a few days for the
Garden City Wheelmen's big meet on
September 9. This promises to be the
most important wheel gathering of the
year.
By request of the members of the Cali
fornia Cycling Chib, Captain R. A. Coul
ter will repeat toimorrow the 'run to
Tocaloma held last Sunday. They will
take the 8 a. m. Sausalito boat and train
to Fairfax. A large crowd is expected
on the ride.
Ivan Treadwell and his manager. King
Rhys, are located at the Elmhurst track,
Treadwell being in training for the Stock
ton and San Jose meets later on. He is
showing great speed, and will give the
top notch amateurs a run for their
money.
The Mountain View Cyclers have elect
ed the following officers for the ensuing
year: P. W. Clark, president; Frank
Grant, vice president; James C. Kennedy,
recording secretary; A. W. Elerhorn,
financial secretary; Fred Cutter, treas
urer; John S. Bailey and W. A. Clark, di
rectors. The club is in a flourishing con
dition.
It is proposed to give three great races
at the close of the season, when threu
of the best riders in America at middle
dlstance racing will be chosen as com
petitors for the American championship.
As America has the best riders in the
world now, this >vill virtually mean the
world's championship. The men who are
most likely to be chosen are Eddie Mc-
Duffle, Tom Linton and Jimmy Michael.
K. Ross LiOzier, Jhe well-known Cleve
land manufacturer, whose arrival here
was noted In The Call Thursday, is spend
ing the days sight-seeing and renewing
old acquaintances. To-night and to-mor
row Bob Lennle will entertain Mr. I,< Kier
ami party at the tavern on the top of
Mt. Tamalpnls.
The regular monthly meeting of the
California Associated Cycling clubs, to
have been, held last Saturday night at the
Reliance Club, Oakland, had to be post
poned for want of a quorum. San i ran
dsco is the place for the association's
meetings, and none of them should be
held elsewhere. A quorum Is always as
sured in the metropolis, and the associa
tion has grown out of its swaddling
clothes when monthly visits to the clubs
were in order and each club was expected
to take its turn entertaining. Why can
not the association make an arrangement
with the Cycle Board of Trade and share
rooms In some building, a central point
for all delegates.
Henry L. Day, George P. Caldwell, Her
bert \V. Welch and Secretary A. J. Menne
of tho Bay City Wheelmen will start to
day on a fortnight's camping trip In the
Russian River country. As each will
carry a rifle on his wheel, the big game
of that region are in imminent danger of
extermination unless they got scent of
the nlmrods ajid keep In hiding.
As far back a a the last century, ath
letic sports engaged to some, extent the
attention of college students, though it is
supposed by many that they are of com
parative recent growth. The Overland
Monthly for August has aji article on the
life of Thomas Trenor. treasurer of the
organization which led tho movement for
the national independence of Ireland in
17!<\ He was a graduate of Trinity Col
lege "Old Trinity" in Dublin, and was
amateur champion of Ireland at tho run
ning broad jump, having a record of
twenty-one feet, made at the Dublin gym
nasium. The distance is more than most
men can clear to-day. While not c [ual
to the present record, it gives ground for
the claim that the Improvement shown
now is solely owing to better methods
of training, which bring men to a higher
physical condition th;ui wns known 100
years ago.
Captain Harry 'Larkln, of the Bay City

NEWS FROM THE
COLLEGE GRIDIRONS.
The University of California opens its
fall semester this week, and with it the
preliminary football season begins, as far
as that university is concerned. Already
a weighting of material is Indulged in by
the college students and a balancing of
forces for the coming campaign of *he
gridiron is daily talk. The two college
coaches will soon appear on the scene,
and then the actual work will commence.
Stanford's crack team of last year will
have big gaps in It by the graduation of
some and the withdrawal from college of
other members of the team. The great
center trioâ Burnett. Fickert and Carle
will be nothing but a memory. Fickert
has played the allotted four years and
Carle may not return. Burnett will cer
tainly not be seen on a gridiron this year,
for he is with the army at Manila. New
tackles will have to be developed, but this
will not be a difficult undertaking, as the
material for this position is the very best.
Phil Wilson and Jerry Rusk are tho most
probable tackles. The candidates for ends
on the cardinal team will be Parker,
Smith and Berkley. Erb and Murphy will
return, and they will be the quarter can
didates. Fisher and Burmeister will also
return. This does not take into account
the new material which will come in with
the freshman class.
Cochran's task will be a difflclt one.
During the spring he put his mtn through
a great deal of the preliminary work on
the Berkeley campus, and he will get
them out just as soon as they have re
turned to college. Percy Hall will also
marshal his old men together in a few
weeks. California depends on the fresh
man class to furnish some big men but
whether the usual disappointment will be
their portion this year is a matter of
question. Manager Brown has been scour-
Ing the State for large men, but his tour
has not been very fruitful. Guiberson
will be trained for guard. Most of the
old players will bo back, and they will
train for positions this year.

WHAT IS GOING
ON AMONG
THE YACHTSMEN.
There seems to be some doubt In the
minds of yachting men as to the date of
the Pacific lnterclub Association's annual
regatta. On the programme of the asso
ciation the regatta is set down for Sep
tember 4, but the Pacifies have a cruise
to Quarry Cove and return on the 3d and
4th, and the Encinals have a ladies' cruise
to San Mateo and return, deferred from
June 4 and 5, put down for September 4
and B. The Cfilifornias have a cruise to
Martinez and return on their programme
for September 3, 4 and 5. The San Fran
clscos, CorinthiariÃ and South Bays are
the three clubs which have open dates on
the 4th. On the programme of the Encin
als, California^ and South Bays the date
assigned to the association regatta is
September 9, while the San Franciscos
A FAST YOUNG GREYHOUND.
POSSIBLY the proudest man at Ingleslde Coursing Park last Sunday was
the veteran leashman of the State, John Egan of 1129 Folsom street. Mr.
Egan has been a breeder of greyhounds for more than twenty years, and
many of the high class dogs he owned won laurels on the famous
plains of Merced. But on Sunday last, when the pup Billy Gladstone
walked away with first prize at Ingleside Park, Egan's joy knew no
bounds. He refused $1000 for the youngster after the dog won his first
course. Billy Gladstone comes from good old stock. His dam is the well'
known Sly Girl Jr.-Skyrocket, and it goes without saying that if nothing
befalls Billy his future is of great promise.
have a cruise from McNear's Landing to
Napa City for that day. The Pacifies and
Corinthians are open for special orders.
The South Bays propose to cruise up lo
San Francisco on the Bth and witness the
association regatta on the 9th. It Is thus
clearly desirable that the date of the re
gatta should be settled beyond doubt, and
the secretaries of the clubs should be
furnished with a printed notice whien can
bo displayed In the clubhouses. The 4th
su-rms the more suitable day, Inasmuch
as the three dayp.-the 9th, 10th and lllhâ
furnish the opportunity for an extended
Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill's sloop Cyg
nus has been on the ways at Menottl's
for the purpose of stopping a leak. She
will probably be out sailing to-morrow.
Vice Commodore G. T. S. White had a
party of friends on his sloop Will 0 tho
Wisp last Sunday, as also had Arthur D.
Naylor on his sloop Twilight. Both
yachts anchored in Paradise Cove. G.
Campbell, who is living on board the
Davidson brothers cutter Folly. sailed to
McNear*s Landing. Port Captain Dr. A.
W McKeniie's launch Alkerta, in charge
of Arthur Kanzee, took a large party to
Larkspur on Sunday. Frank Bartlett's
sloop Queen is at anchor In the Corte
Madera Creek. Menotti is progressing
with the work on Messrs. Buckley and
Kanzee's new boat. Her deck planks are
on. and it is expected that she will be
ready to sail in a month from now. C.
Chlttenden's yawl Phyllis has been up the
Sacramento River during the week. The
yawl Frolic, the cutter Folly and the
Bloop Catherine were cruising in tho up
per nay last Sunday.
the San Franciseos propose to get a
launch to be used in towing members'
yachts out Into the wind or back to their
moorings when the breezes fall light. The
launch will be especially serviceable a
little later In the season.
Commodore E. A. Wiltsea's schooner
Aggie flagship of the Pacific Yacht Club,
started for Santa Catalina on Wednesday.
The Corinthian clambake at Tiburon on
Sunday under the able supervision of
Port Captain John H. Keefe, was most
successful, and it Is very likely that It
will become an annual Institution. Most
of those who contributed to the gayety
or success of the event have already been
mentioned in The Call, but credit is also
due to J. Cathcart for his songs and to 11.
Cookson for his work in gathering the
succulent clams. To-day the Corinthians
cruise to Point Richmond, returning- to-
Commodore C. J. Lancaster of the Cali
fornias will probably make a trip to
Honolulu, leaving the fleet under the
command of Vice Commodore G. B. Ed

sailed to El Campo on Sunday, and on his
return encountered a stiff breeze. Sec
retary G. F. Gaither's sloop IT & I cruised
about outside Oakland Creek last Sunday.
On board the U & I were: C. 8 Flanders,
captain of Company I. Twentieth Kansas

CITY CHAMPIONS
TO ROW ON
THE COLUMBIA.
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Amateur Athletic Association is mani
festing a disposition to wash its hands
of the arrangements made for crews and
single scullers from San Francisco to
take part in the Astoria regatta, on the
ground that it received no jfneial com
munication from the Astoria committee.
It is true that the first communication
from Astoria was addressed to J. R. Bock
man of the Ariel Club, care of The Call,
but that was merely because his name
and club happened to be known to the
secretary of the Astoria committee. The
regatta committee here at once met, took
the letter under consideration, and gave
S. J. Pembroke full power to act in the
matter. The desire on the part of come
members of the regatta committee here
to evade official responsibility for the
representatives of San Francisco clubs
Is caused by the presence of R. McAr
thur in the South End "Midget" crew.
According to the rules of the Amateur
Athletic Union R. McArthur is tainted
with professionalism; he is also unreg
istered. Thus the Alameda senior barge
crew run the risk of being regarded as
professionals by entering a contest in
which McArthur takes part. It is con
tended by some mat McArthur is un
registered because he has not applied
for registration. The reply to this is that
he has not applied because it is certain
that his application would be refused. It
las also been suggested that the Astoria
rcjratta will be under the auspices of the
National Rowing Association, of which
the Alameda Boat Club is a member, and
that amateurs may row an exhibition
race, ii. which the prize is a trophy,
against professionals, without forfeiting
their amateur standing. At any rate, the
fat is in the tire now. and may produce
a conflagration. Some of the oarsmen
are already restive under the strict legis
lation of the Amateur Athletic Union,
a-ul an attempt to coerce them may drive
them out of it altogether.
The "Midgets" have been out every
night, and, at the time of their race at
Astoria, will have had nearly three
weeks' practice. Gus Carson and George
Kates weigh about 165 pounds each, R.
McArthur about 14S, and F. Duplissea
about 145. This puts two heavy men on
the bow side and the two light men on
the stroke side â an arrangement which
may do in a barge but would be impos
sible in a racing four. W. Thomas will
go as a coach and trainer, and George
McOrill as cockswain. The barge leaves
by steamer to-day; the crews will follow
later by train. Dr. C. C. Dennis Is prac
ticing dally, and will use a skiff belong
ing to the Alamedas. T. Barry may
go to Astoria on a visit, and President
J. D. Mahoney may also attend the re
gatta. As A. W. Pape of the Dolphins
is going to Astoria, he will have an op
portunity to try himself against Dr. Den
nis.
At a special meeting recently held by
the South Ends it was decided to give
an entertainment in Union-square Hall
on November 1 to raise funds to com
plete the handball court. W. C. Crook
a weight-thrower, and Victor Koster, an
oarsman, were initiated at the meeting.
To-morrow the Junior crews to take part
in the championship regatta will be or
ganized.
E. B. Hadcock (bow), A. C. Webb (No.
3) and E. V. Hansen (cockswain) of the
Alameda crew, with their barge, leave
to-day for Astoria; W. G. Hansen (No 2)
and F, W. Ayers (stroke) will go up by
train. George Miller may go as trainer,
and possibly S. J. Pembroke as coach
At a meeting of the Alameda Boat Club
on Tuesday A. C. Bruckmann and A
Oleander were elected members. Free
discussion of all matters of interest to
the club being encouraged, the meetings
are largely attended, and it has b*en de
termined to light the club house by elec
tricity, or to put in an acetylene gas
plant.
On Sunday two barge crews went out
from the Artel club-house the first being
made up of E. McDonough, bow; A Car
roll. No. 2; D. Sheehan, No. 3; 11. Pless
stroke, and Roy West, cockswain; and
the second crew of H. I. Caveney. bow;
H. Wilson, No. 2; J. OÂ«Connell, No. 3,
and F. Chappelle, stroke. F. Wilson E
Sternberg and J. F. Ficken went out in
skin's.
WILLIAM D. SMITH DROWNED 1
Accidental Death of a Well Known
Salmon Packer.
Information has been received in this
city that William D. Smith, manager of
the Alaska Packing Association's canner
ies on the Gulf of Georgia, Alaska, was
accidentally drowned recently at, Semiah
moo, Washington. The particulars have
not been learned. Mr. Smith was well
known in this line of business, being a
salmon canner and packer for many
years. His first interests were on the
Columbia River, but he moved to Alaska
and established and managed a cannery
at Chignik.
When the Alaska Packing Association
was formed in 1893 Mr. Smith sold the
cannery to the association, and since 1896
he has been the manager of the canneries
on the Gulf of Georgia. Deceased was
a native of Virginia and about 40 years
Of age. He leaves a widow.
ROD AND GUN
AFFORD
ROYAL SPORT.
Excellent reports of good trout fishing
still arrive from Boca and, and Bert La
Forge, the champion spoon caster of the
Sierras, predicts that fly lishing will be
very good on the Truckee River until the
siiiiw begins to fall.
Anglers who have returned from Eel
River are very profuse in their praises of
the sport that can now be enjoyed near
Grizzly Bluff. They contend that it is
not any trick for a good fly caster to fill
a basket with half-pound trout (steel
heads) in one hour.
L. J. Chase is at present camped at
Willets, in Mendocino County. He will
remain in the redwoods lor three weeks
and enjoy himself hunting and fishing.
C. B. Pomeroy and Presoott Ely return
ed last Tuesday from Monterey Bay. The
anglers state that salmon fishing is uuw
first class.
Dr. 11. W. Ilunsacker and wife are en
joying good shooting and fishing at
Skaggs Springs.
P. B. Pindley and J. B. Grimwood left
last Tuesday for Gilmore'3, where trout
fishing can always bo had uuring the sea
son.
A. S. Carman and friend are at present
whipping the Truckee River. Mr. Car
man is one of the champion fly casters of
the coast, and his friends can rest assur
ed of enjoying some of the fruits of his
"daily toil." Carman will miss his twill
brother, Aiansneid.
Billy McCrea left last Wednesday for a
month's vacation at Boca. It goes with
out saying that Billy will assist to de
crease the lish supply of the Truckue
River, especially as he will have an able
assistant in Bert JLa Forge.
F. Haight, the popular salesman of
Golcher, Clabrough & Co., received a very
interesting letter from Dr. F. L. Platt a
few days ago. The doctor A.ated that he
Is enjoying splendid sport on the Navarro
River trout tishinp and that his wife has
kept the camp supplied with venison and
small game.
J. R. D. Grubb and Horace Smith re
cently returned from Deer Park Inn,
Placer County. The gentlemen bagged
one line deer and report having seen large
flocks of. young grouse and mountain
quail. Angling in the Five Lakes is said
to be first class. The trout average well
In size.
The death of Cantain George Cum
ming has culled from the angling frater
nity of this city "the noblest Roman of
them all." Poor old "Cap" was a favor
ite with young and old, and his many
tales of adventure on land and water will
not soon be forgotten by the lovers of
shooting and fishing. The captain was
truly a grand old man, and" what pleas
ure he enjoyed In relating on the banks
of some favorite salmon or trout stream
the incidents connected with his many
time trips around the Hornâ i. c., when
he was captain of the good ship Three
Brothers. He died a painless death, but
before departing- from this life he
wrapped himself up in the American col
ors, having had a presentiment that his
line was run out and death was near.
Charley Precht, whose wrist was bro
ken a few days ago by a fall from a high
bank near Glen Ellen, is rapidly recover
ing the use of his arm. His physician re
ports that he had never experienced a
case where broken bones had knit so rap- .
idly. Precht says that if he can have
good use of the injured member when the
quail season opens he will feel as happy
as a big sunflower.
There are many sportsmen in this State
who contemplate a hunting trip into Ore
gon and Washington when the game sea
son opens, but as there is some misunder
standing regarding the open seasons the
following table will set pheasant shooters
right. Game Warden MeGuire of Port
land, Or., has kindly furnished the sport
ing editor of The Call with the correct
dates of the game seasons: In Oregon
the open season for game and fish begins
as follows:
Upland birds from September 1 to ue
cember 1.
Market on upland birds, October lo to
November 15.
Elk, moose, deer and mountain siiecp,
August 1 to December 1.
Trout, April l to November I.
Duck, geese and swan, September 1 to
March 15.
In Washington the open season begiua
as follows:
Upland birds, August 15 to December a.
Mongolian pheasants are protected until
the 15th day of October, 1900.

The Lincoln Gun Club is making great
preparations for its final shoot of the sea
son on August 21. The cash prizes will
amount to $150, divided into live parts.
A large entry is expected for the grand
open-to-all shoot.
Local anglers who are desirous of catch
ing Mack bass of first quality should visit
the Salt Spring Valley reservoir, distant
about thirty miles from Stockton. Dr. A.
Wallace of this city and a friend caught
one hundred bass recently, the average
weight being one and a half pounds. Of
the many devices they tried they had
their best luck with flies, the best killers
being the Lake Queen and Royal Coach
man. Three years ago the reservoir was
stocked with 5000 bass, which fishes when
fry were taken from Russian River by the
State Fish Commissioners. There are
two boats on the pond, which Is not pre-
Berved. Any angler who can make the
trip can count upon royal sport.

THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 13, 1898.
TO UNWATER
THE COMSTOCK
The Great Project Is
Really Begun.
STARTING POINTS ORDERED
FIRST MEETING OF COMPANY
DIRECTORS.
Bepresentatives of Twenty - Four
Companies Organize and Will
Hear From Superintend
ents Old and New.
The Comstook mining companies yester
day took their first definite and united
action regarding the great project of un
watering tho Comstock mines and re
suming operations below the Comstock
tunnel level.
Twenty-four companies were represent
ed at a meeting held In thn afternoon in
the office of the Consolidated California
and Virginia Company in the Nevada
block. These representatives had been
elected at various meeting of the re
spective boards of directors. The joint
committee organized by electing Charles
EL Fish president and A. Waterman sec
rotary, and by creating an executive
committee consisting of William Barman,
E. P. Barrett, George R. Wells, John
Landers and Charles Hirschfeld.
The committee did the wise and nat
ural thing by taking steps to compile all
the reliable information obtainable con
cerning the actual condition of the
flooded levels of all the mines and the
possibilities of their profitable operation.
To this end the superintendents of all
the mines were ordered to report to the
commuter by September 14 the condition
of the mint's below the Sutro tunnel level
when those levels were abandoned nix
teen years ago. The secretaries of the
different companies were directed to com
pllo all the similar information in the
past reports of superintendents now on
file This getting together all that Is
really known about the flooded depths
will form a starling point and clear the
\v;iy for further action. The action of
the committee was expressed in the fol
lowing resolution adopted unanimously on
motion of Mr. Hirschfeld:
Resolved, Thut the superintendents of the
mines <>f the following named companies, to

below the Sutro tunnel level of said mines,
and also whether any bodies of ore or indica
tions of bodies of ore exist below said level,
and also as to the advisability of pumping out
the water from said mines and the resumption
of mining below said level: and It is further
Resolved, That the secretaries of Bald com
panies be requested forthwith to make copies
of so much of the reports of the superintend
ents of said companies since the year 18S2 as
refer to the workings of said mines below said
level, and deliver the same to said superin
tendents as soon as possible, so that said su
perintendents may know from the official re
ports the condition of said mines below said
; level.

Mr. Deal, of Deal, Tauszky & Wells,
attorney for some of the companion, was
present. Messrs. Kaufman and Barrett
represented the San Francisco Stock
Exchange, and J. Hlrschberg the Pacific
Stock Exchange.
This immense project, upon which all
hopes of tho restoration of the greatness
and glory of the world's most famous
mining camp now chiefly rest, was thus
yesterday advanced beyond the stage
of mere talk. Tho problem has been def
initely attacked, and there is plenty of
ground for the faith that the scheme
will not end in reports and resolutions,
but that the riches abandoned a half mile
below the surface when the stock gam
blers demanded immediate dividends will
again bo uncovered and set old Virginia
City to humming once more.

EXTENSION OF CAB LINES.
San Bruno to Have a Much-Needed
Electric Line.
Chief Constructor H. H. Lynch, of the
Market-street Railway system, is pushing
the work on Eighth street with all possi
ble speed. The relaying of the track on
this thoroughfare preparatory to fitting
it out for an electric line instead of the
old horse car service will extend from
Market to Bryant street, where it will
connect with the cars of that line to
Sixteenth street and those of the Eigh
teenth street (formerly Solano) to Ken
tucky, the Potrero and South San Fran
cisco.
The railroad company will pave its por
tion of Eighth street from Market to
Folsom with bitumen, thus making trie
street conform to the pavement now lam
by the city. From Folsom to Bryant
basalt blocks will be laid between the
company's trucks.
As soon as the Eighth-street line is fin
ished Constructor Lynch will start his
men on the extension of the Folsom-street
line from its present t-rminus at I recita
avenue, and along that avenue to Army
street until San Bruno avenue is met,
when the line will be extended along that
thoroughfare as far as the Five Mile
House, or where the present horse car
line now stops.
The next extension in contemplation by
the Market-street system is that of utiliz
ing the Sixth-street franchise. To this
end the company proposes to run an elec
tric line along Sixth street, crossing Mar
ket and running north a* far as Post,
whore it will turn east until Montgomery
is met, when it will turn into that street
and follow the route now. traversed by
the bobtail ghost. Another line in con
templation by the company is a sidetra-k
from Mission ptreoi opposite St. Marys
College running north to the proposed site
ci' U\o new "monkey ranch" in Whirlwind
Gulch. Application tor a franchise for
this branch is now before the Board nf
Supervisors, as is also one for a short
line from the Killmore street terminus at
i - north end to the Presidio along Jeffer
son street.
A New Policeman.
Arthur T. McQualde, a clerk, Â£3 years of
age and a native of title city, was yester
day sworn Jn as a police officer.
Lost His Life Saving Others.
A country boy visiting New Tork stopped a

women anil children. He saved their Jives, but
lost his own. Hundreds of lives are saved every
year by Hostetter's Stomach Hitters. People

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NXW YORK, Aug. 12.â There was some con
tinuation to-day of yesterday's selling- to real
ize on the recent sustained advance In stocks.
The bears were much more aggressive and sold
stocks with growing confidence as the day pro
grossed. The advantage at the close was
clearly with the bear contingent, but the bulls
' were by no means routed and continued to ab
sorb their favorite stocks, which resisted the
decline quite firmly, but without overcoming
the general downward tendency. The effects
of last night's flurry in call money were still
perceptible this morning when call loans were
made at 2 per cent. There is nothing which
brings so quick a response in a speculative
market as a stiffening of call money and the
buying of stocks halted this morning. It was
expected that the cash absorbed by the Treas
ury on account of the Government would in
the future be left on deposit with national
banks, but Government deposits with these
banks for some reason have not kept pace
â¢with the Treasury's absorption on bond ac
count. The money rate eased off during the
day and closed at Hi bid. The bears by that
time were forced to secure other material for
their campaign. The persistent weakness of
Manhattan all day on reports of decreased earn
ings was a factor in their favor. Prices of
stocks hardened very perceptibly during the
middle portion of the day after the fears of
tight money had somewhat subsided. The bulls
took hold of the low priced railroad stocks
and bid up Northern Pacific and Union Pacific
over a point. The bears' final raid In the last
hour was centered on Louisville and Nashville
in connection with the statement of earnings
. for the first week in August, showing a de
crease of over $IS.COO. There was a "private"
â¢ telegram from Chicago In circulation report
ing yellow fever in Texas and Alabama.
Louisville and Nashville dropped 2 points be
â¢ low the highest point. The bears expressed
their apprehension that the Anglo-Rus'.an
crisis would result in forced liquidation in
New York for London account, although Lon
don was a buyer of stocks here early In the
â¢ day. The market reacted all around, some
stocks falling to the lowest, but others show
ing quite a firm tone. There was only a very
feeble rally, however, and the close was near
the low point of the reaction. Net changes
were very irregular, quite a number of the low
priced stocks showing shcrp gains.
There was a marked falling off In the busi
ness In bonds under a yielding tendency of
prices. The Oregon Navigation 4 per cents were
the second in the list of the reorganization
.-4s to touch par, following closely the Northern
Pacific prior liens. Total Bales. $3,730,000.
United States new 4s, registered, and the
old 4s, coupon, declined >4 In the bid price.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 409 410
shares. Including: 8585 Atchison preferred, 1G -

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aupr. 12â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: To-day the
market was quiet and the tone was weaker.
Anglo-Rus^lan-Chinese affairs, though not
taken soriously in the city, are having a de
pressing effect In discouraging confidence of
the public. The feature is the sharp break in
Grand Trunk on the disannolntins half yearly
statement. Prices closed quiet at the lowest
with a heavy fall. Many weak bulls were
shaken out, however, and an ultimate recovery
Is looked for.
Americans were dull on profit taking, closing
above the lowest. Spanish fours were flat,
and were sold from Paris.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Aug. 12.â Bradstreet's finan
cial review to-morrow will say: Successful
progress In the peace negotiations with Spain,
and reassuring news an to the crops, produced
a further buying movement In the railroad
share list. The activity was on a decidedly
larger scale and the outside public was more of
a factor than for some time pant. London was
a seller here on the advance in the early part
of the week, but the later developments In
cluded not only an Increase of transactions In
Americans, but an increasing Interest in them
by the London public. The speculation ,here
presented many indications that large profes
sional interests had resumed operations on the
bull side, and signs were not lacking in the
closing days of the week that such people were
realizing speculative profits. A slight tempo
rary hardening of call loan rates can not be
said to have had much effect in sentiment in
the street, nor is attention paid to the steadi
ness of exchange and thÂ» postponement of gold
importations for the present at least. The
principal factors were the growing certainty
that the Spaniard would submit to the terms
of peace laid down by our Administration, and
the even more important . Indications that the
spring wheat crop was not damaged and that
there had been much exaggeration In reports
of trie reduction of the corn yield. The repent
rains at the West had done much to dissipate the
unfavorable notions on these matters and the
work was completed by the exceptionally fa
vorable character of the Government crop re
port published on Wednesday, last. The belief
that railroad traffic and earnings of the West
will be on a par with those cf the past year
has. made the granger stocks the feature of
the market. Â«.""'Â«Â».Â«
Government bonds were strong, though trie
old Issues rec-ded fractionally on realizing, but
the new 3 pÂ«r cent bonds, after a slight JÂ«ac
tlon recovered to 105%. The railroad bond Ist
has "been strong and active, new records having
been made in many issues and especially in
terest has been taken in 4 per cents.

DUN'S REVIEW OP TRADE.
NKW YORK, Aug. U.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say . to-morrow:
Prospects of peace have had a curious Influence
on business contracts, not quite explainable on
common sense grounds. Nobody really feared
disaster or exhaustion -of '. national resources,
and nobody feared that anybody else was afraid
of either. Yet orders unusual In number and
'â Ire have j been placed since Spain, asked for
peace. In some Industries the gains have been
larse for about two. weeks, while In some. tex- I
j tile manufactured It has â  only ; begun to appear I

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATUKDAY, AUGUST 13, 1898.
ment's latest report as to corn Is much larger
than the commercial estimates, and Its cotton
return promises a heavy yield, while allowance
Is made for Its habitual error In its wheat re
turn. Money markets show no signs of possi
ble disturbance, securities are stronger, <- and
there is no harmful speculation in stocks or
products. Rarely has the financial outlook been
more nearly unclouded.
While wheat Is 4 cents higher. for the week
there Is less doubt than a week ago that It will
rule lower during the coming year. The gen
eral holding back of grain by farmers and con
sequent heavy shrinkage In Western receipts
have reduced the visible supply below all past
records, but everybody understands that at this
date many times that quantity Is almost within
a day's run of Chicago. The more effective
change Is the decrease in exports, which have
only been 3,237.819 bushels, flour included, from
both coasts, against 3,832,974 last year, showing
but a slight Increase of half a million bushels
for two weeks, compared with last year. The
price of corn has declined a shade for cash.
The. Iron and steel trade fully supports Infer
ences drawn from recent events. The demand
for steel Is so heavy that some of the biggest
concerns have been buying, one taking 40,000
tons, advancing the price at Plttsbure from
$14 50 to $15 25, which was at last refused. Bes
semer pig is steady and other pig there and at
Eastern and Western markets generally steady,
but rails have been advanced by Eastern mak
ers to $1S per ton. The makers of structural
beams have advanced the price $1 per ton, and
makers of merchant pipe have advanced the
price 5 per cent, while plate makers are crowd
ed to the point of refusing orders, both East
and West, and bare are stronger, with many
mills engaged for weeks ahead.' Illustrating
the demand are reports of orders for 30,000 car
axles at Chicago, 20,000 tons structural work
there and big orders at Philadelphia for cast
pipe and 6COO tons elsewhere.
Eastern works now appear to be crowded to
their utmost capacity, as the Western have
been for some .weeks. In the minor metals
there Is heavy baying. Textile works have been
Bleeping, but are awakening. The demand for
woolen goods Is now much better, although not
yet extensive enough to warrant paying the
prices asked for new wool, and nearly all of
the buying has been of Old stock. The aggre
gate sales at the three chief markets have been
only 5,432,700 pounds for the week, about a
third of the sales in the same week of 159..
while In 1592. for the corresponding week. Bales
were 7,164, 60<) pounds. â  ,
For the week failures have been 196 In i .the
United States, against 239 last year, and 18 in
Canada, against 3S last year.
: BRADSTREETS REVIEW.
NEW TORK, Aug. 12.â Bradotreefs will say
to-morrow: Changes in general trade and
business this week have been very era Â»y
toward improvement. Notable in this respect
has been the Iron and steel trade, which has
passed from the stage of promise to that of
fulfillment on Increased demand and marked
advances in values. From all the leading Iron
centers East and West come reports of more
or less Improvement In lone, demand or prices,
especially prominent in the latter, particular
ly being Fte-l billets at an advance of *1 per
ton: steel rails have had advances ranging
from JSc to $1, and sympathetic advances are
likewise noted i" Eastern plijiron. wrought-
Iron pipe steel beams and other structural
material and steel plates. Further encourag
ing features have been the accentuated demand
on foreign account for wheat and corn, which
Is reflected In advances for those cereals in
bi.He of a rather more favorable than expected
Government report of possible yield. Popu
lar estimates tend to allow of an underesti
mate by the Government in wheat fully equal
to that "of last year and point to a total crop of
not less than 700.000,000 bushels. Effects of the
holding of wheat by farmers for better prices
are found in the reduced volume of grain car
ried by railroads during July. Price strength
is also a feature. Oats, lard, beef, coffee, lead,
rubber, copper and cotton are advanced on the
week. Cotton price* are higher and contrast
with the Government report of an unchanged
condition as a result of July weather, but th!s
is partly due to complaints of too much rain
since August 1, the date of the Government
report. â â â -â â â â â â ' '-â '._, -~ :

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, 1 Aug. 12.â Renewed Indications of
smaller receipts at "Western primary markets
together with better prices at Liverpool gave
wheat a good start. The strained relations
between Russia and England growing out of the
friction over China were also a factor. Reports
showed considerable alarm and the disposition
was to cover. As there was little for sale
a\id the competition sharp, price* gradually
fmproveV %c. The demand for shipping lots
of wheat was better than It was yesterday,
and a corresponding improvement was experi
enced in the market for carloads. The extra
ordinary condition of the cash trade was the
moat influential feature of the situation and
kept the price of September edging upward af
ter every slight reaction. The aggregate re
ceipts for the day at Western primary markets
were 436 000 bushels against 740,000 bushels last
year. September %@lc higher and ; December

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
The glut In Peaches, Pears and Plums con
tinues, but dealers do not expect It to last
more than several days longer. As soon as the
I canners get rid of their contract fruit they will
i af,aln buy In this market, when a general im
| provement In prices Is looked for, as the cropa
are Just as light as they have been. A curious
and unprecedented feature of the congestion
Is the shipment of Peaches and Pears back to
the grower* by the commission merchants, in
order that they may be dried Instead of being
sacrificed here. In former years the growers
were not prepared to dry at a moment's notice,
but they are now, and It is a good thing for
i them. Of course they lose the freight both
ways. Quite a number of lots have been thus
â hipped back.
Grapes are beginning to pile up somewhat,
and the tendency In prices Is downward. Other
wise there Is nothing new.

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
Butter is dearer again. Cheese and Eggs are
undisturbed.
Meals sell at last week's prices. Turkeys
are dearer, beine scarce, but otherwise the
Poultry market stands about the same.
It is now the full of the fruit season and aJI
fruits except Grapes are about as plentiful as
they will get this year. The markets are
choked at the moment, as the canners are not
buying, but this will probably not last much
over this week. Vegetables are plentiful as
usual.

.'The plea of insanity in murder cases
]['. ;ti Alameda County received a severe
F.etbacfc'.tliis afternoon, when Joseph H.
â Moffe.;C who shot his wife some months
â¢ ago-, "was' sentenced to twenty-four years
In- Sari'Quentin by Judge Hall. As Mof

:7-if-3#otfeJtt was convicted of murder in the
'-. "-second degree last week after a very hard
fight had, been made to support a plea of
.â ' Insanity.- The case was handled by At
" -torney .-Prick on behalf of Moffett, and
ex- Mayor Chapman was a very impor
tant' witness, as he had known Moffett
-.tor some years, and he believed that for
' iome .-time before the murder Moffett was
insane. â¢
â In passing sentence Judge Hall said he
had no sympathy . with the plea of in
' â  Banuv upon which the defense was based.
'- â¢ He Intimated that the jury would have
â¢' been Justified in bringing in a more se
: vere .verdict, and MUd that the jurors
â were lenient with the prisoner.
. . The" lightest sentence in such cases is
â¢ ' ten â¢ years' imprisonment, and the limit
'". Incarceration for life. In commenting on
â¢â  â¢ tire case,-, the court said that it consid
â¢"â¢ ererl. : Moffett deserving of a sentence of

SUTRO'S WILL
CRITICIZED
L Trust Clause Said to Be
â â "â¢': . \ Illegal.
HALF THE HEIRS ARE DEAD
CITY HAS A VALID CLAIM ON
THE LIBRARY.
Belief Is General That the Dead
Millionaire Left a Later Tes
tament Than That of
1882.
The ;flnal disposition of the estate of
the late Adolph Sutro will be awaited
with intense interest by the public as
' "well as by the heirs. That this docu
ment of May 22, 1882, is his last will is a j
matter of doubt, but a later document
has not yet been found. Mr. Sutro re
peatedly announced, publicly and in priv
:. ate,- that he Intended to give his mag
nificent library and the Heights, to the
city, and when the board of regents ac- ]
cepted the site for the Affiliated Colleges j
. it was- stipulated in writing that. Sutro
should erect a building on the adjacent
4nd and establish the library there. In
the opinion' of many eminent attorneys
this agreement 1b a valid claim on the
â  â¢ estate, of the dead millionaire.
â¢ Many persona who were more or less
Intimate .with Mr. Sutro express a belief
.: that he : made a will in recent years, or
\t not -a' will that somewhere among his
Ââ¢'.- papers- jvllj- be found elaborate memor
â¢-'linda-itilfectinK. the disposition of his es
'. tfue.. â  . â 
â¢' â¢ ' Unless a new will is found the docu
. .ment -dited May 22, 1882, will, of course,
be offered- for probate. But it will not
". sta-nd. -â â¢ In the first place, the trust
clause, viii/jvr the Supreme Court decision
In the Walkerley case, is invalid. In the
second-; . executing the will the
-. decedent's relations with the beneficiar
' ,-le's. named underwent great changes and
.- -new ties,- which created claims on the
â ' estate were formed, if Mrs. Kluge's story
. 'is true- Attorneys for the heirs have
' .-already announced that the will will be
: ' 'con-tested and that a distribution, under
'-â  -the statutes, is sure to follow.
â  ' Another Interesting phase of the mat
; . ter Ib. that over half the persons named
. In the will which was read the other day
are dead.
Mrs. Kluge, who says she is the widow
of Mr: SMtrw, Is out of the city, and
. ' whether or not she has anything tangible
' w"ith which to establish the validity of
' her claim is known only to herself and I
her- attorney, Van R. Paterson. Judge
Paterson left the city yesterday after
noon to consult with his client. Mrs.
' Kluge has stated on one or two occa
'â¢"â¢ slons that she knew she and her two
' children " would be provided for in Mr.
â Sutro'.s will. Her attorney says she will
â fiave no difficulty in proving thai Sutro
- was tho father of the children, and that
: he had frequently acknowledged his re
i latlonshlp to them. '
'"* Whether a new will is found or not,
. -Mrs. Kluge- win make a demand for a
share In the estate and will carry the
fight to the courts if her claims are not
recognized and satisJled.
' â¢ -Josr-ph Moore, who was Mr. Sutro h le
gal' adviser for years and also a witness
â¢ to Uie will of 1882, says he does not know
of the existence of a later one. although
â¢ -Sutro may have ma4e a new one. Elliott
tract and an effort is being made to have
several companies from Camp Barrett
prasent to make the affair a memorable
one in the history of Klmhurst. There is
a movement on foot among Elmhurst res
idents to establish a boot and shoe fac
tory in their midst and a canvass is now
being made among the wealthier people.

Moore, Joseph's brother, was the only
man who ever had Sutro's implicit conn- |
dence. He was Mr. Butro's lawyer during
the long fight over the tunnel under the
ComFtock lode, and they became warm
I friends. Some years ago Elliott Moore
broke down mentally and his brother took
! charge of Mr. Sutro's legal business. Jo
i seph Moore says the dead millionaire
, often declared his intention to make a
will, but he never informed his attorney
that he had carried. out his intention*.
Mr. Moore expressed an opinion that the
will which has been made public would
be set aside, as It clearly came under the
decision â  by the Supreme Court which de
clare against trust devises.
Two gentlemen who formerly acted as
private secretaries for Mr. Sutro and who
were necessarily familiar with his busi
ness affairs are of the opinion that, he
made a will within the last five years and
that it will be found in a few days, when
the dead man's papers are . looked over.
These gentlemen further state that Mr.
Sutro was not at all liable to take any
I one into his confidence. He was a bit sen-
I sitive on the subject of wills, and, al
' though he occasionally mentioned the
topic it was usually in reference to some
one else.
Since 1882 the value of the estate has
more than doubled. Mr. Sutro spent large
sums of money in improving his property
and after writing the will he also secured
the thousands of priceless volumes which
constitute one of the greatest libraries in
America. â 
When examination of title to the cele
brated Sutro library comes to be closely
examined it will be found resting in the
hands of the Regents of the University of
California. That seems to be the opinion
of the board and it is a known fact that
Governor Budd does not entertain any
other view of the case. Speaking of the
subject yesterday the Governor remarked
that the buildings of the Affiliated Col
leges were erected on the Sutro tract on
j the condition that the land and library
I should be given to the- university.- In the
deed the library is not mentioned, but the
proposition made by Mr. Sutro to convey
the library was given In writing and was
never recalled. All through the long ne
gotiations preliminary to the selection of
a permanent site the value of the Sutro
library was discussed by the regents. Mr.
\ Sutro s Intention to transfer the library
to the university was expressed orally
and in w 'ting and so often expressed that
the reg* s had no doubt of the donor'
intentions. .' v -

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 13, 1898.
CONFIDENT OF
ITS SUCCESS
Lake Merritt Measure
Comes Up Monday.
MANY VOTES IN ITS FAVOR
COUNCIL URGED TO PROVIDE
IMMEDIATE RELIEF.
Rev. Father McNally Believes That
an Issue of Bonds Would Be
a Proper Pro
ceeding.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway , Aug. 12.
Next Monday night the City Council
will deal with the most important meas
ure it has taken up during its term of
office. The ordinance providing for the
Improvement of Lake Merritt, Cemetery
Creek and the adjacent sewers will be up
for passage. The wealthiest and most
influential citizens of Oakland have allied
themselves together for the (rxpr^essod
purpose of bringing about this improve
ment. The Lake Merritt Sanitary Im
provement Club is now doing everything
possible to secure the passage of the or
dinance.
At a conference with the Ordinance and
Judiciary Committee of the City Council
there appeared before it Captain Edwin
Goodall, Rev. Father McNally, A. Schil
ling, Hugh Craig, Captain Mem, Thomas
Crellin, James k>. Moffltt, Colonel Ed
wards, Ira Bishop. Edson Adams, Charles
Yale and several others. They endeavored
to impress upon the Council the necessity
from a sanitary point of view of carry
ing out the improvements outlined In the
ordinance.
Auditor Snow declares that the lake is
a nuisance and a menace, and the condi
tion of the treasury and financial facts
should not be taken as an argument
against the work. To carry out the im
provement this rear would require a levy
of $1 37. To make it in two years would
require $1 27. At present the rate is
$1 12.
Rev. J. B. McNally is heartily in favor
of the improvement, and thought it should
be made at once, for by dredging the lake
now it was simply doing a part of the
work which must be done in the future.
If a place were wanted to dump the
refuse from the lake he said there were
still some marahes In West Oakland that
should be filled in. He wanted the city
to issue bonds for a systematic sewer sys
tem, and from what he saw and knew
Lake Merrit must be dredged right away.
Ira Bishop, who is superintendent of the
street car lines owned by the
Rc-alty Syndicate, declares that his com
pany paid a large amount of taxes and
that it has not applied for a reduction of
$50,000, which was granted last year, sim
ply because they wish to show public
sij'irit and a willingness to contribute a
share to public improvements.
There i 6 some doubt regarding the man
ner of obtaining the money to make the
improvements, but all agree that if the
ordinance be passed the money will be
forthcoming. Chairman Brosnahan of
the Council committee has promised that
If tNi'r>- be a full Council next Monday
night he WiH <-"-U the matter up and have

sands of the sea for number. The Hen
leys didn't like it. They endured it for a
time and then complained to the Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Cats. The
secretary of this benign organization sent
word to Foote. "Say," he faid, "did you
know that you left a thousand cats out
there and that they are starving so nois
ily as to rob the world of rest? Go out
and harvest a few or I will be forced to
clap you in a jail. or something."
Foote was angry. In hia business of not
bringing Wells-Fargu to terms he was so
engrossed that he hated to be disturbed.
"I'll go out this evening and settle
them," he said. He went out He had
expected to see three or four cats added
to the small colony he had deserted. But
the place was full of them. There they
were in countless arrayâ black, gray,

IS TIRED OF
HIS OFFICE
Coroner Baldwin Makes
a Plain Statement.
INQUESTS ARE SUPPRESSED
PRIVATE PARLORS ARE NOT
DESIRABLE MORGUES.
Oakland Should Have a Public In
stitution Similar to That
Provided in San Fran
cisco.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 12.
Coroner Baldwin has announced that he
is so disgusted with his office that under
no consideration would he acoept another
term. Dr. Baldwin went into the office
with the belief that the last Legislature
would so fix matters that a proper public
Morgue would be established in this
county. Such a move was not taken, and
under the existing law the county can
build a morgue but cannot appropriate
one cent for its maintenance.
Dr. Baldwin is the first medical man
who has held the office in this county, and
after nearly four years of experience he
says he is convinced that the Coroner
should be a medical man and thaW.the
office should be conducted on the same
principles as the San Francisco Morgue.
"1 am convinced," said Coroner Baldwin
to-day, "that sLnce I have taken office
many cases that should have been the
subject of an Inquest have been sup
pressed. One case occurred not long
ago where a man was run over and died
at the county, infirmary. Not until after
he was buried did the case come to my
notice, and then I had to have the body
disinterred. If ever there were a dry
needing a proyerly equipped morgue, it
is Oakland. With so many train acci
dents, it is not right to have to drag
along the way we do. The various un
dertakers who have made morgues of
their private parlors have done very well,
considering that there is no morgue. At
the same time thero has been In some
instances much unseemly competition be
tween undertakers in this connection, and
I have no doubt that some cases have
been kept from becoming public in this
county by undertakers because they
feared that taking the body to the
morgue might lose them some custom.
From a commercial point of view, they
cannot be blamed, but it is a disgraceful
conditions of affairs in a city the size of
Oakland.
"After I took office I consulted with
Deputy District Attorney Lin Church, as
to the proper steps to be taken to es
tablish a morgue. Mr. Church looked
up the law and found that it is legal
for the Supervisors to establish a morgue,
but there is no way in which they can
provide for maintaining the nee
wagons or deputies, because such action
on their part would be practically an in
crease or the salary of a county officer.
Should thf-rr- be a consolidation of the
city and county the matter would then
come under the same law as that gov
erning San Francisco, and a proper
morgue could be maintained. Very nat
urally much business goes to the under
taker who supplies the morgue for tnV
time being, and this of course creates
much competition, for no other under
taker likes to send his cases to a rival
undertaker, even though the latter Is the
Coroner's headquarters, and this is not
a dignified situation for a large city to be
placed in."

CAR FARES MUST REMAIN.
City and County Attorney Creswell be

A stenographer for a large law firm in Boston had a rather
common experience : "My work," 6he said, "is very nervous and ex-
acting, and^ I used to leave the office utterly exhausted. At night I
would often have the most horrible dreams, and sometimes wake up in
a cold sweat. Once I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed clutch-
ing the bed clothes frantically with both hands. I became so dis-
heartened that I finally told my employer I must give up my position,
but he laughed, and said he wanted me to stay, and then suggested
that I try his remedy for such troubles. He gave me half a dozen
Ripans Tabules and told me to take one after dinner and another
before going to bed. I did so, and rested better that very night
Now, whenever I feel nervous, I take just one Tabule before retiring
and I sleep right through till morning, and get up thoroughly rested
and ready for business. For a sleep-producer and a auieter of tbt
fterves, these Tabules are simply wonderful*

THE END OF
CAMP MERRITT
NOT FAR OFF
On Monday the Trans
port Arizona Sails.
SCANDIA GOES ON THURSDAY
ARMISTICE NOT TO STOP PHIL
IPPINE OPERATIONS.
Three More Large Transports Will
About Make a Clean-TJp of
the Troops Assigned to
Major General Merritt.
It is not believed in local military
circles that the signing of the peace
protocol ajid the declaration of an ar
mistice will interfere with the forward
â  ing of the balance of the Philippine ex
peditionary forces, which no doubt will
be needed to protect life and property
at Manila during the interim, and until
the Philippine question is definitely
settled by the peace commission. Tele
graphic orders were received four days
ago to rush all the troops to Manila as
fast as possible. It is evident that this
was done with the full knowledge that
peace was to be at once declared, but
nevertheless the necessity of a large
force of troops at Manila was n
nized. Orders of revocation are, there
fore, not expected by Major General
Merriam.
The troops that are to sail for Manila
on the transport Arizona will embark
to-morrow afternoon, an order having
been issued at General Miller's head
quarters at Camp Merritt to that effect
yesterday afternoon, in accordance with
Instructions received from Major Gene
ral Merriam. This order designates
the remaining battalion of the Eight
eenth United States Infantry, th
mainin^ battalion of the Twenty-third
United States Infantry, and recruit de
tachments of the First Colorado, the
Tenth Pennsylvania, and 120 recruits of
the Second Oregon, all of whom are or
dered to be on board the Arizona not
later than 3 o'clock to-morrow i'fter
noon.
The Eighteenth Infantry Battalion
includes seven officers and 365 men,
with five lieutenants attached; the
Twenty-third Infantry Battalion in
cludes three officers and 409 men, with
six lieutenants attached- Tenth Penn
j,- .
First Colorado, two officers and 124
men; Oregon, 120 men. There are also
nine civilians and eighteen members of
the Hospital Corps, making a total of
1328.
The Eighteenth Infantry Battalion,
to which the Oregon recruits are at
tached, is commanded by Major Paul.
The Twenty-third Infantry Battalion,
with the Colorado recruits, will be un
der command of Major Goodale; and
the Pennsylvania recruits will be com
manded by Lieutenant Colonel Bar
nett.
Brigadier General King and staff and
a number of commissaries, quartermas
ters and surgeons will also sail on the
Arizona.
With the departure of these troops
there will be left at Camp Merritt the
Seventh California. 191 recruits of the
Second Oregon and a few others, all of
whom will tail on the Soandia on or
about next Thursday. The remaining
Oregon recruits are attached to the
rh California. The sailing of the
Scandia will wind up Oarnp Merritt.
The Arizona will pull out into the
stream at 9 o'clock to-morrow evening,
as owing to her great depth she Is
obliged to take advantage of the high
tide r>t that hour. The mail will go on
board at 9 o'clock Monday morning and
the steamer will sail before noon.
Three more large transports, such as
the Australia. City of Sydney and the
City of Peking, which are expected in
the next few days, will carry to Manila
nearly all of the remaining expedition
ary forces.
Adjutant General Corbin yesterday
afternoon telegraphed Major General
Merriam as follows: -'Protocol has
been signed. Hostilities are at an end."
As no orders were received regarding
the Philippine forces, General Merriam
will proceed to forward the troops in
accordance with recent instructions.
EVENTS AT THE PRESIDIO.
A Portion, of the Utah Caval
Will Leave for Yosemite
Park. This Morning.
Two-thirds of Troop A, Utah Cavalry,
under Captain Calne and Lieutenant Kim
ball, will leave the Presidio at 10 o'clock
this morning for Yosemite Park. This"
detachment will be accompanied by First
Lieutenant James E. Nolan, Fourth
United States Cavalry. Lieutenant Smith
will remain at the Presidio with the rest
of the troop until he has be^n furnished
the necessary mules, when he will go to
Sequoia Park.
The command of the Second Brigade, !
In the absence of General Krug. who will j
sail on the Arizona, has devolved upon '
Colonel Loper, Fifty-first lowa, he being
the senior colonel In the brigade.
Acting in compliance with instructions
from the War Department, regarding the
sending of troops to Alaska for the pur
pose of preserving peace upon the banks
of the Yukon, General Merriam has se
lected Battery A. Third United States Ar
tillery, for that duty. The order relieving
the battery from further duty at the Pre-
Bidio was issued yesterday, and it is ex
pected that it will nail for St. Michael
inside of ten days on some steamer jet
to b>: secured. The battery will be under
the command of Second Lieutenant
George H. McManus, formerly of Battery
B.
Private Percy B. Whittaker. Company
B, First Tennessee, died at the division
hospital yesterday morning of meningitis.
His funeral lakes place at 10:30 this morn
ing. There were 274 cases in the hospital

t.ifn Babbitt is accompanied by his wife.
and they are the guests of Major and
Mrs. Mosely. Next week Captain Bab
bitt will make a firing test of the large
â¢ guns at the Point, and also of the dyna
mite guns.
DRILL BY TENNESSEEANS.
A Fine Military Entertainment
to Be Given This Evening in

Company drill by Company H. Third
Battalion, Major John G. McGuire com
manding; officer commanding company.
Captain Gaston O'Brien.
Guard mount by details from Second
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT, WHO DIED AT SANTIAGO.
The dispatch published In yesterday's Call from General Bhafter at San
tiago, announcing the death of First Lieutenant William G. Elliott, Twelfth
United States Infantry, caused the deepest and most genuine expressions of
sorrow at the Presidio. Lieutenant Elliot was well known here. He was ap
pointed ;i cadet to the military academy from Washington., D. C, in 1882, and
after his graduation he took a post iurse m the infantry and cav
alry school, where he wa.s a classmate of First Lieutenant Harris of the Fourth
United States Cavalry.
tit Elliott saw a great deal of hard service in several Indian cam
â¢ in Arizona, and it was during those that he won his spurs for con
. ravery. Upon one occasion his classmate. Lieutenant Mott, was
shot and killed by a desperate Indian, and single-handed Lieutenant Elliott ar
ii at tlir- risk of his own life. He refused a number of brilliant
ntments, preferring the rigorous service of the frontier. When the
war broke out he went with his regiment to Cuba, where he distinguished him
self in the assault upon Santla I James E. Nolan, Fourth United
States Cavalry, also a classmate of Lieutenant Elliott, said yesterday in
speaking of him:
"He was one "f the bravest and purest minded officers in the service, and
we were always wont to liken him to Chevalier Bayard, a soldier 'sans peur et
sans reproche.' "

HUNGRY SOLDIERS.
Several Non - Commissionec
Officers Reduced to the Ranks
for Complaining of Food.
A bulletin was posted yesterday on the
board in the street of Company I. First
Tennessee Regiment, at the Presidio, that
is causing considerable quiet indignation
among the men of that company. It is an
order of Captain Givens reuueinf? several
non-commissioned officers to tne ranks..
They are Sergeants Hughes and Douglas
and Corporals George, Eddings and Mar
tin.
A few days ago the men of this com
pany complained that they were not be
ing allowed sufficient food, out no a
tion was naid to the matter. A pi
for better and more food was signed by
74 men of the company, but still the food
was not improved eitln-r in uuantity or
qua'aty. For having taken part in this
affair, so it is claimed. >..ie nun-commis
d offio-rs above mentioned were bul
letined, and they are now plain, ordinary,
everyday privates.
In the case of Sergeant uouglas. a very
efficient man, who has serve-i in t l^ reg
ular army, a petition signed by Vo men
asking that he be retained in his position
was presented to Captain Olvens. who
turned it down and informer Douglas, in
answer to a question, that ho had been
reduced to the ranks on account <>f In
competency. Douglas "indignantly resents
this imputation, claiming to be qualified
In every respect to perform the duties of
sergeant. He and the other displaced of
ficers declare that their degradation is
due to the fact that they protested
against the food dealt out to them, and
furtoermore, they can't understand why
they should be punished for exercising
the constitutional right of petition. Cap
tain (livens, it is alleged, asserted that
they had no right to complain to him.
TIRED OF INACTIVITY.

asking either to be sent to Manila or to

painting buildings, cleaning onicers" qua in
ters and other similar work, and we are
beginning to grow weary. We now have

AN OUTSPOKEN
ASPIRANT FOR
U, S, SENATOR
First Step Required for
Party Success.
MUST WIN THE LEGISLATURE
B. IT. BULLA OF LOS ANGELES
SPEAKS TO THE POINT.
Entered the Contest When There
Was No Thought of a Guberna
: .torial Candidate From
the South.
As A. Camlnettl desired to attend tho
Democratic convention In Atnarlor County
and T. W. 11. Shanahan was engaged In
the dls-eminatlon of Populistic doctrines,
Senator R. NBulia, the Third member of
fho Code Commission, found yesterday an
musj.i.iotis day for putting aFide tho codes
'of the law and taking up the ethics of
as applied to aspirants for the
United States Senate. Mr. liulla had a
hpleasant chat with Major Frank Mc
.Hn, chairman of the Republican
iCta'to Committee, early In the afternoon,
Â«ji<3 later in the day had a pleasant inter
view with United States Senator Perkins
Â©.t tl ip office.
At his rooms in the Grand Hotel, Mr.
t&ulla vms asked to speak regarding his
honor of serving' Califor
nia .In the Senate of the United States.
Jjt is fair to the State 9enator to say that
Sjfte did not court the interview, and
â¢neither did he flee from it. lie said:
.'it i? true that I am an aspirant for the
"Benatorship. When I made up my mind
>fo â  enter for the contest It seemed to be
ijtho accepted conclusion that tho deleg-a
â¢'tton from California in the United States
Seenate should consist of one Senator from
ftlie- northern part of the State and one
from the region of the State south. You
yrtll pardon me if I say that I was con-
I that the position would not be
put .up at auction, but that all aspirants,
rich or poor alike, could aspire and be
, judged on their merits and public record.
rred then, and refer now, to my ser
vice in public office.
"I am In the field as a candidate," con
tinued Mr. Bulla. "yet I have not asked
a candidate for the Legislature or a single
on.c of the hold-over Senators to vote for
me. The first step toward the success of
.'any Republican aspirant is the election
â¢of a Republican Legislature. I will say
â  this frankly, although ii may not be pru
â¢dent to say it, that â â¢â¢hen I entered the
â tfFts for the Senate of the Un'icrci States
' ithere was no thought in the south of
â¢ibringing forward a candidate for Gov
ernor from that section of the State. It
vas accepted as an established custom.
: or' principle, that this State, with its di-
SrersiUts^ of production and Its varying in
terests, bhould always be represented in
nate by one Senator from the north
and another from the south. There should
â¢be no departure from this feature of rep
resentation. The division is fair and just,
â  as .every candid man who considers the
isiUon must admit. There was no
:ht of ;i Southern California eandi
<3ut<" frr Governor until Mr. Gage's can
<l!'dacy was injected.

ly and others indifferent, fancied that as a
measure of protection for myself as a
candidate for tho United States Senate I
should oppose Mr. Gage's efforts to secure
the Republican nomination for Governor.
Upon mature reflection^ I concluded that
the subject of a nominee for Governor
could bo safely left to fhe Republican
BtatQ Convention, and, therefore, 1 have
tiot as much as protested against trie
Fending of a solid delegation to Sacra
mento in support of Mr. Gagre.
"It is my judgment now, as it was when
I entered the contest for the United
States Senate, that the nominee for Gov
ernor should be a clean, strong man from
one of the bay counties. I know that
such a nominee would command the full
Republican vote of Southern California
"ln a conversation I had with Mr. \al
entine. who may be a candidate for
Speaker of the Assembly. I said to him,
as a friend: 'Do you expect that Mr. Gage
of I.os Angeles will be nominated tor gov
ernor, Judte Williams of Ventura for the
Supreme Court, Mr. Guy of San Diego
for Attorney General, Mr. Reeves of ban
Bernardino for State Treasurer and. after
all these nominations have been secured,
a Ix)s Angeles man will be chosen Speaker
of the Assembly? I told him that the
Republicans of tho northern end of the
State would expect some recognition from
the convention.
"It will be no easy task for the Repub
licans to carry California, To insure suc
tho gubernatorial nominee must be
an able active and popular man. who will
command the full strength of the party
in every section of the State."

Campaign Outlined.
At a meeting of the Citizens' Non-Par

at the Academy of Sciences Hall it was
decided to organize for the coming cam

eleoted to the position of permanent
chairman, and will direct the work of the
convention in conjunction with the vari
ous committees to be appointed in the
near future.
After considerable discussion as to
whether it would be advisable to increase
the present membership roll of the con
vention from fifty to seventy-five, it was
decided to preserve the present formation.
Resolutions were passed declaring mem

pal office and exacting a pledge from all

Never has the "push" received such
flattering recognition as it has at the
hands o/ Dr. Pardee. This will be all the
more rÂ«*idi!y manifested when the voters
stop to consider that they were allowed
no part in the selection of the delegates.
Dr. Pardee plainly told them he would
not trust those of them whom he knew
to be his friends to .choose their dele
gates, but insisted on foisting upon them
I such henchmen as ho saw fit to name.- ]
Dr. Pardee has lost many Republican
J votes because of his unfortunate â¢ selec
| tions, but ho hopes to more- than offset
i them by the Democratic heelers he has
drawn to his support. Hundreds of Dem
! ocrats in Oakland alone refrained from
signing their own club rolls, but Instead
I openly joined the Republican ward clubs
solely to help Pardee out.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, SATURDAY, AUGUST 13, IS9B.
TIREY L. FORD
MAKES A MEW
COMBINATION
Now in Los Angeles
With H. T. Gage.
SOUTHERN MANAGERS UNEASY
FEAR THAT THEY WILL LOSE
THE SENATOR.
Plans Are Being Laid to Bring
Solid Delegation From. South
of the Tehachapi
Line.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12.â The political
Mecca of the politicians south of Te
hachapl was to-day honored by the pres
ence of Tirey L. Ford, Republican candi
date for Attorney General. His coming
has not only created a stir among the
local politicians, but it ha.s also strength
ened materially the belief that the plans
of the managers of Henry T. Gage for
forming a combination with other candi
dates is being carried out. Senator Ford,
has apartments at the Hollenbeck, the
headquarters of Mr. Gage, and the fact
has been commented upon by many of
the more liberal minded friends of the
local candidate for Governor. They are
apprehensive of the danger connected
With the making of any combination,
should such be attempted, and regard
such a proceeding as detrimental to the
best interests of the party, desiring, as
they do. the success of the party at the
coming election. They believe that the
nominations should be made entirely free
from any suspicion of political chicanery.
thus avoiding the creating of internal
strife in the party, and they express
themselves as against any candidate Who
will be a party to such methods.
The editorials recently published in The,
Call giving the relative Republican ma
jority vote east south of Tehachapl as
compared with that obtained by Maguire
in Sat: Francisco, has had the effect of
causing the more conservative members
of the party to doubt the advisability of
attempting to elect a Governor from this
end of the Stato, and it is conceded mat
the argument made by The Call is for the
best interests of the party and should be
heeded.
Renewed interest in being taken in tho
election of a United States Senator from
this section to succeed Senator White,
whose term is about to expire. It is feared
that not only would the nomination of a
candidate for Governor from the south
be extremely hazardous, but that it might
result in the loss of the United States
Senator as well. In this connection the
name of U. S. Grant of San Diego was
freely spoken of on the streets to-day.
It is claimed for him that the prestige he
has at Washington will give him a pro
nounced advantage over any new man,
and thus make him at once a power In
the Senate and render him able to se
cure for the State much desired legisla-
The Republican League of Southern
California formally opened its headquar
ters in the Hollenbeck to-night.
Senator Tirey L. Ford will be enter
tained by the Columbia Club at the club
rooms to-morrow evening.
The Democratic delegates from south of
Tehachapi will convene at Sacramento
next Monday afternoon, and an effort will
be made to bring about an agreement for
the delegation to vote as a unit.
\ll active opposition among the Demo
crats of Southern California against Ma
guire for Governor hos been given up.
The same forces, however, will be con
centrated to .secure th<> nomination of a
Democrat for Congress in the Sixth Dis
trict, and every effort will be made to
thwart the indorsement by the Demo
crats of Barlow.

Ing made recommendations to the effect
that the proposed constitutional amend

use and would take four years for its
operation. Also that the number of del

vote cast at the IRSt preceding election:

THE CONVENTION WILL DEAL WITH REA.
CHAIRMAN M'IiAUGHIiIN of the Republican State Central Committee
says in regard to the Santa Clara County primaries:
"I have read in the newspapers of the alleged corruption in the
primaries held the other day in Santa Clara, but the matter has not
been brought before the State Central Committee. Even though a pro
test or contpst were filed with the central committee wo could not take
cognizance of it, as the case has already passed beyond our jurisdiction.
If the steal has been perpetrated by Rea the remedy lies with the State
Convention, and I am confident that body will Investigate the case on its
merits If It is brought up in the proper manner. If the ballot box<*s were
stuffed all that the Republicans of Santa Clara County need to do f* to
take proof of the corruption to the State Convention and lay It before
that body. As intelligent and honest representatives of the Republican
party the delegates will make the necessary investigation and see that jus
tice is done. I do not know and I do not care what Rea's intentions are,
but I do know that the State Convention will not be dominated by bosses."
and county officers, one for every 75; for
local conventions, one delegate to
every 50.
The committee believed that a primary
election law would be in the interest or
good government.
There was some discussion of the re
port, which was adopted, and Max Pop
per offered some laws of other States
bearing on the subject as an assistance
to the committee of nve to be appointed
by Judge Brldgeford for the drafting of a
law to oe submitted to i.ie consideration
of the joint committee. Judge Bridge
ford will notify the persons to be ap
pointed on this committee. The meeting
adjourned subject to the call of the chair
man.
DWYER IS TO MAKE
HARNEY'S FIGHT
The Opening Session of the Demo
cratic Convention Will Be a
Very Lively One:
J. J. Dwyer will champion the cause of
the Harney faction of the Democratic
party at the State Convention next-Tues
day. As he is thoroughly familiar with
the records of the self-constituted reform
ers, who dominate the McNab Committee
of One Hundred, and as he is known to
be a hard fighter, the opening session of
the convention will surely be lively.
Dwyer is out against tho "Whispering"
Boss on every proposition the latter is try
ing to put through and the battle will be
gin as soon as Chairman Alford of the
State Central Committee calls the con
vention to order. The Harneyites want
an impartial Democrat for temporary
chairman so that they -will not b..- shut
out by the appointment of a committee on
credentials which is opposed to them.

DELEGATES TO
BE CONTESTED

SEPARATE DELEGATION TO BE
SENT TO SACRAMENTO.
Santa Clara County Good Government
League Repudiates the Fraud
ulent Primaries of
Wednesday.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 12.â The delegates
of the Good Government League will
repudiate the Rea Republican county
convention and with a full list of dele
gates nominated by the league organize
a convention of their own at Ruther
ford Hall to-morrow morning. This ac
tion was unanimously sanctioned by a
large and enthusiastic meeting of the
Good Government League this after
noon. Not only this, but the league
will send its Congressional and State
delegations to Sacramento to contest
the seating of the Rea delegates. The
grounds on which the contests will be
made are ballot-box stuffing, illegal
voting of Democrats and other gToss
election frauds. Stirring speeches were
made and at times the applause was so
loud at the meeting as to be heard
down on the street.
This action of the Good Government
League, if sanctioned by tha State Cen
tral Committee and State convention,
will prove the death knell to "Jim"
Reaism in Santa Clara County. Honest
and Independent Republicans and the
public generally, since the expose of
ballot-box stuffing and frauds perpe
trated by the Rea forces at Wednes
days primaries, have urged that the
league do this.
The Good Government League meet
ing this afternoon was long and en
thusiastic The greatest unity pre
vailed, and one expressed wish of the
speakers was to adopt such drastic
measures as would rid the Republican
party of Santa Clara County of cor
ruption and political bossism. Things
waxed warm when the following reso
lution was offered:
Rfsolverl, Tru".t on account of flagrant
frauds perpetrated by emissaries of the
ijane in almost every precinct in the
county daring tho primary election or the
10th Inst we, the Good Government
League, repudiate the election and any
action which may be taken by the con
vention to he held on August 13, and
earnestly r.-quest all members of this
organization, in the interest of political
purity, good government and stanch Ke
publlcanism, to remain away from said
convention.
It was adopted unanimously. The
delegates-elect to the county conven
tion jumped to their feet all over the
room to speak to the resolution. They
Were all ready for the fray and wanted
to go to Sacramento to fight it out at
the State Convention.
It was stated that School Trustee M.
J. Graham, who had always been a
Democrat, voted at the Republican pri
mary and was elected a delegate to the
Republican County Convention.
The question of the Good Govern
ment League delegates holding a con
vention of their own was brought up
and tho following resolution unani
mously adopted:
Resolved, That the delegates elected to
the county convention do not attend, but
meet at 10 a. m. on August 13 and or
ganize by electing a temporary chairman
and adjourning until the 27th day of Au
gust, which is four days after the meet-
Ing of the State Convention.
The applause had not died down be
fore this resolution had been unani
mously passed:
Resolved, That believing we have been
defrauded of our rights in the late pri
mary election, it is . the sense of this
meeting that we do contest the election
of delegates to the State and Congres
sional conventions.
The following statistics, evidencing
the wholesale voting of Democrats at
the primaries, were read at the meet
ing:

REA'S SLATE MADE UP.
The San Joss Boss Not Satisfied With
the Result of Wednesday's
Primaries.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 12.â This w:is a day
of conferences at "Boss" Rea's real estate
office, on North First, street, and all the
candidates and gangsters were given an
audience.
Rea is not pleased with the result of
Wednesday's primaries. He sees that he
made a mistake in giving instructions to
the election officers to win by any means.
The crookedness and fraud was so open
that the people became thoroughly ac
quainted with gang methods and promise
to administer a bitter rebuke at the fall
election to his way of doing politics.
After all the conferences to-day these
are tho choices of Boss Rea, and will
probably comprise the ticket nominated
to-morrow :
Superior Judge, J. C. Black.

The Republican County Central Com
mittee refuses to give out the vote cast
at the primaries throughout tho county.
Tliis is because the vote exceeds that cast
for M.-riv.lev two y.ars aero, and they
are afraid complications may arise.
